Divorce,3e7527,Altruizzy,3,Wed Jul 22 14:10:20 2015 UTC,30 pounds plus her dead weight.
Divorce,3e7527,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:29:20 2015 UTC,"I lost 30lbs in the 1.5 months after I found out about her affair. I rode that wave for awhile with working out, then the depression hit. That sucked and gained me back 20 pounds.   If you aren't already seeing a therapist can really help when you hit the depression wave."
Divorce,3e7527,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:20:12 2015 UTC,"I went through a period of 3 or 4 weeks where the only solid food I could eat was applesauce.  Best weight loss plan ever!  Hang in there.  As others have said, get yourself a therapist.  It will help you learn to separate your self image from her actions, if you know what I mean. What you're going through sucks, but you're going to be OK in the long run if you take care of yourself."

I'm going to say the majority was McDonalds based...  Now I'm trying to maintain the muscle and lose the slight jiggle in the middle... Proving slightly difficult... Carb addiction and all.

I've been out of my parent's place for 3 weeks. Been eating about 95% homecooked meals. I'll be honest, yesterday I hit up McDonalds for the first time since I moved. I was starving, and had a 45 minute drive home. I had chilli on the crockpot at home but that's lunch and dinner for probably the rest of the week now."
Divorce,3e7527,rasconjon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"For me, its definitely sugar.  Carbs is close enough that it'll cause problems for me.  The problem is, in the US sugar and HFCS is in. every. ****ing. thing.  If I don't make it myself, it probably has added sugar."

And that, as I support myself and need another person less, it will allow me to CHOOSE my next partner instead of NEED them and that will make my next relationship 1000x better.  These are just emotions (panic, anxiety) and they will pass.  They can't hurt you.  Good luck, hang in there. :)"

The idea of starting over can be VERY VERY hard, but realize that you can start over and focus on what's important to you. You get a fresh start in life.  Being alone can be scary, but it's better to be alone, then be with someone you don't like being with. Or being with someone who isn't really there. You should try to feel comfortable being alone, with yourself, before you try to be with another person."

Divorce,3e7bk8,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately with anxiety there's no medication that's good for long term treatment, any that are out there are good for a short term or emergency treatment but overtime they lose their efficacy which is why it's really important to pair treatment with a therapist with any medication."
Divorce,3e7bk8,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:15:26 2015 UTC,Bluntly:  Have you considered filing bankruptcy?  That would let you/her walk away from the house which unless it has significant equity is going to be a loss anyway.  It also resolves the outstanding credit card debt.   Question though I thought SAD was Seasonal Affective Disorder and was a sunlight thing.
Divorce,3e7bk8,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:04:36 2015 UTC,"SAD Social anxiety disorder. I don't know if that is the official acronym or not, I have just always used it.  I have thought about bankruptcy but the debt may not be an issue after divorce. My current dilemma is affording to live financially on $1000 a month if I cant get a job and the emotional aspect on top of that.  Currently the debt other than the house should be taken care of before the divorce is complete. I have contemplated bankruptcy but would like to wait and see what we can do with the sale of the house prior. My credit currently is immaculate and may be the other thing going for me right now."

Divorce,3e6kmf,rasconjon,4,Wed Jul 22 10:32:21 2015 UTC,"But it needs to be stuff you agree upon.   It doesn't always have to be agreed upon.  ""Possession is 9/10 of the law"" sometimes.  i.e. if she removes anything without his knowledge or consent, and he would have preferred to keep it.  Sometimes it is easier/cheaper/better to let the item go and simply account for it in the property settlement.  If they can't come to agreement on what she removes from the house, he can still make sure it is valued as part of the assets she is entitled to take."
Divorce,3e6kmf,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:20:38 2015 UTC,I kinda covered that in note what she takes...   That happened to me... I was supposed to get a bunch of our electronics and she yanked them from my box during the house pack up without me noticing. We didn't have a written property division agreement and she's been telling me to pound sand about the items... But what's a couple more grand over happiness
Divorce,3e6kmf,rasconjon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"I only clarified what you said because the ""it needs to be agreed upon"" might be misconstrued by OP or someone else to mean ""she can't take it if we don't agree.""  Which, as you already know from personal experience, is not true."
Divorce,3e6kmf,LaTuFu,4,Wed Jul 22 13:29:50 2015 UTC,"Short answer is yes, she can remove personal property from the house.  Legally, everything belongs to both of you.  Unless there is documentation to prove sole ownership, all the personal property in your house (clothing, appliances, furniture, etc) is assumed to be jointly owned.  You can ask her by email to make a list of the items she would like to take out of the house.  If she refuses to give you a list, then make a list yourself as she removes things from the house.  Don't argue with her about removing them or make it a conflict.  Let her take all of the items she thinks she wants.  Later on, when you're going through the property settlement process, you can use this list to say ""here's the value of the stuff you already took"" to deduct from any assets she tries to ask for.  Above all, remember that stuff is just stuff, and stuff can be replaced.  5 years from now, when this is all over, and you have your boys, you'll have completely different stuff--even if you kept everything you have now.  Focus on the important things, your boys.  The stuff can be replaced."
Divorce,3e6kmf,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:24:27 2015 UTC,"""here's the value of the stuff you already took""    INAL, but at least in Indiana the ""stuff"" has no documented value unless it's considered a major asset.  My 1st divorce I was being an ass and listed a nice SLR camera as mine ~$300 value - but they typically leave the details of stuff as just this generic thing you hash out with your ex.  My 2nd, I pretty much let her clear the house - I retained a few things I really gave a shit about.  For her, she placed more value on the things than I would so it appeased her to take a better deal for me in other areas.  LaTuFu's suggestion about using the list is still good, you might get your ex to realize she made out well, but legally I think it doesn't hold water.   I.e. An attorney is going to let her know it really doesn't count against something like the net value of the house."
Divorce,3e6kmf,Daemon42,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true.  You certainly won't be able to stack it against the value of a ""real"" asset like the house or cash/savings accounts."
Divorce,3e6kmf,LaTuFu,3,Wed Jul 22 14:02:50 2015 UTC,Lawyer. Get one.
Divorce,3e6kmf,CoyoteBrown,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reaching out via something you can document (like email) and request her to list the major items she wants.  Until you are actually divorced, everything is still 100% both of yours.  She can take what she wants.  However the more unreasonable she is, the worse that will do for her when you go to separate.  If you don't want a divorce, playing nice and being amicable isn't a bad move either.  Make a plea to cooperate but ask for counseling it done your if compromise towards a shot of getting back together."
Divorce,3e6kmf,Daemon42,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:04:10 2015 UTC,Are there particular things you worry about or is it more that you don't want her taking anything because you are upset?
Divorce,3e5wqh,AwesomeScreenName,3,Wed Jul 22 05:05:25 2015 UTC,"That is stupid beyond belief.  Talk about sour grapes!      Document everything.  Even if you can't push that hard right now, getting it in record will help if crazy speaks up again.  Are you remaining in contact with her?  Why do you think she is still doing childish crap like this?  Also I'd recommend not discussing this with the ex.  Part of the motivation here is to get a reaction from you... If that is a sanitized legal one, this kindly falls flat."
Divorce,3e5wqh,Daemon42,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:19:59 2015 UTC,"No contact whatsoever. None initiated by me, anyway.  Every now and then, she will reach out to me with some nonsense -- the most recent was when her car registration was expiring and I was somehow supposed to renew the registration for her, since I had previously done that.  Never mind that I had previously done that when we were a married couple, and never mind that she had moved to another state, so I wasn't really in a position to deal with her new state's DMV.  Anyway, based on these exchanges (and now the website), she seems to have left rationality far behind.  I'm documenting and leaving it up to my attorney otherwise, just as you suggest."
Divorce,3e5wqh,Daemon42,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"I have a touch of crazy like that with my 2nd ex.  Initially I was responding to things with ""Ok, this isn't my responsibility"" and 1/2 the time that would draw me into an agrument and I'd feel like an idiot for falling into the trap.  Then I got smarter and just ignored the shit out of her.  Email, delete.  Text message, block.  Funny how I've not heard from her going on 2 months now (it's SOOOOO nice).  I'm thankful I don't have any kids with her, because that would damn near suck to deal with.  Anyway - best of luck to you on getting this to die!"

Divorce,3e5wqh,allwrongs,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"Depending on how complex the site is, she might have spent a total of around $20, some sites are cheap.  I say this and I held my lastname.com domain for years and finally got tired of the annual $12 I was forking out for it (I never followed up to use it).  But because I had held it, now another site squater has it and believes it's valuable.

Divorce,3e6ky3,divorce_acct,6,Wed Jul 22 10:14:43 2015 UTC,40 hrs a week and you want them to work more. Wow you must be working like 60 hours a week or something.  Have you put on any weight? What effort have you taken to look sexy or keep in shape?  Whatever you do don't have kids until this is resolved. I would strongly recommend going to relationship counselling - it really helps.
Divorce,3e6ky3,teambob,3,Wed Jul 22 10:44:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, I see how the work thing sounds. It isn't that I feel he needs to kill himself under more hours or anything but pick up some of the slack at home rather than sit on the couch in his pjs while I cook dinner and clean up after a 12hr shift.   I do keep myself at a healthy weight and when he mentioned that there was some weight gain we worked together to lose it but he stopped putting in any effort to diet or exercise.  I wish he would go to counseling. I have offered."
Divorce,3e6ky3,SlyFrog,2,Wed Jul 22 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"You sound a little nuts. Complaining that someone is barely working 40 hours a week, combined with the rest of your complaints, sounds like you're excessively demanding.  The problem is, I doubt that you will be able to stop. It's likely your basic personality type. You see those people here from time to time - they usually gloat/brag about how they're keeping everything together, they worked on X or Y (often getting their degree or some plum job) while their spouse just gets along in the world, how they've kept their tight, awesome body in the gym and people of the opposite sex are hot for them, etc., while their partner has put on 15 pounds.  Be honest with yourself. If you're that person, that's fine, and perhaps you have to leave to go find a super-human companion who is as good as you, but don't take it out on your partner or pretend that it is somehow his or her fault."
Divorce,3e6ky3,evdiddy,2,Wed Jul 22 13:33:17 2015 UTC,"Excellent, excellent post.  I have often wondered if I was reading certain posts here the same as everybody else.  And an important question for OP to answer honestly, if not here, internally."
Divorce,3e6ky3,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:20:58 2015 UTC,Have you thought about counseling?   Cutting back some hours to focus on your marriage and helping your spouse to be more active?
Divorce,3e6ky3,dono111,2,Wed Jul 22 12:36:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like my relationship...The ambition thing, I totally get.  It's pretty frustrating when she goes to work, puts in her 40  hours or whatever it may be, but then you feel like you have to put more hours in or find a better paying job to buy a house.    I used to tell her all of the time I feel like we're just roommates for years.  It really bugged her for me to even say that, but it's the truth.  So now I feel like we're attached at the hip and it's annoying.  I'm in the same boat as you for 15 years and it doesn't matter what you've had in the past, if you're not going to be happy in the future, then you will need to have the talk and move on if you can't come to some sort of agreement with a time limit on it for your own sanity."
Divorce,3e6ky3,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:09:42 2015 UTC,If you feel that your Spouse should work more than 40 hours a week then the problem is with you not your spouse and you should start seeing a marriage counselor and personal therapist to actually realize that a relationship is not about working at your job all the time.
Divorce,3e6ky3,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jul 22 14:41:42 2015 UTC,I would suggest that you're trying to buy too large of a house or living above your means if both of you are working full time and you still can't afford to buy a house.  Expecting one or both spouses to work overtime just to balance a household budget is a very unrealistic (and unhealthy) way to maintain a marriage.
Divorce,3e6ky3,allwrongs,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"Guys, are we not gonna talk about the elephant in the room?...  I'm so confused by your writing...

Divorce,3e6ky3,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:42:59 2015 UTC,I think OP is attempting to keep gender from the discussion by using impersonal pronouns.  They/Them = OPs Spouse.

Divorce,3e6ky3,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you need to step back and take stock of what is important to you in your life.  Balance in life is critical to the foundation of any healthy relationship.  If you're critical of your spouse because they are only working 40 hours a week that is a you problem that needs to be sorted out, ASAP.  It sounds like you might be struggling with some materialism, or have issues with chasing a lifestyle that the two of you can't support.  It is possible that his response to you is entirely due to realizing the futility and stress that accompany your demands, as well as the impossibility of achieving perfection.  If my wife only respected me if I worked myself to death 60-80 hours a week, I'd check out on the marriage, too.  We're more than just paychecks to each other.  There is a Christian book on marriage that I highly recommend, even if you are not a believer, called Love and Respect.  I recommend reading the first chapter or two and see if your marriage is being described.    The breakdown in your marriage that you are describing is a very common symptom of two people who have found themselves chasing after a lifestyle, instead of realizing that keeping a marriage healthy is a priority and requires work all on its own.  Both of you have contributed to where this marriage has ended up, not just your husband.  It will require both of you being willing to step back, evaluate flaws and admit mistakes, in order to heal this marriage.  As long as you only point the finger at all of his failures, no amount of counseling or gym memberships is going to prevent this ship from sinking."

Divorce,3e4wns,nobodycanfuckmyhappy,2,Tue Jul 21 23:56:03 2015 UTC,"Each parent is free to choose how to celebrate the child's birthday on their own visitation time.  If you sign up for the agreement she wants, you're basically saying ""I realize I get no vote in how expensive this party will be, but you're going to stick me with half the bill.""  Nope. Nope, and Nope.  If she wants to celebrate the birthday at Chuck E. Cheeze for $300, that's on her.   Who is the mediator for this process?  It's not a bad choice, unless she insists on a court appointed mediator that will cost you $150/hr every time she doesn't get her way.  Understand that she's going to threaten mediation every time you don't give in to what she wants.   What is your lawyer saying about the agreement?

No med-arb. Is that something that is recommended? Am I being unreasonable here? My lawyer said people who are pushy frequently use mediation because it's so cheap compared to court costs.

I assume you have a lawyer of your own?  what does your lawyer say about all this?  If you don't have one, you need to get one yesterday.     Also, in the past she has threatened to accuse me of physically abusing her. She's told me she would bruise herself and then call the cops telling them I did it. (I have never touched her and never will).   Do you have any documented evidence of her saying this?  Anyone who can back it up?  This is all the more reason to have a lawyer on your side.

Unfortunately the ex is smart enough to only bring up accusing me of abuse when we've been alone.  A friend has suggested I video any future times I have to be alone with her but I really don't want to put myself in that situation.  Basically my lawyer advised me to leave as soon as she threatened anything but I don't really think that's the best advice.

Start pushing for it ASAP.  Your journal should have started back in November and include any threats of false abuse allegations.  Your STBX isn't going to br credible by claiming you are an abuser on one hand and then on the other want you to meet her at the home for exchanges.

However we are going to a precourt settlement in the fall where a final decision is made by the judge. I don't really understand all this and am frustrated. I've always been there for my boys. Every lie she wrote in her statement to the judge about how I was never there for the boys was taken for truth. It's almost as if he didn't read my statement which could be verified by daycare records and witnesses.  I am at my wits end with all of this and just want things settled. The STBXs family has lots of money and threatens court for everything knowing I can't afford it. But I will go if necessary because I will do anything to be with my boys.    As for her claims of abuse I never thought about what you mentioned. I really think she wants to meet at her house to trap me.

Meet in neutral places, and never go into any building or room alone with your ex.  Always have a friend or relative with you for the exchanges.  This will help keep things civil, or at the very least give her reason to pause if there is a witness.  Let your lawyer know why you will only communicate through email.

Unfortunately it doesn't sound like he's on the same level as you (as the other comment mentioned). When things get stressful he runs, into himself and away from his family. He would have to change a lot for you guys to work.   I'm sorry, it's not easy, but there's only so much that YOU can do. At a certain point he has to contribute and he's not.   You need to think long term. Even if you bring him around this time where's the guarantee he won't freak out later?  And besides, do you really want to be in a marriage where you have to constantly talk your partner into staying?  He should want to be there as much as you want him there.   Good luck."

Divorce,3e2uhf,bboy1977,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Is he willing to go to marriage counseling with you? Is he willing to start seeing a personal therapist?  If he's not then that's pretty bad news. A marriage can't survive with only one person working to preserve it and from how you describe his lifestyle it is completely contrary to what it means to be married.  Even if he refuses therapy it would be a great idea for you to look into seeing a personal therapist to help you deal with the emotional rollercoaster that you're on right now.  Even if this time ends up like the others and he backs down from wanting a divorce you need to push for joint and individual therapy because this is not a healthy relationship and this is not a relationship you want to model for your children as what is normal and to look for in their own relationships when they're older.   It's absolutely alright to feel the way you do, you feel that way because you are committed to the marriage and the relationship. Only you can decide how long you want to fight for the marriage, you're the one that will have to look yourself in the mirror and say that you did everything you possibly could before ending the marriage.  That being said if he files for divorce you have to get a lawyer to make sure you have someone looking out for your best interests."

The type of lifestyle isn't all that great if you want to spend time with the kids and family, BUT one can make it work by sucking it up on the weekends.    Between the stress and the last marriage that ended up in a mess, maybe he just doesn't want to deal with it and is shutting down.  You both should try counseling so you both hear each other."
Divorce,3e2uhf,LaTuFu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"This is so true.  He probably does just want to relax on the weekends, and it doesn't help that he comes home and works on the kitchen.  It's like he can't give himself a break.  I guess I can't fix him."

Anything preventing you from working on the kitchen while he is out?  Are the kids are they in school or daycare at least part of the day?  If its all on him, 14 hour days for weeks on end without seeing your family takes a toll. You gain a ton of weight working long hours, traveling, eating out etc. Last thing you do is go to the gym as going out for drinks and dinner with coworkers is the norm. I remember my coworkers with families back when I used to do the travel thing, they spent most of their kids' childhood interacting with them on the telephone, barely seeing them or their spouse. And the way people dealt with it was drugs, alcohol and infidelity.  Something is bothering him, and whatever it is, is impacting you very negatively as well.     If I were you I would absolutely fight to make it work.  Divorce sucks. A minimum of going to counseling so that he hears your concerns and you find out exactly what his deal is.  If after that it just confirms a split at least you know you did everything you could and tried - no regrets."

I know he worries about being away from his daughter so much.  He does make the majority of our income though, far surpassing mine, and I think he does feel a certain pressure to provide.  I know I haven't been doing as good of job building him up lately, it's easy to let that slide when you think he's doing just fine.  I know his job is really stressful right now, and I think it's making him want to throw himself into work and give up on all the other issues he's got in his life.  I just need to try and get him to see that isn't the right way to deal, and try and help him."

Everyone's marriage struggles at times.  Maybe he just views your needs as purely financial and he is ignoring your other needs.  That's why I think counseling is best.  You both need a third party there who will help you both communicate your needs to each other.  Even if you can convince him to go on his own, at least you know he is trying.   Best of luck with the future, seriously don't jump to divorce unless you are facing abuse or some other extreme.  It sucks so much."

I'm the living counter-example to that, as I handled my own divorce and custody issues, winning versus my ex's high priced attorney.  I made plenty of mistakes that made my divorce and custody issues take much longer than they really should have.  Here is my layman's advice, based on my personal experience.  This should not be considered legal advice.  Your friends are technically right about filing a contempt petition, however this is the ""very big stick"" in these kinds of situations.  If you do this, it will cost you money, and leave you both angry.  You'll pay for this in many ways, some monetary, some not, as you go forward with co-parenting your children. I would avoid the contempt petition unless you truly have no other option.  If your wife is not cooperating with your palsy ""as agreed"" custody arrangement, you need to begin proceedings to modify your custody agreement to something that is more defined.  There are all kinds of steps to this that are very jurisdiction dependent.  While it's possible to do this yourself, there are lots of ""gotchas"" to these procedures that can leave you disadvantaged if you don't check all the boxes as you work through the process.

I would guess that Florida has similar flexibility allowances in their agreements.  OP's ex is just refusing to abide, which is probably not unusual in FL either."

I just want what is best for my kids. Stbx has anger issues and I thought I was the cause of it, divorce hasn't changed much in terms of her behavior."
Divorce,3e01i9,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:16 2015 UTC,You're not the cause of her anger issues.  She's likely got some childhood baggage that she's not dealing with.  What is the relationship like with your inlaws?  Do they treat the two of you well? Do they treat each other well?  Or are they divorced and rarely speak to each other?

It is also irrelevant who is on the deed if the house was purchased during your marriage.  It is a marital asset if it was acquired during the marriage.  How much of the asset she can claim has a lot to do with the funds used to purchase it.  If any of those funds were pre-marital funds, and you have the proper documentation, then you may be able to claim a bit more.  You need to contact an attorney and ask for advice on how to proceed.  Do not force your wife to do anything, and be very civil.  You may find yourself on the wrong end of a trumped up DV claim if you try to be too much of a jerk about the situation."

Divorce,3dzjif,LaTuFu,3,Mon Jul 20 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of reasons, but I'll sum up the major ones I learned from my experience keeping my marital home:   Owning a home is a lot of work for two people.  It's a shitload of work for a single person. If you bought a house big enough to start a family, it is a monster to heat and cool for one person to live in. If you ever move on with your life (I know, way too far in the distance to see right now) you'll very likely realize that moving on with someone else in this house is a bad idea."
Divorce,3dzjif,ecto_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"I see your reasoning. Thankfully, I bought a small house (couldn't afford more), and while upkeep is kind of a pain, she wasn't doing any of the work anyway (literally). I mowed the lawn, I repaired things, I did the inside cleaning, I did the outside cleaning, you name it, it was my chore. So at least now I'm only doing it for me, which is so much fucking easier. And thankfully, I've got a flat rate with Georgia Power, so it's the same cost (actually, my usage has dropped significantly). The last point is a good one, and yeah... I can see that. If I get to that state, though, I'll probably have some equity by then and at least come out as a wash rather than another $10,000 in debt."

She may not be legally obligated to stay out of the house, in which case, stop being a jerk. However, if you're already in the process of filing/separation/divorce, there could be some wiggle room. You could possibly change the locks legally since she won't agree to your request. Again, check the legality of that before you do anything."

Divorce,3e0av8,toasterchild,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"...and from hhs.gov. It appears it isn't a breach because it's covered under the need to collect payment for treatment. All they have to do is provide the minimum info necessary.   Does the HIPAA Privacy Rule permit a covered entity or its collection agency to communicate with parties other than the patient (e.g., spouses or guardians) regarding payment of a bill?  Answer:  Yes. The Privacy Rule permits a covered entity, or a business associate acting on behalf of a covered entity (e.g., a collection agency), to disclose protected health information as necessary to obtain payment for health care, and does not limit to whom such a disclosure may be made.  Therefore, a covered entity, or its business associate, may contact persons other than the individual as necessary to obtain payment for health care services. See 45 CFR 164.506(c) and the definition of “payment” at 45 CFR 164.501. However, the Privacy Rule requires a covered entity, or its business associate, to reasonably limit the amount of information disclosed for such purposes to the minimum necessary, as well as to abide by any reasonable requests for confidential communications and any agreed-to restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. See 45 CFR 164.502(b), 164.514(d), and 164.522.   http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/faq/disclosures/266.html"

Divorce,3e0av8,anisaerah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:19 2015 UTC,"Well, this is kindof difficult to answer, but I explain as best as I can.   We have two very young children together. 2 and 4. And they will be devastated if they know/ what's going on,.. they are already upset over our fights, my daughter cried in school, teachers asked ""is mom and dad having dinners together w/ you etc."". For their safety and happiness sake, we have to keep it sane while they are around. I currently live downstairs in my bedroom (moved out of the master bedroom from upstairs, to a smaller room). He has a very explosive nature and temperament. I thought as he aged, people would grow mature. Nope. Not him. He's still a gangster pretty boy he was when he was 15 at 35. If you dong see eye-to-eye with him on all things, he's extremely adversarial. If you're not with him, you're against him. His nature is very binary, and he simply doesn't have the accumen, emotional intelligence or sagacity or wisdom to improve. As far he's concerned, he has already learned everything there is know by the time he's 16, and he's a man, and there's nothing more to learn. It's extremely hard to reason with stupid -- but there is simply no way. I am not insulting my children's dad, I am just saying matter as it is. All he has done w/ his life is, 'wow, hmm, I'm too lazy and dumb to study or work hard, I'd just join the navy, put in my 5 yrs, and make all the moniez, get out and marry a rich white girl, and buy all the blings'. He still hasn't yet acknowledged my decision for divorce, and is still in denial. I am an entrepreneur and is the chief source of income and bread winner at home.. I pay for everything, groceries, all sorts of bills, kids schools, expenses, shopping, needs, medicines, toiletries, HOA, 50% of the mortgage, heating/gas,electricity, phones, etc. He' comes up with the other 50% of the mortgage. We recently bought this home, not even 6~7 months yet. Though staying together is not cheaper, if we split, I'm sure I'd be paying a huge sum of my income as child support to him. My hours are very flexible (though I wish to work more hrs, and make more). We fight and crib every day over something. I do not want to put fuel to an already flaming situation,.. I live in this house,.. my children live in this house.. I have no family or friends here,.. I do not want to aggravate an already escalating situation. This divorce has to be strategic. My friends, and attorney are working on a plan, which I follow. He has had a vasectomy many years ago. He's jealous of every guy friend I talk to, go running with, hang out and gets into an argument with me,... I work daily, and I am tired after all the home work is done, and kids are put to bed, and I cannot fight with him all night, i need the rest as I have to wake up at 5 every AM. He takes every opportunity to get into a fit and argument. If I get an IUD, he'd go nuclear - and accuse me of an affair."

When I logged in online I was never able to see his health claims, but his pharmacy transactions did show up.

Be completely honest with the court psychologist or therapist that conducts the interviews.  Tell the kids to be honest with them as well.  When you talk to them, make sure you show them the emails that went without response for the sports, medical visits, school, etc.  Be sure to show all of the documentation you can of the communications you sent that went unanswered.  Then just mention that he moved away without notice.  Don't say anything else about that point. Stick to the facts, let them color in the margins.  ""He moved away unannounced.  I sent this email on that date asking for input on spring sports.  This date for the medical exam.  This date for the dyslexia screening.

Divorce,3dyz2n,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're throwing up your hands in feigned helplessness a little too much on this, by waiting for your ex to respond.  I have primary residential custody, and share legal custody with my ex wife.  While I get it that you're required by the terms of your agreement to seek his permission for sports and non-emergency medical care, what I've found is that most places just aren't that conscientious about checking.  When my kid needs something, I simply do it.  While I did consult with her on really big decisions (braces, meds for ADHD) in most cases I simply do what I think is best without consulting her.  What will your ex do if you take Johnny to get his teeth cleaned after he doesn't respond with permission? He's not going to take you to court for that: his attorney will tell him that's foolish.  My thought process is this (and yes, I realize that it's not 100% the ""letter of the law""): wtf is she going to do, take me to court for providing care and supporting healthy activities and friends?  I've been to family court enough that I know how it goes.  I am not going to be sanctioned for a dental hygienist appointment, filling, minor medical procedure, or allowing my kid to play a sport.  Having been there, at most I'll get a judicial sigh and eye-roll which says ""why the f#ck are you two wasting my time with this sh#t?"" As long as you're not taking your kids to get tattoos as minors, or something else equally controversial, you're not going to get cited for contempt for appropriately supporting your kids' lives.  By throwing up your hands, delaying treatment for your kids, and stopping your kids from participating in sports or other activities, because a dad who travels for work doesn't respond timely, you are very definitely putting your kids in the middle of your stuff with your ex, especially if you make it clear that they can't participate because dad didn't respond.  ""You can't play baseball/soccer/basketball because of Daddy."" What you're doing smells more than a bit of manipulation, at least in my opinion.  The other behavior you describe from your ex is not okay: short notice parenting time changes and cancellations, and failing to respond to permission requests. However, you're not quite as innocent as you're trying to portray.  It takes two to tango, and you can, apparently, dance.  Edit: further, your writing style and description of your actions sound pretty familiar. I feel like we've done this dance before.  Reviewing post history."
Divorce,3dyz2n,hubbyofhoarder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, good to hear from you again.  Hope you've been well.  You aren't wrong: I used to send the notice, then go ahead and register them and eat the cost when he didn’t respond.  I made sure that practice didn’t eat into his parenting time, and tried to walk a thin line between letting the kids do what they could do and not pissing him off.  In terms of notice time, it varied anywhere from 2 weeks – 45 days…as much as I could give him prior to a registration deadline.  This worked for the first year of our divorce, from Sep ’13 to about Sep ’14.  Then came the dyslexia.  The treatment request was filed almost a year ago, and came at the recommendation of my son's’ teacher, principal and pediatrician.  I waited until Christmas, through two parent-teacher conferences that he scheduled, then failed to show up for, and then decided to move forward with a specialist under the auspices of educational decision-making.  I got slapped with a contempt filing.  His lawyer categorized it as a medical decision which is joint, due to costs.  I was ultimately successful in avoiding a contempt charge, but it cost me a good bit in legal fees and had a very severe chilling effect.  Hence, no winter/spring sports.  Or dental work this year.    I wish I lived in a place where judges would dismiss this “shit” with an eye roll.  Apparently, you do.  Here, they seem altogether eager to accept any filing a family lawyer provides – my own attorney told me she was surprised that the contempt filing was even entertained.  Just like she was ‘surprised’ that they ruled in favor of the PRE, despite no evidence being provided that pointed to my alienating the children.  What ultimately prompted my modification request is the fact that I seem perpetually constrained by impossible choices.  Like watching my son ‘lose’ a year of literacy.  Like telling him I can’t pay for sports when in fact, I’m just not permitted to sign him up.   Which leads me to your next, very incorrect assumption: I have never once told my children that ""Daddy"" prevented anything.  I usually make a vague excuse along the lines of it not being in the budget, or the class was full.   Given that our household budget is tight, the first excuse usually works.  I also cover for him when he cancels last minute… I explain that his job is very demanding, he loves them very much, etc.  I’m not a saint, but my children’s perception of these events will shape their future emotional well-being and so the stakes are much, much, MUCH higher than scoring bullshit points by making the snide remarks you presume that I’m making.    The motivation to ensure that my kids turn out to be decent, well-adjusted human beings - who will avoid making my mistakes - absolutely outweighs any momentary impulse to complain.   I'm sure that you can relate to that, to some degree.  If you have some specific advice, rather than questioning my motives, I’m open to it.  Hence the post.  EDIT: BTW, our previous correspondence was regarding federal tax credits ...I believe that your ex was unemployed and ineligible to return to her former career and I told you to inquire about work opportunity employers with the state.  I could be wrong, but I have you marked WOTC in RES."

A contempt petition for treatment for treatment for a legitimate life-affecting learning issue? Who the hell does that? For all the crazy stuff with my ex, she never gives me crap about getting my son the care he needs, which in his case included a year with a reading specialist.    In your case, what I would do is, after the first ""no response"" request, is to include a time suspense in the second, with the explicit statement that you will go to court for court approval should your ex not respond.  Unless your ex is stupid, he will respond to this.  If he doesn't, actually file a motion with the court for approval of whatever action you need. In this case, you can probably do this without an attorney, although you may  incur filing fees.  Given that you're already in the middle of an evaluation (which is, again, mind boggling, given the detail that you've given), I would follow other posters' advice: relax as much as you can, and be truthful.  The truth is your friend, in this case."
Divorce,3dyz2n,hubbyofhoarder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"As for courts accepting filings: they have to do so. In the initial stages of a filing, no evidence is presented, one party simply states or avers that X is happening, and asks for Y because of that.  There's no avoiding the acceptance of any legal motion.    I don't fear those, as I've represented myself successfully many times, in family court and in other judicial venues.  My lack of concern isn't (and shouldn't be) typical; I failed to account for my own biases."

He was raised in a great church, and just fallen so suddenly and far away from his walk with God.  I'm so scared to lose him, I'm scared about what divorce actually means for me in my walk.  I wish we could work on it, but barring a miracle, it seems doomed.  He asks for divorce every 6 months or so, he cycles through this dark zone where he stops going to church, stops praying, and allows the devil right in.  We both do, only I never want to stop working."

Divorce,3dy2sn,Tranquil_Coffee,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"Hey Lyns, I was in same boat as you when my ex wanted to leave.  What you are feeling now is normal given the circumstances.    It wasn't a fun roller coaster to be on, I often felt crippled, and had no appetite, and many many tears.  It took me a while to get over it, and to be honest I still struggle with things like dreams from time to time.  I want to say you are going to be just fine.   I'm freshly divorced ( woohoo Late June!)  She gave me the ""I love you but I'm not in love with you"" speech.   After months of trying to rekindle the flame I ended up finding out she was being dishonest to say the least.    I filed for divorce when I found out.     Part of me doesn't like how it all went down.   But I've come to accept it.   I've even forgave her but not before filing for divorce and dealing with these feelings on my own.     We didn't have any kids so it made it a bit easier but 8 years is a long time.    I've had to deconstruct almost everything I thought I knew, myself, my goals, my hopes and dreams.     It is not easy.   But there is a light at the end of the tunnel.     I found out I'm fairly attractive and most woman I've seen told me I'm a catch, my ex rarely gave me compliments and wasn't that affectionate.   I'm not saying this to toot my own horn but after years of feeling just mediocre to getting a lot of attention it is nice.   Best thing is, I'm honest with these woman and tell them I'm non-committal.  Which is okay, but I know deep down I want something more, something like I thought I had.   I want love.   I've opted to finish my goals in academia before I decide to actively search for a partner, and who knows?   Maybe she'll be around the next corner I turn.  We never know.   In any event, not sure if I cheered you up or whatever, more just here to explain some of my frustrations in hopes that you see we're all in the same boat, in that we are all suffering to some extent.

I feel like I'm too old to be alone, but like you, all I want is love.

She graduates and now I'm here picking up the pieces.     Not too bad though, my job is great, and I have the freedom to go to college.   No complaints. :)    What do I do for hope?     I take each day one day at a time,  if and when I start to get depressed or think about things, I stop myself, usually make myself laugh by saying some ridiculous shit out loud like I have tourettes syndrome.    I break my thoughts mid cycle.  This is not to say I didn't deal with my emotions early on ( you're supposed to feel, and cry, and grieve, the tears help the pain, and as my counselor I was seeing early on during the separation ""If you want to heal, you gotta feel"".)  This help me deal with a lot of problems.  Also I treat my thoughts apart from who I am.  If I don't like a thought, I discard it.  (For me this took practice, and meditation to grasp)    I don't get depressed often anymore but when I do, I deal with it.    If I feel like crying (I actually cried for about 10 minutes the other week, and hadn't cried before that for months).  I cry.   But I understand now these emotions are part of this process and, my friends love me, my family loves me, I make them all happy and have old friends that tell me they are dying to see me because they miss my energy and happy go lucky attitude on life.       I remind myself consistently that I am a great person, an imperfect person, a person going through life dealing with it as best as I know how. I remind myself that those in my life cherish me, and they need me.   I remind myself I am heading towards great things, and plan on changing the world.   I remind myself to be kind to people and it will come back to me.    I remind myself to love myself, family, and friends.   I remind myself with perspective, that life can always be worse and in all of these things I have that I can be grateful for.  There's probably a lot I'm leaving out of here but I am at work so perhaps I should be doing some of that haha.    In any event, just hold on now, and take the turns on the roller coaster you are on as best you can.   Life gets better, but only if you want it to."

It's OK to feel angry.    It's OK to feel depressed.    It's OK to feel anxiety.    It's also OK to feel scared.  So start with the basics.  Reach out to family and friends.  Don't be afraid to say, ""I'm not ok.""  Don't let feelings of shame prevent you from asking for help.  Build a support structure around you of friends and family that you can trust.   Next call and make an appointment with a therapist.  If you have a job/insurance there is often an employee assistance line you can call where they will help set up the appointment and cover the cost of the first 5-10 sessions.  Now filling time...  Exercise, exercise, exercise.  Look on Groupon for a new hobby to try.  Go on Meetup.com and find new people to meet and spend time with.  Eat healthy foods.  Practice self love and self care.  You're going to be OK.  And, as someone who is 40, newly divorced (for a second time), and moving on with his life.  You're going to be OK.  Life doesn't end at divorce, even if you're Catholic."

Right now, you don't need to feel guilty about not feeling OK right now. It's perfectly rational for you to feel afraid. That means you're human :)  With time, you'll be able to think about and figure out your new future. But for right now, you need to push those thoughts aside and concentrate on the current moment. What are you going to do in the next few minutes? Gradually extend that time frame that you think about in the days, weeks and months ahead.  It's about re-claiming your future slowly and not all at once. It'll help with the panic.

Divorce,3dytrr,Kittenlove81,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"Marriages are definitely work to keep them healthy.  The work can be difficult at times.  But you shouldn't feel exhausted from being the only one who is willing to do the work.  An analogy I use often for marriage is it is like two people sitting in a rowboat together.  The only way the boat can get anywhere is if both people are willing to work together and row.  If only one person is willing to do any work, the boat can only go in circles.  You definitely need counseling for your marriage.  Your husband also needs to see a counselor about the root sources of his depression.  Using pot while suffering from depression is not a good idea at all.  The problems you're struggling with sound very, very fixable.  I would not suggest considering divorce yet.  However, you do need to have some very direct conversations with your husband (with the help of a counselor) to let him know how his behavior is affecting the marriage.  If, after going through that process, he is still unwilling to work on your marriage, then you have a much different problem.  Substance abuse is a difficult issue to overcome for many marriages."

Here's the problem.  Your solution to the issues is for him to change so that the issues go away.  You can't change other people.  All you can change is yourself.  He is who he is and he isn't going to change.  If who he is is who you want to be with, then you're going to have to change yourself to be ok with who he is.  If he isn't who you want to be with, then you already have your answer.  If you're not willing to change yourself to accept who he is, then you already have your answer."

A lot of people get married thinking ""If I find the right person, I'll be happy because if I marry the right person it will just work.""  There is a very good chance that your husband just hasn't realized yet what you're struggling to realize: marriages aren't something you can set on cruise control.  Can he change the fact that he's an introvert or extrovert?  No.  Can he learn to pick up his underwear off the floor? Absolutely.  Can he change the fact that he struggles with depression? No.  (But he can get better at managing it)  Can he change his behavior with regards to learning what it means to make his marriage a priority? Absolutely.  The questions are: Is he willing to do whats necessary to make his marriage a priority?  Are you willing to love him through that while he figures it out?"
Divorce,3dytrr,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:01 2015 UTC,All good caveats. I don't think he feels he needs to change anything about his lifestyle choices for me or for the kids.

You'll start your own path of recovery, become stronger and healthier, and begin to put your life back together.

Divorce,3dyepv,Ineffably_Sublime,5,Mon Jul 20 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it all sounds like perfectly normal behavior to me.  The counselor's comments are probably just a ""covering the bases"" comment, not based on anything that Mom told him to say.  It is pretty much ""Co-Parenting 101"" to encourage open communication between both parents and the kids.  As young as your kids are, they're going to want to be with the parent they're with at that moment, and they're going to miss the parent they're not with.  Since it sounds like they're with their Mom during the weeks, it is pretty normal for them to not want to go back to her right away.  Weekends can lend a certain ""we just got here!"" feel to them when the visitation is over."

Divorce,3dyepv,kizdog,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"My kids (11,9,7) do the same thing. They come to my house, have fun, run in from their mom's car shouting ""Bye"". When I take them back, I get out of the car and walk them to the door. They hug me, act sad, hug me again, generally text me that night. I get them every other week.   I don't know what the difference is. I haven't really pried. I just accept it. I do ask them if they had fun at mom's and what kind of activities they did. That is about the extent of it.   I wouldn't worry too much unless they tell you something alarming, you notice something out of the ordinary (loss of appetite, insomnia, etc). Since you know they are going to counseling, I'd get involved. If you can make it to the next session, talk the therapist. She may have blindsided you with that, but of all things to blindside you, therapy for the kids is likely the most mild.   ...and be happy they enjoy your company! It means you are doing something right. With some of the horror stories I hear about piss-poor dads, it is great to hear a story of a dad that enjoys his kids - and whose kids enjoy him!"
Divorce,3dyepv,Arcades,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:10:36 2015 UTC,"Have you asked them about their time spent living with their mother?  My sons (9 and 5) are typically tight lipped about anything bad going on because they already have an awareness of the sensitivities of the situation.  I usually get that it's ""fine"", but on occasion things will slip out (that Mom never takes them anywhere or that they get bored, etc).  However, early on they were very demonstrative anytime they had to visit their mother (sometimes very good, sometimes very bad) because they were adapting to this new dynamic and it was hard for them because the routine was brand new (I have them full time, she sees them every 3rd weekend and one month out of the summer because she moved away to be with her new husband).  It took my boys about 8 months to fully adjust.  It's not clear from your post how long they have been shuttling back and forth, but it might simply be an adjustment period where they act out because they don't know how to articulate all of their emotions and thoughts.  But, sitting the 8 and 6 year old down and asking about their time at their mother's isn't prying into details you're not entitled to.  As long as you keep it about them, I think it's fair game.  Just realize that they are at an age where they can pick up on tensions between Mom and Dad, so try to keep it as neutral or fact-based as possible.  You're finding your balance, too.  It's difficult not knowing what is going on with your kids every day, but if your ex was a good mother before the divorce, assume she is a good mother after the divorce and count on her to raise them just as well as you do."
Divorce,3dyepv,Arcades,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  The children have been doing this for the three months we have been divorced.  Yes you're right in that I am also finding the balance of how to handle this.  I do talk to the children,  they are tight lipped most of the time, and so I don't pry, I just make sure they know they can tell me anything and that I love them.  As far as their mother being a good parent.  That is more difficult for me.  She seems to love them and I don't think she would ever abuse them, but from the moment we had our first child she has had difficulty spending time with them.  I found out after we had our first that she has always wanted a career and did not want children.  She doesn't handle it well when the children touch her she doesn't want them ""hanging on"" her, and will get frustrated and shout at them when they don't giver her her space.  Had I known this before we had children I would have never had children with her.  Honestly I was surprised when she didn't want to give me full custody."
Divorce,3dyepv,47omek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds a lot like my situation.  I always loved kids growing up -- did the whole babysitting thing, worked in a daycare (just to be around kids), etc.  My ex loved to take the kids out to do stuff, such as go to a movie or a car show, but when we were confined to the house I was always the one to play with them; be it sports or made up games.  Both my own mother (I'm a child of divorced parents) and my ex seem to be going through an adjustment where they immediately focus on their own life first and foremost and then (hopefully) find their motherly instincts again down the road.  I can tell you that it took me awhile to reconnect with my Mom because of this.  Luckily, your kids are much younger and probably somewhat oblivious to the choices your ex is making.  All you can do is maximize the effort you put in on your half; give them the best damn life you can, and then keep your eyes and ears open for anything untoward happening on the other half, but don't go looking for trouble.  It sounds like you're on the right track and your kids are going through normal kid things.  Just continue to be there for them and things will normalize eventually."
Divorce,3dyepv,47omek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:45 2015 UTC,Couple things:  1)  You don't have 50/50 custody - sounds like you have joint legal (common in Texas) and most likely Texas Expanded Standard parenting time.  Do you get them Thurs-Mon or just Fri-Sun?  If so you're at something like 59 her 41 you.  2)  If you have joint legal in Texas then the mother can't just take the children to a therapist without your consent - non-emergency medical and psychiatric care should be agreed upon and you're entitled to be informed about and attend these sessions.  Did you find out from the children while having never been informed by the mother?  If so the mother is likely in contempt and you would be wise to nip this type of behavior in the bud (in writing to leave a paper trail for any potential legal action).  The counselor's line of questioning smells of the mother trying to build a parental alienation case against YOU as opposed to tackling the real issues with the mother's coldness toward the children that you pointed out in your later comments.  Be wary.  3) Just curious and feel free to ignore - it sounds like you didn't fight for true 50/50 or primary and instead ceded primary to the mother who you yourself describe as poorly equipped to be a good parent.  Why?
Divorce,3dyepv,47omek,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"1) Texas Joint legal  Fri - Sun and Thursday during the school year.  2)Agreed this is what pissed me off.  Can I nip this without a lawyer, or do I need one?  3)Because I was an idiot, and thought doing a divorce without a lawyer was a good idea.  I didn't want to drag the children through an extended custody battle and was under the impression that Joint custody in Texas was essentially 50/50  Grammar edit"
Divorce,3dyepv,47omek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"1)  OK it sounds like you only have the Standard Possession order, not Expanded Standard possession which would give you from school release on Thursday until school dropoff on Monday morning during the school year.  Expanded Standard is the rebuttable presumption in Texas and the non-custodial parent basically need only ask for it and not be a convicted psychopath and it would have been granted at time of divorce.  This was a major mistake agreeing to standard and not going for expanded standard, losing 2-3 overnights per month with your children during school year.  Need to find out how to fix that.  2)  Don't need a lawyer - send your ex two letters, one via US First Class postage and the other Return Receipt Requested informing her that she is required to inform you of all medical appointments in advance and that you do not consent to your child seeing any counselor until such time as you and ex can discuss the matter.  Send another letter to the counselor informing them that they do not have your consent to see your children as required by Texas joint legal custody and they are not to see them further until such time as you explicitly give your consent.  You need to establish your boundaries ASAP with such a fresh divorce and let the ex know she can't just violate the decree at will.  If ex continues to take them without your consent after this communication you would then have a potential case for contempt.  3)  You got some bad information and fell on your sword like alot of guys.  This doesn't have to be permanently fatal, though.  Go to forum.mensdivorce.com and post the particulars of your situation and they can help you build a gameplan if you desire a greater parenting time share and influence in the raising of your children.  What I've given you is just a tiny fraction of the wealth of experience and knowledge that many of your fellow divorced dads there possess."
Divorce,3dyepv,troubledtimez,3,Mon Jul 20 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"Upon more research this evening  I compared the possession order that the judge signed (standard possession order) compared to my copy that I had from when we were filling out the paper work.  My copy of what we filled out when doing the paper work shows extended possession.  Apparently she used my information and signature sheet, and changed those pages of the possession order to show only standard possession.  That is what the judge signed.  I never had a chance to see them again until I was standing in front of the judge.  And at that point I didn't take the time to re read through the possession order while standing there.    I got fucked because I thought I could do it without a lawyer and I trusted my STBX.  I'm a moron.  The moral of the story is GET A FUCKING LAWYER!  Gonna be sending her the letters both for the counseling of the children without my consent, and enrolling them in school without even informing me.  It is clear she is violating the possession order.  Now I just wonder if there is anything I can do to get extended custody."

Divorce,3dwlgh,Catcherofsouls,3,Mon Jul 20 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"My stbx hid an affair from me, and blamed me for the breakdown of the marriage. Said I didn't communicate, I changed, etc. Strange that when I found out about her affair, everything she said I did was just her projecting herself onto me. But hey, whatever makes you sleep at night.  Just like /u/ZA_SDK says, if she had come to me and said she wanted out of the marriage, or said she cheated right after she did, I would have made the split as amicable as possible. That time has passed, so I've dug in my heels and won't blink regarding our divorce."

Training their professional clergy to focus on the exact wrong things about Christianity.  ""It's better to look/act perfect on the outside than it is to pursue Christ's teachings on the inside.""  Pathetic.  Then they wonder why the rest of the world's religions and non-believers scoff at their efforts to be moral leaders."

You've never heard of Protestant Pastors sleeping with married members of their flock? Or making millions on the tithes of the faithful have you... Like those mega churches in Texas?   I've run into both priests and pastors who believe it's better to look perfect/act perfect on the outside then be truly faithful to the religion.   The fact that you're calling one group pathetic when yes there are faults, and things were handled wrong, but rather then condemn a specific group... Maybe you should look at the positives."

Secrets eat away at your souls and it changes the person that you are.   Part of the thrill of an affair is holding onto the safety and security of your primary relationship while also experiencing the thrill of the new.  The secret-keeping is part of the draw, in other words.  Not everyone who has an affair wants out of their relationship, and telling your spouse about the affair means risking your security. Most cheaters want their cake and to eat it, too, rendering the ""tell your partner if you're having an affair"" a nice fantasy in an ideal world, but not very realistic."

She has moved on already.  She is in the process of dumping you.  She doesn't want to be the 'bad guy', so she is trying to get you to be the one to initiate it.  I know this because this is how my marriage ended.  She had been cheating and sex tapered off to once every other month or so, sometimes longer.  I can remember reaching over to snuggle on her in bed, and she said that she felt like she was being pressured for sex.  And all I offered was non-sexual affection.  I remember her excuses to see her lovers.  They all seemed so innocent and if I objected, I would be seen as controlling, non-trusting and immature.  She wove just enough truth into her narrative that it was hard to untangle it to find the truth and the lies as separate.  1) build up your support network.  you'll need it when the divorce happens.  2) figure out how you will single parent when the divorce happens.  Is your job secure?  How will childcare figure into it?  3) Learn how divorce works where you live.  How can it be accomplished with the least amount of conflict?  4) Do every thing you can to reduce conflict when you separate.  She will be in love with someone else, she may even bring the other guy around to meet your son.  There is little that you can do about that.  Your goal is to raise a son who understands right from wrong, with generosity of spirit.  If you present the unvarnished truth to him, he may feel that he needs to pick a side.  You don't want him to  be forced to do this.  Your wife doesn't respect you.  But she may well love your son.  And your son deserves to love and be loved by both his parents.  You have some painful months ahead.  I'm sorry for you.  I had them, but I made it through.  You will too."

That's the only reason I'm not totally convinced she's cheating.  That would be pretty fast work.  She has a new job and she's been spending a lot of time working.    But, her history suggests otherwise.  And like I said, even if she's not, her willingness to throw it all away and not work on it even though I've done nothing worthy of divorce terrifies me.

Breaking up is hard, getting a divorce is even harder as you invested significant time, energy and money to make it work. Keep your head up- as you mentioned, you have a lot going for you if it does end up divorce.  The worst part of divorce is how it affects the kids and the complexity of the financial part.  Seems like those are non-issues.  Once you do file for divorce (which starts the separation period, at least in the US), then I would recommend not living together.  In CA, you have 6 months prior to anything becoming final.  Take that time to clear your mind and detach yourself emotionally from the situation. If you feel happier being away and dread interacting with the other during that time, then a divorce is the right thing.  On the other hand, if you regret moving out and are able to see some positive changes from therapy, then you can hold off on finalizing things.  I think you get up to 2 years to make the divorce final, so make sure you use that time productively."

Take that time to clear your mind and detach yourself emotionally from the situation.   I think to a large extent that's already happened - I don't feel so emotionally invested in things any more, almost as if we are just going through the motions as we make our way to an inevitable conclusion.   If you feel happier being away and dread interacting with the other during that time, then a divorce is the right thing.

Very introspective of you.  I don't know i have a solution to your problem but your problem is not uncommon. You probably even know what you need to do. People don't fall in love with bodies, they fall in love with the individual inside those bodies.

Focus on being able to get a job or a better one and being able to provide a better life for yourself. Maybe it salvages what you have here, maybe not.

Divorce,3dvqjv,Choirdrunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"No, I have to completely admit that this has been my fault.  I've started this off by having having general ""issues"" when I moved across here (I'm really not a great big risk-taker, and I kept flopping between  being absolutely ecstatic and having panic attacks), which unfortunately for me tends to lead to, frankly, porn.  Since then, I've personally let stress and fear get the better of me; too much snapping, too much bickering, and too much bad decision making.  As I said, I've already cut down my drinking considerably.  I don't drink spirits except for the occasional neat drink (1, 2 times a month).  I may have a beer for taste, and if it's a social thing I'll tap out at 4.  It's not a complete cut out, but the problem has never been about needing to completely cut it out: it's been about how drunk I could get by the end of a night.  There hasn't been a major issue for a year now, but things have gotten steadily worse due to minor things and her distancing herself from me.  We've done counseling twice (the first one quit to persue his writing career after a month, and the 2nd one just wasn't helping anyone.  my wife doesn't think seeing a 3rd one will be beneficial), she's been seeing a therapist herself for something like 6 years (who I'll be honest, I don't trust that she has the best interest of our marriage in mind, and perhaps not even the best for my wife), and while I've been trying during this time it's also been hard because she's been building a wall up against me and yeah that stings.  There's just so many factors at work that I can't tell what is from what.  In the same year she's had a falling out with her best friend since childhood, her parents have split and both moved out of the area, she's had her own issues with pot (at one point smoking over £400 a month) both in using and trying to periodically quit, her job of the last 5 years sucks, and money is tight.  I've lost my job at the end of last month (though, knock on wood, I will have a role in a new office by the end of this one), and was told that she saw that as a sign:  it was less of a hurt to cut me off and send me off with nothing if it wasn't also making me lose a paycheck.  At the moment I'm trying for time.  I don't know if it's too late; I don't want to admit it is, but objectively I have to keep the possibility.  I've made a commitment to doing everything in my power from now on, for what it's worth.  I'm giving her as much space as I can, but we live together with no alternatives to move out.  Splitting up also isn't ""simple"", as in this case it will legally force me to leave the country (with, I fear, the possibility of being permanent) with absolutely nothing to fall back on.  We're in a hard place.  Neither one of us is certain of what can be done, or what will happen.  Neither one of us wants things to end, let alone so completely."

Divorce,3dvg23,ZA_SDK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:02 2015 UTC,"The reality is that you love your kids and she loves your kids.  You can't control what she tells the kids, but whatever you do and as hard as it is at times, don't lower yourself to her level and talk badly about her.  The kids will understand that ""mommy is always saying bad things about daddy"" and that ""daddy doesn't say bad things about mommy.""  They will remember who treated the other parent with respect and caring and which one had nothing but bad things to say about the other.  The parent who is constantly talking negatively about the other is going to lose with the kids in the end.  The kids see that X parent is always talking badly about Y parent when all the kids know is that they love both of you.  It puts them into the middle of the divorce when they have no business being involved in it.   I'm far from perfect in this regards.  Sometimes a little smart ass comment comes out of my mouth without thinking.  But, I do my best to talk her up to the kids....how much she loves them.....how much she misses them....how much fun they'll have when they are with her.  I don't know if it is simply a coincidence, or if it's because I've tried to talk her up, but my relationship with my kids has gotten so much better over the past 6-7 months.  One thing my therapist keeps reminding me is..... you don't want to be the parent who talks badly about the other."

I want to negotiate a settlement that includes shared parenting and repays the kids for his gambling losses by setting up a college savings account for them. I don't want alimony,  I will need child support (he makes a lot more than I do ) to help with raising our 3 kids. He says he won't move out of the house and would rather I leave.  I understand that but I want to keep the kids in the house. They are very comfortable here. For our 2 younger children,  this is the only home they have ever known. I know he is anxious about losing time with the kids. He travels a lot for work and he is not the primary caregiver of our kids. I don't understand why he prefers litigation to collaboration.

Obviously,  when he's not home I have 100% of the child care. When we had our only meeting with our attorneys to work on our collaborative agreement,  he broke down and cried that he didn't feel that he could manage 50% custody.  I know that even when he is home he  has days where he has early morning meetings or has to work late and is not able to take the kids to school or pick them up from aftercare.  I wanted to keep the kids in the house and take turns living there but he is opposed to that.

Once I pulled the trigger those thoughts of being scared of change, and thinking the person was going to do something harmful to you were already dealt with, at least a pretend version of it.  I am not suggesting you do this, just stating how I did it. I was already numb to the situation so when it came time to do it, mentally I was already miles away from the finish line..

Divorce,3dumjw,megisemo,3,Sun Jul 19 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"I know you're extremely hurt, but part of you realizes this is more symbolic than practical.  I'm assuming you're staying in the marital home during this period of pre-divorce separation, so your residence is being paid for by marital funds.  As such, he has a right to have his paid for by marital funds.  Think of it from your perspective:  You could save money by living with him while the divorce is pending, but that could mean at least 6 more months of living with this man.  What's worth more to you?  Your independence and sanity as you begin to prepare for the next chapter of your life, or a couple of months of rent and a security deposit?  I can't answer that question for you, but I have a strong guess at the answer.  Furthermore, does he even have non-marital assets?  Until the divorce is finalized, any salary he brings in, absent an agreement between the two of you is marital funds."
Divorce,3dumjw,Arcades,2,Sun Jul 19 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"Define what you mean by ""marital money."" If it's money that was acquired and collected during the marriage, then he has a right to it as well and a right to make use of it. I'm certain that the money he spends on his separate address will count against his portion of that money, but yes, if there's not enough marital funds to maintain the existing debts, then it's probably not possible. If there's excess funds, though, he probably has a right to use it, though I think what he uses would be deducted from his portion of it. That's my thought, anyway."

I think there is a misconception that we get to dictate what our ex's can and can't do if it involves our kids. My lawyer said no. Unless safety is involved, no. For example, I would really prefer that my kids not spend time with the (insert every expletive here) women that my husband has been cheating on me with. My lawyer said, I don't get to dictate that. I have no reason to think she is dangerous or would harm the kids. I just think she is a piece of shit.   Again, these things do seem to really be impacted by your state. I live in a no fault state. We can't even go in filing for full custody. My lawyer said all divorces start at 50/50 and negotiations happen from there. Which is interesting considering my husband works in another state. I would love to see how he plans to work 50/50 custody being gone 5 days of every week. But that's another rant...don't get me started. ;-)"
Divorce,3dsoe2,aerynsun,2,Sun Jul 19 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"My comments were talking about a situation pre divorce and a piece of community property.   I was referring to a house that I assumed was being sold as part of the estate settlement. And while I think is is unreasonable to try to prevent your kids from spending time with your husbands girlfriend, I do think it is reasonable to keep her (the floozy) from moving into a house that is being sold as part of an estate settlement when that house is community property. edit Just to be clear, OP needs to talk to his attorney about this.  And since his ex wants to refer to this arrangement as a landlord/renter arrangement, most landlords control who occupies a rental requiring all adult occupants to sign a lease."

Divorce,3dsoe2,aerynsun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:57:28 2015 UTC,My lawyer would have said it's my choice to move out if I don't want someone else staying there I should stay in the home until the divorce is final and the home sold.
Divorce,3dsoe2,toasterchild,0,Sun Jul 19 14:21:28 2015 UTC,"@albertnacht. Thank you. This describes my situation and my attitude about it pretty close to perfectly. I really do fully understand I have no right to stop my wife from seeing who she wants. In fact, she is away with this person this weekend and we she left, I told her to have a good time. But that doesn't mean I should be required to allow this person to use my property. If I was a landlord and he came to me on his own and applied to rent my property, I would be totally within my rights not to do business with him. At least that's how it seems to me. But I'm happy to be educated otherwise."
Divorce,3dsoe2,albertnacht,3,Sun Jul 19 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"legal rights are (as I understand them not being a lawyer) 1) you have a legal right to protect your property interests. 2) you do not have a legal right to control who your ex associates with or lives with. 3) your children have a legal right to a safe environment.     you can not go to your attorney and request that your STBX never see her lover, but you can go to your attorney and request reasonable things around the selling of the house as part of a temporary order (limits on occupancy, house is to be placed on the market on such and such date, house is to be vacated by such and such date, STBX is to provide so much per month toward the mortgage (a mutual obligation) until the house is sold and reasonable conditions on accepting an offer for the house).     (and by the way, in most states and cities, a landlord can not decide arbitrarily to reject a tenant, there has to be some sort of factual reason like bad credit, etc).  Good luck"

Divorce,3dsoe2,kipela,3,Sun Jul 19 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"Share the house like we did. On my time with my son, I had the house, and vice versa. It keeps you both in the house, but importantly your kids too. It worked for the most part for us, I was able to start packing and organising my things also."
Divorce,3dsoe2,scurvy_durvy,0,Sun Jul 19 03:50:19 2015 UTC,Where did you and your spouse go when it wasn't your time? Did you each also have separate homes?
Divorce,3dsoe2,albertnacht,2,Sun Jul 19 03:58:33 2015 UTC,We would go to our parents houses. Unfortunately that isnt an option for some. All the best mate.
Divorce,3dsoe2,albertnacht,3,Sun Jul 19 04:42:28 2015 UTC,"OP why are you paying for the house, and how long until you two plan on selling it?"
Divorce,3dsoe2,scurvy_durvy,0,Sun Jul 19 04:35:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not paying for the whole thing, but I need to carry part of it because my income is a lot larger than hers and she can't afford to carry it on her own. For me, it's a better option financially than defaulting and losing the house. We need to have it sold by next spring at the latest. Hopefully it will be sold within the next few months. All of these plans are tentative, anyway. We haven't really negotiated spousal or child support yet and how we'll divide the cost of the house. But this is how it looks at the moment."
Divorce,3dsoe2,Karissa36,3,Sun Jul 19 04:47:45 2015 UTC,Why is she not actively looking for a cheaper place of her own?  with some sort of timeline to vacate the house?
Divorce,3dsoe2,fatheroftwoboys,0,Sun Jul 19 13:24:38 2015 UTC,"It is -- as I'm sure all of our situations are -- complicated.  Our plans in terms of who lives in the house are tentative and are ultimately likely to be negotiated alongside spousal support/child support, etc. She will also be looking for a place of her own and -- assuming that we stick with the tentative plan for her to stay in the house -- she will have until it's sold to vacate. But that's likely to take a few months at the least.  She will need a large enough place for the kids to be with her most of the time. And it would be a heavy burden on our combined incomes for us each to have our own place plus a separate mortgage to carry. So it probably makes sense for her to move later, when we're closer to selling."
Divorce,3dsoe2,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:09:38 2015 UTC,"It makes sense only as long as you are ok with paying for both a large chunk of the mortgage on her house as well as rent/mortgage  for yourself, but I question that mindset of ""our combined incomes"", you have your income  and your STBX has hers.     The mortgage on this house has nothing to do with determining your child support obligations/spousal support.  All it does is put you in debt for a house that you do not live in."
Divorce,3dsoe2,Daemon42,3,Sun Jul 19 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"I see. then really it's just the emotional impact. That's tough, and I understand, but it is her life now.  Same as if she didn't want you dating someone else."
Divorce,3dsoe2,bradbrookequincy,3,Sun Jul 19 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"This depends a lot on what State you live in.  In many States you can get an order that until the divorce is final neither parent will have an unrelated guest of the opposite sex staying overnight with the children present.  Note carefully that the reasoning is the best interests of the children who are going through a traumatic time, not ""I don't want some sleazeball living in MY house""."

Divorce,3dqso3,havendrop,4,Sat Jul 18 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a past participant and a former table leader at our church. Served for a few years there.   I agree with /u/someguywhoneedshelp, if you have no interest in spiritual growth or development, the faith aspect may be distracting for you.   Unfortunately, it sounds like his church group did a very poor job of training their table leaders. One of the fundamental principles of DC is it is supposed to be a supportive and safe environment. That means spouse bashing or one person dominating the discussion is not supposed to happen.  Your table leader is supposed to be there to guide that. If they are trained and experienced, they will do that.   As far as whether or not you will get anything out of it, that is up to you. It's like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it.   I was surprised at how much I got out of it when I went through it. I was almost 10 years post divorce and remarried when I did it, so I was initially thinking I would be helping others more than being helped. I couldn't have been more wrong, but for that I am grateful.   I would suggest at least giving it a try for 2-3 weeks, even if you are not interested in the religious aspect. There are still many healthy ideas shared, and connecting with people in a similar place in life is very helpful."

My main complaint is it turned into one guy just bitching about his ex, and not very therapeutic. This guy was going to be there for a while, and I didn't want to hear his complaints every time I went.   I also subscribed to their mailing list. The tips were okay for the first few weeks. Then I got the advice that the only way I could truly get over my divorce was to turn to Jesus. Instant unsubscribe.  The leaders were friendly, but I think you'll get as much out of it as you will here. The difference is do you want face to face, or will an Internet forum suffice?"

All I can say is it gets easier in time. For now, a simple ""we're actually getting divorce..."" and a change of conversation ""look, squirel"" will do. If that change in conversation doesn't work, then ""i don't want to talk about it"" should.  Remember that talking about your divorce can be therapeutic, but can be overwhelming to others.

Divorce,3dpacv,enervatedme,6,Sat Jul 18 03:37:05 2015 UTC,"I assume you're using plural to mask gender, not a poly situation?  No, two people cannot heal with contact.  Particularly sexual intimacy.  As much as people want to try to say sex is a physical act, it is shown time and time again that there is as much an emotional connection to the act as physical, if not more.  You're just throwing yourself off the same cliff every time you do it."

Ha.  This is mainly the argument that I read against it. But I'm not ignoring that there is no emotional connection. That's I think part of the main reason it's so comforting. I love this person, it's emotional. I don't think it's just physical.  We both know we don't want the marriage as it was, and we are both grieving the loss of what we thought our marriage was going to be. We almost kind of seem like perfect partners in grief."
Divorce,3dpacv,abloodyminge,3,Sat Jul 18 04:05:40 2015 UTC,"I understand and totally believe that no contact helps with the healing process. Band-aid and all.

Can we still get a little action with someone we love, while we work on discovering our lives as single people, not having to worry about filling the lonely up with random strange or rebounds?   I did this. I kept falling into bed with my ex for months after we started the divorce process. (Seriously my new year resolution was to not fuck my ex). It was difficult, was actually the best sex we had in forever. But it messed with both of our heads and it wasn't healthy.   When you are trying to heal from the damage of the other person, NO you cannot heal with that kind of contact.    No, you cannot be their support. That isn't your job anymore. You need time and distance to get over them, and they need the same from you. The problem is you love this person, sex for all intents and purposes, releases those happy chemicals and associates the memories. This is no bueno.   This may come as a surprise, but you do not need to go out and bang someone new right away, all that is doing is helping you avoid the problem. I feel bad, I should fuck my feelings away doesn't work forever, eventually it will either be right back where you are now, or feel worse.

My hurt is so deep (combined with his infidelity before)- we don't communicate at all.  Ever.

Divorce,3dny3n,StuffaYouFace,9,Fri Jul 17 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"I have found that as a recently divorced, over 46 yo female, that it was actually my friends, family, and even people I didn't even know who were pushing the ""meet someone new"" thing and I had no interest whatsoever in such a thing.    I just existed and worked on fixing my life. There was no room in my head or my physical space for another human being. Even the people trying so hard to help me get over it were muted by my own chatter.   As I pulled myself together I noticed that I like me and I was and am pretty proud of me and my ability to survive and clean up a mess.  A mess that by all accounts was done ""to"" me.  While most people tell me I did nothing wrong in my marriage, I know and have come to terms with, my own particular responsibility for what happened.  We BOTH messed up.  There was no cheating, by the way, to or by either one of us.  It was something else that tore my marriage apart.    After about a year, I joined OK Cupid on the advice of a friend who said ""Just use it to learn how to talk to strangers, at least.  You have no idea how things work out there anymore.  Not just for dating, but in general social situations.""  And she was right.    I met quite a few people in the 8 months I was on there. Some great experiences, some terrible ones.  It was exhausting, because dealing with other human beings on any level is work.  But the key was, I always reminded myself that I was in control of me and my life, and I could back off or go forward with it according to me and what I wanted.  This is not to say that I strung anyone along or made them suffer my matchy matchy set of luggage while I figured it out.  What I mean is, I didn't have to do anything I wasn't comfortable with at any time.  And I could turn off the profile and the interaction when I wanted to.    And the more I focused on cleaning up my own life and being ok with my part in the mess, the more social I found I wanted to be.  I still wasn't looking for a relationship.    And a funny thing happened.  Right about the time I had had enough of OK Cupid and was going to delete the profile, I ended up messaging someone. He had done a drive by of my profile a few times without reaching out, so I figured I'd burn that bridge on my own terms and I messaged him.  Never thought I'd get a response, but I did.  And we are currently dating and I am ridiculously happy.  Is it healthy?  Who knows?  All I can tell you is that I feel good about me and the relationship as it is today, right now.  I wasn't looking for it, it happened.  But I could have walked away if I wanted to.  I didn't and don't want to.    Try not to apply any formula or expectations to your post-divorce life as far as lots of things, but specifically, when to meet someone new or by when you are ""over it."" Just do what you do to make yourself happy, on your terms, and one of these days you might look up to see someone you like a whole lot standing there in front of you.    You've got plenty of time. Late 30s is nothing, kid.  Try being a single 44 (now 46) yo female out there.  If I HAD been actively trying to hook up, I would have been devastated by many of my interactions (or lack of after the age was established) with people.  And I'm not going to go on and bitch about ageism, because I admit freely that even I screened out men past a certain age myself while on line.  It's just something BOTH sexes do, at ALL ages.  Is it ""wrong""?  Probably.  But it made me happy at the time so I did it."
Divorce,3dny3n,yellingatthesun,3,Fri Jul 17 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely great advice!  I'm new to the whole single life thing.  We've been ""separated"" for 6 months, but really it's only been done for about 6 weeks.  There was severe cheating involved (not on my part) and my ex has been seeing several guys since the beginning of Jan & one since Oct 2014 -  so I tried to force myself to find a woman.  I did.  A very attractive one at that.  I went against my counselors advice and I tried so hard to make something of it.  But I knew it was nothing to me.  She was looking for more from me than ""fun"", and I was in no place for anything serious....I'm still not.  Eventually, it settled in with me..... whether she is dating/screwing/whatever - that does not mean that I need to be.  I don't want a one night stand, I want a long term relationship with someone I care deeply about.  So, I've finally made the decision to work on me.  And it's been better than expected.  I'm getting myself figured out before I even think about a woman."

That would be great though."
Divorce,3dny3n,AwesomeScreenName,3,Sat Jul 18 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"I think we all (the world, not us specifically here per se) have to let go of this idea that relationships have to ""stick"" in order for us to have been successful at it.  It is certainly nice (and easier) when there is consistency and the absence of the frustrating and exhausting parts of being single and starting to date.  No denying that.  I didn't have children by choice and I have no idea what you single parents are going through. My heart goes out to you though, because that has to be so beyond the difficult I can hear in the words written on the screen.  I also tend to think we are so used to technology making it easier to find what we need when we need it in every aspect of life, that we have a hard time dealing with it when that ease and higher satisfaction rate does not materialize in finding a person to spend time with/date.   It's the same as it has always been.  A long, tough, sometimes shit paved road to travel on.   But we all keep going back there. To me, that is the important part.  The not giving up and the constant work towards getting something you want, despite all of the things that seem to be blocking the ease at which we think we could have it if it were only different."
Divorce,3dny3n,TheEarlShibe,3,Fri Jul 17 22:23:55 2015 UTC,I realized after my 10 year marriage ended that I needed the time to myself.  Its way to stressful to find and do it all over again.

Otherwise, go on your adventures, hang out, have fun, and let things happen organically.  Right now, at this point in your life, meeting people to date seems like work to you.  That's OK.

Divorce,3doxmy,soapydansk,2,Sat Jul 18 12:20:59 2015 UTC,"Heh.  Now I feel responsible!  I remember when I went on OKC.  I was not too long out of my marriage chronologically, but I had done a lot of work to get over it emotionally.  I mean, I was at the point where my therapist basically said ""Keep my number, make an appointment if you need it, but really -- there's no need to come here.  You're doing fine!""  And then various of my friends told me to get out there and date, and I thought ""Well, I haven't dated in 20 years.  I know I'm going to screw this up, I might as well start making my mistakes now instead of waiting.""  So I set up an OKC profile.  It worked pretty well for me.  I messaged some ladies in my area who looked interesting.  Some wrote back.  Most didn't.  I got some unsolicited messages from ladies.  Most were reasonable attempts to start conversations.  A few weren't.  I actually wound up being on OKC for a very short time.  After meeting one woman who seemed fine, but we just didn't click, and then a second woman who was so dull she makes dishwater seem exciting, I wound up going out with a woman who seemed really cool and on the same wavelength as me.  So we went on a second date.  And a third.  And that was back in November and I'm still seeing her regularly.  I wound up having to move halfway across the country in April and we've been doing the long-distance thing since then.  Maybe I won the lottery, getting a good relationship so quickly -- but then again, after my terrible marriage, I kind of deserve it!  Is OKC a slaughterhouse?  It definitely can be.  There's a lot of messed up people out there, and a lot of them are dating online.  Definitely proceed with caution.  The reality is that anybody who is dating as of a certain age is only dating at that age because they've been through some damage.  Failed marriage, failed relationship, whatever -- they've been around the block.  Or they haven't, and past a certain age, that's it's own red flag!  So you need to start developing a radar for who has dealt with their damage in a healthy way and who hasn't.  One of my favorite quotes is from Hemmingway: ""The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places.""  But some aren't, and the trick is finding the ones who have turned their breaks into strengths.  That's true on OKC, that's true on match.com, that's true in real life.  I actually kind of miss answering those stupid OKC questions.  It was like one of those stupid Facebook quizzes the girl you knew in high school is always posting, only it could go on for as long as you wanted or as short as you wanted.  When I was on OKC and bored, I'd fire it up and answer a few questions, or browse through profiles and look at how other people answered."
Divorce,3doxmy,Daemon42,2,Sat Jul 18 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"OKC is definitely crazy, but my experience was good—not only did I not end up with any horror stories, but I unexpectedly met someone who is fantastic and has been a great part of my healing process, not because it's a relationship but because I caught a glimpse of all the healthy relationship things I was totally capable of and deserve, and that I was totally lacking in my marriage.  With the caveat that the online dating experience is very different for men than for women, it was nuts. After about a week I felt so overwhelmed and it was becoming such a time suck that I was already considering deactivating and taking a break."

People post profiles on there for criticism and I find it interesting as heck.  My opinion, don't assume what people have in their profiles is much truth, its a back story they polish to attract.  A reflection of truth likely.    Also after divorce #1, I used these sites.  Women on there be crazy.  I was always amazed at women who would offer private meeting (oh just swing by my house) for a first meeting.  Me, I'd insist on public place and normally park away from the door.  If I picked a crazy woman I wanted to remain somewhat anonymous - which turned out to be well over 1/2 the time.  Long way to say be smart about it, and good luck!!!

Talk to your therapist, they will tell you this same thing... your health and well being are what is most important.  You husband is very emotionally abusive and in some respects even gaslighting you.  Find a close friend, parents or family member.  Go to them for help and get away from this situation.  No room-mate situation will help this.  You need to leave him in all ways and work on yourself and self esteem.  Pack what you can and leave him.  No amount of councelling will help him or your marriage unless he's willing to truly help himself, which right now it doesn't sound like he is.  And again, the room-mate thing is a false fantasy.  You might hope it will work, but it will blow up in your face.    You need to leave him.  Go NC and get the help of your therapist.  You will be better off and a stronger woman in the end."

Deciding to get the divorce is a big decision.  My advice is if counseling doesn't help, it may be time to cut ties.  Abuse is unhealthy and I learned the hard way that the longer you stay in the relationship the more painful it is once your separated.  I went through one year of hell after the divorce.  He had robbed me of self confidence and pride.  Be safe and remember to put yourself first.  You don't have kids so it may be ""easier"" than if you had children involved in the situation.  Again, I had three and he ended up getting custody of them.  Be safe and remember your thoughts and feelings are what's most important."

I think a roommate situation would be a bad idea. This man has emotionally abused you for years. Living with him will allow it to keep going. Also if he's doing things in your sleep you never know if he may continue that behaviour.   It's also easier for him to play on your emotions this way.  Leaving someone is hard. Your credit may go down the toilet. You may be scared and have to do new things alone. The bright side of this is after a while you'll realize you're not the person he said you were. You'll find yourself again and in the end it will be worth whatever hardships you had to endure.  Also personal therapy is really important. It helped me see that I wasn't the problem,  and also helped me figure out why I kept picking men with the same qualities. I wish you the best of luck. It's a hard road but you can certainly get through."

Instead so many people let things slowly die, oh so slowly.  Your husband is talking with his actions and it's clear.  No more wondering on your part.

Divorce,3dntfp,Catcherofsouls,7,Tue Jul 21 17:37:56 2015 UTC,"During my first divorce a co-worker pulled me aside and said.  Your ex could absolutely hate the color yellow.  Can't stand it, can't be anywhere near it, can't have it in their life.  And you know, there's nothing you can do about that if you were born a canary.  The reason my first divorce ended was because I grew a spine and began enforcing important boundaries to me.  To my ex it was an overnight day/night change and I was the problem.  Why couldn't things go back to how they were?  And I had to look at her and say, ""They can't go back to the way they were, because I'm tired of hating myself for being that person.""  The reasons for divorce were, of course, much more complicated and ugly, but the reality was I needed things she couldn't provide and she needed me to be someone who I wasn't, and refused to become again.  You gave your ultimatum, this was key to your happiness and wellbeing, and they said no.  It isn't your fault if they can't handle that.  Sometimes people just hate ultimatums, these are usually the same people who refuse to go to personal therapy because they don't believe in it, or they firmly believe they are not the problem."

I was very honesty and in my opinion reasonable, and I know that my motives were pure. I certainly hadn't looked at it as an ultimatum, especially since I had room for compromise under the umbrella topic of the deal breaker, but I guess it was. I am ok with that reality, because I know that was true to myself and my own needs."

Here's how I addressed the issue myself:   meditation (including, but not limited to before bed/going to sleep) sunrise/sunset lamp - this helped making the waking up part slightly less traumatic a great wake up song for an alarm - something that reaffirms that I'm ok, everything will be ok, etc.   If it's getting to be too much and you aren't able to rest, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor.

Divorce,3dodjv,toasterchild,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:32:40 2015 UTC,"My husband and I tried marriage counseling. I didn't like the therapist from around the second session or so, as it seemed like she automatically dismissed a lot of my concerns, but we kept going bi-weekly for about six months. I tried to push through my dislike of her and her methods, dismissing it as just being a personal problem I shouldn't pay any attention to. But by the end of it, there was a clear pattern of her treating me vastly different than she treated my husband in the sessions (favoring him, interrupting me when I'd speak, excusing his behavior - including cheating on me - yet criticizing me for smaller missteps), which caused additional problems in our relationship that didn't exist before going to her. It got to the point where even if she was giving good advice, I'd automatically discount its value because her bias was so apparent.   My point in sharing my experience is that there are good therapists out there, but there are also bad ones. It's important you find someone you both agree upon and respect. If either you or your wife dislikes the therapist after a few sessions (for valid reasons, not just because they're calling you out on your shit and you don't want to hear it), you should try going to a different therapist. It's too easy to dismiss otherwise-good advice when you believe the therapist isn't being fair or is favoring one party over another."

In most states, adultery is incredibly hard to prove, and it doesn't really help much at all from a division of assets/spousal support aspect.  Usually all it provides is grounds for immediate divorce (waiver of any required waiting period to file for final decree).  Sorry to hear that your family has to go through this.  Try not to take sides.  As ugly as infidelity is, and as betraying as it sounds, try to remember that he's still your Dad and there are always two sides to every marriage.  Encourage your Mom and Dad both to seek counseling--individually first and together as a couple later on if they're willing.  Also encourage them to seek spiritual counseling if they are involved in a church."
Divorce,3dnqpz,Johnny_Soccer,2,Fri Jul 17 19:37:37 2015 UTC,It's a penalty for the early withdrawal of the funds plus het normal tax rate.  I am assuming she's not old enough to have done so without the penalty.   I'm not a cpa and it might be worth her going to one.
Divorce,3dnqpz,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:40:32 2015 UTC,Might want to check out /r/personalfinance and it's just as much as on your mom as it is the lawyer. Cashing out a 401k causes a 10% hit. She should have paid her regular tax amount PLUS the 10% hit. But it's def worth talking to a CPA.
Divorce,3dnqpz,rasconjon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"Your mom must be younger than 59 1/2, and she must have done this without the help of a CPA or tax professional.  Say what you want about ""it's expensive"" but I guarantee you a qualified tax professional would have cost less than $45,000.  Also, the part about the ""scumbag lawyer"" is pretty ridiculous, too.  Have you been to law school?  How long have you been practicing?   My point is, your Mom's lawyer is not a tax professional, he shouldn't have done anything to set up an account to minimize tax liability.  That's your Mom's responsibility to hire a tax professional to help with that.  The $300-$500 she would have spent on a CPA would have been money saved, because they would have advised her that it was a really, really bad idea to liquidate that account to buy a house."

Divorce,3dnqpz,Ijustneedanap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:39:48 2015 UTC,How soon after the divorce did she cash out the account?  I believe you only have 60 days to avoid the early withdrawal penalty.
Divorce,3dnqpz,JVorhees,0,Fri Jul 17 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"The 10% is a penalty. It's the same penalty anyone gets if they take money out of their 401k before they retire (as well as pay taxes since the money was not taxed in the first place).  She could have had the 401k complany transfer it into a standard bank account but they likely parked it into a retirement account first and she withdrew it from there. If the latter is the case, then that's why she got hit with the penalty."
Divorce,3dnqpz,JVorhees,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:45:20 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure my dad cashed out the 401k and then transfered the cash to my mom. Would my dad be responsible for the penalty tax, if this was the case?"
Divorce,3dnqpz,JVorhees,2,Fri Jul 17 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"It's more likely it was the result of something called a QDRO (Qualified Domestic Relations Order) which is the typical way 401k assets are handled in divorces. Since your mother got the bill for the 10% from the IRS, it's unlikely your dad had anything to do with it (the 401k company would have sent the info to the IRS).  Have your mom dig up the paperwork and call the 401k company. They'll probably be able to confirm that it went into an account they created for your mother with them then she withdrew it from there."
Divorce,3dnqpz,LaTuFu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"Also, have your mother call the IRS and explain the situation and see if the penalty can't be removed since she did not intend to transfer it into a retirement account.  IRS page on QDROs"
Divorce,3dnqpz,JVorhees,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"If he did it that way, the tax would have fallen on him.

Whatever was going on in her head, it's in her head.  It doesn't affect you.  She may have thought you were a bad husband.  It doesn't mean you were.  It means she thought you were.  She may have thought you were a CIA assassin, trained to kill Stalin as a contingency plan if he ever rises from the dead.  It doesn't mean you were.  It means she thought you were.  What she thought doesn't matter.  She's not part of your life any more.  Figure out who you really are, and don't worry about how someone who is not part of your life defines you.

You haven't given us details on why things ended, so I can't really say if she's empathetic or intelligent.  I will take your word that she is.  That doesn't mean she's omniscient.  That doesn't mean she doesn't make mistakes.  And that doesn't mean the choices she made for herself are necessarily reflective of your reality.  They are reflective of her reality.

Not very conducive to any kind of closure, and it sounds like you're still holding out hope for something that's not there anymore.  My time frame is different but I'm still processing something similar. It's difficult to reconcile the best friend and partner with the person who leaves without a satisfactory explanation. I don't know exactly how suddenly she told you she wanted a divorce, but for me it's been a process of realizing that, no, I don't need to reconcile the husband that I knew with this person that bails on a marriage: he was that person all along, I just didn't know it."

His wife got a new guy behind his back. She was so anxious to get him out of the house that she was willing to negotiate the divorce quickly. Regardless she may still ask for crazy stuff in the divorce but your negotiating power drops signifigantly if you move and take the pressure off. Live in your car?  Dude get real.  Find a lawyer who is not an instigator and who can keep you calm. Do not do anything ""dickish"" (let her waste her energy doing that).  Have your lawyer write up a seperation agreement thats maybe 20 percent more favorable to you. It should end up about even without a ton of drama. The person who drafts the seperation has the upper hand in my experience.  Your kids are just looking out for your mental health but the practical side is you need to negotiate a fair settlement and if you move you have less ability to negotiate. You can do extended time out of the house taking trips, visiting friends and kids but make it 100 percent clear you are not giving up residency in your home without a signed seperation agreement."

Well actually I wouldn't mind it but I'd want to have a space where our daughter could live with me if she wanted (had our kid late). I feel utterly stuck.   I don't have a degree either (it wasn't so important when we were young) and when I was unemployed for a while it was super clear that older people are the last choice for any job.   No real help here, but I wanted to let know know you have real sympathy.  Btw - maybe car living would be ok? There are sites and blogs of people who've made it work - even made it seem hip/cool - and saved a ton of money. Even if you had to buy a vehicle for it it's still cheaper than rent."

You've already admitted at least partially that he is a somewhat decent guy, and sounds like he's willing to work on things.  So the question is, what is it about you or your current circumstances that are making you think the marriage is the culprit?  Find that, you might find the key to crawling out of this darkness.  Note: I'm not saying or suggesting that this is all your fault, pity the poor man who is about to get crushed.  Quite the opposite, actually.

I made a lot of changes, lost 50bs, and started personal therapy (he repeatedly refused to try couples therapy with me). He has had a series of emotional affairs that he won't acknowledge, and after everything that's happened I just don't have any vulnerability left to show him.   So yah. That's what's been going on.   Edit: and by ""working on things"" he seems to mean buying me presents and complimenting me a lot, not actually starting/participating in substantial  conversations about our issues or doing therapy, which doesn't give me a lot of confidence that if I give up and agree to go back into the relationship that anything will actually change into what I need it to be.

The past year I've dropped about 50 pounds, can jog over 5 miles without stopping (NEVER did that before now), and feel a lot better about the way I look in the mirror now.  I have a job that I love despite the commute that I might not have gone after had I still been married. And they've been awesome with giving me the time to see my attorney.  I have primary custody of my sons, and just last week they told me they don't want overnight visits with their mother, so unless I'm at work or they are at school, for only 10 hours a month I won't have them. Wonderful!  I took up a hobby that I thought I could share with my stbx, but never got the chance. Now I think I get more out of it than she does. I've joined a few motorcycle clubs and go riding with them a few times a month. I play adult co-ed sports, something I thought was only for guys searching for their high school glory days.  I've also started working a list of mantras for myself that I read when I feel a little down to remind me why I am doing what I am doing.

I keep finding evidence of how unhappy I used to be, and how much better off emotionally I am now.   I'm financially so much more stable, and able to save and to plan, while still spending on fun and hobbies.  I used to have to decide between spending time with the ex or doing more with my life (he rarely  wanted to socialize or leave the house), now I go and do things guilt free,   I've started seeing someone fairly recently, and he's sweet and thoughtful, and we're so unbelievably compatible in bed, I had no idea it was possible!"

Divorce,3dkbwi,Fugsy,2,Fri Jul 17 10:50:51 2015 UTC,"I've been divorced officially for a year, and the marriage has been over for two years.   She was a hypochondriac with a victim complex that blew all of our money on ""woo woo"" medical expenses.   I had to stop paying my student loans to cover her expenses -- I had paid on time for 7 years.   She didn't want to have kids because she didn't want to pass on her imagined condition/thought that maybe a family member might have assaulted her when she was little and she can't remember so she'd never be able to trust the kid alone with family/was afraid that I'd get too frustrated with kids being kids.  Refused to file for insurance to cover her therapist because she was afraid that if something happened that the therapist could testify against her.  Since I was set free:  Met someone and experienced a relationship unlike anything that I've had before. I got married to someone that knows and supports my dreams. She brought two young kids that call me dad. We've got #3 due in a month. Paid off $20k in student loan debt. Paid off my car. Paid off motorcycle (post-divorce celebration purchase). Paid off ex (only six months @ $250!) and haven't had contact with her in months. Have a plan for buying a house as soon as next summer, as late as the summer after. Went to the dentist and doctor for the first time in years. Run every day. Got a new job. Finished my graduate degree. Am making hard inroads at my new job that should lead to better things by volunteering and being more vocal now that I have someone at home to push me rather than hold me back and debase me.  It's difficult to quantify how much better off I am, because the human mind has difficulty imagining infinity.  Edit: I'm brewing beer! I'm spending more time with my family!

Also, just like you, it was ultimately my decision, but it never felt 100% like the correct choice. I just didn't want to spend another 10 years in a half hearted marriage that would eventually produced children. It truly does feel surreal being alone and free, but you will get used to it.

But I feel the same way, I don't want a marriage where we are just existing together, or resentful of past transgressions that we can't fully escape. I have plenty of good friends that are extremely supportive and helping me by inviting me to visit and play golf, go hiking etc. which is good to get me out of the house. I am a person that is ok being alone, I don't really need people around all the time. But it doesn't sound like a healthy environment right now so I pretty much accept any invitation.   I really appreciate the support. It's tough cause I don't really know anyone that has gone through a divorce or separation. Feels good to kind of word vomit all of this out.

I guess I was wrong.     That's how I felt about my brother's divorce. His wife cheated on him and left him for another man. ...Then it turned out my husband was cheating on me, too. And I was also informed by a friend.    Now we're divorcing for essentially the same reasons you are: He wants a white picket fence and a high salary. He wants to be a jet set high roller. I want a cabin in the woods. I want to climb mountains.     We're still going through the process. But so far, I've found someone new and my husband hasn't. I'm happy in this relationship. I laugh more, I stress less, and I don't have to fight tooth and nail to do the little things that make me happy, like going hiking or skiing. Our little one adores my new partner and he's adjusting really well. I don't know if it was denial or what, but I didn't even know I was unhappy in my marriage until I had this to compare it to. Neither did my husband, I think. We didn't know either of us was unhappy, but neither one of us was fulfilled and we both wanted a way out. It is for the best.    I'll probably never 100% ""get over"" the divorce. You make that commitment when you marry someone and you expect it to last until death do you part, you know? It breaks your world when it fails. But we are both better off this way in the long run. My husband will find someone new soon enough, and he'll be happier too.    Good luck to you."

If you work full time now, and your wife is already a SAHM, it can be difficult to get that changed.  If your STBX is planning to go back to work full time, however, that will be a factor.  You'll absolutely have to have an attorney to assist you though, glad to hear that you already have one.  It is possible, I have primary custody of my son and have since our divorce."

Such people often experience longing or numbness. A big heartbreak is an indicator of a relationship thoroughly explored. We don't know your situation, but we do know that you loved your partner enough to really feel the impact his or her departure. That is commendable, and you should be proud.

Divorce,3dk5tg,Someguywhoneedshelp,3,Fri Jul 17 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"Same plot in an episode of Friends when Ross and Rachel got married in Vegas and then wanted to get it divorced/annulled.  You can't get a quickie wedding at 2:00 AM in Vegas anymore. A few years ago the office that was open 24/7 that issued the licenses changed their hours to more reasonable hours, so it's unlikely you'd be able to do it.  I think it would be far easier to get a marriage annulled if you changed you mind a few days later vs. getting a divorce, but I guess it depends on what state your in. If there was no danger to either person, I don't see why a judge wouldn't make the two parties wait whatever the state requirement before divorce is.  My opinion? If I got married on a lark in Vegas and then hit a jackpot, I'd gladly split the proceeds with the other party, if for no other reason that we could get divorced just as quickly if we immediately agree to a 50/50 split."

But when you come into a sub-reddit dedicated to people trying to do one of three things, decide if they want to divorce, deal with being told they're significant other wants a divorce, or deal with all the crap that comes with the divorce process/being divorced, asking about quicky marriages, asking how easy it is to get divorced if you get a drunken marriage, and asking about stupid(yes Britney is stupid) celebrities and their Vegas marriages, it seems VERY disrespectful to the people who are here trying to heal, trying to deal with issues, etc.   Marriage, and divorce is not a commitment to go into lightly. Marriage itself is absolutely not something you do while you're wasted at Vegas at 2 AM. Divorce for many people is the worst thing to ever happen to them, and extremely traumatic. You coming into this sub-reddit, making light of it, is going to anger a lot of people who are here for advice, or even just a sympathetic ear.

Divorce,3dk5tg,abloodyminge,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:09:58 2015 UTC,"Im not really thinking of getting drunk and having a last minute wedding in Vegas lol. People don't even plan that probably-its probably a stupid drunken decision they made at the last minute and I wonder if that's one of the reasons why Vegas decided to stop doing 24/7 marriages.  And I'm not angry at all. I'm not making light of divorce-I was just really curious about how easy it would be to get an annulment or divorce if you got drunk and got hitched in Vegas. In the Britney documentary it seemed like the annulment was granted right away but in the movie What Happens In Vegas the couple wanted to get a divorce and the judge refused to grant it to them, but maybe that's because Britney is a millionaire pop star and has amazing lawyers and the couple in What Happens In Vegas were supposed to be like middle class people. I don't know??  Anyway I'm not making light of divorce and I feel bad for anyone who is going through a divorce. That's horrible. Sorry if anyone was offended by this or it seemed like I'm making light of divorce because I'm not. :)"
Divorce,3dk5tg,Catcherofsouls,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"Sigh   Listen, the reason the movie What Happens in Vegas was made possible was because the two parties could not come to an agreement about the money, normally after a single night there would be no assets, and it would be annulled easily, the real issue was they could not prove who the money legally belonged to (tho I am fairly certain there is case law on this because gambling and slot machines are big in Vegas). If they had come to an agreement to split the assets 50-50 it would have been over. In fact, in the movie when one of them finally does give up the money, it is instantly settled.  That is what pissed the judge off. They were wasting the court's time, and you do not want to do that. The judge could not have forced them to stay married, it would have violated their civil rights, however the courts absolutely could have put a hold on their assets until an agreement was made, and could have instructed a county clerk not to put them on the roster for a court appearance for some time.    I'm not making light of divorce-I was just really curious about how easy it would be to get an annulment or divorce if you got drunk and got hitched in Vegas.   Seriously? You're basing all of this off of a movie, and asking  hypothetical nonsensical questions because of something you saw on TV about a freaking celebrity. But your question has been answered, how about you head over to /r/depression and talk about the Kurt Cobain documentary you recently watched and how if someone were going to attempt suicide what would have the greatest success rate?

Divorce,3dgoj0,Daemon42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"Appraisal is split.  Valuation is what that comes up to minus the mortgage.  So value of $100k with a $90k mortgage means it's ""worth $10k"".  Courts typically don't consider cost to sell.  Having said that, I required that be accounted for.  Initially her lawyer said it doesn't count - to which I responded ""Sell the house then, and she owes 1/2 mortgage until it goes"".  Her lawyer agreed I could do that and she then agreed to my terms."
Divorce,3dgoj0,Daemon42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to do?  One of you keep the house?  If so, then it doesn't matter what either one of you think the value is.  In order to keep the house, the one who is keeping it needs to qualify for a new mortgage in their name only.  Part of the refinance process will be an appraisal, anyway.  Do NOT keep your name on the house or the mortgage if you are letting her keep it.  If you don't want to remain married to her, why would you want to go into a real estate investment venture with her?  As far as your related question, it would depend on who it benefits the most.  i.e. if you're trying to get her to buy out your equity, then no, I wouldn't factor in the associated costs of selling the property.  If she's trying to get you to buy her out, then yes, factor in the costs associated with selling it.  Costs vary by state, but for simple back of the napkin math, you can safely estimate 10% for closing costs, settlement fees, taxes, lawyer, realtor, etc.  Simple math example: $100,000 market value, $50,000 mortgage outstanding.  Each party is entitled to a gross amount of $25,000 equity.  If you want the equity, don't mention the associated costs.  Make her or her attorney bring that up.  If she wants the equity, then reduce her $25,000 by $2,500 to account for her share of the associated costs.  If/when her attorney says ""those don't count"" then respond like /u/Daemon42 did, and the issue will go away quickly.  If it were me, I would sell the house and divide the net remaining assets.  I kept the house in my divorce, and in the long run it wasn't a smart move.  I should have cut my losses, moved into an apartment, and started over that way."
Divorce,3dgoj0,LaTuFu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:41:58 2015 UTC,2nd on cutting losses and starting over.  I'm actually in the same boat for my 2nd time but this time around the mortgage was in my name only... and there was no way in hell she would have qualified for it... so path of least resistance...  BUT I did get a deal on the valuation :)
Divorce,3dgoj0,Daemon42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:24 2015 UTC,"The only two options are to sell it or one of you keeps its, buying out the other and refinancing. Selling it is the best way to determine value, but other than that, offering to buy out at a set price can work.   If the STBX wants more than the set price , then sell it to the STBX at that price. Say that you think the house is worth somewhere around $300 with a mortgage of $200 (equity of $100), tell STBX you would like to keep the house and offer her $45 for her equity, tell her that she can keep the house if she gives you $45.   The reason to offer less than half of the equity is if the house is sold, the real estate agent has to be paid out of the equity. If the house can be actually sold for $310, the equity is around $110 with the real estate agent getting a little more than $18 with you and your ex splitting $92,000 in equity ($46 apiece).  The key to this is being willing to set a price and not to care either way."

I wouldn't be sure that the husband would automatically be listed as the birth father, and I'm sure he could challenge it immediately so that he's not listed and thus not liable for child support."

If you name him as the father and he contests, a DNA test is all it takes to establish paternity.  He should be responsible for the child support and have an opportunity to be in the child's life."
Divorce,3dgcxq,throwawayJOKER17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:34 2015 UTC,"1) yes you should keep hoping things get better, but you need to worry about your own life. You can't make your parents behave a certain way. Don't forget they're not gonna take advice from you. You're their child, regardless of your maturity level. I'm 33, with a couple of masters degrees, and my mom still thinks of me as 8 years old and doesn't listen.  2) you're an adult. You'll be able to see whoever you want when you want. If you want to live with one or the other, you can. They have 0 legal rights to dictate custody to you.  3) you should be trying to encourage your parents to go to counseling but you also need to get your own life in order. You might want to think about living at college to get away from this situation. All the added stress of being the mediator is going to make college a lot harder and less fun then it should be."
Divorce,3dgcxq,rasconjon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:17:22 2015 UTC,Don't take on the responsibility of your parents' relationship. Do continue to suggest counseling but beyond that there isn't anything that you can do. You deserve to live your own life.

My ex-wife was even ""friendly"" about it, saying there was no real timer, etc.  I lasted roughly a week before I got an extended-stay hotel lined up for my own sanity. I understand not everyone can swing that financially, but what I am attesting to is that I am one cheap fucker, and I could not stand being in the house with the person such that I was willing to splash out money for the extended-stay hotel.  Now in my case, my wife cheated on me (and lied to me about it the entire time, including post-divorce, even though at some point I figured it out, though I did not really want to admit it to myself for a while). So that made it particularly shitty; perhaps it would be easier if it were just an ordinary ""we're not right for each other"" split-up, I don't know."

That is very taxing emotionally. Your mileage may vary, my ex complains about being short on money while being only willing to work 25 hours per week as a part time secretary.

Divorce,3df5wv,tsdguy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"A lawyer or a paralegal may be able to answer how the equity in the house is split.  In some states it is based on the current equity, in others it is based on the current equity minus any down payment made by each partner. In the second case, if the current equity is 40,000 and one partner paid (from assets owned prior to the marriage) a $20,000 down payment, the first partner gets $30,000 from selling the house, the other gets  $10,000 (half of the gain in equity). In other states, the equity ($40k) is evenly split, $20K to each. Depends on your state and other circumstances."

I don't know how it was better than just moving out, but for financial and legal reasons, I didn't.   If you can sell and eradicate your debt, by all means do that. It sounds like he has chronically been down on his luck. How is waiting and continually supporting him going to help with that? And if you wait two more mentally difficult years, will you end up possibly owing him more maintenance than you may owe him now because he is still un(der) employed? If you are the one that lands on your feet and can supply a stable household first, can you minimize your child's instability by allowing him to visit in your home until he had a place to live? What would happen to him that would not allow him to see your child? I learned that it isn't the house that keeps kids stable, it is the parents. It isn't your job to take care of him anymore.   I was honestly really worried about my kids as well, which is why they didn't know until 1 week before the court date. And I got them a therapist, which was a huge help. And I wish I hadn't needed to wait so long through the mental torture of it all. Because the end result was the same for the kids. There was no benefit to them living with two parents that ignored each other and were miserable.  (Edit: pelling that I did catch.

Divorce,3dewyr,fatheroftwoboys,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Follow the orders. What does it say about change of address? Mine just says to send a letter 60 or more day before move. Mind you, mine also has a geographic restriction so what you're doing won't work for me.   If your order has a restriction, then you will have to get it lifted. It should be easy with your ex not living in the child's school zone as your ex won't have a say stopping the move."
Divorce,3dewyr,laughterandtears,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"There is a clause in my decree that states one parent cannot move to a location that would cause a change of school for the kids without the other parent's approval. My lawyer pointed out that would allow one parent to stop the other from moving in the same town if that parent changed to a different school boundry.   It reads like you do not have an agreement that was entered into the court system. I would honestly ask a lawyer. What is in your agreement? Does it have a clause similar to mine? What you may have to do is actually file something for support and custody. I remember being told that if a change is agreeably been made and in practice you have been using a certain parenting plan that is different than what is filed, they will stick with the one you have been doing in practice.

At this point, you should have it updated to reflect a long distance parenting plan that spells out specifics like how summer breaks, holidays etc. will work and things like who will pay for plane tickets.

Divorce,3dcjee,ThinkOfTheChildren88,3,Wed Jul 15 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"You can ask for things like that, but state law and ""best interests of the child"" will always trump any language in the agreement.  Generally speaking, to your question, if you have 50/50, the burden will be on her to prove that more custody time is in the best interests of the children.  In other words, did you suddenly become a drug dealing pimp who uses the kids as a mule? If not, she's going to have a hard time getting more custody time.  And if she tries to, when you file your counter motion it should be pretty straight forward to have it written into your counter/response ""she pays for my legal fees"" but double check with your attorney about that.  As far as the maintenance, don't waste your time (and money) trying to prevent that.  She will have the legal right to have the support amount examined over time.  As you make more money, she'll be entitled to more child support, per the CO state child support guidelines.  The good news is, there is a state calculator, so you'll always know what that number will be.  Ask your attorney, there is a possibility you can do something along the lines of ""two year waiting period between maintenance reviews"" or something like that, just to prevent her from dragging you into court constantly.  But she'll always have the ability to ask for more support if your income increases, just get used to it."
Divorce,3dcjee,LaTuFu,3,Wed Jul 15 13:45:41 2015 UTC,"You can ask for things like that, but state law and ""best interests of the child"" will always trump any language in the agreement.   Agreed. Not only that, in most locations (not sure about CO) a ""significant change of circumstances"" is required to even consider changing a custody order.  As far as future proofing goes, the only thing that springs to mind is language surrounding one parent moving out of the area. Consider putting a limit to the area one parent can move without triggering a change in the custody plan where the relocating parent agrees to a long distance plan and is the one to forfeit time."
Divorce,3dcjee,JVorhees,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:08:28 2015 UTC,language surrounding one parent moving out of the area.   Good call.
Divorce,3dcjee,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:10:24 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think my ultimate fear is that I go penniless trying to defend my time with my kids. If she was responsible for paying my fees if the attempt to take the kids was deemed not valid then not only would it give me some peace of mind but perhaps make her think twice. Again I hope none of this ever comes to fruition but she fooled me once and I'll be damned if I let it happen again.
Divorce,3dcjee,neuroprncss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Have it written into the agreement, for example that child support cannot be amended unless the other party becomes unemployed or their income drops 25% or more (as an example). With custody, what you'd stated isn't unreasonable, but it does need to be in the agreement and signed by both parties."
Divorce,3dcjee,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jul 15 11:16:05 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what the agreement says.  State law will always supersede with regards to child support.    Custody is normally governed by ""best interests of the child"" as well, so if he gets 50/50 up front he isn't in danger of losing the kids later on unless he does something to trigger the best interests of the children benchmark."
Divorce,3dcjee,neuroprncss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"Agree, but I guess what I meant is that it has to be stated in a parenting plan and signed by both parties.   Edit: until signed, she can change her mind and decide to fight for more than 50/50. However, it is in best interest of child to have this joint custody, so she would be fighting an uphill battle to ask for more, unless it can be proven that you are a danger to the children or some other such circumstance.  And yes, changes to custody/time sharing would require a trip back to court to prove why you should have them less. You can absolutely add a prevailing party claim, where if ANYTHING gets taken back to court, the prevailing party will have their legal fees paid by spouse.   Your best bet is getting this all in writing (with your lawyers help, the more details included the better). And then get her to sign on it asap."
Divorce,3dcjee,toasterchild,2,Wed Jul 15 22:32:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not overly worried about the maintenance due to her earning potential (she has a useful masters degree) and I don't think I will contest anything within reason for child support.

Divorce,3dclpc,dktestrun,3,Wed Jul 15 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"She's an addict, it sounds like, or at least has very addict/narcissistic-like tendencies.  You're no longer enabling her behavior, and you're no longer allowing her to manipulate you and control the situation.  That's why she is angry with you.  Say all of this out loud to yourself, looking at yourself in the mirror while you're doing it:   I'm going to commit my life to someone.  She's going to be free to sleep with other men, but I will have to remain faithful to her. She can come and go as she pleases without any consequences.  I can't hold her accountable, but she can hold me accountable. I have to provide as much financial and emotional support as she requires.  I am not allowed to ask for anything back from her, especially accountability for any of the support I have provided. I have to be willing to accept this relationship on her terms and her terms only.  My only role is to help her pick up the pieces of the poor decisions she makes.  My needs and wants in the relationship are irrelevant.   Does any of that sound rational to you?  The reasons she doesn't like where this is going now is because you're pulling away, and she no longer has ""the boring guy"" around as a fall back.  You allowed her to continue having access to the house after she moved away unannounced!  No wonder she thought she could just come back again.  I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this situation.  I highly recommend that you spend a period of time in singleness, and seek counseling.  Read the book Codependent No More and discover where this ""fixer/helper"" personality you have came from.  It's good to be a giver in a relationship, but there is a line, and you have to learn where that line is, ASAP, if you want to be in a healthy relationship in the future.  Otherwise, you are in danger of repeating this mistake all over again.  Trust me, you'd rather not go through this 3-4 more times before you learn the lesson the hard way.

And no need to sell me on the irrationality of that logic, I came to that conclusion and it helped me make this decision - and feel good about it.

As much as I care about him as a person and want him to be well and happy.... I can't do it for him. It's not my job anymore (and really it wasn't my job in the first place.

Divorce,3dbuia,Karissa36,3,Wed Jul 15 01:43:53 2015 UTC,Child support is based on overnights.  One option is to increase your number of overnights.  Right now she has your daughter 6 out of 7 days per week according to the child support tables.    Another option is to try to convince your STBX that neither one of you can continue to afford Montessori and you should explore cheaper daycare.  Especially for a 2 year old.

You have pretty good odds of getting your daughter 3 nights a week.  Run the numbers to see how that changes child support.  You have a smaller chance of insisting on a cheaper daycare, but in light of your combined incomes I think that you do have a chance at this also.  You guys are paying nearly 25 percent of your net income on Montessori.  For a 2 year old!

No need to lawyer up when the other side is a complete pushover.  You have kids involved, therefore you cannot afford to do this without an attorney.  Get an attorney, you'll get more visitation (you're entitled to more, btw, just because she doesn't want you to have it doesn't mean she can have it that way) and you'll get your child support obligation reduced.

The vast majority of posters always explain that property and equity obtained during the marriage should be split equally (or according to law).  Hell, in my own case where I was responsible for a third of the equity that I contributed from money prior to marriage, I was constantly told it didn't matter and that I gifted it to the marriage (despite pointing out hybrid property laws in my state).  But yes, by default they assume the poster is telling the truth about his situation and that their wife is a nut job if they describe her as such. However, they're also quick to call someone out if they are in fact the nj in the relationship.  But if you care to look closely (or at all, apparently), you'll realize that the entire reason for being is to help fathers maintain relationships with their children. Anyone looking to get out of paying their fair share of child support or doing something not in the interest of their child is quickly put in their place and shown the door.  I assume you've never had to experience what I and many others fathers had to experience when it come to ex's that wanted to shut them out of their child's life. Lucky for you because the divorce process and society does not favor fathers. If you did you be extremely grateful for anyone willing to offer their time and energy to help."

Many fathers take a stance such as OP and the list gives them an idea of things to consider when confronted with someone who is attempting to do to them what OP's wife is doing.

So don't spend 2 minutes drawing a conclusion and possibly keeping OP from getting a fair custody deal because you think some internet people are meanies.  As far as bitter goes, do you blame them? How about you have your children taken away from you and your life ruined because you weren't aware enough about the law to protect yourself from a biased system.  Edit: as a matter of fact, there was an uproar a few months ago when the law firm that host the site changed the name from ""dads divorce"" to ""men's divorce"" because people felt it was not representative of what their purpose for contributing was: helping fathers and their children, not men getting a divorce."

And many states automatically default to EOW unless the parents agree to 50/50.

Divorce,3d8s3m,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:10:39 2015 UTC,"She would sometimes analyze work issues/confrontations, our disagreements and other parts of her life a lot.  If she felt like she said something stupid or did something wrong at work for example she would constantly think about it.  This also happened when she asked me to pick up her up from the hospital after she had been there a few days.  She wanted to leave and I told her that I think it was best for her to stay there.  I wanted her to be safe and I was afraid she would hurt/kill herself.  I never refused or was mean about it.  I was honestly scared and not equipped to handle someone so depressed/suicidal.  I learned the next day visiting her that she felt I refused to pick her up, called her sister (who doesn't like me and isn't really nice to my wife), told her I refused to pick her up and her sister told her I didn't have her best intentions in mind.  I can't tell you how hurtful this was for me to hear.  She over analyzed that too for a long time without telling me.

This is pretty much a hallmark moment of bipolar behavior. It may be intentional, it may not be. But they don't receive or process information like normal people so you never really know. You will never change her mind on it, so you have to learn to let that stuff go.   People with unstabilized mental illnesses are not in a relationship with you. They can't be. They are in their own heads. They can never feel the same about you, be fair, be kind. IT will always be about them."

Divorce,3d8s3m,bradbrookequincy,3,Tue Jul 14 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"No wonder you are devastated. She hasn't given you a good reason and hasn't given you any recourse. This really is about her and not about you. The information is limited but I think she may have more going on than just depression. If her father was abusive, it is possible he had a mental illness that he activated in her through the abuse.   people with more severe mental illnesses will just do a 180 on their spouse and leave them. It is mainly out of abandonment issues. They leave you before you can leave them. It doesn't matter if her father is in the picture or not, he failed as a father and wasn't there emotionally, so he still abandoned her.   She has never had an example of what a healthy relationship is supposed to be.   The thing is, if she is not willing to help herself with her own depression, if she isn't on medication AND therapy to better herself,  you really don't have any choice but to leave and let her self destruct.   The frustration must be beyond words, and I understand and I am sorry for it. But you also can't rationalize the irrational. You are not dealing with someone who feels or thinks on the same wavelengths you are.   I believe in keeping marriages together. But it wouldn't be a marriage, and most likely it never has been. It most likely has been you taking care of her. You have been a replacement father, a nurse and caretaker, but never a spouse.   You can't save her, you can only save yourself."
Divorce,3d8s3m,bradbrookequincy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:58:23 2015 UTC,The first five years of our relationship were great.  It was after having a meltdown that things changed.  She is on medication and seeing a therapist.  I honestly don't think he is a good one.  I only went to two of them and he seemed to blame me a bit.  I'm not saying I'm a perfect spouse but it was a bit strange.  She also said he cried once and told her he didn't realize it was so bad at home.  This was her telling him about my concern with her sleeping so much.  I'm sure she described it in the way she felt the conversation was but to have a therapist cry and say that about a husband I felt was completely unprofessional.  A therapist should remain objective and never show emotions like that in my opinion.  He is a influencing force in her life and if he is saying things are bad at home then how can that not only fuel her feelings?

It is a clinical problem that needs treated clinically by a psychiatrist dealing in depression and bipolar and ptsd etc. You have a therapist that got a liberal arts degree, then a masters in talk therapy and that has No fucking idea whats going on here. Every one of her behaviors is CLINICAL and needs treatment.  You changing anything WILL NOT change her biology.

I assume you meant that her therapist is a moron.  My wife was never one to walk over me.  She was never demanding or acted like a princess.  I would never be in that type of relationship where one person walks over the other.  Over the past two years I have tried my best to help her get better and possibly back to how she was before her breakdown.  I constantly think of things I could have done differently/better.  It was certainly uncharted waters for me.  I have never been with someone who was so depressed/suicidal.  I guess I have to realize I did the best I could and ultimately this is beyond either my or her control.  It's just really difficult to not think of myself as a failure.
Divorce,3d8s3m,yikingyocks,2,Wed Jul 15 10:49:11 2015 UTC,"She is seeing the wrong therapists. She needs to be seeing a psychologist that deals specifically in biological based personality disorders resulting from severe childhood trauma and a psychiatrist who knows how to ""make people whole"" again after severe child hood trauma and abuse.

Divorce,3d902l,8410641,3,Tue Jul 14 13:07:50 2015 UTC,She needs to talk with a therapist about moving on beyond the divorce.  You're (in a lot of ways) too close to the problem to be of help and I am guessing that you are not a trained professional.  Keep your mother/child relationship don't change it into Mother/Therapist.
Divorce,3d902l,Catcherofsouls,2,Tue Jul 14 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"Aw. :(  She must be a good mum because good mums feel guilt. It is like a default setting. I feel guilt over everything. It is ridiculous.    but mainly because she feels like she's let her children down by picking a partner that didn't turn out to be the father she thinks we deserve.   She may be thinking that she drove him away somehow and feels responsible for his leaving.   Like Catcher says, this is something she needs to work through herself.  I know that as her son, you want to help her. But encouraging her to seek help and making sure the therapist is decent (there are many who are not) would be the best thing for her.   When dealing with deep seated emotions like this, people can tell the sufferer what is obvious and makes sense, but sometimes, it just still isn't enough and doesn't penetrate.  A few family sessions wouldn't hurt.   You can try explaining to her that this isn't her fault, and she isn't the one who left.  But mostly, that you are ok. Because I know that my greatest fear is what will happen to my kid. I just want to know he will be ok."

Divorce,3d902l,FusRo_Duh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear that you and your mom are still aching from your dad's sudden departure! That sounds really difficult, and I'm glad that your mom has you as an advocate.   I'm curious what your assessment of your mom's choice of partner is. Do you think your dad was a good partner and father up until he left? It sounded like it was a shock to everyone that he left, so I wonder if he was present and attentive for much of their relationship, or if there were problems all along.  If your mom really does struggle with choosing great people to bring into her life (ignoring red flags, being attracted to exciting and uncommitted people, allowing herself to be mistreated), then she might benefit from addressing this issue in the form of therapy or intentional social skill development to work on underlying issues that led to her marrying and staying with your dad. Perhaps she is repeating a pattern in her family, dealing with low self esteem, or something else.  If your mom had no way of knowing what your dad was doing behind her back, and she is tormenting herself by feeling guilty for something she could not have controlled, then she might benefit from reading books, doing workshops, etc. to work on her mindset and spiritual or emotional development. Sometimes people flip out in middle age and have affairs, but don't have the emotional skills to take responsibility for their behavior. It is sometimes more of a reflection of the impulsive choices of the affair seeking partner than the partner who didn't know."

Divorce,3d7ys2,klutchmonkey64,4,Tue Jul 14 16:11:05 2015 UTC,Then block the new number.  Really this is not rocket science.
Divorce,3d7ys2,LucidSheDreams999,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ dude. Stay away, far away. No contact. I'm sorry about your son. Good luck."
Divorce,3d7ys2,ZA_SDK,4,Tue Jul 14 12:20:40 2015 UTC,"You two lost a child together. That's pretty damn significant. May even be a contributing factor as to why she's been acting coo coo bananas. Affairs to deal with the pain, trauma and loss. Lies to cover up and mask the lack of self control.   I don't know your ex or her intentions. She sounds like a train wreck but who wouldn't be given the scenario. Most people don't suffer the loss of a child without at least a bit of losing their damn minds for a while.  I understand why you wouldn't want to invest much more energy into the relationship. I could see how the loss of your child and the marriage would make you want to wash your hands and just move on.  Honestly, I feel sorry that you both had to experience that trauma. The truth is that you're both connected in some way forever due to having that shared experience.   As far as contact with her, talk to an attorney and see what is recommended. I talk to my crazy ass exes when they have a serious life problem. I may not hang out with them in person or talk to them very much, but I'm always a friendly ear if someone really needs help. Maybe she just wants to talk or ask your advice. Maybe start with an email, be honest about feeling not too safe to talk since she accused you of horrible things. Then ask if she's ok and if there's anything she'd like to discuss specifically.  I know it must difficult to forgive this woman, but her spirit is totally broken. Do your best to be kind and if you can't muster the energy to care just don't even bother answering and move forward.  Hope things get better and so sorry you've had to deal with this."

Well done.   she decided to keep my last name   I hope my STBX removes my last name/surname. She doesn't deserve it.   I don't even know what to make of it. What is her goal in communicating with me?  Crazy nut trying to rope you back in for more abuse."
Divorce,3d7ys2,Catcherofsouls,2,Tue Jul 14 06:25:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know though. As I said in my voat thread, she doesn't just act out of cruelty, she acts out of person gain and it doesn't matter how cruel or destructive she is to get that. If she has nothing to gain from it, she doesn't bother.   Edit to add: three people lost their military careers, not including her own, over her shit. To try and beat the adultery rap for the first guy, she had asked others to lie for her and to say that she was sexually assaulted. Her best friend came out and said that it was all lies, she was the one pursuing the relationship, there was no sexual assault. Her bff got kicked out, the dude she was seeing got kicked out, and the last dude she fucked before I left got court marshaled because he was an officer."
Divorce,3d7ys2,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:44:31 2015 UTC,"Two things: Go on Radio Silence mode. This means you don't pick up the phone when she calls (let it go to voice mail)... do not reply to texts/emails, stop communicating with her. If she sends an address, send the ashes to her with no return address so sue can't trace you back.  Another thing to do is 2 degrees of separation. Cut ties with anyone else who is friends with her. Stop communicating with them. Do this to most of the friends you have in mutual. This prevents her from trying to communicate with you.   Good luck. Hope your divorce is finalized soon."

My STBX is an officer and we were married almost 13 years until he went off the deep end and started acting erratically and finally ended up cheating on me with a friend of ours.  I can't imagine going through this from a different state.  The big thing I see with yours is going to be getting him to sign all of the papers, notatize em, and get em back to you in a timely manner.  Are you guys using lawyers or are you DIYing it?  We DIYed ours because he cut me a more than fair deal.  It's really hard and I went through that numb stage.  Bad news is it didn't last for me and the good news is that it does get better.  I'm still in the midst of it but since I moved out and we don't talk unless it's business, it's much more manageable.  Just try to keep the Mom stays out of this as much as you can and that you get a fair shake.  Best of luck to you and it does get better!"

I know that there are certain military codes that require an allotment of the BAH to be given to me if/when we are separated so I will certainly make sure I pursue that and get in touch with the command so its enforced.  I am definitely struggling with the reality of not just losing my marriage but my best friend, and that void that could now be in my life :/"
Divorce,3d6dj0,spatter_cone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"I totally felt the same about my STBX.  I loved him more than just a lover, he was my best friend.  However, the way he treated me wasn't respectful at all and we no longer talk.  The only thing I took from him pay-wise was half his retirement.  After 13 years of being married to someone that was out to sea constantly, I dont feel bad taking it.  I'd definitely see what youre entitled to.  Being married in the military is tough, but I dont think my marriage would have lasted regardless and thats a hard realization to come to--thats just my experience though."
Divorce,3d6dj0,rasconjon,2,Tue Jul 14 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"Have you tried going to counseling?  With the accessing his LES, is it possible that he didn't know you're able to access it without a CAC card? I know plenty of younger soldiers who didn't know this.  Many military guys get tunnel vision in their career because unfortunately, many times they're the ones who have full time careers because of the stress moving regularly can put on a wife.   How long have you been married for? How long have these behaviors been on-going?"

Divorce,3d6dj0,MaleGoddess,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:50:28 2015 UTC,"Acquiring supplies isn't theft. If it said US Army on it, my name tape said US ARMY too, so that meant it was mine.   I don't know though, if he's been in long enough to PCS, he's gotta know the ropes by now. Even if he didn't acquire a CAC reader, he knows how to ""right-click print"", or if he's real savvy, ""Ctrl-P"".   He just doesn't want his wife knowing his finances. I would not be ok with that. My ex-wife would ""borrow"" from her parents all the time, and by borrow I mean ask for money she never intended to pay back. I wouldn't be ok with it either."

His claim is that the bills go to his permanent address of record, but cant understand that I am now essentially his permanent address. He isn't in the barracks or going TDY from school to school. Whatever address I am at is permanent, and in the event of a move can be updated with companies.    I plan on addressing it with him directly and asking for the log in information, and if he refuses than that is a pretty black and white sign that I cant deny. I am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he never has used a log in for MyPay and only ever done it with his cac card reader and therefore hasn't set up the log in info. I don't know if those are two separate things or not."
Divorce,3d6dj0,rasconjon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:20:38 2015 UTC,He has a CAC card reader at home. I wanted to be able to access it when he deploys and I cant just have him print it off.

There are times when it feels like there is progress and then other times that he doesn't apply or listen to the therapists recommendations and its frustrating.   I am not sure if he knows or not, but I am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he doesn't. I plan on bringing it up and if he is resistant then I think that sends a very clear message and I cant ignore it.   I have a full time job that I love with tremendous career growth potential and wonderful benefits. Additionally, I am in school furthering my education, which he claims to support. So for us its not a one paycheck, one career family. I know I want to have a great career so I do support his ambition and motivation to further his.   We have been married about 9 mths, and I would say they really started around month 5 or so."

I was one of those who dated for a short time before getting married because of deployment, and I had known her since we were kids, families were friends, etc... But behind closed doors, things change... I ended up giving up the military for my ex, and now I'm here. If I could go back I wouldn't have gotten married but who knows where I'd be, I was kind of burned out near the end anyways. The reason I ask is what kind of baseline of behavior do you have previously? If it's not long...then it just could be who he is, especially when it comes to the military, many guys are VERY career driven."

Divorce,3d56rb,Altruizzy,2,Tue Jul 14 00:39:19 2015 UTC,I usually would try to make an empathic remark but I found myself wanting a glass of champagne to celebrate with you. Good fucking riddance. What can we do to help? How long will it take for your wrist to heal? Couple months? You'll be back in action in no time. How about telling us about your dad? Would that help the grieving.

I grew up knowing I was loved unconditionally which makes it interesting that I chose a man who was nothing like my father. I think b/c I had a relatively healthy family I chose the most broken soul I could thinking I could ""fix"" him, etc. Wrist is healing. And it's almost a blessing I broke it b/c I wouldn't have come back to Mom's if I had been able to stay working. So, really I can go anywhere, live in a new town if I want and start a new career too.  That's exciting."

Then my father passed suddenly.  It had actually been my intention to come clean about my marriage when he came back from his trip because I had been hiding so much from him but he never came back.  I was lost without my compass and paralyzed with fear and I ended up staying in the marriage two years longer than I knew I should have under the guise of 'giving it a chance' because all I could think was ""well, I can't tell him I want a divorce after my father just died.""  How I wish he would have told me.    I'm not trying to minimize at all the sadness you are going through.  I understand it deep in my soul.  I do.  It's just that reading your post made me look at my situation in another way so I guess I thank you for that.    You have my deepest sympathy for your dad and I know the timing is shitty but isn't it nice to not walk on eggshells all the time?  Edit:  I was reading another reply about not missing him but missing the companionship.  I am 2 years divorced now and I still have never missed him.  I do, however, miss someone running to get lunch for me when I have a migraine and didn't want to cook.  Then again, getting him to do food based errands was always easy to do b/c he was a voracious eater lol"

If she is going to stay in the marriage it will be because that is what she decides to do regardless of you. That's a very hard thing to accept but it is the absolute truth. She is the one that has decided the marriage is over, it is not you that is ending the marriage. You're desire to try is normal but it is not what she's feeling.

On the days where it gets really hard I force myself to get out of the house, even if it's just walking aimlessly for miles at least I'm moving and not sitting letting myself sink.  Acceptance is something that comes with time, I think the divorce being finalized will help a lot in that since I won't be in this limbo anymore. It makes it hard because I'm working to establish a healthy co-parenting relationship with my STBX so that gives me false hope at times.   I don't really have any answers for you so I'm sorry for that. But the biggest thing I can say is get out of the house as much as you can, go for walks, sit in a part, sit in a mall, anything."

Divorce,3d4i3z,jacksonstew,2,Mon Jul 13 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you.  A year and 1 month ago today.  We made the decision to separate.   It was the most difficult thing I've ever had to do.  Letting go of a ""Soul Mate"" is crippling.    Going on in the world while what you thought was your soul mate, is out there, very much alive....is... ...the pain is excruciating to say the least.  But In the pain I found myself.  I found a reason to cling to happiness that I create.   This change didn't happen over night.    It took months of grieving, and to be honest I still get down on rare occasion, but that sadness does not last long now and I chalk it up to normal divorcee emotions that I have to acknowledge as normal and question/determine their value to me as a person.  The value is often not good or negative, so I discard those emotions.    The hardest part?  Learning and acknowledging that I and her are not perfect.  No relationships are, and I honestly think she had some underlying undiagnosed mental issues that effected how she dealt with problems (or didn't deal)   Does a part of me wish things would have worked out?   Sure.  We all want to believe that the true love we believed in was true.   Unfortunately life doesn't work out that way for all of us.  We must find the strength within ourselves to love ourselves and let go of past hurt and trauma.   Do not live in the past, but do learn from the past.  You're life will be better in time friend.  It's a rollercoaster for a while, hold on and keep your head up.  Soon you'll be throwing your hands in the air and loving the ride.  Trust me.   C'est la vie"

Divorce,3d5604,sahui,2,Mon Jul 13 22:25:58 2015 UTC,"Maryland is a shared custody state. If I could have full custody, I would have it. You have to prove that the other parent is completely non functional, like a drug addicted prostitute, to get full custody. So no, your daughter won't naturally go all with the wife.   Also, dividing assets isn't that simple either. If your name is on the house and you are the only one who put money into it and can prove it, you just may get it.   Don't make assumptions about divorce laws, do your own research.    BTW, the house is in your name. Give them a week and tell them to get out. If she wants a divorce, it is going to happen anyways.  If guy #2 respected you or had any concern for your family, he would respect boundaries and not interfere with the marriage, but it sounds like he doesn't give a crap and isn't pushing your wife to be a better wife or mother. Is this someone you really should be concerned about?  Sounds like she is turning your house into a full scale trailer.  Start recording everything. Every penny you earn/spend. All the interactions you have with your daughter and take lots of pictures. If you are truly doing all the caretaking, then take pictures and document it. Record all the interactions your wife has with your daughter. If it does come down to a custody dispute, this will factor in."

I can think offhand of four couples within my extended circle who have divorced because of the WoW player starting a relationship with someone met in the game.  Do not move out. Once you move out it will be used against you regarding custody.   Everything beckoning_cat says below is exactly correct. Treat this like your daughter's future is at stake, which it is. Pay the $350 for an initial consultation with a good divorce lawyer. Get on top of this right now. No ""marriage counseling"" -- see a lawyer, and file a divorce petition that demands she move out. Have her served. Then let her make the bullshit ""marriage counseling"" appointment after she kicks out your guests and agrees to start AA meetings with you. Period. Give her a one-week deadline. You can withdraw the petition if she cooperates fully. At any point where money becomes an issue, think, ""My child is worth it."" Tell the lawyer your situation and see whether he/she has any wiggle room or long-term payment plan. If it's a firm, they can let a paralegal do the detail work at  much lower fee."

Anyways, the cruddy state your marriage is in is beginning to effect your daughter. You talk about wanting to stay with it because you don't want her to be hurt. She's already hurt.   I'd talk to a lawyer, get a free consult, ASAP. You want to be in control of the process, you don't want her to control it.   Start taking notes, ie, what you do for your daughter, how little time she spends with her etc.   You've been enabling her, while letting yourself get walked all over. I'd start personal counseling to work on those issues.   Divorce might make things tight for the time being, but long term it's so much more worth it. You'll be better off monetarily long term, and you'll be happier, Which will make your daughter happier. Plus you want her to see positive role models, right now, letting yourself get walked over is not ok."

They never did because they were ""old fashioned"" and against divorce and wanted to stay together for her sake. She's 28 now and still in therapy because having to watch her parents living together even though they hated each other really screwed her up. She's in a great relationship now with a very understanding man but she definitely has relationship issues and fear of marriage from watching her parents. I don't have kids but I feel as though sometimes staying together is not the best thing for children, especially if all you are doing is fighting in front of them.  I would also stop drinking if I were you. If custody is something you're going to try and fight for then I would assume you want the least amount of negatives against you as possible. Also, shit, divorce is so hard.. you really don't want to abuse something like alcohol while going through it. I do not have a drinking problem but I refuse to keep alcohol at my apartment because I never want to find myself going for it when I am sad. I will go out and have drinks with friends during the week but I feel like not having alcohol at home really helps."
Divorce,3d4x0j,daydreamer1989,3,Mon Jul 13 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"I've taken enough Paxil in my life to kill a whale or two. For anxiety and depression actually.  If your therapist thinks you need it, you may want to try it. Keep in mind it takes a few weeks to see results and in some cases you may not even respond to certain medications, or your dosage will need t be adjusted, etc. The important thing to remember is this is no different from taking blood pressure or diabetes medications - you're addressing a biological malfunction in all of these cases.  There can be side effects and withdrawal, depending on how long you're on them, but temporary use will probably work well for you. It's meant to balance you out while you process your emotions from the divorce (not so much 'numb' just more even-keeled).  It's hard to develop proper coping mechanisms when you're feeling this far down, so helping you back up is what the meds are for."
Divorce,3d4x0j,GrandEthos,3,Mon Jul 13 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"I started taking a low dose of zoloft after a few months of counseling, in the middle of my divorce. I was in the thick of it and really couldn't see myself from an outsiders perspective that I was really, really depressed.  I can say that it made me more even keeled, and able to make progress in counseling - it also helped with intrusive thoughts and the brain in constant 'go' mode. It dialed down the noise and helped me focus on the end goal.  All the exercise, healthy eating, vitamins,meditating/yoga, etc in the world could not touch the brain constantly going and the mess of emotions I was feeling. I took it until shortly after my divorce was final and then tapered off gradually once I felt comfortable in my situation."
Divorce,3d4x0j,Pibil,2,Mon Jul 13 19:20:43 2015 UTC,I was on Wellbutrin for a few months. It has this awesome side effect of suppressing hunger. (I may have specifically asked questions that made it possible to be prescribed- weight gain is a common side effect of antidepressants)  I took it for about 6 months. I'm not sure if I really noticed once I stopped taking it - I was fine.

All that time I didn't care about anything included not caring about me weight, and it does make you hungry. When I came off it I was like ""when did I get fat?!?"" I'm currently on Wellbutrin (marriage related) and it's fantastic. Good appetite control and amazing orgasms if that's something you still pursue by any means. I'm also my typical animated self, not the zombie I was on Paxil. (I'd still love the Paxil though) Good luck to you. I think of my antidepressant as a hand to hold as I figure things out.

Research viibryd as it can work quickly and may have less chance of weight and sexual side effects (and only because I know 3 people having great success on it).

That will make have a happier day. A lot of teas and infusions also help to keep your mind clean.   Go to the gym, run or do some exercise. That helped me a lot. After a nice run in the park i just feel relaxed, a clean mind and empowered to recover my life. In my case running have helped be healthier, look better and have a cleaner mind.   Adopt a pet, the can give you so much fun and joy and also will fill those empty space with stuff to do.   Also it helped me starting to take care of my garden. Something i never tought i would like or ever had interest in. Its so relaxing and also you get proud after you see your plants growing and giving flowers and food you can actually eat. As a male i never tought spending my sunday afternoons cooking and watching my flowers.   Get a new hobby or recover a lost one. Go to dance lessons, learn a laguage. Be busy building and growing yourself.   I think the trick is just to keep your mind busy and growing. Do things that will move you forwad.    For my personal taste, i dont like the idea of using medicines or made up chemicals to feel better. There are a lot of things that we can make or get from the nature that will help you.    Its hard. But you can be  strong and will get out of this."

The odds of you both changing in the same direction are pretty damn low.  I think a huge problem couples face is when they believe that because they have been with someone for ""so long"" that they know everything about that person.  You are assuming that your (what appear to you to be) subtle changes on being less submissive will be a positive (and a welcome) change for your husband.  It's totally possible he's not even catching the clue here.  A simple ""Husband, serious talk time for a minute.  My intention is to be less submissive from now on.  I realize this is going to be a change in our lifestyle - I love you and I want to grow through this experience (and many other ones in our future) with you.... <more dialog to follow>"".  It sounds stupid, but this is essentially what counselling will do for you as well.  You may need to do that - but honestly approaching the person ""you know so well"" isn't a bad start.  Who knows it might just work for you and instead of you guys growing apart this deepens the communication you both share and draws you closer together.  I wish you all the best on your journey forward!"

If you didn't develop your own sense of independence living with them when you were younger it isn't likely to start now.  I would seriously consider some sort of counseling for yourself first, maybe try to find a therapist who is also a life coach and deals with higher level issues. It might be a lot easier than you think right now. Sometimes when a person thinks they are standing up for themselves they say things in a way that unintentionally starts arguments and little tweaks to how to word these conversations can change things a lot.   A therapist could very possibly help you guys get back to the ""we"" instead of you against me, even if you don't agree on everything.

If therapy is an option, do it. I think ""finding yourself"" is possible within a marriage. lol I was just absolutely not able to within mine, and I was way worth finding.    You write that your husband has no temper and doesn't manipulate early on, but that he doesn't like you challenging the status quo. This would confuse (and frustrate) a lot in your situation."
Divorce,3d473e,nitabirdonit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:54:27 2015 UTC,"I would strongly suggest that you start seeing a marriage counselor with your husband as it sounds like there's an issue with communication and your husband understanding that both people in the marriage need to compromise.  You shouldn't lose the ""me"" in the marriage because part of his role as your spouse is support you in who you are and make compromises to what he wants so that you can grow. The good news is it's a very fixable problem if both of you commit to making a healthier relationship. At this point a lot of that seems to be on your husband in figuring out how to be a more supportive spouse.   A big part of what makes us who we are is the commitments we make and hold to ourselves and other people in our lives. The commitment you made in marrying your husband is an aspect of who you are, who you've been for 10 years really. So how do you find yourself by cutting off part of what makes you you? A personal therapist can be incredibly helpful for you in finding who you are and how to stand up for yourself rather than just cutting and running, and potentially regretting that decision later."

You'll be just as lost, but going through a divorce.  Instead, figure out who you are while married.  Get some individual therapy.  Branch out.  Explore new things.

I really think you can find yourself in the relationship by just changing your attitude and activities of your daily life, at least you should try it, because when you decide to find yourself ending everything, you will be at the beginning again, which can be good, but it just depends on you.  Due to the similarities of your story, I cannot give you an advice from ""your side"" since I'm living your husband's story after a separation.

A person who wants to be in control will not just say ""Oh, I didn't realize that all my oppressive opinions were keeping you from having your own.""  Nope, they will fight it, or give up themselves.    My marriage didn't survive this awakening I had, and that's fine.  Because I am happy now, even though my life is very stressful.

She's very oldschool and stubborn. She doesn't like therapy at all. She's still in shock.

She should be controlling what information gets out not you.   You should absolutely not be talking to your parents about their relationship issues. You should not be trying to reconnect them or get them back together. Regardless of you being an adult, your parents aren't going to listen to you the same way they would an outside observer or another person, because you're their kid.

I won't try to be an unbiased party because there's no way. I'm indulging her a little because she feel betrayed, but that's all. I won't stop my relationship with my father, of course. I'm not a marriage councillor and I've never been married so I think finding a professional is a good idea. Thank you very, very much. She's also worried about her social status and image because she's always been all about nuclear families and pitied other family dynamics. I don't feel that way.

My parents divorced when I was kid, but they went on battling and asking us to pick sides until well into adulthood.  My Mom was a basket case, too, and she did her level best to try to drag us down with her.  I'm not making my comments from a position of ""I know better than you because...""  I'm telling you as one child of divorce to another, you gotta take care of you first.  Be sympathetic to your parents, but don't get involved.

If his anger issues are so bad that he loses friends over it he needs to get help with figuring out how to deal with it in a healthier manner than he is.  Be honest with him. If he values you as a friend it would be helpful for you to tell him when he's being a jack ass. Seriously that's what real friends are for.

Beyond that, get to a place where you no longer have passion for your ex.  Not love, but also not hate.  In other words, be an emotionally healthy, complete person.

Dating right away will feel really positive.  You'll be pulling yourself out of an emotional wreck where you are prone to feeling lonely and disgusting/unwanted.  Finding someone that is saying ""I'd hit that!"" is a great way to sooth over that - it's also terribly unhealthy.  They aren't exactly this, but I'll describe people in this arena as ""bottom feeders"".  If you are comfortable inviting that into your life, by all means continue.  The great catches of the world aren't going to date someone so fresh out of a divorce.  You'll see them, they will avoid you and then you'll find someone else who will date you - yay you!  The reason that person is willing to date you is they have their own issues - and they aren't going to ""catch"" the greatest fish in the sea either --- which I had to say, right after a divorce is you.  Focus on improving yourself, rounding yourself out.  Then as /u/AwesomeScreenName so wisely states ""When you don't need to date"" you'll be primed to date very well.  tl;dr.  You can date now, if you are down for reduced quality in your potential partners."
Divorce,3d3zsq,Daemon42,2,Mon Jul 13 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"Before you start dating, consider these questions:  What is your intention in dating?  Having fun? Distraction? Avoiding loneliness? Validation?   Why are you posing this question?   Do you have a tendency to rush in too soon? Do you have a tendency to withdraw socially and become depressed? Do you have a belief system that relationships must be grieved for a certain period of time to show respect?   I read an article about how people that wait too long before dating after a breakup report higher incidences of feeling sad and depressed several years after the split (sorry I can't find it; I'll post if I do). This is not to say you should rush into dating fresh out of a divorce, but sometimes a couple has already emotionally distanced themselves from one another years before the divorce. Is that you?   Consider alternatives to dating such as making new friends, spending time with people who make you feel special, and owning your awesomeness without the need for validation.  Good luck!"

I made some comment about find someone ""who is everything my ex was not"" and some kind commenter pointed out that that probably wasn't the bar by which I should judge a new partner.  Nobody is perfect and my next partner may very well share a few flaws with my ex.  Not deal-breaking flaws, but just ""i love you enough to put up with them"" flaws.   I need to be at the point in my healing where I'm not going to run for the hills if my new love interest also does that small but annoying thing that my ex did."

I actually wouldn't call it ""dating"" as I let each woman know I was very non-commital and emotionally unavailable.  You'd be surprised how well HONESTY works.  I am seeing a few woman currently, and they all know that we are not going steady and they call me for sex.   It's nice to have, but at the same time I know I'm in a phase right now...and you know what?  I'm okay with it.  I have goals I'm working towards and I am not going to let a relationship derail me.

Everybody's situation is different.    Most of the time, however, it is best if you wait at least until the divorce is final before considering dating, even on a casual basis.  There is a lot of emotional damage done during a divorce, and it takes a really long time to heal from it.  The process is very similar to grieving the death of a spouse or child--even if you think the divorce is the best thing for you and you initiated it.  Don't be surprised if you need a couple of years before you feel ""right"" enough to start dating again."
Divorce,3d167j,thingsorfreedom,9,Sun Jul 12 17:44:50 2015 UTC,"I would set a fix schedule for all of them. Then, add the clause that ""parents can agree in writing to deviate from the parenting plan."" This gives you the future flexibility, but protect you in case as well. Always be ready!"

Then have language that grants each other flexibility to communicate and decide as everyone agrees best suits the situation.  As far as what you're describing, it should work just fine.  I would suggest asking (but not forcing) the older kids to stick to the schedule with their siblings for the first few months, however.  The younger ones will benefit from having their older siblings around as much as possible while they adjust to the new normal."
Divorce,3d167j,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:07:50 2015 UTC,"Like /u/fatheroftwoboys, I would put the flexibility in AFTER agreeing to alternating weeks. Plus it could be rough on the 8 and 10 year olds if the 15 and 17 decide they want to alternate weeks of the 8 and 10 - then they NEVER see each other. If nothing else, guarantee that all four are in one location for a few days each week. Perhaps one of the two weekend days, and then probably days at the beginning of the week. Because the older kids are going to want to hang with friends on Friday and Saturday nights, and not be ""forced"" to spend it with a parent.   Sunday - Wednesday, alternating parent. Thursday - Saturday - 8 and 10 stay with the same parent, 15-17 can deviate if both parties agree, and it is in writing with some amount of advanced notice.   EDIT: words and formatting"
Divorce,3d167j,Someguywhoneedshelp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:31:24 2015 UTC,I did the alternating weeks and it's brutal on you and the kids. I ended up changing it every two weeks. This came about because I always ended up seeing my kids when the try had tournaments and their mom got them when they were free so she was like Disney mom and I did all the work.
Divorce,3d167j,sgt_richard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:26:52 2015 UTC,"That's a tough situation for you.

Every two weeks was way too long to go without seeing him, as well as way to long for him to stay in an unstructured environment.  Every situation is different, so its important for parents to remain flexible and keep the kids' best interest in front of their own."

It worked fine until the oldest had a moral meltdown and began acting out in ways that were completely unacceptable: stealing, lying, sneaking online to sext with grown men. When it came time to punish him, he just played the ""wanna stay with mom"" card and spent the last two years with her. He only saw me when she needed to leave town and wanted somewhere to dump him.  Honestly, though, it worked out fine. I don't tolerate thieves and liars."

Divorce,3d167j,Daemon42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:01:54 2015 UTC,"As others are telling you - 50/50 only in writing.  You shouldn't need a clause stating ""if you both agree you can deviate"" that is how the decree will work anyway (if you both agree in writing that you revert to be 100% parent for awhile, guess what? you are 100% parent)  Then work out with your ex that you both tell the older 2 kids the same story.  A set schedule is defined, but as you are older, we want to provide you with the freedom to go where you like.  I'd also recommend you highlight to them that this is a privilege and you are both placing trust into them.  Also be clear that you are still communicating with your ex about this.  The main thing you want to avoid is a teenager realizing they have a situation to take advantage of - like ""I want to stay at dodgy friends house and I'll tell each parent I'm staying at the other's house for the night (muhahahahaha)"".    Seriously once you setup a routine of ""checking in"" where the kids are (like you text ex if kid17 shows up on a night that isn't yours) I think you'll be fine.  That may seem like overkill at first, but preventing potential abuse of the situation is what you are doing it for.  If you don't have something routine like this it will be easy for them to slide through cracks if they ever do choose to challenge things."
Divorce,3czp6d,littleorangemonkeys,13,Sun Jul 12 06:23:40 2015 UTC,So. ..unmanaged depression.   Terrible communication.   Man-child attitude towards work.   Alcohol.   Inappropriate fighting.    And now emotional blackmail.   Yeah it's time to step back and realize that in no way is this relationship healthy for you.  You even mention how much better you've felt since separating.   Think about the idea of going back to him and realize that's your alternative.
Divorce,3czp6d,Catcherofsouls,4,Sun Jul 12 12:08:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe, just maybe, the divorce will be the catalyst for him to realize his issues and resolve them. You cannot solve his problems. No amount of support from you will resolve them until he is willing and ready to address them himself.   He will never be the man you think he can be. He will always be the man he is. If he decides to make himself into this better version, then maybe it you can try again.   He's trying to manipulate you and your emotions to get his way. If he doesn't want to communicate, write him a letter explaining exactly how you feel, and send it to him. He can chose to read it or no, but you put the ball in his court.  You haven't made a decision that has lead to divorce, he did. He made the ultimatum. He said my way or the highway, even this ""his way"" is clearly unsustainable and volatile.  The two of you can make it work...but you, by yourself, cannot. He's making it clear that he wants you to fix it."
Divorce,3czp6d,Duckfist26,4,Sun Jul 12 13:40:43 2015 UTC,"That I really am the cold, heartless, manipulative woman he believes me to be.     That's something that he has probably convinced you of. I don't know you, but I bet you're not the person he makes you out to be.    Look, he needs to really hit rock bottom and get help. Perhaps when he gets the signed divorce papers he'll make a serious pursuit of fixing his depression issues in therapy...    Or he may go the suicide route, leave a note blaming you for everything.    You need to be at a place emotionally where you are prepared to deal with the consequences of leaving him, come what may.    The problem here is that you've been in a dysfunctional relationship for so long that you've come to accept it as normal.    It's not.  The very fact that you're hedging on staying or leaving tells me that you've got some co-dependency issues.    You've accepted his behavior (blame, his bad inconsistency and attitude on employment, alcohol abuse, ) for far too long.    Here's the normal route: Sign the divorce papers and send them back to him. You'll know you did the right thing when you'll meet a normal, responsible man who takes responsibility for his life and actions.  Someone without mental health issues.    I speak from personal experience.    I'm divorcing a borderline personality soon to be ex wife who has been in denial about her issues for 7 years.    I've given and given and given until I could not give anymore (and until there was nothing left for me to give financially) After dealing with my co-dependency issues and detaching emotionally from her (getting over her) I see her for who she truly is. She is a parasite and a leech, externalizing the darkness, the black hole in her soul that will never ever be filled, unloading the darkness on those closest to her.    While I was with her, the last 4 years of our 7 year marriage I was not happy.  I was dying on the inside and the outside. She was abusive verbally, emotionally and physically. I know now that the only things keeping me with her was my co-dependence to her and my devotion to  keeping the marriage together for the sake of our two young kids.    After separating, I've met someone new.  She has her life in order.  She's sane. She's supportive.  180 degree difference.  I can't tell you how good it can get with someone sane and normal.    Put it this way: With my ex, I was walking on eggshells, carefully considering my every action to ensure there would not be any blowback from her. Even then, it didn't matter since she would make up reasons to blame me, give me ultimatums, put me on a never ending treadmill of trying to make her happy, each challenge harder on me than the last (increasing expectations) I tried so hard and so often to make her happy, but every time I succeeded in completing one of her challenges, I was met with indifference and a ""That's all you've done? Can't you go over and above and do more? What a worthless husband I have!!!"" attitude. It got to the point where every one of my victories was met with a slap in the face from her. I know now that she diminished who I am, she wanted to snuff me out, my aspirations, my goals, my spirit, to break me and make me into her slave.    Now that the co-dependency glasses are off and I see her for who / what she truly is, I can only say that I feel sorry for her, that she's stuck in hell here on earth, with no way out. She doesn't deserve me. Never did. She continues to be a parasite on me though, using our kids to squeeze money out of me via support and alimony while simultaneously unloading on the kids. I can't get my kids out of her care since there is no physical trauma on their bodies. They are emotionally traumatized though. For this I will never forgive her and if the chance does present itself for me to gain 100% custody, I will take it. I will not have any mercy on her at this point, even if she were to commit suicide.    With my normal sane girlfriend now, there are no expectations. What I do, I do out of lovingkindness not fear.  I don't watch my actions the way I used to for fear of blowback. I am truly free What I do when I'm together with my normal sane girlfriend, I find I have a completely different motivation for doing the things I do for her, it's not just to make my girlfriend happy, it's because seeing her happy and returning my lovingkindness makes me happy. We spoil each other with love and that's normal and wonderful. The way it should be. I feel like she amplifies my actions, amplifies my flame, my being. I am not only whole, I am more than whole, I find that I shine brighter than ever, that my happiness makes her happy, we make each other happy. The way it should be. The way it was meant to be between a woman and a man.    If guilt is the only think keeping you in your marriage then leave."

Divorce,3czp6d,LaTuFu,2,Tue Jul 14 12:32:35 2015 UTC,"As much as I am not a fan of divorce, I am also not a fan of dysfunctional marriages where one person refuses to see their role in the destructive behaviors.  Say this out loud to yourself, and let me know if it makes sense to you after you've said it:  I know someone who is really unhappy.  This person has never blamed themself or wanted to look themself in the mirror and ask ""can I do anything different to change where I am with my life?""  They only blame everyone else around them, it is always someone else's fault that they are unhappy.  This person has demanded a bunch of things from me, including the potential sacrifice of my education and career.  They have not offered to do anything for me in return.  All of the risk for this change is on my shoulders, and I know in my heart that if I do this without making any requests of my own, that this person will do nothing to change their behavior or view of the world.  I also know, from past experience, that if I do this, nothing will really change, and a year from now I'll be in another state, the relationship will be virtually unchanged (at best) if not worse, and I'll no longer be in a career that I invested time and money into achieving.  Did that sound healthy and positive to you when you said it out loud?  Marriage is a rowboat with two oars.  The boat only rows properly when both spouses are rowing together in the same direction.  Right now, your husband is sitting in the bottom of the boat with his arms crossed, demanding that you row the two of you by yourself.  If it sounds exhausting to you now, wait until you try to do it for another 5-10 years.  He'll still be sitting in the bottom of that boat, still blaming you for his misery, and still expecting you to make all the changes and do all the rowing.  You'll just be that much older and that much more exhausted.    Still want to stay in that boat?"

Divorce,3czp6d,beckoning_cat,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:08 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you are feeling. I understand feeling like the bad guy, and feeling conflicted. on one hand, this person has given you more than enough reason to leave, so why do you feel so horrible? Because I have been there. And now that I am on the outside, I can shed some light on it for you.  First off, this is an abusive relationship. Emotionally and psychologically abusive. The amount of manipulation has wreaked habit on your thinking processes and wellbeing. You can't think straight, and that is exactly what they intended.  you are thinking about the good times, the times that they were nice and loving. You are thinking that since they have done it before, that there is a good person deep down inside. That if you are loving, caring, and understanding enough, you can bring that person out, and having a loving relationship. It is because of those thoughts, that you are so conflicted. You feel like you are dealing with someone who is deep down inside a good person with bad habits. That you are abandoning them.  You are worried that after all the suffering, that if you leave, then they will straighten themselves out and you missed your golden opportunity to be with a functional, loving person.   What you don't see is that every emotion, every self doubt, every question, concern, concession, was manipulated by him just so you don't leave. That is how abusers work.   If he really was a good person, then you would see that person all the time, and not just after they hurt you. They pull a serious mind fuck on you and fill you with doubt and even doubt your own sanity, because people who can think for themselves, can't leave.   Here are the facts: It will never get better. He will never treat you well, he will never get better, he will never become a nice person, he will never hold a job. And no matter how much you try to prove to him that you care, he will suck the life out of you until you die.   There is no ""more"". Never has been. This is what all it is.   Look into how abusers work and think. Study, research, and then research some more. When you have learned enough, you will actually begin to predict how he will behave and act, because it is all about manipulation.   You are not leaving a marriage. He never loved you. They are not capable of love.   The hardest part will be to learn that you are in this situation for a reason, because you are codependent, and abusers deliberately seek out those who they can make victims, the vulnerable.    The good parts are so good. There is so much potential in our relationship, but it has never, in 13 years, materialized.    There aren't any good parts. That was all a part of the manipulation tactic. There is a reason why after 13 years, nothing has changed.   After you leave you will have to learn how to un-victimize yourself. Because they need their source. And they will do anything to try to keep you, their source. Mine still tries to abuse me and I have been separated for 4 years.   Don't feel regret. He did nothing but harm you. He doesn't deserve your kindness and caring. Eventually you will feel relief at having escaped.  Abuse Sanctuary"

He got his BA for one specific goal, and then decided after he graduated that the did not want to do that anymore.  We actually had broken up for a few years post-graduation, and he lived in his home state at that time and was working in a hotel.  Later, when we lived together, he decided to go to trade school and turned out to be really good at his trade.  It was something that he could have been self-employed doing, which is something he says he wants in his life.  However, once his business partner turned in to a flake, he gave up entirely on the idea of doing that trade anymore, after spending a lot of money on school and only being in the field for six months.    I realize that I can't empathize with him on his journey to find out what his work passion is.  I have always known what I wanted to do ""when I grew up"", took steps towards that goal, and had been doing it for almost ten years.  So I don't know how it feels when you have no ideas and no direction and keep trying to find something and have it not click and be miserable.  I could have been more understanding of that.    But we couldn't pay the bills without him working somewhere, doing something.  I was also raised that paying the bills comes first, and following your dreams come second...aka, you only get to follow your dreams if you first fulfill the bare minimum of obligations towards the household; rent, food, etc.  He was raised differently, and his parents supported his soul-searching by sending him money every month while he was unemployed.    Now that he's home again, he is content to be working part time loading trucks at a warehouse.  I have no idea if he has a plan or a goal for the future in his home state, because we never get that far when we talk about it.  Only that he's found a ""good"" job, one that could turn into something more (although he's always said he hated warehouse work).    If he had a dream, and an idea of how to go about achieving it, and it required him to stay in his home state to do it, I would be much more willing to consider moving for him, like he moved for me.  But I don't see that that is the case, and I think I've lost hope that he will ever find his passion.     I do understand what you are saying and I appreciate the feedback.  It's something I've struggled with in this whole thing.  How much of his ""lack of ambition"" is due to my over-abundance of ambition, and how much is him just being lazy.  I really can't answer that."
Divorce,3czp6d,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"This subreddit throws out the ""couples counselling"" as the defacto response but what doesn't get said often is that when we all agreed to marry, we said for better/worse, rich/poor, sick/health but at the first hard time we are challenged with this, we leave. There is a reason why we say these things. They are not just words, but a commitment. We give blood relatives every chance in the book and we give them more than we give anyone else. Why aren't we doing this for our spouses? These are the people that we were going to team up for the rest of our lives. The amount you dedicated to your career, you should be dedicating for his career. It's not you and him. You are a team. Marriage is hard and we signed up for that. Don't just bail because you actually discover it actually is."
Divorce,3cytpq,megisemo,3,Sun Jul 12 00:43:45 2015 UTC,30/m nova as well. Divorce finalized in December. It's a slow road. You are going to have good days and bad days. Slowly you'll start to have more good days than bad.   The key to surviving the early days is get out of the house. Time alone will be some of your worst times. Join meet ups. You might be afraid to talk about your personal life with strangers. That's okay. These people at the meet ups don't need to know the drama outside the group. You can just have fun socialize. Throw yourself into work. Travel. Lean on your family. Whatever you have to do to avoid being alone.  After awhile slowly start to spend more time alone. You didn't make those feelings go away. You just delayed them till you were better prepared to face them. Don't be afraid to seek counseling. But if you don't actively make an effort to face this it will come back bigger and meaner and appear in unexpected ways.   Good luck out there

Wife and I were together for fourteen years, married for ten when she started an affair with one of her married clients. Within three months of me discovering it, she had moved out and the house was sold. I know exactly how you feel: it's raw, and it's brutal, and it's unrelenting. The endless questions you ask: how? why? The loss of appetite. The difficulty sleeping. I know it all and it's nothing anybody should have to go through.   I can stand here and tell you it will get better, and you will be happy again, even though it's hard to see that place from where you currently are. I picked hobbies back up that I had neglected during my marriage, put renewed energy into friendships I had let atrophy, channeled my rage and sorrow into workouts and started working on the bucket list. Do things you always wanted to, but haven't. plan trips to places you've always wanted to go. Rediscover books (like ones what got actual pages!). Rediscover you... or rather, the new improved you.   I don't know where in NoVa you are, but if you want to talk, PM me. I found that friends and family will offer unconditional love and support, but some of the most helpful conversations I had came from relative strangers, who had no knowledge of the relationship and were able to provide a different perspective: there's a power of shared experience that can help us heal as a whole."

I was lucky and found a great counselor with my initial visit, but I've heard of people on here bouncing around quite a bit until they find someone who's the right fit.  I started playing sports. I played hockey growing up, and in part of college, so I picked that up again. I spend a lot of time at the gym, and try to be outside as much as humanly possible outside of work. I've gone on more hikes this summer alone then total over the last few years. I'm sure in Northern VA there's plenty of casual sport leagues, I know a lot of people here advocate for kickball which can be fun."

Most of us go through that and yes, marriage is the way that most of us come to confront those ugly things.  What you can do: go to counseling. You would be helped to go to an individial counselor to figure out what's up with yourself--that would be a big positive step. If you wanted to make a strong move to save your marriage, you could set up a meeting with a marriage counselor and ask your wife to attend. She may already have made up her mind that she's truly done--and that's her decision to make, you need to respect that if it's her final decision. However she may take your strong move to get into counseling and take responsibility for your own failings to be a very hopeful sign, and may be willing to go with you.

If they're older (15 or older) it won't be as bad. Sorry that you're married to an un-compromising man. It sounds as if you stayed with him more out of convenience and comfort than anything. Those are not good reasons to be with someone. You kids though... I wonder and think about this. So many people out there are trapped in marriages because they have kids.  Having to deal with higher and higher levels of personal misery, sacrificing their well-being and happiness for that of the kids.  Then, once the kids are on their own, they finally leave the prison-misery marriage.    Be brave and prepare! Have you been to couples counseling? If yes, and if it's made no difference then I advise you the following:     Your unhappiness will only get worse the longer you stay in this marriage.  He will not change.  He will only become more and more of his old self as he gets older.  I'm sorry.     How I managed to be on my own: I had a great job already. I've got a post-graduate degree so I've got the education and job part covered. I found an apartment in the area where my kids go to school. I went to 2nd hand shops and got all the small things I needed to fill my kitchen cupboards. No shame in that. I slept on an air mattress. All the inconveniences of starting out anew, the living hand to mouth, that served to strengthen my resolve to leave and stay gone. I've got kids too, daughters 4 and 6 but in my case the abuse from my borderline ex got so bad that my kids are better off in a divorce situation. It's bad, but my parents help me out financially and with babysitting. At least now, my parents get to see my kids, my borderline ex kept the kids away from my parents for years at a time (the borderline ex has a feedback loop with her mentally ill mother in which they share paranoid fantasies and psychoses where they accuse loved ones of unspeakable shit)    I'm much much happier now though. It's night and day. My kids do want us to reconcile, but they see the world through kid eyes. They'll be better off with two households, at least my household will be loving and normal. For my kids to be in a one household, two parent scenario would mean that they'd see my ex abusing me verbally and physically on a daily basis and my kids would think that was a normal marriage.  They'd behave the same way in their marriages in the future. I'm not OK with that. I'm also not OK with my BPD ex kicking me out every time she has an outburst. I know she'd love to see me homeless and jobless. I'm not going to ever let that happen. I'm strong for myself and my kids."

The fact that he's still hanging out with a guy he almost cheated on you with is not a good thing. Once you break that boundary of friendship it makes it really hard to go back to ""just friends"" without letting in strong emotional attachment. Honestly the way you describe him acting it sounds like he's solidly in the affair fog, look it up.   Have you talked to him about going to see a counselor together? A lot of times we get into a place were we no longer listen to our spouse and having that neutral third party there to reinforce what our spouse is actually saying can help a lot.  Even if he's not willing to see a counselor, which isn't a great sign, you should look into finding a therapist for yourself. It helps so much to have someone you can open up to and will give you honest feedback about what you're saying/doing.

IF you are willing to fix yourself, your mental issues, your drinking and deal with why these things exist, you owe it to everyone but moreso yourself to do so.  Your marriage can recover and be stronger than ever.

I'm also not a drunk, but my somewhat secretive recreational pot use and my ex's begrudging don't-ask-don't-tell response is a pretty good illustration of how we dealt with relationship issues, which is to say we didn't.   An unexpected flood of emotions hit me about a month after the divorce was finalized and I decided to start therapy. It's been great for me so far and I wish I had been going once I hit the existential malaise of middle adulthood.

I even searched for therapists who speak English but he doesn't believe in therapy and won't go. I have depression as well and I take Vitamin D daily to help me combat it. I have offered to get him some for himself but he won't take it.

Get his stuff together like everyone else says and either tell him it's in a storage locker, or put it outside for him to get. You'll see him and be hit with a flood of emotions that will make you feel like shit. I called her names and if we weren't in a public place, probably would have yelled at her. I'm not violent, so that was never going to happen, but there was anger and resentment.  A few months later when she was picking up our sons for visitation, I tried to not say anything to her but I had to ask her a question in person, and again I got angry and raised my voice. So I only communicate via email and texts now regarding visitation, and direct everything else through my attorney.

He will be resentful and you will be angry, hurt, confused that you could have married a stranger to you now, and a host of all other kinds of emotions.

Is he going to learn to be a better person?  Do you care?  Is putting him through whatever misery you think this will cause him worth the misery you know it will cause you?  Stop defining yourself and your actions in terms of your ex and the effects it will have on him.  You'll be much better off and much happier."

You are likely going to be stuck with half of any additional debt she has accrued in the last 8 months.  File for divorce quickly to stop that debt from accumulating.

Now that the divorce is final she thinks we need to be friends and do things like share pictures and texts to update each other as to what we are doing with our son. We have split custody and my argument is that she gave that up when she left. The time I have with my son is our time, not hers. Anyways, I have asked that we limit our communication to email/texts and the occasional short phone call if we need to coordinate his needs. I feel a little guilty about it but at the same time that is not the same person I have loved for the past 13 years.

He was very selfish and always put himself first. He could not put our marriage first, and later admitted this to me.  The fact that you want to work on your marriage and that you're even on here seeking help tells me that you are trying to put her and your marriage first.

I've been there.  I spent the first six months of my marriage contemplating divorce every single day.  I researched it.  We had a LOT of bad things happen (ex wife trying to break us up, husband putting the wants of his son and ex before my needs, his lying to me about the ex-wife, finding out he wasn't truthful about being apart from an ex when we first started dating, alcohol abuse, infertility, and just last week my dog was abducted and murdered).  Then one day I made the commitment that I'm married and am going to stay married.  We are nine months in now and even through this most recent tragedy I feel we are stronger than ever.  You need marriage counseling.  It has helped us both see what we were doing wrong and how to come together and find strength in each other.  She is hurting and her first instinct is to run.  You need to chase after her for now and reassure her that you are her husband no matter what.  And set an appointment with a counselor.  Invite her, beg her to go.  If she won't then go on your own."

Divorce,3cs7j6,allwrongs,-3,Sat Jul 11 15:18:26 2015 UTC,"You're both young and have a lot to learn, from what I am reading.  She's incredibly naive and wrong to think that marriage doesn't require work on both sides.  Nothing in life is free, marriage most of all.  She's absolutely correct and justified in her position that you watching porn as a married man is wrong.  Porn is much worse than our society (and Reddit particularly) tends to think it is.  It is incredibly destructive to a committed relationship, and it is very damaging to men specifically.  She's also right about it being important to put others before self.  That is a life lesson that everyone could use, but within the context of a marriage its crucial.  If you're not willing to sacrifice your selfish wants to the greater good of your marriage, you're going to have a bad time.  (But it is important to note, this only works when both spouses are doing it.  If only one spouse is sacrificing, the relationship will be dysfunctional.)  Having said all that, I find it incredibly ironic that she's being selfish and not willing to sacrifice herself to the greater good of the marriage and figure out how to work through this.  Marriage is hard, but it isn't impossible.  It works very well when both spouses are willing to work together.  I'm sorry you're going through this, I hope the two of you are able to work through this together and come out the other side a stronger couple."
Divorce,3cs7j6,LaTuFu,2,Fri Jul 10 12:29:45 2015 UTC,"Porn can be an issue, it really depends on what type, how often, and whether it is a couples thing or an individual thing where the person is using it as a coping mechanism instead of enhancement to their love life.  And in that sense it usually is an issue.  I think the bigger thing about the porn though is whether or not they had previously had a discussion about use of porn, and whether or not an agreement had been reached.  It is a good thing to consider others before acting, but you are not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  This is a part of healthy boundaries and expressed needs (not wants) that should be maintained and respected by both spouses.  Basically it sounds like poor relationship modeling, and if she has hit this kind of crisis 7 months in to the marriage she probably was having second thoughts before the wedding even happened.  Why she didn't end things then I don't know.  But her attitude towards relationships, especially marriage, is incredibly close minded and naieve."
Divorce,3cs7j6,TheEarlShibe,0,Fri Jul 10 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, based on numerous studies, and my own experience with couples and men, I can't say that ""it really depends.""

Divorce,3cs7j6,LaTuFu,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:00:39 2015 UTC,"winning her back? I disagree with the others. If a marriage takes work you both should not be married.  Let her go.  Move on.  If a relationship takes work there is something wrong with one or both of you. There are easy relationships out there.  Try on a few more pair of shoes and you'll eventually find a comfortable pair.

(I fear that I'm becoming the ""sounds like an affair"" guy around here. But I've studied them a hell of a lot, and read hundreds if not thousands of examples of them on various forums, etc. It is amazing, for something where people are supposedly individuals and evolved, how many traits are shared in affair situations, even down to the specific excuses and lies used. The bit you have said, sadly, really fits the profile.)"

I'm about 1.5 months in. If you don't work it out, I promise it gets better. But it's a roller coaster.  Advice that I received after I moved in with my folks and she was in the house: The more you step back and give her space, the more likely she'll want to give things a shot. Let her contact you, be strong and not needy when she does contact you. Be attractive in that sense. Also, you can't drag someone to counseling.  Whatever that's worth. Obviously didn't work for me. But I begged, cried and pleaded before we separated, poured my heart out in a letter, took the blame for everything, etc. I could tell then, and it's obvious now, it drove her farther away.   Hang in there. I hope you're able to work things out. I know it's hell and it feels like your world is falling apart. Hit the gym, walk, hike, etc. The book ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle is really helping me, I'd recommend it to anyone anytime, but it's especially pertinent in this type of situation.

I went on mission for a month (I'm in the Army), and came home to a completely different person, and this person wanted a divorce.  If you still think there's a chance to settle this without a divorce, fight for it with everything you've got. You will not want to look back on this time and think that there's something else you could've done. On the other hand, you have to know when it's no longer worth it. When it finally hits you that there's nothing you could ever do to encourage her to work it out. That is a dark place to be, but believe it or not it is also the first step to moving forward.

Whether or not it becomes a court battle is up to you and your husband.  /u/saricher may have a different perspective, though.  The best thing both of you can do, since there are children involved, is seek out the help of attorneys to draft visitation and custody agreements that are agreeable for both of you.  Why do you think full physical custody is the most appropriate choice?  A lot of courts today are leaning towards 50/50 custody and visitation, unless there are circumstances that warrant different."
Divorce,3crvj7,LaTuFu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"The reason I want full is because I thought that meant he only could see her not take her for a weekend, or whatever. This is because hes a drug addict. Hes trying ro get clean bit honestly I just dont trust him.  If he does get his life together again like before I have no problem with changing the visitation agreements. And as of now I dont have a problem with my daughter staying at her grandma's with him because thwy are there to keep her safe. Also I cant afford an attorney vut I can go to the court house and get assistance from an attorney there qho givea advice and helps you with forms, etc. I plan on seeing her. Would it be wise for both my STBX and me to go see the free attorney together to come up with an agreement?"
Divorce,3crvj7,LaTuFu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"A valid reason for wanting full custody. Addicts are difficult co-parents for sure.   All the more reason to go see an attorney. If you can't afford one, contact a local church or legal aid society.   Addicts can be very selfish and unpredictable. You need to put yourself and the kids first."
Divorce,3crvj7,saricher,2,Fri Jul 10 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"California Family Law attorney here.   It is my understanding that the child lives with the parent with full physical custody but the other parent can have the child every other weekend or whatever the arrangement is.    Yes, you have that correct.  When a parent has sole (that is the term used, not full) physical custody, the primary residence of the child is with the custodial parent and the other parent can have visitation.   Also, can the child spend more time with the other parent if the parent with full physical custody agrees? For example, can the child go to the zoo during the week before the weekend when the child is supposed to go with the parent without full custody. While I'm asking, how exactly does joint physical custody work? Does the child get split up every 6 months?   Joint physical custody means that the child spends significant times with both parents.  It does NOT mean a strict ""50/50"" time share.  Your could have a time share arrangement (and please, let's call it that - saying ""custody of the child"" sounds like jail, frankly) where the child is with one parent 80% of the time and the remaining time with the other parent and still call it ""joint physical custody.""   I ask all of this because my STBX says he won't sign the papers where I said I want full physical custody and joint legal custody. He thinks he won't be able to have her to spend the night or whatever.    What are you getting him to sign?  To me as an attorney, that means an actual judgment and come on, who wants to sign one where the times he can count on being with his child is not expressly designated?  A good judgment or order spells out the time share.  Wait, let me rephrase that - a good judgment or order spells out the time when your child knows they can see their Daddy whom they love.  Just saying . . .   And for the record, he's currently homeless so if our child did spend the night with him it would have to be at his mom's. Does this change anything?   Unless Grandma regularly sacrifices small animals and children t0 the Great God Moloch on behalf of Mexican drug cartels in her home . . . no, it shouldn't.  How nice that your STBX MIL can offer that assistance to  you both, so your child can have time with his/her parents."

For people I'm not close with, I bring it up off hand and then change the subject quickly. ""Yes, it's over. Can you please tell me what you're doing tomorrow at 10am? Boss needs a meeting...""  Even if they keep talking about it, I just ignore their comments. ""Thanks, but really what do you want me to bring to your party? I make a great fruit salad...""    Except actually the last year of my relationship was hard and the divorce has been astonishingly easy, freeing, and an all around relief.   Glad I'm not the only one.

I don't know how people go months or years and stay in a relationship without communicating these things. It really baffles me. Not saying you did this, but wanting some clarity there. I think that's what happened to me."

I brought up how upset I was that he kept making big decisions without me (that we used to make together), not showing interest in spending time with me, lack of sex, financial problems, etc.  I decided to see a counselor but we ended up having a conversation and breaking up before I made an appointment.   In the end, we couldn't be what each other needed. And it sucked and was sad. But by the time we broke up I had already reached that realization, and suffered my heartache."
Divorce,3coc8q,Offthepoint,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:19:03 2015 UTC,"This is such an interesting issue, and it highlights why the Golden Rule is not adequate as an actual, enforceable rule: people want to be treated differently than you do.   When I am struggling in my relationship I welcome all the support from my compassionate, curious friends, but my husband wants to be left alone for days until he is ready to discuss.   How about telling your friends your boundaries and how they can be helpful? It might be useful for you to prepare are kind “script” for when people inevitably swarm around you with questions and consolation such as “I appreciate your concern, but I’m not in a space to talk about this very much. If you want to support me you can ______, but right now I can’t handle _________”   When your friends agree to tell other friends for you, you can include in that message a request to not initiate discussing your divorce with you. I’m glad to hear you have worked through a lot, and I hope you are finding growth from this experience."

Is she open to marriage consoling at all?   well not physically, about 2 months before telling me she wanted to leave she was in facebook contact with a friend of mine she had just met and who shares some common interests   This waves a lot of red flags. Don't underestimate an emotional affair. They're actually worse for a marriage than a purely physical affair. I know you want to trust and believe the person you love, trust me I do, I felt the same way when I suspected my STBX might be having an affair, turns out she was. Now I may be wrong, but this is definitely a red flag.   Basically she says we don't have anything in common and wants a divorce.   That's the affair fog, you don't spend 10 years with someone with whom you have 0 common interests.   I regret the ending of the marriage still though that lessons day by day, but I know that I did everything I could to restore the marriage and to fight for it while she didn't. One of the best things you can do for yourself right now is to find yourself a therapist even if she refuses therapy."
Divorce,3cnr7b,Slowlyloosinghope,5,Thu Jul 9 13:23:05 2015 UTC,"we went to a brilliant relationship counsellor together twice, and then she had 2 solo sessions and stopped. i am still seeing the counsellor every fortnight. she didn't really take any of the therapists advice though.  affair fog is an interesting term but it matches up well with the hindsight bias and confirmation bias my wife has been displaying lately when recalling events in our relationship.   edit :: is this comment really that bad or is there some sort of downvote fairy?"
Divorce,3cnr7b,Slowlyloosinghope,6,Thu Jul 9 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"If she's unwilling to go to counseling there really isn't a whole lot you can do if she doesn't want to work on the marriage.  If she is in the affair fog there is nothing you can say or do that will change her mind. I'm going to repeat that again because it took me forever to wrap my head around this, there is literally nothing you can say or do that will change her mind. She has to decide for herself to stay in the marriage and to be an active participant in the marriage. I am all for you trying everything you can to save the marriage but if she files for divorce and gets a lawyer, you would be hurting yourself not to get a lawyer to help you out.  How much have you communicated to your wife that you aren't going to be the one to initiate the divorce? Have you told her that if your marriage comes to divorce she'll be the one that files?  Here's some good questions to ask yourself:   How long are you willing to wait for her to want to work on the relationship? 6 months? 1 year? More? How do you define working on the relationship? (Counseling is a must.) What is your resolve if you find out she's having a full fledged affair with this friend or another man/woman?   If you don't know what you want for if she decides to work on the marriage than it's going to be hard to show her how committed you are to working on the marriage and that being the only option for you.  Again having resolve and commitment is great but you cannot have a marriage where only 1 person is working on it, or is committed to it. If your wife never chooses the marriage it is over, even if there isn't a piece of paper saying it is.  About your edit, it happens sometimes, there's some interesting people that troll around here."

Divorce,3cnr7b,Justkeepbreathing123,3,Thu Jul 9 11:50:30 2015 UTC,"You're not asking for the divorce - why would you regret it? You might feel sad about it or wish that it would be different, but the only choice you have is how you react.  I was/am in a similar situation. I didn't expect it, didn't have a big fight, reasonably confident there were no affairs. It's natural to look for a cause and when one isn't readily apparent, it's very unsettling.    The question you have to ask is whether knowing would actually change anything about the situation.   Regret comes from looking backwards. Make it your goal to start to look forward even if only for a few moments at a time. It'll get easier and better with time."
Divorce,3cnr7b,papassinqueso,3,Thu Jul 9 16:23:12 2015 UTC,"After 10 years she should know all your best and worst sides. She may not be ready or mature to be married. Maybe she just married in autopilot withouth thinking it right. Its hash buy maybe she dosnt really love you and it was just routine.    In my case we had been dating fo over 10 years, after getting married our problems started after 3 months and she started talking about divorce because she had different expectations in her mind of what it would be. She didnt tell me of all the things she expected until married and i just wasnt able to deliver.   A year and a half later i filled for divorce and 6 months after that she left. There were really no affairs, alcohol or phisical violence involved.   I loved her a lot and miss her but right now i dont regret the divorce and it was the best choice. She just wasnt mature, ready and really in love to be married with me. Those 2 years of marriage were really hard, i was really depreseed and sad. Now i feel free and happy..   I dont regret my decision because i know i did everything it was in my hands to work on the relatonship. Sometimes you cant fix something that is broken or that even it wasnt working at first.   Try to talk, to communicate and counsel. If that dosnt work, for the sanity of both of you move on.   You will be ok. You will learn new things.  It will be hard as you have been with her a lot of time and you may feel empty but you must learn to live with yourself and grow as a person."

You can't be the only one trying to fix the relationship. That doesn't solve anything. You will eventually grow to resent that you are the onlybone trying, and tbh you deserve someone who loves you just as much as you love them - not someone who would throw away 10 years."

Please take my advice because it seems like you've made up your mind already. And you're just looking for someone to agree with you despite all the evidence to the contrary.   You fight for a marriage when both people want to be with each other. For example: your mom doesn't like her and won't give her blessing  You don't fight for a marriage when only one person wants to be married and is making all the effort. Do you see the distinction here?  These next words are going to be painful, but there IS somebody else.

I am now trying to accept the reality that if one statement, one gesture, one moment, basically whatever ""WYZ"" is, was all it took to change my spouses mind back, how stable is their commitment?   I can sympathize with what you are going through. I am also a newlywed, and my spouse asked me for a divorce at our 6 mth mark. We have been best friends for over 13 years.

I have thresholds of what I will and wont tolerate, and he doesn't get a free pass just because he is my spouse and/or upset.  I have resolved to simply take accountability for where I have not communicated clearly, or failed to be receptive to his needs. Basically so I know I can walk away (if it comes to that) knowing that I was the best I could be, both as a person and spouse, and we just weren't compatible."

You can fight to help your wife see her viewpoint is bad and work together to build a better marriage.  You have been with her a long time.  Praying ways will suck.  Fighting to stay will make it such less (IMHO) because if you do split, you will look back knowing you tried.  To be, that is worth knowing.

I used to think that it was a knock on me, but then one woman I was talking to at work talked about meeting a guy and she said, ""He's been married, that's a good thing.  At least he was willing to commit."""
Divorce,3cmn3u,papassinqueso,2,Thu Jul 9 02:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, and always talk with possitive attitude towards dating and relationships. Dont let the divorce define you. Its just an experience that made you more mature and wiser.   Also, keep it neutral. Dont start with ""that bitch"" and instead use a more tactical ""we werent made fo each other"" or ""we had irreconcilable differences, but hey, i learnt how to cook!""."

However you may still be entitled to alimony (spousal support) based on financial dependency although it may be short term.

Ask your lawyer about filing a restraining order which would prevent him from spending money beyond basic expenses and from taking you off the phone plan, insurance and so on.  He cannot just cut you off, but it sounds like he will if you do not get legal help.  You won't get much, but you should at least get some alimony to help you get on your feet again."

There are no absolute legal rights. Sounds like neither you, nor husband really has any money.   He can not cut you off from any shared assets acquired during marriage, and there may a small chance of spousal support, this depends on his ability to pay, and your ability to work, your ages, and the length of the marriage. In a nutshell you may need the money, but if he can not pay it, there is not a lot to pursue."

Regardless of the length of your marriage and wether he wants to admit it you can get alimony.    It's just a little too convenient for him."

Any money that I had saved is gone because I paid for anything I needed. Never asked him for any help since we moved. I mean if the roles were reversed, and he was the one that needed the money and I was the one wanting the divorce.. would at least give him some to help him out getting back on his feet because it would seem like the right thing to do.

Divorce,3cko2q,TheEarlShibe,2,Wed Jul 8 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"One of the problems with watching a loved one die is that you can't truly mourn their loss until they're dead.  Until then it's always a bit of a holding pattern as stress builds up etc.  So it's not shocking that, now that it's over, you're really feeling it.  I don't expect it will last long, it was something that was going to happen regardless of what you wanted, and you've had a good while to accept that I hope.  Maybe the reason I took it less harshly is because this was my second divorce, and I knew what to expect?  Anyway, again I'm sorry you're hurting over this today.  However it's final, and you can truly finally move on with the rest of your life and making an awesome time of it.  Give yourself today to mourn, tomorrow get up and do work."

I'm sure the reality of the outcome was a rude awakening compared to the fantasy her attorney sold her.  The spousal support is 1/10 of what she was demanding and for 1/3 as long. Instead of my having supervised visitation with 0 overnights, we have equal custody. She washed out of her dream career that I helped set her up in and is currently unemployed. And the financial settlement will barely cover her attorney's bills.  She's not smirking now."
Divorce,3cllos,JVorhees,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:47:36 2015 UTC,"This I find interesting. In my situation, my wife is 100% financially dependent on me (stay at home mom, 6 years) At first, when I was totally emotionally de-railed, she knew she had control emotionally. she was convinced she could get me to leave our house and still pay the bills while she would get a job, new place, car, ect. All within a month. (That was actually her response when I asked) but as soon as I regained control of myself, and hence the situation, she seemed to come down a few notches and has got a big reality check. She hasn't shown any indication of reconsidering the split, but I suspect once we've crossed the point of no return, the story will be similar to yours."
Divorce,3cllos,JVorhees,3,Thu Jul 9 01:58:13 2015 UTC,"My wife has always been financially naive despite my trying to get her involved in our budgeting and planning. Even worse for her, she hired a notoriously bitchy attorney who is supposed to be intimidating but is such a moron at math, she wound up making enough mistakes to more than cover my attorney's fees. Had my wife discussed the divorce with me, she would have saved all that money and I would have proposed a better settlement than where we ended up.  She treated me pretty shitty before and during our divorce so on the one hand I don't really feel bad about her impending financial situation but on the other hand if she doesn't get it together she's going to be a burden on our child in her old age and I know I'll be the one to have to bail her out."
Divorce,3cllos,JVorhees,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:18:20 2015 UTC,"This is also my concern.

So her financial situation becomes a burden on my children. Their quality of life is going to change drastically because of her selfishness. That's what makes this real tough."

She never really did acknowledge her mistakes, but she definitely did realize that she did in fact want to be married to me. The week that the judge was set to sign the decree, she finally had an epiphany that she was making a mistake (she was the filer). She asked to reconcile (without apology, or admitting to her wrongs), but I told her it was too late. Honestly, at that moment, I did have a smug sense of justice about me,, it kind of felt good.  But then life goes on, years go by. My ex-wife has been completely unsuccessful in making any kind of meaningful connection with another man, and she's had a parade of knuckleheads enter and exit my kid's lives over the years. When she has a few drinks, I can expect inappropriate texts telling me that she'll love me forever, and that she'd marry me a thousand times, etc, etc, etc. All while I've been in an incredible relationship with my new SO, since the year after my divorce.

Divorce,3clpgp,JohannReddit,4,Wed Jul 8 21:53:20 2015 UTC,Your lawyer works for you. Literally any time is a good time.
Divorce,3clpgp,GrandEthos,2,Wed Jul 8 22:01:07 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you expect your lawyer to do if you don't want to go to court and your STBX refuses mediation.
Divorce,3clpgp,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:03:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry, guess I should have said that better.  At first, I was trying my best to keep this out of court.  But now it's dragging on and on and it seems like all my lawyer wants to do it draw up proposals and hope they finally accept it.  I'm totally ready for court even though it's going to break the bank for me.  Worth it to make sure I have an equal stake in raising my kids though."
Divorce,3clpgp,rasconjon,2,Thu Jul 9 01:50:28 2015 UTC,Drawing up settlement agreements that are getting rejected for months on end will break the bank more then court.
Divorce,3clpgp,Someguywhoneedshelp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:24:52 2015 UTC,"Go to court. I'm on the other side from you - the one thing we DID agree on was custody, but everything else is BS. So after giving my stbx way more time, and opposing counsel not even agreeing to set a court date, I'm going to court tomorrow to set a date for the trial. STBX thinks I'm going to blink, but I've got everything working in my favor."
Divorce,3clpgp,bradbrookequincy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Go straight to court as soon as possible. Anyone who describes your kids as ""your beautiful little"" kids will show well to the judge and you should get fair treatment. Make it clear you tried for months to get an agreement but you refuse to give up your kids."
Divorce,3clpgp,DeltaTangoWhiskey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"First, get an interim Order that spells out when you get the kids.  In most places they feel that the best person to watch a child is a parent.  That means you should be the choice for day care if you are available and willing.  Second, get an honest assessment from a lawyer.  Yours or a different one.  What can I expect in this situation?  Make a decision to pursue custody or not.  Third, if the parties cannot settle, then you take it to the judge.  It doesn't sound like you two are even close.  Tell the lawyer to take it to the judge.  Ask them to outline the steps that will occur and when they will happen - you need better communication.  If you have had minimal contact for the last 7 months and the kids are doing well, the Court might just ask why they would upset this situation.    I am a TV lawyer."

It's now nearly a year since that first consultation, the retainer is about gone, and the only thing that has been decided is custody. I'm even going to court to set a trial date because opposing counsel couldn't even agree to that. My stbx had quite a few secrets she kept from me that are slowly trickling out, and she tried the same thing, ""Let's work out the financials without lawyers."" My attorney STILL hasn't received discovery documents from my stbx that I turned over in April to opposing counsel.  I'm not saying your situation is the same as mine, but as Rule #1 here says, don't take advice from her or her lawyer. Talk to a lawyer yourself."

Divorce,3clhdv,LeezardQueen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:04:46 2015 UTC,"I continued to trust my ex in our divorce, she choose to nickel and dime me in terms of our joint accounts.   I was foolish. About a year before separation, when she lead me to believe she wanted to remain married, she set up joint checking and savings accounts at a new bank and had me switch my direct deposit.  My ex never closed the old accounts leaving a chunk of money in them, the money in these accounts was used to fund her separation a year later. My ex prepaid a lot of things and this prepayment was not disclosed during mediation."
Divorce,3clhdv,rasconjon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:06:41 2015 UTC,"If she's consulting a lawyer you should as well. If nothing more than to know your rights.  It's great to say you want to end things amicably and without a lot of cost, but having a lawyer, or at least knowing who to call will help if you can't work it out between yourselves."
Divorce,3clhdv,LeezardQueen,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:21:53 2015 UTC,Don't I sort of hold the higher moral ground if I don't resort to lawyers and such?  Does the court see that at all?
Divorce,3clhdv,Catcherofsouls,2,Thu Jul 9 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"The court does not look at morals, especially in a no-fault state. Do you want to get bent over? Your wife/STBX is preparing... You should prepare too unless you want to get blindsided.   YOU might think the two of you can come up with a plan that doesn't screw each other... She might want to do nothing but put the screws to you. Cover your ass. Get a lawyer."
Divorce,3clhdv,anderson_buck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:28:51 2015 UTC,As far as I know hiring a lawyer has nothing to do with morals. It's just about protecting yourself. Divorce can be tricky and if the other party has a lawyer and you don't then you may be shooting yourself in the foot.  It's not (or it shouldn't be) an offensive thing to look after your best interests.  To do that you need someone in the field who knows the divorce laws.
Divorce,3clhdv,Justkeepbreathing123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:49:47 2015 UTC,No.   Don't mistake the business deal of divorcing with a moral event.

In fact, the judge might be annoyed by you wasting his time when you show up in his courtroom not knowing the legal system and how it works. Her lawyer will use it as his chance to eat you alive if it gets that far."
Divorce,3ckitm,daydreamer1989,6,Wed Jul 8 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe you should get some therapy to help you with that closure.  Otherwise your arm is gonna get awfully tired holding that torch up for someone who couldn't reciprocate your feelings."

Divorce,3ckitm,daguro,3,Wed Jul 8 17:23:49 2015 UTC,I've been in therapy for 3 months now. I've made progress in some ways but I am still working on trying to get closure.
Divorce,3ckitm,TheEarlShibe,3,Wed Jul 8 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"The idea of closure is nice,  but it's not an end point.  The truth is, you have a right to be angry at the person.  Even if you love them.  You have the right to feel wronged by them.  Even if you love them.    You shouldn't be willing to destroy your life to take them back.  It is their job to prove their worth to you even as a friend, let alone a lover, friend, and confidant...  By holding onto that torch, you help keep yourself from feeling the pain of letting go, and that pain is necessary for you to heal and move on.  Leave that wound open long enough and it will fester and become infected.  I'm glad you're getting therapy.  That's awesome!  Are you doing other things to help you move on too?  Exercise, new hobbies, new music, new friends?  Have you sat down and considered that maybe he did you a favor in divorcing you?  That you're now free to move on with who you want to be instead of who ""we"" want to  be?"
Divorce,3ckitm,TheEarlShibe,2,Wed Jul 8 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"I joined a gym right away and have been going 4-5 days a week. I am definitely in the best shape I have been in since college. I just started trying film photography. I am actually going to have my first roll of film developed this week.. so that is exciting!  My friends really disliked my STBX and while at times they have been great to talk to, sometimes the conversation turns into a bashing session and that just isn't in my nature. I also am afraid of them getting sick of me bringing him up, so I've been relying on talking to my dad, my therapist and reading posts here.  I actually have not yet been able to fully grasp that he might have done me a favor in divorcing me. This actually just came up in my last therapy session. Thank you for reminding me of this. If anything I would like this situation to make me a stronger and better person and I am trying to stay positive.. it's just hard for me sometimes to let go of the person that I thought he was."
Divorce,3ckitm,ketzyk,3,Wed Jul 8 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  You're doing really awesome!  What I've done is when my friends start to bash my ex, I tell them to stop.  If they have something to say, keep it civil.  Otherwise just let me vent when I need to vent.  I'm not asking for them to join in, or defend me, or defend my ex.  I just need to vent my frustration.  It takes a while to grab hold of with both hands, but you get to be whomever you want.  You get to reinvent yourself and get rid of old baggage you don't need to be carting around.  You get to start over with a clean slate and move forward with what you want in your life instead of worrying how what you want may not align with what they want.  Yes, it sucks you couldn't manage to do that together.  And people have a way of surprising you and disappointing you that can show you that sometimes you really didn't know them at all.  Ultimately what we think of as ""knowing"" the other person is really just what they choose to show us via words, expressions, and actions.  There's a lot going on in the back of their mind that we never see."

Divorce,3cjrvp,Belushimcc,4,Wed Jul 8 13:32:59 2015 UTC,"As much as I am not a proponent of the ""wait a few years"" theory of post-divorce dating, 5 months really is not long enough to process the emotions you've been going through.  Don't worry about what your ex thinks. Easier said than done, I know, but the sooner you can let that go the better off you'll be.   Give yourself more time and more importantly give yourself a break."
Divorce,3cjrvp,GrandEthos,3,Wed Jul 8 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"It takes a really long time to put away your feelings for a spouse.  Even when you're angry at them.    I think the thing is, you're ready for dating but you're  not ready for a relationship.  I can tell you that the women I'm dating are great, but I can tell I'm just not where I'm ready to emotionally connect with anyone on a deep level.  That doesn't mean there is anything wrong with who I am dating, it's not their fault I'm not there...  And I tell them I'm not there."

Divorce,3cj1aw,Mel-Syd,5,Wed Jul 8 08:06:26 2015 UTC,"My favourite bit.  If you know that a relationship is not good for you, stick to your guns. No matter what promises are made, they will be broken. Don't let your wishful thinking, your guilt, your sorrow or your empathy lead you down another dead end path. People don't change overnight.  Unless you've learned some new skills, or your partner has been really working the program in therapy, if you go back with your abusive partner, it is only a matter of time before the relationship goes right back to where it was, or becomes worse. Know that you will wake up one day and find yourself in the same hole you are in today, but deeper. If you run your life with your head instead of your heart, you will emerge stronger, wiser, and more self-confidant.  Now is the time to learn from your mistakes. Above all, learn to listen to yourself and take your own good advice."
Divorce,3cj1aw,yawie99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:46:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't characterize my relationship as abusive, but as one who emotionally detached from his ex-wife for a few years before having an affair during the final year of our marriage, I certainly inflicted a lot of pain. No matter how one describes my own situation, though, I enjoyed the column, as I have been wrestling with the ""Loss of Reality or Fantasy?"" question for the last few weeks.   Our legal proceedings went quickly—maybe too quickly—and the divorce is still less than a couple of months old, but I feel like I'm being pulled in several directions: remorse and regret over my past, excitement but anxiety about the possibility of an enduring relationship with The Other Woman, and contemplation of an alternative future with my ex. It's that feeling of ""What might have been?"" that makes this so tough."
Divorce,3cj1aw,WeWantBootsy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:01:38 2015 UTC,"Wow. That was exactly what I needed to hear today. My ex-wife was extremely abusive during the marriage and treated me in a way that was very unkind. She's back now making many promises of change after one therapy session.   It's hard on me because I believed all those promises once and gave her chance after chance, so part of me wants to believe it's different this time even though I know it's not.   I just spoke to her this morning, actually, and she's insisting everything changed and I don't believe her, but I want to."
Divorce,3ciqq1,Paradoxlife,3,Wed Jul 8 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"Situations are not always the same, but my STBX thought she was replacing me with someone, in her mind at the time, who was better in every way. Now the reality of the situation is that she was absolutely wrong and she even realizes how messed up her thinking was at that time but that is what happened.  The reality is that you are being replaced as that intimate connection in that persons life. It's also reality that that's not necessarily a better thing for them, nor is it a statement on your inadequacies as a person. Yes they're replacing you because they feel there's some need that they don't have and because of the excitement of new love all the things they may be lacking that you have take a back seat because they don't see the wrongs at this point.  All they see are the rights.   The real lesson from all of this is don't define yourself or weigh your self worth on the actions of another person. If you cannot find who you are on your own, or be happy with who you are on your own then you have to work on yourself because if you rely on other people for your base happiness, you'll always lose. This doesn't mean other people can't make you happy or feel good about yourself, just that those people shouldn't be the basis for that."

Feeling isolated and alone is normal, especially because it's just happened.  So what now?  Grieve, cry, listen to music. Get your emotions out (in a rational way away from the ex and kids).  Give yourself a few weeks of that if needed. Then pick up your socks and figure out what YOU want out of the divorce.  Don't forget to shower and brush your teeth every day. Even if you do that and go back to bed. It seems dumb but keeping just the tiniest routines going will help.  Also look into personal therapy.  A lot of us find it's helped.  Also the obligatory delete fb, hire a lawyer and hit the gym. (I did only one of those lol) Remember we are here to listen if needed. You'll be ok. It just may not seem that way right now."

I wouldn't agree to mediation (you both use the same attorney) as I did that with my ex and she used the fact that I still cared about the relationship to coax the agreement in her favor in a couple different ways.  With regard to the kids, assuming you're a good person, most often the court assess things fairly and you'll end up with some form of 50/50 custody or close to it.  Seriously, though, lawyer up, you'll have someone that can explain the process to you and at least that part wont be so scary."

Took a little more time then finally met a really nice woman that likes my kids and I hers and we started dating and have been together a little over two years.  The pain will take some time.  I don't know a lot of the details of what you're going through but I will share this thought with you, try not to burden your friends and family with your divorce.  Give yourself a week, two at most, to really let it all out there then try and reel yourself in.  You can burden friendships only so much before people just don't want to hear from you anymore.

Either way it will happen, and just one is more painful than the other."

I'm not gonna downvote you, but I think anger is a perfectly acceptable emotion during divorce, and yeah I said that I would love, honor, and cherish that guy. I did. He said that stuff too. Unfortunately there was an expiration date on that shit that I wasn't aware of.   That 'war' that I went thru with my ex taught me a lot about myself. I mean I've always considered myself smartish, but my evil mind fuckery game is on a genius level. I am impressed with the things I can say and do when pushed too far. I know I can take levels of emotional pain that I didn't even think were possible. Maybe that's me being broken or something (that's what therapy is for), but I don't really feel bad for much of what I said or did. Was it fucked up? Unquestionably. But it's to late to make it right, and I probably wouldn't if I could.  (haha I got to quote the Dixie Chicks). I think my divorce and the crap that we went thru was exactly what I needed to be where I am now."

I'm still paying for things because the divorce is still pending, and since it's a thing but amicable, I do the bare minimum to comply. Which is why my spite gives me some joy. When I stop paying for het stuff, and she starts paying a full amount of child support, I will sleep better. Mainly because I can then quit my second job!!"

Divorce,3cfg9v,Catcherofsouls,3,Tue Jul 7 15:41:27 2015 UTC,I disagree with your blanket assertion.   There are times when it has to become a war or at least a battle for survival.   Maybe your ex wants to move across the country or an ocean with the kids?   Maybe they wants way more money than is reasonable or fair.   Or maybe they're calling in false domestic abuse complaints.    No sometimes going to war is necessary.

So now with the divorce, she claims that marital debt she didn't agree to she shouldn't take 50%. But some assets that were purchased during separation? Oh, those things she DOES want. That's not how it works. You want to split assets, you have to also split debt. And if you don't want debt generated since the separation, you don't get assets purchased since separation either. I was willing months ago to be amicable. But I keep finding out how much she lied to me, so it's hard to be amicable any more."

Unfortunately in a lot of situations, my own included, the person we loved doesn't exist anymore.  My ex became an even meaner person, especially since we can't agree on custody, support or if the sky is blue.  Then he started falsely accusing me of abuse and made up stories of our marriage that didn't exist.  I don't know him at all anymore.  I try to put into perspective that he is a person with his own feelings and views but that doesn't give him a free pass to shit on me and drag me through years of court because he doesn't want me in his life anymore.  I wish things could have been nice between us but the minute I asked a lawyer for advice I was told I was slandering him and would pay dearly. So I guess what I'm saying is it would be nice if we could all get along. Unfortunately it takes two and if one of the people involved is determined to ""win"" at any cost it's not going to happen."

And the skirmishes begin some time before separating. I should not have attempted to approach my divorce from a place of compassion and understanding, my ex decided that she no longer wanted to be married or to be mutual or to be interdependent.

Someday I may feel differently but for now this is what I need to heal.

Divorce,3cgrjb,Passerby6,13,Tue Jul 7 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"I assume these are friends he had pre-divorce, right?  And, by housewarming, my understanding is that they are coming over to see his new home post-divorce and to reaffirm their friendship with him after the couple has split.   I think (I do not know) but I think that the reason he'd prefer you not to attend is that it is just too much change at once. This is the first time his friends are coming to see him as single and a separate unit. They are seeing his new life, his new house, which in his mind solidifies him as divorce and separate from his wife in this social way on top of a legal way.   If he brings you, not only are they going through the whole social act of continuing their friendship with him post-divorce, not it is ALSO about his new girlfriend. That's a lot of change and complication to heap on one event. So it makes a kind of sense to me that he'd want to do one thing (the new house) separate from the whole new girlfriend issue on top of that.   I totally get why you're feeling hurt. It feels like he's socially isolating you. But you might re-frame it as him trying to be supportive of you, and you being asked to support him, by not throwing you in the middle of this incredibly intense social moment for the first time meeting his friends."

I guess a housewarming is a whole new animal.  I just don't want to seem like a pushover.  Thanks so much."
Divorce,3cgrjb,LaTuFu,3,Tue Jul 7 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"These things go in stages.  Divorce is an all too familiar reality in military circles, so there is a good chance this is just a ""closure"" moment with his friends before moving on (with them) to a new chapter in his life.  Assuming you guys continue to date, there will be some sort of ""she's the new person in my life"" function that is more or less your introduction to this group.  That's probably another 3-6 months from now at least.  And please don't take offense to this, but if you are the first person he has dated since getting separated, I completely understand why he didn't invite you to attend.  The divorce just finalized and you've only been dating 3 months.  He has no idea where your relationship is going, among other reasons.  I also get why you're feeling hurt, but I understand the dynamics at work here, too."

Divorce,3cgrjb,TheEarlShibe,6,Tue Jul 7 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"This is one of the unfortunate pitfalls of dating someone who is going through a divorce.  The emotional healing that people need to go through often causes them to make decisions that seem irrational or insensitive to people around them.  It is one reason why most people are advised to steer clear of dating people who are in the middle of a divorce.  ""newly divorced"" is another way of saying ""still dealing with it and therefore possibly emotionally unavailable.""  It sounds like he's unavailable to you right now."

If I jumped into one I'd not only end up hurting myself, but whomever I was dating as well.  I too am considering the who to invite to the housewarming party, and currently none of the women I am dating are on the invite list.  I need to re-establish friendships with mutual friends after my divorce, and I really don't want the drama of introducing a new person to my friends who may have strong feelings about the divorce still on one side or the other.  It literally has nothing to do with whom I'm dating.  Hell, one of the women I'm dating met my parents, and I'm honestly not all that sure how I feel about that...  But he introduced you to his best friend, and their significant other.  That's not a casual thing one does.  As for whether or not your relationship is doomed?  I can't say."

There's nothing wrong with asking for clarificaiton on where you stand, even if the answer you receive back is ""It's complicated.""  Did he actively tell you that you were not invited, or are you assuming that you are not?  Maybe he forgot to ask you, or maybe in the stress of things he thought he already had, or assumed you would be showing up.

Divorce,3cgrjb,barstow84,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"""Noone can make you feel inferior without your consent""   One of the harder lessons that I have learned is that is am 100% responsible for my own feelings and reaction and mine alone. His behaviors may result in your feeling inferior but he cant make you feel anything that you don't allow yourself to feel, and those negative feelings are something internally that you have to process through. Why would not being including result in the diminishing of your self worth? Try switching your internal dialogue.  -If he doesn't want you there than it is his loss because he may be missing out on a great interaction opportunity with his friends -Don't allow your self to want to be some where that you aren't wanted. You are worth more than that!  Lastly, the best thing that you can do for any relationship (romantic, platonic, family, etc) is to communicate clearly. Don't assume that he doesn't want you think you are or aren't a couple unless he says it point blank ""I don't want you to think of us as a couple"". Stating your feelings and opinions are only rude if done with an inappropriate tone or bad timing. Approach the topic when you can both be actively engaged to the conversation and simply tell him ""Hey, although I enjoy hearing about what you have going on in your life. I feel minimalized and unimportant when you discuss the housewarming party but I haven't been included in the guest list. If you would prefer that I am not in attendance, please respect that I would like to not discuss it further, because it stirs up negative feelings for me.""   Hope this helps, good luck!"

I know it's a balm to the soul to think about finding someone else when you're lonely and feeling shitty about being rejected by your spouse, but dating is the LEAST of your concerns right now.    Keep yourself busy to deal with the loneliness.  Start a new hobby, join a gym, go to meetup groups to make new friends.  It's going to suck for a while, because you'll still have to go home to an empty house.  But eventually, it will become the new normal.  Not ideal, but not painful either.    The upshot of getting involved in new hobbies and making new friends is that eventually, when you are ready to date, you've got a larger social circle to potentially meet someone.  There's always online dating.  Picking up girls at a club is not your only option.  Again, now is not the time, but I'm telling you this just to reassure you that when it is the time, there are other options."

Things that have helped me, and lots of others are as follows:  Personal Therapy  Exercise  Finding new hobbies  Making new friends (Meetup.com)  Being mindful of self-care and self-love  Listening to new music (No old emotional associations)  And repeatedly telling myself that this too shall pass.  As for dating?  I've had a good amount of luck with OK Cupid, Meetup.com can help you as well.  I'm not a drinker, I'm not a partier, and I'm actually kind of shy in person until I warm up to you.  So starting a conversation online is easier, and when you finally move to meet them in person you know that they already like you/are interested enough to engage you face-to-face over dinner, or drinks, or whatever.  But you're not ready to date, and you won't be ready for a serious relationship for a good while.  So take it from me, the twice divorced 40 year-old, life doesn't end at divorce.

When the child support stuff was set up through the state, they looked at that and saw that I had made no payments since March (which would have been impossible since that 'date' wasn't agreed to until the week before the papers were signed on June 3) so I was 4mos behind in payments before I could even make one."

Divorce is tough on all kids, but especially on preschoolers and teenagers. It's no picnic for young adults, either: age 18 is not a finish line. You'll have to make your own decisions but 5 and 12 might be a lot better.  In the meantime, stop buying into your wife's rules. You might find things change when you insist on being treated with respect and when you take your own actions according to your own decisions. Start with your own counselor if you can't see how to do this and keep your cool and your equilibrium. She is not your boss. Her screaming need not affect you any more than any child's tantrum. Standing up for yourself may actually fix your relationship, but even if it breaks it, well, it sounds broken already."

You've got learned helplessness. It's how prisoners are broken during war. You need to start doing things for yourself and having little victories.   Start going to counseling. Please. For your sake and that of your kids. What kind of example are you setting for them? Either that it's ok to be beaten down, or that it's ok to beat someone down. If you can't start making positive strides for yourself, make the strides for your kids. You might think they don't notice but they do. Do you want them to end up in the same situation as you?   You need to take control of your life a little bit at a time.   Step 1. Go to counseling  Step 2. Start doing things to improve yourself, whether it's read a book, take the stairs instead of the elevator, anything  Step 3. Eventually stand up for yourself, even a little.   You can move forward. You can free yourself from even the worse situation. All it takes is a little push, a little forward momentum and it can build until you reach a place where you're happy. You can't be an effective and positive role model for your kids unless you're there. So please, just take that first baby step. Just call a counselor."

To be fair though, I tried talking it out with her, we had this big argument about what would happen when I needed to go visit HQ (with the work from home job) and my wife said ""well, you can just tell them when you can go"".  And i said ""yeah, well I need to be able to go when they want me to.""

I'm sure there are people who you know that have done a divorce in NY that can help. You can probably get a consultation with a lawyer for free, like 30 minutes, and you could ask them. The packet should provide enough information on what to do that it may not even be necessary to speak with one.

Divorce,3ccqy2,airplaneq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:30:41 2015 UTC,"May I ask how you went about having the conversations?   Well she wanted the divorce and totally sprung it on me so you can imagine how I have felt through this whole process, like a train wreck. The first week I was still living at the apartment and then I couldn't handle being there and neither could she so I moved to my Aunt's house. I had told her that we needed to get this over with ASAP which she agreed. She is the one who started all the paperwork, I am not home much because of work in the summer. We did schedule a time to meet at the apartment after she had gone through the paperwork to see what we needed to do. I kept my composure as much as I could and left when I could no longer hold my feelings in and went back at it the next day.   Should I tell him that I am going to start the paperwork and we need to divide everything?   Yes, you will want to do it together though, both of you should have an idea of who gets what prior to filling out the paperwork. You will probably redo the packet a few times before you are both ready for a notary. I wouldn't spring it on your STBX especially if you are both willing to do this.   Did you have a list of questions or things to cover? Like I have medical debt. Do we have to spell that out in the divorce that I will be responsible for my own debt?   I'm sure the packet will cover this question but yes every dollar must be accounted for whether it is in your name or his, whether it is money accrued prior to the marriage or not. It is difficult to decide who gets what debt and that is something that you need to figure out which will be the hardest part, loans, liens, credit cards, assets, etc. But, the debt should be balanced by the amount of assets each person is getting.   Do we have to spell that out in the divorce that I will be responsible for my own debt?   Yes you will spell out exactly how much of what debt you will be taking and how much your STBX will be taking.

We were together for seven years, married for five, and basically I contemplated and cried to myself for at least a year on whether or not I could bear to get divorced. We tried tons of marriage counseling. I read many books. After that year I had finally come to terms with my feelings and decided I couldn't do it anymore. We've solved most issues without need for lawyers, including custody and visitation. Overall I feel pretty good. I've lived on my own for nine months now. Haven't really cried at all.  The main negative emotion I feel is not sadness, but bitterness. ""I wasted so much of my time with him"" kind of thing. I'm mainly bitter at myself for staying so long. That was stupid of me."

Divorce,3cdo5r,doobynooby,4,Tue Jul 7 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"Even in Maryland, which can be a pretty draconian place in some regards, divorce on the grounds of adultery, especially a marriage of less than 5 years, is not something you need to do.  File no fault and move on with your life.  The waiting period before you can get a final decree will come and go before you know it.  You're already going to have to live with the knowledge of your mistake for the rest of your life (the good news is you can use that knowledge and experience to become a better person if you choose), there is no need to make it part of the divorce proceeding as well.  If your husband is insisting that is the only way he'll file, then make him file, and make him prove it.  Admit nothing to anyone going forward during that process.  If all he has is your word against his, the judge is going to throw it out.  Adultery is very difficult to prove in court."
Divorce,3cdo5r,LaTuFu,3,Tue Jul 7 14:09:27 2015 UTC,What difference does it make.  The split seems pretty simple.  You committed the act.  You didn't care when you were doing it so why should you care if its listed as the reason.  Let it go.

I can prove it and my ex knows, so why she wants a trial, I haven't a clue."
Divorce,3cdo5r,Someguywhoneedshelp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:42:27 2015 UTC,"IANAL, and this is not legal advice.  Most states are no fault states, meaning that divorces are filed on the grounds that the marriage is irretrievably broken, without either spouse admitting to or trying to prove fault.  Proving fault grounds in court is very expensive, in terms of lawyer time.  Even in states that have fault statutes still on the books, almost no one uses them, as in most states fault as grounds for a divorce does not affect asset distribution, alimony or custody (Texas and a few other states are different). A local family law attorney can best advise you as to how to proceed in your state.   Nearly certainly, there is no ""fine"" for your cheating.  This isn't the 1800s. You did something that's not awesome, and your marriage is ending.  Learn from it, and try to make your life better, going forward. You're not going to have to name the person, you're not going to flogged or pilloried, nor will you have to wear a scarlet ""A"" on your clothes.  Real advice: try not to hurt each other too much as you work through your divorce.  He's hurt now; apologize, and try to hasten the end of your marriage.  Hurting each other gives each of you the will to ""fight"", which=lawyer time, and money."
Divorce,3cdo5r,hubbyofhoarder,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:44:30 2015 UTC,"I couldn't help but google it and came up with this...  ""There is a difference between something that is illegal and a civil cause of action (something you can sue someone for). In Maryland, adultery is still a crime (I believe it is a maximum $10 fine). However, there are no civil causes of action for adultery per se - you can't sue someone for committing adultery in and of itself.""  So I wouldn't worry so much about the fine more about how long do you both want this to take?  If you choose not to file that way then you will have to wait out the 12 month separation period.  I had to do that in NY way back when the law was written that way and trust me, it's worth taking the hit to get it over with quicker.***   Go speak to a lawyer.  ***EDIT...I read into it further, and if this MD lawyer I'm reading is correct then your admission to cheating would not be enough to avoid the one year waiting period.  He would have to be able to prove to a judge that you were cheating.    You REALLY need to speak to a lawyer."

I also feel like I may be giving up something that may be important later on. Lawyer isn't too insightful on this aspect. Anyone been in a similar situation where an Ex moved out of country with children?   You probably want to consult with a more experienced attorney.

So yes, I could turn the knobs and force her to stay, but I think the result could be disastrous. We've been able to communicate reasonably amicably (as reasonably as these things go I suppose) but her desire is to go back to Germany. Pushing on those buttons could turn this into something that gets very bitter. As of right now we're generally agreeing that whenever I want to take time to visit, she has stated she won't block it. Also, as I mentioned earlier, when it is appropriate for our son to stay with me for longer she won't block that capacity either.

You would need in your decree provisions about communications with your kid such as skype or cell phone will not be interferred with. Also bind her to the decisions of the US court. You need a lawyer who is experienced with international custody issues such as compliance with the Hague convention. Letting your spouse take your kid overseas is fraught with peril. Depending on your stbx personality she could easily never let you see your kid again.   One other question why are you paying $1500 a month in child support for one kid? Unless you make over $200,000 a year and she makes nothi g then that is really excessive.  Child support is set by a mathematical formula based largely on incomes of the parents.  So it sounds like you are getting screwed.  One other question is why"
Divorce,3ccjoc,Nitsua642,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:28:37 2015 UTC,"On the first point - it is becoming more obvious that the lawyer I have started with is not suitable to finish this case.  On the second point - I now reside in IL, where it is a straight 20% of income after taxes assessed on the noncustodial parent regardless of income of the other parent. I do well, have worked extremely hard to get to where I am. I won't begrudge her the money and the settlement money as she gets settled back in Germany, but I am annoyed with the prospect that even when she does get a good job I'll need to pay 20% with no cap."
Divorce,3ccjoc,JVorhees,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:52:40 2015 UTC,Wow. That's harsh. 20%. Good Luck though.
Divorce,3ccjoc,JVorhees,2,Tue Jul 7 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"I also feel like I may be giving up something that may be important later on.   Yeah, raising your child.  Personally, I would move to Germany to do just that. I can't imagine anything taking a priority over that even if it means leaving the rest of my family and friends behind.   Barring your willingness to do that, I think her request for full legal custody is reasonable."
Divorce,3ccjoc,JVorhees,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:24:18 2015 UTC,"Not a very helpful reply and you know it. Like I said, I understand her stance. I am primed to go that direction, however I would like to understand the longer term ramifications of that specific decision from someone who may have been in a similar situation.  My main stance comes from when our son gets older, I want to push to have him with me for several months to a year at a time if feasible (potentially spending a school year in the US vs Germany). That is where the custody situation may be problematic in my mind.  And to your point about trying to shame me on raising my child - highly active involvement may be feasible if she was merely moving to another city or state. But as is, I cannot work in Germany nor do I speak German so I am pretty much 99% unemployable there. So you'd be asking me trade off being able to at least financially support my child vs placing all three of us in am extremely difficult financial position."
Divorce,3ccjoc,toasterchild,2,Mon Jul 6 21:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to shame you into doing shit. I am seriously flabbergasted that someone would make that choice. I had to fight my ass off to ensure my ex didn't shut me out of our child's life like she tried to do. There is nothing even remotely close to the importance of my relationship with my child.   I'm sure it would be hard to make it all work in Germany but I know which choice I wouldn't regret at the end of my life.   But to specifically answer your question, I can't see you getting joint legal custody that would enable you to make any sort of decision for your child if you give primary physical custody to your wife and allow her to move out of the country."
Divorce,3ccjoc,rasconjon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"I now better understand your frame of reference - the wording stuck me as very aggressive earlier. Perhaps I did not communicate my full situation as well as I could have and there are definitely feelings and thoughts that I have not typed.   Any way, in reference to trying to make Germany work - like I stated, employment wise it would not work out. I have an ex-Army friend who also married a German and she kept their daughter. They do maintain joint custody though he now lives in Oregon. However, though I think I'm able to maintain something more amicable with my stbx, his relationship with his ex is extremely confrontational. He did in fact try to stay in Germany but could not find work, could not get help for his PTSD, and eventually ran out of all funds. In the end, he gets sent back to the US though he finally gets medical disability started, but now has to fight for every legal right owed to him. I am hopeful that not doing it his way will 1) give me more financial capability to do what I want/need to do and 2) maintain something amicable so that again I can do what I want/need to do.  My worry is that if things do turn south, if I'll be completely up the creek with legal issues since my friend already has to fight tooth and nail for anything even with partial custody. I guess the answer really lies with the other response of keep searching for more experienced legal representation."
Divorce,3ccjoc,rasconjon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"For your specific question, I'll put it to you another way: your wife could smile, nod along and agree to the standard joint legal language but in the grand scheme of things you will not be able to use it for any recourse. Even locally, unless there's a 3rd party named to resolve disputes, there's still a tiebreaker of who has there way. Or you go to court.  Give us a scenario in which you think they'll make your wife, who for all intents and purpose will be solely responsible for raising your child, come back to the states to go to court over some matter? I'll be honest, I have no actual knowledge of international custody disputes, but I don't see it happening for anything period.   As for CoC's warning about you being too trusting, you better heed his warning. If you are going to let her go, you should agree to a set long distance parenting plan at the very least. All summer and all winter break with you, for instance. And some period of time per year for you to visit in Germany."
Divorce,3ccjoc,fatheroftwoboys,2,Tue Jul 7 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"Never, ever, ever count on getting more visitation or getting a custody change down the line. Especially if you ex lives in another country. If you settle for giving up custody and getting minimal visitation now, that is what you will have in 10 years too."
Divorce,3ccjoc,bradbrookequincy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"Have you talked to JAG? They might be able to get more insight with the overseas issues.  $1500 a month seems REALLY high... Especially considering BAH will vary with location, etc.   It's your child regardless of the support. You obviously should have some stake. If it was up to me, I wouldn't let her leave. There's a possibility that you'll never see your kid, etc."

A few months ago, I was surprised by how great I felt. Today, I can't believe how things keep getting better. Yet I'm not completely healed and I don't expect myself to be. I just love reading this again and again. I definitely relate to feeling like a failure initially but not anymore."

My couples therapist finally told me she never saw anyone try as hard as I did. It still totally fell apart because I just couldn't do it anymore. I tried my best and had to give up. It might have been the same for you."
Divorce,3cbnlu,WeWantBootsy,2,Wed Jul 8 03:13:58 2015 UTC,"I still get that. In fact just the other night I was thinking about how much I miss being only a few rooms from my son at any given time, which led to a short cry over the loss of my family.  Not so much my ex anymore, just what we used to have when things were good.  Moments like that tend to sneak up on me."

Divorce,3cbnlu,GrandEthos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:59:14 2015 UTC,I saw it. My brain may have leaked a bit. I don't even have kids.
Divorce,3cbnlu,abloodyminge,2,Mon Jul 6 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"The recent regret and remorse are debilitating at times. I was married for 13 years and have two kids, 12 and 9. My ex-wife and I seemed to become emotionally detached from each other over the years. My inability to communicate, our tendency to retreat to our corners rather than tackle issues, and the grind of raising two active kids eroded a relationship that really was built on shared pinko liberal values.  I started an affair with a coworker about a year ago. Perhaps it was just the secretive thrill of it all, but she and I had a great relationship. Open communication, honesty, vulnerability, and so on. Once my ex found out about four months ago--and there was no doubt a part of me that wanted to get caught and take the easy way out of my flagging marriage--we rushed through the legal process without really addressing the emotional intensity of it all.    The divorce was finalized about 6 weeks ago. I thought I'd be happy to move on with the woman with whom I had the affair, but found myself completely overwhelmed with emotion a few weeks ago. I'm the brooding, introspective type by nature, but I was not prepared for the sadness, the second-guessing, the anxiety. It's not that the grass wasn't greener on the other side, but I cannot help but think, ""I could've had a lush, green lawn if I had just made a modest effort to nurture it.""  I've started therapy and have both reached out to my ex and told the other woman that I need an indefinite, maybe permanent, time out until I hopefully find some psychological well-being. I have no idea what lies ahead, but just want to say, ""Yeah, Bro, it's painful but you are probably not alone in feeling this way."""
Divorce,3cbnlu,yawie99,2,Mon Jul 6 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for the response.  Eerie similarities.  I had an emotional affair during the waning days of the marriage and am in a pretty decent relationship now (Grasswise) but the ""if I'd only made an honest effort"" thing runs through my brain quite a bit."
Divorce,3cbnlu,yawie99,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's strangely comforting to know I'm not the only one struggling with this. There's a part of me that recognizes the fact that I need to grieve and perhaps bury once and for all my former self, but it's incredibly difficult since I am the kind of person who is always asking, ""What if?"" Given the ages of my kids, I fear it's going to be a while before I can truly move on."
Divorce,3cbtza,highnote10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"You know that you can't continue to excuse the abuse. Your safety and well-being as an individual supersede whatever emotions he will be going through as a consequence of your divorce. If therapy is a non-starter or hasn't been accomplishing anything, it may be time to 'pull the plug' as you say."
Divorce,3cbtza,GrandEthos,2,Mon Jul 6 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"I think one hard hurdle is not only losing the marriage, but I will be losing my best friend. The person who I have spent almost 15 yrs sharing life with. All the fighting just brings the reality more to light because in the past he would be the one I would call for comfort and advice and now that confidant is not there. Its a double whammy of loss. Therapy has its good moments but its takes two active participants, and it seems that even though it worked at first, he has given up using all the skillsets learned and has regressed to a point that we are back to square one."
Divorce,3cbtza,GrandEthos,2,Mon Jul 6 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"I lost my 15 year best friend as well. It's not going to be easy, but the reality of it is your husband isn't really the same person you met all those years ago. He's evolved into someone else (and so have you, we all do), and that someone is apparently toxic to your relationship now.  There are no good options here. I assume neither of you will be throwing a part when the divorce is final. Still it is understood you can't continue on as you have been. If you aren't both invested in the solution, things will not get better. The abuse will not get better; it could get worse.  Your options are get out now,  or suffer for X number of years with the same animosity, at which point you'll still get divorced."
Divorce,3cbtza,GrandEthos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:49:00 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I don't want. To keep fighting and the outcome to still be a divorce. Or to be destroyed in the process.   Thank you so much for your feedback!
Divorce,3cbtza,GrandEthos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:39:57 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like it would be less you 'fighting' and more you just taking the abuse until you really can't deal with it anymore.  That wouldn't be good for either of you.
Divorce,3cbtza,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't really think of it as bluntly as that. I guess I have just been telling myself that being patient and trying to find ways to establish healthy communication and healthy fighting was not giving up and therefore working on it. But you're right. I am just tolerating abuse, especially if he isn't trying to correct bad behaviors too."
Divorce,3cbtza,Beersage,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Well that's pretty much it right there. If you're both working toward a solution, then you are fighting to keep the relationship together. If you're the only one putting any effort into that, it's simply you taking whatever he dishes out... and it really won't end.  If you think you can live the rest of your life like that, more power to you. I don't think you'd be here if you did however."
Divorce,3cckdr,confused05throwaway,7,Mon Jul 6 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"Well you might bring this up at the next counseling session. He's either trying or he isn't trying... if you think he's just waiting until he thinks you can handle the inevitable, that doesn't sound like trying."
Divorce,3cckdr,GrandEthos,2,Mon Jul 6 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"Yep agree.  I have tried mentioning it to him, but mums the word.  Counseling might be the right place for it.    Just wondering if there are any other people going through counseling and still considering divorce and what is driving those thoughts.  Its probably pretty self explanatory."
Divorce,3cckdr,GrandEthos,3,Mon Jul 6 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"He may have thought it could be beneficial and it wasn't (to him), or he was just playing for time either way. My ex decided to divorce me months before she was planning to tell me. Of course I stumbled on the affair so her timetable was messed up. I imagine if things had been different from the start and we'd done counseling, she might have hung on for a few sessions, but I don't think anything would have changed her mind. She was simply done."
Divorce,3cckdr,blackwaterflo,2,Mon Jul 6 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I think that is the hard thing for him.  He doesn't know what he wants, he is not completely done.  I think a part of it is that we have a pretty strong relationship outside of his need for fireworks in the bedroom vs good sex where you both come to orgasm, hug, kiss  and go to sleep.  He thinks there should be some connection every time you do it, but that doesn't happen.  He said its un-natural and if you had a good relationship it would.  I am not sure how to compete with big fireworks.  I am a sparkler.  Consistent, always burning and lighting up the dark, but I am not shooting into the sky and lighting up the entire scene.  I need to work on that."
Divorce,3cckdr,toasterchild,2,Tue Jul 7 14:22:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the issue is his.  Is he going through some kind of crisis where he suddenly wishes he'd married a Cirque de Soleil performer?  While lots of people go through that, it's not necessarily the other spouses fault."
Divorce,3cckdr,Diet-CokeFiend,3,Tue Jul 7 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be uncommon. Lots of people, like my ex, got to marriage counseling just so they can say ""I tried everything and it still didn't work."" Listen to your gut and protect yourself. You can still take steps to protect yourself and even get legal advice while still putting your best efforts into marriage counseling."
Divorce,3cckdr,WeWantBootsy,3,Tue Jul 7 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"He might just not know what he wants do he's examining/researching every outcome waiting for something to make the decision for him.  If you're concerned about ""protecting"" yourself, then you should do your own research.  People need to know they are making the best decision for themselves. He probably feels that knowledge is power.  And it is. It doesn't mean he's not trying, or   that he doesn't think staying married would be the best outcome."
Divorce,3c9evx,dontwannabehere1,7,Mon Jul 6 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"Let's get this straight. You need a lawyer. Not tomorrow, not tofay, but like yesterday. Get on the phone and start looking. You need to make sure you get one, even if you need to beg, borrow, and/or sell legal stuff.   18 years is a long comitment. Being stay at home parent is also a big comitment. Your stbx can't just leave you hanging. You're entitled to spousal support for you and child support for you children. It's not a free ticket though so expect to go back to school and to get a job. Expect home school to NOT be an option now."
Divorce,3c9evx,fatheroftwoboys,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:58:32 2015 UTC,So sorry that happened to you.  Cannot believe someone married for 18 years with 2 kids would do that.  You do need a lawyer asap but not just any lawyer.  You need one that you feel comfortable with who has a good reputation.  Call every one of your local divorced friends/family and get names of lawyers they recommend.  Get appointments with at last 3 of them for an initial consultation.  Research what questions to ask on the internet and then pick the best one for you.  Hang in there.
Divorce,3c9evx,thingsorfreedom,2,Mon Jul 6 10:29:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you have to go through this, and so unexpectedly.  My first thought was that he must have someone new, which is why he wants an uncontested (and quicker) divorce.  Talk to a lawyer, immediately.  Some states punish spouses for infidelity (economically) and others are ""no fault"".  Have the lawyer map out for you how to protect your assets in the short term (moving them to an account in your name only or other remedies your state law may allow for).  Does he want to see his kids or is he abandoning them to you?  Many states add an alimony or child support multiplier if one parent has them greater than 75-80% of the time.  This is going to be overwhelming, so get a referral for the best lawyer you can afford and just do what he or she tells you so you can focus on your emotional well-being and the kids."
Divorce,3c9evx,Arcades,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:56:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that happened. I was blindsided as well and the mixture of emotions can be overwhelming.  An uncontested divorce basically just means that you work out the issues outside of court. It doesn't mean that you don't need a lawyer. Depending on where you live, the nature of how he left may be important in determining what's ""fair"" (once again - highly dependent on jurisdiction).  It's really difficult to think clearly in a situation like this, especially in the beginning. Get good professionals to help advise you. You will still be the ultimate decision-maker, but they can help you to think it through.  Speaking of professionals, now is definitely the time to start look for a therapist if you aren't already. This is traumatic event for anyone and you need to take care of yourself so you can continue to care for your children.  Hang in there. It's going to be rough for awhile, but it'll get better."

Get a really good one so they can get you the best that you need.    Who knows the reason and he is a real coward for up and leaving you like that without any communication, but you need to remain focused and take care of yourself and your children.  Protect them from his unpredictability.   Besides that, I am sure that you are an emotional wreck.  Get a counselor and talk to your really good friends about it.  Try to remain strong and confident because right now you are probably not doing so well.    Therapy will help with this!  I promise."
Divorce,3c9evx,confused05throwaway,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"Well that's pretty awful. Sorry.   He wants an uncontested divorce.   By uncontested, does he mean he's willing to pay child support and spousal support as well as split all marital assets equally? Great - let him know you'll have a lawyer draw up those terms for him to sign.  If you don't currently have access to a lawyer, don't sweat. He'll have to pay and an attorney will work with you on that.  Hang in there."
Divorce,3c9evx,JVorhees,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"He has asked for the kids every other weekend or one day a week, so I will have them the vast majority of the time.  That is supposed to be basic protocol I think.  If there is someone else, I can't find missing time, missing money, no strange phone calls, none of the things that I should have seen, but granted that isn't 100%.  He has offered child support and alimony but JUST enough to pay the basic bills.  Anything like an illness or seasonal clothes, etc would be outside of my range.  I don't mind working but I was in a severe accident and don't know if I could work out of the home at this point if I could even find a job here.  I live in the suburbs of a major city and the job market here is so saturated that it is near impossible to find a decent job.  I have a college degree but not sure what that would mean in this economy and since I have been out of the job market for over a decade. My biggest concern about homeschooling is the additional upheaval for the kids.  My older one isn't on the spectrum  but doesn't do change well. I would like to stay home another year in order to let them get their feet back under them and the youngest is still too young for school which would mean paying child care. He thinks he is being fair but his offer is still heavily biased in his favor. I will be calling attorneys but just the thought of taking this step is leaving me steamrolled.  I wish I had someone to hold my hand through all of this!  The fun thing is that the one person I want to hold my hand is the one putting me through all of this."
Divorce,3caia0,clydefalls,26,Mon Jul 6 11:30:59 2015 UTC,What is it with you and being a jerk?   Grow up and tell her you want a divorce.   Don't just sit there for a couple weeks laughing at her while you prepare and she thinks you're working on your marriage.
Divorce,3caia0,Catcherofsouls,-2,Mon Jul 6 11:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yikes. Well for starters: 1) I feel like a cooling off period is helpful to help me seek validation and confirmation that I'm not making the biggest mistake of my life. What if I missed something? 2) You really think I'm laughing at her? This is a hard decision for me, and I've spent 11 years of my life with this woman. We'd be great friends if we hadn't got married, and I still love her as a friend. If we had kids, we'd stay married most likely for them. I'm not laughing at her, I just don't feel sexually attracted to her, ok? Cut me a little slack; I get your point about growing up, but help me do it at my pace. Not everyone can just SNAP make a decision and be ok with it... some people work at a slower pace."

What if I missed something?   This is what therapy is for.    We'd be great friends if we hadn't got married, and I still love her as a friend.   You don't know that, she might not have stuck around, she'd probably have found someone else and married them and had a life completely separate from you.  While you're running around the nest few weeks patting yourself on the back for how happy and good you feel now that you decided to just seek your own happiness realize that that's not the reality of what your life with her will be like once you actually become honest with her about how you don't want to be married with her because your attraction has wained and you don't think it's possible to get that back by committing to the marriage.   From what I gather you're going to say the following to her:  ""Look I still love you, I think we're great together, I just am not attracted to you and I want to have sex with people I'm attracted to. When it comes down to it having sex with people I'm attracted to is more important to me than being with someone I love and have made a life with. Sorry, we can still be friends though right?"""
Divorce,3caia0,Slowlyloosinghope,4,Mon Jul 6 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"because your attraction has waned and you don't think it's possible to get that back by committing to the marriage   I think part of why I'm getting judged so harshly by people like you is that everyone thinks that I was attracted to her at some point and I ""lost it"" and I'm too lazy to try to fix it.   I was never attracted to her. I was never ""in love"" with her. I never had my heart beat wildly when she'd walk in. Never thought she looked amazing in a dress. I hesitated dating her from day one because of the attraction issue. I honestly married her because I thought all that stuff was bullshit and would fade anyways someday. I was marrying her because she was an amazing person and my best friend. I thought I was getting married for the right reasons; it turns out I was wrong. I wish I had known when I was 25, but i didn't.   I didn't think sexual attraction was that big of a deal. Blame it on my repressive Puritanical background. Or, alternatively, tell me that I'm full of shit and sexual attraction isn't that big of a deal; maybe it's not to you and it is to me. Maybe that makes me shallow. Maybe in 10 years I'll be lonely, sad and depressed because I have a hot wife who hates me. I don't think it's just about attraction; but I don't think you can be in an intimate sexual relationship with someone that you're not sexually attracted to.   Maybe the word choice of ""sexual attraction"" is clunky; I'm not sure I can describe it perfectly, but there's just a chemistry that's lacking. I don't feel passionate about her, I don't feel limerent towards her, I just think of her as a really great friend. I think it's due to the lack of some sort of sexual attraction, but it's clearly not just her looks; I've been attracted to women that were far less superficially attractive than my wife.   Rather than just rip on me for decisions I made when I was young and then was too stubborn to unmake, why don't you answer whether you seriously think it's fair to her to be in a sexual relationship with someone who is not attracted to her? Do you seriously think we should just decide that sex isn't important, when it clearly is?   And no, I don't think we can probably still be friends.   If your point is that I should rip the bandaid off, fine. But it seems like your point is to judge me for not being attracted to her, as if that's something I can control."
Divorce,3caia0,r8td,10,Mon Jul 6 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was marrying her because she was an amazing person and my best friend.   This is the best basis for a marriage, the absolute best basis. Sexual attraction comes and goes, that heart beating fast in your chest thing? Yeah that goes away too because that excitement and rush of the relationship goes away. Long term love is all about a making a choice every single day to commit to that relationship and that person for who they are on that day.   I don't feel passionate about her, I don't feel limerent towards her   Yeah that's a long term relationship, you're not being driven by hormones and lush, you actually have to commit and choose. Long term lasting love is not what you see in the movies.   If you're done because high intensity sexual attraction is that important to you then that's the decision you've made. But don't try to sugar coat it or mince words. What you're looking for is the rush and excitement of new love, or an affair.   Am I judging you? Probably, to be honest, but that's because you would choose sexual excitement and lust over a long term committed relationship. You claim to love someone but because you don't feel head over heels in love with her, and apparently never have, then you see no point in working on the marriage.  If that's the basis of what you want in your relationships fine, but don't expect any of them to last over 5 years then without you loosing that feeling. Because you will, and then you'll have to work on the relationship and nurturing it and choosing and committing and all that.  No matter what, you're going to find the justifications you need in order to do what you want to get what you think will make you truly happy.  But seriously get your head out of the clouds and realize that head over heels love is not the basis of a marriage."

Divorce,3caia0,Catcherofsouls,4,Mon Jul 13 01:58:15 2015 UTC,Actually you're wrong.   Lack of sexual attraction is perfectly reasonable and a significant cause of divorce.   I have no issue with that.   The judgement you're getting is around how you're handling yourself and her.   You're jerking her around about your marriage and even now pretending this is about her to try and save yourself from responsibility for this decision.      whether you seriously think it's fair to her to be in a sexual relationship with someone who is not attracted to her?    Own the decision or figure out how to make it work.   You're complaining you made a bad decision when you were young so now it is grown up time.   Don't pretend this is anything other than what it is.
Divorce,3caia0,Catcherofsouls,2,Mon Jul 6 13:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah gotcha. My question was basically intended to understand whether waiting to tell her is a bad idea.

Divorce,3caia0,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:19:05 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not meaning to be harsh.   If I'm challenging you please realize divorce is much worse.   I get making a mistake when you're younger I've still got 15 years of child support to pay to mine.   (The ex is the mistake not the kids.)    Own your mistake and be honest with yourself about why.   It'll strengthen you in the long run.
Divorce,3caia0,JVorhees,5,Mon Jul 6 13:27:24 2015 UTC,"Yikes. Well for starters: 1) I feel like a cooling off period is helpful to help me seek validation and confirmation that I'm not making the biggest mistake of my life. What if I missed something?   She's still going to be hairy and smelly to go off your previous statements.    2) You really think I'm laughing at her? This is a hard decision for me, and I've spent 11 years of my life with this woman. We'd be great friends if we hadn't got married, and I still love her as a friend. If we had kids, we'd stay married most likely for them. I'm not laughing at her, I just don't feel sexually attracted to her, ok?    Your current plan includes sitting back silently judging her for another 3 weeks.  While potentially stringing her along as to the future.   Whether you realize it or not you're being cruel.    Cut me a little slack; I get your point about growing up, but help me do it at my pace. Not everyone can just SNAP make a decision and be ok with it... some people work at a slower pace.   Honestly I look at you as trying to find some cover story for why you want to divorce.  Something that won't be ""I'm not sexually attracted to her.""  And at this point you're playing games with another person and that's not sitting well."

Honestly, I thought it was less cruel to tell her on a Saturday when she can take a couple of days to compose herself rather than when she has clients to see the next day. Not trying to play games; trying to be respectful. And I'm also resigned to the fact that I'm not sexually attracted to her and that people feel like that's a small, shallow thing to care about. I said before I think it's more than that - there's some missing chemistry - but that seems to get lost in the shuffle because it's harder to explain and harder to label. So fine, I'm not sexually attracted to her and I've decided that I can't be with someone I'm not attracted to."

Divorce,3caia0,WeWantBootsy,3,Mon Jul 6 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"I am going through something like this right now with my SO.  He has communicated to me that he is unhappy and not certain if we should stay together.    We are working with a marriage counselor, but I know for a fact that he is still researching and reading about divorce daily.  It pisses me off that he is doing both at the same time and makes me question his genuineness of working on marriage during counseling.    If it were me, i would you to man up and tell me now.  I will feel all of the same anger, sadness and remorse with or without your hanging around for my feelings.  Actually, it would really piss me off if I found out that you had already made the decision to leave weeks prior but had been sticking around to get things in order.    So have the two of you talked about your not being attracted to her and not enjoying sex with her?  It really is not fair for her to not have an opportunity to discuss this with you and work on it, but you guys may already be aware of this.    I do have to agree with some of the other posters that divorcing for sex and attraction, if everything else is working, is a shitty reason especially if you guys have not seen a marriage counselor or sex therapy doctor.    I have read a lot on these topics and everything points to being able to resolve these issues if you are open to working on it and putting effort into it.  Of course, I understand that if she is not willing it is probably a moot point.    I do think a lot of men want that excitement and thrill of new love and exciting sex, but it goes quickly and you will find yourself in a cycle of new relationships and not committed ones at that.  Sex is only really good when there is true love involved and that includes so much more than just sex and thrills and a good looking women.    But if you are determine, break the news now and don't wait just because this a bad week for the two of you."
Divorce,3caia0,abloodyminge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:55:10 2015 UTC,"especially if you guys have not seen a marriage counselor or sex therapy doctor   We have been seeing one; it's just that they recommend tactics and techniques to ""rekindle"" something that wasn't there.   It really is not fair for her to not have an opportunity to discuss this with you and work on it   Actually, I agree with you and think I'm going to hold off and try to make this more of a discussion. I've been convinced that I need to give this effort more time.    everything points to being able to resolve these issues if you are open to working on it and putting effort into it.    what issues? sex and attraction? We can probably get better at sex. In fact we already have, even if it feels mechanical. But attraction? I haven't seen anyone suggest you can become attracted to someone you're not attracted to but you like. I've heard of people increasing their attraction after getting to know someone that they found less attractive before. But that requires something to be there in the first place.    Sex is only really good when there is true love involved and that includes so much more than just sex and thrills and a good looking women   100% agree. The only time I've ever had good sex was with my AP whom I loved and who loved me back. I asked her what made the sex good and she said there was an emotional intimacy/ connection between us that is rare. I'm not sure how to describe what that was - a spark, a connection, an attraction, an intimacy, love, limerence. She described it as intellectual/ emotional/ and physical attraction, all in one person. Whatever it was, I've never felt it with my wife.   My wife is smart and she's capable of displaying emotions, so it must not be either of those, even if I'm less attracted to her mind and feel less emotionally close with her for various reasons. So I've landed on ""it"" having to be ""physical attraction"" for want of a better explanation.   However, my wife is prettier and dresses better than my old AP. She has gorgeous hair. She has better looking hands and feet. And she is shorter than me, as opposed to my AP, who would be taller than me if she wore heels; a big turnoff for me. Does my wife have the same boobs, butt and stomach and legs? No, and perhaps those body parts are more relevant than the rest, but it seems to me that distilling the female figure down to those few features is starting to play semantics.   I'll never know, but I'd guess if my AP had a different body type I would have felt the same way about her. There was something else there, a connection of some sorts, that I have never experienced with my wife. It resulted in not just me wanting her physically, but me wanting to move to Boston even though I hate Boston, me to take care of her, me wanting to meet her family, me wanting to have children with her, me wanting to get a dog even though I hate dogs. It also resulted in me wanting to be a better person and reconnect with my own family, it stopped me from needing to criticize everything I see all the time or always obsess over every decision. She brought out my introspection and she encouraged my creativity. I've been calling it ""attraction"" because I don't know what else to call it. But she made me into a better version of myself, and she made me want to be a better person. Perhaps that was just limerence and it would have faded over time. But I have never felt that way about my wife, and I feel like I'm missing out on something by not being able to feel the way I felt around my AP for the rest of my life.  Tell me I'm missing something. Tell me my memory is suspect because we never got past the limerent stage of first love and everything I described is typical for ""first affairs"" or ""new romances"" and since I hadn't been in one in 12 years, I'm just clueless. Tell me I was just jonesing for that ""thrill of new love and exciting sex"" and once I got it, I felt good about myself and I projected all the rest of that onto her and onto myself. Tell me that in 6 months or 6 years, I would have found her just as boring and unattractive as I find my wife. But you'll never really know.  Because to me, what I felt for her wasn't just romantic love; it was deep compassionate love. It was intimate love. It was sacrificial love. It wasn't just amazing sex. It was connected sex. It felt like we had something special.  That I know that feeling is out there – maybe not in my AP anymore, because she's probably moved on - is probably the real reason why I want to leave my marriage, because I know what I'm capable of and I know it's out there, and I don't want to live in a dull existence in parallel anymore.   That's the best I've got – now tear me to shreds. You can probably start by telling me that I should tell all this to my SO and then she'd understand things and really hate my guts."

HOWEVER, that could be because I'm still thinking irrationally. And the very reasonable point that's made is that I shouldn't make rash decisions while still under the spell. And since you guys think that might still be the case, sounds like I should probably give it some more time before doing anything drastic. Which again, suggests that a more cautious approach would be preferable to a ""tell her now!!"" approach.   thanks for posting"
Divorce,3caia0,Catcherofsouls,3,Tue Jul 7 02:16:13 2015 UTC,Tell her now - lying to her through omission is far worse than causing stress - lying is betrayal - betrayed people do not react to divorce well!
Divorce,3caia0,abloodyminge,3,Mon Jul 6 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to judge you as I have no idea what the situation is. I was married to a narcissist for years who everyone thought was this great wife. Meanwhile, she would tell me everyday all the ways I wasn't good enough for her. My point is only no one knows what your relationship is like.   Don't have sex with her anymore. Tell her you don't want to do anything for your birthday. And tell your couples therapist now you plan on divorcing her. You might be able to use the couples session as a way of breaking the news. You really ought to break the news sooner than later. You'll always find excuses.   It's going to suck no matter what. Especially if she's enjoying the marriage again and trying."

Hearing he was done after finally feeling like it was getting better was a shock and hurt like hell. If you're done, step the fuck up and be done. Have some balls and end it.

Divorce,3caia0,cristinanana,2,Mon Jul 6 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"Blurg.  This is bringing up a mixture of emotions. I think my response will probably be slightly disjointed as a result.  A ""good"" time is going to be a really complicated matter. Yes, it's probably handy to have that extra available processing time, but will she also have support available to her at that time?   My STBX chose a 3-day weekend to break the completely unexpected news to me. The extra day off of work was needed. However, he also chose V-Day to do it and that meant that I was faced with dealing with it on my own or interrupting my would-be support network's Valentine's Day. Obviously, that was a shitty move on his part on a number of levels, but the point is that I had to go it alone for a really long day.  I understand that you're trying to hold off because you think it would be better for her. But would it really?  For your birthday, I see two potential scenarios:  1) You do a convincing job faking that everything is ok - in which case, she may (rightfully) feel pretty deceived and manipulated when she realizes what you did  2) You don't do a convincing job faking it and she's left to worry and anticipate.  When it comes to sex:  1) You continue to have sex as normal. For the result, see scenario 1 for birthday.  2) You alter your sexual patterns. For the result, see scenario 2 for birthday, but add on an additional hit to her self-confidence."
Divorce,3caia0,txgirl005,-2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reliving some of that for me - appreciate the support.   I wonder if there's a third way, where I don't have to pretend but at the same time don't have to insult her by being moody or closed-off. Instead, could I openly engage her in the dialogue more? I've been afraid to go this route thinking it will cause her to live the emotional rollercoaster, but my mom had a different opinion.  I spoke to my mother this morning and mentioned that many ""folks I'd talked to"" (in this case, redditors) had suggested that prolonging the inevitable was just being cruel to my wife. She disagreed. She actually thinks that my wife needs more processing time to understand everything, and neither faking it nor leaving her out in the cold worrying and anticipating really helps with that. She thinks I need to be more open with her - communicate that ""I didn't enjoy the sex and let's work through it"", tell her ""I'm not really comfortable doing anything major for my birthday as I don't know how i feel about everything"", say ""I didn't really love hanging out with you this weekend because I keep thinking about our future"" and let her be a part of the solution and come up with ideas.   I replied that I'd brought her in to the process before and that she said she can't handle the rollercoaster, but perhaps I'm missing the nuance around ""being open"". By being more upfront about my state of discomfort/indecision without beating her up with specifics (""your legs turned me off there"", ""i didn't like the sound you made there"", ""you're not thinking through that logical argument thoroughly enough""), I can help her get to a point where she is not so shocked when I announce I'd like a divorce. And that would actually help her.  That honestly feels more tenable to me. I understand that some people here think that's just dragging it out longer than it should be or deliberately misleading her when I'm already ""there"", but it feels so unfair to end a 12 year relationship with her in shock at its dissolution."

It may spell out that you have the right to call them once per day. Extended parenting time often has notification time around it - did he meet that?   Him telling you he will take the kids because you can't support them without child support falls under rule #1.  Imagine the argument he'd have to make in court that starts with ""sure I'm not paying child support but. ...""  If you have a support agreement and he's not paying take the two weeks to deal with getting it enforced.   That's your kids' money."

Divorce,3c9ozj,fatheroftwoboys,6,Mon Jul 6 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"I see a few things that worry me in your post.   First, we need to know your state as each state family laws are different.   Second, child support is money own to the children, not you. Take him back to court and demand he gets up to date on his support.  Third, you need to stop giving your kids an option to go see his father. Many divorce parents fail go realize that once divorce (unless agreed by both parents)  the children are ordered to go to see each parent on a usually fix schedule. As parents, BOTH of you are ordered to comply with thus court order. You can't stop it because of your unsubstantiated fears. You can't stop it because of what the children say. You can't stop it because of back child support.   Fourth, take a look at the mirror. You are only 1/2 the parent of the kids. There is another 1/2. Unless he is a drug addict, molester, abuser, etc. you are both court ordered and have a moral parental obligation to send the kids over on their Dad's parenting time.  Fifth, regarding the Summer Vacation, follow the court order. If there is no clause for Summer Vacation, then it's up to you. Camping and family vacations are a part of growing up. Personally, I'd swallow my pride and let him have them. Do the math. It sounds like you already have them 70% of the time. 2 weeks won't kill them or you."

He's not molesting them or stabbing them, he's taking them on an awesome camping trip. That is not abusive or even mean spirited, that's just plainly normal and expected.  So you can't get a phone call in, have them write you a post card.  You can mail letters for them to the ranger station of most parks with their name and campsite on it.  There was a time when mobile phones did not exist and everyone was fine with it.  Stop putting your kids in the middle of your custody arguments, 10 year olds should not be making custody decisions.  You are making them choose one parent over the other, that's mean spirited.  You go by the schedule, end of story.  Your ex gets to do whatever he wants with the kids during his time.  Would you be OK with your ex dictating to you that you cannot buy them ice cream during the time they are with you?  That's how this works, your time is yours his time is his.  You could probably use two weeks with no kids, give yourself a break.  Lastly, if he makes significantly more money than you then you can ask the court to have him pay part of your legal costs.  Heck, I paid my ex's full lawyer fee's and it was totally worth it for me.  You are having these issues right now because you don't have a lawyer to represent you."

So I'm not making the decision. They may go if they want to. There's no pressure from either side. They just doesn't know which to choose, stay or go, cause either way theyll be away from someone they love for a long time. The decision to go or not is the issue and I'm not sure if I should just step in and tell them to go and deal with it if they don't want to go or visa versa."

So she's a little hesitant leaving mom, this may be that inflection point where you shake that off a bit.  Once she is camping with Dad she may forget and have fun in the moment.  I see from your other responses that this is a deadbeat dad.  If this guy is not holding to his parental duties(while flush with money), then you should have kept to the schedule and not even told your kids that there was a camping trip to be missed.  Something must be amiss in this story, he is rich, does not pay mandated child support, yet she is worried that he will take custody away.  What judge would look at a guy that is not paying child support and turn around and say ""yea, this guy is alright, here you go full custody for being a deadbeat Dad, wish there were more of you in the community. <gavel slam>"".  There is a lot more to this story in order for this situation to occur.  Is there no 2 week continuous summer vacation line item in your divorce decree?  That is incredibly standard item to have.

Realize that you feel sad/disappointed/etc. but don't assign that feeling as ""good"" or ""bad.""

It doesn't matter that you consider her a home wrecker or a whore or anything else, in the end he's the one that decided to leave you for someone else, if it hadn't been her it would have been with someone else.   She Doesn't Matter.   Should there be some anger towards her? Sure, she made a terrible selfish choice.

Don't drain shared balance accounts, but you may be able to document it and take half the balance. Make sure she can't borrow against anything in your name (for example change the password on online account management, change payment methods for the amazon account). She would have to file with a court to require you to pay temporary support; giving her money to help her move out might be a good way to get this to happen. You'll need to think about your plan for co-parenting the kids, first and foremost, and definitely vet that plan with an attorney."

Then you pay the bills for the household but you don't pay for her stuff, that's on her now. You need her to get a job and this will give her a push."

Divorce,3c1h5j,Ask_Your_Mother_,9,Fri Jul 3 22:02:44 2015 UTC,I asked my son since his mom and I got divorce about 14 years ago and he is an adult. He thinks it is a good idea to see the fireworks together.  I think it's a great opportunity to show your son that his parents can still be good friends and have fun with him as a group. When it's time to go home you can say that it was fun and now it's time to go home.   In my opinion life is too short not to watch the fireworks on the 4th of July with your child and his other parent.

Divorce,3bz8tv,Shatana_,0,Fri Jul 3 11:15:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry about your ordeal. I am not a lawyer, but I see a few things you need to be aware of...   First, I'm assuming that the physical violence was to you, not the kids AND was not reported to the authorities. You also say he went to jail because a running with the law that I also take didn't involve you nor the kids.  If this is the case, judges will usually grant some sort of shared custody I'm afraid.   Second, to my knowledge, immigration cannot grant ""parenting/custody"" visas so his time with the kids will be limited considerably by the distance and immigration status.   Third, child support would be voided due to his expense to fly to see the kids and/or have the kids flown to see him. Again, a judge will probably allow him parenting rights and visits of some sorts. This is assuming he is not a millionaire of course. You'll also have to realize that there is no chance to enforce an international child support order. What will the OZ government do? Um, sir, you can't enter Australia until you pay child support. His reply will be, OK. This is not a criminal matter so I'll doubt the US will do much.   So, a moral question remains. Do you have the right to remove the kids from their father to such degree? Only you can answer this I'm afraid. No one in this forum knows your situation in full detail AND from both sides.   IMHO, the children deserve some sort of relationship with both parents, even if it has to be supervised. In your case, distance and the cost to be with the children will be a factor. Since YOU decided to move, then you need to come to grips on NOT receiving child support in lieu of his  travel expenses. As much as it hurts, you have the obligation to let the kids see the other parent."

There is no question it was harder to open up emotionally and with my trust.  Even harder to become attached to her son, whom I now consider my son, after losing any contact with my first wife's children. It can happen."

I imagine though that this answer would be different for everyone, depending on what they want or need in a marriage. Loving someone doesn't always mean you want or can share a life with them, right?  For me it was acknowledging that the pain I felt in our marriage wasn't really the person, they are a good person, but the incompatibility of our needs in a marriage causing strife. I felt immense relief actually once I could see that we are good loving people, that are just bad for each other :)"
Divorce,3bwitl,TheEarlShibe,5,Thu Jul 2 21:13:22 2015 UTC,"My divorce was fairly amicable, she was my best friend and I wasn't really sure what a happy life without her would look like.  It was kind of soul crushing at the time, and my forced moratorium of not dating until the divorce was final (4 months start-to-finish) was very distressing to me on a personal level.  What I found is that over time what I really missed wasn't her specifically.  Sure I would see things that I would normally share with her, and I'd make conscious decisions to do or not do so, and that was weird.  Mostly what I really missed was the physical comfort.  The hugs, the coming home to someone, the person I could share my day with who was truly interested in how things were going.  My divorce ended with a whimper instead of a bang.  June 1st it was final, June 2nd I turned 40.  I spent both days completely alone just dealing with my thoughts.  She didn't even wish me a happy birthday.  Within a few days I had a first date, and a second date, and now I'm casually dating a few people, and finding I really love what my future holds for me.  I have a new house, I'm making new friends, I have a pretty good lifestyle that barring some enhancement in the way of new hobbies, is really pretty fulfilling."

We are separated now and although it's sad, we want each other to be happy. We still care about each other, we just don't work as a couple anymore.

Divorce,3bwitl,jasonbatemanscousin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:00:32 2015 UTC,"I think there are a couple of big questions here.  The primary is, do you have kids?  That will often lead to some competition that is not healthy at all for anyone.  Second, what's your financial situation?  If you guys are going to come out of this, roughly 50/50, then staying friends is a possibility.  If one of you ends up paying heavily toward the other, there may be some acrimony.  I guess what I'm saying is, for a lot of people that divorce simply because it isn't the healthiest relationship, it ends up being the materialistic part that really stings and causes the discord.    My ex and I communicate pretty well.  She cheated then eventually left me for another man but I don't hold THAT part against her.  (Buying a big new house right before she decided she wanted out and a couple of other things, those still bug me).  She had to move on and truthfully, I was so tired of the dead beadroom we share, it was fine by me.  All that being said, we have kids and made the conscious choice to at least be civil to one another for their sake.  I guess what I'm getting at, is if you guys are ""consciously uncoupling,"" then maybe you have a chance.  If you do eventually get divorced, I'd suggest taking a little time before you jump in and start dating.  It sounds like your ship could possibly come around again.  Good luck and I hope some of this makes sense, I'm trying to type quickly so I don't get busted at work ;)"

While I ADORE my two kids, divorced life with kids is an order of magnitude more difficult than married life with kids.  With regard to your divorce, it's nice that you speak so positively of him and that you realize the shortcomings of your relationship as it is currently.  Maybe just some time apart?  Let him focus on his trauma?"
Divorce,3bwitl,Redhead824,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"What makes you say that divorced life with kids is an order of magnitude more difficult than married life with kids?  I am very curious on your take, as I'm facing this situation now."
Divorce,3bwitl,jasonbatemanscousin,3,Thu Jul 2 21:53:50 2015 UTC,I think one of the reasons that divorce is more difficult with kids is because you can't completely cut contact with them. They will be a part of your life for as long as your kids are in the house. So any conflict that you might have had with them in marriage has the potential to continue long after you are divorced.
Divorce,3bwitl,cheese-tits,2,Fri Jul 3 04:16:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I have two kids.  Both are very active in sports, scouts, etc.  When it's my time with the kids, it's just me.  That means sometimes leaving one practice early, getting to the other late.  There's no one there to help unless you're lucky enough to make friends with another parent that can help shuttle your kids.  My kids are still young enough that I can't leave them home alone.  So if one kid has an activity I have to drive them to, I can't just leave the other at home with my spouse, the poor kid has to come along for the ride.  Basically the role of two people is reduced down to one and it's exhausting.  I generally help out with my ex and she does with me simply for the sake of the kids.  My ex however is dating someone who lives 900 miles away and leaves for 1 week a month to go be with him.  Those weeks are nearly impossible.  I'd have stayed married just to avoid this, it makes it very difficult to plan your time, date, you name it.  edit-added another thought and added a y to luck"

But I can't keep up this entire relationship by myself, attached to an angry alcoholic with childhood trauma that he refuses to deal with or seek help for.   Being without him is both a huge relief and a knife to the chest all in one.  I want him to be happy, even if it's not with me.  He wants me to forget the past and start fresh, promising that the future will be better.  I have to be the one to say ""It won't get better unless you get help"" and saying no to him is the hardest part because I so want to say ""Yes! Lets do it!""   I wish I could hate him.  It would make this whole thing easier.  Sometimes I envy people in loveless marriages, or those who have been hurt so badly that the love they once had for their partner has completely disappeared.

We have only been twice, but its so hard to go through and he is on vacay for 3 weeks.    Right now there are two sides of this:  1.  Sex - he believes there should be instant chemistry and connection every time you have sex without effort and I believe that you have to create connection and chemistry after 17 years.  Everything I have read, says that sexual connection is about emotionally connecting and knowing all things intimate about your mate (hardships, goals, aspirations, sexual desires) and that the effort put into learning these things will have rewards beyond your beliefs from a sexual perspective.  I guess that is all relative based on what your mindset is around ""the fireworks""  This is a hard because we are on polar opposite sides and if one does not believe in building the connection it most likely will not happen.    Second - working through the solvable issues that led to our break down - communication, engagement, having fun together, emotionally connecting with one another.  We have a good partnership, but as I read from so many others on this site or at least for the men its not about the good partnership, its about good sex.  If they don't have it, then the relationship is not worth saving.  I think they call it living in mediocracy.   I have to say i think thats all bullshit.  I think you take of the path you have been given and not just to live in mediocracy, but to live life to its fullest with the partner that you committed to.  Its a choice, mentally, but so many of us are afraid to put out the effort and try or determine it is too hard to change our mindset and go down a new thinking path and try something else.  It's my way or the highway because I know whats best.  Even if the counselor is telling me my way is the not the norm.   Thanks blacksheep214 for you comments.  They help.  I am a strong person and am not taking a lot of this personally.  I know that I am a great person and have a lot to offer, that includes my husband.  It hurts hearing some of the things that he has to say while being brutally honest, but right now that comes with the territory.    Not getting anything back from him though after 8 weeks is starting to have an affect on me. Not being touched, complimented or desired is hard.  I guess this is what pushed him to have an affair.  The need for that physical touch.  Sometimes I wonder if he holds out because he wants me to run for the hills, get tired and move on.  I hope not, but thats where my dark side goes.   Thanks for letting me vent.  I think I need a visit with my counselor.  =)"
Divorce,3bx5xm,TheEarlShibe,2,Sat Jul 4 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"I think blaming the other woman instead of your spouse for the infidelity is a bit disengenuous.  You're transferring your anger at him and placing it on her.  But here's the straight skinny.  Get some personal therapy for you, and some personal therapy for him, and some couples counsling if he'll go.  That's your attempt to fix the relationship.  If you're serious about fixing it, you need to tell your friend to back off, that his behavior isn't appropriate.  That's external energy, and won't help your marriage.  If you do want a divorce, you need to focus on you and the divorce.  Dating someone else is the last thing you need to do, and it's pretty much guaranteed any relationship you have right now will fail miserably.  Not only that,  but your husband's relationship will probably fail too.  In regards to relationships involving mate poaching, the new relationship rarely makes it to marriage.  If it does make it to marriage, 80% of those relationship end in divorce within 5 years.  But therapy, therapy, and therapy."

For me (and I'm assuming you) deep, indescribable anger and hurt at your spouse is a given.  He singlehandedly hurt you like nobody else in the world ever could. And he did it willingly. He is not off the hook in any way.   Sometimes you don't even know what you feel....hurt or rage or love. ..it all swirls around making you dizzy. And sick.   But in the case of the mistress it's very clear. 100% hate that she would be with your married husband.  It's not her fault he cheated.

Divorce,3bx5xm,Altruizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"Morning Diet-CokeFiend - I have ordered a book to read ""After the Affair"".  I think this is a good recommendation for me to read about how to move past the affair.    I saw my counselor yesterday after one of the most difficult weekends I have experienced with my SO.  My SO and I talked a lot and had some tough moments.  I definitely left the weekend with doubt and doom setting in.  The counselor said there would be more times like this while working through everything that has built up over so many years, but it is important for us to continue to talk and hear each other out.  He said we were moving in the right direction and that our conversations and reactions were good.  I just keep telling myself to keep breathing and take it one day at a time.   I was wondering, since you are in a similar situation, if you would be willing to share with me how you are moving past the affair?  I find myself letting this seep into my dreams at night.  Last night I had a dream about the two of them together sexually. It was the first time, but I certainly want it to be my last. It was heartbreaking to see and I imagined it just like he said. The ""best sexual chemistry ever and he never wanted it to stop, laughing, smiling and him telling her that she was amazing and her telling him that he's the man.    It woke me up and then I dreamt that he was lying next to me in bed and for the first time, him engaging in intimacy with me.  Touching me, and starting to have sex with me.  I remember being so happy that he was finally engaging with me, but I woke before I let anything happen because i was scared of the reaction/rejection.    I guess, I am wondering how I stop thinking about them together.  Especially, since he has made it clear that I stink at sex.  Which by the way, I am amazing, especially when we can be creative and have open dialogue.  I am also wondering how I move past him looking at other people on the internet vs. wanting to look at me and desire me.  I am not 100% sure he is doing this, but he spends a lot of time on the internet and he has done it in our recent past.  What does it mean in light of the fact that he had an affair for sexual pleasure?      You may not know the answers to these questions or cannot help, but perhaps others reading may, so please respond.  I know healing takes time, but advice on how to heal is very welcomed."
Divorce,3bx5xm,Blacksheep214,2,Wed Jul 8 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"I wish I had some answers for you.   It's been 2 years for me and the thoughts don't stop.  They make their way into the times we should feel close.   It's like I have a wall protecting me from believing him or his actions.  On one hand this is smart. On the other it prevents us from achieving the kind of relationship we should have.  Sex isn't between the two of us anymore.  The mistresses are always there in fleeting thoughts.   What he did with them,  said to them,  what they experienced.  They all (first and foremost my husband) robbed me of emotionally close intimate sex with him. I doubt that will ever come back, but time will tell.  There's not a day I'm not insecure about my body, or how I perform for him.  His whores were in it for the lust or whatever.  That's what was important to him and worth throwing away intimacy for.  So now that's gone and I'm in it for the ""great sex"" too.  He tells me I'm better...  but why the heck would I believe that?  I will always wonder if I'm good enough, sexy enough, dirty enough, frequent enough.  Because when I believed I was....I was wrong.    I'm sorry to say that healing is pretty much an excercise in giving up what you had and accepting what is.  Is living with the dark thoughts better than being without him at all? When a person loses a limb, or their eyesight or someone close to them....It's best that they embrace the new lifestyle instead of grieving the old one..... but that's SO much easier said than done.  Losing the marriage you thought you had is no different.      My bet is that your husband IS looking porn. They all do.  I thought mine was different once upon a time but they value lust and excitement more than intimacy and commitment.   It's not about ""Am I satisfied"" it's about ""Can I have more"".    Mine tries to avoid porn but it always wins eventually.  I can live with it or I can be alone. This is what I'm trying to accept.   I'm not a lesbian so I guess I just need to lower my expectations.   He's (they're) human.    I know that's not the story of healing you were hoping for.  I'm sorry :(       I wasn't thrilled with ""after the affair"".   It was ok, but the other one I mentioned was just SO good.  I how you get some answers in counseling.  It's a terrible road to recovery but you just need to decide if toughing it out and being OK with a broken relationship is better than losing the man you love(d).  For me I don't know life without him.  He's truly my other half.   I can tell you that the darkness gets less and less.  So there's that."

My STBX had an affair, we're both in the military,but we have 50/50 of our kids.  One thing that you'll get asked is, why do you want full custody of your child? From what I have gathered unless she is proven as unfit, then you more than likely won't get more than 50/50.  If she has to leave because of deployment, the child will more than likely be in your custody until the ex gets back and you guys resume whatever schedule was in place before or if she gets stationed else where, than you guys will have to be creative in a schedule. I have seen some of my friends loose custody of their kids because of the military, so it is possible, but don't do it in spite of her having an affair, in the end it's about what is best for the child.  And having both parents in their live is important.   Best seek advice from a lawyer though. Good luck, and remember, best for your child."

Divorce,3bul8q,PunkinNickleSammich,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:29:13 2015 UTC,They say that but no one really gives a shit and no one wants a mess to deal with.  There are always several people cheating on their spouses within a group especially on deployments. People just turn their heads.
Divorce,3bul8q,RedRocketGlare,2,Thu Jul 2 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, don't want to deal with it. My STBXs command just swept it under the rug, adultery and fraternizing. It seemed like they just didn't want to deal with it. Issued an LOI and that was it.  And you have to have significant proof of it, in which I did, and still have, but it's all up to the commands how they want to handle it."

Of course there are spouses who cheat, too."

Then when I was rear detachment because of an injury seeing wives throw themselves at Jody.  Or being on CQ and seeing soldiers bringing other guys wives into the B's and needing to deal with that drama.   Both sides have shitty people.

If not, you don't really have a good chance of getting sole custody, especially with your daughter being so young. I'm not going to necessarily assume you want full custody because you're trying to get back at her for cheating, but that you think it's in the best interest of your daughter.  My ex husband was in the military also and I was given primary custody, but our situation was not the same as yours. He initiated the divorce and was not going to be deployed anytime soon, as he'd just gotten back from overseas."
Divorce,3bul8q,rasconjon,2,Thu Jul 2 12:03:50 2015 UTC,Don't get the military involved. If she loses rank or gets court martial it will hurt you and your kid. Better to settle it between yourselves. Get her to pay spousal support.

Divorce,3bul8q,Altruizzy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"Lol... so they can typically(depending on what rank they are)... Tread water and retire at 20 with better benefits then the enlisted personnel regardless, where as the enlisted who get busted down with an Art 15, or worse, have to regain rank(maybe), before they get booted because they're a certain rank with more then a certain amount of time in service, and not be able to retire or be eligible for even the GI Bill to make their lives better.  Look at the example of Col Johnson...Well LTC Johnson... He ripped the Army off for approximately 300k, while having an affair with his Iraqi mistress who he was able to get out of Iraq and into Germany, and syphoned contracts to her dad. He needed to repay the 300k, and got demoted to LTC and was still able to retire... so he's eligible for a minimum of 4k+ a month retirement, half of which goes to his family...but he DID NOT get a bad conduct discharge or ANY jail time. His wife wanted him to get jail time. He got protected by the good ole boy system, which exists for O's."
Divorce,3bul8q,Wolf2121,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"OP here's the real truth. As a military spouse you'll get physical custody. Why? Because after you guys default to 50/50 there's a good chance she'll be stationed somewhere else, at which point the child will stay where they currently physically reside. Now if she stays in the same city you'll split custody except for when she deploys.  Also you're probably entitled to alimony and child support. Also you'll be entitled to 50% of the retirement for the period of her military career that you guys were married.   For you if would be 1.25% * 12 years, or 15% of her high three years pay when she retires.  Also if she contributed to the TSP your entitled to half of that as well."

If you can, find other people (or Reddit) to discuss those things that you would discuss with him before (e.g., TV).   And, I know everyone's probably tired of hearing me say this, but meditation has been a really important activity for me.

Divorce,3bv8ud,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Thu Jul 2 12:55:31 2015 UTC,"Typically in many states there is no such thing as legal separation unless you actually file for divorce.  At which point the clock starts ticking.  But you can cancel it right up to the day the judge is to sign the paperwork, and even if it does go through you can just re-marry via a judge if you wish to.  I would talk to a lawyer first.  You should be able to get an initial consultation."
Divorce,3bv8ud,TheEarlShibe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:33:20 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider is if you have children, you might want to put some kind of custody agreement in place now, on the chance you do get divorced. If you separate and do 50/50, it would be much easier to maintain that 50/50 split since it was the status quo. Also put any child support payments in that agreement, for the same reason."
Divorce,3bv8ud,Someguywhoneedshelp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"It all has to do with the state law where you file for a legal separation.  In Maine a legal separation is much the same as a divorce in that the same issues are settled as in a divorce such as alimony, child support, division of assets, division of liabilities, etc..    If you decide to end the legal separation then be sure to check the state law to determine the method of ending the status of legal separation.  There are reasons to file for a legal separation versus simply living apart. The biggest reason is that after your separation your assets are divided and should the separation not work and a divorce ensues the hard part should be over because the assets were allocated to each party during the separation decree."

I couldn't afford years of it, so other things that helped me are staying focused on my goal of not becoming a bitter old woman, writing, working out, music, and internet cats. If you can't guide yourself to feel powerful and positive, indulge the anger in a way that leads to something that will. Or, if feeling this kind of hatred and anger throws your energy off balance, engage in some contained destruction. Write down all the things and burn the list of ugliness. Paint a picture of how you feel with all this in you and burn it.  Maybe I like to burn things. ;p  Exercise is the one answer that I hated hearing when I was asking this years ago. It was the single most helpful thing to me. Self esteem, healthy body, all the lovely post-coital type glow, and endorphins...sometimes with a return of that old friend ""sex drive.""

I stepped in a good recovery path just few months ago. My advice? Feed him with booze like you are kindly trying to kill him. Acknowledge his feeling and his actions and never show pity. Accelerate his detachment from you showing glimpse of your joy for the new separated life. He could need to touch the bottom before emerging. Doing so he could risk his life. He will emerge much better and stronger. Leave him alone forever :-)

Perhaps say in therapy that you're worried about your child, since you have absolutely no right to talk about what's best for your STBX anymore? Is it at all possible that he's having a pretty typical reaction to finding out about being cheated on, and you're uncomfortable seeing it and overreacting?

It may also depend on how long you have been together and if you have any children.  The affair does not matter for the divorce or support, but some states do take adultery into consideration for the property division.  In general, the assets and liabilities split evenly. And yes, the courts will accept that a home with 25k equity can be offset by 25k of other marital assets. The problem will be refinancing the mortgage in your name alone - if you cannot remove her name from the mortgage the courts can compel you to sell the property to release her from the liability. Same with the autos - if they have aloan attached it will reduce the value of the car, and if one or the other of you take possession you will have to refinance to remove the other's name from the loan."

Make sure you read and understand everything the lawyer gives you. If she's already broken the trust don't let her back in. I cannot stress that enough. Don't be friends at least for now. Give it at least six months after the divorce is final to even talk to her. I'm being dragged through the shit by my STBX who cheated on me, makes more money than I do and still gets to call the shots because there is a gender bias when it comes to parenting. You're lucky you don't have kids. Get it done, sign the papers and move on. Life is too short. Trust me on this."

Other assets will be split.  If you want the house you will have to refinance to get her off the mortgage and give her half of the current equity.  She is also entitled to half the current equity in the car and other assets.  Something is weird with your lawyer."
Divorce,3brkzn,daydreamer1989,3,Wed Jul 1 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"Your feelings and heartbreak are actually a good thing. That sounds counterintuitive, but consider for a moment people who do behave like your ex. People who are either narcissistic or emotionally immature enough to throw a loved one aside and move on to another just as quickly don't truly know what love is, nor how to express it or maintain a healthy long-term relationship.  You are hurting now, but that only means you know how to invest into a relationship. You will find love again and when you do it will be a far fuller experience than people like your ex will ever know."
Divorce,3brkzn,GrandEthos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:37:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment. Some of my friends do think that my ex is a narcissist but I have been unsure of that because in the beginning I do believe that he was able to put his selfishness aside and tried to care for me and our relationship. I do, however, believe he is emotionally immature. His mother died from cancer when he was a young boy and his father never comforted him... just sent him to school the next day. His sister ran away from home after the mother died and he didn't see her for years. I think this has caused him to not be able to deal with emotions very well and has caused him to have poor communication skills when it comes to conflict.  Even so, he is seriously one of the most outgoing and charming people I have ever met. I just wish he would have gone to therapy with me.  I really appreciate your comment and am saving it to read it whenever I feel hopeless again."

I've been going to therapy and even though I've only had a few sessions, it really does help. You and I and all of us will be okay, content, happy and able to love again, we just need time."
Divorce,3brkzn,Delet3r,2,Thu Jul 2 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"Some people fear being ""alone"" and so they move quickly onto a new relationship after one ends. I'm going through something similar with the end of a three-year relationship. It wasn't a very good relationship; lots of stress and she's an emotionally distant person.  I finally moved on because it felt like my life was stalling out. It hurt to leave, mostly because she has two young kids who I adore. The father is dead (suicide), so I felt an incredible amount of guilt when I left, even though I felt I had no other choice at that point. She was mostly unappreciative and didn't seem to put much effort into the relationship after a while.  Two months later, she started dating someone older from work. He was finalizing a divorce of nearly 20 years and he's also got two kids. I haven't spoken to her in over a month, but I believe they're still together. And it hurt like hell to think how quickly she moved on to someone else AND essentially slotted him in to where I was in several ways. I wouldn't go back, because it was a lousy relationship, but it was a tough pill to swallow to realize that while she probably cared about me, it was no big deal to just move on to the next guy.  But she's always moved on fast from relationships. She was engaged to the father of her children, then broke it off (for good reasons), and was casually dating someone within a couple of months. That ended and I came into the picture. She's basically had very little time in her adult life where she either wasn't in a relationship or ""talking"" to someone. She's one of the most emotionally unavailable girls I've ever known (and is one by her own admission), but I believe she finds more comfort in having a guy around.  Despite this, I don't really think she's capable of true romantic love. She's not incapable of compassion, but our relationship (and it sounds like her relationship with the kids' father) was very... business-like and void of much tenderness.   She's not a bad person, but I don't know if she has it in her to really be a great contributor to a strong, powerful, romantic relationship. Yet she will probably always have someone in the picture, because she also lacks the capability to stand on her own for too long."
Divorce,3brkzn,Delet3r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:03:15 2015 UTC,"Not to be the bearer of bad news, but I think the fact that he broke it off with you after a great vacation means that you two were not in love with each other, you were in love with him.  And he was going through the motions, but not feeling what you felt.  A guy here on this subreddit told me a couple months ago that: ""I've realized that my emotions over ""losing her"" are really about losing ""what I THOUGHT she was"".""  It's the truth.  You ask why the guy was able to move on so fast, its because like my wife, he did not have the feelings that you had, but pretended to have them to get you to lower your guard and be vulnerable with him.  He sounds like a manipulator, but then again you have to remember that people in this forum are generally all heartbroken/hurt people, so maybe I am just projecting my own fears onto your story.    I personally think that it helps to get over someone if you become aware, like the quote I noted above, that the perosn was NOT what you thought.  You were making assumptions about how great he was, and THAT is why you loved him, but he was obviously not that person at all.  He was able to move on so fast because he did not have to get over his feelings for you, as you have to with him.  As Grandethos said in his comment, your ex does not have the capacity for real love, so you will be happier in the future than he will be.  Just don't let yourself get too guarded.    not sure if that helps. :("

There were so many signs that he was not fully committed to our relationship (emotionally, at least. I have never suspected him of cheating). I kept trying though because I honestly felt that if you love someone you never let them go no matter what... I am so ashamed to say that I am one of those people who thought love conquers all."
Divorce,3brkzn,Delet3r,3,Wed Jul 1 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to realize it, I know from experience.  And it sounds like your husband was at least nicer than my wife, my wiffe was miserable, derogatory, couldn't even give me a hug. So it's probably harder for you than it is with me, if so... I feel your pain, and sympathize.    I wouldnt be ashamed to say you felt love conquers all, it's just part of what people never tell us.  Unfortunately people all want to believe in fairy tales because everyone around us constantly tells us that 'love conquers all'.  our society pushes the idea so hard, why WOULDN'T we all believe that it is how it works?    But i think the problem is as we get older, we don't want to ruin things for younger people, so its like a huge secret.  plus no one wants to admit they are in a bad marriage (like i was) so we all smile and pretend we are just as happy as anyone else.  So you grow up, thinking 'this is how it works'.    Sorry I am rambling, just trying to say 'dont be so hard on yourself'. :)  It sounds like you have the ability to care about other people, and that puts you ahead of a LOT of other people out there.  Just try to think how great it will be when you find someone who DOES return the feelings.  By your name, im guessing youre 26 years old?  You have no idea how much i wish I was 26 years old.  I am 43 and having to start over, you have your life ahead off you still.

Divorce,3br445,Catcherofsouls,4,Wed Jul 1 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"I am going back to that as of now actually.  People kept telling me to be polite and nice, to not piss her off, so that she wouldnt try to screw me over with the kids and our separation, so I had been trying to be friendly, try to get to where we could chat, small talk, etc.    It was a huge mistake.  Plus I admittedly said some things to try and make her know that I was emotionally healing, but even though i wanted her to know that I wasnt the lovesick puppy anymore, all it did, I think, was cause more trouble.    As of now I told her that we should just keep to ourselves as much as possible until she goes, and try to regain the friendship down the road if possible, for the kids.   It will hopefully not even put us in sitautions that would tempt me to want to hurt her, out of revenge, etc.  Its not easy to have someone say ""hey i never loved you at all, thats why i never wanted sex and why i always put you down and couldnt even compliment or hug you!' and not want to hurt them back.  I think.  edit: actually i remember what started all this.  I originally just told her ""i wont bother you anymore, I am ready to move on, I will miss you but i have to let you go"" and all she did was be super nice and text me constantly the rest of the day, ending with a ""hey the guys here at work play this new game on their phones, thought you might like it..."" which was something i would have loved to get from her while married, so it burned me that she would only be that nice after i said I needed to distance myself from her.  I told her ""thats not appropriate anymore, those type of texts are for friends, or boyfriends, and I am neither"".  And she got piiiiiissed.  I was kind of rude, but shit, you can only take so much crap before you snap.    Thats what started down this road of tit for tat.  :/"

She's insane, her only focus right now is on finding a man, it's very clear.

Doesn't mean it can't be just as forced onto you as when the other one takes initiative.   Sometimes we have to break our own heart in order to do what needs to be done. And fairness has nothing to do with it.
Divorce,3bql3e,Fugera,2,Wed Jul 1 13:08:28 2015 UTC,I can almost wonder if this is not the rule rather than the exception.

Yes, I am well aware of the fact that your spouse might have been Satan and was slowly killing your soul, but being left...there is a level of feeling like nothing that I cannot begin to describe to you. You walked away with  dignity, making a choice, we are left trying to scramble and acquire dignity as we rebuild from something that was forced upon us (I say this acknowledging some of us caused the divorce or played a huge part in the marriage failing)."

That can be a reflection on your own failings and some people take it very seriously.  A marriage is the biggest decision in many people's lives and its failure is not something that should be taken lightly (Sorry Mr. Trump and Mr. Gingrich).  You would probably be an insensitive jerk if you felt nothing.  I think this is a good thing for you.  Some people do let the marriage go to long and feel nothing at the end too, so I guess it is possible to feel nothing too.  You need to move on and be happy.  The best outcome is that you both find something that is a better match for you.    I do recommend that you talk to someone who has gone through a divorce that is close to you and let them know what is going on.  Often times you are too close to it to see the bigger picture.  Even professional counseling will likely not hurt you in the divorce (unless there are kids and the other side is going to paint you as depressive and suicidal).

Basically you've discovered you're a selfish jerk and want to find a new life.   Stop kidding yourself about anything else.   Don't waste your money on therapy and go talk with an attorney about ending it.   What you don't get is the ability to look good doing it.

You sound like you're trying to set yourself up as the victim in your marriage. My suggestion would be honesty with yourself first, and then your wife. If you actually want to be ""nice,"" you will worry about her and put her needs before how you want to appear to everyone, including yourself."
Divorce,3bqgce,nitabirdonit,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:16:05 2015 UTC,"if your family and friends have access to you on the internet, you've already blown that.   Minor point in the grand scheme of things. This is about her and this is about me. I don't actually care that much what my friends think; I just don't think I want to have to tell them all of the below and don't want to say ""it didn't work out; none of your business either"" so I wanted some help with the wording. But let's leave that aside for now.    honesty with yourself first, and then your wife   I'm being honest with her. I've told her I'm not attracted to her and that I really never have been. I've told her I'm not into her because she's not ambitious or opinionated or independent enough. I've told her she's not passionate enough; I've told her she's not emotionally deep enough. I've told her I'm not into her because she doesn't touch me enough or because we can't emotionally connect when we're having sex. I've told her I'm into thin women with no body hair. I've told her I don't like her scent. I've told her everything that turns me off about her.   I'm being honest and it just hurts. Everyone. You think all that's easy to tell someone? You think that's easy to hear for her? Does honesty even help? I would say based on my experience, it hasn't. Those are some of the most brutally honest things I've said to someone. And it sucked.   But the reason I voiced all of that was because all the therapists and people in my life said being honest would help - get the issues on the table, let each of us make a decision about what we can/can't will/won't change. I had kept most of that stuff to myself over the years trying to convince myself that none of it mattered and I could let go and just be with someone that had so much going for them otherwise.   I finally broke when I realized I probably couldn't live the rest of my life not being fully happy in my marriage. I hoped that, by being honest, there would be a way to solve some of the things that turned me off. Maybe she could never lose enough weight. But maybe by developing a deeper emotional connection, she enjoy sex more and then I'd enjoy it more. Maybe she could have hair removed or flirt more or learn to share her feelings more. But even though she's tried to change all these things, it's apparent to me that this is not like the 90s HS rom-com ""She's all that"" where you can give her a makeover and voila, instant attraction. There's something fundamental about her that I just can't get over. Is it her body? Is it her scent? Is it her lack of sexuality? Is it her emotional closedness? Yes, probably all those things. maybe something else. But is it fair for me to expect her to keep trying to change when all she's done so far and all the work we've done in therapy have resulted in nada?   You think I think I'm a victim here? I know I'm the villain; I just want to be a less painful villain for her. I want to know whether a separation helps more than divorce papers more than a gradual realization that this isn't working through therapy.   And lest anyone accuse me of not trying to change as well, the only things she's identified as bothering her are that I don't touch her enough or tell her I love her. So I've been doing more of that. THAT feels dishonest, but I've been doing it anyways, in the hopes that it unlocks some feeling in me. But I've been through this before - I convinced myself I was in love with her because I wanted to be in love with her. So bad - she's so perfect in so many ways and we had such a great emotional bond and shared so many things in common. But why should I keep trying to convince everyone, including myself, that I'm in love with someone I'm not?"
Divorce,3bqgce,rasconjon,4,Wed Jul 1 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"Well I mean she's going to think you're an asshole.   Why do you need a 'sympathetic reason' for your family and friends to understand. If you're comfortable with the reasons your leaving, then just be honest. Don't distort the truth to get 'sympathy.' If anyone deserves sympathy it's your STBX.

I'd argue faking vs being real is based on %'s isn't it? You won't always think your spouse is the hottest thing to walk the earth, but if she's at 90%, you're probably good, right? Likewise with faking it. I went into counseling 50% sure it wasn't going to help. Now I'm 90% sure. To me if I keep going, I'm faking it. But to others, you might want to keep going as long as there's some shred of hope left.   when in reality you either got married for the wrong reasons   Hindsight is 20/20.

At the same time you say she's wonderful.  Which is it?   Basically to me .you're  a ""grass is greener"" person.   Which leads me to ask - is there someone else?"
Divorce,3bqgce,livingthedreamnow,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't been telling her she's bad for years; I've told her all this in the last 3 months after only giving her constant encouragement and praise.   And she's much more into sex with me now that I mentioned all this, so that's not the deal.   Grass is greener? You may be right. But what would you recommend? Just deal with it?  Someone else? I said in the OP there was an affair. I doubt that would still be available but i wouldn't know. But you're right to criticize me comparing my wife to someone I had a short-term intimate sexy fling. But I'm also comparing how I feel about my wife to how I felt about people before her. And how other people I know describe their feelings for their spouses."
Divorce,3bqgce,cristinanana,3,Wed Jul 1 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"I can relate to your story in a number of ways. I was married to someone for 10 years that I was never really physically attracted to.  When I married her, I thought I was being a better person than the average Joe. I thought that I could look past all of the ""superficial"" stuff, and build a life long partnership based on shared goals and mutual kindness. As she piled on weight (aprox 100lbs), I never said a negative word about it, I was ""better than that"". Over the years, my wife began making complaints that I wasn't physical enough with her, and I did my best to pick it up,, but ultimately I felt like I was lying through my teeth because I was doing it to satisfy her requests alone. I figured that we were both ultimately making sacrifices for the marriage, so I sucked it up and did all I could, and I would have done it forever because vows, and we did have kids to think about. Long story short, she ended up cheating and asking me for a divorce.  The way my marriage ended meant I was ultimately spared a life of numbing mediocrity, without having to bear the guilt of ending my marriage and breaking my vows. Even though it wasn't what I wanted, the divorce allowed me to live a life that is far more fulfilling, and joy filled, than the married life I had.   Now that I've got some years behind me since the divorce, I've been able to really examine my own marriage and life through a much wider lens. I'm able to understand what you're saying, without judging you too negatively.  You and I both made the same mistake, and that mistake was made all the way back at the altar. Hindsight now clearly shows that it is foolish to the point of gross negligence, to commit to marriage with a woman you are not physically attracted to. All of that pride in not being a ""shallow"" person concerned about the attractiveness of our partner, was unwarranted, because ultimately we were woefully ignorant and overconfident (albeit well intention-ed) in what we could be happy with for a lifetime. I chose to resign to my mistake and live out my life unfulfilled romantically,, but I certainly won't fault you for wanting to correct yours, especially because you don't have kids in the mix, and you only get one life to live for yourself.  So, to now finally get to your question of what to do.   First, find a good lawyer, and get the initial process going. Some states require a formal separation period of 1-6 months, before divorce will be granted, and this initial complaint process usually signifies the beginning of the separation.  Next tell her you are filing for divorce. She'll need to start looking for her own lawyer.  When everyone is calmed down, start working towards a fair property settlement. If you two can agree on this part, you'll save yourselves a small fortune. This is when you may want to negotiate the extras you are willing to do, to help her get on her own two feet.  And again, I'll stress the point I made previously on your other post,, do not concern yourself about what anyone thinks of this divorce. There is no way to come out of this looking good, so try not to think about it at all. You just have to get through it. I'd strongly suggest getting a good individual therapist, and using those sessions to dump your emotions out. I specifically tried to avoid all conversations about the divorce with friends and family, and just kept it to ""it didn't work out, it's a shame, but everyone is doing fine,, thanks for asking"".  Best of luck,, I'm sure this is a gut-wrenching position you are in right now."

Divorce,3bqgce,fausto412,0,Wed Jul 1 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate you weighing in, and so thoughtfully. Of all the commentators and people I've spoken with, it does indeed feel like you can best relate to what I've put myself through.    All of that pride in not being a ""shallow"" person concerned about the attractiveness of our partner, was unwarranted   so true. I feel like such an arrogant asshole whose comeuppance is resulting in collateral damage. Unfair to her. But I guess the hope is that less unfair than me pretending and eventually having another affair and doing more damage. Maybe the just punishment for my mistake would be for me to sack up, put on a happy face, and deal with it for another 50 years, but it seems so hard to believe I'll be able to do that. Or maybe I'll wind up with someone else down the line who does the same thing I did back to me.    The way my marriage ended meant I was ultimately spared a life of numbing mediocrity, without having to bear the guilt of ending my marriage and breaking my vows.   I think ultimately I may have an easier decision because we don't have kids, but it's made harder by the fact that she didn't cheat and also has taken major strides to improve her attractiveness over time. I think the hardest thing for me is not what others will think of me or whether I'll find someone else who is as good as her but more attractive to me, but imagining her feeling shellshocked and sad for a long time to come. I guess that tells me I still care about her, but gosh, is that a reason to stay with someone and live a lie? Because of how sad they'd be when you leave them? Yikes.   I'd strongly suggest getting a good individual therapist, and using those sessions to dump your emotions out   I have been - it has been quite helpful   First, find a good lawyer, and get the initial process going   How does one find a ""good"" lawyer?

You could pick all 3 from the yellow pages if you don't want to risk rumors starting, and pick the one that suits you best.

The best thing you can do for yourself is get personal therapy and get yourself back to a better place emotionally before you decide you want to be in a relationship.  I know the feeling of wanting to do to your STBX what they did to you, to validate yourself through sex with another person, it's a normal thing to feel in your situation.

However, it sounds like now you may be getting a better understanding about the treatment your mother has surely experienced in her marriage as your Dad melts down.  I think the only thing you can do here is define your boundaries and stick to them. Do not be anybody's soft shoulder. Do not accept any blame for anybody else's actions or decisions. Do not offer to help. Everyone in this situation is an adult and is responsible for their own actions. You can't change them or the situation. None of this is your fault.

Divorce,3bou87,Daemon42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:47:28 2015 UTC,"You need to talk to a CA divorce lawyer.  I am not your lawyer.  Being ""legally separated"" is probably defined by your states courts or statutes.  People get ""legally separated"" because their religion forbids divorce or they need to keep both of them on the employed spouse's insurance.  In my state it also avoids a 6 month residency requirement.  Most ""legal separation"" agreements in my state are also property settlements and sometimes include alimony, though they do not have to be.  It sounds to me like you are actually asking about what happens while the divorce is ongoing.  In most places the Court will make that determination for you.  If the Husband has more money, he pays the big bills . . . .    If you have moved out, but not started the divorce yet, I think a Court in most places would look at your living expenses and what you need to get by in maybe determining if you should pay alimony after the divorce.  From this perspective, you do not want to be generous in a voluntary separation scenario. It would look like you were announcing to the Court that you do not need much.  ""Isn't it true /u/opiecunningham that you gave stbx lots of money because you don't need it, and can in fact pay it/""  ""Why did you give her so much money then?""    It truly sounds like you feel guilty or are trying to do the right thing.  Get a lawyer and tell them that is what you want.  Good luck.

Divorce,3bmnmc,LivingInMyBubble,6,Tue Jun 30 13:24:59 2015 UTC,"There's a prevalent myth that children are more resilient and will just bounce back from things like death and divorce in their lives. I think that the reason that people think this is that children don't display their grief in the same way that adults do.   Anyway, I don't know if your kid needs therapy, but $150 seems like a small price to pay to make sure that he understands and knows how to express himself in positive ways. Likewise, I think it's important for parents to recognize that they probably could benefit from learning how to help their kids cope as well.  And, to be fair, just because he isn't having those ""thoughts"" right now definitely doesn't mean he won't have them in the future. It seems silly to wait until he's having a problem to fix it rather than trying to give him the tools to deal with the issues as they come up."
Divorce,3bmnmc,Justkeepbreathing123,2,Tue Jun 30 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's important that parents know how to help their children adjust to a huge change in their life.  And I didn't mean to suggest that just because a child doesn't need therapy NOW, that they won't ever need it.  My counselor has said that it is highly likely that my children will need therapy at a point in the future.  What is important to me and my situation is that they do not need it NOW, for the reasons that he gave me- that kids can develop a tolerance for therapy- that you don't try and address problems that haven't happened yet.  I'll admit that I was a little surprised, but he has seen more cases than I ever will, so I will bow to his experience."
Divorce,3bmnmc,cyanidequeen22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"Has the counselor interacted with the child at all? If not, it is highly unprofessional for them to suggest that it would be unnecessary without actually taking the time to speak with the child.   I'd also be interested in seeing what kind of research the counselor is citing to show that your child would be at risk for developing a tolerance to therapy. I would bet a million bazillion trillion dollars that having your child speak to a psychologist or a psychiatrist one time is not going to put your son at significant risk for developing this tolerance.  I'd be wary of the ""appeal to authority"" logical fallacy in this case. Very wary."
Divorce,3bmnmc,Justkeepbreathing123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:47:59 2015 UTC,A professional child psychologist has made their career about how to communicate with children.  No they may not get the same information they would get out of an adult.  From a child the information the therapist could get may be fragmented and colored by the latest things to float through the child's head.  However what they do get they know how to interpret and can help both the child and parents to deal with it.

Divorce,3bmnmc,LadyFaye,4,Tue Jun 30 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"Counseling is a VERY good thing. If your child is verbalizing the fact that s/he misses the other parent while that child is with either of you, that is a symptom of your child's difficulty dealing with the situation. Personally, I would go. Having to spend an hour with the STBX seems to be a small price to pay for the emotional well being of your child.   When I recently split with my ex, I sought counsel from a psychiatrist/psychologist in order to make sure that my child was dealing well with the loss of a step-parent. I wish I had done so when I split with my child's mother. I would, however, avoid social workers. In my experience, people with the credentials of a psychologist or psychiatrist are a lot more helpful. I also tend to prefer it if the person is not credited solely as a psychiatrist (as I have, in the past, found that some psychiatrists are a little too quick to prescribe medication; I prefer therapy based approaches).   My 2 cents."
Divorce,3bmnmc,Subject-Entropy,2,Tue Jun 30 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"Do either of you see counselors at this time?  Perhaps this might be a good question for your counselor.    My kids are in their early teens, and I have spoken with my counselor about just that issue- do they need counseling?  He has advised that they do not get counseling unless there are distinct problems that I am seeing, such as being withdrawn, poor academic performance, etc.  He also said that you get one good shot at doing therapy with a child, because the child can quickly become therapy-wise, and can assume precocious behavior specifically because they are seeing a therapist.  This might only apply for older kids/teens, however."

I am a go it alone type) and I do not think she is seeing one either.

Professional counseling is a good thing.  I too, considered professional counseling nothing more than a secular ""blame game"" allowing the counselled to validate bad behavior and opinions.  That changed when I went to a state certified family therapist (psychologist) recommended by my church.  I discovered that there are more tools to deal with emotional problems than just my religion.  The use of those tools are intended to not blame someone else, but to assist you with fixing your own problems.  Being willing to acknowledge that someone else hurt you can help you deal with how you may have responded.  Yes, spend the money for your child to receive state certified professional counseling if there is any suggestion that it could be helpful.  Also, please seek the same for yourself.  Please don't ignore the available tools to help you though this tough time."
Divorce,3bmnmc,Ineffably_Sublime,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"Your children may need those tools as well.  Because children don't display emotions and stress the way adults do I think it would be wise to pay for the child to see a certified counselor.

Divorce,3bmnmc,FusRo_Duh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"I am not your lawyer.  Half the time I recommend counseling for a child it is because the kid truly needs it.  Sometimes it is because I want the Court to see how nutty one parent is.  When you go to Court it is your word against hers, and the Court has no clue and usually splits the baby.  WHEN THERE IS A NEUTRAL THIRD PARTY SAYING SOMETHING, COURTS LISTEN.  The Courts in my state usually go along when one parent wants to have counseling because the thought is it won't hurt the child and maybe the kid needs it.  The therapist probably is doing something called ""play therapy.""  You can look that up yourself.  If your child is diagnosed with something, then your insurance may pick up the tab.   If you have joint legal custody, the Courts in my state will not care what the therapist says UNLESS YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION TO HIRE THEM.  However, if you have agreed to counseling, paid or not objected, then you might be screwed already.    You really need to be involved in who his hired to treat your kid.  Is the therapist a family friend of hers.  Does this therapist work with her lawyer a lot?    If counseling is ongoing already, you need to be an active participant.  You do not want your Ex to fill the therapists head with all the shit you did.  You need to appear and be a cool dude.  THE THERAPIST MAY BE MOM'S KEY TO MODIFYING YOUR CURRENT CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT.

Divorce,3blhrc,Someguywhoneedshelp,3,Tue Jun 30 07:53:08 2015 UTC,"Does that make me a good guy?   Don't be worried about protecting your image during divorce,,, it's pretty much impossible, and a waste of time. People are going to say what they say, and they'll think what they think,, pretty much regardless of how much you pay your STBX. In my own case, my wife filed for divorce, we split everything 50/50, and then I gave her a house completely outside our settlement. On top of that,  my support dollars pay all of her bills each month,, and still, in every story version she has of me,,, I'm an asshole. Luckily I gave her the house to keep my children geographically close to me, not to protect my reputation among shared friends.  I think I understand your thought process. You feel guilt over the sacrifices she's made for you, now that you want divorce. It's good for you to examine how your actions will affect her,, it might not be a good thing to legally bind yourself to acts of kindness unnecessarily.   You've got options. You could work out a property settlement, that still aims for 50/50 but gives her more cash. You could work out a settlement that gives her more than 50% of the marital net worth. You could also choose to divorce cleanly 50/50 with no formal alimony, and voluntarily send cash each month to her for a period of time after divorce. I like the last option because you retain control over the amount and duration,,, AND you also get to see how she treats you through the divorce process as well. Her and her father's behavior through the divorce process, may have you seriously reconsidering how generous you want to be a year from now. You just don't know yet.  I would start with what the law requires, and make adjustments to those items first (asset / liability splits). If you want to go above and beyond that, I'd strongly advise that you keep that on your own terms, and not incorporate it into the legally binding settlement.   And get a lawyer ASAP, if you don't already have one."

Post-divorce, doesn't she live a bit hand-to-mouth, wondering if I'll make a payment this month or not?

Hang in there man. College will be a great experience for you as long as you stay involved with the school. Have you talked with your school's veteran coordinator? They are there to help us. Also, when I started college I decided to segregate myself from the traditional students because I thought they are young and stupid and hung around other vets. Try not to do this as they can be pretty lame and don't interact with other students much as most are married with kids.  Look to the future man! You are going to be a fucking Marine surrounded by a ton of hot college chicks!   You have to keep looking forward or you will be hurting yourself. You made it through the Corps and I'm sure you went through some tough shit, as did I, and this divorce for me seems to be tougher than anything I did, emotionally, while I was in. But, we don't give up we keep pushing, start working out, hiking, skiing, anything. Don't start drinking like you're in the Corps again. I'm only four weeks into my divorce and I feel you brother."

If your TBX is pretty it's harder.  What you need to do is fine tune tune your argument (""attack"" really) to a good soundbite for the mediator and/or judge to hear. IF your ex tries to back out of paying her half share of the debt then immediately go on full offense.  In my divorce I tried to be nice about things and I got screwed. My wife was given a total free pass on our joint debt but got major assets from me. It seems the judge wanted to come to her financial rescue despite her -- legally -- having no leg to stand on."
Divorce,3bj7eg,Delet3r,2,Mon Jun 29 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"I had individual therapy which helped me a lot: she helped me see some of the meanness in my relationship, where I had trouble seeing it: I was buying into my (now ex-)wife's world view and criticisms of me and they weren't warranted. She helped me with a phobia of mine and did EMDR, which was helpful.  I think in general couples counseling can be useful in a couple of circumstances, but not every single one: when there is a mystery to solve (why am I feeling this way? why is someone behaving this way?) and when there is communication that needs to happen but its' being short-circuited by emotionalism or bullshit. The latter especially is a skill more than it is a body of knowledge. My ex-wife was extremely resistant to couple's counseling exactly because it would have meant communicating effectively and stopping the hiding behind tantrums and barbs.  The industry and profession seems like kind of a shambles to me from the perspective of scientific rigor. There's good and bad, but lots of sloppy thinking, a huge amount of just making things up that sound good (I don't think I've ever heard anything from evolutionary psychology that didn't fit this description), and so forth. Human beings are complicated, they're hard to study at the best of time and humans studying their own thought processes... it's no wonder. Take depression: antidepressants as a class, for example, have a risk, side effect, and efficacy that seems like would prompt you to use them rarely, with care, and under very close and probably expert supervision. Yet they're extremely commonly prescribed by casual practitioners as a first resort, before seeing what can be done with, say, exercise and CBT.  Just like with doctors, you need to be on top of the work you're doing and what you're getting out of it. It's all work you do that someone is helping you with. You should not expect to just let an expert take care of it.  Knowing more biology than your doctor doesn't make your doctor useless, because she's used to treating people all the time, and has experience and insight, augmented with specialized knowledge which isn't quite the same as comprehensive physiological knowledge. They can be your invaluable guide but you should absolutely still be your own advocate, do your own research, have your own understanding of what's going on, what the next steps are and why. And you should choose a doctor with whom you can do that best. And I think it's the same for a therapist."
Divorce,3bj7eg,doublenut,2,Mon Jun 29 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"This makes sense.  i worried that a counselor would feel I was being presumptuous, trying to do my own research online.  But what about the idea of people who 'get just enough information to get in trouble'?   As someone who builds his own pcs and stuff, I have seen waaaaay too many PCs screwed up by a nephew or family friend that thought he would 'tweak tcpip settings to get the cable modem to run faster'.    So I went to a counselor because I had read, and been told, that there was more to counseling than just 'becoming aware'.  But I don't seem to get any of that, even when i ask.  Mostly it seems I get a lot of validation (finally, I didn't even realize that when i was annoyed with the first counselors, it was because they werent really telling me ""yes you got screwed here"" or at least explaining WHY i was wrong to think so) but no 'solutions'.  I just asked my psychologist ""so I have an issue apparently in desiring women who have issues or are emotionally unavailable.  how do i make myself not be attracted to the dangerous girls, and not push away healthy girls like I did in my past?""  He doesnt have an answer for me other than ""being aware and making better choices"".  How do I choose to be attracted to emotionally available women?  I read online that people do get therapy and they learn to not be attracted to emotionally unavailable people, but no one seems to know how its actually done."

There's a feedback loop as you learn enough to figure out if the provider is good or the right person for you, and then you get better guidance, and then you know more, etc. I mean, that's my theory, anyway.  CBT is a framework that can get you partway on a path to controlling how you think about feel about things. It's still work. There are no miracles or anything easy enough to even call a ""solution,"" probably."
Divorce,3bj7eg,Watermelogisty,2,Mon Jun 29 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"The fact is that the good providers [usually] don't take insurance.  This is a fact of life. Either they eat the headache getting $80 a session and dealing with a company second guessing them, or they go independent and get $120+ a session.  Therapists that take insurance tend to be overworked/overbooked and hard to see.  As well as being (on average) younger and less experienced or older and less up-to-date on modern things like CBT and mindfulness.  Therapists that don't take insurance are expensive, PLUS there's no good way to really rate how they'll work for you until you've spent 2 or 3 sessions.  That being said, therapy WORKS when it's high quality.  It took me years to find my current personal LCSW/MFT who is good and still takes insurance. I attribute the quality to her dedication to being up-to-date in mindfulness and CBT studies, as well as her years of experience.  Now, let's get to what you're supposed to be getting out of a couples therapist: (NOTE: NOT A MENTAL HEALTH PRO, JUST A USER OF THE SYSTEM)   Both parties should feel heard. Homework should be assigned, both reading and actions. Honesty on what they're hearing. Past experience in helping couples.   What you need to bring to the couples therapy session:   What you want. Couples therapy is not about figuring this out, what you want is the domain of your personal therapist. Willingness to listen. Willingness to talk.   The success of the couples therapist is really in your hands.  A good one will listen to both of you and try to get you to restate what you're saying in a clearer manner.  Then, they'll give you things to work on to help you get what you want and give your partner what they want.  If there's resistance, they should be good at calling you/them on it and asking questions on they underlying why."
Divorce,3bj7eg,Watermelogisty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting.   What about taking insurance causes therapists to not be up to date on modern things?  Any tips on finding a good therapist?  Is it possible that the type of insurance we have is why I seem to only get bad therapists?  I am only in personal therapy, my wife refused to go to therapy, and we are in the process of separating.   Therapists that take insurance tend to be overworked/overbooked and hard to see.   this fits my psychologist.  He works 40 hours a week... somewhere, and then sees a couple people after work every day, and apparently works saturdays too.  50+ hours a week or so it seems."
Divorce,3bj7eg,TheEarlShibe,2,Mon Jun 29 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"Therapists seem to accept insurance for 2 reasons:   They don't have enough referrals to maintain a practice on their own. They work for a corp/group that aggregates things for them.   The second group tends to be the one (in my experience) is less up-to-date. Something about the corp protects them from having less clients (since you're just slotted in to the next available during intake), so they either move up and out to a private practice, they go part-time and work in a facility, or they just stagnate there.  The quality of insurance accepting and not therapists PALES in comparison to the quality differential in insurance vs. non-insurance psychiatrists. The best psychiatrists are extremely expensive.  As far as my personal journey, I needed the following:   Someone who challenged me to work outside of session, but didn't make me feel bad when I didn't do it. Someone who is up on their Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. (Seriously, it's ""modern"" in that it's 30y old. There's no excuse.)   Better than CBT in my opinion is DBT (Dialectical), which adds in mindfulness and some other subtleties, but that's more towards my specific problems.  Someone who assigns bibliotherapy. (That's books by actual psychology people like Dr. David Burns, or Jon Kabat-Zin, or any of countless legitimate and well-regarded people) Someone who didn't talk to me about things.   Like I said, it took me the better part of 4 years to find a therapist I'm happy with."
Divorce,3bj7eg,Watermelogisty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"Why would better psychologists and psychiatrists not take insurance?  It basically guarantees they are only getting clients from the top few percent of wage earners.  There's no way I could pay $400+ a month to see a therapist an hour a week.    If what you are saying is true, it's pretty depressing. :(  I wanted to get my kids in therapy down the road for the upcoming divorce, and .... their mother really has issues.  I can't think that they will be able to get to adulthood without some scars.    To make things worse, I live in a pretty rural area, so there aren't a lot of therapists here anyway.  It's not like I can just keep tossing them aside and find a dozen more.  Although the list I was looking at was also the ones that my insurance company provided.  I wonder if the quality of my insurance affects the quality of therapist?"
Divorce,3bj7eg,Watermelogisty,2,Mon Jun 29 19:37:45 2015 UTC,Because any therapist worth their salt gets $120+ per hour. Insurance will only cover say $60-80 per hour. Why would you take $30-$80 less per hour if you don't have to?  Most insurance doesn't do a good job of covering any mental healthcare that is worth a damn.
Divorce,3bj7eg,Watermelogisty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:18:26 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they? Barring repeats, most independent therapists work 60 hours a week, which means they can only see 60-80 people.  This is not including time to keep up with their industry (conferences, books, training), and the expenses of keeping an office/answering service/etc..  Would you rather get $60 an hour or $120 an hour?  Would you rather have the freedom to negotiate directly with your patients on how much they can afford?  Also, it's not the quality (as in how much they pay) of your insurance, it's the network of the carrier.  If you have out-of-network coverage, you can leverage that, but thats its own special hell.  Most insurances pay near the same as each other. (For example, I pay a $30 copay on a $120 charge, and then they throw my therapist another $27 bucks and call it even.  I've been on other systems and it's within a couple of bucks.)   I'm mainly angry at the way mental health is treated as a second-tier part of health care.  This is in addition to the terrible state our medical industrial complex is leaving the country in.  And god have mercy on you if you need inpatient mental care."

Now for some hope:   The field of mental health is starting to accelerate and get more acceptance. We've made advancements in technique and drugs that are revolutionary and verifiable by mainstream science. We're starting to find more and more links between neuropsychology and the rest of the body. The stigma of therapy/psychiatric help is starting to erode.  It's becoming easier to ask for help.

So a question for you, as you seem to have a pretty good handle on therapy and how it works.  Did the things I mentioned about this psychologist raise any red flags for you?   It seems attachment theory at least is pretty big and well known, I am spending money and time to get help, but how good is that help if the person doesn't seem to know the basics of what drives people to act certain ways?  Attachment styles seem to be related to everything,  I even found a study that shows that a persons attachment style is correlated to the type of sexual fantasies they have.    It bothers me that he doesn't know much about attachment theory at all."
Divorce,3bj7eg,Ineffably_Sublime,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:04:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm diagnosed with Depression (with a side of Generalized Anxiety Disorder that wanes as the depression fades), so your treatment goals might be different.  In CBT/DBT, emotions follow thoughts.  So when I feel sad, it's because I'm thinking sad thoughts.  These sad thoughts may not be firing for any reason in particular, and worse, they can be undetectable.  My therapy is all about training myself to notice how I'm thinking and being honest with myself about how those thoughts are making me feel.    The role of the counselor is to help me dredge up recurring thoughts by talking with me about emotional stuff, and to keep a kind of inventory of how I'm doing over time. (There are actually some metrics out there, like the Burns Depression Checklist)  Additionally, they need to be able to identify when I'm blocking and be able to suggest tools that will work for me.  They need to make you ask and answer the questions you need to, because that's really difficult.  I'm not saying your past doesn't matter, but you only really have to deal with your current moment.  If you're not suffering from a chemical imbalance (this is something you see a M.D. Psychiatrist for), then you should be able to recognize that the only way the past can truly hurt you is if you hold onto it too tightly.  What we experience is the here-and-now.  Deal with that by dealing with what you're holding onto.  You may need to delve into your past to uncover what it actually is that you're holding on to, but don't forget that the work you need to do is planted firmly in the now.  I always recommend Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy by David Burns for guidance on how CBT can help you, as well as some insight on what the counselor is trying to do.    Good general reading is Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach, but fair warning that it's got a Buddhist leaning if you're wary of that.  If you're not wary of Buddhism, then I also recommend When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron  EDIT://  More specifically, it looks like the PhD was trying to get on the same page as you without gainsaying you or negating any of the work you did beforehand.  Attachment theory is more of a high-level model of how humans approach relationships and can be used to inform a therapist on how to approach an individual's therapy based on their support network and the individual's relationship to others.  If you don't feel like you click, tell him what you think and either fix it or move on.  You can't help yourself if you don't trust your guide."

Although everyone in the family is afraid to mention her anxiety because we don't want to upset her."
Divorce,3bj7eg,HoleofAnus,2,Tue Jun 30 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"When my ex initially told me she wanted a divorce I was shocked.  I thought we had a very good relationship, and when she blindsided me with the desire for a divorce because she was ""in love"" with another man. I immediately said we needed to go to counseling.  Her response was that she had already decided and that she didn't think it would help.  So I made an appointment for myself with a state certified family therapist (psychologist, referred by my church.)  When my ex realized I was going anyway she decided she wanted to come along.  The first session was pretty much her telling the therapist what a horrible husband I was and that I needed to get psychological help.  The therapist gave us some home work (books to read to help each of us understand how to show love to each other, and et c.)  The session ended badly.  I left angry.  I set up another appointment, and decided that if we were going to go to therapy together that I could not just let her run me down, but to address her behavior that led to her wanting a divorce.  My ex and I were faithful to do the home work and through that process I realized that while I had some things to work on, the significant issues were outside of my control.  The ex had a lot of responsibility for where we were at.  The second session I was able to address some of those issues that I, through the home work, realized she was responsible for (The ex had to be in total control, dismissive of my input into the family, and had started an emotional affair with another man.)  During this session the therapist focused on some of those issues with my ex and she (my ex) completely rejected any input and refused to acknowledge any of her issues.  Over the course of the session my ex continued to get more dismissive with the therapist resulting in my ex flat refusing to even attempt to try what the therapist was suggesting.  At the end of that session, the therapist suggested that if my ex had made her decision, was not willing to work on our relationship, and even try what was suggested that there was no point in paying for more sessions.  At the time not, realizing the importance of separate couples and individual therapy, I set up another appointment with the same therapist to go over what I was feeling and to work on me.  During those sessions, the therapist essentially told me that as hard as I was apparently trying, if my ex's mind was made up then there was really nothing I could do.  Over a few more sessions the therapist helped me to realize that the divorce was not my fault, that marriage is a two way street.  Yes I have some issues that I should work on, but in the grand scheme of our divorce I was not the one responsible.  That I should now focus on how to be a co parenting father and how to accept the changes in my life.  It made the divorce seem less like an dead end and more like a fork in the road.  I still feel feelings of care and I want to be the husband/father I have always been, and it is hard when those are rebuffed.  The therapy gave me a 3rd party opinion and validated my belief that I had done all I could do to salvage my marriage and now that the divorce is final not to stay in that co dependent state of mind.  That in my mind I need to give both my ex and myself the freedom to move on.    TL;DR  Yes, we did get into my family life how both my ex and myself were raised and how that affected our choice, ten years ago, to get married.  Yes, it also helped me to understand why the marriage failed."

I hear a lot of people say this, and at first I thought ""how can all these people ALL be being told that it wasn't their fault?'  I thought maybe therapists were just saying what people wanted to hear, and started doubting that my psychologist was telling me the truth.  But if you think about it, people who know, even if just deep down, that they were a major part of the problem, they don't want ot go to therapy.  They have to be pretty sure that the therapist is going to tell them things that they don't want to hear.  I wanted to go to therapy and had no fear that the therapist would tell me I was a bad person, I just might need to face my own weaknesses and mistakes... but not be told ""you were a bully"", which is what my wife might hear."

NOT that every person who avoids it is a manipulative jackass though. :)  My wife told me while dating that she would 'want more sex and be more relaxed and not grumpy once we get married"".  And then after that, it was ""well we dont have a baby, my clock is ticking, and I am stressed that we dont have a baby"".  Then it was a house.  Then years later, when she had everything she had wanted, she said ""this is just how I am"".  I personally think she knew that any counselor would tear her apart for that.

Divorce,3bkfzx,Altruizzy,2,Tue Jun 30 01:38:50 2015 UTC,"Basically, we got married, her anxiety kicked up significantly to the point of her not fully functioning. I took on a caretaker role, didn't take care of myself and became extremely codependent. 5 years later, she has improved with her anxiety to the point where I don't feel like I'm in survival mode as much, and have started working to undo my codependent behaviors. I've started to wake up to the fact that I have a ton of resentment towards her, we are barely functioning and have realized our actions to this point have been extremely toxic for each other, and we're both in much worse places than we were when we got married. I realize there is a path ahead of us where both of us take responsibility for ourselves and we can thrive in a relationship, but that is years away. I'm not sure this relationship is worth fighting for."
Divorce,3bkfzx,Redhead824,2,Tue Jun 30 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"Set aside the car situation for a moment.  Your marriage was worth something to you or you would never have married her. Onto now, you can only be responsible for your actions. Without worrying about your wife, do YOU want your marriage to succeed? If you do, then stop worrying about whether your wife is fully invested and become fully committed to the (very) long process of getting back to a healthy relationship. You have to start doing the hard things so that when you look back, you can be proud of yourself and have no regrets. Here's the other thing, divorce sucks! And add to that, that you will NOT be able to just go out and start a meaningful relationship with someone new. You already know it will take time to make this marriage what you wanted and dreamed it would be. Any new relationship that you start would have to start with you being in a solid, healthy place. And that's going to take just as much time alone or working with the person you were ready to spend your entire life with just a few years ago. (Probably more time if you get a divorce because a divorce stirs up all kinds of emotional baggage.)"

It's shaping up to be a real shit show. I'm 25, and was devastated when I found out. I cried for 2 days and now that this is unfolding it's even more difficult than I imagined. Just know that I understand how you are feeling. Adult children of divorce are expected to just be ok with it. It's hard, really hard. It may even be harder because we are no longer protected from the harsh reality of a broken marriage and years of resentment and anger. Not to mention, it just sucks from a logistical standpoint! Holidays become even more difficult to arrange and you feel pulled in 2 different directions.  Set boundaries early!"

That it had nothing to do with them and that we'd still have our individual relationships with them and if necessary we'd get together.   Of course my wife then decided I shouldn't go with her to visit our son so you can never really believe what your Ex says WRT to the divorce but I'm being as big a guy as I can.  If you parents are doing it right they should not bring you into any of their personal issues. I made sure that my STBX and myself would not let our anger or issues spill out to the kids. No complaining to them, no discussion the issues, no asking for advice, etc, etc. You have to know that it's nothing personal about you - it's the best thing for you. Kids are not friends to parents or confessors or shoulders to cry on.   You need to make sure you parents know that it's difficult for you and that there's really nothing that you can do to fix or make it easier for them.   Resist any effort by either of your parents to use you as a spy or information gatherer - work on creating the best relationship you can with each of them as new individuals.  Don't be shy visiting them together or separately - you need to let them know that their difficult journey isn't going to be made harder by any bad feeling or favoritism by you.   Take a strong lesson from them"

They have been together 26 years.. And seemed happy as ever.   Of course right after they told me, big ticket items keep popping up on Facebook for sale. It breaks my heart. Some of those items I have/had attachment to as well.   Overall, I was just not ready for this. And have pretty much been in tears since."
Divorce,3biudx,Catcherofsouls,2,Tue Jun 30 00:53:07 2015 UTC,I'm sorry. Your folks didn't seem to consider your feelings. I've seen posts where parents assumed their adult kids didn't have any worries or issues and that's a big mistake.  Of course you can multiply your sadness and confusion by 1000 and that's pretty much how your folks feel. But if they're selling things that you might want I see no trouble with tell them they should ask you first before they sell anything significant to you.   If you don't live at home then it's probably not something they considered.
Divorce,3biudx,Watermelogisty,2,Wed Jul 1 23:21:22 2015 UTC,Yes perfectly normal.   What you want to avoid is letting them drag you into the middle of it.   You're entitled to have a relationship with both of them you shouldn't have to pick sides.  You should also consist talking with a therapist to discuss your feelings.

Your guilt is an emotion that your wife has used to her advantage for years.  You have been emotionally manipulated, if not abused, and she has had you under her FOG: Fear, Obligation, and Guilt.  Now, even though she's not physically present, you can still hear what she'd be saying to you, right?  ""How could you do this to me?""    The question to immediately counter that with is ""Did she ever, even once, stop to think about what she did to me?  No.""  and then move on with your day.  You've lived with an unbalanced person for so long that you have neural pathways in place so you're reacting to her even though she isn't there.  Get rid of her ghost.  She has done incredible damage to you and it is up to you to heal yourself.  So, here's your reality check.  You needed to get away from her.  You owed it to yourself and to your daughter.  Your wife's misery is of her own creation, and you've lived the evidence of what happens when you protect her from consequences of her own behavior.  All it does is tear you apart, not her.

For those who don't get through it, the op basically says hes an unemployed coke head (apologies: ""student""), shockingly, having  difficulties with a self absorbed alcoholic during an open relationship.  Wish you luck brother. The best thing about a shitty ex is it allows you to better appreciate whatever comes next.  Though if you're having trouble getting laid while abusing coke, alcohol, attending swingers clubs and having an open relationship, you really need to get your body in order."

I also don't know if my frequency of usage really counts as ""cokehead"" material. I mean, 1 gram in 8 months doesn't seem like ""cokehead"" material to me, but whatever. Maybe others disagree. Truth is, both during the early period of my relationship with this person and right after my separation, my usage did spike very badly (into the substance abuse territories), but it has dropped once again (and I have been seeking help from a professional therapist in order to make sure it doesn't start back up again). I am also not having any trouble getting laid. I am not sure where you got that idea. During my relationship with my wife, I didn't really want to sleep with other women. It wasn't a lack of ability on my part so much as a lack of desire. I was sort of obsessed with her while I was married to her. Since my separation, sex (with many different people) hasn't been something that is lacking in my life..."

I would not suggest that anyone who has not tried it do so. It is dangerous. As I said, while I have always been functional, and usually use only in small quantities, high degrees of stress can cause full out abuse. What is worse, I don't particularly want to use in light quantities either. I have had to seek professional help in order to try and make sure I stay clean.

If I didn't have texts and other evidence to prove it I think I might not believe it myself.  I didn't lose any of my animals, but I had to put down my two big dogs last year. I can understand some of your pain, but I know it's worse having to leave him behind. Kind of how divorce is worse than death because your ex is still there but you just can't get to them anymore.  I don't have any great advice for you. There are still days when I just want to curl up in a ball or start using heroin just to block it all out. But I don't have weeks like that anymore.

Seven months later, they keep me from staying in my house and encourage me to talk to my neighbours. The main reason for having a dog is the unconditional love.   Makes a difference. Sound like the issue is that you work 13 hour shifts frequently, do you have a neighbor or a friend who would be willing to walk a dog during the middle of your shift?"

I am continually astonished at how many divorcing couples are willing to spend thousands of dollars fighting over the dog.  Not to be callous, but find yourself another pet.  One that fits your new lifestyle.  I recommend a hand raised from egg cockatiel.  Mine is as cuddly as a kitten and twice as smart as the dog.  The trick is finding one that is hand raised.  A hand raised and hand fed from egg bird pretty much thinks it is human.  Cuddly, smart and adaptable to any living situation."

It feels like the person who pledged to have your back forever and always has decided it's not worth it. It sucks.   How do you handle it?  You recognize that it's not about you. It has nothing to do with you. Your ex made his decisions based on what was best for him. He wasn't rejecting you and he wasn't looking to hurt you. He just thought his life would be better if he weren't married to you. Maybe he's right and maybe he's not but it doesn't matter either way. That's his decision based on his perceptions. It's not an objective truth.   To move on, you need to figure out how to stop defining yourself in terms of your ex's perception of you. Recognize that his decisions are subjective and not necessarily reflective of your reality.   And acknowledge as well the reality of your divorce. Don't waste your time longing for things that can't be. Have that tough talk with yourself -- you can't always get what you want. But that's Ok. You may not get what you want or what you were expecting, but you'll get a life. Make it a good one. It sounds like you're already doing that, by going back to school and moving forward.   Keep doing that.  Don't worry about his decisions, his girlfriend, his 4th of July plans. That's got nothing to do with you. Whether this is a real relationship or it's going to crash and burn by Labor Day -- either way, it's not your concern any more. Focus on yourself, not your ex and his decisions.

They have a well deserved reputation for countless errors that harm both the parents paying child support AND the parents collecting the child support.  I have worked on a lot of child support cases over the years and while I know there are good people that work there most of them I would not trust to tie their own shoes correctly.

I did this by direct depositing into ex's account automatically.  At the point of the divorce finalizing we drew up an Affidavit of Direct Payments and filed that with AG office.  They in turn sent her an Affidavit of Direct Payments that she was supposed to fill out with the exact same numbers and have notarized.  She did not follow through on that so I became a deadbeat dad.  I drove her drunk ass to the AG satellite office at 10AM and got it all cleared up, but my credit report still shows that I am a deadbeat dad a year later. Don't rely on your ex to turn anything in on time, walk those forms into the office if you can.  TL;DR yes you should expect that from the AG CSD. everything they do is geared toward the Primary Custodial Parent.  Side note: while I was at the AG office a guy ahead of us had accidentally given his ex $2000 extra. He wanted to be credited back the amount as he was scratching by and really needed the money.  He was told that he would be refunded in 14 years when his daughter turned 18."

Just because you have divorced/are going through a divorce doesn't mean you can't be a parent. It changes how you parent, but you're still their father.   If you're fine with all the custody and divorce stuff, and you're not needing reasons to hand to your lawyer to present in court as to why custody needs to be changed or set a certain way, and you're okay emotionally dealing with stuff like this, go. Be a dad every chance you get.   I'm the 'mean' parent between my ex and I. I am the parent who provides consistency and follow through. I am the strict one that makes them do their chores and mind their manners. My children know they can rely on me. They may not like having to clean their room and they may get a little mad when they get called out on bad manners but they know where firm ground is. With young children this is so important.   My situation is a bit different to yours, I am not being called in to the other parents home to discipline the children. But if I could, I probably would, just to extend the consistency of their home with me, even for a little bit to their home with him."

Divorce,3bau4o,vanpoppy,3,Sun Jun 28 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"/sovexing post is right on mark. Ideally, divorce parents would let go of all resentment and do what is best for the children: Co-parent. This includes disciplining, educating them, religion, medical, etc. By going there, you are sending the kids a message that you are one voice. Remember to always day: ""Your Mom and I (especially when you are on her house)..."" This will send them a message of ""hey, we may be divorve, but we're still raising you together.""   On another note, another 30 min or so with the kids. If you're not overly busy, go for it! If you have to work a simple ""I'm sorry, I'm due at work as y 8 AM... Let me swing by after work to talk to them."" Win-win."
Divorce,3bau4o,fatheroftwoboys,3,Sat Jun 27 15:03:27 2015 UTC,"I think you are going to have to ""forget"" who the request is coming from and focus solely on your kids.

Forget the fact that she is using you or maybe taking a break from her responsibility. You love your kids. You want them to grow up and be productive members of society. Be the father they can ALWAYS count on.  And BTW, thanks for being a good father. Some men leave the marriage and their kids behind."
Divorce,3bau4o,Redhead824,2,Sat Jun 27 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"She's under-performing as a parent on purpose.  Additionally, the kids may have seen that misbehaving means dad's in the house again.  This could be a scheme of theirs, even if it isn't conscious.  It's time to let go.  Your ex chose divorce, which means she doesn't have the benefit of another person to turn to when parenting gets tough.  If you continue to save her, she will never step up.  Your kids deserve a mother who is able to step up, so you need to stop enabling her for the (eventual) benefit of your kids."

I guess the underlying question I have is, when do I stop making up for her mistakes? I've always heard that I can't control how she parents when they are with her. And it seems to me she's getting her cake and eating it too: she gets to do whatever she wants, and when things go bad she gets to call me and I'll come fix things."
Divorce,3bau4o,VisitationAdvice,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:19:27 2015 UTC,"I have a similar situation, where my ex wants to bring the kids home after a visit and have me punish them for not cooperating at his house.  He says he doesn't want to be the bad guy because he spends so little time with them, having every other weekend visitation.  He actually dragged me to the family therapist over this exact issue, so I can share what she told me.  What happens at dad's house is dad's business; what happens at mom's house is mom's business.  She used the visual of dad trying to reach over the fence and trying to run things at my house.  Unless you are worried your ex is going to harm the children if things get out of hand, I would leave her to figure this out on her own:  ""I'm sorry this is frustrating for you.

Divorce,3bagjd,sweatycoldfeet,4,Sat Jun 27 09:19:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, step one, take a deep breath, now take another one.   It is absolutely wrong for your parents to include you in their arguments. From here on forward you need to learn to tell them that you are their child, not their therapist and if they have problems with each other you are not the person they should be talking to about it.   If they get a divorce it is not because you mentioned it. It is not because you said it 3 times. They have problems in their relationship and they are very much aware of those problems, but again, that is not anything that should be put on you.   If you want to help them talk to them about how their fighting and unloading their problems on you hurts you, ask them to see a marriage counselor because you want them to be happy.   That's the best thing you can do for them. Just please remember that if they do divorce it has nothing to do with you but everything to do with how their relationship is not working."

Biodad is going to do what biodad is going to do. You reaching out to him will not change him. I think the most you can reasonably do to support your GF when he is being a jerk is to hold boundaries calmly and respectfully when he oversteps with her so badly that she needs a break from dealing with him directly.

That is your only role here.  I am sure what you are unhappy with is a big part of why they are divorced in the first place.    I would, as a female, advise her to grow a set and also to communicate with him strictly via email if he is being unreasonable over the phone.   He can blame the sun the moon and the stars, it doesn't make it true.  She is letting him run the situation and only she can stop it.  You can't change how people behave but you can change how you react to them and that's what she needs to work on.  Your issue is with your gf, not her ex."

Divorce,3b911x,Feyden,5,Fri Jun 26 23:23:12 2015 UTC,"As soon as I found out, I'll let you know.  I took out a $7,500 loan from the local credit union. Gone. Now I owe that back, I'm $5,000 in the hole with my attorney, $4,000 in the hole with my mom (I can take my time on that one, but still), got a $3,000+ psych eval to pay for all at once somehow ASAP, and the debt keeps growing.  I don't know what to do. I'm actively seeking freelance work. No bites yet. Plus I'm so stressed out, I'm operating at reduced effectiveness anyway. Today I took a two hour lunch at work just to sit and be depressed, until I snapped out of it and went back to hating.  I bring in a six-figure salary from my job. I'm living like a college kid. I have $20 until pay day. That's gotta provide gas and food for the kids. And the ex is breathing down my neck to pay her ""reasonable"" medical expenses as per our agreed order. Bitch, you didn't need a $200 epipen right now - you ain't that allergic to bees."

My 1st knocked me financially pretty good.  Totally sucked.  You crawl out of that pit.    Keep you chins up and push forward."
Divorce,3b911x,Someguywhoneedshelp,5,Sat Jun 27 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'm learning first hand that the ""joke"" about why divorce is so expensive isn't a joke and is true. Because it IS worth it. Almost ate up my $5000 retainer with a few hundred left. If my stbx takes my final offer before trial, I may only owe a few hundred to my attorney to make sure everything is straight. If I go to trial? I'm going to go the nuclear option, and only because it was offered to me first - I'll ask my stbx FIL for help."

It sucks but, at the end of the day it's the right path in my situation."
Divorce,3b6fjh,tellman1257,10,Fri Jun 26 10:19:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I think he makes a really good point about how it was a huge mistake for him in his situation.  He knew he screwed up, and he knew what he needed to do about it, and didn't need someone to explain that to him.    What's also important is that he said that if people need to seek help and guidance, they should.  I know I personally needed to seek counseling to help get through my divorce.  I have been fruitlessly trying to save my marriage and take the high road, and it's emotionally and mentally draining.  Counseling has helped me move past the things I can't control and put in actionable steps to move forward as the best me.  I love Arnold's candor, accountability, responsibility, and honesty in this conversation.  Having watched documentaries from when he was younger, you can really see how much he has grown over his life and the mature perspective he has, especially when talking about struggling with the respect of his children in his life because he knows he screwed up in certain aspects of his life."
Divorce,3b6fjh,solaris79,5,Fri Jun 26 13:01:02 2015 UTC,"I have been fruitlessly trying to save my marriage and take the high road, and it's emotionally and mentally draining. Counseling has helped me move past the things I can't control and put in actionable steps to move forward as the best me.   When I learned my wife cheated on me years before, I felt that all the work I had done to try to save it was fruitless. I learned a little about myself, but what I REALLY learned, is if you are unsatisfied or otherwise don't like the situation, SAY SOMETHING, no matter how it makes you feel or your partner will react.  If my stbx had been honest either before she cheated, or even right after, I may have still ended up divorcing. But it would have been a smoother, easier process. I'm still dealing with 7 years of ""false"" feelings, and memories of things that don't exist anymore, or never should have existed."
Divorce,3b6fjh,Someguywhoneedshelp,6,Fri Jun 26 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"It drives me up the wall when somebody does something wrong, then you confront them about it, and they try to play the victim with you as the huge asshole for bringing it up and making them feel bad. If they would stop doing bad things, they would cease to feel bad. The alternative is doing bad things, while your partner quietly suffers just so the bad one doesn't feel bad. Screw that."
Divorce,3b6fjh,kodack10,2,Fri Jun 26 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"My stbx wanted to tell me why she cheated. I cut her off and told her no. She can rationalize all she wants, but it doesn't make it valid. If you want to cheat, it means there's problems in the marriage. Try to fix them. If you can't, then get out. I'll bet that more often than not, the other party knows there's problems but doesn't want to say anything either. Because then you feel like someone did something wrong, or you ""failed"" at marriage. And that feel sucks too."
Divorce,3b6fjh,Someguywhoneedshelp,2,Fri Jun 26 16:20:48 2015 UTC,You talk a lot of sense and act sensibly as well. That's right.

It was only after my stbx first said she wanted out that I started being honest and not bottle my feelings. But she had already cheated at that point, I just didn't know it."

Divorce,3b6fjh,Watermelogisty,3,Fri Jun 26 22:43:31 2015 UTC,Well said.
Divorce,3b6fjh,soapydansk,5,Fri Jun 26 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"The problem, as I see it, isn't that counseling is a mistake.  The problem is that most of us (including me) only go out and get counseling once the wounds start to get gangrenous.  Sometimes things can be fixed at that point, but most of the time the foot needs to come off."
Divorce,3b7ehz,broke__divorce,6,Fri Jun 26 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"You're probably not going to get the money back, but if you can prove that she spent the money frivolously, you will likely get a bigger piece of the pie when assets are distributed. Whether it's worth fighting for (read: spending more money) is a whole different story...  I believe that you should always separate your finances as soon as the divorce talks start so that this can't happen. Take your half and put it in a bank where the other person doesn't have access and redirect your paycheck as well. It's better to be the ""bad person"" to your soon to be ex than to give them a chance to ruin the family financially and DON'T have a discussion about it beforehand. If they squander their half after that, well, that's their own problem."
Divorce,3b7ehz,anderson_buck,3,Fri Jun 26 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"I know I'll never see a dime of what she spent but now it gives me strong motivation to fight every cent of alimony she felt was ""owed"". I'm just glad there wasn't more money toburn as she would've found a way to do so for sure."
Divorce,3b7ehz,_Mayhem_,3,Fri Jun 26 16:30:03 2015 UTC,That is wrong.  In my jurisdiction most judges would make her account for what she did in the runup to the divorce.
Divorce,3b7ehz,anderson_buck,3,Fri Jun 26 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"Did she spend it on any tangible property? You can fight for half of whatever she spent it on and sell it. Even if for less than original value, it'd be better than nothing."

Divorce,3b7ehz,allwrongs,4,Sun Jun 28 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"Man that sucks!  I'm sorry to hear it.  If she spent 10's of thousands of dollars - she either is throwing some serious parties or she has some assets to show for it.  You get half of those.    If you have any emails/whatever proving you guys were talking about divorce and she did this, your lawyer might have some ways to help things along.   At worst you have to provide a financial disclosure for divorce.  Your attorney might think it's worth asking for receipts for that.  Best thing is to be totally defensive and do not trust anything she has to say from this point forward.  That goes for her interacting with your son as well.  Setup an online calendar, communicate through email.  Make sure there is something to trace on everything you have to interact with her on from this point forward.  If she attempts to pull another ""fast one"" on you again, be ready.  This was your wake up call."
Divorce,3b6o9f,FusRo_Duh,6,Fri Jun 26 12:11:59 2015 UTC,"I think...  Well let me back up here.  Yes, finding out the truth even when you ""already knew it"" hurts.  It's painful, and you're tired, and stressed, and it's just a nother slap in the face that you're ""so replaceable"" after so many years together.  And the truth is, none of what they are doing is really about you.  It's not a reflection of your real-world worth, and it's not a reflection of who you are.  Which knowing this logically isn't the same as knowing it emotionally when it's eating you alive at 3 am in the morning.  I get why my divorce happened, and I understand that in the end it's a good thing for me, but having someone whose opinion and friendship you valued so intimately discard you really fucking hurts.  So the truth is, while you may deserve to be divorced (this is not a judgement about you, just an observation in abstract), you don't deserve to be disrespected or left in legal limbo by your stbx."
Divorce,3b6o9f,TheEarlShibe,2,Fri Jun 26 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"Well said.   It is difficult to get across to some people that 'knowing it logically isn't the same as knowing it emotionally'. People go all cognative empath on you, if at all, and its not the issue."
Divorce,3b6o9f,BlueSkyFading,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"This is wonderful, thank you.  Since my stbx and I had no real major assets, I was  informed that there may be no need to fight him for anything, as I may not win a thing, but if I did push for it, I could walk away with $25k approximately. I had to weigh up if spending money on legal fees and representation was going to be worth it if I didn't win.   I think it is. I want to hit him where it hurts, and that's money. It may be vindictive and counterproductive, but it's principle. Why should he get away continuing to treat me and our daughter like shit, right? Right?"
Divorce,3b6o9f,LeezardQueen,2,Fri Jun 26 22:48:31 2015 UTC,"This isn't worth it. Don't sink to that level because it won't teach him anything. It will only cement what he thinks of you already. You have to deal with him for the long run so unfortunately you have to be the bigger person here.  The money you get vs the money it takes to fight and the stress and effort won't be worth it in the end, and it won't change him."
Divorce,3b6o9f,LeezardQueen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:12:39 2015 UTC,"I know it won't change him, people never really change, but it was such an emotionally and economically abusive marriage. He controlled all finances and most of our fights were about money. He would make me bring him home every cent of change and show him every receipt from any kind of shopping. I was never allowed to buy decent branded pads, or bras when I needed - and I'm not talking fancy ones, either. I'm talking basic horrid support cheapies, whilst he bought new clothes he would never wear or cases of beer every week. The time he wouldn't give me $5 to buy bread and milk for our daughter for her lunch or breakfast that day. When he tried to take my own keycard off me.   I don't care what he thinks of me. It's painfully obvious he doesn't think anything of me - if he did, he wouldn't be the person who he is right now. He wouldn't be saying or doing the things he does.   I'm struggling to find work and have been cleaning peoples homes for $20 here and there just to get along. I study at Uni and TAFE and take on as many odd jobs as i can. He earns $50k per annum. He's got a great work car and everything he could ever want.   Why is it people who are selfish get rewarded in life? I'm paying for our daughters counselling sessions, my own, all the meds, Dr visits everything. He refuses to contribute to any of it, and the child support goes straight to groceries. I could get $22k approx. That's a better life for my daughter and I. That's new towels, new clothes that fit properly, decent made well structured shoes, get my car fixed. We can move. We can get some kind of peace and closure. Getting divorced itself to even file paperwork and do the court thing self represented is going to cost me about $2k.   /u/LeezardQueen, it hurts. The ongoing struggles are getting to me. I am strong, but I fear I may be at the end of my rope soon :("
Divorce,3b6o9f,LeezardQueen,2,Sat Jun 27 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"Trust me I know how this feels. My ex left, took our cash, moved in with a girl, let my son call her mama, and now he's accusing me of child and spousal abuse. It amazing how strong we are though. Every week at least once I think of giving up but then I think of my son and what he would be stuck with.  I fight for him. You will too. You'll surprise yourself.  I stress though you do need to take time to care for yourself. Do your nails or have a bath, have some wine or whatever you do to kick back when your little girl isn't around."

I apply it a lot when thinking of my daughter and fighting for things like this.   Thanks, friend :)"
Divorce,3b6o9f,LaTuFu,3,Sat Jun 27 02:16:08 2015 UTC,Being away from him will help you learn to relax. What I did was just start trying things. I was never too girly but I love doing my nails so I focused on that. Now I'm pretty busy with my own life and friends.  It does get better. It just takes a lot of time and a lot of accepting that you married someone who's kind of an asshole now and probably will be for a long time.

Why hasn't he got it yet? Or his whore? Why do I keep getting hit? I'm a nice person. I give out so much to so many and never expect or want anything in return and yet I keep getting shit on.

When it involves our child though, I figure it's a mutual respect kind of thing.   Accomplish. I don't know. I just want to be heard. I just want him to know what I think about it. We may be in a volatile situation, but I know that even the smallest of things I say niggle at him and get through to him in some way. I just want to know what's going on with our 4 year old. If something were to happen to her, and I didn't know where she was, it would break me. I would go Liam Neeson on that shit. She's all I have."
Divorce,3b7zqx,ChameleonBrane,3,Fri Jun 26 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Relax, breath. There could be worse things in life man, trust me. My ex is putting blocks on medical treatment for my kids right now. It's causing them to fall behind in school and prolonging their developmental delays. Anyway, be glad your ex is willing to hand over the kids so your folks can see to their health. So you need to pick up the kids and drop them at her house because she is picky... what's the big deal? Pick them up at your folks, spend some time with  him at the park, drop him at Moms. Win-win. You get to see your kid."
Divorce,3b7zqx,fatheroftwoboys,2,Fri Jun 26 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"My STBX was working late on a Friday of her weekend, she gave me a call to ask if I could pick our daughter up from daycare for her since she wouldn't get there till late. I jumped on that as fast as I could. An extra hour of playing with my daughter at the park till her mom arrived to get her? Absolutely I'll do it!  OP, I get the frustration that can cause you, especially when you have other plans, but realize that extra time you're getting with your kid may not always be available and you may regret not taking advantage of it when you had the chance. So definitely set boundaries but also keep in mind what positives you may be getting out of what she's asking."
Divorce,3b7zqx,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"No, I get what both of you are saying. More time is good, all other things being equal - that's not the problem.  What drives me bonkers is how my ex keeps inserting me between her negotiations and discussions with my parents. I shouldn't have to remind her that my parents are independent grown adults, and she is one as well - I do not need to be an intermediary between them, yet she keeps wanting me to serve that function. Drives me nutty. Just work out what you need to with them and then come to me if you need anything else."
Divorce,3b7zqx,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would be hesitant to have her cut you off from the communication line between her and your childs care givers. In this case your parents. If this were a traditional daycare would you want to be included on any communication between them and her? Just because you're CC'd on the communications doesn't mean you have to take part in them, it's simply a good way for you to see what's happening and move on. The more you can nurture communication between you and your Ex on what's going on with your child the better things will be for your child.   What happens when more communication is needed with school? Will you not want to be involved with that?  Honestly take a step back and remove the fact that it's your parents out of the situation, also remove the idea that just because you're included means that you have to get involved. Your parents are adults, let them handle it with her without you getting involved just because you're included.   Make sure your frustration and anger in this is there for the right reasons and not because you just don't want to hear from your Ex."
Divorce,3b7zqx,Someguywhoneedshelp,2,Sat Jun 27 12:20:05 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand why your parents have a say in this at all, and I somewhat understand her anxiety. YOU and your ex are the parents, not YOUR parents. Yes, it's nice they take them and can provide for your children, but I'll bet your ex is having a hard time moving on from you because she has to deal with 3 other people in regards to the children instead of just one. If she was anxious when she was married, I'd say it compounds it now that she's divorced.  Thank goodness I'm not anxious around my ex-FIL. And yet my ex is!"

Divorce,3b7ydx,GrandEthos,3,Fri Jun 26 18:26:30 2015 UTC,Fair enough; I guess I hadn't really thought of that.  Guess I'm still too much in the 'hurt feelings' stage and don't want any reminders of this failed marriage around.  Thanks for the perspective.

Now I have twenty years worth of memories that feel cumbersome and painful, accompanied by hundred and hundreds of pictures.  I know this is only the beginning of the process, but that was my life and I want to keep it, so I will not be throwing away the pictures.  I'll probably just gather them up and store them somewhere so my sons can see who their parents were before it all fell apart. You're not in the wrong, necessarily.  You want to separate that part of your life, from the now.  It's strange that she would get pissed, which probably means that it meant something to her and she's upset that you want to purge it from your life.  Women don't think of it the same way as men.  I'm feeling the urge to purge, but I'm thinking of my kids and keeping the memories so that they can know what kind of people their parents were."

So say they have 20,000 in equity, mortgage payments are 1,000 a month for 6 months of mortgage relief OPs wife would owe her share of 3,000.

Divorce,3b75q5,StanBurman,2,Fri Jun 26 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the last reply to your post.  I personally would not trust ANYTHING that her attorney tells you as they are legally required to represent only her best interests, not yours.  I would contact an attorney right away if the amount of money involved means a lot to you as you need someone on your side representing your best interests."
Divorce,3b75q5,Daemon42,2,Fri Jun 26 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"First off - get a lawyer.  Your wife is doing some shady things and having someone there to keep a lookout for you is a very good idea - I mean the guys on this sub are good, but a lawyer is going to know all the little details of your case.  Mortgage relief might just be fancy words to impress you - or it may be the attorney thinking of an idea on how to take care of you - but it's not like that is a common concept.  If this were me, I would start to split fiances RIGHT NOW.  Get a different bank account - throw half the cash in the joint checking into that.  If you do auto deposit, switch it.  I guess your wife is making the assumption that you are keeping the house?  At a minimum, create an invoice for each payment she isn't paying and email that to her.  That actually might not be worth jack, but it's something to reference at the very least.  FYI, I think keeping the house is a crap deal:  The value that you have to give up for the house isn't what it's worth either. Say your house is appraised at 200k. In a divorce you each get 100k. So if there is 100k in cash or assets, she would claim those and you keep the house... or if there is 50k in assets and 50k in debt, you get to keep the debt and house, she takes the 50k in assets and you call it a day... and then if you decide a year from now you want to sell the house 200k does not go into your pocket - there is commissions ~6% of the sale, closing costs, etc. A divorce won't consider that overhead.  I'd outline the current martial bills that you have.  Stuff that can be cancelled (like cable or whatever) I'd drop.  I'd also contact a realtor and put the house on the market - tell her you are not sure you want it - that at least will make her reconsider just abandoning the payments.  Again, lawyer up would be a good idea as the attorney can help fine tune this.  If you do keep the house (sucker) you'll want language in the decree stating that she is going to sign a quit claim at a minimum.  You'll also likely need to refinance the home if both your names is on the mortgage.  Also (and this is a little hostile) you can change the locks and tell her she no longer is allowed access to the home until monthly payments are agreed to.  If she still has stuff in the house, that isn't a bad idea - if she is trying to ""put you on the ropes"" I don't think I'd trust that type of person in a house with my stuff...  Good luck to you!"

Divorce,3b3c98,then_end_is_always_n,7,Thu Jun 25 17:06:02 2015 UTC,"Staying together for the kids is a terrible idea. They are as affected by your relationship with her, and your mood and general happiness, as you are. They are also learning what an adult relationship looks like from what they're seeing at home. They're learning how to treat themselves and their partners.    When your marriage is in trouble, the best first step is counselling. If it doesn't help or if you're already emotionally done and you can't imagine fixing things, then it's time to split up. Personally though, I'd recommend you stay in counselling even if you split. You'd still be co-parenting."
Divorce,3b3c98,anytimeyoulike,2,Thu Jun 25 18:04:37 2015 UTC,"Counseling.  Joint preferably but individually at least.  You need a neutral party to work with out with that can help you understand what you really want.  Plus you have three kids and they are worth the attempt at saving your marriage.  Worst worst case scenario counseling can help you see what mistakes you made in your relationship and help your communication skills for the next one.

We had a child in 2010 and ended our marriage 2 years later.   Since separating, our relationship has drastically improved. Our daughter was our #1 priority from the get go and that caused a common ground for us. We finally were on the same page about something - we adored her and didn't want to fuck her up because of our choices.  We are great co-parents, don't fight - going on 3 years now. We were so angry in our relationship and felt very stuck. Once we moved away from each other and had less expectations from each other, we were able to get along. We hang out as a family a couple times a month and communicate about her frequently. We were incredibly broken as a couple but work very well as co-parents. It IS possible. I obsessed over what our split was going to do to our child, but there is hope if you can both act like adults and put the kids first. I retained our marriage counselor after we split and find therapy is incredibly helpful to process all that goes with divorcing. Good luck."

Divorce,3b3c98,LaTuFu,3,Thu Jun 25 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"Staying together in a house that is high conflict does not benefit anyone.  The vast majority of high conflict marriages turn into high conflict divorces when the parents split.  Either situation is harmful to the child, and neither one is really a better alternative to the other.  A high conflict house is a high conflict house no matter how many adults live there.  What is best for the kids is both parents learning how to communicate in a healthy and respectful manner, and using appropriate conflict resolution techniques to sort through differences.  The children in these environments will be much better off long term, regardless of the marital status of the parents.  However, if the two of you are able to reach this place together, there is a very good chance you'll decide to remain married.  Divorce is an expensive process, emotionally and financially.  You're better off seeking counseling.  Individual counselors for each spouse, and a third counselor for the couple.  Just staying together for the kids doesn't help anyone.  Figuring out what the root causes are for the marital dysfunction and poor communication will be the best choice long term.  Whether or not your marriage survives that process, solving the high conflict problem is how the kids benefit.  They benefit the most if you heal the marriage and the communication, but if that isn't possible, they at least need the two of you to figure out the communication and co-parenting."

As far as assets are concerned they're split 50/50, your wife will be entitled to half of the increased value of your house. As for money in accounts it depends on the state but there's a good chance they'll still be considered marital assets.   Don't pull any money from any shared accounts, this could look very bad in court as an attempt to hide marital assets. At most pull 50% and no more.  Leaving the marital home can be seen as abandonment of the family so you are correct, don't leave.   Remember what is important, your child. Unless you can prove she's a danger to them custody will be 50/50. You need to start documenting when she goes off the rails, and you need to start calling the police when she attempts suicide, should she do so again. Would her sister be willing to vouch for your statements of her attempted suicide?  Getting a therapist for yourself wouldn't be a bad idea and it could look very good in court since you'll be working towards self improvement and bettering the marriage, and your parenting ability.

She dropped the bomb on you. From now on she is never to be trusted under any circumstances.   In the future you should never be alone with her and when you meet to exchange the child it should be done in a public setting. Never talk to her on the phone, emails only. Never say anything negative to her and keep communications with her to a minimum. Don't even look in her direction or make eye contact.   You need to be extremely careful. Most likely she is cheating on you and this is something that has been planned for awhile. Be on the lookout for that possible boyfriend that might want to play white knight and exact revenge on you.   I know some of what I am saying might sound paranoid but if what you are saying is true then she is capable of anything.   I could go on and on about this subject.   Sorry I keep adding things. While there is a protection order going under no circumstances are you to try and contact her unless it is outlined in the order. Nothing that you can say or do is going to stop the anger that she has for you. Most likely she is never going to stop."

Having been in a similar situation, the police don't screw around - but there must have been some type of evidence.  Bruises/etc on your wife.    The would also take pictures of the scene - like ""the shit you threw, etc"".   Obviously get a lawyer.  This isn't the place to try to save cash.  Finding evidence to contradict the negatives you are being accused of would be a very good idea.  The no contact order is likely short term.

If you can have a chaperone whenever you must be near her, like with your kid, that would be best.  Make sure it is someone YOU trust, though, not her.  She can bring her own witness if she needs it.    I hate that women get a pass in situations like that.

Go to therapy by yourself, if you want to continue to invite your STBX to go along with you. However you have to set a time limit on how long you're willing to give your STBX to come around, assuming that time is not 0 now.

When people have affairs they do the same thing, all they see is the negative.  So basically this is your brain trying to deal with the emotional pain that has been caused by your marriage ending by basically rewriting history at this point so that what is ending wasn't really all that great to begin with, which is a whole lot easier to get over than something that was good.    I fear her lawyer will use it somehow to prove abusive behavior on my part.   I'm don't know your history with your STBX, nor what was in the letter asking if reconciliation was a possibility, but I still have a hard time seeing how a letter asking to give reconciliation a chance would be seen as abusive.

Divorce,3b19jd,rhinoBoom,3,Thu Jun 25 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"Stop taking legal advice from your Ex.   Complicating the matter is the fact that we bought a house I intend to stay in, and she moved out. Her argument is since the house is ""ours"", she should have unfettered access to it, but since she entered the lease for her place on her own, I would not have access to her place.   After the divorce the house will either be in just your name or be sold since there's no way you should have both of you on the mortgage/deed if you're divorced. So this won't be an issue for you, she won't own the house. Neither of you should have free access to the others home.   She is proposing that my visits consist of: me picking the kids up and spending a few hours with them and returning them to her house. And then her visits consisting of: her coming to the house and staying there until after the boys are in bed, and I'm back home. This doesn't seem fair, how can I make the argument against this?   It's completely unfair and not likely to actually happen. Get a lawyer, work with them to come up with a fair parenting plan, 2/2/5/5 is great by the way, and send the proposal to her. If she doesn't like it her lawyer can try to screw you, which won't work and will end up costing her more in the end.   Keep logging her actual behavior when it comes to parenting, this will be invaluable to you should things get contentious and goes to court. Right now, what you have with her, is not amicable, she is not looking out for your kids best interests she is looking out for her best interests and whatever she wants in life. Being amicable is great but it doesn't mean bowing down to whatever wishes the other person has, it means compromise.  Honestly the best thing you can do for yourself is to get a lawyer and let them write up the proposals and the arguments against her crazy talk. The more she rejects and refuses proposals the worse things are going to get for her when it comes to actually getting what she thinks she deserves."

Divorce,3b19jd,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:49:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly - ditch the house.  Unless you plan to die there it's silly to keep it.  The kids will adjust to moving and it's very difficult to disabuse your STBX that the marital home is no longer ""hers"".  The value that you have to give up for the house isn't what it's worth either.  Say your house is appraised at 200k.  In a divorce you each get 100k.  So if there is 100k in cash or assets, she would claim those and you keep the house... or if there is 50k in assets and 50k in debt, you get to keep the debt and house, she takes the 50k in assets and you call it a day... and then if you decide a year from now you want to sell the house 200k does not go into your pocket - there is commissions ~6% of the sale, closing costs, etc.  A divorce won't consider that overhead.  Also say a few years from now you meet a new woman (I understand that isn't where you are at now).  You eventually decide to move in together and she happily comes to live at the house you and the 1st wife shared.... NOT.   Until you are actually divorced, you technically can both still live there.  An appeal to her about the kids and helping to adjust may help - like ""ok, they need to understand we are apart, that means this becomes my house you don't come in"".  But she would need to agree to it.  Details on how she is paying for the ""new place"" and who is actually paying for the current one might help - like if you can totally afford the mortgage/etc solo and she can't, it would give you more power.    Once you file you should be able to throw your paychecks into your own account.  She handles bills (like for this new place) that you don't care about.  You could also establish her moving out is yielding the place to you and change the locks... but I'd talk to an attorney about it before doing that honestly.  tl;dr Engage an attorney to file for you now.  There will be a waiting period where you establish that she isn't carrying another child of yours and where you hash out these details.  But the attorney will help give you guidance.  You should also google ""parenting time plan <your state>"" and learn that.  That is going to be a default of what happens."

Now, we dated for longer than the amount of time it took me to meet, get engaged, marry, and divorce my ex, so we were very, very careful, but clearly strong feelings emerged. All I can say is communicate, even when it makes you look crazy.  I can't count the number of times I had to sit her down and say ""Okay, look.. this is baggage, it's a landmine that's totally not your fault, and I'm sorry you have to deal with it, but when $littletinyinsignificantthing happens, my reaction is $totallyinappropriatereaction.  I'm working on it, but I want you to understand what's going on in my head...""

Divorce,3aznbc,fsr87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the kind of insight and information I was interested in hearing. Thank you for the response.   I really think you nailed it. Honestly, I don't know what I'm ready for. I've been trying to take it one step at a time. Ease my way into it. As I said, it's not just a new person. Almost the whole dating experience is new.  Its comforting to know I'm not totally off my rocker, and we are definitely going slowly, but having dated a few women now, all successful good dates with attractive women 27-35, I feel comfortable saying that there IS a connection of some kind. Not getting married tomorrow. Not moving in together. We haven't picked monogrammed towels for the powder room... but this is different so far."

Divorce,3aznbc,LaTuFu,6,Thu Jun 25 06:10:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is extremely common to have (IMO) codependency issues. It's strange and scary being alone. You also seem to have some self-worth issues. ""Way better than I thought... she knows my history and isn't freaked by it.""  Look man. You have a great job, you love your kids and have an amicable divorce. You are a catch in the eyes of all women, 30 and over. They are tired of dealing with boys who are scared of commitment and responsibility. You represent stability and security. Know your value and know you don't NEED (just) another woman in your life.  Seek quality in your next relationship. Demand it. And take your time to commit. There is NO rush."
Divorce,3aznbc,livingthedreamnow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It actually is different hearing this from someone who is aware of your situation compared to friends/family. I agree with you on the self worth issues. I wasn't always like that, used to be so confident and alive, but that seems like a lifetime ago. It's odd though because I still remember what it looks like on the outside, so I can play the part well, yet feel totally insecure and exposed at the same time.   Slow and steady. Don't go overboard. More slow and steady. Got it."
Divorce,3aznbc,toasterchild,7,Wed Jun 24 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is pretty normal to feel like you won the lottery with it.  But like /u/zandyman said, you really aren't going to know for sure if you're ready until you actually try.  Take your time, don't be in a rush to do anything and date to establish trust.  The biggest change to make this time around?  Don't ignore your instincts.  If you start to see red flags waving, pay attention to them!"

Divorce,3aznbc,Daemon42,3,Wed Jun 24 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yes.   When we separated, I set my mind to not get serious and just have fun. I wanted very much to be out there enjoying life, but I was very concerned that I would meet someone and commit to much too fast. I told myself that I had to date 20 different women, before I would allow myself to get into an official relationship. Even with this in my mind, I did what I feared. The third woman I asked out, was one of the sweetest people I've ever met. From the first date she was severely smitten with me, and I was extremely fond of her. I told her I didn't want titles,, I told her I wanted to move slowly,, but the fact is that I treated her like a girlfriend immediately. I saw her multiple times a week, she introduced me to her family, I took her on romantic getaways,, everything I shouldn't have done, when trying to move slowly. It got very intense, very quickly. I loved being desired by her, and I thought I cared for her enough that it would develop into a deeper connection on my end, and for the time being, I was happy.  After about 3 months of dating, we were driving back from a weekend away, and I glanced over at her in the passenger seat. Suddenly something was different. When I looked at her I had a sudden wave of dread wash over me, and a crushing feeling of ""what the hell am I doing"" came over me. The affectionate feelings I had for her vaporized, and were replaced with panic,, immediately. It was clear in that moment, that I wasn't in love with this woman, and I'd never be. It was like completely out of the blue, I realized I was lying to myself, and setting someone up to be hurt. I had affection for her, but nothing on par with what she was expressing for me. I gave it a few days and spoke to my therapist about it,, just to make sure it wasn't some knee jerk reaction of mine,, but within the week of our return, I broke it off with her. It was very tough, because she was absolutely crushed, and I knew it was my fault for allowing things to progress too quickly. It was an absolutely horrible feeling.   I marched onward toward the arbitrary 20 first dates number in my head, taking the lessons learned from earlier with me. I was much better about keeping things light. Six months after my divorce was finalized, and shortly after the 20 first dates goal had been passed I met the woman I'm with today, and will hopefully be with forever. Having met her after all of the other experiences, I immediately recognized in her the qualities that I wanted, and I recognized how special she was. I don't think I was capable of that kind of clarity, when I initially started dating.  My advice is go very slowly. Get your divorce handled, and try to keep this particular relationship as light as possible. Once you get past the divorce, if the relationship is still good for both of you, then start ramping it up at that point."
Divorce,3aznbc,Daemon42,2,Wed Jun 24 21:07:15 2015 UTC,"Well it definitely sounds like the theme here is ""take it easy, don't rush, have fun, but be cautious"". Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I'll definitely try to keep it in mind."
Divorce,3aznbc,Daemon42,3,Wed Jun 24 21:43:30 2015 UTC,Feeling attached to someone you like and are dating is normal and being cautious is good.  Just make sure your attachment doesn't blind you to red flags and you are good. Date.  Have fun.  Get attached.  Be ready to break up if and when she turns out to actually be nuts.
Divorce,3aznbc,Daemon42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:57:23 2015 UTC,Thank you. That helps. I definitely see what you mean about not being blinded to red flags. Being desired/wanted is a drug I haven't felt in so many years. It's hard to turn away from it.
Divorce,3aznbc,king-schultz,2,Thu Jun 25 14:38:44 2015 UTC,"I see nothing wrong with it,  just don't go all nuts and get married again in 6 months because she seems so much better than the ex.  The ex probably did this to you all those years ago too. Enjoy it."
Divorce,3aznbc,proROKexpat,2,Thu Jun 25 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"My timelines aren't exactly the same as yours but the situation of dating around (doing better than I ever hoped) and then meeting an ""awesome"" woman match yours.  I thought I was being careful, I think it's easy to say that.  Here is what happens (from my experience).  You slowly start allowing things to slide as with anything that becomes the norm.  If you see each other every day it only makes the situation happen faster.   As you hurdle past the months the precautions you think of as ""going slow"" are going to seem silly - you know this woman is awesome, now reason to worry about this now I mean we know each other...  When you are talking about moving slow, I would ratchet things down to a casual dating situation - one where you don't see each other every day.  This is VERY slow, but also so much safer.  You have emotional scars that maybe you don't even realize are there - this woman is ""fantastic"" because she sees those and doesn't flinch... but likely she either has scars too and accepts yours because she sees potential with you (and by potential she thinks she can mold you) or that matches her level of issues and she just doesn't disclose them.  Picture this.  You have been single for 5 years, extrapolate out the brief dating experience you had and then you meet this gal.  Is she as impressive?   The issues you bring to the table are no longer there - so essentially you have your life all in order and she isn't accepting anything other than you being an awesome guy.    I think that exercise is a long shot, but I'm trying to verbalize what to look out for (having the same blinders on that I believe I did).    Think of a siren luring you to the rocks.  All the sailors out there warn you to not listen, but your different you think.  You can detect if someone is trying to fool you...   Or maybe you did happen to find the dream girl for you and she is awesome and perfectly willing to patiently wait for you to get back up to her emotional level as you heal from such a recent divorce - in which case I'll call you a lucky bastard and be done :)"
Divorce,3b2z1b,I_like_the_word_MUFF,9,Thu Jun 25 15:27:57 2015 UTC,"Good luck with being butthurt because people that have seen dozens and dozens of marriages destroyed because of ""POLY"" pointed that out.    EDIT:  One of the things I love about this sub is that it is somewhat judgmental when people do stupid stuff.  Most of us do mourn our marriages and the things that cannot be and take askance on people that do things that are destructive to marriages.  We also tend to come down on people that choose involuntary poly for their spouses."
Divorce,3b2z1b,Catcherofsouls,-4,Thu Jun 25 15:37:04 2015 UTC,like the rest of the monogamous marriages that ended in divorce NOT BECAUSE OF POLY???  so you are just scapegoating... because of what?? you're overwhelming numbers and statistics that POLY has destroyed the marriage fabric of this world and thus poly people should be shunned??    lol... good luck with that
Divorce,3b2z1b,Catcherofsouls,5,Thu Jun 25 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"No one shunned you.  The commentators merely pointed out that your lifestyle was not conducive to maintaining a marriage.  You just did not want to hear it,  There's a difference."
Divorce,3b2z1b,Catcherofsouls,-3,Thu Jun 25 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"but the point I believe was that my marriage, poly or not, was unhealthy for me.... my husband was unhealthy for me...      that was a long post and all people wanted to point out was the poly aspect.... well guess what... I don't want to go back to that marriage... now out, looking back.... NEVER AGAIN...    but you know.... log, eye, splinter... etc..etc"
Divorce,3b2z1b,Slowlyloosinghope,5,Thu Jun 25 15:43:03 2015 UTC,Think what you like.  I am sorry you did not find all the happiness and affirmation you so desperately sought in that post.  But then happiness is not guaranteed in this life.
Divorce,3b2z1b,zandyman,-3,Thu Jun 25 15:45:21 2015 UTC,I just didn't think I'd get dragged around because of being poly.. and yes.. you are right.. but living positive is guaranteed.. just got to live it...
Divorce,3b2z1b,el-burrito-incognito,7,Thu Jun 25 15:46:43 2015 UTC,"I went back and read the comments on your original post. There are 2 parent comments that focused entirely on the poly as a negative. 2, with a couple of follow up comments. There are 3 that are pretty much flat out supportive, and 1 giving honest good advice for anyone going through a divorce.  You ask us to not judge you because of your lifestyle choice, fine I get that, I honestly had no idea how to respond to your post because it was outside my realm of understanding relationships, so I didn't. Stop judging the entirety of the community by the commentary of a couple. Speaking of which those couple of people are speaking from their hearts and beliefs as well, they have life experiences and feelings that play a part in how they feel. Lets work on the empathy you're demanding of us and think about why they might have a harsh reaction to a poly lifestyle? Perhaps they've been cheated on? Perhaps they've seen marriages destroyed because one spouse decided they were poly now and the other wasn't? Perhaps their advice might be worth listening to so that you can better understand what may very well be part of the reason your marriage failed.   This is an amazing community, not because it will support you in absolutely anything you do or say, but because we are welcome to support each other with hard facts as well. If I made a post today that said I'd fallen in love with a beautiful amazing woman and decided to move across the country with her and abandon my daughter you can bet that a large majority of commenters would be asking me if I'd lost my mind and honestly telling me to grow up and figure out my priorities.   And they'd be absolutely right to do so.   My marriage ended because my wife decided sleeping with my friend was the way to save the marriage, is that Poly? Not from my perspective but she apparently decided sleeping with both me and him was cool and a great way to be married which is basically a one sided poly relationship. So yes, for many there's a visceral reaction when it comes to multiple sexual partners in the realm of marriage.    happy to overcome in small victories   Live with General and Social Anxiety while your wife continually is gone having sex with the guy you thought was your friend while you're at home alone with your infant daughter while having to deal with weekly panic attacks and then tell me that I shouldn't celebrate the small victories of working past that.   Just take a step back and realize everyone is human and not perfect just like you want everyone to realize that about you. We've all suffered, we're all in pain, we all deserve support, and we all deserve a wake up call when something we're saying doesn't fit with how a relationship between two people (marriage) works.   I honestly hope you continue to find happiness in your future."
Divorce,3b2z1b,livingthedreamnow,3,Thu Jun 25 16:01:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think most people meant to be unhelpful... I know I read your post and I felt bad for you, a relationship ending regardless of the nature of it is crippling, but the nature of your relationship made it very challenging for me to relate or even know what to say.   I don't think any of us question that you're hurting, but we all know that empty platitudes of ""It'll get better"" or ""I'm sure you're going to be okay"" don't really help, so I don't think many people offered them, especially since you said you were okay.    Honestly, when I read that, it sounded like you were okay with the divorce, moving on well, and actually in a healthy place.  You looked like you were seeking help with some codependency issues, which while peripheral to the issues many of us have here, we're not really qualified to offer help on.   You said ""or me... I'm actually fucking happy. I miss it all, like a limb has been taken from me and I'm still feeling the itches. Overall, my STBX was bad for me. I carried him. I changed for him."" so if we didn't get that you're devistated and heartbroken you'll have to forgive us...   It's not that I didn't want to help, it's more that I didn't really know what to say.  Poly didn't really enter into it...  you seem like you're scattered, but moving towards a goal, and... well... you know you're better off, you know you'll be okay one day, and you're surviving as a whole person pretty well.  That's what this sub is for."
Divorce,3b2z1b,GrandEthos,2,Thu Jun 25 15:47:19 2015 UTC,I'm going through a poly divorce myself and I understand how you're feeling. It's hard to share this experience with people without inviting some harsh judgment.   I'm at the point where I agree with poly as a concept but I do feel like it contributed to my divorce. It's much easier to give up on a relationship that is in trouble when you have another partner to take you in. At least that's how my STBX husband seems to see it. Some people take advantage of the concept.
Divorce,3b2z1b,GrandEthos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for understanding and writing..   I think you are right on the bottom half... it is easier.  However, I think in my husband's case, despite all the poly politics, he really wanted something else in life and so did I... When I started self-actualizing after my near death experience, I started heading in a new direction and I think he realized he wanted more as well.  Mainly, he wanted kids and I am mostly infertile.  I wish he would have just sat me down and explained this to me.. yes there would have been tears and yes, there would have been parts of this that were issues I had caused in all this... However, at least we may have parted friends.  Now I'm stuck feeling happy in my new life, happy for him in his, but teetering between WTF and sadness in response to his actions.  His anger level is so amped up, his actions in selling our stuff and screwing me, and the dog/cat situation have all layered on top of this ...       All I wanted for the both of us is just to move on, easy..... all he wants now is to drag me through his anger, but thankfully I've cut all the emotional blackmail ties he could use on me.  It was at a great financial loss, but in my heart/soul/mind.. I'm feeling on the road to peace...   be loved <3"
Divorce,3b2z1b,abloodyminge,3,Mon Jun 29 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that you felt attacked.   Surely you can understand why some people have a weird reaction to your situation. As an analogy, imagine this place is a burn victim support group filled with people who got burned in house fires. You attend the meeting upset that you have burns, but then your story begins with the fact that you were attempting to eat fire. Everyone looking around the room at each other making WTF faces, or asking you what you were thinking, shouldn't be unexpected.  That said, your choices about how to conducted your marriage, has no bearing on the pain of divorce. Your original post seemed very clear that you are happy, so you're not going to get a lot of people trying to make you feel better, if you're saying you're happy.   You got one messed up story,, for sure. I sincerely hope that you are able to navigate through the mess, in the best way possible, and that you heal and grow from this experience. Take stock, and learn the lessons that will come from this, including, but not limited to the role that the poly lifestyle played in the direction your marriage took. I also hope that you don't write off the sub, you have a long stretch of road ahead of you, and you may be able to find some comfort and good advice here as you move through it.  And for the record,,, people can be WAY more obnoxious than this bunch :-)"
Divorce,3b0qnz,jules0072,2,Thu Jun 25 01:13:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on what custody ends up being. My STBX and I are doing 50/50 daycare cost but we also share 50/50 custody so that tends to be more balanced. Child support payment is part of the parental agreement.   Honestly it comes down to custody, if you have primary custody then you have a lot more leverage in deciding daycare. If it's 50/50 each of you can choose your own daycare options when it's your time with your child. You cannot control where he takes your child to daycare anymore than he'll be able to control where you take your child.   Child support will be required if he makes substantially more than you do. Even at 50/50 custody.   Basically don't take legal advice from your Ex, listen to your attorneys, they know what they're doing. At this point if you can go non-contact with your STBX it wouldn't be a bad idea."
Divorce,3b0qnz,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:19:42 2015 UTC,Thank you that totally makes sense!   And yeah on the no contact.

STBX doesn't know this is coming though. I'm going to ask him to move out when he comes home on Friday.   Best if luck to you and thanks again.
Divorce,3b0qnz,balister13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with not listening to what your husband is saying. He is talking out of his ass, to be frank. It's just going to stress you out more listening to him.   I'm in a different state, and just starting the process myself but I feel like most judges would want to get you all to agree on one child care, not you taking your kid one place when you have her and him taking the kid to another when he does. And besides, sounds like you'll have a case for full legal custody, which would mean you would make these decisions. I'm no expert though by any means."
Divorce,3b0qnz,Catcherofsouls,2,Thu Jun 25 01:29:04 2015 UTC,Talk with your attorney about how to establish that negotiation.  In my state childcare expenses can be entered into the support calculation as part of establishing a child support number.    Your ex is kidding himself if he thinks he can get away with what he's talking about doing.  Really though this strikes me as him attempting to exercise control over you.

Divorce,3ay7jd,crazyex,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:58:51 2015 UTC,I was married to a man who had no noticeable refractory period during sex. The idea of a guy not being able to get/stay hard was intriguing.   Reddit (Skype) has taught me that not all guys can keep on going indefinitely or even more than once. It truly has been enlightening.

Divorce,3ay7jd,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:32:01 2015 UTC,"If what you claim is true, I'd probably ban you for posting that, since I am a redpiller myself.  I am also a loving, caring father of three children and in a relationship with a ""redpill""mother of her own 3 (grown) children. I'm in my forties and one of my favorite things to do in real life is to help other people; male or female. I don't believe in coercive sex, pick up artistry, or some other supposed tenets of RP. It is possible, despite the narrow world view of internet progressives and social justice warriors, to hold red pill beliefs without harboring hate towards any gender, without participating in creepy pickup culture, and without treating anyone as subhuman because they are women."
Divorce,3ay7jd,crazyex,2,Wed Jun 24 23:09:02 2015 UTC,At some point you just have to acknowledge you took the blue pill instead.
Divorce,3ay7jd,LaTuFu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"I definitely took it, and it ruined my life (aside from my kids). I'm much happier in my red pill world now.  Most boys are raised in a blue pill world; by blue pill mothers and no father present. When reality beats them down again and again and they are shamed and ridiculed for trying to treat women like they have been taught women like to be treated they may choose to spit out the blue pill as well."

Divorce,3ay7jd,albertnacht,2,Thu Jun 25 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"I think it goes without saying that you are about as non-stereotypical of a redpiller as it gets.  In fact, if you represent more of what TRP is meant to be, I'd say that shows how ignorant and misguided the vast majority of the mouthbreathers following that philosophy really are.  Do I support TRP?  No, not the way it ""leaks out"" into the rest of reddit.  Do I agree with some of the statements they make about feminism and men's rights in the western world today?  Yes, there are some aspects that are pretty on point.  But when the messengers leave the castle, they read from a much crazier script.  Those are the guys we wind up dealing with in here, more often than not.  I almost forgot you were a RP, that's how different you are from a lot of the morons we tend to get in here.  TRP may not be inherently abusive, but most of the guys I've run into who are trying to espouse it are promoting abusive tactics and principles.  Especially the PUA rejects who think it is only about getting laid."
Divorce,3ay7jd,albertnacht,3,Thu Jun 25 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"One of the dangers of empowering movements is the tendency for the dispossessed seeking empowerment to find the exhilaration a little too exciting, and then go overboard with zealousness seeking their next ""fix"". TRP is unique for a variety of reasons; mainly that in my opinion the majority of new adherents are seeking answers for the very core of their masculinity."
Divorce,3ay7jd,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Thu Jun 25 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree with you there.  I also wonder how much of it is ""I've been an anti-social loser and awkward teenager, but I'd rather blame women and society rather than myself for the rejection I've faced in the dating world.""  Much like some guys tend to blame ""the marriage institution"" for their problems rather than face the fact that they were at least partially responsible for their bad marriages."
Divorce,3ay7jd,Slowlyloosinghope,3,Thu Jun 25 14:38:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, and there is definitely a problem with the current divorce process. The proper way to address this is not, however, to deluge a support message board with propaganda and vitriol. I'm talking to you billie."

Divorce,3ay7jd,abloodyminge,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"Well, therein lies part of the RP belief. Approaching women at any age like ""society"" teaches you to will most often lead to rejection no matter how un-awkward or social a guy is. The whole dating/relationship model most guys are taught is a bald faced lie. Who else should someone led down the wrong road be angry at?  Anticipating a ""himself"" answer, I will freely admit their is a great deal of self blame any RP guy will take on himself. However, using the narrative I abhor, it's problematic to the point of victim blaming that young men are expected to shoulder all the blame for being lied to. Even your language describing some RP users: ""anti-social loser"" and ""awkward teenager"" is language that would not be tolerated if it were directed at any other group of people. Each of TRP people are human beings; most of whom tried everything in their power to be honest, decent, ""nice"", and follow the path taught them for romantic and relationship success. It is extremely disheartening to earnestly put yourself out there again and again and fail."
Divorce,3ay7jd,Slowlyloosinghope,5,Thu Jun 25 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying, and you're right, that kind of language would be troublesome if it was directed towards other groups.  So noted.  Do I get a free pass if I considered myself a socially awkward loser as a teenager? :D  I do agree, men who try to be the nice guy and treat women nicely and all that are generally walked on by most females.  I was one of those guys, I was friendzoned before that was ever a term.  Not sure what I did specifically that began to change that.  I know that I stopped investing in relationships that were decidely one sided.  I never engaged in any of the PUA mindgames and negativity harvesting that they advocate.  ""This is me, this is who I am, this is what I'm looking for, I don't apologize for not compromising on that."" (Unfortunately I had to go through a divorce to get to that place, but hey, I digress...)  The guys I have a hard time with though are not the ones who try again and again and fail.  At least they are putting themselves out there and making an effort.  Its the ones that make no effort to do anything, are introverted to the point of shut-in, look and talk as awkward as a foreign tourist who knows nothing of the culture, and want to rage on guys who are more balanced in their lives and women in general.  They're difficult to listen to.  Dude, you came to a bar on a Friday night, you couldn't be bothered to shower, you're wearing a tuxedo T-shirt and you make awkward, sarcastic comments towards any female that makes the mistake of coming within earshot.  Help me understand how this is their fault you're not having success?"
Divorce,3ayf1y,Dogdaze89,5,Wed Jun 24 14:34:23 2015 UTC,"You really do need a lawyer, or at a minimum, a mediator.  You're going to have to sell the house, more than likely, if you can't afford to qualify for a loan on your own.  Legally, she can't just stop paying her share of the bills.  She's still obligated to contribute towards the mortgage until you two decide what to do with the house.  Unless there are other factors at work, the two of you essentially divide the net assets (after debts are paid off) down the middle.    If you can't qualify to get a new mortgage in your name, you need to talk to her about how to manage the bills until the house sells.  If she refuses to cooperate and contribute, have your lawyer file to have temp support until the divorce can be settled.  You say you can't afford a lawyer, I say you can't afford not to have a lawyer.  One of the biggest misconceptions people have about lawyers is the expense.  Yes, you can expect to pay $1,000-$3,000 for an attorney to get the divorce done, if it is an amicable divorce.  But, the two of you own property together,  You could easily lose $3,000 or even more trying to do this without an attorney."
Divorce,3ayf1y,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"Our debts are already more or less, divided. I have my credit card debt, ~1500. She has her credit card debt. I have my student loans and she has her car. I've told her i wont fight over anything in the house that she wants, and she says that she isnt out to ""rob"" me. if she doesn't assist with the mortgage, what options do i have? Or do i need to get a lawyer before this happens. I have no idea how i would afford a lawyer within the next month. My goal is to end this with as much civility as possible. Do we get a single lawyer and work it out jointly or do we each get a lawyer? From what i'm reading, our divorce would likely be uncontested as we do not have any children?"
Divorce,3ayf1y,LaTuFu,3,Wed Jun 24 15:17:25 2015 UTC,"If she wants to keep things civil, and both of you want to put it behind you, then appeal to her sense of reason.  Don't make it a battle, just have a very adult conversation about it.  The bottom line is, if you can't afford the house alone, then the possibility of foreclosure is certainly there.  But before that happens, the bank will try to collect from both of you.  Both of you will have your credit damaged by any late payments or missed payments.  She needs to realize that just walking away from her responsibilities is not an option here.  You're both still in this together until the house sells, whether she likes it or not.  Contact your lender and let them know what is going on, ask them what options you have available, including loan assumption, restructuring, refinance, etc.  Mortgage lenders are much more willing to work with you before things get bad than they are when you wait until you're 6 months behind and foreclosure is staring you in the face.  Your STBX has a vested interest in resolving this situation amicably, if she wants her credit to survive this episode.  You can't get a single lawyer to represent both of you, but you can seek out a mediator to work with both of you.  Yes, your divorce is very likely going to be uncontested."

She's still obligated to contribute towards the mortgage until you two decide what to do with the house.   Huh? I'm responsible for half the mortgage while my STBX decides whether he wants to sell or not? He says he wants to stay in it and sell it next spring, even though there's no possible way he's going to swing refinancing on his own when it's due this fall. Wait, am I also supposed to be on the hook for that as well?.  Jaysus, divorce is expensive. Never again. I think I'm going to tattoo that on my freaking forehead."
Divorce,3ayf1y,LaTuFu,6,Wed Jun 24 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"If your name is still on the mortgage, yes, you are still obligated to pay for it.  Practically speaking, many couples in this situation work out some sort of agreement where the one spouse remaining in the house pays the mortgage.  Whether or not the other spouse contributes towards that obligation depends on circumstances.    Legally, the risk is if the spouse living in the house suddenly decides to stop paying the mortgage for any reason (unemployment, change of attitude towards the STBX, etc) the bank can still come knocking on your door and ask you to pay the mortgage payments."

Divorce,3ayf1y,rasconjon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:00:21 2015 UTC,we paid 197k for the home in July of 2013. We currently owe 189k with an interest rate of 3.25%. My fear is that the house will take too long to sell and i'll be forced to forclose on it. Should the selling of the house come before the divorce or does it matter?
Divorce,3ayf1y,albertnacht,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to... I just sold mine, and we closed the day after we filed... We split the proceeds, it was drawn into our agreement but it was just done amicably. I was paying the entire mortgage when I moved out(5 months before selling), and continued to until it was sold because that's how we had done bills previously. I was living at my moms at that point."
Divorce,3ayf1y,Altruizzy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"You will need to sell the house if neither spouse can afford the mortgage on their own. The house may be underwater, but since it sounds like it was bought together, any equity or debt will be split.  It will be tight one way or the other.   Regulator fees to sell the house will be 6% to 7% in a lot of the states, there may be a loss on the house. Part of your estate settlement needs to and will define if the house is being sold, and who lives in it and for how long, etc.You may want to talk an attorney about this, both of you are responsible for paying the mortgage until it sells, but if one of you continues to live in the house that is being sold, the other spouse may be owed some money."
Divorce,3ayf1y,frumbiggie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:58:27 2015 UTC,Go find a mediator. Availability might vary depending on what state you are in. If you can agree to all the terms without a lawsuit you will be much better off. Do you make the same amount of money? Try to split everything 50/50 is my advice.
Divorce,3ayf1y,anderson_buck,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"Consider selling the house and moving into a place that is more  suited to your budget.  Either that or look into finding a better-paying position so you can afford to keep it.  Also, take a hard look at your monthly expenses and trim whatever you can.  This question might be better suited for a cross-post to /r/personalfinance."
Divorce,3ayf1y,laughterandtears,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"Since she's already moved out and left you to pay for everything, you need to file for divorce immediately and also file a motion to have her pay temporary support to help cover expenses.  The downside of doing this is that it will probably make her less inclined to play nice and get it done. The upside is that she might agree to sign the paperwork to put the house up for sale if she's going to have to pay for a place that she isn't living in.    Go talk to realtors and put everything in motion to sell the house since that's the likely outcome anyway."
Divorce,3ayf1y,abloodyminge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:29:15 2015 UTC,"Well, if you have 198 left, then you aren't going in the hole every month at least.   You will likely need to sell it and split the equity since this reads like you will not be able to refinance. This will be spelled out in the divorce decree.  In the meantime, make sure you pay the mortgage so you don't wreck your credit. And find ways to cut back your expenses until it is sold.   She is responsible for the debt as well. Remind her that if she cannot help pay for it until it is sold, her credit gets a  hit too if you can't make a payment.  Also, do not panic. No, you don't know how long it will take to sell. It could sell really fast. Your mortgage company has a list of agencies that can assist if you have problems making your mortgage payments. I was given that list at closing by my mortgage agent. See if you can get that in case you need it. And start getting it ready for listing. Contact a seller agent now.  And, I repeat what others say, you cannot afford to not get an attorney. If it is amicable, then get one that can mediate. Otherwise, get your own."
Divorce,3ayd1d,cornelius_t,2,Wed Jun 24 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"About all a journal is going to do for you in court is provide more stability to your testimony.  You might be asked about events that happened a long time ago - if you have a journal and reference it you are stating that you wrote the entries near the time it happened and so it's more accurate (assuming you aren't lying).    Also yes, if you do shady things and write them down it could be used against you.    Having said that, why not try counseling first?  Divorce is a messy process at best.  It sucks.  I'm no lawyer, but demonstration that you put in effort to fix the marriage looks better than a passive style ""today he pissed me off by doing... and all I'm doing in response is documenting that"".  If you think the marriage really is a lost cause, go find a family law attorney and do a consult.  If you go in with a good summary of your assets and family dynamic a decent attorney could outline what you should expect in about an hour."
Divorce,3ayd1d,Daemon42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"Question:   Should I keep a written record of any of this?     Keeping a journal of events is usually a good idea.     Would it be usable in a court of law?     Debatable.  Is this just financial or are there kids involved?     Or could it be used against me?    Not if you have a good attorney.    If it is a good idea, what kinds of things should I write down?    An entire history (beginning with how we met).     Does it matter?   The court won't be interested in anything but the legal aspects of a divorce.  How you met doesn't really matter.     Or just a summary of key events/incidents?    I would go with the summary.    What are you hoping to gain with this?"
Divorce,3ayd1d,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"What I'm hoping to gain is to have some record of events. Just that; nothing more.

Divorce,3ayd1d,anderson_buck,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:49:12 2015 UTC,"YES! My journal was the most important thing in my divorce even though I never actually had to use it. I had a record of all the comings and goings of my ex (she and I shared the house for 6 months after filing) and when I cross referenced everything with her spending habits since she had to give me her financials as discovery, it was easy to paint a picture of a woman enjoying her new-found freedom at the bars multiple nights a week while I was home with the kids.  Thankfully, the judge cut off her nonsense at the pass very early at a temp hearing and I never had to use it because it would have enraged her even more, but I wouldn't have hesitated since she was trying to say I wasn't an involved parent.  My entries were simply:  ""STBX left at 6pm, I fixed kids a dinner of chicken & veggies.  Kids and I did homework from 7-8, then watched TV until 9:30 bedtime.  STBX returned home at 1am and slept on the couch."" If ex said anything of substance, it went in the journal.   Just remember, if STBX knows you have the journal, they can ask for it as part of discovery so make sure the entries are fair. If everything in there makes you out to be a saint and STBX the devil, the judge may find it less trustworthy at trial."

Divorce,3ayd1d,allen_bracket,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It will help you remember things that happened along the way, and more importantly, you can look back and see how you've grown from this experience.  It's easy to forget how much pain you are in the beginning, or what someone is doing to you during that time.  It can help paint a more realistic picture of what went on."

During the court, her lawyer said that I gave up days with my kids with my kids that I never did.  Given only a moment to think about it, I had to look at my lawyer and say this isn't true but I have no way to argue different.  I just don't have any information on the dates she is mentioning.  I wish I'd have had it then.  Although it made no difference I still won everything I was asking for."

Your choice is to let him live there risking your credit and a downturn in the market, or to go to court and force the sale of the house."

And if he can't swing it, and you're currently unemployed...he might need to sell regardless of what he wants to do. Unfortunately that's just how divorce is. Is the house underwater, why does he want to wait to sell?  Once you get a job, you can TRY to see if you can contribute some to the mortgage, and that way as more gets paid down, you should be entitled to more of the $$ you make on the sale."

Housing is hot in our area right now due to major development and it's worth $160k more than what we paid. Hot housing market means scarce rentals, so I suspect he'd like to wait until next spring to buy himself some time/find a rich gf/win the lottery/who knows.  The problem is, the market could tank in the meantime (projects may fall through) and next spring it might be underwater. We are so in debt, the most obvious solution would be to sell the house."
Divorce,3az7e5,tsdguy,2,Wed Jun 24 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"Obviously not the US so US folks are going to go huh?.   Just to be more precise you and your STBX are responsible for 100% of the mortgage, not you responsible for 50%. If he were to default then you'd be 100% responsible. Thats why the lawyer wants the STBX to buy out your part of the mortgage and then he can refinance it and be the sole owner.  If the STBX can't swing the whole mortgage then there's no other choice but to sell and divide the profits. You might want to be nice to him but it doesn't seem like you have the financial means to be nice so to me it's kind of a moot point."

I realize there are people who have cheated and have changed - but until you have that realization, it's always going to be an acceptable thought.  You get injured, you don't smile at her enough, whatever she uses to justify the cheating she'll do.    Think of it this way, if she cheated BECAUSE of your injury that has helped you uncover that you weren't married to a faithful person.  The injury has saved you years.  The alternative might be you stayed married for over a decade, had kids and then she cheats - I'd much rather have the band aid ripped off today over tomorrow ;)"

Also recommend taking 5 mins and understanding the recording laws for your state - then figure out a way to privately record interactions.  Reach out to someone you trust (friend/family) and let them know what is going on.  Let them know generally where you are and what you are doing.    Extreme case, pack a bag for you and your daughter and walk now.  Ask your attorney about doing that but if you really have cause to fear your safety (or your daughters) why take the chance?"

Divorce,3ax02g,Slowlyloosinghope,5,Wed Jun 24 13:30:17 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't hurt for you to see a personal therapist, though you mention you're on medication for anxiety so maybe you're already doing that? Perceived lack of affection and support can absolutely be an anxiety trigger, I know this from personal experience. What's really unfortunate is her lack of wanting to do anything in terms of getting help to better learn how she can support you in this.   There's going to come a point where you're going to have to sit down with her and have the conversation about how you feel about things and how nothing has changed for 4 years and because of that you're considering divorce if something isn't done to improve the marriage. She may get through her unwillingness to give counseling a very real chance because of that, she may not. What you're going to have to deal with is the guilt over being the one to ask for and initiate the divorce, both in terms of her emotional pain and anger, and that of your kids. Both of these are very good reasons to continue seeing a personal therapist no matter what.   Keep in mind it's entirely possible that something has built up over the course of the marriage or that she is carrying baggage from childhood that is preventing her from showing emotional support or wanting to talk about her problems to other people. Unfortunately you're kind of between a rock and hard place in that case because the best thing she can do for herself is to see a therapist, and commit to seeing a therapist and being 100% open and honest about what she's feeling and has been through in the past.   Kids make it hard, life as a single parent doesn't get easier, it's just different. Because of that I would push for giving counseling one final chance and make sure she understands the consequences of not committing to that counseling to improve the marriage for both of you.   Start taking advantage of free 1 hour consultations with lawyers to get a better picture of what things will look like for you legally and financially if you get a divorce.   Good luck, there are a lot of people here who have been through or are going through what you are, and are willing to help you get through this whatever you end up deciding."

What isn't cool is when one spouse refuses to hear the other, and refuses to accept that they have a responsibility to their spouse for nurturing and emotional connection.  If you can't get your wife to realize what you need from her, then you have a lot of thinking to do.  I am not a fan of ""we grew apart"" divorces, I think they are very fixable marriages.  But I am also very realistic.  A marriage cannot be fixed unless both spouses are willing to invest in each other and the marriage."

It usually comes about as a response to childhood or other trauma, not because it is a viable and healthy lifestyle choice.  Regardless of its source, it isn't for everyone.  More marriages are destroyed by it than are saved by it, unfortunately.  It sounds like you're starting to get yourself back on track, though, and that is a good thing.  I'd highly recommend not dating your LD relationship for a while during the divorce process. Whether you want to admit it or not, there are some very real and very normal healing processes that need to take place--even if you want to return to a poly lifestyle.  There are some aspects of emotional healing that just need to take place during a period of singleness.  Good luck to you, I hope you find a path of healing that is healthy and as short as possible."

The fact of the matter was, we were 5 years into a dead bedroom and this was both our ways of finding a little self confidence we'd missed.

Try not to get baited into arguments even if you are responding in a civil manner.  Keep communication to as infrequent as possible and then only short and to the point. Do not discuss the parenting plan with her if possible.  Do not mention ever going back to court if she repeatedly tries to break the agreement.   Those are just a few things that I do. It doesn't stop my ex from trying to start drama but I no longer take the bait. Every now and then I still get an email calling me a name. I just look at it and close it out. The best thing for me has been keeping communication as infrequent as possible.   When dealing with a hostile ex there is nothing that you will be able to do or say to change their behavior.  A lot of people give the advice of taking them back to court but all that will do is put money in a lawyer's pocket that would be better spent on your kids or yourself.  If anyone would like to add to my post please do. This has been a continuous learning process for me and I have been continually modifying my own behavior when it comes to dealing with my ex wife.

I have endured spans of guilt, but it only takes an interaction or two to remember why I got out.   I would assume she has some inkling that this is a possibility?"

I highly suggest you attend by yourself, you need a toolset to manage this transition and a therapist can provide the framework to get you past this.  As others have mentioned there will be this overwhelming relief when you realize that you are on the other side of this.  Right now you are trapped by her and unable to see what is possible.  Take your letter to the therapist and review it.  You may be on the right path by using the letter in place of your voice.  I actually brought my spouse into my therapy session and read the letter in front of her and the therapist and that was my launching point that got me to the point where I could tell her I was divorcing her."
Divorce,3atwca,CaptainShaboigen,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:44:37 2015 UTC,Well at least you're not blind-siding her and she's had ample opportunity to rectify things.

Divorce,3atwca,Catcherofsouls,2,Tue Jun 23 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"OK, but now you would be going to the therapist for a whole different issue.  Instead of ""how do we put this marriage back together?"" it would be ""how do I end this marriage without the flood of regret overwhelming me?"".  Your OP states that exactly, you need help breaking this off, you need to know what words to focus on and how to keep your tone of voice in check.  These are hard words to utter to someone that you committed yourself to, it's great that you are not taking it lightly.  You want to be assured that doing this is the right thing for both of you and a therapist can get you there.  In fact the one that you went to previously is probably sitting there expecting you to come back and ask that 2nd question I have listed above.  She knows"
Divorce,3avfvu,ElectricOkra,2,Tue Jun 23 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"If it's truly a pension, why would you want the present value money now?  Even a fraction of a pension will pay better returns than the investment of any present value lump sum payment you might get now (unless you're Warren Buffett)."
Divorce,3avfvu,hubbyofhoarder,0,Tue Jun 23 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"But I don't get the full pension.  I will only get payments based on what was in there as of the date of the decree.  25yrs from now, I might get $350/mo. for a few years.  I can take that money now and actually use it."
Divorce,3avfvu,hubbyofhoarder,2,Tue Jun 23 20:57:18 2015 UTC,"You're right, you won't get the full pension.  You'll get a fractional percentage, based on 50% of the value of her pension for the years that you were married.  Unless your ex is in one of the worst pension plans that exists, that payout will vastly exceed anything that you could earn by investing that money yourself.  Further, the fact that you don't understand this tells me that you aren't an investment genius.  Unless your lawyer tells you differently, take the fraction of the pension.  Even if you are able to take a cash value payout from that fund for the contributions made by her and her employer during your marriage, you will take a gigantic hit in taxes if you take that money directly as cash, without rolling it over into another retirement vehicle like an IRA, 401k, or whatever.    TL;DR: taking lump sum cash now from the pension is really, really dumb.  See a financial advisor or retirement planner if you doubt me. I'm right."
Divorce,3avfvu,hubbyofhoarder,0,Wed Jun 24 01:26:39 2015 UTC,"Further, the fact that you don't understand this tells me that you aren't an investment genius. Unless your lawyer tells you differently, take the fraction of the pension.   The TRS system (of which I am also a part) is only paying at 2%.    2%  My IRA gets more than that.   But that's not the point.    My payout, after taxes, will allow me to be debt free and several thousand ahead of the game.  Right now, that's more valuable to me.    And the fact you don't understand this tells me you're an asshole."
Divorce,3avfvu,hubbyofhoarder,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"2% if you take the current cash value, my own pension pays at 4%.  If you can do the math (or have it done for you) for the present value of the future payments when you retire, you'd see what I mean.  Whatever, though.  I wrote it the way I did for effect, and you've plainly missed it, or are focusing on being butthurt from someone shooting straight truth at you.  Here:   When you take the cash from current contributions to a defined benefit plan, you get the contributions, plus a contractually specified rate of return for the time of those contributions compounding.  Taking that pension's ultimate benefit, paid timely upon retirement, returns much more than the contributions at that pensions contractually stated cash value rate. In smaller words: your ex's money, compounded at 2% will be massively less than what she'll be paid upon retirement for what she paid into the system. Your portion of that is better for you.  Taking a lump sum cash value payment from a defined benefit plan would mean you'd not only take on significant current tax consequences (that money would count as income, and also likely suffer early withdrawal penalties), but that you'd forego the value of future cash payments that would be nearly impossible to replace in any other way, with most current retirement vehicles.  Thinking solely of what you need now is short-sighted, and, ultimately, is not truly in your best interests.    I encourage you to consult both with your attorney, and with a certified financial planner if you doubt what I've said.    Peace, hugs, and kumbaya."

There are standard and extended possession setups, but again if you work something else out and she signs to it, you're fine.

The good news is, using a lawyer isn't as expensive as you think it is.  Find a lawyer who will simply draft your documents.  You have already said neither of you want to fight.  Great. That means find a lawyer who will draw up your documents the way you want them to read, and close any loopholes for you.  When your wife signs them, the lawyer will then file them with the court.  You need this protection.  As time goes on, your wife may become more and more selfish.  Maybe she won't, but if history is any guide, spouses who run off to live the high life without their kids soon crash back to earth.  The prospect of getting a real job and supporting themselves again becomes a looming possibility--until they realize or have someone (like a mooching BF) remind them that you're a meal ticket if she just goes to court and seeks more custody and child support.  My ex wanted nothing when she left, too, because the grass looked so much greener on the other side.  Once reality set in a couple of years later, she couldn't take me back to court fast enough for support.  The only thing that saved me was the documents my lawyer had drafted.  Protect yourself.

But anyway, it was too much for me to go through and delete each individual picture. So I got rid of it. It's helped because I no longer stare at his page, at our messages, at our pictures and everything. It was a spur of the moment decision when I did it, I regreted at first but I feel better now that I'm not constantly looking at it."
Divorce,3as9sl,CowboyCoach,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:26:32 2015 UTC,Totally -- just took the Facebook pics down myself. Waited until I was ready. I've learned that letting go of some parts of STBX is harder than letting go of others. Moving too quick will kick your ass.

Divorce,3as9sl,johnwalterprescott,3,Tue Jun 23 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"Man, I hear you. I moved out, and I don't know how long it was until she was fucking around... I'm sure she might have been before I even moved out. She had her b/f move into our house within 2 months of me leaving. I was so angry at the time, I'm still a bit angry, but after some time passed, I realized she was the one who was screwed up, and that's not a reflection on me. Being angry, while helping with motivation, doesn't solve anything. Find a counselor you feel comfortable talking to. It really does help.  It's been 6ish months now, and things are SO much better. Hit the gym, eat decently(I ate like crap the entire time I was at my moms), go on meetup, join some rec sport leagues, do something to get your mind off of things, read, whatever it takes. Stay off social media! Try to avoid drinking, it just makes shit worse.   Every day, try to do one positive thing, whether it's 2 hours at the gym or 15 pushups, reading an entire book or just one chapter, anything that pushes you to a goal. There are days where you're going to want to wallow, you're going to be down, you're going to be upset, but making the effort to do one positive thing a day will help you from drowning, and it will help you from getting into the negative reinforcement cycle. You won't necessarily be crossing the English Channel but it will keep your head above water.   Another saying around here is make them regret their decisions by living well. So live well, get off of Facebook, go meet new people, learn new things, you have the opportunity to shape  this next chapter in your life, make it a great chapter that you look back on with happiness, and have no ragrets.

Divorce,3arn0l,Altruizzy,3,Tue Jun 23 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"If you don't have primary custody, your ex can move your daughter away much more easily, even if it's not far, she can randomly change her schools, have more (if not full) say over things like education and medical decisions, etc.  A lot of primary custody isn't how much time you spend, but how much control you have.  If your ex doesn't work, you can work your primary custody so that she has more week days and you have more weekend time.  And don't underestimate the 6pm-bedtime quality time -- it provides a lot of consistency and the ability to set good routines.  And, you don't know when your job situation might change, and you'd have more of a chance to spend time with her (that you will never get if you don't go for it now)."
Divorce,3arn0l,emilystarr,3,Mon Jun 22 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"My gf has a 50/50 with her ex.  She gets the kids two days a week.  He gets them the other two.  Then they alternate F/S/S weekends and then have a holiday schedule.  They track non-food expenses and settle quarterly with almost no conflict. One of them carries health insurance and the other carries dental/vision.    It works surprisingly well and is more routine/stable than my traditional child support + every other weekend settlement with my own kids.   [My ex and I flex a lot more around events and activities, making visitation a bit unpredictable for my kids.]  The whole 50/50 thing works surprisingly well for them and she and her ex get along well enough that they coordinated using the same after-school care throughout the week.  My kids see it and openly wish they had the 50/50 arrangement instead of the traditional.  The thing to watch for is that needs will change as the kids hit the teenage years and get more independent and mobile.   If one of you adults is rule based and the other is more flexible and adaptable naturally, it will leave the kids some maneuvering room to play sides and lead to one of you or the other being frustrated at times.  Communication quality between adults will be a significant factor (and is the only real root issue my gf has in her arrangement right now)"
Divorce,3arn0l,gabrar,2,Tue Jun 23 12:26:41 2015 UTC,"I was going to fight for primary with my stbx, but I didn't really have to. Older son is of the age in my state that unless it was truly a danger to him, the judge will go with what he wants. Younger son is at an age will just will consider his wishes, but my stbx agreed in mediation to go with that son's choice. And he choose me. I actually get more time with my sons because stbx won't take them as much as she is allowed. Get 50/50 with your daughter. If your state allows a child to pick when she gets older, it's possible she will want to spend more time with you because she likes her 50% with you more than with mom. So don't settle for less than 50/50."

Divorce,3arv2k,im-obsolete,3,Tue Jun 23 17:04:21 2015 UTC,The only way to deal with this is to follow your agreement to the letter.  This way there is no room for discussion.  Hopefully you're agreement is clear enough on issues like this.

There are other examples and other stuff she does thats not OK. But really I dont know what to do, it seems that most things will be impossible to prove, and then out of the stuff I can prove when we end up back in court her temperament will probably just get worse if anything changes in my favor. What do the courts even care about? At what point does whats best for the child actually matter. Is abusive drug addict the determining factor and as long as your better than that you are seen as a fit parent?"

Record phone conversations with a free app.  If it gets real bad you'll at least be prepared.   It's good that your daughter is open because it gives you a chance to approach the issues as an adult and she'll see through things eventually.   My daughter is only 7 and she is smart enough to tell when my wife is trying to down me. Every night at bedtime I talk to her for 5-10 about anything she wants, so I'm setting the precedent that she can be open about this stuff, and she is."

Tell him you love him and you hope to continue a relationship with him. I don't know any decent man that raised a boy for 13 years who wouldn't want to hear that.    Those step-sibilings are your brothers. Be there for them like a brother. Invite them out, send birthday cards, shoot the shit, all of those things you would have done. That is still your family. The dynamic has changed, but that doesn't mean you have to lose those relationships. If you called him 'Dad' or 'Bob', that doesn't change. If you used to get him a father's day card, still do that.   You're a grown-up, you get to chose who you keep in your life."
Divorce,3asf9c,abloodyminge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:00:27 2015 UTC,"/u/KrissyQG, I am going through it right now.  I am the stepdad to a 20 y/o son and a 19 y/o daughter.   I told myself in the beginning that I would try to stay strong and anticipate any changes during this transition.  And let me tell you, it's tough.  Basically, the start to this story is....my STBX, who is the biological mom, and I were growing apart.  And as of yesterday, she told me that we were living like roommates as more as a married couple.  I blame myself, yet she tells me that not all is my fault.  I disagree now that she tells me what she told me yesterday about living as roommates.  Two weeks ago, she went to go see a man that she had been conversing with online for a week.  Her plans were:  (1) for me to be moved out by June 30th, (2) for her new man to come on July 1st to visit her for three weeks, meet her kids, look for work, etc.  Well, it hasn't gone that way....  Her kids and I in the beginning of our marriage kinda had a strained relationship.  They were 5 and 4 when they met me, and 6 and 5 when they moved from Canada to be with us in California.  I tried to rely on how my parents raised me.  I was strict.  And I think they disliked me for that right up until the beginning of this year when I stopped being strict, and more as a friend to them.  Mind you of course, they had their chores to do, but I wasn't as on them as much, because I knew they would be done soon after.  Now, my kids are somewhat lazy, but they are good kids.  When my STBX came back from her trip just last week, she told me she inform the kids that they need to get jobs to help contribute, or get out.  I agreed they needed to get jobs, but I was concerned with the ""get out"" part because they really didn't have anywhere to go.  But the kids met together, and then sat down with their mother to tell them that no longer respected her because she was bringing strangers into the home.  I told them not to look at it that way.  To see the bigger picture of having a roof over your head, food on the table...possibly someone helping to contribute while you plan your future (get a job, save money, move out).  My STBX didn't like how her own children reacted, so she said she was moving out.  And she has the better job to afford the place.  So, she asks me if I will stay with the kids.  I told her that I would not abandon them.  I had a plan that the three of us and 8 dogs that we have (we can't give up the dogs to a shelter here where we live, it's a instant kill shelter) to my parents' new home that they moved to nearby for the explicit purpose to be near our family (which is now about to wiped out).  My parents are old school Filipino parents.  They tore me a new asshole on Sunday...on Father's Day....saying that I'm a fool for taking on the responsibility of someone else's children when it should be my STBX's.  They said they'll allow the dogs, but not my stepkids.  I told this to my Mother-in-Law (my STBX's mom) and she didn't blame my parents for how they felt.  I felt so bad.  So, now my daughter wants to go back to Canada.  My son wants to stay in the States to be with his g/f.  I told my son that he and his g/f need jobs soon. But I know what you mean when you miss your family dynamic.  I wish I could have mine back too.  I think you just helped me find the void that I was trying to answer for the last few days.  Thank you.  I want that family dynamic back, but I know I asked for the divorce because this is the second time she cheated.  I forgave her the first time....but I know this all started with my inactions/actions of living not to her expectations.   I tried to stay committed, not to stray.  They will be my kids.  Even if I meet someone else and I have biological kids of my own, they will be their siblings."
Divorce,3aryt4,BladesShadow,2,Tue Jun 23 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"First, if your dad is telling you that he's considering divorce, you need to set boundaries. It's your business in a way but you don't want the precedent of having your dad talk to you about their marriage. That way you can avoid being in the middle as much as possible. Trust me, being in the middle sucks.   Second, if they do get a divorce and have been paying for school, be prepared to get loans. Their budgets will become a lot tighter and there won't be as much disposable income. So just be prepared for that.  Third, if it does happen, look into school offered counseling. This will help you deal with any issues that may arise during the process.   Fourth, remember that you had zero influence on their divorce. Way too many kids blame themselves or try to fix their parents relationships. That's not your job. If it happens, try to not let it affect you. Try to separate school and your family life as much as possible."
Divorce,3appuq,marqueemarque,6,Mon Jun 22 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"California Family Law attorney here.  No, this is not kosher and judges would not be pleased by it.  If I were your attorney, though, I would want to know: how do you know this information?  The testimony of a 4-year-old is shaky.  Could you send your ex an email to ask her to respond to this and hopefully have her admit to it in writing?"
Divorce,3appuq,saricher,2,Mon Jun 22 14:55:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I did in fact hear it from my daughter. I will write her an email to get it documented. Surely this alone isn't grounds for a change in custody right? Our decree states 50/50 custody and describes neither of us as having ""primary"" custody. According to the decree, my custody is 4 nights a week, and hers is 3, although I usually have her much more."
Divorce,3appuq,saricher,2,Mon Jun 22 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"Surely this alone isn't grounds for a change in custody right?   By itself right now, no, that is unlikely.  With the admonition - and order - of a judge, should your ex not comply, that would be an occasion to change custody.  But even if this does not change custody, it would serve to put your ex and the judge on notice of this type of behavior.  I disagree with those here who say, ""Oh, unless you can prove harm the court will ignore it.""  That has not been my experience.    I am surprised that the BF is agreeable to that arrangement - hell's bells, I know men who won't even take a picture of a kid playing in public during a photowalk for fear of someone getting the wrong idea.  What the hell is he thinking?  Why would any guy place himself at risk like that of a child abuse accusation?  It's creepy and I'd be screaming, again if to put the court on notice on some bad decisions by your ex.    And if my daughter described anything that upset her or made her fearful regarding this sleeping arrangement, I would think about having her talk to a mandated reporter (doctor, police officer, teacher, clergy)."
Divorce,3appuq,telnet23,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:24:19 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for this advice.
Divorce,3appuq,Someguywhoneedshelp,2,Mon Jun 22 22:03:17 2015 UTC,"Depending on the state, you may have a legal precedent to prevent co-sleeping. Where I am, there is a standard parenting agreement put forth which states:   ""During any period of overnight visitation with and/or exercise of custody the parties' minor children, neither party shall allow any person whom he or she is not related by blood or by marriage, and with whom he or she is involved in romantic and/or sexual relationship, to stay overnight in the same place with the parties' children.""  IANAL, but if you were arguing against the co-sleeping because you didn't like it, I wouldn't think you have a leg to stand on, however arguing against having your ex's lover in bed with your child seems very reasonable."
Divorce,3appuq,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"I was going to put that same language in my custody agreement with my sons, but my lawyer says you can't enforce it anymore. Again, depends on the state, but don't count on it.  I for one would NOT agree to it because my stbx won't take my sons overnight. And I'm sure for the next 5 years it's going to be difficult for me to arrange evenings for both children to be out of the house if I want to invite a lady friend over. If my stbx agreed to overnights with my sons, I'd agree to that agreement."

Divorce,3appuq,Daemon42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Nutters do that :)  At some point you may need to fight however.  So just smile/nod and bid your time.  Continue to gather evidence/notes and periodically check in with the attorney with what you have an likely outcomes if you present it.  My attorney did a great job of helping me learn some ways to protest like this.  Essentially do everything via email.  When you are done typing your note, walk away for 10 minutes and when you return pretend you are a judge reading the message in the context of reviewing your case.  Do you appear to be nagging/harassing?  Is this a nasty person who just is bitter towards their ex or a concerned parent?  If you are the ""concerned parent"" and are just imparting your desires about your child - it looks pretty good.  Of course hopefully you never go to court.  Once I started this type of approach the malice started to disperse.  Oh yeah, don't get drawn into arguments - even over email.  If she responds with anything you don't agree with a simple ""I disagree, but clearly we aren't seeing eye to eye here so I'll cease my participation""."

Divorce,3appuq,algolagnic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:01:52 2015 UTC,"The character illustration I'm familiar with.  Here is the deal.  She isn't going to respond to a list of 5 anything.  You need to pick your battles.  If the 3 of them sleeping together is a big deal to you a brief email (always email so that you have it recorded) of ""Hey, not comfortable with our daughter sleeping with you and the guy.  Can we please let her sleep in her own bed?""  If that goes ignored - you can't FORCE her to do it.  But this also borders on a safety concern too - so eventually add these up and you ave a legit case for her being a crap parent.  BUT if you get anything from this it needs to be:  1) You don't get to control another adults life (even if they are ""over"" your kid) 2) Keep objections short, civil and distinct 3) Record/document everything (like email) and do not rely on verbal conversations for important things like this."
Divorce,3appuq,bradbrookequincy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:59:57 2015 UTC,Thank you for the practical advice. I try my hardest to adhere to exactly what you've said.
Divorce,3appuq,FreshStartSolo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:48:10 2015 UTC,It's done well for me.  You have to be firm/serious when you state things but not demanding.  Appeal to anything that might be important to the child.  When your daughter is older you can start to help teach her how to deal with visits to crazyland.  That is rough because you are going to want to call it crazyland but under no circumstances should you.  ALWAYS be positive to your daughter about her mom.  If you set a good example it will become obvious to her pretty quick who is putting in the effort and who is phoning in the work so to speak.

Divorce,3appuq,LaTuFu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:05:25 2015 UTC,I found out the father of my child did the same thing with his mistress and our 2 year old daughter. I was LIVID. My lawyer told me there was nothing I could do about it. : \
Divorce,3appuq,Daemon42,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"Is your ex still drinking or did that stop when she got pregnant?  I know that with infants, it's incredibly dangerous for the child to co-sleep with drunk / high / drugged adults. Cosleeping is only safe if you're sane and sober.  If exwife is still drinking / partaking in substances, you could probably find something that shows it's very dangerous to have your daughter in the bed in that situation.   If exwife has stopped the substances, but her boyfriend is still taking them, then it's dangerous for your daughter to cosleep with him (too much risk of passed out adult rolling over and squishing someone and not being sober enough to wake up and move).  That might be one angle to come at it."
Divorce,3appuq,LaTuFu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:31:06 2015 UTC,"She's stopped drinking since the pregnancy. As for the guy, I assume he drinks, but have no way to prove it."
Divorce,3appuq,Daemon42,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:07:09 2015 UTC,"From a boundry and child development side in terms of future safety it is simply wrong because it teaches the child its ok to be in bed with an adult male and its endorsed by the parent making it ""ok"" to the child. This makes it easier for another adult male to abuse your child. Id be sure this is the every night arrangement and not something that happened when your daughter was having nightmares or something. This dude is also a moron for putting himself in this situation ... But he sounds like a moron so."
Divorce,3appuq,Daemon42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:44:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps your daughter is having trouble dealing with her emotions around your divorce and needs extra comfort. Your ex-wife is perhaps providing your daughter with feelings of security and stability by co-sleeping, and her new partner is understanding enough to put her first.  Perhaps you are looking more at your emotions instead of focusing on your child's."
Divorce,3appuq,Funholiday,2,Wed Jun 24 12:12:32 2015 UTC,"You don't get to dictate your ex's life, sorry. Your ""rules"" are meaningless unless they are court documents. You can not control your ex, her life, or how she parents your child. I understand why its disturbing to you, but unless you are willing to get a lawyer involved there's nothing you can do."
Divorce,3appuq,LadyBearJenna,5,Mon Jun 22 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I should clarify that my ""rules"" were all concerning our child's safety and development. Unfortunately, we disagree on parenting ""rules"" that seem to be universally obvious (such as co-sleeping with a relative stranger). This has nothing to do with controlling my ex."
Divorce,3appuq,LaTuFu,6,Mon Jun 22 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"His larger point is, you can't force your wife to abide by any rules that she doesn't want to.  Only the court system can do that.  As the former spouse of an addict, and one who made very similar choices at a very similar time in my child's life, I completely feel your pain.    It is also why I echo /u/curious4sq's comments and say you need a lawyer and a court hearing ASAP if you want anything to change.  Expecting an addict to do something they don't want to do voluntarily is like expecting a wolf not to eat a lamb.  You can hope for it to happen all you want, but you shouldn't be surprised when it does."
Divorce,3appuq,LaTuFu,3,Mon Jun 22 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go about it with ""here are my 5 commandments... er, rules"" but he has every right to say ""Uh, yeah as her father I am uncomfortable with the sleeping arrangement's you are providing for our daughter and do not approve""  This isn't control as much as it's a safety concern for the daughter.  I have also seen this applied to a choice of babysitter (it was the child's aunt, but she essentially decided to sleep for the duration of ""sitting"" the 7 year old).    Can this make the person stop - not alone.  But a list of concerns (especially unanswered ones) can add up."
Divorce,3appuq,LaTuFu,2,Mon Jun 22 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"You and I completely agree on this issue. I'm not saying he's out of line at all.   I'm just saying once he's made it known that he is uncomfortable with it, he has no other choice but to go to court. He can't force her to comply."
Divorce,3appuq,GrandEthos,2,Mon Jun 22 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you all. I'm not resorting to any enforcement of my ""rules."" Perhaps I should have phrased it differently. I'm trying to appeal to logic at this point — something that is proving to be nearly impossible. I understand that court is the ultimate solution for enforcement of any ""rules,"" but I'm trying to find a less forceful solution at this point."

Divorce,3apt97,allwrongs,21,Mon Jun 22 14:58:54 2015 UTC,It's pretty easy to say that but you would still have to deal with the guilt because you betrayed what you believed in. In the end you acted like the person you wanted to be and you're better off for it in the long run.   Just because you could have justified it does not make it justifiable.
Divorce,3apt97,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Mon Jun 22 15:02:22 2015 UTC,Absolutely this!

Better off for it in the long run? Feel good vernacular that's not only pandering but supercilious.  At the very least if I did cheat, my guilt would be real and consequences befitting.   All those hive minded people upvoting you are doing it for themselves. Don't let it fool you"
Divorce,3apt97,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Tue Jun 23 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry you're in pain, I'm more sorry that you think the answer to that pain is to do onto others what was done to you, and that doing the same would somehow make you a happier person now.  I'm sorry that you're trying to justify your desire to have done worse in the past by disregarding anything anyone has to say that contradicts what you want to believe.   You are better off because you're a better person, because you understood at one point what it meant to be committed to something other than just your own selfish desire.   The real tragedy here is that instead of holding on to that better person you've decided you'd rather be the person you hate.   So good luck with that. I really do hope you find happiness, only looking out for yourself and screwing over everyone in your life may give you temporary pleasure, but you won't be happier for it in the end."
Divorce,3apt97,Slowlyloosinghope,3,Tue Jun 23 15:01:57 2015 UTC,"Well I tell you what, if one road led to purgatory, logic dictates take other route."
Divorce,3apt97,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"logic dictates take other route.   You're using logic as a justification for you actions. But what logic? What is the outcome you want to get from it? Logic can be used for many many things but the outcome is not always a positive one.   Lets look at this logically.  You're advocating to only look out for yourself and do whatever makes you happy at the time, including betraying and commitments or responsibilities you've chosen to take on.  Logically what is the outcome of breaking those commitments/responsibilities?   Marriage - Divorce (shitty) Job - Losing your job repeatedly Family - No longer supports you Friends - No more friends   Ok that worked out well because screw them anyways you don't actually need anyone in your life anyways.  Lets go instead off of your example:   Two roads is an interesting choice, you assume to know where each roads destination is? Wait no, you assume to know the destination of one and then logically choose the unknown destination.   That's not logic. Logic would dictate that you learn more about the consequences of the unknown road before making what can only assumed to be a critical choice. This means looking at the consequences of your actions, this means making the choices that will provide the most long term benefit rather than the easy fix.   If you're going to use logic then fine, use logic, but stop ignoring all evidence that goes against what you want simply because you view that as the reason you're in pain."

Maybe he doesn't want to be married any more than you do,  but like you he feels an obligation due to the child, and so here you are. Trust me it isn't worth investing in the relationship if only one of you actually cares to do so. You'll still end up divorced in another 5 years... frankly you will probably end up having an affair at some point with a guy who takes hygiene seriously. At that point your kid will be just old enough to understand some of what is going on and suffer accordingly.  Give him an ultimatum. He can decide to invest or you can go your separate ways.

Divorce,3apweu,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"No I haven't. That's what I'm trying to accomplish. I tried talking to my wife(divorce still in progress) to meet up and go to the place where we could do the test, but she stopped talking to me."

Get the idea out of your head that you can figure out how to do this ""on the cheap.""  Denying paternity, proving it, and getting your name off of a state record are incredibly complex, difficult tasks that require a knowledgeable professional.  The state is not going to let you off the hook for supporting that child easily, so get used to the idea of paying someone to get you out of that obligation."

Every article I've ever read about this basically says that the only way to get your name off the birth certificate is to have the actual bio father acknowledge paternity, and then go through some kind of court procedure.

Even as ""easy"" as it was for me, I still had a lawyer involved because we had to discuss who would claim the daughter on taxes for the 2014 tax year, as well as ensure everything was done correctly.  If you are legally the father, she can't stop you from taking the child to a DNA test lab and getting the test yourself like /u/twisted_thong said. I found a company on line that spread the payments out over 3 or 4 months on my credit card, but still provided me the results when they were ready when I wanted to find out about the other two children my stbx and I have. They directed me to a testing facility that was close by, I provide my driver's license, and then they took a swab of my mouth and my sons' mouths.

Divorce,3aq6fw,blaz3one,3,Mon Jun 22 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"Both of you need personal therapy and joint counseling if the marriage is going to be saved. Offer to start marriage counseling with her, if she refuses you should still go yourself to both show her you're committed to fixing your issues, and to start learning to make yourself a better husband, and what it is you really want in the marriage.    Other than sex issues, she has nothing to complain about. We have a nice house, two car's, our kids are amazing and she thinks I'm a good father.   The perspective she's not telling you might be vastly different. Communication issues are a marriage killer. Unfortunately we get into habits and bad communication is definitely an easy habit to form.    She gave me an option to have an open marriage, and have other partners but I can't mentally handle that.   She may be already done with the marriage to the point that she's trying to get you to agree to having other partners. Counseling will only help if she's willing to commit to it and not look for alternatives to the marriage. It's still your best first option. Though it wouldn't hurt to consult with a few lawyers just to figure out where you'd stand should it come to divorce."

Has already started an inappropriate relationship with another (older) man. It has only been a few months.   I don't play PC games or dance around SJW triggers.  If she's got all of this swirling around her within a few months at a car dealership, she is very likely to be an instigator in some pretty inappropriate behavior for a work environment.    If she is doing it and is unaware, she better prepare herself for some Corporate training at the hands of her HR department.    It is also possible, however, is that she is completely aware of what her behavior is, and enjoys the attention she is getting.    The problem is, either way, there is very little chance it is not being noticed.  There may be men who are hitting on her, but that doesn't mean every man there is doing it or appreciative of what she is doing in the workplace.  There is also a really solid chance there are some women there who are not happy at all that she's turned their work environment into a singles club.    I've witnessed this type of situation happen in workplaces on 3 different occasions that I can think of right off the top of my head.  None of those situations went unnoticed by co-workers or management.  Even more importantly, none of the people involved kept their jobs when management was finally forced to step in."

Divorce,3apz6e,anytimeyoulike,-1,Mon Jun 22 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"He's declaring a side. SJW stands for Social Justice Warriors, which is something people call feminists and such when they don't think they should be taken seriously. Nobody said anything about triggers. He's just complaining about people who push for social progress. They can be annoying; sometimes they take things too far and it can be irritating when people upset the status quo. However, that doesn't mean they're always wrong.    It's possible he's right about your wife though. Maybe your wife is flirtatious. I'm just saying that in my experience, it is outrageous to assume by default that it's her fault she gets hit on. It can be very, very hard to avoid.     This one is up to you: What do you think your wife's behaviour is like when she's at work?"
Divorce,3apz6e,Catcherofsouls,2,Mon Jun 22 19:00:44 2015 UTC,She has had a history of being flirtatious because she likes the attention and even recently has admitted that she wants the attention now that she had told me she wants a divorce. I've asked nicely for her to at least please wait until we are actually divorced but she has no concern for my feelings.
Divorce,3apz6e,anytimeyoulike,2,Mon Jun 22 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear that. Sometimes by the time one partner says the D-word, they're already gone. It can take a lot for someone to bring up divorce, and if you were caught off guard by this, then it might take a while for you to catch up emotionally.    Your desire to ask her to wait is understandable. Sadly, that doesn't mean she will- or should- respect it. It sounds like as far as she's concerned, your relationship is over and she will do whatever she wants with other men. You're right that it isn't very nice of her, but it is what it is.    This is an issue that comes up pretty often in this subreddit, I think. There was a post about it just last week."

Divorce,3apz6e,LaTuFu,2,Mon Jun 22 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"Good on you for taking responsibility for it. But there's no way you were made aware of it every time it happened.    Sexual harassment is frustrating, and much more ubiquitous than most people realize. In order for a woman to make a complaint and be taken seriously, it has to be overt, severe, and easy to prove. Most workplaces have a sexual harassment problem that lies just under the surface. An attractive 24-year-old woman is virtually guaranteed to have male co-workers treat her differently, make strange assumptions about her, exclude her, talk about her behind her back, ask her out or want to ask her out, compete for her attention, etc.     Short of walking a line so narrow as to be completely nonexistent, where she's exactly professional and cold enough without crossing a line into being a ""bitch"", no woman can do anything to prevent this. Especially attractive young women.    So sure, it's possible that OP's wife is flirtatious. But to assume that it's her fault that she gets hit on is outrageous."
Divorce,3apz6e,anytimeyoulike,2,Mon Jun 22 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"When it is as you describe, yes, it can be difficult.  When it is as OP describes about his wife's situation, it is less difficult.  When there are multiple employees involved, it is virtually impossible for management to not hear about it or see it.  I've seen situations where male employees were wrongfully accused of inappropriate behavior by a manager, too, so it isn't always the ""man's world"" situation you're talking about, either."

Divorce,3apz6e,anytimeyoulike,0,Mon Jun 22 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"No, not angry, just stating facts.  Please don't try to condescend that way.  Just speaking in realistic terms.  Major corporations today are exposed to too much liability and negative publicity in scenarios like what OP's husband describes.    In the situations that I have first hand experience with, as a personnel manager, the second these situations were brought to the attention of HR by employees, they were dealt with swiftly.    As I mentioned in a previous post, I witnessed at least 3 situations up close (those 3 I was not involved as a manager, but as a co-worker or friend of the parties involved) where management was made aware of inappropriate behavior by the employees involved.  In all 3 situations, management's reaction was swift and severe.  All 6 employees in the 3 separate situations were terminated for violating company policy.  In 2 of the situations, the female employee was the instigator of the situations that occurred, but the gender is largely irrelevant, imo.  All of the parties involved were married at the time, so the behavior was inexcusable on multiple levels, regardless of who supposedly started what.  In the third situation, the male employee was the direct report of the female employee.  You can't get any more cut and dry than that.  In a 4th situation that I know of, a female manager harassed several of her male direct reports for a sustained period of time.  The men never reported it for fear of reprisal, like you mentioned in your post.  She had an inappropriate relationship with one of her direct reports, and it went on for some time.  Her boss discovered the relationship somehow, and she was immediately transferred to another region within the company.  The male employee was also reassigned to other duties.  That's the only situation I know of that didn't result in termination.    I'm not angry about feminism.  Just aware that the reality today in the corporate world is much different than what you were trying to imply."

Basically they just make sure you have all the loopholes covered and will represent neither of you.  Short of that, if she is already going to a lawyer you will want one as well.  Otherwise the lawyer may say something like ""You really want to add a clause about ___ because it helps you"" and you not having a lawyer won't know if the implication of that is a big deal or not.  Do what you can to start splitting your life apart.  When you file you have to declare your assets - so if they are held up with an account only you touch vs the joint, no biggie - but if she gets pissed and decides to go on a shopping spree - that is just cash that is blown.  You could just say ""Hey FYI, I just opened a separate account for my checks to deposit in - I also used 1/2 the money in the checking account understanding the other 1/2 is yours""."

We have an issue she didn't talk Doesn't like social settings (hard to have ""friends over"") To her, our kids are obligation/chore   So after I went out and dated... thinking I was just getting that out of my system I met wife #2.  She was damn near perfect.  Everything I ""hated"" about wife #1 she excelled at in the opposite direction.  We even had arguments where we resolved things well - so I figured ok this is all legit.  Problem is she had other issues that were equally as bad.  The largest one is that when it came to her daughter there was no negotiation.   Her way or the highway.  She also started growing insanely jealous of wife #1.  Both of these things were lost on me focusing on my ""what I want to avoid"" list from 1st marriage.

I don't want to end up with someone who is completely passive in life and relationships, though, as it would be both unattractive and not a good fit with my own personality.

I'm in a similar position, although I went on dates right after my separation and it was way too soon. I was just lonely and wanted to forget about my pain. I realized I was addicted to validation from the opposite sex. So when my wife was gone, I looked anywhere and everywhere for female approval. I've since backed off dating and just trying to meet my own needs not need external validation. Quite lonely though. I miss sharing my deepest feelings and thoughts with a trusted person.  Now I'm the same boat as you, interested to know when dating would be healthy again. But I'm scared. I was so intensely close and deep with my exwife, and got burned so badly, that I'm not sure how to slowly open up to a new person. I feel like I'm ready to fall in love with the next woman that comes into my life, but I know that's not love or healthy.  I saw this good quote that is really guiding me at this time. Basically, I'm using this time of not dating to find myself, and love myself, and from that, I'll attract someone who really values the real me.

Divorce,3aom36,Chees_a_saurus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"A partner who is everything my ex wasn't/isn't.    I agree that as long as this is your guiding framework then you aren't ready.  Your ex should not be a part of your framework, because that means that your framework has no room for someone new.  The framework needs to be forcibly dismantled by you, in addition to letting time work its magic.  I also agree that this framework requires a degree of non-human perfection from any new partners who shouldn't be held responsible for choices you made in your past.  If your ex sometimes wasn't emotionally supportive of you when you spoke of a problem from work, you're liable to freak out and leave when a new partner isn't fully present when you're talking about work.  ""How didn't I see that?  He's just like him!""  When, really, maybe that new partner had a bad day at work himself, and it was a one-off.  You will be rigid and accusatory, and that's not fair to anyone that you date.  Humans are human beings with flaws.  Expecting perfection so you don't have to experience any discomfort means you are using them as tools; you aren't dating, you're being selfish by rebounding.  You cannot be a good partner to anyone else when you are like this.    Every person will have flaws.  There are, as of this writing, no artificially intelligent beings to meet 100% of your wants and needs in a partner.  It's about finding someone who has what you need, and most of what you want, and whose flaws you can accept as part of them.  So, work on dismantling that framework, find security and confidence on your own, then date.   But when I think about actually sharing my feelings with an actual dude, or having sex with someone else...nope. Not there yet.    This is another sign that you're not ready.  Concentrate on meeting friends and joining new activities.  You should be focused on yourself and rediscovering who you are without the marriage.  For a long time, you've been part of a ""we.""  Now, even if you wanted the ""we"" to end, it's gone.  It's gone and that's traumatic.  You are now an ""I"".  Who is that ""I""?  You're going to be different from the last time you were an ""I"" because you've had more life experiences.  Figure that out.  When you're well down this pathway, you will be able to approach the concept of dating from a healthy mindset that allows for people you date to be human beings with flaws.  Your criteria will be something like ""someone I'm attracted to, who is kind, who loves animals, who shares my humor, who has similar values, and who supports himself and has ambition.""  That's when you're ready; when you're able to be driven by what you do want rather than what you don't want.  It allows people to be human.  If your partner isn't as present as you'd like when you're talking about your bad day, you'll assume the best of him rather than jumping to conclusions about your over-dramatic Sherlock Holmes discovery of how he's not right for you and he's just like him and how could you let yourself be fooled, and say ""Oh, he's probably having a bad day, too.  I feel disappointed but I'll give to him rather than retreat and ask him how he is doing.""  When you can fully accept that you made a poor choice with your ex, and understand what drove you to make those poor choices (ex: ""I felt like I was getting old and everyone else was partnered, so I thought he'd do"", or ""I wasn't healed from disappointments with my dad during my childhood, and so I subconsciously chose someone where I could play out those disappointments anew.""), another piece falls into place.   When you can see clearly how you contributed to the downward spiral of your failed marriage, and take responsibility for those contributions so that you will learn from them, another piece falls into place.    When all those pieces are there, you are ready."
Divorce,3aom36,amentest,-1,Mon Jun 29 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"As soon as my ex wife moved out, the girl I met at the oil lube place moved in. Ok I exaggerate.  It was about 30 days later.  The next year was hell.  But at least I wasn't lonely!! My kids suffered at both homes.  So I'm guessing the male perspective on your question is different than the female perspective.  Men are shallow when it comes to mating.  Women are deep.  So deep that when they fall out of love with us we don't even know it.  So the nugget you're looking for is you're ready to date right now.  As far as sex goes that all depends on your goals and objectives.  Are you looking for ""the one"" and are prepared to kick a lot of tires over the next year or so, and what you're bringing to the table.  Or just want to be social to break up the boredom of every day life.  Be warned though. You're dealing with a lot of jaded disallusioned men out there. (US)"
Divorce,3aom36,Ineffably_Sublime,3,Mon Jun 22 11:36:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I don't think that men and women fit into boxes as neatly as you seem to imply.  Everyone is different.  Sex has never been a shallow thing for me and I have dated many women that were pretty shallow about it.  They just wanted sex and did not seem to value the emotional component of a physical relationship.  Of course it could be that you and I have a different interpretation of ""shallow.""  To the OP.  I would say that a good place to start is that you are ready to date when you can spend an evening with a date and not be constantly thinking about or comparing the date with your ex.  I think that the physical relationship (sex) will be an extension of that.  when you have reached the point that you can enjoy someone at a cerebral/ emotional level, sex will be a natural/instinctual result and you'll enjoy it (hopefully.)    If the sex is an issue for you at any point of the recovery process, please speak to a counselor (properly vetted and accredited, of course.)  It is my opinion that humans are inherently sexual creatures, that our physical, emotional, and intellectual selves are interlinked and cannot be separated."

Divorce,3aoglm,Slowlyloosinghope,3,Mon Jun 22 07:01:10 2015 UTC,"The affair fog is a real thing, it's entirely likely that he was solidly in it when he asked for the divorce, all the reasons were simply justifications for his behavior. Now after a month that illusion has started to wane and he's seeing his life for what it actually is. So how do you decide if you want to give him a chance, or even if you can?  Time mostly, but therapy is a huge part of that. Get a personal therapist, have him get a personal therapist and work on yourselves for awhile before coming together for joint therapy if that's what you both want. The thing is at some point both of you have to commit 150% to making the relationship work if it's going to succeed. Which means divorce is off the table, it's not an option. As long as you have a backdoor escape option planned you won't be able to work through the hard times that will happen.  No one can make this decision except for you. Right now you're in an emotional mire and really until you get yourself out of it you won't be able to make a choice based completely on the emotions you're feeling right now. Get a therapist, stop putting it off because you're only delaying your own healing and figuring out what you actually want out of life. Whether that be married or single."

And I think that's what emotional pain is: the disconnect between my ideal spouse and the cold hard facts of reality- it hurt to admit that she was hurting me, it hurt to admit that the warm and loving woman I married no longer existed. The pain was in unsuccessfully grasping for ghosts.  I think reframing pain as that- the disconnect between thought and reality- is helpful in making use of pain. Instead of just wallowing in the pain, you can see it as a learning tool, to wake up to reality. And the sooner you realign your thoughts with reality, the sooner the pain fades.   Best of luck!"

Talk to a therapist. And you may not feel comfortable at first, but try some of the online dating sites.

Can you move anywhere else, like with family or friends?

Divorce,3alqy1,ZA_SDK,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:56:48 2015 UTC,At least you have the presence of mind to recognize that you are going through this and it will pass with time. That's a start.  The usual recommendations help. Therapy and gym time. Going to meet ups and just generally getting outside helps.  I watched a documentary once where they followed children every seven years until they were about 60. To see the changes in seven years was amazing and made me realize that life is unpredictable. When I feel down and that things are too hard I just think of how different my own life was seven years ago. Then I focus on how much better it can be in the next seven.  May be silly but it helps me :) Good luck to you and hang in there.

From my personal experience, I've found it to be something that isn't very linear. Coming to terms with that has meant that I can experience these different emotions without feeling like I'm going backwards. It doesn't mean that the stages will definitely repeat for you, but just keep it in mind if it does happen.  In terms of healing time, I don't think that there's actually a standard that applies for everyone. Take as much or as little time as you need and don't worry about if it's normal.   Highly recommend you do as you said you were going to and reach out to a therapist. Very high return on investment when you find the right person.

Divorce,3akuj1,Justkeepbreathing123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:16:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think that there's really a ""normal"" length of time to work through the flurry of emotions that divorce brings. The important thing is to start working towards building the future that you want. Redirect the energy into planning and executing your vision."
Divorce,3akuj1,anytimeyoulike,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"How long it takes before the anger subsides is going to be different for everyone. There's no ballpark or normal range. It took me a few months. I have a sibling going through something similar who is still raging out after several years. My sibling's spouse cheated, but at this point my sibling is the one being the asshole.    I think it's probably partly a matter of who you are and what your situation is, and it's partly a choice. Do you want to live with this hanging over your head, or do you want to look to the future and assume it will be bright?"
Divorce,3al8m9,aloneinsco,9,Sun Jun 21 08:14:51 2015 UTC,"Well...  As someone who has been divorced twice I can speak with some authority here.  You're not damaged goods, needing help on occasion doesn't make you a failure.  All of the feelings and emotions you are describing here are completely normal.  The shame is normal, the anger is normal, the sadness is normal, the anxiety is normal.  The inability to see a good future for yourself, let alone ANY future that doesn't totally suck is normal.  You're having a completely normal reaction to a screwed up situation.  And, you're going to be OK.  It may not feel like it, it may not be what you wanted, but life goes on after divorce.  It REALLY does, and it can be so much better for you if you work to make it that way.  Don't worry about sorting it all out right now, don't worry about blame.  Just concentrate on each day as it comes right now, and holding your shit together as best you can.  You're going to have good days, you're going to have bad days.  It's normal.  The death of a marriage is REALLY painful, but it's not the end of the world.  So, take a deep breath, let it out slowly.  You're really going to be OK."

But after being on this subreddit, I've come to realize that there's still a chance for happiness. We just have to give ourselves time, lots of time. I moved to Washington so I can be with stbx and now I'm stuck here for a year until I can finally go home. My family flew down to be with me the weekend everything happened because I couldn't afford to fly to them, and that helped so much. Nothing wrong with family bailing you out all."
Divorce,3al8m9,albertnacht,2,Sun Jun 21 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"Get some exercise (go for a lap or two around the airport), eat a a bowl of soup or something nourishing and light, get some more exercise, eat again.  Keep moving forward.  Divorce is a setback, but it says nothing about your personal qualities.   Be thankful that your dad can help, and think about relocating to the US.  I wish you well."
Divorce,3al8m9,Maj_LeeAwesome,2,Sun Jun 21 13:05:34 2015 UTC,"Hey.   I know how you feel. I've been in a very similar spot... literally sobbing in an airport hoping nobody notices.   My wife of ten years cheated on me with one of her married clients and wouldn't hear of trying to make our marriage work: ""It's too late"" she said... God, I got so sick of hearing that. I would plead to give us a shot at therapy or anything to save us, but she utterly refused.   She grew up where I currently live, so she has a lot of childhood, high-school, and college friends in the area, wheras mine are several thousand miles away.   First off, you need to take care of yourself. You need to eat, you need to sleep, and you need to do so in a healthy way. Go see your Doctor. I felt like such a failure by accepting the prescription he gave me to help me sleep and reduce anxiety, but realize there are chemical changes in your head that are making you feel the way you are: this is a way of restoring some balance until you're back to a relatively normal state. Gofind a therapist: you really need someone to talk to, and most importantly, to listen and provide perspective. It's important.   You are not damaged goods, and in fact, it's better that this happened early in life. Mine occurred when I was 41, with a daughter, and believe me, it is so much harder trying to rebuild now than at age 23. This was your practice marriage. Be a student of this. Learn what you can from this experience and apply it to your next one. It's only a failure if you learn nothing.   I know you've heard this last bit more than a few times, but it really does get better, and you will be such a better person. I know it seems hard to see that place from whre you're currently standing, but it's true. You'll be a much happier person in time: you'll appreciate the highs in life so much more now, having experienced the low. I speak from experience.   You got this."

Divorce,3al8m9,Altruizzy,-1,Mon Jun 22 13:44:44 2015 UTC,It's like a business deal. You guys tried to put things together and it didn't work out. Try to look at it from a no fault perspective. Sounds like your husband is a loser to me. How long were you guys married? What do you do for a living? Did you know today is father's day? Lose yourself in his arms!
Divorce,3al7e7,Subject-Entropy,6,Sun Jun 21 07:52:01 2015 UTC,"The death of a marriage is painful no matter the circumstances. Sending her a birthday card would be for you only. I'm sure that the thought that would be behind it on your end would be misconstrued on her end.  So...if you feel you must do something, go ahead and buy a card, write what you want to say, but never send it or give it to her. Sometimes going through the process of writing a letter or card to your STBX is cathartic, but remember, it is ONLY for you.  Nothing that you do is going to make your marriage turn out the way you wanted it to be. That's the hardest part, the fantasy of what your marriage could have been if both of you truly loved each other and were committed to one another."
Divorce,3al7e7,Redhead824,3,Sun Jun 21 10:42:52 2015 UTC,"I have no advice for you. Except just don't. :-)  Story time: mine always made a really big deal about birthdays. As in, she'd get very angry if it didn't go her way, or she felt someone didn't invest enough in her birthday. Really childish. She's in her 30's FFS.  One year, she was literally on the floor, banging her fists on the floor like a toddler kicking and screaming, because I jokingly ""forgot"" her birthday for a minute before giving her a present. This was my first big red flag that something's not right with this person (alas, I foolishly wrote it off and forged ahead...).  Another year, she screamed at me for not remembering to wish her happy birthday. It was 6:00 am, and I hadn't gotten out of bed yet. Sorry for not being fast enough!!!  This year, for the first time, I spoke my mind and told her exactly what I really think: she's a spoiled brat in an adult's body, and birthdays are for children; it's time for her to grow the fuck up. I did this on her birthday. She was speechless (a rarity!). She will never forgive me for this huge infraction. Feels good, man. :-)  My birthday's in a few days. It doesn't mean anything. I'll take our boys out for ice cream. It'll be fun! It'll be a gift if I don't hear from her at all that day!"
Divorce,3al7e7,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Sun Jun 21 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"Score one for you.  Similar story involving any holiday for which my STBX expected a present.  If she knew I had it beforehand, she would throw tantrums if I did not allow her to open it early."
Divorce,3al7e7,frumbiggie,3,Mon Jun 22 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"My ex is still in my head, I still continue wanting to drop her a friendly note, help her with things, pass good wishes to her, etc.  The thing I keep telling myself is that she wanted out of our marriage and that she is the one who left.  Any feelings I have are likely out of guilt and a sense of regret.    If my ex has no feelings for me, a card means nothing. If my ex has feelings toward me, a card would likely upset her."
Divorce,3al7e7,albertnacht,2,Sun Jun 21 15:36:51 2015 UTC,You are holding on to a fantasy. Wishing her a birthday isn't about her. It is about you. Why? What is she going to do? Apologize?
Divorce,3al7e7,Altruizzy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:27:35 2015 UTC,"Best course of action is to cut it off and just not do it.  Begin the healing process by not focusing on her life events.  Find some event to attend on that day, get out and do something for yourself. If nothing else, it could be a good distraction.  My older son and my STBX share the same birthday.  Dealing with that will be bittersweet for me in the future."

Divorce,3ajjkq,livebed,8,Sat Jun 20 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, I would say this sub is probably about two-thirds to three-quarters emotional, with the remainder legal and practical.  So don't feel like your question is out of place.  I would say you need to do three things.  First, figure out why it is you want a divorce.  Why do you feel terrible?  In general, in my experience, people often mistake ""My marriage is unhappy"" for ""I'm unhappy.""  And that means they get a divorce and they are still just as unhappy, only now without any chance of getting support from a spouse.  So you say you've felt terrible for several months.  Figure out why that is.  The way to do that is to find a therapist and work through whatever issues are making you unhappy.  And if it turns out to be your wife, then you can figure out what to do about that.  And what you can do about that -- the second thing I mentioned above -- is go to marital counseling so the two of you can together address what it is about the marriage that makes you unhappy, assuming she's willing.  Or, you may decide that you don't want to give the relationship a chance after all.  I don't recommend this, generally -- I'm almost always in favor to trying to fix a marriage -- but sometimes it's necessary and that's something you need to decide for yourself.  But if you decide that without getting your arms about why you're conflicted, why you've felt terrible, why you say you want to give the relationship a chance but you're still thinking about divorce -- you're not only not doing yourself any favors, you're sabotaging your life.  Finally, you say you're thinking about how your single life would be.  Here's the third thing you need to do, and if you ignore everything else I say, please pay attention to this.  Stop.  It's ridiculous.  You don't know how your single life would be.  You're not psychic.  You have no idea.  It will be better in some ways that you can't predict.  It will be worse in other ways that you can't predict.  You're throwing your marriage away for a fantasy.  Don't fall for ""the grass is greener"" syndrome, and stop ignoring the good things in your reality so you can focus on the theoretically better things in your imagination."
Divorce,3ajjkq,AwesomeScreenName,3,Sun Jun 21 01:53:25 2015 UTC,That last paragraph is so spot on. Thanks for writing.
Divorce,3ajjkq,felpudo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:36:25 2015 UTC,"Big belated thanks for this reply! I'm googling therapists now.   So you say you've felt terrible for several months. Figure out why that is.   I'm pretty sure I know why I felt terrible. My previous posts in /r/DeadBedRooms tell more of the story. The really bad period was over 6 months ago though, and things have gotten better since then. It's still not good. I don't trust her to not fall back into her old behavior and I still think of leaving. It would be much better if I could get those thoughts out of my head, but that may be like trying to ignore a bad situation.   And that means they get a divorce and they are still just as unhappy, only now without any chance of getting support from a spouse.   That's one thing that worries me. I'm not a happy kind of person, but I've been actively working on improving lately. We did go to marriage counseling about a year ago, which helped our marriage somewhat, but it was actually after that that I started to feel really terrible, while she was happier.   Don't fall for ""the grass is greener"" syndrome, and stop ignoring the good things in your reality so you can focus on the theoretically better things in your imagination.   Good point. Thanks again."
Divorce,3ajjkq,Offthepoint,4,Thu Jul 2 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"Please. I know a couple that had their court date for the divorce and they decided to see a marriage counselor, to make sure they were doing the right thing, because they had a small child. They had a woman counselor who really got them to deal with their ongoing issues.  That happened at year 5. Next month is their 39th."

After 6 months of trying to make our relationship work, she told me she had been unhappy the entire time and asked me for a divorce. I could see she didn't want to try anymore.  I would have appreciated her being honest with me about how she was feeling. It might not have solved our problems, but avoiding communicating how she really felt did a lot of damage. Maybe discussing it together will help you address your feelings? You could seek out a therapist or counselor if you're not comfortable with that."

Divorce,3ajy5u,HampinessIsAWarmGun,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:53:51 2015 UTC,Leaving or not is your call but I can tell you being on your own is quite freeing.  Before my ex left I hadn't ever lived alone or had to do anything by myself. I always had a roommate or boyfriend around. When my ex left I panicked. How will I do it on my own?  What about my anxiety?  What if....what if.  Well I had to do it. I had to be alone because I had no choice. After a few months I realized how nice it was. No one over my shoulder. I can do what I want when I want to (well with a 4 year old in tow). I was scared shitless about being a single mom and alone in a part of town I didn't know anyone in but it's two years later and I'm still here and way more happy than I ever was.  My son is a happy kid and he doesn't really care that we have little money. Kids don't know that stuff. Keep your happy mom face on and they will be fine.  I'm not saying it's not hard either but sometimes it's the best if the people we are around are that toxic.  Good luck. Pm me if you have any specific questions.
Divorce,3ajy5u,LeezardQueen,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding and sharing your experience. To hear about any positive experience is encouraging.

Divorce,3ajy5u,LeezardQueen,3,Sat Jun 20 23:37:07 2015 UTC,Maybe try some individual counselling to try to sort out what you really want. I found it helped me a lot.

Divorce,3aiw0x,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:41:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, you need to keep in mind that you can't control her actions.  It's difficult to accept, but she's going to do what she thinks is right for her.  She won't necessarily make the correct decision, and she won't necessarily make the decision you would want her to make, but they are her decisions.  So when you say you see mixed emotions on what she wants, understand you can't force her to go one way or another.  What you can do is make the positive changes in yourself.  You mention your depression and your drinking, and it sounds like you've made progress on both of those.  Congratulations!  That's a huge accomplishment.  Keep going down that path.  In addition to the couples therapy, I strongly recommend you get individual therapy.  This separation is going to be enormously stressful, and -- despite my first paragraph -- you're going to worry about what your wife is going to decide because that's just human nature and you're human.  Therapy will help you work through that, and make sure you don't let the stress push you back to drinking, or being emotionally distant.  And then you walk the walk.  Your wife will see the changes in you.  You will be a better man.  And that's the goal.  Not proving something to your wife, not convincing her to rebuild the marriage -- just being a better man.  The rest will follow, one way or the other.  And it will be OK."

Wake up every day and tell yourself you're an awesome person with great morals and a wonderful future.  Other than that I watched a ton of Netflix and realized I could do anything I wanted.

Way too much emotional baggage and pent up emotions about the STBX.  You can try to meet someone for physical intimacy if that's an option, but put relationships on hold until you're well clear of the divorce and in a stable living situation with your two sons.  It's just not worth it.  If you meet someone great, you might wreck a relationship that could have been something grand in the future.  It's hard to be alone, but if you have a hobby (or get one) that you can do at home, it's really helpful.  I was into gaming, so after the kids were in bed I'd spend an hour or two online just disappearing into another world.  I also enjoy working out so I bought some cheap dumb bells and a bench and got to work on myself until my boys were a little older and could go to the gym daycare while I worked out."

The two that live with me are 15 and 11; in other words, maybe similar age to yours given you were with your ex for nearly 20 years. It's brilliant. My biggest challenge at the moment is coaxing them out of their rooms where they've been hiding for years while bullshit occurred. But we get to do do bro stuff and that's great. I've just spent the afternoon cleaning up the recently sold family home, am about to go to the new place via picking up #3 son form his sleepover, drag #2 away from whatever the hell he's playing these days to lug a few boxes around, and then we'll try out a new Ramen place close to our new suburb (#2 son is a Japanophile of major proportions) and return home for a shitty video.

Divorce,3ah730,despisedlove2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"I was in your shoes a year and a half ago, but our situations were different in that I initiated the divorce and was working full time.  My ex-wife lost her job (twice) during the separation and then re-married a month after our papers were signed and moved 300 miles away.  I was the full custodial parent and only get a break every third weekend.  Here are some thoughts:  1) Try to look at this situation as empowering.  It IS stressful, but you get to create a home for your two sons.  You are responsible for doing the cleaning and vacuuming, but all of your efforts go towards building that better home.  Over time, you'll accumulate more pictures of your sons to hang on the walls and those will be your trophies marking your great accomplishment.  2)  You won't win any medals and often times you will feel cheated or unappreciated; try not to.  Those two boys you're raising are your achievement and it's a HUGE task being a single parent -- but equally a HUGE feather in your cap as you succeed.  You have to learn to generate that appreciation from within.  The kids will likely never know and the outside world may likely never know.  It's possible that in the future, when you begin dating again, your partner will appreciate what a great Dad you've been, but your focus right now should be entirely on taking care of them and finishing school so you can provide.  In the meantime, realize that what you're doing is an amazing thing.  You didn't ask to do this alone, but you DID ask to be a Dad -- and now you're stepping up.  Good job, man!  3)  Most of the advice on reddit is to focus on your kids and I wholeheartedly agree with that.  But don't lose yourself in all of this.  It's okay to set them up with a movie or two so you can have some downtime during waking hours.  It's okay focus on what you need from time to time.  They will always be your priority, but you will be a much better Dad if you put some importance on your own happiness, too.  4) Your STBX may have more free time and she may not even regret not seeing the kids that much.  But that's her loss.  What I frequently remind myself when my ex-wife is late with a child support check or does something selfish is this:  Would I choose to flip the situation if I had the power?  Would I choose to give her the kids and never (or rarely) see them?  Hell no.  So, every hardship I endure is worth it because I get to kiss them on the forehead each night when they go to bed and I get to hear ""I love you Dad"" every night before I close their bedroom door.  That's a priceless gift and I would not trade it for all of the free time or all of the money in the world.  You're uniquely situated to enjoy the gifts that only your kids can give.  Don't undervalue those gifts because they grow up fast.  5)  It will get better.  You will graduate.  You will get a job and have more money/resources.  Your kids (who I imagine are older if you've been married 20 years) will become more self sufficient and can help you around the house.  Don't rush into dating again, but eventually you will meet someone and the world will be a bit brighter again.  And, when you look back on things 2 or 3 years from now, you can pat yourself on the back for the great house you've built and the kids you're raising to be great men.  Cherish every second; feel empowered.  Happy Father's Day, Dad."

Divorce,3aicaw,WidespreadPhish,3,Sat Jun 20 13:41:53 2015 UTC,"You should get a family law lawyer to advise you.  But, assuming you absolutely can't afford it here are some thoughts:  If it's specifically in the order that the child must live at your ex MIL's house, then you could bring a Motion for Contempt or to enforce (insert title of Order here).  Two potential problems:  1) Some judges hate petty shit like this.  If your ex's boyfriend's house is in a safe neighborhood and has enough room, then what's the real problem?  2) There aren't any monetary damages involved, so it's unclear what sanctions or relief are even on the table.  It's at the discretion of the judge, who has already denied one motion so far.  You have to ask yourself if you're just being petty because you don't like the man your ex is living with now or if you're truly concerned for your daughter.  Divorce is hard enough without fighting over the petty shit.  Let her live her new life and you start planning to live yours.  Eventually, once the divorce is over, you won't have ANY say in where your ex lives or where your kids live when they are in her custody (unless she tries to move more than 100 miles away).  Get used to focusing on YOUR time with the kids, not HERS.  A judge might tell you that exact same thing.  Is this fight really worth it?  Think hard on that."

Unless she can prove its better for the child than staying here it is not happening, you can't take children away from the other parent without damn good reason.    Travel restrictions aren't the same as permanent relocation, if she moves you can get the children back.  Definitely best to get a case entered as soon as you can, that will force the issue."

We were headed for the poor house. So I left.  Since then I have had to pay $18000 in legal fees and $15000 in temp spousal support. Now Im looking at having to pay her $6000 in a settlement and maybe $3500 for her lawyer. Im still not divorced after 2 years. Ive been paying her health insurance during this time too. It all adds up to about $40000. She has done nothing but cause me trouble and use the court as a weapon against me. Im working my ass off at work to scrape by. Shes come after my 401k that I earned before I met her.  There is no common sense. If the judge had 5 min to just look at what was going on she could stop it. But they dont give a fuck.

However she didn't want to share me. Her therapist helped her realize how selfish that was. What I thought was, she just chose being with a man instead of a woman, ya know because being ""bi"" and having both is selfish (at least when you're married IMO).  I just found out yesterday that she was actually identifying as gay to her therapist and the therapist basically told her if she's gay she'll never be happy with a man and divorce would likely ensue.   She chose to ignore this and continue to live a lie hoping she'd just change. We basically stopped all intimacy maybe once a month if I was lucky. I know she loves me, just not the way I need her to.  Sorry for the long response, I'm just now coming to grips with stuff."

I've become friendly with a cool chick close to my age going through the same thing I did who lives close by in the neighborhood I just moved to just by chatting.

The feelings of this divorce have definitely gotten easier. well I don't know if easier is the word more like less frequently occuring. And I have coping mechanisms to deal with them. I'm not focus on it as much. I have responses that I tell myself in order to make the thoughts go away. and I have other things to focus on. the fact that they still are there in my everyday life really sucks. I honestly feel like the hardest part of divorce is realizing that it is so much fucking work to heal. you basically have to change your thought process on a regular basis.  As far as my furbabies I have two dogs that I got from this marriage. They may be wrong that I have them but I do. they are like my children. and since we were planning on having children and getting started on the adoption process before you drop the bomb on me I feel like somewhat fair that I get something. what are Ragdoll cats?
Divorce,3aednh,hakuna_matater,3,Fri Jun 19 13:08:40 2015 UTC,"I dropped a quick note in another comment, but two weeks is too long for the kids to go without the other parent, so make it weekly.  Don't be too sold on the idea of her keeping the house so the kids can stay there. That can set you up to be a subordinate parent, where the kids have their ""real house,"" where they live, and ""Daddy's house,"" where they ""visit."" It also can make your asset division much more complicated and will delay things like you moving on (because, I'm going to guess, you're on the mortgage for the house, so there will be a time after the divorce is final where you're waiting for her to get the loan assumed, if that's possible, or refinanced, which is more common).  I agreed for my ex-wife to keep the house, because we conveniently had assets for her to ""buy out"" my share of its equity, and because it saved a huge amount of conflict on things which were more important to me, and that is a big benefit. Some people think it's valuable for the kids to not have to move, others think (especially if you plan on sharing equal custody and parenting time) it's better to have ""Mommy's house"" and ""Daddy's house"" from the get-go."
Divorce,3aednh,doublenut,2,Fri Jun 19 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"Good luck, try to keep it amicable. When you pick a lawyer look for one that is more about keeping it friendly than a bulldog that wants you to get everything or vice versa...

I'm apprehensive about telling her I'm doing it though   Absolutely be open about it and don't try to sneak it around behind her back because then you're the one that's looking pretty shady. Even before you get a consultation let her know what's going on and what your plan is for having someone double check the paperwork that's being drawn up prior to signing it.  Again if she doesn't like it, that's fine, if she absolutely objects to it then that's reason enough to hire your own lawyer because the divorce is no longer amicable the way you think it is."
Divorce,3aednh,j_dean111,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"This totally makes sense, and I would not do it without discussing it first.  I have a lot to gain by keeping it as amicable as possible."
Divorce,3aednh,GrandEthos,2,Fri Jun 19 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"I can't stress enough that you need to get your own lawyer even if it's amicable.  You may have already heard this but her lawyer DOES NOT WORK FOR YOU and is only looking out for his or her client.  That means even though your STBX is being understanding and flexible with you, there may be things her lawyer puts in the agreement that aren't in your favor.  And you only have your STBX's word to go on.  You and she may not even recognize it, but your lawyer will.  Edit to also say good luck and I hope you don't need the lawyer.  But it's better to pay a little now than have to pay a bunch of court costs to change things later."
Divorce,3aednh,ambitious_flosser,2,Fri Jun 19 23:39:21 2015 UTC,"^ this  No matter what you think you have to gain by keeping it amicable, you have a LOT more to lose by not ""lawyering"" up properly and ensuring you are protected legally.  As someone else said, if it's primarily just for review and to be sure things are fair, there is no reason for her to get upset. If she does, she is definitely trying to get by with something she knows might be easily contested."

You feel like you need a mediator because you don't really know how this all works and it feels overwhelming and you don't know what the next steps will be, and how to ensure nothing bad happens down the line. A mediator won't help you with that: their function is to facilitate you reaching agreement on subjects you disagree with your STBX on: they don't care if it's fair, they don't care if it's a good agreement, they aren't interested in examining things an which you agree. For those things, you need an attorney to help explain the process to you and to draw up an agreement that will be resilient against changing circumstances down the road. You'll need someone to explain what your rights and responsibilities are and hopefully help you avoid a couple of common mistakes (especially, rushing through agreement and agreeing to things which aren't in your interest in an effort to keep things smooth and moving quickly).  Two weeks is too long, make it weekly."

Divorce,3afb0x,Ineffably_Sublime,6,Fri Jun 19 17:41:44 2015 UTC,Stick to the order.  I tried to be flexible with my ex and he ended up trying to walk all over me. At this point I just tell him we have a signed agreement that dictates when we each have custody. Maybe I seem like a bitch to him but it makes everything easier as its all in black and white.
Divorce,3afb0x,LeezardQueen,2,Fri Jun 19 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"I just made the same decision yesterday.  There is an order for a reason,  to avoid arguments, being flexible worked for a bit but he's been really taking advantage and being rude,  so all flex is off. Order is being followed to the T from now on."
Divorce,3afb0x,toasterchild,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:25:31 2015 UTC,"I have considered this, but I'm not sure I'm ready to head down that road.  While my relationship with the ex is strained and hostile we are still communicating and I truly think we both want what is best for the children. E.G. she acquiesced to me taking the children over the 4th.   I'm afraid that by rigidly sticking to only what is in the custody order will wind up worse for the children by removing the (admittedly strained) flexibility we have now.  That beside my concerns about it possibly reflecting poorly on me as a father were the ex to try to sue for full custody."
Divorce,3afb0x,LeezardQueen,4,Fri Jun 19 19:14:21 2015 UTC,"Well I'm only going by my personal experience dealing with my ex.   I tried to be flexible with him but he would not do the same. So now we go by our agreement and that's that.  The main issue is that you're coming up with valid solutions to her problem and still she isn't willing to budge.  In order to really be flexible she should be willing to compromise just as much as you do.  As far as it looking bad on you if you stick to the rules I'm no lawyer but it shouldn't reflect badly on you if you go by the book. That's what it's there for. If it went that far you would also present your case of attempting flexibility with someone who won't reciprocate.  But again I'm no lawyer, and my advice comes from what I've experienced from a volatile ex, not someone who was at least trying (or appearing to attempt to)  Best of luck to you."
Divorce,3afb0x,GrandEthos,2,Fri Jun 19 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"You should stick to what it says, but legally speaking she's required to make the children available to you at the specified times. If you want to be a dick (NOT saying you're a dick) and just not pick them up ever, she has to deal with that as best she can, while your children grow up knowing you're a dick (again - this is an example, NOT saying you're a dick).  I'm stuck in San Antonio for 10 years, so this is all near and dear to me. You'll want to be as flexible as you can (for instance - I should have my son this weekend being Father's Day and all, but my ex decided to schedule a trip to Florida to visit grandpa for this week... and it was entirely not intentional on her part of course...) Now I could be a dick (NOT saying I'm a dick!) and insist she make him available and ruin the trip that my son was excited to go on, or I could just deal with it like a fairly mature and responsible adult (not a dick)."
Divorce,3afb0x,GrandEthos,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I certainly can see both sides of this argument.  But it is nice to know that I have the freedom to be flexible or not.    On a slightly different note, the ex has insinuated that I am not a good father if I don't take them every weekend.  I want time with my children, but every weekend is very difficult when I have a full time job.  The occasional weekend free of the children allows me to get much needed other work taken care of.  If I don't take possession of the children when it is not my ""turn"" would the ex have any legal ground to sue for full custody?"
Divorce,3afb0x,GrandEthos,2,Fri Jun 19 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not you, so I have no idea what you're schedule is like, but I do work full time as well and those things I need weekend time to take care of I get done on my off weekends.  I'm assuming you have possession every other weekend, yes?"
Divorce,3afb0x,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I have been taking them every calendar weekend because she asked me to (excepting a few weekends due to my unavailability or at her request.)  I worry that if I were to drop back to what is in the custody order that it could affect how a judge would view me as a father if the ex was to try to sue for full custody."
Divorce,3afb0x,ruizbujc,2,Fri Jun 19 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"Of course I'm not an attorney, but I don't see how she could use you following the possession order as written against you. Obviously she'll try to manipulate you any way she can, but as long as you're fulfilling your end of the decree, anything you do above and beyond is just that."
Divorce,3afb0x,Daemon42,2,Fri Jun 19 19:48:32 2015 UTC,"The judge would simply see it as you following the custody order. Your Ex can not use you following a court ordered document as proof of your inability as a father. At this point you'd have more of a case to increase your custody time with the children simply because you have been taking them more often than is in the custody order.   Don't take legal Advice from your Ex. Don't take her judgements of your ability in any areas seriously, you're divorced and it was probably for a reason.   Kids are smart they'll figure out pretty quickly what's going on if one parent is constantly putting down another parent, who they love, they'll know who the jerk is."
Divorce,3a9qf4,ironicthrowawayname,15,Thu Jun 18 10:13:37 2015 UTC,"Life is all about ending up in situations we never anticipated.  You say you sometimes wonder how it ended up like this?  That's not true.  You know how.  You just told us.  What you struggle with is why.  That's a very natural, human reaction.  It's also not particularly productive.  Don't get me wrong -- there's a lot of benefit to looking back and figuring out what you could have done differently, what you should have done differently.  It's the only way to avoid making the same mistakes over and over.  But you also need to be able to accept that things are the way they are, and you need to be able to let go of your preconceptions.  Have faith in God, be a Buddhist, be a stoic, whatever, but just learn to accept that when reality collides with the things you want, reality is going to win eleven times out of ten.  So you can either accept reality, find the good in it, appreciate what you have, or you can let the desire for what you don't have consume you.  You and your ex wanted a family with two or three healthy children (I'm assuming).  Life chose to hand you one child with health issues.  Your ex has allowed herself to be consumed by her inability to have what she once wanted.  You've accepted what you have, and where that has led you as to a daughter who you clearly love very much.  Don't waste your time wondering why you're here instead of somewhere else.  Instead, appreciate here."

Unfortunately, I cannot change what once was.  I like to think of Nietzsche's advice on life through the eternal recurrence - imagine that the life you live, you will live over and over again into eternity.  How boring would your life become after reliving just one time if you spent it depressed on what could have been up until your death.  If, however, you removed the concept of bad things in your life with instead novel happenings that have and will color your life, mere brush strokes on the canvas that is the masterpiece of your life if you will, imagine how you could resignify the negative and live with more enthusiasm in the day to day, perhaps even begin to look forward to a recurrence because your life was so full.  Your struggle is an admirable and defining part of your life - think of how you will reflect on it in your twilight; you will be begging God for the chance to experience it just one more time..."

Divorce,3abdvr,Timeisover2015,5,Thu Jun 18 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"You need to be advised by a lawyer, and I'd recommend you not act until you do. The things you're talking about doing may affect things like custody. You have a complicated asset division.   I need to get my kids out of her hands.   This is not going to happen.   One thing I started doing was recording the outbursts she had.  She's never targeted her abusive language towards [the kids]   Unfortunately no one will care about her being mean to you (though I understand it sucks for you personally). Was it legal?   We had about 80k in debt and I paid off all that was in her name.   Do you live in a community property state? You may have shared liability for debt anyway.   I own a Consulting company   This is probably a marital asset.   my wife and I are both employees.   Are you planning to continue to work together? Is it a fake job or is it reasonable to think she or you would be able to find similar income elsewhere? Again, this is a complication a lawyer can advise you about.   Should I do it when her parents are with her?   I'm not sure why this would be a good idea.   Should I leave them with her?   You lawyer will be able to better advise you, but you should not move out until you have an agreed-upon parenting plan in place that ensures you aren't leaving your kids behind."
Divorce,3abdvr,doublenut,2,Thu Jun 18 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"I would tell her without anyone else there. She'll no doubt need support from her parents, but the event itself is private. I imagine I would have been embarrassed, mortified, whatever else if my parents had been there. Offer to take the kids, but if you think they're safe with her don't push it if she wants to keep them. That kind of stress would make me just want to be alone, but on the other hand the first weekend I set up with my son was a very welcome departure from my mood at the time of my separation.  Otherwise I dunno what to tell you about the employment thing. That's a question for your attorney."
Divorce,3abdvr,GrandEthos,2,Thu Jun 18 19:21:21 2015 UTC,"OK, you're in for a roller coster. Get a lawyer and follow their lead.  Emotional abuse is not recognized as a deal breaker in custody. Leaving the marital house is though. You have to stay in the house until you're legally separated/divorce. If you leave, you're toast. Expect her family to turn on you.   It's foolish  to pay only her debts. You should have paid yours first. The minute you file, she is going to demand child support, spousal support, and 1/2 of you assets. Thus, you'll not have enough to pay your debts.   Protect yourself. Get a lawyer."
Divorce,3abdvr,fatheroftwoboys,2,Thu Jun 18 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"Don't tell her until you've met with your lawyer. Also do not tell her family in advance, no matter how much you think you can trust them now. Blood is thicker and all that.   Re choosing a lawyer, obviously ensure they have experience specifically in divorce law. Some plonk divorce law on their list of expertise, but make sure it's their specialty and they've been practising a good while. Check them out online or via their Law Societies. Whoever recommended them, find out what the outcomes of their cases were. Some attorneys may allow a general chat over the phone initially where you can get a feel for them. Good luck."
Divorce,3abdvr,tinywombat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:14:32 2015 UTC,"Before you take this drastic step, I strongly recommend that you consult an attorney to get a realistic picture of what is about to happen.  I would recommend that both of you seek counseling and therapy.  Couples counseling with each other, and individual therapy for yourselves.  You're NOT going to get custody of your kids away from her.  Won't happen, forget about it.  You have no proof of any kind of abuse, and the court won't care that you're tired of her being mean to you.  Best interests of the children trump your bruised feelings.  Reality.    Your best choice right now is to do whatever it takes to get your wife help, and heal your marriage.  THAT is what is best for your kids.  Plus, you don't have a chance of getting the outcome you want right now because you have no documentation.  At least with the counseling path, you can hope to assemble some data in the event she refuses to participate in the process."
Divorce,3abdvr,LaTuFu,-4,Fri Jun 19 11:40:12 2015 UTC,Part of me wants to say can you just hang in the for the kids? The other part of me can relate to having been with someone who's mental.  The problem is the kids will likely be with her part time so will the kids really get relief from your separating?  Can you take the kids with you or suggest she leave and get her own place? She's probably going to want the kids half time for the child support.  I don't know how you work things up there.  If you can send her on her way alone with a weekly alimony or child support check that would be best.  But get it all in writing whatever it is you agree on.  You want the kids with you.  You don't want her subjecting your kids to strangers in her home.

Divorce,3aaljj,LaTuFu,2,Thu Jun 18 15:48:23 2015 UTC,"If this is going to work, then both of you have to be willing to commit to the process 100% and not have any outside influences.  In your next counseling session, it is entirely appropriate for you to confront her (calmly) with the emotional affair by asking her to commit to ending the relationship and all contact while the two of you are working things out.  As long as the affair remains in the picture, she's going to suffer from ""the affair fog"" (google it and read about it) and not have any interest in taking the counseling sessions seriously.  DO NOT accuse her of the affair if she has not admitted it to you.  Simply say in front of the counselor, ""I'm concerned that there may be an inappropriate relationship that is impacting our marriage right now.  If that is the case, I'd like to ask that the relationship be terminated and there be no further contact of any kind while we're working this out.  Is that something you're willing to do?""  Make your marriage and your wife a priority over anything else in your life.  Building friendship again requires you to:   Forgive the past.  It doesn't mean forget, but it does mean you stop keeping score.   Acknowledging your role in the failure of the marriage.  Were you too controlling?  Insecure? Passive aggressive? Detached? Focused more on career than marriage?  Anger issues?  Drugs or alcohol?  Whatever it is, you have to own that baggage and start working on it. Be yourself.  Just talk to her.  Talk about her day.  What happened at work?  What happened on her favorite TV show?  How are her parents doing?  Just have conversation, and leave out the ""why can't we make this work?"" awkward questions for now.  Let her ask those questions later. Realize that it took you 11 years to get to this place, its going to take more than 4 weeks to get out of here.  This process is going to take time."

The counselor did ask her to focus on us and leave the other relationship alone while we're working it out.  I have begun to forgive. Introspection has shown me that I have been neglecting her emotions for some time. Even though she knows I love her, she needs to hear it and feel it. That neglect led her to get those feelings elsewhere.  I have been insecure, passive aggressive...I'm sure if that. I recently got a promotion that eats up more time.   Her biggest complaint over the last week is that instead of giving her the space she wants, I'm trying too hard to do ""the little things"" and asking her how we're doing? Or what she's thinking?  I haven't been a bad husband, I've just been too comfortable. Missing the subtle hints and ignoring the more serious warning signs. This wake up hit me like a ton of bricks, so my natural response is to fix it as fast as possible. I can definitely see that 11 years of me being too comfortable has led to her putting up so many barriers that 4 weeks won't fix. I'm trying to slow things down."

Your situation might be new to you, but its a lot more common than you think.  The good news for you is, that means you can fix this if you are willing to do the work.  Good to hear the counselor confronted that.  Did she agree to that?  Good to hear that you're owning your baggage.  That's the first step.  You can't go from fully disengaged to smothering her like a wet blanket.  It doesn't work like that.  Just talk to her, don't ask her how things are going or what she's thinking.  Engage in small talk conversation and let it build from there.  Make the focus of the conversation about her and what she likes, not you or the relationship or what the two of you are struggling with.  Does she have a my little pony collection she's fanatical about?  Become an expert in MLP collections so you can have a conversation with her.  Did the two of you enjoy cooking together when you were dating?  Hiking together? Kayaking?  Find that thing that was ""just us"" back then, and go do it.  Then just let the conversation flow from there.    Take her to dinner at least once a week without the kids.    Keep the conversation light and normal.  Nothing heavy about ""what is our future looking like?"" or ""I don't want to lose you.""  She wants to know that you care about her and that you're willing to give her affection and attention.

Divorce,3abnbi,littleorangemonkeys,2,Thu Jun 18 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"Legal separation (at least in Indiana, see a lawyer) starts the process of dividing up the assets and debts, places a lot of controls on both spouses.  This is a very complicated question and because of the separate state situation, it may become a race to file.  There might be an advantage to file in your state verses waiting for your spouse to file in their state; then again it may be better for you to have your spouse file in his state.  Oh, the other thing is that legal separation is not something that is done in all states, I do not know what would happen if someone files for legal separation in one state, while their spouse files for divorce in the other state.  I know that in Indiana that once a spouse files for legal separation, the other spouse can file for divorce at any time.  Not sure what would happen if the other spouse does not have legal residence that is required to file for divorce.  good luck"
Divorce,3abnbi,albertnacht,2,Thu Jun 18 21:14:24 2015 UTC,Assuming your state has it the biggest advantage is that if he racks up a lot of debt you won't get to have half of it should it lead to divorce. So basically it gives you financial protections and for the most part sets up the division of assets so that if a divorce happens it's pretty simple to move forward.   So it depends on how much you trust each other to be responsible when it comes to finances. If you trust each other and there hasn't been an issue of excessive spending or debt in the marriage then it may not be worth it.
Divorce,3abnbi,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:29:25 2015 UTC,It depends on your state.  Some states don't even have that designation in the process.  They just make you wait an allotted amount of time before you can file.
Divorce,3abnbi,LaTuFu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:42:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies.   The debt we have is each in our own names, none of it is shared.  For instance, we both have school loan debt that we had before we got married.  Our credit card debt is all personal, as in we aren't even authorized users on each other's credit cards.  We haven't co-signed on each other's vehicle titles.  I do trust him not to rack up debt under my name...that's the one thing I trust him on is not to mess with money like that.  So I think we may be fine to just stay as we are until we file.  I appreciate everyone's feedback!"
Divorce,3aaa3n,hoully81,4,Thu Jun 18 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"My personal philosophy is that if it has to do with our child, the divorce virtually never happened. It was an ugly one, too, where we dated each other's friends and trash talked each other and undermined each other, etc. But when it comes to our little one, we are partners. Period. We discuss. We share. We delight in the successes together and mourn the failures together. We tell each other when something funny happens. When our son is bit ill or sad, seemingly meaningless bits of information my ex has shared with me can fill in the gaps and I can more easily figure out what's wrong.   As a result, I know how he got that little scrape on his toe. My ex knows if he's had enough junk food for the week. We each know what he is and isn't capable of and we both know who he does and doesn't get along with at school- and why. And our son can't pull the wool over either of our eyes.     Our son doesn't feel insecure; he has as solid a family unit as he ever had. Our constant open communication about him is good. It's good for everyone. The conversation does not stray into other topics and we don't fight.      Personally, when it comes to your kids, I think you should cooperate and communicate as much as your ex wants and then some."

The courts do not give much weight at all to ""she said, he said"" documentation, and they will practically disregard the concerns of any parent if there is no documentation.

They likely talk smack about you often and in a situation like you describe they will all happily paint you in a bad light because the person they ""like"" will do better as a result.   I dunno about custody with adopted children, but I hope it is the same as biological ones.  So you should get 1/2 custody.  Also you should get 1/2 the assets (i.e. the house).  So even if she forced you out the house still is ""yours"" as well.  I would suggest you spend your time with your son alone (i.e. not with your wife around).  Limit physical contact with her as much as possible and try to sanitize things down to email communication.  That will basically knee cap her efforts to make you look bad."
Divorce,3aabv2,cornelius_t,2,Thu Jun 18 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"OK, read on family law and living post divorce. California is not a bad place to divorce, but it's not the best.   I'm not a lawyer, but I think you can expect the following:  •Parenting time will be split 50-50 with equal rights for each parent... I do believe this is standard for California  • Spousal support should  be calculated based on the State calculator using you income  and ""impute"" her income at minimum wage. It will last for 1/2 the duration of your marriage (about 4 or 5 years).   •Child support, calculate using state calculator. It will last until child is out of High School or 18. Again, impute her wages at minimum wage.   • try to add a geographic restriction for your child to stay in the same city or metropolitan area  Think about what you're doing. Divorce sucks! Before you do the above, go talk to both a personal and couple therapist."
Divorce,3aabv2,fatheroftwoboys,2,Thu Jun 18 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"Well without the details of knowing why you want out my first suggestion is to see a marriage counselor together to try working on the issues in the marriage before calling it quits. This goes doubly so since there's a child involved.  Even seeing a personal therapist would be a huge benefit to you in figuring out what you actually want in life.   Unless there's an issue with addiction or abuse you really should talk to your wife about the fact that you're having issues with the marriage, which means counseling since most issues can be much more easily resolved with a neutral third party. Honestly you owe it to your child to give all your effort to saving the relationship before calling it quits, I'm not saying to stay together for the child only that you should try everything you possibly can first.   Otherwise most lawyers will give a free 1 hour consultation, they could answer most of the questions you have concerning the legal aspects of divorce as well as what you're looking at for child custody and support payments. Depending on how long she's been a stay at home mom you may end up paying alimony and unless you somehow get 100% custody of your child you'll be paying child support.   The scariest/worst part for me was/is loosing 50% of my daughters time, it's true that I wouldn't have spent all that time with her but those 5 day stretches without seeing her get really hard sometimes. Worrying about money is next. But thanks to a great therapist I don't worry or get as anxious about that as I used to. I'm lucky that the divorce is amicable, you may not be so lucky if you ambush your wife with it."

Divorce,3aabv2,doublenut,2,Thu Jun 18 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't have sources because I didn't organize my search this way, but do what research you can about the effect of divorce on children, especially with regard to age ranges. One good source of information was an online post-divorce parenting class I was required to take: most of it was thuddingly obvious, or should be (don't put your children in the middle, don't badmouth the other parent, don't make them relay messages) but there was good information and some surprises, like how common it is for children of divorce to develop asthma directly after a divorce (one of mine did), how universally difficult it is to be a step-parent (they frequently face a lot of rejection and far a long time).  Anyway, part of the training was describing the impact of divorce on children of various age ranges, and toddler-age and teenagers are extremely impacted. If there is a ""good"" age for children for a divorce (and, spoiler alert: there isn't), it's probably in the pre-teen years when kids have enough self-awareness to be able to think their way through negative feelings and not just express them. My divorce happened just about ""perfectly"", in the sense that I and my ex make effective co-parents and do everything right and don't try to screw with each other over the kids; and they're absolutely and unambiguously better off now that if we hadn't divorced. But they still had ""complications"" for the first year and engaged in some testing behavior.  Age of my kids influenced me a lot because I was doing everything I could to act in their best interest: when I stayed, it was for their benefit, and when I left, it was also for their benefit.  I don't know what sex your toddler is but girls face a drastically increased risk of sexual abuse (PDF) after divorce, and boys don't seem to. Some of this is due to new partners/stepfathers, but apparently not all.  You should consult with an attorney before getting divorced, so you understand the process, your rights and responsibilities and likely outcomes.  To be honest, in your position unless something dangerous was going on I would not consider divorce. There are practical difficulties in splitting custody of a toddler and they will feel the effects of the split without cognitive tools to handle them. Your stay-at-home wife will be presumed to be the child's primary caretaker and her argument for custody will be strong. Instead, I would wait until he or she was school-age, at least, and try to encourage your wife to develop a career or the ability to work at that point. This isn't a cynical attempt to avoid paying alimony--by waiting, you extend the likely term of it from 3 years to 5 or 6; but to put you both in the best possible position to be whole, effective people with a practical lifestyle that can most effectively share co-parenting responsibility.  In the meantime, be a great dad, and work on your marriage. A lot of people whose marriages suffer from ""incompatibility"" have a fixed expectation of what marriage was going to be, or should be, like. It can be healthy to shed those expectations and realize that there's a marriage that works for you, even if you have more separate lives than you thought you would or you have to give in on certain things. Divorce is shitty. I believe sometimes it's the least shitty option but it's not ""good"" and in most cases probably not something to reach for due to ""incompatibility"", ""growing apart"" or a vague sense of dissatisfaction with life."

Divorce,3aabv2,LaTuFu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"Without any details of your circumstances, the only advice we can give you is contact a lawyer.  You have a child involved, so a lawyer is a must.  My understanding from some CA family lawyers is the court system is a mess in Cali thanks to the budget, so expect it to take a long time, and not always work out the way you would hope.  I would strongly urge you to consider counseling and therapy for both of you first.   If your wife has no idea this is coming, then I suspect that both of you need to work on communication and conflict resolution.    I would definitely not suggest that you blindside your wife with ""Hi, I want a divorce"" when you finally decide you're ready.  If you can't tell her that you're struggling with the marriage now, then that's a you problem, not a her problem.  Putting that aside, though, blindsiding her is a great way to guarantee that she is as hostile and combative as possible to you during the separation and divorce process.  Given what little details you wrote, here's what you should expect from the CA system:  best case scenario, you're getting 50/50 custody and a child support payment based on that schedule.  Expect to pay alimony for 3.5-4 years.  House and retirement will be divided evenly, unless you can prove that you brought in any specific assets prior to the marriage.  Worst case, she gets full custody, you get every other weekend, and your child support obligation will reflect that.  paging /u/saricher"

Divorce,3aabv2,anderson_buck,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"California Family law attorney here.  Once upon a time, a man had had enough with playing the Knight In Shining Armor.  He had married a woman who, at the time, was a single Mom on welfare.  She stayed home to care for her child while he supported both.  He began to realize that perhaps the marriage was a mistake but before he could do anything, she became pregnant with his child.  So he stayed and let fester his feelings, while she stayed at home with the children.  When he could not take it any longer, he asked her for a divorce.  Her immediate response was, ""How dare you ruin my life.""  And thereafter accused him of sexually abusing their then 5-year-old child, which got the child welfare authorities and the police involved.  That could be the scariest part of the process.  /u/LaTuFu gave you a reasonable description of the California system.  But I am going to guess you may have some other issues:   I have absolutely no animus towards my spouse nor anyone in her family, her friends or associates. It just took a Helluva long time for me to realize that we are completely incompatible (personality-wise, and culturally).   Let me do the math - married since 2008 (7 years) but she has only been a California resident for 5 years.  Is it safe for me to assume that your wife is either a naturalized citizen or holds a green card?  If so, you might want to investigate whether her country of origin to a signer to the Hague Convention as it concerns child custody.  Why?  Because if that is not the case, what will prevent her from leaving with the child as soon as you say, ""I want a divorce?""  You may not bear any animus towards her family and associates . . . but they may towards you out of loyalty towards her.  I am not saying this WILL happen, but as an attorney I look for areas of risk and liabilities, and when I see you say you are not compatible ""culturally,"" that can be a red flag in custody issues.  So disappearing with your child could also be the scariest part.  As to property, I am also assuming you brought some significant assets to the marriage, so a question I would have as a lawyer is how title is now held to those assets, i.e., did you ""transmute"" any from separate property to community property?  And for spousal support, you have a short-term marriage (the law presumes any longer than 10 years to be a long-term marriage) but a caveat: the policy of the State of California is that a supported spouse will become self-supporting within a reasonable time.  Again, based on my assumptions above, which may well be wrong, does she have an adequate education and/or grasp of English to obtain gainful employment?  While the ""half-the-lifetime-of-the-marriage"" is a rule of thumb, it remains just that: a rule of thumb.  And the court could extend your palm to perhaps pay her a longer time so that she can obtain training.  BTW, if you want to know the rest of the story started above . . .  It was shown in court she was a lying POS and Father was awarded sole legal and physical custody.  And he and the boy haven't heard from her since.  I love a happy ending, don't you?"

Divorce,3aa2pu,curious_woman,6,Thu Jun 18 12:42:14 2015 UTC,"(Looks around for /u/GrandEthos)  I'll be the one to say ""you're not ready yet.""  This is an often discussed topic in here, and there are many who say ""no big deal.""  I've been down that road, and it really is a much bigger deal than we want to think.  I made a lot of mistakes in my healing journey, and this is one of them that I have the biggest regrets over.  Whether we want to admit it or not, when we divorce there is an emotional death/traumatic event that we have to deal with.  You need time to heal from the divorce.  Part of the healing is dealing with the intense loneliness.  It is actually a normal part of the grieving process.    When someone's spouse dies in a car accident or from a disease, nobody blinks an eye when they take a couple of years to mourn and get over the loss of their spouse.    The only difference in healing between a divorce and the death of a spouse is the spouse is alive in the divorce.  So there is some emotional anguish involved (especially in cases where infidelity or high conflict are present) because your body is confused about suddenly having to treat this person you were bonded to as an adversary.  I understand the intense loneliness.  I do.  I was there, I remember that feeling well.  Its normal, and it should be there.  But it would be the best thing, at least for right now, to allow it to happen, and have that process take its course.    The way to combat the loneliness in a healthy way is to get yourself involved in group activities.  The worst thing you can do right now is allow yourself to isolate.  Ice Cream and binge Netflix is not a good choice.  Volunteer in a church mission of your choice, a homeless shelter, animal shelter, or other organization.  Find outdoor activity groups that you enjoy on meetup.  Hiking, ultimate frisbee, kickball, whatever.  Avoid activities that are predominantly men.    The trap you're going to fall into, if you go down this path, is right now you're saying ""no way boyfriend, just casual convo.""  But after 2-3 dates with a nice guy who treats you well, your mind is going to start convincing you that it will be okay to go just a little further.  Then it gets a little more serious.  Then your mind says ""its okay to go just a little further."" And the slippery slope begins.  You're into a place you swore you didn't want to go before you know it.  I'm not saying you can't date anyone for a few years.  Who knows, it might take that long, every person is different.  But it is definitely not a good idea when you're grieving and your mind is obsessed with the thought of ""casual conversation/dating.""  In fact, one of the first signs that you might be healthy enough to consider some casual dating is when you are no longer obsessed with the idea on a daily/hourly basis."

My sincerest apologies if I made you feel bad.  Bravo to you for all of the activities that you're involved in!    It sounds like you're doing a lot of the right things to help yourself through the process.  The small part of you that is feeling like it is harmless is also a normal part of the process.  Try to ignore that part of you for now.  Like I said, you'll know when you're ready to date again when there is no longer any part of you that is wanting to do it."

I do it all.   If this is the case, then I would absolutely heed /u/LaTuFu's warnings.  I think everyone's situations are different, and there are people who can date right after being separated withou a problem or repercussions. I did. But by the time we separated, the relationship was long over; like, I mean, for years.

If you just stopped wearing your ring a month ago I would say you probably aren't even really ready to date casually.   Personally I waited until my divorce was final before going on any dates.  I started talking to folk a few weeks before it was final, but no actual dates.  Even now I'm not ready for a serious relationship and all of my dating is casual.  Ready the biggest question about dating for you right now isn't how vulnerable you are, but how desperate for attachment are you.  Are you going to end up leaping into a relationship because you are lonely?  But if you can keep that separate and have sex as a casual thing. You might be OK. Keep in mind that you dating, even casually, might have effects upon your divorce process that aren't good."
Divorce,3aa2pu,Altruizzy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"I think casually dating is good. I went on casual dates while I was going through my divorce, and it helped with the loneliness.

This is along with me getting really fit, taking up yoga, hiking alone, making new friends, going to MeetUps, etc.  I've been able to keep it casual thus far and have only gone on 3 second dates and 1 3rd.  I'm not really scared of falling into some long-term relationship with someone although I know it can happen.  I've had my feelings hurt a couple times, but I'm sure I hurt a few too... Just is the way of dating.  What slowed me down though recently was the more risky behavior I started doing.  I realized I've got a lot to offer and I'm going to have less to offer if I get some STD that won't ever go away.  Anyway.. The going on a lot of first dates thing is a lot of fun!  You'll probably get tired of it after a while though.   I don't know.. Honestly I saw it as part of the process, I learned a lot about myself and got to meet some interesting people.  Good luck!"

My ex rarely told me that I was beautiful or anything and all of a sudden I started hearing it all of the time.  It was nice.  I started seeing someone casually, but I made it absolutely clear that it had to be casual and we had to be honest about what the other person wanted.  We're more friends now than anything, but its always nice to have someone to grab drinks with and talk towhen youre feeling lonely.  I threw myself into my social life and renewed friendships that I had neglected and as a result became a better friend and thats fulfilling for now.  I dont think there is anything wrong with going on a date or two as long as you are completely honest with what you want out of it.  Its easy to fall into that trap that /u/LaTuFu talked about.  So easy.  Be careful with your heart and hang in there.  The world is your oyster!"

I think you'll fall into the old patterns from before, and she'll leave again the moment she's not feeling weak/nostalgic/satisfied again.

Divorce is like taking a glass bottle and snapping it in half, then the sharp edges get covered in blood in the divorce or what have you.  Now... you can't put the bottle back together again. You can try, some of the edges match up a bit, but others are ground down or missing or maybe there's extra material now. You can try really hard and use superglue and duct tape and all that, but the two halves will never fit together the way they did.  If you think you can be happy dealing with uneven edges and just kind of pushing things together for the sake of nostalgia, go for it.  Otherwise... no. Go melt yourself down and find a new bottle."

Quite honestly - I would never feel ""safe"" in a relationship like that. The potential for her to cut and run if things feel uncomfortable is too high.   I know you said you don't love the woman you're with now, but that could change or you could find love with someone else. You're still to tied up in your ex, though, and if you hold everyone up to that relationship you're dooming yourself to failure before you even start.  Personally, if it were me - I'd go no contact with the ex and start fresh. You can find love again."

I would want more than anything right now to have her running back into my arms and ask for forgiveness. But I'm very slowly coming to terms that is just a dream and me clinging onto the past.  Good luck with whatever you're going through and know that you're not alone through all of this. I've been leaning pretty hard on friends and seeking new activities to get her out of my head.   I agree with many of the comments here, but if you do decided to reconcile take it extremely slow and make sure its not just a quick reaction and that this course is best for both of you. A one sided relationship doesn't exist for long. A couple of years down the road it would be much worse if there are kids involved."

Divorce,3a7bru,freebase1ca,3,Thu Jun 18 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of red flags waving here, but I'm not necessarily ready to say ""don't do it.""  I definitely don't think you should just take her back, no questions asked.    Is there anything wrong with trying to date again?  Returning to counseling?  Not at all, if that is what you think you want to do.  Just make sure you realize that this is something that needs to take a lot of time.  i.e. probably at least a year of dating and counseling before you should consider moving back in together.  You need to date her to establish trust, and time is your friend in this situation.  If she's using you because she's alone again and just doesn't like being alone, you'll find out long before the year is over.  If she was really seeing someone all along, that will come out at some point during the year.  Eventually, the true colors will reveal, if you take your time and allow it to happen without taking her back 100%.  At that point, you'll know if you want to move forward.  Edit:  All of my suggestions are under the assumption that she truly did not know what she wanted, and never dated someone else during the times she wanted to break things off.  If she has been hiding an affair and is just desperately lonely, then I would not suggest considering any kind of reconciliation until she's been through individual therapy for at least a year.  Even then, I'm not sure I could suggest risking it.  Last but not least, you need to stop dating the other woman.  You're clearly not ready to date anyone yet."

Divorce sucks at any age, but doing it at the end of peak earning years is even worse for the people involved.    They would both be better served to try to resolve their differences and continue to be together.  If that isn't possible, my advice to you is stay out of the middle of it as much as possible.    And for sure do not get sucked into supporting your Mom financially.  Sure, 60 isn't 40, but she's still capable of working and supporting herself.

What you are saying is really textbook, sorry if that offends you but its true. I suggest going to one of your Staff NCOs as I'm sure one of them has been in the exact same situation as you.

The self help center will tell you how to fill out the paperwork but they will not tell you what to write down unless it's something clear cut (like what your name is type clear cut.) any referrals you get for legal advice will explain in more detail and they will offer you opinions but they will not make promises for how it goes and they will not represent you.   I did about half my divorce on my own but mine was particularly nasty, complicated and contentious and I finally gave in and got myself a lawyer I paid money to. If things between you and your husband are copacetic and he isn't going to try and stick you with debt or ask for support or anything then it should all be just fine and a matter of signatures and a stamp from the judge. If he decides he wants support, or he wants assets or wants to stick you with more debt that you're willing to take, or his legal fees or just wants to contest the divorce in general to be a dick, then you'll be back and forth a lot.

It is a very difficult thing to live with for both parties, it is worse when there are kids around. You need to take care of yourself and do what you all ready know is the right thing and leave, at this point right now you don't have any other option. I'm glad that he is getting help I have met too many fellow vets that won't and are suffering greatly because of it.

Sometimes physical separation for safety is the best course of action.  Whether or not that should require a divorce is a question you can answer later on.

A biological father has the right to use an appropriate dose of discipline. Your husband, I don't know, I don't think it's right. I don't think it's right for step parents to spank other's people's kids. You should be a single parent. Finish what you started.

Divorce,3a202d,user183745,18,Tue Jun 16 16:40:14 2015 UTC,It isn't defamation because it is factual.  And a public records besides.   She would have to show cause to change the custody agreement at this point and I'm assuming there is language settling the status of the retirement accounts in your decree.   Basically this falls under rule #1 don't take legal advice from your ex.
Divorce,3a202d,Catcherofsouls,7,Tue Jun 16 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"Changing your Facebook relationship to Divorced is not defamation of character or illegal. That being said the post about it probably wasn't necessary. It's easy enough to tell family and friends what happened without having to do it through facebook. But what's done is done so no real point in worrying about it now. Who cares what they think, stick to communication about the kids, no more, no less.   The divorce is final she can't change the terms of it.   A facebook post will make a judge and her lawyer laugh her out of court if she tries to modify a custody agreement based on it.   In summary:   ""Not your Circus, Not your Monkeys."" -Some Mod."
Divorce,3a202d,Slowlyloosinghope,5,Tue Jun 16 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"First let's get this out of the way:  You absolutely did not commit defamation of character.  Among other things, you did it via social media, so it would be libel, not defamation.  That split hair aside, you still didn't do anything wrong because libel constitutes ""a method of defamation expressed by print, writing, pictures, signs, effigies, or any communication embodied in physical form that is injurious to a person's reputation, exposes a person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or injures a person in his/her business or profession.""  While they might try to claim you exposed her to ridicule or injured her profession, you didn't defame her.  It is a fact that you divorced.  No false statements have been made.  And it is a matter of public record for anyone curious enough to take a trip down to your county courthouse.  All that being said...the rest of your questions are why you needed a lawyer to help you.  The biggest myth that occurs (over, and over, and over) in this sub is that all lawyers are expensive and will make the divorce process combative, emotionally and financially draining.  The fact is, you're the client, so you control the process.  The lawyer is simply there to carry out your instructions.  Why would a lawyer have been helpful?  For one thing, your attorney would have made sure that the property settlement that was signed contained a neat little waiver phrase (hopefully you at least downloaded a boilerplate document that was helpful enough to have this) that said something to the effect of ""each party agrees to permanently waive any and all rights/claims to the other's retirement accounts"" or language to that effect.  Because a spouse with custody of minor children can take you back to court for additional support until the children are 18-22.  A lawyer that knows what he's doing will make sure all of the unnecessary loopholes are closed.  My gut feeling, however, is that this will all go away shortly.  They're upset that you ""outed"" her, but I doubt they'll want to go to court to seek revenge.  They didn't want this out there before, they'll most likely want it under the rug again as fast as possible."

How's the wife?"" and then me explaining that we split up, but it's fine, and then them fumbling for words to cover their gaffe, and awkwardness all around.   It IS worth mentioning to cover other people's feelings.   I hated making people feel like they messed up by asking, when it really was fine, so I found ways to spread the news without doing something tacky.   On the other question, it's YOUR divorce, and YOUR status as a divorcee, and you may share it with whomever you wish.  It's not HER news to share. You own the status, you control the distribution."

With the divorce decree final can she now decide she wants to change the terms of the divorce and go after my retirement and full custody?   If your divorce was finalized in court then she can't go after your retirement unless there is something specific in your agreement that allows her to do so.  As far as custody, unless there is a significant change in circumstance or you've somehow become an unfit parent, then there's not much she can do there either. But...she could take you to court before she finds all this out from a judge. Hopefully any lawyer she went to would tell her she doesn't have a case."

Even if you went into the reasons for the divorce, as long as you don't knowingly or recklessly say false things to disparage her character, you are okay.   Socially, I think you handled it well. It's polite in this day and age to let your circle of acquaintances use social media to know basic things about your living status so they don't feel embarrassed should you happen to have a conversation. This is public information, similar to disclosing where you work or what city you live in. Anyone who wants to know the details can contact you directly, as it should be.   On my Facebook account, I changed it to separated after we had lived apart for years, but the divorce was not yet final. I made sure that the change was only on the ""About"" page should someone search for it, and did not show up as a status change in the news feed. After the divorce was final, I changed it to blank in the same way. This way, someone who was wondering could find out without feeling gauche about it, while I'm not just broadcasting our business to the world.

Divorce,3a2poj,onwardnow,2,Tue Jun 16 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with TheEarlShibe - he is totally using you.  I mean, look at everything you spelled out that you're doing for him.  What are you getting out of the relationship?  He may need you but do you need him?  Is there reciprocal feelings/respect and is he doing things for you too?  Now that being said, does he know that you think card giving is a thoughtful gesture?  I know with my ex-, we never gave each other cards because we always thought it was tacky, especially for holidays that were obligations.  But that was us.  If you've voiced your dissatisfaction and your expectations and he ignores them, that's one thing.  But maybe he's clueless and doesn't know how much it hurts when he hasn't done anything for you (different expectations).    Even so, him not showing any interest in your kids while it seems like you're going above & beyond for his is a serious red flag.  Of course he doesn't want you to leave him, look at all the ""benefits"" he's getting.  I would have a serious talk with him to voice your concerns and see what he says and does.  If he doesn't change or willing to change, best to go your separate ways.    And yes, DON'T SETTLE.  Why should you??  There are plenty of people out there, find someone who is comfortable with themselves and is willing to give back to you too.  Don't feel like you HAVE to be with someone.  Be comfortable with yourself first.  Having someone that you're compatible with is just icing on the cake."

Divorce,3a2poj,abloodyminge,5,Tue Jun 16 23:39:30 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but I'm starting to believe /u/LaTuFu's ideas on waiting.  I don't think people can always keep their distance and just casually date.  I also think there are likely scars you carry over from previous relationships that aren't normal.  For example, you are saying you really would be happy with a $0.99 card for your birthday.. if you go any lower on the standards it would be horrible (hence your post).  But really the bar should be a nice dinner, intimate conversation, a thoughtful (or expensive depending on the type of person you are) present.    Here is more of the mess you get when involving yourself too soon.  The guy is going to be dealing with some rejection issues.  He's going to be more prone to be self centered to his needs vs yours.  But he's also going to be more needy when it comes time to leave.  You have kids involved as well, so leaving is going to suck even more for you.  If you understand the ""handicaps"" involved, it seems more reasonable to give this more of a shot...   You can try and give him a ""I need much more here"" and see if he responds.  But if you go that route I'd recommend also warning that the reminder is not something that should need to be repeated as well.  He needs a wake the heck up and see how I'm pissing this relationship away call (if you stay).  You seem like a very nice person.  You care about people in your life.  The thing that sucks is when others give marginal or non existent returns on this affection it can wear you thin.  I understand you aren't doing it for the return favor, but everyone deserves to have someone care for them - not be taken for granted.    Also this community has people who were in some type of negative relationship and have found their lives better by extracting the sinkhole of a partner from their relationship.    I just killed my 2nd marriage.  It sucks.  I think I could say I had very reasonable justification for ending both, but I also wish it was possible to work things out in either case.  Once it was clear that wasn't possible, I cut the strings.    My honest advice to you is to raise your standards to something you think is acceptable, not a minimum.  Communicate this to your boyfriend.  If it's not always 100% that is ok, but be clear that the expectation is not a minimum standard.   You deserve more than the minimum.  If he can't deal with that and you try, cut him loose.  If he an but only do 50% of that (and complains you are too demanding) cut him loose.  If he can meet it and this acts as a wake up call, you'll have a quality relationship where you've established better communication and respect for each other.  Yay!  tl;dr Hell no, but give the opportunity to improve.  Make it as plain as day to him.  If he fails to improve you can walk away without any doubt that it was the right choice for you."

Divorce,3a2poj,LaTuFu,2,Tue Jun 16 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"You gotta try lowering your standards once or twice before you realize the point of dating isn't too keep it going as long as you can,  that's your marriage mind working.  The point of dating is to get to the ""no"" as fast as you can.  So you can move on and focus your energy on the next real potential.   That is why is best to avoid bringing kids in for months,  because your goal is to find the deal breakers as fast as you can and move on. Best way to practice saying the no is to drop the turd you've dated easy too long.   Next time don't get attached to the kids,  and avoid letting the kids meet for a really long time to avoid issues.  My kid didn't meet my boyfriend's kid of the same age for 9 months.  Just a short meet then too. This guy would be ready to dump if you'd followed some rules.   It takes practice and good boundary setting,  you will get there."

That being said you are not his kids mother and shouldn't expect recognition on mother's day.   If you expected him to help your son get a card for you did you ask him to do it?   But in the final analysis of he's treating you like this at 5 months what is 5 years going to look like?

The ""rules of dating"" we suggest for people going through a divorce: it's a really good idea not to date anyone for the first 1-3 years after you separate and divorce, also apply to potential dates.  In other words, if you're on the other side and starting to feel like a relationship is something you can handle, hold your potential dates to the same standard.  Everything you're describing about your relationship does not surprise me one bit.  He's barely a year out of his divorce, he's not ready to date yet.  End this and move on with your life.  Spend some more time single until you have enough confidence in yourself that you won't compromise yourself again in the future."

Divorce,3a2poj,GrandEthos,0,Tue Jun 16 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"It's not as unrealistic as you might think.  In my experience in working with people going through a divorce, it takes a really long time to work through the emotional aspects of healing.  There is no hard and fast number, every situation is different.  One person may only need a year, someone else in the same circumstances might need 5 or more.  A lot of professional counselors who specialize in divorce say the healing is a long term process.  The rule of thumb I often use actually comes from a divorce counselor I know.  6-12 months of healing for every 2-4 years of marriage.  I added ""plus 1 year if there was 1 or more years of cohabitation"" from some of the experience I've had with people.  But in this sub I have shorthanded it to a much simpler ""1-3 years"" for most discussions in here.  Like I said, its not carved in stone, it is just a guideline.  If that formula says your situation should require 4 years of healing and you only needed 2, that doesn't mean you did something wrong.  It's just a guidepost.  The one thing that does tend to be constant in this, however, is nobody wants to believe me when I say its going to take a long time to heal.  I didn't when I was in that place, and I refused to accept it.  I wound up making my own healing take a lot longer than it needed to."

Uhm.. no, it really is, especially for those of us who feel like we had little better than roommates and not spouses for a number of years already.   In my experience in working with people going through a divorce, it takes a really long time to work through the emotional aspects of healing.   This goes without saying and I don't disagree. On the other hand an awful lot of life is emotionally destabilizing and while stemming the larger damage before getting into potentially dangerous territory is a good plan, insisting on a 3 year leak-plugging inspection just seems like adding unnecessary misery to the situation.   The one thing that does tend to be constant in this, however, is nobody wants to believe when I say its going to take a long time to heal.   Also not arguing with any particular thing... I just don't see myself getting along for the number of years your guidelines would suggest, and I'm a frigging introvert for goodness sake. I like being alone a lot of the time."
Divorce,3a2poj,LaTuFu,0,Tue Jun 16 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"One thing that might be making it more difficult to believe...I'm not saying that someone absolutely can never date or will never be ready to date until the full healing process is complete.  A lot of people hear ""1-3 years"" and think ""oh man, that's too long to be alone"" or something like that.  No, it just means that you should expect this situation to impact your life in a pretty direct way for a few years, and the first year or so, maybe two (and yes, some people even 3 or more) you may find it very difficult to date if not impossible.

Today you're not angry but you will have days where you are again and then days of depression and sadness, and back to being ok. I would suggest getting a therapist to help you deal with things, especially if depression happens. That's a hard dark road and it's absolutely better if you have someone to walk it with you.   But my feelings...I've been very accommodating to her. Telling her that I'm praying it works out for her and her new man. Telling her that if I can, I'll help her out financially even though I'm not living there anymore for a short period of time.   Stop saying that, stop helping her out financially. She made a very real choice that she doesn't want you in her life anymore, which means she doesn't want to benefit from your income either. Let her new boyfriend take care of her financially since that's the decision he's made. If you establish a pattern of financial assistance it will make it that much harder for you if things go south and she demands alimony and shows the court that you were fully willing, and able to offer assistance."

And my wife has made it perfectly clear that if they don't find jobs, they're out on the street.  Of course, I have a contingency plan for that.  But in the meantime, I agree with you that in a way, providing financial support to her could bite my ass....but I don't want anything to happen to the those kids or dogs.  I asked to take all 8 dogs we have....but she said that she was more than okay to take care of them.  I'm thinking in the back of my head, ""How the hell are you going to be responsible for 8 dogs when you're fucking the hell out of your new man?!?""

Divorce,3a1wji,zandyman,2,Tue Jun 16 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"I think you may have a problem. I think that you are attempting to take the ""high road"" to be enlightened and noble, possibly to the wrongful detriment of your own reasoned self-interest.  The high road is a good idea, in as much as it means moving on with your own life and not focusing on hers. But I see some people here who instead seem to associate it unconsciously with being subservient, and putting others first.  You should not do that here. You can be gracious and move on, without turning things with your ex into combative wasteland, but also without continuing to give of yourself to a woman who has rejected you.  You do not owe her, nor should you be giving her, financial support (other than what is mandated by a court). Far too many people set a pattern of excess financial support to an ex (or soon to be ex) spouse in the early stages of divorce, when they are confused, hurt, and still in love with their ex (and desperately trying to hold on to the idea of them, even if they won't admit it to themselves).  But doing this can create a financial nightmare that binds you years down the road, hampering your ability to move on with your life once you finally realize it is over and you have better things to do with your time and money. But by that point, if you did things wrong early in the divorce process, it can be too late - you've essentially committed yourself (too often in a way that ends up being legally binding) to a lifetime of financial servitude to a person that did not value you enough to stay with you.  Move on, and let your ex take care of herself. You do not have to say anything to her about it, and you do not have to hold it over her head and gloat about it, etc. The point is, she wants to be on her own, she should do so with all of the benefits (her new man) and drawbacks (you no longer supporting her). She should not have the benefits and no drawbacks, or worse, continue to place the burden on you."

Divorce,3a1pp1,Crispinwhere,4,Tue Jun 16 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"Openly tell your daughter that you miss her and you'd like to setup something where you have better contact.  If texts aren't that then maybe have her pick a time that works for her.  Your ex totally needs to support this.  If she is getting in the way, shoot her emails about the problem and catalog her responses.  Eventually yes you may need to drag her to court.  I'd recommend asking for a modification than seeking contempt though.  I've been on the side of a modification and you essentially can reset things to ""fair"" when they've gotten out of balance.  Asking for contempt means you are ""ok in general with the situation but feel she is playing dirty"".  All they will do is say ""stop doing it ex"" and you've blown $ for her to get a smack on the wrist.  Yay!  Another thought would be to send a pretty open letter to your ex along the lines of ""after 4 months I'm finding this arrangement to be less than expected"".   Mention the reluctance on her part to help you communicate, etc.  Your child is still a minor.  Your ex totally should be the one approving schedules.  If you want to take a trip to FL in August, she should be responding in a timely manner ""Yes"" or ""No"".  Typically a calendar is used to schedule time.  In the one I was involved in the out of state parent has until April to schedule summer visitation schedule and gets ""first dibs"" on any date excluding awarded holidays.  I hate to say this, but it honestly sounds like you played right into your ex's hands here.  She wants to dig into your daughter and moving far away is a great ploy.  I'd suggest keeping the moral high ground when speaking to your daughter.  Eventually kids realize one parent talks smack and the other doesn't.... well the one talking smack is an ass.  tl;dr Do what you can to open the lines of communication with your daughter, working with her.  Inform your ex of her assistance neeeded in such a way that you can proceed to escalate to a modification of custody if it comes down to that."
Divorce,3a1pp1,Daemon42,3,Tue Jun 16 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"You could file a contempt of course but like you said how much good would that do? Unfortunately you've let 6 months pass which basically shows that you're ok with not having any physical custody of your daughter.  You may not like it but there's always the option to find work in the same city/town/location as where your ex is now living and move to Florida so that you can resume having shared parenting. How much are you calling her on a regular basis? Honestly part of it may be that she's 14 years old, after 6 months she's probably established friendships and is spending a lot of her free time with her friends.  The best way for you to be in her life is to be as close to her as possible, at this point you've allowed the move to happen away and allowed enough time to pass that it'd be hard to undo that with the court system and yeah it would negatively affect your daughter. So you can't move her back, but you can move closer to her.  Edit: If moving closer isn't an option I understand but you should file for a modified custody agreement so that you have legal backing to make sure that your Ex does allow your daughter to visit for the agreed upon times."
Divorce,3a1pp1,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Tue Jun 16 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"Coming from a child of divorce who had trouble with these kinds of things (though not quite in this way), I would say the best thing you can do is get a court-ordered visitation agreement. You need guaranteed times when you'll be with her. My parents never had that and it was always what my mom regretted most because she wished our father wouldn't be able to shirk seeing us for trivial reasons (wouldn't pick us up if we were sick, etc).  Second to this, I would just add that she is 14 now and some of the lack of communication might simply be age. She likely doesn't think parents are ""cool"" anymore. So, take her ignoring and other things with a grain of salt, and try not to take it personally. As long as you're waiting in the wings, supporting her as she goes, she'll remember that when she gets a bit older. If you keep up contact and pushing to see her, that will be the impression she has when she looks back, even if you feel like she thinks you're a schmuck now."

He let his dirty side show,  he'd stop at nothing to win and I have a hard time mustering up empathy for him now.  I think it would go away if I didn't distrust him so much. I feel like he's always one step away from his next plan to steal my daughter from me somehow or ruin my relationship with her.  If I have bad wishes is because his lack of empathy scared the crap out of me inside. It's been 4.5 years, I hope it goes away soon."
Divorce,3a2dgk,Catcherofsouls,2,Wed Jun 17 04:32:15 2015 UTC,I don'tv know that feeling of amusement I get when something stupid blows up on her is still pretty strong.   I honestly hope that she can be happy though I don't know if she's psychologically capable of if.

I just see/deal with her social media stalking me after she cheated on me, lied to me for 6+ months, lives with the new guy, yet still lashes out at me for not telling her I'm buying a new place(didn't change my voicemail password...whoops). And as pissed off as I get, and as much as I laugh because she's obviously miserable. I still wish she'd get the help she obviously needs.   It's taken a lot to get to that place. Maybe I'm just able to cut ties quickly as lucky/sad as that can be...but the first few months were MISERABLE. I've really only started feeling this way after seeing her behaviors as a reflection as something in her own head, rather then something that I did. I also have seen the lack of support she truly got through the whole process, and the effect past issues have caused. So I just feel bad for her on the whole, because she's just digging herself deeper and deeper, and nobody really tries to help stop the bleeding."

Divorce,39zuhe,TragicallyCute,3,Tue Jun 16 03:07:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure what property you have, but none of it is worth your life or your sanity. Moving in with mom isn't the worst thing (I have roommates myself, so you could try that route once you're on your feet and working).  The important point here is you're only a bad break away from being dead. Again - stuff isn't worth that.  If your car is in your name, pack it with your things and leave and don't go back. If the car isn't in your name, you can take it, but you risk being on the wrong side of the law on that one, at least until a divorce grants it to you.  As far as his kid is concerned - unless you're severely attached to that child, leave that behind too."
Divorce,39zuhe,GrandEthos,3,Tue Jun 16 12:59:39 2015 UTC,"It's time to take care of yourself. You deserve to be taken care of and he's proven that he isn't willing/able to do it. Broken bones aren't the line when it comes to physical abuse; if he put his hands on you at all, it's not ok. It's super easy to believe that it won't happen again. And it might not. Or it might happen again and it might be way worse. It's not worth the risk, especially if he isn't willing to seek treatment for his own problems.  Your mother is not in control of your future, nor is your husband. You get to decide what comes next. You also get to decide whether that future includes either of them (and if it does, what that interaction looks like). If you are worried that your mother will try to stop you, consider taking a break from interacting with her. I actually had to do that with my own parents for a little while after my own separation began because they were making things harder.  I would recommend that you ask a friend to help you take the things that matter most to you out of the house while he's gone (maybe while he's working?). Don't worry if you can't get everything; things can be replaced. Take the sentimental things and the stuff you need to live on for awhile.   Get a lawyer immediately. If you think you're in danger, file a restraining order. It's really easy to focus on protecting him from his own consequences. Work towards stopping that.  This is not going to be an easy process, but you are a very strong, capable person. You are going to get through this and you're going to be better off in the end. Good luck, friend."
Divorce,39zuhe,Justkeepbreathing123,5,Tue Jun 16 13:10:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Living with my mother isn't an option; the entire time I'm there (even if I'm just going to visit now) it's 75% her telling me that I should stay, he's never broken a bone, etc and 25% her crying. I've tried and failed several times to stay with her; by the end of it I feel like I'm letting her down by trying to help myself and go back to my husband to try and make her happy. No one likes being the reason their mother is crying.  I do understand about the job bit quite well, I was working two of them when my husband and I got together."

You sound like you've already found another relationship. If you haven't I apologize. But if you have you should look into a thing called the affair fog.   Either way you should seriously consider individual therapy and joint counseling before just abandoning the marriage since there are kids involved. Kids are the ones that get hurt the most in a divorce and that bullshit line that ""kids are resilient"" is exactly that, bullshit.    though I think the kids will be happier seeing us in happy relationships after all is said and done   No the kids would be happier to have their family happy and healthy together, go to a counselor and commit to fixing the problems in your marriage before just moving on to a ""better"" life."

Honestly this could just as much be a part of the affair fog as anything else. Basically the affair fog comes down to you're going to be emotionally cut off from your husband, you're going to pretty much always focus on what he does wrong, or anything else that allows you to justify your affair, oh and you'll pretty much be a completely toxic person for any relationship you find yourself in.   The affair fog can take months to come out of, the only way you come out of it is to cease all contact with your affair partner, cease any flirting or emotional affairs that may be going on and actually focus on yourself with a therapist, because honestly you aren't capable of focusing on your marriage right now.   Here's the really hard part, if your husband doesn't know about the affair then you will have to tell him if you want to give your marriage an actual chance at success. Otherwise you will constantly be guarded against him and never be able to truly have an open and honest relationship with him, or your children.   Take 6 months to start seeing a therapist for yourself on a weekly basis, cut off all contact (this includes texting, email, letters), with your affair partner or potential affair partners and actually allow yourself to take an honest look at your marriage and more importantly, yourself. Your kids are worth 6 months of committed work on yourself right?"
Divorce,39yheb,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:44:47 2015 UTC,I really value your frank and honest opinion. You seem to be very objective and fair.
Divorce,39yheb,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"It's just that I'm not ready to stop the affair yet.   What's more important to you? Your children or your affair? You can't have both. It may seem ok to lose your children for half their lives now in exchange for sexual satisfaction, or really a serotonin high which is basically what this affair is giving you. If you're wondering serotonin is every bit as addicting as some pretty hard drugs. My STBX thought that she would be perfectly happy with having our daughter for half the time, she only realized what that really meant after we separated.    I might never experience this again in my life after this ends.   This is a justification for continuing the affair.   It can be hard to want to work on something after years of trying, but the longer you continue the affair the harder and longer it would take to rebuild your relationship with your husband. What happens when you finally come out of the affair fog and realize how important having your children in your life is?  Honesty is good and that indecision over everything you're feeling is a part of the affair fog which is why I say the best thing you can do for yourself is to end the affair. I promise you that you will find happiness equal to or greater than it later in life. What you have right now is pleasure, pleasure that will in no way lead to lasting happiness for you, your husband, or your children.   Even if you're not ready to end the affair start seeing a therapist. You have to figure out what it is that you actual want in life, if it's your children and to give them a good home to grow up in then start examining your choices and see how they're lining up with that, because right now, they're not.   I don't envy you what you're going through, I know from seeing my STBX go through it with her affair how much an affair can twist and mess up your emotions and honestly your perception of the world. I guarantee you that it's affecting your husbands happiness and your children's happiness, and not in a positive way, even if they don't know about the affair your emotional detachment is affecting them.  The only way you can change is if you commit to change, it's not going to be easy, it's not going to be fun, it will take months to years, but in the end you'll have a much better chance of actually finding long lasting happiness instead of just jumping between pleasures for the rest of your life.  Your children are worth committing to, the marriage may be beyond saving but they are absolutely worth making every effort you can to rebuild your marriage with your husband. Long term love is less about hormones and head over heals nonsense of new love and about commitment and choosing that person everyday of your life. Unfortunately we let things build up for years and that can lead to some pretty serious breakdowns, which is where counseling is amazing but only if both people are committed to the marriage.  The only way to save your marriage is to commit 150% to it and rebuilding it, that means no affairs, no communication ever again with your affair partner.   I know that it feels like there are no problems in the world when you're with your partner, but that is a fantasy. It's a fantasy because right now you can put all the problems in life on your husband, or job, or anything else while the affair is perfect and wonderful and more amazing than anything you've ever known. But that's a fantasy, one that's guaranteed to end. One that is completely unrealistic, one that you will never find in a long lasting real relationship.  Edit: Sorry for the rambling it happens to me sometimes."

Divorce,39yqiu,TheEarlShibe,3,Mon Jun 15 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"Chances are, she has been planing this for a while at her lawyers direction.   Established new residence for children and herself Has probably been writing checks to her parents for 'Rent' and 'DayCare' to establish expenses for support Live separate from you for 6 months (most states require 6 months to 1 year of separation) File before you can start making any money from your education so any student loans will not be considered as contributing to the marriage finances.   So, her lawyer is not going to suggest to her that you two meet for a mediator to hash it out if he has her convinced they can go to court, take everything from you, and stick you with the legal bill. It has now become an adversarial endeavor, and you need to get an adviser on your side to protect you."

Divorce,39yqiu,toasterchild,2,Tue Jun 16 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"Hopefully she hasn't moved far away because one particular tactic is to move to a new location for a reason ( you're in school, calling off period with parents, etx) then they file for divorce and ask for status quo which is now the new location.   Then because you're working and they aren't they seek sole physical custody. While they might not get it, you'd be responsible for getting them from their new established residence and returning them to that place.  Not saying she's doing that but it's a common tactic, because normally once divorce papers are filed neither parent can move the children and if they want to move the children stay in their current location.   This gets around that. I believe. It's around 6 months to establish the new residence the court will base for decisions.  Good luck."

Divorce,39vut9,kipela,6,Mon Jun 15 05:34:59 2015 UTC,"You both should be taking your son to the same doctor.  Continuity of care is important and this is causing unnecessary stress.  Buy an outfit to send him to daycare in on your drop off day and ask that he wear the same outfit when you pick him up next time.  She doesn't have to pack a bag for him at all so I suggest you don't complain about it's contents.    Don't listen to her complain about money or her threats to reduce parenting time.  It would be better if you tell her that you only want to communicate by text or email.   She disrespects my role entirely and feels he is better off without me. I have voiced these concerns time and time again, yet every single time I get brickwalled and nothing changes for our co-parenting relationship for my sons benefit.   You go on and on about how you think she is BPD, narcissistic, emotionally unstable, selfish, etc and you are surprised that she calls you a fuckwit?  Seriously, stop diagnosing her, arguing with her and judging her choices unless they directly and immediately adversely impact your son.  Start limiting your communications to only respectful factual exchanges preferably in writing."

If no bag is packed and he needs spare clothes it is the responsibility of the parent who has him at the time.  She has clothes for her time.  You have clothes for your time.  Of course it is better if you can at least partially share his wardrobe, but she legally doesn't have to do that, so tread very softly on this one and make sure that everything she sends is washed and returned.    This is a good place to vent.  Just be aware that about 90 percent of divorcing people are convinced that the STBX is narcissistic, BPD, bipolar, emotionally unstable, sociopathic, etc, etc, etc.  Almost none of this 90 percent are licensed psychologists and there is a lot of confirmation bias occurring.  What seems clear is that your STBX is still very angry, but there is some hope this will change over time."

Divorce,39vut9,LaTuFu,4,Mon Jun 15 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"If he goes to the same doctor, then you have even less reason to throw a fit over her reactions to the change in medication.  Tell her to ask the doctor why he changed the meds and then ignore the rest of her attempts to engage in an argument.  Again, she's doing this because you respond to it.  As /u/Karissa36 said, she doesn't have to pack anything at all for your time.  So it's your responsibility.  Get over it.  There is a difference between facts, and your opinion of her choices/behavior.  Most of the information you've provided is your opinion of her choices/behavior.  It is a fact that she does not provide you with clothes for your visitation.  It is your opinion that she is in the wrong for doing so.  It is a fact that you demand that she provide these things, but it is also a fact that she is not legally required to do so.    Your opinion is she's BPD as a result.  One could also have the opinion that you're being a controlling jerk, based on some of your comments.  See where this is going yet?  The point is, most of us here would agree that it sounds like you have a problem with your co-parenting.  However, the opinion some of us have is that there is plenty of room for you to evaluate your own behavior and choices when it comes to determining how to improve this situation."

You're giving him meds from a doctor. She has no argument.   I have asked on multiple occasions to use my child support money to purchase more suitable clothing   Quit telling her how to spend the money, you're only stirring the pot.   She continually flips her lid and goes on a bender on how my child support money barely covers her expenses   Not your problem   She threatens to reduce my allocated time with my son   She can't.

Today I'm accused of child abuse, because our littlest has an ingrown toenail, and the oldest had a little scab on his nose.  Coparenting is literally impossible.

Email/text messages only, only about the logistics of pickups for your kid.  Nothing else, NOTHING.   however she is the type of person to think that if I back down and do not raise my concerns where necessary, she thinks she has won and the cycle of bullshit continues.   Why do you care if she thinks she has won? Why do you care what kind of person she is?  Don't engage, no matter how many of your buttons she pushes, or whether she calls you a fuckwit, half wit, or no wit.  Do not talk to her, do not justify your parenting, do not criticize or otherwise discuss her parenting with her, unless there is some huge over-arching safety or health issue.  If she calls you names, don't respond.  Don't ""voice concerns"", don't talk about her financial situation (why do you know or care if she's going into debt?).  Her time with your kid is hers, and yours is yours.  You have control of what you do, and your kid does when he/she is with you. You don't control her.  Stop analyzing, stop justifying, stop arguing.  You'll be happier.  It has been said before, but this saying is applicable here:  Not your circus, not your monkeys."

Divorce,39vut9,aaronchi,2,Mon Jun 15 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"I'm at the beginning stages of a similar situation with a 4 year old daughter and have recently come to the conclusion that it's simply not going to be possible to co-parent with my ex.  In this situation, I believe it is even more important to focus on being a positive role model for your child. BPD behaviors can be passed from mother to child through modeling and you need to be there to balance things out. I would strongly recommend that you read up on mothers of BPD children so you have some tools to deal with this.  The other thing I want to look into personally is appointing a parenting plan coordinator. I'm not sure if there is something similar in Australia, but these people are legally empowered to resolve conflicts around parenting issues and can serve as an advocate for you if things ever get bad enough that you feel like you need to go back to court to modify your custody arrangement.  I've also found a really great site called bpdfamily.com that has a forum where you can ask questions, get advice or just vent with people who have gone through similar situations.  Good luck."
Divorce,39vut9,LaTuFu,2,Mon Jun 15 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"The bottom line is, she's doing all of this because you let her.  What I mean by this is, you already know the correct answer is ""do not engage.""  But for some reason you think that your situation is different.   Whenever my son is sick... If you are taking your son to a licensed physician on your visitation time, you are not breaking the law.  From a co-parenting standpoint, I am not sure how Australia handles legal custody.  In the US, parents with Joint Legal custody generally have to agree on medical decisions like choice of doctor, etc.  But for routine illnesses and minor visits not many US courts are going to step in and tell you that you're being an unfit parent because you sought a second opinion and took that doctor's advice.  Thank her for giving you her opinion about the medical care you seek for him, and then ignore anything else she says. I have asked on multiple occasions to use my child support money to purchase more suitable clothing...Her reaction to whenever I demand that at least one set of suitable clothing is in his bag on changeover is to tell me to simply buy my own  It's NOYB what she does with the child support payments, and legally there is nothing you can do about it.  (Assuming AUS is like the US with regards to child support)  You can only do something about documented cases of unfit/unhealthy parenting.  By your own admission, she provides him suitable clothes on her time.  Just not when she sends him over to you.  Sure, that is crappy co-parenting, but it sounds like she has a valid reason for it.  You're demanding that she meet certain requirements for behavior as a co-parent, which is completely wrong.  You don't have the right to demand anything of her any more.  Get over it.  I'd tell you to go stuff yourself and buy your own clothes, too.  This is one situation that you are in the wrong and need to change it if you want to see things improve.  You're trying to control her, and that is wrong. She continually flips her lid and goes on a bender on how my child support money barely covers her expenses.  Not your problem how she feels about it.  If she is going on a bender with you about it, its because you let her.  Do not engage.  Period.   She threatens to reduce my allocated time with my son. Ignore.  Do not engage.  Let it go.  Unless you're a bad parent and she can prove it, she won't take you back to court.  You've already indicated that she doesn't have much money.  Therefore, the likelihood is very small that she can afford an attorney.  If she's met with one who is honest, they've already told her that the chances of reducing your time are slim and none, so it is a waste of her time.  Ignore, ignore, ignore.  And if she does take you to court, as pain in the ass as it will be and aggravating, don't worry about it.  If you're playing the game above board, paying what you're supposed to pay, you have nothing to worry about.  Otherwise, ignore, ignore, ignore. I know she doesn't respect my role as his father. So what?  It sounds like you don't respect her very much, either.  Focus on what you need to do in order to be an effective parent for your child, and making the appropriate choices as a co-parent with her--regardless of her behavior."

It sounds like they've been inconsiderate to have let you know about their relationship troubles. I don't think you should get involved. Relationships- especially ones that have been evolving for over 22 years- are more complex than outsiders can understand. You aren't responsible for their problems, you have zero responsibility to help either of them fix their situation, and you don't have the power to prevent or heal any of the issues in their relationship. Focus on yourself. It's ok to be 100% selfish about this."
Divorce,39va0e,anytimeyoulike,2,Mon Jun 15 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get involved. But you can certainly be there and be supportive if/when it happens.   A quick couple of points:   and my mom already said she's demanding her half if they go through it. As far as I know, she has never cheated on my dad, but I'm pretty sure she'd just go with another man and spend my dad's money with him.   Depending on where you live and the ages of the kids, your mom would get very little. Child support is only given if children are under the age of 18. Spousal support varies from state to state, but is really just used to get the non-working spouse up and working again. It is short term. I'm not sure where this notion of ""half"" has come from ... but in my state (Texas), my ex got a large chuck of my monthly salary for child support. Her spousal support is good for just 12 months and is not half my salary.   Second, my dad would be alone.   I'm sure there are a lot of guys here that would attest to this being one of the bigger adjustments post divorce. As a dad, you get caught up working, seeing your spouse as your main friend, and ensuring you are there for your children. Post divorce, the spouse is no longer a friend, your time with the children is cut ...  It will take work on his part, but it isn't the end of the world.  Don't let all of that be your burden though. Just make sure you don't let the divorce process knock you off track. Understand it is their relationship that failed - you are not them ... your future relationships are not destined to fail. And finally, love them. With Father's Day coming up, you might take some time to draft up a sentimental letter to him regarding your relationship (that is as long as it is a good one ...

You don't want to be led on so get okay with what the truth might be. There is nothing you can say or do. Truthfully, they should not even be talking to you about it. You don't want to wind up a pawn in the battle. Don't picks sides either. Sometimes, people become so intertwined that your Mom lost all of her outside the home identity. Your Dad stopped socializing. They might just need to develop new identities. Lastly, at 18ish your just starting to see your parents as real people. We are all big children at our core. Don't expect much more."

Now you see why she was divorced 2 times prior and why she will be divorced again after you. I'm thinking you should talk to her and her family about walking away and see what they say.

Divorce,39uxc9,Ivon33,2,Mon Jun 15 18:36:25 2015 UTC,Her heart is not in the relationship anymore. She has abandoned her baby son just like she abandoned her baby daughter. And she's spending time with someone else's kids instead of her own child? And she's in love with someone else. For the sake of your son I feel it would be best to cut her out of your and his life. He'll be better off being raised by a single stable father than a father and a mother who loves him when she feels like it. She will mess him up like she did her daughter. The beautiful light that you see in his face will be snuffed out by her bs.

Not for everyone, and it's not exactly conducive to doing anything than work between that job and my primary day job. But at night I can yell at my stbx all I want, and criticize her, and tell the night everything I want to say to her but shouldn't. I'm able to fall asleep in 10 minutes as well, so that's a little plus. The second job also gave me the time to think about my situation with my stbx and realize that our relationship was over and I needed to be the one to finally pull the trigger.

Divorce,39virf,BlueSkyFading,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"Try to get off of the social media entirely until the divorce is final.  At the very least block her so that you don't have to see her name come up anymore. If there is no chance of saving the marriage then just keep those thoughts to yourself.  Unfortunately the only things that matter are what was legally bound.  If she goes against those then she will have to pay the repercussions.  Anything said verbally might as well not been said at all.   If you feel that you'd both be getting a fair deal, my advice would be to get it over as quickly as possible.  In my case, my STBX is constantly changing terms we've discussed and threatening me with taking the children if I don't give her what she wants.  She is getting more demanding and volatile as things go on so it's best to grab a reasonable deal and get it done."

Divorce,39toos,FusRo_Duh,3,Sun Jun 14 21:03:43 2015 UTC,"A common question around here. I'm just going to quote what I said to another redditor here a little while back:  Hey OP. My heart really got heavy when I read your post. I honestly can relate to what you're saying.  We all have our good days, where we feel like we're coping, we're on top of the world and where we don't need the person we've just left behind (or in some case, who left us. Either or) and even where we're thankful because we can see how toxic the relationship was, and we're glad to be out. We have our bad days that include us asking ourselves ""why me?"", ""Why wasn't I good enough?"", ""How can I fix this?"" and almost always thoughts on how we're always going to be sad and nothing will be happy in our lives again.  I remember thinking in terms of relationships and what I wanted in life, was at an end. That I would be alone and I'll never be happy again. I mean, really, who would want a 27 year old single mother who is full time at University? Apparently, quite a few men. But fuck that, I'm in this for me. No one else can lay the path for my future. Only I can. And damn it, I'm working towards the best I can. We've all been there, and some are going through it right now. In my experience with it all, being selfish is the best thing for you right now.  ""Everyone says it will get better, but no one said it would get worse. And, the most truly frightening question: what if I don't want to get better?""  To answer your question. Don't. Don't think of it as a whole. You take all the damn time you need to heal. You're under nobodies watch or time. You want to feel sorry for yourself for a while? Do it. But do it in a healthy way, where it solely benefits you. I took 7.5 months of taking my time to feel everything I needed to to heal. It was painful, the worst emotional pain I have ever felt in my life, and it was difficult to do that, whilst staying strong for my 3yo. On Tuesday, I would feel fantastic - fuck everyone (who attributed to the breakdown of my marriage) and fuck my ex, I would say. I was on top of the world laughing and smiling. As close as Thursday, I would be trying not to blink so the tears wouldn't fall from my eyes. I would spend hours thinking of the happy moments and relish in my gut feelings knowing how much happier my ex was without me and how much like shit I felt. There was a time where I spent a lot more time being down, than up.  But throughout it all, I kept progressing. Even in that time I was being selfish and not caring about other peoples problems, I was still hitting little milestones: finding some joy in every day even if it was the sun and how lucky I am to be free, how now I can go and buy a pair of $3 underwear or $20 bra because no one will not allow me anymore. How I was big enough to make the initial step of leaving a marriage I wasn't happy in (although, I had no choice - it's a long story).  Whether my steps were heavy or light, I kept walking, even if it felt like I was stuck in mud or quicksand.  I won't lie to you - you're going to feel like shit. But where can you go once you're low? You go up. Have you spoken to your therapist about your concerns and really tried to address the problems? I know that seems like a silly question, but all too often I hear of people unhappy with their therapist because the client himself/herself won't be honest with themselves about how they're feeling and why.  My Poppa used to have a great saying. ""Dare to struggle, dare to win. If you don't fight, you lose"". The context can be subjective, but I find applying this to almost any situation helps."

Take a walk, buy a record, join a gym, join a club, do something you loved before you got married that you miss doing. Stock your fridge with heathy food and cook it! Don't eat fast food, and stay away from alcohol. Live well. Live. Well.     Turn your place into the most comfortable place you can. That's your castle now, respect it. Surround yourself with positive stuff. Don't worry about whether you had it before...if it makes you happy...put in your sight line. And as dumb as it sounds coming from a dude...a clean place makes me feel so much better when I get home everyday...so keep it clean!!    My skin hurts sometimes it feels so terrible. Take a break...relax...and breathe. Really. When it starts to feel like it caving in...count your breaths. It'll clear your mind and help you refocus.     If you have the means...find a therapist or a counselor. I started going immediately following the split and it has helped tremendously. Having someone to dump your thoughts to, that can help you make sense of it and help you grow whole again has been really helpful.     I am far from fixed, and I get low everyday.

The one line in the song that made me tear up was that ""and every road you take always sees you home....home"". May not do it now.  I've done it once to my STBX, and I'm about to do it again now.  FORGIVE.  If you don't, it will linger and hold you back.  We are a species that perceives time as always moving forward.  We are linear, though we remember.  But if you forgive, it will, in time, release you from that past so that you can move forward.     I told my STBX last week, ""You're going to be a phone call in five years, like how my ex-g/f called me five years after we broke up wondering how I was.""  My STBX said, ""I don't want to be that"", implying she wanted to stay friends.  I told her, ""Sure.....but in five years I'm going to tell you that I'm fine, and that I hope you're fine, and then hang up.""  You will be okay."
Divorce,39t062,chiguy22000,4,Sun Jun 14 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"hey...im in a surprisingly similar situation. me (37) wife (37) told me it was a long time coming, that we made better partners than a husband and wife. She said I was her best friend and favorite person, but it was time. It's only been a few short weeks, but a lot of it is a haze. My community has really helped me out, I suggest if you have one (or family) you turn to them (I know i have a problem with this because I've been on my own since I was 17 and always pulled my own weight, but they forced their help on me, and I'm glad they did).  I know you probably feel like your story isn't like anyone else's on here. That your wife isn't crazy or mean or vindictive and you don't know how to shut off loving her. I feel the same way. The good news is...you don't...at least not right now. You take everything on your own timeline, a break up is just like a marriage, no two look alike.   I know that someone has been waiting in the wings, and so what upsets me the most is my loneliness, whereas she has someone comforting her (someone who isn't me)...  I'm really sorry for your loss, but fuck it...I'm around if you need to talk. even if it's just venting."

Logically I know what I have to do but my heart and head aren't syncing up.  Right now I can't eat, had a horrible nights sleep last night... I just don't know.  I'm thinking about driving down a few hours to hang out with my parents who are amazing supporters of me but I want to stay and try to talk through things with my wife when she gets up.  We were supposed to go on vacation for in two weeks.  Oh man... :(  Let me see how today goes and I might take you up on that offer to vent."

I'd spent 13 years making sure she was ok, putting her first, and being madly in love. I had to make sure that whatever I was doing was in my best interest. If your wife is anything like mine, she'd never fault you for that right now. So do what you think is best, definitely, but remember to consider your own health and well-being. Right now it sounds like you're doing the best you can, and in your (our) situation it's all that can be done."

I'm (32m) in the 5th month since my breakup and am still struggling. i wish things had been worse between us, to make it easier to see the bright side of breaking up. There's a disconnect between how i feel and what is happening that causes a ton of mental anguish. That said,  I'm going slowly slowly but i had to realize i was going at the pace i needed to.

Your situation is a lot like mine I suggest you read the threads I posted as the comments would really relate to you I think. You have to get out ASAP and live with family or friends. Keep your life moving forward, focusing on work is really helping me and being with my family/friends is too, btw these aren't even close friends but they are at least respectable and willing to listen. We are going to make it through this because we don't have a choice and do not think that you do have another option life is too beautiful.

Divorce,39r8ou,paboi,3,Sat Jun 13 23:44:28 2015 UTC,If she's completely unwilling to work on the relationship in any meaningful way you may well have to accept that she's gone.    She's not been fair to you if she didn't communicate her issues with the marriage to you.  But you can't make her stay.   Right now you need to be worried about you.   Open an individual account and move any direct deposits to it.   I'm not saying it'll work but it will at least start her giving her some consequences for her actions.

Pretty much what you're expressing here is severe anxiety.  I would recommend that you find a new hobby to engage in that doesn't remind you of her.  Listen to new music, exercise, call a therapist and make an appointment, talk to your doctor about a short-term anxiolytic.  1) It's not cliche, it's life.  2) Yes, you do, it's part of the healing process.  3) Because the only other option is to roll over and die, which isn't an option.

I know how painful it is to be home along with the kids, while you know your wife is out being unfaithful and dishonest.  What you're doing is the most important thing you can do right now. Hold the fort. Be there for your children. And begin to process your emotions. Don't leave the house. Stand your ground. Be the Dad your kids need. Your wife is not demonstrating good parenting and this could work for you.   For me, where you are was the hardest part. It took a colossal fuck up on my wife's part for me to feel prepared to go the route of divorce. I could have done it sooner if I had the time, emotional energy, and money to catch her in an unscrupulous act. Consider doing that if you can. I know how hard it is to raise kids when your spouse is absent and you're left picking up the pieces.  Take notes. Write down all the bullshit she's putting you through. Do your best to be the better man. Be the best fucking man you can be. Take this situation by the balls and learn what it takes to be a real husband and father. You can do this."
Divorce,39s9dv,littleorangemonkeys,6,Sun Jun 14 06:56:10 2015 UTC,Guilt?   You've walked on eggshells for how long?   I had no guilt to deal with when i left my abusive ex-wife just a sense of relief.     Here is the kicker.   Each of us is responsible for one person's mental health:  our own.   He's angry and lashing out at you rather than dealing with what's going on inside him.   It's easier and often these people cannot reflect on their behavior objectively.
Divorce,39s9dv,Catcherofsouls,2,Sun Jun 14 10:46:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this.  I feel like I had some kind of responsibility to help him with is mental issues.  Had he been willing to work on them himself, I would have supported him 100%.  But I can't be his therapist."

He chooses to not make any effort to improve the marriage.  He chooses to not trust anyone else or pursue other relationships.  He chooses to be bitter and nurse his grudges.  He chooses to cling to some la la vision of the world in which you were supposed to endlessly accommodate him, never question his actions, always support him, while he had no responsibility to do any of this for you.    You are not responsible for his choices.  Go to therapy to deal with your issues.  As for him when discussions or comments like in your post arise, I suggest that you respond calmly by saying ONLY, ""You can choose to believe that.""  His choices are not your choices and it's not your job to agree or to change his mind.  Once he realizes that he can't guilt trip you any more with his poor pitiful me attitude, he might actually get better."

I feel guilty about my own part in all of this, but I need to make sure guilty feelings are for only the things that I did and the feelings are not for things outside of my control.  I keep thinking about the serenity prayer.   It does not have to invoke God.

Divorce,39s9dv,amentest,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:12:57 2015 UTC,"After months upon months of self reflection from my own failed marriage I have come to some conclusions.   First and foremost it takes two people to make a relationship work and only one to break it. If one person quits, no amount of change, begging, or pleading will fix it. If you AND he aren't willing to put in what it will take to attempt to fix it, there is nothing more you can do.  Don't feel bad about yourself for the marriage failing. This happens. People change. See above: it takes 2 people to make it work. Did you do your best? What more can be asked of you than that?  As far as guilt goes, be a good person through the separation. Its easy to want to spite the person. You need to worry about you, no one else will. If it turned in to a bad relationship you need to get out for your own well being. Help him if he needs it and will take it, but don't get sucked back in. They may self destruct and try and take you with them and they won't give a damn that they do. You left for a reason. He may still be the person for you, but its not right now.  Lastly, you likely did things wrong in the relationship and so did he. If you figure them out and you don't like the things you did, work towards changing them. But do it for you, not anyone else. Work towards being the person you want to be.  Divorce sucks. Talking to them sucks. Getting out of bed sucks. Therapy may help. I am doing martial arts instead cause that works better for me. There are plenty of alternatives to therapy. You can't control your ex or their actions, just you and your actions. You can't change your ex's opinion of you, but you can be a decent person, if you weren't before start now. Put on your own oxygen mask before helping others. You can't change the past but everyday is a new day, a new start. Don't give up. You will get through this and be a better person for it, if you choose to."

You don't know someone till you live with them.  And then very often life chips away one's willingness to overlook the other's fault.  When I read your post and many other of these posts I think of the old saying: There's his side, her side, and the truth.  And what good does the truth really do us?  Whether it's his fault or yours are you going to change? Is he?  There's the old saying: A leopard doesn't change his spots. And you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  Life's too short.

You need to get proper legal advice so start at your local courthouse. Interjurisdictional orders happen all the time in the lower courts.

Also, as someone said, consult a lawyer to see if you trully have to go through a Supreme court. I a.

Over the last few years my STBX has become extraordinarily vengeful.  I feel like everything I say and do goes onto a scorecard for her to use against me at a later time.  It is ultimately why I pushed for the separation and ultimately the divorce.  I'm reminded every day that I made the right call.  But I also don't believe she is done repaying me for my perceived wrongs against her, and I fear she never will be.  So I'm at a point where I want to forgive her for my own sanity, but I also want her to know that when the divorce is final I have no intention of being her friend.  I'm sure that will make her furious and want to damage me further, but I feel like the more face-time we have the more time I have a target on my chest.  It's a tough call.   avoid addictive behavior   We've been separated for six month so instead of real-life dating I've been prepping for the world of online dating.  On the one hand I really feel like I'm ready to move on and get back out there, but at the same time any kind of real relationship seems scary as hell.  I guess that is a perfect storm for the hook-up scenarios you mention.    I can certainly see why many men/women purposefully avoid partners who are recently divorced.  We're in a strange state of mind to say the least.  I can say with 100% honesty that I have no clue what I'm looking for.

There is ""marital debt"" in our case where my ex was the cardholder for several of her cards and I'm the sole cardholder on some of mine. That debt is added to the pool (all of what we own is worth X, minus the debt for all cards, which gives us the final tally.)  From my lawyer's advice, the only stuff that would really get me in trouble is if I suddenly got an expensive girlfriend and made trips to Europe with her, etc. In that case, my ex is not responsible for that.  So, at the end of the day, cards I've never touched, never seen the balances on, etc. are still jointly my responsibility in terms of the overall assets and debts of the couple.  My assumption is that while it might not be easy (or a smart idea) to have her pay a card company, you should be able to get a payout for her half, with you remaining the cardholder and on the hook for the debt from the issuing bank's point of view."

In my case, it's a transfer of 401K funds to even things out. Ask your lawyer, but in the meantime be thinking of what your preference is and seriously consider how much stress you're willing to put up with waiting for her to cut checks every month, etc. (It may be none at all, but if it were me and her credit was good, I'd be looking for her to borrow the money and get a clean break.)"

Divorce,39qcqu,roundandroundrosie,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"I would do whatever is necessary to avoid an ongoing financial relationship with your ex so I would find a way to make things 50/50 through other asset transfer. For example, you'll pay off all of the credit card but you are entitled to a larger portion of the 401k to offset the debt.  Be sure to calculate interest you'll pay as part of the settlement.  If that's not possible, get it in the agreement that she will do whatever necessary to pay off her half of the debt within 60 days of the divorce being final. It is very important that you put both the date and the amount in your agreement because she probably won't do it and you'll need to go back to the judge at some point to get her to pay or place a lien on her assets. The more specific you are, the less likely you'll need a lawyer to go with you to enforce it.  Now if that's not possible, the worst option is to get it into the agreement that she will pay $xxx or more by the 15th of the month directly to you until the debt is paid off. DO NOT simply say ""STBX is responsible for half the debt"".  Then STBX can just say ""I don't have to pay each month because there's nothing that says when and how much I have to pay."""

You don't move until custody and asset divisions are settled in court. Understand?   Rule #2, you never ever start a divorce when your spouse is not working or earning substantially less. Depending on length of marruage AND state law, this locks you in a period where you'll pay spousal support. Add to this child support and you'll be SOL. Get her out working pronto!

If she is smart and has any funding she could probably get a lot of financial support out of you in court at least for a number of years. Which likely means you will have to be willing to live very simply for a while. How willing are you to sacrifice your personal comforts to get out of this marriage?  Mediation would be the most affordable solution to divorce but you guys would have to be able to agree on terms and it doesn't sound likely considering the hostility already in your marriage.

Divorce,39o5gb,anderson_buck,5,Sat Jun 13 09:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry this is happening to you.  This isn't the first time your lawyer has seen this so you should have a frank discussion with him/her and formulate a plan to go forward given the circumstances. Your lawyer can't just quit, he has to petition the court to be able to leave the case (at least that's how it is in my state). There's a lot going on here so you need to prioritize and deal with the most important things first.  As far as the criminal charge that was dismissed, don't even worry about it right now unless it will affect your employment. It's been dismissed and you have texts saying she made it up so a family court judge will blow it off as another vindictive ex.  Be wary of getting a second job, the income will be used for child support purposes so you will be locked into that as your income even if you quit later.  Have your lawyer petition the court for her to pay your fees. You probably won't get it, but it's worth a shot considering that she has a source of funds to keep this going.  In my state, if a party to a divorce is presented with an offer that is equivalent to what a judge is likely to give, it can be used as the basis for the other party to pay a larger portion of the fees because they kept the litigation going for no reason.  Is the psych eval worth it? You have to weigh the likelihood that it will get you what you want with the cost. Courts give parents, even what the general public sees as bad parents, a lot of leeway these days. You need to be relatively certain that you will get a significant benefit for the money you're going to spend.  Good luck and hang in there.

Right now her time with the kids is supposed to be supervised until the eval (but her dad does the ""supervising,"" which means not at all, so she's up all day and night yelling at and fighting with people, and texting nasty things at me). And she's stalling the eval, and is on attorney #3 (after quit/firings of the first two).  I have 1400 text messages over a few days during an Order of Protection period where she baited me to break her own order, admitted that her accusation of DV was not true, insulted the judge, and so on. That's how I got the eval order (rather than have a DV charge stick, it was dropped - BTW she assaulted me! Threatened to stab me, punched me, etc.)  I'm just scared and have no one to really talk to about it, that's all. She has more lawyer money than I have. I'm afraid she might accuse me of child abuse, plant drugs in my car, or something like that. Or win the lengthy court battle because I'm broke, or whatever. I really don't know what I'm doing.

Is anyone equipped to deal with this sort of situation, and know how to handle it? I'm doing the best I can."
Divorce,39o5gb,amentest,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"Ideally a lawyer - they are the stable element in an unstable situation.  But, for those under-represented or non-represented, the judge/mediator will be bound ethically to maintain balance and fairness.  If nothing else, remain calm and friendly in front of the judge/mediator, even when dramatic claims are being made against you (dramatic claims require dramatic evidence).  If the evidence isn't there, the claim is to fire you up and draw your attention away from what they're really after.  That is especially true with interrogatories - they can be answered with one or two words; a lot gets thrown in just to get your mind spinning on why they would ask this or that question."

Respectful would mean asking that she not bring her dates home to the house if you're still living together and fucking on the couch.  What you've done is try to make an agreement that controls her body, her sexuality, and her life.  That's  not cool, it's creepy.  So yeah, it really WAS too much to ask, and you're being an asshole about it.  Pick up your phone, call a therapist, make an appointment.  Maybe call your doctor to get some anxiety medication to help take the edge off in the meantime.  It's OK that you're hurting.  It's OK that things feel really screwed up.  It's not OK for you to fantasize about beating up her date because you're angry/sexually frustrated/feel that not agreeing to you controlling her body is rude to you."

On a personal stress level scale it's up there with having a parent die.  It's that significant.  So, it's OK to be angry.  It's OK to rant.  But you need to not project that at your stbx.  Find healthier ways to focus it and move forward with your life.  Like I said, an agreement where she doesn't bring people to the joint home you share is OK.  Controlling her body isn't.  You don't need to beat yourself up over this, you're having a bad moment and this too shall pass.  Just don't expect us to not check you if you're being a little off.  We're here to support you and help you move past this, because we're either going through it, or have been through it.  But really it sounds like some Xanax or something might do you some good in the short term until the ""OMG I'm bleeding out emotionally what the fuck do I do!?!?!?!?"" stage passes for you.  So, again.  You're OK, this is normal.  Don't beat yourself up over having a stress reaction.  It's great that you already have a therapist.

Divorce,39m7mz,Fugera,3,Sat Jun 13 01:36:44 2015 UTC,"If the intention of the separation was to repair the marriage then yes it was an absolutely acceptable thing to ask. However since your separation is there simply as a precursor to the divorce, no it was not. Part of getting divorced is that you no longer have any say in what she does or who she does it with. Would it be respectful of her to wait, absolutely, but it is not your place to ask it of her.   I know how much that can hurt but remember any ""affairs"" she has  are about her and have nothing to do with you, or her relationship with you such as it is. If you have to, go zero contact with her except for things as they relate to the divorce. And yeah, call your therapist. Anytime you feel the need to contact your STBX about something I would suggest running it by your therapist first might be a good idea, it sounds like you need a sounding board for these things."
Divorce,39m7mz,Fugera,2,Fri Jun 12 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, once you are separated and working towards a divorce, the relationship is over and each person can move on as they see fit. The paperwork is just a legal technicality.   So yes, too much to ask of her. She can be respectful of you and your past relationship and still date. This isn't mutually exclusive.   (((Hugs))) I know you are hurting. If you don't have children, then I'd suggest cease all contact. Find a great therapist and friends to help you through this. It does get better."

My STBX, 43, (who cheated on me and now lives with the Turbo Slut, 39, yes, I said 39, in her parents' basement) started telling people I was a whore because he saw a truck parked in my driveway. It was the lawn guy. But even still, he has NO right to tell me what I can or cannot do. He goes a step further by saying I am whoring myself out while my child is at home. I have been on TWO dates since he left in January BECAUSE I have full custody of my child and he only visits 1 hour a week, and I feel irresponsible asking my family to watch her while I go out.   Think that sounds dumb of him to judge me based on my perceived sex life? Well, it is dumb AND hypocritical. Just as dumb as when you say you don't want your STBX seeing other men when you're obviously no longer a couple. Stop, dude. Just go find something to do. Hell, go get laid yourself.

If you share an apartment then by all means tell her to take her man/men outside your living space (and one of you needs to get out; ideally her).

You wanna live with this? Especially someone who refuses counseling. If you two could do it better on your own, you wouldn't be in this crappy situation you're in now, right?? You know who you love? The idea of him; who you want him to be; who you just know he could be, if he'd only stop drinking/get his act together. I had to start my life over, too, when it was time for us to split. Was it hard? Heck yes. It takes a lot of time to fall out of love with the idea you have of somebody. But I have no regrets. My life got better and better as time went on. You have no idea how far away from yourself you become by living with someone like this. As time passed, I got myself back and vowed to never have an SO like that again. And I've stuck to that vow.

Honestly, if you don't have kids it is much easier to work on your own issues and find a new relationship to start over in. It's much easier to work on being more empathetic of your partner's feelings when there isn't a bunch of hurt there.

Divorce,39om06,Slowlyloosinghope,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:48:56 2015 UTC,Always being on eggshells has likely caused you to have Ptsd or ptsd like symptoms. Marriage therapy likely wont work if one person has a mental illness / alcoholism.   The reason he acts the way he does is you accepted his behavior over time. No boundries were set. Over times its just all normal to the dynamic of the relationship. It will be very very hard to reset his accepted behavior to behavior you refuse to have in your life.

And I probably would, if he would actually go see a therapist.  Because then there would be a light a the end of the tunnel.

If you're in an at-fault state I suppose that you could hire a PI but if it is no-fault you might as well forget that it won't benefit you at all.    If you're footing the bill for everything you might as well expect her to fight.  Make sure you stop putting any salary into joint accounts asap.
Divorce,39lvgd,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"So it depends upon the state you live in,  but I'd start with shoring up your financials and talking to a lawyer.

Divorce,39lvgd,TheEarlShibe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"Get the, ""we are getting a divorce"" conversation out of the way.  Ask her what, if any, debt she is willing to take on post divorce.  Hopefully, you'll just be able to agree on what you will pay and what she will pay.  That way you don't have to worry about alimony, or her paying you to pay debt.  You'll notify your creditors of the terms of the divorce and most are pretty reasonable and will release you from any responsibility.  Some won't though.  I know you want to save money, but you may end up losing a lot more if you do not at least consult with an attorney."

I guess I'm more curious than hopeful about this scenario."
Divorce,39lvgd,Redmacleod,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:47:15 2015 UTC,"In most divorces (sorry I'm in California), there is a division of property and debts at the end of the divorce.  The Court will order that you get the house and she gets the car, you get the sofa, she gets the bed, etc.  This also happens with debts, ""you get the visa, and I get the AMEX"" to pay off.  If you don't agree, then you have to go to Court to get the Court to order who gets what.  Since you are the sole breadwinner, if you do not agree, chances are you may get stuck with everything.  I supposed it depends on the state and if you are in an ""at fault"" state.  So many rules!  This is why you need an attorney.    As to releasing you from responsibility, I work for creditors who sometimes let folks go pursuant to court orders.  Sometimes they don't.  It all depends.  Just call your creditors and ask.  Good luck!"

Staying together, honoring your vows, maintaining a two-parent family, these are false cis-gendered, traditionalist, patriarchal constructs which must be destroyed if the right kind of people are ever to create the right kind of world. The grass may not be greener but it's different grass and it's important for children to learn that a diversity of grass is better than tending existing grass. Better for a child to learn that getting ones way is far more important than learning to be happy where one is. If one relationship doesn't get you off, maybe the next one will, or the next one, or the one after that. Hey! Maybe you can get off lots and lots of times. Chase that high! It's all about the journey.  OP could be escaping something serious. If so, please disregard my screed and get the fuck out immediately."

My ex isn't a Batman villain, she's just most comfortable belonging to what I see as a growing cohort of self-entitled, hypergamous, upper-middle-class (because inheritance...not achievement), white ladies. Surely there are women out there who aren't like this and maybe, just maybe, I'll meet a woman like this, and she'll fall in love with me, and we'll live happily ever after.  In the meantime, this misguided but trendy woman is the primary custodial parent of our child. It sucks for me because I love this woman despite her failings and have for twenty years. The knowledge that she was, for at least eight of those years just not that into me hurts. Seeing this kind of behavior all over the damned place and seeing it presented as something healthy and enlightened really pisses me off.  When I see it here, I feel like raging against it since raging against my ex to my ex won't change anything. Also, I enjoy pointing out things that make people uncomfortable, especially when what I'm saying I believe has the benefit of being true.

Shortly thereafter it seems I traded the love for anger... I think that was progress, but I'm not sure.  It's been 13 months since the separation and 7 months since the divorce was final. These days I deal with consistent irritation over my ex due to co-parenting issues, but most of the anger is gone.   Every once in a while something happens and I might feel hurt or just kind of wistful... and of course she is liable to piss me off for a couple hours or so, but otherwise I'm in a far better place.  Obviously your mileage will vary, but grief isn't usually a short-term thing and it can't be rushed. If you aren't seeing a therapist and you have the ability to do so, I would highly recommend it."
Divorce,39lk6z,GrandEthos,4,Fri Jun 12 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"I think for some people sex is intimately tied to love.  And for some of us (Including me) it is not.  Sex as a biological function is useful for me in moving on, as it removes a point of frustration from my life and it is a pretty awesome stress reliever.  The best thing for me in regards to companionship until I was ready to date was honestly my dogs.  Keep in mind that dating doesn't necessarily mean relationship.  You can make friends that you like hanging out with, and maybe you like them enough to sleep with them to fulfill that personal need (if you have that need) as well.  But nothing is required in the name of having a serious relationship.  My divorce was final on Monday of last week.  I've finally started dating people,  but I tell them up front what I'm looking for (Friends, sex is nice but really I need friends.) and that I'm not in a place to have a serious relationship.  If they can't respect that, I'll just have to stop seeing them.  The general rule of thumb is a year to heal enough to have a real relationship.  We're not all the same, we don't have the same kind of divorce, or if there are drawn-out/lingering issues they can affect our healing time and rate as well.  Honestly, it sounds like what you really need is a friend whose shoulder you can cry on, and who will encourage you to heal more than a boyfriend."

Divorce,39lk6z,soapydansk,2,Fri Jun 12 16:32:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remind yourself that in addition to the fact that sometimes people choose not-so-healthy ways to deal with things, everyone also deals with grief and self-preservation differently. For some people, quickly having sex can be a signal of NOT truly moving on—for others it's not a big deal. u/TheEarlShibe is right that the emotional component of sex is more important for some than others, and while it may not be entirely possible, try hard not to think about what you need and want in comparison to what he's doing (I still have plenty of work to do in this arena myself)."

I thought ""Wow, she's already moved on from me.""  And that kind of hurt, but then I found out she'd been having an affair and that made more sense.  Now she's just pinballing from one person to the next desperately seeking comfort and affection.  I made a conscious effort to not date until my divorce was final, and that actually includes sleeping with anyone.  I could have gone out and gotten laid any time I wanted had I chosen to.  I decided to just deal with it.  Last week at this time I was crawling the walls because I felt isolated and alone.  Now I find myself I craving me time, because too many people are vying for my attention now. (Or really person keeps trying to force a connection that I can't, and won't make right now.)"
Divorce,39lk6z,soapydansk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"My divorce is nowhere near final (stbx told me he was leaving me 3 months ago, we live in a state where uncontested requires 12-month separation, and he dropped it on me with no warning so I told him I refuse to file against him), and when we first separated I envisioned staying single and just doing me for at least six months.  After a month, I started to feel like I'd been cheated out of physical intimacy for a long time since he just bailed, and realized I had some pent-up sexual energy to get out. So I waded into the scene a bit, and also just to prove to myself what I knew rationally, which was that there are nice guys out there. (My therapist is aware of everything I do so she tells me if there are red flags for her.)  I ended up meeting someone who is amazing. I'm--and we're--very cautious given my situation. For me, it's been really helpful because while of course another person or another spark doesn't make you get over someone, regardless of what happens with him he's given me a glimpse of some of the really healthy things that are possible in a relationship that I'm totally capable of and that were seriously stunted in my marriage."
Divorce,39lk6z,TheEarlShibe,2,Fri Jun 12 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"I generally refer to that as the ""Fuck you for projecting your problems on me and making me feel inadequate!"" sex.  I've been there, after my first divorce I slept with a bunch of women just to prove to myself that I was desirable.  (My first wife including the wedding night, and honeymoon slept with me 5 times in 2 years.  I can't tell you how many nights I cried myself to sleep over that.)  Sometimes the universe will just sort of drop the right person into your path at the right time.  And you can express a whole new world of things that you didn't know were inside of you.

Divorce,39ik2i,Cooter1990,3,Thu Jun 11 23:28:27 2015 UTC,You can't fix her. Only she can change how she communicates. I know you're hurting right now but I'd she's not willing to help and work on the relationship not only is she not coming back but you're probably better off without her.
Divorce,39ik2i,Catcherofsouls,3,Fri Jun 12 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"I am sort of in the same situation. My wife finally told me she didn't have romantic feelings for me, we still live together but she is defiantly leaning towards the outside of our marriage and feels as if she would rather leave but doesn't want to hurt me.  We thought of counseling but the hard fact is that we would both approach traditional counseling with different agendas so we are looking at discernment counseling which is a shorter counseling session that attempts to determine where each person is in deciding to leave or stay and if there is hope for traditional counseling.  If she is willing to do something like that it might be something to try. But, this is a very hard pill to swallow, you cannot ultimately make your wife love you again. I would also say you can't fault her either because lets face it the same feelings that our wives are saying right now are the same feelings that said she loved us and married us and to fault those feelings is like saying well why did you love me in the first place and I personally don't want to say that.  So the final statement is, you can raise up the idea of this type of counseling possible, or traditional counseling, but if she is not willing there is not a lot you can do. But I would highly recommend maybe even you go to counseling alone to help deal with your feelings through the process.  I wish the best for us both."

Divorce,39jilt,Offthepoint,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:21:01 2015 UTC,"The best thing to do is interview 3-5 lawyers over a couple of weeks.  Ask for recommendations from friends.  When you interview, just be honest with them about what you're doing, what you're looking for in a lawyer, and what you want from the process.  Make sure you let them know you're interviewing other lawyers before making a decision.  Many times, people forget that the attorney is not in charge.  He works for you, not the other way around.  Treat it like a job interview, you're getting ready to hire him to help you.  The sharks/shysters will promise you sun and the moon (you'll get full custody, no child support or alimony and keep the house!) without having spent any time gathering facts about your case.  Or they'll listen for 5-10 minutes, wave their hand dismissively and tell you ""my retainer is $5,000 to work with you"" and get up and walk out shortly after that.  A competent attorney who has your best interests at heart will listen to you, ask a few general questions, and will then give you a reasonable answer about what they can do/are willing to do.  They will tell you what their fee structure/retainer looks like, but they'll also tell you what you should realistically expect from the process.  A really good one will have empathy for you, and make a connection with you on that level.  They won't overpromise anything, but they will commit to representing you well.  Once you've talked to a few of them, you'll have a much better feel for who you want to work with.  If you don't like any of them, start over.  Nothing has to be done today."
Divorce,39jilt,LaTuFu,0,Fri Jun 12 13:29:41 2015 UTC,"The math isn't that complicated.  How long have you been married?  Number of years married, generally divided by 2 and that is how many years worse case you'll pay alimony.  Kids involved?  25% of gross pay for 2 kids till they're 18 or graduate highschool.  Depending on the state you're in, it's either alimony for life or not depending on how many years married.  I'm not a lawyer but you should get one, and you get what you pay for but typically, it's not that complicated.  Sell everything, split the debt, assets and future income.  Get A lawyer, preferably a lawyer who another man in your area recommended."

I understand the math; that isn't the issue.   I'm not a lawyer but you should get one, and you get what you pay for but typically, it's not that complicated.   I plan to get one.  I've already consulted with two: one was a shark, and I didn't want to loose him upon my wife who, regardless of the situation, I do love.  Unfortunately, she is also being driven by her grandmother to do some pretty nasty things.  So far, she's refused, but she is unfortunately susceptible to this sort of suggestion because she was raised by her grandmother and I don't know how long she'll be able to resist her encouragement to, among other things, try to take our child and file a protective order.   Get A lawyer, preferably a lawyer who another man in your area recommended.   Unfortunately, I don't know very many people in this area, so a recommendation isn't readily available.  Even if it was, that's just the opinion of, frankly, another uninformed person.  I was hoping that perhaps some divorce attorneys and/or similarly-experienced folks might be able to chime in about these things.  I'm trying to determine what the best way to find a competent (perhaps even good) lawyer is, and how to determine if the one I find is/isn't good.  What are the signs of a good lawyer?

So don't hand the fireing squad any bullets.  Go down town to your local pubs where there's a 40's 50's year old crowd.  You'll get some recommendations on lawyers there for sure.  There is not going to be any websites out there that suggest any one particular lawyer is bad.  It's mostly word of mouth.

You aren't obligated to make her wishes come true. On the other hand this is always something you can negotiate with for a later date.

For the insurance money in case you don't make it back?  And what does marriage mean to you? This is my vagina no one can touch it but me? Oh by the way I'm going to be gone 99% of the time.

Staying with the same person for a long period of time becomes boring... and expensive when you get to court.  So even if you wait and wait and wait in order to be together chances are you'll be together temporarily as you'll see if you read what some of the other advice seekers' posts.  You have no idea at this time whether or not you'll be compatible to even make it through the first couple years let alone months.  The other thing I learned is it's fun to meet new people and get to know them and learn from them. This holds true with both sexes.    Until the original poster settles down into something like a teaching job and starts dating another settled down teacher, AND after they live together for about 10 years I would suggest he not rush out into another marriage.  I've seen people wait and wait and wait to be together only to find out they don't like being together.  Lets face it, men are primarily motivated by sex. Secondarily all the other yada yada yada.

Divorce,39jrly,TheEarlShibe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"Hello to All of Those Who have Commented and May in the Future,  I apologize for the delay in response, it has been an exceptionally busy week at my duty location.  To answer the deployment and time away items; I was only away from home approximately 25% of the time due to what my unit's primary mission was. I agree that most men are motivated by the though of a sexual relationship, and I'm not saying that I wasn't at the beginning, but I did truly love and care for her even after the first instance of adultery.  With regards to the 50/50 split, my wife contributed approximately 20% to the overall relationship. Much of the time I was taking care of her both physically and emotionally. Fortunately for me, there were no children involved despite her desperately wanting a baby girl. My stipulation was that she finish college or find a career that she truly enjoyed and then make the decision to have children. I didn't want her to have regrets after having a child. At the moment, I have not had contact with her for at least a month. My personal support system has been overwhelmingly positive and helpful, but to the one person that I no longer call a friend out of this situation, the last time I saw him, he couldn't even look me in the eye or give me a straight truthful answer.  American English is my first language, but I have worked diligently over the years to maintain the skills that I learned throughout my forming year. Then again, I did grow up in rural parts of Alaska and it was always important to communicate well; especially since my grandmother doesn't speak any form of English well as Tagalog is her native tongue.  Unfortunately with everything in mind, it has affirmed my thoughts on the marriage system that we use. I do not plan on marrying again, but in the eventual event that I do start dating again, I will work towards the notion that living together free of the legal paperwork will be better. That way if the other person doesn't want to continue on, they can take their stuff and move on.  Thank you for your comments and for reading my thoughts,   Snerrak -    To rasconjon, not all military members need to curse up a storm to try to make a statement. Through my work I have found that saying items free from expletives comes across better and easier. I do curse a fair amount when I am with very good friends or at video games in the event that I make a poor choice occurs, but other than that, there is no real need to curse in person or online. This is just my personal view on the subject though."

Divorce,39h95y,lowpak26,5,Thu Jun 11 18:26:28 2015 UTC,She was ordered by the court to turn the property over.   If she had not done so she is in contempt of those orders.   You might be in for another trip to court.
Divorce,39h95y,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"Indeed, she is in contempt. I guess my question is, so what? What is the court going to do/how do I get my things back? So far the judge has said he is very disappointed and fully expects her to comply. Nothing happened.  If I go back to court what can the court possibly do to get my things back to me?"
Divorce,39h95y,fatheroftwoboys,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"In Texas, she'd get time to make up her wrong deed first. Then, she'd have a fine. Finally, she'd maybe get some jail time. Usually, they comply.   Problem is the usual ""cost of taking her to court"" vs. ""Cost of your stuff"" deal. Most good lawyers will tell you $1,500 ain't worth it."
Divorce,39h95y,ilovedean,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:50:48 2015 UTC,"You can always request the police to go there with you and show them your decree and see if she'd allow them and you to enter for your belongings. Otherwise, she is in contempt of the order and while it'll probably cost you more money in the long run, for those sentimental items it'd be worth it."
Divorce,39h95y,ilovedean,2,Thu Jun 11 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"Been there done that. She moved most of it to storage (I don't know the location) and the police as empathetic as they have been, won't actually force entry without specific court orders instructing them to do so. All she does is tell the cops she doesn't have the stuff. And contempt doesn't actually 'do' anything, just a waste of my time and money since a finding of contempt doesn't get my belongings back.  I guess I'm looking for the next step, if there are any, thanks."

Divorce,39fw56,LaTuFu,7,Thu Jun 11 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"It's generally recommended that you not do it, for a variety of reasons.  Practically speaking, it will prevent drama issues and unnecessary distractions in the mediation/settlement process.  If your STBX finds out about it, and most of the time they do, it will usually trigger some sort of reaction from her that makes the process more difficult and/or emotionally/financially draining to complete.    Emotionally, you're more damaged by this than you may realize.  Even if you think this step is the best choice for your life, it is still an emotionally draining and difficult experience.  Dating during the healing period will create a lot more issues than it solves.    The loneliness sucks, there is no doubt about that.  But it is a necessary part of the healing process."
Divorce,39fw56,mcatech,3,Thu Jun 11 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"My STBX is on her way right now to meet up with a guy she's been talking to for months that she has had feelings for.  She almost missed her flight last night because she thought that flying out of an airport in a different state would be cheaper than flying out of an airport in our home state.  (It was, but it wasn't convenient.  She wanted either her kids (my stepkids) or I to drive her to the airport in the other state).  So, she wants to date other people.  I, on the other hand, right now do not.  But I know that the loneliness will suck, but moving in with my parents while I reset my life will help some."
Divorce,39fw56,doublenut,3,Thu Jun 11 14:51:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't divorce until the relationship was long over. I didn't really have any emotional fallout from the divorce, and there wasn't a lot of time between separating and when it was final. I did date in the interim, nothing serious, and I was discreet. There were no repercussions."
Divorce,39fw56,lowpak26,3,Thu Jun 11 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes we feel like we're BAD PEOPLE if we want to date or live a normal life during separation. About 18 months into my separation I decided to stop believing I was a BAD PERSON if I went on a date or had a beer, that things like that were OK, and that I would be 100% ok if I was behaving in a way that if the judge happened to be at the bar I wouldn't have to worry.  Of course my ex freaked out and made a huge issue out of it. Thing is, she was making huge issues out of nothing before and continues to do it to this day, so who knows if it actually changed anything or not.  If you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to hide. You still have EVERYTHING to fear because the world is by it's nature an unjust place.  Having said all that, make sure you're emotionally ready like other posters have mentioned. That can make things way worse rather than better..."
Divorce,39fw56,kipela,3,Thu Jun 11 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the circumstances. My STBX and I live in Australia and its a 12 month wait before you can file. She hooked up behind my back before we officially separated, on the actual official separation night with a random, and this is ongoing as far as I know.  I spent 3 months sorting myself, my son and assets out, but even I surprised myself I was mentally ready after that amount of time. Everyone is different.  I connected with a fantastic woman going through exactly the same thing, same date of separation. Everything. It's uncanny how much we've helped each other heal. We're moving strongly independently but also as a new couple."
Divorce,39fw56,soapydansk,2,Fri Jun 12 07:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation. I can kind of understand people's cautioning against it since so many people really aren't ready, but we're all different. Dating can be fine."
Divorce,39fw56,im-obsolete,2,Sat Jun 13 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"A friend on mine had a one night stand while separated and it turned into a nightmare.  The texts started coming in, requests for more dates, way too much to handle when you're already emotionally drained and your focus should be elsewhere."
Divorce,39fw56,onwardnow,2,Thu Jun 11 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"You definitely need time to heal before you're ready to jump into another relationship.  And it sucks, but that's the truth of the matter.  You need to get to a place where you're in a good relationship because it works, not because of necessity to fill a void of being lonely.  I've been separated for a year and a half now and only now feel like I'm getting to a point where I'm content to be alone and satisfied with my situation.  I still do have bad days where I'm lonely but I don't feel the overwhelming urge to HAVE to have someone.  I've gone out with female friends but just as friends, although maybe you could call a few 'dates'?  My good friends have counseled me to wait until the divorce is final before pursuing anything seriously (or even casual sex) just to avoid complicating things.    I did find out that my STBX has been seeing someone (don't know if it's serious or just a FWB) for several months now and I'm still struggling with that.  I know it's none of my business what she does in her own time (thankfully the kids don't know) but it still really really bothers me that she's sleeping with someone else.  I'm sure she thinks I'm doing the same thing so that's her justification.  But bottom line is probably not a good idea, but people do it anyway."
Divorce,39fw56,ohwell65,2,Thu Jun 11 15:15:27 2015 UTC,My attorney told me DO NOT under any circumstances go find a woman to drag back to the house and hook up with her even though it was my stbx that was having the affair and wanted the divorce. His reasoning was that it could inspire some bad behavior in the stbx and make her more unreasonable to deal with if she drove by what used to be her home and saw I had a sleepover going. His advice: if you want to hook up go to the adjacent city and drop a $150 on a hotel room and hook up to your hearts content.

Just one less than that anyone can try to throw in your face... Good luck."
Divorce,39fw56,amentest,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"Though my ex initiated the divorce she got annoyed when I took a woman half my age to Vegas. This lead to more hassles over everything, kids, money, custody.  So the more miserable you are or can fake, the better off you will be during the divorce process.  Stay off facebook!!! Be discrete.  Date away.  Realize though drama awaits you.  There's a tradeoff for addressing loneliness."
Divorce,39fw56,imissdancing,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"Wait to date until after you are divorced. Think of it this way: There is a light at the end of your relationship tunnel. Once the end is reached you can branch out and date and have fun. Yes, the waiting is going to be frustrating, but jumping into the dating pool right now can have some rather nasty consequences."
Divorce,39fw56,ImReallyStoked,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:42:16 2015 UTC,"My ex and I still have a month before court. I was holding off dating to grow myself back to a place where I could actually give someone some value. I found out my ex was dating and it hurt to hear it. Then I found out it was someone we work with. I work at a hospital in a different unit than her. It was much harder to hear that. I was going to accept her dating until I found out it was a coworker. So I may be bias. But here is the facts. She's moved on. I was trying to move on, but maybe at a slower pace. She is a very sexual person. With prior experience splitting up in the past, I know it's how she finds independence. Yes I think it's screwed up. But it's what she knows and I can't blame her. Did I stop the friendship, you but your buns. But she has to face her own recovery. Just as I have to face mine. If you think you need it, go for it. You're single now. But beware what is healthy and what can backfire."

Divorce,39fw56,Slowlyloosinghope,6,Thu Jun 11 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm sure it would be a giant mess in the end. I mostly just miss affection. My STBX wasn't affectionate for the last 2 years. I just really want someone to cuddle up with to watch a movie.  I'm not looking to find another wife, I just want to have a little fun sometimes and feel like Somebody is interested in me.  I have actually been flirting with 2 woman and both have offered to ""come over"" I have said no both times.  I just feel fucking crazy."

Divorce,39fw56,GrandEthos,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:10:13 2015 UTC,"Adopt a dog, seriously.  They're always happy to see you, they're always happy to cuddle, they don't create drama you don't need during your divorce, and it gives you something safe to bond to emotionally.  I waited until the paperwork was filed and we were into our waiting period before I even started talking to women just as friends.  About 2 weeks before the divorce was final I created an OK Cupid profile to start talking to people and get an idea of what dating would look like for me.  But outside of a platonic breakfast date the day before my divorce was final I didn't actually go on any dates until it was all said and done.  And those dates are still fairly casual things, as I'm not in a place to have a relationship with anyone on any deep level just yet.  I get where you're at, but if you really need to have sex you're better off with some sort of friends with benefits relationship because anything more is going to be damaged by your divorce, your state of mind, and it will in turn make your divorce harder for you in the end."
Divorce,39hkp4,TEDshutsthefuckup,13,Thu Jun 11 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, my friend. And I mean this in a non-judgmental way. You don't ""just want her to be happy."" Your, independent, wants are very important to you. It's why you permit yourself to cheat. 5 of 6 paragraphs begin with the word ""I"". You're focusing on you.  And you think you'll be better off without her. Frankly, you don't value her that much. You mention she's older, she makes less money, she allows you to cheat and stays with you ... you don't respect her and don't value her. I'm not saying you don't love her and feel empathetic pain for her, I'm saying you don't value her right now. Maybe you never have.  You've been together for nine years. If you haven't tried therapy, I would. Come to grips with whats really happening because your perception strikes me as a bit delusionally self-serving. Good luck."

If the girl you cheated with is still in your lives that has to stop. Neither of you is getting any benefit to having her in your lives and in all honesty she's probably adding to any emotional issues both of you may be having.   Actually put some work in to yourself and your marriage through therapy before you just throw in the towel. Reasons like ""She'll be happier without me."" or ""I deserve to be alone."" are complete bullshit and will not stop her heart from breaking."

My feelings aside.  Please see a marriage counselor. For your sake. And for her sanity. Leaving without cleaning shop makes it harder to clean the mess when/if the two of you separate.  Be honest, you want freedom to live a self serving life. Don't tell her what will or won't make her happy. You can't make decisions for people, it's not your job.  If you use drugs or alcohol in an abusive way, then get clean before making decisions that could alter your life negatively.

Basically mourning all the things she had in the marriage that she won't have anymore, a little late to think about that I feel. The fact that she talks to me about it just makes me question her awareness of what all happened in the last year and a half.  I am indifferent to ketchup. On a burger, brat, or hot dog it's fine but I don't need it on anything else. As far as the above goes if there's an alternative available like fresh tomatoes or salsa I'll take that. Also the sheer amount of High Fructose Corn Syrup in there is impressive.  Everyone knows you put Hot sauce or Salsa on eggs and anything less is just juvenile.

Divorce,39fu2l,amentest,0,Thu Jun 11 13:19:05 2015 UTC,"Do you have a lawyer? Every state is different.  But the gist of alimony is equalization of salaries.  You make 100 an hour and she makes 10 for example and you'll be forking over 40 so you both earn 50.  For how long? For life if you live in states like Florida, NJ and CA and if married over 10 years.  For most other states it's the number of years married divided by 2.  If she gets married   the spousal support ends.  But don't count on that happening. Oh yeah and if over 20 years married it's alimony for life, or as Robin Williams used to say, allthemoney. So if her lawyer is asking for whatever he's asking for it's probably not a good deal for you.  Get your own lawyer. That's the name of the marriage game."

Divorce,39fu2l,Catcherofsouls,-2,Thu Jun 11 13:41:51 2015 UTC,Right. Because politicians are beholden to the legal establishment.

You will also have to continue paying even if your ex remarries.  Benefits... Ex can't come after you when you get raises.  As far as a buyout, that could have serious tax implications. A lot of time, lump sum alimony ends up not being tax deductible in the eyes of the IRS so you HAVE to talk to a tax professional about the ramifications.  When my ex asked for non-modifiable alimony, I said I'd only pay half the number of years that I had previously offered as modifiable. They balked.  We eventually settled on modifiable alimony and I was fine with that knowing that I wasn't likely to change jobs and the raises I get wouldn't trigger a ""significant change in circumstances"" anytime soon so she wouldn't be able to take me back for modification."

Plus we had one nice car which I bought 3 months before the wedding that was old and appreciated and she got half when the court ordered it sold, and the money from the sale of our apartment building. The real way that she's paying her legal expenses is that her lawyers 2 and 3 took her on minimal retainer because she convinced them we were rich (see this 4-unit apartment building and classic car? he has millions more stashed away!) and they never got paid. She in court said she has no intentions of ever paying them because 'she can't'. That's now a civil matter so the family court judge really doesn't care. Her current attorney is cheap, but a real bulldog. A caricature of himself, knows how to waste the court's time and milk his client with enough results to keep her coming back. Again, it takes very little to file paperwork to go to court on literally nothing, but every time I have to have my lawyer prep ($) and show up to court ($$$) regardless of the outcome."

This is part of the reason I came here and now I've got a small collection of extremely good friends... and a couple of people who tolerate me (god only knows why  - scratch that, god probably has no clue either).  You feel now as many of us have and later you will feel as many of us do. You aren't alone, not unless you choose to be - and sometimes that's also a necessary part of the grieving process.  If you're not afraid of real-world humans like I am, make it a point to get out and live some life. Everyone will pile in here and tell you to get a hobby or go to the gym or get a lawyer and don't eat paint chips (without queso)...   I'm just going to add to keep posting, it really does help.  ...screw you guys, that chips/queso thing was funny..."

Leave the door open for her to come back once she realizes the guy she likes is just looking for sex.  Lobby for yourself to get full placement yet pay her child support as if she had half placement. This sets a precident you can revisit 6 months down the line.  You are going through something very common.  It's not a reflection on you.  But you are not used to being alone and you don't feel whole unless you have all the pieces in place, father head of a household, provider.  I understand your pain.  Life is a game of chess.

He knows that his alcoholism is what caused this, I do not need to inflict more pain by reminding him of it.   It sounds like you are being reflective on what went wrong and that will be helpful for you in the future not to repeat the same mistakes. Go to personal therapy, pick up a new hobby, go out and meet people. Do things to care for yourself right now.

Either way, she sounds like she is not a healthy person. She is at least Immature. I hope you realize you both are the reason your marriage didn't work.

It sounds like she's bringing out anything she can possibly find wrong with the marriage to justify her decision in asking for a divorce. So yes she is rewriting history to show only the bad and terrible side of the marriage.   Get a therapist, you're being emotionally abused and you need a neutral third party to talk to about everything that's going on. Being bad at picking up social queues and intimacy issues are common issues that people have. It's no reason to crucify you over.   If you don't have kids it's time to go no contact with her."

Divorce,39dtdv,skippydudeah,2,Thu Jun 11 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"To add to this... If you have problems being intimate, you may not have a bunch of friends.  Talking to someone that you can trust and that you fear no back stabbing from about what is happening is going to be really big for you.  Just opening up and talking about things will be a major step.  And that is what it is all about: steps.  One foot in front of the other.  Don't be discouraged if you don't make major strides in the first session.  It is going to take time.  After a while, you'll look back, see your path and be like, ""Hell, I've come a long way."""

Divorce,39aovo,hubbyofhoarder,2,Thu Jun 11 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"Why are you giving her the flexibility on those things. One thing I've learned is that its easy to give something but its damn hard to reclaim it back. The flexibility you're giving up is spoiling her even though you think you're being nice.   Give an inch, lose a mile."
Divorce,39aovo,hubbyofhoarder,3,Wed Jun 10 14:54:11 2015 UTC,"The only thing I would add to that, is that after a long period of sticking to the agreement like glue, an occasional bit of flexibility is fine.  It's always a judgment call; if you're getting constant short notice changes, cut it off, and live by the letter of the agreement, full stop.  If you haven't had a request to change or problem for months, a one-off change isn't worth an argument."

You have an agreement in place and if she's going to be crazy when you're being nice, then don't be nice, just follow the letter of the law.

Divorce,39aovo,hubbyofhoarder,2,Wed Jun 10 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"Sticking with the letter of the agreement keeps such problems to a minimum.

Since my divorce is dragging on, I'm doing some things out of spite because she's done the same to me. If she had asked me well in advance of when she wanted a visit, I may have granted it.

Divorce,39bm80,im-obsolete,2,Wed Jun 10 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"We bought our house at roughly 250K and it recently appraised for 200K. We have about 20K equity in the house. She has stated that she doesn't agree with the appraisal and would not be willing to let me buy it from her at that price. She wants to get another appraisal.   If either one of you keeps the house, there will be disagreement on the house's value.   Either sell it outright and split any gain/loss from the sale or tell her that you will let her have the house based on a certain selling price (with her giving you half of the calculated equity), if she says that is too much, offer to take the house at that price and give her half of the equity.  Sounds like the house is worth somewhere between 200 and 250, say another appraisal comes in at 210.  Offer to let her have it at that price, she owes you half of the equity.   If she turns it down, then tell her that you want the house at that price and offer her half the equity.  Or sell the house outright.   "" But she insists this is what she will need to maintain her standard of living and won't budge.""   Her standard of living was based on your 90k in income, this is a non-starter. Her standard of living will most likely go down.  Get an attorney to walk you through things.   Good luck.  Edit : 20% of your combined income is around $26 thousand, means that childcare costs are about $500 week for that standard of living.  With split custody (say every other week), this means that in the week you have them (since you earn about twice what she does), she should be giving you about 1/3 of that, in the week that she has them she should get about 2/3 of that amount. After stuff nets out, you should be giving her about 1/3 of $500 times 26 per year or about $4333 per year if custody is split 50/50.  There are other things that will factor in, things like school expenses, health insurance, medical costs that may reduce that amount.   Another way of calculating this is to assume that both parties use 20% of their pay for childcare.  She should be spending about $8000, you should be spending about $18000.  With custody split equally, you should be giving her about 1/2 of the difference, about $5000 per year (she spends $13 when the kids are with her, you spend $13 when the kids are with you)."

Divorce,39bm80,landofmisfits,2,Thu Jun 11 02:03:00 2015 UTC,To cause a battle and increase his fees
Divorce,39bm80,anderson_buck,2,Thu Jun 11 03:10:06 2015 UTC,"This is the big problem with the divorce industry. The lawyer gets paid more when there's more conflict. If she thinks she has a better chance of getting the kids the majority of the time, she'll keep fighting and the lawyer will keep getting paid all while being able to say he's only doing what his client wants."
Divorce,39bm80,anderson_buck,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:49:14 2015 UTC,"Even at the risk of losing the case?   Also, when considering custody would a judge care that she agreed to split custody then reneged when she didn't get the money that she wanted?  Would it be important to show that we countered with something fair?"
Divorce,39bm80,anderson_buck,2,Thu Jun 11 12:50:37 2015 UTC,"Even at the risk of losing the case?   I'll answer this for both sides...  If your lawyer truly thinks it's a toss up and has no clue what might happen, I'd start grilling them. Your lawyer should have enough experience to be able to give you a likely outcome that's better than ""it's a toss up"". That answer is completely unacceptable. All courts have tendencies one way or the other, your lawyer should know what those tendencies are.  For the other side...  Some spouses don't think about whether they might lose because they're so convinced they won't. This is both good and bad for you.  Good because they're being irrational and it could help your case. Also bad, because they're being irrational and will run up your bill.  For example, I wouldn't move out of our house unless my ex agreed to 50/50 timesharing. Her whole case was ""I'm the mom and the kids should be with the mom.""  I told her I'd pay the temp support she wanted without question as long as she agreed to 50/50 and then I'd move out.  She said no even after I found three places to live that would have allowed me to move out in a week.  She said no each time. When we went for our temp hearing, the first thing her lawyer said was ""Your Honor, the children are female so they should be with their mom.""  The judge smiled and said ""So if they were boys they should go with the father?"" Her lawyer just started stuttering and said ""Maybe"".  Their case was sunk.  I left with 50/50 timesharing and had to pay her 20% less than I had been offering for the previous 6 months.  Your job is to not be emotional and see this as the business negotiation that it is.  You want to avoid court, but sometimes it isn't possible. What's important to her? Figure that out and make an offer that you can live with that will end it.    Also, when considering custody would a judge care that she agreed to split custody then reneged when she didn't get the money that she wanted? Would it be important to show that we countered with something fair?   In my state, prior negotiations aren't admissible. If you don't have anything signed, then you didn't have an agreement in the eyes of the court."
Divorce,39bm80,anderson_buck,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:08:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome advice thank you!  We are separated and currently have a 50/50 split, the kids stay in the house and we rotate living there.   For her I truly belive that it comes down to money, but over time she seems to have convinced herself that she deserves full custody.    Her latest lines are that she had proof of the awful way that I treat her (my wife) which will prove I'm a bad person, which might be a recorded phone conversation or something.  Also she says if we split custody there is no guarantee that I will provide the basic necessities for the children, laughable at best.   So she's trying her best to dredge-up excuses to justify asking for full custody.  And she has said that even if I agree to the contact that she drew up a few months ago it's no longer valid because I took too long with it."
Divorce,39atph,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Wed Jun 10 14:21:04 2015 UTC,"She says she's going to tell the judge how I'm not cooperative, how I'm using the boys to abuse her (?!), and how sports is good for kids.   Great!  Then the judge will ask her, or your lawyer can point out, whether she consulted you before doing this and she'll be seen as the manipulative ex that she is.  Your job right now is to decide if this battle is worth fighting or if this is a good thing for your kid.  What you HAVE to do, is get an agreement in place that says that both parents must agree on extracurricular activities.  If you don't agree, the parent who wants the activity has to foot 100% of the bill, be responsible for all transportation, and you are perfectly within your right to have the child not go during your time."

Ah, that's a good point. My stbx might try to exercise that option to get out of paying for extracurricular activities for my sons. It only punishes them, so if I have to foot the bill myself, I will. I've requested she pay 50% of everything. She's already mentioned she ""didn't agree"" to some of them, so she'll balk. Like I'm going to be the one who tells my sons, ""Sorry, you can't do XXXX because Mom won't pay her half."" Nope, it will just be me keeping my second job that much longer. :-/"

Not trying to start a flame war but I have yet to see any judge throw the book at anyone for much of anything.

I'm dealing with a control freak. If I give her this inch, she'll take another, and another, and another, and another. I'm trying to protect my time.  She must ask me before planning over my time.

It's rude. It's a manipulative ploy. She is that wicked, proven.  I spent years being codependent and avoiding conflict at all costs by being pliable. No more.  After the false accusations, the police, jail time, etc. I'm done being nice. I was able to get out of trouble by showing irrefutable evidence that she's a liar, who will do anything she can to punish me. This is fact. I never did anything she claimed. Never cheated on her.

And once I did, I pretty much controlled the conversation.   The first time I called, it was just to let them know that we were separated and getting a divorce.  I didn't want to answer any questions, go into any details, nothing.  I just wanted them to know what was going on and tell them how the kids were being cared for and that was it.  I told them that I would talk more about it when I was ready and they respected my wishes."

In most states, everything is split down the middle...net after liabilities are paid off.  From what you describe, you essentially have nothing to divide.  The house isn't worth anything because of the negative equity, the vehicles are probably only worth about what you owe.    There will be no expensive trial here.

The only time there is a ""legal battle"" with lawyers is when one or both sides don't want to be amicable.   If you're both in agreement and both have the same goals for the process, then it is a simple matter of find an attorney to draft the agreement, make sure the language is suitable to both of you, and have the attorney file all of the documents.  $500-$1,500 to use an attorney in an amicable situation most likely."

Divorce,3988a7,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Wed Jun 10 01:50:29 2015 UTC,You should really look into getting a separate therapist for you and your wife to go to together. The problem with seeing a therapist who is also the individuals therapist is that it can make the other person (you) feel ganged up on during sessions. Really the best way to approach therapy in a marriage is that each person has their own individual therapist and a third therapist to work with together.

I have never cheated on her and this is not about rushing out and getting laid with some other woman. We're both still young and I think we could both be happier in the long run with different types of people. It really sucks.

You're always going to feel that in a relationship you haven't committed to. It's a way out, a justification for not making the choice of loving, supporting, and choosing that person every day of the rest of your life. New love is always going to be more exciting because it's new, you learn new things about a person, and well hormones. Long term love though, like /u/MLH205 said it becomes a choice to commit to that person because they are your partner in life.   It's time to choose what's important to you in life and what you are truly committed to in life. There isn't going to be a flash of light in the sky or a deep knowledge in your bones that this is your destiny, you choose and commit to that choice.

Being under constant attack, every day, is no fun. I think I'm holding it together pretty well, considering. Every day, lesser men under stress just snap, and for smaller trespasses.  I have to be a mountain, immovable, solid. I'm grateful, Internet, for having an outlet for frustration, so I can freak out in private, to then be stoic in public.  Thanks for being a good sport.  (And marriage is bullshit.)"
Divorce,394s0y,Catcherofsouls,2,Wed Jun 10 00:08:47 2015 UTC,Marriage would be awesome if not for the other person.   My fucking bitch of an ex. .. well that's a post for tomorrow.
Divorce,394s0y,abloodyminge,2,Wed Jun 10 02:09:34 2015 UTC,Marriage would be awesome if not for the other person.    We should make this a tagline or something.
Divorce,394s0y,hermes369,0,Wed Jun 10 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"I think there are double standards for men and women. In popular culture it seems clear that trading up is the new black for women. Seems like a pretty base level of equality to me. People that stay together make boring TV, unless they are out-snarking each other.  My overall theory is that our economy is so fucked up that we're, most of us, scrambling for crumbs. It's rare for only one income to support a family. Look at the divorce rate for the wealthy. It's lower than the general population. The rest of us keep shuffling the deck hoping for a better hand rather learning to play what we're dealt. Further, if you do get a shitty hand, you get a lecture on how it's your fault or how you need to dream of a different game.  I think our culture is borderline and narcissistic."
Divorce,394s0y,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Wed Jun 10 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"You may have a point about the culture or economy (that's a bit abstract for me to think about this early in the morning), but that still doesn't explain the ""high conflict"" part. If people are just looking to ""trade up,"" that doesn't explain the motivation to be petty, or fight, or take a fight to the radical extreme for absolutely no good reason.  One could opt out of a marriage, to trade up, and still be amicable and rational about it: ""honey, I think you're boring and fat, and I want to date my personal trainer - but you're a good man, and we have kids, so let's work out a fair arrangement.""  The desire to trade up alone doesn't explain high conflict. By ""high conflict,"" I mean no-holds-barred, bring out the deceit, the false accusations, the vindictiveness, the evil behavior, etc.   And in my case, neither party was looking to trade up. We have no assets to fight over. No one cheated. We both love the kids. I just wanted to not be screamed at (and accused of crazy nonsense during manic, paranoid episodes).  My numbers might be off, but they say something like 12% of divorces are ""high conflict."" That percentage might just correlate with the percentages of people who are on the spectrum for a Cluster B personality disorder. Culture might make divorces easier to come by, but that's not (I'm guessing) the factor explaining mental illness: breaking from reality, putting your need to protect your ego and public persona above the needs of your children, spending more money on lawyers than you win in a settlement, falsely accusing your former spouse of crimes just to maximize your take-away in court (and protect your victimhood narrative), and so on. That's literally crazy stuff."
Divorce,394s0y,hermes369,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:42:10 2015 UTC,"The cultural part seems, to me at least, to explain how casual and seemingly trivial is the act of both marriage and divorce. We have places with low barriers to entry like Reno or Vegas and have little cultural expectation weddings performed there will be more than ""Oops I Did it Again."" On the other hand, it is trivial in all but a few states to get divorced. I track this with the focused efforts of women's groups that, rightly, I should hasten to add, complained that battered women were trapped in their marriages.  To your point, divorce is a serious and disruptive event. It's not inherently high conflict but it does have profound effects on ones wellbeing. Pretending it doesn't and it's just one of those things that happen in life is, to me, just one in a litany of culturally regressive yet ballyhooed events sold as a marker of individuation, empowerment, or a right of passage. It's nonsense, if you ask me.  I'm reminded of the line from the Lost Boys movie back in the day when they talk about how vampires die. I can't remember the quote but it seems to describe how unpredictable are the effects of executing a vampire. I'll have to look it up.  Basically, divorce, to me, is a failure and it hurts. It doesn't mean divorce is unnecessary in some cases but it means one or both partners are cutting losses and destroying a covenant. This has consequences and some folks, myself especially, hurt a great deal as a result. I've turned my anger inward and save my acting out for here. There is no pain I can cause my ex that would turn her heart back or provide vindication to the man that loves her and supported her for twenty years. She just doesn't have it in her.  I'm sorry your ex has flipped out on you."
Divorce,394s0y,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:40:28 2015 UTC,Ummm.  You're giving the court  too much power. The anger and hate usually comes first then the court.

I think many of these people grew up spoiled as children perhaps, but I don't really know. Anyway it doesn't matter - bad behavior is bad behavior.   All I know is that I was lying in bed, exhausted, depressed, and despondent just now, and reading your post reminded me to get angry, to remember our kids and why I fight. Anger is a great thing, even if it kills me early. It's better than being sad. Thank you!  We can't let selfish, wicked people run roughshod over us!!!  I'm up now."

Divorce,394s0y,LaTuFu,5,Tue Jun 9 13:15:24 2015 UTC,"Before the divorce, my wife claimed she was done being a stay-at-home mom (which I always supported yet never demanded), and that she was ready to go back to work, and to be an independent woman. Great.   Now, she went to court with a bulldog lawyer at a show cause hearing (the first one was cancelled because lawyers # 1 and # 2 saw that the bills were paid) gunning for 90% of my monthly income! She didn't get that, but (until the divorce settlement) she's alway received more than child support and alimony would pay anyway from day one, because I'm reasonable and I make sure bills are paid during a transition period. That wasn't enough for her.  She claims to hate me, and yet she cashes my checks and still refuses to apply for jobs (she's a nurse - the most employable profession on planet earth). That speaks to a giant lack of personal integrity.  I would never cash a check from someone I claim to hate, unless it literally meant no food for the kids is the alternative (I can go hungry myself), and all other avenues for revenue have been thoroughly exhausted. She hasn't even tried."
Divorce,394s0y,Catcherofsouls,4,Tue Jun 9 12:39:36 2015 UTC,I'm in an almost identical situation.  I think there are many causes but revenge is definitely at the top.  All of the feelings that were held back during the marriage can now surface and be acted upon without reprisal.   Plus your ex is surely talking with family/lawyers who are filing her head with talking points and doing 'what is best for her and the kids'. That shit goes to their head and they start to believe that their bad behavior is justified.   I don't feel my wife's thirst for revenge will ever be satisfied.  That is why I will be insisting on a strictly business relationship following the divorce.   We're not friends.  I don't want to have joint parties.  Just follow the guidelines of the parenting agreement and let's be cordial when we have to meet face to face.  That's it.   The less facetime/contact the less time I'm in the cross hairs.
Divorce,394s0y,Catcherofsouls,3,Tue Jun 9 18:39:04 2015 UTC,"This is not a gender thing, this sub is chock full of threads with both genders being complete jerks to their former spouses, and making a complete mess of the lives of their kids.  People can make bad choices when they've been hurt or when they want to hurt someone else.  It's a really unfortunate truth about our species.  But trying to make it a gender thing does not help the issue at all.    Frankly, I'm tempted to remove this post simply because I think it does a disservice by potentially perpetuating a misguided stereotype.

And we do not ""police"" this sub for content.  The only thing that gets policed around here is the way redditors treat each other.  TRP drivel is managed very closely, but that is almost universal in reddit, outside their specific sub.  Everyone is free to express their opinions in an appropriate manner.

But I took the high road. I settled for the most sensible solution.   I didn't want my kids to grow up without their mom.   What matter to me I got. What matter to her she gets. I know she wants to money to start a college fund for the kids. The entire alimony is going to go in college funds minus financial planner percentage so she is asking for it upfront.   She is frugal like hell. She sold a bike to her friend that I had bought for $50 on thanksgiving sale from Walmart in the last 2 weeks.

This post is about finding out what I need to do when the process is finished to change my name to something that doesn't associate me with people who have hurt me.  You are the one who brought up anger and resentment so even though I had no obligation to I posted how I've been treated for the last few months.  Now you're implying I'm being ""bitter"" over behavior that amounts to gaslighting.  Name-changes happen after a divorce.  Boo hoo.  And because of the things listed above, the divorce is happening, that's not going to change.  It's not as though I've told him I'm doing this, but I'm sure he's expecting it anyway.  There is no fuel.  I know what I'm doing, chill with the ""she's a woman in a divorce she must be spiteful and irrational.""  Are you implying that a woman wanting to change her name after leaving a man is irrational?  Are you implying everything he did is just hunky dorey?  Are you actually trying to start a flame war?  Or are you my soon-to-be ex trying to make me disoriented and question my feelings and how wrong the way he's acting is. Again."

I honestly don't think I can be friends with her if we do end up divorced. Not because we don't get along great, even in the midst of all of this we can have normal civil conversations but I feel that to move on if we did divorce we couldn't remain close."

Divorce,394fw3,rasconjon,2,Tue Jun 9 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly being good looking and desirable is all well and good but from what you're saying in your post emotionally and mentally you are not 100%. People can pick up on that.    Adding a child or any real problems/stresses just makes you that much more undesirable   If you're getting into relationships where anything that something to do with real life is a relationship killer then you're probably getting into relationships with the wrong people in the first place. Life has problems and stresses if anyone wants to be in a relationship that doesn't have those things in it, well they're going to be living a very lonely life.   Are you seeing a therapist to help you work through the daily stresses of single parenthood and your struggle with adjusting to life as a single person? Sometimes it can help a lot just to get a bit of outside perspective or a little bit different way of looking at things."

Divorce,393plb,mastereh,2,Tue Jun 9 01:10:08 2015 UTC,Honestly you might be better off discussing this with an attorney.   Most of our denizens are US based and laws vary a lot even state to state.   For example - is the BMW even a divorce asset individually or is it a liability of the company?

My kids fight all the damn time, they're 8 and 6.  I was worried about it, stressed that it was because of losing their 1-on-1 relationship with their respective parent, or not liking each other... all sorts of things.   My new MIL finally just said 'Look, I had 2 kids 2 years apart.  They were full siblings, raised in the same family, and they fought just like this, it's part of being siblings.""  Best I can say is sit each of them down, individually over ice cream, and ask them what they don't like about the others, and what they do like about the others.   As how they'd feel about being a family, what would be scary, what would be frustrating, what would be cool.   Listen, after that, don't try to make a case or discourage any feelings, no matter how silly they are, and see what you can find out."
Divorce,392hoq,zandyman,3,Mon Jun 8 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for such a thoughtful and timely response!  I'll definitely use your suggestion and I'm inclined to agree with you and your MIL.   Just to show you where my GF is at, she had my kids and her daughter this past Saturday and lets just say it wasn't all roses the whole time.  She's been super bummed ever since and we haven't had a chance to sit down and discuss the matter (we had our kids).  She sent me the following message just moments ago, ""I just don't understand how we move forward if the kids aren't happy.""  How do I let her know that kids will be kids, ours will have two grown-ups that care for them very much and sometimes things aren't going to be perfect?"

My kids even get excited to go over to their place.  99/100 though it turns into a fight with one kid crying, etc.  My GF and I dated for almost 9 months before we made it ""official"" and slowly introduced the kids.  So wow, I guess we've actually been dating nearly 3 years, it goes fast!  Edit to add a thought:  My GF really seeks to provide an uncomplicated life (for good or for bad sometimes) for her daughter and even my kids too.  I mean that in the best possible way but the discord among them really gets her down."

Divorce,3929e1,3343423423424,3,Mon Jun 8 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"Anxiety is hard, really hard. I can understand someone trying to help someone with it hitting the wall of what they can deal with emotionally. As someone living with anxiety I can tell you I've hit the wall emotionally at times, unfortunately I can't really get away from myself so that sucks.   Having a child makes the situation more stressful, especially when you're both still adjusting to life with an infant and how much that drastically changes everything about your life.   Divorce with a child will not make your life necessarily easier, honestly at the get go it will probably make things worse because you'll be working on co-parenting with someone who's just been told by the one person they thought they could rely on that they couldn't be dealt with anymore.   Have you taken the time to honestly and openly talk to your wife about where you are at emotionally right now? She may honestly not realize the full extent that her anxiety is affecting you, or worse she does and it's killing her too.   The really shitty part about anxiety is you realize how stupid it is and how much it is affecting your life and even despite that you succumb to it. Anxiety disorders are absolutely terrible and I wouldn't wish them on my worse enemy.  Even still I can't blame you if you decide to be done. Unfortunately there is only so much you can do to help and the bulk of the dealing with her anxiety issues is your wife. I wish the best of luck to you with deciding what to do. But honestly this is the worse part of that ""For Better or Worse"" vow, just something to think about."

Divorce,3929e1,livingthedreamnow,2,Mon Jun 8 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"When mental health issues, like anxiety and depression are involved, the non afflicted spouse is often likely to get caught up in this never ending game of excuse and concession making (especially when deeply in love with the afflicted). This can carry on for many years, can be very confusing, and can leave you completely lost as an individual.  In my opinion,, it is best to view these mental illnesses, similarly to how we view alcoholism in a relationship. If you absolutely love your partner, they have this disease, but they are fighting with all of their might to recover (therapy, medication, support groups),,, then there MAY be the ability for the person to recover, and for the relationship to return to a healthy state. BUT If the afflicted partner isn't fighting their illness with all their might (even if they acknowledge it's a problem),,, then you have an unhealthy relationship that will inevitably deplete your own spirit and sense of self for as long as you allow it to, or until it completely breaks you.  My advice is to ask her to seek therapy, and then you yourself get to a good therapist. You need big changes, because this situation isn't sustainable,, but big changes don't happen by themselves, and they don't happen over night. It's best to have a pro help you navigate through it."
Divorce,3929e1,Cooter1990,2,Mon Jun 8 19:46:13 2015 UTC,OP try not to let her anxiety bring you down at times you do have to just walk away and leave her be.

If she doesn't want help and you've done all you can then that's just how it is. Don't allow it to ruin you too.

Divorce,390qea,LaTuFu,3,Mon Jun 8 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"UK here, going through a divorce.  Go see a lawyer, quickly. Sign nothing until you do.   All debts and assets are split.  The split % will be agreed between you two and your lawyers, but you should know that you're going to do bloody badly out of it.   Personally I would not want to live in the same house, but we dont have kids.  Can you afford to rent somewhere nearby?"
Divorce,390qea,GrandEthos,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"The thought of doing badly out of it has crossed my mind a lot. But, she is only now asking for a £10,000 loan (for setting up a business with a girl friend and ensure her future she says).  But she will pay this back each month via direct debt.  This will be on a separate joint account to my main one. If I sell my flat I will get about £70k-80K I think.  I also have about £90K in my pension fund.  She hasn't bothered to pay into her pension.  Risk is that if she defaults on payments the bank will go after me (for the flat), but she will be living in the same flat as me along with our son. My worry is that, if I refuse to give her the loan, she will lower up an the lowers will grab most of everything I have as you said."
Divorce,390qea,Offthepoint,3,Thu Jun 11 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not in the UK, but I'm pretty sure you get to split the debt along some lines.  Can the flat be declared a pre-marital asset in the UK?  If so, you may be able to exclude some portion of the value from the property settlement.  I would not let her stay in the house.  It's not going to work out well.  My guess is she'll want you to pay for everything house and child related, provide free child care, and allow her to come and go as she pleases.  She wants out of the marriage?  There's the door.  Leave the kid when you go.  That's the deal I'd offer her.  If she wants out more than you want her out, then she can sign that."
Divorce,390vae,Diet-CokeFiend,8,Mon Jun 8 12:54:20 2015 UTC,"I would also crosspost this question to /r/legaladvice.  As a former Financial Advisor who often worked with couples divorcing, I would strongly advise against signing that document.  You potentially waive your rights to any retirement benefits, or at the very least make it really, really difficult for you later on down the road.  If he decides to divorce you, that could be a problem.  But IANAL so I don't know if it causes a permanent issue for you in the event of a divorce later on.  Most retirement plans allow for partial withdrawals after age 59 1/2 even while still employed.  If you sign that document, your husband could make withdrawals without your knowledge and consent.  That by itself is enough risk for me that I would not be comfortable with it if you were my client as an FA.  Do not sign anything in blind faith from your husband.  Yes, you should have an expectation of trust in a marriage.  But that trust goes both ways, i.e. he should have no problem looking you in the eye and explaining what he's doing any time he asks you to sign something.  Financial decisions in a marriage, like any other decision that impacts the family, should always be a joint decision."

Divorce,391kb7,LaTuFu,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:45:07 2015 UTC,Probably.   Just make sure to leave her out of the conflict between the two of you.
Divorce,38zkj1,9999HP,3,Mon Jun 8 04:03:35 2015 UTC,"I assume you asked for the divorce?  She's probably trying to get something resembling closure. I tried something similar early on. I was rebuffed.   You seem to at least care a little bit about your stbx's feelings... please don't say to her what you want to say. Set up an auto-reply or whatever you need to ""no I don't hate you, but I don't want to talk about this either"" or whatever."
Divorce,38zkj1,GrandEthos,2,Mon Jun 8 13:07:24 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't want to divorce. I wanted to go to counselung etc. She approached me about with divorce. I agreed, if it's not worth it to her to work through our problems, no amount of work on my part could alleviate the problem."

Divorce,38zkj1,rasconjon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:54:05 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean about not saying it, I agree with you. It would've been childish to say in the first place.   I'm familiar with ptsd, I'm a veteran myself and was deployed at the same time she was. If she has it, then I don't know about it, and then she must have  kept all the other stuff you mentioned hidden as well. And yeah ptsd doesn't necessarily mean it had to have been stereotypically traumatic, I understand that.   I actually never considered if that she might be acting differently due to ptsd , but I think she'd look at me sideways if I asked her how she felt about that.   Can you explain further on what you mean if I was safe? As in if I would harm her?"
Divorce,38zkj1,Altruizzy,4,Mon Jun 8 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"I see, with her as the person who wanted the divorce, I still don't think I understand why she would have those types of questions running through her mind. I know those are just examples..   like I said last night I never considered the possibility of ptsd. So I refreshed myself on it pretty hard last night, and found several reasons why she might have ptsd. Also, checked her symptoms on several websites. I tried to keep out confirmation  bias as much as possible, but the matches were..  Pretty alarming.   So, I presented to her this morning what I found and asked her what she thought about it. Told her why I thought so along with the symptoms of ptsd, and asked if therapy is something she'd consider, whether we're together or not. She said herself, she never even thought about that either. She expressed that she was worried about going to a therapist, and didn't want someone to tell her she's ""messed up"", is how she put it . I tried my best to comfort her and help ease her into the idea that that's not what they do, but help you overcome life experiences.   I relayed to her, that if it was something she thought might help her, that I'd be willing to help her find out the who, what, when, and where of it.  I think she wants to go, to at least see if ptsd is accurate. Idk if it will be one of the things that's thought about one day, and forgotten the next."
Divorce,38zkj1,Altruizzy,2,Mon Jun 8 05:24:39 2015 UTC,"Good job being a good battle buddy for her despite everything. I know there's still a HUGE stigma about going to the shrink for possible PTSD issues.  It's tough, and dumb."
Divorce,38zkj1,Altruizzy,2,Mon Jun 8 06:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yea. The sigma and whatnot is one she'll have to overcome. Hopefully though, itll help her come out better on the otherside.   And thanks, I don't think I could leave anyone hanging like that though."

I understand why sometimes a parent vilifies the other parent in a divorce situation - I've wanted to go there plenty of times - but imagine being the child who has to listen to someone you love deeply talk trash about someone else you love deeply. No matter how wrong the ex is, they're still the other parent and nothing you say or do will ever change that. For better of for worse.

With the end of a marriage when one/both partners have changed, it's not like they're actually gone - they're still walking around this planet, having everyday lives, drinking coffee, working, following a routine (or maybe not), doing laundry and burning their personal pizzas, and we have to accept the fact that we're no longer part of their lives, and they're no longer part of ours. Seeing my ex already married with a child - only THREE MONTHS after our divorce was finalized - I just don't even recognize him at all. It's him, but he's not there. I've tried to accept the fact that either he was lying to me for 4 years about who he was, or something in him broke and never got put back together. There's nothing I can do about it now.

For example, if he's the sole income provider, then it might be financially in your best interest, but not knowing anything about what state you live in, how long you've been married, what kind of situation you're in, it would be absolutely impossible for us Internet folk to be helpful.

Thanks for your concern and I don't mean to be flippant but it is a done deal, agreed by both sides. I am not soley focused on taking care of myself here- just trying to figure out how to get us both out of this thing with as big a financial cushion as possible to split down the middle, without dragging things on too much longer as I don't think it's sustainable. We are common-law, together more than 10 years, live in a no-fault state. I am the sole breadwinner currently but he is on the job market and getting lots of attention, I am reasonably confident he will find something soon. Once back to work he will make about half what I make - so I expect to pay spousal support and we will split custody 50/50. We are amicable, but there is no fixing it, neither of us want to - we are now totally focused on being great co-parents.

That being said, we need to get out of this living arrangement asap, for reasons I don't want to get into here.

Divorce,38ts0w,Catcherofsouls,2,Sat Jun 6 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"Quick Take:  Option A won't work - family judges typically base their decisions on what you could make - not what you are currently making.  In short, they would either see through your 'firing' or not care and tell you to get another job.  In the meantime, you've lost wages . . .  B:  Seems an extravagant solution to get out of $1,500 of support.  You'd be better off working with your lawyer to 1) make a compelling argument that you can't survive on what's left of your salary and 2) emphasize that she just quit her job - so her ability to make some money should be factored into the support judgement.  If you do leave the country to avoid support there are many levers in place to try to make that painful for you - be sure you understand them. . .   TLDR:  work with your lawyer to make the best possible argument to allow you a livable portion of your take-home earnings."

Divorce,38ts0w,laughterandtears,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"You start paying in June or your next court date is in June? As in, this reads like the temporary support order is for only one month.  Both of your Plans are way overboard to get out of paying 1500.   Plan C-talk to your lawyer. Why did she quit her job? Does the maintenance amount take her earnings before she quit into account? If not, can you adjust the amount to take into account what she was making two months ago? If you still have to pay it, just move in with your parents until you move overseas rather than blemishing your work record to try to financially ruin yourself and then move in with your parents. Or get a roomate to lower living expenses."
Divorce,38ts0w,laughterandtears,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:55:55 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your advise. I didn't phrase my post correctly. The court date was in May and I'm supposed to pay by the next courts date in June.  Regardless of the decision I am moving overseas. That's been my plan for 3 years but can't do that until 2016. So I won't be moving to avoid spousal support per we. As crazy as it this sounds, I'm not terribly worried about ruining myself financially ( currently  no savings, bad credit, and I don't have much outstanding debt).  She told the court that she quit her job because the she was told that she was going to be fired. One of those options where the company says they will fire you or you can quit.  Moving in with my parents would require moving 500 miles so essentially leaving my current employer. I live in a studio so roommate isn't an option. However your suggestion makes me considering finding a room to rent.  I guess I don't understand how she is allowed to quit but if I do it's ""illegal""? Would it be smarter to leave my job BEFORE spousal support is determined by the court?"
Divorce,38ts0w,saricher,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes more sense on the payment.  If she had been fired, she would have been able to file for unemployment benefits, right? Her quitting makes no sense in that regards. Although, when there are controversial reasons behind the potential foreign firing, people would do it to not have that blemish on their career.  I would really, really ask your lawyer about this, especially the reason why she can take such a large percentage of your income for such a short time of her not bringing in income. I would also ask about you quitting to move. It would suck if you quit, but then still legally was bound to make her payments. It would put you even in a worse position."
Divorce,38ts0w,saricher,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:46:16 2015 UTC,"California Family Law attorney here.  DId she really quit her job or was she fired/laid off?  And was the $1500/month calculated imputing to her what she did make?  Because if she voluntarily quit and the judge used $0 on her side to calculate temporary spousal support, you either have (a) a judge doing meth during lunch recess; (b) an attorney with narcolepsy; or (c) both.  Get proof that she voluntarily quit (subpoena her employment records).  And remember - that $1500 is tax deductible for you.  As are the attorney fees paid for the prep and hearing on spousal support.   what prevents me from doing something so egregious at work that will get me fired which will force me to move in with my parents. If I qualify, apply for welfare and with only unemployment to support me file a 'change in circumstances' with the court to reduce or eliminate the support altogether.   Well, nothing - but if the court thinks you did it on purpose, they will nail you.  Same if it can be found out she did it, too.  And if you get fired for something ""egregious,"" what makes you think you'll get unemployment or welfare?   Get a second job to help pay the alimony until I move overseas, surrender my u.s. Citizenship or change my name, marry a local and hasta la vista.   Unless you're in a country that will extradite your ass back to the States.  Dude, go to the next court hearing and argue against her quitting her job.  The court should impute her old salary when calculating spousal support.  You know, if she starts working again, you can file a motion to adjust spousal support - because how long do you think she'll make it on $1500/month in California?"
Divorce,38ts0w,allwrongs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"Off line for awhile so very late response. My next court hearing is in a couple days and I spoke to my lawyer today w/the intention of being very clear that they should calculate her spousal support appropriately. To add to the drama, opposing counsel wants to post-pone the next hearing for another 30 days because she cannot get in touch with my wife. I told my lawyer that I wouldn't agree to that so (fingers crossed) we'll be in court. To go back to the $1,500/month. The judge used $0 for that calculation. She admitted to quitting so not sure the subpoena would be necessary but will ask my guy if that helps.  If my wife decides to not show up for the hearing, does that help my case?  One more question, I found out that my wife did not include the car that I had co-signed for years ago in the discovery paperwork submitted to the court. Would that be considered ""falsification""? I just want a walk away divorce but my wife is a creature not of this planet. I had hoped to be friends but she's not having it. Thanks"
Divorce,38ts0w,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"If my wife decides to not show up for the hearing, does that help my case?    It could - some judges take the ""Look, if you're not excited about your case that you can't bother to show up, why should I be?"" attitude.  If she doesn't show, make the argument that since the hearing was about spousal support and she is not there, I guess she  doesn't really need it.  Remind the judge, the hearing is for her benefit and her lack of concern should be noted.   She admitted to quitting so not sure the subpoena would be necessary but will ask my guy if that helps.   If the judge thought it was one of those situations where a person quits because they were going to be fired anyway and gave your wife relief based on that, a subpoena might - might - show that no, no one was going to be fired and it was a simple voluntary termination.  Talk to your attorney about why he/she thinks the judge made that award.   One more question, I found out that my wife did not include the car that I had co-signed for years ago in the discovery paperwork submitted to the court. Would that be considered ""falsification""?    There is no legal term ""falsification"" and it may be just an oversight.  In settlement talks or at trial, make sure you bring it up and that she either sell or refinance the car to get your name off the loan.  Okay, her lawyer may not be able to get in touch with her because your wife is at work.  Do you know where she lives?  It may behoove you to drive by during the day and check to see if the car is gone.  Hiring a PI is expensive but you can always check yourself."

Is it possible that you're trying to play the Nice Guy? By remaining ""faithful"" to someone who has made it abundantly clear that she does not want to be a part of your life, you are pressuring her with guilt (which is manipulative behaviour) and stroking your own ego (which is misguided and conceited behaviour). Nobody- especially her- gives a darn if you choose never to have sex with anyone else ever again. Nobody but you.     It doesn't make you a better person. It makes you stuck in the past.

The church and scripture  talks about marriage as a covenant between the couple and God.  Remaining celibate after divorce is not about being faithful to your ex-spouse, it is about honouring your commitment to God.    According to the bible, (Matthew 19:8-9) ""Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”  The Bible also says that only God can know our motives,no one else can.  Not that simple and definitely something to talk to a priest about."

In my experience, though, most people pick and choose the religious rules they follow- because they're driven by other factors too, and their goals may or may not dovetail with their religious beliefs.    We don't know OP. Is he always so pious that he'd sacrifice something so basic to the human experience as sex and relationships for the rest of his life, purely based on a rule that very, very few people would expect him to follow? Does he also follow all the less painful rules with deep commitment and purely pious intent? Possibly. But I doubt motivations so pure are likely."

His wife used it against him during the divorce process by endlessly reeling him back in whenever she wanted something, (generally for him to pay off her credit cards even though he was already paying immense amounts of spousal and child support), and then brutally rejecting him as soon as she got what she wanted.  He agreed to an unfair property distribution and insane lifetime alimony after she told him that they would maybe get remarried again a year or two after the divorce.  (Did not happen.)  It is now four years since their divorce.  He is a broken bitter angry man unable to move forward.  He has also developed a significant alcohol problem.  The children are hopelessly conflicted since he insists they are still married and seethes with rage about her boyfriend.  He flips out now and then during child exchanges, in front of the children, and the police have been called more than once.  His children quite regularly ask to return to their mother during his visitation which spirals him down into a drunken depression.  He ex continues to sometimes reel him in and then spit him out, (when she wants money), which is possible because they attend all the children's activities together, so sometimes she sits with him and plays happy family.    His family, friends, business partners, and a series of therapists have all begged him to move forward and find another woman.  Only the church supports his decision.  He is mostly celibate, but he also spends way too much time on some very sleazy websites, and generally only chooses to spend time with one night stand type women who he does not respect.  He also doesn't respect himself for going there.  Look, seriously, this guy prays for death.  Really, I'm not kidding.

It was over 9 months after she moved out, several months after I filed, and who knows how long after I knew I was never going to be with the ex when I first went on a date with someone else. It was weird. It was probably too soon. It was way too soon for me to be able to commit to anyone emotionally (still a ways off from doing that, over a year into dating others).  For me, it took some time and I should have taken even more.  There's no hurry to date someone else. I don't think you have to decide right now.  I doubt you'll feel good about being a huge slut right now, regardless of what she's doing."

Divorce,38oe3v,ZaryaMusic,9,Fri Jun 5 15:06:28 2015 UTC,"She is not the person you should be going to for help. Honestly at this point the best thing you can do for yourself is go completely no contact. The more you rely on her for support the longer your healing process will take because you're not allowing yourself to emotionally detach from her. Your therapist is absolutely right.  If you have to block her number on your phone as well as her email address. Do whatever it takes but the best thing you can do for yourself is to cut off contact with her. Keep going out and doing new things, the fact that you are still morning the end of the marriage is absolutely 100% normal and not something you should feel bad about. We all take time to heal and you're still working through that.   There's a lot of great people here who are happy to listen if you need someone to talk to. We're here for you."
Divorce,38oe3v,Slowlyloosinghope,3,Fri Jun 5 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"You need to stop contacting your ex.  Every time you do, all you're doing is ripping the scab off the wound and starting the healing process all over again.  The best thing you can do is find some group activities, preferably outdoor physical ones, that can help you begin to build a new life.  Volunteer in an animal shelter, a retirement home, or soup kitchen.  Do volunteer work at a local church ministry.  Join a kickball league, or a hiking club.  Stop talking to your ex.  Block her number, delete her from all social media.  Your life remains on hold until you do."

Divorce,38oe3v,daguro,2,Fri Jun 5 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"The situation sounds very similar to the one I'm in currently, as far as her reasons for wanting to be out of the marriage. We're actually the same age, you and i.   One of my friends put it simply enough for me, ""You were ready for marriage and she was not."". My stbx also kept everything bottled up as well, and left no room for counseling or reconciliation. Once, the D word was dropped, she had already made up her mind and was over me I guess.  I would imagine as a younger 20s woman, your ex feels like she has some self discovery to deal with, but regardless if it's just that or not, you can't make anyone love you.   What you can do, is work on yourself, and become someone who you love to be with. A whole person on your own. Now is a great time to be selfish with your ambitions etc.  Focus on your schooling, on what you should be doing to be the ideal person in your mind.   Hopefully, your relationship with your family is good enough to that you can go to them and vent or what have you to them. With my divorce, one of the positive aspects of it have been that I'm closer to my family more than I have been in years or ever, really.  I'm a 26 year old veteran, who for the longest time couldn't shed a single tear even if I wanted to, because im that emotionally guarded. But all morning, I've been listening to break up  songs (Very teenager, maybe.), and then Bruno Mars' ""When I Was Your Man"" happened, and goddamn.. I was walking to the kitchen to check on my breakfast and it just caught me.   My heart finally slipped out of my hands, exhausted from juggling it, and shattered on the floor. I felt embarrassed, even all alone, but afterwards I felt relieved that I was finally able to let go.   Point is, a good cry, a release, felt great afterwards. It's hard to say whether or not this effect is permanent. But if you haven't just bawled your eyes out and let all the emotions flow free, I personally think you're doing yourself a disservice.   Just pull the plug in the tub of memories and hopes and let it all drain out, instead of just letting it trickle down the drain.   There's a lot of good advice and helpful people in here. I recommend you heed their advice .  -someone in a similar position"

Luckily (luckily?) I have already had many a hard cry session, sometimes in places I wish I hadn't (nothing is weirder than seeing a dude cry with his training buddy at the gym I bet).  I'm glad I posted today though. It's good to know I'm not all by myself."

Then, I have to remind myself that it doesn't matter lol.   I'd say ""luckily"", just let it out brother. Part of why I was listening to those songs was to goad my emotions out. And it's good to hear you're going to the gym! Exercise is a beautiful thing during times of duress.   I just came from a session myself, feels good to zone out, and accomplish something. Showing that your effort does matter.   If you ever need to chat, or bs man, I'd be more than happy to talk. Afterall, it'd probably benefit us both!"

I've hung out with other women, friends, family, gone out and done things I normally would never do. But I miss her, even now. I talked to my therapist about why I just suddenly felt this intense longing for my wife, and she said that once the shock of the divorce wears off and it feels ""real"" then the heartache sets in long-term.  I've struggled with it for days on end now, missing a woman that doesn't want me to be her partner anymore. I know it's logical to miss a relationship when it's just been shortly over a month since it ended, but I'm just sick of the pain."

I don't think a balance of the 2 would be detrimental.  I'm naturally geared towards introversion, so being alone isn't as bitter as it is to some.

I'm here to talk if you want to PM me anytime. LaTuFu was a great help to me and I thank her for that. The worst part for me is that we just moved to Georgia for her job, we share this new lease so we're living in the same house but seperate bedrooms, I've tried to get out and meet people but haven't really yet, and I've been exercising like crazy but that doesn't seem to help anymore.

Living with your SO has got to be the roughest and toughest thing, but as soon as my wife told me she wanted out I grabbed all my stuff, got the hell out of dodge, and signed a release form that she later signed. I knew if I lived with her after, it would be the worst move for me in terms of healing.  I wish you the best, man.

I don't have the storage capacity for that amount of video, though. :-( Maybe a regular non-digital CCT system. Just costs money though...  This is an expensive and painful psychology education. I'd rather have gone to university for it!  Edit: huh. Regular CCT surveillance systems are less expensive than I thought. I'm going to scare up the money and go for it!

Divorce,38p0m3,vespa_1933,3,Fri Jun 5 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"First off, it is not uncommon that lawyer's fees outstrip the actual financial benefit of the decision.  The most predatory family lawyers will actually engineer scenarios where this is the case.  A 50 page interrogatory fits that bill.  If she really went through 2 attorneys she was probably asking for insane concessions from you and each attorney concluded she's not paying them enough to put up with her.  That's where the top-dog divorce lawyers come in - they take an extravagant retainer and will then do anything to harass you on behalf of their client.    I too had an exes father pay for an aggressive attorney in an attempt to renegotiate a custody/child support agreement.  Your best move, for you and your kids is to extract the highest possible payment from the father.  A top-family lawyer bills hourly and extravagantly.   If you have a competent, reasonable attorney at a reasonable rate - look for ways to play legal defense.  After 1 or 2 bill cycles you may find that dad is not so rate insensitive after all and that your ex is once again without an attorney.  As much as it sucks, be patient, be reasonable and weather the storm.  From a financial standpoint a few thousand now in attorney's fees is nothing compared to an unfair order that spans years."

I just wanted to be reasonable and avoid hassles, because that's what decent, sane people do. There's really nothing to fight over. Just the ""victimhood narrative"" of hers.

Divorce,38n14t,mykidisonhere,4,Fri Jun 5 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"Because there is a giant imbalance of power when older men date younger women.  They are not two like minded equals who relate on every level.  They are far more likely to be an older man who likes young bodies and will tell that immature adult what she wants to hear to feel loved.  As far as sexist goes, I disagree.  When you have an older woman and a younger man there seems to be the implicit agreement that it's probably not much more than some fun sex.  They just aren't the same situation as a guy saying anything to fuck a youngster."

They all say the same things.  They say that they have so much in common like the same music.  They also say ""I'm mature for my age"" and yet soooooo many of them have the same problem.    It's not that these young ladies are stupid or don't have agency.

Secondly... and I have no way to know this... so prepare for facts coming out of my anus ;)  But I'm pretty certain there  is no relationship between age discrepancy and abuse.  Young guys lie all the darn time just as well as old guys do.  And in fact... I'd go one step more in my 'speculated facts' and say that I'll bet $1 that a younger guy is FAR  more likely to be hot tempered and abusive than an old guy.  That generally happens as we age.... we all get less hormonal and excitable ;)
Divorce,38n14t,TheEarlShibe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"It's just that your position rings of 'protect these young women' which is a haughty assertion.   Where did I say that?  They are adults who are making their own adult decisions and so are the dirty old men who chase them.  Most likely these girls will regret their relationships with these inappropriate men and they will have to live with that.  The old men may be raising their second round of babies with these babes, and they have to live with that.  At least they can take a nap the same time as their infant.  Your ass.....sssssumptions of abuse are skewed by thinking that the emotional abuse of manipulation isn't as harmful as physical abuse, if you were correct, and I'm not sure you are.  Speaking of excitable hormones...what's a girl to do when she hits her sexual peak at 35+ and her ""older man"" is, in fact, an old man who has less hormones and less excitable?  The little blue pill and heart disease do not mix!"
Divorce,38n14t,abloodyminge,2,Fri Jun 5 23:55:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, younger people in general are easier to manipulate because they don't really know who they are.  Automatic deference to people older than you as possibly wiser and/or more knowledgeable.  And the older man/younger woman trope is often a classic sign of an abuser looking for his next victim."
Divorce,38n14t,TheEarlShibe,0,Fri Jun 5 22:07:22 2015 UTC,"so men who date younger men are more likely to be abusive?  Is that a linear relationship? If she's 10 years younger she's twice as likely to be abused... we could go round and round... but I think the reality is you feel it's wrong for a guy to date a younger lady... and my point was that ladies over 18 are actually adults and perfectly capable of making a decision (good or bad) but go on and roll your eyes when you see the attractive, established 40 year old guy dating a bubbly 25 year old lady... and gosh darn it.. I would not try  to convince you that your feeling on the matter is wrong because it's your feeling :)"
Divorce,38n14t,abloodyminge,3,Fri Jun 5 22:19:05 2015 UTC,"So if an 18 year-old woman is dating a man 10 or more years older than she is, she probably had a bad/unstable home life and is looking to him as a father figure.  This Parent/child dynamic in a relationship is not a healthy one, and opens the ""child"" up to abuse (Keep in mind parent and child are roles, not an age reference.) from the parent figure.  The trope goes as follows.  She's had an unsteady home life, and a difficult childhood, she's ""mature for her age"" as life has been hard forcing her to grow up too quickly.  And the idea of an older man often represents the idea of sacrificing one's childhood for stability.  It has nothing to do with legal consenting age.  It has nothing to do with what I think is or is not right.  (My personal opinion is that women don't really know who they are until about 23-25, and men from about 25-27)  And it's not my feeling, I honestly can't tell you how many young women I've seen do this, and end up with an abuser.  Why? Because asshole masks itself as confidence quite easily to the untrained eye, and they've lived longer so their advice and wording tends to carry extra weight as a part of the patriarchal conditioning that society imparts upon all of us.  At my age, no I wouldn't date an 18 year-old.  It isn't because I feel it is wrong, it's because they're simply not interesting to me.  The personality gulf between what motivates her and what motivates me is so massive that I just discard them as ""Not food""...  Oh, and I am the attractive, established, financially well-off 40 year-old guy.  Literally, I turned 40 on Tuesday 25 is a little below my usual cutoff age by 3 years.  And I only consider women under 30 if they truly have their shit together.  I'm not looking to impress anyone by spending money on them.  Everyone believes they're the exception to the rule.  And they're usually not, because the data doesn't back them up.  If they beat the odds, great good on them.  Me?  I've  known entirely too many women who have been abused by much older men."

Divorce,38n14t,zandyman,2,Sat Jun 6 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"Well, most often it has to do with life experience. A guy is his late 20s - 40s, its kinda hard to see what a they would have in common with each other outside of awesome sex. I mean he is a wine or scotch guy and she is only allowed to drink kool-aid.   He has experienced a significant amount of life while she is barely exploring it herself. At that age she doesn't even know who she is yet, so it is kinda understandable that she might lean heavily on a more mature person's viewpoints, which is the 'naive' that people think about in those situations.   Personally, I always wonder a bit when I see a guy with a girl that much younger than himself - do women his own age not find him attractive, or does he not find them attractive? Maybe he wants someone able bodied to change his diapers down the road? Then I wonder about the girl, does she have daddy issues? Is she just attracted to men with more experience and an established lifestyle? Then I wonder if she realizes that there was likely a woman in his life while he was 'establishing' himself and she is reaping the rewards (which is actually quite brilliant), but she has no idea what it is like to stand by a guy who has nothing and love him.   Now don't get me wrong, in all honesty I could really care less in most cases, but those thoughts do trickle into my brain when I see big age disparities."

Not bloody likely.   Six months tops in a worst case scenario. (Scenario includes a half-drunk man-hating judge.  Even that is really unlikely )  She can't show that a short-term marriage has entitled her to lifetime support.   Savings - do you mean in a savings account or in an ira?

Your pre-marriage savings is your separate property; even commingling does not mean you have made it CP. HAHAHAHAHA!  If she gets any at all, it is likely to be half the lifetime of the marriage.

Kudos to you for buying the house before you got married. She is probably going to get half of the savings, unless you can clearly prove that it is a pre-marital asset. No.  14 months married and no kids, She's full of it. Remove her as an authorized user immediately, Have a new   card issued with a new number, do NOT give it to her."

What was the value of the home when you guys married vs now?  Credit cards immediately they is immediately remove her as an authorized user. You don't want to fight later for thousands spent now.  Alimony get real, you've been married for such a short period of time she won't get anything.  File as soon as possible to get this process started."

She's entitled to one half of the increase in equity from the time of marriage. Not one half the total.  Also one half of the increase in savings from that date.   No alimony for a marriage that short.    I'd close the credit cards to be on the safe side.  I'd calculate the above and then offer her a few more thousand on top of that to go away if she agrees to sign the divorce documents that your lawyer draws up. She won't do it but at least you want feel bad when she gets even less. Depending on local customs, you may have to cover her court costs since you make double her salary.   Good luck and good riddance, sounds like."

She can't exactly go ring up debt and make you pay for it once the divorce process has begun... but you are on the hook for it so don't be a dufus and cancel those cards asap.  5 - You didn't ask but don't get married again... add in 5 more years and a kid and you'd be super duper screwed.

Not much since at first it's mostly interest.   I don't have to repay any thing given to me before we were married.  She may get to live in my home for up to a year while the divorce is in process.   One of us MUST move out in order to start the process.   Since neither one of us really has anything worth fighting over it would appear this is best settled out of court.   I can cancel all credit cards in my name and will no repercussions.   Looks like I have to pay spouse support to the tune of ~$1100 a month. <-- This is gonna suck.   I'm going to try to speak to her tonight about reaching a settlement with me and not battle in court.   Court will cost upwards of $10k and we will both be left with nothing.

Anyway, having an audit trail is not a bad thing (she probably doesn't know how to backup voicemails and texts, nor records phone calls). If it's not too hard to use, I might go for that communication channel. Having an audit trail can help you call her out on her bullshit later (should she have any). It works both ways, so be no-bullshit yourself, of course!  You could also submit in an agreed order that you guys text each other, only between certain hours, about the kids and ONLY about the kids, and call only in an emergency. This is also an audit trail.

It's like pulling teeth.. the truth of it is my ex doesn't want anything to do with me - ever - and she is incapable of compartmentalizing those feelings, even when it comes to the well-being of our son.  I've tried everything up to and including demanding a face-to-face meeting between myself, my ex, and our son's therapist. My ex won't talk to me in person and while she will respond to email or text, she ignores anything she doesn't want to deal with, so getting a straight answer is next to impossible.  The therapist basically acted as a mediator while I spelled out my concerns regarding communication (or lack thereof). The meeting itself seemed to go well. Later I found out I was only being placated.  I'm at a loss for what to do at this point; except the best I can despite the circumstances. Probably the best advice I can give you (or anyone else in the same boat) is to do what you can and not stress yourself out over what you can't...   Good advice for any situation I suppose, and far easier said than done, but the reality is I can't force my ex to communicate with me, even about our son. So I talk to him as much as I can (he's only 8, so some things are a bit outside of his pay grade right now), and if anything extremely vital comes up and I don't feel I'm getting the information I need for his sake, I will simply walk my son to the door of the house my ex lives in when I'm dropping him off and insist on talking to her then."

I would advise that if you want to make sure the paperwork is correct.  I can't speak for Texas, but I can Kansas. She has to be a resident for 6 months. When she files her petition for divorce, she can also file a Voluntary Entry of Appearance for you, which means you do not need to be served or have to respond to the suit. She will get a court date that is at least 61 days from her filing. Then she shows up, hands the paperwork to a judge, answers questions and gets the judgement and gets a certified copy on the way out the door. For the court date, I think she can also bring a entry of appearance so you don't need to be there for it.   There is probably a similar process for Texas."

Even in those cases some states have an option for a legal separation so that you aren't liable for your beloved spouses debts.   2) You can absolutely refuse to do anything and stick your head in the sand. Of course the divorce will still happen and without you contending the ""agreement"" he'll basically get whatever he wants when it comes to the division of assets.   Divorce sucks but if one of you is dead set on that being the only option then you need to make sure you protect yourself and your future. If he files for Divorce hire a lawyer and deal with it.

Divorce,38jyri,abloodyminge,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:28:00 2015 UTC,"No, scenario one isn't a solution for two people who don't want to be married. The various ""things"" about being married, like rights during probate, shared debt responsibility in community property states, automatic rights to be the beneficiary of pension funds, some investment accounts, etc.: they are numerous but can't be enumerated. There's no ""list"" of rights or responsibilities to being married because it's a state incorporated by reference in thousands of individual policies, agreements, and laws. Remaining married for a lifetime of hassle to save a couple days' worth of effort and a couple hundred dollars in filing fees makes no sense.  Basically, yes, you're legally obligated to respond. The consequences vary. It's common to have a restraining order against dissipation of assets which you'd be likely to violate if you just pretended it didn't exist.  If you think a divorce would be ""messy"" because you wouldn't be able to agree on its terms, then it's many, many times more likely to screw you over to either persist in a state of separation or not respond to a petition for divorce, and your plans go from ""terrible"" to ""unimaginably bad."" A divorce is only messy when the participants, individually or together, make it that way."

Wife #3 - I was attracted to physically and also because she liked to have a ""good"" time.  I have suffered enough now to figure out my role in this.  I am working on or have given up on everything I do that is ""not natural,"" to increase dopamine.  No alcohol, no smoking, no porn, replaced with working out.

My oldest is very disabled and will never be able to live on her own.  My younger one is athletic, and a straight A student.  The older one will need me to support her, her whole life.  I need my younger one to manage the money I will have for the older one.  I have to do a good job raising these kids.  Unfortunately for my poor wife that means I can't afford to dump resources into helping her get her life straightened out.  You hit the nail right on the head twice.

Divorce,38dpjh,Catcherofsouls,0,Wed Jun 3 15:41:19 2015 UTC,That I don't know. I'm in NY and am hoping to not go through the courts.
Divorce,38dpjh,hubbyofhoarder,2,Wed Jun 3 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"My story has some interesting parallels to yours: wife with substance issues, some jail time, I have custody, blah blah blah. I had all the same feelings as you did/do about being an inadequate single parent; like you, I figured it out. Like you, I wanted to be nice, and fair, and to work together with my ex. Some of that is how I am, some of it was driven by guilt and some empathy for her now terrible life.  I'm going to give you a few bits of advice, some of which were not requested.     I hear the implicit value judgment you have about mom's house.  Stop doing that.  The courts will not care, they'll care only if the kids are not in danger, abused, or neglected (meaning getting to school, medical attention when needed, food, and safe place to sleep).  Parents are different, and some of her leniency may be her trying to work the kids a bit to get them to like her more. Put thoughts of that out of your mind, it will not help you. You need to know three things: what you want (your proposed plan), what does your ex want (her proposed plan), and what parenting scheme does your area tend to favor (my own area has a strong bias towards shared 50/50 custody).  Those three pieces of knowledge will guide you in terms of what to do. Always let what you want be guided by what's best for the kids. Does your ex have an attorney? Has she actually filed for a modification of custody?  Since you didn't mention that, I assume that she has not done so.  If I'm right, what I would do, if I were you, is to, within reason, be as accommodating as you can, while leaving your current custody order in place.  As long as she doesn't file, if things ever get ugly(er) that order will protect you, and leave you in control.  Bend over backwards, if you can, to leave that order in place. Stop worrying about what's fair.  During my custody fight, my ex was much more selfish in her requests.  When we got in front of a hearing officer, my ""fair"" request got split down the middle with her selfish request.  Ask for what's right for you, and what you think is best for the kids, let her worry about what's right or fair for her. Give up your ideas about an open and cordial co-parenting arrangement.  You'll be disappointed, and your attempts at that will likely make your ex angry.  Your ideas of openness probably include discussions of stuff that happen during her time that you think aren't right.  Forget that. Her time is her time, just as your time is yours.  Unless there is a health or safety issue, forget about what happens during her time. Personal impression: for a weeknight dinner visit, 5:00 seems too early a start, if one/both of you are working.  For me to get my kid anywhere at 5:00 is a major strain on me, commute wise.  Think about the implications of any proposed exchange or visit time on your life, so that you don't have to re-open when things aren't working. My own custody scheme, by way of example: I have weeknight custody, 1st/3rd weekends, ex gets 2nd/4th/any 5th weekend.  We split holidays, she gets 2 weeks in the summer, each of us gets kids on mothers/fathers day, no matter whose day it is, same on our respective birthdays.  If your kids are athletes or participate in extracurricular activities, make sure and build in provisions that both parties must take kids to their activities during each one's time. I would be amenable to a weeknight visit, but sports and my ex's lack of a driver's license preclude that.   Hope this helped."

I am a little worried that if I do bend over backwards and give her what she asks for in terms of visitation, that may be held against me should she ever decide to take me to court. ie, if I give her week on week off visitation, that may carry over and be enforced by the courts as opposed to a 3, 4 day visitation schedule.   It's all very confusing for me as I'm new to this. I do appreciate and will entertain some of your thoughts. Thank you"

You're definitely right to worry about the courts if you establish 50/50 as the status quo (which it should be under normal circumstances).

Divorce,38f296,divorced12monthslate,3,Wed Jun 3 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"1) Depends on what your leasers agreement says about early termination. If that cost ends up being less then continuing to pay rent and you have no intention to occupy then cancelation is the best option. There's always the option to look into subletting but that's a slippery slope.  The only issue you might have with ending your lease early is that when you go to look for future apartments they may question why that happened but I'd say ""got divorced"" is a pretty solid reason.   2) For a 13 month marriage during which she was gainfully employed alimony shouldn't even enter the discussions. If she brings it up then she's crazy.   Asset division in a divorce is 50/50 so it really doesn't matter if you have separate accounts as it's still considered part of the marital property.  If you're really worried about it take the time to talk to some lawyers, they'll usually give a free 1 hour consultation."

Divorce,38f296,JonnyLay,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it would matter that you paid a bunch of money unnecessarily.  If anything it would look bad, like you were trying to waste money so she wouldn't get as much in the asset split.  Also Florida is not a 50/50 asset split state.  They are an equitably split state.   Meaning a fair split, do the math.     Figure out how much you both made, what you paid for, what she paid for.   How much are your assets worth? If you paid all the bills while she worked and put her earnings into savings, you could easily be entitled to a good portion of the money in her bank account.  You could even be entitled to more than 50%.   Say you made twice as much money as her.  You would both just keep your own cars, and any assets that were owned prior to marriage.  But, if you have 500 dollars in your checking account, and she has 3000.  You subsidized her life and made it possible for her to put that 3000 dollars into savings.  Since you made more, and she didn't put aside a career for your marriage, you could be entitled to more than $1500 from her account.   Personally, I'd just go with a 50/50 split in that situation though."

I was just a bank to her, and the longer she had me fooled, the longer she didn't have to work and I would continue to pay for everything.  I had to go no contact because once I did file and I stopped giving her free money, she suddenly decided she'd make sure I kept paying for the things that she never gave a second thought to before. Car insurance, health insurance? Those should still be ""free"" to her because I was paying them before. And even now she's delaying turning over documents that were requested two months ago, because it just keeps her costs down. I think once our divorce is finalized, and the full impact of what she's going to have to do to move on hits, she's going to finally apologize for what she did."
Divorce,38bz4f,Staggering_genius,2,Wed Jun 3 15:12:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not. But I think she'll do it to try to get me do something for her. That time has passed."
Divorce,38bz4f,recentlydivorceddude,2,Wed Jun 3 08:20:16 2015 UTC,"There's always that one person in the marriage who is clueless. After a 6 month separation, my guy ran into a close mutual friend while out jogging and asked him ""has Offthepoint found anther guy yet""? Meanwhile, I'm home devastated that this has happened to us. He thought I'd just go right out and get another guy as soon as we split. Completely clueless. Our mutual friend said to him, incredulously, ""are you out of your mind? of course not""!"
Divorce,38bz4f,bradbrookequincy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:03:04 2015 UTC,"You say, ""what I had to go through."" But why did you? Is it really her fault you suffered alone? If you didn't have close friends or family to be with or ways to not feel alone, that's not her fault. You didn't need to be a martyr and you don't score any points for wallowing and not taking care of yourself."
Divorce,38bz4f,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:15:51 2015 UTC,"This comment really frustrates me because yes this whole thing was because of her. Yes the failure of our relationship was both of us and more me in a lot of ways but it was her decision to walk away without any attempt at counseling or reconciliation. Waiting until we'd moved her out to her parents when I was away on a difficult course to pull the the plug, her fault.  So yes I do blame her, she made the decision and forced me to live with it.. and it was an artificially easy decision for her, why? Because it didn't cost her anything. No sacrifice. No loneliness. She was allowed to completely move on with distraction and work not confronted daily with the reality and cost of her decision like I was. Was I wallowing? Yeah you know sometimes I had to, because I didn't have any other choice. I live in a small town with no family within 1500km, I can't move because of work, I have no money or approval for travel, and I couldn't live in the gym. What I did do was improve myself, read books, see a social worker, lean on work friends to the max extent I thought appropriate and watch a healthy amount of Netflix. Those were the options available to me and I took every single one, so screw you for assuming I simply chose to sit in a pit of despair and feel bad for myself. I didn't choose it, but I did have to deal with it, so I did. And yes, I guess I am angry with her for having all those resources because it's only now she's seeing how ""real"" it is. It's only now she probably realizes how callous and cruel some of her some of her decisions about us were."
Divorce,38bz4f,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 3 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"We moved to my exe's home town about a year and a half before she decided she didn't want to be married anymore. Granted there were many things that we both needed to work on as individuals and as a couple, but she refused to go to couples therapy at all and just left.   She was able to rely on her extensive support group of friends and family while I was left utterly alone because all of the friends that I had made here were husbands/boyfriends of her friends so they stuck with her. And my family is halfway across the country.  It really sucked, still does, I know how you feel. Well I mostly do, I got a new apartment to make my own.

Divorce,38dw8o,kungfumanda718,3,Wed Jun 3 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"Talk to your mortgage holder, it's possible they might give you other options but in all likely hood your ex will have to refinance."
Divorce,38dw8o,Slowlyloosinghope,3,Wed Jun 3 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"There are some situations where the mortgage lender will allow a loan assumption process to take place.  Essentially, your name comes off and your ex gets to keep the house.  Contact your lender, explain what is happening, and ask them what options are available.    Otherwise, the only other options, especially if you want to get your own place, are refinance in his name only or sell the house.  Do NOT let your name remain on the mortgage for any reason.  If he can't requalify for a loan in his own name, then you do not want to be on the hook for the house if you're not living in it.  Not only will you be unable to get your own loan, but you'll be at risk for any payments he chooses not to make.  And your credit suffers if the payments aren't made."
Divorce,38dw8o,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 3 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"My ex is still on my mortgage because I will not be able to refinance in my own name for ages.  That's something we worked out in our divorce and there is a time limit in which I need to be able to refinance in my own name.  You might be obligated to give him a period of time in which he can refinance, if he wants to keep the house."
Divorce,38dw8o,mykidisonhere,2,Wed Jun 3 18:41:22 2015 UTC,I would be very cautious about being the person who is on the move out side of this sort of agreement. If the person can't refinance in that window what do you do? You could probably get a judge to order the house be listed for sale but it would require a lot more legal expenses.   Any good lawyer would tell you to try to get a divorce agreement that doesn't leave things open for having to go back to court over and over. Get it done
Divorce,38dw8o,toasterchild,2,Thu Jun 4 00:13:27 2015 UTC,"I know.  It's in our decree that I have a decade to refinance, and if I can't then the house goes up for sale.    My ex made a couple of over generous decisions that I wasn't going to turn down.  He even had it added that I can live with someone and collect alimony.  He immediately told his family who loves me, how great he was for doing it.  It was obviously an effort at damage control.  I hate saying nice things about that asshole but... he listened to my plan and how I wanted to go to school and be self sufficient.  He agreed to some of these concession so that they kids could stay in the house they grew up in and the town/school they love.  For my part I will not be collecting alimony forever, like the length of our marriage would have allowed."
Divorce,38dw8o,mykidisonhere,2,Thu Jun 4 02:07:15 2015 UTC,"Some mortgage lenders will let a mortgage be modified, some require a refinance.  Check with the mortgage lender.  In either case, your ex needs to get your name off the deed, so your ex will have to get a quit claim filed with the property recorder's office."
Divorce,38dw8o,albertnacht,2,Thu Jun 4 12:45:37 2015 UTC,"Do not sign anything changing ownership of the house until your obligation to repay the loan is gone. In other words, execute a bargain and sale deed or whatever the mechanism is in your area as part of the refinance."
Divorce,38dw8o,doublenut,2,Thu Jun 4 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"Do not release any claim in the property until you are certain that the property will be refinanced.   The refinancing can not occur if your name is still on the deed.  Both the refinance and the change in ownership have to occur.  One ex needs to get a mortgage on the house in only his/her name, the other ex wants to get off the mortgage.  In order to do this, both the deed and the mortgage need to be in the first ex's name only.  A quit claim is needed to change the deed, a refinance is needed to change the mortgage.  A preliminary agreement or a separation agreement should state how the equity in the house is being split, once that is signed, then the change in ownership of the house and the refinance can take place without risking any loss of the any equity in the house. IANAL, get a attorney to walk you through this."
Divorce,38dw8o,albertnacht,2,Fri Jun 5 10:34:05 2015 UTC,"I did (and I'd recommend OP do as well).  There's no such thing as being ""certain that the property will be refinanced,"" until a new loan is actually secured. A dissolution order only controls the actions of the parties, so it can order one party to try to refinance, but it doesn't control the actions of any lender, including whoever currently holds the promissory note (this is also why the divorce decree should state what happens if refinancing doesn't occur).  Ownership documents will be modified at the closing of the refinancing after the loan offer has already been extended but before it closes. The deed of trust giving the mortgage to the lender under the new terms, and the quitclaim or bargain and sale deed from the other party, are executed then.  If you do it before refinancing is secured, you give up rights like controlling a short sale or foreclosure in the event the house is lost to the lender. Unless there's an upside for you to sign the quitclaim in advance (HOA?) one should definitely speak with an attorney before doing it."
Divorce,38dw8o,doublenut,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm really hoping there is another option, because I was considering buying my own house as its cheaper than rent. I'm not entirely sure he will be able to refinance. :/"
Divorce,38dw8o,Slowlyloosinghope,3,Wed Jun 3 17:27:09 2015 UTC,If he can't afford to refinance then he probably can't afford the house on his own I'm sorry to say. It may be in both of your best interests to sell the house.

Divorce,38d26f,Karissa36,2,Wed Jun 3 13:49:05 2015 UTC,30 miles but it changes jurisdiction. (States actually. )  I'm essentially moving from the north side of my city to the south.   Schools are determined based on the ex's address.   Child support agency is already up to date and nothing is changing there anyway.
Divorce,38d26f,Karissa36,4,Wed Jun 3 14:03:36 2015 UTC,Changing States is frowned upon but it is such a short distance that I think you will be fine.  The main thing is that it won't impact the kid's schools or your parenting time arrangement.

Divorce,38ah0u,Throw_Away_Suddenly,6,Tue Jun 2 23:06:31 2015 UTC,"A few months ago, I thought I was in a GREAT marriage. The day before my husband left, I spent my lunch break discussing possible plans for our upcoming anniversary. I literally had no idea that there was an issue. Suddenly, BOOM. No one else in our lives that I've talked to saw it coming either. Everyone seems genuinely shocked. Me most of all.  In those first (and not-so-first days), I probably would have done almost anything to reconcile. I read everything I could find and tried everything that I could think of. What I found out was that there wasn't anything I could do to make him love me again. I don't regret trying, even if he didn't deserve my effort.  I'm so sorry this is happening to you. It's going to be rough for awhile and it might even feel like it'll never get better. I know me telling you that it will get better probably won't seem believable right now, but I promise that this is survivable. It will get better. There are so many of us here that have been in your shoes - so many of us felt the desperation and panic that you're experiencing. We're still kicking and you'll make it through too.  Hang in there. There are better days in your future."

For me, some things are definitely better. I found a hobby that I really really enjoy. I'm planning on some big changes that I needed to make a lot sooner, but my STBX discouraged me from taking the risks. I have re-discovered that I am pretty creative and capable of fixing (and improving!) things around the house. Even though things have been really really rough at times, I think I actually have turned into a much more positive, hopeful person who thinks she can actually make a difference in the world - I'm glad (sort of) that I'm not letting someone cover my light anymore.  Are things perfect? Not even close. Still much negotiation is in my future and there's a lot of uncertainty. It took a long time before I was ready to stop wearing my rings or take down my wedding photos. I have days when I don't feel like I can face the world, moments of anger, moments of sadness and loss.  Overall though, I think honestly better off without someone who wasn't willing to let me fly. I'm glad I don't have to ask permission anymore. I might not be successful, but at least I'll have the chance to try."

I don't know your situation, but I've known dozens of couples that ended with divorce over cheating when one spouse was completely clueless.  My neighbor's wife was cheating on him, and we never knew. She met a guy online and was seeing him when she went ""grocery shopping"" and at time she said she had gone up to the kids' school.    One of my closest friends is a divorce lawyer and he explicitly told me this one time before: If your spouse says they want a divorce (out of the blue) and they're under 40, 99% chance there is someone else. If it comes out of the blue and you're older than 40, 90% chance there is someone else.  His point is people will stay until they find something else to move onto."

I'm not saying that it's definitely what's going on here but like /u/Slyfrog said it feels to me like another guy is involved. With all the comments about having never loved you and how you do everything wrong. But that's my own experience so who knows.   She may be alone now because the other guy didn't think anything more of the affair than it just being an affair and didn't want it to be a full blown relationship like she thought it was going to be.

I was happily married and then over the course of two months dwindled to miserable as I watched my wife leave without ever giving an adequate reason why.  I was really bad for three months.  I still cry sometimes.  My STBX started smoking again too, and went back to eating meat, which she hadn't done in 6 years and always said she wouldn't / didn't want to.  She's alone all the time, is drinking our smoking every time I see her, etc.  How can she be miserable when she is the one who decided to leave? It sure seems like a life crisis, and it sounds that way for you too.  My stbx has since mentioned being interested in therapy and possibly reconciliation 4 months later and I have no idea what caused the change of heart.  But I'm tired of being depressed and want to be happy again.  You can realize that you have value and that there are other people who will see it.  That's what started to help me.

Divorce,38ah0u,allwrongs,2,Wed Jun 3 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"If I were a betting man I'd take odds on this: She's fixated on or pining for another married guy.  Probably from her work.  I won't speculate on whether it's already physical.  She feels guilty for this and has gone through all of your marital/personal history to come up with reasons why you've brought this upon yourself.  You haven't - and her brooding likely reflects moments in which she realizes she's done you wrong.  If my hypothesis is correct (and it's just a hypothesis) she is trying to signal to the other party that she is ready to go all-in.  If true, these things never end well (emotionally, financially, etc.) for the woman in my experience.    I have two reasons I'd bet on this 1) it happened to me (divorced 7 years ago) and 2) in the ensuing 7 years I've met and/or dated a dozen women with a similar profile - trying to rebuild a prior life that they themselves blew up.  There's not always another guy but it's usually the case.  Ironically, some of the more 'ethical' women will actually begin separation around just the thought of a romantic relationship with someone else - that is, the cheating is mental rather than physical.    She may at some point realize she's made a mistake but you need to move forward now as if that will never happen.  Certainly, no real reconciliation could occur until you two worked through the cause of her sudden change - whatever the reason.  You may decide at that point rebuilding the relationship is more work than you can do.  That was my decision.    Now for the uplifting part:  It gets better.  Waaay better.  You are young with a solid career.  There were no children - you can literally go out and build a strong awesome life to your design.  When you do so, you're going to meet and impress lots new people and some of those connections will become genuinely romantic.  Just don't rush it.  Take your time, feel grief and learn from this experience.  Divorce is brutal but that's why it's lessons can be so profound."
Divorce,38ab1t,Conosk,3,Tue Jun 2 22:25:11 2015 UTC,Depending on your area that could just be forms and not the court costs.   Assuming you're talking an uncontested divorce call your county court house they may well have a packet of papers available on their website to allow you to self-file.
Divorce,38ab1t,Catcherofsouls,2,Tue Jun 2 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely depends on where you are at. I know for me, the filing cost along is right about $200, so not sure how a place could claim doing it for so little for forms, filing, etc. Plus I hate to say it, some national websites may not have current forms, or all of the forms, etc. Be wary. You can always go to your local county superior clerk's website and look. Many times there is a ""packet"" of forms you can look at, or at least a list of what it takes to file. It might give you a better idea of what you might be getting or not getting with whatever website you are looking at."
Divorce,38ab1t,baucker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"Those websites just ask you a bunch of questions and pre-populate the same packet that the courts give you for free. You will still have the filing, service, and court costs as if you filled out the forms yourself."

Divorce,38a1uu,Catcherofsouls,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:18:41 2015 UTC,OMG. I was just wondering where I could find a guy like this.   That's not how divorce works. You don't get to keep the old lifestyle forever.
Divorce,38a1uu,abloodyminge,3,Wed Jun 3 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"if I do end up paying child support, then technically, I AM paying for her to take care of the kids.   What is the current parenting time situation?  Paying child support isn't ""paying her to take care of your kids"", it's  paying a percentage of their expenses.  It's good that you have spoken to your attorney instead of talking legal advice from your ex!  Before she became disabled, was she working? Were the kids in school?"
Divorce,38a1uu,anisaerah,2,Wed Jun 3 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"In her mind, I should be willing to do whatever I can (including work extra) so that she can stay in the marital home (or a decent-sized apt) and continue to homeschool/raise the kids. If that means me having to work extra to support myself, so be it. She said that because we had been married for so long, I should have the responsibility of supporting her financially due to her disability until she can get a decent job again. That I should pay for her to take care of the kids during the day b/c that's in their best interest. She believes that putting them in school is NOT in their best interest, and if she was forced to work full-time out of the house, then our kids will be worse off having to go to school.   Yeah that's the neat thing about divorce, one person doesn't get to keep the status quo of their life while the other person pays for it. Child Support and Spousal support are very real possibilities but don't agree to pay more than your state dictates. It sucks that she's disabled but from what you've said it isn't a disability that cuts her off from all kinds of employment options.   It's your job to take care of your children. She's divorcing you and doesn't want to work on the marriage or the relationship, which is fine considering the circumstances, but that also means she needs to wake up and realize that you have no responsibility towards her or her care once you're divorced."
Divorce,38a1uu,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Wed Jun 3 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you.  My point exactly.  Am I responsible for the kids?  Sure.  But her using the kids as an ""excuse"" to live a better lifestyle doesn't sit well with me.  She was like, ""have you even thought about how hard it is going to be for me & the kids if I have to move out of the house into a crappy apt?""  Excuse me, but that's exactly what I had to do when you kicked me out.  And the kids already spend half their nights in an apt, they will deal just fine spending all their time in an apt."
Divorce,38a1uu,Slowlyloosinghope,2,Wed Jun 3 14:47:16 2015 UTC,Well part of that might be her continuing to blame you for the failure of the marriage and wanting some sort of retribution for that. Which is an unfortunate reality of what you'll have to deal with going forward if she can't find some way to forgive you and take responsibility for her own life and not blame every bad thing in it on you.   Either way if you live in a no fault state she's up the creek without a paddle. 50/50 split is standard unless you suddenly decide to fall on your sword and decide to pay her everything she asks for and more.   You have a lawyer right?
Divorce,38a1uu,raeraeinla,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"You do have some good points about the transition from homeschooling to public schooling should that happen.  I know it will be difficult but we will do our best to help out our kids as much as possible.  She's in her early 40s and she was working almost full-time from home (for the past 5+ years) up until she became disabled.  Kids are 16, 10, and 5 and they have all been homeschooled their whole lives.    She has the kids during the day, and then the nights are split evenly (I have them 2 nights, she has them 2 nights, and we split weekends).    I'm not against paying for spousal/child support, don't get me wrong.  But I don't feel like I should be shouldering the financial burden, say 80% compared to her 20%.  And when I say disabled, she is unable to return to her previous job (basically sitting at a computer b/c that causes her discomfort/pain), but she is able to get around and move around."
Divorce,38a1uu,doublenut,0,Wed Jun 3 00:26:07 2015 UTC,What could she do for work if she's too disabled for a desk job?

I can't lie, get caught, and then turn on my tears to make it go away.   You could try, but perjury is illegal regardless of gender. There is no legal basis for your statement.   As a man, file an order of protection, it's denied. File one as a woman, it's granted.   No, that's not how it works.   As a woman, violate the order of protection daily, and provably attempt to bait the other party into breaking it daily (""I won't tell, I miss you!""), oh well. As a man, send an Easter bunny card to your kid, go to jail (because the bunny card was so scary and threatening, y'know!) Also, as a woman you can wait three weeks after the event to pull the trigger on ""violation."" One day before it expires, just because you can.   If you have a protection order, you can file a motion regarding the violation of it regardless of what gender you are.  If you have an order of protection imposed that covers your child, yes, sending them a card is a violation.   It's not just a bad financial move; it's dangerous for men to get married.   Every negative thing you have provided applies equally to women.  Remember, the one commonality in all your bad relationships is you."
Divorce,386g2w,rasconjon,3,Tue Jun 2 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree with a lot of what he said...but the order of protection I do agree on.   If you try to file an order of protection as a male, it's less likely to get granted because the court doesn't see a male as threatened by a female. Especially an athletic in-shape male, who feels constantly threatened and harassed by his ex or STBX."

My stbx hasn't been able to pay her attorney since December when I had to pay 100% for the second mediation session. At least that's what she told me, my attorney, the mediator, and her attorney. It's also probably why her attorney won't response to MY attorney with requested discovery documents, as well as trying to schedule a trial date. Stbx's attorney maybe has to call her to say, ""Take whatever offer he gives you. And since that means probably very little money, I want my cut first.""  My attorney has already advised me not to pay her fees, and I won't unless a judge orders me. Past behavior by my wife leads me to think a judge wouldn't, but I may catch the judge on a bad day, so who knows.

Hit the gym hard, buy some new and sensibly affordable clothing (keeping in mind your new financial situation), take up some new social hobbies on the cheap.  Additionally, sometimes us girls are a sucker for a man in a rebuilding stage when he's being tough.

I understand that people praise divorce here but largely it's a shitty and cruel thing that should be avoided and not celebrated. Dismissively parroting, ""the kids will be all right,"" is just an adult's excuse for being too immature/unwilling to actually do the work of modeling a successful relationship and everything to do with greener grass and indifference.

I work with another county so it was hard for me too, hours were the same as the court house and it was 45 mins away. Just take things step by step if you have to be the one to file. One day, go ask your questions. Another day, start filing. See if it's possible to move your lunch to an odd time so every one isn't going to the court house at the same time of day. Finally, talk to your supervisor about your situation. I did with mine and she was very understanding and let me take long lunches or leave an hour early if I needed.   There's going to be sacrifices, it's not an easy process like depositing a check online. And it will take a long time. Think about a legal separation for a while instead if you find yourself making excuses to not go.   If you want this done by the end of the year, START NOW.
