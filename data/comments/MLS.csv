MLS,3e2p76,collin2387,29,Tue Jul 21 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"AH, makes sense. Give Highbury a shot. Nomad exists but I'm not a huge fan (though they do a great job for the World Cup). 3 Lions opened a new place on the East Side called Red Lion, but I'd imagine the clientele is similar."
MLS,3e2p76,PostCoitalTears,4,Tue Jul 21 15:11:17 2015 UTC,I live in Milwaukee but haven't been to any of the aforementioned places. Care to share your top couple of bars?
MLS,3e2p76,Pharaca,7,Tue Jul 21 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"Three Lions has more people who are European ex-pats, etc. It is a great establishment, but I can see how one would easily end up sitting next to a Eurosnob. Highbury is the home of AO Milwaukee, and might as well be renamed AO Bayview for both geographic and cultural reasons. Nomad is about as hit or miss as it can be. When they do soccer, they do it right and they do it big. When there is a Packer game on, forget watching a derby match, every TV will have American football in the ""soccer bar."" If you are downtown, Upper 90 and brat house are both decent."
MLS,3e2p76,collin2387,4,Tue Jul 21 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"You are correct on all counts. If you ever see a guy in the Brat House wearing a Crew jersey, say hello and I'll by you a drink...even if you are a F*re fan."
MLS,3e2p76,collin2387,5,Tue Jul 21 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"DEFINITELY. My favorite bar for all things sports and non-sports is the Milwaukee Brat House on Old World Third by the Old German Beer Hall. It's a good place to watch US matches, but there won't be a ton of soccer fans unless it's a big tournament. The Highbury in Bayview is the go-to for the American Outlaws and for early morning EPL games. The Nomad on Brady is a great place to catch World Cup finals (they typically close down part of Brady for that) or the EPL, but it's a little too hip for my taste. Jack's on Brady Street is owned by an Englishman who is a Chelsea fan, so there is always soccer on, but it's not really a soccer pub. Red Lion, also on the East Side, probably has the best food of the bunch, and is a really good place for English-leaning fans to watch a match (had a great time watching the Merseyside Derby there last winter)."

I live in Milwaukee and the 3 Lions is the ONLY place I'll go for games, yeah I've been to the Highbury, the Nomad, and even the new Red Lion and they're all great in their own right, but I absolutely love the 3 Lions. The staff is 75% British and I know most all of them. They go out of their way to put the Galaxy on TV when I ask them, heck one bartender pulled out his laptop and let my girlfriend and I watch LA vs Toronto on the 4th when it wasn't on normal TV; mind you this was a busy Saturday night and we were sitting at the bar.  Don't want this to sound like a rant but I speak for all my friends at the 3 Lions and can assure you that this isn't the atmosphere that you normally find there. Seriously, this is absolutely out of character. I swear I do not work for the 3 Lions but if you let them know you had a negative experience they will happily give you a beer and free food.  I've gone to the tailgates and matches at Miller Park with them as well as their trips to Chicago and never once had a negative experience (well other than getting too inebriated from the stiff drinks they make).  I am really upset to see the 3 Lions talked about in a negative light and urge everyone who is reading this to go there and find out for yourselves what an awesome place it is to watch soccer."

Eurosnobs are drawn to these foreign clubs and leagues because they are so different than American sports. They hate MLS because it is a North American league. Even if MLS gave in totally to pro/rel, silly European names, and a total European club system, it still would be too American for them.   They don't want soccer to be popular in the U.S. because they want their clique to remain small and pure. George Vecsey, an admitted Eurosnob, said this in a chat many years ago and that soccer was still fighting an identity war in the U.S. The Euro posers vs. the growing new fans who want the U.S. to rule the soccer world.   The normal North American reaction is to want whatever North American league we have to be the best in the world. To be the dominant force like the NFL, NBA, MLB, ect. The Eurosnob is different. They want Europe, and specifically England, to remain the center of their soccer universe. Thankfully, this is changing as MLS gets more established every year and soccer becomes more popular.

They hate MLS because it is a North American league. Even if MLS gave in totally to pro/rel, silly European names, and a total European club system, it still would be too American for them.

Hipsters don't want their music/culture/etc to become popular because then they wouldn't be part of their cool little clique.  I think their are these types of fans/nerds/geeks in every culture.  Sports fandom, as I've come to understand, is simply another form of nerdity, or geekdom.    Comic book nerds know the inner workings of the comics world they follow.  They know all about every inch of it.  You would think most would be happy that their favorite pasttime is getting popular through movies, etc., but some are downright belligerent because they don't think others have the right to join their club.  Football fanatics are the same way.  They know the inner workings (down to last season's stats) for their favorite teams.  I have a friend who is obsessive about the Carolina Panthers worse than anyone he might term a ""nerd.""  If someone claims to be a fan of the team, he asks them who the owner is, who plays left tackle...if you can't tell him, he dubs you ""NOT A FAN.""  Because for him, you have to put in the work to be a true fan.  I think soccer is the same way.  Some of these guys liked it before it grew in popularity.  The fact that popular is growing in the US drives these guys insane.  They think that people haven't put in the work yet to really be a fan.  They didn't follow the sport when you had to find it hiding in places, and now that it is big everyone else is simply a poser.  It's a ridiculous mentality."

MLS,3e2p76,AbstergoSupplier,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's totally fair. I'm in favor of promotion and relegation because it makes the sport more interesting, and as a season ticket holder for the NBA's Timberwolves, I wish we had relegation in the NBA to give us something to play for every year after the first month of the season. Instead, the entire season becomes meaningless, and teams essentially try to be terrible to get a better draft pick. I'm also in favor of doing away with trades, and make the transfer of players more akin to the European soccer model, which I prefer.   Maybe I'm a eurosnob, I don't know.   I travel to England every year to watch games because I enjoy the atmosphere and the travel. I'm a season ticket holder at the local NASL team, too. I root for the U.S. National team but I also follow the English national team with interest simply because as a fan of the English leagues, I am familiar with the players. Not having a language barrier makes following England at both national and club level easier.   We all use terms like ""pitch"" and ""boots"". It's part of the lingua Franca of the game on some level, and MLS staff in broadcasting booths with Brits doesn't help that. Calling it football or soccer doesn't really matter. I use the two interchangeably. I have literally no interest in American football, and using the term ""American football"" might make me a eurosnob or a dick.   Ultimately, the dudes OP ran into were jerks. But there are jerks everywhere. Lots of fan groups try to be exclusionary to make themselves feel better. The American Outlaws have had some bad press recently too, and they aren't accused of being eurosnobs. Assholes are assholes. Plain and simple."

MLS,3e2p76,cfot,7,Tue Jul 21 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"As others have said: ignore them. Or find better places to watch at.   I'm in Chicago and a Manchester City fan. I became a MC fan when I lived in ATX. The ATX MC group was great, always a lot of fun, everyone very social and just enjoying the game. The Chicago group just takes it way, way too hardcore, mostly since they are brit expats.  They yell at people for not coming to games (sorry, the games are at 9 AM and I live on the other side of town. I'm not gonna be there every week). Any questioning of the team's decisions results in rabid Brits questioning your loyalty to the team. Any praise of other teams results in the same. (I got bitched at for talking with a Tottenham fan and saying how good Kane looked this year, how they were improving and I generally liked watching them). I don't even like the bar they hang out at, people getting wasted and yelling at 9 AM just isn't my scene. I have friends who are Chelsea and Arsenal supporters, and their groups have always been welcoming even as a non-fan. They constantly shit on MLS until NYCFC showed up, and now that's there team....even though they all live in Chicago and have no connection to NYC (unlike me, a native of the area).  There are a good number people I do like in the MCFC group here, but some of the people are too intense for my liking. It's a game, you know. One of the best conversations I had at that bar was watching the Derby with a United Fan, QPR fan, and a Arsenal fan  But there's better people out there. Sometimes my neighbors come over and we'll watch whatever game is entertaining. There's a great bar here in Chicago called Cleo's where there's no real supporters group, just people hanging out, enjoying a few beers, discussing the action and enjoying their morning - and they have great food. The Fire games I've been to, for all their shittiness, have always been a great time and I've met new people.   Don't let it discourage you. Try other bars. See if your friends like soccer and have breakfast parties where you make breakfast and watch the games together. And hey, if you ever want to come to Chicago down the road sometime, the beer is on me."

MLS,3e2p76,kmurphy246,4,Tue Jul 21 17:22:48 2015 UTC,The difference is whether or not you continue to follow the US and the Fire. I don't consider someone a bandwagon fan if they stick with the team no matter what even if it is Manchester United.

If you've been raised to think that your hometown team winning the World Series is the ultimate joy in life, then you'll never find baseball boring.

And before all the new rules in the NFL to protect the players (good luck with that!), football scores used to be 21-7, 14-10, which are essentially 3-1, 2-2-type soccer scores.  I stopped watching the NFL last year, but I'd occasionally scan the scores and they were always crazy high, 52-33, 42-27, things like that.  Defense no longer exists in the NFL."

MLS,3e2p76,boredinproperty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:56 2015 UTC,I'd be far more interested in baseball if they played just 1 game a week. The level of strategy would be really interesting. And teams would value the star starting pitchers like NFL teams value their quarterback.
MLS,3e2p76,sawillis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"The strategy is interesting. And there is star value to your number one, maybe your number two pitcher. Roster management and Bull pen management can make baseball a game of chess. How they pitch the ball can lead to guys grounding out versus getting air. It's all super strategic. By far the sport with the most ""science"" behind it. And as far as the number of games, each game is different. They all feel drastically different. Games in the same series all feel different. Each game depending on the pitcher, the Stadium, and the line up changes everything about the feel of the game."
MLS,3e2p76,timberrich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:21 2015 UTC,The strategy is interesting but currently with so many games then I can't be bothered to care who wins any individual game. Its like the first 80% of the season is preseason games. Cutting it down to 1 or 2 games a week would make it FAR more interesting to me.
MLS,3e2p76,Epcot92,4,Tue Jul 21 19:58:09 2015 UTC,"As a result of this time crunch I have noted that I really enjoy watching soccer as the games are extremely quick and only as for a 1.75 hours of my time.   I grew up playing soccer, but never really cared to watch it growing up. Always enjoyed American football, especially college, more. That is, until the last 4-6 years when I started to value my time more. Since then, I've probably watched hundreds of full soccer games, and only a dozen or so full football games. For exactly the same reason you mention, games are only 2 hours. Football can take 3.75+ hours sometimes, and there are so many damn commercial breaks. I always have a good laugh now when someone says to me that soccer is too slow and boring compared to football.   I was belittled, it was like I was not part of some exclusive club especially when I could not identify either of the teams playing. I told the guy that I cheer for the Chicago Fire and Team USA and instantly i was labeled as ""A poser Team USA Fan""   Also, fuck those guys."
MLS,3e2p76,timberrich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:50 2015 UTC,I know several people that just record football games and start watching the beginning towards the end of the third quarter. They just skip through the commercials and usually finish the game live.

Calling yourself a hard core fan of a team that you likely can never easily get to a game live is far more plastic and poser than anything here in the US IMO."

What about the fans who can't afford to watch their hometown team but religiously follow the team via social media, news outlets and never miss a match on t.v.?  Would you say they are less fans then the ones with season tickets but never show up on time and are on their phones for most of the match?"

People telling strangers who they should and shouldn't root for are just dicks in general, regardless of which ""side"" they're on. You don't get to determine my fandom, or how I choose to express it. As long as a person is genuinely a fan or genuinely wants to become a fan they should root for whoever the hell they want."

For some reason, it's just limited to soccer where apparently to be a fan, you have to watch every game in person."
MLS,3e2p76,sawillis,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"I think this attitude stems from the inter-league competition that is normal in soccer but not really heavily present in any other sport. Baseball, Football, and hockey don't have anything that resembles the Champions league.   Only adding on to the competition, UEFA ranks its leagues and your ranking decides where your team can enter into the tournament. In college basketball, your league may decide what your seed is but every team enters the tournament--more or less--at the same level."

Even when playing soccer I get so much more easily riled up than in any other sport. Throw into that the tribalism of club culture and you can see how these situations arise."
MLS,3e2p76,sawillis,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"I love soccer, and I feel like regular season games in soccer have a lot of excitement compared to other sports, but for me there's nothing like the Stanley Cup playoffs to get me worked up.

I love MLS, USL, NASL, and US Soccer. I'm just as much a hardcore supporter of the Carolina Railhawks as I am of Liverpool, I also follow Wilmington in the USL. This whole generalizing people is what is fucked up and just because someone supports something you don't doesn't automatically make them a poser or ""plastic"".

MLS,3e2p76,Ragnar_Targaryen,6,Tue Jul 21 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"Would you call me a plastic fan?   I'm a New Englander who follows the Portland Timbers quite religiously. A few years back, I fell in love with the Timbers brand, TA, Timbers players (Nagbe particularly) and the people of Portland.   I was never able to fall in love with the New England Revolution in the same way because they just didn't spark anything in me. I went to the NYCFC vs. NE Revs match last Saturday and I still felt a strong disconnect from the Revs and the ""Fort"". I feel more connection to Portland games and the TA when I watch games on TV than I do sitting 2 sections away from the Fort. It just doesn't do it for me.   Therefore, would you call me a plastic fan since I'm technically 3000 miles away from Oregon, I've never stepped foot in Oregon, and I have no connection to the Timbers other than my emotional connection (i.e. no family connection)."
MLS,3e2p76,sawillis,13,Tue Jul 21 15:49:59 2015 UTC,I would say I don't understand how it happened.
MLS,3e2p76,minidanjer,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"Well I just explained how it happened haha   New England and The Fort didn't get me excited to watch their games. I mainly watched their games because I was a fan of soccer, I couldn't fall in love with a team that just didn't excite me.   The Portland Timbers, on the other hand, get me excited to watch their games, whether they win or lose. I think my lack of knowing how to explain my ""passion"" is quite explanatory of my passion for the club. I don't know how to explain my passion, but I certainly know how it feels."

MLS,3e2p76,dac0605,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"From my experience in the past 2 years of having Fort season tickets, whenever the stadium has a really high attendance number the Fort sucks. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the Fort is GA and many people who come out and sit in this section don't actually know and/or care about what the supporters in the Fort do. People from throughout the stadium switch seats and sit/stand in the Fort just to be there and don't actively participate. It's kind of a shame really.  In regards to the other discussion, the way I look at sports in the US is that you should always support/follow your home team first. Unless of course you know someone personally that plays for another team. Secondary teams are cool, like the numerous people I know who follow European soccer... which is really cool to be able to watch early in the morning on weekends when nothing else is on. But I don't have any really connection to any team, so it's just kind of a situation of ""hey, soccer's on. Cool."" I try to follow Feyenoord because that's where my family grew up a long time ago (there's my sort of connection), but the Dutch league isn't aired in the US unless it's on ESPN3 rarely."
MLS,3e2p76,AlpineSummit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't mean to snide The Fort or anything, it just didn't do it for me; kind of like how some people like vanilla ice cream and some don't.   Growing up, the Revolution were always my number one team because of the local tie. Hell, one of my friends was in the Revs academy. However, that was the only connection I had with them, there was no emotional attachment or what not. That passion I have with the Boston Bruins and New England Patriots were just completely absent when I cheered for the Revolution."

MLS,3e2p76,AlpineSummit,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"Nah. You chose a team that fits you more. You watch the games, know the players, and participate in discussions about the team. Hypothetically  if the Timbers were absolutely terrible for the next 5 you would still stick with the team. I would say these qualities far outweigh distance. I'm also sure that in the future you intend to attend a match at Providence Park and that you'll absolutely love it.  I find this whole plastic fan thing in /r/mls kinda funny given the league has only been around for 20 years and even less for most teams.

I'm sad to say I never got to a USL Timbers game when I was there.  I got into soccer during the 2010 World Cup and then that same year when the Rapids won the MLS Cup. It was fun and exciting. I tried hard to be a Rapids fan, got season tickets for a while but could never get into the experience of being a fan at the stadium. Then in 2011 I went to the Timber's first MLS game in Colorado. I managed to get tickets to games in PDX whenever I went back to visit friends. I found myself following them more, and looking forward to games, even if they were on TV, more than I would the Rapids.  I love the Timbers, follow them regularly, and get to go to 1-3 of their games per year. I wish I could support my local club more...but I just can't bring myself to."
MLS,3e2p76,sawillis,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:58 2015 UTC,"This just sounds too similar to me (are you sure you're not the future me or something).   I actually had more fun sitting with the TA at Gillette Stadium last year than I ever did watching any Revolution game. The TA actually sent a Capo from Portland to New England to help lead the chants and I thought that was so cool. We marched from the Patriot Place parking lot (I bought the tickets through the TA website so I knew where to park with the TA) to the stadium and I still have a video of the 30-40 of us marching in there. Just imagine a rag-tag bunch of 30-40 people dressed in green&gold marching into the massive Gillette Stadium. We chanted the WHOLE game and didn't stop once. By the end of the game, Revolution staff had to expand our section because we attracted so many casual fans over to us.   The game ended in a 1-1 draw in which Ridgy got his first goal in MLS and invented the Ridgy roll.   10/10 loved watching the Timbers tear it up at Gillette Stadium. Can't wait for next summer when they're back."

If you ever have a chance, I would highly recommend visiting the NW and getting to some games and exploring Portland or Seattle. I went to the Seattle Away match last year, and even though the Timbers lost, it was one of the best sporting experiences I've ever had. There were probably several thousand of the TA marching through Seattle to the stadium. The Denver Away matches are a ton of fun too because the Rapids supports host a great tail gate that the TA is invited to with awesome beer and friendly bantering."

I watch MLS and consider myself a hard core fan of the league, but haven't had a club until now...well 2017.  I don't just watch soccer for soccer's sake...I will watch international tournaments and the Champions League Final, but I don't have the time to watch everything.  I do love MLS and am beyond happy that finally the South will have a team.  So if I never could latch onto a team seven hours away even with getting MLS live for the last 7/8 years, I obviously will not be able to comprehend how someone could love something that they odds are have never laid their own eyes on."

It never felt like I picked them, it felt like I was alway part of them from a very young age.    Maybe it is me just being in the SEC mindset, where your close local team is decided at an early age and there is no switching.  Where going to games are more important than watching on TV.  Where no research is required, you just know what you are at a young age and you know for life.  Where you know instantly that the guy down the street is a fan of your rival and you plan accordingly.  Where it isn't about the wallet."

MLS,3e2p76,arrowheadt,60,Tue Jul 21 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"Calling yourself a hard core fan of a team that you likely can never easily get to a game live is far more plastic and poser than anything here in the US IMO.   I disagree with this, and I think this attitude is part of why it seems like even other soccer fans find soccer fans in America so insufferable. Rather than just enjoying the game, everyone's trying to one-up each other on what's authentic and what's plastic - the 'Eurosnobs' who sneer at MLS are part of that, but the hardest core MLS fans who sneer at people for following European soccer are a problem, too.  I like watching soccer. I like watching local soccer. I also like watching European soccer. Why can't we all just get along?"
MLS,3e2p76,SalvadorsDeli,21,Tue Jul 21 15:31:17 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have cared about MLS had I not cared about the US national team and Arsenal first. I like to watch soccer. I'm going to watch soccer. I don't care where its from. I'm going to watch it regardless.
MLS,3e2p76,AbstergoSupplier,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"I think the issue arises, for me at least, when someone from Kansas or wherever it may be not only watches European soccer, but declares themselves and ardent hardcore supporter of a certain team that they have just picked out of a hat. I mean, what relationship does Joe Average from the US have to a club in North London? My guess would be nothing, and it is therefore at the very least objectionable that he/she is supporting that one club, especially when local soccer needs all the support it can get.  Sure, watch European Soccer, we all enjoy it, but don't claim to support a club you have no connection to, especially when it's always either Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool or Arsenal."
MLS,3e2p76,sawillis,6,Tue Jul 21 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"Why is this so objectionable to you? I can understand there being some frustration if they support a foreign team and ignore your local team, but their fandom isn't a personal attack on your club. Some people take more time than others to appreciate that the game they love is being played right down the street. If they actually look down on their local club (aka the classic Eurosnob) they're probably an asshole, and it's probably not limited to soccer. Either way, that person's support isn't going to make or break your club and your fanbase.     Why do you have the right to tell a person how they get to feel about a club? What's next, mandating that people attend X number of games per year to be determined a ""true fan""? To me this ""real fan"" snobbery is just as arrogant as people who don't watch MLS because it's not as high in quality as Europe."
MLS,3e2p76,General_Beauregard,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"I like to think I have a connection to Fulham, entirely having to do with FulhAmerica. It was honestly very cool to see them give so many of our guys a shot in England. I loved watching the 2008 great escape, led by McBride, Keller, Dempsey, and then to see Dempsey do so well in the successive seasons. It's just sad that they are no longer PL. I still cheer my heart out for them, and Emerson Hyndman continues the tradition!"
MLS,3e2p76,GiveMeSomeRaptorNews,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"Sure, watch European Soccer, we all enjoy it, but don't claim to support a club you have no connection to, especially when it's always either Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool or Arsenal.   To offer a counter-perspective - sports fandom, in general, is kind of a silly thing. Sure, we are all intrinsically attracted to the local team, but even the idea of the local team has lost some of that meaning over the years if the players themselves come from all over. In most cases, people will most closely identify with their local team, and the fact that it's simply easier and more fun [from the standpoint of getting to attend games and having that team be part of the fabric in your community], to be a fan of your local team makes that the default - that's why every domestic team across the major sports that I root for is either a DC or Baltimore team.   But that doesn't necessarily mean it's the ONLY way to feel connected as a fan. And once you feel a connection, even if it's built on strange reasons, it's sort of hard to stop, even if you know on some level that it's irrational. There's a poster in this thread who was talking about how he's from Boston but fell in love with the Timbers - Boston is about as far from London as it is from Portland - would you say that he has no claim to supporting the Timbers since he has about as much connection to there as a kid in Boston who supports Chelsea?   The reasons I originally became an Arsenal fan are almost comically arbitrary - I was an impressionable 8 year old during France '98, in a foreign land, realized soccer/sports was the only way I could relate to my Indian cousins, and Dennis Bergkamp became my favorite player that summer. None of those facts should really connect into me starting to take an interest in a team in North London for the next 17 years, but it still did. I know that my relationship to Arsenal is far different, and inherently more detached, than a North London native, and I'm fine with that - I'm not out to be the bigger fan than anyone else, my relationship with the team I root for is about me and the club, rather than me vs. other fans and the club.   And that's how most people's stories are. As far as how Americans start rooting for EPL clubs, there's no actual good ""reason"" why you should feel start feeling connected to that team - but you still do. At this stage, I don't know why Arsenal means something to me, but I know it does, and I can't well quell that. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm board with all of the things that I've come to associate with American EPL fan culture [for example, I'm all for going to the bar on a Saturday morning and watching the game with like-minded fans, and by all means, learn your team's songs, but please oh please don't sing in a fake British accent]... but I understand that people's passions are real, even if it doesn't particularly make sense. No one's obligated to root for their local team, necessarily - I think it's great when they do, but the MLS will grow because people want to be a part of it, not because they feel like they have to be a part of it.   As far as the Eurosnob is concerned, you're not a Eurosnob in my book if you happen to only watch European leagues/teams. That only captures half of the term. The snobbery part comes if you use that fact to look down upon others - but that's an individual character judgment, not an indicment of the team/league you watch. It shouldn't be a count against someone's character if they're an American soccer fan but not an MLS fan. And if you're the kind of soccer/MLS-evangelist who wants to convert people, from a practicality standpoint, you're also far less likely to win those folks over if you hold it against them that they don't already support their local.   Sorry for the giant wall of text and hodgepodgey response - thinking out loud here for the most part, this is an interesting subject that I've been thinking about more as I've been coming to this sub more. I think at the heart of it, there's still a lot of confusion over whether there's a ""right"" way to be an American soccer fan. My view on it: There isn't. The way you do it is the way you do it, and no one has a right to tell you that you're doing it wrong. The most important rule, as with most things, is just that you better not be an asshole about it."

MLS,3e2p76,Ksn0,7,Tue Jul 21 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I'm going to argue the plastic argument, first with an anecdote, then with a logical explanation as to encompass the rest of society.  I'm DC United first and foremost. But, when I started paying attention to soccer after the 2010 World Cup, the team I loved playing on FIFA whatever number was Dortmund. Their crest, kit design, and colors appealed to me. I also played MLS teams too, and discovered DC United, a team an hour or so from my house that I didn't even know existed. I began following both of those clubs as well as learned about big name players around the world (FIFA commentary always had extra little bits of information about big name players, so I could easily identify who was who and who to look more into on youtube for example).   The more I played, the more comfortable I felt with the game and its rules, the big teams, and teams I actually have links to through ancestry. I found out that my great grandfather came from Cefalu, a small city east of Palermo. I studied the team and fell in love; it was a natural fit somehow.  Finally, and this happened just the other week, actually. I like to think I've become fairly knowledgeable of the game and the teams that comprise leagues around the world. However, I never really had any type of connection with an English team. I know another part of my ancestry comes from the southern region of England, London and lower, but there are shitloads of teams in that area to choose from. Nothing felt right, so I couldn't get lucky like that again. Fast forward to two weeks ago, and I'm hanging out on the field of PPL Park for a camping session. The following morning, leaving the stadium, I run into the entire Bournemouth team in a training session. I take pictures like a typical fan, hang out with a friend who is doing the same. Then, Jeff Mostyn, the chairman, comes over and has a chat with us. Additionally, the media team strikes up a conversation, and a few players come over after practice. It was an awesome, spontaneous experience. The impact of it turned me into a fan of the Cherries INSTANTLY. It was the spark I needed to really want to pull for a team in England.  So yeah, those are my stories as to why I follow three teams from abroad.  Now, to summarize it, and why it's not plastic. Everyone has their reasons why they want to follow a team. They have a connection somehow, whether it's through a friend or family that lives in the town or roots for that team, or maybe it's a long lost lineage of some sort. Maybe a fan wants to root for a team for the aesthetics (if this is the case, I highly recommend FC Girondins de Bordeaux...their kits are 10/10 every year). Maybe it's just because they like a player or a winning team, which is also fine; some people need that kind of distraction in their life, or something to look forward to that goes right for once. Whatever reason for choosing a team, it's still their right. Sure, sometimes it's plastic, and it's hard to rationalize their motives, but it typically isn't - especially after someone devotes time into learning about the club they now support.  So yeah...Not every supporter is plastic."

That really is the biggest draw for me to a euro team."

I know that this isn't a fair characterization of the majority of EPL fans, but it's turned me off from following European leagues entirely.   I'd advise doing what others have suggested: go to a pro game - Chicago is only a couple hours form Milwaukee, right? - and maybe catch a USMNT game at a bar. These crowds are generally far more inclusive. Some of the American Outlaws watch parties in bars can be a whole lot of fun.

MLS,3e33r1,Kevo_CS,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:41 2015 UTC,"If MLS wants to be seen as a serious league we need to be holding out for serious transfer fees for players like Castillo. Greece isn't a substantial step up, we need to be selling directly to the big leagues and $5-10 million isn't that crazy for a player with his quality."
MLS,3e33r1,BryanW94,4,Tue Jul 21 18:59:39 2015 UTC,Although Idon't blame them for trying before he gets noticed even more. Pretty smart by Olympiacos actually.
MLS,3e33r1,joylongdivision,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"Greece isn't a substantial step up   Maybe not, but Olympiacos is a consistent Champions and Europa League team. That can sway a player even if the domestic league isn't great."
MLS,3e33r1,Kevo_CS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that's not what I'm saying. Obviously the Champions League is a good place to be if you want to get noticed by the biggest clubs in Europe, but MLS needs to be a league that's so well respected that this visibility isn't a huge advantage. You can't get there if you're consistently selling your league's most talented youngsters for a few mil."
MLS,3e33r1,Major_Winkee,4,Tue Jul 21 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"That would make him the highest paid transfer fee for an MLS departing player. Jozy was the highest, his price tag was around $10 million from NYRB to Villareal. Maurice Edu was second and got around $6 million from Toronto to Rangers. Although I hope MLS gets more than $10 million for Castillo, my gut feeling is he is worth just shy of that number, $7.5-$8.0 million."
MLS,3e33r1,Major_Winkee,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:40 2015 UTC,In my opinion he's worth the highest MLS fee of all time. He's not even in his prime yet and tearing up the league. His value to FCD is incredible. I'd bet the Hunt boys won't let him go for less than a record fee.
MLS,3e33r1,mjconns,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:19 2015 UTC,I will agree with you if FCD wins the MLS Cup and Castillo has an amazing run through the playoffs.  Edit: words

Haha... joking aside, I meant ""we"" as in /r/mls I honestly only became a fan like halfway through the 2013 season, so I don't know what Dallas did with the money. Maybe invested it in their academy I'm always hearing so much about? I do like /u/sawillis suggestion that they invest it into a USL team. They already have fantastic academy, imagine how many more prospects they could churn out with a dedicated USL team to send those kids to."

MLS,3e33r1,FHlogin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:18 2015 UTC,It would probably be the smartest use of that money.  Look at what LA is starting to put together within two years of starting theirs.  I really like Barrios and think he could be Castillo part 2.  Could be a good deal for you guys.

Expand the footprint to allow more of these players in the system at one time.

MLS,3e2sij,Kevo_CS,12,Tue Jul 21 20:09:52 2015 UTC,"I think there's still room for teams to try to do a little of both, which I would call the SKC model.   I do love what Dallas has done with its academy; my main concern with the Hunts is not that they've settled on a model that encourages lower costs on salary and more investment in the 'infrastructure' - academy, coaching, etc., because what they're doing is interesting, effective, and could have huge implications for the national team going forward - it's moreso that they seem to want the rest of the league to also spend as little as they do on the salary-side and are always going to be a team that tries to keep the salary cap lower than it reasonably should be."
MLS,3e2sij,SalvadorsDeli,7,Tue Jul 21 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The great teams do both.  While I'd wouldn't disagree with the assumption that's how the Hunts feel, do we have any hard evidence to support it? I'd be interested to see the breakdown on how the owners feel about league growth/spending. Who here wants to sneak into those board meetings?"
MLS,3e2sij,SalvadorsDeli,5,Tue Jul 21 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"It's certainly anecdotal evidence at best, but during the CBA negotiations there were a lot of whispers that Clark Hunt was one of the leading 'hardliners' pushing against making concessions to the players.   Those who were providing snippets of the CBA negotiations were portraying it as a lot of the newer owners being more open to player movement and raising the salary cap, whereas the Hunts and Krafts of the league feel very strongly that the reason their families invested in this league to begin with [and helped save it during the dark ages] is because the league has always prioritized cost-controlling measures."
MLS,3e2sij,stealth_sloth,2,Tue Jul 21 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"If, for example, Colorado tried to copy Dallas, they would end up simply a poor man's Dallas. Dallas is a bigger market and much bigger youth soccer hotspot.  Kansas City is probably a better example of what smaller market teams need to be emulating, but most accurate of all would be to say every team needs to figure out how to work with their specific area."
MLS,3e2sij,sawillis,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"There is some scouting happening too.  Alex Zendejas is from El Paso for instance, so it would be up to Colorado to start scouting the area to get in their academy."
MLS,3e2sij,stealth_sloth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the big edge Colorado has is that they can add more out-of-area players to their academy than Dallas (I forget the exact numbers). And they could probably leverage that well if the money was there for it.   But Colorado specifically has half as many youth soccer players as North Texas - so even with scouting, the Rapids just have a shallower pool to work with."
MLS,3e2sij,sawillis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:50 2015 UTC,MLS needs to remove limits of out of area and encourage scouting and recruiting to academies.

I applaud them for bringing big names to the american game but they should put stories like this to the front. This is what is gonna make MLS gain respect in the international community, the fact that homegrown players are having a great impact on a ""small market"" team. If these players go to European leagues like Yedlin, it's a great thing to think that the players were brought up thru a development program from an MLS club. The big names are obviously there to bring money to there respected clubs but having homegrown players on the MLS all star game & say they beat Tottenham, would be great bragging rights. Plus bring a positive light to this little futbol league called MLS & compete with the bigger leagues for big names in there prime not when they're looking for a great city to retire in.

MLS,3e3bzb,jkure2,8,Tue Jul 21 17:33:25 2015 UTC,"Interested in why you think it's weak in the long run?   Short term it seems solid. Fanbase has been asking for a big name. Not many available at an affordable price. He would bring people to the stadium, raise the quality of our core strikers, give our midfiled (one of the best at creating chances in the league) someone who can put balls away, and hopefully attract more stars by putting Chicago back on the map.   Long run it makes a lot of sense, short term is makes sense. Pair this with a solid CB signing (Packwood maybe?) And the squad is nicely filled out."
MLS,3e3bzb,Jingr,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"I think it might be weak in the long run because the league is notoriously tough on new players, and I don't think this instantly turns us into a contender, and by the time we are, he will be gone and we will have essentially thrown all that money into a pit.   On the other hand, he might light it up like Magee did when he came here, lead us to MLS cup and take a sweet mvp award. Who can say? I think we have much more obvious problems than needing another attacking player, especially a 38 year old one, but I do acknowledge this could turn out great.   Historically, though, by the time he settles in its time to move on already, so why drop the cash on him in the first place?"
MLS,3e3bzb,jkure2,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:53 2015 UTC,"I think there's also a chance that bringing in Drogba could bring a lift to the locker room. Guys who haven't quite put it together yet this season but aren't bad players (Maloney?) might be getting close to mentally throwing in the towel on the season.  Bringing in a guy like Drogba, whose expectations you'll want to meet and play up to, could give the second wind to some guys for this season. Or at least a sense that the FO is trying to build something to win, and that even if this season isn't going great they should work on gelling as a team and getting it together to compete for next season"

That's an interesting point I hadn't considered.

MLS,3e3bzb,Jingr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:32 2015 UTC,I have no issue with it since it has made acquiring players easier than the allocation stuff.  I would not want a system where Chicago and Montreal are bidding themselves even higher for a player they are likely already over paying for.
MLS,3e3bzb,sawillis,4,Tue Jul 21 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"But at the end of the day if a player only wants to sign for one club, it's counter productive."
MLS,3e3bzb,arseniq33,4,Tue Jul 21 17:30:13 2015 UTC,"Not really, 50k in Garber Bucks fixes that.  Remember people on these boards flip out because players only want to go certain places.  This is a mechanism on the books that helps the other clubs.  I have no issue with it.  In the end it will get worked out.  Although with Jack Mac being in Montreal I would personally prefer him in Chicago."
MLS,3e3bzb,Menessy27,3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"Chicago already have 2 DP Forwards.  We have a bunch of young and injured players. Yes, a world class defensive midfielder would be better for us, but Drogba would completely change the Impact."
MLS,3e3bzb,BL4ZE_,6,Tue Jul 21 17:36:39 2015 UTC,We have one DP CF and he has scored a massive 2 goals this season.
MLS,3e3bzb,johanspot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:35 2015 UTC,I wasn't clear....I really like Jack Mac
MLS,3e3bzb,sawillis,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"And by the looks of it, he really likes Atlanta and AUFC too."
MLS,3e3bzb,johanspot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:07 2015 UTC,Is it? look at someone like Piatti for example. As soon as he joined MTL he talked about how he would like to move to NY in the future. You think if MTL didn't have his discovery rights that he would be in MTL and not NY or playing in Argentina waiting for an offer from NY? Did you also have a problem with the rule when you signed him? of course not.
MLS,3e3bzb,sawillis,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:35 2015 UTC,Did NY want him? if they did and he preferred NY over MTL than yes I still have a problem with the rule.
MLS,3e3bzb,johanspot,0,Tue Jul 21 18:40:48 2015 UTC,Drogba would prefer to play in Montreal. Chicago shouldn't get to veto that just because they called dibs.
MLS,3e3bzb,sawillis,7,Tue Jul 21 17:32:18 2015 UTC,Do you honestly think that if he really only wants to play in Montreal that won't happen?
MLS,3e3bzb,johanspot,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:03 2015 UTC,I think the league should make it easier for Montreal to bring in players like this rather than adding ridiculous red tape.
MLS,3e3bzb,sawillis,4,Tue Jul 21 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"They did make it easier.  This isn't even really red tape, Chicago put him on their list and gets to make an offer first and it sounds like they are going for it.  No matter where he ends up, the team is going to over pay for him, this keeps that to a minimum."
MLS,3e3bzb,DABOSSROSS9,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:29 2015 UTC,They did make it easier.    How on earth does Chicago having his rights make it easier for Montreal to sign him?
MLS,3e3bzb,Mr_Tomfoolery,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:25 2015 UTC,"Because they don't have his rights.  The have the right of first refusal to negotiate, which can be easily switched between teams.  Being on a discovery list, does not equal player rights."
MLS,3e3bzb,johanspot,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"Being on a discovery list, does not equal player rights.   As I understand it that being on a discovery list and then making a qualifying offer does equal having the player's rights when it comes to MLS."
MLS,3e3bzb,DABOSSROSS9,4,Tue Jul 21 17:42:13 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, it is essentially a right of first refusal.  If Drogba wants Montreal he will be in Montreal."
MLS,3e3bzb,johanspot,0,Tue Jul 21 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this the other day. I think the league should negotiate on behalf of all the teams. So Both Montreal and Chicago say they will bid up to X-Million dollars. Chelsea agrees to the amount, then chicago and montreal can put in competing offers for Drogba services."
MLS,3e3ves,meeerod,12,Tue Jul 21 19:25:01 2015 UTC,"My best translation from Portuguese and Google translate:   OCSC filed a lawsuit last Monday seeking payment of debt owed by SPFC, debt stems from loan of Kaka to SPFC OCSC is seeking an agreement with SPFC that would transfer Ganso to OCSC in exchange for forgiving the multimillion dollar debt plus $6 million USD.  OCSC will possibly file another lawsuit seeking damages from canceled friendly between OCSC and SPFC where OCSC would receive 80% of income from said friendly.

MLS,3e3q7n,AAAristarchus,7,Tue Jul 21 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"A series of unfortunate events. I believe the story goes:    US Soccer told RBNY that if they made it to this round in the Open Cup their match would be rescheduled to allow them to play in a summer friendly against Chelsea. RBNY did make it this far, so USSF tried to reschedule their match to allow them time to play their friendly, which is tomorrow. Only thing was, they tried to reschedule to the day after the Union's friendly against Bournemouth.  And any sane person would admit you can't reschedule a match to allow one team to play their friendly while directly impacting the opposing team's friendly. So even though USSF promised NYRB they could reschedule, because of the Union's friendly the game could not be rescheduled. However, believing the game would be rescheduled, Red Bull Arena was booked in advance for PSG-Florentina later tonight. Union offered to host the game at PPL Park at a more regular hour, as they should. And Red Bull declined the offer, not wanting to give up any advantage on the field, as they should. So now we have a late round US Open Cup game at 4pm on a Tuesday that I don't think many people can attend. Don't Profit?"

MLS,3e3c2r,TheBarberOfFleetSt,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:22 2015 UTC,Just like when Wondo broke the all time record with 85% of his goals being PKs. Not impressed by keane either.

Perhaps it implies he holds zero Class A shares, otherwise that also could have been stated.    I would like to know what the new minority owns that joined on the past year or two own.  I'm going to assume also Class B.  And would that imply that Sak had to sell a few of his shares and therefore owned a larger stake prior?

MLS,3e2yxn,jmoney0999,7,Tue Jul 21 15:42:15 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that thinks that the Columbus PK shouldn't have happened? I mean Johnson shouldn't have tripped him but that ball was going out of bounds because of the poor first touch.
MLS,3e2yxn,KansasBurri,7,Tue Jul 21 17:22:49 2015 UTC,I thought about that too - there's no way Finlay has a play on the ball. But if you have the same contact with two field players in the center of the pitch it's a foul. So IMO it's a foul here.
MLS,3e2yxn,duganda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"I think as the rules are written, it's technically a PK. Johnson clearly trips Finlay. However, it looks to me like there's no way for Finlay to have made a play on the ball after the first touch, so maybe we just need a clarification in the rulebook."
MLS,3e2yxn,mawbles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter where the ball is going; a foul is a foul is a foul. And since it was called inside the 18, it's a penalty. Clear and simple. Now if the foul denied a goal, it's a red. If it was a harsh foul, it's a yellow. It was neither. It was a common foul inside the penalty area."
MLS,3e2yxn,debotehzombie,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"True, i sometimes get confused since football has an 'uncatchable pass' that makes it so even if someone commits a penalty or interference on a receiver, it's not illegal if the ball was thrown too high or too far for anyone to make a play on it. Not in soccer though."
MLS,3e2yxn,WonderboyYYZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yep. Just kinda of try to think of it in a different context to football. If a defender commits holding on a WR on the left side, but the QB throws to the right side, is it still a penalty? Even though it didn't interfere in the forward play whatsoever, it would still be called (or at least it's supposed to be)."
MLS,3e2yxn,debotehzombie,13,Tue Jul 21 19:38:57 2015 UTC,According to Borg there would have been about 15 red cards. I don't think he has ever played sports before because when you jump your arms naturally come up. As long as you don't lead with your elbow and put force it shouldn't be a red. Most of those are yellows at most.
MLS,3e2yxn,Ahesterd,13,Tue Jul 21 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"Most of the ones he called out were leading with elbows, though.  People like to rag on Borg for supposed red card bloodthirstiness, but within the letter of the laws he's usually in the right on those calls - it only seems like there's so many because those calls aren't made, and thus players continue to be able to get away with reckless challenges and play."
MLS,3e2yxn,theomega000,7,Tue Jul 21 16:20:24 2015 UTC,At least from the replays it does appear there are more than a few incidents with people leading with their elbows. Only reason the players keep doing it is they go unpunished. Reds might be harsh for this but if it needs to change this is the way
MLS,3e2yxn,metameh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:19 2015 UTC,"MLS/PRO cracked down on that kind of behavior pretty hard a few seasons ago, and the players adapted. Hopefully this week was a statistical aberration because it would be a shame to see that kind of behavior come back."

MLS,3e2yxn,59snomeld,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:17 2015 UTC,"It looked like most of them were leading with elbows. The Tommy Thompson one was forearm and it looked like he was trying to use him arms to help him jump higher and win the ball. All the others to me looked like the elbow was out for ""defense"" to hit the other player"
MLS,3e2yxn,bergobergo,6,Tue Jul 21 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"From that video, it doesn't look like Will Johnson says anything more between getting the yellow and getting the red. Odd."

MLS,3e2yxn,ReallyHender,6,Tue Jul 21 16:31:56 2015 UTC,Johnson is shooting daggers with his eyes in the video.
MLS,3e2yxn,volunteeroranje,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:11 2015 UTC,"Looks like the moment he says something might be obscured by Octavio Rivero in that angle, unless he had already pulled the red card out at that point?"
MLS,3e2yxn,stedfunk,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:59 2015 UTC,looks like he says 'Cunt' just before/while he's covered in the shot by Octavio
MLS,3e2yxn,PARANOIDinREVERSE,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:23 2015 UTC,I think Will Johnson‚Äôs annoying face is worth a red card by it‚Äôs own merit.

MLS,3e2yxn,duganda,4,Tue Jul 21 17:31:38 2015 UTC,This is why Chara - who normally doesn't get angry - was going after Techera a minute later. Easy card IMO.
MLS,3e2yxn,Audicity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:38 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they didn't mention where the Rapids defender was shoving Barrett when the ball wasn't even in play.  The ref didn't do anything because he was dealing with Pineda who had just gotten hurt by that elbow in the 80th minute.

MLS,3dz2an,Mercy_X,10,Mon Jul 20 18:24:58 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that this was a quickly put together picture just to show the cover and they will take their time photoshoping the cover for when the game is released.

MLS,3dz2an,ryloc,173,Tue Jul 21 06:01:34 2015 UTC,"I for one would have voted for Lloyd. Morgan is an obvious attempt to get a more attractive person on the cover, considering, she barely played in the world cup and such."
MLS,3dz2an,j_andrew_h,47,Mon Jul 20 18:21:38 2015 UTC,I don't know if I would use the phrase barely played. She started the last three matches.
MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,17,Mon Jul 20 18:54:20 2015 UTC,I would assume that this has been in the works prior to Lloyd's record day.  I could be wrong obviously; but I doubt they just made this decision in the last couple of weeks.
MLS,3dz2an,j_andrew_h,13,Mon Jul 20 19:32:18 2015 UTC,I think the decision would have been the same either way. The are picking the cover that they think will sell more games.
MLS,3dz2an,SvanirePerish,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:42 2015 UTC,You're probably right; but it would have been a tougher choice if they were making the call this week verses a few months ago or whenever they did it.
MLS,3dz2an,Ampatent,92,Mon Jul 20 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"You gotta put the superstar on the cover,  like with last year's game they put Dempsey instead of Bradley, Howard, or somebody else."
MLS,3dz2an,mudsloth,65,Mon Jul 20 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Dempsey is just as important as Bradley or Howard, more important than Howard even, as we have players like Guzan."
MLS,3dz2an,Ampatent,92,Mon Jul 20 18:30:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Alex Morgan is one of the brightest young stars on the USWNT and even with her injury she still played very well despite failing to find the net more than once. Just going by Twitter followers, Alex has at least 2 million and Carli only has 413 thousand. It's a marketing move, first and foremost."
MLS,3dz2an,dj_bpayne,10,Mon Jul 20 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"Morgan isn't even the best player on the Thorns. Yes, it's a marketing move, but they really should promote players who've earned it with their skill and efforts."

MLS,3dz2an,mudsloth,6,Mon Jul 20 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"She's the most well known because she's smoking hot. I have nothing against her using that to up her star power and become a bona fide celebrity, but I wish we could be comfortable with promoting the best female player out there rather than the prettiest. If I ever have a daughter, I hope she looks up to the player that tries the hardest and does the most to help her team rather than the one who has the most swimsuit photo shoots to her name."
MLS,3dz2an,braveheart18,22,Mon Jul 20 21:02:19 2015 UTC,"She's one of the best female players in the world, and was a finalist for the world player of the year. It's not like they picked a bench player. If she wasn't fighting through injuries, she would have played even better during the world cup.   Wayne Rooney was on the cover for years and he wasn't nearly as good relative to the other men's players that could have been on there. Carli Lloyd had a great tourney but she's not indisputably the best women's player."
MLS,3dz2an,joshdts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"I've been watching Morgan play for the Thorns for 2 years and she's infuriating. I don't dispute that she's got some skill, but she's really never been more than a promising young talent. She never improved on the performances she was showing at the previous WC. I'd bench her on the Thorns for Allie Long or Christine Sinclaire (or Jody Taylor, this year) in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, they both get shifted to other positions so Morgan can play where she wants to."
MLS,3dz2an,mattjf22,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:57 2015 UTC,"I think you've being kinda harsh.

MLS,3dz2an,E51838,11,Tue Jul 21 13:22:28 2015 UTC,I'd say the superstar of this world cup was carli Lloyd. It's like the commissioner giving all star slots to Gerrard and lampard when they haven't even played a game instead of naming the top scorer in the league to the team. This is a similar situation.
MLS,3dz2an,j_andrew_h,37,Mon Jul 20 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"That's pretty specific which misses the point. Alex Morgan is a superstar of the USWNT. Her name carries a ton of weight. Sure, this was an underwhelming World Cup for her but that doesn't mean her brand is suddenly not there. Did Ronaldo's brand suffer from a poor showing at the Men's World Cup? No.  If you are looking to put a USWNT player on the cover of FIFA you put Alex Morgan on it because people will look at her and say ""Woah you can play as the US Women?"""
MLS,3dz2an,shippfaced,22,Mon Jul 20 19:12:08 2015 UTC,How is this a similar situation? She played over 400 minutes in the World Cup. She's not exactly a scrub.
MLS,3dz2an,ReallyHender,5,Mon Jul 20 18:44:12 2015 UTC,I doubt that they just made this choice in the past couple of weeks.  Lloyd may be the obviously choice now but who knows when this deal was made.
MLS,3dz2an,sounderdude,11,Mon Jul 20 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with a vote though. This decision was made well before the world cup, think how long they were programming this game for. Alex Morgan, prior to the world cup, is the obvious face of the women's team."

MLS,3dz2an,foggell44,10,Mon Jul 20 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"Would you really say that currently Abby Wambach is more popular than Alex Morgan? If I ask a casual soccer fan to name someone from the women's team, they'll name Wambach before Morgan?  Wambach is hugely accomplished and quite frankly I think Alex Morgan sucked during the world cup, but if you're marketing a game, Morgan is the obvious choice."
MLS,3dz2an,ReallyHender,7,Mon Jul 20 20:52:52 2015 UTC,"Would you really say that currently Abby Wambach is more popular than Alex Morgan? If I ask a casual soccer fan to name someone from the women's team, they'll name Wambach before Morgan?   Wambach's been part of the USWNT roster since the 2003 World Cup cycle and she has the most international goals of any player, men or women.  I don't know if she's more popular than Morgan, but she is unquestionably the face of the USWNT to me."
MLS,3dz2an,sounderdude,10,Mon Jul 20 21:09:52 2015 UTC,"If you're marketing for a video game, Morgan is far more popular."
MLS,3dz2an,ReallyHender,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:59 2015 UTC,She's the face of the past. Why in the world would EA put the face of someone who is now retired on the cover?  Their best bet is someone who has history and is young enough to still be important in 1 to 2 years.

MLS,3dz2an,sounderdude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:35 2015 UTC,Abby didn't play well this WC but I would have considered her the face of the team. Guess times are changing!
MLS,3dz2an,canti-,2,Mon Jul 20 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"She is definitely the most achieved for sure. And if you follow soccer you'll be very familiar with Wambach.  But if you follow soccer you're already buying FIFA 16. If you're just getting into it or you casually follow it, Morgan is more popular and is a bigger draw"
MLS,3dz2an,bergobergo,12,Mon Jul 20 21:32:59 2015 UTC,Ronaldinho used to grace the covers. I don't think they're worried about how attractive these people are.
MLS,3dz2an,ReallyHender,3,Mon Jul 20 20:06:44 2015 UTC,You're kidding yourself if you think em and women get the same treatment when picking who is cover worthy. Her looks are a huge part of it.
MLS,3dz2an,bergobergo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:12:44 2015 UTC,Would it be mean to point out that Abbie Wambach was probably a finalist for the cover as well?
MLS,3dz2an,Oddpac87,3,Tue Jul 21 14:45:53 2015 UTC,They probably made this decision months before the World Cup.
MLS,3dz2an,elitron,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"Your assuming they chose her after the World Cup. Lloyd was a super star, but Morgan has been much more of a star for the USWNT over the years."

MLS,3dz2an,DHGPizzaNinja,7,Mon Jul 20 19:33:47 2015 UTC,They're paying messi to be the cover star. He's gonna be there for a while

MLS,3dz2an,threeagainstfour,6,Mon Jul 20 21:44:33 2015 UTC,Because they want to sell as many games as they can.
MLS,3dz2an,norris528e,14,Mon Jul 20 19:36:57 2015 UTC,They could put Oscar the fucking Grouch on the front of the game. We're still gonna buy it.
MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,3,Mon Jul 20 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah the hardcore fans will, but they're not aiming for people who are already guaranteed to buy the game no matter what."

MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,2,Mon Jul 20 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"I believe some of the German players ( definitely Gotze) has a partnership with PES. Not only that, but Messi is the most well known and respected Footballer, and athlete in general."

MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,24,Mon Jul 20 19:13:25 2015 UTC,So do you really think they should have tried to give them meaningful ratings compared to the men?  Where every player in the women's game is 1*?
MLS,3dz2an,Oddpac87,37,Mon Jul 20 19:28:22 2015 UTC,I once won the Premiership with Torquay United  Its a video game
MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,11,Mon Jul 20 19:39:54 2015 UTC,So you think that they should have given them meaningful ratings compared to the men? Personally I'd greatly prefer that they have their own ratings where someone like Alex Morgan is rated in the 90's and the game plays accordingly. If they tried to do meaningful ratings then the worst men's player would be better than the best women's player and I just don't see the point.
MLS,3dz2an,Oddpac87,6,Mon Jul 20 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"Rating them on the same 100 scale doesn't mean they have to be compared to each other. The rating is based on how they compare to their peers. For example, say Alex Morgan and Zlatan had the same rating, all it would mean was that Morgan is as good compared to the women's player pool as Zlatan is compared to the men's player pool. No one in their right mind is really going to argue they're equal as players, so who cares? All keeping the women separate does is make that side of the game boring as it's only 12 teams."
MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,8,Mon Jul 20 20:06:20 2015 UTC,"No one in their right mind is really going to argue they're equal as players, so who cares?    Huh? Are you saying that you should be able to play the game with a women's team where Alex Morgan is as good as Zlatan when facing each other? I guess I like my soccer games to be a bit more based in reality than that."
MLS,3dz2an,Manhattan_Project,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to play a match that was based on reality, you wouldn't play in one that featured both Morgan and Ibra, would ya?"
MLS,3dz2an,Oddpac87,0,Tue Jul 21 04:21:06 2015 UTC,I mean... Some people enjoy paying psg against the faroe islands just to see the carnage.....
MLS,3dz2an,Manhattan_Project,2,Tue Jul 21 11:18:27 2015 UTC,"If the men and women are separate, I assume the best women's players are going to have ratings similar to the best men's players. My whole point is if they're going to have similar ratings why not just let them play against each other? Who cares? It's a video game. It's not like they're putting the women into the normal career mode or anything. I just don't see the big deal with making them playable with all the other teams in exhibition/online."
MLS,3dz2an,DHGPizzaNinja,8,Mon Jul 20 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"It's not like they're putting the women into the normal career mode or anything.   If you want them to be able to play against each other then why not put them into career mode the same way? I'd say the argument against putting them into career mode for me would be exactly the same as not having men's teams play against ""alternate reality"" women's teams where the women are just as good as the top men in the world."
MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"Happy medium? Clearly people don't agree on the issue, so why not find a middle ground?"
MLS,3dz2an,DHGPizzaNinja,9,Mon Jul 20 20:28:23 2015 UTC,i think the middle ground is that they give women equal ratings to the men and simply don't have the men and women play against each other.
MLS,3dz2an,HBK_ANGEL,6,Mon Jul 20 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"Because most people want as much realism in their sim games (soccer, racing, flying) as possible. But stepping into the outrage minefield of womens soccer vs mens soccer would be stupid for EA."
MLS,3dz2an,bayernownz1995,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:01 2015 UTC,I have trouble buying the realism argument when the most popular mode in the game is about building a team out of players you buy with gold coins.
MLS,3dz2an,johanspot,3,Mon Jul 20 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"Thats a mode. You still play the same game. Every time developers talk about a new sports game they talk about realism and how ""x"" new feature makes this years version more true to life because realism in the actual on-field gameplay is what people want.   One of the big reasons why FIFA was behind PES last decade was because they didn't model the ball as its own separate object. It looked and ""felt"" unrealistic."
MLS,3dz2an,PopeAlGore,4,Mon Jul 20 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"Because there would be a lot of people complaining that some random wnt player is out playing a world class player like griezmann, or Hazard."
MLS,3dz2an,WonderboyYYZ,0,Mon Jul 20 21:03:06 2015 UTC,And lots of people here complaining that the Japanese women's team would crush any MLS team.
MLS,3dz2an,TweetPoster,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:36 2015 UTC,"Lol what? If someone one the WNT can smash a goal in from that far, I'm pretty sure Steven Gerrard or Lampard could demolish the Japanese team."

MLS,3dz2an,DayToDayInFlipFlops,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:31 2015 UTC,Or they could have just made the ratings relative to their sport but still allowed them to play each other. . . it's not like the world would end if the ratings were inaccurate in the name of making the game more enjoyable and usable.
MLS,3dz2an,lbakusidel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:41 2015 UTC,Or they could have just made the ratings relative to their sport but still allowed them to play each other   I think it would be pretty pointless to have the women's team be from an alternate reality where Alex Morgan is the fastest person in all of soccer. And do you really think it would be fair that playing as a MLS team you would have no chance against the Japanese women's team?  They should set the ratings so the women's team is comparable with the Germany's women's team and not worry about whether they would be overpowered compared to Barcelona.
MLS,3dz2an,joeybriggs,30,Mon Jul 20 23:09:16 2015 UTC,This is just like the MLS all star game - its not about the players who are the most deserving of the cover. Rather it is about who is the most marketable players are and using their images to sell units.
MLS,3dz2an,StretchLongDong,23,Mon Jul 20 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"...is this a susprise to anyone? Or even perceived as unfair? I'm sure Lloyd and Morgan already knew and talked about this, it's just the nature of any line of work that relies on ratings and publicity."

MLS,3dz2an,FANGO,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"Also, Morgan is a better player. She wasn't great during the world cup but is a better player when she's not coming off an injury"
MLS,3dz2an,Mandurz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"I may be a tad bias, but I think she did pretty damn well in the Cup.

MLS,3dz2an,_shane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, saying ""she wasn't great"" was probably incorrect. She definitely played really well, just not as well as she is usually capable of"
MLS,3dz2an,EricM12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. I always think she's a necessary start because her presence opens up defenses for others on the pitch.

At best there will be a woman on the cover every 4 years. This year women's world cup ratings were through the roof so EA is capitalizing on that by putting a woman on the cover. Other years it just won't be the same draw even if the women's teams are still in the game."
MLS,3dz2an,EffYourCouch,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:54 2015 UTC,"We'll see how the sales numbers go for this edition. If the women are moving units, then they'll be front and center. And if Sepp is replaced by someone even a hair more progressive, then doubling the target market is a no-brainer."

MLS,3dz2an,Assumer,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, my point is Women's Soccer will be more marketable those years as well as WWC years, so it's probable it won't just be a once every four year ordeal for a woman to grace the cover."
MLS,3dz2an,EffYourCouch,0,Mon Jul 20 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"Further, are we talking about their WC performance, or overall performance?  Are we sticking with strikers, who are usually the ones who end up on the cover?  Because if so then Morgan surely deserves to be there.  Wambach would too of course.  Odd that you mentioned Lloyd and Johnston over her."
MLS,3dz2an,ReallyHender,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:34 2015 UTC,The player who will sell the most games is the most deserving.

MLS,3dz2an,Schobee3,6,Mon Jul 20 19:24:29 2015 UTC,I agree a USWNT player should be on the cover but not Morgan.
MLS,3dz2an,Forin_Policy,6,Mon Jul 20 18:30:40 2015 UTC,Let's say you were picking the cover 3 months ago; who would you have picked? We have no idea when they made the deal with Morgan or whatever they had to do; but it wasn't likely done in the past couple of weeks with Lloyd being a superstar suddenly (I know she's been one off the best players for a while; but a not hat trick in the WWC Final with a wondergoal superstar).
MLS,3dz2an,CidelFastro265,4,Mon Jul 20 19:37:48 2015 UTC,The sad fact is that Morgan is more marketable than Lloyd.
MLS,3dz2an,PARANOIDinREVERSE,8,Mon Jul 20 18:33:29 2015 UTC,"Why is it sad? It works the same for the men, think about how much less popular Mix ""not a DP"" Diskerud would be without dat flow."
MLS,3dz2an,DayToDayInFlipFlops,6,Mon Jul 20 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know why she's getting the cover I just don't necessarily agree with it."
MLS,3dz2an,zzwi,14,Mon Jul 20 18:34:06 2015 UTC,"Nor do I, but I think that we've come quite a ways to be able to quibble about which USWNTer should be the one represented on the cover of FIFA next to Messi."
MLS,3dz2an,Thatsafunny,14,Mon Jul 20 18:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's kind of neat that unlike other venues, the argument here isn't ""Eww, they put a woman on the cover,"" but ""Here's which woman should be on the cover instead."""
MLS,3dz2an,zzwi,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"In all fairness that marketability has a lot more to do with the skillset than people want to acknowledge. I love Carli and everything she has done for the team. She had an amazing tournament. But Morgan is 7 years younger, and has 52 goals (Carli has 69) with USWNT despite having less than half as many caps as Carli. Morgan is no scrub by any stretch."
MLS,3dz2an,calvinandsnobs,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:08 2015 UTC,"Alex Morgan has 52 goals in 91 appearances for the WNT, and she was the forth youngest player on the World Cup roster. If she recovers from her current injury and gets back into her old form, she will go down as one of the greatest players ever for the US. She more than deserves to be on the cover."

MLS,3e2y6g,cloew11,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:49 2015 UTC,"I asked myself the same question, but the article says that he will have to end his time with Manchester(one year) before he goes to Seattle."

MLS,3e2y6g,Ragnar_Targaryen,0,Tue Jul 21 17:27:12 2015 UTC,I have an idea.   Portland trades you Anthony Manning (he's a young stud) for Dempsey and Oba.   That way you'll definitely have a quick fix :)  I'm not embellishing or anything
MLS,3e2y6g,timberrich,5,Tue Jul 21 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"But even if they signed Valdes and sold Frei, they would (speculation) still be in the red overall right?  I mean there is no way Frei would be making more then what they would sign Valdes for"

Maybe we're talking with Valdes in a ""keep all your options open just in case"" manner, but it's hard to see how we could be seriously in the goalkeeper market right now."
MLS,3e2y6g,metameh,4,Tue Jul 21 16:35:49 2015 UTC,The only way this makes sense is if Garth Lagerwey and Nick Sakiewicz got into a freaky friday situation.
MLS,3e2y6g,SonOfMechaMummy,7,Tue Jul 21 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha, no. We have a very good GK at the MLS level at a great value, and Garth Lagerwey has basically said that we're looking at a couple players who are ""goal-dangerous."" We're not spending big money on a keeper. This is just clickbait with the minor, minor added credibility that comes from Man U being in Seattle last week."
MLS,3e2y6g,jamesey10,10,Tue Jul 21 16:40:52 2015 UTC,The most unwise use of a DP spot is GK
MLS,3e2y6g,atatme77,8,Tue Jul 21 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"As I've said before (mostly when people claimed an outside back would be a waste of a dp spot) any position on the field is an impact position if you get someone good enough there. Imo it's more about filling holes in the roster with the quality you need than it is about certain spots ""not being worth the money"". Now the question is, is gk the most at need position for Seattle? I'm not sure about that  EDIT: before I would have said "" absolutely"" but frei has been playing very well for the sounders. A Seattle fan could tell you more but it seems to me that s defender to sit next to Marshall would be a better investment"
MLS,3e2y6g,metameh,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:10 2015 UTC,I think a DP outside back makes sense if the player in question qualifies as a Young DP and you're confident in your ability to sell him for a profit.
MLS,3e2y6g,johanspot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:57 2015 UTC,Based on what measure?
MLS,3e2y6g,jamesey10,5,Tue Jul 21 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"If you put a shit defense in front of a great goalkeeper, the gk is still going to get scored on.   The hardest thing to do in soccer is score goals. If you're going to spend DP money, you want someone who creates goals."
MLS,3e2y6g,johanspot,4,Tue Jul 21 16:12:45 2015 UTC,Goals conceded count just as much as goals scored. I honestly think that for many teams a top keeper would likely save more goals than an attacker at the same price would.  If you want to say that fans don't show up to see the keeper then I can get on board with that... But on the field alone I think the keeper very well may be better value  I doubt think Seattle is a good option to have a DP keeper but other teams I could see it.
MLS,3e2y6g,JoeTerp,0,Tue Jul 21 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"the difference is in WAR. Yes, some defenders are better than others, same with keepers, but you can see huge gaps between a top striker and an average or below average one. Its like Quarterback, they can't throw a touchdown to themselves, but an average team with a great QB will be just as good as a great team with an average QB."
MLS,3e2y6g,johanspot,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:51 2015 UTC,the difference is in WAR   Has someone published WAR stats for soccer? I'd love to see the comparison to top keepers vs top strikers. Do you have a link?
MLS,3e2y6g,CazzieBuilt,5,Tue Jul 21 16:59:23 2015 UTC,Common sense
MLS,3e2y6g,johanspot,7,Tue Jul 21 16:11:37 2015 UTC,Common sense is very often wrong when it comes to signing players.

Both were poor signings...though, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing some and, even if I‚Äôm not, it wouldn‚Äôt be very smart to base an opinion on DP keepers on such a small sample size....."
MLS,3e2y6g,johanspot,4,Tue Jul 21 16:36:54 2015 UTC,I'll just use a player like Brad Guzan who was rumored to be available cheaply a couple days ago. I think that for a team like the Columbus Crew with a poor defense they very well may get more value out of a player like Guzan than they would out of an attacker for the same money. No doubt Guzan would still give up goals but I think he would give up significantly less and adding another attacker would not increase their offense nearly as much.
MLS,3e2y6g,PARANOIDinREVERSE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"That‚Äôs not a bad idea...though I feel like, almost more than any other position on the field, a keeper would really suffer from being brought in half way through he season.  Their communication and chemistry with the back line is so important, it seems as though it would throw the defense into a bit of a mess for a good while."
MLS,3e2y6g,johanspot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:01 2015 UTC,Their defense has already been a bit of a mess for a good while.   But I know what you are saying... I just think if you have a player that can help you add them when you can. MLS rules just force that.

MLS,3e2y6g,Dean_Moriarty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"Because it is a salary cap league. You want to maximize what you get out of each dollar and each DP spot.   It is much easier to get a quality keeper for cheap than it is to get a quality attacker for cheap.    That's not to say that a DP keeper can't make your team better, but it just makes more sense in this league to spend that money on a field player, especially an attacker.  Average keeper and DP striker > DP keeper and average striker"

MLS,3e0er3,Wheaties466,8,Tue Jul 21 14:34:19 2015 UTC,isn't it MLS that they owe? or are DP loans different?
MLS,3e0er3,massivescoop,17,Tue Jul 21 00:47:12 2015 UTC,"fair question, but I gotta assume since We're fronting all but 450k or so of the 7million he gets that that money (or majority of it) is owed to the team."

MLS,3e0er3,massivescoop,8,Tue Jul 21 01:04:38 2015 UTC,MLS only pays up to $436K (the maximum salary for non-DPs this year). The rest of a DP's salary is paid for by the individual team.

MLS,3e0er3,TweetPoster,4,Tue Jul 21 00:13:27 2015 UTC,Quick (and quite possibly stupid) question ... why does SP owe money to Orlando for Kaka?
MLS,3e0er3,AndronicusYYZ,6,Tue Jul 21 06:35:20 2015 UTC,"According to this article: http://90minutesstrong.com/2015/07/orlando-city-plays-hardball-sues-sao-paulo/   In a turn of events, Orlando City has sued Brazilian-side S√£o Paulo for failure to comply to the terms of their loan agreement with Kak√°.  The MLS club has filled a motion in Brazil asking S√£o Paulo to pay them a sum of roughly $4,378,974.32 for numerous broken clauses in their agreement.  However, Orlando City has notified S√£o Paulo they are willing to forgive the debt if they give the North American club the rights to Ganso.  When Orlando City loaned out their MLS All-Star to S√£o Paulo, some of the agreements between the clubs included:  S√£o Paulo would pay Kak√° a total of $1.3M in salary.  S√£o Paulo and Orlando city would play two friendlies, one in Brazil and one in the United States. The friendlies were suppose to be part of his departure from Brazil and his arrival in the United States. The friendlies were suppose to take place in January of 2015 (when Kak√° left S√£o Paulo), and Fevruary of 2015 (when Kak√° arrived in the United States).  S√£o Paulo was to pay Orlando City the profit difference from Kak√° debut at Morumbi compared to their previous matches without him.  Orlando City was to receive 20% of S√£o Paulo‚Äôs earnings from Kak√°.  Also, S√£o Paulo was suppose to send Orlando city documents showing their profit earnings from before Kak√°‚Äôs debut, and had until June of 2014 to do so, yet failed to comply.  Orlando City looks to be playing hardball to get what they want, Ganso. It‚Äôs no coincidence the amount of money the club is asking for is roughly what Ganso‚Äôs transfer fee is worth. More on this developing story as it becomes available."
MLS,3e0er3,daguru9,2,Tue Jul 21 12:23:03 2015 UTC,that's a lot of clause. i'm surprised Sao Paulo agreed to this. (especially the profit difference and 20% of earning)
MLS,3e0er3,feb914,4,Tue Jul 21 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"Well, when its obvious they had no plans on repaying it, I'm not surprised at all they agreed to it."
MLS,3e0er3,Shuttrking,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:03 2015 UTC,Fascinating to see the sorts of clauses included in these loans.
MLS,3e0er3,capnheim,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"not that any of us know specifics, but it was part of the deal for loaning Kaka to them.  We signed Kaka around this time last year, and then he went to SP on loan until the end of their season.  My understanding is they owe us part of his salary and partial revenue from two of the matches he was in.  It was all part of the deal and nothing weird from what I can tell."
MLS,3e0er3,spikebaylor,3,Tue Jul 21 11:06:43 2015 UTC,that's a lot of money owed to a club that has salary cap of <3.5M. that loan fee can be used to bring in another DP (and apparently so)
MLS,3e0er3,feb914,6,Tue Jul 21 13:00:30 2015 UTC,Pay the $4M or give us Ganso for free?  This feels like blackmail.

MLS,3e0er3,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:43 2015 UTC,yeah but his value is around ~10mil so I could see the hesitation.

MLS,3e0er3,OCinNYC,3,Tue Jul 21 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, then they could sell him for $10M & then pay Orlando City the debt they owe. Either way is good for us really, though we really need a player if he is a good fit."

In fact I was considering doing a post in the OC sub about I really hope we get him and if we do should consider trying out the christmas tree. But now that we got rid of Amobi for this other guy, I'm not sure if we have a true holding midfielder to do it, but grabbing Ashe definitely gives us the speed on both sides."
MLS,3e0er3,OCinNYC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:27 2015 UTC,We used a 4-3-2-1 in Montreal early in the season when we had a lot of players missing (or what we thought then was a lot of players missing).  Okugo did play that holding mid role with Ceren and Higuita out wider and slightly more forward.  It worked well enough for that game and I think we might have used it also in Portland to help battle their midfield (Nagbe really); but I'm not 100% about that one.    I would be interested in how you would make it work with the defensive mids we have now and also the attaking mids & forward too... I can't think of who I would play up top.
MLS,3e0er3,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"yeah you are definitely correct about those games with one small caveat, I believe we were actually played a 4-5-1 and not 4-3-2-1. They are small differences but 4-3-2-1 is narrower as 4-5-1 uses wingers/wide midfielders where in the christmas tree our fullbacks are doing it all."
MLS,3e0er3,OCinNYC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:23 2015 UTC,Cool insight.  So in the christmas tree; what characteristics are you looking for in your forward?  Holding the ball up (back to goal type) or someone making runs into open space?

So this formation worked brilliantly with AC Milan(and yes Kaka being the playmaker) as they went on to win UEFA and club world cup with it, but they had Inzaghi as their striker also. Now I'm not saying the little pea is the same level as Inzaghi, but he is definitely Mexico's best version of him. Super fast, excellent reactions, opportunistic poacher who will bury the ball when given the chance, no need for super technical ball skills as your 2 AM's are doing that part for you. So really, chica, and I think Rivas could fill this role pretty well. Outside of that, I think Larin and Ribeiro also work as their hold up skills seem good enough to give extra time to let Kaka and Ganso(he is slow) time to get into final position. But really the quick poacher forward who is pressing the shit out of the back line is the ideal with 2 playmakers who can give him the final ball or make moves and feed the corner flag for an oncoming fullback to put it in the box for us. So if its a Ribeiro/Larin, the ball goes to the corner and we pound the box, Rivas/Rochez/Chicha(I still dream) and its going right down their throat. Edit: win*"

MLS,3e0er3,Widan,37,Tue Jul 21 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"Well if we're owed $4m we can't let it slide. We offered to pay $5m for Ganso and let the debt slide and they said no... So I see this as win-win. Either pony up and pay us what we agreed on or keep the money and we'll still pay them, just half price"
MLS,3e0er3,Widan,7,Tue Jul 21 00:20:42 2015 UTC,"True. It's easy to sympathize with Sao Paolo right now, though. No money and now they would have to give up a player they didn't want to. Benefits us, I guess."
MLS,3e0er3,spikebaylor,8,Tue Jul 21 00:25:43 2015 UTC,"from the earlier reports its not that they didn't want to give him up, its that they didn't want to give him up to us.  They wanted to shop him around in Europe."
MLS,3e0er3,Widan,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:13 2015 UTC,Ohhhhh. That makes more sense.   Do you think he'll get more exposure over here?
MLS,3e0er3,spikebaylor,5,Tue Jul 21 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know the player as well as I should.  Judging from comments and highlight videos he WAS a great player and I think that ability is still there.  Seems like he lost a lot of rep after being injured so while I think he'd probably get on a team, I doubt anyone in one of the big leagues is looking to pay big money for him.  Here in MLS I think he'd have the potential to be very big.  Having Kaka playing next to him couldn't hurt either."

MLS,3e0er3,jmoney0999,10,Tue Jul 21 03:20:33 2015 UTC,I don't see how anything is dirty. They couldn't take anything to court if it wasn't in the contract agreement with SP. 4 mill is far to great of a debt to just forgive. So we can either use it as a bargaining chip or get our money back. Nothing a normal person wouldn't do.   If you owed me 50 grand and you had a car I wanted that was worth 60 would it be dirty of me to say I'll forgive your debt and give you 10 grand for the car ?
MLS,3e0er3,OGbuc,3,Tue Jul 21 01:18:33 2015 UTC,How so?
MLS,3e0er3,sawillis,20,Tue Jul 21 00:19:45 2015 UTC,Honestly it seems like Orlando is giving Sao Paolo a way out.  They likely won't be able to afford to pay the money.  I hope Orlando gets Ganso...Would love to see him in MLS.
MLS,3e0er3,Widan,0,Tue Jul 21 00:22:27 2015 UTC,"I think Sao Paolo definitely needs to pay the money they owe for Kak√°, but this is pretty much only being done because they rejected the bid for Gonso, and according to the tweet, the lawsuit will be dropped if they give OC the player.   Something about it seems kinda dirty to me, but maybe that's just me."
MLS,3e0er3,OGbuc,18,Tue Jul 21 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as dirty.   Maybe OC is playing hardball, but no one forced SP to sign Kak√°, and we can't expect OC just to forgive that enormous debt either.  SP can either pay their debt or work something else out. Seems fair to me."

MLS,3e0er3,spikebaylor,6,Tue Jul 21 04:56:19 2015 UTC,"Ridiculous or not, a deal is a deal.  It's not like Orlando is just springing this on them.  If the number was too steep they shouldn't have made the deal."
MLS,3e0er3,SmartestDumbTeen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:10:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree that SP dug this hole themselves, but it seems more like a predatory loan than anything and SP was stupid enough to agree to it."
MLS,3e0er3,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:36 2015 UTC,This was at least promoted by SP as a big deal to have Kaka return to his boyhood club and they leveraged him in all of their marketing and online content.  I have no idea if that is worth $4M or not; but SP agreed to that deal and milked it as much as they could down there it seems.
MLS,3e0er3,SmartestDumbTeen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:34 2015 UTC,Were they also paying his wages or was it just his fee?
MLS,3e0er3,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"Here is what reports out of Brazil are saying where the terms of the Kaka loan:     S√£o Paulo would pay Kak√° a total of $1.3M in salary. S√£o Paulo and Orlando city would play two friendlies, one in Brazil and one in the United States. The friendlies were suppose to be part of his departure from Brazil and his arrival in the United States. The friendlies were suppose to take place in January of 2015 (when Kak√° left S√£o Paulo), and Fevruary of 2015 (when Kak√° arrived in the United States). S√£o Paulo was to pay Orlando City the profit difference from Kak√° debut at Morumbi compared to their previous matches without him. Orlando City was to receive 20% of S√£o Paulo‚Äôs earnings from Kak√°.    I'm not sure if they didn't pay him or not; but in an interview a couple of months ago when asked about MLS; Kaka compared it to Brazil and made a comment about players getting signed for millions but never getting paid.  He was saying a great advantage in MLS is that you actually get what you were promised.  I don't know if he was referring to the SP loan or just the general state of things down there; just something that I remembered."
MLS,3e0er3,SmartestDumbTeen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"Ok that makes a lot more sense than a flat fee of 4m. I would imagine litigation would be very difficult considering the country it is in and the influence clubs, I would think, have."
MLS,3e0er3,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:20 2015 UTC,True; but the owner of Orlando City is Brazilian so he knows the lay of the land down there and has full rights as a citizen.  He made his millions down there and I'm sure he's not scared of playing hardball with an influential club.

We've heard at least 2-3 ""big names"" this season that fizzled out. They've talked about a new CB for awhile, just didn't say his name.  I'd prefer the trade like yesterday. Don't say who you're targeting, just find a player you want, sign them, then tell us about it. Constantly dangling ""potential DP signing"" over hour heads every month or so grows old.

MLS,3e19p3,willOTW,2,Tue Jul 21 13:39:21 2015 UTC,What do they need? Defensive depth? Another forward?
MLS,3e19p3,southerngangster,5,Tue Jul 21 05:37:04 2015 UTC,"What's weird about this season is how damn well the Starting XI are doing, even though it's not our first choice.  To answer your Q, the areas of depth would be:   CB - Since Opara went down, and Anibaba is injured for a few weeks, It's only Besler, Ellis, and EPB (Palmer-Brown). It appears they addressed this with the Okugo signing. Or at least, I think they did. CDM - If Mustivar gets hurt, I'm not 100% sure who replaces him. Okugo again? Strikers/Wingers - Anor is currently injured, and has so far been underwhelming. For one game this team had to start Zusi as a False 9, and the attack was lackluster. This would be the main area I'd say we'd need depth in. Jacob Peterson is nice to have, but he's a Defensive-Minded Winger, which means going forward he's not that great."
MLS,3e19p3,Younger_Gods,3,Tue Jul 21 05:42:00 2015 UTC,"Also throw GK depth to that list.  While Kempin is the keeper of the future for this club, I'd be surprised if they think he's ready to be a full-time starter if Melia goes down.  Speaking of how well this second-choice starting XI is playing, holy crap did we luck out with Melia. That guy was an MLS pool keeper a year ago."
MLS,3e19p3,drgath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:07 2015 UTC,I know I've already said this in another thread but I wish they'd try out Hallisey more. Peterson has really been earning his spot lately though several chances and clean passes the past few games. I'm not sure if Hallisey is a game changer by any means but from what we saw he created several opportunities and IIRC an assist for Dom or Nemeth in his first game with more than 10 minutes of play.
MLS,3e19p3,ntrabue,3,Tue Jul 21 16:43:28 2015 UTC,Attacking depth would be nice. Maybe a backup for Benny.
MLS,3e19p3,hasfarr,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"CB-Addressed with Okugo. DM-Addressed with Okugo too. Better backup winger than Peterson/Anor, and maybe a backup to Dom but since N√©meth can be a winger instead of having our normal Peterson/Hallisey-N√©meth-Zusi when he can't play, we could have Better backup-N√©meth-Zusi because while Peterson is a workhorse, he isn't that great going forward."
MLS,3e19p3,KansasBurri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:35 2015 UTC,"Regarding your 1 and 2 - I think we could use another player for depth.  Hypothetically, if Mustivar is injured we could start Okugo there but then we are left with nobody behind the CBs on the depth chart.  I'm excited about EPB's potential but he really should not be getting significant minutes yet.  So, I would find some more depth at CB/DM and depth at an attacking position."

MLS,3dzif6,Goose511th,-7,Tue Jul 21 01:20:17 2015 UTC,"I really want to like Kaka, but every game I've seen him play he's been underwhelming. He always seems to be turning the ball over with either misplayed passes or getting the ball taken off of him. Most of his goals have come off penalties, although he has had a few flashes of brilliance. I'm not saying he's awful, but he's been playing more like an above average MLSer than the superstar I was hoping to see. Am I missing some aspect of his game that has made him so great?"
MLS,3dzif6,Somebody_Call911,6,Tue Jul 21 01:45:25 2015 UTC,"I think you are expecting to see Kaka at his best, when he is already way past that level. Also, its not like his team makes his job any easier either."
MLS,3dzif6,choss,12,Mon Jul 20 20:51:59 2015 UTC,The supporting cast around him on the attacking side has been blah at best.  He has the likes of Eric Avilla and Bryan Rochez making awful decisions to the point he tries to force everything.
MLS,3dzif6,pvdfan,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that that certainly is a factor that could really be holding him back. Even the best players in the league have been shown to struggle without help"
MLS,3dzif6,Somebody_Call911,5,Mon Jul 20 20:57:51 2015 UTC,It really is night and day for him when he has confidence in those around him.  Losing Molino and having to play Avilla killed his confidence.
MLS,3dzif6,pvdfan,4,Mon Jul 20 21:05:29 2015 UTC,Take a look at his advanced stats and get back to us. Goals and assists do not tell the whole story. OCSC would have maybe two wins without Kaka.
MLS,3dzif6,Trollsauce27,0,Mon Jul 20 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"I've watched a lot of OCSC games so I'm not just talking about the boxscore. He just seems to lose the ball a lot when I watch him, whether it's forcing tough passes or getting caught in possession"
MLS,3dzif6,Somebody_Call911,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:37 2015 UTC,"He gets closed down by 2 or even 3 guys as soon as he touches the ball. Which would be fine, except he doesn't have much quality around him especially when Larin is out."
MLS,3dzif6,Lauxman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:35:37 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that's a very good point. I never distinctly noticed that, but it's very possible that it was going on. I'll have to watch for that more carefully next time, but I stand by part of my statement about him trying to force some passes. That's not even that bad a thing, but I've noticed that when he tries to sprint out and lead the counter, he often ends up playing a through-ball in too narrow a gap, or losing it to a defender (however he doesn't always lose it, he sometimes threads the needle or beats his man)"

""If we can pull it off"" makes me really hope for the latter and really hope that it's against Liga MX.  Edit: I just realized a third possibility. They could be playing on an aircraft carrier.  Edit edit: Maybe it's MLS All Stars vs NASL All Stars.  Edit edit edit: Beach soccer anyone?"
MLS,3e0oc1,todayisthedayisignup,21,Tue Jul 21 01:45:16 2015 UTC,"I would love to see the MLS all stars Vs Liga MX all stars played twice a year. Once in the summer in the US and once in the Winter in Mexico. (This simply gives each team a chance to host a game every year during their opponent's off season and maximizes revenue dollars).  However, I don't know if we would could get / want the intensity to be as high as a US vs MEX WCQ, simply because it is a ""meaningless game"", and the moment someone tears an ACL and is out for a season, no one will ever want to play in the game again."
MLS,3e0oc1,PopeAlGore,34,Tue Jul 21 02:26:27 2015 UTC,"MLS AS vs Liga MX AS would be amazing. Imagine the ratings on UDN and FS1 for that.   Since that is a long shot, I'd settle for East v West. I'm well done with the current format."
MLS,3e0oc1,MrTuktoyaktuk,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:59:46 2015 UTC,East vs west I think would be absolutely pointless... The entire point is to get people to tune in and the ratings would be through the floor. If they were going to change the format I'd strongly prefer either MLS vs Liga MX or US vs the world.
MLS,3e0oc1,johanspot,14,Tue Jul 21 02:06:05 2015 UTC,Have you seen our signings recently? East vs West would entale quite the starting 11 with high list names.
MLS,3e0oc1,LabrielGopez,8,Tue Jul 21 03:18:21 2015 UTC,And the game would get terrible ratings because there is no active debate of how the West stacks up against the east. There is far more interest in how MLS stars stack up against an English team. Or how much the US players stack up against hte rest of the world. Or how much MLS stars stack up against Liga MX. East vs West would give the overwhelming majority of people no reason at all to watch.
MLS,3e0oc1,johanspot,6,Tue Jul 21 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"From a casual fans perspective I see your point. But advertised correctly it can pull in a good viewing. The interest really comes in from truly A-list teams like ManU, Bayern, Madrid, Chelsea, etc. Tottenham from my view doesn't seem like the highest caliber of European competition.   The other end of the stick is the fact that these teams coming from Europe don't exactly put out a A team. It's usually consisting of a few high caliber players and a bunch of fluff. Not exactly anything I'm hyped about nor really taking into consideration when comparing the cream of each others crop."
MLS,3e0oc1,LabrielGopez,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:26:18 2015 UTC,Tottenham from my view doesn't seem like the highest caliber of European competition.   I agree that Tottenham isn't as much of a draw. But I'd still be much more likely to watch them compared to East Vs West. I think it is interesting to see how MLS players would match up compared to someone like Lamela or Kane. And while Tottenham will not put out their strongest lineup they will still want to show well to increase their American fanbase.  I think the best argument against the current format is that it is giving free advertising to those European teams and at some point MLS will have to start to see the EPL as a direct competitor for fans living in the US. I just think at this point if MLS is going to have an allstar game they should focus on the format that will bring in the highest number of viewers.
MLS,3e0oc1,johanspot,6,Tue Jul 21 03:34:19 2015 UTC,Except Lamela or Kane couldnt give two shits about this pointless game so at no point will you ever see how they stack up against MLS players.  You are really delusional if you think these European teams pull viewers... it is a pointless friendly at a time when nobody in Europe is awake. You would probably get more viewers if every MLS team had multiple players in the game because you'd entice fans of all teams to watch. Right now you're basically ruling out viewership from half the markets in the league because they don't have any players in the game or just have a backup defender or something like that.
MLS,3e0oc1,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:09 2015 UTC,Why would you assume the players would give any more of a shit about east vs west than lamela and kane do about this allstar format?
MLS,3e0oc1,johanspot,3,Tue Jul 21 11:25:32 2015 UTC,Because at least they're playing people they have played against all season and that are within the same league and on the same level as them. Kane and Lamela are from an EPL team and most likely look down on MLS players. They may feel like they don't have to give 100%. Just my opinion.
MLS,3e0oc1,rasta_pasta_man,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:15 2015 UTC,at some point MLS will have to start to see the EPL as a direct competitor for fans living in the US.   Good point. Maybe once that line is crossed the East v West match up will become more probable.
MLS,3e0oc1,LabrielGopez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"If you start with the premise that the MLSASG is (in large part) to showcase the league to a larger (read: casual/international) audience, I don't think there is any way to dispute your point. I don't think we are quite to the point where the ASG could support West v. East, as far as ratings go (and can we even guarantee sellouts at the venue where it is held?).  With that in mind, I don't think MLS will be going away from the ""us vs. the world"" format until there are more stars in the league. I think such a point might be coming within five or so years, but we're not there yet."
MLS,3e0oc1,turneresq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:11 2015 UTC,"The game won't be East v. West until there are more than 11 players with name-recognition to casual fans.  The key is to get the most stars on the pitch and the most eyes on the game, and if you can't do it with only MLS players, bringing in a team like Tottenham fills the gap."
MLS,3e0oc1,bwadams12,3,Tue Jul 21 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe doing international MLS all- stars, vs. USA.  You have a pretty impressive group of foreign players to fill that team"

MLS,3e0oc1,Psirocking,4,Tue Jul 21 01:43:21 2015 UTC,"It's a tough balance between having pride in your own players, wanting them to get recognition for their good work, and get their all-star bonus payment vs. integrity of the important competitions (MLS & Open Cup since CCL isn't played mid-summer). I was happy not to see any RB players on the game roster, and only Sean Davis (not Miazga) in the Homegrown game. I hope we have 2-3 guys get bonuses though (Dax, Robles and Sam maybe?)."
MLS,3e0oc1,MSGuyute,3,Tue Jul 21 02:02:57 2015 UTC,I sure know I was proud of BWP after his rocket last year.
MLS,3e0oc1,Psirocking,2,Tue Jul 21 03:17:45 2015 UTC,"It's such a catch 22. Yes you want your team's best players on the league showcase, and BWP's goal last year was the epitome of what can come from that. But that was a sick goal that no one can expect to happen each year. I personally am very happy not to see any of our guys selected. If Marsh has gotten through to them at all, they know what is really important this season, and an All Star Game appearance isn't."

To me it's a pointless game that usually results in a player sitting out most or all of the previous and following game. If the Timbers were far and away at the top of the table, sure I would consider it, but as of now we can't afford to lose Valeri, Nagbe, Ridgy or any of our starting players for any games."

MLS,3e0oc1,Atlanta-Avenger,2,Tue Jul 21 05:00:59 2015 UTC,"Well, changing the format will make me far less likely to go. I have a feeling there are many people that feel the same way. I've been to an East vs. West all star game before. It was a blast, but it isn't special in the same way that the current format is. All star games are typically boring, the current MLS version rarely is"
MLS,3e0oc1,not_a_spoof_account,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:24 2015 UTC,The only thing I'd like more than the current format is MLS vs Liga MX All Star games.
MLS,3e0oc1,erockarmy1,5,Tue Jul 21 07:10:37 2015 UTC,"Please be East vs West. I strongly believe that it would help put our leagues talent on display. If we play the premier league all stars and get smacked by multiple goals then we look like a joke, if we win then people will claim it's their offseason. Plus if a viewer sees the league get crushed it would make them wanna watch the better league. The all star game should be to display the leagues talent and stars not to display league alternatives. It just seems like a stunt that has high risk and low reward to show other league stars. Please just go East vs West."
MLS,3e0oc1,TheChosenJuan99,4,Tue Jul 21 02:24:10 2015 UTC,MLS vs USWNT.

MLS,3e0oc1,johanspot,2,Tue Jul 21 07:09:17 2015 UTC,I know you are getting downvoted but mixing MLS allstars with the women's national team very well may get really great ratings.
MLS,3e0oc1,Webfooter17,4,Tue Jul 21 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"Hell, it might even get better ratings than MLS vs [English Team Here]. The USWNT is way more mainstream popular here than any Euro team."
MLS,3e0oc1,johanspot,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:17 2015 UTC,The only way that would happen is if there were restrictions on the male players to make them play as a ~u-15 team. Nobody wants to see a 20-0 stomp.
MLS,3e0oc1,Webfooter17,4,Tue Jul 21 07:30:32 2015 UTC,It wouldnt be the men vs women....  The teams would be split and men and women would play together

B) They'd find it a weird idea, watch and immediately turn the game off because the USWNT players would be getting burned non-stop."

MLS,3e0oc1,s1ark5,3,Tue Jul 21 03:38:42 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  As someone who hates the all-star game maybe I don't have the most nuanced opinion on the subject.
MLS,3e0oc1,einperson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:45:08 2015 UTC,I'm with you.... I dislike meaningless games in general. But if they are going to have a game that is a way to increase TV ratings I want them to go ahead and do what they can to maximize the value.
MLS,3e0oc1,Caelanl,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:58 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who likes the All-Star game format as is?  I think it's fun to see our best vs another pro team.  Yeah, it's the other team's off season and they probably don't give a shit about the game, but it's fun to see big world names vs our top guys.  That's all an All-Star game should be in my opinion, fun.  Just stupid fun, a break from the stress of the regular season, a chance to see the top players do some wacky stuff on the field.  This year, the people of Colorado get to go see Tottenham and the best players the MLS has to offer.  That's pretty sweet in my opinion.    I do see the value of East v West.  I like the idea of MLS vs Liga MX.  But I also see the value in the current format.  Last year's game against Bayern was insane!"
MLS,3e0oc1,ImGoingToForgetThis_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:29:02 2015 UTC,"exactly right, if they go back to east vs west, believe me no one would watch, and I wouldn't either, as big of a fan as I am.  East vs West is such an old school way of doing things.  When I think of east vs west I think about the other domestic leagues that are stuck with only playing teams within the us.  Thats the beauty of soccer and the beauty of MLS, IT IS the world sport.  We should seek to continue to set a new path forward in terms of sports in this country.  We have started to do that with the fan culture, and this all star game is/was another way.  I hope it doesn't change.  With that said,  I doubt MLS brain trust goes back to east vs west.  I think it is something else they are kicking around."

MLS,3dzs3q,j_andrew_h,7,Mon Jul 20 22:36:10 2015 UTC,I really think MLS supported teams could be a turning point in professional women's soccer here.  Lower operating costs due to shared resources and youth development.    I'd love to have a NWSL club here in Orlando!
MLS,3dzs3q,Pakaru,6,Tue Jul 21 04:07:32 2015 UTC,I think its interesting that we're basically where Don Garber wanted the women's game to be fifteen years ago.  After the 99 WC MLS bid for the right to run the women's league and lost. And the game is still playing catch up.

MLS,3dzqd7,burajin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:20 2015 UTC,First comment I heard when I walked in to meet up with a friend tonight.
MLS,3dzqd7,warl0ck08,38,Tue Jul 21 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"Now, I'm biased, but this trade is almost incomprehensibly good for SKC. They got someone who is just 24, can play both CD and DM at a really high level, AND they don't have to pay his whole salary? And they give up a guy who hasn't played significant minutes in months?  Dude."
MLS,3dzqd7,Flaam,2,Mon Jul 20 22:00:10 2015 UTC,Yeah... Hard to see a downside for us. Seems like a total steal.
MLS,3dzqd7,scorcherdarkly,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:53 2015 UTC,"No kidding. Carrasco is absolute ass and Okugo is pretty good. A shame to see KC get even stronger but that's a great bit of business for y'all, I'll acknowledge that."
MLS,3dzqd7,cmortis,5,Tue Jul 21 02:28:39 2015 UTC,"Let's be real for a second here; Okugo really isn't that good, or at least he hasn't been this season. He hasn't seen significant minutes from us this season either. He's only two years younger than Carrasco, which isn't that big of a jump, either. Him playing at a ""really high level"" is very subjective, because of what I've seen of him this season, he hasn't been.   The salary bonus is definitely great for SKC."
MLS,3dzqd7,Widan,30,Mon Jul 20 22:41:37 2015 UTC,"Okugo really isn't that good   Killed all credibility there.  He may not fit your system, but saying he isn't that good is just wrong.  Especially considering he could start for many teams at 2 different positions.    There is also a major difference in development potential between a 24 year old and a 26 year old (who turns 27 in a couple weeks, so really is closer to 3 years older)."
MLS,3dzqd7,xxtoejamfootballxx,4,Mon Jul 20 22:46:31 2015 UTC,He really hasn't been very good this year. All the best to him and hope he can regain form somewhere else.
MLS,3dzqd7,jtk7,8,Mon Jul 20 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"I can see where he's coming from. Of course he's young and I'm sure he has a bright future ahead of him. This year, though, there has not been a lot to hang your hat on. He's uncomfortable moving forward in attack...  Which our DMs have to do. And defensively, he has made some really, really big mistakes which have led to goals. It's not just that he's a terrible fit for our system... it's that even at the things he's supposed to be good at, he's not had the best go of it.  I wish him all the luck in SKC. I'm sure he'll fit in much better there and have the ability to provide a positive impact when he hits the field."
MLS,3dzqd7,dubron,5,Mon Jul 20 22:52:18 2015 UTC,He's uncomfortable moving forward in attack... Which our DMs have to do.   I believe Mustivar has a grand total of 0 shots this year. We will have no problem working with a guy who wants to play DM and never take a shot on goal.
MLS,3dzqd7,serious_black,3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"Don't think we ever needed or wanted him to take shots.  He just wasn't an offensive threat at all.. even when it comes to starting the attack out of the back.  Both ceren and higuita are very good at turning from defense to offense and getting the attack moving forward (even if the rest of the team can't seem to move forward).  Okugo looked good the first 5 or 6 games.  After that he started to drop off a bit.  Once he lost favor it just got worse.  We have a few guys who are net 0 on the field, but Okugo started to become a full on liability in the minutes he was given since then.  He looked better in our recent friendly and I'm sure he'll be good for SKC."
MLS,3dzqd7,spikebaylor,8,Tue Jul 21 02:40:29 2015 UTC,"Okugo fits best in a system with 2 CDMs, with the other playing more of a box-to-box role and he sits and destroys.  He has never been exceptional going forward.  His key attribute has always been his distribution.  I'm not saying he hasn't had an off year either, but saying that he ""really isn't that good"" is a crazy oversimplification.  He was a late-comer to an expansion side as well, so it's really tough to judge him with such a limited sample side.  I'm not saying OCSC will miss him (unless a CB or CDM gets hurt), but I'm saying that I strongly feel SKC got the better of this deal."
MLS,3dzqd7,xxtoejamfootballxx,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:41 2015 UTC,"but I'm saying that I strongly feel SKC got the better of this deal.   If we're just comparing player to player - then yeah, of course, they made out fantastic. However, the cap savings we'll get in the future because of the move is also worth value which may let us sign someone that was previously out of reach. So I think it's really a win-win.  Totally agree with your comments about what kind of role best fits Okugo. In our system, we expect both Darwin Ceren and Cristian Higuita to move forward in the attack and take shots, make runs, cover for each other. They touch the ball more than anyone else on the team every single game."
MLS,3dzqd7,dubron,2,Tue Jul 21 01:10:21 2015 UTC,"So I think it's really a win-win.   I agree with that as well, but I think you guys could have seriously gotten more.  Allocation money comes to mind."
MLS,3dzqd7,xxtoejamfootballxx,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"Finally, someone who agrees with me.   I've found that Orlando City fans are very defensive towards their players and staff. It's really hard to criticize our team without being met with down votes or angry fans."
MLS,3dzqd7,Widan,0,Mon Jul 20 22:58:05 2015 UTC,I agree.
MLS,3dzqd7,PersianImm0rtal,3,Tue Jul 21 03:59:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe he just doesn't fit into our team anymore, but I just didn't see anything beneficial from him when he was playing for us. He seemed lost a lot.  I'm happy for him for moving to another team where he will get more playing time, but I'm definitely not sad about losing him."
MLS,3dzqd7,Widan,5,Mon Jul 20 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"I understand Okugo has struggled this season, but he was a top-tier CB for a few years before he went to Orlando. And many during that time claimed his best position was DM. So, while his struggles this season are concerning, it's certainly not enough to dissuade me from thinking this is an utterly huge pickup for Sporting."
MLS,3dzqd7,Flaam,3,Mon Jul 20 23:22:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call him top-tier, rather ""better than most"" in a position that isn't his first choice. We fucked up his development by not playing him at CDM and not having him develop his passing more. Besides Blake, he's the one prospect I've been most excited for coming out of the Union. With SKC's great set-up, I believe he could take that next step and become one of the very best destroyers in the league"
MLS,3dzqd7,southerngangster,5,Tue Jul 21 01:12:35 2015 UTC,Okugo really isn't that good   YOU TAKE THAT BACK.
MLS,3dzqd7,midwesternhousewives,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"I think Vermes will develop Okugo well. He's done it for Besler, Dwyer, doing it with Mustivar, Ellis, SAS, Dia, the list goes on. I think he can do it for Okugo as well."
MLS,3dzqd7,KansasBurri,-11,Tue Jul 21 16:13:32 2015 UTC,You OCSC fans do realize the rest of us MLSers have been around for more than 1/2 a season and have seen quite a bit of Okugo?  Struggling for half a season at an expansion team that has had horrendous injury luck does not a bad player make.
MLS,3dzqd7,baviddoughie,15,Mon Jul 20 23:14:18 2015 UTC,"=/  I wish people would stop treating expansion team fans as if they are new to watching the sport, or MLS. We're allowed to have opinions based on what we've seen, and not get called out for it because we weren't there in 1996.  Obviously, half a season does not 'a bad player' make. And u/Widan actually never says he's a bad player. He just said he's ""not that good"" - and in our system, he has a point. Still a tremendous person. A class act. Very athletic and I'm sure he'll do much better in a different environment.  That still doesn't negate (some of our) observations of him in our system."
MLS,3dzqd7,dubron,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:20:44 2015 UTC,"the rest of us MLSers have been around for more than 1/2 a season and have seen quite a bit of Okugo   what are you saying? that the ""rest of you MLSers"" haven't managed to attract any new fans for more than 1/2 a season? i guess the entire league owes us a big ""thank you""-- all the new fans reported this year in one of the biggest popular growth periods in the history of MLS are apparently because of us.   oh wait, that's fucking ridiculous and you're just being condescending for no reason at all. there were MLS fans in Orlando before San Jose transplanted to Houston, and OCSC is a six year labor of love. we got fans that have been following this shit before even you (!!!), and with about ten times the better attitude.   Okugo's great but he hasn't been hitting it for our team. we need players to assimilate to our system fast, and we're paying Amobi way too much to sit on the bench and occasionally give up goals."
MLS,3dzqd7,babacristo,7,Tue Jul 21 00:48:01 2015 UTC,"Dude. You need to take it down about 8 or 9 notches. I understand where you're coming from, but your response is over the top."
MLS,3dzqd7,dubron,-9,Tue Jul 21 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"thanks man-- are you sure your notchometer is calibrated? i just doubled checked my notch history and according to mine i was only at 4 notches when i typed the above comment, so taking it down 8 or 9 more notches would be impossible."
MLS,3dzqd7,babacristo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"in fact, it's good for both of us-- and why shouldn't it be? we're friends and former affiliates, and you guys are taking care of Dom for us.   what i think a lot of people are missing here is, regardless of how you feel about Okugo's future, he has simply not been worth what we're paying him in our system. his versatility is really why we kept him in the first place and with summer transfer season, we're all hoping that Inchy has found a better alternative to using this $200,000 player to fill in holes (and without much success). frankly i think Carrasco will do a better job at being a backup and for a lot less money-- hopefully we also got some Garberbucks too and can use that to pay down our young DPs."

MLS,3dzqd7,Younger_Gods,2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:28 2015 UTC,That is pretty much Okugo for us.  Ceren has taken over his role and been fantastic at it.  Hopefully he can get more minutes in KC than he would get here.
MLS,3dzqd7,DemonSpeed,7,Mon Jul 20 23:30:41 2015 UTC,Never gotten the chance to shine and hasn't gotten much playing time to show what he can do. He is decent but much of his fame comes from his wife. That's not to say he is a bad player.
MLS,3dzqd7,MowwMoww,2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"Good enough backup DM with accurate long balls and switches. He looked damn near unstoppable when he subbed on for Houston in the MLS cup final, but it was too late for him to really have an impact."
MLS,3dzqd7,metameh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:11 2015 UTC,I wasn't a huge fan of him with his time in Houston. Then he slapped Brad Davis after he went to SKC. So he is not my biggest fan.

MLS,3dzqd7,Granto86,6,Mon Jul 20 21:39:26 2015 UTC,No.... We would have taken him back in a heart beat he was really becoming a huge part of our squad when we let him go...

MLS,3dzqd7,spqr-king,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:07 2015 UTC,Money and a second round pick in 2016.
MLS,3dzqd7,Ian_the_Goose,0,Mon Jul 20 22:45:31 2015 UTC,Not worth it in anyway considering what he was doing for us.
MLS,3dzqd7,spqr-king,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:47 2015 UTC,If Okugo was still on the Union life would be a million times better
MLS,3dzqd7,btd39,6,Tue Jul 21 00:54:35 2015 UTC,Was this a salary-induced move by OCSC? I imagine okugo is making a hell of a lot more than Carrasco. Anyone have money numbers?
MLS,3dzqd7,F0NNER,11,Mon Jul 20 22:08:43 2015 UTC,"Okugo is at $300,000 and I think Servando was around $80,000."
MLS,3dzqd7,pvdfan,3,Mon Jul 20 22:21:42 2015 UTC,And it looks like OCSC could be paying upwards of $200k of that.  If anything its a salary neutral move for this year.
MLS,3dzqd7,abloomquist,4,Mon Jul 20 22:52:59 2015 UTC,I really think this has next year in mind. We were paying that much for a guy riding bench. Just doesn't make sense for us. We bite the bullet this year and benefit from a lot  more cap space next year.
MLS,3dzqd7,jmoney0999,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:11 2015 UTC,I was hoping the Revs would acquire him and play him at CB. I think we could've offered a better midfielder than Carrasco.

MLS,3dyur3,Ragnar_Targaryen,47,Mon Jul 20 17:36:58 2015 UTC,"We've talked about this before:  An arms race is the best thing for MLS right now. Getting young, talented DPs to sign here is the best thing that has ever happened to the league (save maybe the implementation of the DP rule). First Giovinco, now Giovani... This is nothing but good for MLS."
MLS,3dyur3,cliffordbeshers,22,Mon Jul 20 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"I would add, this is working because the average talent level has improved to the point where these players can be successful rather than frustrated.  Put 3 good DPs on a team, and good players will learn even more.  It's a positive cycle."
MLS,3dyur3,melikeybacon,14,Mon Jul 20 19:43:23 2015 UTC,I hope this arms race continues so when Miami makes the league we land some monster players!
MLS,3dyur3,Ragnar_Targaryen,37,Mon Jul 20 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"No doubt the lack of state income tax, the weather, and the David Beckham brand will make Miami a major destination for DPs. They will have no problem attracting talent."

MLS,3dyur3,Nepalus,7,Mon Jul 20 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Gotta start somewhere. Owners are shrewd by nature. Everything they do is to maximize profits. Once they see teams like Toronto, Seattle and LA capitalizing on the added revenue, they'll come around.  Or at least, that is the hope. I'm not confident such will be the case for every club, but it should be the case for the vast majority."
MLS,3dyur3,Nepalus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:02 2015 UTC,I wonder if MLS would benefit from an NFL like structure where they share revenue.
MLS,3dyur3,Chralemar,4,Tue Jul 21 04:22:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. That won't compel the cheap owners to be less frugal, they'll just absorb the bigger profits and refuse to invest because their results don't matter.  The best course of action is for the cheap owners to see the owners willing to spend a little money bringing in bigger profits.  Do you really think spending $15m, even $20m on a player (between transfer and wages) isn't just drops in the bucket to a BILLIONAIRE owner? This ""we can't afford it"" bullshit is nonsense. They can all afford it.  Sports franchises aren't meant to be cash cows from year to year. The real value of a sports franchise is the resale value, the profits will never be that much higher than the overhead, or at least, they shouldn't be.  Donald Sterling paid $12.5m for the Clippers in 1981, then sold them for $2 billion last year. This ""I don't have the money"" garbage is just that... garbage."

Liga MX top dogs feature deeper sides, with better middle tier and bottom depth squad players, but in MLS' defense, their middle tier and bottom depth squad players are getting better as well."

MLS,3dyur3,EffYourCouch,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"But he could have sat on his contract at Villarreal and made the same amount as he's making here. Fully healthy (after the rash of injuries he suffered last year) there is good reason to believe he could rediscover the form he had two years ago, then get a bigger contract elsewhere.  Instead he came to MLS for basically the same money over the next 5 years."
MLS,3dyur3,EffYourCouch,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"Dos Santos reportedly fell out of favor with Marcelino due to his form as well so it's not as if he was set to be the first on the team sheet if he stayed.

MLS,3e0058,turneresq,16,Mon Jul 20 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"There was the recent targeted allocation update, which could allow Chicago to pay down Accam (or Igboananike) as a Core player and re-open their third DP slot."

If Garber forces them to accept minimal compensation (such as the 50k allocation), I hope we don't hear complaining from the Fire FO. Scampering back into the race after begging off is not a good look, and I don't think they should be rewarded for that kind of thing."
MLS,3e0058,turneresq,8,Mon Jul 20 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"I hope that   Montreal gets Drogba, he'd be great for local media/kids The Fire FO IS punished for this, to bring more heat down on Hauptman to sell.   I get that Drogba is still pretty good for his age, but I'm really tired of ""pretty good"" and budget buys. I want some all star defenders and an all star striker, and I want the FO to stop worrying about finding bargains.  Yes we are the 7th highest spending team, but we have shit to show for it.

MLS,3e0058,TheBored23,8,Mon Jul 20 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"Here's the MLS rule that appears to be relevant to this situation.    If a club wants to sign a player on the Discovery List of another team, it may offer the team $50,000 in Allocation Money in exchange for the right to sign the player.  The team with the player on its Discovery List will then either (i) have to accept the Allocation Money and give up the right to sign the player or (ii) make the player a genuine, objectively reasonable offer.   So, if MLS deems Chicago's offer to get Drogba to be ""objectively reasonable,"" there is nothing in the rule that would force them to give way. But I would think that Chicago would take Montreal's offer rather than get nothing in the hopes of Drogba changing his mind."
MLS,3e0058,tblazrdude,4,Mon Jul 20 22:40:54 2015 UTC,"genuine, objectively reasonable offer.   Curious what happens if Chicago makes a decent offer and Drogba says no. Is Montreal still in play, then, or is MLS completely OUT of play?"
MLS,3e0058,Kerithlan,6,Mon Jul 20 23:33:53 2015 UTC,"The way it's played out in the past, that player is essentially denied entrance to the league without Garber-ference."
MLS,3e0058,BL4ZE_,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:05 2015 UTC,"God I hate that rule. Makes the league look like fools abroad.   I think the 50K allocation is fair game, but if the player wants to play somewhere, let him..."
MLS,3e0058,TheBored23,2,Tue Jul 21 03:19:09 2015 UTC,"That's my confusion as well. There's nothing in the rulebook that would suggest Montreal could leapfrog Chicago there, but I think they could come to an agreement."
MLS,3e0058,LtDan61350,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"There is this part under the ""conflict resolution"" section:   If a club attempts to sign a player on its Discovery List and is unable to do so, the club retains the Right of First Refusal to acquire the player in the event he is later signed by the League.   The Fire have tired to sign him but he is apparently saying that he doesn't want to play in Chicago. Can we all agree that this would be considered being unable to sign a player?  Therefore, this would be like any other trade for a player's Right of First Refusal and the $50k does not apply."
MLS,3e0058,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:46 2015 UTC,MTL would have to offer quite a bit because Chicago actually wants him and apparently has made him a good offer
MLS,3e0058,TheBored23,5,Mon Jul 20 23:05:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but my understanding is that he does not want to play in Chicago."
MLS,3e0058,turneresq,2,Mon Jul 20 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"Should be interesting to see what happens. Will Chicago make him an offer he can't refuse? Will he refuse to play for Chicago under any circumstances. If so, and Chicago and Montreal can't agree to some compensation, and he goes elsewhere, what will Garber say? Will Garber force Chicago to take something less than they want?"
MLS,3e0058,ncquake24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"The way the rule is written, it seems that by making an offer to Drogba Chicago waives the right to compensation."
MLS,3e0058,turneresq,4,Mon Jul 20 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that (unless you're just talking about the $50k). If Drogba says ""I won't sign with Chicago even if they offer me $100 million/year, but I'll sign with Montreal for $4.5 million/year,"" then it seems the options are for Montreal to give something to Chicago so that they give him up, he finds a contract with another league, or change his mind and start shopping for real estate in Bridgeview."
MLS,3e0058,Menessy27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:21 2015 UTC,That doesn't really matter as long as they hold his rights
MLS,3e0058,TheBored23,4,Tue Jul 21 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"It matters if he opts out on MLS as a result. By the time he's available again, he'll be 38 and less valuable to the league and any individual team. Chicago's rights depreciate in value very quickly here; there's little to be gained in being stubborn about it."
MLS,3e0058,turneresq,14,Tue Jul 21 01:50:04 2015 UTC,"Reading the summary from krusader above it seems to sum up like this:  1) Chicago appears to initially passed on him with their Discovery priority.  2) Chicago got involved at some point after Drogba was made available to every team for negotiations.  3) We can assume that Montreal has tendered the required $50k in allocation to Chicago to get them to have to negotiate with Drogba or give up their Discovery claim.  4) We don't know what offer Chicago has made to Drogba, but it probably meets the ""objectively reasonable"" standard (i.e., they didn't offer him $300k/year or something silly like that).  5) Per Saputo, Drogba is a fan of a potential relocation to Montreal due to their demographics.  6) It can be inferred that Drogba is NOT a fan of a relocation to Chicago for whatever reasons (though we can guess what those are).  7) Chicago will have to pull a ""Revolution"", and offer substantially more to bring Drogba in (as New England did to get Jones to sign).  8) As of yet, Chicago has not pulled said ""Revolution"" such that Drogba has agreed to sign.  9) We do not know if there is a number that Chicago is able to offer to get Drogba to sign (I'm sure he'd be willing to play there if Chicago offers $13 million a year, but they're not going to do that obviously).  10) If Chicago cannot get Drogba to agree to play for them at ""X"" number, will Garber force Chicago to give him up for $50k or some other minimal compensation? Will Garber force Montreal to give up more than they want? What happens if Garber essentially stays out of it and Drogba walks, even though he would have signed Montreal's offer?  Can't wait to see how this turns out."

MLS,3e13b4,theschief,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:25 2015 UTC,Not everyone in the stadium is participating in the tifo. Presumably everyone who is is an Atlanta United supporter. They're representing themselves. General US fans can make their own tifo if they so desire.

I am sure they will be able to work in a ""USA ain't nothing to fuck with"" later to make up for the 30 seconds that what ever this banner is.  It simply doesn't matter big picture wise and if a group of fans want to do it, more power to them.  If people there don't want to participate good for them.  It is absolutely harmless."
MLS,3e13b4,sawillis,19,Tue Jul 21 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with your first sentence. In a lot of ways what helps and grows one helps and grows the other and there are some times where we should leverage or use what is helping one to help the other...but this is not one of these cases. I'm not country over club or club over country. I was fine with NYCFC and RBNY having floats at the USWNT parade because they sponsored the parade (might not have happened without them) and they didn't have active men's players or coaches on the float. They had leaders/coaches and players from their girls soccer camps. If this tifo is all about the USMNT then great but if it's advertising Atlanta's MLS team in any way then Blank & Atlanta can fuck off. I don't want another Cascadian colored Uncle Sam.    Edit: They should absolutely advertise and promote Atlanta MLS outside the stadium, but a tifo is for team that is playing on the field that day. Not for a team that doesn't start for another year and a half."

MLS chipped in a considerable amount to help make that parade happen.    About the game any banner would be up less than the time I see Scotia Bank logos, and Atlanta has 68k fans showing up with likely over half not US fans that were willing to travel to the Georgia Dome for the game.  Atlanta has a professional soccer team starting in 18 months.  Nothing wrong with doing it at all IMO.    I think in the last gold cup Portland did a Cascadia themed banner.  Like I said before it isn't that big of a deal."

MLS,3dzpoi,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:52 2015 UTC,That's certainly fair and you're probably right.  I was going by the fact that most away games OCSC has played so far have been the best selling games for their hosts which is obviously because of Kaka rather than the Orlando City team overall.    Hopefully Lampard is ready and Pirlo makes an appearance; it's going to be quite an event up there.  And if the ref can keep from red carding any of our guys for the first time in a while; it might be a great game.

My guess is that this homegrown game simply isn't attractive to the players anymore. I'm sure they don't want to play against a U-20 team and risk injury, so they didn't accept the invitation. This is probably just the group of homegrown players that wanted the free plane ticket to the all-star game and the per diem. Honestly, the most surprising thing about this roster is that Shipp accepted."
MLS,3dzju5,Alar1k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:17 2015 UTC,i'm sure theres some sort of age thing? are there any players older than 24 on this? I'm fine with the homegrown game being closer to a freshman/sophmore game than a 'all homegrown players' thing.
MLS,3dzju5,crocken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:40 2015 UTC,It kind of seems like it's all players who aren't getting as much playing time or attention outside of their local fanbases looking to prove themselves.
MLS,3dzju5,Tasslehoff,4,Tue Jul 21 18:48:13 2015 UTC,Is this game supposedly an even match? I would expect the home grown team to beat the US CA U-20's pretty easily
MLS,3dzju5,Caelanl,12,Mon Jul 20 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"I dont think that is a very good assumption.  I understand that the MLS homegrown team is not playing the US-U20s, but if they did I dont think they would be favored.  The US-U20 has many of the same players, but would be adding Cameron Carter Vickers, Emerson Hyndman, Joel Sonora, Zelalem, Desevio Payne, Rubio Rubin, Maki Tall....  I would take the US-U20s over this homegrown team."

MLS,3dyud5,sawillis,10,Mon Jul 20 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it is true that MLS and CONCACAF as a whole are known to have really poor refs. I used to watch EPL and MLS equally as much (cut back on EPL lately) and there was such a huge difference in the quality of reffing. MLS bad calls are often far more clearly bad calls. Clearly all this is due to the fact that the league is comparably newer and the refs are still somewhat inexperienced. I just don't think its wrong to say MLS reffing is much worse than premiere level European leagues. It will should get better overtime as long as we grow those refs."
MLS,3dyud5,duremville,4,Mon Jul 20 22:15:12 2015 UTC,CONCACAF refs are way worse.
MLS,3dyud5,Muffin4ever,4,Tue Jul 21 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"La Liga is also known for awful referees. I really don't buy the idea that our referees are worse than the referees elsewhere.

Hell, to be honest, when most of the calls are made by one single person that is directly on the field calls will be missed and calls that shouldn't be made are made. Regardless of how good the ref is that will happen and it's because he doesn't have a birds-eye view of the game. He's down there on the field."

MLS,3dyud5,SupportingKansasCity,7,Mon Jul 20 19:40:19 2015 UTC,My point is that referees make mistakes every single match. You could replace every last MLS referee with an elite Euro counterpart and one side is always still going to feel hard done by.
MLS,3dyud5,WR1206,3,Mon Jul 20 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"Just like players , refs seem to have dips in form as well. last season we had a slew of games midsession in the EPL where the refs were under microscope.

MLS,3dyud5,erockarmy1,19,Mon Jul 20 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"I think that, on the whole, we are a lot better off than you think. Yes, there are bad calls, and arguably, bad refs. However, the massive investment as already been made. More money might be helpful, but they also need more time. PRO is already doing a lot to further the quality of officiating.   PRO head honcho backs embattled MLS referees: Larson says refs are like in-laws  PRO Says 2nd Goal Should Not Have Stood Disciplinary statistics prove MLS/PRO are capable of some effective self-policing. Nevertheless, the type and quality of game varies significantly depending on the person calling it in the middle.  Referee From Union Opener Suspended For Blown Calls Head of the US/Canada Professional Referee Organization: Peter Walton The Professional Referee Organization   The U.S. Soccer Federation and Major League Soccer have joined forces to create the Professional Referee Organization (PRO).     The aims for PRO will be to develop a higher standard of officiating at a younger age and to produce referees who can represent the United States and Canada in FIFA competitions. U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always understood that the development of referees is an important aspect to the growth of the game in the United States. ‚ÄúPRO is another step toward the improvement and professionalization of our top referees. With the additional resources and funding provided by the formation of PRO, we will continue to build upon the progress we‚Äôve already made.‚Äù  Heading up PRO will be Peter Walton, a former referee who officiated just under 200 matches in the English Premier League. The Commissioner of the MLS, Don Garber, was delighted to get Walton on board.  He said: ‚ÄúMLS and U.S. Soccer proudly welcome PRO General Manager Peter Walton, who will utilize his exceptional experience as a referee and as an administrator, along with substantial resources, to help MLS achieve its vision of setting the worldwide standard in officiating.‚Äù  Walton has been involved with professional football since he joined the English Football League as an assistant referee in 1993. The 52-year-old advanced to the FIFA panel of Assistants in 1996 and then onto the Referees panel of the Football League in 1998. He accepted a full-time position as a referee in the English Premier League in 2003 and, in 2007, completed the Advanced Course for Referee Instructors hosted by CONMEBOL and FIFA in Ecuador. Walton commented: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to the next stage of my career as the general manager of the Professional Referee Organization.  ‚ÄúThe formation of PRO by U.S. Soccer and MLS provides a great opportunity to increase the development of referees and improve the overall quality of refereeing in the U.S. professional leagues. It‚Äôs a worthy challenge and I‚Äôm excited to get started.‚Äù The PRO model allows for increased funding towards the referee program, the hiring of experienced technical staff, improved training opportunities for officials, additional identification, additional identification and training opportunities for up-and-coming officials, amplified numbers of full-time referees employed, and raise the investment toward sports science.  The number of full-time referees is expected to increase as a result of this transition. With a more robust training program and full-time duties in place, the referee program‚Äôs professionalization will increase, whereas in previous years some officials have had to juggle their referee duties with an additional full-time occupation.   U.S. Soccer and MLS took significant steps in 2011 to create a U.S. Soccer professional referee department and relocate to New York. Seven new rookie referees were introduced to MLS last year, participating in almost 20 percent of the league‚Äôs regular season games.  The use of quantitative analysis and video also were substantial last year as referees were evaluated in real time at the newly constructed command center in New York. Former players and coaches served as in-stadium professional match evaluators, providing a more complete evaluation of the referees.  U.S. Soccer recently transitioned Herb Silva to the new role of Director of Referee Identification and Training in December of 2011. Silva, who had served as U.S. Soccer‚Äôs Director of Professional Referees, will work with a panel of former FIFA and professional officials to attend events around the country to identify and train the most promising young officials and provide them with additional training to accelerate their development. Silva will work closely with PRO to look for similar types of officials and make sure the training reinforces the officiating philosophy.   Approximately 45,000 new referees enter the officiating ranks every year, and U.S. Soccer will continue its efforts to put more online educational resources at their disposal.  A PRO Advisory Board will also be established and meet regularly to ensure satisfactory progress is being achieved."
MLS,3dyud5,Pakaru,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you here.   What I'd like to see, if this isn't already happening, is that more effort is taken in the offseason to work with teams in training camps and increasing communication between teams and PRO. While I may not be happy now, I'd feel a lot better if I see that officiating is improving year over year.  If I recall, this is already happening in the NFL."
MLS,3dyud5,Disorted,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"I think more communication with fans would help too. Even if it doesn't call out an official by name, it would at least be nice if there was some sort of notice put out that ""disciplinary action was made last month regarding such and such application of the rules"" and include the reasoning as well as the provided guidance.  Fans just want to know that progress is being made."
MLS,3dyud5,Pakaru,19,Tue Jul 21 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"Do you watch much European soccer?  They have a lot of shit calling too.  I don't disagree that the refs have been bad but I think it's magnified to us because we see a lot more games week in, week out."

MLS,3dyud5,FlyingCarsArePlanes,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:16 2015 UTC,"The refs are pretty good, in general. I've only refereed as high as amateur teens 16 and that is difficult.

MLS,3dyud5,CurtNo,6,Mon Jul 20 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"The amazing thing to me is that they keep on using the same ones. It's been established for 10 consecutive seasons that Baldomero Toledo has no idea how to be a referee, are you telling me you can't at least give someone else a try? It's not like they could do much worse at it.  At any other (non-executive) job in sports, if you're bad at your job for a season or 2, you're fired and replaced."
MLS,3dyud5,fredbrightfrog,2,Mon Jul 20 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"The people whose job it is to analyze and rate referees do believe that lower league referees are worse and the current MLS referees.

MLS,3dyud5,JonstheSquire,0,Mon Jul 20 19:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, clearly they are doing a great job at it analyzing and developing refs, as demonstrated by everyone agreeing with ""The refs seem to be worse every year. I actually liked some of the replacement refs last year.""  Simply having the job doesn't equate to being good at it. Sepp Blatter has more experience than me at being the president of FIFA, does that mean I can't criticize his work or hope to get an alternative?"
MLS,3dyud5,fredbrightfrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"PRO and union agreements probably have a lot to do with it. MLB umpires have a few notorious bad apples that every player would like to see booted. Heck, there's a survey every year that puts the same umpires on top as the worst in the league...yet they're still there.  If MLS wants to have more control over quality refereeing, the union agreement will have to change, or MLS will have to break it off with PRO. The union is never going to agree to guys getting canned, so MLS would likely have to go with another refereeing organization. But in that case...who else is there?"
MLS,3dyud5,whethervayne,4,Mon Jul 20 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"We don't even need anywhere remotely close to DP-level money to compete for refs who currently work in the EPL. That's the ridiculous thing.  English Premier League referees receive around $2,000 per game they officiate.   At the very most, an MLS head ref makes $875 a match (there are 4 tiers based on experience, with the 4th ref making as little as $200 a game).   If bumping up the pay from a few hundred bucks to $2000 is all it takes to widen the applicant pool to top league caliber refs, that seems like a no-brainer."
MLS,3dyud5,thelostdolphin,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean true ""DP"" money, but a ref variation similar to the 2K you mentioned."

But, I brought this up at a bar after watching Toledo bungle through yet another game and the debate ended when a guy said, 'The refs suck everywhere dude'. They may be better in other leagues but I don't think we are going to stop complaining about them any time soon."
MLS,3dyud5,steerbell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:23 2015 UTC,"I hate on Refs quite a bit but they do seem to be trying to get some new blood into the system and have gotten them to bring a bit of authority to the games. Years before refs would let players walk all over them. They also are calling dangerous play and simulation more and these are good for the game but tough to get the players to learn its not acceptable anymore.   Also the teams, Players are getting better way faster then the refs possibly can. I think they are getting better just not fast enough."
MLS,3dyud5,devish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:55 2015 UTC,"Why don't we try something different for a change and list off some good refs and assistant refs?  You know they exist in MLS.  Sure there are some atrocious games here and there but sometimes a ref just gets a call wrong.  Most ref bashing is kinda like user tech reviews online, no one comes back to post positive results with their product.  Again, not saying there aren't games that don't warrant a big fuck you to the ref.  I've seen a few games where people blame the ref for letting things get out of hand once someone sees red, but then you look and see hes handed out like 6 yellows before that..  MLS refs aren't quite where they need to be but I've seen some slight improvements this year.  IMO we are seeing some progression from an often overly physical  league with players sometimes hacking each other for the ball to something more skillful but it takes time and refs will be an easy scapegoat."

MLS,3dyud5,geminitx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"I've been completely appalled by the refs that have been assigned to Dynamo games this year. Last Saturday's match was unwatchable. The ref was extremely inconsistent with fouls vs. both teams. Ex: Will Bruin got a foul and talking to early in the match for going up to battle for a ball with his forearm out. RSL player does the same thing and DRAWS BLOOD on Alex... no foul. It was this all night and affected both teams to the point any action would happen, you'd have to look back at the ref to see if he approved or not. When a ref controls the game THAT MUCH, where you're watching the ref for the whistle more than the actual players with the ball, it might as well be NFL I'm watching. The July 3rd Chicago match was a similar abortion of a game by the ref.  Yes, we need to do SOMETHING about these horrible refs."
MLS,3dyud5,Pharaca,0,Mon Jul 20 18:12:48 2015 UTC,I am of the opinion that the Don should hire Pierluigi Collina or somebody to be head of officiating and then the person of that pedigree can tackle the problem top down.

MLS,3dywbl,barticusz,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:43 2015 UTC,TFC Might be skewed a little high since Gilberto is on their salary list still.

Brek Shea, Diego Valeri, Sacha Kljestan, Graham Zusi... the list of players who are paid less than he is but are probably a better value could go on and on. Valdes, Vitoria, Mbolhi, Fernando all of these players just scream mismanagement and there are dozens of other examples. Until we get a different ownership group Philadelphia will remain the worst run team in MLS."
MLS,3dywbl,spqr-king,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:38 2015 UTC,"Edu came at the same time as Dempsey and I think at that point he was still in the national team picture as our DM, despite his struggles at Stoke. He came back in his relative prime and behind Dempsey was the second most capped Nat to come back (Although Bradley came shortly afterwards)."
MLS,3dywbl,Jack2142,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:05 2015 UTC,That really doesnt mean we didnt overpay for him. It also doesnt account for all the other examples. I really dont think Edu and Dempsey have comparable careers prior to their return either putting the two in the same boat is a stretch.
MLS,3dywbl,Doobie352,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:29 2015 UTC,Edu has just under 50 caps for the United States and definitely was an important member of the squad until the last couple of years. At the time spending  700K on Edu seemed like a good deal and while not exactly Dempsey he is still a valuable player. If you don't want him on the books I would take him for the Sounders in a heartbeat as a 4th DP.
MLS,3dywbl,barticusz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:02 2015 UTC,Im not arguing that he isnt a solid player. Im arguing that over a million dollars which it was at the time was overpaying for him. He played well in the Scottish Premier League which is a great step down from the EPL which he was unsuccessful in to say the least. I really like Edu and I think he is our best player but it doesnt mean the team couldnt have gotten a better deal. Also like I said it doesnt change the multiple other examples that can be given. The fact that we are middle of the board in spending and yet get the whole money ball excuse regularly is ridiculous. Its simply mismanagement.
MLS,3dywbl,PopeAlGore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:12:41 2015 UTC,Alright I see what your saying although I think you picked a weird example in Edu. Then again you did buy him when you already had a solid D-Mid in Okugo and had to push him into the CB role where I think he really doesn't want to be.

MLS,3e3efb,futbolnico,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:13 2015 UTC,NWSL has only 18 woman rosters I believe. We were going into the WWC and we needed people who could play now. She was a bit of a defensive liability and it just wasn't workable with our roster at the time. Randy Waldrum said he loved having her on the team but needed someone who could make an impact now with 6 players gone. She was just a casualty of the small roster.

MLS,3dylec,IAmZeDoctor,4,Mon Jul 20 19:01:48 2015 UTC,Ike Opara hit a nice one off Matt Besler's pitch.
MLS,3dylec,ThisIsMyNewUserID,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:20 2015 UTC,I was there for this!
MLS,3dylec,IAmZeDoctor,13,Mon Jul 20 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"Initially, I thought this would be dumb, because USA would have to give up playing friendlies against top European opponents. But then I realized they'll have to give that up anyway - European teams won't have any free dates anymore, with this new tournament replacing friendlies. So why the hell not? It would be fun."
MLS,3dylec,cristane,4,Mon Jul 20 17:15:55 2015 UTC,I think CONCACAF will start playing AFC and CAF teams to fill the gap.
MLS,3dylec,carpy22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:35 2015 UTC,We might as well. Sucks that we won't be playing European teams outside of the Confederations and World Cup after 2018 though.
MLS,3dylec,boredinproperty,12,Tue Jul 21 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"Is there really enough depth there to make something like this work? I think making the even-numbered non-World Cup year Copa America span both confederations on a continual basis is a great idea, but do we really need to see more 6-0 beatdowns of the ""minnows"" of CONCACAF through something like this?  I think Klinsmann has the right idea of saying if we're going to play friendlies, we might as well make them as tough as possible. Testing ourselves against Germany and the Netherlands is a lot more productive, and a lot more fun to watch, than watching Haiti bunker for 90 minutes."
MLS,3dylec,lordcorbran,19,Mon Jul 20 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's split like it will be in UEFA: four hierarchical leagues with pro/rel among them, it would be split like this:  American A-League   Argentina Colombia Brazil Chile Uruguay United States Ecaudor Mexico Costa Rica Venezuela Peru   B-League   Paraguay Panama Trinidad and Tobago Bolivia Jamaica Haiti Honduras El Salvador Canada Cuba Guatemala   C-League   Antigua and Barbuda St. Vincent and the Grenadines Belize St. Kitts and Nevis Dominican Republic St. Lucia Aruba Bermuda Barbados Nicaragua Curacao   D-League   Puerto Rico Guyana Grenada Suriname Dominica US Virgin Islands Montserrat Cayman Islands Turks and Caicos Islands British Virgin Islands Bahamas Anguilla   My biggest concerns with that would be, as you said, not getting to test ourselves against elite European opposition, but hey, playing Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia regularly isn't the worst trade-off from a purely ""testing yourself"" perspective.   Also, pro/rel among these teams means that the US could find itself playing a ""season"" amongst the minnows at some point which wouldn't be terribly fun. Great for the minnows though: most of them would thrive from getting ten matches against like opposition and the chance to be promoted to play against even tougher teams.  While we're talking minnows, let's talk travel. We have some really poor nations in the Western Hemisphere especially in the Caribbean. Unless they're getting a lot of help from CONCACAF/CONMEBOL, they can't pay for all the potential travel.  Finally, there's MLS. The stuff we've got already fudges with our schedule, and now we'd be adding another two month tournament/season/whatever in which MLS is forced to release ALL of the best players from CONCACAF. That's rough."
MLS,3dylec,PKMNTrainerFuckMe,13,Mon Jul 20 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"The travel isn't as bad as it initially appears - the poorest FAs are all relatively clustered in the Caribbean region. The largest trips are done by the richer FAs.  Also, it'd take the place of current international friendlies. No disruption that doesn't already exist."
MLS,3dylec,Wotnograpefruit,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that for the smallest Caribbean nations, there aren't many direct connections amongst each other, and they often have to fly into and out of Miami just to go between islands. Of course, this means that they might choose to play matches in Miami as a neutral site instead."
MLS,3dylec,jaxx2009,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"But it wouldn't take over all friendly dates, you could still get in a couple friendlies a year. If it's modeled after UEFA that is."
MLS,3dylec,picketyp,7,Tue Jul 21 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"If it's modeled after UEFA's, there's no ""two-month season."" They use the already existing International dates on the FIFA calendar, which CONCACAF teams already abide by. There's no extra time to be taken away from their MLS clubs. The only difference is who the USMNT would play, not when."
MLS,3dylec,mgmfa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"For travel, you could have the lowest two divisions be like the lower divisions in most European Pyramids - the lowest two divisions are even and teams are clustered based on location. Granted, if Canada or a South American team dropped down to division 3, it would be a pain for travel, but the rest of the teams are close enough to each other than it shouldn't be too bad."
MLS,3dylec,WJMorris3,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"Also, if we wanted to be seeded in the World Cup, I'd absolutely want a Nations Cup like this. I think because UEFA is making these tournaments effectively qualifiers for Euro, which means they count more than friendlies. It would behoove the Americas to do the same."
MLS,3dylec,jkure2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"At the same time, these minnows need to play good teams too, and I think overall we're seeing the ability of concacaf as a whole increase. Who would have ever seen Haiti looking as good as they did this tournament? They almost made the semis! Costa Rica too, as if almost making thr semis of the world cup wasn't enough.  I like watching those teams play personally."
MLS,3dylec,prsancho2,6,Mon Jul 20 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"I could imagine a merger, although it would never happen, but leaving CFU as an independent Confederation: a. CFC (Caribbean Football Confederation), 25 FIFA members - 1 World Cup spot; b.  CoNCSAF (Confederaci√≥n de Norte, Centro y Sudam√©rica de F√∫tbol), 20 FIFA members - 7 World Cup spots."
MLS,3dylec,socialistbob,5,Mon Jul 20 18:35:35 2015 UTC,It would need to be more than seven. Eight or nine at least. For the past two World Cups more American teams have made it out of the group stage than European teams even though Europe has always had several more teams competing. Let the best team from the Caribbean play the best team from Oceania and give that team a berth.
MLS,3dylec,prsancho2,3,Mon Jul 20 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. But currently, 8 are the total spots the Americas have: Conmebol, 4.5; Concacaf, 3.5. By giving a full spot for CFU (CFC), not only makes easier for them to accept the split, but also it makes easier to organize the qualifiers. Unfortunately, 7.5 spots would spoil my system, and I love my Decagonals! :-D"
MLS,3dylec,socialistbob,2,Mon Jul 20 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"8 are the total spots but unless there were more than 8 spots Central America and Canada would not agree to joining the Pan American conference and several South American countries would also be against the plan since it would increase the difficulty of qualifying.   Assuming Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and the US would qualify that leaves only three berths for Columbia, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Canada, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Belize. Of those 16 teams I mentioned 6 were in the World Cup and 4 went on to the round of 16. What your system effectively says is that teams which made the round of 16 in the last World Cup should not have even been admitted into the tournament."
MLS,3dylec,prsancho2,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"In Brazil, because Brazil was host, there was an extra spot for Conmebol that actually does not exist. It also helped that, by draw, there was no playoff between Concacaf and Conmebol. Because of those circumstantial facts, the region had 10 spots, instead of 8. If I want my fancy dream to be real as possible, I cannot work with what is merely circumstantial. The fact is the Americas have 7 spots, plus two half-spot. I simply sacrificed those two half-spots to the Caribbean. If FIFA wants to give us more spots, I would appreciate. But the question always is ""from whom?"" Such is not an easy question to answer."
MLS,3dylec,socialistbob,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"But without more spots there is no incentive to have the system. However instead of sitting here and ripping yours apart I will propose my own equally unfeasible model.  World Cup qualifying needs to move to a three confederation model. 1 Euro Confederation, 1 Pan American and 1 African and Asian Confederation. Africa and Asia would get 8 berths, Pan Am would get 9 Europe would get 10 and the host would get one. This would equate to 28 automatic berths for a 32 team tournament. The top four teams of each confederation not already qualified would move to an inter contenintal playoff with four round robin groups of three.  Each group would have 1 European team, 1 American team and 1 Afro-Asian team. The winner of each group would qualify for the World Cup. This way you would have 10-14 European teams, 9-13 American teams and 8-12 African and Asian teams. You would have adequate representation from all confederations while simultaneously ensuring the highest standard of play."

FIRST ROUND - Group Stage (18 dates): two groups of 10 (North, and South); round robin, home and away; both group champions qualify (2 spots); teams finishing from second to sixth go to playoffs. SECOND ROUND - Playoffs (2 dates): five groups of 2 (2v6, 3v5, 4v4, 5v3, 6v2); home and away; all group winners qualify (5 spots)."

MLS,3dylec,prsancho2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:34 2015 UTC,"Add a Central American Conference and a Caribbean Conference, and you have a revolutionary tournament. Why CCL?!"
MLS,3dylec,whethervayne,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:57 2015 UTC,"As long as FIFA rankings factor into World Cup seeding, CONCACAF teams will need more competitive games to keep higher up.  USA, Mexico, and Costa Rica just dropped way off because we didn't have any meaningful games until now. Caribbean and Central American teams have their own tournaments, but USA, Mexico, and Canada are kinda SOL until Gold Cup/World Cup qualifying. Canada is the one who could really stand to benefit from more competition like this.  At the same time...MLS is built on USMNT players. The more time those players take time off, the more it hurts their clubs. If this could be done in the winter...I'm down."
MLS,3dylec,jaxx2009,2,Mon Jul 20 21:49:55 2015 UTC,OR MLS could just adopt a schedule that does not play on international dates...
MLS,3dylec,whethervayne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:37:53 2015 UTC,Yeah...but how does that work in North America? Less games to accommodate a summer break? Midweek games every week to fit them all in? Play through winter? Scandinavian-type calendar with a long winter break?  It's not an easy thing to do. A winter international tournament in warm-weather regions seems more likely.
MLS,3dylec,jaxx2009,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"Play less games, make each game more meaningful. reducing just 4 games removes all mid week games and could allow you to avoid most international breaks"
MLS,3dylec,mgmfa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:58 2015 UTC,Didn't realize the US went DOWN 7 spots despite being undefeated and beating Netherlands + Germany.
MLS,3dylec,whethervayne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yup. Friendlies don't count for much at all. Year-old win against Ghana and year-old ties against Portugal and Belgium count for more, I think, but less and less as time goes on.  EDIT: Somehow I keep forgetting that we lost to Belgium AET and not on PKs."
MLS,3dylec,mgmfa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"So I assume most South American sides got a boost last month, and we should jump up this month after beating Guatemala, Haiti, Cuba, and hopefully soon Jamaica and Mexico."
MLS,3dylec,whethervayne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at the rankings, yup, you can see South American and Euro qualifiers gave those teams boosts.

Birmingham has hosted the NCAA Championships a few times (I think 2012 and 2013?), some USMNT/USWNT friendlies, and Olympic matches (back in '96).  I'm honestly a little surprised but I hope we can pull together a respectable crowd."

MLS,3dzsss,JoeTerp,19,Mon Jul 20 21:24:06 2015 UTC,There are different ways to run a soccer team. It doesn't have to be all stars you bring in for DPs. Why should Dallas and DC change how they are operating their teams are winning?   Honestly once DC gets their new stadium I hope they bring in young DPs and not aging superstars.   Also Chicago is spending money. They have three DPs they just haven't put it together. The red bulls have spent money in the past as well. Just because they are gonna have one year without a superstar player doesn't mean they are small market.
MLS,3dzsss,DC-United1,6,Mon Jul 20 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. Dallas and DC's team building has been fine.  The key problem with all the markets OP listed is stadium location. Chicago's is absolutely terrible. Dallas' isn't very good. NE is awful. Red Bull Arena's location turned out to be a bit of a mistake, even though it seems reasonable to non-NYers.  Philly needs new ownership, I'll give OP that one. The rest need better stadium situations, which will be slow to come by."
MLS,3dzsss,sbrylski,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:50 2015 UTC,"Stadium situations are hard to fix, but I agree.  I think the league shot itself in the foot a bit with the rush for SSS.  Certainly worked for the transition from the dark days to now, but now it doesn't seem adequate.  We have all these big market teams saddled into small minded positions with stadia out in the middle of nowhere.  Especially in soccer, as we have seen with the post TFC success stories, downtown stadia and atmosphere is key to having this identity of a club that matters."
MLS,3dzsss,rojomi5,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"Who cares if there teams are winning, from a league perspective, it doesn't matter, some team is going to win every year.  Some team wins the Irish league every year, it doesn't advance the cause of the league.  This topic is outside of of that. Yes, having a team like FC Dallas is good for the league, showing that with youth investment and smart front office moves, you can compete on the field. But that is a waste of a market. Save teams with that approach for your Columbus, Salt Lake, Kansas City sized markets.    DC is an event town, they are winning this year, they were winning last year, people don't go because they aren't seen as an event, they aren't acting like a Big Time club. Maybe when they get a new stadium things will change, we will see.  Dallas is another energetic, big ego kind of city. Jerry Jones and Mark Cuban own teams in Dallas, and George Bush used to. Thats the kind of swagger you need, for me FCD doesn't fit the profile."
MLS,3dzsss,DC-United1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"It's not about the size of the city, it's about the ownership group. Dallas has an ownership group that doesn't like to flash a lot of cash so they develop young (mostly latin american to appeal to that section of the city's population) talent. Sure, a decent sized market does make sense to have more spend. I agree. But it should come from a domino effect that hasn't taken place yet. Once the biggest currently shitty markets (chicago and philly) get ownership change, at the very least in philosophy if not in actual transplantation, it'll be harder for mid-table teams to survive without committing hard to either buying talent or moneyballing it. And since it's easier to just buy players, those who can will do so. So eventually your vision will probably come to fruition, but only after years and years of change."
MLS,3dzsss,byrdan,0,Tue Jul 21 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"that is what I am saying. There is a mismatch between the market and the ownership group. FC Dallas are run like how I would expect a San Antonio or OKC MLS club would be run, which is fine, the league could benefit from that too. But I think the league should be looking to shift these owner operators into the appropriate markets and then selling the rights to the Big Market Franchises to people who are willing run it like a big time operation, attract big name talent, big crowds, and lots of talk and excitement.  Right now, Orlando and Seattle are seen as big time clubs MLS, Portland too even though they lack the size. If they can keep that level of relevancy and ambition, imagine where the league would be when Chicago, Dallas, Philly, Boston, New York, LA, DC, and Houston are all trying to be the biggest kid on the bloc?  That would be must watch stuff, and that is level of excitement that really starts to permeate into the national sporting culture as well as the worldwide soccer culture."
MLS,3dzsss,cdbz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:21 2015 UTC,DC is gonna end up averaging over 15k-16k for the season I think and for the stadium they play in it is pretty damn good. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind if they don't completely screw up the rebranding then they will sell out the new stadium consistently.
MLS,3dzsss,cdbz,9,Tue Jul 21 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"Arguably in every respect except marketing (granted, that's a large one) RBNY operate like a big time club. They built and own their own world class stadium and training facilities. They've developed one of, if not the single strongest academy system in the country, which is already beginning to bear fruit. They put on an enormous amount of youth soccer camps in the tri-state area. And they've finally adopted a smart, sound approach to building a roster from the bottom up.  NYCFC have arrived with a big splash and none of the MLS 1.0 marketing baggage, so they've upstaged NYRB in publicity for this year. But I'm actually curious, from your perspective if the Red Bulls were to continue to heat up and either win the Eastern Conference or even MLS Cup with this roster, would they still be ""acting like a small market club?""  I have no problem with the club finally starting to build a responsible bottom-up roster that have proven necessary to win in MLS"
MLS,3dzsss,LocksTheFox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:57 2015 UTC,"Someone wins MLS every year.  For a team from NY, its the way you win that matters.  If RBNY win MLS cup and they weren't selling out their 2nd half of the regular season, or not being talked about on the streets, then I would consider it a waste.  They certainly are one of the closer teams to 'Big Time' status, but in NYC, the standards are higher.  When I see those empty seats at RBA, I cringe. There are millions of people around, and you can't fill 25,000? I have been to Red Bull games, back when I lived in Queens and they played at Giants stadium, so I know what its like getting there, don't bother with a lecture. That obviously was a while ago, back in the Juan Pablo Angel days, and I am sure a lot has changed for the better, but it felt so minor league, and I got the same feeling from DC United games around the same time. When you watch Portland, KC, Seattle, etc. you don't get that feeling. Makes you think more of something like the Polish league While the play might not be great, the atmosphere makes it look and feel very important, what happens in the game matters to people's lives, matters to the city as a whole.   adopted a smart, sound approach to building a roster from the bottom up.   does that sound like a Major League New York Sports Franchise? No, it sounds like the Kansas City Royals.  Its better for the league to have its Kansas City Royals in Kansas City, and its New York Yankees in New York."
MLS,3dzsss,xxtoejamfootballxx,2,Tue Jul 21 04:05:16 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that the Red Bulls, because they are in NYC, have no options in how they build their franchise regardless of the kind of results they are putting together? They can't build a solid foundation group and develop a pipeline of talented youth because ""The Yankees spend big on players""?  That's absurd.  Spending big is what the Red Bulls did for years (see: Henry, Marquez, Cahill) and in the first year of not having big names suddenly you say they don't spend big?  Yes the philosophy around building the franchise changed, maybe that is because in all those years of spending big we won exactly 0 MLS Cups (you can count them if you like, they're right here: ___) The atmosphere at RBA is significantly better than what you are making it out to be.  It isn't the best but it is far from the worst.  The location has improved with the additions of numerous new buildings in the area (brought about by the presence of the team) and the new train station going in within the next couple years is going to make a massive impact on attendance.  The Red Bulls are not CURRENTLY spending big, but have a history of spending big and elevating the league's image through that.  They have shifted to building their own youth system to develop a consistently winning franchise and at the same time they have made a significant impact on the area around their stadium.  Obviously playing in Giants stadium felt minor league, the whole league felt minor league back then.  Teams build in different ways, the fact that they are in New York should not change their goal of winning an MLS cup.  Spending big couldn't win a cup, time to try something new."
MLS,3dzsss,ispeakpittsburghese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:24 2015 UTC,"Every team should have a focus on youth development. And having homegrown players can really help fill out a roster, this is important in soccer across the world. But when you come out and say it, without saying other things, like that is the entire focus of the team, that sounds small time, like you can't afford to do anything else.  If you really believe that this is the best way to win, that is fine, then you should take all that saved money, and use it to market and hype up the players that you have produced, so people think they are a big deal. Something.    Plus, its not like LA Galaxy ignore home grown development. They have Zardes, plus BJIV and some others in the pipeline, and they use these players to compliment their big money stars. Seems to be a pretty good formula.  But again, the spending isn't the whole story. Portland are in their own way, Big Time. They did just spend decent cash on that new Argentine, but before that and maybe even still now, you wouldn't call them big spenders, at least compared to LA or Toronto or to the Henry-Cahill partnership, but the reason they are Big Time, is because they matter, or they give the impression that they matter to the culture of the city, or at least the sporting culture.  Granted there is a lot less competition in Portland than in New York, but there are also a lot less people, deal with it, don't make excuses.  Even when I see empty seats at Yankee Stadium, I don't worry that the Yankees are not longer important to the city.  When I see empty seats at FedEx Field, I don't worry that the Redskins aren't important to DC.  I see too much gear, I hear too much talk about those teams, both on tv and from regular people.  NYCFC has been brought up in conversations by other people, but never RBNY, this is the sense I get of the team and where it fits, and that is what needs to change most of all, how it happens, I don't really care."
MLS,3dzsss,SisuSoccer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:56 2015 UTC,Lol if you have followed it at all fans have been calling for better marketing since Red Bull bought the team. Marketing is what they need not big signings.

MLS,3dzsss,Ragnar_Targaryen,5,Mon Jul 20 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"Dallas is limited by their location and relatively tight spending owners, but they make up for it with an academy that produces cheap, talented players better than most teams.  DC is limited by their stadium being a crumbling shithole, which also requires an unsustainable rent. A new stadium is coming, and once that is a reality, the owners can stop hemorrhaging money on the stadium and start hemorrhaging money on fun shit, like quality international DPs. They also are really good at finding cheap, local talent and playing MLS Moneyball  Philly and Chicago have poor ownership and not the best locations going for them.  RBNY has a somewhat uncaring owner that is partially balanced by the fact that they are New York and have an awesome stadium. Furthermore, I think they are interestingly enough stronger thanks to the new kids on the block NYC (addition by division?). So they haven't found a replacement for Tim Cahill or Thierry Henry yet...eh, they still have good players.  And for NERevs...well I just hate Bob Kraft and the way he treats this club. Perhaps I'm unjustified for thinking this way. But until the Revs are treated more on par with his precious Patriots, and especially until we see more progress with the South Boston stadium, they won't quite be a destination team"
MLS,3dzsss,johanspot,5,Mon Jul 20 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"NYRB has the best, and at the time most expensive, stadium in the league. DC United and FC Dallas lead their respective conferences as of now. Philly... fuck."
MLS,3dzsss,shoecat,3,Mon Jul 20 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"I have plenty of complaints about NYRB's ownership, but this is the same ownership that built one of the best stadia in the country and brought in Henry, Cahill, and Kljestan.  Meanwhile, Dallas and DC are at the top of the standings. Why change what's working?  The Revolution were in the MLS Cup last year and are actively working toward a new stadium. Plus they opened up the pocketbook for Jermaine Jones. (Just as a reminder, Chicago was in that other envelope.)"

MLS,3dzsss,glorkvorn,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:00:48 2015 UTC,"its not about the teams or their records. Its their approach and how they are seen and respected within their own markets, or rather, is the soccer franchise a representation of how the other sports teams in that town behave relative to the other teams in their league?  NYRB is sort of close, they had Henry and Cahill and a nice stadium, but they never fill it and they are in the biggest city in the country, to me, its embarrassing. And they have done little to reestablish themselves as big time since Henry and Cahill left. Kljestan is equivalent to the Mix signing in my opinion, but they don't have any answer to Pirlo, Lampard or Villa; not saying they have to get an aging guy, but go after a Giovinco or Gio Dos Santos, make something happen, get your name on people's minds."
MLS,3dzsss,MGHeinz,2,Tue Jul 21 03:53:53 2015 UTC,"Your argument is that RBNY ""never fill"" their stadium, even with stars like Henry and Cahill, so they should sign big names to replace them just to get their ""name on people's minds""? On what basis do you think new big names would satisfy your obsession with seeing a filled RBA?"
MLS,3dzsss,UpTheAnteRazov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"A big name signing or two is only one aspect of the equation. The club need to be marketed better. They need to create a sense of importance. A big name player can help, but they need more. NYCFC have a higher attendance and they are an upstart. RBNY have had 20 years of history and haven't managed to entrench themselves in a meaningful way.   My obsession is with the league reaching its potential. Having a middling franchise in New York does not help. Even though the Knicks are terrible and have been for a long time, they are still a Big Time club. They are terribly run, but people talk about them all the time, people still go to watch them, they can make big moves and attract big names. I am not saying that RBNY fans should want their team to become the Knicks, obviously they should want to win. But my point is that winning in New York should look like the late 90s-early 200s Yankees, and even if you're not winning, you should still be a big deal because this is New York and everything matters here."
MLS,3dzsss,drgath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:25 2015 UTC,Late 90s early 2000s Yankees didn't know the meaning of not winning.  They were a big deal because of how much they were winning.

MLS,3dwc0j,mawbles,0,Mon Jul 20 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"Once again, I never said anything to the effect of Chicago is better than Columbus or that penso is a secret agent or anything like that. Forget which teams were even playing. Team A won 3 to team B's 1.  Oh, but team A had a soft penalty. Ok, 2-1. Oh, and team B should have had two more goals but they were wrongly disallowed. 2-3? Oh, and team B had a guy get sent off in part because of a dubious yellow card given earlier, after which has team A scored one of its three goals. And team B doesn't even deserve a point?   People seem to be thinking im arguing that the Fire are a better team and Penso screwed us. No. I think we were terribly unlucky, and I don't see how anyone without blinders can't see that."

MLS,3dwc0j,jkure2,4,Mon Jul 20 15:13:28 2015 UTC,"Deserving a point equates to deserving to be top of the table? I said to put the flairs aside, you can bash the fire in a different thread."
MLS,3dwc0j,mawbles,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"The penalty was a mistake, but I'd say everything else was fair. It's not like we didn't win by 2 anyway."

Can you share whatever evidence you have?"
MLS,3dwc0j,Jingr,0,Mon Jul 20 17:17:24 2015 UTC,"Go back and watch. Nyarko in the first half wrongfully called offside and a disallowed goal near the end. And there is a thread about how penso ""should lose his whistle"", not that I totally agree. It was the whole officiating crew, and I don't think it was malicious."
MLS,3dwc0j,jkure2,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"I watched them be rightfully disallowed, if that's what you're wondering."

Darlington Nagbe is getting a green card at the moment which would do the same thing for the Timbers. My comment was more of an ode to all the previous rule changes that have been made for big markets like LA.    Its not Bruce fault that he knows how to navigate the rules.   You're forgetting that a lot of the rules that you're talking about were created just for LA.   DP rule: created for LA  Targeted Allocation money: created for LA  Other teams have found ways to take advantage of these rules (like the Timbers grabbing Lucas Melano), but in the end, almost all of these rules that are expanding MLS are created solely for LA's initial benefit.   I, for one, am not complaining. I actually really like what LA is doing for this league. They're forcing the league to expand and bring in big names like Steven Gerrard, Gio Dos Santos, Robbie Keane, etc. This league wouldn't be where it is today without the Galaxy."
MLS,3dwymq,Ragnar_Targaryen,8,Mon Jul 20 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that a lot of the rules that you're talking about were created just for LA.   That is a bullshit argument, man. While the DP rule was put into place so that LA could sign Beckham, it was clear from the get go that the rule was going to benefit every team. Nobody in their right mind can argue that adding the DP rule was detrimental or favoritist in any way. It was a move to help the league grow as a whole, not just LA.  And TAM helps a lot of teams a hell of a lot more than it helps us. We could make trades all day and still wouldn't have enough TAM money to cover Omar's salary for next year. TAM was meant to create excitement around the league by giving teams more room to add to the roster during the second window.  Neither of your examples are rule changes that only benefit LA. In fact, the second example (TAM) practically forces LA to lose the best defender in the league at the end of the season."
MLS,3dwymq,AnalAttackProbe,0,Mon Jul 20 15:53:14 2015 UTC,Neither of your examples are rule changes that only benefit LA   I know. That was my point. The rules initially benefit LA but then the other teams follow suit.

These rules were initially created for LA's benefit, and gave them quite the leg up. But they all benefit every team, and in fact the league as a whole.  You guys just get a little bit of a head start sometimes. And most of us are really OK with that because it DOES benefit the league and make it more fun to watch."

Then other teams immediately started bringing on DPs... so it's not like LA lorded over the league with a DP rule that no one else could take advantage of.   Targeted Allocation money: created for LA   Absolute bullshit.  What eventually became the TAM rule has been in discussion in some form since before the CBA talks.  What people assumed was a 4th DP or some sort of ""young DP"" or ""domestic DP"" became the Core Player rule.  There's no reason to think other teams weren't lining up Core Players before the announcement; LA is one of the few teams that has a roster situation to take advantage of the Core Player rule this instant (read: Gonzalez and his ""low"" DP salary) and they're one of the playing markets that allows them to pursue another DP with ease.  Hell, Portland took advantage of the rule right quick, it seems.  Teams don't just rush out to spend money or take advantage of new rules - this was planned for a bit by Portland. (And if Portland didn't plan it, then they're shortsighted and unwise.)  That's a far cry different situation than ""created for LA.""   Other teams have found ways to take advantage of these rules (like the Timbers grabbing Lucas Melano), but in the end, almost all of these rules that are expanding MLS are created solely for LA's initial benefit.   Bullshit again!  If it was solely for LA's benefit, the rules would have been crafted to prohibit the Timbers or other teams from easily using them.  Look, if you want to deny LA their supposed advantage, feel free to turn away your new DP.  We'll all go back to where our teams were before Core Player/TAM.  But, a bit of a surprise is in store for you:  LA is still going to be consistently stellar.  The reason?  No.  Not money.  Not Garber rules.  It's Coaching.  It's Scouting.  It's smart budgeting.  It's Academy development.  It's a strong USL presence.  Core Player/TAM aside, Galaxy are annually one of the best teams in the league because their program operates as the best team in the league."
MLS,3dwymq,grnrngr,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand why LA fans are getting so butt hurt about my comment. I'm not accusing LA of cheating, I'm not crying foul on them, I'm merely just stating what I see. Now let's read this book :)  You're twisting my words to mean something else. Let's rip apart your rebuttal like you ripped apart my comment.     DP rule: created for LA   Maybe. Then other teams immediately started bringing on DPs... so it's not like LA  lorded over the league with a DP rule that no one else could take advantage of.   Maybe? Are you serious? The DP rules, AKA ""The Beckham Rule"", was created so LA could sign David Beckham. Am I complaining? No, because that led to the signing of Diego Valeri, Michael Bradley, David Villa. I'm happy LA was pushing for a DP type of player on each team. To say that the DP rule was not created for LA is just naive, it's called the Beckham rule for a reason.     Targeted Allocation money: created for LA   Absolute bullshit. What eventually became the TAM rule has been in discussion in some form since before the CBA talks. What people assumed was a 4th DP or some sort of ""young DP"" or ""domestic DP"" became the Core Player rule.   Absolute bullshit? I would argue no. LA has been wanting and needing a 'Core DP' for ages. I guarantee they were on the forefront of pushing for a 'Core DP' slot, or what would eventually become the TAM. Now, to say that they were the only ones pushing for a Core DP slot is just stupid, nor am I pushing for that argument. I guarantee that other teams, like Portland, Seattle, TFC, etc. were pushing along with LA but it's quite common knowledge that LA has the most say in these scenarios because they have the big-market, and I'm not even complaining, they can keep the big-market.    Hell, Portland took advantage of the rule right quick, it seems. Teams don't just rush out to spend money or take advantage of new rules - this was planned for a bit by Portland. (And if Portland didn't plan it, then they're shortsighted and unwise.)   Yup you're right. We agree on this. Merrit Paulson (owner of the Timbers) has stated that he's wanted to sign Lucas Melano for a while now so it's safe to say that Portland has been planning on this 'Core DP' slot for awhile. However, my argument isn't based on who uses the rules, but it's based on who initiates it. I guarantee that if Portland went to MLS over the off-season and said, ""Hey, we want to sign Lucas Melano but we don't' have any more DP slots, can we negotiate a Core DP slot?"" then MLS would just say no. They proved this when they told MP to pay for the whole $5m fee for Lucas Melano. MLS has shown time and time again they don't want to help the small markets as much as the big-markets. According to this source, Gio cost 7m Euros which I'm sure MLS picked up some of the transfer fee. Where was the help for Lucas Melano? None...    Other teams have found ways to take advantage of these rules (like the Timbers grabbing Lucas Melano), but in the end, almost all of these rules that are expanding MLS are created solely for LA's initial benefit.   Bullshit again! If it was solely for LA's benefit, the rules would have been crafted to prohibit the Timbers or other teams from easily using them.   Ok, here is where you twist my words. I didn't say ""it was solely for LA's benefit,"" I said ""[it was] created solely for LA's initial benefit"". Big difference there. I'm arguing that LA is the pioneer for a lot of these new rules, in which I'm not upset about because the rest of the league follow suit. I'm merely stating what I see.    Look, if you want to deny LA their supposed advantage, feel free to turn away your new DP. We'll all go back to where our teams were before Core Player/TAM.   Nope, I'm happy with our new DP :) I never complained about the new rules, I actually really like that, as you'll see in the original TAM announcement thread last week.    But, a bit of a surprise is in store for you: LA is still going to be consistently stellar.   I know :) every league needs a New York Yankees, New England Patriots, Miami Heat (lebron era) . . . I'm very thankful for what LA has done for this league. It wouldn't be where it is without LA Galaxy.    The reason? No. Not money. Not Garber rules. It's Coaching. It's Scouting. It's smart budgeting. It's Academy development. It's a strong USL presence.  Core Player/TAM aside, Galaxy are annually one of the best teams in the league because their program operates as the best team in the league.   Again, I know :) I hate the Galaxy because they are the pioneers pushing this league to it's limits. Never once did I cry foul against LA, never once did I say they were cheating. LA is quite simply the club that will push this league to it's limits.   I hope you have a good rest of your week :)"

MLS,3dwtl7,WonderboyYYZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:26 2015 UTC,Pineda was playing much better. Chad Barrett was a year younger (he's slowed down a bit since last year). Azira wasn't god awful when we had to play him when Ozzie was injured. Brad Evans was a starting midfielder for us. Neagle was on the bench more than this year. Yedlin was a speedster up the side feeding balls to the MF and Forwards. Oba wasn't hurt as long as this year so far. Dempsey didn't rip up a ref's book and wasn't gone as long for international duty.
MLS,3dwtl7,Audicity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, i'm just saying this isn't any less of a ""team"" than last year, even with the struggles without ObaDeuce. I think it's a combination of factors, not poor roster construction (well, not entirely)."
MLS,3dwtl7,WonderboyYYZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"not poor roster construction (well, not entirely)   I'll go to my deathbed that Neagle has never been worthy to be on our starting roster.  At the start of the year, the lineups looked almost identical to last year's. But since we've had to change things up (such as giving Andy Rose a starting role and moving Neagle into a Striker role), the team isn't clicking like before because things aren't the same.  The only thing I've liked with these weird experimentations is Thomas up as a Striker. I think he has the potential to be deadly up there. Friberg just got here so I'll wait to hold judgment on him, but he looked decently solid for his first game back as a Sounder."

MLS,3dw6a9,nautika,9,Mon Jul 20 16:12:57 2015 UTC,Any other Orlando fans at the game feel like the attendance number is off?  33k is close to what we normally see.  Seemed way more ppl were there with the Brazilian night and all.  FO posted they expected nearly 40k ... hours before the match.  I can't imagine they would have posted that without the early numbers backing it up.
MLS,3dw6a9,MisterBlueBalls,3,Mon Jul 20 01:40:42 2015 UTC,I was there and put the number at 35k before the official announcement.  The atmosphere was fantastic as usual.  Our average is probably closer to 30k than 33k considering out first game had 60k+in attendance.
MLS,3dw6a9,dubron,5,Mon Jul 20 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"Actually 30k is what we usually see, so with the Brazilian night promo, the extra 3k is about right."
MLS,3dw6a9,3kindsofsalt,2,Mon Jul 20 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"I'm new to this, but how is it that the capacity is 19,500 but they were able to fit 33,000?"
MLS,3dw6a9,dubron,6,Mon Jul 20 04:26:42 2015 UTC,"The stadium we are building was originally planned for 19,500. OCSC had planned to cap our home games at that number to get fans used to the size of the new stadium. They had no clue that 19,500 simply isn't anywhere near enough for the community we have. So they just open up more sections as tickets are sold.  So that's where the number came from. Now we know the new stadium will have 25-28k (still not 100% decided). So, the capacity could be updated, but at this point, we've been using 19.5k might as well just finish out the season at that number and reset for next year once we know the new capacity for sure."
MLS,3dw6a9,3kindsofsalt,2,Mon Jul 20 05:00:16 2015 UTC,Seems like a step backward to leave the Citrus Bowl.  Just keep using it.
MLS,3dw6a9,profstenny,6,Mon Jul 20 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"I'd much rather have the team playing on grass instead of turf. That and it's clear that the Citrus Bowl isn't meant for soccer. From the stands you can't see the sidelines, so when the ball gets close to there, it's tough to see when the ball goes out.  Noise doesn't travel the best so coordinating chants can sometimes be difficult when you're on the other side of the stadium from SGs.  Also, the city controlling the Citrus Bowl, staffing it, the drinks, the food...  it's all not that great. Every game I go to the staff there has some new rule that they randomly spring on you. One game I get patted down going in to the game, next game I get waved on through. The service in the stadium is awful (AT&T, anyway). The food is terrible. The new stadium will all be run by the team, so what we eat and drink and the game-day standard operating procedures will all be run by the team.  Finally, it rains here. So having the cover over the stands will 1) keep us dry and 2) keep noise in and hopefully make it easier to chant together.  It'll be sad to see us go to sub-30k attendance, I've loved seeing us at #2. But I can't wait for the new stadium. We'll start out the next season in the Citrus Bowl, but in the summer we'll have the new digs ready!"
MLS,3dw6a9,theschief,3,Mon Jul 20 18:35:06 2015 UTC,All great points!  Thanks
MLS,3dw6a9,dlm891,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:14 2015 UTC,"Even if capacity is at the low end of the projection (25,000), based on this season I don't think you'll fall further than 3-4 in attendance, and might even stay 2 depending on how NYCFC continues to draw in Yankee stadium.   Sure, TFC and LA have a bigger capacity than 25K, but TFC isn't going to sell 25,000+ unless they get in the playoffs this year (looking good so far, though), and I don't think LA is going to move much higher than 25K average, realistically."
MLS,3dw6a9,MisterBlueBalls,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:03 2015 UTC,New stadium will have a roof and so the atmosphere ought to get even better. Smart to plan for less people than your inaugural season.
MLS,3dw6a9,ucfskuba,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"Feel like 25-28k will be ideal.  The ideal (for the club at least) is to have guaranteed sellouts.  Jumping the gun and immediately increasing the capacity to this year's average of 33,000 may end up leaving empty seats.  And if anything, Orlando could host a few major games per year at the Citrus Bowl (San Jose and Montreal host major games at bigger stadiums)"

MLS,3dw6a9,revs5402,5,Mon Jul 20 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"I like how Gillette is listed at a capacity of 20,000 and had an attendance of 28,000.  I'm assuming the lower bowl is the 20,000 they list, but with Gillette actually having a capacity of 65,000 (might be a little off) it seems odd to me that they wouldn't include at least the  middle tier of seats seeing as they sell them."
MLS,3dw6a9,halfcentaurhalfhuman,5,Mon Jul 20 02:20:18 2015 UTC,"Orlando does the same with citrus bowl... our official sell out number is 19500 because it's what our stadium was going to be, but the citrus bowl.holds 65k and we routinely hit way above our official capacity."
MLS,3dw6a9,TheBored23,2,Mon Jul 20 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"Generally, they open the first 25 (Out of 35) rows of sections 101-117 and 127-143, leaving the goal-line opposite the Fort empty.  As far as I could tell from being there, they opened the entire lower bowl save for sections 119 and 120 (which are still closed off for NFL Season renovations). Add a few hundred NYCFC fans in the 217/218 level and some added club seats, and I think an extra 40-50% over 'capacity' was a pretty fair expectation. Overall, a very impressive turnout - it makes me wish the October game was at Gilette, but I'm sure I'll find my way to the Bronx anyway."

That would leave us with a final attendance for the season of 21,049.   I factored San Jose at 18k and NYCFC at 27k for that calculation; both have no more extra-capacity matches planned. So it's probably a bit of an underestimate, given that Seattle and LA should average thousands more per game during this final stretch, while no one should be dropping by that amount."

MLS,3dw6a9,TheBishop7,6,Mon Jul 20 02:05:50 2015 UTC,I was actually shocked with how many people showed considering how bad the weather was only an hour or so before the original kickoff.
MLS,3dw6a9,whethervayne,6,Mon Jul 20 01:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I'm assuming the Crew is counting ticket sales that didn't show up. There were still quite some space in the seats, especially in the 200 levels. Still, the far side seats were packed and rowdy."
MLS,3dw6a9,TheBishop7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:38 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I have been all the games except the galaxy match this season and this was one of the few matches that actually felt like a good turn out. Lots of seats were full in the upper deck which is usually barren in most matches and the lower deck looked pretty average to me
MLS,3dw6a9,Tinckoy,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, they always do that. I really meant that it looked more full then I expected, though to be fair I expected a graveyard.  They definitely count tickets sold, which includes plenty of season ticket holders who don't show up."
MLS,3dw6a9,whethervayne,2,Mon Jul 20 02:15:37 2015 UTC,I am seriously considering upgrading to those premier seats next year just to put two butts in seats every game.
MLS,3dw6a9,TheBishop7,3,Mon Jul 20 02:19:15 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people don't use the tickets that they paid for. I've missed two games this season and I was pissed about it. I sold one and traded in the other to make sure I was getting my dollar's worth.
MLS,3dw6a9,Tinckoy,2,Mon Jul 20 02:23:52 2015 UTC,I bought season tickets the last few years but sometimes life just gets in the way for me. As much as I love going I've missed about 4 already this year which bums me out :(

MLS,3duv12,scorcherdarkly,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:40:57 2015 UTC,I actually think that's not the worst idea for RSL. It's not like we have killer DP's anyway and we're always well within cap. Plus with Nick being 36 he can't have too many top play seasons left in him.

Plus the last thing I want is a DP in goal..."
MLS,3duv12,0piat3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:28 2015 UTC,"The last thing anybody wants is a DP keeper, but that's going to have to happen if anybody wants Guzan stateside, which would help out immensely on the USMNT squad."

MLS,3duv12,Urnext,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:08:54 2015 UTC,"Because it would be an easier travel schedule for our  starting keeper for one. Not everybody makes every practice. So him being stateside would help. It'd be better for team morale. Having somebody walk in as a starter half way through the practice schedule can be distracting to say the least. Most of the team are MLS players anyway and I personally think having another guy stateside is good for the league's growth and legitimacy on the world stage.   You look at England for example. EPL is a beast of a league, but their National squad hasn't done a whole lot in a long while. Brazil and Argentina are the opposite. Then you look at Bundesliga which some of, if not, the hardest league in world and look at their national club and they're... intimidating. EPL is a joke to me (downvote me if you like) because all they do is buy their players. Look at Man City. They were shit forever, then an oil tycoon swoops in buys the team and in 3 seasons their champions. Give me a break. All it is, is a game of ""My Salary is Bigger than Your Salary"" when you boil it down.   Sorry, went on a bit of a rant there."
MLS,3duv12,ltjboy03,3,Mon Jul 20 09:21:23 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your point about the Premier League at all. It has no sort of relevance to your argument. If anything, it goes against it. You mention the Premier League being such a strong league and a huge buying league but English players rarely leave England. Then you mention the German, Brazilian, and Argentinian leagues, where it is more common for the domestic players to leave. You say England's national team isn't as good as these other national teams but there's more players in the local league for England than the other leagues. That sounds very contradictory to your point."
MLS,3duv12,bpmo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:19:04 2015 UTC,"My point was, and maybe I wasn't clear enough in my mostly incoherent ramblings, English players aren't very good.

Don't think anyone in MLS would be willing to pay the fee and his DP salary, even if he has been starting for the USMNT the past year. Guzan doesn't have the star power of Tim Howard, who I think is probably the only GK that a MLS team would want to spend the DP money for realistically."

MLS,3duv12,westcoastgeek,-12,Sun Jul 19 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"I'll say it, I think Guzan is overrated because he plays in the EPL. He's nowhere near the level of what Howard, Friedel, or Keller have shown in terms of positioning, distribution, or organization of the defense, etc. Also, I've seen Rimando single handedly win games for RSL (which is incredibly rare for a goalkeeper). I can't recall Guzan doing that. I think Hamid has a higher ceiling than Guzan based on his athleticism, etc. Guzan is good, I just don't see him on the level of those other USMNT goalies"
MLS,3duv12,mydogfarted,10,Sun Jul 19 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree with you. However, Guzan has 6"" on Rimando, which is a huge advantage in his favor, and is 6 years younger as well. He's still got room to grow as a keeper, while Rimando has peaked. Unfortunately, Guzan has been mired in a shitty team."
MLS,3duv12,TheBishop7,7,Sun Jul 19 22:56:35 2015 UTC,I can't recall Guzan doing that   Dude did it all the time for Chivas back in the day and has done it several times for Villa the past couple years.
MLS,3duv12,Tcberk,2,Mon Jul 20 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. He was pretty much the reason they stayed up in the 2012-2013 (the year they came closest to relegation). He won their player of the year award that season too, and you don't do that without putting the team on your back for some games."

The idea that Guzan is out of this world better than every keeper in the league and it wouldn't even be worth debating is hilarious to me. Did anyone watch him play last season? I kept rooting for him to do well, but he was just an average (maybe slightly above average) keeper in the EPL. Unfortunately instead of making saves that he shouldn't have made, he made some critical mistakes that he shouldn't have made. Maybe the season was an anomaly. I'm still pulling for him but I'm excited for a few other guys too. But don't let me get in the way of a circle jerk with a well reasoned personal opinion. People incorrectly use the downvote button as a disagree button all the time. Oh well...Reddit gonna reddit"
MLS,3duv12,Stinduh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:41:05 2015 UTC,Single handedly? Like one hand tied behind his back? Or did he score goals for RSL? That's impressive either way.

I can't count all the PK's he has saved in stoppage time to give his team the win instead of a draw.  I don''t watch too many RSL games but the ones I have seen....my jaw has dropped.  Oh and ask any Portland fan on here, I'm sure they'll let you know how much they hate him."
MLS,3duv12,arm0redturkey,2,Mon Jul 20 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"to add to this, he's one of the most intelligent keepers Ive ever seen. He's got cat like reflexes, despite his height he manages to cover upper 90's and because of his height he can drop faster than just about any keeper out there."
MLS,3duv12,DrKill_Joy,6,Mon Jul 20 01:46:03 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the Hamid hype?  Ousted and Rimando are beasts.  Am I just watching the wrong games for DC? Maybe a few off games?  I feel like it's one of those things where a few people on here say he is one of the best, so the rest assume it's true and pass it along, and pretty soon it's basically a fact.  I'm just curious, not trying to start anything. I guess I'm just ignorant on the subject ."

MLS,3duv12,Breklinho,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"None of our current generation of players are good enough   Agreed for the most part, the US is kinda in-between generations but I firmly believe Gonzalez and Besler are MLS guys in their prime (in addition to Bedoya, Johannsson, Brooks etc. already overseas) that could make the jump to a top tier team and start right away. Out of this up-and-coming generation of players though guys like Hamid, Miazga, Lletget and Morris are good enough to head overseas eventually in addition to guys like Hyndman, Zelalem and Rubin playing in Europe already and out of that generation of players I would be disappointed to not see those top players try to play abroad.   and if we keep exporting the best the next won't get better. The return to MLS is debatable for players who are already established, but their return is nothing but a positive for the guys beneath them.   To an extent I think you're right, having leaders and good players training with and teaching youngsters is good for their development but those players also take minutes from youngsters and you run the risk of developing into a league where established senior players never leave and dominate the depth chart and younger guys get left on the fringes as the league gets too big to have young players receive viable first team minutes barring a few early bloomers (i.e. England). Having good players leave can be useful pruning for the MLS tree is what I'm getting at I guess.  Personally I think MLS selling players to teams in top leagues also boosts the image of the league abroad and makes it a more attractive destination for young players like Diaz, Castillo, Melano, Oyongo or going back a bit farther Rossell, Montero and Juninho. If MLS can prove itself as a viable jumping board to a top league domestic talent can be supplemented by some damn good players in the fringes of big teams or that are coming from relatively obscure leagues."

It could be that Szcz has been around forever and has a little more potential long term, and has said he is ok with his position on the team.  Honestly, if you've seen videos of Szcz he seems like he's a 100% Arsenal man. I could see him playing at Arsenal through his career even if most of that time it's as the 2nd choice keeper."

Blind Side was the NFL book about why certain positions (e.g. blind-side tackle) are more valuable to a team than other positions.

MLS,3dw3b1,Bawbx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:32 2015 UTC,"Haha, agreed. The cards had instructions on them for when they were to be used and why, but we also had people roaming around in the sections before the match started telling people about them - and for the most part people were generally excited to get to be a part of it. As simple and cheap as these cards are, they can make a huge visual impact if you get everyone participating. The fact this first attempt was a success gives us hope of doing bigger and more intricate designs in the future."

MLS,3dun96,DoctorDank,92,Sun Jul 19 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"Gather round children, and let Uncle Dank learn you some USMNT history:  So in 1998, the US hosted a Gold Cup, in the winter. Why? Because CONCACAF. Don't ask questions.   Anyway, in this Gold Cup, Brazil were invited to play, as they were several times in that era. Unlike some other editions, they brought their A squad to this one.  There were no Quarterfinals, because there were only 3 groups, so only 4 teams advanced beyond the groups.  The US faced Brazil on a dreary evening at the L.A. Colosseum in front of less than 13,000 people (imagine how many would show for that today?)  This game was all Kasey Keller. He made 13 saves, and Brazil had 30 shots. on goal.  They didn't score.  Keller was so awesome, somebody even wrote a song about it.  Brazilian great Romario later said that Keller's performance was the best he had ever seen of a goalkeeper in his entire life. After the match, Romario said of Keller, ""it was an honor to be on the field with him.""  Preki would tally the lone goal, totally against the run of play, in the second half, an absolute screamer off his left foot.  This same Brazil squad, with the notable addition of Ronaldo, would go on the play in the World Cup Final vs France, where they lost.  The US would go on to lose to Mexico in the Gold Cup final.  I posted this last Gold Cup and it got a fantastic response, but we have had a lot of new people since then. So I hope the mods don't mind me re-posting this.   Edited for typos."

I saw most of the 1996 and 1998 Gold Cup games played at the Coliseum. Back then only the Final sold out ('96 was insane because it was pouring rain). IIRC, Mexico played somebody in '96 at Anaheim Stadium and only like 10k people went. Fun times."

MLS,3dun96,margalolwut,6,Sun Jul 19 17:57:33 2015 UTC,I think it's easy to forget how lucky we were to have Keller and Friedel at the same time. I remember there was a lot of question as to who would play in 2002. I was solidly pro-Keller but then Friedel went and had an amazing tournament.

His goal call was awesome.    Also in the highlights you hear him say after Keller's 100th save, ""Keller paints himself as a hero""  after Keller's 200th save ""Oh no no (as in experssing disbelief) if before we called him a hero now he is Batman.""  Then a few times you hear him say ""goool . . .oh no no this can't be.""  after brazil kept missing or getting denied by keller.  Awesome game glad I got to watch it live!  Also if people are wondering wtf was Brazil doing in the Gold Cup, I believe we used to invite one or two countries to play.   I remember some of the invitees being Colombia and even Japan if memory serves."

I am butchering it im pretty sure but it was awesome.  I know he says that, but not sure when he does.  I am fairly certain it was during that goal, just a little after it cut off in the highlights.  Pretty worth it to hear the whole game.  I also remember he starts praying when brazil was on the attack, or when something dangerous was happening.  haha Jorge Ramos is the shit."

You can usually find him on Friday nights commenting liga mx on ESPN Deportes TV. He will also comment the champions league on ESPN Deportes Radio.  Other games will depend on the nature (he usually does the important games) as they have a plentiful staff of commentators.

Glad Univision brought in TDN to humble them, it got to the point where I had to mute my TV.

MLS,3dun96,thanksbastards,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I feel they try to hard; they often also nit pick at ONE thing throughout the game that almost has NO BEARING on the game, or is un-impactful. A good example was yesterday (was watching with friends so I had very little choice but to watch the game via Univision) when they beat the ""Herrera isn't having a good game"" dead horse, but Herrera actually had a very respectable game (in my opinion).. I often find that their analysis has an impact on people's opinion.   Jesus Ramirez is the worst too, he tries SOOOOOOOOO hard to make a joke sometimes it just gets awkward for me. Bracamontes has toned it down a bit and offers some ok insight every now and then. Again - TDN dropping the hammer on them has actually helped.  In his day (not sure why he sucks now), andres cantor was the man.  My all time fav is Jorge ramos though... the guys over at ESPN (English) aren't half bad either."
MLS,3dun96,ChurchillDownz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:18 2015 UTC,Might be that your're upset that he was talking against you're national team.    Can you cite some example where he was terrible in a game in which you were impartial to either team?
MLS,3dun96,Hellaaaa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"what?   Doesn't make any sense.   I think they beat up an irrelevant dead horse (that's my point).

By getting a high profile team like Brazil it would have served as a way to draw a crowd.  If they had the tournament in '99 or another odd year they probably wouldn't have shown up due to Copa America, so having it in 1998 on the eve of the World Cup would have been a way to draw some more interest."

MLS,3dvx3h,iatetheplums,2,Mon Jul 20 01:44:24 2015 UTC,I would be upset if no one was added. I agree we are doing awesome as of late but I feel as a team we have no depth. Red Bulls struggle on depth which is why I feel a signing is crucial. And as much as our form is great not signing someone would lead to a disaster in the off season. Especially with Miazga getting the attention he has.
MLS,3dvx3h,mai_Ttag,4,Mon Jul 20 11:04:42 2015 UTC,Joel Campbell just wrecked the Mexican defense and they were only saved by Ochoa. Holy shit.

MLS,3dvx3h,jaxx2009,2,Mon Jul 20 02:20:04 2015 UTC,I don't think that was a penalty but if it was it's gotta be a red card too right?
MLS,3dvx3h,dubron,2,Mon Jul 20 02:23:44 2015 UTC,Come onnnnn Panama. I love watching Mexico but they did not deserve to win the game like that. What an awful decision. I just can't stand floppers getting rewarded. I just can't stand it.
MLS,3dvx3h,gaberdine,3,Mon Jul 20 02:24:59 2015 UTC,At least it looks like the stage is set for a good old fashioned Dos a Cero assuming neither team shits the bed in the semis.
MLS,3dvx3h,IshAP29,4,Mon Jul 20 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"the term ""shits the bed"" shouldn't make me snicker as much as it does"
MLS,3dvx3h,gaberdine,4,Mon Jul 20 02:31:29 2015 UTC,It's so apt for what it describes! I read an article on ESPN once where they mentioned that a team 'wet the bed' and it didn't work nearly as well.

MLS,3dvx3h,mjconns,6,Mon Jul 20 04:02:41 2015 UTC,"I think I want Costa Rica to win. USA vs. Mexico would be a classic final, but I want to see someone else in the final, too. I'd rather that be us + not Mexico, and at this point I'd rather USA vs. Costa Rica."
MLS,3dvx3h,nisuarez99,6,Mon Jul 20 01:00:10 2015 UTC,"I feel truly ashamed to be Mexican right now. Not the first time ""we"" did that either. Costa Rica deserved so much more than that."
MLS,3dvx3h,StumbleBees,4,Mon Jul 20 02:31:49 2015 UTC,Is the ref Mecican?  It  wasn't Mexico's fault that the ref is a shitbag.
MLS,3dvx3h,Hellaaaa,7,Mon Jul 20 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"THIS. I'm Mexican, but not ashamed at all. I didn't call that shit call the ref did."
MLS,3dvx3h,nisuarez99,3,Mon Jul 20 02:36:24 2015 UTC,"No the ref wasn't Mexican, but if you don't feel ashamed supporting a team that continuously searches for penalties when they can't find a way to win be my guest but I will not any longer."

MLS,3dvx3h,white_lightning,3,Mon Jul 20 01:26:10 2015 UTC,That... is not how that should have ended. I was rooting for you Ticos...
MLS,3dvx3h,phje,3,Mon Jul 20 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"Not surprising, it is Concacaf afterall."
MLS,3dvx3h,Orgcore,3,Mon Jul 20 02:24:00 2015 UTC,"As an Atlantan and AUFC fan, I'm borderline okay with Mexico winning because now we will look good selling out an otherwise sparsely attended Gold Cup SF bill.   Edit: it's sold out but nobody would have gone if Mexico had gotten bounced."
MLS,3dvx3h,Trollsauce27,3,Mon Jul 20 02:32:02 2015 UTC,Fuck mexico.
MLS,3dvx3h,ElReyAlfonsoX,4,Mon Jul 20 02:22:26 2015 UTC,"I think the penalty was justifiable, but not the correct call given the way the rest of the game was called. Joel Campbell was called for simulation in a nearly identical situation earlier in the game. Both Peralta and Campbell had minor contact on their legs but the ref called each completely differently. Thats my issue with the call."
MLS,3dvx3h,mikesicle,3,Mon Jul 20 02:37:55 2015 UTC,Nothing like getting banned from /r/soccer for calling the mexicans a bunch of cheaters.
MLS,3dvx3h,prefieroelfutbol,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:53 2015 UTC,you seriously think that was rigged? that was just shit officiating
MLS,3dvx3h,Zaratthustra,3,Mon Jul 20 03:50:32 2015 UTC,"calling a country garbagge, and telling mexican  dirty shitty fucks usually does the trick. If you realize that the mistake of the ref is not the mistake of the mexicans."
MLS,3dvx3h,mikesicle,0,Mon Jul 20 06:54:42 2015 UTC,I wasnt trying to be hardcore.
MLS,3dvx3h,SphincterKing,2,Mon Jul 20 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah yeah yeah. Celebrate your dirty victory, Mexico. You cheating scumbags."
MLS,3dvx3h,Hellaaaa,5,Mon Jul 20 02:42:34 2015 UTC,It's the fan's fault the ref called that? Makes sense.

MLS,3dvx3h,kaicyr21,3,Sun Jul 19 23:58:35 2015 UTC,Definitely prefer Costa Rica. They've been really sloppy in the final third. Only a great save from their GK is keeping the game tied.

MLS,3dwsd0,acleansheet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:27 2015 UTC,"The Pan Am games have been the year before the summer Olympics since 1951.  Due to the timing, Canada's team is largely developmental (and the US isnt even participating) but Brazil included 9 of their regular starters from the WC.  It's also the reason why Toronto was not a host city for the WC."
MLS,3dv0em,soccamaniac147,37,Sun Jul 19 19:10:11 2015 UTC,keep working to this

MLS,3dv0em,lolrealism,42,Mon Jul 20 17:05:48 2015 UTC,Let me state again: you guys are the MLS kings of tifo. Hoping we can one day learn from this and make some good tifo ourselves.
MLS,3dv0em,Atlanta-Avenger,-25,Sun Jul 19 19:17:08 2015 UTC,I know a certain group of fans who'd like to have a word.
MLS,3dv0em,revsfan,50,Sun Jul 19 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"IDK, I kind of like what we do here  I would say we are kings  But it's cool, I'll drink to your nice attempt at Sounders tifo  Some may say, we all live in a wonderland up here in Portland"
MLS,3dv0em,Ragnar_Targaryen,32,Sun Jul 19 22:18:21 2015 UTC,And we're done here.
MLS,3dv0em,BowlofSpaghetti,22,Sun Jul 19 23:52:26 2015 UTC,I think you left out the best one TA has done.  Away. Simple. But man is it my favorite one.
MLS,3dv0em,Newbman,9,Mon Jul 20 00:45:34 2015 UTC,One of my favorites as well - I'm under the yellow tree (rough game)
MLS,3dv0em,danhig,5,Mon Jul 20 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"I was down in front for that one, drunk off my ass, yelling and screaming. I didn't even realize we had tifo until I looked at my phone the next morning."
MLS,3dv0em,StrongLikeBull503,3,Mon Jul 20 08:55:14 2015 UTC,"No link because mobile so fml, but the tifo with the color palette changed Orko with the ""We believe in you. This magic is real"" is absolutely my favorite tifo."
MLS,3dv0em,ButtRubbinz,14,Mon Jul 20 14:05:32 2015 UTC,"The ""Timbers Wonderland"" tifo is really brilliant. There are so many different components to it if you look closely."
MLS,3dv0em,Rempelrez,8,Mon Jul 20 00:26:02 2015 UTC,The video of it is even more impressive.
MLS,3dv0em,Goose511th,7,Mon Jul 20 00:37:32 2015 UTC,That was awesome.  I love MLS supporters.

MLS,3dv0em,corylew,6,Mon Jul 20 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"Disingenuous man, you know that wasn't ECS"
MLS,3dv0em,WonderboyYYZ,11,Mon Jul 20 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"Totally different.    Well, actually, it is. I mean, that would be akin to someone on the south end putting something up. It's not the TA."
MLS,3dv0em,Proteus010,-6,Mon Jul 20 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"We don't have little supporters clubs. North end is TA. South end is TA. Texas is TA. If we were handed a tifo from a corporation and told to hold it up, granted we probably would do it just because it's there, but damn there would be a lot of cringing. The fact that nobody at CenturyLink bat an eye says something about the commercialism of your support."
MLS,3dv0em,corylew,15,Mon Jul 20 02:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'm all for ragging on Seattle any chance we get, but you're not making sense man..."
MLS,3dv0em,Proteus010,6,Mon Jul 20 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"It's a bit much to think nobody batted an eye over that.  If there's one thing the ECS likes to make clear lately, it's that they're not for sale.  As far as that display, I'd say a pretty large number of us find it just as cringeworthy."
MLS,3dv0em,lagasan,3,Mon Jul 20 03:37:16 2015 UTC,"Oh god, get off your high horse.   For all we know these fans are just random people and were asked to do this when they walked into the stadium.    The fact that nobody at CenturyLink bat an eye says something   Stop just saying stuff that you make up like it's a fact."
MLS,3dv0em,LiquidBionix,3,Mon Jul 20 04:54:46 2015 UTC,"For all we know these fans are just random people   Don't you get it though? The Portland Timbers don't have ""random fans,"" each and every one of them has been supporting the team since the moment they were born and came home swaddled in Green and Gold. By the age of five, most young Portlandians have gotten permission from their parents to get a rose tattoo'd behind their ear or over their heart. The Timbers are such an integral part of Portland's history and culture that Axe Handling Skills 101 is a required course in any high school within city limits (mostly to prepare you to look good posing tough against a white background, as every Portlandian dreams of one day being one of the featured fans on the outside of Providence Park).   To suggest that most of the people who go to Timbers matches and watch them on TV are, in fact, just like most every other American fan of any other American sports team is anathema to everything Timbers fans know about themselves. It's not like their attendance doubled once they joined the big league and would have gone even higher if they had the room, cause that would mean they would have to face the fact that a huge portion of the fans that come to Timbers matches are exactly the same people as the ""lazy"" moms and kids and families that make up the rest of the general attendance at Sounders matches, and don't really give as much of a shit as they automatically get credit for just by wearing a ""No Pity"" scarf. Clink just has more seats for them.  The TA tifos are pretty much the best around, but when Timbers fans start swerving into this attitude that each and every Portland fan really is just that much more grassroots and authentic I gotta roll my eyes. Seattle and Portland aren't that different, no matter how hard they try and define themselves in ways that they are ""not Seattle,"" and the randos filling in the seats that aren't TA or ECS are the same damn people.   I lived in Portland before MLS came there or Seattle, and people barely gave a shit then. The plastics there are the same as the plastics anywhere."
MLS,3dv0em,Ygg999,7,Mon Jul 20 21:28:40 2015 UTC,Considering that tifo was displayed during a friendly and that same company helped pay for the Make-A-Wish Foundation wish. Yeah it is totally different.
MLS,3dv0em,Newbman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"Wait, a massive company at one point made a contribution to a very popular charity? Seriously these defenses are weaker than... Well, ask Colorado."
MLS,3dv0em,corylew,7,Mon Jul 20 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"If some Timbers fans in a different part of the stadium held up a Tifo with ""Nagbe is in the Game"" or whomever. I wouldn't try to imply that the TA had something to do with it. Nor would I try to associate that event with all the fans of a fanbase.   It's a friendly. And the sole purpose of a friendly is to be an advertisement. Every single FO would have done the same thing."
MLS,3dv0em,Newbman,7,Mon Jul 20 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"If I'm in the TA section and a tifo banner comes my way, I'm probably going to hold it up without knowing what's on it because I trust that it's good. I didn't organize it, I can only assume that the people who did put a lot of work into it.   If there were a ""Nagbe is in the game"" tifo that was organized by anyone with an EA Sports logo on it and I somehow held it up, I'd be pissed. That's not a comment on authenticity or anything, but I don't want my fandom slapped with a corporate sponsor. I already put up with naming rights on kits, stadium, every visible surface of the stadium, I don't want it to be on something I literally support."
MLS,3dv0em,ReallyHender,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't like holding up the tifo either. If I was a season ticket holder I would bring it up to the Alliance and my rep but I'm not. Hopefully I can be 2 years from now.   The TA and ECS have a vigilant leadership,  there is no way these organizations get caught holding up something that they didn't make."

MLS,3dv0em,Newbman,0,Mon Jul 20 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"Nope, those fans sit in the upper and opposite section from the TIFO side, the family section which will hold almost anything up if it's given to them for free, and it's got their team's colors and national idol on it.

MLS,3dv0em,hungrycl,9,Mon Jul 20 01:28:42 2015 UTC,Quick question.  Does the TA pay for their own TIFOs?  Do you have corporate sponsorship to help out with those?  How many people are typically involved in making them?
MLS,3dv0em,Just_Chillaxin,14,Mon Jul 20 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"The closest the TA gets to corporate involvement is that they have to notify the stadium when they will be doing a tifo. The Timbers front office has no editorial control over the content, but they could deny use of facilities if they so desired, i.e. the pulley system mounted on the overhang."

MLS,3du2l5,socialistbob,63,Sun Jul 19 14:37:00 2015 UTC,"As long as the league doesn't keep adding spots for super marquee players that only the more major markets can take advantage of, teams like those you mentioned can thrive.  I fear that it's going too far the other way and that we're going the way of EPL in terms of a few dominating teams and everyone else fighting for table scraps, but I hope I'm wrong.  If you don't want to read a rant, stop here :)  I mean how can SKC have to break up one of the best center back tandems in the league because they're up against the cap while LA can sign one dude a few months later that costs as much as SKC's entire team without having to make a single cost saving move on what was essentially a free transfer to them because of league intervention while that same league claims that they value parity?  It's particularly frustrating because SKC has gone after every one of these big names with just as big an offer so it's not like they haven't tried.  And I can't fault a player for wanting a certain lifestyle that KC can't offer in terms of proximity to family or coastline or climate or whatever but things like the DP rule and Allocation order and even the first iteration of this core player retention funds thing were supposedly designed to promote parity while still allowing top talent into the league but those rules get changed every time a big name player wants to pick where he plays.  And I get it, either let them pick or they go to another league, but still, don't claim to value parity and then be complicit against it.  End rant."

With that said, how do propose they add shade to the east side? The only logical idea I have is to add a second level. Great idea, except we can't even sell out this one level stadium. Sorry for the rant, but this ""issue"" is always brought up to Dan Hunt, especially in his Facebook Chats, and its the most annoying thing to see because there is no way more shade will be added to this stadium. Too much money will be wasted without any real return."

Ideally, the stadium would need to be taller and at a steeper angle with shade on the West side coming out and up from the stands a bit.  As it is, a significant shade on the West side would help quite a bit.  I would love to have completely covered seating, but yes, it would be expensive.  Really and truly, I wish they would sell the stadium to Frisco and build in Dallas with shade/atmosphere/proximity to urban core in mind."

Its ruining the growth of the sport from every direction except the pockets of the current owners.  LA/Seattle pay the bills for pretty much every other owner in the league so they are allowed to get away with more. League management will never admit that obviously but looking at the known financials, its pretty easy to see.  Grew up in the sport, Dad played pro in the states back when having a kid meant you had to quit being a pro soccer player. So glad to see how far we have come from having 1 team in NY basically being the Harlem Globetrotters to where we are now, but the MLS does nothing for growing the actual sport as a whole and I have a problem with that."

Yes it's single entity, yes teams have own means to ensure success  and control their fates in that manner; however, so far the league only intervenes and adjusts rules on the fly to help big market teams and only big market teams."

MLS,3du2l5,TheyCallMeBallin,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:19:14 2015 UTC,Doesn't have to be a superstar. It just has to be a DP caliber player. Take the lowest paid DP and buy down his salary to make him not one.
MLS,3du2l5,Chralemar,15,Sun Jul 19 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point.  That rule was announced right when LA was about to close GDS and it gave them the ability to do so when they otherwise couldn't.  When SKC brought Espinoza back they had to buy him down with good ole fashioned allocation money they got from dealing players and they still ended up having to get rid of guys for cap space.  In other words, Sporting had to operate within existing rules while LA got new rules and help from the league with transfer fees."
MLS,3du2l5,ThisIsMyNewUserID,-3,Sun Jul 19 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"You are missing the point. The rule is for everyone. The DP rule was made for LA when they acquired David Beckham, hence the nickname the ""Beckham Rule"". Every single team now has DPs and no one is complaining about that. If you don't like the rules made initially for LA then let's just roll back the DP rule and send back all the DPs to Europe and South America because they won't fit in the salary budget. That won't happen because the DP rule has been good for the league.  You can call this new rule the ""Gonzalez/Dos Santos Rule"" if you want, but it will eventually be utilized by every team. Is it LA's fault that they are the team that has to constantly has to push the league into being more ambitious? Sorry, the league will not change the rules because Espinoza is coming to town. They will change it when a player that can be pivotal in the next stage of MLS wants to come over (also, LA has been pursing Dos Santos for years so it wasn't out of the blue). When Beckham came over, it opened the flood gates and moved the league into it's new stage. Now, Dos Santos is coming. He's not as good, but as popular especially among the Latino population and a humongous portion of MLS's popularity stems from them. This signing will inevitably open a new door that will start propelling the league into another level. Signing Espinoza wasn't going to do that. I'm sure if SKC were actually having serious conversations with Dos Santos or another player with similar popularity with all signs pointing to him signing a contract, I'm pretty damn sure Garber will make an exception and change the rules for SKC. Not because SKC is a special snowflake, but because Dos Santos is.  You just don't turn down Dos Santos if he's serious in signing. He could of signed with San Jose, Dallas or Chicago (all of them have 3 DPs) and the rule will still would of been made, but he chose LA and not any other team, get over it.  Edit: Also, TAM money is free to every team and any team who doesn't want can trade for it. Meaning they are getting a player or draft pick or international roster slot or etc practically for free. LA had to get rid of Ishizaki and an international roster slot to even be able to keep Gonzalez to sign Dos Santos. That's more of a testament of how LA is run because they were willing to do A LOT to keep a CB, Gonzalez. What other team would of done that?"
MLS,3du2l5,Chralemar,5,Sun Jul 19 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"Uhh sporting was having serious talks with Dos Santos, they tried to sign him but he picked the Cali weather over Missouri weather, which is understandable.  You LA fans really are arrogant though. The fact that you're getting pissed off in this situation is beyond me. You've had Landon Donovan, David Beckham, Robbie Keane- all 3 are arguably the best their respected Countries have ever seen. Except maybe Steven Gerrard could be thought of as the better Englishman. Oh wait, you all get him too and now you get the best current Mexican player.   Quit your god damn bitching already."

MLS,3du2l5,RubiksSugarCube,2,Sun Jul 19 21:38:05 2015 UTC,SKC is by no means a poor team.  The money guy is the CEO of one of the biggest medical technology companies in the country and is loaded.  They've gone after these same guys and the league never did anything to help them come up with better offers or find ways to get around rules designed to protect parity.
MLS,3du2l5,ThisIsMyNewUserID,3,Sun Jul 19 23:03:11 2015 UTC,Because those players did not want to sign with SKC.
MLS,3du2l5,Chralemar,-3,Sun Jul 19 23:12:08 2015 UTC,"Completely off subject it's ""could have"" not ""could of."" You look like a fool when you say it wrong.  On subject, KC made offers to RVDV, Marko Marin, Bradley, and Dos Santos.  They were smaller offers because the transfer fees were ridiculously high and the league had no interest whatsoever in stepping in.  By the time they figured that they'd cover the fees, they had 3 DPs so they had to back off.  The league still had no interest whatsoever in stepping in.  They stopped pursuing new contracts for guys like Collin because they had three DPs and the league wouldn't change the rules for them.  Yes, everyone benefits from the rule changes, but again those didn't come about until LA or Seattle or Toronto needed them.  So good or bad rules, their introduction only when certain teams need them is BS."
MLS,3du2l5,ThisIsMyNewUserID,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"But none of those players would even make the decision to come to SKC. Pretty sure all deals fell through because all offers were rejected by the players as well since better offers were made. So, why would the league step in if the players didn't even want to go to SKC? Making an offer is different from actually being close to signing a player. I'm sure LA has made offers to Ronaldinho in the past, but LA fans are whining that he didn't take the offer. Same with Lampard. In the end, both Bradley and Dos Santos received better offers who were willing to pay the necessary fee and salary.  Remember, signing a player is like an auction, you don't give up when someone offers a better deal, you have give a counter offer that's even better. SKC didn't do that. Don't cry because SKC's FO isn't as effective as TFC's and LA's.  And sorry my English sucks. Non-native speaker here. Also, how could I look like a fool when you can't even see me? shitty joke. Someone should learn not to throw stones from glass houses."
MLS,3du2l5,Chralemar,2,Sun Jul 19 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"KC had to make smaller offers because transfer fees were huge and the league doesn't offer to help until LA, Seattle, or Toronto are in the equation.

Toronto can't buy down any of their three DPs because they all make too much, so they can't be ready to take advantage of the rule. Where do people get this stuff?  Other teams that have been mentioned as possibly using the rule are Chicago (buying down Kennedy), Orlando City (buying down Rochez or Rivas), San Jose (Wondo), and maybe Seattle (Alonso)..."

MLS,3du2l5,Chralemar,3,Sun Jul 19 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"But Toronto already had to dump Gilberto to get down to three DPs. The three with the team (Giovinco, Bradley, Altidore), cannot be bought down to sub-DP levels because they make too much. And Gilberto isn't being bought down so he can come back as a non-DP.

MLS,3du2l5,xbhaskarx,4,Sun Jul 19 18:44:45 2015 UTC,LA had 3 DPs and LA wanted to bring in Dos Santos and they did so by buying down Gonzalez's salary.  TFC has 3 DPs and if they want to bring back Gilberto then they will need to buy down his salary to no longer be a DP.  Gilberto will no longer be  a DP and will still make the same amount due to new rules like Gonzalez.  Edit: This is a hypothetical scenario.

Gilberto only makes $1.145 million while Gonzalez makes $1.25 million and LA managed to buy down his salary under DP level. TFC also has ambitious owners and LA's previous CEO, Tim Leiweke (the guy who brought over Beckham and Keane). Don't treat TFC as a small market team because they aren't."

MLS,3du2l5,xbhaskarx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it will happen, I'm saying that it can happen and that many teams which includes TFC can take advantage of this new rule instead of crying foul.  Also, If LA can buy down Omar's salary (which is larger than Gilberto's), then TFC would be able to so if Tim Leiweke is still ambitious man that he is (he brought Beckham and Keane to LA and Bradley, Giovinco, Altidore and Gilberto to TFC)."
MLS,3du2l5,Chralemar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:22:35 2015 UTC,"Bringing Gilberto back doesn't make sense. We don't have problems scoring anymore, just mid and defensive issues."
MLS,3du2l5,quelar,2,Sun Jul 19 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm saying TFC won't use allocation to buy down Gilberto to sub-DP levels. I don't think he's coming back to MLS."
MLS,3du2l5,xbhaskarx,2,Sun Jul 19 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"Bringing Giovani doesn't make sense since LA is doing fine now, but the more the merrier.  June 20 marked the second half of the season against the Union, the better half of LA's season (like several past seasons under Bruce). LA has scored 20 goals in the past 5 league games. That's averaging 4 goals per game. LA still signed Giovani Dos Santos. Don't hold yourself back. Let me repeat the end of my first sentence: the more the merrier."
MLS,3du2l5,Chralemar,2,Sun Jul 19 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it's important to note that even though the Gio signing was the catalyst for actually announcing the rule change, it's pretty clear that everyone in the league already knew this was coming. Portland didn't pick up the phone and start negotiating with Melano last week; this would have been something they were working on for a while because they knew that the 'targeted allocation' rule was going to go into effect during this transfer window.   I think the MLS screwed up in the way they did roll out the rule, but it's a bit disingenuous to act like the Galaxy are the only ones benefitting."
MLS,3du2l5,SalvadorsDeli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:45:11 2015 UTC,Portland has also already used the new rule.
MLS,3du2l5,Alar1k,26,Sun Jul 19 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"These teams are built to play smart without big name talent.   Built to play smart and using big name talent isn't mutually exclusive though. Many people put building through the academy and paying for quality players against each other. While I love my FC Dallas and what they've accomplished there are still plenty of spots that could be aided by a quality signing (why settle for underrated? I want my team to be the best it can be). A quality lone striker to replace Perez (Texeira is getting better, but I'm not quite sold on him yet) comes to mind. The Barcelonas of the world build their own and grab the best. FC Dallas can do that (if the FO was willing), allbeit at a much smaller level. ""Playing your kids"" is also a phrase often used, but let's not use that as a panacea solution. FC Dallas has checked that box (unlike many other teams in the league), but we fall short in other areas of investment.   To me FC Dallas is proof that parity still exists and small budget teams can compete with big budget teams.   FC Dallas' success isn't proof parity still exists. True parity doesn't exist in MLS evidenced by the gap in spending between the teams. MLS' spending rules keep it closer than it might be without them, but its far from an equal playing field. Whether its a FO's fault for not keeping up or the various Galaxy rules over the years is besides the point. Understand, I'm not upset about this (not trying to make a moral argument about parity), its just the way it is.   FC Dallas' success is a sign that despite not spending up to the max you can have measured success. Its similar to how moneyball teams in the MLB win championships. No one would claim there is parity in baseball. Like you've mentioned, our success is chalked up to good coaching, smart signings and academies. These have all been done with more limitations (read: less money/playing in Frisco/under attended games) placed on the technical director. He is skilled at what he does, but he has less to work with than the Galaxy's technical director.  While we are having success now (and I'm ectatic about it!) I'm afraid we won't keep up when teams who don't have their hands tied will edge us out over time (the next 10-15 years)."
MLS,3du2l5,Lil_Tyrese,7,Sun Jul 19 16:09:32 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with your statement about parity. Just as FC Dallas doesn't prove that parity exists, neither does the Galaxy's success prove that it doesn't.   In MLS, there is a disparity of spending but that disparity is not reflected in performance. Wages generally have little-to-no correlation to success.   This year is even more extreme with newcomers NYCFCFC tipping things towards spending a lot for not much success, but in the link you can see the trend holds up over time.   The Galaxy owe as much to consistent coaching and academy contributions as they do to DP rules and exemptions."
MLS,3du2l5,DerbyTho,11,Sun Jul 19 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, the Galaxy have a couple great academy players and Bruce is a great coach. Bruce does like his Vets though."
MLS,3du2l5,Increasenull,6,Sun Jul 19 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"Good points, but I think we're talking past each other a bit. I'm saying parity just doesn't exist in MLS b/c of the numbers. True parity means each team would have $15M to work with and that's it. MLS on the parity spectrum is pretty far from that, but not as far as other soccer/professional sports leagues. Again, I'm not opposed to the current system, but its helpful to call it what it is. You're right though, the success of the Galaxy doesn't prove parity doesn't exist, the numbers prove it.  I'm also saying despite parity not existing, teams like FC Dallas can succeed. Can they succeed over time in an ever more rich man's league is the real question. Can FC Dallas create dynasties with their current model like the Galaxy have? Only time will tell (but I'm skeptical)."
MLS,3du2l5,Lil_Tyrese,2,Sun Jul 19 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Thanks for clarifying.   I think you are right a bit that the league is moving towards giving more money to the team's that can spend it, which will hurt performance parity as time goes on.   Paradoxically though, I think the DP system is why we see huge spending not work. You can spend double or triple what other teams do, but only on 3 or 4 players. That's a huge risk for a game and a league where solid depth has a greater impact on results (citation needed).  One of the interesting proposals I saw recently was to let teams use empty DP slots to lower the cost of as many players' cap hits as they like, up to the player max. Basically, to use it like the NBA mid-level exemption. That way teams that don't want or can't spend $5m a year on a guy like Kaka  could still compete by spending more, just in a different way."
MLS,3du2l5,DerbyTho,2,Sun Jul 19 17:21:47 2015 UTC,All good points!
MLS,3du2l5,Lil_Tyrese,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"While spending doesn't create much of a correlation when looking at PPG, there is a significant trend when looking at trophies won.  Looking at the MLS Cup, Supporter's Shield, and Open Cup winners between 2010 and 2014, 60% were top 5 in payroll that year. Smart, consistent roster building is a great way to pave a way to the playoffs year after year, but I think the impact of veteran leadership in those last few games is immeasurable."
MLS,3du2l5,iced1776,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"So one of the top 5 spending teams only wins a trophy about half of the time? I don't think the numbers are proving your point, even assuming that 60 data points is enough to prove significance."
MLS,3du2l5,DerbyTho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure how it adds up in an actual statistical model, I'm making a pretty loose connection but the top 25% of teams by wages winning 60% of all available trophies suggests that there's at least some correlation. If there truly was none, wouldn't the top 25% only win 25% of the trophies?"
MLS,3du2l5,iced1776,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a day late, but my explanation would be that wages in some cases correlates with the actual difference-making decisions. That is, Seattle and LA spend a lot and put lots of effort into their academy, give their coaching staff time to implement ideas, and bid on hosting Open Cup games.   That is to say a good coaching staff and good academy can do better than bringing in big money DPs, which is basically the bet RBNY are making, so perhaps what I am saying is wishful thinking."
MLS,3du2l5,DerbyTho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:16 2015 UTC,Do you know what the cost breakdown is for investing heavily in a homegrown talent vs buying a team?
MLS,3du2l5,COLLINRUDOLPH,3,Sun Jul 19 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"Do you mean, how much does it cost to create/sustain an academy? No, I don't, but would love to know! It would be fascinating to look at academy investment by line item (coaching, high schools, travel, equipment, etc.). It would definitely give us a better picture for how much a team is ""investing"" and could ease the fears of fans like me who see the main motivations behind building academies as low-cost investments."
MLS,3du2l5,Lil_Tyrese,-6,Sun Jul 19 16:37:47 2015 UTC,Academies are built on the checkbooks of thousands of parents of youth players paying club and coaching fees for the privilege of slapping a senior club patch and a grocery store chain sponsor logo on their kids' kits.
MLS,3du2l5,littledogelaughed,6,Sun Jul 19 17:45:06 2015 UTC,"Woah, that got cynical quick.  Are all MLS club academies pay-to-play? I was under the assumption that some paid for all travel, equipement, etc. Aren't there even some that have high schools for kids to attend free of charge?"
MLS,3du2l5,Lil_Tyrese,7,Sun Jul 19 17:49:04 2015 UTC,My understanding is that MLS has gotten rid of pay-to-play in its academies.
MLS,3du2l5,TheBored23,3,Sun Jul 19 19:38:08 2015 UTC,"For Dallas it's pay-to-play until U16. Up until then it's $2,500 per year.  I'm hoping it changes by the time my son wants to play for them. If he sticks with soccer."
MLS,3du2l5,lg_3000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! Yeah, hopefully they'll get to the point where academies are worth the full investment (making enough homegrown stars) to make them free to play."

Having a strong academy, producing homegrowns and having a great coach/tactics wins way more games.  the big names/designated players in the league are there to sell tickets not win games. Which reads funny as those things should be correlated but arnt for the most part in this league.  your post is spot on by the way."

Sometimes I think he tries to do too much but his skill is so high that many times it works out for us.   Mauro is good but now with Adrian coming I think we'll see even better play in the midfield. Not to mention we will be keeping Mauro happy bringing in his countryman.   Bottom line is Oscar is getting the most out of what he has on the team and it's paying off. Typically we'd be blowing games around July but so far so good. Now we just need to learn how to keep winning in the dog days of summer in N. Texas."
MLS,3du2l5,Increasenull,16,Sun Jul 19 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"Oscar is really the key to our success in my opinion.   Also Ascosta has a wicked long range shot. If he learns to keep a down a little more, he could be our own mini Frank Lampard."

MLS,3du2l5,LocksTheFox,0,Mon Jul 20 19:37:44 2015 UTC,or as an assistant. I feel the same way about Curtin.
MLS,3du2l5,Increasenull,28,Mon Jul 20 19:38:58 2015 UTC,I mostly lurk but...  You are right Castillo is the best left winger in the MLS. I would say that he became a A list talent but wasn't when we bought him. Diaz is excellent and I swear he is the second most fouled player in the MLS. That doesn't happen unless you are very very dangerous.  I'm of the opinion that both of these things basically come down to Oscar Pareja being a top 3 coach in the league.  Oh and our payroll is low because we have homegrowns who can start. Uolla(23)/Ascosta(20) started in midfield last night. Dallas had their u16 team win the national championship last night. (I don't know if this was just for MLS teams or what. They announced it at the stadium.)
MLS,3du2l5,Buckeyesmt,7,Sun Jul 19 14:44:40 2015 UTC,I think we have the most homegrowns on the senior roster
MLS,3du2l5,time2rave,5,Sun Jul 19 15:49:54 2015 UTC,"do you guys have the most HG starter minutes in the league? Hernandez, Acosta and Ulloa are real quality I hope my Fire can emulate that. Zendejas looks to be the next in line to start down the road. We are the 3rd biggest market but have an owner that has made us a small market team cheap jerk."
MLS,3du2l5,littledogelaughed,4,Sun Jul 19 16:55:52 2015 UTC,Maybe there should be a shield for the team with the most HG minutes in the league.
MLS,3du2l5,irishbball49,6,Sun Jul 19 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe we should promote the best HG players by including them in our marquee ""All Star Game""."
MLS,3du2l5,jdh0625,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you define it.  The Revs have handed the most minutes to HGP players, but that includes two players who came from different academies (Agudelo and Dallas' own Woodberry).  If you measure it by production of a team's academy wherever the players are now, Dallas leads by a fair margin over the Red Bulls at #2."
MLS,3du2l5,durbin1898,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:01 2015 UTC,Interestingly  enough Ulloa leads the team in minutes  played  going back to last season at just over 1000. Not sure of the exact number
MLS,3du2l5,take_a_bow_son,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"By my list you're tied with Vancouver (though London Woodberry is playing with NE). (My list for reference)  I would say they have played the most though. New York has Miazga as a consistent starter with Lade and Davis getting time. LA and Salt Lake HG's are both getting some decent time, but I'd say the award for actually playing your kids goes to Dallas."

Fabian is explosive and just unplayable for outside backs when he's on his game. Mauro is our creative magic man and as Long as he's healthy, the midfield engine runs smoothly. hedges is a staunch defender who commands the back line beautifully, hence the shut outs this season. Aside from those big two names, I especially look at Hollingshead who has stepped in a number of positions and had success despite injuries to other players. Acosta has been coming to life recently too. homegrown talent is important.  The key to the team is Oscar. Sure our payroll is low (lowest in the league according to a post yesterday), but the chemistry and focusing on academy talent has bolstered us in the league. It's good when it's good but I hope management starts to spend a little bit more because if the well dries up, we're going to be back to the old times."
MLS,3du2l5,Jimla,4,Sun Jul 19 15:29:19 2015 UTC,Hollingshead was excellent last night. He was constantly right in the action and made some great moves. Tesho also looked good during the few minutes he played. He came in and made an impact right away.
MLS,3du2l5,parsac58,7,Sun Jul 19 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"I would add that since Zach Lloyd's two yellow card performance against San Jose, he has been really solid at CB alongside Hedges. Michel Barrios has come in and proven to be a handful on the flank opposite Castillo.   I think the biggest difference since our traditional, but abbreviated, midseason slump is that Ulloa has really come into his own over the last four or so games. He is not giving the ball away cheaply and is making runs forward at really good moment.   I am excited to see Zendejas continue to get minutes and to see what Ezequiel Cigliano will have to offer going forward."
MLS,3du2l5,FreethinkingMFT,14,Sun Jul 19 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"I am admittedly a new fan, but from what I have seen FCD invests heavily in developing talent as opposed to purchasing it.

When the MLS talks about its parity and anything can happen layout, it's really talking about the West. Dallas is on top this week because SOMEONE needs to be on top.  I hope people understand what I'm trying to say. Just look at the top few teams in the West right now, they are all within a game of each other. First place is going to change at any time.

One of the things that nobody has mentioned, and I can't get away from is that one major difference is the lack of Blas Perez. They're on a 4 game winning streak without him. We've seen far less flopping and arguing from the team as a whole. The guys just seem to put their head down and get on with it, and it has given them some results. As much of a scoring threat as he is I have to wonder if the team might look in a different direction next year, given how well they've done without him."

MLS,3du2l5,dac0605,3,Sun Jul 19 20:11:49 2015 UTC,"I made the trip to Frisco last night for the match.  I don't know if it was because of the heat, our long layoff, or just a bad game, but FC Dallas was on a completely different level than DC.  It should've/could've been 3-1 or 4-1.  Castillo and Diaz looked superb and were so quick with the ball.  We didn't have anybody with that type of speed or agility on the ball.  It was great to watch.  Teixiera looked pretty solid, as did Acosta.  I love DC and how we are able to have a good amount of success with no big international stars or big signings.  But I just feel like we need a dynamic playmaker in the midfield or a great winger to get things going."
MLS,3du2l5,Elguapo361,2,Sun Jul 19 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"Glad to have you in our little stadium! It was a fun game to watch, with a lot of back and forth. That defense you guys have is stout."

MLS,3du2l5,efrumttr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"Because it's July. We haven't hit the point of the season yet where depth begins to really separate teams, and depth is where Dallas is weak. We've seen it before when they lead the league early, back into the playoffs and exit before the conference finals. Same reason Southampton faded in the EPL last season. Injuries and fatigue wear on you over a season, and you have to have quality backups to really be a true contender.   It's not to say that what Dallas has done isn't an achievement in and of itself or that it shouldn't be noticed. Their first team is very, very good. But they'll fade in September/October, because they don't have the depth other teams do."
MLS,3du2l5,Elguapo361,4,Sun Jul 19 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree with what you're saying, but FCD finished strong last season, and only lost to Seattle on away goals after two ties. There's no reason to think they will peter out at the end."
MLS,3du2l5,efrumttr,2,Sun Jul 19 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"They went 4-0-4 in September and October, so not exactly a strong finish. Needed a highly, highly questionable penalty to beat Vancouver at home in the wild card. They were able to defend well against Seattle, but I just don't see losing in the conference semis as finishing strong. Still feels like they need to prove they can put something together at the end of the year."
MLS,3du2l5,Elguapo361,2,Sun Jul 19 22:30:51 2015 UTC,"They weren't steamrolling through people, but they weren't falling apart. They lost in the conference semis, but lost to the rules, not so much on the field.  They were quite strong against a very good Seattle team, and it would not have been unfair had they moved on.  At any rate, its all academic. They need to do better. It remains to be seen if they will be able to or not."

MLS,3duhrz,DonnieNarco,21,Sun Jul 19 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"It's a waste of an appeal.  He obviously came in studs up, it's been pretty clear the league is trying to crack down on that this season.   Yeah, he didn't really make contact, but not for a lack of trying.  It probably should have been a yellow, but since he did go in studs up I don't see how the DisCo is going to opt to overturn it."
MLS,3duhrz,Dean_Moriarty,6,Sun Jul 19 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"It's still pretty soft, but watching it again you can see him shred Kljestan's sock, so he definitely at least grazes him.  And with studs like that, it hurts."

MLS,3duhrz,ftx437,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"I mean seriously, that's what I don't understand, dude literally just stood there looked at Larin realised what was going on and then he goes down when Larin is getting up and starts crying like there's no tomorrow. Did the ref not see that?"
MLS,3duhrz,djveneko,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"Serious question, I get that the rules allow for fouls even when no contact is made, but why do we accept that? It's basically saying ""hey ref, whoever you feel like fucking, go for it, because by rule you can pretty much never be wrong."" It's by necessity inconsistent, and an invitation for bias. I get it IF you contact the player on certain plays you could injure them. But that could be said for dozens of plays in a pretty much any match. Imagine if everytime a goalie punched the ball away they got a red because IF they had contacted a striker the injury could be more severe than a cleat to the shin. The ""he could have hurt someone IF..."" standard is never going to be applied consistently at all so it's basically just a justification for shit officiating. The appeal probably won't be won, but I think straight reds for non-contact are more of an indicator that you rewrote the rules so you can always say whatever you called is right more than anything else."
MLS,3duhrz,Popcornshrimpeater,15,Sun Jul 19 22:54:59 2015 UTC,"but why do we accept that?   Because it makes sense and is required for the safety of the players.  Think of it this way, if a player throws a punch but misses, he should get off without punishment?  Obviously not, that would be absurd.    Same applies for all fouls.  It actually takes away opportunity for bias, if it's a foul, then it's a foul. Regardless if there was contact or not.  This way the ref can focus on just the offending action itself.  Your keeper example doesn't make sense because it is not a foul for a keeper to make contact with other players while punching a ball away. It is a foul to slide tackle someone with your studs up.  Yeah, everyone would love 100% consistent and fair refereeing, but until we have RoboRefs that's not going to happen in any sport.    The benefits of calling it a foul without actual contact far outweighs any perceived negatives of it.  Referee's judgement is needed in soccer, you can't write a rulebook detailed enough to cover every possible situation, shouldn't take away their judgement just because sometimes they might be inconsistent."
MLS,3duhrz,Dean_Moriarty,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is if that goalie punches in a crowd, misses the ball and hits nobody, straight red? Obviously if he punches for the ball and misses it and punches a player that's generally a pk and usually a red. The point is it's a standard that relies on judgment and how the ref feels more than an objective standard of what actually happened. I guess my thought is punishing players for dangerous acts comes up enough naturally in soccer that extending the line to include situations where the actual potential injury is 0 (because it's impossible to move an appendage fast enough to hurt a human without contact) is unnecessary. I get your point though, this is an even more protective measure. I just think it's applied so inconsistently that it becomes an overall negative for the sport. I think that's sort of marginal what's the gain/loss thing though, so I can certainly see how others could see it differently. Thanks for the genuine answer."
MLS,3duhrz,Popcornshrimpeater,4,Sun Jul 19 23:34:03 2015 UTC,"Obviously if he punches for the ball and misses it and punches a player that's generally a pk and usually a red.   Actually not true. If a keeper unintentionally punches the player while going for the ball, it is unlikely that he should earn a red card. A yellow card for being reckless could be merited. Although, it would be an unlikely circumstance for a PK not to be earned, I would have to imagine."
MLS,3duhrz,TheBishop7,3,Mon Jul 20 02:29:36 2015 UTC,"It's funny, because two weeks ago when kak√° stumbled on the ball before ""stomping"" on a player everyone kept saying intentional or not doesn't matter. I've seen goalies get red for it, seen yellow too. The point for my post though was the second bit pointing out that even though it's dangerous, you're probably never going to see that called if contact isn't made. (Not saying it should be.) My point is just that the ""you don't have to make contact for it to be a foul"" is applied so inconsistently that I think it's bad for the sport in general and leads to a lower overall quality of officiating. Though as was pointed out it could be argued it keeps players safer."
MLS,3duhrz,Popcornshrimpeater,4,Mon Jul 20 02:50:33 2015 UTC,"Why not? it was studs up?  Not sure if he even touched the player, but he came in studs up, you can't do that.  Doesn't matter if you do a lot of damage or a little, it's dangerous."
MLS,3duhrz,choch2727,17,Sun Jul 19 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"Here's some GFYs for you:  The full play in realtime (notice that Larin is intercepting the ball, not tackling it away from Kljestan)  Replay One  Replay Two  Really wish I could find a better angle on this one, because it's almost impossible to tell how far away Larin really is when his stud is up. It's almost 100% clear that Larin's boot never touches Kljestan, that the only contact was after Kljestan gets caught up with Larin. Just took a look again, and it looks like Larin makes some contact right here, but Larin's alright got his foot back down by then. I can't issue any judgement on how heavy the contact was, but Kljestan's reaction could've sold that he was shot.      On the other hand, how the hell is this not a red card?"
MLS,3duhrz,zrowny,9,Sun Jul 19 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"you know, it's funny when I first saw the high boot against Collin I was pissed it wasn't a red, but then I thought maybe it wasn't a red cuz Collin put his head really low, and the boot wasn't really that high.

There were worse fouls that were not called at all. And taking Larin out so early was brutal. I want to know how my team plays against the real Orlando City.   I will be at the rematch and hope OC gets a good clear shot so we can see how the two line up for real.   I think the Red Bulls might learn a lot about style from a strong OC match.   Kinda like watching them against those brutally fast turnovers from the white caps.

MLS,3duhrz,ftx437,6,Sun Jul 19 22:33:56 2015 UTC,Doesn't need to be contact. The commentators are crap. I don't think it was a red personally but I can see why it was given. If your foot leaves the ground in a tackle you're leaving it up to the ref to decide your fate.
MLS,3duhrz,stealth_sloth,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:33:12 2015 UTC,By the time he got to the player foot was on the ground

If for some strange reason after he commits to that slide Klejstan decides to plant and cut rather than leaving his legs split, that can be an ankle-breaking tackle.  Some referees would give a yellow. Some would give a straight red. /u/HolyTurd is quite right, if you go in like that you're gambling on the ref."
MLS,3duhrz,midnight_thunder,0,Mon Jul 20 09:37:09 2015 UTC,That scrap the commentators and others outside reddit haven't said that - the only ones who have quite the studs up but fail to see that there was minimal if any contact and that the NYRB player purposely moved to get hit and was late to the ball
MLS,3duhrz,OrlandoCity-Fan,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:07 2015 UTC,"The trend for a while within FIFA has been clear; there is zero tolerance for those types of tackles. The ref sees Kljestan's reaction and doesn't have much of a choice.  Larin needs to know better. Yes, most of us call it a yellow, but if you show studs up, you need to know a red card is definitely possible."
MLS,3duhrz,pinata_penis_pump2,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:49:00 2015 UTC,Which is why Kjestan should be fined for simulation and they should appeal it so mls has to make a decision. Everyone knows the refs are being more aggressive in calling these fouls and the result is more faking it to influence the red.
MLS,3duhrz,mrsouffle,0,Mon Jul 20 02:58:22 2015 UTC,Simulation?  Do you know what that means?  Larin made contact.  Even if he didn't (which he clearly did) you don't need to make contact on a studs up challenge to get carded.
MLS,3duhrz,midnight_thunder,7,Mon Jul 20 03:19:32 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not the most clear-cut red I've ever seen. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't spot it or calls it yellow? Though that's more a remark on the consistency of refereeing in this league. Either way, it's studs-up, there's a small amount of contact to the shin (lucky there wasn't more), it's unintentionally reckless‚Ä¶ if this gets overturned (meaning the panel unanimously agrees that there's no way it was red) then I just don't even know what to do with this league anymore."
MLS,3duhrz,secretlyadog,14,Sun Jul 19 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunate you're getting downvotes, because you're not wrong. Studs-up tackle, Kljestan milked it for sure, but I can't imagine MLS overturns this one."

That influx of over 20,000 new fans probably has it's fair amount of people that have never really watched soccer before.   It doesn't mean they're right, but it means for our first year or maybe two, a lot of new fans will just not know what they're talking about.

MLS,3duhrz,kryptkeeper17,12,Sun Jul 19 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"What if I told you ""intent"" doesn't factor into the rules for ejections? See: Ned Grabavoy vs NE; Chris Tierney vs DCU. Dangerous play is dangerous play."
MLS,3duhrz,mrsouffle,0,Sun Jul 19 18:22:08 2015 UTC,"Okay take away intent and ""reckless"" is still a yellow not a red. Reckless is the exact word used in the rules of the game to define a yellow. Whereas for a red it has to be violent"
MLS,3duhrz,ftx437,9,Sun Jul 19 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Again, see Tierney and Grabavoy. Neither behaving violently (a word that itself implies some intent).

MLS,3duhrz,mrsouffle,4,Mon Jul 20 12:51:41 2015 UTC,There are 4 refs that account for more than 50% of the Reds called this season.  One of them was the 4th official and he is the one who made the call.  If you have one of these 4 refs it is literally 3X more likely that there will be a red than with other Pro Refs.

Regardless of what contact Larin made, he went in with the studs of one cleat showing on a ball that he could only have won by plowing through the player. A soft red card, should've been a yellow, but certainly not an egregiously wrong interpretation or a case of mistaken identity.  Larin's boot was so high and his slide took him so far beyond the player, I think there is enough of a case for 'serious foul play' that it will be difficult to overturn."
MLS,3duhrz,theschief,7,Sun Jul 19 18:44:49 2015 UTC,"He wasn't going for a tackle, he was trying to intercept the pass. His slide was long, slow and missed everything; but Sasha sold it with a ""you broke my leg"" dive and a good roll on the ground in pain for added affect."

I think something like that is the only time a team is going to win an appeal.

You can point to LA signing Gerrard and Dos Santos to huge contracts, but just as much of their success can be attributed to smaller signings like Lletget or smart investment in their youth development. A team with owners that good and a coach like Arena could be successful in any market and with any budget in the league.

There are a lot of poorly managed NFL teams but it's totally their fault. The NFL gives teams every opportunity in the world to get better.  Where as the premier league or in Europe, management can make all the right moves, make the absolute most of what they have, and stil, finish tenth, lose all their best players in the offseason, and have to start from scratch again.   Also I think it's more likely that the Redskins will win the Super Bowl than any team that finished outside of the top four last season winning the premier league."

So you're saying there is parity in the league b/c low spending clubs are at the top of the table? So next season, if only the top spending teams are at the top of the table does the hypothesis hold true?   How do we know that parity is the reason causing those low spending clubs to get to the top and not say coaching or academy investment? FC Dallas definitely isn't taking advantage of rules designed to facilitate parity in spending, so why credit that system for putting them at the top of the table?  In short, I'd say there's not much parity in the league (this isn't good or bad), but many teams can overcome that burden to still remain good. Thanks for the discussion. :)"
MLS,3duwe2,Xenotheos,5,Sun Jul 19 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"It would take a couple of years of the rich teams dominating to consider it a trend. As long as the league is a close run thing, as it is now, and most teams have the potential to compete overall and in almost every game then parity is preserved. With a continued shift away from even spending parity will diminish, as long as teams choose how to spend their money well.   It doesn't matter if coaching, academy investment, or a team's weekly hot yoga class is responsible for their performance. As long as teams come into the year with a decent potential to win the cup and can beat any team on any given day, then we're good."
MLS,3duwe2,RedBaboon,4,Sun Jul 19 23:58:44 2015 UTC,"So you're saying there is parity in the league b/c low spending clubs are at the top of the table? So next season, if only the top spending teams are at the top of the table does the hypothesis hold true?    To me, having this reversal would be evidence of parity. I don't think parity is measured by talent distribution or by monetary distribution, but by distribution of success. In my opinion, the reason for this distribution of success doesn't matter; it could be because of financial parity or coaching parity of even talent distribution or whatever. If you consistently have teams going in and out of the top group of teams and you have relative competiveness in the vast majority of games, you have plenty of parity. If you have a relatively unchanging group of top teams who will win every year, you have very little parity. Parity is measured by the end results, not the causes of those results."

In the last year we have made offers to Jermaine Jones, Chicharito (twice), and now Drogba. What do we have to show for this? Nobody, and a fan base that complains about lack of star power. We don't have a Gerard Houllier or anyone in the FO who can get shit done and close these deals. It sucks for fans, but there is definitely parity."

Look at TFC last year: easily the highest payroll in the league, 7th in the Eastern Conference."
MLS,3duwe2,longdrive95,35,Mon Jul 20 08:42:27 2015 UTC,"Parity is an illusion in fair sporting competition. The primary reason we think it exists is because of playoff tournament formats.   Ownership in American sports loves to tout parity as a result of player drafts, contract caps, and salary ceilings but in reality those are anti-labor practices that result in limiting player movement and earnings. They represent a set of policies that sometimes contribute to a more level playing field.   MLS faces a massive uphill battle in trying to create an American sports style protectionist model for its league. Signings like Dos Santos to L.A. and revisions to MLS rules to accommodate may be signaling that the free markets that exist in the globalised marketplace are winning. MLS does not enjoy the advantages of the NFL, NBA, and NHL of being the unquestioned top destination for players.   I hope the league gets wise and moves towards something more progressive like a luxury tax model as a step to find middle ground between the two worlds.   Single entity has also run its course, and I believe the second MLS makes a bid on the transfer market for a player that's also desired by the top teams in Europe - they will cry foul at the unfair advantage they face when bidding against an entire league.  For me, the path to parity is one that degrades the quality of the league too much to survive as a viable television product."
MLS,3duwe2,Kingmaker12,18,Sun Jul 19 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"To build on the statement parity is an illusion in sports. In the NFL when a team wins its division the next year you will have to play 2 other division winners. The same goes if a team finish fourth, you will play 2 other fourth place finishers. Two games may not seem like a lot but when you think of the difference between finishing 7-9 or 9-7 it can make all the difference.  But in the MLS all the teams have the scheduling set up is the same for all teams no matter where you finished the year before. This allows the better teams to rise to the top year in, year out. If a club does not do a lot to improve their team then they will finish near the same spot on the table. In this respect I feel its unfair to compare the MLS to the NFL in terms of parity.  Even though there may be a little of an illusion of parity in sports I do believe that parity is alive and well in the MLS. The two things I look at that tell me the MLS has parity are  1) as mentioned by /u/Atlanta-Avenger any team could beat each other- check 2) All teams have the same resources to compete. For example without a salary cap and DPs NYCFC and LA could out spend teams such as the Crew and Union and build a much better roster and run the league every year. With the set up we have now LA out spends the Crew and has a better team, but the Crew could go out and get DPs and help counter that. -check  With a young league like the MLS it doesn't make sense for teams such as the Crew to use there DPs to over pay players that aren't worth millions of dollars, like the fire. But with a 3 DP max it doesn't allow clubs such as LA to get to far ahead of the smaller market teams.   TL;DR  I disagree with OP that parity is not as prevalent in the MLS that we are made out to believe. With the mechanisms put in place such as the DP and salary cap it allows all teams a chance to win every year. It is up to the FO to use these mechanisms to there advantage.  Edit: Wording"
MLS,3duwe2,Gazza30,8,Sun Jul 19 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"Good points. A couple disagreements:   any team could beat each other- check   Maybe in each game yes, but statistically over time with a large enough sample size? I'm sure you'd see some trends consistently putting some teams over the others. This is also true in the NFL.   All teams have the same resources to compete.   In theory yes, but in reality, not so much. The Union front office can't spend as big as the Sounders, b/c the Union owners simply don't have any money. They aren't as wealthy as other ownership groups. Yes, they could potentially spend big b/c league rules allow it, but they never will.   I think this is where a lot of misunderstanding is. The league rules allow for teams to spend big, but since not all clubs can/are willing to then there will be differences (sometimes very large). The only way to avoid this (not saying we should) would be for a single entity league to give all teams the exact same amount of money.    But with a 3 DP max it doesn't allow clubs such as LA to get to far ahead of the smaller market teams.   Too far is the key word. They are still ahead, thus not equal. You may counter with well, that's still a little bit of parity. Well.. the only reason its not astronomically higher (which Toronto's 5:1 ratio to FC Dallas I'd argue is pretty high), is b/c those ownership groups don't have that kind of money. If they wanted they could buy a $50 million dollar player. I don't think there are any rules against it.  I also want to reiterate that I'm not concerned about the lack of parity. There's some very good reasons to let teams spend as much as they want due to the global competiion our league has (and many other reasons). I'm just trying to describe the reality of what we've got!"

MLS,3duwe2,Atlanta-Avenger,7,Sun Jul 19 22:05:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's competetiveness that people really mean when they talk about this. Garber's quote illustrates that. The way to judge competetiveness is to look at the track record of competition. Are matches closely contested? Do the best-performing teams change over time? Can the worst-performing teams in one year challenge next year? Fans don't care about salaries or rules, they care about on-field peformance and results. That's what you want (in my opinion) to be competitive."
MLS,3duwe2,TheArsenal1414,15,Sun Jul 19 22:12:33 2015 UTC,Honestly we don't have as much parity as we claim but we have way more than any of the major European leagues.

MLS,3duwe2,deville66,4,Sun Jul 19 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"But 1st place Seattle was missing their best defender, both of their starting strikers, and starting midfielder while playing away in Chicago two time zones away. That is randomness, not parity. If Chicago made the playoffs and beat Seattle in the home and home, that is parity. In the past 10 MLS Cup Championships, only 9 different teams have played in them and 6 different teams have won. Of the last 4, LA has won 3. Twice they played Houston. In the last 10 MLS Cup Championships, LA has played in 5 and won 4, Houston has playing in 4 and won 2, NE has played in 4(3 of those in a row) and lost all 4, and RSL has played in 2, winning one in penalties over none other than LA. Of the last 10 Super Bowls, 12 different teams have played and 8 different teams have won while NYG and Pitt have both won two. Seattle has played in 3 winning one, NE has played in 3 and won 1. Pitt has played in 3 while they won 2 and NYG have won both of those, while Indy has played in two and won one. Going over those numbers, LA Galaxy has won more MLS Cups in the last 10 years than any NFL team has played in Super Bowls. Between 2008-2010 there seemed to be some parity in the MLS as 3 different teams won in 3 different match ups. Outside of those 3 years, 6 of the 7 included one of the three if not two, of LA, NE and Houston.   tl;dr  The MLS Cup has featured a less number of teams in the past 10 years than the NFL. LA has won 4 MLS cups and Houston won 2, while NYG and Pitt have both won two Super Bowls."

Are you suggesting that literally every single team should have to spend the exact same amount?  This seems like a silly way to measure.  Parity exists strictly as a set of rules.  Reality will make teams better than others.  Willingness to spend money, ability to build a team, ability to attract star players due to location, etc.  These things are different, and that is what decides who is the best.    The truth is though, that the DP rule is probably the best solution to allow teams to spend money and maintain parity.  Sure, the Galaxy may have a good team, but that is mostly due to management being able to build a team under the salary cap, and adding the right DPs.  If teams were simply allowed to spend their total payroll distributed across their whole team, parity would not exist at all.  LAG, NYCFC, Toronto, etc would all be dominating the league."

MLS with 34 games, 2 legged playoffs followed by single game MLS cup allows the same randomness to take into place, with smaller impact due to higher number of games.    does MLS have parity though? no, not really. as can be evidenced by the same team winning the last few MLS cups, MLS is not a competitive league (at least not at the top)."

MLS,3dv9yz,Almagest09,8,Sun Jul 19 20:49:54 2015 UTC,"Columbus attacks. Meram, Higuain, Finlay, Kamara"
MLS,3dv9yz,Ahesterd,7,Sun Jul 19 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"Expect Columbus to dominate the midfield, completely overrunning the duo of Watson and Cocis, and forcing Sean Johnson to play his damn mind out in order to give the Fire any hope at all. The Fire, meanwhile, will look to take advantage of their skilled, speedy wingers in Accam and Nyarko to counter the fuck out of Columbus, with Harry Shipp looking to control the Fire's offense with some sweet sweet passing and great vision that's been missing from the middle of the park for far too long."
MLS,3dv9yz,TheArsenal1414,5,Sun Jul 19 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"A solid Columbus squad that will be keeping most of the possession, and a struggling Chicago team that will be defending for our lives the entire 90, kicking the ball to nobody upfront whenever we get possession."
MLS,3dv9yz,Almagest09,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:11 2015 UTC,Anyone got a good stream?
MLS,3dv9yz,JAShock,4,Sun Jul 19 20:53:44 2015 UTC,It's on ESPN2 and their website watchespn.com
MLS,3dv9yz,Rain94,2,Sun Jul 19 20:54:58 2015 UTC,I think our legend beep mentioned he was going to stream this one
MLS,3dv9yz,5nakefork,2,Sun Jul 19 20:55:28 2015 UTC,Wacth trinidad and tobago until the fire/crew game starts.

MLS,3dv9yz,FatboyAFC,2,Sun Jul 19 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, this ref loves to blow his whistle for everything"
MLS,3dv9yz,StephenGold79,2,Sun Jul 19 21:41:07 2015 UTC,Fire have to make these set pieces count

MLS,3dv9yz,aenigmatix,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:43 2015 UTC,Unlucky deflection.

MLS,3dv9yz,SecondhandSlaves,2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:36 2015 UTC,That backheel was nasty
MLS,3dv9yz,bcbrown19,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"Well at least I got to catch a bit of the match and the 3rd Crew goal.   We play so well at times, it's hard to understand how we are not higher in the table."
MLS,3dv9yz,cojiba,2,Sun Jul 19 23:30:51 2015 UTC,"...and the Chicago Fire continue to Chicago Fire.  They have good players, they play well for long periods of the game, they create tons of chances, and in the end it amounts to nothing."
MLS,3dv9yz,arsene14,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pleased with the result, but the ref was utter shit. Player falls down? Foul. Shoulder to should challenge? Foul.  2nd red was harsh, but seeing the replay, it was definitely a cardable offense.  Sorry, Bridgeview."

MLS,3dv9yz,UlricVonDicktenstein,4,Sun Jul 19 23:15:36 2015 UTC,That's a brutal call. No way that's a pk. Sorry Chicago.
MLS,3dv9yz,Ahesterd,4,Sun Jul 19 21:37:28 2015 UTC,This asshole better fucking call every single fucking embellishment then.
MLS,3dv9yz,AnInsanityHour,5,Sun Jul 19 22:42:51 2015 UTC,Be careful what you wish for.
MLS,3dv9yz,Ahesterd,5,Sun Jul 19 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"Well, if he gives out 8 more yellows to Fire players for embellishment at least you can rest assured that we won't fucking embellish next week. That's probably about the most positive result I can think of actually happening at this point."
MLS,3dv9yz,Ahesterd,4,Sun Jul 19 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"Man, I really want to make jokes about Adrian Heath saying ""scenic Columbus, Ohio"" and not being sarcastic but it'd just sound super salty."

MLS,3dv9yz,Greenlytrees,4,Sun Jul 19 22:38:38 2015 UTC,I used to work there!  It's a fun place if you don't mind the wait.
MLS,3dv9yz,OGbuc,4,Sun Jul 19 22:39:29 2015 UTC,Love Thurman's!

I love American cities and want to see as many as I can, Columbus included. Cleveland was kinda lame though.   Plus, now that Saad is there I'm definitely gonna be keeping an eye on the Blue Jackets."
MLS,3dv9yz,human1st,2,Sun Jul 19 22:34:43 2015 UTC,Never been. How would you describe it?
MLS,3dv9yz,Greenlytrees,6,Sun Jul 19 22:27:54 2015 UTC,"Emerging?  It's a fast growing city with lots of history but also developing its identity a bit.  It's spread out over a large area (tons of suburbs), the downtown is being rejuvenated though.  If you're willing to drive there's lots to do, great food everywhere, and some wildly different places all in one city (OSU's campus is massive, German Village is....eclectic, Bexley is a beautiful area, the Arena District is lively, etc)"

MLS,3duouv,c0c0c0,9,Sun Jul 19 17:32:07 2015 UTC,Deric has been by far the most entertaining keeper to watch this season.
MLS,3duouv,SenorHatorade,6,Sun Jul 19 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"Its worth mentioning that Deric grew up in Houston's backyard. Born and raised in Katy, also worked his way up thru Houston Dynamo's youth academy."

MLS,3duouv,stealth_sloth,4,Mon Jul 20 07:15:41 2015 UTC,Worth mentioning that RSL had three balls cleared off the line in this game. Houston won't be hurting for SOTW candidates this week.

MLS,3du4xu,angrydad69,7,Sun Jul 19 14:22:55 2015 UTC,"Congrats to Dallas. 4-0 isn't quite reflective of the game, the ref really ruined the rhythm of the game after 2-0 and just New York couldn't finish a chance/Dallas' keeper played very well. Nonetheless FC Dallas certainly deserved to win, both teams look well set for the future."

Guardado on the other hand was eredivisie player of the year and is one of the key reasons PSV will be in the Champions league next year. Currently one of the best CDM's in the world plus that's not really a position that MLS teams care about much."

MLS,3du48o,SphincterKing,5,Sun Jul 19 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, this was completely expected. In the 2000s, the US is 7-0-0 against Cuba, with five wins by 3 goals or more. Dempsey and Donovan generally rack up goals against them. The only matches that were troublesome were the match in the 2005 Gold Cup and the away qualifier in 2008.  The big surprise yesterday was that Cuba didn't bunker, making it easy for the US. Just look at the marking of Dempsey on the 1st goal and Zardes on the 2nd."
MLS,3dss57,alexoobers,35,Sun Jul 19 02:44:03 2015 UTC,And he also had a goal
MLS,3dss57,TrevenxD,11,Sun Jul 19 02:47:25 2015 UTC,thats beautiful.

MLS,3dss57,take_a_bow_son,50,Sun Jul 19 13:14:28 2015 UTC,Clearly isn't as good as Mix. Glad we have $600k players like Mix classing up the national team over scrubs like Feilhaber.
MLS,3dss57,xbhaskarx,28,Sun Jul 19 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"Forget Mix who has actually had moments with the national team, guys like Zusi, Morales, and even Brad Davis (before he was replaced by Garza) made the initial 23 man Gold Cup roster as midfielders while Feilhaber didn't even make the preliminary list of 35..."
MLS,3dss57,CptObviousRemark,18,Sun Jul 19 03:28:42 2015 UTC,"Zusi did have 2 good assists at the World Cup.  But the way he's been playing this season, you wouldn't know it."
MLS,3dss57,xbhaskarx,10,Sun Jul 19 05:50:14 2015 UTC,"Well you'd think the Gold Cup roster would be selected on current performance and not based on two assists from a year ago. For example Donovan dominated for the national team throughout 2013 (from the previous Gold Cup to the dos a cero over Mexico in September) yet was left off the World Cup roster a year later...   Actually what's interesting is Klinsmann's non-answer reasoning behind both the Donovan and Feilhaber omissions is almost identical:  Regarding Donovan in 2014: ""I just see some other players slightly ahead of him.""  Regarding Feilhaber in 2015: ""It‚Äôs a simple answer, there are other ones ahead of him.""  I guess that's just his go-to response when he doesn't have any objective basis for snubbing a player...."
MLS,3dss57,5nakefork,3,Sun Jul 19 09:06:43 2015 UTC,"He's got a better work rate on both sides of the ball than Mix, Zardes, Davis, Morales, or anyone else comparable I can think of. He tracks back like a fucking wolverine."
MLS,3dss57,njndirish,3,Sun Jul 19 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"/u/MLS_analyst is there an explanation for this?  Additionally, could you answer the following question that's bothered me for 5 years.  Am I correct to remember that whenever Benny came on during the 2010 World cup, the US became much better going forward?"
MLS,3dss57,party1234,20,Sun Jul 19 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"How he isn't with the national team is beyond me, but, damn, he's on a tear right now. He's playing at an exceptional level, higher than any US midfielder except Bradley (and maybe including Bradley)."
MLS,3dss57,marqueezy,2,Sun Jul 19 05:28:40 2015 UTC,Probably some personal shit between him an Klinsmann. I like Benny but he's kind of a hot head and I remember him letting his emotions get the best of him in one of January camp friendlies after Klinsmann took charge.
MLS,3dss57,serious_black,25,Mon Jul 20 06:07:18 2015 UTC,I have no problem with watching Benny make outstanding plays like this if Klinsmann doesn't want him.
MLS,3dss57,LocksTheFox,14,Sun Jul 19 03:24:09 2015 UTC,who thought that light of blue vs. white was a good idea
MLS,3dss57,Ontarien,2,Sun Jul 19 03:11:23 2015 UTC,Seriously. Montr√©al should have cracked out the blue and black alternates for this match.

What should've happened is that SKC should've worn their secondary kits at home, and also have Montreal where their whites.  The one problem with our 3rd kits, is that they're as light as our primaries, so they don't help with color clashes."
MLS,3dss57,notevenmyfinalporn,12,Sun Jul 19 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"Benny is putting together a truly special year and should be an MVP contender.

MLS,3dss57,LochRaven,6,Sun Jul 19 03:25:06 2015 UTC,I didn't realize when watching it live that Dwyer never takes a touch until he puts it in the back of the net. That is a perfectly weighted through ball.

This is a great pass, worth noting, but I can't count on two hands the amount of better plays that get posted only to have mods delete them and say ""well that play was covered in the weekly wrap-up"". Example? A couple weeks ago a Gyasi/Keane 2-man counterattack got 3k upvotes on /r/soccer but was immediately deleted when posted on /r/MLS.  I'd like to see more consistency when it comes to this. It can be quite frustrating. I personally think any highlight reel goal/play should be posted for all to see, but maybe I just like watching MLS more than the mods.  (end of rant)  Great pass, perfectly weighted. Great run by Dom, too."

But at that time, and probably still now, there was a secret list of players the league would change/break any rule to get to sign with any team, so right of first refusal hasn't really been a thing in awhile. Maybe all the recent signing of recent times and Drogba's age have pushed his stock down to that of the common player, who knows. One thing is certain though: MLS is going to MLS."

MLS,3dsqzi,jt1929,9,Sun Jul 19 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"Chicago, though, has first option on Drogba through the archaic discovery list system and they would be keen to strike the option if he signs the contract MLS has reportedly offered him.    Something significant has to give with the league for the Impact to secure Drogba's services. What appears clear at this stage is he does not want to sign the league's offer if indeed it would be the Fire.   Nothing excites me more than the potential of a new league mechanism to get a player to a certain team. Hopefully the Fire front office didn't uninstall Skype after the Jones fiasco!"
MLS,3dsqzi,RabidCoyote,4,Sun Jul 19 03:01:06 2015 UTC,"Go Impact! Nice to see one of the non-usual MLS destinations as the number one landing spot a DP asks for.

MLS,3dsydi,YomsThe3rd,51,Sun Jul 19 03:52:45 2015 UTC,The amount of reds in this league makes the games not very fun to watch. I'm sure it turns some people away when all they see are red cards every other game. Red cards need to be something very serious and it just doesn't feel that way. Too many times has something that should've been a yellow been called a red and its ridiculous.
MLS,3dsydi,Lucas12,24,Sun Jul 19 05:04:19 2015 UTC,This is the case with the number of PKs in this league as well....
MLS,3dsydi,Proteus010,24,Sun Jul 19 06:12:38 2015 UTC,What's insane is way too many PKs are given out yet they are still missing obvious ones nearly every game.
MLS,3dsydi,pvdfan,6,Sun Jul 19 10:01:50 2015 UTC,"That's the rub, they're missing obvious calls and seemingly over-punishing later, weaker fouls with ejections and penalties to make up for their original shittiness.  They're also WILDLY inconsistent.  A non call trip happens on one side then an almost identical trip happens going the other way and it gets called.  It's really bad."

MLS,3dsydi,Bawbx,24,Sun Jul 19 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"Has anyone considered that the problem isn't ""the refs""?  The problem is Ted Unkle and few others.  I can't remember where I read this, but if you take Unkle and two other refs (I think Toledo is one) out, the remaining refs are giving cards at a similar rate to most other big leagues.  Unkle is giving out red cards at an insane pace - I think it was something like one every other match.  And now I learn he doesn't even have to be the referee to deliver a red card.  When ""the refs"" appear to be giving out too many red cards, it's a valid counterargument to say that maybe the players should learn to behave themselves.  But when it's not ""the refs"", but two or three specific refs, it's pretty clear cut that there's a problem with those refs.  Otherwise, you're left with only two rather ridculous alternative explanations:  either Unkle is the unluckiest guy in the history of refereeing, or all the other refs are too lenient."

MLS,3dsydi,erockarmy1,32,Sun Jul 19 12:29:42 2015 UTC,The refs are MLS 1.0 where the league has grown and advanced past them. There is no excuse when they are dictating games by poor officiating. It ruins the beautiful game and ultimately holds back the league from growing.
MLS,3dsydi,brocklese,27,Sun Jul 19 06:53:18 2015 UTC,"This has to be repeated every time there is complaining about the refs. MLS, the USSF, and Canadian Soccer Association, formed a group called PRO(Professional Referee Organization) only a few years ago. The goal was to improve officiating from the bottom to top. They hired a former EPL ref to run it. It has only been in place since 2012. The best refs work MLS, then NASL, USL, and on down. PRO now has their own union and bargained for a new contract last year.  There was no other solution. There are no MLS 2.0 refs out there. The point of PRO is to develop better refs. Importing foreign refs would be stupid and only a band-aid. And guess what? They are often no better.   Every fan in the rest of the world thinks their refs are the worst and hates them. That is all."
MLS,3dsydi,erockarmy1,9,Sun Jul 19 12:48:18 2015 UTC,Every fan in the rest of the world thinks their refs are the worst and hates them. That is all.   This is the case in pretty much every sport. The only ref I'm ever stoked about is Hochuli.
MLS,3dsydi,ricodued,2,Sun Jul 19 17:04:37 2015 UTC,"And you know what? Hochuli makes idiotic mistakes, too. He was the one that called this an incomplete pass back in 2008 and cost the Chargers the game. And let's not forget Koman Coulibaly in the USA-Slovenia match in 2010. He was chosen as one of the top refs in the world.  Every ref is guilty of asinine mistakes, and while MLS reffing can obviously improve, we need to be patient."

MLS,3dsydi,danubio,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:59 2015 UTC,"In terms of reds, I see it as a player problem. We are too physical of a league, and people are constantly going to the ground and endangering each other."

But I'm getting tired of the ""Refs Hate Us"" circlejerk from Orlando fans and Coach Heath.  The refs are bad. Every team in the league knows this. That's why you don't see other players going in for studs up challenges at midfield for no discernible reason.   Or petulantly pushing over opponents and then stepping on them.   Who cares if it was accidental. Who cares if the studs up challenge made no contact.  How many times have you heard the announcers say ""well, if you don't want to get called for a PK don't go to ground in the box"".  Give an MLS ref a chance to make a bad call and he will 50% of the time.   We have so much fucking talent, we attack with so much pace and skill, and we are pissing it all away because we are naive and have no fucking discipline."
MLS,3dsydi,secretlyadog,44,Sun Jul 19 04:25:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think you heard Adrian Heath correctly. He's not saying ""The refs hate us""  He's saying ""The refs made too many mistakes for both teams"" - He even said that the game should have ended 3-0 instead of 2-0. How is that ""Woe is me, 'cause refs""?  I do see what you're saying about not giving the refs an opportunity to make a bad call, but should we not endeavor to expect and demand better officiating in the league?  Is he not correct that the biggest thing we're talking about after this game is the officiating? This postgame speech from Heath is not a ""circle jerk"". He's not saying ""The refs keep costing us games and the league needs to do something about it so that we have a fair chance in this competition!""   That's why you don't see other players going in for studs up challenges at midfield for no discernible reason.   That's what makes this more infuriating. You do see those kinds of challenges happen in other games by players on other teams and they don't get called - even when there's contact! You think we're the only team that makes dangerous challenges? Please...  lots of teams in the league do this - just about every team. Because the players are human."

MLS,3dsydi,dubron,-17,Sun Jul 19 04:43:48 2015 UTC,"I do see what you're saying about not giving the refs an opportunity to make a bad call...   Relevance.    but should we not endeavor to expect and demand better officiating in the league?   Pissing into the wind. We need to learn to manage the refs the way other teams do.   The way David Villa got Collin red-carded on opening day for a pretty soft foul.   The way they constantly knock Kaka down, off the ball, and never even get carded for it, completely gutting our counter-attacks.   Their fouls don't look bad. They are effective and they look innocuous. Double points.  Ours are pointless, they don't help us at all, and they are obvious as fuck.   ‚Ä¢ Boden throwing us arm up.   ‚Ä¢ Kaka running over the RSL player.   ‚Ä¢ Studs up Larin.  They do nothing for us and they look worse than they are. Double points lost."
MLS,3dsydi,secretlyadog,6,Sun Jul 19 04:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I already conceded your point. The first part of that sentence was:   I do see what you're saying about not giving the refs an opportunity to make a bad call   However, I'd like to think that the first half of that sentence and the second half aren't mutually exclusive.  Edit: btw, thanks for the clarification! :)"
MLS,3dsydi,dubron,-16,Sun Jul 19 04:59:54 2015 UTC,"They're not... but the 2nd half of the sentence isn't going to help us this season.  Crying about how bad the refs are is not going to change a thing this season. MLS isn't going to go out and hire new refs because everyone says they're bad. Hasn't worked in previous seasons, not sure why Heath thinks it will work this season.  If we want to make the playoffs, and we do definitely have the players, we need to get some discipline now. Stop making these silly mistakes now (yesterday, to be honest).   It's a little shocking to me that they didn't use Kaka's red card two weeks ago as a learning opportunity to say, look, guys... play it cool."

While true, it does bring into light the major inconsistent calls the refs make. For instance the push of kaka, and not even a card, or the cleats to the back of Collin no card.. but no contact with a player is an automatic red?"
MLS,3dsydi,ftx437,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"While true, it does bring into light the major inconsistent calls the refs make.   .... every single fan base has complained about the refs for over a  decade.  It's not some fucking national mystery MLS needed OC fans to uncover.   Our players need to get cynical. They need to do it now if we want to make the playoffs. They need to stop throwing games away by getting pointless cards.   It's kind of sad that none of you see this. Actually.. Really sad."
MLS,3dsydi,secretlyadog,7,Sun Jul 19 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"Completely, 100% agreed; but we shouldn't need to be this wary. Something needs to be done about the quantity of red cards/penalties being given."

He's very much loved here, and the crowd responds to him. He was saying ""Get loud and support your team. They can still do this"" and the crowd responded. The last thing he could do as a coach... as he was leaving is to coach the crowd to get loud.  Personally, I think that's praiseworthy. Of course, I'd prefer it if he remained on the field. But I'll remember that moment forever."
MLS,3dsydi,dubron,-30,Sun Jul 19 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"No they are certainly not only doing that.  The moment in which a coach is sent off is not a moment that an FO should praise.

MLS,3dsydi,dubron,-26,Sun Jul 19 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"No. I'm invested in my team and by extension the quality of the league. In that respect I want my team to play in a league where teams' FOs have mutual respect for one another and officials.

MLS,3dsydi,j_andrew_h,4,Sun Jul 19 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"Why should they remain neutral? They're not journalists, it's the club's official Twitter, that's about as partisan as you can get."
MLS,3dsydi,Husker-Dude,21,Sun Jul 19 16:22:10 2015 UTC,It's not disgusting. It's standing up for the coach and the team. It's disgusting that red cards are shown with such frequency in this league for weak challenges.
MLS,3dsydi,Lucas12,-20,Sun Jul 19 05:11:28 2015 UTC,No. It's an incredible display of disrespect on the part of the FO towards referees and the league as a whole.  That is not to ignore the refereeing problems this league has. The quality is a problem everyone is aware of. But a professional organization ought to be deferential towards those empowered to arbitrate the match. A coach's send off should never be celebrated by the FO.
MLS,3dsydi,massivescoop,15,Sun Jul 19 05:19:11 2015 UTC,We wouldn't need to call the referees shit so often if they weren't shit so often
MLS,3dsydi,longboardingerrday,-15,Sun Jul 19 05:43:55 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about you complaining about the refs. I yell at refs. I'm talking about an employee of a professional sports league openly celebrating a moment they shouldn't.
MLS,3dsydi,massivescoop,9,Sun Jul 19 05:47:50 2015 UTC,You guys must sit a lot during games...as it was stated before. It was because he got ejected. It was for the way Heath was trying/did get the crowed pumped as he was leaving the feild.. your arguments make no sense
MLS,3dsydi,ftx437,-14,Sun Jul 19 12:53:51 2015 UTC,No. We stand.  I know precisely what I'm talking about. It's not my fault if you don't understand the argument.
MLS,3dsydi,massivescoop,2,Sun Jul 19 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"Well, from your so called argument...you say it was disrespectful for the ocsc to post a pic of inchy, pumping up the crowd as he was leaving the feild... which has nothing to do with the decision but him pumping up the crowd.. you are just acting as one of those people who  are to easily offended or even go look for something to be offended about. Ever think of how disrespectful refs can be by giving frivolous red cards? (Not just talk ocsc, all teams have had some like that happen that infuence the game.)"
MLS,3dsydi,ftx437,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"One cannot separate his pumping the crowd up from why he was leaving the pitch. It's fine if fans love it. It's not fine for a FO to promote actions done in connection with it.  Again, I have no disagreement with people saying that there are officiating issues in the league."
MLS,3dsydi,massivescoop,-3,Sun Jul 19 16:18:32 2015 UTC,"This is a perfectly reasonable opinion. I just looked at their official twitter account for the first time and am surprised at the number of tweets that look like they were written by a 12 year old homer. Complaints about calls and non-calls then the tweet with the picture of Klestjen holding a pair of Oscars. Funny, but not what I'd expect from a professional organization."
MLS,3dsydi,apascale,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:16 2015 UTC,The current social media head has pushed the meme culture during their run.  The article the Orlando Sentinel ran about him included a line about complains the meme style stuff got.
MLS,3dsydi,pvdfan,4,Sun Jul 19 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"people like it when coaches get ejected, it gets the crowd riled up. have you ever seen a baseball game? plus you sound like one of those easily-offended people who everyone (like Jerry Seinfeld) seems to be ripping these days."
MLS,3dsydi,kstew4eva,-4,Sun Jul 19 14:52:56 2015 UTC,That's super nice of you to assume properties of me based on the belief that this particular behavior is out of bounds.  I don't know how many times I have to explain myself. I have little issue with fans cheering and liking it (I'm not sure how I feel about that).  What I have issue with is the team reveling in it through their official channels.
MLS,3dsydi,massivescoop,4,Sun Jul 19 16:13:56 2015 UTC,I didn't really say anything about you as a person. I made a comment about your comment. try not to take things so personally bud
MLS,3dsydi,kstew4eva,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"That combined with their Sacha comment (which he respond to, BTW) leaves me with a poor taste in my mouth. I'm all in favor of homer twitter accounts, but whoever is in charge of their social media here isn't impressing anyone. Unprofessional, ungracious, and overall just unnecessary.  Edit: Guys, don‚Äôt downvote just cause you disagree with me (or other people in general). If you disagree with me, don‚Äôt downvote (don‚Äôt upvote obviously) but reply and tell me why I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm happy to have that conversation any day of the week; learning to admit I'm wrong and why is a good and healthy thing. Leave downvoting for things that add nothing to the conversation. Upvoting and downvoting based off of opinion just leads to hiveminded opinions and boring circlejerks, it just kills most potential good discussion."
MLS,3dsydi,take_a_bow_son,10,Sun Jul 19 05:08:37 2015 UTC,"What Sacha did ruins the game of soccer more so than bad refereeing. If anyone needs to be called out its him. Good player. Fantastic goal. But making a joke on twitter is far more classy than his antics last night. If I'm looking at a fan twitter account vs professional athlete, one of them should be held to a higher standard. The twitter comment was funny more than anything."
MLS,3dsydi,gabot045,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:43:10 2015 UTC,"What Sacha did was certainly wrong, we can agree on that. Larin shouldn't have been coming in studs up at midfield right in front of an AR + 4th official, but still the wrong call made and a meal made out of it by Sacha.  Did he screw the game more than the ref? Eh, debatable, I'd argue differently, but I see where you're coming from there and respect your point of view.  Should someone be able to make a joke at him for what he did? Absolutely, but it shouldn't be the team itself. That's uncalled for and unprofessional. Like I said in another comment, ""if it was your SB Nation Blog or some other fan who tweeted that, then it'd be perfectly fine and borderline funny (not very original though)"". I agree one of them should be held to a higher standard on twitter. What I disagree with is that it's not the individual athlete, over official representation of the team itself. I would think an organization needs to hold itself to a higher standard than an individual."
MLS,3dsydi,take_a_bow_son,3,Sun Jul 19 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"I understand your point as well. 2 wrongs don't make a right. Emotions were high last night. The atmosphere at the Citrus Bowl was pretty disgruntled, but that's when you've got to remember it's just a game."
MLS,3dsydi,gabot045,9,Sun Jul 19 14:27:02 2015 UTC,There is no potential for good discussion when you're literally whining about a somewhat funny twitter post.
MLS,3dsydi,CallMeFierce,0,Sun Jul 19 12:36:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't think I was whining, I apologize if it comes off that way. I just meant to point of something that seemed very unprofessional to me. If it was your SB Nation Blog or some other fan who tweeted that, then it'd be perfectly fine and borderline funny (not very original though). Coming from the team itself looks sloppy and a little like a sore loser. I apologize if I came off as whining, just meant to point out something I thought was off."
MLS,3dsydi,take_a_bow_son,6,Sun Jul 19 13:52:25 2015 UTC,I'm impressed by them.

MLS,3dsydi,longboardingerrday,0,Sun Jul 19 05:42:44 2015 UTC,"I can see where they're coming from. Loyalty. Anger at the injustice. Etc.  But I'm kind of saddened by it too.   Getting ejected sends the exact wrong message.   We need him to tell our players to keep their cool, not lose his own cool.  It worries me that he doesn't seem to be holding the players accountable, and it upsets me the fans aren't holding him accountable.  We have the players to succeed in this league this year. We need to not make rookie mistakes and the coach needs to fucking know they won't cut it at this level."
MLS,3dsydi,secretlyadog,6,Sun Jul 19 05:06:08 2015 UTC,Let's be real. It's like the coach getting a T in basketball. It hypes the team.

MLS,3dsydi,ftx437,-4,Sun Jul 19 15:57:59 2015 UTC,"In this case why should we hold either accountable for a dive..look at the replay of it. No contact with the player, until he tries to get up and the red bull guy just milks the contact. Neither player or coach's fault   It is absolutely the player and coaches fault.  I can forgive you for not expecting a soccer player to embellish every chance they can, because this is your first season watching soccer.  It has to be your first season, because there is literally no other way you would say something that completely naive.   Boohoo they embellish.  Stop and think about that. You're getting upset that other teams are embellishing our fouls... in soccer.   Embellishing...  our fouls...  in soccer.  I can forgive you because you're new to the game.   I can't forgive so called professionals for not knowing that at this level every single mistake you make is going to be exploited.    That is 100% on the coach. You guys need to get off his dick long enough to see he is hurting the team."

Johnson's double yellow was such an absurd call that its honestly just laughable. MLS should overturn it. The red card against Vancouver was also idiotic. Those are just the send offs (love how he waited until the final whistle to try and have some control) but they were reflections of the officiating all game long. It was painful to watch. We should be celebrating Valeri's ability to turn an awful touch into a goal, or Nat Borchers' INCREDIBLE save. And maybe some Vancouver stuff too, I guess... But here we are, bitching about the refs again. I'm tired of it, honestly. When is the MLS going to do something?  But on a happier note... Vancouver, gg. You earned that tie. It was still a fun game to watch."

MLS,3dt4hs,Caelanl,5,Sun Jul 19 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"My issue wasn't even the red in the entire run of play leading up to it. Villafa√±a not going to ground but being yanked at from behind; then, the Whitecap going to ground and blocking Villafa√±a's run with his entire body to dispossess from Villafa√±a.... The game had been increasing in intensity steadily with risky challenges and some challenges that just looked cynical, but the ref couldn't control it because he would consistently call poor fouls and ignore the more egregious ones."
MLS,3dt4hs,ingeniopolis,3,Sun Jul 19 18:15:05 2015 UTC,Why would the red card be deserved?
MLS,3dt4hs,Caelanl,2,Sun Jul 19 19:35:07 2015 UTC,"Left boot was up, right knee slid into Valeri's planted ankle. I think that it was definitely a very dangerous play, however Guzman called the whole run of play poorly and should have called multiple fouls before that even happened. The foul on Villafana should have stopped play followed by the horrible challenge by Wallace that earned him a yellow. If you let play continue after fouls then the fouls are just going to get worse.  http://gfycat.com/DependableHonorableIcterinewarbler"
MLS,3dt4hs,eers2snow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:40:57 2015 UTC,"u/RobotDeathSquad explains it perfectly. Valeri turns around at the last second to be slid into. Also, your left boot is allowed to be up. His studs weren't showing. It should have been a yellow."
MLS,3dt4hs,steerbell,2,Sun Jul 19 23:04:53 2015 UTC,"Fatty in yellow was poor last night. Just off the top of my head: 1.  A red card and an injury in stoppage, no extra stoppage. 2.  Screwed a clear counter attack in the 2nd half where advantage was on. 3.  Chara's clean take away = yellow card.  Jokes. 4.  The red was questionable.  Probably would have been a yellow from me. 5.  Build up to that red was fucking ridiculous though.  Textbook example of what not to do as a ref, IMO.  Play should have been stopped twice in the moments before.  Beitashour should have had a caution for a double footed tackle, Wallace should have been carded for his challenge seconds after that.  Whistle those and you don't see the tackle on Valeri. 5.   Just lack of knowledge on how and when to use cards IMO. Game got out of hand as he didn't reach to his pocket and clean up the persistent infringement at several points in the game. 6.  Probably should have been yellows for time wasting in this game, and I'm usually pretty lenient on that.  You can't pick up a ball and go for a jog with it in the closing minutes.  But you could in this game."
MLS,3dt4hs,Whitecapsfan2014,6,Sun Jul 19 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"The double yellow after the game we really don't know about.

MLS,3dt4hs,MLS_Analyst,11,Sun Jul 19 07:32:19 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of respect for you ‚Äì yours is one of the MLS columns I most look forward to, and definitely that I read the most ‚Äì but I reject the notion that unless I'm willing and able to do someone else's job, I am unqualified to criticize. Professional athletes are paid to be good at sports; professional referees are paid to be good at refereeing them. To ask that they be good at these things is not to say ""I could do better"" but to say ""they, as people who have chosen this profession, should be able to do better."" And it's perfectly fair. They're called ""spectator sports"" because they're there for the spectator, and some of the discussion will inevitably be criticism of those involved.  If you want to argue that it's unreasonable to expect these professionals to perform better than they have, that's a reasonable argument (even if I might disagree) ‚Äì I often hear people argue that it'd be hard for any referee to see a certain foul in real-time, at game speed, and that's fair. Humans are fallible. I think the argument here, though, is that these are not those types of calls, and these are generally calls that a top-tier referee should be able to get right most of the time. Either way, this ""you try doing it"" logical fallacy is essentially an appeal to accomplishment, and I don't think it has merit here or in most sports discussions.  As an aside: Reddit is a really great place for pissing in the wind. Twitter, too."
MLS,3dt4hs,funkipus,6,Sun Jul 19 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"This is very fair, and I expressed myself poorly in my original (drunk) post.  My frustration on the topic of MLS refs & officiating in the US and Canada in general is that there's a pervasive ""Why don't THEY do something about it"" attitude which does, I think, actual harm to the depth and quality of officiating in the region. Top-down solutions for talent development are rarely more than a band-aid, as many people feel is the case with PRO.  And honestly, the last thing any fanbase should want is executive control of officiating.  The only way for it to get better (and keep doing so) is for more knowledgeable, committed people to become refs. Ground-up, not top-down.  Anyway, that probably would have been a better original post from me. But as you say, Reddit is a really great place for pissing in the wind."
MLS,3dt4hs,Breklinho,5,Sun Jul 19 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"But why don't they do something? There seems to be almost no new blood year after year. Kevin Stott has be shitting up games in this league for the entire duration of the damn league! There are plenty of great refs out there, but it's a good ol boys club. When I was heavy into it, there was literally zero path to doing higher end games. I only started doing NCAA Division II games when I found out who assigned them and called and asked to be put on the list. Then I had to buy > $400 in new uniforms and other equipment so I could be paid $85 for a center.  I have literally know idea how you become an MLS ref."
MLS,3dt4hs,beneaththeradar,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that probably both things are needed ‚Äì top-down and ground-up ‚Äì and PRO is and can only be part of the solution. But I think this is a fair point. It's a relatively thankless job, which can make the pool fairly small, leading to as scarcity of options for leagues like MLS. How do you motivate people to pursue this career (outside of arguments on Reddit, of course)? I don't know ‚Äì still seems like I'm looking at it from a bit of a top-down perspective; maybe that's wrong. But the organizations responsible for growing the sport in the country/region (USSF, MLS) are inevitably going to be the ones expected to produce changes here, so it does seem like a worthwhile question.  Anyway, not sure why even this response is getting downvotes. Momentum, I guess."
MLS,3dt4hs,Breklinho,4,Sun Jul 19 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"I'll survive the downvote brigade. Glad that my dickishness turned into a good discussion, and thanks for being more than reasonable."
MLS,3dt4hs,beneaththeradar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:27 2015 UTC,Yes that's a bit incendiary but there's a lot of truth to what is said here. I've been refereeing for 7 years and what I've found most is that the pool of referees is spread incredibly thin. I frequently get requests to do assignments two counties away because an assignor has over a dozen games completely vacant. We need more refs to work these lower level games to provide a greater level of competition among refs from an early stage!
MLS,3dt4hs,Proteus010,-5,Sun Jul 19 22:09:27 2015 UTC,Can we talk about how Timbers fans always attribute their downfalls to bad refereeing?

MLS,3drewz,jkure2,5,Sat Jul 18 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, I totally agree, but FOX will do whatever it feels is in their best interest.  This strategy seems like it would maximize viewers on their networks.  A few million will tune in for their Simpsons and Bob's Burgers, while another few million will try to access the match on FOX Sports 1 if they have it in their package.  If it was the other way around, I'm not sure with what they would do with their animation shows."
MLS,3drewz,GiveMeSomeRaptorNews,5,Sat Jul 18 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"Put them off for a week?  I don't know.  I deliberately tried not to present my argument as a totally rational one, because it's not.  FOX makes more more money by showing Bob's burgers, surely.  I think buying the rights to 2018 and 2022, as well as the Bundesliga and part of MLS, plus the Champions League shows a desire to invest in the future, though.    So come on, then, let's see some investment.    EDIT: I also read that one semi final is on Fox Sports 2.  That's just plain unacceptable, and Fox can fuck right off with that one."
MLS,3drewz,jkure2,5,Sat Jul 18 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way for a positive: with more and more access, I don't really mind it being on FOX Sports 1.  Cable TV is become more specialized in what it delivers, and certain programing goes to certain slots.  Look, the College Football Playoff is exclusively on ESPN rather than ABC, and still gets massive ratings.  Half of the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs are on NBC Sports rather than NBC proper.  More baseball playoff games are going on TBS and FOX Sports rather than FOX.  It's not unique to soccer, it's more of a sports thing in general, and in the long run, I don't think having the game on FOX Sports over FOX would hinder the growth of the game in the country."

The weather was awful today no one would want to be outside unless they have to. This game should've been the later one as 5:00 is a pretty inconvenient time for a game. The largest free festival in the country is happening in the city currently. Lastly, the attendance wasn't that bad, but they didn't close off the upper deck and the stadium seats 71,000 so there were far more people than it looked."

MLS,3ds5cp,rabidfrodo,8,Sun Jul 19 02:32:10 2015 UTC,That might be because it was a blowout. Games when your team is overly dominant can cause fans to check out of the game/have little reason to motivate the team.
MLS,3ds5cp,jdl12358,6,Sun Jul 19 01:33:31 2015 UTC,"The weather isn't really any different in DC, and they have no problem getting big crowds for weekend afternoon games, so I'm not sure that's a good explanation.

MLS,3ds5cp,westcoastgeek,4,Sat Jul 18 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"Brooks is 22 like Ventura and younger by half a year and starts in the Bundesliga, a league where the quality gap betwen it and liga mx are enormous. Brooks goes regularly goes 90 almost every game of the season (you would have to go back to november to find a game he didn't go 90). Ventura has gone over 50 minutes in 3 of the last 9 games for America. It's honestly not even debatable which is more impressive but the truth is and ask any america fan he's been at best mediocre to solid at an inconsistent rate. He's contributed to at least 3 goals in this GC alone as well. The best he can hope for is to beat omar gonzalez who's got the least potential at 26 and plays at lowest quality league. That being said he hasn't shown to be a better defender and makes mistakes against non pros against Cuba. I haven't seen "" I think his ceiling is higher than any defenders on the team"" that you see at all. Outside of being younger than omar that's really the only positive or claim he can have for the position. He's 22 so you can't expect anything technical by this age just faith that he can get better with experience but I don't think he'll be anything more than solid. I also don't think he'll be starting for America as often as he did earlier in last season."

MLS,3ds5cp,sevenpasos,7,Sun Jul 19 08:44:16 2015 UTC,"I've been seeing a lot of comments on the attendance and they're way overblown. I was at the game and it was fantastic. Easily 45,000 people plus a pretty decent atmosphere (until it admittedly became a blowout). M&T Bank holds 71,000 so of course it looked bad on TV as a result."
MLS,3ds5cp,jdub3095,6,Sat Jul 18 23:36:25 2015 UTC,God damn it was hot at the game. I can understand why people wouldn't want to show up

MLS,3ds5cp,foggell44,2,Sat Jul 18 23:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was there too. So fucking hot. One advantage of the poor turnout was that we moved to the shaded end zone at half."
MLS,3ds5cp,msmouse05,8,Sun Jul 19 01:27:54 2015 UTC,Does anyone else think that Dempsey shouldn't be our penalty taker? The last two he's made have been chips up the middle. Other than those he's looked pretty bad from the spot.
MLS,3ds5cp,WhoStoleMyBacon,14,Sun Jul 19 02:39:05 2015 UTC,He triggers my PTSD when he goes up for a penalty.
MLS,3ds5cp,ZardesShotTheSheriff,0,Sat Jul 18 23:22:10 2015 UTC,The (almost) tres a cero?
MLS,3ds5cp,chasely,6,Sat Jul 18 23:23:29 2015 UTC,Who would you prefer?
MLS,3ds5cp,fresasandcrema,14,Sun Jul 19 15:11:39 2015 UTC,When he's on the field I'd give it to Johannsson. He's got the best technical finishing ability on the team. After him I feel Bradley would be better than Dempsey.
MLS,3ds5cp,WhoStoleMyBacon,5,Sat Jul 18 23:27:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really wanted Iceman to take it today, especially since he won the penalty.  I think he'd do really well."
MLS,3ds5cp,CaptMatty,4,Sat Jul 18 23:32:35 2015 UTC,some people have superstition about that. Sounds weird i know. But some take it as either bad karma or foul play for the guy fouled to take the penalty. Some people think that encourages diving.   tho i agree that Johannson should take more penalties.
MLS,3ds5cp,arm0redturkey,3,Sun Jul 19 01:50:05 2015 UTC,Oh wow I never knew that!   What happens if the guy who normally takes the penalty is the one who draws the penalty?
MLS,3ds5cp,CaptMatty,2,Sun Jul 19 04:12:28 2015 UTC,Its up to him. I played on a team with a guy like that once. Would NOT take one if he drew the foul. depends on the guy tho.
MLS,3ds5cp,arm0redturkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:29:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, taking a pen is far more.mental than it is technical or physical. All these guys have the technical and physical ability to score. The ones who are truly fantastic are the ones who are 100% confident. Look at Balotelli, who looks off the keeper nearly perfectly every t8me, or reads the dive. Or Townsend, who just doesn't give a fuck that the keeper know he's absolutely smashing it to a corner. He just does it and says good luck stopping that."
MLS,3ds5cp,smokey815,3,Sun Jul 19 18:45:41 2015 UTC,I completely agree that he hasn't looked good the last couple of times. I heard the commentators talking about who should take one of the free kicks and that the captain has some say. Does Bradley decide who takes them?
MLS,3ds5cp,ProudLlama,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:44:47 2015 UTC,I think it comes down to who's on the field and who steps up and wants to take the penalty. The players are usually fully aware of who the taker is beforehand.
MLS,3ds5cp,WhoStoleMyBacon,11,Sun Jul 19 02:58:18 2015 UTC,"Evans over Chandler, Brooks over Alvarado, and put Beasley in at LB and move FJ into midfield over Zardes. That's out best team."
MLS,3ds5cp,imbored48375,12,Sun Jul 19 11:41:17 2015 UTC,"With Yedlin as a ~60 min sub for either RB or RW, whichever player is more tired/looks bad."
MLS,3ds5cp,al_assad,0,Sat Jul 18 23:01:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And also I say this as someone who likes Zardes, but he isn't a natural midfielder. He should be played up top I think."
MLS,3ds5cp,imbored48375,10,Sat Jul 18 23:13:52 2015 UTC,I feel it's the opposite. He's looked a lot better out wide then he has up top so far.
MLS,3ds5cp,CaptMatty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:07:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, he's very young, I'd say its really early to say what hes best at. When he goes back to LA he'll likely get a lot of wide play in due to keane, dos santos, and gerrard combo. Then we'll know more."
MLS,3ds5cp,arm0redturkey,20,Sun Jul 19 01:48:39 2015 UTC,...Zardes has been killing it for the US all Gold Cup. No way would I drop him right now.
MLS,3ds5cp,AnalAttackProbe,13,Sun Jul 19 04:10:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know how you could sit Zardes as long as he has the energy to play."
MLS,3ds5cp,ilikebikes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this too, but I really do think that Zardes isn't necessarily a 90 minute player against top opposition. He struggles defensively in wide areas, in terms of when to stay with his man, or when to pass him on to the fullback. But you could probably play him out wide and be fine, even against Mexico or CR, but I just prefer playing people in their natural positions."
MLS,3ds5cp,imbored48375,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"Johnson at RB, Zardes at RM, Beasley at LB, Bedoya at LM"

MLS,3ds5cp,soundice,2,Sat Jul 18 23:02:32 2015 UTC,I hope Bradley plays better going forward because it won't be this easy in the next 2 games.
MLS,3ds5cp,ZardesShotTheSheriff,2,Sun Jul 19 00:30:43 2015 UTC,Glad Bradley gave Dempsey the opportunity for the hat trick today. Seems like there aren't hard feelings
MLS,3ds5cp,fresasandcrema,4,Sat Jul 18 23:07:38 2015 UTC,What? Did I miss something? Why would Bradley have hard feelings towards Dempsey?
MLS,3ds5cp,mjconns,7,Sat Jul 18 23:06:58 2015 UTC,I think he meant Dempsey having hard feelings.
MLS,3ds5cp,lightjedi5,2,Sat Jul 18 23:48:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, meant more that way."
MLS,3ds5cp,fresasandcrema,4,Sat Jul 18 23:58:54 2015 UTC,He probably is referring to the change of captains.

MLS,3ds5cp,ilikebikes,2,Sat Jul 18 23:59:40 2015 UTC,"We're a better team when he's not playing.   Right now, yes, but let's not be myopic about this and just ignore all of the positives he has provided for the U.S. for the last several years.  Was he bad in the first 2 matches? Yes. But as our lone big-body striker of quality for the last forever, he's under especially strong scrutiny."

You see a similar ideology in from the Russian NT, but whereas Russia has thrived since the wall came down, Cuba remains stuck in the 1950s.  edit: to clarify, there are Russian players in other leagues, but they often get overlooked.

MLS,3ds5cp,mattbonnerfan,19,Sat Jul 18 23:05:02 2015 UTC,He is.
MLS,3ds5cp,TheKingOfGhana,6,Sat Jul 18 23:25:23 2015 UTC,Walker started for Tottenham. Yedlin just arrived and needs to get the pace and conditioning for the English game. So as of right now walker is better than yedlin. Yedlin has potential to challenge for a starting spot but as of right now he is not
MLS,3ds5cp,Kkaeda,6,Sat Jul 18 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"I love the kid, but there's no way that Yedlin is better than Kyle Walker, or even Kieran Trippier for that matter."

MLS,3ds0dp,buckeyebearcat,15,Sat Jul 18 22:25:59 2015 UTC,finlay makes 6 figures. He doesn't care about the money. He wanted a chance to get known. Playing in Columbus no one knows him
MLS,3ds0dp,Sychael,9,Sun Jul 19 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"According to this always wildly inaccurate document, Finlay makes $142,500. His all star bonus of $40,000 is just over 1/3 of his entire salary. I'm sure he notices and cares. However he might not even get picked. If that happens I'll grab pitchforks along side you, until then I still think its the best of both worlds."
MLS,3ds0dp,buckeyebearcat,2,Sun Jul 19 05:28:45 2015 UTC,Wow didn't know the bonus is that big. You could buy an Audi for that. But IMO Finlay wants to play at the ASG. it would be huge for him. Although ultimately if he gets a usmnt call up he won't care about this
MLS,3ds0dp,rcstro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"Everything I've found online says he makes around $50k. Regardless, a $40k All-Star bonus is a significant chunk of change to everyone except maybe the highest paid players."
MLS,3ds0dp,buckeyebearcat,4,Sun Jul 19 03:27:32 2015 UTC,He makes around 50k?!?!?! They just realeased the mls salaries this week. Try adding a 1 to the front of that. He makes 142k

It's a different story if your schedule isn't tight that month or you're hosting (like the Quakes are next year). The Quakes have played seven matches in July and if we had an All Star, they'd potentially be involved in 8 different games. Crazy."

MLS,3ds0dp,TangledUpInAzul,2,Sat Jul 18 23:12:59 2015 UTC,"It fits for Moor, so I'm happy to take it!  Interesting comment on Powers in that thread. I agree that Pablo hasn't made much indication of Powers fitting his plan, and I think that's incredibly strange. I think the Dillons are far and away our most promising players. Eloundou is really starting to excite me and Sjoberg has a legitimate chance to be an MLS best XI center back in a few years, but Powers in particular is on an entirely different level. The guy deserves playing time, but Pablo is looking for a more defensive-minded player. I also think Pablo has struggled for a year and a half to find tactics that put the ball at Powers' feet more often. That's just bad coaching.  Powers could absolutely be a transfer target for many Serie A teams right now. If it means more time on the field in a system that suits his skills set, battling relegation in Italy is probably a much sexier option than Colorado's bench. The main difference is that in Italy, he'll play against teams like Juventus and be expected to compete. Pablo isn't giving Powers that opportunity or anything like it by benching him."
MLS,3ds0dp,director_leon,2,Sat Jul 18 23:51:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's disappointing, especially after Deshorn left. The youth of 2013 was so exciting (goddamn we had an amazing draft), and Gaby had just arrived at the end of the season. We snuck into the playoffs, and looked like we were seriously on the upswing. Then the Pareja rug got pulled from under us, and here we are. I agree, it's really not acceptable that Pablo still hasn't adapted to our franchise-ish players. He's kind of been pulling a Pareja with his overhaul, alienating the players brought in by the former regime. He was even on the other side of that when Oscar arrived, so I don't know what that's been his approach. But I know one thing. As much as I respect Pablo and exalt his accomplishments for this club, I don't think he's half the coach Oscar is."
MLS,3ds0dp,iamnotbadger,14,Sun Jul 19 00:14:51 2015 UTC,beltran? i thought Lawrence and Powell have been KILLING it.  finlay? got robbed and i dont think zusi belongs but other than that (and the 2 english blokes) it's a good team for sure. not sure rimando deserves it.

MLS,3ds0dp,just_the_best_party,6,Sun Jul 19 03:14:40 2015 UTC,Lloyd Sam is one of the best and most dangerous players in the league. It's laughable that he didn't make the cut. At least all of our boys will get some rest.
MLS,3ds0dp,ThatCanadianDuude,3,Sun Jul 19 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"no, I don't think he deserved it. Who should he be picked over?"
MLS,3ds0dp,just_the_best_party,4,Sat Jul 18 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"Zusi and Bradley and the players added by the Don. I understand why all of those players are going over Sam (or Findlay, Rolfe, Dax or Kitchen). However, Sam is not only better statistically than the above-mentioned All-Stars, but passes the eye test during every game. Few players (hell, teams) have had success stopping him when he runs down that right flank. More teams push second and third defenders to his side, allowing other members of our team freedom to move forward. Again, I completely understand why those going to the ASG are voted in and why far more deserving recipients are staying home. Just disappointing."
MLS,3ds0dp,ThatCanadianDuude,2,Sat Jul 18 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"yeah but taking out zusi, the next in line would be finlay. In fact, there would be alot of players ahead of him."

MLS,3dsc6g,Chug2778,12,Sun Jul 19 03:52:19 2015 UTC,I don't know what the point of having Jones and Mansaray is if Sigi will never let them play.
MLS,3dsc6g,PeperonyNChease,2,Sun Jul 19 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"Right? Neagle is not a forward. He actually puts pressure on defenders/goalies, but isn't good enough to be a reliable goal scoring threat without some major help. Jones has speed to get behind the defense and I haven't seen enough of Mansaray to know if he is any better than Barrett right now. But if this is all we have it's not looking good for the next month."

MLS,3dsc6g,pholland167,2,Sun Jul 19 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"What I'm referring to is that time and again over this season, when Dempsey and Martins are out, we crumble and go into a struggle mode. Add in Alonso's absence and our team is exposed for the lack of balance we should have. We need to invest in building out our midfield and especially our defense. And given our track record for collapsing in the playoffs, it's all the more alarming to see us struggling right now."
MLS,3dsc6g,mattfromseattle,6,Sun Jul 19 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that isn't a rebuilding year.  That is a ""Our top guys are so awesome that they get called up to the USMNT"" problem.  The Rapids don't have that problem.  You could get all 3 of those guys back to finish the season in top form, while what you're seeing here is the Rapids best product.  There is no way you guys lose to the Rapids with your full squad."

MLS,3dsc6g,steveotheguide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point. We rely way too much on Dempsey/Martins/Alonso. The defense is absolute shit anyways, now the midfield is struggling to try and help our forwards more to make things happen and it's leaving us completely exposed. We will most likely make the playoffs and collapse yet again."
MLS,3dsc6g,mattfromseattle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:09:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're being nihilistic. Yes clearly the whole team has problems right now. But I don't think you can isolate them like ""the defense sucks"". I think it's all connected. Our forwards can't hold up play so our midfield can't get set so our defense is exposed and our back up keeper gets left in the lurch. We clearly have some roster holes to fill but I think ""rebuilding year"" is a bit too much."

MLS,3dsjix,MatchThreadder,18,Sun Jul 19 01:14:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, everybody, now that we have a thread up, it's time for a little Soccer Vexillology Corner!  Tonight's theme is Washington DC and the DC metro area.    Starting things off, let's look at the three state flags that border the capital region.  Let's start strong, with the wonderful flag of Maryland. The Maryland flag is actually the heraldic banner of George Calvert, Lord Baltimore. The flag dates back to the 16th century, and is one of the most historically significant state flag designs. Maryland officially adopted this as their state flag on November 25, 1904. It is one of only four state flags without the color blue.  Before this design was officially adopted, a variant was used specifically by confederate separatists, known as the Crossland Banner.  Moving on, Virginia use a seal on blue design. Boring. Adopted in 1950, but needs a redesign.  We'll jump to West Virginia, who use a seal on white on blue. Still boring, but I'm not ranting tonight.    Now, we'll actually take a look at the flag of Washington DC. This flag is exceptional. It's based off George Washington's personal coat of arms, and is beautifully simple. DCU and the Washington Spirit have referenced this occasionally in their jerseys, which is such a good thing.    And now for a little bonus feature, from my Flags of MLS Teams projects, the flag of DC United featuring the eagle from the modern crest, and the flag of FC Dallas featuring some simplified hoops in our two traditional color schemes.    That's all for tonight's abbreviated edition of SVC. Keep watching match threads and I'll keep sharing flag trivia."

MLS,3dsjix,TalonDCU,0,Sun Jul 19 02:54:17 2015 UTC,Sick how both Dallas goals come off of deflected passes falling right to someone.
MLS,3dsjix,BryanW94,6,Sun Jul 19 03:00:21 2015 UTC,When you play the way Dallas did its not luck when you get those opportunities let alone capitalize on them.

MLS,3dsjix,Elguapo361,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:17:56 2015 UTC,The audio mix on CSN isn't helping.  Their crowd noise was quite muted.  Compare CSN:  https://youtu.be/LeE81SnnBp4?t=2m20s  vs the Dallas broadcast:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY6T6rzr278

MLS,3ds88g,i_enjoy_burritos,4,Sun Jul 19 01:33:31 2015 UTC,Great closing atmosphere
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,7,Sun Jul 19 01:32:51 2015 UTC,Sounded like most of the stadium joined in the REV-O-LU-TION. We try so hard in the Fort to get the rest of the stadium to join in. Good crowd tonight and vocal power just from sheer numbers.
MLS,3ds88g,datadyne007,17,Sun Jul 19 01:39:41 2015 UTC,I don't remember anyone dying this half? How can there be 6 minutes?
MLS,3ds88g,TrickyWinger,5,Sun Jul 19 01:27:00 2015 UTC,That's the bizarrest of several moves from this ref.
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,15,Sun Jul 19 01:28:18 2015 UTC,Bunburry the Foul sounds like a dude from LoTR.
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,15,Sun Jul 19 00:23:02 2015 UTC,Hey guys. How about we convert one or four of these. Thanks.
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,5,Sun Jul 19 00:11:33 2015 UTC,This game has been a fucking chaotic mess with lost conversions
MLS,3ds88g,nachomancandycabbage,14,Sun Jul 19 00:20:22 2015 UTC,Scott Caldwell is so good.

MLS,3ds88g,leorawrr,4,Sun Jul 19 01:33:22 2015 UTC,I love that you know exactly who I'm talking about.
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,2,Sun Jul 19 01:36:07 2015 UTC,I was just thinking that they needed to switch to a wide angle shot of the fort...
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,3,Sun Jul 19 01:46:39 2015 UTC,Hahahaha

MLS,3ds88g,i_enjoy_burritos,7,Sun Jul 19 01:22:52 2015 UTC,Lots of possessions lost by Villa trying to dribble through 2-3 defenders

MLS,3ds88g,ncquake24,4,Sun Jul 19 00:53:55 2015 UTC,Yeah the replay left no room for interpretation
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,13,Sun Jul 19 00:55:11 2015 UTC,GOOOOAAAAL!!! FINALLY SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT WITH THIS TEAM
MLS,3ds88g,musefanpl,7,Sat Jul 18 23:51:15 2015 UTC,This might be the most friendly NY - BOS sporting thread I have ever seen. Don't ruin it Stoica!
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,4,Sun Jul 19 00:05:55 2015 UTC,The players are pure class right now as well
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,4,Sun Jul 19 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Great goalkeeping (save that kick by BK), free flowing game, a few close no calls... overall really good so far.   Edit: stop getting lazy n chippy revs! Can't have a repeat from last week."
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,5,Sun Jul 19 00:08:32 2015 UTC,Seems to be a good start for NYCFC here. Good buildups but no finish yet.
MLS,3ds88g,omgahippy,5,Sat Jul 18 23:42:39 2015 UTC,So are we not doing black jerseys anymore?
MLS,3ds88g,fire815,5,Sun Jul 19 00:05:09 2015 UTC,"Most teams use their first choice jerseys whenever they can. If it clashes when they're away from home then they wear the second choice, in our case, blacks."

MLS,3ds88g,Jack_is_a_negro,5,Sun Jul 19 00:51:56 2015 UTC,What's the verdict?
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,4,Sun Jul 19 00:53:37 2015 UTC,I think that's a good call.
MLS,3ds88g,Jack_is_a_negro,2,Sun Jul 19 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, all favouritism aside. Stoica might be more inclined to make up for this now."
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,3,Sun Jul 19 00:56:26 2015 UTC,ayyy happy cakeday
MLS,3ds88g,TrickyWinger,2,Sun Jul 19 00:53:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! Didn't even notice.
MLS,3ds88g,Jack_is_a_negro,5,Sun Jul 19 00:54:36 2015 UTC,Now how can we manage to fuck this up?
MLS,3ds88g,Curse_of_the_Grackle,2,Sun Jul 19 00:54:53 2015 UTC,Don't worry.  If you fuck it up we'll return the favour.
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,3,Sun Jul 19 00:57:19 2015 UTC,It's going to be Farrell. Or Hall.  I hope I'm wrong
MLS,3ds88g,i_enjoy_burritos,5,Sun Jul 19 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"SO. MANY. CHANCES. Charlie is having such an off night, but the team is on point!"

MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,10,Sun Jul 19 01:27:05 2015 UTC,Come on you Revs!   Also that bastard Mullins better not score again.
MLS,3ds88g,peachesgp,2,Sat Jul 18 23:23:45 2015 UTC,Good start.
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,4,Sat Jul 18 23:41:31 2015 UTC,I cant even hate that was a great play
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,6,Sat Jul 18 23:51:55 2015 UTC,Just holding onto his arm like he was taking him out on a date... How's that at least not a foul?
MLS,3ds88g,ItinerantSoldier,4,Sun Jul 19 00:09:26 2015 UTC,"""I'm going to get this goal on camera and have so many twitter followers!"".... Deflection hits him on the top of the head."
MLS,3ds88g,Beoh,3,Sun Jul 19 00:10:14 2015 UTC,I think he is the teams social media guy. Which is still hilarious.
MLS,3ds88g,joogaluu,4,Sun Jul 19 03:18:01 2015 UTC,Belicheck would've approved of that tackle.
MLS,3ds88g,buckeyecilmpup,4,Sun Jul 19 00:21:57 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does Angelino kind of look like Macklemore?
MLS,3ds88g,EinsteinDisguised,2,Sun Jul 19 00:22:13 2015 UTC,The similarities start and end with the hair
MLS,3ds88g,ExternalTangents,2,Sun Jul 19 00:23:12 2015 UTC,He looks like he belongs on the USWNT
MLS,3ds88g,xDCWx,5,Sun Jul 19 00:23:30 2015 UTC,Would prefer if City scored between three and nine goals this half.
MLS,3ds88g,EinsteinDisguised,5,Sun Jul 19 00:42:03 2015 UTC,Lee's new haircut makes him look like a pheasant.
MLS,3ds88g,xDCWx,4,Sun Jul 19 00:42:27 2015 UTC,What?!
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,4,Sun Jul 19 00:50:35 2015 UTC,WTF?!
MLS,3ds88g,lazyflowingriver,4,Sun Jul 19 00:51:08 2015 UTC,"Hey Diago, shouldn't you be at EVO?"
MLS,3ds88g,buckeyecilmpup,4,Sun Jul 19 00:51:45 2015 UTC,"""Grabavoy out... Frank Lampard may be available to fill that spot"".   Oh shut up."
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,4,Sun Jul 19 00:52:50 2015 UTC,"That card is a shame. It reminds me a lot of Tierney's red card earlier this year. There wasn't any malice in it, but when your studs go into another player you're probably gonna get sent off."
MLS,3ds88g,ifleninwasawizard,4,Sun Jul 19 00:54:40 2015 UTC,Mullins was playing better than Villa...
MLS,3ds88g,lazyflowingriver,5,Sun Jul 19 00:55:48 2015 UTC,Wish we could find a player like Mullins.
MLS,3ds88g,Curse_of_the_Grackle,4,Sun Jul 19 00:59:15 2015 UTC,=(
MLS,3ds88g,datadyne007,4,Sun Jul 19 01:01:54 2015 UTC,Fagundez did an amazing job there.
MLS,3ds88g,SF129,4,Sun Jul 19 00:59:20 2015 UTC,Finally ordered my first NYCFC jersey!
MLS,3ds88g,Jack_is_a_negro,2,Sun Jul 19 01:04:13 2015 UTC,Nice which player?
MLS,3ds88g,fire815,4,Sun Jul 19 01:19:21 2015 UTC,Inanimate carbon rod!!
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,6,Sun Jul 19 01:05:54 2015 UTC,Fucking hell. I'd hate to see Nguyen in a light breeze.
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,5,Sun Jul 19 01:07:28 2015 UTC,That looked like a pen...
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,5,Sun Jul 19 01:12:47 2015 UTC,Fucks sake ref. That's a pen all day long.
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,5,Sun Jul 19 01:13:19 2015 UTC,Fucking Saunders has been wicked good today.
MLS,3ds88g,TrickyWinger,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:31 2015 UTC,Your boys been good too.
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,4,Sun Jul 19 01:22:18 2015 UTC,We aren't even trying
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,4,Sun Jul 19 01:32:21 2015 UTC,Well we're back to our April form. That was awful.
MLS,3ds88g,ExternalTangents,4,Sun Jul 19 01:34:40 2015 UTC,Gona sound weird but I really enjoyed this match thread. Nice and civil with some good discussion. Much better than last week...
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,2,Sun Jul 19 01:39:54 2015 UTC,Best match thread discussion I've seen in over a year of making match threads. Great job guys!!!
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"Playing against NYCFC usually brings out the worst in opposition fans I've noticed but New England really did themselves proud. I might be biased but I think our fans are always pretty civil,  humble and level headed."
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,9,Sun Jul 19 01:45:29 2015 UTC,Did the commentators seriously just accuse OUR players of being slow to get up??
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,3,Sun Jul 19 01:13:46 2015 UTC,Ha.  Seriously?  I'm watching the Sky feed. How would time-wasting possibly benefit us right now?
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,6,Sun Jul 19 01:18:47 2015 UTC,Yaaaayyy! Something to cheer for! That was a brilliant team goal... Lee Daigo and Diego working together like that is cheeky.
MLS,3ds88g,omgahippy,3,Sat Jul 18 23:53:03 2015 UTC,shit
MLS,3ds88g,ItinerantSoldier,3,Sat Jul 18 23:50:47 2015 UTC,Just a simple little goal there...
MLS,3ds88g,gchurst,3,Sat Jul 18 23:51:23 2015 UTC,brilliant. absolute gem from fagundez
MLS,3ds88g,nachomancandycabbage,4,Sat Jul 18 23:53:22 2015 UTC,Hernandez wtf did you block that?
MLS,3ds88g,lazyflowingriver,3,Sat Jul 18 23:53:23 2015 UTC,Yo Hernandez... you play for us...
MLS,3ds88g,YoPoppaCapa,3,Sat Jul 18 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, this thing where we have more goals than the other team is pretty neat.  I think we should keep doing it."
MLS,3ds88g,ItinerantSoldier,3,Sat Jul 18 23:55:34 2015 UTC,Was that a banner of two anime-styled Revs players? No hate. I just find that interesting...
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,5,Sat Jul 18 23:56:16 2015 UTC,No hate from me absolute love! I feel like im one of the few mls fans who loves anime
MLS,3ds88g,xDCWx,3,Sun Jul 19 00:02:18 2015 UTC,Angry Jay Heaps is my favorite Jay Heaps
MLS,3ds88g,VendettaR2007,3,Sat Jul 18 23:59:05 2015 UTC,I think Kobayashi should start when Jones is out. He atleast gives us some technical quality in midfield. All doorman does is foul.
MLS,3ds88g,kuyakew,3,Sun Jul 19 00:14:24 2015 UTC,Jesus. How did Davies miss that.
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,4,Sun Jul 19 00:18:08 2015 UTC,Villa is disappointing honestly
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,3,Sun Jul 19 00:19:48 2015 UTC,He needs help in midfield. There's no guile about the balls played into him.
MLS,3ds88g,VendettaR2007,3,Sun Jul 19 00:21:49 2015 UTC,Villa with the Phil Jones esque corner kick
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,3,Sun Jul 19 00:23:32 2015 UTC,What!?
MLS,3ds88g,franch,4,Sun Jul 19 00:50:55 2015 UTC,we got stoica'd
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,4,Sun Jul 19 00:52:02 2015 UTC,POOOOOKKKKKKUUUUUU
MLS,3ds88g,RockShrimp,4,Sun Jul 19 00:54:33 2015 UTC,Really? Poku for Mullins? Mullins couldn't finish so far but he was doing well
MLS,3ds88g,graph1k,3,Sun Jul 19 00:55:23 2015 UTC,You know what? Fagundez is pretty darn good.
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,5,Sun Jul 19 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"In free flowing games like this, yes. Especially with the additional space from the red. In tight well formed, physical games though, he can be hard to watch."
MLS,3ds88g,graph1k,3,Sun Jul 19 01:00:50 2015 UTC,"He is still only 20, the rest will (hopefully) come with time."
MLS,3ds88g,jdflyer,4,Sun Jul 19 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we probably won't have him for much longer unfortunately to see that growth... last young kid us rev fans were really keen on was this dude from Nagadoches you might have heard of :-)"
MLS,3ds88g,ExternalTangents,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:18 2015 UTC,It's remarkable how bad our guys have been at retaining possession tonight
MLS,3ds88g,daveedgamboa,4,Sun Jul 19 01:10:06 2015 UTC,Can't wait for pirlo and lampard. That should help a ton in the middle.
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,3,Sun Jul 19 01:10:53 2015 UTC,It'll help villa too
MLS,3ds88g,PunkRockJesus001,4,Sun Jul 19 01:11:16 2015 UTC,Alvarez is doodoo
MLS,3ds88g,_sicnarf,4,Sun Jul 19 01:21:32 2015 UTC,Nguyen on the ground? No way!?
MLS,3ds88g,Curse_of_the_Grackle,2,Sun Jul 19 01:25:11 2015 UTC,He's really soft on contact from behind.
MLS,3ds88g,i_enjoy_burritos,3,Sun Jul 19 01:26:46 2015 UTC,"Any rebound on that = goal. Well done, BK."
MLS,3ds88g,zipperoooo,3,Sun Jul 19 01:28:53 2015 UTC,"Finally, the streak ends.  Let's get back to it.  GG."
MLS,3ds88g,datadyne007,3,Sun Jul 19 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! WE WON... FINALLY!!!!! Incredible showing from the whole freaking team tonight. The Revs are back, baby!"
MLS,3ds88g,FPSCameron,3,Sun Jul 19 01:34:57 2015 UTC,Honesty glad Grabavoy got a red card. Him not playing the next game can only be a positive for us.
MLS,3ds88g,Plastic_Mouldsman,2,Sun Jul 19 01:48:20 2015 UTC,I'm glad because it was the correct decision. It'd have sucked for that challenge to have gone unpunished. Ref had a decent game actually.
MLS,3ds88g,xDCWx,5,Sun Jul 19 01:58:15 2015 UTC,GG Daigo
MLS,3ds88g,datadyne007,6,Sun Jul 19 01:16:18 2015 UTC,That backheel. Beauty.

MLS,3ds88g,PreztoElite,3,Sun Jul 19 01:12:43 2015 UTC,We won! Wow. You can spend money but you can't beat the revs!
MLS,3ds88g,Knick_Noled,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:53 2015 UTC,anyone have a feed?

He wasn't making that play against Colorado.  EDIT: I mean he definitely gave the ball away a ton against Colorado, but this time it seemed like he felt bad about it."
MLS,3dsfbz,irondeepbicycle,8,Sun Jul 19 03:43:31 2015 UTC,Yeah but I don't feel like applauding him for something he should be doing.

MLS,3dsfbz,irondeepbicycle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:24:33 2015 UTC,Nice. Thanks. How do you feel about the trade?
MLS,3dsfbz,DEEEEEEEJ,5,Sun Jul 19 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"Personally?  Sabo is 33, he was the second highest paid player on the team, and he noticeably declined.  We get a lot of cap flexibility, and potentially a terrific young player in Silva.  So I like it a lot."
MLS,3dsfbz,irondeepbicycle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:33:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really felt Sabo gave up a lot on balls compared to Plato who runs his ass off. Don't get me wrong, Sabo has a lethal foot but I can see him getting lazy."

MLS,3dsfbz,SaltyShakespeare,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:26:55 2015 UTC,Dudes flopping on the ground like a fish out of water. It's a yellow but cmon man
MLS,3dsfbz,fingerblasters69,-3,Sun Jul 19 03:18:47 2015 UTC,Thats not a red
MLS,3dsfbz,89vision,2,Sun Jul 19 03:18:48 2015 UTC,"Studs up but what sealed it was the scissor. If that back leg didn't swing like that I would agree, but that's a dangerous tackle."
MLS,3dte7d,irondeepbicycle,20,Sun Jul 19 07:18:49 2015 UTC,"For me, it looks pretty clear.  I'm a big fan of Kofi, but the contact itself isn't what warrants the red card. It is a red card for dangerous play, to me. Sarkodie leaves both of his feet and comes in flying recklessly in a scissor challenge at the ankles of the RSL player.  Its reckless and could easily have broken an ankle, regardless of whether he got the ball or not."
MLS,3dte7d,Shuttrking,3,Sun Jul 19 08:02:49 2015 UTC,"not sure if were seeing the same thing but he definitely does not leave both feet. his left foot is on the ground the whole time. but yes scissor motion never earns you any favors in referee's eyes. Perhaps if he'd learn to use his left foot and slide across this wouldn't of been an issue. It also looks like he was trying to slide in front to block the pass and caught player with trailing leg because of poor angle of pursuit. Neverless, he should of never went into tackle there and most likely got what he deserved."
MLS,3dte7d,cocadega,-5,Mon Jul 20 06:19:17 2015 UTC,"It is a red card for dangerous play, to me.   You don't get reds for ""dangerous play,"" you get them for ""serious foul play.""  ""Dangerous Play"" - just going about business dangerously and a message from the ref needs to be sent - is cautioned under the catch-all ""unsporting behavior.""  Dangerous play happens often in a game. If the referee gave a red for it, he'd set the bar for any dangerous play getting reds.  To the ref, this particular foul was serious, not just dangerous, and elevated itself to red."
MLS,3dte7d,grnrngr,6,Sun Jul 19 14:44:26 2015 UTC,"A bit pedantic, but yes, you are correct. Serious foul play is what the letter of the law requires, which this play fulfills for the reasons I stated, IMO."
MLS,3dte7d,Shuttrking,12,Sun Jul 19 16:55:24 2015 UTC,"If you want to clean MLS up from dangerous and rough play, this is a pretty blatant red."
MLS,3dte7d,erockarmy1,9,Sun Jul 19 12:35:00 2015 UTC,I have no problem with a red card here.
MLS,3dte7d,kookingpot,8,Sun Jul 19 11:55:59 2015 UTC,Dangerous play is dangerous.
MLS,3dte7d,A_Supreme_Taco,5,Sun Jul 19 08:29:24 2015 UTC,Looks orange to me.  He leaves both feet and comes in hard. I'm okay with red here.
MLS,3dte7d,seadondo,5,Sun Jul 19 08:48:46 2015 UTC,Yup.  Red.
MLS,3dte7d,choch2727,4,Sun Jul 19 14:19:47 2015 UTC,That's bleeding red.
MLS,3dte7d,purplehusky16,3,Sun Jul 19 14:36:38 2015 UTC,Absolutely. no question on the red.
MLS,3dte7d,ravegreener,4,Sun Jul 19 16:26:45 2015 UTC,It would be a more compelling discussion if the play to be judged wasn't so blatantly red card worthy.
MLS,3dte7d,Raff_Out_Loud,3,Sun Jul 19 17:14:26 2015 UTC,I would say that it could be a light red or a strong yellow because those scissor fouls are so dangerous.
MLS,3dte7d,mankindrc,2,Sun Jul 19 07:52:39 2015 UTC,"It looked like the right call, to me. Cleats out towards any player make it hard to judge the severity of the attack, but this seemed like the right call."
MLS,3dte7d,knudude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"The player shouldn't have put the referee in a position to make a call like that.  It was a bad play.  I could see an argument for red or yellow, maybe you get the red card 3 times out of ten, but that's the risk you take in doing something like that."
MLS,3dte7d,cojiba,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like he tackled with his groin more so than his legs. Not sure how that's dangerous for anyone other than Kofi. Potentially dangerous though, is that the definition for a red?  Edit: looked at it more. It's red worthy."
MLS,3dte7d,gabot045,-14,Sun Jul 19 21:52:12 2015 UTC,"hm coming off zero context, i would say not a straight red. he almost kicked the ball."
MLS,3dte7d,burndestroywreckkill,4,Sun Jul 19 07:35:23 2015 UTC,I am not clear on what more context you need other than actual video of the event.
MLS,3dte7d,leo_eris,0,Sun Jul 19 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"hey other people here said soft red or strong yellow.  pretty much what i was thinkin. context being.. is this the players first foul of the game, or has he had a few. if he already had a couple fouls or maybe even 1, i'd say red."

MLS,3drwp0,JonstheSquire,74,Sun Jul 19 01:13:01 2015 UTC,That's not a red...
MLS,3drwp0,IAmZeDoctor,19,Sun Jul 19 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"I'm no ref expert, but I'm not sure if that was really yellow worthy either.  It was a bit sloppy, but it was in front and he was sliding to intercept the ball, not to try to strip the ball."
MLS,3drwp0,Grogie,9,Sun Jul 19 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"I used to be a certified ref. It could be a yellow but it was a fairly slow tackle and not really that reckless, so a soft yellow. I would not have given the card at all. Certainly not excessive force. This, unlike Kaka's, doesn't really have an excuse for making the call because the speed and aggression was clearly not malicious. You could say studs up but the speed again was not really threatening and in no way a red. A mind boggling call."
MLS,3drwp0,duremville,4,Sun Jul 19 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"I've been re-watching the gif from the OCFC twitter.  In a sense I would argue what he did was safer than trying to run through the ball.    https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/CKPHvyrWUAEEPA8.mp4  I mean he is not trying to tackle, he is trying to intercept the ball.  The Red Bull guy is trying to make a play on the ball as well.     His cleats aren't that high either."
MLS,3drwp0,Grogie,3,Sun Jul 19 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"When I think of studs up, I think of the leg extended upwards so that the leg is not parallel to the ground. This could be very wrong but that's how I have always interpreted it.  I think you would be hard pressed to find very many slide tackles that do not have studs visible. Players do not point their toes when they attempt a tackle. As long as you aren't pointing your studs high towards the body or upper legs, I don't see it as a foul unless you make contact."

MLS,3drwp0,Schmetterlingus,12,Sun Jul 19 01:46:43 2015 UTC,"Wow.... that's def a foul, but a straight red card? Kinda soft. Stupid challenge though I guess."
MLS,3drwp0,Disco99,13,Sun Jul 19 00:12:36 2015 UTC,This game is a poor representation of what these teams are capable of. The ref is clearly attempting to exert his influence (not for either team) on the game.
MLS,3drwp0,jp4est,24,Sun Jul 19 01:21:53 2015 UTC,Fucking love Inchy
MLS,3drwp0,kerfufflest,34,Sun Jul 19 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"Not a two footed challenge. Studs up, but no contact. Silly, stupid by Larin. But the ref and 4th official had a good view. It is at their discretion, but I think that is reckless play, for a yellow... a red this early is just unnecessary."
MLS,3drwp0,trainerN,39,Sun Jul 19 00:22:29 2015 UTC,"As someone who is a huge fan of Orlando City, it really does make the game a lot less enjoyable when a player is red carded just about every game due to poor referee decisions."
MLS,3drwp0,whtge8,4,Sun Jul 19 00:16:40 2015 UTC,Same. I just want to see a fair match for both sides. If we lose then we got just got outplayed. I don't want the ref to have this big of an impact on the game.

MLS,3drwp0,zrowny,20,Sat Jul 18 21:47:56 2015 UTC,I think I made this gif even better
MLS,3drwp0,DABOSSROSS9,6,Sat Jul 18 22:28:15 2015 UTC,Wat is this from
MLS,3drwp0,aquaknox,6,Sat Jul 18 22:14:30 2015 UTC,"No idea, I found it on /r/all"
MLS,3drwp0,JonstheSquire,20,Sat Jul 18 22:15:54 2015 UTC,I would say a yellow.  Stupid tackle for Larin though.  No need to make that challenge in that position.
MLS,3drwp0,gatorBlahz,11,Sun Jul 19 00:11:20 2015 UTC,"It wasn't even a yellow, he made no contact. Total bullshit call."
MLS,3drwp0,Wheaties466,3,Sun Jul 19 00:16:25 2015 UTC,The red bull player saw studs up and the contact came when he jumped into him on his way down. Smart by the player to see that but I'm disappointed in the ref already.
MLS,3drwp0,warl0ck08,21,Sun Jul 19 00:35:05 2015 UTC,This stadium as a whole is pissed. If this was South America (and zero offense against you guys) this ref would have problems after the game. I'm not so certain there won't be a crowd there tonight booing them walking them to the cars.   Other note. The red bulls goal was an absolute rocket. One of the best goals I've seen live all year. Can't hate that.
MLS,3drwp0,kasrkinsquad,13,Sun Jul 19 00:35:47 2015 UTC,If this was South America someone would have been killed by now and riot police would be in the stadium battling it out with fans.
MLS,3drwp0,just_the_best_party,32,Sun Jul 19 00:38:01 2015 UTC,These people being picked up on the sideline mic are insufferable idiots who clearly don't know the game. I'd rather listen to Shep.
MLS,3drwp0,knightinchina,15,Sun Jul 19 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"""Drink that Gatorade!"" Lol."
MLS,3drwp0,Disturbedguru,21,Sun Jul 19 00:24:16 2015 UTC,That is just good advice... It seems to be hot in Orlando
MLS,3drwp0,IAmZeDoctor,11,Sun Jul 19 00:25:43 2015 UTC,"Gatorade was developed by the University of Florida to help combat dehydration in the hot Florida climate. It provided aid to the Gators, thus Gatorade."

MLS,3drwp0,readbelow,8,Sun Jul 19 00:41:57 2015 UTC,Just got back from playing soccer in Orlando. Can confirm: hot as fuck
MLS,3drwp0,art44,26,Sun Jul 19 00:35:09 2015 UTC,"That wasn't a red, but then again Grella got fouled incredibly hard earlier and nothing happened. This is a bad ref."
MLS,3drwp0,whtge8,13,Sun Jul 19 00:11:17 2015 UTC,A bad ref in MLS? Shocker.
MLS,3drwp0,nyran20,18,Sun Jul 19 00:20:47 2015 UTC,Shout out to my 80ish Viking Army boys and girls who made the trek from NY!

MLS,3drwp0,NuggetMuffler,17,Sat Jul 18 23:28:29 2015 UTC,You know it's bad when the Red Bulls flairs agree
MLS,3drwp0,Disturbedguru,19,Sun Jul 19 00:12:33 2015 UTC,No one likes soft red cards... Such an exciting game... Now potentially ruined
MLS,3drwp0,kasrkinsquad,11,Sun Jul 19 00:14:00 2015 UTC,Definitely a dive. No question. Probably should have been a yellow though.
MLS,3drwp0,Bwignite24,25,Sun Jul 19 00:14:56 2015 UTC,Why are the refs so quick to pull the red in this league.
MLS,3drwp0,JonstheSquire,8,Sun Jul 19 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think the league has long been ridiculed for being too physical.  Now that they have all these big name skill players I would not be surprised if MLS told the refs to clamp down on rough play in order to give the likes of Kaka, Pirlo, Dos Santos, Giovinco, and Villa an opportunity to shine."
MLS,3drwp0,Hustler_One,7,Sun Jul 19 00:21:02 2015 UTC,Because the quality of the refs in MLS are barely a step above a Sunday league.
MLS,3drwp0,Banthrau,8,Sun Jul 19 00:22:26 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to see what Ashe can bring to this lineup. Just wish Brek wasn't out (Although I guess he would've played Cuba tonight, not Jersey)"
MLS,3drwp0,Bwignite24,8,Sat Jul 18 23:03:41 2015 UTC,Im cant complain about that call because the salt card will be pulled out and I will be sent off this thread.
MLS,3drwp0,MrBlakx,3,Sun Jul 19 00:44:13 2015 UTC,lol salt card
MLS,3drwp0,Menessy27,3,Sun Jul 19 00:45:46 2015 UTC,lol u mad broo?? salty AF Xd xD

MLS,3drwp0,MrBlakx,21,Sun Jul 19 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"""I hope this call doesnt ruin what was shaping up to be a fantastic game.""  Too late buddy."
MLS,3drwp0,IAmZeDoctor,17,Sun Jul 19 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, ref just ruined it. Soft and terrible doesn't even begin to describe how shitty of a call that was."
MLS,3drwp0,StephenGold79,15,Sun Jul 19 00:14:31 2015 UTC,Defend Inchy at all costs task force
MLS,3drwp0,DevilsDung,7,Sun Jul 19 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"-""do you or have you ever soccered?"" -""Yes""  Congrats you're an MLS ref"
MLS,3drwp0,whtge8,7,Sun Jul 19 00:49:12 2015 UTC,We suck at crossing.
MLS,3drwp0,mikesicle,7,Sun Jul 19 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"Damnit, fucking Grellinho."
MLS,3drwp0,irishstevenj,7,Sun Jul 19 01:28:00 2015 UTC,Mike Grella is kind of this Red Bulls team personified. Cheap and certainly almost unheard of but seems to know what he does well and makes the most of it.
MLS,3drwp0,IAmZeDoctor,13,Sun Jul 19 01:46:52 2015 UTC,What a laser!  Also what the fuck is with the actual laser shining at Sacha after the goal? Is that normal in the Citrus Bowl?
MLS,3drwp0,trainerN,13,Sun Jul 19 00:00:24 2015 UTC,No.
MLS,3drwp0,kasrkinsquad,13,Sun Jul 19 00:09:37 2015 UTC,It was such a dive.
MLS,3drwp0,Ryan05055,16,Sun Jul 19 00:10:55 2015 UTC,What a dive
MLS,3drwp0,checkonechecktwo,6,Sun Jul 19 00:11:29 2015 UTC,Edwards on the bench tonight for Orlando is really exciting to me.
MLS,3drwp0,TomTom_on_a_Tauntaun,3,Sat Jul 18 23:23:55 2015 UTC,He's definitely outplayed Ricketts.
MLS,3drwp0,moon_monster,6,Sat Jul 18 23:36:31 2015 UTC,"""You look like a pedophile with that mustache. Stranger danger!!"" lol"
MLS,3drwp0,DABOSSROSS9,6,Sat Jul 18 23:41:13 2015 UTC,Why does shep always downplay the redbull. I don't expect a homer but he always seems to think we're going to lose and if we win we were fortunate.
MLS,3drwp0,tk423,7,Sat Jul 18 23:44:06 2015 UTC,Because hes a Cosmos fan. And frankly he sucks as a commentator.
MLS,3drwp0,just_the_best_party,3,Sat Jul 18 23:44:52 2015 UTC,Wooooooooooooooow
MLS,3drwp0,ImYellingTimbers,4,Sat Jul 18 23:48:18 2015 UTC,He's the redundant combination of an idiot and a Cosmos homer.
MLS,3drwp0,robm0n3y,5,Sat Jul 18 23:46:01 2015 UTC,He's the drunk uncle that wants you to do good so he always points out your faults.
MLS,3drwp0,JonstheSquire,3,Sat Jul 18 23:48:36 2015 UTC,I like his attitude.  The Red Bulls are deserving of nothing but suspicion and cynicism.
MLS,3drwp0,DABOSSROSS9,3,Sat Jul 18 23:52:08 2015 UTC,thats true with or f.o but team on the field has been solid.
MLS,3drwp0,pinata_penis_pump2,6,Sat Jul 18 23:59:21 2015 UTC,Felipe should not be allowed to take shots
MLS,3drwp0,just_the_best_party,6,Sat Jul 18 23:56:48 2015 UTC,Felipe needs to stop shooting.
MLS,3drwp0,Disturbedguru,6,Sat Jul 18 23:56:52 2015 UTC,Wait... What the fuck just happened...
MLS,3drwp0,irishstevenj,6,Sun Jul 19 00:10:21 2015 UTC,Wow. Larin's not really challenging it though.
MLS,3drwp0,RubeRx,6,Sun Jul 19 00:10:57 2015 UTC,Canada cursed Larin
MLS,3drwp0,NuggetMuffler,6,Sun Jul 19 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"Orlando fans, it's great that we are passionate, but can we not embarrass ourselves in the process?"
MLS,3drwp0,StephenGold79,6,Sun Jul 19 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"The ball kick away is a yellow. It's gonna happen. Have to be smarter, regardless of how we feel about any ref"
MLS,3drwp0,warl0ck08,6,Sun Jul 19 01:04:49 2015 UTC,RedBull fans. We have no idea what this ref is calling either. Sorry. Pro refs suck. This stadium is really confused.
MLS,3drwp0,PBRontheway,6,Sun Jul 19 01:09:56 2015 UTC,Is anyone else just sick of hearing that one woman near the microphone on the msg broadcast?
MLS,3drwp0,hello_my_name_is_dog,6,Sun Jul 19 01:18:00 2015 UTC,Why can't MLS have good refs? This guy sucked for both sides. I'm impressed with how we played man down though.
MLS,3drwp0,Bolivia_USA,11,Sun Jul 19 01:44:28 2015 UTC,Like I said last week... THIS FUCKING REF
MLS,3drwp0,IAmZeDoctor,11,Sun Jul 19 00:11:08 2015 UTC,Lade could've been given a yellow on that interference on Kaka
MLS,3drwp0,AnthonyNice,11,Sun Jul 19 00:23:18 2015 UTC,Or with this guy probably 2 straight reds for emphasis
MLS,3drwp0,beefncheez712,12,Sun Jul 19 00:31:30 2015 UTC,Shouldn't have been a red. The NYRB goal should not have been called off. These refs are making it really hard for me to keep watching MLS games..
MLS,3drwp0,midnight_thunder,10,Sun Jul 19 00:35:59 2015 UTC,The fans being picked up on the MSG feed are hilarious.

MLS,3drwp0,thruball,5,Sun Jul 19 00:11:26 2015 UTC,That's a bad call...probably will get that suspension taken back.
MLS,3drwp0,JustinLyntz,9,Sun Jul 19 00:12:38 2015 UTC,If we didn't appeal Kaka's we won't appeal that
MLS,3drwp0,nautika,7,Sun Jul 19 00:13:31 2015 UTC,I doubt Orlando will appeal.  They didn't appeal Kaka's red when everyone thought that would have been taken back.
MLS,3drwp0,robm0n3y,5,Sun Jul 19 00:13:42 2015 UTC,Some times I think I'm the only one who likes Shep. He's so comical.
MLS,3drwp0,pinata_penis_pump2,5,Sun Jul 19 00:38:02 2015 UTC,He's just a goofy fuck.  I bet he drives by Studio 54 every night hoping it re-opens.

MLS,3drwp0,whtge8,13,Sun Jul 19 02:43:04 2015 UTC,Lol of course a straight red.
MLS,3drwp0,overscore_,12,Sun Jul 19 00:10:33 2015 UTC,Weak as fuck

MLS,3drwp0,Widan,9,Sun Jul 19 00:14:00 2015 UTC,Once again the ref has dictated the game for us.   This is our third game with a red card in a row.

MLS,3drwp0,Russki75,12,Sun Jul 19 00:10:16 2015 UTC,This happens every week to us
MLS,3drwp0,whtge8,11,Sun Jul 19 00:11:54 2015 UTC,These refs are really making MLS games hard to watch. They have way too big of an impact every single game.
MLS,3drwp0,beefncheez712,8,Sun Jul 19 00:14:18 2015 UTC,Starting to look like the same team from the beginning of the season. All those shots but nobody can put one away
MLS,3drwp0,mikesicle,8,Sun Jul 19 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree, we looked great tonight, especially for being a man down. Kaka's game off helped him, he looked much better, and Ceren had a good game. Maybe Larin would have helped us with our chances, but it's not like we had none like earlier this season."

MLS,3ds340,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"A drop-ball is the method for restarting play when play is stopped with the ball still in bounds. Usually this will happen when a player is injured.  In almost all cases, the drop-ball is uncontested. That is, only one player will line up, and he'll kick it all the way up the field for the other team.  In rare cases the drop-ball is contested, meaning a player from each team will line up, and the drop-ball works a bit like a faceoff in hockey."

MLS,3ds31g,DefsNotTheBatman,3,Sun Jul 19 01:34:47 2015 UTC,Benny could potentially be played anywhere in a diamond midfield (if that's what Jurgen wants to use) but he'd probably be at his best at the tip of the diamond with Bradley behind him as one of the shuttlers.

MLS,3ds31g,Moniker_71,8,Sun Jul 19 00:29:05 2015 UTC,A medium Mello Yello I refilled from a coke freestyle machine as I left a pizzeria earlier today.  I'm underage.
MLS,3ds31g,DefsNotTheBatman,5,Sun Jul 19 00:35:26 2015 UTC,Mello Yello is incredible. Props to respecting drinking rules : )
MLS,3ds31g,willOTW,2,Sun Jul 19 00:36:45 2015 UTC,"I've had a couple of sips of beer before and it just doesn't taste good to me. I've tried a little red wine (about 2 sips whenever family gets together) and its alright, but I would say anymore than a third of a glass and it would start to taste bad."
MLS,3ds31g,EnabledHorizon,3,Sun Jul 19 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"One day it will be good, it took me til 22 to enjoy it. No need to rush. Just remember, it is like spices. It's meant to make the food taste better. Pair it with food and you'll respect it more."
MLS,3ds31g,FantasyToaster,2,Sun Jul 19 00:42:28 2015 UTC,THIS.

MLS,3ds31g,RockheadRumple,2,Sun Jul 19 00:35:12 2015 UTC,I got a summer mix pack of Sam Adams. Not the worst thing I've had this summer.
MLS,3ds31g,shamusisaninja,2,Sun Jul 19 00:34:18 2015 UTC,Sippin on some Four Roses small batch and have some KC Pils in the fridge
MLS,3ds31g,DRUNK_SALVY_PEREZ,2,Sun Jul 19 00:37:29 2015 UTC,Never had Four Roses. I've poured some Jameson Select Reserve Black Barrel.
MLS,3ds31g,willOTW,2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:47 2015 UTC,"Nice! Four Roses is good, especially for the $."
MLS,3ds31g,Lotheric,2,Sun Jul 19 00:45:05 2015 UTC,I'll have to look into it.
MLS,3ds31g,Ralston_Cove,2,Sun Jul 19 00:45:57 2015 UTC,Thinking about either popping a Boulevard Smokestack or Lagunitas IPA bomber.
MLS,3ds31g,Natrone011,2,Sun Jul 19 00:37:58 2015 UTC,Whiskey and coke.
MLS,3ds31g,impactfandan,2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:24 2015 UTC,Vodka and the contents of my refrigerator.
MLS,3ds31g,SuperVehicle001,2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:24 2015 UTC,Budwiser Black Crown. Surprisingly good for an AB lager

MLS,3ds31g,justanavrgguy,5,Sun Jul 19 01:15:39 2015 UTC,This game is hard to watch.
MLS,3ds31g,willOTW,4,Sun Jul 19 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"I was wary when Gruenebaum was announced as the color commentator for us.  But he has really impressed me.  He seems to embrace the fact he doesn't know much about ""traditional"" commentating and it just works.  Funny irreverent, insightful, and wonderfully awkward.    good stuff."

MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,3,Sat Jul 18 23:48:48 2015 UTC,This is exactly the image I have in my mind as well
MLS,3ds31g,shamusisaninja,2,Sat Jul 18 23:59:08 2015 UTC,Chokeburg plays for Montreal now?
MLS,3ds31g,SlickFlip,7,Sat Jul 18 23:41:23 2015 UTC,Pre-Match hot take:   Montreal smoked meat is literally heresy.

MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,4,Sun Jul 19 00:26:04 2015 UTC,KC BBQ > Montreal smoked meat
MLS,3ds31g,SoulxxBondz,3,Sun Jul 19 00:33:27 2015 UTC,Kei getting left off the fan ballot is atrocious.
MLS,3ds31g,DefsNotTheBatman,3,Sun Jul 19 00:12:16 2015 UTC,all I want for christmans is a Dom Dwyer hat trick
MLS,3ds31g,Star-Lord11,5,Sun Jul 19 00:35:29 2015 UTC,This is...mildly...is erotic the right word here?
MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,4,Sun Jul 19 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"He said he was nude under the costume, so yes. Erotic is accurate."
MLS,3ds31g,impactfandan,4,Sun Jul 19 00:37:06 2015 UTC,Ok Sporting Blue and White jerseys are a bit too close for me.
MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,4,Sun Jul 19 00:40:58 2015 UTC,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!  1-0 SKC!
MLS,3ds31g,Natrone011,4,Sun Jul 19 00:43:11 2015 UTC,Fast start tonight!

MLS,3ds31g,UsernamIsToo,3,Sun Jul 19 00:43:46 2015 UTC,Allez Montreal!.....wait a second....I don't think that works here.
MLS,3ds31g,DefsNotTheBatman,3,Sun Jul 19 00:43:48 2015 UTC,It's only going to get worse for us.
MLS,3ds31g,UsernamIsToo,4,Sun Jul 19 00:44:01 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that almost foams at the mouth when Dom gets that close to a keeper?
MLS,3ds31g,SuperVehicle001,8,Sun Jul 19 00:48:21 2015 UTC,All the ladies get a bit frothy as well.
MLS,3ds31g,Natrone011,3,Sun Jul 19 00:49:51 2015 UTC,Montreal's defense does not look good right now...
MLS,3ds31g,DefsNotTheBatman,3,Sun Jul 19 00:52:23 2015 UTC,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!  2-0 KC
MLS,3ds31g,willOTW,4,Sun Jul 19 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"Whelp, just another goal and Dom hits his average against the Impact."
MLS,3ds31g,frozensalad,3,Sun Jul 19 01:14:29 2015 UTC,ALMOST AGAIN!
MLS,3ds31g,benmaney1,3,Sun Jul 19 01:19:47 2015 UTC,"Dom's on point tonight! 3 clear cut chances already, love watching him play  EDIT: Ahhh, I love the Cauldron. If I had the wings of a sparrow..."

MLS,3ds31g,impactfandan,4,Sun Jul 19 01:22:04 2015 UTC,Credit to him for those two amazing saves despite the shoddy line in front of him.
MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,4,Sun Jul 19 01:24:38 2015 UTC,Kevin Ellis has been great this year.
MLS,3ds31g,bosnjak,4,Sun Jul 19 01:23:50 2015 UTC,Our radio PBP guy just said he isn't sure if he's ever seen a half end with no stoppage time....
MLS,3ds31g,SlickFlip,3,Sun Jul 19 01:26:58 2015 UTC,So what're we imbibing of? QT frozen lemonade for me. Shits cash
MLS,3ds31g,bosnjak,3,Sun Jul 19 01:29:29 2015 UTC,Bourbon.  Wanna fight?
MLS,3ds31g,bosnjak,2,Sun Jul 19 01:33:50 2015 UTC,What kind of bourbon?
MLS,3ds31g,shunna75,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:07 2015 UTC,Beam.  I aint fancy
MLS,3ds31g,SlickFlip,2,Sun Jul 19 01:44:08 2015 UTC,Beam for mixed drinks but for bourbon neat or on the rocks Dark Horse is the way to go!
MLS,3ds31g,nimik,2,Sun Jul 19 01:48:30 2015 UTC,Some of us don't have access to Dark Horse and forgot to buy a bottle before leaving Kansas grumble grumble
MLS,3ds31g,SlickFlip,2,Sun Jul 19 01:52:38 2015 UTC,I respect that.
MLS,3ds31g,EnabledHorizon,2,Sun Jul 19 01:51:24 2015 UTC,Sangria right now.

MLS,3ds31g,impactfandan,3,Sun Jul 19 01:45:09 2015 UTC,That's really great given how hot it is.
MLS,3ds31g,EnabledHorizon,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:04 2015 UTC,You can see our guys are playing with heavy heads.
MLS,3ds31g,DefsNotTheBatman,4,Sun Jul 19 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"Did the announcer just say, ""You can't call the same play the other way now?  You gotta be consistent."" ?"
MLS,3ds31g,serious_black,2,Sun Jul 19 01:47:56 2015 UTC,"Not the best announcing team, I gotta say."
MLS,3ds31g,beach-bum,4,Sun Jul 19 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"Oduro as a winger = goals. Oduro as a striker = no goals. How can't this shitty coach understand that? We need a ST DP, we need something new. This is getting sad."
MLS,3ds31g,walking_bass,3,Sun Jul 19 01:48:03 2015 UTC,Like why wouldn't you throw on Jackson-Hamel at this point? Oduro as a lone striker doesn't work. It's not rocket science.
MLS,3ds31g,fluffy_muffins,2,Sun Jul 19 01:52:35 2015 UTC,"To continue on how awful Klopas is, I am predicting a ~60th min useless CDM change (Bernier or NRC)."

MLS,3ds31g,shamusisaninja,2,Sun Jul 19 02:02:36 2015 UTC,Fuck this coach. Can anyone tell me how this stupid substitution can help us win the game?
MLS,3ds31g,Tourtiere,4,Sun Jul 19 02:03:50 2015 UTC,Ellis....what was that?
MLS,3ds31g,KQ17,4,Sun Jul 19 01:54:14 2015 UTC,At least Piatti is doing his goddamn job.
MLS,3ds31g,acey91,4,Sun Jul 19 01:54:49 2015 UTC,"Since we need a goal, why would we just exchange CDMs? Wouldn't bringing in Jackson-Hamel or Tissot make more sense?"
MLS,3ds31g,acey91,3,Sun Jul 19 02:05:39 2015 UTC,Not only did he go position for position. He put in a defensive minded NRC instead of an attack minded Bernier. Lol.
MLS,3ds31g,willOTW,4,Sun Jul 19 02:06:37 2015 UTC,We are really looking tired here.
MLS,3ds31g,SoulxxBondz,4,Sun Jul 19 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"Way to fix your divot, Dom."
MLS,3ds31g,acey91,3,Sun Jul 19 02:12:36 2015 UTC,"c'mon Jackson, make me want to buy your jersey."
MLS,3ds31g,Star-Lord11,4,Sun Jul 19 02:14:39 2015 UTC,I want one of our Sporting Blue jerseys. Mine's an old dark indigo. Love the Sporting Blue.

MLS,3ds31g,DefsNotTheBatman,5,Sun Jul 19 02:31:34 2015 UTC,Matt Besler is making his 200th appearance across all competitions for Sporting Kansas City tonight. Club legend.
MLS,3ds31g,alexoobers,2,Sat Jul 18 23:51:25 2015 UTC,Should be a very competitive game. I don't think we'll see a repeat of last season's matchups at all. I still see an SKC win but it should be really close.
MLS,3ds31g,toxicroach,2,Sat Jul 18 23:00:07 2015 UTC,SOOOO HOT out here. My body is ready.
MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:32:45 2015 UTC,Running the two rookie fullbacks out again. Nice. Hope they do a good job of stretching the field and cutting off crosses.

MLS,3ds31g,beach-bum,3,Sun Jul 19 00:40:48 2015 UTC,GO SKC!
MLS,3ds31g,Natrone011,2,Sun Jul 19 00:42:24 2015 UTC,High school level defending from Montreal there.

MLS,3ds31g,impactfandan,3,Sun Jul 19 01:04:40 2015 UTC,It boggles the mind how consistently terrible our field is.
MLS,3ds31g,shamusisaninja,2,Sun Jul 19 01:11:12 2015 UTC,They did play two games on Monday there.
MLS,3ds31g,shunna75,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:26 2015 UTC,That one was a bit scary.

MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,3,Sun Jul 19 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, Montreal is really, really having difficulty with our high press.  It is getting a little out of hand keeping track of how many interceptions we have in the attacking half."
MLS,3ds31g,SamSniped,3,Sun Jul 19 01:16:35 2015 UTC,It's like if Hawk Harrelson were calling soccer. No substance and painful levels of homer
MLS,3ds31g,McSquintalot,2,Sun Jul 19 01:24:57 2015 UTC,Oh man I am so sorry.
MLS,3drnbx,serious_black,37,Sat Jul 18 20:11:37 2015 UTC,I kinda hilarious that Man U was willing to play in Seattle and then travel to the Bay Area for matches but was unwilling to travel from SJ to Berkeley and back to SJ for their last two matches.
MLS,3drnbx,SomeCruzDude,3,Sat Jul 18 20:40:00 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that drive sucks."

MLS,3drnbx,frenchtoasted15,0,Sun Jul 19 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"Does this apply to men only, or women as well? Just asking."
MLS,3drnbx,AllezCannes,50,Sun Jul 19 04:23:31 2015 UTC,"Price you pay for playing friendlies in the US, Van Gaal. You want big stadiums, you have to deal with shitty turf."
MLS,3drnbx,P9J0S6,6,Sat Jul 18 20:35:29 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought they put grass down on top of the turf like they've always done for international friendlies. Which seems to be the worst possible way to handle it in my mind."
MLS,3drnbx,theDefine,6,Sat Jul 18 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"I think they did. What's your solution? They refused to play on turf (as far as I know), we can't lay down permanent grass...If you wanna play at the Clink them's the breaks."
MLS,3drnbx,P9J0S6,20,Sat Jul 18 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"It's a funny thing, because Old Trafford is a big stadium that doesn't have shitty turf.  In fact, in most of the world there seems to be a positive correlation between stadium size and quality of surface. It's only when you have to lay a temporary surface over an artificial one that this becomes an issue.  So here's a radical idea: Don't schedule matches at venues with artificial surfaces, or at the very least, don't hold a One Direction concert on your temporary surface right before a match.  In fact, don't hold a One Direction concert at all.   Either way, it's not like the US has a lack of big stadiums with natural surfaces."
MLS,3drnbx,spisska,54,Sat Jul 18 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"Here's another funny thing: CenturyLink isn't a soccer stadium, it's a football stadium that has soccer played in it. They aren't going to change to grass anytime soon."
MLS,3drnbx,Chug2778,7,Sat Jul 18 21:13:48 2015 UTC,You are forgetting that it was created as a dual purpose stadium. It wasn't going to get public funding unless it met that requirement. The stands are spaced away from the pitch to have improved sight lines for fans and cameras.  Century Link was designed as a dual purpose stadium.
MLS,3drnbx,Copernican,4,Sun Jul 19 05:22:32 2015 UTC,"It was intended to be a dual stadium, it was never going to be though and that's the big thing."
MLS,3drnbx,Chug2778,3,Sun Jul 19 05:34:21 2015 UTC,Your statement is false.  Edit: fixed html link.
MLS,3drnbx,vinylshrapnel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"It's funny you believe soccer influenced the decision. Allen was doing what every sports owner does: asks for more public money so he doesn't have to pay as much from his own pocket. Soccer was used as leverage saying IF Seattle were to get a MLS team, then games would he played there as well. It is just like what is going on in Seattle again today: there can be basketball team moved here IF there is also a hockey team. It is all about leverage against the city/state so the rich people who own the teams don't have to pay as much."
MLS,3drnbx,Chug2778,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:18:20 2015 UTC,Did you even read the article? The stadium bill passed on a very slim margin. It wouldn't have passed without the soccer vote. It Allen couldn't dip into public funding he would have backed out of the Seahawks deal and the team would have moved.
MLS,3drnbx,vinylshrapnel,5,Sun Jul 19 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"No, it's a dual purpose stadium designed specifically for soccer and football."
MLS,3drnbx,vinylshrapnel,8,Sun Jul 19 00:46:59 2015 UTC,Not sure why the idiots are down voting you for sharing some facts.  +1 from me.
MLS,3drnbx,Copernican,10,Sun Jul 19 05:23:50 2015 UTC,No....it's a football stadium designed for football that has a soccer team playing on it.
MLS,3drnbx,notthinknboutdragons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:33:28 2015 UTC,You obviously don't know the history of the stadium. I'm not wrong. Google it. Everything states it's a multipurpose stadium.
MLS,3drnbx,vinylshrapnel,6,Sun Jul 19 01:44:41 2015 UTC,"You're right in that the stands/size were designed for soccer, but the Seahawks are still the primary tenants and the biggest money makers. Their needs will always take priority, particularly the pitch."
MLS,3drnbx,director_leon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"The Seahawks FO have already started making concessions on shortening the length time for the turf replacement. As MLS grows in popularity, ticket prices will rise and  income will surpass NFL due to sheer number of games. It may take a decade or two, but it will happen."

I do think it's stupid how much you're being downvoted. Christ people, he really isn't wrong. CLink's soccer sightlines/design has been a well-touted fact in this sub, especially when Sea-wah-ttle fans feel picked on about their NFL stadium."
MLS,3drnbx,director_leon,3,Sun Jul 19 02:49:38 2015 UTC,That's a fair assessment. It will take a few more negotiations over the next 20 years for the two FOs to be on equal footing on the stadium issues. Also thanks for the support!
MLS,3drnbx,vinylshrapnel,10,Sun Jul 19 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"Just because something says its also designed for soccer doesn't mean that was the intention. It was named Seahawks stadium for a reason right off the bat. It's a football stadium, that's why the football team makes the decisions about what happens to it.  Edit: Why am I doing this, I hate that place."
MLS,3drnbx,notthinknboutdragons,2,Sun Jul 19 01:53:39 2015 UTC,That stadium doesn't exist without soccer. Voters only approved it with once it was being built for a future MLS soccer team. Paul Allen couldn't get it approved without it. First sports game ever played there was a USL Sounders match.

MLS,3drnbx,notthinknboutdragons,5,Sun Jul 19 02:32:48 2015 UTC,You're right about the first game. I misread that. But the stadium didn't have the votes necessary to pass until soccer was included.   Edit: spelling. Also no worries about the comment.
MLS,3drnbx,vinylshrapnel,13,Sun Jul 19 02:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your point is...We're not a country that builds big stadiums specifically for soccer, yet. We don't have Old Traffords. So if teams want to follow the money (and they do) that will sometimes lead them to soccer towns like Seattle that don't have big stadiums that a) have natural grass and b) are actually wide enough to accommodate soccer. I would bet that even in stadiums that meet both those conditions, groundskeepers are used to maintaining American football surfaces, not the putting greens you get in Europe. So even then you might get sub-par surfaces. It just is what it is."
MLS,3drnbx,P9J0S6,7,Sat Jul 18 22:02:01 2015 UTC,Seattle's stadium was built to also support pro soccer. That's the only reason the taxpayer funding passed.  I actually suspect TFC will be the first team to have a grass 50k seater.

MLS,3dqvbc,toxicroach,19,Sat Jul 18 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"I think this is the most important thing he said:  ‚ÄúObviously, the first objective for us is to get a good player that fits into the way we play. If you can get the marketability out of a player as well, then that's the grand slam. But we don't go after that second one. We're going after the first one. If the second one happens to be there, then great.‚Äù  So for everyone who keeps complaining that we're not signing [insert big name player here], you have to consider how they would affect team chemistry. For example, where would Rafael van der Vaart have fit in this team? I've seen people suggest we go after a player like Chicharito, and all I can think of is how that would break up the chemistry with Nemeth and Dwyer, who've played excellently together this year. It doesn't make sense to try to bring in a big-name player and try to fit him in a place where he won't."
MLS,3dqvbc,hasfarr,7,Sat Jul 18 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, and Chich makes no sense on your team. I mean, yea, of course a guy like that makes sense on every team, but Chich would make the most sense as either a striker or a CAM in the MLS (I saw him in a friendly against Nigeria, Mexico went down a man and Chich dropped back and absolutely dominated at the CAM-ish position).   Dwyer, Feilhaber, someone would have to either play way out of position or hit the bench. That's just bad business for a rhythm, chemistry built team like yours.  We all want the Kaka/Chich/Dos Santos guys, but seriously the Nemeth types are the guys that really make the difference for gritty, blue collar teams like Houston and KC. And Dwyer is a filthy little monster. The cost wouldn't be worth the upgrade for a guy like Chich."
MLS,3dqvbc,RyanTheQQNub,3,Sat Jul 18 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen some argue that with the way MLS is now, we're going to fall behind because we don't have that big name player. I just don't see it. With how much MLS has changed over the years, we've stuck to the same scouting formula and we've gotten great results out of it (Kei Kamara, Julio Cesar, Aurelien Collin, Benny Feilhaber, Soni Mustivar, Uri Rosell, Krisztian Nemeth) and we've been one of the most successful teams in MLS because of it. You can argue that getting a big name player would be good for marketing, but why sacrifice team chemistry and fit for someone who could be marketed easier?"
MLS,3dqvbc,hasfarr,4,Sat Jul 18 18:53:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair, can't ignore Bieler, Marin, Kamara 2.0, Convey, and probably a few others where we swung and missed.  However, whether luck or skill, I do feel fortunate that when we do strike out, that often times leads to the emergence of a diamond.  Can you imagine where we'd be without Melia right now?    The key for SKC is to keep up that high standard and pace of creating diamonds out of coal, because once that stops, we can't go out an sign a Dos Santos, a Bradley, a Beckham, etc when we get desperate.  On the flipside, teams in LA, Toronto, and NYC easily can.  That might be why some would argue small market teams may fall behind.  Being successful is part skill, part luck, and when you aren't being lucky, the opportunities to buy your way out of a hole are significantly smaller for teams in our position."
MLS,3dqvbc,drgath,2,Sat Jul 18 19:25:23 2015 UTC,Who is complaining we don't go after big names??  Those people need to take a hike.

MLS,3dqvbc,Soldado4lyf,16,Sat Jul 18 16:51:25 2015 UTC,Bradley and Feilhaber would have made a hell of a midfield.

MLS,3dqvbc,phism,6,Sat Jul 18 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, yea, everyone wants guys like Dos Santos, but teams like Houston and KC aren't built like that. We're basically the same team: solid, quality, underappreciated defenses, CDMs that are nastier than your average, CAMs that like to bang and get at em, and a striker that you REALLY REALLY don't want loose. Dwyer is that guy and Cubo's that guy.   I can't wait to meet KC in the West final. My adoration/utter hatred of KC is ready to watch us both smash the soft West in the playoffs and meet where it matters again. If either/both teams make the playoffs, the West is going to be a bunch of sad pandas when they meet our teams in must win games.   ;D"

MLS,3dqvbc,serious_black,9,Sat Jul 18 16:39:24 2015 UTC,I would rather strike out swinging than strike out looking though.
MLS,3dqvbc,59snomeld,9,Sat Jul 18 17:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got to give our management credit. They do appear to be swinging as some great pitches. Better than rooting for the St. Louis Rams."

MLS,3dqvbc,hasfarr,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:09 2015 UTC,I grew up in Springfield. Mom's family and Dad's family from the east side of the state so I was a St. Louis fan growing up. But followed the Wizards when I was younger so I am not on shifting soccer loyalties.  But I do root for the Chiefs/Royals when they don't play St. Louis teams.

MLS,3dqvbc,serious_black,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:33:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know how the hell the Sounders FO signed Obafemi Martins, but to me he is the ideal DP for smaller market teams. He's not super expensive compared to other DPs in the league, but his quality and production is top tier. He's also somebody that most American fans hadn't heard of before, so his price isn't inflated by marketing potential. He's not a ""big name"" in the traditional sense. I think more teams in the league need to go after DPs in the Oba mold.  EDIT: Not saying Seattle is a smaller market team, but we certainly aren't an LA or NY in terms of famous cities for foreigners."

MLS,3dqy94,theschief,15,Sat Jul 18 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"The Top Drawer guys just really love TT. It's a really great value because it doesn't count against the cap because he is a homegrown player.

MLS,3dqy94,theschief,26,Sat Jul 18 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"I as a Union fan, would like to argue that Edu isn't our worst.  Sure, he is overpaid, but he is good and at least contributes, and it's noticeable when he's not on the field.  Meanwhile we're burning nearly 400k on Rais alone who doesn't see a minute, train with the team, or anything.  Then you have Valdez, who is another 400k who is loaned out (hoping we get enough for it), or Vitoria who also 400k who rides the bench.  Edu is hardly our worst contract."

The author describes him as a middle-of-the-road holding midfield, except all season, and the vast majority of his Union career he's been a centerback. And a really good one too.  He probably is overpaid but the Union also signed him to be the face of the franchise, he's the captain, and been quality on the field.  And yeah, when you have someone like M'Bolhi's contract on the books I don't see how anyone else on the team can win worst contract."

MLS,3dqy94,JAShock,8,Sat Jul 18 16:49:45 2015 UTC,"Pappa is a very highlight-friendly player. He has a knack for scoring the occasional golazo or making an outrageous pass, but that doesn't really reflect what he does 95% of the time he gets the ball. Take Dempsey and Martins off the field so he isn't given as much space to set up just the perfect play (and doesn't have a teammate he trusts yelling at him to hurry it up already), and he becomes a lot less effective.  Still a steal. Just not as much so as people who only catch Seattle's highlights would assume."
MLS,3dqy94,stealth_sloth,5,Sat Jul 18 16:59:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'm following your complaint about his play. Anyone's less effective without Martins and Dempsey on the field. I'd still rate him as a top 5 outside midfielder in the league with or without them on the field.   He used to be criticized for a lack of defense but I think he's improved a lot on the defensive side of the ball this year.
MLS,3dqy94,eluwork,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"Outside mids I'd rather have: Ethan Finley, Harry Shipp, Graham Zusi, Lloyd Sam, Rodney Wallace, Ignacio Piatti, Fabian Castillo, Christian Maidana. I agree he's good and a bargain though"
MLS,3dqy94,WonderboyYYZ,8,Sun Jul 19 07:18:48 2015 UTC,"Wait, what does he do 95% of the time? Hold up play? He isn't turning the ball over in dangerous areas like Neagle or Pineda. If he does lose the ball it's in midfield when Seattle clears, or in the other teams half of the field. His flair passing is about the same percentage as Dempsey and Martins, probably completes more than Dempsey too be honest.  I believe Pappa deserves the hype high-lights or not. He actually makes Seattle play better and changes their offense"
MLS,3dqy94,Debando,3,Sat Jul 18 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"I think /u/stealth_sloth is sort of right, but his statement has a big recency bias. Pappa hasn't been very effective lately when the two veteran attackers have been him and Neagle. If he's playing with Oba/Dempsey however, he's very effective all of the time."
MLS,3dqy94,Tasslehoff,2,Sat Jul 18 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"I am 99% certain that Castillo is the best value in the league. I would say he is a top five player in the league, and he makes 1/35 of some of the top paid guys in the league."
MLS,3dqy94,parsac58,13,Sun Jul 19 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"Alvas Powell is a steal for the timbers imo at 60k base salary. I'm a bit biased, I admit,  but he is one of the best right backs in the league, and he makes less than Nick Besler and Tshuma, who have played single digit minutes this season."
MLS,3dqy94,Rhormus,6,Sat Jul 18 18:56:45 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I have no problem with Nagbe's contract but Powell's is insane value at 60k
MLS,3dqy94,freecascadia,13,Sat Jul 18 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"Laughably wrong on both.  Igboanike is far, far worse than Magee in every way, with a bigger cap hit as well as taking up a DP spot.   Also,   Even in his MVP season Magee didn‚Äôt crack 2,000 minutes,   That's because Magee didn't even join the damn team until halfway into the season. It's not like he was in and out with injury.   As for best - Shipp is good and all, and the HG contract means he's not on the cap, but he's not having the best season. Meanwhile, Matt Polster, on a much smaller salary, has been absolutely crucial in our midfield - look at how worthless that midfield was on Wednesday when Polster dropped back to CB and the Ritter/Cocis combo got absolutely dominated at home. Polster is quietly having an MVP season and makes passes like this.   Maybe if Shipp were playing in his natural central position he'd be contributing more, but as it is he's wasted on the wing and his passes simply aren't as sharp as we're used to."
MLS,3dqy94,Ahesterd,8,Sat Jul 18 19:09:04 2015 UTC,Agreed.  If not Polster I'd say Joevin is a close second.

Fatai Alashe is the best value, he's our starting CDM and likely to start getting National Team callups (Played U23s at Toulon, probably will be on the Olympic team).  Lenhart is injured, which is a copout for a bad contract.  Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi is making $260k, which is $20k MORE than Matias Perez Garcia, and now sits third on the depth chart of CDMs behind Alashe and 2nd year midfielder JJ Koval."
MLS,3dqy94,MikeFive,13,Sat Jul 18 17:01:39 2015 UTC,Or Nemec? Who has been completely ineffective and is now benched?
MLS,3dqy94,theschief,10,Sat Jul 18 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"Mix is showing up and playing and hasn't done anything spectacularly awful like Nemec has.  I don't mind Mix's contract, Mix is not an issue on our roster.  It's a matter of Kreis playing him in an attacking role, which I don't think he's done a lot of."
MLS,3dqy94,Santos_L_Halper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:58:28 2015 UTC,Parchman has never been much of a Mix fan. Doesn't like that he doesn't really have a position--which he's not wrong about.
MLS,3dqy94,ncquake24,28,Sat Jul 18 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"Steven Gerrard had a goal, assist, drew a penalty, and hit the post in his first game. He didn't even play all that great. If that's a bad contract, then we're never going to lose another game this year. Or this author is talking out his ass."
MLS,3dqy94,fizzlebuns,9,Sat Jul 18 17:42:21 2015 UTC,Or maybe you're drawing from a sample size of 1?

MLS,3dqy94,csbsju_guyyy,11,Sun Jul 19 04:54:05 2015 UTC,That's my thought too. How can you know his worth when he hasn't played but one game and he played well?
MLS,3dqy94,MEitniear11,11,Sat Jul 18 17:56:00 2015 UTC,How can you know his worth when he hasn't played but one game and he played well?   Don apparently knew before he even played a game :-P
MLS,3dqy94,dgmz,4,Sat Jul 18 18:02:20 2015 UTC,The all-star game is an exhibition game. Players 'worth' in it is based on their marketing value. We all knew what that was before he played a game.
MLS,3dqy94,eluwork,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"exactly, so how can one judge it as a bad contract"

MLS,3dqy94,VatoFlaco,2,Sat Jul 18 19:31:28 2015 UTC,Seems to me the worst contract on the LAG squad is Dos Santos.
MLS,3dqy94,AllezCannes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:27:20 2015 UTC,"He had some crazy wheels last night too. I don't think it's accurate to describe him as having old man legs. Keane finally got somebody to play on his level, and he looked like he won the lottery."
MLS,3dqy94,cm801,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:47 2015 UTC,Seriously. If they are going to have Gerrard on there then Frank Lampard should certainly be on there.
MLS,3dqy94,TandBinc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"Galaxy have much worse contracts than Gerrard's DP contract.  Vayrynen's contract of $200,000 comes to mind first"
MLS,3dqy94,TheBostonGooner,17,Sat Jul 18 21:28:52 2015 UTC,Rafael Ramos is a very close second for best value contract for us @ just 50k. Also not sure how Okugo or Ricketts aren't our worst contracts.
MLS,3dqy94,ChemE_nolifer,5,Sat Jul 18 17:29:50 2015 UTC,"yeah id put ramos and ceren as our best.  Shea hasn't quite lived up to his price tag, but he's still our #1 at LM when he is healthy.  Okugo is relegated to the bench by players making a fraction of what he makes, and isn't even the first choice to come off the bench when they miss a game.  I personally rate Edwards Jr particularly higher than Ricketts as well which puts our 3rd string goalie making 200k+.  I feel like there is a Philly joke in there somewhere."
MLS,3dqy94,spikebaylor,4,Sat Jul 18 17:50:40 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain that portland is still paying a portion of the Ricketts contact.
MLS,3dqy94,xenoguy1313,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"Still not a good deal O.o  Nothing against Ricketts, I know he was a great goalie, but he has had mostly really bad performances for us this year."
MLS,3dqy94,spikebaylor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:54:41 2015 UTC,was   Exactly. Its unfortunate but he has declined heavily in the last two years. It was a forgone conclusion that he'd leave us after last season. Love him though. He was huge for us many times and one of the nicest guys.
MLS,3dqy94,foolinthezoo,9,Sun Jul 19 00:03:16 2015 UTC,Remind me not to read anything Will Parchman writes about MLS soccer ever again.

MLS,3dqy94,Kevo_CS,8,Sun Jul 19 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"RBNY didn't really do too bad on contracts, if only Zubar would stay fit, then I think he would justify his 300K...  Also Taxi is a huge steal."
MLS,3dqy94,mkbloodyen,7,Sat Jul 18 17:30:06 2015 UTC,"Robles is being robbed at 153k guaranteed compared to the salaries of some of the other established starting goalies in this league.   Sean Johnson - 253k, Kwarasey - 260k, Ousted - 302k, Steve Clark - 188k, Dan Kennedy - 233k."
MLS,3dqy94,abigbear,5,Sat Jul 18 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"And to think is 2nd in the all-time most consecutive starts, with only about 10 away from taking 1st.  We did good on contracts, only a few that we aren't on the good end of (Miller, Reynish, and Zubar)"
MLS,3dqy94,mkbloodyen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"The good news is we have the cap space to give our core deserved raises and keep them together too.  I really want a James McClean type DP, but the core of this team and the idea of the next few years makes me excited. 5 years of Dax, Davis, Kljestan, Miazga, Robles, Duval, Taxi, and Abang, with the likes of Stolz, Adams, Etienne, and a lot more of our really exciting academy guys coming through. Cautiously optimistic, but then again this is Red Bulls..."
MLS,3dqy94,take_a_bow_son,7,Sat Jul 18 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"Melia the best contract for Sporting. Dude deserves at least double what he's making if he can hold form.  Roger is a worse value than Zusi for me. Not only does he make more money, but he's been almost invisible on offense. Plus Zusi seems more marketable as a USMNT player."
MLS,3dqy94,serious_black,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"I agree exactly with this. Melia makes 80k and has the lowest GAA in all of MLS. Roger is our highest paid player and while he does good work, he isn't playing how I expected after his stint in England. But I'm glad we don't have any major bad contract deals though!"
MLS,3dqy94,Juventus19,3,Sat Jul 18 17:46:53 2015 UTC,I would say that Kevin Ellis with his 60k deal is a huge steal as well.
MLS,3dqy94,hasfarr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:49:49 2015 UTC,Is he still considered homegrown and paid with cap-free funds?
MLS,3dqy94,serious_black,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:48 2015 UTC,I believe so if he's still being paid that amount.
MLS,3dqy94,hasfarr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:26 2015 UTC,At least Roger and Zusi contribute.  Lopez is a $100k insta-loan.
MLS,3dqy94,ThisIsMyNewUserID,2,Sat Jul 18 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"Lopez doesn't count towards the cap. Cap is love, cap is life."
MLS,3dqy94,sidekickraider,6,Sat Jul 18 20:39:19 2015 UTC,"Hard to believe Edu's contract is considered worst than M'Bohli. Considering Edu still plays and is actually contributing the Union finally finding it's form, and M'Bohli is sitting on the bench while the upper offices are trying really hard to get rid of him or at the very least justify why he deserves to warm his share of cushioned padding.

MLS,3dqy94,mikesicle,2,Sat Jul 18 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"I guess due to coming up from the USL team, Ceren seems to not get much love from non Orlando fans.

MLS,3dqy94,spikebaylor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Ceren has definitely been a key player this season, but Kaka is by far our best player this season.

MLS,3dqy94,JohnMLTX,5,Sat Jul 18 17:43:34 2015 UTC,I didn't even have to read this to know that Gil would be our worst value.
MLS,3dqy94,Aflimacon,3,Sat Jul 18 18:25:59 2015 UTC,For real. It is aggravating to see his salary next to Plata's.
MLS,3dqy94,cm801,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:06:17 2015 UTC,Not that you GIL deserves a DP tag but as a 21 yr old his cap hit would be a lot less if he was a DP due being a young DP.
MLS,3dqy94,vin05004,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:29:03 2015 UTC,He doesn't count against the cap though since he's homegrown so it's actually not bad

MLS,3dqy94,notevenmyfinalporn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"So I dug into our stats some, curious to try and find a ""worst"" supported by facts.  As of now, Andres Correa has recorded zero minutes for the Sounders. That could qualify him as our worst contract thus far. Though, to be fair, I do think he's played at least once for S2 and has been injured.  In 11 games, Michael Azira ($62,826.88) has zero assists, and has taken six shots, none of which were actually on goal. Granted, he is primarily a defensive midfielder (and for comparison, Ozzie has 6 shots, only one which is recorded as on goal.)"
MLS,3dqy94,HazardSuitor,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"I was going to say Fernandez was the worst, and then I realized he's actually really cheap.  I think Powell at $48k is the best value for us though"

It wasn't quite Beckham-level pressure, but there was a big weight of expectation in the midfield.  And this was coming back from 2-0 down, to level at 2-2.  I posted a YouTube link to the video I took of Stevie's assist to Keane to make it 3-2.  I probably have the video of Lleget's last-minute header, too, I think.

I'll definitely be watching again especially now that Stevie is playing and that the premier league still has a few weeks until it starts.  Are the Galaxy planning on playing him in a deeper role or behind the striker? I know it's a completely different league but last season he didn't really have the legs to play in the deeper role for Liverpool and was mostly poor as a result.

MLS,3dr1pz,Ahesterd,4,Sat Jul 18 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of his cool off has been in the recent decimation of our squad due to call-ups and injuries. Once Accam and Maloney are back, and Magee and Nyarko get game fit u could see him rounding back into that form"
MLS,3dr1pz,Somebody_Call911,2,Sat Jul 18 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"I can kind of see that, but all the guys missing right now were missing when he was taking off last season, or just not signed in the first place.   And what I've seen hasn't just been great passes being wasted by the recepient - he's simply just not making those great passes. Lots of interceptions, wasted possessions, that sort.

MLS,3dqygm,spisska,2,Sat Jul 18 18:02:04 2015 UTC,Thank you! Everyone on /r/chicagofire is talking about how amazing he would be for us but he is a huge gamble. IMO we need better central midfielders and defenders (especially with Larentowicz out) instead of another striker that may just end up being a more expensive Igboananike. The only good thing that could come out of this is Igboana playing less.

From what I understand of how the new rule works, the targeted allocation DP counts as a max contract of 430 or whatever it is and that's it. I'd throw my hat at Daniel Agger (685 at Brondby) or Ciaran Clark (985k), Roncaglia (650) or Jonathan Mensah.

I would say our positions of need are GK (Irony), CB, LB, and Wingers. I dont know if I would keep Fernando or Vitoria at this point as their salary is high and their contribution thus far has been minimal to say the least. If Carroll retires give Edu the Dmid slot an find another CB. If Le Toux, Casey, and Carroll all leave that is three positions we need to cover with a small amount of salary leaving. I would say our best move is spending all possible money on Guzan2Philly and then filling in the rest with dogshit."

He's too expensive to be doing nothing. Figure out the back line, jesus christ. Use the cap space freed up from 1 and 2 to get some quality defense built up. Teach guys to play to the flanks sooner and to cross sooner so we score a fucking goal instead of spraying it into crowded space constantly. No more Yallop ball."

Second, I'd take a look at this list of center backs whose contracts are expiring this year and call all of their agents. I'd try to sign at least one if not two.     Sign Nguyen to a new contract putting him at the cap or, if need be, making him a ""Core Player"" or whatever this new mechanism is.     Renew Jermaine Jones' contract for another 2-3 years.    Invest in a New England USL team ASAP.    Hire Shalrie Joseph as academy director or something in that realm.

Another winger better than Anor/Peterson/de Jong, again for depth but also so when N√©meth/Zusi get subbed off Peterson doesn't have to be the replacement for them, and can truly use his versatility anywhere.  Someone like Peter Crouch (this should probably be #2) who can be physical up front and win headers because this is really our only weakness going forward with Dwyer.

Besides that creative ability, his hold up play is world class, something lacking on the national team. If you give Nagbe the ball, he won't lose it until he's fouled. I may be a total homer but I think he could challenge Bedoya right off the bat.  Edit: He's also only a year older than Zardes, so lets not pretend he doesn't still have time to develop his game."
MLS,3dqpjk,only_drinks_pabst,7,Sat Jul 18 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"He should play a huge role on the wing for the US, starting or off the bench.  Anyone who disagrees must not be watching.    My wild speculation:  Klinsmann won't like Nagbe because of the perception that Nagbe lacks intensity.  Klinsmann is more about involving ""his"" players that are either (1) his recruits, (2) young players who he believes he can shepherd to a higher level in Europe, or (3) players he identifies with (extreme competitiveness, resourcefulness, etc.).  Nagbe may not compute for Klinsmann on a personality level.  It seems like this is what happened with Donovan.  This is my fear.  My hope is that Nagbe's obvious contribution to possession against the better international teams forces Klinsmann to give him a big role."

We don't have a Giovinco in our player pool, but on the international level, Nagbe could a missing piece for us: an outstanding role player who can create chances.  Especially when you look at the opposite side being Fabian Johnson, a more mature D. Yedlin."
MLS,3dqpjk,notevenmyfinalporn,3,Sat Jul 18 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the unbalanced diamond with a more technical guy on one side (~Bedoya) and a pacy guy on the other end (Zardes/Yedlin). I think Nagbe would be perfect there (if Klinsmann insists on the diamond) since he's got both pace, vision, and creativity."
MLS,3dqpjk,baviddoughie,6,Sat Jul 18 23:56:08 2015 UTC,"I really think Nagbe needs a change of coach. He's been under Porter since college (excepting 1 year), and could really grow and learn from someone like JK.   Additionally, despite not having the greatest goal scoring record, he still creates plenty of chances, and with better finishers could easily lead the league in assists. Nagbe and Bradley in the middle would be better than Bradley and Mix."

As a Quakes fan I'd rather not have the Galaxy continue to add talent to their MLS Cup winning team, whether it's underrated draft picks like Maganto, the Chivas USA academy because LAFC didn't want them, Lletget when he's from the bay area, etc. Similarly, I'd rather see Julian Green go anywhere else other than LA.

MLS,3dp4kf,Revolt_52,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:10:32 2015 UTC,You're wrong. Allocation order has to do with National Team players and/or players that were sold by the league coming back.

MLS,3dpioa,j3zuz00,25,Sat Jul 18 05:02:58 2015 UTC,"From a San Jose persective breakdown:  Positives   Team fought to the dying breath, much better than how we finished the Dynamo game.  Quincy can score if we give him service. When we did that in the first half, he was excellent. We now have two quality finishers up top (still haven't seen Jahn since Preseason and Sherrod has been lackluster at best) Nyassi didn't fuck every other opportunity up this time. In fact, I thought he had patches of brilliance.    Negatives   Alashe got royally fucked in the middle of the park. He couldn't deal with the flurry of attacking options LA has, even without Zardes and Gio. LA has by far the best attack we've seen on a (in my opinion) better than average defense in the league.  Matias seems to be our only consistent creative option. TT has moments of brilliance, but not great enough to warrant a full time first team spot. Expect Wondo to take it back as soon as he return from the Gold Cup.  Wing backs and center halves should not be entirely at fault for all the goals conceded. LA fully and throughly battered us, but I felt we left our back 4 way to exposed. One of MPG and TT needed to track back tonight, and they both could have done better  The Sherrod/Jahn 4-4-2 isn't working for me. The bash brother concept is to easy to defend. I only want to see one of these two out here unless we play someone like Portland who struggle on set prices."

Sporting are unlikely to have the biggest stars but they continue to be one of the best teams in the league."
MLS,3dpioa,AmericanWolfx1,2,Sat Jul 18 12:17:14 2015 UTC,Bruce is a great coach when he has talent. When his talent level drops  he struggles to get the best out of them. He is able to get a talented team to be great he is not so good getting a average team to be above average. I guess Bruce is a rocket booster coach not a liftoff rocket coach.
MLS,3dpioa,steerbell,9,Sat Jul 18 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"Now this is the kind of game that makes you think ""damn, is there any parity left in this league?""   before this, we beat Portland 5-0, Philadelphia 5-1, and Toronto 4-0."
MLS,3dpioa,Vagabond21,28,Sat Jul 18 05:41:50 2015 UTC,You also lost to San Jose 3-1
MLS,3dpioa,Jack2142,20,Sat Jul 18 05:45:12 2015 UTC,"But you also lost 1-0 to Vancouver, 1-0 to RSL and 3-1 to the same San Jose team. Anything can happen in this league."
MLS,3dpioa,hasfarr,5,Sat Jul 18 05:46:09 2015 UTC,my comment was aiming more to the point that there have been other games were we blow out teams with ease. This one seems to be amplified by the fact that Gerrard played.
MLS,3dpioa,Vagabond21,3,Sat Jul 18 05:47:58 2015 UTC,"We've had similar results against teams like FC Dallas and New England, and then we went on to lose 2-1 to RSL at their place. Just take it from me, don't expect to blow out every team every week. The season is a long grind."
MLS,3dpioa,hasfarr,3,Sat Jul 18 05:50:33 2015 UTC,remember last year when New England had a 7 game winning streak followed by a 8 game losing streak?
MLS,3dpioa,Vagabond21,7,Sat Jul 18 05:51:53 2015 UTC,And then they made it to the final.  We went like 10 games unbeaten and then completely shat the bed the rest of the way through last year. You never know with MLS.

There is no parity when you can predict the top 4 teams every year. What chance does Philidelphia, or Colorado, or Chicago, or Houston have of making it past LA?"
MLS,3dpioa,cantbeassed,21,Sat Jul 18 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"It seems a bit unfair to group Philly, Colorado and Chicago together like that because their ownership has been notoriously bad."

MLS,3dpioa,uselessattempt,7,Sat Jul 18 08:05:57 2015 UTC,"San Jose  Those are all teams that spend a lot of money   Uh San Jose is 15th out of 20 teams in payroll based on the 2015 salary numbers that were just released, so if they spend a lot of money, so does pretty much the entire league."

MLS,3dpioa,lunacraz,4,Sat Jul 18 21:24:51 2015 UTC,The powerhouse football team that never falls out of the top four in the league doesn't really happen in North American pro sports. You might have teams that get a good group that's strong for a few years -- but they aren't immune to falling out of the mix.  The team that's last place in the NHL for instance could win the Stanley Cup in a few years time. It's totally believable.   In Europe -- football teams stay near the top for decades due to market disparity. Bottom teams never rise to win championships. I hope that doesn't come to MLS.

MLS,3dpioa,cliffordbeshers,6,Sat Jul 18 05:58:18 2015 UTC,The stubhub center is only 12 years old. They spent a decent little sum upgrading it last year. It's probably built to expand to hold something closer to 35k. IIRC this is like your first or second sell out of the season. AEG is gonna wait until you guys sell out a few years in a row before they even think about a new stadium. And then they're gonna raise the ticket and concession prices every year until they've made enough money to privately fund it.

MLS,3dpioa,cliffordbeshers,4,Sat Jul 18 06:07:41 2015 UTC,Until their latest signing I was getting emails directly from StubHub for 50% off tickets. They were desperate for butts in seats.  We'll be opening our stadium to max capacity for 4 games this year and have no problem selling those seats.

But the again, this is MLS where they literally make up  or disregard rules so LA or Seattle or whoever can get who they want, so I don't think shadiness is a concern on their part.

Let's not forget that San Jose scored twice before the onslaught of LA goals. If their defense is not solid then they will not win the supporters shield.  Defense aside look at the standings in a single table format by points per game with goal differential being the tie breaker. If you do this you will notice that Sporting KC leads the league with 1.76 PPG and a +9 goal differential. LA Galaxy is in sixth place, tied with Portland Timbers at 1.55 PPG, with a +11 goal differential. Maybe no one can regularly crush LA, but right now I would not bet on them for the SS."

MLS,3do9we,MordenkainensHound,53,Fri Jul 17 22:06:11 2015 UTC,"It takes a big many to realize this, but its pretty apparent watching him day in and day out on Sounders that he's not really captain material.  He is a bit of a hothead, can get into fights easily and will let his emotions boil over.  That's not always a bad thing.  Its good to have a couple of those guys on the team.  Not everyone needs to be level-headed.  Its good to have some fire-breathers.   Its a good reason to give Brad(ley) the armband though."
MLS,3do9we,sammysounder,11,Fri Jul 17 23:28:31 2015 UTC,"I think Jurgen ""the US players need to become a bit more nasty"" Klinsmann wanted some of Dempsey's fire to catch on with the rank and file. But Dempsey's leadership style is clearly more like General Patton in comparison Bradley's Eisenhower, making him a great choice to receive the armband if Bradley has to leave the game. Just don't let him drive his truck onto the field."

MLS,3do9we,metameh,2,Sat Jul 18 02:18:22 2015 UTC,It's not a bad thing at all unless it is forced upon you. I respect the hell out of Dempsey for admitting it. He just wants to do his thing and concentrate on helping the team win. Which you can't fault as long as he is doing that well and he is.
MLS,3do9we,jmoney0999,2,Sat Jul 18 02:24:39 2015 UTC,Ehhh... both of you have a pretty narrow view of leadership. It seems like you are both big fans of Evans' style leadership and are critical cause he ain't Evans and that is not his style.  As far as the experiment comment goes I'd recommend rereading the related quotes and the press releases again.
MLS,3do9we,DavidLeeYacht,6,Sat Jul 18 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"Came here to post this, but was worried about being accused of having bias. He's a fantastic player, and absolutely key to the success of the USMNT. But it takes a different set of qualities to wear the armband."
MLS,3do9we,thesleddog,4,Sat Jul 18 06:25:55 2015 UTC,"Bradely is the future. And a good captain to boot. While we have Clint I like to see him at his best. Being a hot head, getting pissed, and scoring goals."
MLS,3do9we,steveotheguide,83,Fri Jul 17 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"disregarding my flair and natural contempt for Dempsey the Sounder, I feel like he's a playmaker that wants to be directed and doesn't want the responsibility, good or bad, for the USMNT's output. it seems obvious that Bradley wants the responsibility and I hope he continues to lead CD and the rest of our USA men to a million bajillion future goals."
MLS,3do9we,19O1,44,Sat Jul 18 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but don't quite agree. In my mind, Dempsey doesn't want to be directed, he wants to improvise. Good improvisers aren't directors or followers, they don't set the rhythm or finish movements with the obvious play - they play off their support and take what's been given to them to do something unpredictable or simply audacious. Dempsey thrives when he has the freedom to try shit, not when he's required to acquiesce to a certain scheme or choreography."
MLS,3do9we,metameh,15,Fri Jul 17 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"sure, that's probably a better way of putting it. I think no matter what, we can agree that he's a better player when he's not looking to dictate Jurgen's direction on the field"

MLS,3do9we,fatboyfriend,3,Sat Jul 18 04:12:16 2015 UTC,I think this is good to admit. He got the captaincy for being a leader and veteran and he's basically putting it out there for everyone that he thinks Bradley is the better Captain. I remember watching Bradley in 2010 thinking that someday he was gonna captain the US. He just has that natural leadership. He plays a position too where as captain he can really control the game.
MLS,3do9we,bossmt_2,6,Sat Jul 18 01:31:58 2015 UTC,I always thought it made more sense to name Bradley as Captain starting with last year's World Cup...

MLS,3do9we,thelostdolphin,17,Fri Jul 17 23:32:17 2015 UTC,I think there's a vocal leadership role you take on both in games and practice. I've seen some games where Dempsey either delegated the get pumped/pep talk role to someone else before a game and others where he looked uncomfortable doing it.
MLS,3do9we,Lil_Tyrese,8,Fri Jul 17 22:19:17 2015 UTC,"I think Dempsey is just more inside his own head, a bit of a gamer. He doesn't want to lead by example, he wants to go about his game and compete. That's fine, not everyone is that kind of leader.  ""I always kind of struggled a little bit with being captain sometimes, because sometimes you feel like you have to be someone that you're not,"" Dempsey said. ""That weight's been lifted.""  I know I'd feel lighter if I didn't feel obliged to be the vocal leader with all the responsibility it comes with."

In order to make it a sustainable project/effort on my part, I've built an automated system that pulls data from the MLS mobile app XML feed and will auto-post the table to Reddit on Mondays.  With that being said, there are sometimes gaps where MLS does not provide attendance numbers in their feed for a particular match (Last week's Rapids/RSL match for example). I will try to fill in that gap if I can, but can't make guarantees.  Please bear with me as I get this off the ground and going. If you have ideas for stats/data points, feel free to make suggestions.  Thanks!"

MLS,3dopxo,deadlockedwinter,25,Sat Jul 18 12:43:51 2015 UTC,MLS loans always come with an option to buy.  Bayern won't accept that.

MLS,3dopxo,foggell44,2,Sat Jul 18 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"He might not be, but from what I understand pep really likes and Green and might want to keep him around."
MLS,3dopxo,Jopgo,3,Sat Jul 18 06:42:46 2015 UTC,"I don't blame him. Green is obviously talented, and if he gets good enough to play for Bayern's first team, then Bayern would become the new default European club for Americans. That's a massive potential source of revenue for Bayern and for the Bundesliga as a whole."
MLS,3dopxo,c12345g,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:24:18 2015 UTC,"How massive? I feel like this effect is rather overstated, especially relative to the fact that Bayern could just give Green's place to a much, much better player who will actually help them win things, which to me seems like a better call than letting the American kid tag along for the sake of a few thousand jerseys."
MLS,3dopxo,WR1206,2,Sat Jul 18 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say that a majority of people who pick a premier league side in the US either pick one of the consistent winners (MU, City, Chelsea, Arsenal), or a team with a US international (Tottenham with Dempsey and Yedlin, Everton with Howard). Bayern fulfills both of the requirements. Furthermore, Fox is showing more of the Bundesliga this year, so they'll get more exposure. I think most of us believe soccer in America is increasing in popularity, so being able to get a foothold in terms of support is huge.  That being said, you don't see people here support Borrusia M√∂nchengladbach because of Fabian Johnson. Green has to grow up to be a star for the USMNT for any of this to end up playing out. There are plenty of good American players in Europe who we only really care about when they play in Red, White, and Blue."
MLS,3dopxo,mgmfa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"Also the fact that since he's American, more Americans are gonna tune in to see how he's doing, which increases there exposure in a country that the popularity of soccer is still growing."
MLS,3dopxo,kcash935,16,Sat Jul 18 17:41:01 2015 UTC,He should come to the Scorpions. We can pay Bayern in travel and hotel accommodations.

MLS,3dopxo,EnglishHooligan,52,Sat Jul 18 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"I'm losing patience with the kid. There's nothing wrong with going out on loan. Lahn and Alaba both did it, and look at them! Green needs minutes, and he wont get them at Munich. His loan to Hamburg was a disaster. I don't see how he deserves to even sit on Munich's bench right now."
MLS,3dopxo,midnight_thunder,39,Sat Jul 18 00:32:19 2015 UTC,"His loan to Hamburg was a disaster because Hamburg didn't play him after a manager change, wasn't it?"
MLS,3dopxo,MikeFive,10,Sat Jul 18 02:39:20 2015 UTC,Right
MLS,3dopxo,martybad,6,Sat Jul 18 03:18:59 2015 UTC,"I remember reading that Munich and Hamburg had a deal where Hamburg pays Munich every time Green wan't in the lineup. He made the 18 only a few times, and spent most of the season with the reserves. I can't blame that solely on a managerial change.   If he was good enough to make the 18, he would have, especially since Hamburg was getting penalized for not putting him in the lineup."
MLS,3dopxo,midnight_thunder,10,Sat Jul 18 13:22:26 2015 UTC,I don't care where he goes as long as he plays good minutes and competition. MLS would definitely be  lol but seriously why urn down a spell in the EPL?

MLS,3dopxo,Tater_tottenhamV3,2,Sat Jul 18 11:34:23 2015 UTC,I agree. Even though it likely can't be the bigger MLS teams that would take him it would still do him a lot of good.

MLS,3dopxo,peckerwinkle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:07:41 2015 UTC,They got Sylvain Distin and Artur Boruc on free transfers and Christian Atsu on loan
MLS,3dopxo,ryancarp3,8,Sat Jul 18 01:33:28 2015 UTC,Is Distin really that good of a signing at 37 though? He was poor with Everton last year and struggles for fitness.
MLS,3dopxo,alambert212,2,Sat Jul 18 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"He'll give them leadership and Premier League experience, and they didn't have to pay a fee. It's not a great signing, but it should work out well for them if he stays healthy"
MLS,3dopxo,ryancarp3,-6,Sat Jul 18 01:58:11 2015 UTC,He's trash and won't stay healthy. He would even be able to start for the worst MLS squad.
MLS,3dopxo,deadlockedwinter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:48:19 2015 UTC,Boruc had been with them on loan and Saints had no interest in keeping him.  ...kinda wish we did with Forster down
MLS,3dopxo,LocksTheFox,-2,Sat Jul 18 05:42:40 2015 UTC,Dustin is trash.
MLS,3dopxo,deadlockedwinter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:45:45 2015 UTC,"Well ritchie and wilson have basically cemented their position. Now they've got atsu and joshua king. And then they have ryan fraser who they sent on loan to ipswich this season to get him some playing time and considering he's already better than green (considering he's proven himself by actually playing regular football - no offence), I doubt they'd loan someone who would probably have less of an impact. Their other amazing signings would have to mings and boruc (don't really affect green)."
MLS,3dopxo,ThatCanadianDuude,0,Sat Jul 18 02:41:31 2015 UTC,"ok yes, I agree. King and Atsu probably push green out of the running for even rotation minutes. Would be a bad move."
MLS,3dopxo,peckerwinkle,3,Sat Jul 18 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he couldn't even break into HSV last season so he should just suck it up and go the second bundesliga. One good season there and he will have a lot of bundesliga teams wanting him and maybe even some chances with bayern."

MLS,3dopxo,ThatCanadianDuude,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"Atsu is trash and will likely be a pretty unproductive addition 2. King wasn't anything special at Blackburn and I don't think that'll change much in the PL 3. As for Mings, they overpayed like crazy and he likely won't deliver to people's expectations. I don't see how they're signings to get excited over, sorry."
MLS,3dopxo,4nay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"Atsu will be one of there best players, I don't see why you are calling him trash. King had a fairly standout season when he was fit, is only 23 and a very promising player, great in the FA cup, and has already scored twice in preseason. And about Mings, the guy was attracting teams like arsenal and man city, of course he isn't a nobody, could be the next shaw."

He had a goal in mind, he perseverated on it,  but in the end he actually attained that goal when Stoke attempted to sign him multiple times.  Unfortunately for him it wasn't his inability to perform on the pitch that kept him out of the Prem, it was a particular set of rules (think it was a foreign work permit in order to play in England).  In the case of Green, he has shown nothing to warrant turning down these other opportunities.  Completely do not understand why he doesn't want to take them, he needs to prove himself somewhere."

MLS,3dpn5f,SomeCruzDude,11,Sat Jul 18 05:55:51 2015 UTC,"In the ideal world, the paragraph above would perfectly encapsulate the actions during the past two weeks of the United States women‚Äôs national team as it returns to the NWSL off the back of a World Cup win. Unfortunately, it does not; instead the national team described in the opening paragraph is England and the league is the English FA WSL. Despite a long trip back to England, jet lag and a whirlwind of activity following an unexpected third place finish at the World Cup, the English players made sure to plug the league as often as possible and to suit up less than a week after their return from Canada.   Hit the nail on the head right here. USWNT players could be back right now but they're not. And they should be if they want their clubs to keep selling tickets.   There is still time for players to step up. However, there have been rumors since NWSL was founded that the national team players are not fully behind the league. At the 2015 NSCAA Convention, Chicago Red Stars head coach Rory Dames went so far as to suggest that there was little incentive for players to be supportive of a league that will only generate more competition for spots in the national team.    This is really shady, but wouldn't surprise me."
MLS,3dpn5f,CACuzcatlan,2,Sat Jul 18 05:58:02 2015 UTC,"Wow. I can understanding wanting a break after the WC, so even 2 weeks seems fine, but they should be mentioning the league and their team at every opportunity."
MLS,3dpn5f,ahryankeefan,4,Sat Jul 18 18:07:00 2015 UTC,Very well said. Great read. The windowifear has already shut though
MLS,3dpn5f,erockarmy1,4,Sat Jul 18 13:10:23 2015 UTC,"The fact that their contracts are with the USSF and not the NWSL might have something to do with it. I just don't get a connection to the league like there was with the WUSA and WPS. Or even early MLS and its players.  Look at Wambach. Back in the WPS, Abby fought like hell for the late Dan Borislow and his silly Magicjack club even with all the nonsense he was pulling. She showed up every match, promoted the club to anyone that would listen, and even managed the team when he fired everyone on the staff like a wacko. Now look how she treats the NWSL. She blew off the NWSL by skipping this year. Big difference.   Maybe it is the low pay. Maybe they feel a better league needs to be formed and the NWSL is just a placeholder. Whatever the case, I just don't feel any connection between the NWSL and players. And that is probably why they aren't looking to promote it."

This is exactly what many who pay attention have been saying for a decade. The USWNT is more akin to sorority than anything else.  And I have said ever since the demise of WUSA, full on partnership with MLS and or NASL is the only solution. Performance in healthy fully backed league will select the USWNT. Not the most senior players. You could make a credible argument that with the right coach and the right roster made up of ladies in their prime the USWNT should not have won any game by less than 4 or 5 goals because we are that deep and this year's other  WC  favorites mostly underperformed. But we eeked out points often quite ugly until the end because the coach, roster and tactics were flawed.  This is not rain on the parade. It's necessary long term risk assessment.  Staying on top means new blood and cold calculated roster moves.  Consistently. I don't think the Federation gets it.......Failure to do so will mean a hard fall off the perch eventually."
MLS,3dpn5f,mr_skull,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how this article can compare the quicker return of the England squad to the US, as it was a week later, one crucial game less and a time of rightful celebrations shorter.  Looking again through the article the only real criticism i can find is the following:   Immediately after last weekend‚Äôs games, they left their clubs once again to appear at the ESPY‚Äôs and other events. Now word is most, if not all, of the national teamers may not play again this weekend despite sell out crowds expecting to see their the stars.   They left AFTER the games to do promotional business (which can arguably be crucial to continue the hype train of the women's game) and that there is some feelings out there that some of these players will not be around this coming weekend (which ones?).  While the article's premise may be true, what it presents is more feeling and speculation rather than presenting clear and rational discourse."

MLS,3do0jb,Younger_Gods,8,Sat Jul 18 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"Their website really is, and has been, one of the worst I have ever visited. While we are on the subject, and I know I sound like a broken record, but ESPN is trash, especially ESPNFC TV.   I love soccer, like I'm addicted to it, I love reading news stories every day.  But ESPNFC's 30 minute show is so unbearable, I can barely watch a few minutes of it.  I don't know if it's the hosts/analysts and other contributors that deflate the program,  but the show is so stale, forced and just shallow. It's just a lazy program thrown in the mix that adds nothing.   The only stories they talk about come days after they have already been beat to death by every other soccer media outlet.  I've never seen such a bland and boring show for something I love. I can usually watch anything related to my interests.   It also has nothing to do with the fact that there is no MLS coverage, that is a rant for another day, but not being able to make a 30 minute show interesting when you're covering all of the European leagues, national teams, transfer rumors etc. is just baffling.   I know, I'm preaching to the choir - and it's been said so many times this post is everything I described about the show."
MLS,3do0jb,0piat3,5,Sat Jul 18 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"Espn is the worldwide leader when it comes to core sports. Nfl, NBA, MLB, and sometimes NHL. They have two daily shows just for NFL, another for college football, and a fourth just for fantasy football. They have never cared about fringe sports and it shows when they show soccer or ufc highlights on sportscenter. They usually make fun of it and move on. Fox sports however is capturing a decent market share by embracing racing, mma, and especially soccer. They care about it, and their anchors care about it. Now with them hiring big names like Colin cowherd, I expect FS1 to really compete with ESPN."

I am more optimistic, however, after reading about the amount of evidence the law firm hired by MLS was able to review. I assume the number one goal of the MLS investigation is avoiding negative publicity down the road, and that they were reassured that a) the accusations were taken seriously and evidence was properly collected and reviewed by officials, b) no significant evidence of wrongdoing was present or no evidence of wrongdoing was ignored, and c) no suggestion of bribery was found.  I'm no lawyer and don't have any specific knowledge of these types of outside case reviews by a third party, and would be interested to learn more about this process and how common it is, as well as the goals of the third party lawyers."

MLS,3dnzfo,EnglishHooligan,29,Fri Jul 17 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"Then my feelings would be even stronger. As a Chicago fan, I could at least consider the fact that we'll get a decent attendance boost from Drogba, and our merchandising sales should see a decent rise (and those could also be pros if we're speaking from a general MLS perspective, but still a bit more relevant to the everyday Chicago fan). As an ""American soccer"" fan, I'm disappointed that teams still have to sign 37 year old soccer players far from their prime for reasons that have been rendered moot a long time ago (the on field product has improved in quality to an extent where the impact of these players is minimal relative to younger alternatives that could be brought in). It's money that could be allocated for a far more effective, long-term solution instead. The league will only find sustainable success if teams focus on winning (like NYRB) instead of serving as marketing platforms for players who couldn't give a rat's ass about the club for more than a season or two. It's something that we need to move past."

MLS,3dnzfo,wafflesnsyrup,3,Fri Jul 17 22:40:06 2015 UTC,Bigger stars lead to more viewers of the MLS. We should be trying to grow a decent fanbase And by doing that you get big name players to come to MLS.
MLS,3dnzfo,Breklinho,10,Fri Jul 17 22:54:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'd argue that Chicago has been around long enough, with plenty of names and success, that one big name past his prime isn't going to suddenly grow/revitalize the fanbase, but I see where you're coming from. I could see how'd it would possibly draw in some casual/Chelsea fans into MLS in general. Thanks for expanding."

MLS,3dnzfo,Ahesterd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"I think you have to look at TV viewership as well, MLS just got that new TV deal with BEin and Drogba is pretty much a house hold name as far as world football goes.   Adding that kind of reputation to the league, regardless of on field product, is huge IMO. I think that one could argue that Drogba did as much for the Chelsea brand in Africa as he did on the pitch for the club.   As much as the quality of the league would benefit more from a Lucas Melano type signing like Portland made, the brand of the league is going to grow much more from Drogba.   Side note: I'm a Chelsea supporter and love Drogba"
MLS,3dnzfo,thenatesummers,5,Sat Jul 18 15:07:52 2015 UTC,I would argue that having a great stadium goes father in both attracting fans and long term development of a team as opposed to signing a past it big name.

I think you might get one, maybe two decent seasons from him, but nothing spectacular player-wise. His real value to me would come from working with young kids to grow the first team, not from contributing to the first team itself.  Right now, the Impact have one guy at the helm of the bulk of their academy, including their U23, u18, and FC Montreal USL teams. A very notable internationally known former captain with a lot of talent could do some good things for their academy, and having a bilingual presence should be a plus as well."

MLS,3dsukb,ihaveaquestion2013,20,Sun Jul 19 05:19:36 2015 UTC,Galaxy. No one's even close now.  The real question is who would pick Galaxy's bench over Colorado and Philly's starters.
MLS,3dsukb,notevenmyfinalporn,6,Sun Jul 19 03:12:29 2015 UTC,"I think full health Seattle wouldn't be too far behind, and then if they make use of the new Core Player rule they could easily give LA a run for their money"

MLS,3dsukb,notevenmyfinalporn,4,Sun Jul 19 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Looking at direct comparisons I'd say those positions are actually kind of close. I haven't seen Dunivant play in a while, but I'd imagine that he'd be of a similar as Leo G, Chad Barrett and Alan Gordon are both solid backups, although Gordon has been in better form this season, and who would Azira compare to, Varynyren?

MLS,3dsukb,Somebody_Call911,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:38:24 2015 UTC,I was thinking mainly in terms of those players as the first players off the bench compared to LA's top subs.

MLS,3dsukb,steveotheguide,3,Sun Jul 19 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call them the best but the Whitecaps have a lot of depth.  For example we started are (I think) 3rd and 5th best CB's tonight and they looked fine.  We have decent players like Earnshaw and Hurtado who do not ever really get minutes.  Mezquida really does not feel out of place when Morales is out, Techara I think would be a starter on most teams.  You get the idea.  Great example is that they have yet to start the same starting XI in any game this season."

Also, Brasil and Argentina play way more friendlies than most other countries so the combination of all that pretty much meant there was no hope in either coming on this tour.  not to mention these are 2 of the most fouled players in the wolrd and are now at a higher injury risk due to not having any sort of extended break."

MLS,3donye,harsh2k5,2,Sat Jul 18 00:07:17 2015 UTC,Seriously Seattle??   It's only 5%.  Fucking pay them: It's for the good of the sport.
MLS,3donye,j_arena,21,Sat Jul 18 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"The issue is bigger than that, which this article (despite the source) does a good job of presenting.  First off, it isn't Seattle but MLS who's on the hook, since Yedlin's contract was with MLS.  Secondly, a ruling in favor of Crossfire Premier would have implications on, in no particular order, MLS academies, pay-for-play youth soccer programs, the NCAA and their continuing myth of amateurism, the MLS draft, and pretty much every MLS signing of every U23 player (immediately from outside the US and Canada, but by implication those from the US and Canada as well).  Remember: this is not the first time this issue has come up, though previously it has had to do with the USSF refusing to pay solidarity funds for players developed abroad.  The fair thing obviously would be for MLS to apply the global standard and pay/distribute solidarity fees where applicable.  But how does pay-for-play at the youth level change the arithmetic? Should pay-for-play academies get paid twice? Why? If not, how do you manage the transition?  More importantly, would NCAA programs refusing solidarity payments negate the fact that some scholarship athletes are (contrary to all claims) athletes first, and students by circumstance?   Would any NCAA program refuse the money in the first place? And if they did take money from player sales, how would that affect the accusation that the NCAA is already a ""plantation system""? (Hint: Badly.)  Your accusations against Seattle are misplaced -- it isn't Seattle's call to make. Instead, it belongs to MLS and to the USSF. And if a ruling goes against them, for better or worse, it will change things greatly."
MLS,3donye,spisska,5,Sat Jul 18 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"This does raise some fascinating questions, especially regarding the NCAA.  Thinking out loud about the pay-to-play academies- at first I had a gut reaction similar to what you mentioned above- why should these pay-to-play academies get paid solidarity payments when they already get paid by all of their players?  If economically feasible (in that there was enough solidarity $ trickling down to allow these academies to train anyone who wanted to train for free or very cheaply) then I would love to see Leander's prediction of falling player fees come true. If nothing else, maybe this would encourage clubs to offer 'scholarships' of discounted academy training for promising players with limited means?  But in terms of limiting solidarity payments to pay-to-play academies so they don't receive a ""double payout"" - I'll argue there is no such thing as a ""free"" academy- academies operate to either receive payments from parents or to develop players for the purpose of making homegrown players/saleable players/usmnt stars. For academies with little of the latter incentive, at this time charging seems their only option. And as long as they aren't charging unreasonable prices for their training, it isn't like the pay-to-play academies were showing any more self-interest than the new MLS academies. So why should the pay-to-play academies not be entitled to their share.    That's the argument that I tried to logically settle on, but it doesn't sit well with me unless there is a way to ensure that the only academies entitled to these payments somehow pass some test of charging reasonable fees for their coaching and facilities. I don't love the idea of these expensive club teams, but even if every MLS-affiliated academy was free, there would still be kids living outside of their reach who would still be paying people to coach them in soccer. Instead of punishing them by banning them from receiving these payments, maybe use these solidarity payments as a carrot to be given to academies who meet certain standards for fair prices and inclusiveness? (Maybe that isn't legally possible to limit who is eligible for them?)  I apologize for my long-windedness! Interested to see everyone's thoughts on this subject!"
MLS,3donye,mxwlldsn,3,Sat Jul 18 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"The youth question is a really thorny issue.  In many countries programs for youth sports are often supported in part by national governments under the Ministry of Culture, Sport, Health, or whichever ministry has the portfolio.  On the one hand, in the US we'd never stand for the federal government supporting youth sports -- the US doesn't even fund its Olympic athletes.  On the other hand, most elite youth sports in the US are already funded by the government at a local level through schools.  This works fine for American football, baseball, and basketball, where elite high schools have top-notch programs that feed elite college programs (more for football and basketball; less so for baseball), that feed the pro leagues.  But soccer lags far behind in schools. Many schools have no soccer program at all, and many that do have a very low standard of coaching and training.  This is also complicated by the short playing season, which leads to absurd fixture congestion -- e.g. tournaments featuring four matches in three days, which means non-standard rules like unlimited subs.  This is why elite youth programs in the US, MLS academies included, often forbid their players from playing for their high-school teams.  Breaking out of this, and breaking out of the pay-for-play model, then becomes a chicken-and-egg scenario.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any solution easier than completely blowing up and redoing how the sport is treated at the high-school and college level.  Right now, those programs are nowhere near where they need to be to consistently develop professionals, and there's no reliable source of funding for non-school and non-MLS soccer academies to break away from pay-for-play."
MLS,3donye,spisska,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"Despite the source? Did you notice that the writer was Leander Schaerlaeckens? I know it was Yahoo!, but you have to look at the byline."
MLS,3donye,spisska,3,Sat Jul 18 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"I understand that. But the signal-to-noise ratio of Yahoo Sports is so low that anything they publish can get tainted by their reputation.  It's a bit like the Daily Mail. Every once in a while the Mail will publish something worth reading, but their quality is so poor the rest of the time that it's usually better to simply ignore them.  This isn't the fault of Leander Schaerlaeckens, but of Yahoo sports. They're simply a rubbish source, the occasional worthwhile article notwithstanding.  And as I hope I made clear, this piece was certainly worthwhile. It's a complicated topic about an issue that is existential in scope, and it's a topic that few people have thought about, and fewer still grasp the implications of.  The author is right that the issue of solidarity payments cuts to the core of how youth development of professionals happens in this country. And that's a conversation that no one seems to want to have.  If you want to complain that the prize pot for the women's World Cup is smaller than the men's World Cup without any knowledge of the economics of the sport, you'd have a much easier task.  Credit is due to the author for presenting a very tricky problem in a way that is understandable and relatable."

MLS,3do0qy,hasfarr,10,Fri Jul 17 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the new appointment /u/Dean_Moriarty   If I may ask, why the increase of moderators? Two new guys in less than 4 months. Is it because the sub has grown so big, or are they big CSS guru, or what? Just curious."
MLS,3do0qy,HOU-1836,3,Sat Jul 18 00:16:50 2015 UTC,I know /u/IWILLKickU recently got a job with a long commute and has said he will be less active on here even though he is still moderating so that may be part of it.  I imagine it is also in part due to past growth and the prospect of continued growth.
MLS,3do0qy,socialistbob,2,Sat Jul 18 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"I figure as much. Just usually I see moderator applications and I'm more familiar with /u/somecruzdude than this new guy so it seemed more obvious. I remember on slash MLS, they had Remy on, and he said something about not even being the head mod although a lot of people see him as such. So I'm just hoping for clarification on the direction of the sub if there is any changes imminent."
MLS,3do0qy,HOU-1836,4,Sat Jul 18 18:51:37 2015 UTC,"/u/socialistbob was mostly right with what they were saying. Here's the gist of it, and we'll probably expand on it more in the future.  1) Growth  We have had a huge amount of growth. I was added as a mod in January of this year and we gained just over 9,000 new subscribers (9,144~) in that time period. We had a huge increase at the start of the season and have become a trending subreddit once or twice. This number isn't going to falter anytime soon with MLS, NASL, USL, NWSL, etc. adding teams every year. The big signings coming in (Lampard, Gerrard, Pirlo, Giovinco, Dos Santos, Kaka, etc.) also have brought and will bring interest to this league.  2) Departure of a moderator   One of our former moderators (/u/TheMonsieur) had been inactive for 2-3 months. We heard nothing from him and so we had to drop him from the moderation team. This means we lost a mod, and would need another to go back to the same total of moderators which at that time may not have even been enough with our growth.  3) (Same) Departure of our CSS moderator  /u/TheMonsieur handled pretty much all the flair duties. Whether it was adding new flairs, fading flairs, etc. With him dropping out of the blue, we didn't have time to prepare to add a successor in his place especially if we wanted one specifically for CSS. There have been users who have helped specifically with redesigning the sub (I wasn't a mod yet) so we may end up adding a single mod for that. We will see.  4) This sub is increasing in activity and that means we have had a lot more spam, flame wars, etc. go on.  This is a bit behind the scenes. Despite having eight mods, we can still can miss certain things when checking the new queue, mod queue, etc. In the last few we've had incidents that we had to put out the fires of a flame war after they happened and even contact the admins because of a user who spammed was trying to get around having their account banned here.   By adding moderators who have been around this sub for years and have experience moderating club subs, we hope to try to keep the spirit of the ""old"" /r/MLS alive which was that it is a discussion place for all of American/Canadian soccer and everyone should feel welcome here. When we are pulled too thin and incidents slip in between the cracks for too long, that can increase the hostility that is in this place which is not good if we want new users to continue joining us."

THE MLS MEDIA STRATEGY IS NEAR PERFECT. THEY GIVE EVERY TEAM EXPOSURE ON ESPN, UNIVISION, & FS1, EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE WIDELY RECOGNIZED STARS. GAMES INVOLVING SALT LAKE OR SAN JOSE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE VIEWERS THAN GAMES INVOLVING NEW JERSEY, LOS ANGELES, AND CHICAGO. BUT ITS NOT ENOUGH. THE COMMISSIONER SNUBBING PLAYERS WHO HAVE PERFORMED WELL AND ACTUALLY GIVEN TIME, ENERGY AND BLOOD TO THE LEAGUE IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE ATTENTION TO THE CULT OF PERSONALITY SURROUNDING CERTAIN PLAYERS IS THE WRONG MOVE IN THE LONG RUN. IT SENDS A BAD MESSAGE TO FUTURE PLAYERS CONSIDERING ""SMALLER MARKETS"" IN MLS (IF YOU SIGN A DEAL TO PLAY IN  ____ YOU WON'T BE RECOGNIZED OR FEATURED). I HATE TO OVERUSE A CLICHE, BUT ITS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. RECOGNITION FOR THIS LEAGUE NEEDS TO BE BUILT, NOT BOUGHT. THERE ARE 20 TEAMS IN MLS, MR. GARBER, NOT 4.

MLS,3dp9x5,eggbeaterdiskerud,7,Sat Jul 18 03:32:34 2015 UTC,Because the whole Lampard saga has been a series of fuckups.
MLS,3dp9x5,YungGoonie,10,Sat Jul 18 08:14:59 2015 UTC,Lampard is English and more well marketed than Pirlo
MLS,3dp9x5,lcdodger,4,Sat Jul 18 04:17:37 2015 UTC,"Iraola isn't big, and there is much more hype over Lampard."
MLS,3dp9x5,mkbloodyen,16,Sat Jul 18 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"Because Lampard was ""signed"" a year ago and plastered all over Times Square.   Except that six months ago it turned out that he was never really signed to FCNYCFCFC, but rather to a nebulous entity called ""City Football Group"".  And upon further examination, City Football Group appears to be little more than a holding company that allows Manchester City yet one more avenue through which to flaunt UEFA regulations.  Lampard was the face of FCNYCFNYFNCYC when the team started and it was promised that he would be with the team from day one. He wasn't. And he wasn't loaned to Daddy City, because his contract was always with the Sheikh's holding company.  Hint: A holding company is a very effective mechanism for shuffling money around.  Lampard, excluding the loan deal that never was and acknowledging that he is a 2015 mid-season transfer rather than a 2014 signing would have begun play in MLS last week, except he didn't.   He was hurt. He might have started this week, but FCNCYCFCYCNC is away at New England, and Lampard will not play on a concrete-and-carpet surface that is best described as ""medieval"".  As shitty as the surface at Foxboro is, Lampard is player who has been aggressively marketed for over a year, and it's a good bet he will appear in fewer than 10 matches this season.  That's a pretty shitty deal from our side.  It remains to be seen how a midfield creator, who needs space to create, will manage on a pitch better sized for 9v9 ...  Did you have any other questions about why Frankie Lamps is now seen as less of a threat than a joke?"
MLS,3dp9x5,spisska,7,Sat Jul 18 04:18:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Gillette's (Foxboro got knocked down a long time ago) turf isn't that bad as far as player health concerns.  It's on par with the best artificial surfaces in the league, but it's just not meant for soccer.  The ball does not play well on it at all, maybe it's because there are particular artificial surfaces for football and soccer.  Safety-wise though it's no different than Century Link or Providence Park.  The Krafts may be hailed as cheap, but they wouldn't use shitty turf that puts their investments at risk, especially if Brady and the Patriots are playing on it as well."
MLS,3dp9x5,YoPoppaCapa,2,Sat Jul 18 05:19:57 2015 UTC,because Lampard will probably end up playing first than Pirlo. im sure they will start hyping pirlo up the week before he plays. he is eligible to play after july 21st. so you know the upcoming game against orlando thats when they will start hyping it up

He seems to have injury issues, and doesnt want to risk playing on turf. If he is not willing to risk getting injured on turf, why would he risk getting hurt in meaningless All-star game? It will show the NYCFC fans he is committed to the club, and show some solidarity with the players."

The WC saw Christen Press, Sydney Leroux, Alex Morgan, Amy Rodriguez, and Abby Wambach selected.   With Wambach possibly retiring internationally after the Olympics (or earlier) and Alex Morgan having injury issues, the USWNT should start calling up some more forwards.   Some NWSL leaders in scoring like Beverly Yanez (Seattle) and Sofia Huerta (Chicago) deserve calls up so that at the very least we can get them integrated and familiar with the team.  I hope for the best with Morgan, but the USWNT needs to prepare for the worst."

As the article states, his anticipation of where to find space in making is runs down the right flank is as good as anyone in the league right now. As much as I would like to see him get a call-up to the next USMNT camp, the Crew would certainly miss him in an Eastern Conference playoff race that's likely to go down to the wire."

At least publicly, there are more estimations and sketches than fully fleshed plans. And even if the city supports tax exemptions or breaks, the Legislature's approval still may be needed. While the St. Paul (""Midway"") site has a lot going for it in terms of mass transit and redevelopment potential, Downtown Minneapolis has the more appealing amenities for the foreseeable future: proximity to numerous hotels, trendy bars, destination restaurants and shopping, etc. The ownership group might be weary to let that slip away until it becomes 100% obvious Midway is the only logical choice."

The name itself is just okay, but the crest, colors, and jersey area all great (although I don't think Tesla would have any interest in a jersey sponsorship given that they don't even bother with TV ads). In any case, something close to that shade of turquoise should definitely be used as it looks very Miami... it was also used in the turquoise and pink colors of the branding for Miami Vice FC, which somebody tried to pass off as a leak.   Turquoise and pink would be nice colors for a Miami team... call it Beckham Blue and Posh Pink to assuage their egos..."
MLS,3dnf3f,xbhaskarx,21,Fri Jul 17 18:27:07 2015 UTC,"Those jerseys and colors are DOPE AF. Don't like the soccer ball in the logo. Looks kind of corny. But the rest of the logo looks sweet.   Only other beef with it is it seems EVERYONE across the American sport landscape is rebranding and coming out with those round, circular logos. Still looks cool apart from the soccer ball, though."
MLS,3dnf3f,notfrombudapest,14,Fri Jul 17 18:32:07 2015 UTC,"I actually like the soccer ball in the logo, and I usually don't. It is pretty subtle, unlike the Rochester Rhinos."

MLS,3dnf3f,KokonutMonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"The crest looks somewhat familiar, but I still like the overall concept and colors."

MLS,3dnf3f,TheBored23,5,Fri Jul 17 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"I will say that I want them to obviously have bright colors. Doing it any other way with dark colors wouldn't go over too well or represent the city.   The Hurricanes, Dolphins, and Marlins all have that Orange and Greenish-Blue color schemes going for them. I think it would be safe to be those colors, and it'd also bring some nice color into the league. I just hope they wouldn't try to pull off a kit that looks like the Dynamo.   If they keep it bright and Tropical then I don't think they can do any wrong.   With the name, what do y'all think of an actual nickname? Every new team is taking the European approach and sticking with 'city' United' and 'FC'. Not team with a decent nickname that is new is Orlando City.   Would it be too corny/MLS 1.0 to be something like the 'Miami Wave' (obviously a bad name but you get the idea). I would rather see that or just 'Miami SC' then to have yet another unoriginal name."

Ninja edit:  Either way, I would LOVE if the team went pink/light blue, or pink/gold, basically pink and anything.  Why?  Because it's very South Florida-ey, and because it'd be a unique scheme in MLS.  No more red/blue, red/black, something different.

MLS,3dmt0z,DABOSSROSS9,6,Fri Jul 17 15:27:50 2015 UTC,Seems like a replacement for brad?... What we really need is a center back to replace Taylor IMO.
MLS,3dmt0z,GlobalGeezer,11,Fri Jul 17 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"I think Sarkodie is the long term solution at RB and that Rodriguez's future in MLS is as a centerback.   Rodriguez is three years younger than Taylor. Cochrane has a chance to grow into the aerial/physical CB Rodriguez would probably need to be paired with to replace Horst in a season or two.   I think there's a good chance the replacements are already on the roster. And if it doesn't pan out you've got some time there.  Davis, as much as I love the guy, is going to be great until one day his speed just won't let him be effective on the wing. If he can't transition to the middle he'll be on an island quickly if his speed keeps slipping. Especially if he doesn't have a national team level left back helping to cover."
MLS,3dmt0z,sayas05,5,Fri Jul 17 16:00:40 2015 UTC,"Brad will get the Ching special. Play less and less and slowly become a player coach. Then boom, cushy job in the FO."
MLS,3dmt0z,HOU-1836,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with that once we have alternatives on the wing. But who? Lopez? McGinn? Someone has to take the position and not give it back.  Thing is, Davis' corners and freekick delivery will be dangerous until the sun supernovas and the earth goes the way of the dodo, but he can't be a liability on defense in order to stay on the field as he ages to swing in the corners.  As a central mid, shielded by a dedicated CDM behind him, Davis can play for several seasons longer than he could out on the wing. He has the positional acumen to overcome his speed leaving and has rededicated himself to fitness the past few seasons which will help.  At least, in my opinion, in a sport where a single goal changes everything his world class delivery can make him an MLS player for at least a few more seasons."
MLS,3dmt0z,sayas05,6,Fri Jul 17 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you. You can't really replace a player like Davis though. Guy is an MLS HoFer even if the league is only 20. There aren't too many players who can serve the ball like him and aren't million dollar DPs. So when he does finally hang his shoes up for the last time, the Dynamo will have to adapt as a team. No more set piece wizards."

MLS,3dmt0z,HOU-1836,10,Fri Jul 17 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"...and now I'm picturing Tally Hall taking Davis for a last Whataburger on the way to the farm.  Davis' knees make getting into the truck difficult, he needs help getting in, but he's smiling. The farm! They're going to the farm! They hadn't done this since Tally went to Orlando. Davis briefly seems like a rookie again.  Hall drives silently with his teeth clinched and a tear welling in his eyes while Davis, oblivious, watches the doves through the window as they pass. They turn on the old dirt road and Hall slows so the truck doesn't bounce and disturb Davis.   Maybe he can chase the doves again with Tally and bag some - maybe that's why they're going to the farm! - it is just like old times. He'd like that, even though Davis can't run like he used to.   Hall knows it's for the best. He knows it is time. Ol' Brad won't be in pain much longer.     Why do goalkeeper careers last so much longer than outfield players? It just seems cruel."

MLS,3dmjld,Dabogimp5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"I go to my club games alone 80% of the time. I've made friends with some of the other STHs in my section and we all sit together now, which probably never would have happened if I dragged a friend out to every match."
MLS,3dmjld,j3zuz00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised how many people go alone, especially those with significant others who couldn't make it. I see a lot of people have mentioned it already, but find yourself a pre-match party, or a bar/pub/restaurant near the stadium and have a few pints with new friends."
MLS,3dmjld,theLoneliestAardvark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"I have a bad habit of buying extra tickets to US games as soon as they go on sale, then trying to convince people to go with me afterwards. I have a pretty good record, but have ended up at a couple of games solo. It's still a fun time, and in some ways more enjoyable, it's a lot easier to strike up random conversations when you're by yourself."
MLS,3dmjld,warpus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:16 2015 UTC,"I went to the game in Kansas city alone, My wife is pregnant and said hell no because of the heat. and my friends couldn't afford tickets.  I said screw it I'm not missing this game.  Grabbed my bright red shirt, my us Scarf and headed to the game.  sat surrounded by people who were there for the same reason I am, they love the game, they love their nations team. and want to have fun.  I yelled and chanted my heart out. and lost about 10 pounds in sweat but it was worth it.  even though I was alone it sure didn't feel like it everyone was talking and giving out high fives.  I don't think being alone affected my experience at all."
MLS,3dmjld,mocisme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:36 2015 UTC,Go! I went to the MLS Cup last year by myself. Had a blast!
MLS,3dmjld,Lomotograph,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:05 2015 UTC,I'm going alone! All my friends and family live too far away so I'm taking the train up from Virginia and walking to the stadium. Never been to a game above PDL level before so it should be exciting!
MLS,3do1av,LemonStealer,8,Fri Jul 17 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"Courtesy is that if you grab random seats and someone later comes with a ticket for that seat, you move.  At US vs Netherlands in Amsterdam a few weeks ago, this was the same policy (assigned seats), and I don't recall too many people being forced to move.  But, it's up to the ticketholder."
MLS,3do1av,drgath,2,Fri Jul 17 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"Might be the stadium rules. If so that sucks, no SG section should be assigned seating"
MLS,3do1av,white_lightning,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:20:44 2015 UTC,We've been told in Atlanta that Concacaf is being pretty insistent upon assigned seating.

MLS,3dmvra,ravegreener,19,Fri Jul 17 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"I mean... Chivas fans refer to their current run of form as ""The Dark Ages"" and he's already run one team named Chivas into oblivion.  I don't think Jorge Vergara's opinion counts for much."
MLS,3dmvra,secretlyadog,8,Fri Jul 17 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"Actually last season was a pretty good season. Got into playoffs, but got eliminated by the eventual champion Santos."
MLS,3dmvra,JuniorCDC,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:32 2015 UTC,Yes but it was something like 4-0. A shit team with a good streak thats all.
MLS,3dmvra,Dymo342,7,Fri Jul 17 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"Chivas was 5th only three points away from leaders Tigres and their defense was the second best in the league after Cruz Azul. They weren't world beaters but they did have a pretty good season, they beat local rivals Atlas 4-1 and lost to the eventual champs in the semis, also Chivas went to a Copa Libertadores final with Vergara in charge, the problem was his wife Angelica Fuentes who took charge of Chivas and Omnilife in 2011 (the start of the dark ages), this renewed form for Chivas coincides with Vergara and Fuentes getting divorced and she being kicked from the company."
MLS,3dmvra,Luccfi,4,Fri Jul 17 19:00:02 2015 UTC,"We'll get another plane...we'll do it!  Get your voice out of here, Vergara."

MLS,3dmvra,SCarolinaSoccerNut,3,Fri Jul 17 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"Liga MX owners would put whatever pressure necessary to prevent him from coming to MLS.  MLS becoming a destination for Mexican players would hurt the bottom line.  They can play off GDS, but Chicharito coming as well would hurt I imagine."

MLS,3dmvra,lookuppage7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:32:51 2015 UTC,I don't think he is either. It sounds like United want to keep him. It makes sense we haven't purchased a striker and our options are Rooney and Wilson. Wilson is still young and needs work. So I can imagine us keeping him as a supersub/back up for Rooney.

MLS,3dmvra,tortilladude,6,Fri Jul 17 19:58:44 2015 UTC,Because all Mexican fans are bad. right.
MLS,3dmvra,Maxmoxie,2,Fri Jul 17 20:01:00 2015 UTC,We're just extremely passionate because we don't get much to be proud of other than our players although I agree there are a good few who aren't respectable but everyone has those few in their fan base.
MLS,3dmvra,David21538,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:23 2015 UTC,Ouch.  Not what I meant at all.  I just think he is a very over-hyped player that would attract a lot of attention to come to MLS but may not necessarily dominate play (although many would suggest otherwise simply due to the clubs he has been at)
MLS,3dmvra,timberrich,-4,Fri Jul 17 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"It would be great to see an MLS team knock out Chivas in the CCL, but that would require chivas making it out of their group  edit: Does making fun of Chivas not making it out of their group in the CCL strike a chord in this sub?"

MLS,3dm0s0,steerbell,5,Fri Jul 17 12:25:45 2015 UTC,"One of the many great things anout this investigation is that it opens the floodgates for other countries to investigate as well. Venezuela raided CONMEBOL headquarters, Switzerland is investigation 50+ people and the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 world cup, Ghana is auditing its FA for corruption and missing funds, la Liga is sueing FIFA Over the 2022 world cup and other countries are agreeing to extradite. Soon there will be no safe place left for FIFA and once wrong doing is found more arrests will be made."
