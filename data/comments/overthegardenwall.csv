Why would his soul be there in the first place?   Not sure why this matters, best answer I can think of is.. that's just how it is. Maybe it's a cursed lantern, maybe that's just how ""the beast's"" existence works.   If Wirt and Greg were just having a near-death dream the whole time, how do all these other people exist?   The ending is open to interpretation. If you actually expect the other people to exist, then you could argue that they actually walked through the land between life and death--the Unknown. Otherwise, just let the closing of the other characters' stories be for the sake of closure for the audience.   Was there even a wall? They just climbed out and people were there trying to find them.   It's a wall. There are many ways to get around a wall. It is uncertain for how long they were underwater, but people can survive for at least a couple of minutes without air.   I don't understand anything about what really happened with the Woodsman. His daughter was there the whole time, and she carried a lantern, I don't get it.   He probably went back and was too distraught to go inside, so he sat outside? Daughter came out with a lantern (not the beast's lantern).   And then there was a fish fishing for those black turtles, was this real?   Again, it depends on how you interpret the ending. If it was a dream, nothing was real; if not, maybe not.   What's with the statues of a lot of the characters?   Not sure what you're referring to.   So, some circus inspired characters like the angel in Greg'd dream and the gorilla?   Not sure what you're asking.   How was Enoch a cat?   It's a cartoon. How are there skeletons moving around? How can toads sing? Not sure what type of answer you're expecting.   Was Beatrice's tale true or not? Was it a dream she had, and then told her family or something?   Nothing indicates that it was a dream. Not sure why you would think it was Beatrice's dream, since we saw the story following Greg and Wert.  Not feelin' your last few questions since I don't really remember the opening."

Also, you don't seem to remember the opening and ending that well, that's fine. I found a video with both.   It's a wall. There are many ways to get around a wall. It is uncertain for how long they were underwater, but people can survive for at least a couple of minutes without air.   I meant how they got out of the water and there was seemingly no wall or train track in sight. In fact, it looked like they had not gone over the wall in the first place, it looked like they were in the graveyard.   He probably went back and was too distraught to go inside, so he sat outside?   Maybe you don't understand it as much as I don't, so this still doesn't make sense. What was he distraught from? Why was he so surprised to see his daughter?   What's with the statues of a lot of the characters?  Not sure what you're referring to.   See the link I left at the top of this comment, around 1:18.   So, some circus inspired characters like the angel in Greg'd dream and the gorilla?  Not sure what you're asking.   Supposed to be ""Greg's"". See the link at the top of this comment, around 1:20.   It's a cartoon. How are there skeletons moving around? How can toads sing? Not sure what type of answer you're expecting.   I guess, but everything else seemed to have some sort of valid reason. I don't like the idea of ""I don't know how to explain this, so let's say a cat controlled him!"" Maybe it's some sort of symbolism?   Nothing indicates that it was a dream. Not sure why you would think it was Beatrice's dream, since we saw the story following Greg and Wert.   Well, her mother was making fun of Beatrice by saying ""What are you gonna do about it? Turn us into bluebirds again?"" I thought she was implying that it was either some story or dream that Beatrice told her family about, with them all making fun of her for it.   Also, to add to my questions, what was the symbolism in the openings and endings?"

They rolled down a hill first, so there shouldn't be any wall or train track in sight, just a hill, which there is.   Maybe you don't understand it as much as I don't, so this still doesn't make sense. What was he distraught from? Why was he so surprised to see his daughter?   He was still under the impression, for whatever reason, that his daughter was not alive. He probably doesn't want to go back inside to an empty house, since that's pretty depressing.   What's with the statues of a lot of the characters?   They're all the characters from the tavern. There was probably some professional that could make them, and he was just updating his collection.   So, some circus inspired characters like the angel in Greg's dream and the gorilla?   This still doesn't ask anything. It's just a partial statement with a question mark. Yes, there is a circus; Jimmy Brown worked there as the gorilla to make money to marry the teacher. I don't think the angel is all that circus-inspired or relevant to the gorilla.   I guess, but everything else seemed to have some sort of valid reason. I don't like the idea of ""I don't know how to explain this, so let's say a cat controlled him!"" Maybe it's some sort of symbolism?   If you want to look deeply into it, you can probably find something. Pilgrims thought that black cats were associated with Satan, which makes sense because Satan and death are strongly related. The cat in the beginning is Enoch, and he is bringing pumpkins to prepare for the festival. Also, you might not like it, but it is a cartoon, made by artists and writers. Sometimes there really isn't a good reason, other than they thought it fit. Black cats and pumpkins seemed to fit (Halloween, for instance; not saying the writers were tipping their hat to Halloween or anything, but the two just go together).   Well, her mother was making fun of Beatrice by saying ""What are you gonna do about it? Turn us into bluebirds again?"" I thought she was implying that it was either some story or dream that Beatrice told her family about, with them all making fun of her for it.   I think they were all just being a good sport about it, seeing as how they thought they lost her when they were all bluebirds.  Not sure about symbolism.. but it's pretty clear that it's just the beginning and end of each story we followed.   Beatrice sees a bluebird (goes on to curse her and her family) -> they're all back to human Enoch prepares for the festival -> Enoch is done with the festival Trinkets (minus Wirt, Greg, and the frog) -> new trinkets Circus that Jimmy Brown worked at -> Jimmy Brown and the teacher + headmaster visiting the circus Endicott thinks he sees the ghost -> the competitor is happily staring at his portrait Adelade with her scissors (dead) The tugboat for the frogs -> frog peaks its head out of the mud Lorna sorting bones -> sitting happily with Auntie Whispers The fish that's fishing -> catches a turtle Greg takes the rock facts rock -> he puts back the rock The woodsman and his daughter -> they reunite   Not much symbolism to any of it. Just closure."
overthegardenwall,3b4ksk,2718281828,8,Fri Jun 26 03:11:59 2015 UTC,it's just the beginning and end of each story we followed   I made this to visualize it side-by-side. The left side was presented from top to bottom. The right side was presented starting at the bottom and going up.

Well, /u/2718281828 noticed the wall in the background, so there's that. But I'm still confused on how they got back over the wall and to ambulances.   If you want to look deeply into it, you can probably find something. Pilgrims thought that black cats were associated with Satan, which makes sense because Satan and death are strongly related.

You can't see the track because of the angle.   statues of a lot of the characters   Those beginning and ending shots match up with each episode in order (but reversed for the ending shots). The character figures matched up with episode 4 (""Songs of the Dark Lantern"") so they must have been made by The Toymaker.   I thought she was implying that it was either some story or dream   That's not my interpretation. I think it actually happened, but they took it in stride and were lightly mocking her for it. It wouldn't make sense if it were a dream since we see Beatrice and her mom affect the story."

overthegardenwall,39f6im,katzekuchen,4,Thu Jun 11 11:33:09 2015 UTC,"I think the Pines Parents would have to be Squib(s), which is totally possible.  What confused me was that Wirt was Half-Blood but Greg was Muggle-Born.  But I guess if their mom is a Squib, it technically works out?"
overthegardenwall,39f6im,Djkarasu,5,Thu Jun 11 12:23:23 2015 UTC,"But aren't Wirt and Greg only half-brothers? Um... Wirt's father is supposedly a pureblood who left.

overthegardenwall,39cyq2,smoogyvonsmoogy,3,Wed Jun 10 22:49:44 2015 UTC,"I liked this review, although I disagreed with Wirt's character being a stereotype. He felt very unique and fresh to me. I also disagree about the ending! To me, the ending was the best part and did a beautiful job of tying everything together! I don't know how he saw it as pretentious.  Basically, I liked all the positive things he said about OtGW."
overthegardenwall,398lmb,xMyStEr,11,Wed Jun 10 01:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thats really an interesting spin on the story and why I love OTGW. You can make so many interpretations out of each character and event and there is a chance that it could be right.  If you think about it through misconceptions, the Beast was good in his own perspective; he was trying to keep himself alive. While others might not believe that his actions are righteous, he was only trying to keep himself alive."
overthegardenwall,398lmb,Plutonium-Lore,8,Wed Jun 10 01:25:43 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the grave is more a nod to the possibility and currently the strongest contending theory that Wirt and Fred are lost in the afterlife, and that the Endicott they were talking to is dead. The beast is also probably just evil since the misconception for the boys was that the woodsman was the beast, but in fact he was just carrying the beast's lantern."
overthegardenwall,398lmb,meldorp,2,Wed Jun 10 03:48:00 2015 UTC,"So I wish I could link you to this, but I read somewhere that in the original draft of The Beast, he was planned to be revealed as a good character in the end. I don't think that was the case in the actual series, but you can definitely see that regardless of whether or not the beast is inherently evil, he has to do what he does to survive, so in that way, an unbiased spectator might say that the beast was neutral.  As for Endicott, I think he's more likely just mad. Also, there are a lot of dirty ways to gain money besides murder. Hard to say for sure though."
overthegardenwall,398lmb,Chieflolcat,2,Wed Jun 10 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"Similar to the bad/good/bad(?) idea for 'Quincy', Auntie Whispers moves back towards neutral/evil territory when you consider how simple the command to remove the spirit was, and then her reaction about how the girl had no need for her so she'd need leave.  Its a good job the girl agreed to stay, lets put it that way. Auntie Whispers was winding up into a classic sob story for emotional blackmail before she stayed."

Though I will say that while the material is relatively thin and made of a polyester/cotton 50/50 combo, I wouldn't call it breathable.

It's a pretty blatant reference. If anyone brings it up they are either a fan or are going to be after I explain my avant garde fashion style.  There are some more subtle designs available if you wanted to avoid giving an explanation for your shirt every time you go out, but I thought I might as well go big or go home.

overthegardenwall,38uczk,deadaluspark,6,Sat Jun 6 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"Not that OtWG actually needs one, but hypothetically speaking Gravity Falls would be an obvious choice - if we ignore the fact that it's from a different network. Even the art style is fairly similar. An episode about the twins (who are a lot like Wirt and Greg, come to think of it) getting lost somewhere in The Unknown would fit that show perfectly. And some of Gravity Falls characters, like the 8 1/2th President, or that Halloween episode monster would look very much at home in The Unknown.  Not to mention, there's already a decent amount of crossover fan art of those two shows all around the Internet."

Maybe Regular Show IS in the same universe as Over the Garden Wall and Clarence, but just from a different perspective. Alternatively, Regular Show is actually the future of the Unknown after it gets out of the late 1800s-early 1900s phase and into the straight on 1980s. Maybe there's actually some split timeline trickery here that links right on two a dual Unified Cartoon Network theory."
