dashcamgifs,3dxqmi,NotBatman374,2,Mon Jul 20 15:33:37 2015 UTC,"...What your witnessing is the force of a car striking the back of a motorcycle, lifting up its front wheel slightly. The dude was at a complete stop, popping a wheelie without momentum would mean he'd have to plant both his feet and lift the handlebars in the .2 seconds between him noticing the car and the car striking him. Regardless, a wheelie wouldnt of helped him."
dashcamgifs,3dxqmi,tastypotato,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:42 2015 UTC,I mostly agree with you but having momentum is the enemy of a wheely. Doing it from a stand still is the easiest way.   He still didn't do it but not moving allows you to access the most amount of torque/power available. The faster the bike goes the less potential acceleration it has and thus the harder it is to lift the front tire.
dashcamgifs,3dxqmi,Antal_Marius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"Thats certainly true for a bicycle. i think its considerably harder to do a wheelie from a sitting position on a motorcycle with no force from the rear tire kicking up the front, since you have the engine and other mechanical parts which weigh the bike down. But i cant really see the bike to see how big it is. Could be a dirt bike for all i know, which would be much easier then a big ol motorcycle to wheelie."

In this case, the motorcyclist could have avoided the accident by changing lanes in a more controlled manner, and the car could have avoided the accident by checking their mirrors and not turning into the bike that had been driving behind them.  Just because a crash isn't your fault, doesn't mean you can't do anything to avoid it."
dashcamgifs,3ab83e,jrh1406,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:59:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. The car probably focused on the yellow car in front of him. Forgetting to periodically check his mirrors.  But the motorcycle switched lanes in his blind spot and ignored the white car's turn signals. So it was his fault but the car could have prevented it too.
dashcamgifs,3ab83e,Houwert,3,Thu Jun 18 21:04:57 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the motorcyclist was definitely at fault, I also didn't notice that the car had his turn signal on the whole time the first time I watched it.  Definitely a dick move by the motorcyclist.  I run into both kinds of people almost every day, people who don't check their mirrors and merge directly in front of me, and people who just swerve around me when I'm trying to change lanes.  It makes me want to crush their vehicles into small cubes."

dashcamgifs,3a60d4,Protuhj,7,Wed Jun 17 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"A sneeze would do it. I've seen that happen, Actually. I was at a track day at Texas World Speedway. We were in turn 10, which was a lovely, round 200 degree-ish constant radius right, nice, long, you can get a knee and elbow down and accelerate through the whole thing type of turn.  A guy right in front of me settles in and is winding through it when Bam, he's gone. They red flag the session so we hit the paddocks and soon the kid comes in on the back of a truck with a banged up bike. We ask what happened and he explained that he had to sneeze and next thing he knows, he is sitting on his ass in the run-out."

dashcamgifs,3a14s3,xCaldazar,16,Tue Jun 16 14:45:24 2015 UTC,The car was looks to be making an unprotected left. They were probably waiting in the intersection until the oncoming traffic eased up.
dashcamgifs,3a14s3,MrTubes,5,Tue Jun 16 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/xCaldazar's suggestion that the car was waiting in the intersection to turn. They saw the light turn yellow, saw no vehicles entering the intersection and proceeded to complete the turn. The motorcycle passes the dash cam a full two car lengths back from the intersection, just after the light has turned red. By this point the car has already been accelerating to clear the intersection before the cross traffic gets a green, and at this point the motorcycle enters the intersection.   My conclusion is it's clear the motorcycle ran the red. It isn't clear the car did anything inappropriate. Perhaps they moved too quickly to clear the intersection making the turn and could have been more careful, but I find it impossible to conclude the car shares in significant blame based on the video angle we have."
dashcamgifs,3a14s3,WeSingVeryLoud,2,Tue Jun 16 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"That's why I said it seems. Where I live, sitting in the intersection waiting to turn left is illegal, and would result in a red light ticket."
dashcamgifs,3a14s3,danjr321,3,Tue Jun 16 18:56:46 2015 UTC,"Where do you live? I live in Michigan and we are taught in drivers ed to creep forward and ""claim our intersection"" until a suitable break in traffic, or the light turns yellow/red. If the light turns then you have to turn in order to clear the intersection. I have never seen anyone ticketed for this maneuver."
dashcamgifs,3a14s3,MrTubes,2,Tue Jun 16 20:50:51 2015 UTC,The silver car at the lead of the line of cars in the left lane appears to be doing the same thing as the car at question. Entering the intersection and completing the turn at the end of the light seems to either be common or legal here.
dashcamgifs,3a14s3,xCaldazar,2,Tue Jun 16 19:08:10 2015 UTC,Where do you live because a quick google search didn't show up a state where it's totally illegal? It seems waiting in the intersection can easily be seen as yielding and creeping forward for better visibility.
dashcamgifs,3a14s3,fyshi,2,Tue Jun 16 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"That's one of the first things I realized while watching hundreds of Russian dashcam videos. There are always already cars in the intersection when the other lane just changed to orange or is on the verge of changing to red. Either they constantly run reds, or what's more likely, their traffic light system is totally fucked. I think the other lanes get green way too fast. Many many crashs could be avoided if it waited until the other lights turn red completely."
dashcamgifs,3a14s3,TheDovahkiinsDad,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"Many cities have a turn arrow while one light is red. This looks like the case. One turns red, the turn arrow turns green.

dashcamgifs,39xd8x,KevinBrown,3,Tue Jun 16 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"The only reason filtering is even slightly dangerous is because most people are moron and would open their doors, or change lane without seeing the motorbike.

If so, the girl would need another few seconds to concentrate on removing the hook, methinks, but apparently she just lifts it from the floor, as if it's just laying there, totally unhooked.

dashcamgifs,38ow7a,YouAndMeToo,5,Fri Jun 5 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"Epinephrine:       Error in template * unknown parameter name (Template:Infobox_drug): 'CASNo_Ref'  Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline, adrenalin, or β,3,4-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine) is a hormone and a neurotransmitter.  Epinephrine and norepinephrine are two separate but related hormones secreted by the medulla of the adrenal glands. They are also produced at the ends of sympathetic nerve fibres, where they serve as chemical mediators for conveying the nerve impulses to effector organs.  The investigation of the pharmacology of epinephrine made a major contribution to the understanding of the autonomic system and the function of the sympathetic system. Epinephrine remains a useful medicine for several emergency indications. This is despite its non-specific action on adrenoceptors and the subsequent development of multiple selective medicines that target subtypes of the adrenoceptors. The word adrenaline is used in common parlance to denote increased activation of the sympathetic system associated with the energy and excitement of the fight-or-flight response.   The influence of adrenaline is mainly limited to a metabolic effect and bronchodilation effect on organs devoid of direct sympathetic innervation.    In chemical terms, epinephrine is one of a group of monoamines called the catecholamines. It is produced in some neurons of the central nervous system, and in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla from the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.

dashcamgifs,36w0p9,Razorray21,10,Fri May 22 16:18:21 2015 UTC,"Let's consider this for a moment. Think about sitting in your car, and the things between you and the outside (not including the roof). You really only have a steering wheel and a dashboard.  Now let's pretend you are sitting still, in that car that's isn't moving with the top down. Imagine what kind of force would be required to hit the bottom of that car to knock you 10 feet in the air. We have all seen videos of people launching themselves with airbags, but that force is only acting on the person, not the car and then transmitting what wasn't absorbed by the car into the person. A massive amount of energy is needed to do that.   Now let's step it up. you are cruising along at 70 mph and hit a barrier. That force originates perpendicular to the direction you are being launched. Prior to being launched up in the air 10 feet, inertia forces you forward, meaning more of your body, your hips and legs are now under the dash and steering wheel.  Your chest absorbs some of the impact from the steering column and the energy transmitted through you had no where to go.   If you tensed up and are holding your breath, it has popped your lungs like a paper bag. Your sternum shatters, and you have multiple rib fractures. If at least one of your lungs is intact, you might notice a condition called paradoxical breathing, where your ribs move counter to the mechanics necessary to lower the pressure in your lungs so that you can inhale. This carries a lovely name called Flail chest.   When your head hits the windshield, it shatters the windshield, dissipating even more energy, but some of that energy is left and inertia slams your brain against the front of your skull. Since your brain is jelly-like, a wave forms and is reabsorbed and reverses the impact with your skull and it now hits the back of your skull as well. This causes a swelling and the only place your brain can go is out of the hole your spinal column attaches through. This is also the same general region that your phrenic nerve is and that is the one that controls your diaphragm, but since you have a shattered rib cage and your lungs have exploded, this won't really matter much.  Next the force translates from horizontal to vertical, because the car is no longer absorbing impact and the energy has to go somewhere. All the energy that is left shoots into your backside and propels you up. As you fly upwards, the car does its level best to continue to protect you. The dashboard tries to absorb some of that energy by grabbing your legs, but only succeeds in snapping your femurs. The steering wheel tries to stop your hips, but the energy isn't fully absorbed and the rebound shatters your pelvis. Let's consider that a fracture pelvis can hemorrhage 3 liters of blood easily, and femur can hemorrhage 1 liter each into your body cavities. Considering the body only holds 5.5 liters of blood, this isn't good.  It is now .02 of a second after initial impact and you are now fully out of the car, in the air above your hood. Let's consider now how much it would hurt it you were on top of a 10 ft ladder and belly-flopping onto the ground. Now throw shattered glass and broken plastic and twisted bits of metal under you. Oh and do all of that while moving forward at 70 mph.  As soon as you hit, you being to tumble, hopefully not under the wheels of another car. All of the energy from the initial impact that transmitted into you and hasn't yet dissipated now transforms from linear momentum to angular momentum that is bound to a fairly small (but now, quite variable) radius. The only way to deplete this energy is through whatever forces are necessary to break any remaining long bones and through whatever friction exist between your skin and the pavement.  We are now 3 seconds after the impact and you have stopped all the flying and the tumbling and have come to rest. The thing about it is, you are already dead, your body just doesn't realize it yet. You are as dead as is you had been decapitated. The only real difference is, with a straight decapitation, you have more systems intact than you do now. Think about that. 5 seconds ago, you had hope and dreams, now...nothing.   Hopefully your last though was of something pleasant and heartwarming and not ""fuck, I should have buckled up""."

Physically batter driver? Check!   That's 4 opportunities to de-escalate, all refused. Over a non-incident in a pedestrian crosswalk.  Surprisingly, he stopped short of beating the driver to death, so that will take one-tenth of a point off his score for an otherwise a spectacular display of lizard-brain douchbaggery.

I am Russian so let me explain how I see this entire situation. De-escalation works when everyone involved tries to make it right. There is no need to escalate a conflict when it was just an accident without bad intentions or any harm done. One party can just say ""sorry"" and the other reply with ""no worries"" and everyone go on with their lives. In this case there was no physical harm done at first, but it seems to me that the driver had no intentions of stopping, he even flashed his lights, like ""give way you peasant!"". Ignore him and go about your day, fine, but it would reinforce this kind of behavior and his ""king of life"" attitude. You said that things should be settled in court, but what is there to settle if nothing really happened? Cops would just laugh at you, literally. Now after the incident the driver could go to cops and the pedestrian could find himself in real trouble, depending on how badly the driver wants him to pay and connections he has. The pedestrian here made the society slightly better by discouraging this type of behavior and he put himself at risk at the same time. Also it may be a bad situation but when offended you don't act like nothing happened, it just ain't that way.  And by the way, humans are apes.  I am curious, which country you are from? No bad feelings here or anything, I'm sincerely interested."

dashcamgifs,34tgzr,MystikIncarnate,-2,Mon May 4 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I wasn't aware there was some kind of stigma surrounding Honda drivers.  I'll be sure to buy another brand to ensure I don't offend you next time.  Seriously though, I don't consider myself a super-hero at driving.  I do consider myself above-average, but not because the car I drive is a Honda.  In fact, the car I learned on, and I attribute the majority of my skill to is a Mazda 626.  I loved that car, but due to circumstances, I ended up driving several Hondas.  I was very impressed with the reliability and craftsmanship of the vehicle, relative to the price, and seriously considered it during my next purchase, that's how I ended up with the '12 civic.  Obviously a lot of thought went into my choice.  Regardless of my story, I am unaware of why one would consider themselves a ""super-hero at driving"" because they chose one specific manufacturer.  I take it from your tone that the comment was made sarcastically (I wasn't entirely certain at first, now I am much more certain).  May I venture a guess and say that it might be because of all the ricer-racers on the road, spinning the tires on old hatchback civics?"
dashcamgifs,34tgzr,MystikIncarnate,2,Tue May 5 05:41:20 2015 UTC,"You venture a guess correctly.  Nothing against Hondas or their drivers, really. Hell my mom drives one. They are top quality machines. There is just a mass quantity of boy-racers who think their Honda is a serious performance driving machine, and who think they are pro at driving (when it is likely they have never experienced other drivetrain layouts, nor could maintain anything close to the limit of their vehicle in cornering).  No offense, but everyone thinks they are above average and can control a vehicle in a slide - until it happens. Then it's over-correction, late correction, inappropriate braking, lack of throttle modulation...  You probably are not aware of this because of your experience, and you may never need to know, but front engine/front wheel drive is typically the worst performing drive train configuration.  FWD is easy to control because of the principle of ""Flight of the lead-tipped-arrow""... meaning the car wants to follow the engine, transmission, axles, and everything else heavy that is up front. This gives front-wheel drive stability. However, because all the weight is so far forward, the car lacks overall balance when cornering. It is harder to rotate a FWD car, so they typically under-steer (front tires do not grip when attempting to turn, car ""pushes"" forward instead of turning). This can sort of be countered by trail-braking into a corner for more weight on the front wheels, but that also runs the risk of the rear breaking loose. Most factory tuned cars are set-up for slight understeer at the limit since it is safer, even RWD.  FWD has the advantage when it comes to fuel mileage and cost of production. It also allows the manufacturer more interior room because there is no transmission or drive axle hump down the center of the vehicle. There are a number of performance FWD vehicles that handle well, such as the Integra Type R. (Some other notable examples are the Mazdaspeed3, the Civic Si, the 3000GT SL, the Acura RSX, the Toyota Celica GT-S, and many more). However, even the Integra R barely skirts the realm of ""Excellent"" handling, and it is blessed from the factory with a limited slip differential, something that most every FWD car lacks.  Something like a Nissan GTR really does make someone better at driving (not quite a superhero though), as the computer controlled AWD/ABS/Stability Control/Paddle shifting system will compensate for a lack of finesse.  If a Honda driver were to attempt this maneuver/crash-save and remain in control, it would certainly be because of their knowledge of car-control, and luck! Keep in mind that this was an accidental PIT on the innocent car, and even trained Police in their 4,000lbs RWD Crown Victoria cruisers mess up and lose control when attempting to do this intentionally! A FWD Honda would be among the worst vehicle to attempt this in...  So hopefully that kind of clears things up :)"
dashcamgifs,34tgzr,teashroomed,1 point,Tue May 5 06:10:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, so much information.  I can say with absolute sincerity, thank you for the insight.  I understand and agree that many, or most, drivers believe they are above average, yet are not, however, there have been instances where I have started to slide, and lose control, and I have been able to regain control with little difficulty.  Most notably: while going at highway speed in my first standard, a 1992 Honda Accord, around a curve in the rain, my rear started to slide, I just about spun but I was able to regain and sustain control; most notably, I avoided hitting the brakes, which would have made the rear slide more.  I know this is demonstrating your point of ""Flight of the lead-tipped arrow"" and I agree, this, by far, doesn't qualify me as an excellent driver.  I still maintain I'm ""above average"" (the one example given isn't the only example, just one of the more prominent in my mind), due to the sheer number of cars I've seen spun out on the specific curve where I nearly lost control.  I pushed the cornering too hard for the conditions and if it wasn't for sheer skill, I would have lost the car.  By no means, does this indicate I should get into a stock car and race around an Indy 500 track, nor does it mean I'm better than everyone else on the road.  I presume everyone has a certain level of competency, and no more, simply because if I assume other drivers are smart, then I'll maneuver in ways that will take less skilled drivers by surprise, because they have less situational awareness than better drivers.  I don't want to accept that risk so I tend to drive as if everyone around me is a moron.... I think we all do this though.  I accept and agree with just about every statement you've made about FWD; and it's funny you should mention the Civic Si.  I'm actually one trim level below the Si; Though, I would have loved to pick up an Si, it wasn't in the cards for me.  I'm very happy with my car as a daily driver; I drive it stock because I'm not racing it anywhere, and I don't presume that either the car could handle a race, nor could I.  as stock, it still has an adequate amount of pick up, to keep me satisfied.... and that's what I wanted from the car.  Personally, I don't feel like I fit into the stereotypical mindset of the ricer Honda owner.  I have no desire to ""supe up"" my Civic, or to put a shitcan ""kazoo"" muffler on it.  I don't think that v-tech makes my car special.  A huge part of the reason I own this car would be betrayed if I did want any of those things.  I need it for reliable transportation to/from work, at an inexpensive cost.  To keep me from wanting to replace it, the car also needs a reasonable amount of performance, with decent features, to keep me from searching for a car that has what I want.  I got everything I wanted in a daily driver in this car.  TBH, I'm leaving any modifications or changes to project cars, I just had my two (2), 1986 Pontiac Fiero GT's show up at a family member's shop, and I'm actually quite eager to pull them apart.  They're not fancy or special or expensive, or even that powerful, but they are mid-engine, RWD, and that's very different from anything I've ever driven before.  I'm very excited to get to work, restore them to some working condition and get out and drive around, hopefully before the summer is over and snow starts to fall again (I'm in Canada); otherwise they'll have to be left sitting for another season.  I chose the Fiero because it was one of the cheaper, older, sport-like cars on the market that wasn't super common, and wasn't super hard to find.  a nice middle-of-the-road project car to get me into mechanics.  Hopefully I'll learn a lot about driving from them; and I hope the entire experience is rewarding.  Time will tell.  Again, thank you for your comments; I know my story isn't super important, but I felt like sharing.  Any advice you can give a mediocre (slightly above the average) driver to help improve, I appreciate."
dashcamgifs,34tgzr,MystikIncarnate,2,Tue May 5 17:29:49 2015 UTC,"I got everything I wanted in a daily driver in this car.   Then you made the right choice.  You don't need to defend yourself although I know it can feel like you are under scrutiny. At least from me, you are not.  It is good you plan to wrench on your own Fieros. It is very helpful to your driving ability if you understand precisely the mechanical processes going on behind each of your actions when interacting with the controls of the vehicle. So there is a good start.  Empty parking lots in the snow are another good place to learn. It's good you're in Canada for that reason.  Be careful in those Mid-Engine RWD cars, particularly if they have ""loose"" suspensions, which most older cars do. A nice refresher for the suspension bushings, engine/trans mounts, tires, brakes, any bad bearings, ball joints, tie-rods, etc. is always a good place to start. Get the car into ""as good as stock"" or better shape before doing anything performance oriented to it - even driving it hard. It sounds like this is your plan already.  If you plan to install new wheels, make sure that they are the proper offset for your vehicle. Offset refers to depth of the mounting hub in the center of the wheel vs. the very center of the ""width"" of the wheel. (Not the best definition at all!) There are many FAQs out there about offset and it's effects, so google away. Even if the wheels bolt up and they seem to fit fine, they may change your scrub radius via the change in offset. So you may introduce instability just from that.  Mid-Engine RWD, just imagine that lead tipped arrow now has it's lead tip halfway down the middle of the arrow's shaft. I don't know a Fiero's true F/R weight balance, but MR cars typically strive for 50/50.  MR2 owners have said that their vehicles are picky and can be scary, as you can approach the limit of the tires so easily and feel in control, and the next moment, you are sliding. This also adds some fun-factor :) This goes along with the idea that understeer is safe. Most people recognize understeer is saying ""SLOW DOWN!"" but an MR car will typically not give you that warning. You'll enter a corner too hot, the front tracks right along as you turn the wheel, and the next thing you know, you are in a spin.  Same deal with the brakes. You should not trail brake in an MR car. This is a terrible habit you may have picked up from driving the Civic. Braking must always be done in a straight line. If you are going around a curve and feel the need to brake, straighten the wheel and let the car's weight settle longitudinally before you apply any brake. This is ""pre-emptive counter-steer"". Be ready for the ""snap"" of the weight back when you release the brakes and start to turn again, you must remember to settle the weight back into the turn.  Google the ""traction circle"". Essentially, imagine a circle on a piece of paper. When standing still, your weight is centered in the middle of the circle (if your car is 50/50 and you are corner balanced! Really you could imagine a separate circle for each wheel, and be conscious of the weight of the vehicle as it moves around, affecting each circle's shape.) Your tires can only grip so much in any one direction - Forward, Back, Right or Left. This forms the border of the circle.  If you accelerate hard enough to spin the tires with them facing straight, you just exceeded the border of the circle in front. If you brake so hard the tires lock, you exceeded the border of the circle in the rear (or you can imagine it like a joystick, with the Y axis inverted, since braking moves weight forward). If you turn so hard your tires start to slide, you exceeded the circle in whatever direction you turned.  So the idea is that if you stay within the circle, you will not lose control. The reason for this exercise is to instill in you the knowledge that your tires can only perform so much in any one direction. If you are at full braking, you cannot move left or right, because you will go outside the circle. If you are at full turning, you cannot brake or accelerate... you get the idea.  Seating position is another one I see often as an issue. Adjust your chair so that you can depress the clutch fully with your butt firmly planted as far back as it can go into the crook of the seat. You want to be able to operate the clutch with movement of your ankle and just some help from the knee. Some of this is personal preference with the pedals. You want to sit up straight such that when your arms are extended as far out as they will go, with the shoulders still back against the seat, that the wrist is directly over the top of the steering wheel. You should set the wheel as low as it will go without interfering with your legs, if it tilts. When holding the wheel at 10 and 3, you should have bent elbows.  Performance driving generally requires a good grip on the wheel. Holding it at 10 and 3, you can turn enough for most higher speed situations. It is proper to PUSH the wheel. So the right arm pushes the wheel left, and vice versa. As you need to turn the wheel more, you can allow the non-pushing hand to slide along the wheel, aligning with the pushing hand, and then together they continue the wheel rotation. So the right arm pushes the wheel left, and it comes over to meet the left hand which is allowing the wheel to pass until the hands connect, at which point both grip and continue to rotate the wheel together.  You will generally not have to ever steer harder than this while racing unless you slide and need to go full lock. Going full lock is a terrible idea but sometimes it has to be done, so just pass the wheel over and over, and let your hands rotate it all the way, never losing contact with the wheel. Often the wheel will come back to center naturally (this is a function of the caster of the wheels), but it is best to still maintain control over it's return.  Braking is another matter. Applying the brakes obviously causes the weight to shift forward, and maximum braking will not be applied until maximum weight shift will happen. Cadence braking is braking JUST at the limit of the tires before they begin to break loose/lock. Pumping the brakes can help if you are in a loose-traction situation and you cannot manage to gain traction with cadence.  Entering a turn you should be using ""neutral"" throttle. So unlike the movies, you will not want to downshift right before the corner, and ride out the corner with the engine decelerating. You will want to brake as you approach the curve, rev-match and downshift smoothly as not to disrupt traction, (this can be done while braking if you learn to heel-toe), and then hold the throttle at the proper amount to neither accel or decel, balancing the weight front and rear. Heel-toe is not terribly difficult but it is a more advanced technique, it refers to using the right toe(s) to brake while still using the right heel to apply the throttle necessary for rev-matching, operating the clutch with the left.  You should check out Turnfast.com. They changed their layout in recent years so it is not as intuitive to find all the driving lessons, but they are still a good resource. There are free articles all about driving. They will teach you all of the things I've mentioned here, and more. Such as the geometric apex of a corner vs. the racing (late) apex. The proper way to accelerate out of a turn.  Joining an automotive subreddit or two, and a forum community dedicated to your car(s) of choice is a great way to learn, and great resources to seek out when you are stuck or have a question.  There is much to learn in this hobby and I still learn things now after 13 years of it. It's rewarding and fun, expensive at times, and popular with the ladies. So best of luck to you, and if you have any more questions, let me know. I always like to help out somebody who is willing to learn."
dashcamgifs,34tgzr,teashroomed,1 point,Tue May 5 23:09:48 2015 UTC,"Braking must always be done in a straight line.   Amen.  I've actually taken to braking in a straight line whenever possible.   If you are at full braking, you cannot move left or right, because you will go outside the circle. If you are at full turning, you cannot brake or accelerate... you get the idea.   Absolutely I do.  I appreciate the ""circle"" take on it and I'll be looking into that more in detail.  Nobody has ever really explained it like that before.  I did however, have someone explain it on Pennock's Fiero forum (http://fiero.nl/) once upon a time.  Essentially they explained that, when you remove weight from tires, they have a higher tendency to slide; obviously, the surface you're on matters too, but all other things being equal, less weight = less grip.  With that in mind, when braking in a mid, rear biased or rear-engined vehicle, as opposed to a Front engined/forward biased, car, the weight, while in the back, is not being distributed to the back when braking, much of the force is forward towards the front wheels, this ""lifts"" the rear wheels from the pavement (not really, just reduced weight load), reducing the grip, and in instances where you are turning, the grip will be exceeded by the weight of the engine in the back, and the car will slide and quick move into a spin.  Break before turning, not during.  I also found these videos from Motorweek incluing a video from 1988 of the MR2 vs the Fiero GT to be quite informative on the matter; at 15:15 of this video, there's a segment that explains exactly what we're discussing.  They call it ""excessive trailing throttle oversteer"", but it's the same idea.  And that was regarding the '86 model I have.  I'm doing my best to ensure I have all the skills and knowledge I need before getting behind the wheel to know what to do and when to do it.  I've been trying to learn to heel-toe but I find it quite difficult to master; but I've been learning to decel, downshift before a turn, then apply and hold light throttle through more difficult or demanding turns, even now, in the Civic.  I'm slowly trying to train myself not to have all the bad habits.  You've given me a lot to think about and some really good resources, so I want to thank you again for taking the time to write all this out, hopefully other redditors (maybe even those darned Honda super-drivers :P ) will benefit from all the great information posted here."

dashcamgifs,34ilki,xScreamo,56,Sat May 2 11:54:04 2015 UTC,"Trains are really unpredictable. Even in the middle of a forest two rails can appear out of nowhere, and a 1.5-mile fully loaded coal drag, heading east out of the low-sulfur mines of the PRB, will be right on your ass the next moment.  I was doing laundry in my basement, and I tripped over a metal bar that wasn't there the moment before. I looked down: ""Rail? WTF?"" and then I saw concrete sleepers underneath and heard the rumbling.  Deafening railroad horn. I dumped my wife's pants, unfolded, and dove behind the water heater. It was a double-stacked Z train, headed east towards the fast single track of the BNSF Emporia Sub (Flint Hills). Majestic as hell: 75 mph, 6 units, distributed power: 4 ES44DC's pulling, and 2 Dash-9's pushing, all in run 8. Whole house smelled like diesel for a couple of hours!  Fact is, there is no way to discern which path a train will take, so you really have to be watchful. If only there were some way of knowing the routes trains travel; maybe some sort of marks on the ground, like twin iron bars running along the paths trains take. You could look for trains when you encounter the iron bars on the ground, and avoid these sorts of collisions. But such a measure would be extremely expensive. And how would one enforce a rule keeping the trains on those paths?  A big hole in homeland security is railway engineer screening and hijacking prevention. There is nothing to stop a rogue engineer, or an ISIS terrorist, from driving a train into the Pentagon, the White House or the Statue of Liberty, and our government has done fuck-all to prevent it."

dashcamgifs,32fx79,autowikibot,2,Mon Apr 13 14:00:00 2015 UTC,Isle of Man TT:       International Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) Race is a motorcycle racing event held on the Isle of Man that was for many years the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world. The event was part of the FIM Motorcycle Grand Prix World Championship during the period 1949–1976 before being transferred to the United Kingdom after safety concerns and run by the FIM as the British Grand Prix for the 1977 season. The Isle of Man TT Races became part of the TT Formula 1 Championship from 1977 to 1990 to preserve the event's racing status. From 1989 the racing has been developed by the Isle of Man Department of Tourism as the Isle of Man TT Festival. The Isle of Man TT is held during May/June of each year and traditionally concludes with the Blue Riband event the prestigious Isle of Man Senior TT race.

dashcamgifs,32fin2,David_Crockett,5,Thu Apr 16 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm not really. Without getting out a white board and a calculator it'd be hard to show, but it all comes down to the center of gravity (cog).   In a normal vehicle the COG is really low. So low in fact that stunt drivers can drive on two wheels with the car at or more than 45 degrees.   This is because the car 'wants' to fall back onto 4 wheels. The weight is over the 2 wheels on the ground and the driver, if skilled enough, has the traction to control the vehicle.  Now with what you're seeing in the video the COG is really high. So high that even 5-10 degrees of lean has the center of gravity not over the wheels, but over the ground. That means that there is more weight the vehicle off its wheel that onto them. Traction would become very slippery and even if you are able to wrestle it back the tendency will be to dramatically oversteer and lean in the opposite direction.   Think of it like balancing a sledge hammer on your hand. With the hammer side in the palm of your hand it's pretty easy. That's roll in a normal car. Flip it about and balance it with the hammer side at the top... well that's a lot harder and that's what overloading a vehicle does."

dashcamgifs,3203xd,PromQueenSlayer,3,Thu Apr 9 20:16:20 2015 UTC,So is that sub making fun of those sorts of assholes or is it a place where people are proud to be assholes?
dashcamgifs,3203xd,Kysis,4,Fri Apr 10 02:06:26 2015 UTC,Well that biker is a huge a**hole deserved what he got. I've always been under the impression that it is illegal to block the intersection like this. The biker was in the wrong for what he did but the cars in the intersection should have waited for the adequate space on the other side.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,tdaun,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:17:25 2015 UTC,I don't think it matters what the other vehicles were doing. The situation warranted caution but this retard decided to approach a cautious situation at full speed. He's clearly an impatient amateur that doesn't deserve to operate a sport bike.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,MrGuttFeeling,2,Sun Apr 26 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"You are pretty much correct.   However, cops in Columbus Ohio, where this happened, don't typically enforce that, especially at this intersection. It's a staggered intersection and not 1/4 mile or so further, there's another traffic light. It also happens to be one of the busiest streets in German Village (just south of downtown, on High Street).   The light at Greenlawn and Front, just west of there (the direction the driver was heading) is staggered - it's red east-west when the light at Greenlawn/Thurman and High is green, meaning only about 6-8 cars can easily fit into that area - and it changes before the east-west on G/T gets the green - so you also have traffic that has turned right off of High onto it.  It causes frequent traffic jams, and it's a pretty big problem and why I avoid that part of High Street whenever possible - I'm glad I live on the north side.  It's heavily trafficked because Greenlawn is the first road south of downtown you can take to get onto I-71, which a lot of people who commute from out of town take.  So a cop, realistically, would look at this and say ""the driver had control of the intersection, and while technically in the wrong, the oncoming traffic didn't have an unobstructed path through the intersection.""  Interestingly enough, the cyclist technically isn't in the wrong here though - seen here. It clearly states in (A)(1)   Vehicular traffic, ... facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to proceed straight through ... except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign ... or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:  ...  (ii) Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.   So technically, we're at a grey area - the driver lawfully entered the intersection while the light was green, but the driver technically wasn't permitted to do so because there wasn't proper clearance - so he wasn't lawfully in the intersection. It looks as though the driver was trying to move to yield right of way to the motorcyclist, and the motorcyclist predicted incorrectly - though the motorcyclist didn't have the legal obligation to yield to a vehicle not legally in the intersection.  That being said, this intersection does have an obstructed view, and I've personally sat through the east-west light 3 times waiting for a clear intersection.  Cops here understand that this particular intersection sucks and as such, ignore the law regarding entering an obstructed intersection for the driver.  These laws should probably be rewritten for better clarity.  Source: Dad was a cop most of my life, also confusing laws regarding this."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,abchiptop,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:21:19 2015 UTC,"My analysis shows that both are at fault, but while the white car was just a brainless sheep, the biker was a special breed of entitled dickbag.  To me the white car does not appear to be intentionally cutting off the bike, it was either unaware of the bike or had no idea what the bike was going to do and guessed wrong.  The white car exercised poor judgement getting into that situation in the first place, just like pretty much every other car blocking the same intersection.  The biker however, acted unpredictably and was going far too fast.  Had he proceeded slowly then any confusion on the part of the white car would not have been a problem."

dashcamgifs,3203xd,SampoLV,-1,Thu Apr 9 16:42:13 2015 UTC,"Kinda, but the white car shouldn't have been that far on the intersection, you shouldn't really go if you can't cross it completely."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,Citizen3rased,6,Thu Apr 9 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"That's generally true, however think of a similar case where there's been an accident or a car has broken down in the middle of an intersection. Either way you don't go speeding through when the light turns green."

dashcamgifs,3203xd,Hot_Wheels_guy,2,Thu Apr 9 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"That's true but as a driver of a vehicle it is up to you to determine if it is safe to enter an intersection, even if the light is green.  99.99999% of the time it is safe to proceed, but if you see traffic clogging the intersection you do not have a right to slam on the gas and accelerate to ramming speed.  White car might get a ticket for inhibiting the flow of traffic, but that would be completely unrelated to his involvement with the motorcycle."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,kramfive,6,Thu Apr 9 23:55:25 2015 UTC,"Its illegal to change lanes in the intersection. Everything else aside, bike is at fault."

dashcamgifs,3203xd,kbox,3,Thu Apr 9 17:44:24 2015 UTC,So it was the bikers fault then.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,IAmNotJoshua,-15,Thu Apr 9 17:46:11 2015 UTC,You can't justify any of this. Reddit hivemind fucks it up again.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,kbox,4,Thu Apr 9 15:49:26 2015 UTC,What's to justify? He rode like a prick and smashed his bike up. All of it was his fault.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,IAmNotJoshua,-13,Thu Apr 9 17:14:35 2015 UTC,No it wasn't. The only car that was moving in the line was the white one. As far as i can tell the white car pulled up knowing he would be in the way of the biker.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,kbox,8,Thu Apr 9 17:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yes cars move, well done. If you attempt to speed through the small gap between them on your bike you should expect to have an accident. Bikers fault entirely."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,superbadsoul,-2,Thu Apr 9 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"I""m sure this will legally be the cars fault. None of those cars should have been stopped in the intersection in the first place. However, as a motorcyclist, I can also say very easily that the guy on the bike was riding like a huuuuuge idiot. He had the right of way with the green light, but EVERY biker knows to be cautious in intersections, even ones that look safe, and that intersection was very obviously a major hazard. He then took beeline right through the most dangerous path at full speed.   The cars shouldn't have been there in the first place and are at fault, but the motorcyclist could have VERY easily avoided the accident. Stupidity all around."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,IAmNotJoshua,-15,Thu Apr 9 20:14:07 2015 UTC,It's a bike not a fucking gun you tard. ALWAYS TREAT IT LIKE ITS LOADED HURR DURR.  White car obviously pulled up in front of the bike. You should check your tiny gimp eyes since the biker already had the right of way before the cunt in the car decided to drive up.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,kbox,4,Thu Apr 9 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes that's right the car moved. You understand that they do this, right? That's why you'd be wrong to speed through a gap between them, because they move."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,IAmNotJoshua,-9,Thu Apr 9 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing the fact that cars can move from place to place, are you honestly this fucking stupid? Repeat yourself one more time and tell me you didn't get the point since you're obviously a baby crawling on top of a keyboard."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,kbox,4,Thu Apr 9 17:36:46 2015 UTC,"are you honestly this fucking stupid?   easy there. no need for that.    There is a bit of fault all around. the cars shouldn't have filled in the intersection, but the rider should have never tried to shoot the gap."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,IAmNotJoshua,3,Thu Apr 9 17:45:43 2015 UTC,So why were you surprised that the car moved?
dashcamgifs,3203xd,Quasic,-2,Thu Apr 9 17:41:03 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMzWbuRMW9U  Here is the video of the incident.    Left side driver. Window is open so why wouldn't he hear the engine rev up.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,MrTubes,-7,Thu Apr 9 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"Biker had the green light. Traffic wasn't moving, there was no reasonable expectation for the white car to suddenly close the gap, especially against a red light. It was at best negligent and at worst criminal.  Why shouldn't bikes ride through gaps where they can fit? Because a car could break the law and kill you at any moment? By that logic bikes shouldn't be allowed at all."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,Quasic,3,Thu Apr 9 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"there was no reasonable expectation for the white car to suddenly close the gap   I disagree. The car moved into the intersection when their light was green, and seeing it change, the expectation should be for them to try to clear the intersection, and that means going forward. The reasonable expectation in this situation is the cars in the intersection will be moving.   Why shouldn't bikes ride through gaps where they can fit?   I'm on board with bikes proceeding with caution when traffic is stuck like this. The biker here did not proceed with caution."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,kbox,0,Fri Apr 10 00:32:46 2015 UTC,"He was not cautious, his speed was reckless, but I think of it like this: had this been a car, and the gap was big enough for the car to get through, and the same accident had occurred, blame wouldn't be put squarely on the camera vehicle.  I wouldn't have gone that fast, but I would have tried to go through that gap had it been me."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,Quasic,3,Fri Apr 10 08:16:44 2015 UTC,Why shouldn't bikes ride through gaps where they can fit?   The reason they shouldn't can be seen in the clip.
dashcamgifs,3203xd,fyshi,0,Fri Apr 10 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"This could easily have happened with a car and a car size gap. The accident happened because the bike was going too fast and the car unexpectedly repositioned itself, not because the bike went through a gap in traffic.  If this was a car sized gap, how would you feel about a car going through?  This strange 'lane splitting is inherently dangerous' attitude puzzles me. Where I'm from, lane splitting is legal and frequent, as long as it's reasonable."
dashcamgifs,3203xd,andrewnor10,5,Fri Apr 10 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"Guys, can we come to an agreement and just say both were at fault? Obviously no-one gets 100% because both made mistakes (one speeding through blocked intersection, other one blocking it instead of waiting until it's cleared enough)."

Unless you are participating in a rally on a daily basis that's not true.   Not trying to bash on people with AWD, it is really a great assistance. I just think more and more people keep buying AWD and think it instantly makes them invincible on the road, even if they are driving around with barely legal all season tires.   Also I know Subaru does AWD right, I'm sure there are others but that's all I have experience with. Lately more and more car companies are selling ""AWD"" that doesn't really do anything.

She drove around me the wrong way and back to the main road.   I had an Indian woman in a CRV drive perpendicular across three lanes of highway traffic, over a median to the exit ramp and stop in my live lane. She probably saw the 18 wheeler approaching in the right lane beside me and panicked. Fortunately the Lexus SUV tailgating me also saw the bullshit ensuing, braked and dove behind the truck while I got to test the effectiveness of ABS in a real world situation.  One would hope not to expect that kind of thing, but sadly yes. The possibility is quite real, and you'll never really know when.

I was wearing a seat belt, she had recently begun to because of me.  For those who know LA and the Pasadena Freeway, we hit the ice on the ""big curve"" heading downtown, in the fast lane.  We went across to the ""onramp.""  Well, if you're familiar with it, you know it's not really an onramp, but a very short extra lane, maybe...what 100 or so feet long?  Anyway, we took out about 10' of the cinderblock wall...with the driver's side.  We were told we were at least a foot off the ground when that happened, then pointed straight up in the air, spinning, and landing hard on the passenger side.  The tow truck had to put ""training wheels"" on the rear, since the rear axle was broken and both rear tires were at 90 degrees to it, cushioning the car once they uprighted it.  We were told we should've been dead.  No cuts, broken bones, or blood.  We were a sig alert, though, at morning rush hour.  And my dad passed by in his van pool, not knowing it was me, but he thought my friend's car looked familiar.  Uh...we didn't go to work that day."

dashcamgifs,2z9oog,curvedwallride,24,Mon Mar 16 20:53:30 2015 UTC,If the story I know is true it would be the filming lady being an asshole driver in this case (I only saw the video and read the comments when it was posted earlier). In the video you can see her driving on the left besides the right lane beeing free. She is driving so slow that the other driver wants to overtake but can't due to her stupidity driving on the left (I think he even had to brake hard but am not sure about it). After a while he gets fed up and wants to overtake on the right only to discover her suddenly speeding up to not let him pass. Then he crashes while the woman cruelly laughs and stops on the left to film more.  I don't know whether there was more before the video started and if the man was an asshole the whole time but she was as well. Important to notice is how context can change everything.
dashcamgifs,2z9oog,fyshi,14,Mon Mar 16 22:26:56 2015 UTC,She's also recording the whole thing with her phone which makes her equally an asshole.

The dude in the pickup truck was stuck behind her for a while as she refused to let him pass.  Both drivers were dumb, but I would place more of the blame on her for inciting the road rage. It was obvious she was messing with him before the camera was turned on."

dashcamgifs,2z9oog,fyshi,3,Tue Mar 17 05:54:41 2015 UTC,"The US does have a points system. However, being the upstanding citizen that she is, instead of pulling over and checking to see if the guy was OK, she continued on her merry way and promptly uploaded the video to YouTube... Probably while she was still driving.   What's mildly amusing, though, is that after she posted it, she made a comment at how much of a safe drive she is, which is why she was driving under the speed limit. She received dozens upon dozens of comments from people ripping her a new asshole for driving the way she did, not allowing faster moving traffic to pass, and for recording a video while driving. It got she bad, she disabled comments on the original video."

dashcamgifs,2w7xu6,Chin_Spinach,14,Wed Feb 18 01:29:21 2015 UTC,true but there was not nearly enough time between the flash and coming across the sideways truck. This seems more like an unfortunate accident rather than carelessness or ignorance on the camera car's driver.

dashcamgifs,2w7xu6,fyshi,3,Wed Feb 18 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"As long as you're not around any other lights (that includes other cars headlights), it can actually be kinda beneficial on a clear and moonlit night. I've done this on some back gravel roads out in the middle of nowhere.  Your eyes adjust, and you're able to see by the moonlight much further than your headlights illuminate.  One other car on the road putting its headlights in your face, though or a single streetlight and you're fucked. Which is probably good, because if there's other traffic around, you should have your headlights on so they can see you."

Sometimes they do it just to greet each other. Or it just looks like flashing because of a pot hole or so. And the rest is a warning that there will be a speed control. Or that you have forgotten to switch the lights.  There were like two times in 10 years that someone actually flashed with the reason of an oncoming accident, but you could see it anyway."

dashcamgifs,2vnmbx,Razorray21,16,Thu Feb 12 14:55:55 2015 UTC,One of my biggest fears is an accident like this. There wasn't much the driver that rolled could do to avoid the accident.

dashcamgifs,2vnmbx,ppalms,7,Thu Feb 12 17:39:48 2015 UTC,The road conditions were not the greatest for hitting the brakes. You could lose control just as bad in weather like that. Hitting the brakes might have given them enough room to do something else with the situation though. It's hard to say unless you were actually in the situation.
dashcamgifs,2vnmbx,knobudee,4,Thu Feb 12 22:36:28 2015 UTC,He might have been able to slow down enough to lessen the severity. I would think that in the time it takes to register an impending accident and slam on the brakes he wouldn't slow down enough to completely avoid an accident.

Edit: After watching it again it looks like the reverse lights ""white rear lights"" are on until he smashes into the white car. Brake lights come on, and reverse lights appear again for a second. Judging by the fact that the front passenger tire was missing after the first crash and the driver took a brutal hit on the second crash (white car) but the SUV continues to go like hell on the accelerator, I'm going to guess this was a stuck accelerator...?

If you want to see a real world vid of an active transmission being shifted into park. There was a little police chase of a guy whose truck had no brakes in Michigan.

We're both stopped at a light. No one else around. Someone actually stopping to make a right on red (even if it's legally required) probably should have been a clue something was fishy. I see his reverse lights come on. I'm driving stick so my hand's already on the shifter and the shifter position is easy to determine without looking/it's instinctive. A split second after I saw the lights I had the car in reverse because why not.  As soon as he starts moving I just punch it in reverse. He really shoots backwards. I'm faster. I get a bit of distance between us and as I'm passing a parking lot with a nice wide entrance I turn and angle myself in. It's not a smooth entry but it gets me off of the road. I immediately stop. I'm maybe 100ft from the intersection I had originally stopped at.  I look at this guy as he goes by. We make eye contact. He just has this ""WTF?!"" look on his face.

dashcamgifs,2tam4j,PoopyButt_Childish,4,Thu Jan 22 15:23:02 2015 UTC,That looked 100% preventable. A slight wiggle turned into wild swerving and loss of control due to driver input.
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,yaix,10,Thu Jan 22 19:00:37 2015 UTC,Problem is that these people never seem to slow down.
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,knobudee,7,Thu Jan 22 19:26:21 2015 UTC,That's what I see as a major problem. They need to let off the gas and slow down. If it's not too slippery apply the breaks without slamming on them. Many times that'll help you straighten out.
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,dracy69,2,Thu Jan 22 19:28:52 2015 UTC,What? Using any sort of brakes will make a situation like this worse. The last thing you want is to send the weight of the car to the front wheels and give the back of the car even less traction.   You keep the throttle where it is and correct with the wheel or you roll out of the throttle and correct with the wheel. Most people over correct because of late reaction time and because correcting a car in this situation requires very very little wheel movement.   Slowing down before the uneven pavement would have been best obviously.
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,frosty95,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:11:28 2015 UTC,Depending on driver skill oversteer can be better or worse. I personally prefer to hit the brakes and deal with the oversteer. But I also actually know how to correct for oversteer properly unlike 90% of drivers.
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,captain_craptain,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"No. Just take your foot of the gas and let your engine brake for you, steer as needed, small corrections."
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,frosty95,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:07:58 2015 UTC,Automagic transmission unfortunately. If there is going to be any braking it is done with my foot caressing the pedal on the left.
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,captain_craptain,-1,Sat Jan 24 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"Not true. I also have an automatic, when you are going that fast and take your foot of the gas the engine will slow you down gently.  Just because you drive an automatic doesn't mean that engine breaking ceases to exist. Similar to when you are driving down a steep grade. Don't burn up your brakes, turn off your overdrive and coast with the engine breaking."
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,frosty95,3,Sat Jan 24 02:31:37 2015 UTC,I'm well aware that you can engine brake with an automatic (duh). But what you failed to realize is that In most automatic cars you might as well be in neutral when you let off the gas unless you force it down a gear or two manually.
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,captain_craptain,-1,Sat Jan 24 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"No. The engine breaking will happen, a little is all you need here anyways you don't want a lot. This is why I'm telling you to stay if the brakes, it does not and should not be drastic braking.    Most automatic cars have an overdrive button you can tap to drop down a gear, it essentially turns off your highest gear until you toggle the button again.  Our you can shift down one like you said but just taking your foot off of the gas is usually plenty to retain control."
dashcamgifs,2tam4j,laughapnea,3,Sat Jan 24 15:18:27 2015 UTC,it was definitely preventable. if he was in his lane he never would have had to swerve back into his correct lane and his wheels would have never hid that lip and started the whole downward spiral.

It is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity. The principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles of classical physics that are used to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by applied forces. Inertia comes from the Latin word, iners, meaning idle, sluggish. Inertia is one of the primary manifestations of mass, which is a quantitative property of physical systems. Isaac Newton defined inertia as his first law in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which states:     Image i     Interesting: Moment of inertia | Inertia (independent record company) | List of moments of inertia | Sylvester's law of inertia   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

dashcamgifs,2ofc78,Razorray21,53,Sat Dec 6 02:36:50 2014 UTC,That car is most definitely not stopped OP. You done goofed.
dashcamgifs,2ofc78,awaytome,13,Sat Dec 6 02:59:06 2014 UTC,"Motorcycles can decelerate much faster than cars because of their lower mass and that motorcycle very likely would have braked in time if that car wouldn't have cut him off.  That being said it takes a complete idiot to assume that traffic is going to act the way it's supposed to, and and even bigger idiot to risk his life (and others) by not giving enough distance to brake with room to spare."
dashcamgifs,2ofc78,tehblackknight,7,Sat Dec 6 14:52:47 2014 UTC,"Not true. Cars, motorcycles (and any other type of vehicle) generally have a maximum deceleration of a little over 1g. The limiting factor is the tires starting to lock up."
dashcamgifs,2ofc78,uhtt,2,Sat Dec 6 18:05:50 2014 UTC,"Having ridden a sportsbike similar to the one in the gif I've found that the bike slows down at a MUCH faster rate after letting off the accelerator.  Maybe the braking is comparable between cars and bikes, but bikes can safely decelerate MUCH faster than cars while maintaining control in my experience.  This is another reason you have to be very careful while driving a motorcycle along with poor visibility."
dashcamgifs,2ofc78,tehblackknight,7,Sat Dec 6 18:34:31 2014 UTC,"It can be said that your ""common"" bike will stop slightly faster than your ""common"" car in testing, due to two factors - the testing scenario removes many of the difficult factors for the rider, and the bike being better designed for performance than a family sedan is. When you have comparative quality of cars, or consider the practical differences in real life application, the car can easily be the better.  The motorcycle has less weight. An equal car has more, and wider tyres on the ground, with guaranteed weight above them to ensure solid contact, meaning more effective braking. A car has less worry about locking up, with ABS far more standard and successful braking requiring less skill (two brakes to control on a bike, and must be done well to avoid lockup and ensure proper contact with the road). A bike has a slightly faster reaction time (less movement to brake). You're not engine-braking for any noticeable distance to avoid a crash like that, so that you're talking about isn't really relevant. The biker is punished more for minor mistakes. For example, the rider in the gif has to, in a split second, decide between aiming straight and braking hard to stop short of the rear, or weave to the left and avoid the car instead, adding to his reaction time. For non-riders, turning a bike while using the front brakes is a difficult skill called ""trail braking."" Braking too heavily while turning the bike transfers the force across rather than down, which pulls the bike onto its side. So, if you mess up the decision between avoiding and stopping in time and go for something between the two, slightly turning with heavy braking, you're guaranteed to crash.   tl;dr There are a million factors at play, and neither the car or bike is guaranteed to perform better."

dashcamgifs,2ofc78,uber33t,20,Sat Dec 6 13:29:09 2014 UTC,"As a motorcyclist, it looks to me like they were being stupid and going to fast for the situation. They would have probably been fine had that Honda not bolted like that, but then if they can't avoid that scenario, they are going to fast.  As a motorcyclist, I have learned to treat every car as if it's trying to kill me, not because it's intentional, but because car drivers just don't look for us, or consider us when maneuvering in traffic, as they have no experience riding a bike. Looks like this guy forgot about that..."

When my parents would take him for walks, the dog would run ahead of them.  My dad had him trained to stop at the end of the sidewalk and sit.  Once my parents got close enough, my dad would tell the dog to go ahead.  He would look both ways and wait for any traffic to clear, then proceed safely across the intersection and down the next block, where he would sit and wait for my parents to catch up to him.  These were back streets without much traffic, but if they did approach a larger intersection, my dad would have the dog heel next to him until they safely got across the street.  I don't remember much of this, as I was very young, but apparently he could have a squirrel running in circles around him and the dog would not chase it or anything.  He would also protect me and my brother when we were infants by standing guard and growling at anybody who came near the blanket we were laying on while my parents were having a picnic in the park.

dashcamgifs,2nyx3b,pizzaazzip,3,Mon Dec 1 22:31:47 2014 UTC,Is there a difference and what is it?
dashcamgifs,2nyx3b,LazyHazy,8,Sat Dec 13 07:35:13 2014 UTC,"My understanding of the difference is AWD is a computer controlled system that will detect when to send power to wheels and it is typically a higher gear.  4WD is enabled when requested by the driver or if the car detects bad traction (depending on the model & year) and is typically a lower gear used for more heavy duty.    For example if you compare 2WD pickup to a 4WD pickup (the only difference being the 4WD parts etc), the 2WD pickup will typically get better gas mileage than the 4WD one because a 4WD vehicle has more moving parts.    An AWD will typically get better gas mileage than a 2WD equivalent because the system that runs it.  You can read more here.  This article says it does reduce fuel economy to have an AWD car but from what I can tell, it depends on the make and model."

There's no ""do this exactly to make sure you always live"".  Infact I'd almost say it's better to swerve away no matter what. The risk of hitting an on-coming car goes up significantly. He could have hit the car in front of the truck if he had swerved to the left.  You're suggesting that people should ""always turn where the car comes from"". That makes you retarded.  In reality he  was going to hit that truck no matter what he did. Either the cabin or the flatbed it makes no difference."
dashcamgifs,2mny2h,Amsteah52,-8,Tue Nov 18 21:15:13 2014 UTC,"So ""always"" was a poor word choice. Most people still would turn right in his situation, I mean a lot of gifs on this sub show the exact same thing. With a semi, its one thing, they will take up the whole road when turned sideways. But with other cars, I'd rather hit the tail end and attempt to correct myself than hit the car head on, when we are both traveling at speed. But hey, do your way, I'll do mine. Simple as that."
dashcamgifs,2mny2h,Rispetto,4,Tue Nov 18 21:41:39 2014 UTC,"First of all this happens in a split second. Even if you don't freeze from the shock (even being frozen .5 seconds is too long) you will not have time to make a concious decision. It's a knee-jerk reaction.  Additionally, even if you were able to make a concious decision, if you were to go left you would be assuming that the driver of the oncoming car would not correct himself. There's no way of forseeing whether he will or not. It comes down to luck.. essentially.  In a different situation the rules may change. But for this specific gif it wouldn't have mattered what you thought was the right thing to do. He was dead either way. At least going right he avoided the car in front of the truck, thus potentially saving that person's life."

dashcamgifs,2lm5gi,ne_eng,6,Fri Nov 7 21:15:26 2014 UTC,The car should have yielded because of the give way lines
dashcamgifs,2lm5gi,cofcof2,7,Sat Nov 8 06:30:50 2014 UTC,"that was an easy situation to predict and not put yourself in harm's way     How? By slowing down every time there's potential for a car to not yield to you when you have right of way? I usually like to have at least made eye-contact with the driver when in that kind of situation, but the most no eye-contact would lead to is me having a hand ready on the brake lever."
dashcamgifs,2lm5gi,Shit_Lordstrom,-1,Sat Nov 8 07:29:19 2014 UTC,"How? By slowing down every time there's potential for a car to not yield to you when you have right of way?   Exactly.  I've taken many motorcycle training courses and commute on a motorcycle.  You need to ride as though everyone else is trying to hit you.  Coming up to a merging lane like that would set off all my danger alarms and I would be watching that car like a hawk, with my hand over the brake and leaving myself enough room or time to stop or avoid entering his path, avoiding the exact situation he got himself into in the video.  You have to assume that the driver can't see you through a door pillar or is just being negligent until proven otherwise.  There's no such thing as being overly cautious on a bike"
dashcamgifs,2lm5gi,ne_eng,2,Mon Nov 10 06:04:19 2014 UTC,"You're telling me that you slow down every time there's a chance that someone won't yield for you? How does the rest of the traffic respond to you being so unpredictable? I bet you hear tires screeching behind you a fair bit from the poor drivers behind you that didn't expect you to fucking slow down when you clearly had right of way. Or maybe you wouldn't really notice as it'd be a full time job slowing down and speeding back up for every driveway, sidestreet and intersection that you ride by.    As a motorcycle rider I'm surprised you don't understand that the safest way to ride is to be predictable."
dashcamgifs,2lm5gi,Shit_Lordstrom,0,Mon Nov 10 06:50:27 2014 UTC,"So you're assuming that I'm slamming on the brakes every time?  I also watch my mirrors to ensure I don't cause someone to screech their tires and rear end me.  I don't completely slow down, but in the situation of the video I would have let off the gas and been prepared to take evasive action, unlike the cyclist who had tunnel vision and kept riding and full speed.  Not gonna argue this any more, take up my driving habits with the international championship winning motorcycle racer who taught me."

dashcamgifs,2lhaa0,xentralesque,15,Thu Nov 6 21:21:37 2014 UTC,"The bicyclist was in the bicycle lane. It's also clear that the only reason he or she swerved to the left out of the lane just before impact was to attempt to avoid being hit.  Also, in most states, it is perfectly legal for bicycles to ride anywhere in the lane, and it is usually far safer to ride in the middle of the lane as parked cars swinging doors open will catch you unexpectedly.  Bike lane: http://i.imgur.com/XNhMTFz.png"
dashcamgifs,2lhaa0,damageddude,3,Thu Nov 6 17:56:12 2014 UTC,Those looked like the lanes we have in NYC. Police have been ticketing bike riders who ride outside the bike lanes when the lanes are available.

dashcamgifs,2k3j03,rag3train,5,Thu Oct 23 22:14:07 2014 UTC,Im guessing that is what this is. Crash testing before modern testing facilities.

dashcamgifs,2k3j03,Creaphis,14,Thu Oct 23 18:32:25 2014 UTC,They had no idea what they started.  This is great. Do you have any background information on it? Early auto manufacturer crash test?

I get over into the slow lane and do a nice 35-40 (still hella fast for ice, but i was kinda enjoying my little ride) And what do you know here come 3 jackasses all up each others asses doing 55-60, first two are front wheel drive, and are pretty tame (think a prius and a kia) third in line is in a mustang. First two go by, which was irritating enough, third guy gets right next to me, and what the fuck do you know, he guns it trying to pass. next thing i know his ass is sideways going across 2 lanes on oncoming right into a ditch.  Lesson of the story, If its a solid sheet of ice, how about you slow the fuck down and don't try to pass people. that fuck could have slid the other way right into me."

The implication I took from that was the gravity of the consequences determines the level of responsibility.  Even the safest rider in the world is milliseconds from death if he encounters a sufficiently bad driver.  I wouldn't go past a slowing driver at full speed, but equally, I'm not going to sit waiting behind him until he makes his intentions fully clear. Does that open me up to potential accidents? Yes, if the driver is sufficiently bad. But bikers all make that compromise by riding on the road with other people.  This one was more reckless than I would have been, but the driver changed direction without making his intention clear, and was unaware of a passing motorist. Even though he bears fewer consequences, he still bears responsibility."

People should really look back if they're in a passable lane. Most people passing are going way over the speed limit to do so safely. They're more dangerous than oncoming traffic and on drivers side. It could really a look or die situation."
dashcamgifs,2h4ohd,Suomis_,8,Tue Sep 23 00:58:40 2014 UTC,"Or you could just slow down and wait for the other driver to make a move. If someone has a reason to stop in the middle of the road, and you rear end them, you're at fault.

dashcamgifs,2h4ohd,Quasic,-1,Mon Nov 3 15:07:56 2014 UTC,"My first reaction when motorbikes crash is that it's their own fault and it almost always is. Even when a driver has made a mistake, the motorbike is deliberately driving dangerously and remove all chance of avoiding the accident."
dashcamgifs,2h4ohd,Noelstaar,3,Mon Sep 22 19:02:48 2014 UTC,Yes there are stupid bikers. But there are also many stupid drivers. Last but not least there are millions of stupid pedestrians. Bikers in no way have a monopoly on stupid.
dashcamgifs,2h4ohd,Deexeh,3,Tue Sep 23 06:41:57 2014 UTC,"Yes, because it could have nothing to do with cunts texting and driving, not paying attention to things around them, not seeing them and making a turn across their path, or any multitude of other reasons, it's always the bike's fault. How stupid and biased can you be? Don't group every single rider in with the idiots you see acting like dicks."
dashcamgifs,2h4ohd,HungShark,1 point,Tue Sep 23 02:56:33 2014 UTC,"Textbook confirmation bias.  Even the safest bikers are at great risk when riding on the public road, as they are at the mercy of the cars."
dashcamgifs,2h4ohd,THAT0NEASSHOLE,2,Fri Oct 24 22:33:37 2014 UTC,I always have paranoia that someone is going to smash into the back of me when I am stopped on an open road like this. There should have been some indication that the bike wasn't going to stop and that he was veering to the left. The person driving the car might have had his signal on but even that wouldn't protect him from an aggressive meathead situation like this.
dashcamgifs,2gv1x5,Razorray21,16,Fri Sep 19 14:15:25 2014 UTC,"This makes me want a dash cam, to prove fault on the other driver for things like this."

dashcamgifs,2gv1x5,Battletooth,7,Fri Sep 19 19:07:16 2014 UTC,"It's glitchy and the casing is crappily made. If I accidentally leave it plugged in it while at work it will say it's data is full even though it is supposed to overwrite the oldest file at all times. I'd suggest going tier above the absolute cheapest dash cam and hope it's more reliable.   Edit: the SD card flap is broke, and the screen drops when it should hold itself up tightly. I've also replaced some of the other plastic mounting pieces with metal nuts and bolts and glue.   Basically it looks jankety."
dashcamgifs,2gv1x5,Utendoof,5,Fri Sep 19 19:15:27 2014 UTC,"this situation is clear cut but I agree with your sentiment.  I mount my Gopro to the windshield of my car, not the best dash cam but it's the best use for it when I am not doing something cool."

dashcamgifs,2gv1x5,Battletooth,5,Sat Sep 20 05:37:49 2014 UTC,I'm surprised they don't only allow right turns here. There is no light or anything.
dashcamgifs,2gv1x5,PopeSleepy,24,Fri Sep 19 14:22:22 2014 UTC,"Where I live, there are PLENTY of places to make left turns like that. I guess they assumed most people wouldn't start turning when a big bus blocks your sight from the road.  If there is no or light traffic going the way the dashcam car was, it should be safe to make that left turn if you have common sense."
dashcamgifs,2gv1x5,Frostiken,2,Fri Sep 19 14:40:59 2014 UTC,"Some intersections just aren't busy enough for a light, and I'd say the problem here was that he couldn't see behind the bus."

Just the pain in the ass of dealing with any accident makes it not worthwhile, let alone the possibility that you won't establish that you had the green light (witnesses can be fickle or nonexistent).  Then if you or someone else is significantly injured this can cause lifelong misery.  I share your frustration with people who run red lights, cut in front of others, etc, etc, but please believe me when I say that trying to teach them a lesson just isn't worth it."
dashcamgifs,2cc2z0,tgeliot,10,Fri Aug 1 17:26:42 2014 UTC,That's not his point. He is saying it's better to hit them rather than swerve and crash on your own.   If they drive away you are fucked over. Might as well hit them.
dashcamgifs,2cc2z0,dracy69,3,Fri Aug 1 20:08:24 2014 UTC,"Hmmm, I took him as saying ""don't even bother to brake"". But I can see that the way hoods_breath worded it, it's ambiguous.  I advocate braking but not swerving.  I think we agree."
dashcamgifs,2cc2z0,tgeliot,-4,Fri Aug 1 21:03:32 2014 UTC,"I disagree. If you hit them you risk injuring them. Even a small impact can do pretty bad damage, especially if there are kids or old people in the car. It doesn't matter that it's their fault, it doesn't matter if they are assholes and drive away afterwards, if you can dodge them then you dodge them."
dashcamgifs,2cc2z0,this_raccoon,4,Fri Aug 1 22:13:11 2014 UTC,"If I can dodge them with a clear and safe path then I will. This isn't about punishing the other driver it's more about not wanting to die or get seriously injured because of someone else's mistake. If I hit a car then there is a great chance I'll be fine, if I slide off the road then there is a great chance I will get killed, hitting a tree or telephone pole or the like is brutal. IMO you have a better chance of getting hurt by sliding off the road than they do by getting hit.   So basically in the OP it is better to just hit the brakes,  not risk sliding off the road and risk killing yourself. For safety AND insurance purposes."

I was taught to try and stop and never swerve cause you have no clue what you will hit. You are so focused on what is right in front of you that you could miss people walking on the sidewalk or another car next to you.

However, you can see another car already in that lane at a dead stop presumably to let this car merge in.  The motorcycle went to the right of the stopped car and hit the merging car.  Not sure where this is, in most US states this is still the merging car's fault.  Lane splitting is legal as long as the motorcycle is the only moving car at that point in the lane which is the case here.  That said, this is a perfect example of why I don't lane split.  Cars are to unpredictable and life just isn't worth being in that much of a hurry.  Shorts, t-shirt, no helmet, lane splitting at a high enough rate that when he got hit, he flew 20.

Guy smiley cuts me off no blinkers and slams on his brakes mid lane because his fat ass truck couldn't fit in the ""safety space"" the car had in the merged lane. I was by no means driving like an Ass and obviously was not at fault. Your Wikipedia source is contradictory stating, ""Lane sharing with vehicles other than motorcycles is not legal anywhere, including California."" Dmv just issued a press release stating, “The DMV will not be including lane splitting language in the next revisions of handbooks in the next revision of 2015,” said DMV information officer Jaime Garza. Last year California Senate denied a bill proposing to ban lane splitting. It was obviously denied. Just Google bill SB350 and don't use Wikipedia.

dashcamgifs,2arau7,toastar8,3,Thu Jul 17 23:54:00 2014 UTC,Ah but wouldn't listening to loud music (which I do as well) be a factor in your ability to be cognizant of your surroundings therefore putting more blame on the driver that was hit?

If your cars on fire; place both feet on the rest of the door jam (where the driver door usually sits when closed), then LAUNCH yourself away from the vehicle, making sure that no parts touch both the car and the ground at the same time.

I'm a teenager and live in the US so I think having a dashcam in an accident would help a teenager with insurance but I feel its a waste assuming an accident won't ever happen (that sounded and felt stupid to say). No one I know has a dashcam at all. I don't wanna be the only person to have one. I feel like my parents would be like why the fuck did you get a dashcam. Convince me...     It would be kinda cool to watch videos if someone ever did something retarded and no one believed you or wish they would have saw it

I've been driving for a decade and only accident I've been in was a bitch moved into my lane and side swipped me.

dashcamgifs,27p732,Rispetto,5,Mon Jun 9 23:24:39 2014 UTC,"If this was done in Canada, guy turning left would be put at-fault.  1) No way of proving how fast the oncoming car was going  2) His speed probably would not have made a big difference in whether or not the cars collided  3) Oncoming car had the right-of-way"
dashcamgifs,27p732,PillsburyDougBoy,2,Tue Jun 10 02:57:46 2014 UTC,It's also possible that he had a green arrow and the other guy blew through a red light.

dashcamgifs,27p732,Rispetto,1 point,Tue Jun 10 08:31:31 2014 UTC,"So you're doing 60 in a 50 zone, tired and just want to go home (cops here generally dont bug you unless you're doing 25+ over the limit, I.E 120 on the 100 limit highway is fine), when suddenly someone pulls out in front of you. Now you're liable for insurance, too?  Not to say this guy was 'mildly' speeding, he very well may have been going insanely fast, but for all you know the limit on that road is 80 kp/h. How does that seem fair?"
dashcamgifs,27p732,Bugisman3,1 point,Tue Jun 10 09:46:22 2014 UTC,"Normally in built up areas like this, the limit would be 50 or 60. 40 if there's a school nearby, or a high incidence of pedestrians crossing where there are lot of shops.  It's not unheard of where the coppers give a ticket for going 5 kph over the speed limit, or for eating at the wheel. Yes, it's a nanny state.  For insurance purposes though, the guy turning left is definitely at fault."
dashcamgifs,27p732,Monsieur_Mangetout,1 point,Tue Jun 10 17:50:31 2014 UTC,"speeding is speeding, I hate the argument that he was only just going over the limit. The law is there for a reason, just because it's driving related doesn't make a difference."
dashcamgifs,27p732,Rispetto,4,Tue Jun 10 20:37:37 2014 UTC,"10 km/h over the speed limit may be 'illegal', but a judge would laugh and throw it out of court if it was ever presented as a case."
dashcamgifs,27p732,BaumingLife,1 point,Tue Jun 10 20:45:02 2014 UTC,The guy turning left clearly has an advanced green because the dash cam guy has an advanced green to turn right which would only happen in the case that the through traffic is at a red.

Of course the vehicle in the middle would get blamed if this video wasn't here, because technically he was tailgating, but when they do frauds like this they typically go way slower than the speed limit to piss you off and start tailgating. Then the front driver says they slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting a deer or something.  Stuff like this is why I hate insurance companies. Its your fault, and they walk away with the money.

dashcamgifs,21lngx,MattyB4x4,5,Fri Mar 28 16:33:15 2014 UTC,"You're making assumptions as to what caused the sway...  Typically the sway can be caused by too little tongue weight, bad tires, windy conditions, poor weight distribution on trailer....and a few other things.  Easiest way to stop this is to avoid it all together and make sure the above listed things are all in check.  Additionally, you don't want to brake, nor accelerate as these two actions can make the sway worse.  Sometimes acceleration might work, but your safest bet is to reduce your speed.    What you want to do is let off the accelerator and let the vehicle gradually slow down, while counter-steering....then, if you have them, gently apply the brake override on the brake controller and use the trailer brakes to decelerate.  Source: Hauled trailers back and forth from Atlanta, GA to Texas neary every other weekend for 4 years while in school and had sketchy loads I had to deal with from time to time...."

The guy probably tried slowing down and the trailer doesn't have brakes.      Additionally, you don't want to brake   Depends on the situation. Based off my assumption you would want to accelerate or at least stop decelerating but a little gas would have probably straightened it out IF it was caused by braking.  But, as you said.

For starters that car should not be towing that much weight. So the proper way to do this would be having a proper tow vehicle and using a trailer with brakes/vehicle that supports trailer brakes.

dashcamgifs,1u3htf,theMoosebreeder,6,Tue Dec 31 16:26:16 2013 UTC,The exact reason I look both ways even on one way streets.
dashcamgifs,1u3htf,DoctorBaconite,6,Wed Jan 15 05:24:08 2014 UTC,The car was going the wrong way in the one-way street...I think she looked to her right first where logically a car is more likely to come from.
dashcamgifs,1u3htf,PoeticMonk,2,Wed Jan 1 07:21:42 2014 UTC,If it's 99.99 percent that a car is coming from one direction I'll still turn my head both ways for the value of it.  I'm amazed too at how many people don't look both ways at traffic crossings when the sign says it's OK to cross. Just takes one mistake by a driver going through a red.
dashcamgifs,1u0ne2,Razorray21,6,Mon Dec 30 15:12:57 2013 UTC,"I see a ""pedestrian crossing"" sign right there which would indicate that the speed limit on this road should be low. If the driver was going too fast, it would be partially his fault as well. Then again, I could be wrong..."

dashcamgifs,1u0ne2,Rispetto,12,Sat Apr 26 03:07:40 2014 UTC,"i used to cross the street like an asshole (like this woman) and would base my decision to go/not go on whether or not i could physically make it across the street before the car got to me. my friend then put into perspective that even if i can make it in time, the driver may react to my darting out in way that could cause an accident, so since then i go to the crosswalk... i'm lucky someone smacked some sense into me before I could cause something like this to happen!"

dashcamgifs,1nz23h,rabidpiano86,2,Tue Oct 8 16:38:36 2013 UTC,"Hell if you make any kind of hard wheel adjustments going at highway speeds without letting off both the brake and the gas, you're gonna have a shitty time.  I'm lucky I managed the same sort of scenario without going off the road.  I think most of the luck was that no one was in the lane beside me."
dashcamgifs,1nz23h,Endyo,-1,Tue Oct 8 17:14:51 2013 UTC,"Yea, I say the driver is to blame, the car started to slide because the left wheels had no traction while the right side was still on the pavement.

dashcamgifs,1nz23h,hkscfreak,6,Tue Oct 8 18:34:11 2013 UTC,"Yeah, if anyone is to blame, it's definitely not the person who left the shit in the back their truck unsecured."

dashcamgifs,1nz23h,hkscfreak,3,Tue Oct 8 21:07:35 2013 UTC,Holy shit. It takes so long from when the car hits the slab and start sliding to when it finally stops moving. I'll bet the driver had enough time for their life to pass before their eyes so many times they got bored.

dashcamgifs,1ns535,shittyartist,32,Sat Oct 5 12:04:44 2013 UTC,"She was in a crosswalk, and traffic was stopping for her, so it's safe to assume that she waited before crossing and ensured other vehicles saw her before proceeding.  If you look on the side of the road, there's a blue 'yield to pedestrians' sign. We can assume that the same sign is hanging from the wires above the crosswalk. That driver failed to follow road traffic signs, hit the pedestrian while they were still in a crosswalk, and will definitely be found at fault.  It also doesn't help the driver that he has a headlight out.  While her injuries don't appear terrible, getting hit by a car like that will definitely give you tetanus."
dashcamgifs,1ns535,ARecipeForCake,3,Sat Oct 5 18:24:28 2013 UTC,In the US it is usually defaultly written in the local laws that you have to yield at any designated crosswalk.
