What would have happened then?

On September 13, the war would have been over and won, without a single American life lost.   Holy shit that escalated quickly.

WWI was four years (including 1.5-2 of American involvement), while WWI was six years (including 3.5-4 of American involvement).  -The Middle East is not simply another way to say ""the Muslim world."" There are Muslim-majority countries outside of it (Indonesia, Bangladesh, and India have three of the five largest Muslim communities in the world) and a lot of non-Muslims inside of it (Israel, arguably Armenia, and hundreds of thousands of Christian, Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist expats and laborers in the Gulf states).  -Radical Islam is not simply a form of ""hate."" There are a lot of complex reasons for its emergence, most of which are not inherent flaws of Islam. These include the humiliating colonization of the Middle East and South Asia by France and Britain and questionable Cold War politics. Quite a bit of radical Islam is blowback from flawed or ill-conceived Western intervention.   -""our enemies have a full range of human emotions while we donât."" Wut? I'm not even going to criticize this statement because it's so bizarre.  -The Geneva Conventions would almost certainly apply if the US bombed entire countries, including national capitals. Plus, the prohibition on unnecessary killing of women and children predates the Conventions; part of the appeal of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was that nuclear bombing would end the war in Japan quickly, saving American and Japanese lives.  -Irradiating an area from Morocco to Pakistan would take a lot more than 35 bombs. Also, nukes aren't perfectly effective, so it would take a lot to wipe out all potential threats in the Middle East. Plus, what are we going to do with the Muslim minorities in the West? Reopen Auschwitz?  -There were thousands of Americans in the Middle East in 2001. It would take a miracle to wipe out all these countries (including Saudi) without ""a single American life lost"" unless you think some Angel of Death would spare the non-Muslims while killing 100% of Muslims.  -What does this even have to do with psychology, anyway? Note the abundance of sources (translation: zip) that Mr. Kanazawa cites.  -The emotional appeal of a President Coulter does nothing about her presumed lack of experience in anything other than advocating crimes against humanity.  -All this crazy 'Murica makes no sense when you consider it was written by a Japanese expat in the UK who somehow has been employed since 2003 (and still is!) by the London School of Economics. The ""Japs"" he slams include his entire family as well as himself! This whole article reads like a skit of Chappelle's Show."

Each of the defeated powers was required to make payments in either cash or kind. Because of the financial situation Austria, Hungary, and Turkey found themselves in after the war, few to no reparations were paid and the requirements for reparations were cancelled. Bulgaria, having paid only a fraction of what was required, saw her reparation figure reduced and then cancelled. Historians have recognized the German requirement to pay reparations as the ""chief battleground of the post-war era"" and ""the focus of the power struggle between France and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised"".

He also can't decide if having children, and having children they know are their own, is the top male priority...   ""How do I know that this kid is mine?"", ""How do I know I should be investing my energy and resources into it?"", ""How do I secure monopoly breeding rights[?""]   â¦or if procreation is to be avoided at all costs:   Suppose heterosexuality is left completely unrestrained, you just start engaging in a ton of risky behaviors. You get someone pregnant; oh shit. Suddenly the mechanism comes crashing down on your head: it's your responsibility, and now the community sort of seals the two of you together. Your opportunities for more of those types of activities are diminished because now you've got more eyes on you, you've got a kid to raise, you've probably got to go get a job if you didn't already have one, and you've got to quit school if you were in it. You've basically screwed up your entire life, and you know it, and your family knows it, and the same goes for your partner. An end has been put to your fun. You're stuck.   You'd think someone so interested in evolutionary biology (cough) would have at least read The Selfish Gene, Dawkins before he went full Dawkins.  Then it gets even more confused, where he conflates his personal goal to not make babies with evolutionary imperatives (I know I know), but that doesn't really matter because it's all just a windbag windup for the pitch: ""Here's why my and all homophobia is justified.""

BadEverything,380bfh,_watching,57,Mon Jun 1 00:32:55 2015 UTC,"1) If Islam is really a religion of peace, as opposed to a particularly violent religion, then why do so many people and organizations across the world refuse to show Muhammad cartoons out of fear that they'll be murdered by devout Muslims for doing it?   Because of small minorities within Islam and irrational fear.   2) If illegal immigrants are supposed to help our economy, then why werenât they helping the economies of the poor nations they fled?   Because how it helps is through expanding the economy by adding people to it. Plus, they were helping by participating in said economy.   3) Given that Hillary Clintonâs nearly accomplishment-free political career has been based on riding the coattails of a serial adulterer who has humiliated and cheated on her over and over, isnât Hillary Clinton a terrible role model for young women?   ...Wait, since when is her political career ""accomplishment-free""?   4) If Barack Obama can directly contradict the laws on the books by refusing to deport millions of illegal aliens because of âprosecutorial discretion,â couldnât a Republican President use the same precedent and refuse to prosecute people who donât pay a capital gains tax or who violate EPA rules?   Yes, and?   5) Wouldnât it be just as stupid to send teenage Boy Scouts into the woods alone with gay men as it would to send teenage Girl Scouts into the woods alone with heterosexual men?   And if I don't object to either?   6) If Nazis (National Socialist German Workers' Party) were supposed to be Right Wing, then why did they proclaim themselves to be enemies of capitalism, implement socialist policies and call themselves socialists?   Because it was in vogue to do so, and fascists are nothing if not shameless opportunists.   7) Why should we take the threat of climate change seriously enough to cut back our lifestyles when even Al Gore, the foremost promoter of global warming hysteria, lives in a mansion, flies on private jets and rides around in SUVs?   ...Because we have a shitton of evidence for climate change and you're an idiot.   8) Whatâs the difference between say, the KKK and the NAACP, LA Raza, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the New Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam other than the color of their skin, the skin color of the people they hate and their level of societal acceptance?   Systemic power relations.   9) If weâre not willing to ask middle class Americans to at least pay in taxes what services provided to them from the government cost, then isnât it time to start paring back the services the government offers until we get to a level of government that everyone but the poor is willing and able to pay for?   ...What?   10) If transsexuals are just mentally ill and need treatment, not trapped in the wrong body, then isnât encouraging them to mutilate themselves via surgery instead of getting psychological treatment extremely harmful to them?   First, they aren't ""just mentally ill"" and, second, the only successful treatment of gender dysphoria, which accompanies being transgender, is sexual reassignment surgery, as any psychologist who isn't a hack will tell you.   11) If ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) has nothing to do with Islam, then why does it have ""Islamic"" in its name?   Because no one is claiming they have nothing to do with Islam. People claim that a) they don't represent Islam, b) they are, theologically, different enough from the Quran that they aren't muslim like they think they are, and/or c) the underlying cause of Daesh isn't their muslim beliefs, with said religious beliefs serving more as an excuse than anything.   12) Since women are now 33% more likely to earn college degrees than men, is it time to radically shift our education system in the name of equality so as to better educate men?   Actually, I think we should. For too long has patriarchal thought been infused in how we raise and educate men, which is incredibly harmful to men, so we should engage in restructuring in order to counter toxic masculinity in our culture and schools. Probably not what they meant, though.   13) If cites like Detroit and Baltimore have been run by liberals for decades, then arenât Democrats fully responsible for the problems those cities have?   I could agree with this, but the solution is hardly a conservative/neoliberal turn. Indeed, it's not like conservative run places are any better. Perhaps we should solve the problem of liberalism by actually abolishing capitalism rather than engaging in progressive half-measures or reactionary policies.   14) Isnât it racist to argue that black Americans are so uniquely stupid and incompetent that they canât even manage to get a government ID to vote?   Which is why no one argues this. What people do argue is that economic conditions make it unfeasible for people who are poor enough to get a government ID, such as the requirements for paying money to get said ID, time constraints, and the lack of transportation options.   15) If a man works more hours than a woman, takes off less time to be with his children and does more unpleasant, difficult jobs, shouldnât he make more money than she does?   Are these not all the result of a patriarchal system that preferences men for certain jobs because of the perception that men are inherently superior at said jobs, that assumes women are child rearers, that convinces women that they cannot pursue certain careers, that values the jobs it associates with men more, thus paying them more, and that gives no compensation to women for the at-home labor they are expected to engage in, and, as such, should we not change the system in question through social revolution?   16) Isnât a media personality -- with a platform that gets him out to large numbers of people -- who falsely accuses someone of racism doing much more damage to society and promoting more hatred than some hick or frat boy who hates black people because of the color of their skin?   Who, in particular, are you talking about?   17) If Barack Obama can make large changes to Obamacare without the approval of Congress, then couldnât a Republican President use the same precedent to gut Obamacare regardless of what Congress has to say about it?   Sure. Obamacare is sucks, anyway, what with how it serves to enrich the capitalists in the healthcare industry and enshrine the capitalistic mode of healthcare delivery.   18) If gay marriage is a violation of the ""equal protection"" clause of the Constitution, how did that ""right"" lie undiscovered since 1868, a span of almost 150 years?   Systemic heteronormativity.   19) If gun-free zones are effective and border fences are ineffective, why is the border of the White House surrounded by a huge fence guarded by lots of Secret Service agents with guns?   I'm not sure anyone actually argues that border fences are ineffective rather than that they are a waste of money and lead to human rights violations.  Also, gun-free zones are zones where people not acting in an official capacity for the government are not allowed to bring guns, which includes the White House.   20) If black Americans commit 49.3% of all murders and account for 51.5% of all violent crime among juveniles, yet there are almost two white Americans killed by the police for every black American (2,151 vs. 1130 over 12 years), then arenât black Americans actually less likely to be killed by police than youâd expect given the crime statistics?   I have no idea where they got that statistic because we don't have good data on police shootings.  There. All 20 questions answered."

Of particular importance was the rediscovery of the ancient classic texts, most notably the work of the Greek natural philosopher Aristotle, through retranslations from Arabic.  Also of note is the reception of advances in astronomy and mathematics made in the Islamic world during the 10th century, such as the development of the astrolabe.

I didn't see any on the side bar, so I posted it.   Few highlights:   No, not at all. I'm not saying something about art so much as about creation, that the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. All of creation reflects God's glory (Though none more so than man, in God's image and made male and female), and we can see Christ Crucified in everything. Great art depicts this particularly well.   Some very bizarre art theories.    I was hedging about how great things were in Europe, clearly not everything was peaches and cream in Europe during most of Christianity's history, and one of the main problems that has faced Christendom was periodic attacks by pirates.    Very ridiculous European history.    Those most interested in acquiring slaves have, historically been Muslim. In fact, from the mid-1600's to the mid-1800's more Europeans were captured as slaves by Muslim pirates than there were slaves imported into the US (and what would become the US) ([More on the muslim slave trade](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_slave_trade)   More muslims are the bad guys (always).    Part of my argument (the one that is not directly connected to grace) has been that marriage allows for the accumulation of capital, which allows for greater free time and more time for contemplation. If your town is being attacked that's probably where your energy is going to be directed, rather than toward capital investment or art. Edit: hence my mentioning Islam above was a hedge. What follows is not a hedge, but is expanding on the idea that marriage, as Christians understand it, is good for a society.   And finally, the punchline! Remember this whole thread is about whether gay people should marry. Apparently not, because Islam.    I don't think Islam's (historical) penchant for violence can be blamed on race. It seems more probable that the rapid expansion of the Muslim slave trade is related to polygamy.    Is by far, one of my favorite sentences."

That, and it's a fun practice of subjective morality.  All that being said, I also do like to try and look at things objectively. And, objectively speaking, if hitler is literally as evil and awful as people make them out to be, what's that make his followers? Those people willingly chose to follow Hitler. Purely from an objective standpoint, the amount of 'hate' that goes towards hitler, but not his followers is a bit ridiculous.  That, and the fact that people just get filled up with blind emotional rage when hitler is mentioned, which makes them completely unable to discuss the actual pros/cons of the historical person (which there is clearly a fuckton more cons). But that doesn't mean that the question is worth dismissing entirely.  As I've mentioned in a few other comments, I'm no expert in history, but if even one of those things that the linked post mentioned is true, then certainly it should be worth discussing?  A fun related exercise is to look at fictional villains. Characters like Ganondorf (from the Zelda series) are certainly 'pure evil'. But they also do good things a very small fraction of the time. Ganondorf is hungry for power, but we also see him try and claim land for his people. We see him only chase his goal, rather than try to slaughter anyone that gets in his way (which his goal itself isn't really all that evil).  Likewise, ""real villains"" can be seen in the same sort of light. I'm not an expert in Hitlerology (or al-Baghdadiology), but I'm willing to bet with how much support Hitler got, there must be something in his rhetoric that people found inspiring. Or are you trying to say that the entire country that followed him is just as awful? I honestly can't say either way, since I haven't looked into this stuff.  But something tells me that an entire nation of people wouldn't just randomly go crazy and want to slaughter and kill a bunch of people for no reason and not have a good intention (at least what they think is a good intention) in the back of their mind.  And again, this dips a bit into subjective morality. There's a reason why this is a thing. When you don't realize the quotes are from hitler, you find yourself agreeing. Do you disagree with the quotes simply because they are said by Hitler? Why or why not?  Subjective morality, and the fact that hitler had so many followers is actually pretty interesting. People don't follow evil fucks for no reason."

It's a universally accepted fact that his team's groundbreaking research for the time was kickstarted in nazi Germany. (I know this is no place to talk about this, but just in case someone wants to know more or fact check here's a rare(ish) but high-quality doc on the topic, Wikipedia for more.)

The thing that gets blown out of proportion about Hitler (for instance, by the linked poster) is the idea that Hitler was in any way remarkable. He was, as you say, put into place by historical forces, but if he hadn't been, it's more than likely that some other far right reactionary, perhaps even another leader of the Nazi party, would have assumed power in Germany (though it's not certain). Hitler didn't create the freikorps militias that provided the core of his stormtroopers, he didn't create the economic crises of the 20's, he wasn't responsible for the creation of the nationalist myths (the stab in the back and so on) that he exploited to get into power. He didn't even really create anything novel in terms of a political philosophy, and he was hardly the mastermind behind most of the Nazis political strategy.

BadEverything,367ure,NUCLEAR_HERO,4,Tue May 19 00:07:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't take your comment as snarky at all.  This is very much 'inside baseball' crap.  Right, so, letâs first start with what conservatism means in its most generic sense of the word.  Conservatism seeks to preserve a nation, state, or societyâs traditional social and political institutions via political and social influence.  Conservatism is not a post-nationalist ideology like liberalism and all the various sorts of socialism.  Conservatism is unique to the nation/culture/society in question because those social and political institutions can be quite different nation-to-nation.  This is why European conservatism and American conservatism arenât 1:1 compatible; although, there are plenty points of commonality due to Americaâs western European heritage).  European conservatism, for example, traces its roots to support for the monarchies of Europe resisting the turbulent social changes that led to democratization.  American conservatism, by contrast, is about preserving and protecting Americaâs founding (small ârâ) republican principles represented and codified by the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution.  Our Founding Fathers and their ideas were products of the European/Scottish Enlightenment -- they were very much the progressive liberals of their time.  American conservatism is, essentially, about preserving the liberal/progressive heritage of our forefathers.  There are different strands of conservatism just as there are different strands and forms of socialism.  These strands of conservatism may often appear very similar (or even indistinguishable) from one another, but they have different philosophical origins and roots.  They also shouldnât be confused with right-wing nationalism which isnât conservatism at all, but there are so many points of commonality that they are, again, almost indistinguishable.    Paleoconservatism/traditional conservatism, which is sometimes called the âold-rightâ, is rooted in the Jeffersonian/southern-agrarian tradition.  There isnât a firm set of policy positions that define paleoconservatism, but by and large paleoconservatives believe in Jeffersonâs philosophy of a small and humble Republic with de-centralized authority and an emphasis on individual liberty and civil rights.  It's a philosophy centered around preserving traditional American political (Declaration/Constitution) and social (western European heritage) institutions. To that end, traditional conservatism values de-centralization and regionalism rather than centralization and nationalism. The idea is that your family, local community, state, and geographical region are the most important political sub-divisions with paramount power residing with the individual state or reserved to the individual (as per the Constitution). It actually resembles a quasi-libertarian philosophy in its emphasis for individual liberty and hostility toward government/national state EXCEPT when that philosophy conflicts with preserving western European heritage and identity. Traditional conservatism is distrustful of and hostile toward globalization which means, in practical terms, traditional conservatives oppose open-ended free trade agreements such as NAFTA and especially the current TPP proposal. A traditional conservative would seek to preserve American jobs and industry that become a casualty to globalization. Traditional conservatism is also opposed to foreign interventionism and the sort of Wilsonian/Trotskian foreign policy that is en-vogue on both sides of the aisle. Note: non-interventionism is NOT the same thing as isolationism. Non-interventionism was the default conservative position for most of its history. Only recently has that changed -- namely the post-9/11 Bush Administration.  Paleoconservatives tend to be as distrustful of big business as they are of big government properly recognizing that big business is as big a threat to liberty and the traditional American way of life as government is.  Neoconservatism was founded, largely, by former radical communists (specifically Trotskyites) from the 1960s who became disillusioned with socialism and moved to the right.  Leaders of neoconservatism include Bill Kristol, Irving Kristol (Billâs father), David Horowitz, Paul Wolfowitz, etc.  Neoconservatism stresses American exceptionalism and American nationalism which is in contrast to paleoconservatism that stresses a more humble de-centralized American republic.  When these former Trotskyites moved to the right, they retained certain beliefs that lay at the core of Marxist theory.  The most prominent of which is the idea that itâs a Marxist obligation to spread the workerâs revolution worldwide; they simply substituted Marxist theory for American/Capitalist principles and used the same tactics to accomplish the same goal of spreading their ideology.  Thus, neoconservatives are very much hawkish interventionists seeing American interference and âleadershipâ in global affairs as a means to spread American exceptionalism and as a means for promoting global capitalism.  In order to support this robust American presence abroad, they need a centralized state at home.  Neoconservatives, in contrast to paleoconservatives, believe in using the power and scope of the Federal government to achieve âconservativeâ ends even when the means for doing so is extra or even non-Constitutional.  For example, imposing Federal education standards via No Child Left Behind.  Rather than believe in limited/constitutional government, neoconservatives very much believe in government as opposed to old-right conservatives who distrust and oppose it.  Neoconservatives use progressive ends to achieve so-called âconservativeâ ends.  Neoconservatism is very much a post-nationalist philosophy due to its origins in Trotskyism.    Anyway, sorry that was so long.  That wasnât a great explanation of the difference between the two, but it may give you some idea of how the two differ."
BadEverything,367ure,Ingens_Testibus,1 point,Tue May 19 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"thanks so much!  Looking into this more, it seems like neocons seem to have more or less usurped the umbrella term ""conservative"" as it relates to role of government. It seems like neoconservatives are much more concerned with social conservatism than government or economic conservatism, at least until either of those interfere with the social order in a direct way, such as government approval of gay marriage or through welfare for the poor. paleoconservatives seem to be much more concerned with keeping the government in check which means eschewing government control/influence over American social life. I kinda like that actually, even though I identify as democratic socialist."
BadEverything,367ure,NUCLEAR_HERO,1 point,Tue May 19 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"It seems like neoconservatives are much more concerned with social conservatism than government or economic conservatism   This is largely correct.  They absolutely have usurped what it means to be a conservative.  This largely happened as a result of the Bush Administration. W. Bush didn't start out as a neoconservative, but he surrounded himself with neocons who advocated that agenda.  9/11 really gave them the opportunity to act with near impunity which led us to one of the most disastrous wars in American history.    Neoconservatives ally themselves with two other conservative elements:  the evangelicals (which there is crossover with paleocons) and 'wall street' Republicans.  There is a large portion of the evangelical movement within the Republican Party that is also more than happy to use the size and scope of the Federal government to accomplish their own ends which centers on Biblical law.  These are the 'culture warriors' who would outright ban homosexuality on the Federal level if they got the chance despite the fact that it is inconsistent with our founding principles and the US Constitution.    The Wall Street crowd is also resistant to 'big government' unless it comes to oversight and regulation and then they scream to the heavens.  Big Business hates having to comply with 50 states with independent laws they must comply with which drives up their costs and hurts the bottomline.  Nobody likes big government like Wall Street does (convention wisdom notwithstanding) -- they would much rather the Federal government flex its muscle and pass a single national law/regulation they must comply with which is cheaper than complying with 50 separate state regulations and laws.  The problem, of course, is that this takes power away from the states to regulate and oversee business consistent with the desires and wishes of their people as expressed through their elected representatives in the state legislature.  We live in a country that was diverse from the moment it was founded.  The original thirteen colonies were chartered by individuals and groups who came to the New World for different purposes and different reasons.  Those colonial charters protected the rights of those individuals to govern, to a degree, in whatever manner they pleased.  Those colonial charters were changed, edited, amended, and eventually became state constitutions.  We have always been diverse which is why our US Constitution gave so much power to the individual states.  A big reason why our political discourse has become so sour is that we're a diverse country with a Federal government that imposes a singular centralized policy on everyone.  Our states were supposed to be laboratories of social change where the legislatures could experiment with different policies that best suited the citizens of that state.  In practical terms, it would allow more progressive states to implement progressive policies free of overriding Federal law; likewise, conservatives states would be free to do the same.  Moderate states could meld the two.  I sincerely believe that if the states properly exercised their Constitutional authority with a Federal government that limited itself to its enumerated powers, our political discourse would significantly cool off.  But you have neoconservatives imposing their agenda on the entire country infuriating and alienating progressives; you have progressives doing the same alienating conservatives.  I don't know how, in the real world, we can improve things but we can't continue to go on like this as a nation."

OMG this shit is a big pile. It goes on forever!  Oh here we go, my area of expertise!   This is my main gripe with feminism. Not its cause, no the original feminist cause was a good one and was in line with egalitarianism, humanism, ethics, moralism and masculinism.   This little passage contains all the clues to what's coming next. He doesn't say what ""the original feminist cause"" and I can't tell if he's saying abolition or suffrage.

Code word for ""men's rights.""

I'd never even heard of Scum Manifesto until I came to Reddit. And anyone who thinks Dworkin is a ""man hater"" â which is code for ""uppity female"" â is just parroting something they heard elsewhere and has zero familiarity with her work.

What a wondrous age we live in!  Oh crap, we don't yet, do we?   Since the second wave, feminism has more and more been about hating men and 'fighting' more and more petty 'oppressive acts'.   Sorry that feminists complain about FGM, human trafficking, lack of representation, lack of access to medical care, lack of justice, acceptability of maiming and killing women just for being women, and child rape.  They just hate men, you see.   Just look at the recent 'mansplaining' and 'manspreading' rubbish and similar 'issues'.   Looks like someone needs to read babby's first social critique and learn what widespread, deeply impactful realities those things are emblematic of.

Others were along the lines ""crack out the nukes, we need the Big G back"" such as in the later one where the story resurrected the corpse of proto Godzilla so he could fight King Ghidorah (who later come back from the future as Mecha King Ghidora to fight the resurrected Godzilla). The more recent American Godzilla though? I don't know. Its message was all over the place, and they try to give Ken Watanabe a connection to the nuclear bombings of Japan buts it's never explored.

BadEverything,2z07r1,GenericUsername16,-4,Sun Mar 15 23:15:58 2015 UTC,"Everyone isn't racist or misogynist. As for misogyny, the majority of members are women.  Don't confuse hate of one group with hate of another."

BadEverything,2yxnu8,dave35,6,Fri Mar 13 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"What-would-be-R1-if-this-was-BadEconomics:  ""Second-wave"" coffee shops such as Starbucks were very important in the development of the modern specialty coffee market. The poster is also confused about how competition works, and suffers from confirmation bias about the state of the specialty coffee industry.  Furthermore, the poster's view of the relationship between atheism and Christianity is simplistic and confused, not to mention US-centric.  And the word 'disrupts' does not mean what this person thinks it means."
BadEverything,2yxnu8,yourderek,4,Fri Mar 13 18:25:30 2015 UTC,Looks like the mods agreed with you and removed it. I'm almost sad I missed it!
BadEverything,2yxnu8,Bloody-Vikings,5,Fri Mar 13 19:18:54 2015 UTC,I wish I'd saved it. That was one of the worst interdisciplinary screeds I've ever read.
BadEverything,2yxnu8,yourderek,8,Fri Mar 13 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"This would be it, correct?     The reason is because both ideas are in direct conflict with each other. Your example is perfect as just as Christianity is incompatible with athesim. So is Starbucks to Really good coffee.  The hatred comes from the one disrupts the other.  Atheism disrupts Christianity with rational reasoning. Christianity disrupts atheism by forcing faith based education over scientific.  As your local coffee shop disrupts starbucks when they serve far superior coffee. But Starbucks disrupts small coffee shops by massive francising and by the ease of distribution.  Long and short many here are looking for the BEST coffee and see starbucks doing what Macdonald's did to really good mom and pop burger shops."
