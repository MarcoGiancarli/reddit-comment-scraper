WisconsinBadgers,3e059z,JSmoove3459,10,Mon Jul 20 22:57:02 2015 UTC,Awesome. Warms my heart to see the people that booed him over the years to eat crow and recognize he has a chance in the NBA
WisconsinBadgers,3e059z,Herpesdeep,5,Tue Jul 21 01:20:13 2015 UTC,Wonder if he'll make the cut. If not I'm sure he could play in Europe for a bit. One thing that helps the Badgers is they are fundamentally strong.
WisconsinBadgers,3d2nvv,GaryLLLL,6,Mon Jul 13 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"I like Jump Around as much as anyone else, but I always find it a bit odd to call something a tradition that didn't even begin until after I graduated from UW.  I'm way too old for Reddit, aren't I."
WisconsinBadgers,3d2nvv,WiscDC,3,Mon Jul 13 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"It's a newer tradition than some things, but a tradition nevertheless. (Then again, it was well-established by the time I got here...I'll get off your lawn.)  Of course, there's no way I'd actually call it the greatest tradition in college football, anyway (if I'm being even a tiny bit objective). That said, I suppose it's fun to win social media campaigns."

It'll cost taxpayers 8 dollars per household for the next three years, and it'll bring positive change. It's time to stop ignoring Milwaukee, and give the people there something to look forward to."
WisconsinBadgers,3chtlh,Guriinwoodo,2,Wed Jul 8 06:26:59 2015 UTC,"yeah it seem most people are only against it because they are already against Walker so they just blindly hate anything he proposes, and also his plan for funding the arena coincides with education cuts...really f'n stupid on his part unless he's trying to lose public support, because when it boils down to it, it's actually a really good thing for the state as you say...it's just easy for the ignorant to spew ""omg that evil walker wants to fund an arena for millionaires at the expense of our children's education!"" when that is an extremely over-simplified and inaccurate viewpoint"
WisconsinBadgers,3chtlh,BarkMingo,6,Wed Jul 8 16:32:36 2015 UTC,Then why can't Walker propose an 8 dollar raise in taxes for education? I think the priorities are a little blurred.
WisconsinBadgers,3chtlh,Bret53,-7,Wed Jul 8 18:07:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't have a problem with the new arena if the teams in Milwaukee were actually good.

WisconsinBadgers,3chtlh,Guriinwoodo,-3,Wed Jul 8 15:48:51 2015 UTC,Most likely and actual being in the top three are completely different.  When was the last time they were actually really good?

WisconsinBadgers,3chtlh,boatagainsthecurrent,-3,Wed Jul 8 16:12:44 2015 UTC,"They haven't had success since the early 2000's, and before that they would have one good run every 10 years.  It just doesn't make sense to create a new arena for a team that doesn't do anything.  If they were consistently above average I would say go ahead.  I just don't see the investment worth while."
WisconsinBadgers,3chtlh,The_Drunk_Kraken,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"Spend 3 minutes reading up on the team. New owners, Jason Kidd as head coach and we have perhaps the greatest team in terms of potential. MCW, Giannis, Middleton, Jabari Parker, Monroe? They're all 25 and under and are already good enough to compete for a home court advantage in the playoffs. In two years? I expect to be competing for the East title. Instead of just saying ""they suck they don't deserve it"", do some fucking research."

WisconsinBadgers,3chtlh,amer1juana,4,Wed Jul 8 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"You're wrong. The owners will be forced to sell the team back to the NBA if they don't get the stadium in Milwaukee. They won't get nearly the same return on their investment if they are forced to sell back to the NBA. I can't believe the owners aren't footing more of the bill right now, but why would they when they can make the taxpayers pay for the stadium for them? I hope that the current deal ends with more of the owners money and less of the state than it currently is, but we'll see"
WisconsinBadgers,3c05xn,dainomite,11,Fri Jul 3 15:57:02 2015 UTC,I completely agree that MBB beating an undefeated Kentucky in the Final Four was more important for UW than beating Auburn in the Outback Bowl. Both were amazing though.

WisconsinBadgers,3bj668,nutty15,10,Mon Jun 29 17:45:36 2015 UTC,He's at Virginia. It would be a tough sell for him to make a lateral move. Gard has the advantage of knowing the current players too

Besides improving the football non-conference schedule and upgrading some of our athletic facilities what has he done that sets him apart as an amazing or above average AD?   I think we can both agree the recent success in basketball is due to Bo not Barry. As for football, there has been large amounts of turnover in the coaching staff with a lot of links to him as the reason (I don't believe he is the reason for them but I'm just repeating what many people have reported/speculated). Men's hockey just had the worst season in history and he still kept Eaves as head coach. This makes me question how much he understands or is involved in the ""obscure"" sports.   I love Barry the head coach as much as anyone else, however, I struggle to find any positives from his tenure as AD that can be directly correlated to his decisions."
WisconsinBadgers,3bj668,FeedMyBabyTurtles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:35:49 2015 UTC,This is just speculation but I think some of the friction between Barry and the football coaches is about how the coaches can't recruit typical idiot jocks but Barry holds firm on UW's academic standards. Barry holds Wisconsin to a higher standard than their own coaches do and that's why we've had problems with football coaches. Bo also sides with Barry on this academics issue but he only needs to bring in 3 or 4 freshmen a year instead of the 10-20 freshmen that a football team needs.
WisconsinBadgers,3bj668,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,2,Mon Jun 29 21:30:41 2015 UTC,I agree with the academic standards but those aren't set by Barry. Those are determined by the admissions department and the school/chancellor.   This also doesn't answer my question about why people regard Barry as a good AD and not just a legendary coach who turned our football program around
WisconsinBadgers,3bj668,WiscDC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:59:04 2015 UTC,This also doesn't answer my question about why people regard Barry as a good AD and not just a legendary coach who turned our football program around   People do have a tendency to blend the two together.

WisconsinBadgers,3bemle,wackywiener,5,Sun Jun 28 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"He's probably a guy they picked up to bring energy in summer league and training camp without really having the intention of him making the roster, happy for him regardless."
WisconsinBadgers,3bemle,Superflyhomeboy,2,Sun Jun 28 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"I think he has enough size, defensive chops and shooting ability to make an NBA roster. However, that may be a bit optimistic. He may just not be athletic enough or able to do much else on offense.   But thinking about his skills, he can definitely hit open threes, and he has enough size to guard the guard positions. I guess we'll see in Summer League how he looks against better talent, if he can stay in front of them. I won't count on it but I really think he can do it."

They were never comparable."

WisconsinBadgers,3bbypn,Guriinwoodo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"He took a noticeable step forward last year. I remember, during the series against MTU, noticing that he seemed to be a little more up to speed than he was at the start of the year, where you could see his skill, but you could also tell he was just turning 18 and not quite ready to be a featured guy. (I'm pretty sure I remember Baggot say he was a projected 2nd round pick a year ago, for what it's worth.)"
WisconsinBadgers,3bbypn,Guriinwoodo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah near the end of the year the skill of him and rockwood was quite noticeably above their other line members. Then again, it's also a testament to how subpar our juniors and seniors were this year."
WisconsinBadgers,3bbypn,BuckyCop,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:35:33 2015 UTC,"Yup. From what I heard, they were both supposed to be good players, but not immediate impact players. With such a thin team last year, that was exposed. Hopefully they can really step into their own this year."
WisconsinBadgers,3ba391,WiscDC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:55:29 2015 UTC,"Like last year, this game was an absolute blast! Not only was it great to see so many Wisconsin alumni playing in Madison again, but it benefits the UW Hospital burn center. For those who want to really see where that money goes, watch this.  As some on social media speculated, JJ Watt was the surprise guest that had been talked about. (In this game, all penalties led to penalty shots, and Adam Burish was the one who brought in a pinch-hitter for his penalty shot - that's when Watt was introduced.) He actually shot on both goalies (don't worry about why that would be - the red team scored 3 goals on one play later on). I haven't found video of his second attempt, which was on Jessie Vetter. With that in mind, here's my crappy video. It came out decently, but I only had mobile phone viewing in mind, so it's annoyingly vertical. You can see what's going on, though. Vetter appears to kind of fall away while kind of trying, while Elliott launched himself out of the goal crease  Further reading and photos, and an interview with Watt, can be found here.  Edit: NBC 15 video and article - This one includes a better look at Watt's second attempt. (And yes, there is a player with a morph suit on. I'm not sure who that was, but he did play at least one shift like that.)  Edit 2: Wisconsin Badgers facebook photo album has a few more pictures."

If you're expecting someone to bring in 10 rebounds, and play good inside defense you'll be disappointed.

Here's another article about the event.   Captains for the game are San Jose Sharks forward Joe Pavelski and New York Rangers forward Derek Stepan. Olympian and All-American Jessie Vetter will be in goal for Pavelski’s Team Red, which also features NHLers Adam Burish, Robbie Earl, Jake Gardiner, Andrew Jourdey and Joe Piskula. Also headlining the Stepan-led Team White is Olympian Hilary Knight and, from the NHL, Brian Elliott, Tom Gilbert, Geoffrion, Jake McCabe, Jack Skille, Craig Smith, Brad Winchester and Brendan Woods.   In addition to the NHL/Olympic players, ESPN's John Buccigross will emcee the event. There are some undisclosed surprises in store for fans as well.   Video: Blake Geoffrion speaks about the event - Part 1, Part 2  Speaking from my own experience, the comedy injected into last year's game was worth the price of admission alone."

Considering how the student body was pretty against Nike then, I just can't imagine the Athletic Department would suddenly forget what happened five years ago.  Moreover, Under Armour is headquartered in Maryland. It would make sense for them to outfit B10 teams similarly to how Nike (located in Oregon) works closely with Pac12 teams."

His inattention to recruiting and oversight of his Assistant Coaches is inexcusable.  He completely lost last years' team in a manner I have never seen in a major program.    I really think Barry dropped the ball on this one. I know he probably doesn't care too much about Hockey since Football and Basketball have had recent success, but Hockey used to be a major positive cash flow for UW Athletics, but I know my family and several families we sat with have decided to no longer renew our season tickets. Between the rising costs of going downtown and the dismal brand of hockey, we would rather watch on TV and do other things with our weekend evenings.

He's not moving up to a lottery pick next year, and he will likely go mid 1st round.  May as well get an extra year of income in; if he stays he might get injured, will be double teamed all year and is 10x more likely to drop than move up in the draft.

WisconsinBadgers,37dbdr,dainomite,8,Tue May 26 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"Mitch Sherman is high   I'll see your temptation to pick Minnesota, Brian, and raise it by going all in on the Gophers.  If the Gophers get to the Saturday after Thanksgiving with a chance to win the division, unlike last season at Wisconsin, I think Kill's group gets it done in the Axe game...Against a one-dimensional Wisconsin offense in the cold -- and snow that I envision in the long-term forecast -- the Gophers win the race to 20 points and probable victory   One-dimensional offense eh?  Does he know who our coach is?  QB's have been looking better than the normal in Spring, bring it on.  Aranda and Chyrst are gonna pummel the Gophers and the Badgers will win for the 12th straight year."
WisconsinBadgers,37dbdr,LeSuperNova,4,Tue May 26 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"I would argue more that our 1 dimension is much more suited to the cold, so our 1 dimensional offense can thrive in a cold pound it out game."
WisconsinBadgers,37dbdr,crewserbattle,2,Wed May 27 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"The big question mark I have going into this season is the offensive line, which feels really weird to say as a badger fan. With Stave looking better and Clement and Ogunbuwale poised to be a solid 1-2 punch, the line is really going to have to step it up."
WisconsinBadgers,37dbdr,byubadger,2,Wed May 27 00:58:24 2015 UTC,"I expect the line to struggle early, kinda like during Anderson's first year, especially with an opener against Bama who should be a bit tougher up front than LSU was, but once we get an easier opponent that lets Clement get an ""easy"" 150-200 yd game, the confidence will be there, and we will be back to pummeling everyone in our path."
WisconsinBadgers,37dbdr,piscina_de_la_muerte,6,Wed May 27 14:08:30 2015 UTC,"the gophers lost maxx williams and david cobb, their main receiving and rushimg threats.... we will see how this goes.... the only receiver we lost is kenzel doe amd he wasnt our main receiver anyway so I think we will be good.

WisconsinBadgers,371gqv,dainomite,3,Sat May 23 23:52:14 2015 UTC,Damn.  Seeing him this past year compared to his freshmen year really puts in perspective how much stronger he got in a real short time.

WisconsinBadgers,3706d9,Wolfeman0101,2,Sat May 23 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"So a freshman is burried behind upperclassmen, two of whom has lots of game experience. Instead of putting in hard work to learn from them and possibly pass them up, he simply pouts and says he'll move.  Sounds like he doesn't have much of a work ethic to me (tho admittedly I don't know). If he can't pass Stave and McEvoy, two average college QBs, good luck playing as a freshman anywhere else.  He would be much better off sitting and learning for a year before playing. Good luck elsewhere, don't let the door hit your ass on the way out."
WisconsinBadgers,3706d9,Jewtheist,9,Sat May 23 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"Way too much judgement and BS assumption.   He wasn't even seen as a quarterback by Chryst.  He wasn't gonna get a fair chance. He's not transferring to start as a freshman, he's transferring so he can get a good shot to do what he wants and what he was originally recruited for.   That's about as good a reason a prospective quarterback who hasn't played a college game yet could have for transferring.   Also, let's say he isn't good enough now and saw a future where he had to wait 3 years to get a chance to start. Is that some sort of indictment on his character that he'd rather go somewhere with a better chance for him to succeed as a quarterback? Does not wanting to be 5th on a depth chart make you pouty and have no work ethic? Hell no. Only if you're an entitled fan."
WisconsinBadgers,3706d9,Wolfeman0101,3,Sat May 23 19:01:42 2015 UTC,If he is #5 on our QB depth chart he probably needs to rethink being a QB. Tons of great players even NFL guys played QB in high school.
WisconsinBadgers,3706d9,ChrisWebersTimeout,4,Sat May 23 19:27:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's not a top-25 NCAA D1 caliber QB, but that doesn't mean he can't be a QB somewhere. Or that it's bad to want to get a fair shot at it. Fair being a shot where the coach sees him as a QB.   Also, he's in a very specific situation here. I don't think it's remotely possible to come to the conclusion that ""he probably needs to rethink being a QB"" based on his depth chart placement with Wisconsin this spring."
WisconsinBadgers,3706d9,Wolfeman0101,2,Sat May 23 19:51:37 2015 UTC,Some guys like Tebow are stubborn and think they are a QB no matter what. He can go to a less stellar program and be  a QB or stay at Wisconsin and fight for his spot or convert to a position he might be better at.
WisconsinBadgers,3706d9,Jewtheist,3,Sat May 23 19:56:37 2015 UTC,If Austin could play like Tebow in college I would want him on my school's team.

WisconsinBadgers,34zpkr,albrnick,19,Tue May 5 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"Main reason is essentially UW academic requirements vs. some of CGA's recruiting targets. Additional factors might have been his west coast (ish) background and more autonomy promised at OSU. OSU probably matched or nearly matched UW for salary. Barry seemed to get along with him fine but the idealogical differences were enough to make CGA jump when OSU opened up. I imagine CGA turned to Barry at some point and asked him to twist some arms in Admissions and (I'm speculating here) found Barry to be uninterested in going that direction (and rightly so, IMHO).  All in all, a bit odd to have such a short tenure, but I think it'll work out for all involved. We've got CPC back in the fold and UW football will keep on keeping on."
WisconsinBadgers,34zpkr,Mendota,4,Tue May 5 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"I think this comment and the one from /u/Buckysaurus gel together. In addition to those two, I heard that Andersen wanted to bring in a lot of junior college transfers (UW usually averages 5-7/season and he wanted to bring in like 12 or something last season) and Barry wasn't down with that at all. The reason behind that is that Andersen, himself, was a JuCo transfer when he played college ball."

WisconsinBadgers,34zpkr,Buckysaurus,9,Wed May 6 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"Besides the whole academic standard smoke screen, I don't think Barry got along very well with him.  Anyone who watched the offense last year knew that something was very wrong.  I have to think Barry harped on him a lot for that behind closed doors especially after our loss to LSU where Melvin was benched, Stave's confidence being leveled to the ground before the season, the McEvoy experiment, and many dumb offensive play calls (see Northwestern game)."

Michigan, Michigan St., Indiana, and of course Marlyand are going to likely be quite good.  Throw in teams like Purdue, OSU, and maybe Iowa that have the potential to be good as well, and you have a crowded conference.  With all the minutes lost, much of the onus of this upcoming season will fall on his shoulders, especially with getting freshmen involved and developing them.    I know it will have to end eventually, but I expect to see the badgers in top 4 every year."

He should be fired, but this is next best I guess.  All that said, resigning Bo was necessary and awesome. The guy knows how to coach Basketball. Congrats Bo!"
WisconsinBadgers,33smzs,BuckyCop,2,Sat Apr 25 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that Eaves is also in a hard position. All the season ticket holders were complaining about how we kept losing players to the NHL after one or 2 years, and its possible Barry put pressure on him to try and run a hockey equivalent of Bo Ryan's mantra (ie no one and dones and try to establish a system that works with it). So now he's in kind of a screwed if you do, screwed if you don't situation. IMO people shouldn't be complaining about this though, since the one and dones are one and dones for a reason, that reason is that they damn good players."
WisconsinBadgers,33smzs,crewserbattle,2,Sat Apr 25 23:02:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with that thought. As a former season ticket holder, I didn't mind the one and done players and neither did any of the people I bought tickets with, reason being the excitement they brought to Eaves' boring and out dated dump and chase play.  Players like Suter, Turris, McDonaugh, Heatley, Pavelski were never going to stay the whole time and any coach would know that, but exploit what you have and use them!  If you look at the recruiting disasters Eaves and Co have had in the past few years it's pretty sad. Commits not called back or kept track of, losing recruits at a much higher level than other schools, just a simple lack of recruiting effort from what I understand.  We should get almost every top recruit in WI to play here. This is not MN with a large amount of D1 schools to compete in state with, this is not the East Coast with a Geographical bunch of schools to compete with, we are the ONLY D1 program in the state, why are we losing all these recruits to MN an the like? We have a great heritage and more Natty Champs than MN.  Eaves recruits poorly, plays a boring style of play and has been unable to hire competent Assistant Coaches in the past 5 years.  Every coach at top tier D1 schools has to deal with one and done players, until the NHL changes their drafting and age rules that's how it will be. We need to adapt to that. We need to build a core of medium talent that will stay for 3-4 years and recruit 1-2 top tier talents EVERY year. We can do it. We have excellent facilities, a formerly great fan base, and a great heritage.  I honestly think looking at all things and looking at other schools, we absolutely should relieve Eaves of his duties."

WisconsinBadgers,3363ou,WiscDC,4,Sun Apr 19 22:15:07 2015 UTC,Can I get an ELI5 on exactly why we were so terrible this year?
WisconsinBadgers,3363ou,thedude388,5,Sun Apr 19 23:05:48 2015 UTC,"I havnt heard a great explanation. Sure, lots of seniors graduated last year, but how are you so bad that you only win 5 games? We should never be that bad. Maybe their hearts just werent in it."
WisconsinBadgers,3363ou,no_YOURE_sexy,6,Mon Apr 20 03:42:40 2015 UTC,4 games.
WisconsinBadgers,3363ou,Innova,2,Mon Apr 20 13:53:41 2015 UTC,"Too lazy to look at the numbers but if I recall correctly we lost a lot of skaters, including most/all of the team leaders."
WisconsinBadgers,3363ou,azing6,2,Mon Apr 20 03:44:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, boy. There's a lot at play. The super simple explanation is that in 2013-14, the Badgers were an elite team, and then they lost a buttload of players, and the replacements couldn't reasonably replace that in their first year.  I don't remember the number of goals that were ""lost"" during the offseason, but it was a huge majority of them, between 9 seniors plus McCabe and Kerdiles. Meanwhile, 3 of the 6 defensemen on opening night were freshmen. (One of those freshman, Keegan Ford, jumped ship in November.)  The returning upperclassmen weren't enough (a combination of quantity and quality) to make up for the players lost. (Many would speculate that the coaches' systems are harder for young teams to get right than for other teams.) A few guys, such as Cameron Hughes, made some strides during the season, but they weren't ready to be the featured guys in their first year. (Expect Hughes to be an impact player moving forward.)  Andy Johnson of Bucky's 5th Quarter has a few articles that go way in depth (with possession stats and all that), along with some notes on recruiting issues.  There's a lot more I could ramble on about, and much more that other fans/writers could tell you about in more than a reddit comment (especially on what caused the factors that caused all those losses), but that's honestly the gist of it. What's crazy is that most Wisconsin fans were expecting a mediocre season, but nobody expected a season that bad."

WisconsinBadgers,32iqoc,terker,8,Tue Apr 14 02:52:49 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Iverson could be a slighty more potent offensive version of Showalter, and comparably to Michael Flowers on the defensive end. He plays tough, aggressive, and confident on D. Once the ball is in his hands, he knows his strengths and goes hard to the paint. My concerns would be discipline on defense, and slight uncertainty on offense, particularly with ball-handling in a trap/press and pulling up to shoot right off the dribble. He is exciting to watch though, either way."
WisconsinBadgers,32iqoc,horizjumper,3,Tue Apr 14 03:49:24 2015 UTC,I think the better question is if these recruits can contribute more than the deep bench players riley dearing or jordan hill. I don't really think so. We're going to be a very young team.
WisconsinBadgers,32iqoc,scofieldslays,2,Tue Apr 14 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"Iverson seems to get a lot of hype for being only a 2-star recruit.  I'm excited for him coming to Madison though.  My biggest concern is that we don't have a player taller than 6'9"".  I did some research (via Wiki) and we've always had someone who was at least 6'10"" on the team since 1999.  It seems like we've always needed a ""big man"" in Bo Ryan's system and I'm not sure if Vitto, Nigel, or Ethan Happ could fill that role well."

WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,Sinisterly,2,Fri Apr 10 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"I think he's smart for leaving now. Next year, he'd be the focal point of defenses instead of Frank and that could hurt his image if he couldn't improve his numbers over this year."
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,unmisunderestimated,2,Fri Apr 10 22:22:43 2015 UTC,I was hoping too but I almost felt selfish for daring to wish him back. Can never blame a projected lottery for moving on.
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,UncharminglyWitty,12,Fri Apr 10 20:39:49 2015 UTC,Incredibly hard to justify staying in school if you have a good shot to be a lottery pick.
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,Jewtheist,8,Fri Apr 10 16:14:37 2015 UTC,thanks for three years sam. good luck in the NBA!
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,The_Courier,2,Fri Apr 10 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"I thought he should have stayed the way Frank did, but after that NCAA tournament I can see why he would go to the NBA.  Now I'm a little skeptical about how good the team will be next year."

WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,griffith12,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:38:39 2015 UTC,I really didn't think he was going to enter the draft.
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,ITBry,8,Fri Apr 10 16:20:14 2015 UTC,He's projected as a lottery. What on Earth would make you think that?
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,UncharminglyWitty,0,Fri Apr 10 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"He has unfinished business in the NCAA. He isnt fully developed and I don't think he is NBA ready this year. Plus going in early causes him to leave money on the table. Just take a look at the Rookie Pay scale. Plus im biased and wanted him to stay.  Lets say he gets picked #15 like projected, he would then make 1.6 mil year one + 1.67 mil year two. ( year1 + year2 = 3.2mil) Then add 3rd year 1.6mil = 4.8 mil.  Now if he would play his senior year and have an amazing year and then goes NBA draft #5 he would make 3.0 mil year one + 3.1 mil year 2. ( year1 + year2 = 6.1mil)   What happens here is that by the end of his second year in the NBA (if he plays senior year) he would make more in 2 years than 3 years if he goes to the NBA now.  Lets back it down a little bit and say he goes #10 (if he played senior year) year1 -1.99mil year2 -2.08 = 4 mil.  Then add on year 3 and its like 6 mil"
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,ITBry,5,Fri Apr 10 20:44:11 2015 UTC,...or he could shred his ACL his senior year and miss out on a ton of that money.
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,MaximumDestruction,3,Fri Apr 10 21:15:53 2015 UTC,Yeah thats always the argument. I don't fault him for declaring.
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,ITBry,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:41:58 2015 UTC,It would take a heroic effort to raise his draft stock to a top five pick.  I'm super bummed but can't say he made the wrong choice.  It sucks especially since we didn't get Diamond Stone.  This team should still be fun as hell next year and pretty good.  I for one cannot wait to see Showy as a starter.
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,MaximumDestruction,4,Sat Apr 11 00:08:22 2015 UTC,"Your entire financial argument completely ignores the extra year he gets in the NBA.  Lets look at the #10 pick (because no matter how good of a year he has he wouldn't be going 5).  4.8mm vs 6mm after 3 years each.  But the 4.8mm gets an extra fourth year with a brand spanking new veteran contract.  That will more than a little put him over 6mm.  Plus, you blow a knee in your senior year and BAM! suddenly you're down to $0.  Also, Dekker's stock isn't realistically going to get higher after the tournament he had. It is a peak time for him to leave."
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,UncharminglyWitty,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:50:56 2015 UTC,I didn't completely ignore it. In 3 years at pick #15 (in the nba 3 years) he makes 4.8 mill. In 3 years at pick #10 (in the nba 2 years ncaa 1) he makes 4 mill.
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,ITBry,2,Fri Apr 10 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"So, you agree that it is financially better for him to go NBA now? I don't get the point of your comment then..."
WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,UncharminglyWitty,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:43:06 2015 UTC,I don't see him moving up any more in the draft honestly. He'll be a better pro than college player

WisconsinBadgers,324p5s,tonny23,7,Fri Apr 10 17:08:06 2015 UTC,Almost certainly a first round pick.  Most likely a late lottery pick or a lower end playoff teams pick.

WisconsinBadgers,31vt8f,jackjack3,2,Wed Apr 8 18:56:46 2015 UTC,I think we'll be matched up against Virginia.
WisconsinBadgers,31vt8f,ChrisWebersTimeout,2,Thu Apr 9 01:46:24 2015 UTC,We would probably get set up with the projected 4/5 of the ACC next season if they are trying to set up competitive matches. I am assuming Dekker is playing for the NBA next season as well.
WisconsinBadgers,31vt8f,Hopalicious,2,Thu Apr 9 05:44:52 2015 UTC,Glad to have this kid but next year we won't have a big man unless we can scrounge someone up. We lost the 2 center recruits we had (Ellison and Stone) .

WisconsinBadgers,31vt8f,OINTMENTS,7,Wed Apr 8 18:37:54 2015 UTC,I don't see him coming back to be honest.  He's projected to be a lottery pick now.    That's just my 2 cents though.   I still think Wisconsin is a capable team to reach the sweet 16 without him even.
WisconsinBadgers,31vt8f,Renegade12,5,Wed Apr 8 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"They have the experience in the guard and forward positions to maybe make the sweet 16 (depending on matchups). They lack a true big, and depth might be a question. Showalter will need to improve, Koenig needs to stop turning the ball over, and Hayes will have to learn to be more consistent.  I can't see us winning the B1G, but I think we'll be competitive, with or without Dekker. If I were Dekker, I'd probably go pro. Hard to improve your draft stock more than he did through the exposure he got during the tournament, and he's running the risk that he gets injured if he returns."

Duke didn't have some calls go their way, we may have had plenty of calls not go our way. In the end Duke was more aggressive at the end, and we missed a bunch of shots that we normally hit, bobbled the ball on catches down-low, fouled too many times early in the 2nd half, and lost the game.   edit: that called sucked , yeah, but we had many opportunities to avoid situations like that."

WisconsinBadgers,31tu8y,WiscDC,5,Wed Apr 8 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"It also comes after Shuchuk called the fans idiots for expecting better than a 4-26-5 record.   Eaves should have gone too, and this is a classic case of somebody(s) taking the fall because, well, someone had to get axed after a failure of that magnitude. Shuchuk definitely deserved to go for his comments  Eaves needs to take a long look at his constantly-stagnating approach. For fuck sakes"
WisconsinBadgers,31tu8y,terker,7,Wed Apr 8 05:04:37 2015 UTC,Eaves shouldn't be on the hot seat. He should be out of a job. Other teams consistently perform with underclassmen.
WisconsinBadgers,31tu8y,pnf1987,2,Wed Apr 8 07:00:26 2015 UTC,"Seems like Shuchuk and Walsh are taking the fall here.  Eaves hired these guys and Eaves was the boss all year.  Eaves led this team straight to the crapper and is consistently poor in the recruiting game. I agree that Shuchuk should be gone after what he said, but Barry needs to let Eaves go as well. I really think the hockey team will see its lowest attendance numbers this year and really hurt financially.  I know I will not be renewing my tickets, I can watch most games on TV now and turn the game off when the dump and chase starts, plus no parking or expensive drinks out!  Barry will get the message when red ink shows up at the Kohl Center."

WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,JillH1995,8,Tue Apr 7 16:55:27 2015 UTC,"I was too. I think the Badgers having to play in a tough semifinal took a toll on the team and they were tired at the end of the game. Duke coasted through Michigan State, and were more rested going into the championship game."
WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,Wiskeybadger,2,Tue Apr 7 18:00:06 2015 UTC,The title game should be moved to a Wednesday in my opinion. There's no reason that the amount of rest the games have had should play a role in the title.
WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,iCantDieSoWhyDontYou,4,Wed Apr 8 14:51:56 2015 UTC,No they won't. Do you remember how epic UNC vs. Illinois was in the championship? Or how the Louisville vs. Illinois game was before that?   NOPE

WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,1curlygurl,12,Tue Apr 7 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"Well, the refs did make bad calls.  Just like in the Kentucky game, where bad calls went both ways.  But bad calls didn't lose the game for us.  Not making shots and not slowing down and playing our game are at least part of what lost the game for us.    I agree.  Stay classy Wisconsin.  Couldn't be more proud of the team, on and off the field, and the state."
WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,JillH1995,8,Tue Apr 7 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"This one feels different for me that the other tough losses we've suffered in other sports in recent years. Yeah, the refs made bad calls. Yeah, the players couldn't hit shots toward the end of the game. But I just feel bad for the players. I wanted to see these goofballs win a championship. They did do great, won the Big Ten, and the regional, but having the top prize so close and not getting it... I feel bad for them. They made a lot of memories along the way, and I'll never forget how fun this team was."
WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,Wiskeybadger,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"I feel the worst because this was likely our shot. This was likely Bo's shot. This was this team's shot.

I don't think it'll be another 74 years but I don't see us competing for the title often with the age of the one and done teams."

When you regularly chant ""Eat Sht and Fck You"" or just ""F*ck Kentucky"" there is nothing classy about it.  I was ashamed of our student section this weekend. It's one thing to be passionate about your team, it's another thing to be a pretentious asshole about it.  I was waiting for the refs to call a technical on the student section for unsportsmanlike."
WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,lemmiwinkers,0,Tue Apr 7 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they've been doing that forever. Classic student section. When they're not saying it to the other team, they are saying it to each other."
WisconsinBadgers,31qp6z,SonOfGallifrey,3,Tue Apr 7 21:19:11 2015 UTC,Makes us look horrible on the national stage. Not a good representation of UW
WisconsinBadgers,31r4nx,radyence,13,Tue Apr 7 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"And from a team perspective, this was such an emotional blow. Unlike last year, we improved this year. It isn't reasonable to think him staying will help push us to a championship next year. I'd hate to see him go, but I think it's best we take a full step back from these glorious past two seasons and be grateful for the games and heart they gave us."
WisconsinBadgers,31r4nx,WeathermanDan,6,Tue Apr 7 15:38:36 2015 UTC,Yea unfortunately it would be best for dekker to hit the draft.
WisconsinBadgers,31r4nx,scofieldslays,0,Tue Apr 7 17:11:25 2015 UTC,True. Although those 2 airballs in the national championship have to hurt that stock
WisconsinBadgers,31r4nx,Wiskeybadger,3,Tue Apr 7 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"Sam's gone. They don't have the team to compete next year, and any drop in his stock during the regular season was made up for during the tournament. He won't go any higher than he would now, and the Duke game won't hurt his stock."
WisconsinBadgers,31r4nx,JillH1995,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"I won't be too surprised either way. On one hand, he's good enough to succeed in the NBA and make his money. He's accomplished more than any other Badger (other than his teammates) in recent history. His draft stock probably won't improve a whole lot.  On the other hand, Sam might want to get his degree. This gets along very well, and they're the best of friends. Frank showed how much fun your senior year can be. The Badgers have an outside chance at the championship again if he returns.  Sam has a difficult decision, and I don't think either route would be bad for him. I want to see him succeed either way."
WisconsinBadgers,31r4nx,G0PACKGO,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:49:45 2015 UTC,He has a great chance at being B1G player of the year next year
WisconsinBadgers,31r4nx,cfochs,0,Thu Apr 9 22:09:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  He didn't exactly improve his draft stock with the duke game.  With Frank gone next year, Sam will play a larger role in the offense.  Also, I think it is optimistic to say that he would be a top 15 pick."
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,jack_tukis,8,Tue Apr 7 12:16:56 2015 UTC,Too many shit calls to count in the second half.
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,Snookiwantsmush,8,Tue Apr 7 14:21:58 2015 UTC,This one was huge. Instead of joining the big guy on the bench with 4 fouls he gets 2 points. Very different game if this call is correctly made.
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,BrewCrewKevin,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"And IIRC, Duke did the exact same thing next time down the court, and it was a no-call. Then Dukan got frustrated and tried it on our end and got called on the charge.  I'll have to rewatch that part though. I was sort of raging too much to be coherently watching."
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,Hopalicious,5,Wed Apr 8 22:36:33 2015 UTC,If that's not a charge I don't know what is.  He literally walked right through him.
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,Brucho,5,Tue Apr 7 15:10:28 2015 UTC,"Fouls are incredibly subjective. His left foot was not planted when the contact occurred which may be what the official saw. But who knows, they didn't see two clear out of bounds calls later in the game that denied us two chances to get back into the game."
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,Brucho,12,Tue Apr 7 14:23:33 2015 UTC,Feet don't have to be planted if you're moving backwards.
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,Wiskeybadger,3,Tue Apr 7 14:25:00 2015 UTC,"True, but these shit officials probably saw a foot shuffle and failed to analyze the totality of the play. They were shit officials so that's likely what happened."
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,Brucho,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:36:03 2015 UTC,I think the refs excuses are kind of taken away when Winslow literally just continues to push through him and sends him to the ground.
WisconsinBadgers,31qnln,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"I am not defending them, just thought I'd chip in on what their reasoning for the call is. I believe they failed to examine the play as a whole, if they had they would have called the charge."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,Alexanderthegrates,27,Tue Apr 7 03:17:05 2015 UTC,How do the announcers easily see it but the dumbass refs don't...
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,Darktroop6,20,Tue Apr 7 03:18:11 2015 UTC,Everyone in the world could see that
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,TheRealRG3,5,Tue Apr 7 03:19:30 2015 UTC,that was obvious to me watching it live.
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,nietzsche_niche,11,Tue Apr 7 04:26:25 2015 UTC,The best part is...these refs will work the tournament next year rather than be banned from the sport.
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,jecxjo,12,Tue Apr 7 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"I don't fucking understand, ""LOOK HIS FINGER TOUCHES THE BALL, BUT IDK WHO IT WAS OFF OF LEL"" bullshit lmao"
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,Darktroop6,5,Tue Apr 7 03:27:47 2015 UTC,"Because the refs still get to make the final decision. Imagine if at your job someone else got to look at your work, evaluate it, give really compelling advice about how and why you made a mistake and you still said, ""Nope, fuck you I was right and I am sticking with it."" That's what the refs did."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,Hopalicious,16,Tue Apr 7 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"It was a tough call until they did the zoom in and you could clearly see his finger bend back from the ball. As a neutral observer, WI started taking some bad shots at the end there. They aren't used to rushing and that was their downfall. I sincerely hope Bo gets another chance. I love his style."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,CornDoggyStyle,13,Tue Apr 7 03:36:45 2015 UTC,Didn't make our shots down the stretch and paid for it in the end. Had we done that the call wouldn't have mattered.
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,ShakeyBobWillis,5,Tue Apr 7 03:57:34 2015 UTC,"But we didn't. And the call did matter. And they got it wrong.   It doesn't matter if the badgers played like shit, if they play .000000001% better than the other team, they should still win."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,smiles134,4,Tue Apr 7 05:00:25 2015 UTC,The call was shit but we missed four free throws in the first half. We lost by five. Would've been a completely different game if we had made our free throws.
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,Mance_Rayder117,2,Tue Apr 7 06:05:45 2015 UTC,"THIS.  You are the first person I have seen even mention our terrible free throw shooting.  2-6 in the first half, totally uncharacteristic.  If we hit even 2 of those the game outcome is different.  That being said, our poor performance made the game tight, but the refs gave it away."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,ShakeyBobWillis,3,Tue Apr 7 20:03:48 2015 UTC,Yeah it was a bad call. But if it's reversed it still doesn't mean we win because we couldn't hit our shots.    I'm not saying it's ok the call was wrong. I'm saying it wasn't nearly as big a deal as scoring for shit down the stretch. And it certainly can't be said that if the call was made right that we were going to win.
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,TheRealRG3,14,Tue Apr 7 11:53:21 2015 UTC,THAT WAS BULL SHIT
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,PM_ME_UR_ANKLES,9,Tue Apr 7 03:18:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the most logical answer is they didnt see the same replays we saw on the broadcast. The problem comes with the reviewing system. I think it needs to be handled like the NFL switched to this year with someone in an office in New York watching the game feed and all the angles making their opinion known as well."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,hegz0603,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:05:37 2015 UTC,maybe the NCAA should spring for HD screens on the sideline....or the ref's need to update the prescription of their contacts...
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,1curlygurl,6,Tue Apr 7 14:18:50 2015 UTC,"I watch the Badgers but not a lot of basketball otherwise, so I'm far from an expert, but I'm, honestly, not impressed with replay in basketball.  It seems like too fast of a game with too many plays for it to be all that useful.    Bad calls are going to happen and replay doesn't seem to prevent that."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,someone447,3,Tue Apr 7 14:07:52 2015 UTC,That was the second game in a row a replay was egregiously missed. I don't get it...
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,Innova,2,Tue Apr 7 13:49:53 2015 UTC,Clear as something that is very clear.

WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,atomiczap,2,Tue Apr 7 12:20:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I am wondering. Is it pride? Did they let their personal pride in the call they made decide it? Or did they not want to change the game on a call (which they did there, and many other places)? Or were they trying to make Duke win? Or is their vision SO BAD that they literally cannot see that? Those are the ONLY 4 options..."
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,buruzn09,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:53:28 2015 UTC,"It's always safest to stick with the original call and say ""there wasn't enough to change it."""
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,ScienceGivsMeAHadron,2,Tue Apr 7 15:12:51 2015 UTC,If they're going to rig these games they should at least try to be a little careful about it.
WisconsinBadgers,31ph0c,czootzoot,-37,Tue Apr 7 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"You're right and this is exactly why I'm a Minnesota fan. Because if I don't win, I still love to watch you get screwed over. I was disappointed in that call, but boy o boy am I happy it happened to the Badgers!!!"

WisconsinBadgers,31sknn,Kobe_AYEEEEE,3,Tue Apr 7 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of unknown/inexperienced players (obviously that's going to happen when you lose four important seniors and possibly Dekker), but almost all those guys who played in the national championship game last night were unknowns two years ago. This year was our best shot at a title in a long time, but I don't think it's going to be our last in our lifetimes like some are saying (not here, but I've seen it on other sites). We're still ""new money"" on the national stage. We're not used to prolonged success, but I'm with you, OP, the future is bright. Success makes recruiting easier, which in turn make success easier.   Plus we have a consistently ranked football team to look forward to in the fall. Not many schools get to enjoy success in both sports."
WisconsinBadgers,31sknn,JillH1995,2,Wed Apr 8 04:31:48 2015 UTC,"I don't see how Nigel and Koenig could ever put up the same numbers as Sam and Frank but man that would be awesome.  I think a sweet 16 next year is our ceiling, maybe an elite 8 if we play well.  In two years we could definitely be on the 2-3 line come March."
WisconsinBadgers,31sknn,Mance_Rayder117,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:46:18 2015 UTC,In terms of scoring I think there is a great chance. Maybe not quite as well rounded but I think that 25 point game against MSU for Hayes and 16 for BK is a lot of what we will be seeing for the next two seasons.
WisconsinBadgers,31sknn,Mance_Rayder117,2,Tue Apr 7 23:48:39 2015 UTC,Offensively I guess I can see it.  I also think we will be doing a lot less scoring overall though.  Back to the old Wisconsin ways.

He has his reasons, and I'm really not worried about this.  Honestly, I don't think that the ACT score of someone else's recruit who was never committed to Wisconsin in the first place is a relevant post for this subreddit."
WisconsinBadgers,31r6hl,WiscDC,2,Tue Apr 7 18:57:47 2015 UTC,It probably played into it.  But it was kinda funny hearing Bo say he doesn't do one and done players while going hard to bring in a top 10 ranked recruit.  Those are exactly the people who one and done.
WisconsinBadgers,31r6hl,MillorTime,5,Tue Apr 7 17:32:25 2015 UTC,"There's no minimum act requirement. The average accepted student gets a 27-31 but they don't always deny those with lower scores, and a beast like stone would've gotten the pass. Stone chose Maryland over Wisconsin because Bo Ryan doesn't have a system that supports assholes like stone."

WisconsinBadgers,31pi20,Veshy,8,Tue Apr 7 03:54:51 2015 UTC,"We were just so.....passive.  Like, we NEVER pushed.  Duke was in massive foul trouble.  Just give the ball to Kaminsky and have him get fouled very simple."

WisconsinBadgers,31pi20,nietzsche_niche,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:24:49 2015 UTC,That's exactly my biggest problem with basketball. In no other sport (save maybe soccer) do the premier teams and players get such favoritism.

Even smaller without Dekker.

They said Kentucky was an unstoppable juggernaut.   :)  They said Bo Ryan could never play for a national title with a bunch of goofy, fundamentally sound 3-star recruits  They've said a lot of shit, and only assholes and fools will ever say that kind of shit again.   This Badger team and Bo Ryan have given us so very much to be proud of, and I'll love them forever for it.   Those calls as the end were some bunk, and it hurts me inside, but I'm going to play this off with as much composure as I can muster and in a couple days I'll get back to enjoying the amazing ride this team took us on  Thank you so much, Bo.

WisconsinBadgers,31porq,the_whole_asshole,5,Tue Apr 7 13:22:22 2015 UTC,What make me so upset is that we probably will never see another badger team this good.  This was the year and the refs played way to big a part of our loss which kills me.
WisconsinBadgers,31porq,Mance_Rayder117,4,Tue Apr 7 12:51:11 2015 UTC,"What makes me upset is that Okafor was sitting on 4 fouls and it personally looked like he should have been called for a 5th more than once. There was missed calls on both sides of the game, but seriously it looked like they were deliberately not calling it so he could stay in the game."
WisconsinBadgers,31porq,Skweres88,4,Tue Apr 7 14:36:55 2015 UTC,Yes. It became abundantly clear they were not going to call his 5th. Same thing with winslow and his 4th. That blocking foul when he jumped into Duje? Absurd.

WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,WiscOrangy,3,Tue Apr 7 04:17:57 2015 UTC,I think if we had shot better than 41% we should have won regardless of the calls.  Gotta make the buckets count.
WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,chaoticgeetarz,2,Tue Apr 7 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sure going to complain about the refs, but you're right that its on us to make our shots. 4 missed free throws and that easy missed layup give us the game."

WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,Evil_Yoda,2,Tue Apr 7 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"Some calls you get some calls you don't, so you just move on.  Officiating can't take points off the board."
WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,squeak_kacz,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:43:10 2015 UTC,We got fucked by Duke refs for sure but they still out played us. Dekker was off and they forced us to take bad shots. They were who we thought they were and we let em off the hook...
WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,nietzsche_niche,1 point,Tue Apr 7 06:30:06 2015 UTC,And make our free throws in the first. Missed 4 I think plus some very easy buckets. Its was not our best games. Let's not blame the refs for that.
WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,Tensho14,4,Tue Apr 7 04:08:11 2015 UTC,We got called for 13 PFs in 10 minutes. They were called for 13 the entire game.
WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,Tensho14,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:27:05 2015 UTC,Seriously? Do you have a source?
WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,Tensho14,-20,Tue Apr 7 04:27:33 2015 UTC,Go back to irrelevancy you shitty fans at your shitty school in your shitty state. Your whole team sucks. Go Duke.
WisconsinBadgers,31pifa,Tensho14,5,Tue Apr 7 04:42:05 2015 UTC,And Duke can go back to being a NBA player-farm.  I'm loving these Student Athlete vs NBA Prospect games every March and April.

WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,filolif,9,Mon Apr 6 12:26:11 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Now, let's win this thing!"
WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,byubadger,14,Mon Apr 6 14:29:14 2015 UTC,Possibly the game of our lifetime. Enjoy it everyone.
WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,PostCoitalTears,6,Mon Apr 6 13:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, took off work today to make the 4 hour drive. IMO if you can make it to this game you got a duty to go! So I'm goin!"

WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,Telihana,5,Mon Apr 6 14:57:25 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to be pacing in front of the television the entire game.
WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,BadgerMk1,3,Mon Apr 6 18:05:42 2015 UTC,I'm headed to a friend's house in town to watch the game and I'm not sure he knows what he got himself into.

WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,cocolocomoco21,0,Mon Apr 6 23:38:07 2015 UTC,Everywhere is now! Even Hawks is halfway down the block. When Hawks has a line you know shit is real
WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,UncharminglyWitty,2,Mon Apr 6 23:48:29 2015 UTC,That should read everywhere on state st has been packed since then.
WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,Evil_Yoda,0,Mon Apr 6 22:49:05 2015 UTC,It should but it doesn't because they weren't.  Whiskey was fuckin empty for a good while. Hawks just got a line at 5. Brats and chasers were full by 2 but nowhere else really
WisconsinBadgers,31m7u7,UncharminglyWitty,2,Mon Apr 6 23:21:05 2015 UTC,So excited and nervous.  Can't get a thing done today.  GO BADGERS!

WisconsinBadgers,31jsty,WiscDC,2,Sun Apr 5 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"Aaaand I just realized I typed 5. It's six. I can't count, apparently.  Back row, left to right, is: Hilary Knight, Meghan Duggan, Brianna Decker, Annie Pankowski*  The goalies in front are Alex Rigsby on the left and Jessie Vetter on the right.  *For UW fans who don't know, Pankowski is a freshman this year, so you still have the opportunity to head down to LaBahn Arena to watch her play for Wisconsin!"
WisconsinBadgers,31knhh,Devinf999,3,Mon Apr 6 00:17:28 2015 UTC,"Here's the end.  Here's the first half.  Here's the second half. (You can easily hear ""The Horse"" at the beginning...heh.)  I recommend downloading those if you want to listen to them months from now, as they'll eventually go away. (I bookmarked the link for the third period of last year's men's hockey sweep of Minnesota, and I recently went back and it was gone. Luckily, I downloaded it earlier.)  You can get these by going to the ""podcasts"" section of TheBig1070.com. You can find replays of hockey, basketball, football, and even volleyball broadcasts on that site, even though they aren't the primary carrier for any of those teams (they do have some sort of agreement, though, and broadcast games when there are conflicts)."
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,rideride,49,Sun Apr 5 03:16:13 2015 UTC,Been a fan for my whole life. Never really imagined this moment until now. I'm so damn happy and this team is awesome. Now let's finish the job! On Wisconsin! UH RAH RAH!!

WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,eatay,16,Sun Apr 5 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"UK played awful tonight and you guys took every advantage if that. Congrats on a great game. I knew if UK would lose a game it would be against the Badgers. I'm so upset and heartbroken, but the majority of the Wisconsin fans I've seen have been nothing but class. Good luck against Duke and maybe we'll see you next year. Best 2 out of 3.   Edit: Forgot to mention how classy your players were as well. Very humble."
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,thebenron,16,Sun Apr 5 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"I appreciate what you are saying, but to say UK played awful is incredibly disingenuous. UK shot 50% from the floor, committed only 6 turnovers and missed 1 free throw. Make no mistake, Wisconsin did not catch Kentucky on an off night, nor did they play out of their minds like they did in the second half against Arizona. Wisconsin was simply better than Kentucky. Would they win a seven game series? I don't know but I'd love to see it. But this was not a fluke."
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,eatay,10,Sun Apr 5 12:44:09 2015 UTC,"I guess at the time I was thinking about our players who usually dominate and the final few minutes. Three shot clock violations in a row was jaw dropping. WCS only had two points while our other supporting cast didn't take get the shots the usually get. Wisconsin shut them down when it came to our usual players making routine plays, that's what I meant by us playing awful. Wisconsin played to win."
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,WiscDC,3,Sun Apr 5 14:22:04 2015 UTC,"They did not play awfully. I'm not sure who would win a seven- (or more) game series, but something to keep in mind is that Kentucky is probably the best team in the country this year, but Wisconsin is playing their best basketball right now. If these two teams met in December, Wisconsin's chances wouldn't have been as good. I don't know exactly what has led to this, but the difference has been noticeable."
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,jjberg2,3,Sun Apr 5 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly what has led to this, but the difference has been noticeable.   Sam Dekker"
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,WiscDC,4,Sun Apr 5 20:11:53 2015 UTC,"The best games of his career have all occurred within the past month. As I said to my friend after the Elite 8: ""Sam Dekker has arrived. I mean, I guess he was already a star to some degree, but now he's really arrived."""
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,thebenron,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:34:42 2015 UTC,"It's not how you start but how you finish. I don't necessarily buy the argument that Kentucky is the best team in the country, and it bothers me that nobody in the national media is even entertaining the thought that Wisconsin might just be better than them."
WisconsinBadgers,31hihw,jokerkcco,11,Mon Apr 6 06:34:37 2015 UTC,"All I've seen tonight is everyone bagging on UK, but I just want to say congratulations. And beat the crap out of Duke."

WisconsinBadgers,31iyob,BadgerMk1,3,Sun Apr 5 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Please, please, please respect State Street (and the rest of the city). Win or lose, we want to be seen as a passionate, respectful fan base. Cheering for the Badgers shows this. Destroying property makes us look bad (again, whether it's after a win or a loss).   Don't stoop to the level the gopher fans dropped to after losing to Union in last year's frozen four. We don't want to be like them! :)"

WisconsinBadgers,30u5rd,freefoodd,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"Boy, watching Townes get the ball down low against ND, he was absolutely automatic and just a beast to defend. Kaminsky may have his flashy moves, but Townes is just one giant punch in the mouth. I'm really worried about Kaminsky getting in foul trouble. Arizona did a lot of double teams on Frank in the first half of the game and I thought they were really effective.   I'm no future HoF coach like Bo Ryan and Cal, but if I had to make a strategic guess, I'd say both Cal and Bo will be more inclined to take the approach of letting Karl and Frank ""get theirs"" (with the exception of not letting Kaminsky get any looks from deep for UK) and focus on defending everyone else and shutting down the perimeter as much as possible. Dekker + Kaminsky can beat UK by themselves if they are both on fire, but I don't think either can beat UK on their own unless they go like 10/10 from deep (and I wouldn't put that past Dekker...damn it).  Likewise, Towns isn't going to beat Wisconsin by himself. But if this is the approach both coaches take with respect to Frank and Karl, then I don't see them letting one guard the other and risking foul trouble, which means (barring terrible officiating), they'll both probably be on the court for a lot of the game.   Wisconsin, Arizona and Duke were/are the only teams that even have the slimmest chance at beating the Kentucky steamroller.    I don't know about Arizona and Duke, but don't sell yourself short. Wisconsin has an above average chance of beating UK. You guys match up well with us in terms of size at key positions and have a wealth of experienced talent. No offense, but I was rooting against Wisconsin most of the tournament even though I love watching your team for the sole, selfish reason that I was hoping against hope we wouldn't have to play you -- anyone but you -- in the Final Four. But here we are!"
WisconsinBadgers,30u5rd,PostCoitalTears,3,Tue Mar 31 01:45:01 2015 UTC,"In order for us to win, in addition to Sam and Frank playing well, Hayes and Koenig (or even Dukan/Gasser) need to step up and score points.

That is the stuff dreams are made of; few schools can even imagine making it to one. That isn't enough though; Dekker looks to be one of the most energizing players in the country. Kaminsky, likely player of the year, has made it big on the national stage with his on the court performance and goofy-ass dancing. Nigel is now nationally recognized as one of the most likable players. Top it off with Koenig and the other guys and you have one hell of a team, on the court and off.   Proud to be a Badger."

He takes an above average to good player and makes them great. (if they buy into his system.) I think we're seeing what it looks like when Bo gets some extra talented and athletic players to buy in. The result: Final Fours.   The national exposure back to back Final Fours gives a program is probably immeasurable, but we still have to worry about finding guys that a) are academically eligible to play at UW and b) can handle playing in a system that is more team oriented than built around showcasing the skills of one or two star players."
WisconsinBadgers,30jydh,ShabazzJenkins,10,Sun Mar 29 12:57:06 2015 UTC,Im sure the reason we lost him is because he is gonna be a one and done and with Trimble most likely returning they have a better shot of going farther in the ncaa tourney. Im sure academics has something to do with it aswell. But being a Wisconsin fan we should be used to getting snubbed by big recruits.
WisconsinBadgers,30jydh,ZacPack,8,Sat Mar 28 01:00:59 2015 UTC,I cannot confirm but i don't think academics matter to him.. I've heard rumors he got a 14 on the ACT.
WisconsinBadgers,30jydh,vinster30,2,Sat Mar 28 01:34:06 2015 UTC,It was a 13.
WisconsinBadgers,30jydh,Innova,3,Sat Mar 28 06:36:21 2015 UTC,That's what i'm saying. It had something to do with academics. He probably didn't/couldn't want to go to a school with high academic standards.

It's something that you have no control over, and to be perfectly honest, it's a little weird to care about where a 17 or 18 year old wants to go to school. Wisconsin will be fine, they'll continue to recruit players that work well in the system. Support the team on the court and leave the recruiting to the people who are in the know."
WisconsinBadgers,30jydh,Hopalicious,6,Sat Mar 28 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"It's called being a fan.  You want your team to succeed down the road.

Personally I feel bad for the badger Assistants who drove to all of this kids games only to get left at the alter. It's his decision but it's a poor one. We have the better program."
WisconsinBadgers,30jydh,deevotionpotion,0,Sat Mar 28 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"It was less of a decision from what I've seen, he couldn't get the ACT score or grades for Madison. Otherwise I'm pretty sure that's where he'd have committed."

I mean, it's not like it's dumb to have an interest in whether your favorite basketball team will have a super talented player on it. You don't have to get caught up in recruiting to be disappointed Stone decided on Maryland. Why is Wisconsin so great right now? Developing Kaminsky of course, but also getting Dekker as a 5-star recruit. These things do matter. You can't be a top 5 team, a 1 seed, or a final 4 contender without super talented players.  Of course the program will be fine, and Hayes, Koenig, Showalter, and Pritzl should be really good next year. But finding talented front court guys besides Hayes might be a bit of an issue, which would have been wholeheartedly solved if Stone came. We don't have to get caught up in it, and the team will be good  and talented next year—but seeing as this news is 5 hours old, it still stings a bit. I felt like with Stone you could pencil this team in for its third straight top 2 tourney seed, and now that's definitely more questionable. Still extremely possible, just less certain."

Seems the primary reason that Wisconsin players don't graduate is they -wait for it- play professional basketball for 2+ years after playing in college for 4+. Since the NCAA only tracks graduation rates for 6 years, they assume that anyone who doesn't graduate by year 6 ""won't graduate"". Meanwhile, players like Trevon Huges, Joe Krabbenhoft, Jon Leuer, etc. are still playing basketball, and often getting paid pretty well to do it.

WisconsinBadgers,307mce,Myrrun,2,Wed Mar 25 14:14:19 2015 UTC,"Ironically, Kentucky deserves a lot more credit than Wisconsin on this score as, of the players who don’t bolt for the pros, 89 percent of them graduate.   You mean if we ignore all the data that doesn't agree with your conclusion, you're proven right?!  YOU DON'T FUCKING SAY!"
WisconsinBadgers,307mce,s54b32dd,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely; it's total bullshit. The dude's holding Wisconsin to a different standard than UK; the reason UW's grad rate is abysmal is because their seniors often wind up getting drafted in Europe or the NBA before graduation, but they're not ""leaving early"", so they aren't removed from the cohort numbers the NCAA tracks, and they get counted against the school after year 6 (when they're still playing in the pros, and focusing on that rather than graduating). Trevon Hughes, Alondo Tucker, Kammron Taylor, etc. are all still playing basketball professionally, either in the US or in Europe; but, they're black, went to school for 4-5 years and never transferred out, so they're considered ""failures"" by the NCAA metrics for graduation rates."
WisconsinBadgers,305g0x,evilcheeba,3,Tue Mar 24 17:10:13 2015 UTC,Get hype
WisconsinBadgers,305g0x,dusters,3,Tue Mar 24 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know much at all about Stone.  I know he's a 5-star recruit.  But what's his game like?  Would he be a good fit for Ryan's system?  I.e, can he handle the ball well, does he have the potential for a good outside shot?"
WisconsinBadgers,305g0x,GaryLLLL,2,Tue Mar 24 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"Highlight reel  You can't always tell much from these, but it shows some outside touch. For an 6'11"" 18 year old his handle isn't bad at all, although I'm no scout. He himself seems to feel that he is a Frank Kaminsky-type versatile player."
WisconsinBadgers,305g0x,GaryLLLL,2,Tue Mar 24 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"Sounds good so far.  What's funny, though, is that Frank Kaminsky wasn't a Frank Kaminsky-type player until his junior year :)    I'm just always a bit wary about excessive hype of college recruits.  I remember the crazy hype for Sam Okey and Rashard Griffith.  Meanwhile when Kaminsky signed, no one thought he'd be a future contender for national POY."
WisconsinBadgers,305g0x,nedoma56,2,Tue Mar 24 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"It can be very hit or miss, but Stone has been a top 5-10 in his class nation-wide since he was a freshman. The way all these players travel and compete through AAU ball against top ranked talent makes it a bit more likely that the hype is real.   When Dekker came out of high school as a top 20 recruit, even people in Sheboygan doubted him, because he went to a tiny school and routinely dominated heavily outmatched opponents, not realizing (or at least comprehending) that he was playing with the top players in the state against top players in the country all summer long.  (Speaking of which, I just saw a picture that was posted by JP Tokado's (UNC junior) mom on twitter of Tokado, Dekker, and Bronson Koenig in high school.)  Edit: There were extenuating circumstances with Okey (d-bag, headcase) and Griffith (just a big dummy) that I hope Stone doesn't have."
WisconsinBadgers,305g0x,G0PACKGO,3,Tue Mar 24 21:28:05 2015 UTC,Not to be a spelling Nazi but Tokoto. I know this specifically because I played him once and he put his nuts up on my face and dunked on me. In eighth fucking grade.

WisconsinBadgers,2zzgvz,JillH1995,4,Mon Mar 23 05:46:43 2015 UTC,Refresh my memory here: Why didn't that one count? Was he called for a dbl dribble or traveling or something?
WisconsinBadgers,2zzgvz,BrewCrewKevin,9,Mon Mar 23 16:46:40 2015 UTC,There was a timeout before the ball hit half court. I think they charged a timeout cause someone was injured.
WisconsinBadgers,2zzgvz,PhoenixAvenger,12,Mon Mar 23 16:50:45 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Bo called the timeout. Dekker hit a 3 next possession anyways :D  3>2

He watched them make the Final Four last year, and they're poised for another deep run this year.  They have an incredible streak of tournament appearances.  They have a coach with a proven history of developing big men.   He knows that Kaminsky and Dekker are leaving, and that he'll have a major role from day one."
WisconsinBadgers,2ztnss,GaryLLLL,6,Sun Mar 22 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it may be the academics. I say may because I don't know what his grades or test scores are like. But I'm with you. UW>>>Maryland even with that lose this year and my alum bias."
WisconsinBadgers,2ztnss,my_rug_was_stolen,3,Sat Mar 21 23:35:57 2015 UTC,"My team played against Brookfield Academy in a summer league tournament one time and their coach was talking to our coach and apparently Diamond tried getting into Brookfield Academy and tested horribly. These might just be bad rumors but if you listen to his interviews he sounds like he has a less-than-average IQ, to put it nicely. IMO, Diamond would be a horrible fit at WI. If he does come, I'm sure Bo will do a great job with him but I don't see him ever being a star player at WI. We have extremely smart players and Diamond would just slow everyone else down. I can't pinpoint what it is, but I just don't like Diamond at Wisconsin."
WisconsinBadgers,2ztnss,FeedMyBabyTurtles,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see how any Wisconsin fan wouldn't want him. Look who we have leaving with Frank and probably Dekker, that's a lot of size.  We don't have much to replace that right now and certainly nobody of Diamond's or Frank's size.  The way I see it, if we get Diamond we maintain size on the inside and can keep Vitto off the court which I think we can all agree would be a good thing."

WisconsinBadgers,2zmtz2,Hopalicious,5,Thu Mar 19 23:38:47 2015 UTC,If he doesn't play this weekend can we really trust him to be useful going straight into the sweet 16? That doesn't sound good.
WisconsinBadgers,2zmtz2,pianobadger,5,Fri Mar 20 02:09:39 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure he wants to play.  He said a few days ago he'd be ok not playing the rest of the way and doesn't want to possibly hurt the team.  Doesn't sound confident.  I'd feel bad for him if he goes out like this.
WisconsinBadgers,2zmtz2,themoneybadger,6,Fri Mar 20 02:18:07 2015 UTC,I only respect him more. Putting the team before himself knowing that he'll be rusty? Yea thats a wisconsin player through and through.
WisconsinBadgers,2zmtz2,Puckfan21,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:09:57 2015 UTC,I heard he has the yips.. rather him play tonight and shake the rust off. If he cant get it together then we will just play without him and hope our depth doesnt hurt us.

WisconsinBadgers,2zdk2q,LeSuperNova,16,Tue Mar 17 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"There's nothing I want more than a Badger championship, but it has nothing to do with this stupid article. The author says Wisconsin deserves to be rewarded with a championship more than other teams because:    Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker could have become impatient with this process and become millionaires via the NBA draft last year. But they came back for all the right reasons – a degree and a championship – presumably in that order. It would be nice to provide the ultimate prize for that – a National Championship.   Even worse, apparently we all need to learn that white people can play basketball, too:   Wisconsin is one of the few elite level teams where the majority of the star players and bench players are white. Yet I suspect too many people suffer with an undiagnosed implicit bias that somehow they are less athletic because of it. I hope America gets to see these very talented players defy those myths."
WisconsinBadgers,2zdk2q,fartknucklesandwich,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:11:23 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly agree. Wanting a team to win because they are white is ridiculous.
WisconsinBadgers,2zdk2q,HomeOfTheFreedom,-5,Wed Mar 18 17:43:45 2015 UTC,This is the best written piece on Wisconsin that I have seen this season.  And the auto-inserted Coach stock price index is hilarious.
WisconsinBadgers,2zdk2q,joshuads,13,Tue Mar 17 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I obviously disagree (see my other comment). This piece I read recently is much, much better analysis that actually addresses basketball."
WisconsinBadgers,2zdk2q,fartknucklesandwich,-4,Tue Mar 17 21:24:10 2015 UTC,"His points may be stupid, but it is well written.  Koremenos pieces show promise, but tend to be lack structure and drive.  Forbes obviously is not going to do analysis."

Come back and coach the Badgers?  Makes you wonder about the future of football. How many athletes are never going to enter the sport due to potential injury risks?"

WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,tonny23,8,Tue Mar 17 05:49:20 2015 UTC,"He's smart. He'll land on his feet somewhere. Heck, he could probably get into coaching if he still wants to be involved with football."
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,shtzkrieg,10,Tue Mar 17 03:20:00 2015 UTC,I would highly doubt he gets involved with coaching.  Can't see how a person who quits playing a game because fear of head trauma would be willing to coach the game to others.

WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,PurpleCapybara,0,Tue Mar 17 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"This seemed overly proactive to me. I understand that concussions are a huge deal in the NFL and that it is a scary thought that your career and livelihood can be taken away on any play but his last concussion was 8 years ago. That's 8 full seasons of football he's played since then, one of them being in the NFL. Why now? Good luck to Chris with his future, but I feel like he might regret this decision. Just my opinion."
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,FeedMyBabyTurtles,10,Tue Mar 17 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"That is 8 years that we know about. Who knows how many undiagnosed/unreported head injuries he has had or even how many little micro-injuries that don't even show up with symptoms he has had. It does seem to be a bit extreme, but he knows his situation much better than any of us do."
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,evilcheeba,2,Tue Mar 17 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"Valid point. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure he spent a lot of time and energy thinking about this situation. I hope this decision makes other athletes who are in more serious situations with more recent concussions step back and think about their priorities. Think there's any chance he comes back and helps Cryst?"
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,FeedMyBabyTurtles,6,Tue Mar 17 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no chance he helps Chryst.  Why would he retire from football, but yet somehow be okay with coaching a dangerous game that he retired to coach others? That would make absolutely zero sense to me."
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,Herpesdeep,2,Tue Mar 17 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I would be all for it. Hard working dude and smart.   And who knows, he very well may regret his decision, but I think that will pass. I'm sure this wasn't just a snap decision, and if worse comes to worse I'm sure he could change his mind in the next couple years. Someone will give him a shot if he wants it."
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,evilcheeba,5,Tue Mar 17 03:09:47 2015 UTC,"To hear him tell it, he got a concussion during training camp this year and played through it to make the team. He definitely might regret it, because the way he was playing, he might have been able to parlay another 4-6 years into more money than he could ever hope to spend, but I definitely have respect for a guy who can look at that as an option and choose his health instead. Very sobering story."
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,junkspot91,3,Tue Mar 17 04:05:49 2015 UTC,"Brain trauma isn't just caused by concussions. CTE(Chronic Traumatic  Encephalopathy) is believed(in football players) to be caused by the constant banging that happens everyday in practices and games. You can have players who never had a concussion suffer from CTE.  I think he might feel some regret come fall, but honestly it's the right choice."
WisconsinBadgers,2zb1wx,snackshack,3,Tue Mar 17 11:20:19 2015 UTC,This is the part that most people don't understand and where the true threat to the ongoing existance of the game is.  Even the sub-concussive hits seem to cause lasting damage to the brain.  In other words Football is inherintly bad for your brain and no amount of rules changes or equipment advances will change that.

WisconsinBadgers,2z5bzy,imtylerdurden,6,Sun Mar 15 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"I know this is a highlight reel, but that's a hell of an arm.  Hopefully we'll have some successful qbs, so we can draw wide receivers in the near future."
WisconsinBadgers,2z5bzy,s54b32dd,4,Sun Mar 15 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"We are going to have a lot of QBs! Always good to have one or two in each class, I like this guy from what I have read on him."
WisconsinBadgers,2z5bzy,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Sun Mar 15 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"I like his arm, and pretty good accuracy too.  Surely those will only improve with good coaching here.  His highlight reel is full of him staring down his receiver, and except for a few scrambles, he never needs to throw off of his first read.  Not that I would expect any different from a good high school quarterback with wide receivers that can get open, but it's just an observation I had."
WisconsinBadgers,2z5bzy,3p1cw1n,2,Sun Mar 15 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"I played football with both Karé and his brother Kayden here in Madison, the year before they moved to AZ.   Karé is extremely talented and has a great work ethic. I think he has great potential, and could fit in really well with our system.  Kayden is a straight up powerhouse. He's a year younger than Karé, but was playing up with us. He was pushing around the biggest guys we faced, with ease.   Assuming they both continue to develop (and assuming Kayden commits to the UW), these two guys could be huge assets to our team."
WisconsinBadgers,2z5bzy,HockeyBoss1788,2,Sun Mar 15 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"The family was in the UW Bookstore today, all are good folks. Can confirm, Kayden is one hell of a powerhouse for a 15 year old. Here's hoping both have 4 strong years playing at Camp Randall"

We just really need another floor general who can maintain a game flow when some of our less talented players need to give the stars a rest"
WisconsinBadgers,2yymca,jpopelka,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty slim chance he gets significant playing time, but it'll be nice to have another option. If I were Bo, I'd be pretty hesitiant to plug him back in. Koenig had been doing a bang-up job as a replacement, and the team has good chemistry with the current lineup. But if we can get him a few minutes and see how it goes, that wouldn't hurt.   Especially in the CoCarolina game, where it should be a breeze- it'd be nice to try and work him back in quite a bit."

It's possible that Wisconsin looks the worst out of everyone because there's something about the large red block letters and the motion W that doesn't work well with this whole format.   Also, worth noting that it looks much worse in these floor level photos than it does from above on camera during the broadcast, at least for Kansas and Louisville. I liked the way they looked on screen, but it does play less well in these photos. I think because that belt gets smaller from the perspective above the court."

We all knew that he would be the favorite going in but there are three guys I can realistically see taking it from him. Only time will tell. However, his experience will serve us well against Bama, who are losing a huge amount of starters on both sides of the ball. An improved Stave could be huge for us pulling the upset there."
WisconsinBadgers,2y6hg4,Kobe_AYEEEEE,-1,Sat Mar 7 16:10:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah no. Bama is a better team, and stave's ""experience"" will not do us any good. The only thing he can do is hand off the ball."

How can  they evaluate the freshman quarterbacks without seeing them compete head to head with Stave?   I'll wait till the first week of practice to be done and if Stave is still the front runner, then I'll be concerned."
WisconsinBadgers,2y6hg4,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,4,Sat Mar 7 08:36:54 2015 UTC,"If Stave is the front-runner, it's because he's playing better.  At some point, we all have to trust the coaches.  I'm sure they want to win games too, and I'd be more worried about them sending in a QB who hasn't fully developed just to have his confidence destroyed by Alabama.  Let the coaches coach.  If Stave is the starter on day 1, so be it."
WisconsinBadgers,2y6hg4,Tuggernuts23,3,Sat Mar 7 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Except you can't say Stave is playing better because they haven't started Spring practice. In addition we have a new head coach and offensive coordinator who likely evaluate quarterbacks differently than they previous coaching staff.  I'm just saying it's an obvious statement that he's front runner because he as starter last year. It doesn't mean he will be front runner 2 days into Spring practice, so in my opinion this article is worthless. Especially since we have 3 new QBs available to the team that weren't here last season. I mean Kafentzis could be the second coming of Wilson which would make him the front runner, but since he hasn't taken a snap in practice we don't know, so this speculation is pointless."
WisconsinBadgers,2y6hg4,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,3,Sat Mar 7 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"Right, and I agree with all the points you're making with the exception of   wait till the first week of practice to be done and if Stave is still the front runner, then I'll be concerned   Trust the coaches and their systems.  If Stave makes more sense, is more comfortable, makes better decisions because he remembers more of Chrysts offense, so be it.  Don't be concerned until Stave is starting game 3 after throwing 100 interceptions.  If he's playing well, let him play well."
WisconsinBadgers,2y6hg4,Tuggernuts23,2,Sat Mar 7 17:57:03 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic in Chryst's ability to coach and develop a Quarterback, but after 2 years of watching him play I think he's nearly reached his ceiling. At most he can improve consistency and decision making, but I can't see him suddenly being able to hit the deep ball or hit players in the flat on an out route. These are all things that he's struggled with the past 2 seasons. And it's not like Andersen couldn't develop good quarterbacks. In his time at Utah St he coached one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in Chuckie Keaton.  The reason I'll be concerned is that we have 7 other options at quarterback and if none of them can step up and challenge Stave there could be problems even looking past this year. Also, I'd be just as concerned trotting Stave as I would a true freshman, like you pointed out a large problem with a game has been confidence and playing a Bama defense usually isn't the best thing to help a struggling quarterbacks confidence issues haha."

He came to my house and my family loved him. He really spoke highly of the education available at Wisconsin and the success of the athletic program and it was something he believed in. One thing I really enjoyed about him was how easy he was to talk to both on and off the field. He's a great fit for the university and I'm really excited to see that he's coming back.""  John Clay (2008-10) ""What I remember most about Coach Settle is that he treated us all like men. He didn't babysit us but he held us accountable for making the right choices on and off the field. He was almost like a father figure to us that way. When he was recruiting me, I remember him coming to my high school, watching my track meets and he had a great charisma that would just make everyone around him smile. When he was looking at some other jobs, I remember telling him that if he left, I was going to leave too because I didn't want to be coached by anyone else. That was how much I believed in him as a coach.""  Bradie Ewing (2008-11) ""Coach Settle played a key role in my choice to attend the University of Wisconsin. He has always demonstrated that he is a great man of character and faith, along with what he can do as a football coach with his teaching ability and proven development of his players. Through my years with Coach Settle, he grew into someone I looked up to on and off the field for advice and guidance. He is a great fit for Wisconsin and it will be good to see him back on the Badgers' sideline again!""  James White (2010-13) ""Coach Settle was definitely a big reason why I chose Wisconsin. When he was in my house, he felt like a part of the family. He was very personable and down to earth. I had seen what he had done with guys like P.J. Hill, John Clay and Montee and knew he was a great coach. He's very demanding on the field and expects the most out of his players. In my opinion, he's the best fit for the job.""  http://www.uwbadgers.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/030315aaa.html"
WisconsinBadgers,2xfmvz,GaryLLLL,0,Tue Mar 3 22:39:38 2015 UTC,"When Jeff Potrykus initially tweeted this news, he said something sarcastic that implied many fans would hate this news.   How come?  I honestly don't remember anything about Settle from his first time here, good or bad."
WisconsinBadgers,2xfmvz,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,2,Sat Feb 28 23:54:50 2015 UTC,"He was a decent coach but is a horrible recruiter. As in he almost literally doesn't recruit. In his time here the only player he was able to bring in was Kenzel Doe. So when compared to Brown who was a great recruiter, the news is a little disappointing.  Some are also mad that he had Ball play 3rd string for the majority of the year in 2011, until injuries forced him into the lineup. However, Ball had played pretty poorly in his appearances before that point."
WisconsinBadgers,2xfmvz,GaryLLLL,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"How do people even know which coaches recruit which player?  Like whenever I see news that a particular player committed, it doesn't say which coach was involved."
WisconsinBadgers,2xfmvz,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,2,Sun Mar 1 01:03:42 2015 UTC,Where do you get your information on recruiting? On 24/7 they usually list who the main recruiter for a player is along with which coaches are making in home visits.
WisconsinBadgers,2xfmvz,GaryLLLL,0,Sun Mar 1 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know, Journal-Sentinel, TV…I guess I'm not nearly into the minutae as some people.  Thus my original question on what's wrong with Settle.  I'll admit I haven't heard of 24/7."

WisconsinBadgers,2xe6j7,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Sat Feb 28 02:32:43 2015 UTC,Yes love is back but aside from that jet sweep TD against LSU what did he do? Abraderris ran it pretty well too if I remember correctly.  I still think Stevenson could run it really well. Watch his game film. He gets in space and is gone.

It would be hard for a starter's first game to be against Alabama at a site that's a lot closer to Alabama than it is to Wisconsin.

This is more of an upper-ass stripe.  Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), several other schools were given the exact same design."

The ""gross"" and ""omg wtf"" hockey unis aren't pretty, but they're not as bad as the random two-tone of the shorts, imo. Seriously, those Adidas unis are incredibly fucking ugly. It's like wearing a regular uniform, then painting a stripe across your balls. It's not original, and it doesn't look good."
WisconsinBadgers,2x9rmu,UncharminglyWitty,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:42:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree with ""miles better"". They changed one thing. And it is a horrendous change.  At least with the camos they had some pretty good looking ones. They just rolled too many out so schools that it didn't really fit had to wear them. I thought it fit with Baylor and Cinci pretty well, maybe Louisville.  UCLA and Kansas were an absolute mistake with those."
WisconsinBadgers,2x9rmu,Jewtheist,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"I don't like two-tone shorts but I do like that they're going for something different. Last year's tourney unis were real nice but a little too subtle to really get excited about. These are in the right direction, because I love clean stripes, even if two-tone shorts are generally not great. They'll get to the promised land eventually (I hope)."
WisconsinBadgers,2x5e3o,Indecisive_Name,18,Wed Feb 25 20:16:49 2015 UTC,The Old Fashioned is a great restaurant.It serves classic Wisconsin food right on the capital square in Madison. Get the cheese curds they are amazing.   Ian's Pizza is another Madison classic. A unique pizza joint with lots of interesting pizza flavors. I am partial to the Mac and Cheese pizza but all their stuff is pretty great.  Mickey's Dairy Bar is another awesome Madison place. It is right next to the stadium and is home of the hangover in Madison. It serves diner style food and is always packed although it is only open for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast is always great there.
WisconsinBadgers,2x5e3o,Evanders_Ear,3,Wed Feb 25 21:03:00 2015 UTC,Second. Three of my favorite spots in the city.

For nightlife. the Kollege Klub is where all the greek life goes, but any of the bars on/near state street are good too."
WisconsinBadgers,2x5e3o,themoneybadger,2,Wed Feb 25 23:57:52 2015 UTC,A smokey with a mac and cheese is my favorite to get from Ian's. I've spent way to much money there at around 1 in the morning.
WisconsinBadgers,2x5e3o,Monty20,-1,Thu Feb 26 04:54:49 2015 UTC,Go to the Old Fashioned if you want to wait an hr plus for a table. Want a spot at the bar for 3? Be prepared to hover like a hawk for a spot.  Good food but nothing worth the definite wait.

For breakfast go to Mickey's which is right by Camp Randall. If you try eating there on gameday you gotta be there as soon as the place opens otherwise there is no way you'll get a seat. They don't take reservations. On gameday, there's a lot of partying near Camp Randall on Regent Street but I would recommend bouncing around campus to take a look at all the house parties. More than welcome people will welcome you over to join them and get you beer drunk. We really, really like drinking. With out week non-conference home schedule we all will be pretttttty drunk for those games. My favorite dinner restaurants are the Old Fashioned, but try the Nitty Gritty which is a campus staple."

WisconsinBadgers,2x32dh,JillH1995,8,Wed Feb 25 06:01:50 2015 UTC,"His Twitter feed is just full of love for Wisconsin, even after the RB coach who recruited him left. He got a scholarship offer from Alabama after he committed to UW, and he was basically like thanks, but no thanks. Oh, and we don't have to worry about academics with him.  He's also a fan of /u/Tarken13's black out uniform concept, for what it's worth. Most of the young recruits would love a black out uniform."
WisconsinBadgers,2x32dh,Tuggernuts23,5,Wed Feb 25 06:13:05 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that he had taken a visit to Alabama, and I don't blame him.  Thomas Brown was apparently really good at his job, and it has to be more than a little shocking when someone you're looking forward to working with leaves.  Most people on here thought he was for sure gone.  That all being said, I'm super excited he's not.  I remember after we got walloped by OSU in the B1G championship, he was one of the first to tweet, telling everyone to calm down, and that the future is still bright.  I think it's a large testament to Wisconsin that we can have all the coaching turmoil in the world, but our recruits still come here.  It really is a great school/city/tradition.  edit: Apparently he cancelled his trip to Alabama.  This kid has some sort of passion for Wisconsin. Gets me excited."

WisconsinBadgers,2x2ebn,crunchy_nipples,3,Wed Feb 25 06:38:30 2015 UTC,It was definitely impacted by the students being right behind the announcers and their yelling being picked up by the microphones. I wouldn't be surprised if that got changed in the future (students sitting behind the announcers) because I think the TV networks would be subject to fines for airing profanity.
WisconsinBadgers,2x2ebn,JillH1995,2,Wed Feb 25 05:54:02 2015 UTC,Figured so. I've had to turn off more than one Brewers broadcast because hecklers were beneath the booth.
WisconsinBadgers,2x2ebn,tbe170,2,Wed Feb 25 12:18:41 2015 UTC,"If Gonzaga loses just one more game, they're probably a solid 2.  Virginia is battling injuries now.  Duke is walking a tight rope with 3 losses, but their head-to-head win against us helps.  If we win out, I still think there's a good chance we'll be a 1 seed.  I don't know what's up with Villanova or Arizona though."

WisconsinBadgers,2vwcic,gogowisco,2,Sun Feb 15 03:03:43 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Imo they need to go back to the symmetric classic block W. Glad to see I'm not the only one!
WisconsinBadgers,2vwcic,Jewtheist,3,Sun Feb 15 04:06:32 2015 UTC,I'll always ride for the block W. It just looks better than the motion. It's because of the motion part--that black shading turns me off of it.  (The shading is the motion right? Or is it just the whole design?)
WisconsinBadgers,2vwcic,wiscowonder,3,Sun Feb 15 06:11:32 2015 UTC,"It's the whole design being skewed to the right that creates the ""motion"". The completely opaque drop shadow does nothing to elevate the design either.   As I said earlier, it just screams 90s design standards."

I don't like adding black to sports color schemes when there are already two non-neutral colors (i.e. the Packers or the Gophers don't need to add black). But when a team only has one other color, I think it's fine to use black and white."
WisconsinBadgers,2vwcic,wiscowonder,-1,Sun Feb 15 21:24:49 2015 UTC,"The motion w could easily be phased out by introducing the block w  more and more over a series of ""x"" years - mind you, it's an older symbol than the motion w .  It would be such a easy and smooth transition people would hardly notice. Also, not sure what you're referring to in terms of a touch of black, but I'm assuming you're referring to the drop shadow.  From a design standpoint it's tacky1.   1 Source: Employed as a graphic designer."
WisconsinBadgers,2vwcic,JillH1995,2,Sun Feb 15 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anything design-related it subjective. I like the drop shadow. Just because you're a graphic designer doesn't mean you're the be-all, end-all of design. The motion W is unique to Wisconsin. Everyone else has a block letter. If the UW went back to a block W, it wouldn't be much different than the upside down M we use as a downvote or the W used by Washington.  The only way I would ever care to see the W changed would be if Bucky became our main logo. We don't need a block letter that looks like every other college's."

WisconsinBadgers,2vrqbu,Sonoma2002,3,Fri Feb 13 17:13:46 2015 UTC,I've been to U of I a few times. Living 'near' the school means you must be literally in the middle of nowhere. God bless you for representing UW down there.

WisconsinBadgers,2vpjo9,LeSuperNova,5,Fri Feb 13 00:00:43 2015 UTC,These last two years have really helped recruiting.  It's nice to be seen as a powerhouse basketball school and get some bigger recruits come to WI.
WisconsinBadgers,2vpjo9,b4dger,3,Fri Feb 13 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"I was so confused reading this as a football recruiting class. ""I could swear NSD was just last week."""
WisconsinBadgers,2vpjo9,thedude388,2,Fri Feb 13 15:10:09 2015 UTC,It would be nice to land Stone but after watching him the last few years he honestly feels like an over hyped player who will underachieve at the college level. I know Bo and his team can develop players but this kid has Smokey Okie/Evan Anderson written all over him. If we land him I hope I am wrong and he is the best Badger ever. Regardless I would be happier if we found a player with solid potential and a great team personality that we could develop over a few years rather than shoot for some bullshit top recruiting class ranking.
WisconsinBadgers,2vpjo9,jakevv,2,Fri Feb 13 05:00:52 2015 UTC,"Stone is so interesting to me. I go back and forth on whether I think he's actually that athletic. In comparison to Iverson (which is in all honestly a poor comparison) he doesn't look that athletic. Iverson looks like a freak to me and looks to be a bigger impact immediately, imo. Stone has the frame to pack on like 30 pounds easy and be a total monster but who knows who he's modeling his game after (I haven't watched enough tape). The kid grew up watching KD and not Shaq. Personally I'd rather have a shaq but if he's effective being more akin to KD who am I to say anything. I imagine Bo's style lends itself to playing more like KD anyway. I have no idea. I hope we get him for his name alone."
WisconsinBadgers,2vpjo9,wackywiener,1 point,Fri Feb 13 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Diamond is going to be better than Frank ever in his career, but I haven't watched highlights that much. Iverson is extremely exciting and could replace Dekker in the starting lineup if he leaves. If Dekker comes back and Stone is our last commit, we could be a title contender for the third consecutive year, if the recruits can play well, that is."
WisconsinBadgers,2vp90s,wazze100,6,Thu Feb 12 22:37:20 2015 UTC,Yoooo. The video of that block and one-man fastbreak dunk though. No regard for human life. If Stone comes too the future will be crazy bright.

WisconsinBadgers,2v1uu1,smiles134,4,Sat Feb 7 02:33:36 2015 UTC,It's hilariously heartbreaking to follow the Wisconsin Hockey Twitter page as they excitedly announce the Badgers have a 3rd period lead every few games before inevitably they have to meekly tweet about the other team scoring 5 goals in the last two minutes to lose yet again.
WisconsinBadgers,2v1uu1,Jewtheist,2,Sat Feb 7 03:13:49 2015 UTC,Eaves has gotta go.

WisconsinBadgers,2v1uu1,MasterLink87,2,Sat Feb 7 09:14:00 2015 UTC,"Every once in a while, I see flashes of why this team was picked by the media to finish 3rd in the Big Ten despite the massive roster turnover. Some of the freshmen have made strides since the holiday break (especially Hughes, who was a highly-regarded prospect but came in as a 17-year-old). That doesn't change that this season is historically bad. At least each loss stings less (diminishing return of disappointment to scale, or something like that).  I'm glad the women's team is very good this year. I've seen some exciting games at LaBahn this year, and more than just 2 where the team in Wisconsin uniforms wins!"

And as soon as we give up those leads, the score gets out of hand very quickly. Like a 2-1 lead becomes 5-2. 3-2 becomes 7-5, etc. I'm not saying the team is giving up or that they have simply tuned Eaves out.  But it kinda looks that way.

I guess it's tough when white is one of your main colors because white is the best third color (for me), but black just doesn't fit in well. It's just kinda lazily tacked on as a facemask color or sock color or undershirt color or helmet stripe color. I'd rather just have a bunch of red and white stripes.   Like I made this once and while it's (allegedly) a little overboard with the stripes, something old school like that I'd enjoy."

WisconsinBadgers,2uw5mi,85mayne,3,Fri Feb 6 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's phenomenal. Very Darth Vaderish.

WisconsinBadgers,2u8gkk,BarkMingo,7,Fri Jan 30 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Eaves needs to go. He has never once won a WCHA or B1G season title. Sure he has won the WCHA and B1G tourney, but never a regular season title. His record for an elite hockey program is borderline abysmal. He is somewhere around 55% all time. He loses just as many players and UM, ND, BU etc yet we seem to have the massive 4 year swings, this year being glaring. He has lost this team, and I'm not sure why anyone who has followed Badger Hockey for a long time is still sticking with Eaves. Is it because he is from our own program? We as fans need to get over this ""Wisconsin Man"" thing and just hire someone who gives us the best chance at success."
WisconsinBadgers,2u8gkk,BuckyCop,4,Fri Jan 30 22:45:26 2015 UTC,What about the 2006 National Championship?
WisconsinBadgers,2u8gkk,hexcentric254,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, no doubt he had a great tourney run and a good team that year, but he still didn't win the WCHA (tied for 2nd). Now, obviously we won the ultimate prize that year, but what since then? Being absolutely demolished in the 2010 Champ game?   Let's say 2006 was an outlier and so is this year, it doesn't change Eaves' terrible winning percentage, his tournament appearance record is terrible compared to Hakstoll and Lucia. Eaves' true colors are being showed this year, the players are lost."
WisconsinBadgers,2u8gkk,BuckyCop,2,Sat Jan 31 16:28:26 2015 UTC,Not to mention all of the in-state recruits he doesn't get anymore.
WisconsinBadgers,2u8gkk,BarkMingo,2,Sat Jan 31 00:42:21 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the team will be more resigned to their fate than energized. Still, I hope I'm wrong."
WisconsinBadgers,2u8gkk,12rjc12,2,Fri Jan 30 21:06:11 2015 UTC,"Eaves has clearly lost the team. Calling out the team in the media is not the way to light a fire under these guys. It is time for a change! The PP has been shit for as long as I can remember and Eaves refuses to change. As for last nights game, why leave Rumpel in there after giving up 4 goals in 1:40? Granted the D spent way too much time gliding around watching but that could affect Rumpel for a long time. I am also sick of hearing Eaves blame the current woes on how many kids leave early, it happens to every decent team. Adapt or GTFO!!"

Yeah...I want more of that and less of what we saw for most of that weekend. But hey, it's 2 unranked teams, so it should be an even matchup, right? :) There should be some extra intensity tonight. I hope so, anyway.  I'm excited because I'm always excited to go to games, but I think it's fair to say that this is one of the least anticipated Minnesota-Wisconsin matchups in years. (To be fair, it's usually extremely anticipated.)"

WisconsinBadgers,2txm71,wazze100,3,Wed Jan 28 05:28:03 2015 UTC,We need all the competition/help we can get in that department. Punting is one of those issues you don't realize can be catastrophic until you average 20 yards per punt (or use a heralded 5* QB recruit as an Aussie style punter and even that won't help the issue)
WisconsinBadgers,2txm71,Brucho,2,Wed Jan 28 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"Anyone that needs a lesson on what an awesome punter can do for your team, check out Alabama's in the championship game.  Dang."
WisconsinBadgers,2txm71,PurpleCapybara,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced the only reason Houston was punting last year was cause he was messing around in practice when a coach saw him and was like, hey, we could improve the punt game, and he went along with it cause he wanted to actually get on the field."

The fact of the matter is, while UW is by no means the worst offender when it comes to making college a joke for NCAA athletes, I've heard horror stories from tutors: either the athlete just had their tutor do all their work for them, or the athlete was so far behind expectations that the tutor had to do all their work for them, or the athlete managed to take just enough Care for Companion Animals and History of Leisure courses to float a bizarre, meaningless transcript that nonetheless maintained their eligibility.  Still an elite public university, but let's not pretend that all our NCAA athletes are Dean's list material...just like every successful college program, we fudge it a little.  Clearly, we don't fudge it enough for Andersen's liking."

WisconsinBadgers,2t8j03,UncharminglyWitty,2,Thu Jan 22 05:12:25 2015 UTC,No way the pats draft him. They would never take him in the first or second. They have a dozen backs and it doesn't matter which one plays.

WisconsinBadgers,2sl4xo,drsingerx,-3,Fri Jan 16 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"Nice try, but corn is actually a grain that can be served as a vegetable (vegetable again being a culinary term, not scientific - same with tomatoes both being fruits and vegetables at the same time). There's no ""one corn is a vegetable and one corn is a grain"" nonsense, and if you had bothered to read one more line into the article you linked it even states ""There is a reason why corn [Zea mays] is the most-produced grain worldwide"""
WisconsinBadgers,2sl4xo,inkysunset,9,Fri Jan 16 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"No. The scientific term (via botanists) for corn [Zea mays] would be a caryopsis (a dry fruit), since it comes from the reproductive part of the plant. Dry fruits are commonly called grains. The word vegetable is literally defined as a plant cultivated for a part to be eaten, like the seeds/fruit in corn.

And every team rosters five to six quarterbacks, this isn't the pros where you go with only two or three.   Six quarterbacks on a college team bordering 100 is normal, not a lot. Only the three of Stave, Gillins and Houston are going to be in the actual competition, not all six. Two will redshirt and one (if he's even here) will have to sit out a year. There's more than enough reps for five or six quarterbacks on a college roster, and only three are actually in the competition."

The most disappointing part was not being able to stay in front of them and letting up drive after drive to the bucket.   As soon as they hit a few of those shots and dunked on consecutive possessions to trim the lead to 5, it was like a flip switched where the entire crowd and the entire team realized they could win, and Wisconsin just played the role of the overwhelmed favorite to perfection. Couldn't get to the rim the entire second half either, or hit a three or even a foul shot.   Sad performance. I grew up watching Rutgers at the RAC so I'm happy for them at least.

O’Korn, a three-star member of the Cougars’ 2013 recruiting class, passed for 3,117 yards and 28 touchdowns in being named the AAC’s 2013 Rookie of the Year.  After starting the first five games of the 2014 season, however, he lost his starting job to Greg Ward Jr.  He threw eight interceptions in 173 pass attempts this season after throwing 10 in 446 throws last year."

WisconsinBadgers,2s3l5b,Hopalicious,5,Mon Jan 12 15:29:52 2015 UTC,O'Korn... O'Brien... likes to throw interceptions...  I think we should stick with Gillens/Kafentzis for the future.
WisconsinBadgers,2s3l5b,Jewtheist,2,Mon Jan 12 17:13:58 2015 UTC,Yes this.  Enough with the transfers.  We already have QBs would are experts in throwing interception.

WisconsinBadgers,2r1ke6,tonny23,4,Fri Jan 2 07:46:33 2015 UTC,Or the Bears. Or the Vikings.
WisconsinBadgers,2r1ke6,s54b32dd,2,Fri Jan 2 08:01:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like Vikings are most likely of the NFC North.  Detroit will most likely be too late in the first round (unless they trade up, but that doesn't make much sense); the Bears still have Forte, and I think they'll work to shore up their lines in the early rounds. The Packers have no need for an RB with the way Lacy has been running.  A lot of draft experts have Gordon going to the Chargers, which I'm not sure I understand; he'd have to pass block and work as a check-down there, which we didn't see much of in college; that would be a big question mark for the Chargers to take first-round risk on."

WisconsinBadgers,2r1ke6,Sonoma2002,1 point,Fri Jan 2 22:53:23 2015 UTC,Worse than Cleveland? Worse than NYJ or the Steelers? We finished the year in our away jerseys which leads me to believe we might get a uniform revamp.

WisconsinBadgers,2r1ke6,s54b32dd,2,Fri Jan 2 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"So do you think the Seahawks will trade up, or he'll fall to late first round?  I think the Ravens will take him. They have imminent need after the departure of Ray Rice, and they fall in the 12-22 draft order sweet spot most people think Gordon will fall to."
WisconsinBadgers,2r1ke6,byubadger,1 point,Fri Jan 2 20:28:00 2015 UTC,He would be a great 1-2 punch with Forsett. All I know is I'll be looking to pick him up in fantasy next year.

WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,jkzebrafish,3,Thu Jan 1 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"Like him or not (I have a lot of issues with him), but he was 8-1 as a starter this year.  It's really hard to argue with success."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,b4dger,4,Fri Jan 2 04:42:08 2015 UTC,...did he not start both the NW and OSU games?
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,BarkMingo,1 point,Fri Jan 2 08:54:17 2015 UTC,"McEvoy started the Northwestern game and Stave finished it. Stave was indeed the starter for the championship game against OSU, though."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,HockeyBoss1788,5,Fri Jan 2 15:44:35 2015 UTC,"Won in spite of the quarterback.  Not the best kind of win, but a win none the less."

WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,Jdog2010,9,Thu Jan 1 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  This was far from Stave's best day, but the Badgers don't make it to OT without him making some throws at the end of regulation.    Maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but I'm curious to see what he can do next year with Chryst and a new coaching staff in Madison.  I wasn't a fan of Ludwig's playcalling at all, and also had my doubts that he could be an effective QB coach.  I don't know if Stave starts next year, but it's possible that he ends up looking a lot better with the new coaching staff."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,SomeGuyNamedGabbo,7,Fri Jan 2 02:20:59 2015 UTC,but the Badgers don't make it to OT without him making some throws at the end of regulation.   There should have been no need for OT. We would have beaten them by a couple of scores if Stave doesn't throw all those picks.
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,powerboy20,4,Fri Jan 2 08:47:51 2015 UTC,Gillins or Kafentzis better be starting at QB next year
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,wazze100,1 point,Thu Jan 1 20:50:17 2015 UTC,I found it odd that I never saw Gillians on the sideline during the game.  I saw all the rest of the backup QBs.  Even saw Twain Deal a few times.
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,Hopalicious,3,Thu Jan 1 22:34:18 2015 UTC,Looking at his twitter (https://twitter.com/blessedwhereiam) it appears he was at the game. I didn't see him either but I wasn't really looking
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,wazze100,3,Thu Jan 1 22:36:49 2015 UTC,I saw him.  He was there and suited up.
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,ValuePick,1 point,Fri Jan 2 03:20:06 2015 UTC,Great. I thought he might have been in the Alveraz dog house.
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,Hopalicious,5,Fri Jan 2 03:37:33 2015 UTC,"Let's keep in mind that this is just a kid we're talking about. A kid that may read this board, or have friends that read this board.  Let us just thank him for the games that he has helped us win rather than bitching about the bad plays."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,Dawg1shly,5,Fri Jan 2 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"We're not going to sugar coat it just to avoid hurting his feelings. He makes stupid decisions, there has got to be a better option."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,smiles134,-9,Fri Jan 2 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"What did you expect from this season? To play for the national championship?   You could definitely make the argument that Stave lost us the game vs. Northwestern, which had little bearing on our season as we still made the B1G title game. The whole team fuct off the title game though, so not going to put that just on him.   So yeah he is not the best QB we've ever had, but we had a damn good season at 11-3. He is responsible for a fairly meaningless loss to NWU, but we likely would've lost to Minnesota without him. So I just think he was kind of not worthy of a lot of praise or criticism."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,Dawg1shly,6,Fri Jan 2 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"Stave makes bad choices. Plain and simple. He came up big in this game at the end, but he also threw three interceptions in opponent territory. You just can't do that."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,smiles134,0,Fri Jan 2 06:09:04 2015 UTC,"I put the bad decisions on the play caller. We're averaging over 7 ypc on rushes. Why would you dial up a pass play? Stave can hand the ball all day IMO. That said, I really hope for a good QB soon."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,byubadger,11,Thu Jan 1 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"I would love to agree with this statement 100%, however, if you only run the ball they will throw 8 maybe even 9 guys in the box and stop the run. I hated watching Stave throw the ball but you have to keep the defense on their heels some how."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,krabtree1525,3,Thu Jan 1 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"Throw sometimes?  Of course.  Absolutely necessary.  The pass plays should be designed for Stave's skill set though.  He has no business throwing the ball long down the field (frankly, we don't have good receivers for this either).  Tight ends, short passes out of play action to receivers.  Stuff where you can throw an incomplete pass and you move on to the next down.  Airing it up into double, triple coverage is bad play calling and bad coaching."
WisconsinBadgers,2r0zjn,armyofapes,2,Sun Jan 4 05:16:54 2015 UTC,"Again, if you are going to throw short passes, the opposing team will just push everyone to the line of scrimmage. As an offense you need to stretch their defense to make room for the running back. I hate Stave as much as every other Wisconsin fan, but I have to respect the passing game to stretch defenses to make room for Clement. Also, have an upvote because I know where your head is at and I want to just run to ball all game too."
WisconsinBadgers,2r1qj5,the-mp,10,Thu Jan 1 23:39:09 2015 UTC,"Just straight up next level talent-wise, I can't think of another player that matches up with Gordon. I obviously have never seen guys like Crazylegs Hirsch, Alan Ameche, or even a guy like Pat Richter play, but of the players since the late 80's I would rank him at the top.  College football accolades-wise, that distinction still goes to Ron Dayne. Heisman award winner, most career yards ever, and he was just an unstoppable force in college football. His talent didn't translate to the NFL, unfortunately, but there is no denying that he is one of the best RBs in college football history.   Obviously there are other players from other positions like Mike Webster, JJ Watt, Joe Thomas, Jamar Fletcher, Troy Vincent, and several others that were great players as well. All were great college players and achieved at least some success in the pros. I can't remember any other time when so many players that played for the Badgers were all enjoying such success in the NFL.   In the end, it is very difficult to compare different positions and different eras, but I personally would put Melvin Gordon right up there with the best players to suit up for Wisconsin."
WisconsinBadgers,2r1qj5,evilcheeba,2,Fri Jan 2 00:33:38 2015 UTC,"I don't like ""best ever"" because it leaves out so many other greats. Now, is he great? Damn fuckin skippy!"
WisconsinBadgers,2r1qj5,dainomite,6,Fri Jan 2 22:44:19 2015 UTC,It depends on how you define 'great'  I really like JJ Watt's story of walking on at Wisconsin (after transferring back to be closer to home) and now being in the same conversation as Aaron Rogers for MVP

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

That is how I'd put it on my resume if I was Ludwig, for sure.   Now, the question is, what would you wanna see out of a new coordinator?"
WisconsinBadgers,2qr4em,Jewtheist,3,Mon Dec 29 22:39:15 2014 UTC,Chryst called plays for Brett B.
WisconsinBadgers,2qr4em,Short_Bus_,2,Mon Dec 29 22:53:20 2014 UTC,"It's very hard to call plays while head coaching. He could do it but I think he should outsource it and just weigh in with his thoughts from time to time. He liked calling games from the booth, preferably sipping a beer so calling from the sideline is not his comfort zone."
WisconsinBadgers,2qr4em,UncharminglyWitty,3,Tue Dec 30 04:35:47 2014 UTC,This has actually taken turns for the best. Let's hope for a great bowl showing!
WisconsinBadgers,2qaj0k,dainomite,10,Wed Dec 24 17:18:23 2014 UTC,Chad and Woods were good recruiters.  Let's hope Chryst's crew can keep it up.

WisconsinBadgers,2qaj0k,smiles134,5,Wed Dec 24 23:21:28 2014 UTC,Guess the Badgers have to take matters into their own hands
WisconsinBadgers,2qaj0k,Kobe_AYEEEEE,3,Thu Dec 25 01:07:56 2014 UTC,So wait... Aranda. Is he staying or did he go?
WisconsinBadgers,2qaj0k,the-mp,6,Thu Dec 25 01:36:59 2014 UTC,From what I've seen Aranda is staying.
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,wazze100,8,Tue Dec 23 23:56:56 2014 UTC,The fact that we've lost zero recruits with Andersen leaving has to be a sign that he wasn't that great.
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Jewtheist,12,Wed Dec 24 00:53:06 2014 UTC,"I was expecting some to decommit immediately when  he left and some more when Chryst was hired, as that is usually how it works with the whole coaching situation. Nope, we have actually gained 1 (2 if you count the walk on). Aranda staying is really big allowing us to keep those  LBs coming in."
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Kobe_AYEEEEE,8,Wed Dec 24 01:03:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah if the whole staff left, admittedly, that would've been a big blow."
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Jewtheist,7,Wed Dec 24 01:15:18 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I disagree.  I don't remember which coach the quote is credited too, but when they were recruiting, they'd sell the recruits on the School/Tradition more than the coaches.  Too me, that implies that all of the coaches did a pretty good job, Andersen included."
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Tuggernuts23,5,Wed Dec 24 16:35:31 2014 UTC,"Good point. Clearly, no kids were coming to Wisconsin for Andersen, but maybe that's by his design."
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Jewtheist,11,Wed Dec 24 17:19:57 2014 UTC,He also was a big fan of how offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig worked with his quarterbacks.   Guess he didn't watch any of this year's games...

WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Waffle_Monkey_Tacos,10,Mon Dec 29 19:59:36 2014 UTC,I did not see this happening. I thought for sure he would be gone.
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,croissantsandcrepes,6,Wed Dec 24 01:48:46 2014 UTC,"Same here. When Andersen left I really thought Kafentzis would follow him. I'm very happy to see him staying and am curious to see how the QB battle for next year begins to shape up once spring practices, etc. begin."
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Wed Dec 24 01:52:28 2014 UTC,I can see Stave and Gillins having the real shot. People seem to forget about Gillins. He was a 4 star recruit and has an extra year in the weight room than Kafentzis.

I don't know how accurate that is but if he isn't getting enough zip and can't connect on the deep ball he is going to have to be very good in other parts of his game for him to be an improvement over the other guys."
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,Tuggernuts23,5,Tue Dec 30 01:26:04 2014 UTC,"I actually had some hope.  He' been strongly leaning toward Utah State when Gary Andersen was there, then he committed to us pretty quick after the hire.  He'd been committed to us for so long, combined with Gary jumping ship with no warning, to me shows Gary's lack of commitment.  Why would he keep following Gary if twice now in your recruitment he's changed schools?"
WisconsinBadgers,2q85zg,terker,8,Wed Dec 24 16:57:10 2014 UTC,"Holy shit yeah. If we get Bostad and/or Rudolph, we'll have gotten every gift we wanted this Christmas.   To think what Chryst might be able to do with a talented, dual-threat QB who clearly already understands how to be a downfield-passing QB like Kafentzis...damn. They'll have four years together. This could be the start of something wonderful indeed.   On Wisconsin"

WisconsinBadgers,2pl1yj,daymankarate,-4,Wed Dec 17 22:13:13 2014 UTC,Very glad Aranda is back but I still want to know what he was thinking in the 2nd half of that LSU game. Maybe he stepped out to take a dump for a few drives.
WisconsinBadgers,2pl1yj,Hopalicious,8,Wed Dec 17 19:41:21 2014 UTC,That was on Anderson for not running Gordon.
WisconsinBadgers,2pl1yj,daymankarate,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:13:04 2014 UTC,thats true but not what I am talking about.  The defense was decent except for 2 drives where it appeared LSU would turn it into a route. For some reason Aranda switched to 3 down linemen and LSU quickly adjusted and ran the ball down our throats.  Could have been due to injuries but it was hard to watch.
WisconsinBadgers,2pl1yj,guitmusic11,3,Wed Dec 17 22:22:00 2014 UTC,Herring went down with an injury too which opened up the run game big time for them.
WisconsinBadgers,2pl1yj,drewskit,3,Wed Dec 17 22:24:37 2014 UTC,And with zags gone on top of that there was no hope.
WisconsinBadgers,2pl1yj,franklin_stubbs,3,Wed Dec 17 22:37:50 2014 UTC,LSU was running directly at the 3rd-string nose tackle...  couldn't do much about it really.

WisconsinBadgers,2pf6jg,RygarTargaryan,12,Tue Dec 16 01:33:30 2014 UTC,"Everything that I've heard is because he couldn't handle the academic requirements that are attached to recruiting. Apparently, there are some academic standards even for recruited athletes to be accepted to the Wisconsin, and basically he wanted to recruit players that the University would not admit because they weren't academically qualified enough. I don't have any links on me, but apparently he has made multiple requests over the time he was here to lower the standards so he could recruit the players he wanted regardless of their academic qualifications. While they may be good schools, Southern Utah University, Utah State University, and now Oregon State University, are not as academically strong as Wisconsin, which is considered one of the so-called 'Public Ivys.' So it was would sense that he was used to being able to recruit whomever he wanted, and would want to go to Oregon State where he could have that freedom again."
WisconsinBadgers,2pf6jg,adidassler4,1 point,Tue Dec 16 02:37:53 2014 UTC,"The big thing that I heard, regarding recruitment standards, is that we won't accept transfer credits.  Rumor has it that Anderson likes to ""draft"" from junior college schools and most of the people he tried to recruit would lose all their credits when they transferred."
WisconsinBadgers,2p55ek,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,2,Sat Dec 13 03:31:46 2014 UTC,I'm the opposite. At least Bret lost a ton of assistants and it was clear he was upset with the program. Gary has been here for only 2 years and knew what type of hand he was being dealt. So the fact that he used to preach about the team being a family and fighting for each other pisses me off more than Bret ever could. Just seems way more shady and cowardly to me

IIRC he should've had two TD passes, didn't somebody drop one on him at the end of a game this year?

Also, Stave only became QB after Chryst left for Pitt. Being a former QB himself, I bet Chryst and the new offensive coordinator would also let a more competent quarterback run our offense."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,gek0srf,7,Fri Dec 12 15:20:38 2014 UTC,Or maybe he will get a big senior year out of Stave.
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,Herpesdeep,5,Fri Dec 12 18:09:31 2014 UTC,"That would be great if he could. Stave definitely has some work to do in terms of consistency. But when Stave is throwing well, he's pretty decent."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,gek0srf,6,Fri Dec 12 19:56:09 2014 UTC,Chryst recruited Stave to come in as a walk on. Chryst is going to have Stave start next year as he fits his system well. I wouldn't be surprised if Gillins transfer and that kid from Utah changes in schools. Neither of them will be great fits in our offense
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,MG_III,5,Fri Dec 12 18:38:50 2014 UTC,"""The kid from Utah"" is actually enrolling early and starting classes in January. Unless he wants to lose a year of eligibility, I doubt he'll transfer schools."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,gek0srf,3,Fri Dec 12 19:54:38 2014 UTC,"Gillins is from Florida. The guy you're thinking of is Austin Kafentzis, who's already enrolled in classes at UW for spring term (he opted for early enrollment). Assuming Kafentzis will still be considered for the QB position, it is unlikely he would retract his commitment."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,s54b32dd,6,Fri Dec 12 23:41:48 2014 UTC,"Basically what I said, but thanks for letting everyone know his name."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,gek0srf,1 point,Sat Dec 13 00:36:10 2014 UTC,I believe he can still switch?
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,MG_III,3,Sat Dec 13 01:44:48 2014 UTC,"I think they could still excel in our offense.  We didn't run the spread with Russell Wilson, but he got many chances to use his legs.  If they're smart about running, then they'll develop their ability to pass, and those times when our receivers can't get open, they'll scramble.  Hopefully as well as Wilson did.  edit: Here is some Austin Kafentzis tape.  He is very much a throw-first, scramble when necessary QB, at least from this short tape.  I think he could do well here."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,Tuggernuts23,3,Fri Dec 12 23:21:38 2014 UTC,"Stave is definitely a Chryst style (aka pro-style) QB.  I'm not sure how DJ Gillins fits the offense Chryst will have, but my gut says that if Anderson recruited him, it's because Anderson saw him as a spread- or option-style QB. With that in mind, I doubt he would be Chryst's first choice at the position, but if he can throw the ball, Chryst can fit him into the offense. He created a fantastic playbook for Russel Wilson, who is a good example of a mobile QB under Chryst; with that in mind, I have a feeling Chryst will find a place for just about any QB who can throw the ball reasonably accurately, and manage the game effectively.  Bottom line, if Gillins wants to play in a spread offense, he'll go somewhere else. If he cares about garnering national attention for NFL draft looks, he'll also likely go somewhere else. That said, he's already committed to UW, so it seems to me he either chose UW for the coach, or he chose the school on its own merits. Whatever the case, I'm sure Chryst will give him a fair shake at the position if Gillins stays with UW."

WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,PurpleCapybara,7,Fri Dec 12 15:07:15 2014 UTC,"I'm not going to bash Pelini for being a bad coach, I don't think he is.  But there's no way he would be a good hire in the Big 10 right now after being dismissed my a rival.  That makes no sense for recruiting, it would work against you."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,OINTMENTS,2,Fri Dec 12 15:43:06 2014 UTC,"Bama fan checking in since we'll be seeing you guys in Dallas next year. Are you guys really excited about this hire? Chryst seems like an excellent coordinator, but he went just .500 in every regular season at Pitt, a team that was just a couple years removed from a 10-win season. Not bashing your guy, but really want to know what has the Badgers faithful excited about this guy."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,richardallensmith,5,Fri Dec 12 17:26:12 2014 UTC,"It's not his history as a Head Coach, obviously. It's that he's a fucking legend on this campus. Personally, I'm not thrilled. I think we could have done better. But, he's a big time home favorite and god damn he knows how we do things here.  I don't think its a home run pick, but I think he's a good, solid choice. Lets remember that Pitt was a shit hole when he arrived. I think he underperformed, but he did not have an easy job."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,UncharminglyWitty,3,Fri Dec 12 17:51:21 2014 UTC,"I think Chryst was the best available on short notice.  He's a better choice for us right now than Pelini (who I thought could work out well here, given another situation), and for this program, with the draft class we're attempting to build, it was more important to demonstrate that we would be hiring a proven head coach with long-term ties to Wisconsin, to demonstrate to recruits that administration is concerned about the long-term well being of the program (to provide consistency for players to commit to).  It would have been cool if Anderson could have waited until after the bowl, so we could potentially interview Bevell or other NFL coaches, but given the circumstances, Chryst is who I think most people expected for this hire, and that's a good thing. The fact that it happened so quickly and that Chryst and Alvarez already have a history and are on good terms will only help recruiting.  Bottom line, the goal here was to replace a HC quickly and with as little question marks as possible. Chryst was the obvious choice. Any other coach available on the market would have raised significant questions from the press, fans and recruits, and making waves by having people question your moves in the administrative department is not the kind of press you want when you're on the recruiting trail.  Chryst's record at Pitt aside, anecdotal response from fans who followed his tenure is that he's done a decent job with the program he's inherited. Pitt has been a revolving door for football coaches, and that's not an easy situation to recruit in, so it's not really surprising Chryst didn't blow the doors off the Big East/ACC. That being said, he appears to have done well enough with limited talent, winning 6 games in each season since 2012. Obviously, we, as fans, would hope for a slam dunk, but we don't really have time to be waiting around to see if the Darrel Bevells or Jim Harbaughs of the world will take an interview, because our recruiting relies more heavily on our coaching than (for instance) Michigan's."
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,s54b32dd,7,Fri Dec 12 23:20:40 2014 UTC,Pitt moved conferences to the ACC which is a much better conference then the team that won 10 games in the big east
WisconsinBadgers,2p1wnw,MG_III,5,Fri Dec 12 18:40:11 2014 UTC,"Pitt was also in the Big East when they had that 10-win season.  Another thing was that Pitt got really screwed because they had like 4 coaches in 3 years.  Still not that impressive what he is done there. Also, Pitts QB, RB, and Best WR are all sophomores so were poised for nice year next year"

WisconsinBadgers,2p093z,jabarl,-6,Thu Dec 11 20:30:44 2014 UTC,"If people are interested here's some math regarding saleries  Gary Anderson's salary at Wisconsin following his pay raise in march was 2,200,000 compared to Nick Saban's 6,900,000 at Alabama and Urban Meyer's 4,154,000 at OSU. Leaving him 4,700,000 and 1,954,000 under payed compared to his very well compensated peers.  If UW allocated 15,000,000 more in funding to compensate the football coaching staff of 10 coaches we could pay our head coach a whopping 8,200,000 and each assistant would receive a pay raise of 1,000,000 making them all very well compensated if not the best paid in their respective roles nationally.  How much would that cost though? Let's do some math!  UW-Madison has 43,275 students so...  15,000,000 / 43,275 = $346.62 per student per year Furthermore is we break it down by semester it's only $173.31  The average tuition hike at UW from the turn of the century for the next decade was 8.5% annually, the increase of 346.62 dollars per student would be an increase of a massive 4.17% for instate tuition and 1.5% for out of state tuition which are both well below the annual average which at time climbed norther of 16% in some years."

WisconsinBadgers,2p093z,TheLakeCity,3,Thu Dec 11 23:18:54 2014 UTC,"There's a tuition freeze at UW right now, and there's no way they could ever get away with raising tuition to support the athletic program.  Also your statement that Gary is ""under payed"" assumes he is worthy of a salary similar to that of Saban or Meyer, which is laughable. He's nowhere near their paygrade."

It's certainly not the only way to achieve the desired result just and idea of the potential scale of the issue as I see it."

Really the point I'm trying to make isn't necessarily how much it would cost students but more that tuition is going up regardless and this is just a drop in the bucket comparatively. If people are upset that this happened again for arguably the same reasons instead of vilifying a guy for making a business choice why don't we look into realistic solutions like funding a football program that brings in a profit and helps support some of UW's other great sports.

When they attack the lane like that and get to the free throw line like they should, they will be incredibly tough to beat.

CFB is a cesspool. I'm happy the Badgers are as successful as they are while being about as clean as a major conference program can get. I don't want them to sacrifice that, ever.  The assistant coach pay thing is a ""problem"" football-wise, but it's a result of the place the University assigns to the football program financially and the relationship they have with boosters, and I'm fine with that too.

We saw with the search that went on post-Bert that Wisconsin simply isn't going to get real consideration form the highest-rising coaches out there. It's as much a B1G image/performance problem as a Wisconsin problem, but it is what it is.   I say that we continue to be who we are. We bring in good kids who try hard and stay out of trouble, run the motherfucking ball, and win a bunch of games. And when we find another Tolzien, we'll hop back into the playoff hunt. This program has been built the right way in an era of countless programs being built the wrong way.   I don't like this shit at all, but we will be alright. Barry will make sure of it. We have no choice but to trust him, and given the way he built his football program the right way as a coach I'm confident that soon he'll get the right successor to truly carry on that legacy.

We can still be a clean program with paying our assistants more or allowing kids in.  letting in a few kids a year won't ruin our academic integrity.  I am fine with the academic standards, but I don't know why it has to be higher than Michigan and other Big Ten schools. The rest of your thought process is why Wisconsin will never be an elite program.  We will always have this sour taste in our mouths at the end of the season because we were so close and wonder why we couldn't get over the hump."

I think part of it is because they want to keep people from within the UW system, and part of it is because their transfer admission rate is really high.  Why either of those things are, I don't know.  But either way, I'm glad the university didn't bend on their standards. They are they way they want them to be. The University is not at the will of the athletic department, the athletic department is at the will of the university. We are a school first, athletics second sort of program, which I love.

WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,Buckingham_U_Badger,8,Thu Dec 11 21:05:33 2014 UTC,THIS. For the love of god this!
WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,dainomite,9,Wed Dec 10 22:50:13 2014 UTC,Ok. I get it. The guy is halfway to a legend here. But he's .500 at Pitt. He doesn't seem to be all that good at HCing.
WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,UncharminglyWitty,5,Wed Dec 10 22:53:53 2014 UTC,Its not like Pitt is a powerhouse anymore though either.
WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,dainomite,4,Wed Dec 10 23:55:59 2014 UTC,"Wasn't that his job to do? Also, he hasn't recruited very well it seems. They used to always get a nice class, be preseason ranked and then win 8 games as a disappointment. Chryst really hasn't been able to do anything there."
WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,UncharminglyWitty,3,Thu Dec 11 00:24:59 2014 UTC,"/shrugs. Wisconsin's recruiting classes haven't been that highly ranked either, we never crack the top 20 and Chris Borlands class was in the 50s or 60s yet those kids went to the rose bowl three times.  anyway, i dont claim to be a Pitt football expert, all I know is they haven't really done anything in a long while."
WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,dainomite,3,Wed Dec 10 23:36:19 2014 UTC,"Pitt has always been a better recruiter than us. You can get over poor recruiting though if you coach the kids up and win games. But Chryst hasn't done either. You can either be a superior coach/program, recruit better talent than all other teams, or both. You can't go 0/3."
WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,UncharminglyWitty,2,Thu Dec 11 00:23:15 2014 UTC,"Pitt fan here. This is pretty accurate. Before, we would recruit well and be average. Now we don't recruit well and are average."

WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,unmisunderestimated,1 point,Thu Dec 11 00:47:15 2014 UTC,"I feel like you have to give a coach a few more years to really judge their recruiting.  Recruiting isn't just getting a bunch of really good players, it is also about building a team that works well together.  That's how Jerry Kill turned around both Northern Illinois and now UMN.  He knows how to put together a team.  That's something Chryst proved he can do as our OC.  Edit: oops... phone auto-corrected Chryst to Christ..."
WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,Boehemyth,1 point,Thu Dec 11 00:56:19 2014 UTC,"Jerry Kill inherited the 6th worst team in the nation in 2008, per ESPN. He went 6-6 that year. In 2010 he went 10-3. Kill then took a Minnesota team that was way worse than Pitt, goes 3-9 while defeating Iowa.  Goes 6-6 the next year, getting MN bowl eligible for the first time in awhile. Then 8-5, 8-4. You are just wrong in comparing Jerry Kill's success with Chryst's. It is not even a close comparison. Chryst hasn't showed any improvement. Just static."

We all felt like we were on the cusp of breaking through and becoming an elite team nationally.  If we can't stop two coaches from going to Arkansas (who was groomed to be the head coach by BA) and Oregon State because of these reasons its because they realized something that our higher ups are content with being a 7-9 win team and don't want to commit to anything more than they have to.  They fail to understand that Wisconsin doesn't have the national brand that other teams have.  We aren't Stanford, we can't walk in to any recruits house and them being immediately impressed.   This is sad and foreshadows the future of the Wisconsin program. Just look at our coaching options. A former OC who is 19-19 at Pitt is our best option.  Honestly if its true that Chris Borland and Melvin Gordon wouldn't meet the academic requirements to get into UW now then what the hell are they doing.  These guys are both stand up guys.  Lowering the academic requirements for student athletes won't diminish our schools academic integrity. Does anyone talk bad about Michigan, USC, or other academic institutions? Jesus christ pay up Wisconsin. We are going to revert to Pre-BA days pretty quick if Wisconsin doesn't commit more resources to the program. Last fact if we are 2nd in revenue in the NCAA then that is even more wtf worthy."

WisconsinBadgers,2owtnd,spoodylover,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:04:22 2014 UTC,While you're totally correct in pointing out that student athletes make up a fraction of the population the fact still remains that at least two players from the football program got full rides with ACT scores <20 and my sibling got rejected with and ACT score of 30. The two football players are the only two I am aware of the scores for so chances are it was a lot more than two.

But I never got the impression that Andersen was really on the way out the door -- and especially for Oregon State.   I actually thought Andersen, 19-7 in two seasons in Madison including the 2014 Big Ten West division title, might get in the Nebraska conversation. That search, however, was over in a hurry. And so was Oregon State’s once it knew it could land Andersen, the Utah native who is perhaps more of a regional fit with the Beavers.   The academic world would applaud Wisconsin’s administration for holding to its high admissions standards and refusing to boost assistants’ salaries equal to other schools. But Andersen is a football coach, not a dean. It wasn’t in his best interest to remain in Madison.   “They couldn’t get kids in,” someone familiar with the program told me last week. “He was afraid he was going to lose his assistants [to other schools].”   If Andersen didn’t recognize why Bret Bielema left for Arkansas when he took the job, he soon came to understand the challenges created by a slow-to-evolve board.   Those familiar with the situation say Wisconsin athletic director and former coach Barry Alvarez is not the primary culprit, but he also doesn't seem to have a keen awareness of the issues within the administration. So he wasn’t necessarily diffusing the situation, either.   In the end, it leaves Alvarez looking for a replacement that will be the Badgers' third coach in four years.   Naturally, the first name to come to mind is Pittsburgh’s Paul Chryst. The former Badgers offensive coordinator left just before Bielema three years ago, or he might have been in line for a promotion.   He would certainly understand the plusses and minuses of the job as opposed to Andersen, who came in blind from Utah State.   Skeptical Wisconsin fans will see Pitt’s 19-19 record in three seasons and scoff, but they should understand what a tough situation he encountered upon arrival. It was a revolving door of coaches, including Mike Haywood being fired before his first game and Todd Graham’s one-and-done season in 2011.   “He’s got a mess,” I remember one Power 5 coach telling me shortly after Chryst arrived in 2012. Even Chryst admitted after his first season how much roster cleanup was necessary.   So maybe that at least puts a different lens on .500, especially factoring in the Panthers' move to the ACC in 2013.   Chryst, 49, is from Madison and played quarterback at Wisconsin from 1986-88. As a theme, because of who is making the hire, expect Wisconsin to continue its tradition of running the ball and playing sound defense. Chryst's teams have and would do that.   Others to monitor:   Justin Fuente, Memphis head coach  I voted Fuente third on my Coach of the Year ballot after he took Memphis from 3-9 to 9-3. I’m surprised the 38-year-old didn’t get more of a look for Nebraska, but, again, it seems as if AD Shawn Eichorst was locked in the entire time on Mike Riley.   Fuente’s former boss, Gary Patterson, just won Coach of the Year. So it’s a good time to be from Patterson’s tree. Like Patterson's and Fuente’s time together at TCU, Memphis won this season with defense and ball control. Again, that plays well in Wisconsin.   Dave Doeren, NC State head coach  Prior to head-coaching stops at Northern Illinois and NC State, Doeren was Wisconsin’s defensive coordinator from 2006-10.   After replacing Jerry Kill, he was 23-4 at Northern Illinois and got the Huskies to the Orange Bowl in 2012. He didn’t inherit a lot of talent at NC State, but I’m still surprised the Wolfpack have struggled to a 10-14 record in his two seasons. If Chryst’s .500 mark doesn’t inspire fans, that will be an even tougher sell.   The Wolfpack are 7-5 this season, however, and they routed rival North Carolina in the regular-season finale. Getting Florida transfer Jacoby Brissett on the field at QB helped in ’14.   Pat Narduzzi, Michigan State defensive coordinator  As a coordinator who coaches defense, Narduzzi would be fighting the national trend for head coaching experience and offense. But Wisconsin could do a lot worse than the 48-year-old who has been at Michigan State since 2007. Narduzzi clearly knows the league and would maintain Wisconsin’s typically high standard of defense.   Those in the coaching profession believe that Narduzzi is going to land somewhere and cause regret for all the ADs who had a chance to hire him and didn’t."

But because we can't...  ...looking ahead to the rest of the season: The Badgers don't play another NCAA game until January 2nd, thankfully. This gives Eddie Wittchow more time to heal and give the team another solid defenseman. Adam Rockwood, who missed last week with an illness related to a genetic condition, is skating again this week. I have to imagine he'll be back in game shape by January, which gives the Badgers a key forward. Of course, the next 3 series are against the #4, #2, and #7 teams in the USCHO poll. Things don't look good for those games, but getting the injured/ill guys back will help. (Disclaimer: I actually have no idea how soon Wittchow is expected to return.) Fortunately, Cullen Hurley played well when he was asked to play defense earlier in the season.  We've got a good crop of talent coming in next year, so hope is not lost for the long term, but with this news shortly following the Brock Boeser decommitment (he's still considering Wisconsin, but it doesn't look good right now), the future doesn't look as nice as it did a few weeks ago.  It looks like Ford will return to the Dubuque Fighting Saints for the duration of the season, which is no surprise (beyond the fact that he's leaving the Badgers).  While I'm talking about next year, I'm kinda-sorta excited to see Luke Kunin and Luke Opilka play on Friday, as the US U-18 team comes to the Kohl Center to take on the Badgers. (And as a USA hockey fan, it'll be fun to see Auston Matthews, and the rest of this team that has been one of the best U-18 teams the NTDP has had in a while.)"

What Wisconsin did to Nebraska running up the score and not pulling Gordon from the game until it got too slick for him to be on the field was unsportsmanlike.  I don't think that Gordon was more than a very distant #3 in the Heisman race and his complete shutdown against OSU proved that.    I think that this embarrassing game can be attributed to a number of factors including recruiting, scheduling, and the judgment of certain personnel in the UW athletic department.  WI lucks out when they get competent quarterbacks (Tolzein, Wilson) and doesn't actively recruit them the way they do running backs or defensive positions.  I've been a critic of this season's soft schedule and next year's with the exception of Alabama is equally weak.  It's unacceptable to not have OSU, MSU, Penn State, or Michigan on your schedule for the year, especially the first two.  I also think that there needs to be some personnel changes starting with up top and extending to the coaching staff.  I think that it's time for Alvarez to go.  He's too interested in meddling in the football program to be an effective AD for the entire university.  There also needs to be some changes in the offensive coaching staff and recruiting team too."

WisconsinBadgers,2o253c,Sonoma2002,1 point,Wed Dec 3 15:39:47 2014 UTC,"If he looks really impressive against OSU and Mariota looks bad, there's a shot."
WisconsinBadgers,2o1eku,dainomite,3,Tue Dec 2 11:54:25 2014 UTC,"He was also a unanimous pick 1st team Big Ten for the coaches and 1st team Big Ten for Media (he wasn't a unanimous pick for the Media though somehow). I think he has the Doak Walker wrapped up in a bow too.  Gordon needs just 369 yards in the final two games (184.5 per game) to surpass Sanders' single-season record of 2,628 rushing yards. At his average of 188.3 rushing yards per game, he is currently on pace to do just that."
WisconsinBadgers,2o1eku,PurpleCapybara,0,Tue Dec 2 11:55:46 2014 UTC,"just?  He's going to have to gain that against OSU and potentially a top-10 team.  Both will be concentrating heavily on him, as they'll trust their secondaries.  It will be difficult and require monster games from our offensive line. I'd very much like to see this, of course, but 100/game isn't going to be a cakewalk, much less 185."
WisconsinBadgers,2o1eku,scofieldslays,3,Tue Dec 2 16:36:09 2014 UTC,Ohio State's rush defense is atrocious. Coleman from Indiana rushed for 200+ yards against them. I really like our chances.
WisconsinBadgers,2o1eku,PurpleCapybara,2,Tue Dec 2 18:13:21 2014 UTC,well everyone we've played against has known that he's going to run the ball and have tried to contain/stop him and he's still averaging 188 a game.

WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,zylphite,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:52:14 2014 UTC,"Assuming we win, and using the AP polls currently in place, we would need TCU to lose to Iowa State (not likely) and Oregon to beat Arizona (likely).  Even if this happens, we would need to JUMP the winner of K state and Baylor (both of these teams currently ahead of us), jump Michigan State (who doesn't play) AND jump OSU (who even if we beat, only have two loses).  These are all HIGHLY unlikely."
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,MisterMath,2,Mon Dec 1 16:38:20 2014 UTC,"If we win we would for sure jump Michigan state and Ohio state. We still need some unlikely help, but it's not impossible."
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,PhoenixAvenger,1 point,Mon Dec 1 17:54:46 2014 UTC,I wouldn't say for sure. Both are two loss teams and head-to-head doesn't mean shit this year (see Baylor/TCU). It's all about better losses and wins.
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,MisterMath,2,Mon Dec 1 17:56:19 2014 UTC,"I don't know how they would justify ranking the B1G champs below the team they just beat, and a team that didn't even qualify for the B1G championship game..."
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,PhoenixAvenger,1 point,Mon Dec 1 18:00:48 2014 UTC,"Well, Michigan State would have losses to #2 Oregon and ~#8 OSU after getting beaten with no really good wins.  OSU would have two losses to Virgnia Tech and ~#5 ranked Badgers a good win against Michigan State.  If I had to guess, a win against OSU would put us ahead of them but still behind MSU.  Our two losses are LSU (currently unranked) and Northwestern (Ouch).  Michigan State has two losses against top 10 teams.  I could see a 6-7 ranking of MSU and Wisconsin, but MSU being ahead."
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,MisterMath,1 point,Mon Dec 1 18:06:37 2014 UTC,"If we beat OSU with JT, I'd say we'd definitely jump both teams. But without JT, everyone is looking at OSU as a weaker team, which automatically makes a win against them look not as great.  Which is sort of stupid, but I sort of get it, too."
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,smiles134,1 point,Mon Dec 1 23:39:42 2014 UTC,What pains me the most is the 2 losses are to unranked teams. Genuine chance to have a 0 or 1 loss season.
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,perinium,1 point,Mon Dec 1 22:41:26 2014 UTC,"Well, if it's any consolation, we have a similar chance next year.  Albeit with a harder 1st game in Alabama.  Maybe we'll have a quarterback by then."
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,b4dger,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:38:14 2014 UTC,"I thought there was a small chance, but with Barrett injured I don't think it's possible anymore. We just can't get enough credit from beating OSU sans Barrett to move up that much."
WisconsinBadgers,2ny4vm,pianobadger,1 point,Tue Dec 2 04:55:37 2014 UTC,"Nope, playoff had us move up literally 1 rank from beating Minnesota, we have no chance even if our dream scenario happens."

WisconsinBadgers,2nttbd,terker,2,Sun Nov 30 16:33:46 2014 UTC,I'm just glad we aren't down by 19 anymore in the series. Winning 18 games in 20 years is a blessing. Thank god Barry Alvarez came around.
WisconsinBadgers,2nttbd,pokeaotic,2,Mon Dec 1 00:52:00 2014 UTC,So what bowl game are we going to after this?  If we win do we go to the Rose Bowl?
WisconsinBadgers,2nttbd,pokeaotic,3,Sun Nov 30 09:02:31 2014 UTC,"Not this year, no. Probably some Bowl game against an SEC opponent in Florida.   According to Wikipedia....   Beginning with the 2014 college football season, the Rose Bowl game will be a semifinal game of the College Football Playoff every three years, replacing the BCS. The first game will be played on January 1, 2015.  The College Football Playoff will use a four-team bracket to determine the national champion. Six bowl games will rotate as hosts for the semifinal games. The two-bowl rotation is set on a three-year cycle with the following pairings: Rose/Sugar, Orange/Cotton, and Fiesta/Peach.   I don't know why we don't play any Bowl games against Big-12 opponents. :/  We have tie-ins with the following conferences...   4 SEC (3 of which are the january 1 ""big"" bowl games) 3 ACC (and Notre Dame) 2 Pac-12 (not counting years when the Rose Bowl is Pac-12 #1 vs B1G #1) 1 C-USA"
WisconsinBadgers,2nttbd,pokeaotic,3,Sun Nov 30 09:15:08 2014 UTC,"Hell that's confusing.  I knew they were doing the 4 team playoffs starting this year but I forgot they were incorporating some of the bowl games like that.  So if this season was next year or the year after that we might go to the rose bowl?  Do we have a realistic shot at one of the other ""big"" bowl games?  Do they still have all the smaller ones?  If I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like a lot of teams like the Badgers are gonna get screwed out of bowl games because of the new system.  Edit: If OSU wins, what game might they go to?"
WisconsinBadgers,2nttbd,krabtree1525,2,Sun Nov 30 09:24:53 2014 UTC,"So if this season was next year or the year after that we might go to the rose bowl?   Yep yep   Do we have a realistic shot at one of the other ""big"" bowl games? Do they still have all the smaller ones?   I think we have a realistic shot, especially the way we've pulled together more as a team. Call me optimistic I suppose. Yeah they have all those smaller ones still like the Pinstripe Bowl between the Big Ten and ACC and stuff.   If OSU wins, what game might they go to?   I dont know... if they beat us I guess that would give them a shot at making it into the Final Four/College Football Playoff if the Committee bumped them over TCU/Baylor for the fourth spot. But, if Alabama, Oregon or FSU lose and OSU beats us then they probably would go... but I think their shot at winning it all is probably dismal without their starting quarterback, JT Barrett. Their backup is a Sophomore whos never had a career start. His first career start will be against us next week."
WisconsinBadgers,2nttbd,guitmusic11,2,Sun Nov 30 10:22:48 2014 UTC,Thanks for the answers mate   Go Badgers!
WisconsinBadgers,2nttbd,guitmusic11,1 point,Sun Nov 30 18:58:20 2014 UTC,Remember the Sophomore was going to get the nod before JT Barrett stepped in. I don't want to get too excited until I see the kid play. I'm a huge Badger fan so watching us wipe the field of those suckeyes will make me jump up and down like a little school girl.
WisconsinBadgers,2nqlnf,pokeaotic,16,Sat Nov 29 06:37:58 2014 UTC,"Any badger 1st down is usually a ""First and 10 Wisconsin"" with a hand chopping motion.   A safety is rubbing your hands above your head like the A in the YMCA.   Bring your keys for kickoffs. Shake them in the air like you just don't care. Feel free to replace your keys with a shoe (not kidding).  The cheerleaders will hold up signs saying ""We"" ""Want"" ""More."" The only appropriate response is Beer.   O section sucks. Unless you are in O, then every other section sucks. If you end up in O, be prepared for Bucky directing your O chant later in the game.   If someone yells ""Fuck you,"" the only response is ""Eat Shit."" Repeat until the point has been fully beaten into each other's skulls.   ""Let's go Red"" is a popular chant to get going. Feel free to indulge.  The ""Asshole"" chant is reserved for any opponent's fan members that take the risk and stand in the student section. Start chanting loudly ""Asshole"" and point at them several times in a chopping motion. The effect is that of a actual asshole when enough Badgers join in.  Count along with Bucky when he does his pushups after a Badger score."
WisconsinBadgers,2nqlnf,smartinson,16,Sat Nov 29 07:08:57 2014 UTC,As a former player I just wanted to thank you and all the other badger fans like you. Its the fans that cultivate such an enthusiastic and tradition rich environment at Camp Randall. You made some of the best memories of my life.   My first game ever I got yelled at by my coach BC I was mesmerized by the student section and not paying attention!   On Wisconsin and a sincere thank you.

WisconsinBadgers,2npwms,Whoa_throwaway,11,Sat Nov 29 01:39:50 2014 UTC,"That article was FANTASTIC. Wow. He said so many things that I've brought up the last couple years that it was eerie. And yet I can't get anyone to agree with me about most of those things.   I get that Eaves isn't going anywhere. I get that it's lazy to say fire the coach, replace him with someone else, etc. To do it the Notre Dame football way. That's never been a method I'm comfortable with.   But the numbers speak for themselves. Eaves has done a worse job with this Wisconsin program than any other high-profile coach at any other high-profile school in all of college hockey during his tenure.   A retarded monkey could recruit NHL-type talent to Wisconsin. A retarded monkey with only one ear and no eyes. It's WISCONSIN. Six-time national champions, the school that gave the hockey world Badger Bob Johnson. All Eaves does is recruit, and it is blindingly obvious he doesn't do enough to coach up the talent he brings in.   It's tough to compare the two, but look at what Bo Ryan has accomplished in pretty much the same time span, as Eaves. No national titles, sure. But consistency? Absolutely light years better than Eaves. And the talent gap between what Eaves pulls in, compared to what Bo pulls in, is...well...significant. Bo does so much more to directly make his team better than does Eaves, it's just hilarious.   Eaves just hasn't done a good enough job. There's no other way to say it. I'm sure glad that we finally got a point at home tonight, but this season's performance has been absolutely unacceptable. It's been a fucking disgrace - and what are Minnesota and Duluth and Ohio St and all these other fucks going to do to us when we face them later this year? I'm trying not to be a pessimist, but I feel like I'm going to get a lot more angry before this season is over than I already am.   I guess it took the worst start in program history for people to finally see the problem that's been building for more than a decade. Wisconsin hockey should be so much better than this, and it's embarrassing that we're at this point.   The glory days will return, it just fucking sucks right now. All we can do  is continue to ride it out with our guys. On Wisconsin."
WisconsinBadgers,2npwms,terker,4,Sat Nov 29 04:54:06 2014 UTC,"We are, were , an elite team. Now it is just every few years. We lose a lot of talent to the pros, which isn't necessarily a bad problem to have. However we never seem to start out as strong as the elite teams that we should be with. Attendance is going down  games are not as much fun yo watch because of the play. We lose good coaches (howie) and it is getting to be a constant problem. The article points out how we are good every 4 years. And even with that we are getting worse."

Clearly they have had a shit start to their season, but this will help things get better. They're capable of playing well - the talent is certainly there. I'm still pretty furious about this whole situation right now, but glad for the team. They needed something positive, and taking 3 points from a very good team is a start."
WisconsinBadgers,2npwms,WiscDC,3,Sun Nov 30 06:24:11 2014 UTC,"I don't have much to add, because Andy Johnson pretty much nails everything, but if you're a fan of the Badgers, I recommend his work. He's probably the best source for Badger hockey recruiting news."
WisconsinBadgers,2npwms,BuckyCop,1 point,Sat Nov 29 04:14:09 2014 UTC,agreed. His work is great. That is why I had to share. He hits the nail on the head in so many points.   Tonight we played not well again. After 13 years of dump and chase Andy busts out the numbers. I tried to remember to watch for it to count.  Still too many dumps without keeping the puck in our end. Fsu dominated early power plays. We had our moments but came away with a tie. It is disappointing.

What I watched last night was some of the worst, most boring hockey I have ever witnessed. I've never been that disinterested in Badger Hockey, which has been my passion since stepping foot on campus.   This article was a great piece of work and really shows the problems with these Badger teams. I have never been a fan of Eaves but his issues are really starting to set this program back. I'm sick of homer fans talking about how young this team is and we just need to rebuild. Fuck that in the goat ass. This is Wisconsin hockey, a rebuild year should be 4 games over .500 and a tourney miss. You think Minnesota or BC have rebuilding years where they are 0-8-1? Hell no. This is on coaching."

Most of these guys were 3-4 star recruits and all have shown flashes of athleticism and playmaking ability. Given another offseason to refine route running and receiving skills, and more time I the weight room, I would look to one of these guys to be an outside threat before any incoming freshman."

Obviously, video-camera cell phones weren't a common thing at the time, and even if they were, nobody would be pointing it at the student section anticipating a tradition that didn't exist yet.  If there's footage of it from the game broadcast, you may be able to acquire that tape for a fee, but I doubt they would bother showing it when they came back from commercial.  The best chance of video footage existing would be stuff the university has in the archives recorded by their own people. If somebody's camera (being used for in-stadium video) caught it, it might exist.  You might be able to find footage if you try and dig deep in the athletic department. It's probably not going to be great footage, as there wasn't any reason to specifically record that event, but I could be wrong. Considering how resistant they seem to make highlights from last year publicly available, I wouldn't get my hopes up."

He walked up and down the court half the time, can't hit a shot outside 8 feet, doesn't play defense, and had no left hand. Don't get me wrong, he is dominate in areas; he just does not seem like a good fit in the Bo Ryan offense. I think both Wisconsin and Diamond would be better off with him at Uconn. If I had to put a label on him, reminded me of a mix of Hasheem Thabet and Greg Oden."
WisconsinBadgers,2n17eo,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,1 point,Sat Nov 22 14:52:07 2014 UTC,The two guys you just compared him to were dominant college players who controlled games. I don't know how well those players would fit into a Bo Ryan system but I definitely would rather have them than not
WisconsinBadgers,2n17eo,jakevv,1 point,Sat Nov 22 19:02:04 2014 UTC,"I actually somewhat agree with you. He would not (yet) fit that well with the current Badger style. That being said he has potential. Similar to Nigel Hayes he would have to improve his outside game and may not get as much pt as he would like until his second season. The Badgers seem to recruit more on athletic potential, desire to improve, and team cohesiveness. If they don't change to fit the system they leave (George Marshall) or keep the scholarship and don't live up to potential/hype (countless overhyped recruits over the years)."

Otherwise you are looking at using parking in people's driveways and yards for a fee. This can be anywhere from 10 to 30 dollars depending on how close it is to Camp Randall. You can also find shuttle services run by local bars but those are also a fee. Let me know if you have any questions and I can get more specific. Enjoy the game!

WisconsinBadgers,2m7q42,Chrismoore8,1 point,Thu Nov 13 20:40:06 2014 UTC,"Hi there, I couldn't find anything on lostlettermen.com when I searched last names beginning with I. I also manually looked at each season from 1950-1960 and didn't come up with anything :/   update 1: I found an online archive The Milwaukee Journal - Sep 21, 1954 that mentions him showing up to freshman football along with 144 others. Looks like he played Football at West Allis Nathan Hale  High School.   In high school he was first team All-Conference (1952) but it doesnt list his position. link  update 2: A-HAH! Success! According to the Wisconsin State Journal's Wisconsin Badgers All-Time Roster Robert Ihling played RB for the Badgers in 1957 and his number was #19. However that's the only year he is listed there."

WisconsinBadgers,2m6utd,wadecalder,3,Thu Nov 13 16:10:25 2014 UTC,Apparently they didn't get the message about frank...
WisconsinBadgers,2m6utd,zmichalo,2,Thu Nov 13 17:03:54 2014 UTC,I think they got the message fine... 3rd team all american is nothing to scoff at.
WisconsinBadgers,2m6utd,UncharminglyWitty,3,Thu Nov 13 19:42:44 2014 UTC,That's true. I'm more surprised that Decker is on first team ahead of Frank.
WisconsinBadgers,2m4mqd,G0PACKGO,2,Thu Nov 13 00:06:47 2014 UTC,"Kind of a really neat prospective because you know he's not only a member of the team, but a fan of the Packers and you get a strong vibe that he's really irritated he cannot be out there.   Here's to hoping his recovery is going well and that he kills it in camp next year!"
WisconsinBadgers,2lxli2,Tshuey2,4,Tue Nov 11 04:09:52 2014 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has commented.   *where to go/not to go  Are you by yourself? Are you 21? Do you drink? Do you like to party? Are you looking for a restaurant, too? What side of campus is your hotel? Lots of questions haha."

WisconsinBadgers,2lxli2,Tuggernuts23,2,Tue Nov 11 08:08:10 2014 UTC,"Regent Street is another good bet after the game. It's closer to Camp Randall than State Street and has a few great bars - Buckingham's, Jordan's Big Ten Pub, the Red Zone, Lucky's, etc. If you're looking for a hidden gem, the Greenbush Bar doesn't have quite the same gameday feel as the others, but it's got some great Italian food."
WisconsinBadgers,2lxli2,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:50:39 2014 UTC,"Greenbush is awesome, but it's a basement.  A really, really NICE basement, but it gets crowded quick.  I've never been there on a gameday, I can see it either being packed full, or empty.  I would lean towards packed full.  That being said, the Big Ten is my favorite bar."
WisconsinBadgers,2lxli2,WiscDC,2,Tue Nov 11 22:38:20 2014 UTC,"Okay! Since it is a 2:30 game, I'll give you a ""(downtown) madison as fuck"" day. Begin by going to either Mickies (tons of food for a good price) located on the west side of campus (you can see Camp Randall from the dairy bar) or the Sun Room cafe locaed on state street (east side of campus). Both places are terrific. Be sure to go early to both places.   If you went to mickies, read this:  Start on regent street. If you guys are drinkers, start at the Red Zone. Its a huge bar compared to the other places and you will be able to be served higher amounts of booze in a shorter amount of time. Then, I suggest going to Jordan's Big Ten pub. Great affordable food and decent drinks. Spend a significant amount of time here. Then walk west and move to Lucky's. This place will be packed since it is so close to Camp Randall. Then go to the game  If you went to sun room cafe, read this:  Start off at monday's. Yes other Madisonians, I said it. Monday's has SO much liquor in their drinks. Two whisky sours probably has 4-5 shots in it... easy. Then head to  state street brats (towards the west side of campus). Get a boot of your favorite Wisconsin beer (please don't get spotted cow.. fuck). If you like watching other football games, they usually have two giant televisions showing the other games upstairs. Then move to Wandos. Fishbowls for dayz. My personal favorite is the fireball whisky/angry orchard combo. Lots of sugar though... otherwise they just have basic colors. These are $20 a piece and in general are worth it. You could either continue with the mickies path (Redzone/JB1G/Lucky's) or you could go to the Nitty Gritty on North Frances and Johnson for a great atmosphere.  Go to the game.   You can either drown your sorrows after a Nebraska loss by reversing the order of the bars, or you can eat your sorrows away by going to get food. I highly suggest: Jordans/wandos for true bar burgers, Nitty/Dotty Dumplings for iconic burgers, or the old fashioned/great dane for great food on the Capital Square. You cant beat the views here.   Then continue to drink.... we like to drink here.   I hope this helped! Let me know if there is anything else you need :)"

Throw a stone and you will find a bar/restaurant. I would suggest going to State Street after the game. If Nebraska wins, avoid wearing your Nebraska gear. I am from Nebraska so I know the Nebraska mentality is to be as ridiculously cordial as possible to visitors, but that is just not the culture at UW. We will call you asshole for wearing your Nebraska red into our bars after game, especially if you win. Have fun!   Oh, and fellow Badgers, please do not sell a ticket to a Husker.

Craigslist and stub hub are the best pre-game buying scenarios.

You can go to other bars on State but for whatever reason I was never crazy about those bars in the light of day. I would definitely try to tailgate before going in any bars. You can park south of Regent and walk to the parking lot of Rocky's on Regent and Orchard, there are always lots of tailgaters there and it's close to Camp Randall and some bars. Also on Friday night I would go to state street and just bounce in and out of bars. Red Rock is an awesome country bar off of state."

They elected to use it for the November 15th slate of games so the decision will be made by next Sunday.    Also of note, there is an additional 11 am time slot on ABC that day in addition to the normal 11 am slots on ESPN and the 2:30 pm slot on ABC.  I'd say it's a virtual guarantee our game and the Minnesota/Ohio State game get those two ABC slots so at this point it's just a matter of who plays at 11 and who plays at 2:30."

WisconsinBadgers,2l02hi,dainomite,1 point,Sat Nov 1 23:05:55 2014 UTC,It will eventually get to an 8 team playoff but for right now I am just thankful we have a 4 team playoff over the old BCS system.  Give it a few years but the 8 team playoff will come.
WisconsinBadgers,2l02hi,ChrisWebersTimeout,5,Sun Nov 2 19:00:42 2014 UTC,"The biggest ""if"" on this team is the ""if we had a real quarterback."" Then we'd most likely be undefeated and have a great shot at the playoff.   Unfortunately, no, a two-loss Big Ten team with one great win (B1G Championship) and a few pretty good/ok/not terrible wins (Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota) is not making it over any 2-loss SEC team, and probably wouldn't get past some two-loss PAC-12 teams.   I would advise for your own sanity not to think about this...without a real threat in the pocket who can hit wide open receivers with any kind of consistency (let alone covered ones), it's nearly impossible for this team to run the table anyway."
WisconsinBadgers,2l02hi,Jewtheist,2,Sun Nov 2 04:06:57 2014 UTC,"No Big Ten team is getting in even with one loss unless it's tOSU, Michigan,  or Michigan State. Our playoff chances were gone the moment we lost to LSU, even if we beat tOSU in the Big Ten title game."

WisconsinBadgers,2l02hi,Innova,3,Sun Nov 2 00:16:30 2014 UTC,"Why did we start the game with three three and outs?   Because Stave forgot there's this thing called a ""play clock"""

We're in a system that punishes small schools and lets bigger schools get away with whatever they want! Break a guy's leg? Ok! Rob people? Ok! Take bribes? Ok as long as you're not in the Big Ten or Pac 12! Illegal recruiting? Ok! Lose a game to a SEC team? If you're a SEC team, ok, otherwise GTFO. Get screwed by refs over and over? Here's an apology, unless you're a SEC team, which chances are it's them screwing the over team over for you!  Despite how fucking corrupt and one-sided the NCAA is, do we try to take bribes? Do we try to recruit illegally? Do we try to hurt people? Do we break the law? Hell no. We can keep getting fucked over for being in the wrong conference and for not having a valued history and for being a small school in comparison with other schools fighting for a title, and never win a title in basketball or football ever. But do we just say screw it, let's cheat because most of the schools that win win the wrong way? No. And that's why despite probably never seeing a championship headed our way I'm proud to be a Badger fan."

WisconsinBadgers,2kbjw7,dainomite,2,Sun Oct 26 05:44:00 2014 UTC,"Obviously that wasn't a trick play situation, but he pointed out that Bart is a QB and having a QB punt opens up a lot of fake punt options.  Edit: He also mentioned it earlier in the video where he says he would have liked it to get a bit more height, but it is designed to roll and potentially hit one of their guys making it a live ball, like /u/Fap-0-matic said, or at least prevent a return."
WisconsinBadgers,2kbjw7,pianobadger,2,Sun Oct 26 16:46:32 2014 UTC,Coach trolling all of us that want Bart to start a game

WisconsinBadgers,2k431k,pianobadger,5,Thu Oct 23 17:27:30 2014 UTC,Of fucking course he does. Ludwig got to go. He has no identity as an OC. Either use your dual-threat as a fucking dual-threat or don't. Maximize your players impact.   I'm not a coach and I dread becoming the armchair OC that is overtaking me but jesus fucking christ with MELVIN GAHT DAMN GORDON in the backfield you gotta be able to figure something out. If McEvoy blows - he blows- moving on there are other elements of a read option scheme that can be employed with Stave. If he doesn't blow then let's use him. If they both blow lets go fucking wildcat. We pretty much already are. Fuck. Let's run wildcat with McEvoy as a WR every fucking play and then maybe run one passing play every game. FUcking shit this team is annoying as fuck.
WisconsinBadgers,2k431k,wackywiener,3,Thu Oct 23 21:02:47 2014 UTC,"Ludwig got to go.   All that needed to be said. He doesn't fit in at Wisconsin, maybe we can trade him for Chryst <I can only dream>"

WisconsinBadgers,2k431k,Tha_Stig,2,Thu Oct 23 17:34:44 2014 UTC,"Anyone who thinks Gordon's NFL stock is being hurt this year is living under a rock. The guy is putting up career numbers this year despite being on a lethargic offense. His Heisman hopes are pretty slim right now, but he basically needed to have Wisconsin make it to the playoffs for that to happen, and our chances were pretty low from the start."
WisconsinBadgers,2k431k,smiles134,1 point,Thu Oct 23 20:05:03 2014 UTC,"Either way, having McEvoy on the field is a liability for him, as any defense above pop warner will know that the only person they need to focus on is Gordon when McEvoy steps out."
WisconsinBadgers,2k431k,Tha_Stig,2,Thu Oct 23 21:12:30 2014 UTC,"Except that McEvoy has been running the ball really well, too"
WisconsinBadgers,2k431k,smiles134,1 point,Thu Oct 23 21:42:29 2014 UTC,Also check out their poll asking who should be the Badgers' QB.  These are the results so far.  Some of the labels are cut off. They are in order:  Tanner McEvoy Joel Stave Joel Stave and Tanner McEvoy Bart Houston D.J. Gillens Melvin Gordon They should recruit somebody else.  I think that speaks for how much fans want to see McEvoy at QB.

Maybe they're not ready, but maybe they're being sat in favor of guys who are more experienced and trustworthy with routes, but who aren't able to get open enough or make plays.

WisconsinBadgers,2jmxn6,Jewtheist,3,Sun Oct 19 16:31:43 2014 UTC,"I put most of the blame on OC and QB coach Andy Ludwig, so I'm not blaming the kids at all. Honestly it's a little ridiculous to expect a kid like Stave, who was a walk on, to be a great QB. That doesn't change the fact that the Badgers simply don't have a quarterback who is good enough at this point. I think most fans are really frustrated because they realize that Melvin Gordon is a once in a lifetime talent and it's a shame that he decided to come back and try to win a B1G championship, and the team has been a huge disappointment so far."

WisconsinBadgers,2iv9em,terker,3,Fri Oct 10 19:42:58 2014 UTC,"Frustrating second night. 4-2 loss  Badgers got on the board, with freshmen contributing to the scoring on both goals. And Rumpel seemed to have made some nice saves. He also allowed a softie and generally wasn't his usual awesome self. But it's only his first start, and he was probably still exhausted from the travel and midterms. Shit happens, he'll be fine.   More frustrating was a lack of many real chances on the power play, including an oh-fer during a 5 minute major PP. Which came as a result of an open-ice cheapshot from the senior captain of Alaska-Anchorage on Davison when he wasn't looking.   Certainly not as horrible as our trip to Boston last year, but a frustrating start to the year. Gotta get things rolling next week in Green Bay. Hope Davison is alright"
WisconsinBadgers,2iv9em,terker,1 point,Sun Oct 12 05:51:22 2014 UTC,"It's certainly frustrating. It especially stings because those are the only 2 games in the season so far, so it's so magnified. There are certain bright spots that we can legitimately be excited about. Even over the course of those two games, the freshmen took nice strides forward.  Some of them are already playing quite well. From what I've read and heard, Davison had a great couple of games (until he left in tonight's game).  As much as I feel like hitting the panic button, it would be stupid to do so right now. I'm super excited to see what they can do against NMU in Green Bay, and then to see these guys in person on November 7th after an extended break for practices and the scrimmage (of course, a UND matchup is always exciting)."

I'm really excited to see the highly-touted prospects on the men's hockey team (and quite frankly, Badger hockey games are amazing). Women's hockey should be nothing short of dominant. Volleyball has been dominant, and they've been so in a raucous environment.   And football? I'm still excited for tomorrow's game, just as I am every week. They're just 0-1 in Big Ten play.

Stave has pontential but is a mental midget, McEvoy is water trash (Its Always Sunny Reference!), and we don't have anyone who is ""THAT"" receiver for any of our QBs. Abbrederis was a saving grace for our shallow QB depth last year and we lost that. We need playmakers to step up and help out, Gordon is the offense right now."

WisconsinBadgers,2hu1q5,WiscDC,2,Thu Oct 2 01:11:58 2014 UTC,"It's crazy how much we've lost, but with Rumpel coming back we've got a legit chance against every team we're going to play all season. Dude was fantastic last year. It'd sure be nice if Peterson got it together and provided a more reliable backup, too. He had a couple ghastly outings last year. I sure hope Jack Daughtery is ready to live up to the hype, because we lost a ton of point production on the blueline.   And LaBate is a serious potential go-to scorer. He's got the size and ability to be a 20+ goal power forward and we really need him to be. The single biggest thing lost is Zengerle's playmaking ability. He was as slick a passer as I've seen in a long time. With so many of our proven scorers gone it's going to be tough to generate offense some nights. If only Zengerle had a 5th year to come back and help get the kids quality chances. We're gonna have stagnant offensive games when it will all fall on Rumpel; he's the guy that makes us a top 10 team. Even with all the recruits and the name on our jerseys, Rumpel is this team.   I'm so ready for basketball because this team should be our greatest ever; but at the same time I'm equally pumped to see what the young hockey team is going to look like in front of Rumpel."
WisconsinBadgers,2hu1q5,terker,2,Tue Sep 30 04:46:38 2014 UTC,"Rumpz is the man! I absolutely agree that as long as he's in the net, we've got a chance. I'm excited to see how Beese plays this year. We need people to make up for all the lost scoring so hopefully he'll be one of them."
WisconsinBadgers,2hu1q5,WiscDC,1 point,Tue Sep 30 16:51:44 2014 UTC,"Don't discount Zulinick as a playmaker. Besides the fact that he's another ""MZ,"" he probably has the best hands on the team.

WisconsinBadgers,2hu1q5,WiscDC,1 point,Thu Oct 2 01:34:17 2014 UTC,"Probably high, especially considering the predictable cycle that the unbalanced classes causes compared with the 11 straight years in the preseason rankings. That said, there are definitely some pieces on this team that could bring this team up.   Obviously, Joel Rumpel has proven himself to be among the best goaltenders in the country. In addition, Some of the freshmen coming in this year are top-notch prospects. Jack Dougherty should be an instant contributor on the blue line. Kevin Schulze has been outstanding so far, and could prove to be an important offensive contributor this season, which would be great when you consider the lack of forward depth...  ...about that lack of forward depth. Returning forwards such as LaBate, Besse, and Zulinick will obviously be the guys we look for early on. In the next 2 seasons, we've got some great recruiting classes coming in. Unfortunately, everything doesn't really get fully set in place until next season. There will be question marks at the bottom of the depth chart. However, guys like Rockwood, Hughes, Wagner, and Ustaski should be able to be key contributors in their freshmen season. And hey, Aidan Cavallini looked surprisingly not out of place in his appearances last year! Next year, guys like Brock Boesser and Luke Kunin will round out the lines sheet so that forward depth will be much improved.  Defensively...the big name is, of course, Jack Dougherty, the guy the Badgers got after he decommitted from Ohio State, and was a second-round draft pick this past summer out of the USA NTDP. Keegan Ford will be stepping into a big role immediately. As far as the veteran D-men are concerned, I'd keep an eye out for Kevin Schulze, as I said earlier. He's been a little under the radar, but he's an excellent puck-moving (and fast-skating) defenseman who, while maybe not Justin Schultz 2.0, is quite entertaining to watch.  Anyway, all those thoughts boil down to this - I think this is going to be one of those years with a lot of ups and downs, including wins against top teams and losses against meh teams. What I know for sure is that I can't wait for hockey at the Kohl Center - it's magical. And the home schedule starts off with a series against North Dakota - not only does it renew the storied rivalry, but it is a rematch from last year's NCAA tournament. Can't wait!"

WisconsinBadgers,2ho2xn,airtmac24,2,Sun Sep 28 03:01:13 2014 UTC,"Another performance that was somewhat concerning. Obviously they turned it around in the second half, but being tied 3-3 with a poor USF team at half should never happen.   What are they trying to do on offense? McEvoy seems to have more success when they roll him out of the pocket, but he throws so many passes from inside the tackles. He needs to start hitting long passes like the one to Arneson to make defenses honest. Gordon struggled to get started today because USF would shoot the gaps every time we pulled a guard.  Defensively the outlook is much brighter. Landisch is a freaking baller. If there's anything I'm worried about, it's the secondary. They're susceptible to the deep throw - Shelton especially has been beaten like a drum repeatedly this year. I was looking forward to him having a true breakout year after last season but he just hasn't shown up so far."

WisconsinBadgers,2fz875,untouchedURL,1 point,Wed Sep 10 04:40:55 2014 UTC,I am really hoping McEvoy brings his second half performance forward.
WisconsinBadgers,2fz875,SpeedyTuyper,1 point,Wed Sep 10 04:42:23 2014 UTC,I think we'll see something between that and his performance against LSU for the rest of the season.
WisconsinBadgers,2fu87e,PurpleCapybara,10,Mon Sep 8 20:15:39 2014 UTC,"Kudos to Coach A for calling the timeout.  Ref missed the call, conferred with others, and still missed it."
WisconsinBadgers,2fu87e,1curlygurl,5,Mon Sep 8 20:48:21 2014 UTC,"Definitely. I'd like to think the fans helped. Any of us sitting on that half of the field could see what happened & were screaming at the refs. The closer it got to W. Illinois getting a play off, the louder it got.   I didn't even consider it being a safety at the time, though. Was just thinking about the much worse field position where he downed it on the field..."
WisconsinBadgers,2fu87e,franklin_stubbs,2,Tue Sep 9 01:59:42 2014 UTC,"I was drunk as hell and sitting behind the end zone (alumni band). Everyone around me saw it clear as day, yet the three refs didn't. Truly a terrible job by the crew."

WisconsinBadgers,2fu87e,guitmusic11,1 point,Tue Sep 9 00:36:33 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure the clock starts when you leave the end zone so if a player drops the ball in the end zone and the other team picks it up the clock will still read 15:00 instead of 14:59.
WisconsinBadgers,2fu87e,b4dger,1 point,Tue Sep 9 13:01:26 2014 UTC,It starts as soon as the ball is touched.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_management  Also (pdf warning):  https://www.scfootball.org/docs/Game%20Clock%20and%20Referee%20Signals.pdf
WisconsinBadgers,2fu87e,uwbadger,2,Tue Sep 9 15:35:07 2014 UTC,"Looks like the exact same thing happened between Michigan State and Notre Dame in 1987. In that case, the clock still showed 15:00. But I guess it's somewhat arbitrary when the clock operator starts the clock. To be absolutely certain, you'd have to look at the videos frame by frame to get the tenths of a second.  http://www.msuspartans.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/090807aaa.html  ""The Irish grabbed a 2-0 lead on a bizarre opening kickoff. MSU deep man Blake Ezor caught the kick inside the 1, took a half-step back into the end zone and kneeled for what he thought would be a touchback... it did give the hosts the lead with 15:00 still showing on the game clock. That was the first time a team had scored without any time off the clock. """
WisconsinBadgers,2fnok7,Kobe_AYEEEEE,5,Sat Sep 6 18:59:44 2014 UTC,There was no reason we shouldn't have racked up hundreds of yards of rushing today. The OL play is definitely a concern.
WisconsinBadgers,2fnok7,SpeedyTuyper,2,Sun Sep 7 01:11:06 2014 UTC,"I agree. The fact that Gordon + Clement had < 100 yds rushing combined against W. Illinois is a major red flag, even if they were stacking 9 in the box."
WisconsinBadgers,2fnok7,uwbadger,1 point,Sun Sep 7 09:28:34 2014 UTC,I would be more concerned if they hadn't been able to beat them through the air.  Each of the last three years we've been unable to beat teams when they stack 9 in the box.  Saturday gave me a glimpse of hope.  Let's hope we can do that against a better opponent.
WisconsinBadgers,2fnok7,stratman42,5,Mon Sep 8 21:40:34 2014 UTC,"That first half was rough, but we looked like a football team in the second half.  Our offensive line needs to generate more holes if we want to be a power running team."

WisconsinBadgers,2fnok7,terker,1 point,Sat Sep 6 21:43:34 2014 UTC,"I'm with you here. I thought he made quite a few questionable reads and while his receivers caught the ball, he wasn't putting the ball in great spots and it somewhat cost us additional yards. All in all, he was a lot better than he was against LSU(which he should've been considering it was W.ILL) but the o-lines lack of push during the running game was frustrating. MG3 had few and far chances at reaching the 2nd layer of the defense, but looked sharp catching balls out of the backfield.  They've got their work cut out for them and the week of rest should really help."

WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,wackywiener,13,Wed Sep 3 14:57:31 2014 UTC,"The thing is, why did Ludwig feel the need to ""kill their momentum?"" They didn't have any. We were having success because of our run game. I get wanting to go for the throat but Melvin's first run of the second half should've showed the way to do that was on the ground.  Just a really bizarre job of coaching all around in the second half. It reminded me of the 2010 Rose Bowl. We were a running team all year but decided to completely abandon that philosophy and air it out against TCU. We finally turned back to the running game in the second half but it was too little too late.  TL;DR Don't outsmart yourself."
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,SpeedyTuyper,3,Wed Sep 3 16:35:30 2014 UTC,For sure. I have no idea what he was doing or what he heard or anything. Just the complete wrong adjustment. I thought the players were fine the coaches just really fumbled which is something you can learn from.   Hopefully strides will be made.
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,nutty15,3,Wed Sep 3 16:37:20 2014 UTC,It's fine to be negative since it seems apparent that pride got in the way of winning and it cost us the game.  Losing a winnable game sucks way more than just knowing the better team took it to you.
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,nutty15,1 point,Wed Sep 3 19:02:28 2014 UTC,In what way did pride get in the way? They made poor adjustments.
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,Favre4Life,2,Wed Sep 3 19:05:15 2014 UTC,By benching MG3 instead of letting him continue to be dominant.
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Wed Sep 3 19:30:00 2014 UTC,That isn't what happened. Everything we've heard of late is that he had a hip flexor and the trainer didn't want him to go. Then some miscommunication on the the actual injury.
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,franklin_stubbs,3,Wed Sep 3 19:46:50 2014 UTC,"The problem is McEvoy can't throw. In the first half LSU didn't know that because he would throw the deep ball only once in a while to keep them honest and they were so focused on the run game. But in the second half when McEvoy had to start throwing he was just terrible. He looks like a great athlete and football player, but he can't throw to save his life.  Gary Anderson has really disappointed me. Last season we lost games we should have won and then embarrassingly lost the bowl game. And then to watch us give up that second half was just painful. A good coach would not have lost that game. I'm pretty upset Wisconsin gave him that extension when he's proven NOTHING. Oh well."
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Wed Sep 3 21:42:29 2014 UTC,"That's completely ridiculous. The throws he was asked to make in the second half were tough for NFL quarterbacks. He was in no rhythm. We needed short throws similar to the slants/outs he was completing in the first half.  Andersen lost 4 games:  1 due to refs, 1 to a similar team on home field, 1 due to be outcoached and 1 due to his starting quarterback (Stave) making a boneheaded play and getting himself knocked out of the game."
WisconsinBadgers,2fd0dh,the-mp,3,Wed Sep 3 21:45:56 2014 UTC,"McEvoy played one year of high school football, was basically let go by South Carolina, and played a year of Junior College QB. Nothing he's ever done gives us any indication he can make D1 college football throws."
WisconsinBadgers,2fbryv,pianobadger,6,Wed Sep 3 04:02:52 2014 UTC,Everything from Saturday on has been absolutely bizarre.

WisconsinBadgers,2facog,terker,7,Tue Sep 2 19:40:47 2014 UTC,"Hopefully we can hammer Western Illinois and/or Bowling Green early and get Houston onto the field for some meaningful snaps; this team needs to look at him in game action.   Bucky needs more from the QB spot - we ask less of the position than most teams, and someone has got to step up. Hopefully McEvoy, if that's who Anderson truly has faith in. He looked absolutely horrible on Saturday, but it's still early. On Wisconsin"
WisconsinBadgers,2facog,Buckysaurus,3,Tue Sep 2 19:43:47 2014 UTC,I've been wondering about Houston.  How does a highly touted recruit from a top high school in California just fall off the map?  I don't think McEvoy will look bad this week though so he'll retain the job for the year unless we lose a game in which we shouldn't.
WisconsinBadgers,2facog,Buckysaurus,8,Tue Sep 2 19:46:58 2014 UTC,"We hit absolute grand slams with Scott Tolzien and Russell Wilson. Smart, consistent, productive leaders.   Aside from that, though, we've really been snake-bitten at QB this decade.  Stocco and Donovan dealt with a handful of injuries. Phillips was a big-time prospect and looked like a nice get, but had his knees betray him. Then came the outstanding 3-year run of Tolzien, Tolzien, Wilson. Then we add Houston as the breakthrough recruit from a powerhouse program we've wanted to show people we can keep getting strong QBs...and he gets hurt, and redshirts, and hasn't been the same prospect since.   So we add another transfer in O'Brien (impressive, right?), and instead he's a disaster. We end up having to with Stave, the #3 or maybe even #4 option. Meanwhile, Phillips is still getting screwed over by his knees. But Stave actually ends up looking like he might be ok...until he gets hurt. Sigh. So we have to use Phillips on his torn-up knees. And good for him, he's actually pretty solid. But Stave takes the job back last year, and is up-and-down while Houston tries to get right and Phillips hangs around in his swan song...and then plays in the bowl when Stave gets hurt again. One game after Stave tried to throw 10 picks in an embarrassing loss that makes us all question whether he's really the guy.   Fast-forward to this year. We still don't know where Houston is at physically, but want him to become the player we'd hoped he could be 3 years ago. Stave loses the job to a guy who played safety a year ago, and now is hurt. Which sucks for him, and I hope he gets better soon. And lastly, the guy who beat out Stave had us all retching - and not from the beer - in his first start as our QB.   At this point, I'm kinda scared for DJ Gillins' well-being. That's tongue-in-cheek...sort of. Bucky is due to catch a break at the QB spot, right? Maybe I'm just too close as a Badger fan and feel like we've had worse luck than we really have. But damn...right?"
WisconsinBadgers,2facog,SpeedyTuyper,1 point,Tue Sep 2 20:55:24 2014 UTC,I still feel like the coaches are just hedging their bets on waiting for Austin Kafentzis though.

WisconsinBadgers,2fbmrr,pianobadger,12,Sat Sep 6 19:07:54 2014 UTC,"I don't believe you.  1. There was nothing wrong at halftime.  We were up 17-7, and McEvoy had not imploded yet.  Sure he missed some key throws in the first half, but they hadn't cost us anything.  I wasn't even considering a quarterback switch.  You don't pull your starting quarterback after one half of one game especially when that game is against one of the best SEC defenses.  2. Gary Andersen has a proven track record of being a decent dude.  He literally called every player at Utah State to personally tell them he was leaving for Wisconsin.  That is a fact.  Pardon me if I don't believe your contact's contact.  Also:   I don't care at all if anyone tries to deny this confirmation, but you will be 100% WRONG in your attempt to try and say this is BS or whatever you want the little jimmies to say about it.   is about the worst defense for proving you're right.  This is Gary's second year.  Everyone calm down. We lost to a good team.  We're going to be okay."
WisconsinBadgers,2fbmrr,Tuggernuts23,2,Wed Sep 3 03:42:23 2014 UTC,The thing that makes this hard to believe for me is that Gordon was in the opening drive of the 2nd half.  There is definitely some strange stuff going on with Andersen and the media though.  This is Wisconsin Football's new official song.
WisconsinBadgers,2fbmrr,pianobadger,5,Wed Sep 3 03:57:56 2014 UTC,"I think Gordon being in on the first drive proves that nothing serious happened at half-time.  Obviously something went down.  I heard a rumor of a hip flexor that was tweaked before half-time.  Maybe he tweaked it further on the run.  We may never know for sure. But I do know that calling for Gary Andersen's job after one loss to LSU is asinine, especially because none of us know the full story.  And we probably shouldn't if it's internal."
WisconsinBadgers,2fbmrr,Tuggernuts23,2,Wed Sep 3 04:03:22 2014 UTC,"They came out with the hip flexor story Monday afternoon and it does seem to make sense that they could have been treating him cautiously due to a minor injury. It also sounded like there may have been a communication issue though. Gordon took the blame on himself for not making sure his coaches knew he was good to go. That stuff was pretty odd.  I think Andersen is doing a really poor job handling the media. He doesn't know the right thing to say when there's an internal issue, and it also seems like he wants to keep stuff internal that probably doesn't need to be internal.  Saying ""I don't know"" when asked why Gordon was kept out was a big mistake, the way he said Gordon had a situation at halftime was also a big mistake, then when the hip flexor story came out people naturally doubted it. Half because of what came before, and half because it seems like something there should be no problem telling the press in post-game interviews.  Now with Stave he said he was injured, only to say hours later that he's not injured. That seems like another case where he tried to cover what could be an internal issue, basically Stave having a bad week of practice and not feeling comfortable throwing the ball, but he covered it in the worst way possible by saying he was injured. He should have told the truth or said nothing."
WisconsinBadgers,2fbmrr,pianobadger,2,Wed Sep 3 04:16:37 2014 UTC,"I agree with most of this.  Another point, Stave did say something just as confusing, along the lines of ""It's not injured, but I'm not throwing the way I want to."" So maybe neither of them know what's up.  But you're right, Gary Andersen needs his shit in a tighter ball, but that's not a good reason to get rid of him this early."
WisconsinBadgers,2fbmrr,Hopalicious,2,Wed Sep 3 04:24:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, we have explanations now for two of the bigger coaching questions from Saturday. Even if we can't be completely sure that they're true, they make sense, and Gordon and Stave have given the same stories to the press as Andersen's latest versions. The play calling is still an issue but the blame for that should probably fall on Ludwig. I don't see anything close to sufficient reason to be calling for Andersen's head at this point."
WisconsinBadgers,2fbmrr,franklin_stubbs,4,Wed Sep 3 04:37:27 2014 UTC,"Jesus. It's the first game.  We blew it and lost to a really good SEC team, not some cup cake school we should have beaten by 50."

WisconsinBadgers,2f62j6,UncleJew,3,Mon Sep 1 18:13:38 2014 UTC,"Source? Edit: Souces: 1 2  It would kind of make sense if he had a mild injury. He would have had to have been hiding that with what he said after the game though, and Andersen said he didn't know why Gordon was out, but later said something about a halftime ""situation"" which could be a mild injury. It's a hell of a lot more likely than that stupid rumor about Gordon being benched for saying Stave should come in.  Edit: It seems like Andersen decided to lie to the public about this issue and it's hard to figure out why.  Edit 2: It also seems like Andersen is sticking with McEvoy, also hard to figure out why."
WisconsinBadgers,2f62j6,anothersurf,4,Mon Sep 1 18:30:31 2014 UTC,"I agree that the injury excuse is totally bogus, but I'm not entirely sure whose fault it was that the situation got out of hand in the first place. Andersen is a defensive minded coach, and I think he leaves most of the offensive decisions to Andy Ludwig. You have to remember that Ludwig was the OC at Utah while Andersen was the DC, so I think Andersen probably sees him as an equal rather than as his assistant. Ultimately, Andersen needs to put his foot down and tell Ludwig to get his shit together because not pounding the rock with Melvin Gordon for the entire second half was flat out unacceptable. The biggest game on the schedule is not the time to rest somebody for precautionary reasons. And if Gordon said something to Ludwig or Andersen at halftime about bringing in Stave, maybe they should recognize that Gordon is probably the most respected player on the team and might have a point. If we find out Ludwig sat Gordon just to prove some stupid point and Gary let him do it, then Ludwig needs to be fired. The fact of the matter is they just threw any hope of making the playoff down the drain for NO REASON, and we as fans shouldn't just sit here and assume they know better than us. They fucked up and should be held accountable.  TL;DR Ludwig needs some blame too."
WisconsinBadgers,2f62j6,misterid,1 point,Mon Sep 1 20:28:09 2014 UTC,"there was a hit, i don't remember when, where Gordon got drilled and i thought ""that looks like it hurt him.. right on the hip/side"".  he got up a bit slowly and somewhat favored it for a second.  he didn't come out immediately but that surprised me because it looked clear that it hurt.  must have tightened up/got worse as time passed."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,JLyons043,17,Sun Aug 31 04:08:59 2014 UTC,Why did Melvin only get 3 carries in the second half? How can you have one of the top 3 backs in the FBS sitting on the sideline?
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,dalejarrett1999,6,Sun Aug 31 05:05:21 2014 UTC,"""Gary Andersen said Melvin Gordon was fine. Doesn't know why he didn't carry the ball more than two times.""  https://twitter.com/ZachHeilprin/status/505941775463501824  It was actually 4 carries in the second half. But still absolutely ridiculous. They pulled this crap last year too with White eating up carries even when Gordon was running far better (example Penn St game)."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hard4Favra,9,Sun Aug 31 05:13:12 2014 UTC,I have a problem with the head coach not knowing why the feature back didn't get more carries.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,husky54,1 point,Sun Aug 31 16:32:23 2014 UTC,"He's not a micromanager.  I'm sure he had a discussion with Ludwig afterwards, but it's not Andersen's job to jump in and take things over during the game."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,stratman42,8,Mon Sep 1 06:04:41 2014 UTC,"Whoever was calling plays deserves to fired. It wasn't just the lack of carries for Gordon. On 2nd & 4 with 3 timeouts and just under two minutes left in the first half you get the first down before going for the home run. Instead, we damn near gave up points at the end of the half after punting with 90s still on the clock. The constant attempts at read-option and spread plays that weren't working when the power run was speaks to a staff more committed to their system than to the available personnel. I hope Barry straightens them out or it's going to be a long season."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,AlcarinRucin,1 point,Sun Aug 31 07:05:08 2014 UTC,"I would've rather seen more read option in the second half.  They were stacking the box, so runs up the middle were getting stopped, but we couldn't do anything through the air.  A read option play or two could've helped to open things up."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,stratman42,5,Mon Sep 1 06:05:52 2014 UTC,Did Gordon fuck all the coaches' wives or something?
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,cheeseburgertwd,7,Sun Aug 31 14:11:31 2014 UTC,"That wasn't just the only egregious bad play calling for me though.  The major thing that pissed me off about the offensive play calling was when we were throwing at the beginning, why weren't we just throwing tight end dump plays that went for just a couple yards.  At least build the kids confidence instead of throwing it deep to inexperienced wide outs.  We should have had far more play action roll outs that should have targeted Arneson and Watt.  (Maybe we're just getting away from Wisconsin football and I don't think we have the talent to do that.)"
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Buckysaurus,3,Sun Aug 31 05:20:34 2014 UTC,What I would like to know if those failed bombs were his reads or the called play.  If those were called plays then the OC should never have called that again.  My fear is McAvoy has terrible judgement.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Shua_Tran,3,Sun Aug 31 05:29:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, he was winging it up there at times.  The first pick wasn't that bad, but the second was pathetic; it's like he just mailed in the second one."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Buckysaurus,3,Sun Aug 31 05:36:59 2014 UTC,"I don't know why we weren't throwing swing passes to get Gordon and Clement the ball in the flat. Let them work with it. 40+ yard bombs is not the way to break in a new QB. Give him screens, swings, 10-15 yard play-action crossing routes.  Not sure on the validity of this, but there's a rumor that Gordon was stumping for Stave at half and the coaches weren't happy about. Possible they were punishing him? Or, he tweaked something on the big run...I don't know, but 4 carries is just terrible."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,redblackbluewhite,2,Sun Aug 31 13:51:52 2014 UTC,"To me, he should have never been throwing passes over 15 yards.  I don't know if he was always panicking in the pocket or if those errant throws were designed.  He gave up on the play way too quick for me when there was pressure.  Either he tried to hit the guy he was looking at or he tried to run it.  (He didn't even trust Gordon blocking him at times)."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Buckysaurus,6,Sun Aug 31 14:04:04 2014 UTC,The offensive play caller is retarded and starting McAvoy was absurdly stupid.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,corduroyblack,15,Sun Aug 31 05:08:01 2014 UTC,"I think we need to cut McAvoy a bit of slack.  Most QBs get their first start again North Appalachian State.  He got his first start in what was basically a bowl game.  Also, his intangibles are much better than Stave.  His feet kept at least 2 drives going in the first half, which Stave never could have done."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,2,Sun Aug 31 05:34:04 2014 UTC,And how many balls to nowhere and into the dirt cost drives? He sucked.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,dradam168,4,Sun Aug 31 23:53:52 2014 UTC,So he looked like Stave last year?
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,3,Mon Sep 1 00:11:38 2014 UTC,"At his worst I was getting Stave flashbacks.  I'd rather give him the time to improve (bolstered by actually RUNNING THE FUCKING BALL) than put our hopes back on the totally inept arm of Stave.  Then again, it would be nice to get McAvoy back at safety.  The freshmen out there really weren't cutting it."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,1 point,Mon Sep 1 02:50:31 2014 UTC,McAvoys feet and our new kicker will win us close games we have lost in the past two years. Let hope our defense can keep the suck level to a minimum and we should have a decent season.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,dalejarrett1999,3,Mon Sep 1 03:45:34 2014 UTC,He's had 1 start against the best team he will play all year.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,WISCO_HECKLA2824,5,Mon Sep 1 03:43:22 2014 UTC,They keep talking about wanting to run the spread offense. We can't even catch a screen pass.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,fascistcheese,-1,Sun Aug 31 05:10:38 2014 UTC,LOL. BECAUSE HES WEAK. LOL.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,franklin_stubbs,6,Mon Sep 1 04:32:28 2014 UTC,The only happy person was Stave.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,dskatz2,9,Sun Aug 31 04:51:48 2014 UTC,We hang tough with a higher caliber SEC team if Herring doesn't get hurt we probably win. No need to panic.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,franklin_stubbs,2,Sun Aug 31 15:44:43 2014 UTC,"I know lots of you people hate on Stave, but he's way better than McEvoy. The coaching staff has some serious problems if they're insisting on playing their style of QB (dual-threat) even when the guy can't play.   I think it was SVP who said ""It's great if your QB can run. It's even better if he can throw."""
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,wackywiener,1 point,Sun Aug 31 15:14:00 2014 UTC,"That's an incredibly stupid assessment. McEvoy played against one of the best teams in the country, and it was his first game. He's dealing with a crazy-young receiving corps.   It's one game. Let's see how he performs against a crappier team before writing him off completely."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,2,Sun Aug 31 21:42:31 2014 UTC,That's a good point. What a stupid idea by Andersen to give a guy his first start on the road against a top 15 team.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,djyp,1 point,Sun Aug 31 21:59:19 2014 UTC,He was fine in the first half. Playcalling went to shit is the main problem.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,2,Tue Sep 2 16:43:10 2014 UTC,"I was thinking we need a new Defensive Coordinator on that drive where we decided, ""Lets only have 3 D linemen in the middle"" and LSU just ran it down our throats. Even the announcer was questioning what the hell we were doing.  The holes were giant.  That 2nd half was hard to watch, but wasn't surprising.  I knew going into the game that all SEC teams come roaring back in the 2nd half when people get tired.  It's then their superior athletes take over and win the game. I figured we needed a huge lead going into halftime to have a fighting chance. It is good to know though that this is the best team we will play all year until, maybe the big 10 championship, or a bowl game."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,djyp,6,Sun Aug 31 04:53:44 2014 UTC,There's a lot to be questioned in that game on offense and defense.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,AlcarinRucin,5,Sun Aug 31 04:58:49 2014 UTC,Like where the hell did Melvin go for most of the 3rd and 4th quarter? He didn't look hurt.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Jdog2010,2,Sun Aug 31 05:28:31 2014 UTC,Right?
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Buckysaurus,3,Sun Aug 31 13:21:40 2014 UTC,Hard to blame the defense after losing 2/3 of the starting D-line and getting basically no rest in the second half.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,dalejarrett1999,1 point,Sun Aug 31 07:10:00 2014 UTC,"Eh, we could still use a secondary.  Because we do not have one at this point."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Buckysaurus,2,Sun Aug 31 07:43:47 2014 UTC,"I'm overreacting, but I would honestly like it if we put McEvoy back on defense and just started Gillins.  I mean, after seeing that, what could be worse?"
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,4,Sun Aug 31 05:10:51 2014 UTC,"I agree with you but he is 6'3"" 181lbs. He needs to put on some weight to be able to take hits. No sense in getting him hurt since he is our future."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,MaximumDestruction,2,Sun Aug 31 05:14:08 2014 UTC,"I guess, but right now it just appears they're just waiting for him to mature or for Austin Kafentzis to arrive."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,1 point,Sun Aug 31 05:24:44 2014 UTC,That never stopped Stave.  He is made of Glass.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,franklin_stubbs,2,Sun Aug 31 05:36:19 2014 UTC,"Naw. Stave stood in the pocket and took some big hits like a champ last year.  Tanner was cringing away from contact all game, it was a huge part of his awful deep throws."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,dradam168,3,Sun Aug 31 18:09:50 2014 UTC,Gillins is going to be good.  He should have a shot next year or this year if injuries pile up.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Sun Aug 31 05:38:07 2014 UTC,"You want to start Gillins? WTF. I know lots of you people hate Stave, but the dude's a solid QB."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Buckysaurus,2,Sun Aug 31 15:12:18 2014 UTC,"He really isn't a ""solid QB"".  He had quite a bit of trouble simply hitting wide open receivers last year."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Shua_Tran,1 point,Mon Sep 1 02:55:19 2014 UTC,He's the best option we've got right now.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Hopalicious,1 point,Mon Sep 1 03:35:39 2014 UTC,"I'm overreacting   Also, just wondering are you from Franklin?"
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,dskatz2,0,Sun Aug 31 15:56:27 2014 UTC,"A lot went wrong in the second half of that game.  Sure, Gordon may have done better, but once LSU realized that McAvoy couldn't throw we didn't have a chance.  Our receivers were terrible and McAvoy was either not prepared or not good enough (and I really hope it was the former or this season is going to be a long one).  This wasn't just the play calling, this was being outmatched."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Shua_Tran,3,Sun Aug 31 05:26:10 2014 UTC,Our receivers were terrible    100% agreed. Boy did they suck. Lets hope they get their shit together before we have to play another real opponent.
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,Shua_Tran,3,Sun Aug 31 05:41:06 2014 UTC,They're all so young! Our WR core graduated last year. They need time to develop.

WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,MaximumDestruction,2,Sun Aug 31 05:53:33 2014 UTC,"The way we were pushing them off the ball, I'm not convinced they could have stopped Gordon if we'd lined up in a heavy formation the entire 2nd half and just kept feeding him. McAvoy and the receivers were bad, but the play calling was worse."
WisconsinBadgers,2f25uo,ginga_balls,1 point,Sun Aug 31 07:14:30 2014 UTC,"Even Gordon would have had trouble with 8 or 9 in the box.  Don't mistake me, the play calling was bad, but without the threat of a pass the defense will just play against the run every play.  I imagine the idea was to complete a few passes so the run would be productive."
WisconsinBadgers,2f1udx,the-csquare,19,Sun Aug 31 01:37:22 2014 UTC,"The coaching staff owes the players a serious apology.  Utter misapplication of talent. You don't take a mediocre QB and make him look god-awful by asking him to throw tons of low-percent deep passes that he doesn't have the talent to throw.  You don't take one of the best running games in CFB and have it take a backseat to your wanna-be air raid offense.  Not even mad at McEvoy. All he should have been asked to do was complete screens and short, high-percentage passes to keep the defense honest and build his confidence.   But no, his confidence is going to be shot to hell because the coaching staff decided to take chopstick and demand that it be a Louisville Slugger.   And way to piss in the face of Gordon for deciding to stay at Madison."

WisconsinBadgers,2f1udx,BadgerMk1,1 point,Sun Aug 31 05:06:25 2014 UTC,McEvoy felt phantom pressure and just threw the ball off his back foot every fucking time.
WisconsinBadgers,2f1udx,BadgerMk1,2,Sun Aug 31 13:25:53 2014 UTC,"That's true in the 4th quarter for sure but that is all setup by not not having any receivers.  He had plenty of passes that could/should have been caught. And a whole lot of communication errors that makes a qb look bad but has just as much to do with the receivers.  The bigger issue is play calling.  In this game he demonstrated athletic ability and the willingness to run as well as success on the few short passes into the flats that we ran.  So why the fuck are we calling passes deep over and over with no success when we have a short game? That contributed to the running game being shut down and where the duck was Gordon?!?!    My point is did McEvoy turn out to be the QB we wanted?  No, but he is the best we have and the issue isn't with his ability so much as it is with the play calling that ignored his strengths and kept pushing a passing game that clearly wasn't ready for prime time.     Next week sure work those kinks out at game speed. But last night was against a no BS good team and we were the under dogs. In that scenario you play up your strengths which means punish them with the run game and keep them off balance with a mobile QB and short passing game.  Don't get me started on the defense."

What he might lack in experience he makes up for in potential. Feel bad for Stave though. I kind of feel like he earned the job even though he wasn't my favorite."
WisconsinBadgers,2eap24,Kobe_AYEEEEE,8,Fri Aug 22 19:11:24 2014 UTC,His mobility is especially important since the receiving corps is so inexperienced.  Stave is a pocket passer without proven receivers.  Not a good combination.  McEvoy adds a dimension to our offense that helps cover up a deficiency within the passing game.
WisconsinBadgers,2eap24,TheLakeCity,5,Fri Aug 22 19:31:14 2014 UTC,"McEvoy might be the answer down the road, but he'll now be taking his first-ever D1 snap under center in Houston against LSU. That doesn't exactly instill a lot of confidence in me right now. This decision is even more of a head-scratcher when you consider that Stave has, by all accounts, outplayed McEvoy throughout camp and in the scrimmage recently.  An announcement from the team regarding an injury to Stave would clear all of this up. Until then, it's a bit confusing."

WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Mon Aug 11 17:33:34 2014 UTC,"I disagree with this.  I'd rather have them both push each other, as opposed to either feeling like they've already earned the job.  And I think it's helping too.  The fact they both are competing at a high level is a good sign, and I believe whoever is chosen as the starter will have benefited from the competition."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Tue Aug 12 14:41:35 2014 UTC,"Maybe, but what's a ""high level?"" Both seem pretty mediocre to me. Stave has two years of being a starter under his belt and still isn't the clear-cut favorite. I see that as a sign that he hasn't progressed as much as you'd hope a B1G QB should. And likewise, our scholarship QBs (Houston, McEvoy) can't beat out a former walk-on..."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Tue Aug 12 15:34:50 2014 UTC,"can't beat out a former walk-on...   Is that a slight against Stave or Houston and McEvoy?  In either case, competition is never a bad thing.  I was at the spring game and Stave looked good to me.  He threw the deep ball well, and fit the ball places I didn't expect.  Kind of like when Aaron Rodgers throws into coverage but makes it work. Obviously not on that level, but the same concept.  If that doesn't fit your definition of ""high level"", that's fair enough.  I still maintain that the competition between the two will only make both of them better.  We still have a few weeks for the ""clear starter"" to emerge."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,Tuggernuts23,3,Tue Aug 12 15:44:57 2014 UTC,i hope this is his way of saying theyre both in the running. having two starting quarterbacks is almost never successful. this would be a terrible decision
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,scumbagscuba,6,Mon Aug 11 14:12:07 2014 UTC,"Stave and McEvoy have different strengths.  I wouldn't be upset if I saw McEvoy come in for some designed runs, tricky shit after Stave is named the starter.  However, I would be less okay with Stave coming in for a deep pass if McEvoy started."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,Tuggernuts23,5,Mon Aug 11 15:36:33 2014 UTC,"I would also be ok with McEvoy coming in on some packages, but to truly split snaps seems like it would be a bad idea.  My biggest surprise was to read that Stave didn't have a bad season last year statistically.  I think that expectations for QB play really have been raised after Russell Wilson.    From the ESPN article   And, it's not as if Stave had a dismal 2013 season. His 336 pass attempts were a single-season school record and the 208 completions was third highest. Stave's 22 touchdown passes were second most in school history, trailing only Russell Wilson, who led the Seattle Seahawks to the Super Bowl title. His 2,494 passing yards were the fifth-best all-time and most by a sophomore."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,Tuggernuts23,4,Tue Aug 12 03:30:19 2014 UTC,"Not just Russell Wilson, Scott Tolzein actually set the record for passer rating the year before Russell shattered it. Tolzein won the Johnny Unitas award his senior year. So yeah, we are real spoiled. Stave was not that bad last year.  edit: Changed a ""Tolzein"" to a ""Stave"""
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,thebenron,3,Tue Aug 12 05:18:39 2014 UTC,"tried this in 2009 with Tolzien and Phillips, it didn't really work and sucked up offensive chemistry. Pick a QB and stick with him."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,Tuggernuts23,2,Tue Aug 12 12:15:55 2014 UTC,"We went 10-3 and won our only bowl game of the last 5 years that year!   And they only tried it in 4 games, 2 of which were non-conference.  Phillips only had 12 pass attempts the entire year, of which 7 were completed.  He also rushed for 138 yards on 14 carries, granted most of the yards came during the non conference games.  So I guess I wouldn't say it didn't work.  It looks like it worked okay when we tried it.   Anyway, Gary Andersen has traditionally run offenses designed for a more mobile quaterback, so I trust him more with it than I did Bielema anyway."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,thebenron,1 point,Tue Aug 12 13:18:11 2014 UTC,"Trust me, it didn't work (hence only was used in 4 games). The Iowa game was a perfect example of why it's a bad idea:  Tolzien drives the offense down the field to take a 10-0 lead, Iowa answers with a field goal. Phillips comes out next possession, 3 and out, offense never gets back in rhythm."
WisconsinBadgers,2d8e8r,uwbadger,1 point,Tue Aug 12 16:43:29 2014 UTC,"The article never mentioned anything about a ""dual quarterback"" possibility. That's almost always a bad idea.

Although it's still not a good sign that neither QB has established himself."

WisconsinBadgers,2cltwv,something_wittie,23,Mon Aug 4 17:39:26 2014 UTC,"As we count down 50 days until the start of the 2014 college football season, ESPN Insider Travis Haney is answering at least one big question a day until South Carolina and Texas A&M’s kickoff on Aug. 28.   Heisman contenders, breakout freshmen, conference winners –- it will all be covered as part of Insider’s Ultimate Season Preview.   Today’s question: Who will have the most impressive statistical season in college football?   Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston feels like the obvious answer, maybe too obvious, as he attempts to follow a Heisman-winning season. He’ll amass numbers, sure. Other signal-callers, such as Baylor QB Bryce Petty, will too.   But I’m going with a running back: Wisconsin junior Melvin Gordon.   Gordon averaged 10 yards a carry in 2012 as the third option behind Montee Ball and James White. As the 1A to White last season, Gordon rushed for 1,609 yards (7.8 YPC) and 12 touchdowns.   While he could have gone to the NFL draft (and likely would've been taken in the middle rounds), Gordon instead chose a chance to be ""the man."" And I think there’s a 2,000-yard season in him.  “He wanted to be the featured back at the University of Wisconsin,” second-year coach Gary Andersen told me when I visited Madison this spring. “Now he’ll get that chance. You know the story: Montee was here, James was here. This is the Melvin Gordon Show now.”   Andersen said he noticed a drive in Gordon in the preparation for the team’s Capital One Bowl game against South Carolina. Even though the Badgers lost, Gordon posted his eighth 140-plus-yard outing of the season. Gordon's exceptional speed was an early-career calling card, but his pad leverage and lower-body strength are evolving into assets.   “He’s becoming more of a complete back,” Andersen said. “It was just different. The bowl game, he ran differently. But he still has this flash, and it’s like, ‘Holy cow.’”   Andersen added that the 6-foot-1, 210-pound back squats “almost 600 pounds.”   And Gordon is consistent. This will jinx him, I know, but in 288 career carries, Gordon has never fumbled. (His only credited fumble, in the Capital One Bowl, was on a lateral.)   Based on the program’s recent track record, Gordon will inevitably share carries with sophomore Corey Clement, who averaged 8.2 yards per rush last season as the third option.   So what exactly will this season's carry breakdown look like? Andersen suggested a 60-40 or 65-35 split.   “It depends on how Corey handles it,” Andersen told me when he was at ESPN last week, adding that he would be surprised if Gordon suddenly became a 25- or 30-carry back. “But there is the temptation to run him all the time.”   Wisconsin opens with LSU in Houston. It’s an intriguing game for a number of reasons, including how Gordon and an experienced Badgers offensive line (four starters return) will handle SEC West girth. With both teams looking to run, I joked to Andersen that the game might last two hours.   If the Badgers can get by the Tigers, remember that the newly realigned Big Ten divisions allow them to avoid Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State in the regular season. The schedule suggests that the winner of Wisconsin at Iowa on Nov. 22 has a great chance to rep the West in the Big Ten title game. It also means Gordon won't have to face some of the better front sevens in the league.   That's why I think Gordon can approach the 2,177 yards Andre Williams put up at Boston College last season. And if he isn’t there already, Gordon will move himself into the conversation with Georgia’s Todd Gurley and Alabama’s T.J. Yeldon as the top back in the 2015 draft."
WisconsinBadgers,2cltwv,RagingAntiDentite,7,Mon Aug 4 20:20:05 2014 UTC,"I can see the yards happening if Clement doesn't prove he can handle the backup role well, but I don't think he gets that trophy unless he gets the yards and at least 25+ TDs.   Remember when Ball got his Heisman Consideration? ~2k yards and nearly 40 TDs and he still didn't win. Our school is known for fantastic OLines. I think that along with the fact that Ball may be the first Wiscy  back in a while to do anything in the Pros means our backs don't get the same level of respect a back from the other P5 conferences will get."

WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,vatoniolo,5,Mon Jul 28 19:59:46 2014 UTC,I won't settle for anything less than the championship game. We were sooo close last season.
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,Jizzle11,8,Tue Jul 29 03:59:04 2014 UTC,"Hockey is going to be a rebuilding year.   Last year was supposed to be ""the year"".  However, we do have some nice freshmen coming in....I just don't have confidence in them contributing enough to make up the firepower that we lost.  But anything is possible with solid goal tending...which Rumpel will give us."
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,Innova,1 point,Mon Jul 28 20:26:46 2014 UTC,"Joel Rumpel will almost definitely be this year's premier star (hence why he's on all the marketing stuff right now). He was one of the best goalies in the country last year.  Depth is a problem, especially at forward. Just looking at the roster, guys who were 4th liners will have to play greater roles, and guys who were normally scratched or on the 4th line as an injury fill-in will be playing every game.  It's pretty hard to ignore that we're seeing a downgrade this summer.  However, all is not lost. Looking at the recruiting charts that Andy Johnson (B5Q) has put together, we've got some outstanding talent coming in over the next few years, but everything really really start to get set in place next year, not this year.  This year, it feels like we're stretching to fill out the depth chart.  This is a team with blue-chip freshmen and not a ton of depth, so I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some marquee wins mixed in with a bunch of losses.  Up front, we can count on LaBate and Zulinick to be contributors. Besse's a scorer. I'm really excited to see what Jedd Soleway can do, as he seems more skilled than his one (almost 4) goal freshman season would indicate. At the very least, he's a big, physical player who's not a liability. It will be interesting to see how Adam Rockwood and Cameron Hughes do off the bat. Hughes could very well be a first-round pick in 2015. IIRC, Matt Ustaski should be able to contribute right away as a freshman.  Defense...this should be fun.  Kevin Schulze has been good-to-outstanding (he'll have to help out the forwards on offense). Chase Drake and Eddie Wittchow are the only other two D-men who have played in games for the Badgers before, with Tim Davison redshirting last year. Jack Dougherty should be able to contribute right away. We've got some good freshmen, but they're still freshmen.  I wish I knew more about the other teams in the Big Ten, especially Ohio State, who was one of the most interesting teams last season. Ryan Dzingel is gone, but Christian Frey is still there, and I have no idea if MSU is poised to do big things this year. I'd predict that the Badgers and Buckeyes finish 3rd or 4th, behind Michigan (2nd) and Minnesota (1st).  Regardless of how freshman-laden this team is, I'm freakin' pumped for the season to start."
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,WiscDC,3,Tue Jul 29 21:13:58 2014 UTC,"I don't agree with us being pegged for the B1G championship game. We have a lot of players on the defensive side of the ball that need to be replaced. Plus, who is our QB? And once we have a QB picked between Stave and McEvoy, who will that QB throw to? True, there are maybe two other teams to concern ourselves with in the West (NE and IA) but this team has a lot to replace from last year to win the division."
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,Brucho,3,Mon Jul 28 20:23:04 2014 UTC,"Take a look at our schedule vs the rest of the West. Our hardest games are opening the season against LSU at a neutral site, a team that is arguably equal on paper and should make for a good game. Other than that, we've got NE at home, a team that hasn't fared well away against us, and Iowa in Iowa, where we won handily. We also get Illinois, Maryland, Purdue and the Rutgers four weeks in a row.  NE plays MSU in Michigan, UW in Wisconsin, and Iowa in Iowa.  I think Iowa is going to be the team to beat, this year."
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jul 28 20:36:18 2014 UTC,"I agree Iowa will be the team for us to beat and it's conceivable we could get past them on a head-to-head if we win at Iowa City, but Iowa comes around in cycles. They have been down for a bit and I expect them to start coming back soon. We got past Iowa last year thanks to a pair of turnovers and winning at Iowa will not be easy. Maybe I am being pessimistic with all of the lost starters and the complete lack of passing game on paper, but I suppose given that our weak schedule may be to our benefit."
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,Brucho,2,Mon Jul 28 20:54:50 2014 UTC,Hopefully whoever steps up as our starter can perform at an average level all year. Our offense is gonna fall on the backs of Gordon and Clement this year.
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,smiles134,1 point,Mon Jul 28 21:00:27 2014 UTC,I suspect it will be McEvoy.

It was fun getting to know him on a personal level.  He talked about how he's going to get more involved and coach a position this season (not sure which one).  Total players coach, you can tell he's all about the guys - really cares about them and therefore has a great locker room.  Down to earth, very grounded guy. As far as the QB battle (Stave or McEvoy), he doesn't know who will start but we talked about how competition is a good thing.  He kind of alluded to how he expects more out of that position and how the guy who handles the ball every snap needs to make some plays. Didn't ask him about Melvin, but I think he's pretty high on Clement as well.  Those guys should be a hell of a 1-2 punch this season."""

WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,WiscDC,3,Tue Jul 29 14:08:43 2014 UTC,"Football: This is probably toughest to keep track of and predict, largely because of all the moving parts (especially in the trenches). Melvin Gordon III will be the star of the offense. It'll be interesting to see what the passing attack looks like with no more Abbrederis. I doubt it'll resemble the Wilson-Toon-Abbrederis passing attack of 2011. Based on everything I've read and heard, this team should be quite successful.  Basketball: Look at last year's team. Now look at who they're losing. Look at who's staying. It's pretty straightforward. Expect dominance.  Men's hockey: I made a much more detailed comment here. We'll see some ups and downs, as we've got a very young (but also talented) team.  With Joel Rumpel in goal, the Badgers are never in terrible shape.  Among returning forwards, LaBate, Zulinick, Besse, and Soleway will play significant roles. It'll be fun to see how the freshmen adjust to the college game. Some guys, like Jack Dougherty (who is nothing short of a blue-chipper), will be able to contribute right away.  Other guys may need some more seasoning.  The future is bright, but some of those bright pieces won't be coming this fall, so the Badgers won't be that deep. That said...I'm extremely excited.  Badger hockey makes winters at the Kohl Center amazing.  Volleyball: Let's see...they went to the national championship game last year. Who did they lose? One senior. Yes, Annemarie Hickey is a valuable player, but considering she was the team's only loss, the Badgers are in excellent shape. (Apparently season ticket sales are in excellent shape too - winning is wonderful.) Last year, new head coach Kelly Sheffield turned this program around almost instantaneously, and he seems like a great guy to be around. It'll be a fun season at the field house.  Women's hockey: Unlike the men's team, the women's hockey team is losing very little.  Brittany Ammerman, having received that medical redshirt, is back yet again. While Alex Rigsby is a big loss in goal, her replacement is excellent. Ann-Renee Desbiens proved to be very effective when she played last year. (And she's a goalie who likes to play the puck...that's always fun.) Courtney Burke is a top-notch blueliner. Watch out for Sarah Nurse. (Fun fact, she's the cousin of Darnell Nurse and the nephew of Donovan McNabb.) She is an excellent forward who showed flashes of flat-out dominance in her freshman season. The freshman class is supposed to be pretty good (harder for ordinary fans to judge than men's hockey, where there's NHL central scouting and junior leagues to look at).  The most prominant freshman this year will be Annie Pankowski. She was originally going to come here last year, but she didn't as she was playing with the USA national team through December (she was one of the last cuts). We've got some national title contenders at LaBahn Arena.  Man...now I'm just so excited to get back to the Badgers games. Seeing my fellow fans, hearing the band, being loud...can't wait!"
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,blue-phoenix,2,Tue Jul 29 21:44:57 2014 UTC,"Football:  I expect a trip to Indy, but I know it won't be an easy road.

Hockey:  I'm not sure what a realistic expectation is for the upcoming season would be, but based on the loss of depth others are mentioning, I would be happy with finishing in the top half of the conference, and another national tournament trip would be fantastic. landing in the Fargo regional    and as always, not losing to Minnesota."

WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,thebenron,2,Tue Jul 29 21:46:24 2014 UTC,"Football: 9 wins is about what I expect, 10 should be considered a successful season. Potential problems on the schedule for me are LSU, @Northwestern (fuck Ryan ""Field""), Nebraska, and @Iowa. Bowling Green may also end up being a sneaky tough game depending on how fast the team puts it together. How the team navigates these games should give a good indication of what kind of season it's going to be.  Basketball: I want the Big Ten regular season trophy badly. Anything less than a humiliation of Marquette followed by Bo burning down the Bradley Center and sowing the scorched earth with salt will be personally disappointing.  As for the tournament, it'll all come down to the matchups, but a loss before the elite 8 would sting.  Haven't kept up with hockey enough since I graduated, but going to a game is on my short list for when I roll through town again next."
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Tue Jul 29 08:51:18 2014 UTC,"I think we're going to have a down year in all three big sports (compared to the expectations, not compared to crappy teams like Minnesota).  Football: Outside of Melvin Gordon being dominant, we have a lot of question marks. The O-line is down by our usually very high standards. The QB position continues to be a weak spot. Who can catch a pass? We lose our entire front 7. Anderson starts to transition the team more to his style. It's going to be tough to get to Indy.  Basketball: Expectations obviously sky high. This team will do well, but it's very difficult to get to back to back Final Fours. I also expect either a B1G regular season title or tournament title. IT's going to be a great year though!  Hockey: We lose a lot of guys, but the way last season ended I don't think expectations are that high. The program could use a spark though, as attendance has been down and we haven't really won all that much lately. Is Eaves on the hot seat?"
WisconsinBadgers,2bywwf,Kobe_AYEEEEE,1 point,Mon Jul 28 21:17:39 2014 UTC,"Football- We should be in the title game of the B1G, but only on a weak division, and once we're there a win would probably put us in the four team bracket. Getting a win, however, would be a different story. Absolutely no way Stave outduels Miller if it comes down to it, so we will need a very good defense this year. We'll be relying a lot on Gordon and Henry, and our starting QB is going to need to exceed expectations. That's a best case scenario.  Basketball- I think we have as good a chance at winning the 'ship as anyone. If Sam Dekker has developed as much as everyone has been saying and Nigel and Frank fine tune their games, the sky is the limit. In terms of recruiting, Getting Stone or Ellenson would be massive, and if we get one it might encourage the other. That along with Sharma would give us our best class ever alone."

WisconsinBadgers,2bejh6,vatoniolo,5,Tue Jul 22 19:41:04 2014 UTC,"When Wisco runs they use power which means man-to-man blocking. When you see guards running downhill (i.e. where the linebackers and secondary lined up) you know it's a power blocking scheme. This is something Wisco does better than any other team in the country as we have big and fast O-linemen. Or, if the guards pull (i.e. run to the other side of the line where the RB is heading) you can also see a lot of power blocking. Think of it as a ""hat on a hat"" when you watch it. Zone blocking is better suited to passing. In zone blocking, if someone comes in your area, fend them off long enough for the ball to be away.

Wisconsin upset Denver 3-1, and two of those goals (possibly all three - I don't remember) were scored within 5-10 seconds of a Wisconsin touchdown. Football won the Big Ten, and men's hockey started an 11-game unbeaten streak.  I'll remember those double-doses of happiness (to go along with our chicken wings) for a long time.

WisconsinBadgers,2as2w5,MasterLink87,2,Tue Jul 15 18:54:24 2014 UTC,Sounds good.  Hope some targets develop.
WisconsinBadgers,2akxqg,GryffinDART,11,Sun Jul 13 13:05:17 2014 UTC,"You have chosen well.  Melvin Gordon may be the most exciting running back in college football. He averaged 7.8 yards per carry last year. James White, who is in the NFL now, and him combined for 3000 yards last year.   Our quarterback for now is Joel Stave. He can be extremely frustrating with inconsistency, but can lead a drive if he has to.   The one thing you should know about the Badgers is our stellar offensive line. Year after year we just get the best o-line recruits, and they tear it up.   As for if we are contenders, if our defense can step it up after losing solid players in Chris Borland and Dez Southward, we have a legitimate chance.   Welcome to the Badgers! Enjoy the show!"
WisconsinBadgers,2akxqg,dabeavers,4,Sun Jul 13 13:31:59 2014 UTC,"Agree with everything this wise person has said.  I would add about our O-line that the big boys on it consistently outweigh all but a few of the NFL O-lines (I have failed at finding a source but I promise this is true ha, at least in past years).  We consistently have members of the O-line drafted early as well.  Our biggest struggle this year offensively might be to fill the place of WR Jared Abbrederis (Just drafted by the pack as you probably know).  We lacked a true WR2 behind him last year and now someone needs to step up, and I certainly can't think of anyone currently on the team that could do it, but I am hopeful.  That combined with Stave's inconsistency may make for a frustrating air attack.  The defense has always been the lesser of the two sides.  I'm not super knowledgeable about recruits, hopefully someone can fill in that gap, but we certainly need someone new to step up and make some big plays to contend with the other high-powered offenses in the Big 10.  As far as being contenders this year, I'd say absolutely!  Our running can take us extremely far and if the rest of the team is good enough to back it up we can certainly contend with the Ohio and Michigan States of the world for another Big 10 title.  As far as a big time bowl game is concerned, or any bowl game for that matter, I struggle to have faith after our recent stretch of bad luck (those 3 rose bowl losses hurt like hell...).  Bonus for this year: Maryland and Rutgers are joining the Big 10, and they bring with them a whole new audience from the east coast.  It should be very interesting to see how they fit into the conference and see if any new rivalries spring up.  Glad to have a new Badger fan around!  You picked a great team with a long history to get behind, welcome.  GO BUCKY"

WisconsinBadgers,2akxqg,redhatfilm,4,Sun Jul 13 22:15:14 2014 UTC,"This is a writeup me and a couple guys did last year before the season. It'll pretty much everything.   http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1ep303/132_teams_132_days_wisconsin/  Now, we're in a very similar position - our O-line is still incredible, our running backs are incredible, but we don't really know how passing works."
WisconsinBadgers,2akxqg,hotcarl23,3,Mon Jul 14 02:05:32 2014 UTC,"Wisconsin generally doesn't recruit great, but pretty solid.  The team consistently finishes much better than their recruiting class.  Most of this is thanks to keeping players on four or five years and developing them well.  The heart of the team has been the offensive line, which usually consists of in-state big bodies or overlooked big guys from other parts of the country.   They have also had great success from walk-ons.  The team's current success dates back to 1989, when second-year c chancellor Donna Shalala saw the importance of sports for the school and hired athletic director Pat Richter. In 1990 Richter brought in Notre Dame assistant Barry Alvarez, who led the team to three Big Ten titles and Rose Bowl victories (11 bowl visits total) through 2006.  Priorr to Alvarez, the team had only been to six bowl games, hadn't had a willing season since 1984, and hadn't won the Big Ten since 1962.  In 2007, Alvarez resigned from the head coaching position and made first-year defensive coordinator Brett Bielema the head coach.  Bielema led the team to three Rose bowls, but lost all three and left for ARkansas in 2012.  We generally do not like Bielema for his surprise exit and fabricated reasoning.  We also dislike his wife, mostly for her Twitter comments. The team's current coach is Gary Andersen, who was previously Utah State's head coach.  Andersen is a very well-liked player's coach. As /u/dabeavers stated, the success of this year's team will come down to how well the defense rebounds to losing key defensive players, and quarterback play.  Incumbant Joel Stave was very frustrating to watch last year, and relied heavily on the talents of departed Wide Receiver Jared Abbrederis.  With that being said, Quarterback play was much worse when he went out with injuries each of the past two years.  There is hope for second year JuCo transfer Tanner McEvoy, who is more of an athletic threat, but also more raw and doesn't have Stave's arm.  Behind McEvoy is the highly recruited Bart Houston, who has thus far been a pretty big disapointment.  There is a lot of hope for true freshman DJ Gillins, although he is extremely raw at this point.  The wide receiving corpse that these quarterbacks will have to work with are very unproven and may provide little help.  While running back Melvin Gordon is the star of the team, other big players are running back Corey Clement, offensive linemen Rob Havenstein and Kyle Costigan, defensive tackle Will Herring, linebacker Derek Landisch, and defensive backs Sojourn Shelton and Michael Caputo. The team is considered a contender this year because of their easy schedule after opening the season against LSU.  If they can get a respectable passing game and the defense doesn't fall apart, it could be a great season. Here are a couple of my favorite team links:  Scout Forums  Badger247, the latest and best recruiting info  Welcome aboard and wish to a great season!"
WisconsinBadgers,2akxqg,SourCabbage,2,Sun Jul 13 17:15:01 2014 UTC,"As others have said, O-line and RB are never a concern.  TE is probably fine too.  We seem pretty good at drafting TEs that manage to do what's needed.  I actually expect us to be just fine at QB.  Sure Stave can be frustratingly inconsistent, but statistically he's really a pretty good QB.  He can't be worse this year and he'll have better competition for the position, too.  The big question is WR.  Not sure what's going on here or why we can't seem to draft talent at that position.  I don't expect our defense to have any problems.  it may even improve from last year since most of them will be back with more experience.  Sure Borland is gone, but he was out for a little last season with injury and his backup stepped up marvelously, putting up Borland-like numbers; could end up being even better than Borland as he develops his football IQ.  We have promising recruits for our secondary, so I'm not worried about the loss of Southward either."
WisconsinBadgers,2akxqg,Last-Socratic,2,Mon Jul 14 03:13:37 2014 UTC,"Barry Alvarez is a legend, and turned the team around quite a few years back. He is the current athletic director, and is respected throughout the NCAA as far as I have heard.  Going back before Ron Dayne and since we have a punishing running game. Countless times there has been dual 100+ yard rushers in a single game. This is all because of the O-Line and their coaching.  Jump Around is something you have to experience, and 5th quarter.

WisconsinBadgers,2akxqg,franklin_stubbs,2,Wed Jul 16 23:50:59 2014 UTC,"I posted this is another thread today:  Three returning defensive players looks really scary (for Badger fans) on paper, but there are a lot of good pieces back there to work with. CB Sojurn Shelton is one of hte best in the league and could take a huge step forward. Having a lockdown CB helps the entire rest of the D, as the line gets more time to get to the QB and safeties can come up to load the box knowing he's OK one-on-one. FS Michael Caputo really made his precense known last year. He lines up in the box often and can get after the QB and running backs on the outside. I expect him to turn into our biggest play maker. DTs Warren Herring and Conrad Zegzebski are seniors who have played a lot. There's still experience there. oLBs Vince Biegel and Leon Jacobs are both sophomores nad should be beasts for the D. Biegel was a very highly rated recruit and played quality minutes last year, while Jacobs was little-known out of high school (focused on basketball until his junior year or so when he picked up football) but is an insane athlete. Badger fans remember him running down Melvin Gordon from behind in last year's spring game. Not many starting defensive players on other teams could do that. So on paper it looks like our D will struggle, but there's still a decent amount of talent and experience there. Obviously losing Borland will hurt though."

It raised over 65,000 dollars.  Photo album from the Badgers facebook page  Here are the rosters, which featured numerous NHL and other professional players.  In case anyone was wondering, Derek Stepan still had the jaw guard thing, and yes, Geoffrion did play.  Current Wisconsin goaltender Joel Rumpel was the goalie for the red team.  This event could not have been any better. Brian Posick and Rob Andringa introduced the teams, and cracked jokes about the players as they were introduced. They also conducted in-game interviews from the bench.  Brian Elliot left his net to join the rush at one point, and got an assist.  (Towards the end of the game, he did it again, but started screening Rumpel, the opposing goaltender.)  All penalties were penalty shots, and at one point, there was some trickery, and Red stole White's penalty shot...the refs went full WWE mode on that one.  This is what happened with about half a minute to go. Earlier in the game, a too many men on the ice penalty was called, but the refs let this one go.  Mix in world-class hockey talent (not that they were giving maximum effort, but there were some flashy plays) with the shenanigans, and it was incredible.

This is one of the few times where I almost completely agree with Rittenberg. I'm not sure we have a single legitimate threat at wide receiver and have lost some key pieces on the defense.  I'm not overly worried, because it seems like we have people step up and perform every single year we have a large exodus of players. That's just the result of having a lot of redshirts and playing mostly upper classmen.  Despite our system, I really don't see where all the confidence is coming from.

The defense wouldn't be great, but it would be tough to out-score these guys."

Love this team."
WisconsinBadgers,26suew,Azzmo,2,Thu May 29 22:26:34 2014 UTC,"Landry always seemed kind of limited to me, somehow. It wasn't really based on numbers, just a sense; maybe because he didn't do much from 3.   We put together a very similar team and I had to go with Okey's explosiveness and Leuer's all around game over Tucker's amazingness and Landry's meh-ness."
WisconsinBadgers,26suew,Jewtheist,3,Thu May 29 23:43:41 2014 UTC,Yeah that's fair. Landry is 5th all time in blocks and had a good offensive game--I didnt really know most of the SF  candidates to be honest.

There was quite a few college coaches that came to see him (Dean Smith, etc).  He was good...damn good, maybe even next level good for his age.  But man was his head up his ass.  Your post made me go look what he's up to...cutting hair in Wausau, I guess.  It's sad."
WisconsinBadgers,26suew,Azzmo,3,Fri May 30 03:01:04 2014 UTC,"I wonder what he'd say now. I've always had the impression that matches your read on him: NBA talent and all time Badger great potential. Hell, if Tyler Hansbrough can make a career in the league then a psychologically sound Okey could have excelled.   Didn't he get fat or something?"

Published March 11th, 2014.   “To be honest, I wouldn’t change anything. When I transferred to Iowa, I met some great people and made friends over there. I played overseas, I had a chance to try out for the NBA, but it didn’t happen,” said Okey, who is married, lives in Schofield and is a hairstylist with Absolute Hair in Wausau. “I have no regrets. I have nothing but fond memories looking back on my high school career.”"

There's way too many names to put dollar values on them all, but how about you get $3.00 and guys who were never starters cost $0.50, guys who were impact reserves and/or started a handful of games cost $1.00  So to go along with my starters I'd want a bench of:   G Tanner Bronson - $0.50  G Travon Davis - $1.00  F Mo Linton - $1.00  F/C Andreas Helmigk - $0.50  C Greg Steimsma - $1.00"

Yes, he sustained and built upon, to some degree, the success of Barry Alvarez's time at Wisconsin. Got us B1G championships, got us to BCS bowls, got some great recruits, and of course the master stroke of signing Russell Wilson.  And then you look at the Rose Bowl. Prior to Bielema, Wisconsin was a Rose Bowl over-achiever. We were never favored to win any of the 3 90's Rose Bowls. But we did it 3 times. Then Bielema came along. Every time the spotlight was on Bucky, he'd make a dumb call, or waste a timeout, or not use a timeout when he should've, etc - and we lose 3 Rose Bowls in a row. And now people feel free to punk us about the Rose Bowl.   As much credit as Bielema deserves for the good he did at Wisconsin, he's forever left a bad taste in my mouth for turning us from a Rose Bowl standout into a Rose Bowl stagnant...among other things.   End of rant, but that is a cool piece. Just pisses me off how much damage he did to our rep"

Only a couple, but when most of the nation doesn't like you much in the first place, it's easy for them to remember.   But we had the last laugh :)   I'm making this comment though, to commend that writer. How many national writers spout off their bullshit 100% of the time and don't concede that they were wrong even once? Have any of the buffoons on ESPN ever acknowledged when they were utterly wrong? Not that I recall. And this guy has a vested interest against us, as a rival. But still, he took his medicine. So good on him.   I can't wait to hand Sparty their ass in Madison next year. On Wisconsin"
WisconsinBadgers,22kmsi,irishbadger,1 point,Wed Apr 9 02:15:50 2014 UTC,I don't see him being the starter.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I just see this as a transitional year where Andersen tries some things with his new recruits (especially Gillins and Krenwick Sanders).  Guess it just depends on how quickly they can step in.
WisconsinBadgers,22kmsi,b4dger,1 point,Wed Apr 9 02:46:24 2014 UTC,Gillins is not good enough to start yet. It will be one of Stave or McEvoy.
WisconsinBadgers,22kmsi,drumbum2013,1 point,Sun Apr 13 02:44:05 2014 UTC,"Hey, I got a question about the Badger offense. I think Andersen is a defense coach by trade, right? However, I believe his team at Utah State ran a spread offense. Is Andersen implementing the same or a similar offense in Madison? Will it be a run-based spread option (similar to OSU's?)    Buckeye fan here btw"
WisconsinBadgers,22kmsi,SEC_North,1 point,Fri Apr 25 23:41:54 2014 UTC,"Those are all questions I think we're waiting to find out too. Stave can't run a spread, but Gillins might be able to.  We don't have the receivers yet, but Sanders is a start.  The next couple years will be interesting to see how Andersen molds this team."
WisconsinBadgers,22kmsi,b4dger,1 point,Fri Apr 25 23:48:50 2014 UTC,"So he's kinda just going along with what he has, and taking his time to get what he wants. That's what good coaches do. That's what Meyer did in '12 too."
WisconsinBadgers,22kmsi,SEC_North,1 point,Fri Apr 25 23:53:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah. The big difference this year was a switch to a 3-4 defense. It worked pretty well and he went and got a few DT recruits coming in for next year. This year he kept the offense status quo, but I see that changing a little bit year by year. Nothing drastic, but enhancing areas where we typically lack athletes - QB and WR."
WisconsinBadgers,22gj34,lejeuneytunes,1 point,Mon Apr 7 21:10:57 2014 UTC,Can we get a TL;DR
WisconsinBadgers,22gj34,daymankarate,3,Tue Apr 8 03:26:36 2014 UTC,"Wisconsin draws in much less talent than other national programs (like Kentucky) so expectations should naturally be tempered.  However, Ryan still has a fantastic winning percentage and has performed well in March Madness, despite his lack of a title, so he should be considered one of the best of his era."
WisconsinBadgers,22hkm4,towehaal,7,Tue Apr 8 03:35:01 2014 UTC,Absolutely. But give UConn credit. They beat a LOT of really good teams. And they certainly slowed down Kentucky better than we did.
WisconsinBadgers,22hkm4,dradam168,3,Tue Apr 8 13:10:34 2014 UTC,"Could we?  Absolutely.  This Badgers team is as good or better than any team in the nation.  Would we?  Maybe.  UConn, Napier especially, was on fire."

Even if we are bigger and better next year, its all about a team playing great at the right time and who knows if we'll get back to the Final Four anytime soon.

WisconsinBadgers,22bjfy,-DG-,12,Sun Apr 6 10:52:18 2014 UTC,I expected us to get to the elite 8. I said before the tournament that if they got to the final 4 I'd be ecstatic and they did it. I'm extremely proud of this team.
WisconsinBadgers,22bjfy,pianobadger,7,Sun Apr 6 04:10:37 2014 UTC,"Exceeded expectations, gave us more hope than we have had for basketball in a long time, and for once didn't let us down in the second weekend (or, god forbid, the first).  And our only major loss is Ben Brust.  Granted, he is going to be very hard to replace, but with all the other talent we've got coming back (Nigel, Frank, Sam, Traevon, Duje, Bronson, and Josh), I have higher hopes for next season than I have had in quite a while.  Here's hoping they can build on what they did this year.  On Wisconsin."

WisconsinBadgers,22bjfy,daymankarate,4,Sun Apr 6 05:14:42 2014 UTC,"Well there are at least five NBA players on that team. We potentially have two, so I don't think that was such a bold statement to make."

WisconsinBadgers,22bjkq,xylltch,14,Sun Apr 6 03:32:45 2014 UTC,"Honestly it looked like their calls were pretty consistent, just Kentucky put themselves in a position to benefit from it more than our style of play allowed."
WisconsinBadgers,22bjkq,ShabazzJenkins,7,Sun Apr 6 03:41:43 2014 UTC,Yeah there were some bad calls (Dekker getting called on that And-one dunk by Kentucky) but Wisconsin blew the game clear and simple. That's what hurts the most. 2 turnovers back to back with less than 3 minutes was killer along with playing too tentatively. Kentucky gave UW a ton of opportunities but they never took advantage.  This one stings.
WisconsinBadgers,22bjkq,Jdog2010,4,Sun Apr 6 05:06:08 2014 UTC,"There calls were consistent, but they were made in a way so that neither team could play defense.  I'm not claiming that the refs calls benefited Kentucky, nor am I claiming they benefited us.  But any time an attacking player initiated contact with a planted defender, it was a defensive foul.  Half of the clean strips and blocks were called defensive fouls.  Often any jockeying for position inside the arc was called a defensive foul as well.  They just weren't letting them play defense, and even if they were calling it consistently, I still have a problem with that."
WisconsinBadgers,22bjkq,JLyons043,7,Sun Apr 6 05:04:43 2014 UTC,Good luck Connecticut. Dealing with a team who's in the double bonus with 4 minutes left... So many bullshit and 1s that were all ball

God Damn man Stop being a little bitch. look over the full game and find places that the badgers did not do what they should have, you will find the reason this was only a 1 pt game. It was called on both teams. Calls were missed both ways. These two teams were very evenly matched and this was one great game! Yea the calls were tough but we adapted to them and so did Kentucky, this is not a game you can blame the refs for. So please just stop ""being that guy..."""

It's streetball where you only play with defensive fouls."

WisconsinBadgers,22bjkq,Last-Socratic,3,Sun Apr 6 11:17:00 2014 UTC,They shouldn't have passed to him.  There was no way he was going to make it.  He looked increasingly tense as the game neared its end.  The BS blocking calls on him and missed free throw destroyed his confidence.  Anyone else on the team would have had a better chance at sinking the game winner.

WisconsinBadgers,220nwv,jack3moto,4,Wed Apr 2 21:04:09 2014 UTC,"That was one person who mentioned white boys. And their team IS more athletic, longer, faster, etc., why wouldn't they be psyched to play a man defense? They literally have a dream team stocked with NBA prospects who get to the rim and either finish, or draw enough D to get a tip-in.   The main sin most people make, not just Kentucky fans, is mistaking a lack of size speed and slashing ability for a lack of talent. The way Gasser plays D is talent. The way Brust scraps for rebounds is talent. The way the entire team plays defense together to take away the paint and the 3-point shot is talent."
WisconsinBadgers,220nwv,Jewtheist,3,Wed Apr 2 22:29:18 2014 UTC,Try dating one.... Sigh.
WisconsinBadgers,21xphb,neboo11,2,Tue Apr 1 16:46:02 2014 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing per se that it will be an important area for us, only that you have to remember what we've faced in tourney to this point is a far cry from what we'll face vs KY:   Baylors Guards: 5'11"", 6'2"", 6'2""  vs ours: 6'1"", 6'2"", 6'3"" and 6'3"" then vs KY's guards: 6'0"", 6'6"", 6'6"", 6'6""   slight differential in height.  Also, KY's guards rebound less because Randle eats them all up. KY outrebounds us 41-33 per game, and Randle has more Offensive Rebounds per game than our top two guys combined.  Luckily Cauley-Stein is probably not going to play--if you add him in, him and Randle's Off Reb #s (combined 230) exceed the sum of our Top 5 offensive rebounders."
WisconsinBadgers,21xphb,lemurosity,2,Tue Apr 1 22:35:19 2014 UTC,"Very nice input. I think that the height difference is negated a little bit more with guards, since on longer rebounds it is about playing the bounce and technique, which can help the shorter guys, but you have a good point.  I am just really excited to see how this game goes down. I remember being terrified of playing a really athletic team in Baylor and that ended up be no issue at all. I know this will be tougher, but I think they can do it."
WisconsinBadgers,21xphb,unmisunderestimated,2,Wed Apr 2 01:33:14 2014 UTC,Kentucky also sends a lot to the offensive glass so fast break opportunities are there if the guards can rebound and push.  Another thing to remember is that long shots create long rebounds. Forcing jump shots will help keep rebounds out of Randle's and D. Jackson's hands.
WisconsinBadgers,21w2qr,unmisunderestimated,3,Tue Apr 1 03:13:07 2014 UTC,Anderson?? No.

WisconsinBadgers,21w2qr,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Tue Apr 1 12:39:52 2014 UTC,No reason other than his size and length would force Randle to attack differently.
WisconsinBadgers,21w2qr,Jewtheist,2,Tue Apr 1 12:56:12 2014 UTC,"Please stop this ""size"" and ""length"" bullshit. There's much more to basketball than that. Evan Anderson can't move his feet. Kentucky would just go right at him, make the basket and get fouled. It would end terribly."
WisconsinBadgers,21w2qr,sbrylski,2,Tue Apr 1 13:19:00 2014 UTC,You can't completely disregard physical attributes. The point I'm trying to make is than Randle has shown the ability to score by bulling his way to the basket and that Anderson is harder to move than anyone else on the team.
WisconsinBadgers,21vohe,nmccauleyUW,2,Tue Apr 1 00:54:14 2014 UTC,you'd be way better off asking 'what's a good sports bar' in the /r/cleveland sub
WisconsinBadgers,21vohe,Whiskonsin,1 point,Tue Apr 1 03:44:30 2014 UTC,Sports bars and reviews are plentiful on Google.  I've had less luck finding the kind of Wisconsin-specific bars that are common in cities like Chicago.    I was hoping for the off-chance that someone knew of a corner bar that might not have a significant web presence or one that doesn't advertise as a Badger bar but happens to be a congregation point.
WisconsinBadgers,21vohe,Whiskonsin,1 point,Tue Apr 1 03:55:22 2014 UTC,maybe these would be a good start? http://www.packerseverywhere.com/bars or http://www.packer-bars.com/
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,cheese4brains,4,Mon Mar 31 17:16:21 2014 UTC,"All eyes are on the Badgers right now.  That includes top recruits in every state.  These kids want to be a part of successful programs where they can be the star.  That being said, IMO Bo Ryan and the recruiting staff are masters at finding the right fits for the system.  We don't need raw talent to be successful.  We need players that can fill a role that requires them to play inside out. (Frank Kaminsky, John Leuer, Jared Berggren)  I think it would be crazy to think that this final four run wouldn't help recruiting.  We just don't need the type of player that wants all the attention on them.  As for Diamond Stone, he is monster on the inside and we would find a way to use him.  I just don't think he fits the system."
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,thebenron,3,Mon Mar 31 18:13:02 2014 UTC,"Doesn't fit the system how? The lack of an imposing post game has been the problem with this team since Mike Wilkinson, it's not a coincidence that the emergence of Hayes and Kaminsky as a paint threat coincide with a deep tournament run."
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,whachuneed,2,Tue Apr 1 15:43:58 2014 UTC,"Totally agree but I think it is post DEFENSE that could put the orogram near the very top consistently.  Could you imagine this team if it had an athletic rim protector? Diamond is exactly this and he would flourish at the UW and so would the team.  I really hope he sees this.  Frank is quickly adding this dimesion, but he does have some physical limitations.  Still from start of season to now, I am in awe of how much much his defense has improved in all areas ~ one on one, help d, and playing the on ball screens with jackson.  Those guys both deserve lots of credit, and i wish jackson got more.  He is always a targetvof criticsm so he should also get heaps of praisecwhen he plays this damn well."
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,TripelNova,4,Wed Apr 2 03:10:42 2014 UTC,"Bo Ryan's system is geared towards developing underappreciated talent. And more importantly, he won't guarantee that big star recruits will play much as true freshman. I believe that's why we couldn't keep Vander Blue in Madison.  Overall, I think more kids will give Wisconsin a longer look, but I don't think we're going to land any huge talent. Here's to hoping I'm wrong though!"
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,mrmowgli,7,Mon Mar 31 23:04:01 2014 UTC,I thought Vander blue left because he got like a 15 on his ACT and we wanted him to take summer courses
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,BIRDERofDaYR3XinaRoW,3,Tue Apr 1 00:27:59 2014 UTC,I hope diamond stone comes to Wisconsin. He won't regret it and we'll be competing for the crown yet again next year. Dekker needs to step his game up for the final four he's been awesome defensively but he needs to rep that Sheboygan offense now.
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,whachuneed,1 point,Mon Mar 31 19:01:59 2014 UTC,"Hes class of 15, so not next year.  Hed come in as bronson and nigel are becoming seasoning stars, hopefully dekker improving also and having a huge senior season."

WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,WiscDC,2,Tue Apr 1 03:00:29 2014 UTC,"A ton.  I've always joked that Sam Dekker was not meant to be a Badger, because he's too much of a star recruit.  The image of this program is rising above just ""steadily successful."""
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,lemurosity,2,Mon Mar 31 17:57:51 2014 UTC,"Stone, Ellenson, Sharma and Jarvis Johnson have the makings of a pretty good class if they all come in.  Might get a SG (flip Jordan?) but I think the reality is that the real effect of this year, and going into next year as a Top 5 team and the clear favorite in the B1G, will be seen in the 2016 class.  The converse side of all this is: how much longer is Bo gonna coach?   7-8 more years gets him to 900 wins (196 or so short now), which is a nice club to be in, but who knows."
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,whachuneed,1 point,Tue Apr 1 22:57:22 2014 UTC,Pretty good class? This is highly unlikey to happen but if it did it would be the #1 class in the country based on today's evals I believe.
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,lemurosity,1 point,Wed Apr 2 03:16:04 2014 UTC,"Top 5, Top 50 and two Top 100 guys would be a Top 10 class for sure. KY (Charles Matthews in hand, faves for Newman, Labissiere and Bragg) AZ (already has Dorsey, faves for Rabb and Zimmerman), Cuse and Kansas are all looking very strong for 2015. Sean Miller is going to be running the West Coast for the next decade btw.  But yeah sorry that was kinda my point in the first place--Bo is doing just fine, and given (a) the system and (b) our academic constraints, I'm not sure how much better we can do aside from keeping guys like Tokoto, Looney and Stone at home (which obviously helps)."
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,gerkenjerken,1 point,Wed Apr 2 08:11:14 2014 UTC,"I'd put us at extremely lucky to get 2 of those four. Big Henry and Jarvis would be my best guesses. I don't think we flip Aaron Jordan. I think after those two we might be looking at Matt Heldt from Neenah as a project. It'd be nice to have some bodies come in, after losing George and only bringing in Ethan Happ this class."
WisconsinBadgers,21uc87,lemurosity,1 point,Wed Apr 2 05:22:45 2014 UTC,"I'd say we're in front for all but Stone right now and guess is he'll be on Tobacco Road. I don't think we get Jordan either, only saying that if our run this month has any impact on 2015, that might be the one guy we were in on. Maybe Nick Noskowiak, but I'm guessing with Wojo coming over he'll stick with MU."

I figured that was left to the Dukes and Kentuckys of the world. But here we are and ESPN is saying Kaminsky could be the best offensive player in the nation! It's just crazy seeing these guys that I've always seen around campus on national TV in this light. Can't wait for Saturday.

WisconsinBadgers,21snyq,1curlygurl,5,Mon Mar 31 03:01:20 2014 UTC,I'll say it is actually very strange to hear so much positivity and compliments about one of our teams....  I also cant think of a time where a #2 seed was being considered by some to be the cinderella.  All the credit in the world to Coach Ryan and his staff.   I get the feeling Kentucky is already looking at Florida.  This team is good enough and well coached enough to end that
WisconsinBadgers,21snyq,saucyjack34,3,Mon Mar 31 06:45:32 2014 UTC,"The best part of this Final Four run is that this puts Wisconsin ON THE MAP. Coach Ryan, in my eyes, has consistently been the best coach in the B1G for the better part of a decade, assembling mid-talent level teams into tournament contenders. In this one year, where we actually have great talent all-around, we make a championship run. I have no doubt that recruiting is going to pick up and Badger basketball is going to improve moving forward"

WisconsinBadgers,21nblk,BuckyCop,4,Sat Mar 29 03:21:26 2014 UTC,"Deep down I thought this was the year. We were stacked with seniors. We had a bunch of juniors. We were the best we could be on paper. And then we crapped the bed. Sure, homer fans will say "" But BuckyCop, we played NoDak, we had a hard match."" Hey I agree, it was a tough game. However we played BAD. McCabe had the worst game of his collegiate career. That giveaway was inexcusable and it cost us dearly. Rumpel was pedestrian in the first two periods. He came up big in the third, but the damage was done. He played his worst games in the B1G tourney and NCAA game.   I am coming to terms with this 4 seed embarrassment. I thought the seniors in particular were not very hungary for a win. We looked like we did all year on the road, a team playing from behind and not overly concerned. Eaves better step up too. Two years of first round exits is not good. Great we won the first B1G trophy, who cares? People remember National Titles. We better hope Minnesota doesn't win and tie us with titles, or it will be a sad realization for Badger fans who have become lethargic in hockey.  Celebrate victories, dissect defeat and NEVER let it happen again. I wish the seniors well and I'm glad they are gone. It's time for younger players with more hunger for victory to take over. I hope someday Bucky is relevant in the National Tourney. I was a student the last time they won and it was awesome. It has been close to 10 years now of disappointment.  Sorry for the rant, just hate when my beloved team plays as bad they did, they were so much better than what the showed tonight..."

The more I think about it, the more annoying it is, and the more I think, ""that...that wasn't supposed to happen...how stupid!""  On a positive note, Rumpel came up to a few fans at the hotel to personally thank them for coming and supporting the team...he only becomes more and more likeable."
WisconsinBadgers,21m9kk,WiscDC,2,Fri Mar 28 19:51:09 2014 UTC,It's going to be a tough one tonight. Need to start better than the other team for once. Do work Rumpz!
WisconsinBadgers,21kdlh,Niehaus,13,Fri Mar 28 03:29:01 2014 UTC,Holy crap. The Badgers just dominated the shit out of Baylor tonight.

WisconsinBadgers,21cjgq,NewSCDodgeguy,9,Tue Mar 25 19:38:52 2014 UTC,"Well Baylor did look pretty damn good against Creighton so can't really fault the guy for the pick. I feel like it is just because Wisconsin lost to lower seeds in the past like (12) Ole Miss, (8) Butler (hard to include this one, but still lost to lower seed), (12) Cornell, and (10) Davidson. Stereotypes form and people think Wisconsin is good in the Big Ten, but in tournament time finds a way to lose to a team they should beat."
WisconsinBadgers,21cjgq,Herpesdeep,2,Tue Mar 25 20:35:19 2014 UTC,"Is there a top team from a power conference who hasn't lost to a handful of lower seeds in the past several years?   I think the perception, if it exists, is because Wisconsin is always in it but never wins the title so people always remember them losing."
WisconsinBadgers,21cjgq,unmisunderestimated,2,Wed Mar 26 02:40:16 2014 UTC,"All in all, this seemed like a pretty fair-minded assessment of the West region.    He sure wasn't enthusiastic about his ""bold prediction.""    More like: ""eh, this could happen."""
WisconsinBadgers,21cjgq,MaximumDestruction,1 point,Tue Mar 25 23:54:50 2014 UTC,"Oregon showed that Wisconsin can be limited on the offensive end. We ended up with 85 points, which is obviously good, but there were long stretches where we looked horrible (not moving without the ball, not able to create separation from defenders). Baylor, meanwhile, has a 1-3-1 zole that has looked phenomenal, and has been great offensively on the interior, which is exactly where we are weak.   I don't think there is some conspiracy against the Badgers. The fact of the matter is that right now, Baylor is looking and playing like a better version of an Oregon team that really pushed us to the brink. They also just came off of an utter dismantlement of a Creighton team that has a similar playing style to ours.   When you have shown over the years that you cannot be trusted in the tournament, and that you are weak against long, athletic teams, and you are playing in the tournament against a team who is long, athletic, and very hot, these sorts of picks will occur.   (pardon me if my nervousness is showing)"
WisconsinBadgers,21cjgq,bigoleguy,0,Thu Mar 27 02:15:07 2014 UTC,"It also drives me nuts that the ""experts"" talk about WI like they move at a snail pace and are looking to play 39-36 final score games.  And I'm just sitting there yelling at my TV, ""have you even watched a Badger game this year?"""
WisconsinBadgers,21cjgq,MaximumDestruction,1 point,Tue Mar 25 19:59:40 2014 UTC,"The answer is probably: no, they haven't.    Maybe caught one of the early non-conference games against Virginia or Florida in which we scored 59 and 48 pts."
WisconsinBadgers,21avre,daymankarate,7,Tue Mar 25 06:05:08 2014 UTC,"How many teams can you say are led by a great coach, with 5 starters (plus a 6th man) who can all get buckets, who don't really care who scores, who don't turn the ball over or commit fouls, who play great good defense, and who can play at any pace? I think they have a great shot.   They're going to need to stop having 5-10 minute stretches of incompetence in the face of tough D though. The Badgers will probably always find themselves with a ""3:21 and counting since last field goal"" graphic popping up, but it's really gotta stop at 4 minutes.  I really love this team though."
WisconsinBadgers,21avre,Jewtheist,5,Tue Mar 25 07:23:26 2014 UTC,The second half of the Oregon game convinced me that we've got what it takes. That was what a champion turning it on and blowing a lesser opponent out of the building looks like.
WisconsinBadgers,21avre,BaseballGuyCAA,3,Tue Mar 25 16:27:04 2014 UTC,"Bo Ryan is already ahead of Avarez for me. Only because Alvarez can be a dick most of the time (first-hand experience). They definitely have a good chance, unless we get into one of those patented cold shooting streaks that the Badgers are known to have from time to time. Although those cold streaks have been at a minimum this year with much improved scoring. Bayor worries me with their big men. The Badgers can be beat when teams try to take it to the basket a lot."

WisconsinBadgers,21avre,carnbarn,1 point,Tue Mar 25 18:52:34 2014 UTC,Looking pretty good right now after the win over Baylor. One more big step!
WisconsinBadgers,2177ny,unmisunderestimated,5,Mon Mar 24 02:50:33 2014 UTC,"Baylor is a though match-up but they all are at this stage, right?  I watched what I could handle of the BU-Creighton game and came away impressed with BU. Brust and Hayes will be key.  Hayes is reliable at 15-17 feet.  If Frank the Tank can create space by moving outside and there should be ample passing lanes through the zone."
WisconsinBadgers,2177ny,NewSCDodgeguy,1 point,Mon Mar 24 18:23:07 2014 UTC,Hayes is reliable from anywhere but the free throw line.  I think he's more frustrating than Ryan Evans was last year simply because he gets so many free throw attempts.
WisconsinBadgers,2177ny,Tuggernuts23,3,Mon Mar 24 19:23:57 2014 UTC,They all need to hit the free throws. That bug is scary. Frank can't hit them down the stretch lately either.
WisconsinBadgers,2177ny,NewSCDodgeguy,1 point,Mon Mar 24 20:58:30 2014 UTC,"Creighton didn't play a smart game. I watched it today and was surprised at the poor decision making. They'd get into the middle of the defense, panic, and pass it out right away before the defense even reacted to the ball in the middle.  I think Baylor will play Wisconsin a lot like they played Creighton; crowd the 3 pt line. That will open up driving lanes for Jackson's patented elbow jumper (how many game winners has he made from there?). And Dekker/Kaminsky/Hayes from 12 feet will force Austin to move away from the basket and open up passing lanes for cutters from the corner."
WisconsinBadgers,2177ny,irishbadger,2,Wed Mar 26 02:31:13 2014 UTC,"I've been worried about running into a team with multiple skilled/physical big men from the start and that's exactly what we ran into.  Kaminsky and Hayes are all we have down low.  If one of them gets into foul trouble, I could see things go very wrong against this team.  That being said, I think we have enough skill to beat any team in the tournament. I also saw a ton of heart from this team on Saturday night.  I'm so pumped for Thursday. FUCK DA BEARS.

WisconsinBadgers,214fyf,carnbarn,2,Sun Mar 23 03:33:37 2014 UTC,The rally after halftime was incredible. Not the first time in the last couple weeks we've come out from the break on a tear either.

It was infuriating!  BUT!  The badgers come out and go on a 21-6 run?!?!  Holy shit this team can play with anyone in the country.  After tonight any lingering subconscious doubts I may or may not have had have been totally put to bed.  These Badgers are FOOORRRRREEEAAAAL(basketball badgers)

WisconsinBadgers,214fyf,WiscDC,2,Sun Mar 23 03:43:17 2014 UTC,"Ohio State has been one of the more underrated teams this year, because of the bad stuff going on early on.  Throughout the second half of the season, they've proven to be a solid group."
WisconsinBadgers,214fyf,27equals-BEAST,3,Sun Mar 23 03:56:06 2014 UTC,Who's beating this team??    Villanova just got knocked off.. Lol.  Theyre the worst tournament team of all time.. Doesn't matter where theyre seeded they ALWAYS LOSE the first sweekend inexplicably.  LMAO.  We had the hardest #7 seed to deal with and we took care of business... What's their excuse?!?!  LMAO.  Just the worst tourney team ever... NVR bet on Villanova.  But anyways... Who is going to beat Wisconsin?  Baylor?  Creighton? Arizona?  Gonzaga? SDS?  I don't think so...  Gasser would LOCK Thames down for San Diego State.  That's their only scorer and theyre not keeping us off the scoreboard.  Nobody is good enough defensively to hold down our offense not even Witchita State.
WisconsinBadgers,214fyf,smiles134,3,Sun Mar 23 04:56:16 2014 UTC,Creighton looks dangerous
WisconsinBadgers,214fyf,Herpesdeep,3,Sun Mar 23 05:16:47 2014 UTC,"I just don't think we have anyone to guard McDermott. I feel Dekker is too small and would get bullied around by him and Kaminsky is too slow to guard him.  Maybe Hayes, but that would be hard for a freshman to guard one of the best all-time scores. I don't know Creighton scares me. I would much rather play Baylor, they seem inconsistent, but both teams present match up problems"
WisconsinBadgers,214fyf,smiles134,2,Sun Mar 23 14:49:43 2014 UTC,I really want Baylor to show up today but not next Thursday
WisconsinBadgers,214fyf,BuckyCop,6,Sun Mar 23 15:46:50 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I could care less about Badger basketball (but great win I heard).   However the hockey team came back from what looked like certain doom to win in overtime to claim the FIRST B1G hockey title ever! The Badgers have won back to back hockey titles (WCHA last year, B1G this year) for the first time since 1983 I believe. That is awesome. The boys battled back twice and Rumpel made some key saves down the stretch to ice it for Bucky. Edge of the seat game. Great win for both teams, but this was a CHAMPIONSHIP for the hockey team. Hope they can carry the momentum to the NCAA's now. GO BUCKY!!!  EDIT: Honestly I do care a little about the b-ball team because you know....Badgers."

WisconsinBadgers,20syk3,Dynasty471,5,Wed Mar 19 13:56:49 2014 UTC,They would lose to Creighton in the round of 16.
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,BIRDERofDaYR3XinaRoW,6,Mon Mar 17 00:21:23 2014 UTC,A lot of people like the Badgers to win their region.
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,MurDoct,5,Mon Mar 17 01:00:32 2014 UTC,I actually do hope the #2 vs. #3 seed happens in the sweet sixteen.  The Badgers are a horrible matchup for Creighton and I can't tell you how much I want to see Josh Gasser lock down the best scorer in college basketball..  With a little help from his friends of course.    If you doubt Gasser's ability just ask #1 Seed Virginia's best scorer Joe Thomas about JG and the gang.  I think his 1 for 13 shooting with Gasser attached to his hip for 35 mninutes says it all though.
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,b4dger,3,Mon Mar 17 00:30:33 2014 UTC,"I don't think enough people give Gasser credit for his lock down defense.  Maybe now that Craft is gone, he will get some credit in the B1G for defensive player of the year."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,drewskit,3,Mon Mar 17 03:14:34 2014 UTC,"Gasser was named to the All-B1G Defensive Team, I think he's getting his due credit."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,thebenron,2,Mon Mar 17 05:49:12 2014 UTC,"Gasser is no doubt an elite defender, but he's not going to be seeing much work against a 6'8"" McDermott. That's going to be a combo of Sam, Killa Kam, and Hayes. This is a discussion for next week anyway, got two tough ones ahead to worry about first."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,jpopelka,1 point,Mon Mar 17 07:30:23 2014 UTC,Love the nick name for FK. Lol.  I call him Murda Minsky.  Dude is unbelievable for us this year.  Can't even believe all these guys are coming back next year too?!?! Preseason Top 5 Badger team?!  Perhaps...
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,hegz0603,2,Mon Mar 17 15:45:03 2014 UTC,"Not sure you know much about cbb.  Gasser would never defend a guy who is a 4/5, and Joe Thomas is an all pro tackle on the Cleveland Browns.  The guy you are thinking of is Joe Harris, and he is their second leading scorer and I wouldn't call him their main guy.  Plus he went 1-10 vs the Badgers.  Look to Gasser's performance against MSU and Gary Harris (3-20) for a true scorer being shut down.  I do think Frank the tank could do work on Creighton, but they could really stretch us and McDermott could do work on our weaker interior D."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,smiles134,1 point,Mon Mar 17 17:58:51 2014 UTC,"Gasser (although a great defender) will not be guarding McDermont, who is 6'8"".  That job will likely fall on the shoulders of Dekker."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,PureBwa,2,Mon Mar 17 22:40:48 2014 UTC,"I think if Creighton loses before the round we'd face them in, we can make a good run."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,jpopelka,2,Mon Mar 17 01:35:50 2014 UTC,"1) Wisconsin was actually #8 on the S-Curve, meaning they were the 4th 2 seed.  2) Grouping Creighton in with American/BYU/Oregon/Nebraska shows how little you actually know. They have the single best player in college basketball - a guy who dropped 30 on one of the best defensive Wisconsin teams in recent memory last year.  3) Josh Gasser shut down Joe Harris. I don't think he'd have enough size to give Joe Thomas a hard time in the post."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,PureBwa,1 point,Mon Mar 17 13:51:12 2014 UTC,I watched Creighton 5 times this year.  They were constantly on ESPN.    They struggle mightily to score when Mcdermott isn't doing it all.  kinda like their last loss.  Mc had 27 but he needed to have one of his 35+ games for them to pull it off.  If you think this badger team will allow Doug Mcdermott to drop 30+ on them then that shows how little you know.  They will take him away at all costs and make the rest of that team beat them before they let him have an offensive explosion.  They do not have even close to the number of consistent scorers wisconsin has?  Do they have 6 guys averaging double figures?  Yea I didn't think so.  Creighton will be LUCKY to get by Nebraska they are extremely well coached and play fantastic on the ball defense.   And OREGON IS a tougher matchup for us than Creighton is.  That's actually a no brainer there haus..
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,NewSCDodgeguy,1 point,Mon Mar 17 15:54:43 2014 UTC,Creighton was on ESPN 3 times this year.  As a member of the Big East most of their games were televised on FOX Sports 1.  Also McDermott dropped 30 on us last year when he was a lesser player AND we had a vastly superior inner D.  Nebraska and Creighton are an 11 and 3 seed respectively for a reason.  Nebraska may not even see Creighton.
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,NewSCDodgeguy,1 point,Mon Mar 17 18:03:10 2014 UTC,"Let me try this again.  When McDermott was a junior, he dropped 30 on Evans/Bruiser/Berg. Those 3 guys, despite all their faults, were EXCELLENT defenders. That TEAM was the #1 defense in the nation (KenPom).  And now you think he won't get 30 on Dekker/Nigel/Frank/Gasser? And I'm the one who doesn't know anything?  I'm picking UW to beat Creighton, but my assumption is Dougie will get his and we'll limit everyone else. He's an absolute stud, and we don't really have anyone that matches up well with him. But Creighton has the 126th ranked defense in the country, and as long as we're not bricking wide open 3's, I expect us to score easily on them."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,27equals-BEAST,1 point,Mon Mar 17 17:05:48 2014 UTC,"I'm a fan through and through and will probably pick WI to go farther than is logical in my brackets but think we all need to focus on the first weekend.  This team is more talented than many in the past and I believe we crush American.  The second game worries me mainly because this team is still capable of looooong scoring droughts (like virtually every WI team over the past decade plus).    Nigel Hayes is so good offensively that Bo keeps putting him out there despite his defenses lapses.  Hayes needs to hit one of his first two shots to be effective.  If he misses the first two he has a bad game and so do the Badgers.  If he makes, this team can play with anyone.    That said, I'm really glad Mich St. is in the opposite region.  They are scary..."
WisconsinBadgers,20lb30,Bigwheel27,1 point,Mon Mar 17 13:39:09 2014 UTC,"rigjht.  I agree with the long scoring drought thing BUT it is way less prevelant on this team than it has been in the past.  We've seen it a little more lately but the first 16 games of the season the scoring drought stigma was nearly none existent.  As long as Wisconsin attacks and attacks with the dribble drive and doesn't get too zero'd in on the 3 point shot this team should not have any problem scoring with really good consistency.  They need to KEEP ATTACKING the basket though and that falls on Dekker, Kaminsky and Traevon.  Get in the lane and make some damn baskets.  The 3 pointers will come.  We have great shooters.  We need to stay slashing all tournament though to go DEEP."

WisconsinBadgers,203ga8,Big-FeeT,16,Tue Mar 11 00:26:38 2014 UTC,chill
WisconsinBadgers,203ga8,wisconation97,5,Tue Mar 11 00:31:42 2014 UTC,You haven't watched much of the season. He's done this all over the place. He's just not 'the guy' yet. He can still get there but everyone was too high up on him - he's just not there yet.
WisconsinBadgers,203ga8,wackywiener,3,Tue Mar 11 13:29:52 2014 UTC,Perhaps teams have identified this and are making it a key part of their defensive game plan. Thus a perceived drop in his productivity. This is also what has allowed Kaminsky to come on so strong at the end of the season. I'm sure Bo will find ways to get him more looks as the tourney starts.
WisconsinBadgers,203ga8,MasterLink87,2,Tue Mar 11 03:31:52 2014 UTC,"Dekker's just tired. He's played as a small PF most of the season and he's not really built for that. In the last 3, at least in the Penn State and Nebraska game, he has played against some big bodies that aren't afraid of contact. If he can slip back in to a SF role again he'll be able to settle into his more natural role as a cutter/shooter. He's not a guy that likes to play with his back to the basket and I think we see that catching up to him."
WisconsinBadgers,203ga8,originalcbo,2,Tue Mar 11 12:37:51 2014 UTC,"This is a GREAT point and the only one that really makes sense.  Dekker has not been ""all over the place"" as Wacky stated he actually has been, like I said, MR. Consistency.  You could count on him every night for 15 and 8 and now suddenly it drops off.    Wisconsin has played a ton of games in the last 20 days or so and most of them have been Road Games so therefore yea it makes a lot of sense that he's just tired.    He's not really built up enough to take on night after night defensively and offensively some of the gigantic and powerfully built forwards in the Big Ten.  He usually relies on his speed and quickness to out duel them and usually does but if he was tired those guys would end up winning a lot of those battles as he's really not going to out-muscle anyone..  HE needs to create some bulk this offseason to his frame and as far as the BIG TEN and NCAA Tourneys go it might not be the worst thing in the world If wisconsin has an early exit on Saturday.  That extra day of rest could mean the world to this team especially if they have a Thursday game next week in the NCAA Tourney.    I've seen almost every Badger game this season.  So it has nothing to do with how much I've watched.  It actually begs the question as how much have you watched?  There's a reason Dekker was the leading scorer for 90% of this season.  He's consistent.  SMH."

WisconsinBadgers,1yzpjg,FreelanceAbortionist,2,Wed Feb 26 18:41:14 2014 UTC,Love this pick.  Especially if Nebraska can find their way into the NCAA tournament..  It's going to take 2 or 3 more wins on their part and they really can't get embarrassed by Wisconsin in the season finale for both teams..  2 more wins in the regular season and a win in the tournament and they're in..  ANd if they're in Petteway is the B10 POY.
WisconsinBadgers,1yzpjg,Azzmo,2,Wed Feb 26 21:52:16 2014 UTC,Stauskas just had a HUGE game against MSU which pretty much wrapped up the B10 Regular Season title for them.  He had a bad game in the loss to Wisconsin but he's still very much in the hunt.
WisconsinBadgers,1yzpjg,h3llm17,2,Wed Feb 26 21:53:47 2014 UTC,The Problem with Wisconsin putting a name in the Hat for B10 POY is theyre too balanced offensively.  5 guys average double figures between 10-14 pts a game.  As far as first team ALL B10 I think they have 2 players and a player who should be considered for DPOY in Josh Gasser.  Josh Gasser is the best basketball player on this team by far.  He doez everything really well.  He defends matching up with the other teams best scorer always and he is the most clutch shooter on the Badgers since Michael Flowers...   but yea..  POY is out of reach for any individual player although Kaminsky and Dekker have had really good individual seasons especially Kaminsky.  He's been so good in the paint this year.

WisconsinBadgers,1xd2ff,BuckyCop,3,Sat Feb 8 16:34:58 2014 UTC,That glove save by Rumpel was awesome. He was ON last night.
WisconsinBadgers,1xd2ff,JulianDestroya,4,Sat Feb 8 17:37:48 2014 UTC,McCabe told Rau to take a lil' ice nap. Was anyone else rock hard during that hit?
WisconsinBadgers,1xce08,frogdawg,5,Sat Feb 8 08:14:07 2014 UTC,"And most of the students were singing along, too!  Edit: They usually do sing along, but that was pretty good for when a singer, rather than the band, was performing it."
WisconsinBadgers,1xce08,WiscDC,3,Sat Feb 8 08:16:52 2014 UTC,Ohio state Michigan state went into shoot outs so this didn't make it in tv.  Very disappointed I couldn't see it.
WisconsinBadgers,1xce08,guitmusic11,2,Sat Feb 8 17:30:31 2014 UTC,i can see my self in the picture
WisconsinBadgers,1x9441,WiscDC,4,Fri Feb 7 06:08:26 2014 UTC,"Huge win for the boys last night.  Glad I decided to go to the game. For being so many empty seats the Kohl was deafening for the last 2 minutes.  The atmosphere was like it usually is, similar to a playoff game.  I thought the Badgers came out a little slow offensively, but the defense was on all night.  Blocked shots, timely clears, and of course per usual Rumpel stood on his head with amazing saves all night.  Big 3 points last night, we just need to do it again tonight to sweep the rodents! Go Bucky!"
WisconsinBadgers,1x9441,BuckyCop,3,Fri Feb 7 12:23:30 2014 UTC,"For being so many empty seats the Kohl was deafening for the last 2 minutes.   There was an intense atmosphere all game long, reflecting the game on the ice.  If you like sports, had the opportunity to go, and didn't go, you missed out big time."
WisconsinBadgers,1x9441,BuckyCop,3,Fri Feb 7 16:20:41 2014 UTC,I haven't been to a game in a while that felt like that all game. It was edge of the seat the whole game. I also enjoyed how long they blared the goal horn on Mccabe's goal. Awesome win.
WisconsinBadgers,1x9441,Jewtheist,2,Fri Feb 7 17:04:45 2014 UTC,"I didn't even notice that the horn went longer than usual, because everyone was just going nuts."

Minnesota swept the Badgers back in the November, which was the first time either team swept the other in a weekend series in several years. (I think the last time before that was Wisconsin sweeping Minnesota in 2009.)  And that Saturday game was so close.  This is a big opportunity to make a statement!"

WisconsinBadgers,1wqtnr,2BaNinjaHero,3,Sat Feb 1 20:51:56 2014 UTC,"It happened several times last year. Four game winning our tying shots, if I'm not mistaken. We can't hit an open three to save our life, and that clogs everything else up. Frank had an open three to win the game on the previous possession, which hurt bad.   The fact is, no one on the team is clutch. No one can hit that big shot when everyone else is cold. Trae was, last year, but it's far from just his fault four having a bad possession that last time. We hadn't had a field trial in over six minutes, which is everyone's problem, not just hours. As ready as it is to blabber him because of how artful that last possession was any shooting from any player (besides Nigel's run, there was nothing) that even approached being respectable would have won us the game.   But by all means, continue systematic bad shooting by most of the team on the point guard who had 8 second to create something against one of the best defenders in the country (as much as it pains me, craft us damn good at defense)."
WisconsinBadgers,1wqtnr,hotcarl23,2,Sun Feb 2 08:47:44 2014 UTC,Good thing he didn't see this today!
WisconsinBadgers,1wqtnr,awlraght,2,Sun Feb 9 20:24:38 2014 UTC,"It worked a few times before but he always takes the same shot in those situations; right elbow pull-up jumper.

WisconsinBadgers,1wnu9h,the-csquare,2,Sat Feb 1 00:37:42 2014 UTC,"Michigan now 2nd in B1G Hockey, Bucky drops to 3rd.  The boys are crap on the road, 1-6.  They played well in the first period, but after the 2 goals by Mich they started to get sloppy and force plays.  They need to tighten up the game or they may miss the NCAA's, which would be a tragedy with the talent this team has."
WisconsinBadgers,1wk8vw,wackywiener,7,Thu Jan 30 15:43:12 2014 UTC,"Man. I fucking called this shit SO HARD. If Melvin isn't watching Ball right now and seeing the struggles he's having and understanding that you have to be able to pass block, catch, and run he's stupid. I knew this was going to be a huge factor."
WisconsinBadgers,1wk8vw,Dynasty471,4,Thu Jan 30 15:53:45 2014 UTC,"Well... unless you're Adrian Peterson. He came out not knowing how to do any of those things except run.  Yes, I do agree though. You have to be able to do be able to assist in all phases if you're going to be in the backfield, especially if you're on the same team as Peyton Manning."

WisconsinBadgers,1wk8m0,R04CH,5,Thu Jan 30 22:28:25 2014 UTC,"Something happened to this team after the Illinois game.  It's out of character for a Bo Ryan squad to tailspin like this.  Comparing this team performance to their non-conference run, they are totally unrecognizable."

Didn't play for the BCS because of losses to MSU and TOSU. Lost to Oregon in the Rose Bowl.  That was an awesome year to be a Badger football fan, but I don't think I'd be talking shit. Wilson was a great addition to that team, but even he couldn't overcome Brandt or Benny or Bill or whoever the hell our coach was that year."

I hate that fake tanned douche lord more than most, but the writer's credibility dropped significantly after that sad attempt to demean him for showing his son affection. Let's make fun of him for falling asleep in the tanning bed or sporting a 1980's serial killer hairdo, not for having a good relationship with his son. That's something that should be admired and emulated, not something to make fun of just because it makes you a little uncomfortable."

WisconsinBadgers,1v0jv8,WiscDC,4,Sun Jan 12 05:58:25 2014 UTC,Rumpz played out of his mind this weekend! Stellar play from him. The ovation he received at the end of the 2nd tonight was well deserved. Great pair of games from Mersch and Dahl as well. Awesome seeing the Kohl packed tonight.  Bonus points for the scuffle at the end!
WisconsinBadgers,1v0jv8,the-csquare,3,Sun Jan 12 06:18:33 2014 UTC,"For the second straight night, they played competitively for 60 minutes against a quality opponent.  Michigan had its moments, but Rumpel and the rest of the defense were resiliant enough in those cases.  Wisconsin had its moments as well, and Things appear to be coming together as we hoped for earlier in the year."
WisconsinBadgers,1v0jv8,BuckyCop,4,Sun Jan 12 07:19:50 2014 UTC,Hats off to the boys this weekend. Also a good decision by Eaves to start Rumpel both games. Rumpel is far and away the #1 tender on the team and he played awesome.  Seeing 6 players in the Michigan penalty box at the end was a rare sight!  I believe the old rivalry from the 1970's WCHA is back! It went out with a Badger sweep and is back with a Badger sweep! Go Bucky!

WisconsinBadgers,1ubcb5,BIRDERofDaYR3XinaRoW,4,Fri Jan 3 16:40:58 2014 UTC,You must not watch a lot of football. We need guys like him.
WisconsinBadgers,1ubcb5,gerkenjerken,4,Fri Jan 3 21:54:41 2014 UTC,"We will have all OL returning minus Groy, and are bringing in 5 O-linemen in the 2014 class. We'll also bring in three WR, as well as two from injury/redshirt (Reggie Love and Marquis Mason). This accounts for 5 WR entering the fold. Yes, we are bringing in two good RB in Deal and Kinlaw, but Mixon is on a completely different talent level. This is a huge deal for us and would be one of the best recruits to ever come to UW. Building the offense around a guy like Mixon could seriously help propel us to the top tier of teams in college football, which we have been on the cusp of for several years.   College football is recruiting driven, and old-schoolers think we don't need a ""self centered"" or ""egotistical"" kid like him don't understand the landscape of football. Furthermore, you have no basis to make these judgements from, aside from the 18 year old kid's twitter. Have you ever met Joe? If he can stay out of trouble, play within a team concept (which he has stated several times that he would be more than willing to share time with Melvin), and perform on the field, he can play on my team any day.   Again, if you're fine by being on the cusp of the top tier and seek no improvement from our football program, then yes, we don't need Mixon. But if you want to take opportunities to build around top-flight talent and take the step into being a consistent NC contender, then we do need to start recruiting and signing the Mixons of the world."
WisconsinBadgers,1ubcb5,DeuterThreeyah,1 point,Fri Jan 3 21:29:37 2014 UTC,"Honestly right now over the Next two years (HOPING AND PRAYING GORDON STAYS FOR HIS SENIOR SEASON but he probably wont but HERE'S HOPING :) I really can't see how you can get any better at the college level than Gordon and Clement in the backfield.  To me going into next year that's the best Backfield in the country with WATT opening up truck size holes for these two lightening bolts to explode through ALONG WITH an OFFENSIVE LINE that returns I think EVERY Starter?!?!  Oh My GaaaawwwwD!!!.    Don't get me wrong the more the merrier and if the kid is as good as you say he is we'll find a way to get him on the field...  IF WE DO GET HIM, Although I know he is more than likely ready to play right away, it would do him a great service, as well as the team, to redshirt himself for a year because of the fact we ARE SOO STACKED at RB right now...  Because here's the thing...  in 2015 we have a top 25 Recruit QuarterBack coming in from UTAH that is basically following Gary Anderson wherever he goes.  He's completely Loyal to Gare-Bear and has already verbally committed  Apparently the kid runs a sub 4.3, 4.4 40 yard dash time(Yeeeeaaa He's a fucking Quarterback basically the White Mike Vick Minus the SCUMBAG Gene) and has an ABSOLUTE CANNON for an arm...  If we get Mixon too and somehow convince him to REDSHIRT 2014 and have both of them in the BACKFIELD for the start of the 2015 season a year where we open up on a National Stage @LAMBEAU FIELD against LSU!! WHOOOOOAAAAAA What an introduction that would be for two of the most dynamic freshman maybe ever to start in the same game in the same backfield... If we could keep these two together for 2 or 3 years Holy Hell we would be The Monsters of the Midwest!!!!  GET OVER HERE MIXON!!!!  The Combination of those two has NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP(S) written all over it!!!!!"
WisconsinBadgers,1ubcb5,DeuterThreeyah,2,Fri Jan 3 23:10:47 2014 UTC,"We didn't get Mixon.   And it sounds like you've been hearing too many urban legends about Kafentzis. He seems like he has some tools but he's not THAT highly rated and didn't have a great offer list. Hopefully he develops a little more, but at this point I would be more excited about Gillins, as far as QB recruits coming in goes."
WisconsinBadgers,1ubcb5,someone447,1 point,Fri Jan 3 23:26:03 2014 UTC,Thank you for that. You get my whole reason for this thread.
WisconsinBadgers,1ubcb5,gerkenjerken,0,Tue Jan 7 04:30:38 2014 UTC,"That sounds like some Bo Ryan thinking. ""He's amazing and could help the program, but hes not my type of guy. Let's let someone else get him""  If our recruiting mold doesn't try to get guys like this than we will continue to loose bowl games to teams with superior athletes who didn't ""meet our mold.""  If showing him some love on twitter can, in any way, help him go to Wisconsin then I say it's worth it."
WisconsinBadgers,1ubcb5,baroquenj,2,Tue Jan 7 05:06:51 2014 UTC,"I say it's not worth it. I take pride in the fact that we've been able to have the success we've had without lowering our standards for the players outside of football. Part of our success has been founded on the idea of cohesion and doing things the right way. If we choose to start bringing cancerous personalities into the locker room out of desperation, it will undermine the system we have in place. I think we have the ability to take it to the next level without making any concessions on personnel in any regard.  Edit: I also like how you're using Bo Ryan's recruiting tactics as an example, and yet we're having one of the best basketball seasons in Wisconsin history."

WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,Irish0625,9,Thu Jan 2 06:10:25 2014 UTC,To beat the big boys we either need Joel Stave to stop throwing the ball so much or for someone not named Joel Stave to throw the ball as much as Joel Stave.
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,nutty15,3,Thu Jan 2 17:56:11 2014 UTC,"We don't need Joe Mixon. He'd be nice to have, but we aren't lacking for playmakers at RB.  Kamara on the other hand...yes."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,franklin_stubbs,2,Thu Jan 2 07:30:38 2014 UTC,I would say we need him.  His is a super athlete.  Even as a freshman he could be on the field in a David Gilreath role. Just get him the ball in space and let him make people miss.  I think we will land Kamara and boy do we need him.
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,Hopalicious,2,Thu Jan 2 13:28:56 2014 UTC,"Can we be real for a second?  We already have 25 incoming freshmen.  25.  If we do get Joe Mixon, that's a scholarship we have to take away form someone else.  We already have a 3/4 star running back coming in, and with Clement seemingly Ball 4.0/White 3.0/Gordon 2.0 we should be set for a bit.  Regardless, it seems that lately whoever lines up at RB will be good, generally a product of our above average offensive line.  The last thing I want is for us to turn into an over-recruiting SEC team that doesn't honor our commitments to players.  I can live without Joe Mixon.  Mixed feelings on Kamara as we need WR's more than we need RB's, but still feel mostly the same as we have 3 incoming WR's as well."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Fri Jan 3 15:32:13 2014 UTC,Hit up Joe Mixon on Twitter.  He loves to see badger love on twitter @Joe_MainMixon.
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,Hopalicious,3,Thu Jan 2 23:04:39 2014 UTC,"This article is way over the top. We don't have playmakers? What about White and Gordon, who set an NCAA record for yards by a RB duo this season? What about Kenzel Doe, who scored a huge KR touchdown when we really needed it? What about Borland, an all-American, and Abbrederis, a stud?  We were a few players short and still almost won. I doubt there are many teams in the country who can have their starting QB go out with an injury and win. It was a tough outcome, but it wasn't a blow out."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,franklin_stubbs,3,Fri Jan 3 15:27:07 2014 UTC,"Exactly. We lost that game because of DBs who couldn't locate anything short of the Hindenburg in the air, and poor QB play (which was exacerbated by repeatedly passing on first down in the red zone). When your program is constantly putting o-linemen and RBs into the first few rounds of the NFL draft you don't switch to a read-option spread that's even more heavily dependent on your historically weakest position (QB). Do we need upgrades at a few key positions? Certainly. Wholesale change? Not if we want to win 10+ games."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,AlcarinRucin,1 point,Thu Jan 2 13:31:32 2014 UTC,"What the badgers need is a highly mobile QB, who can scramble. Look at the successful badger teams of the past and successful college teams in general. They almost always have a QB that can run and get those extra 3rd down conversions. DJ Gillins should give us this in 2 years when he is ready."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,Hopalicious,2,Thu Jan 2 16:53:39 2014 UTC,I'd settle for someone who can throw the ball into the dirt successfully.
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,AlcarinRucin,3,Fri Jan 3 15:37:00 2014 UTC,"On that note, I'd settle for a DB that doesn't have his back to the QB all game."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,Hopalicious,1 point,Fri Jan 3 16:37:25 2014 UTC,I agree with almost everything you wrote. The article is over the top. We're really almost there and with the incoming WR and QB talent we could even be there. However I'm going to disagree with you on Kenzel Doe. Yes he had an incredible play but that hardly disqualifies all the other terribleness he was during the rest of the season.
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,wackywiener,1 point,Fri Jan 3 16:46:05 2014 UTC,"Yes, Doe has been pretty bad all year, but that play was amazing. He really stepped up there and became a playmaker, which is what the article says we were missing.  We've lost 4 straight bowl games to top-5 teams nationally, all by within 10 points. I think the author, like most fans, is just frustrated by how close we always seem to be but can't get over that final hurdle."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,franklin_stubbs,2,Thu Jan 2 15:22:18 2014 UTC,Yeah. I'm optimistic. I really think within the next few years our qb play is going to be at a whole new level. Mark my words - Stave will not start next year. Secondary is really what I'm worried about we need people that are going to make plays. Shelton is a good start.
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,wackywiener,2,Thu Jan 2 15:26:21 2014 UTC,"Southward was worthless yesterday. On a couple of USC catches if he would just get his hand in there to break up the pass or give the guy a good hit as the ball came in he could have broken it up. Great guy, but I won't miss him on the field.   I hope Houston starts next year as well. I have no idea where he is in his development, but for all the hype he's gotten I sure hope he's able to pass a walk-on."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Thu Jan 2 15:34:05 2014 UTC,Southwards been terrible all year. That pass at half in OSU was completely on him. The kid has only been playing football for like 5 years which shows. If Southward was a freshman I'd be impressed. The fact that McEvoy is getting play at safety should really show you exactly how bad the secondary is. He's a fucking wr/qb/somehtingorother.  My money's on Houston too. I said that last year though. I doubt McEvoy makes any serious push but I don't count him out. I think he's gotta go to WR. There isn't any other option. While I'm excited about Gillins I don't think that will happen next year either.
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,wackywiener,2,Thu Jan 2 15:37:39 2014 UTC,"i dont think this has anything to do with playmakers.  we need a kicker who can kick with GOOD accuracy and GOOD distance. we havent had that all year. that is not a playmaker, that is a guy who does his damn job.  we also do not need a playmaker at qb. we need a guy who doenst suck."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,dtpollitt,2,Thu Jan 2 15:43:31 2014 UTC,"Stave doesn't suck. He's got the physical tools. He's just terribly inconsistent, and that's why the Badgers will lose big games with him at qb. If he can hammer out his consistency issues, I'd prefer him over everyone we have at QB, but for the time being, I'd prefer someone with half the talent who can make good decisions all the time."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,junkspot91,1 point,Thu Jan 2 18:10:05 2014 UTC,"being terribly inconsistent is apart of not being good. also, learning to take a hit from his non-throwing shoulder is an important part of being good, too.   i agree he has the tools but is maddening. i cant trust him to win games, but i can trust him to lose them."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,dtpollitt,2,Thu Jan 2 21:36:57 2014 UTC,"I agree. Aside from the Ohio State game, there's never really been a time where I felt he was a major reason we were in a position to win a game."
WisconsinBadgers,1u7nr6,junkspot91,1 point,Thu Jan 2 21:54:34 2014 UTC,"We need our d to step up.    SC's QB was on fire yesterday, and their wide outs had hands of glue.  We need some better secondary in there to help with some of this downfield.   we need not Stave to be able to throw the ball, and throw it to someone not named Abbredaris (and now next year we don't have a choice)  We need a stud QB to come in.  We are so focused on the run game (and for good reason, we're good at it) that we may not be as appealing to big name wide outs since they won't be involved.  I hope that some of them see that it is a good situation as they can really help out in the play action, but only having 1 real receiver outlet didn't help as much."
WisconsinBadgers,1u11yr,mrb11n,4,Mon Dec 30 18:09:10 2013 UTC,"Rumors are that he's getting a draft grade.  I'm not sure he'll leave this year, but he's definitely going to be in the NFL."
WisconsinBadgers,1u11yr,Keystolope,6,Mon Dec 30 18:13:06 2013 UTC,Believe i heard confirmation on buckys5th he wasn't going this year.
WisconsinBadgers,1u11yr,wackywiener,3,Mon Dec 30 21:59:28 2013 UTC,The journal-sentinel is reporting he's coming back to UW.  Edit: here is the link.   http://jsonline.com/more/sports/badgers/uw-tackle-rob-havenstein-passes-on-nfl-to-build-his-foundation-b99174172z1-238199061.html
WisconsinBadgers,1u0rkb,dradam168,2,Mon Dec 30 16:10:14 2013 UTC,"Whether or not it's a quiet home court will depend pretty much entirely on how close the game is, and if the Badgers can get into it early, getting the ""old people"" involved.  I was at the Nebraska basketball game 2 years ago, which was on the same day as the Packers-Bears playoff game.  There were more empty seats in the regular seating than most Big Ten games that season, but for the first time that year, besides the Marquette game, the atmosphere was better than flat-as-can-be.  As a Redskins fan, my NFL allegiances aren't conflicting with anything!  :D"
WisconsinBadgers,1u0rkb,WiscDC,1 point,Mon Dec 30 23:26:27 2013 UTC,"It just makes me nervous.  Iowa already tends to play us close (we just match up poorly) combined with students being out of town for break and now it has to contend with a Packer playoff game?  Sounds like a recipe for disaster.  On the bright side, our team is better is year than it has been in quite some time, so Iowa SHOULD simply be over matched."
WisconsinBadgers,1u0rkb,WiscDC,0,Mon Dec 30 23:29:54 2013 UTC,"On the other hand...the impact of the crowd is minimal compared to the teams on the court.  Yes, they'd prefer an insanely electric atmosphere, but that's not to be expected at UW, except for a few games on the schedule."
WisconsinBadgers,1u0rkb,Tuggernuts23,1 point,Mon Dec 30 23:45:50 2013 UTC,"Back when I was in the Band I felt obligated to go to whichever basketball game was on when the Packers lost to the Giants in the play-offs.  We dvr'd the game and did our best not to learn anything about the game at the Kohl Center/on the way home.  Of the 5 of us, only 1 got home with no knowledge of what had transpired."
WisconsinBadgers,1twa1i,WiscDC,2,Sat Dec 28 20:42:08 2013 UTC,To be fair it is a hockey team from Alabama
WisconsinBadgers,1twa1i,tacosaladchupacabra,2,Sat Dec 28 23:11:07 2013 UTC,"It's certainly far from a marquee matchup, and there's actually a lot more to Alabama-Huntsville's low level of play than them just being a team from Alabama.  It's a program that was going to be cut recently until it had to be saved.  It was without a conference for a few years.  It was a D-II power at one time, but it won't be a D-I power.  They're trying to build a respectable program.  Though the Badgers have every intention of controlling play and winning handily, they're doing UA-H a favor by scheduling them to help them get back on their feet, and I think that's a good thing.  Here's my takeaway from UW's perspective - considering all the crap that has surrounded the UA-H program recently, it's good that Wisconsin did not take that game for granted, avoiding the miniscule chant that they'd be upset.  They allowed no shots on goal in the first period, and this has been a team that has started games poorly."
WisconsinBadgers,1tjoqx,WiscDC,3,Mon Dec 23 18:48:22 2013 UTC,"Cool. Well, except for the men's hockey team attempting to sing.  Uff-dah."
WisconsinBadgers,1tfkqg,pianobadger,5,Sun Dec 22 01:33:33 2013 UTC,We just need to hit a quick 3. Maybe get the zone working on defense and we should be right back in this.

WisconsinBadgers,1tfkqg,towehaal,3,Sun Dec 22 02:46:47 2013 UTC,Do we have any idea why one person on each team wears a different color shirt?
WisconsinBadgers,1tfkqg,trask_ulgo,4,Sun Dec 22 02:48:05 2013 UTC,Libero. They only play back row and can sub in and out between plays without signalling the ref. So basically they can be in the back row almost the whole game. They can't jump attack the ball in front of the ten foot line.
WisconsinBadgers,1tfkqg,ex0th3rmic,2,Sun Dec 22 03:27:11 2013 UTC,"I've seen enough volleyball that I'm used to it, but I never figured out why."
WisconsinBadgers,1tfkqg,ManasBaraa,4,Sun Dec 22 02:51:05 2013 UTC,"Well that's the libero, and they can't attack. I'm not really sure what constitutes attacking though, and I'm not sure why the position exists."
WisconsinBadgers,1tfkqg,DeuterThreeyah,2,Sun Dec 22 03:03:41 2013 UTC,"Attacking = jumping and making contact in front of the ten foot (3m) line. Serve receive and passing are skills that are harder for taller people (ie middles) to master, so that's why coaches put liberos in. Liberos are normally shorter, so it wouldn't make sense for them to attack anyway.  SIDE NOTE: I would give anything to have a D1 men's team here at UW :("
WisconsinBadgers,1tfkqg,norwegiancowboy9,1 point,Sun Dec 22 23:25:55 2013 UTC,They play more as a defensive prescience that helps sets up attacks

Edit: This article does a pretty good job of explaining: http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall08/Devine/positions.html  This is the 'libero.' Apparently they can go in and out as much as they want, probably why they need the different color. They play a more defensive position."

WisconsinBadgers,1tfka7,WiscDC,2,Tue Dec 24 00:34:11 2013 UTC,"Yeah, despite the number of students, it's near impossible to do anything.  If anything happens, you'd need the band to get on board.  This is a student section that wouldn't continue a ""thank you seniors"" chant on senior day last year.  Having hockey-level organiziation in our basketball student section would be great, but students eat their tickets like its a delicious, nutritious superfood.  I've been doing the volleyball method - ""bounce, bounce, bounce, spin, etc,"" basically narrating what they do, and yell really loudly when they are about to shoot (preferably with a spike in volume a little too soon, so it's off-time).

Sure they lost to a VERY average Penn State team and cost themselves a BCS bid but hey!?...  The Capital one bowl is the best Non-Bcs Bowl and they should be proud to be in it.    Yea they should have won atleast 2 out the 3 games they lost this season but those games build character for Bowl Games like this.  It's a GREAT Matchup and the badgers have plenty to feel good about this season and will have even more if Gary Anderson does what Brett Biliema hasn't done in a Looooong time.  Win a Bowl game.  The Badges got this.
WisconsinBadgers,1sx0un,WiscDC,2,Sun Dec 15 05:27:50 2013 UTC,"This was the first UW game in which no penalties were called since February 24, 1967.  (It was in stark contrast to the end of Friday's game.)"
WisconsinBadgers,1sx0un,the-csquare,2,Sun Dec 15 05:30:48 2013 UTC,"Interesting weekend for them. Looked fairly good on Friday, actually managing a power play goal and were one bad Kerdiles pass away from a shutout. The huge penalty kill was very impressive and a great sign. Saturday was rather mixed. I think Eaves might have learned his lesson on putting lower lines out there to start after last nights start. Nice to see them work hard and manage to comeback."
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,BIRDERofDaYR3XinaRoW,7,Thu Dec 12 02:40:50 2013 UTC,"i love where you're heads at but there is a very realistic possibility that Dekker leaves for the NBA after this year. If he keeps up this production a lot of analysts have him as a lotto to top 20 pick...its hard to think he would stay if thats the case. I hope he stays, but either way, the future looks bright!"
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,iJustSipTheSizzurp,3,Thu Dec 12 04:00:29 2013 UTC,"Growing up around him and his family, I have a hard time believing he would leave early. His dad has always been about doing things the right way, and I would hope that would translate to Sam as well."
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,Jordasm,-2,Thu Dec 12 05:23:50 2013 UTC,"What are you implying when you say the ""right way?"" That it's immoral for him to go the the NBA while his value is high? That cashing in while the going is hot is the ""wrong way?"" If he stays for next year and then leaves as a junior, is that still not the right way?  Don't get me wrong, I'd love him to stay for as long as possible, but get off the high horse man. The NBA and basketball is a fickle thing--player popularity, coverage, injuries, the whole shebang. There is absolutely nothing wrong with getting the money while you still can if you feel like that is best for you."
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,simpax,3,Fri Dec 13 18:06:15 2013 UTC,"I'm saying that the reason he's going to college is twofold. One, he's there to play basketball. Two, he's there to get an education. When I say ""the right way,"" I mean he should stay and finish his education. In addition to that, I feel that him staying all four years, and showcasing his ability to be a consistent playmaker will increase his stock, as well as his skill level, as opposed to leaving early."
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,Jordasm,2,Fri Dec 13 21:04:31 2013 UTC,Aww Maaan?!?  You really think so?!?!  Damn it that sucks. I had no idea he was entertaining thoughts of leaving that early. Goddamnit Dekker. I mean the kids good but another year of college could really do a lot for his game. I think he'd be much more NBA ready if he left after his junior season than he would this year. And I'm not just saying that because he's imperative to our potential title run either. Lol. His game still needs work at the college level. He needs to add more muscle too and just continue to mature and progress here. I'd hate to see him be a flop in the NBA because he jumped the gun. I hope he decides to stay. For his sake and the teams.
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,Jewtheist,8,Thu Dec 12 04:07:45 2013 UTC,"With the loaded draft it would probably be wise for him to stay another year and then possibly go top 10, while contributing for another possible top 5 team. He's a smart kid--I think he stays."
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,iJustSipTheSizzurp,4,Thu Dec 12 04:22:17 2013 UTC,"I know its a rarity here at wisconsin that anyone leaves early, especially 2 years early, but it has happened. I wouldnt be surprised if he decided to stay or leave. keeping my fingers crossed!"
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,Jewtheist,4,Thu Dec 12 04:15:10 2013 UTC,"Ya know I hadn't thought about next year with this one being so stellar, but you got some good points. Koenig should be able to match Brust, and probably better him (dynamic sorer with passing skills instead of pure distance shooting and rebounding), with full minutes. I agree Koenig will definitely be better than Brust by a good amount at some point, but I don't know if it's next year--it certainly could be though. If Dekker stays (and with a loaded draft, I think he has a good shot to) you're right, 2014-15 might be better than this one.   Side note, I wouldn't get too excited about Evan Anderson--he 's a foul machine, to an absurd level. 24 fouls in his 78 career minutes, and 4 in his 5 minutes this year. Unless he suddenly stops that, no way he'll increase his role, especially for Bo Ryan."
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,Jewtheist,2,Thu Dec 12 04:20:28 2013 UTC,Good point about Anderson I didn't know that. It's just Bo usually has a star or two up his sleeve he's been hiding that all of a sudden out of nowhere become huge contributors. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a guy like that next year kind of like Dukan this year
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,SwaarM-BucKLe,2,Sat Dec 14 00:30:43 2013 UTC,"True true. As of now, the guys on the roster besides Anderson with some impact potential would be probably be freshmen Riley Dearing (Minnesota Mr. Basketball finalist last year) and Vitto Brown (AP all-Ohio team last year), who both averaged 20 ppg, and were both 3-star recruits."
WisconsinBadgers,1soq2v,Jewtheist,1 point,Sat Dec 14 00:44:25 2013 UTC,"WOW!  I didn't know that?!?!  That's ridiculous.  So Bo is getting the recruits now 10 years in year in and year out.  Is it pretty safe to say with this stock of players we have and the guys we seemingly have coming in every year with major talent that any ""rebuilding"" year or lull in talent on the team from now on is pretty much over.  You think Wisconsin is now going to be a powerhouse from here until the end of Bo's career whenever that may be?    I just look at the guy's we have on this team RIGHT NOW and the recruiting class we have coming in next year which looks stellar not to mention the guys on the bench like you said who are future major contributors with the amount of talent they have...It's hard to see this team dropping out of the top 10 the next 2 or 3 years at least and possibly depending on how guys evolve within the system even longer... Am I right here?"
WisconsinBadgers,1smvy7,kidfromkor,4,Wed Dec 11 14:39:27 2013 UTC,I really liked Taylor during his time with the Badgers and felt bad for him when he missed those chances to showcase his skills before the draft. A lot of Wisconsin (both UW and Packers) connections over there in Seattle. Hope it works out for him.
WisconsinBadgers,1smvy7,f_em_Bucky94,5,Wed Dec 11 14:41:12 2013 UTC,"This is the guy that has has two sports hernias, correct? Gotta feel for him; he was a solid player in college"

WisconsinBadgers,1sn1f9,Airhawk360,6,Wed Dec 11 15:51:25 2013 UTC,"We were supposed to be crushed in various past bowl games, but managed to win some of those and keep others very close.  As Barry would say, you WANT to play a big opponent.  Bring on the chickens, they are a formidable opponent and it should be a good game."
WisconsinBadgers,1sn1f9,PurpleCapybara,2,Wed Dec 11 18:31:00 2013 UTC,"the Gamecocks have a pretty balanced attack at an average of 248 passing yards, 205 rushing yards, and ~34 points a game.  Their Defense is pretty damn good by allowing 20 points a game.  Obv, we all know about Clowney, but the defense makes great adjustments when offenses scheme against Clowney\play to the opposite side of the field of him.    We've got our work cut out for us, esp after seeing them destroy #6 Clemson in their last game 31-17.  Not only that, but SC is the only team in the country to have 3 wins over teams currently ranked 18 or higher and I believe they have the longest home winning streak in the nation (not that it matters, just pointing it out)  The optimism in me thinks Wisconsin's line is big and bullish enough to compete and help out our run game.  Should be a close\good game as long as our pass d doesn't look like they did against Penn State.  HILLARY, YOU SUCK.  Hopefully, we can generate a passrush that results in a few sacks instead of our usual shtick of flushing the pocket only to watch the QB stay on his feet."
WisconsinBadgers,1sn1f9,simpax,2,Wed Dec 11 16:12:10 2013 UTC,"Not only that, but SC is the only team in the country to have 3 wins over teams currently ranked 18 or higher   One of them is UCF which, yeah, and the other is Clemson, which has exactly 0 wins over currently ranked teams by playing in a weak ACC. That's a fun stat for SC, but doesn't really scare me.  SC is a great, well balanced team, but I think it could be a very even bowl game once the dust clears. Either way, I see little reason to worry prematurely. If we come out ready to play this time, we'll definitely have a good shot at picking up the W."
WisconsinBadgers,1sn1f9,pianobadger,2,Thu Dec 12 07:51:04 2013 UTC,"Why on Earth would you think we would get destroyed? We haven't lost a game by more than a touchdown in years, not to anyone, and we've played better teams than South Carolina. We have a school record setting offense and an elite defense. If one game this year was an outlier it was Penn State.  Edit: Also, when I checked shortly after the bowl was announced we were favored.  Edit2: Now the odds are even."
WisconsinBadgers,1sn1f9,simpax,0,Fri Dec 13 15:38:04 2013 UTC,"I'm fully prepared to be suprised, but maybe its just the after affects of the Penn State game, but I've got a bad feeling about it, thats all. As long as they cant stop the run and Stave doesn't mess up too bad, we should be fine though"
WisconsinBadgers,1sn1f9,BIRDERofDaYR3XinaRoW,1 point,Fri Dec 13 16:59:22 2013 UTC,"I'm not afraid of being destroyed at all. As others have mentioned, SC is a very balanced team on both sides of the ball with no huge weaknesses. An all around good, well coached team, but not best of the best. They did lose to currently unranked Tennessee and Georgia. Other than their big wins over Missouri and Clemson, which took them 2 OTs for the former, they don't have any monster victories that set them apart. Being on the opposite side of Auburn, Alabama, LSU, TA&M, they avoided a lot of the truly scary SEC names this year. They will be a very tough game, but definitely beatable. I think our guys can handle it if they come out ready, and I absolutely am not dreading a blowout.   Regardless, I'm a huge believer in if you want to be the best, you have to play the best. And I do think we can hang with them. I'm really looking forward to this bowl game and hopefully making a statement against the SEC. Also loving the LSU/Alabama regular season match ups that we have planned for the future."
WisconsinBadgers,1sk8fd,PurpleCapybara,11,Tue Dec 10 17:48:27 2013 UTC,"Cool, all we have to do is get the lead.  Once that happens, have Beau fall on the ball and refuse to get up until the game is over.  SC will never see it coming."

WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,vorpnick,7,Sat Dec 7 22:42:32 2013 UTC,"Special year on the way if they can keep it together through some hard stretches.   Right now 13-0 is basically a gimme, and 14-0 is likely. They will lose at some point, but if the home court advantage stays strong, a top 3 seed is within grasp, since the toughest road opponents are Iowa and Michigan--that's it. 3 seed would be huge, allowing us to avoid the #1 seed until the elite 8.   Don't wanna get too far ahead though, just enjoy the basketball at hand...The whole crop of young guys is solid, and Dekker-Jackson-Kaminsky-Gasser are so damn good right now. We saw multiple alley-oops today for chrissake! (Lol sorry Brust).   Remember when one of our starting forwards shot .083% from three and jumped for his foul shots? This is so great."
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,Jewtheist,6,Sun Dec 8 04:08:08 2013 UTC,"Remember when one of our starting forwards shot .083% from three and jumped for his foul shots? This is so great.    Yeah, but that hair!"
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,The_hezy,3,Sun Dec 8 04:28:23 2013 UTC,"13-0 is not a gimme. Milwaukee is 9-2 and EKY is 7-3 and took VCU to OT on the road. We should win, but those are not bad teams."
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,pianobadger,2,Sun Dec 8 05:20:03 2013 UTC,"Well for a top 10 team that plays at home like the Badgers do, maybe gimme was the wrong word (and obviously not how the team should be thinking), but a loss to one of those two really should not happen the way things are going right now.   But you're right, those teams don't suck."
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,Jewtheist,1 point,Sun Dec 8 05:22:20 2013 UTC,I have way more confidence in Brust than I do Jackson. Brust is a solid player while Jackson can be extremely inconsistent. I am worried every time he has the ball which shouldn't be the case with the point guard.
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,ilaarin,2,Sun Dec 8 20:00:12 2013 UTC,"Jackson is a little less consistent, but I don't think you should be worried every time he has the ball. He is solid with it. Sometimes he takes quick shots or holds the ball too long, but he's not out of control or turnover prone. He plays well within the offense, and his progress from last year to this one has been one of the best on the team. Brust is just as likely to jack up an ill-advised shot (although a bit more likely to make it, and he boards well. He doesn't run the offense like Trae does though. I'm not knocking him though Brust is key)."
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,Jewtheist,2,Sun Dec 8 20:08:18 2013 UTC,I think my issue is that I am still hung up on how Jackson was last year. Hopefully he changes my mind though! I also am really happy with Bronson Koenig! He has been a solid player when Traevon is in foul trouble.
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,ilaarin,6,Sun Dec 8 20:17:10 2013 UTC,"I live the badgers, but hate Basketball. However, this team has sucked me in and I find myself watching their games. Great start to the year!"

WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,scofieldslays,2,Sun Dec 8 02:07:02 2013 UTC,Kansas lost too.  We could possibly be 5
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,Airhawk360,2,Sun Dec 8 04:57:20 2013 UTC,"I'm thinking top 5, Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan state lost, plus Wisconsin is the only 10-0 team in the nation after playing one of the tougher non-conference schedules in the league. I'd almost be more suprised if we were outside of the top 5."
WisconsinBadgers,1scgww,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Sun Dec 8 06:28:07 2013 UTC,I'm thinking 6th.  Never thought I'd see a Badgers team with the potential to be in the top 10 for so long throughout the season (fingers crossed) and with the potential to be in the top 5!

As long as the three pointers don't dry up...(that's not in the article, but my minor addition)"
WisconsinBadgers,1sd4by,redblackbluewhite,1 point,Sun Dec 8 05:34:11 2013 UTC,That's my biggest concern with this team at this point is that the 3 pointer will just disappear one night.  They're scoring other ways though.  It doesn't seem like if the 3 isn't falling that theyre just going to keep chucking up prayers.  They have Kaminsky and Nigel in the post now and both are very effective scorers.  Jackson and Gasser can score from anywhere on the floor and Dekker is a great slasher and probably are best offensive player when it comes to getting to the hole.  I like this team I really do.  I think this year might be Bucky's year...

WisconsinBadgers,1s4wyu,vorpnick,8,Thu Dec 5 05:07:26 2013 UTC,"I honestly already am. But you're right--beating MU would put us on a trajectory to be in the top 10 all year, which is amazing.   If we beat MU, the toughest games before playing at Indiana (Jan 14) are two at home against Iowa and Illinois. There's a real chance this team could be 16-0 playing at Indiana, then home against Michigan, and then on the road in Minnesota and Purdue. If the team is undefeated after all that, and then beats OSU or MSU, I don't think any possible dreams for this year are unwarranted.  But, even if Wisconsin is something like 17-3 after the Indiana-Michigan-Minnesota-Purdue stretch, that's still pretty incredible. Plus, the only ranked road opponent we have (as of now) are Michigan and Iowa in late February. We get OSU and Michigan State at home.   This is shaping up to be a year to remember."
WisconsinBadgers,1s4wyu,Jewtheist,2,Thu Dec 5 17:44:35 2013 UTC,"I am a bit already too ha, trying not to get too overconfident.  Great analysis on the schedule.  I'm sure we will lose eventually but honestly I think we can beat anyone in the Big 10 the way we have been playing thus far.  Putting up this many points, (in most of the games), while still playing good ol' fashioned Bo Ryan lockdown defense is a recipe for success IMO.   Bring em all on"
WisconsinBadgers,1s4wyu,vorpnick,2,Fri Dec 6 05:12:08 2013 UTC,"Yessir. The D last game was particularly amazing, even with a ton of BS cheap fouls (on both teams, for sure)."

WisconsinBadgers,1rvn0p,ALARE1KS,3,Mon Dec 2 01:45:25 2013 UTC,"I'm honestly a little worried about next years talent level. We're losing an insane amount of starters in our defensive front seven, including Borland who's presence not only affects us on the field where he's a monster, but off the field where he's the heart and soul of a group of people just like him (lowly recruited, but with huge hearts)   Abbrederis is our only legitimate passing threat, I fear what will happen if Stave retains the starting job with the weapons we'll have left over.   I was going to root for MSU to beat tOSU but after seeing OSU kept #2, I want them to finish it off and win a national championship for the B1G. I'll be rooting hard for Ohio State Jan 6th and rooting even harder for the Badgers next year."

I'm not worried about our offense. Our defense, however, has me a little concerned. Not sure where our front 7 is going to come from, because you're right, our leadership and talent is graduating/graduated at this point. Beau Allen and Chris Borland will be tough to replace, and I haven't heard a whole lot from anyone else in that defensive front 7."
WisconsinBadgers,1rvn0p,s54b32dd,3,Mon Dec 2 16:05:42 2013 UTC,"I don't share your optimism or respect for OSU. I think they're wildly over-rated, having a tough time with some very mediocre B1G teams (Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan) and will get destroyed in a big game. Their defense is not championship caliber (Michigan had their way with them, the same Michigan team that went back-to-back weeks with negative rushing yards). Not to mention their program is always shady, with players running into trouble with the law before their charges are mysteriously dropped (see Hyde, Carlos) and their fans are insufferably arrogant.   I think MSU can score enough points on O against their D and win a low scoring close game, around 17 - 10."
WisconsinBadgers,1rvn0p,franklin_stubbs,0,Mon Dec 2 15:12:49 2013 UTC,"I'm with you on this one.  Auburn deserves to be in the NCG after knocking off Bama in the Iron Bowl and I think everyone is in agreement that FSU earned their spot there.  Sure, Auburn needs to beat a tough Mizzou squad before actually earning their spot and that doesn't even guarantee them in the big game.  But, i too think OSU is going to get spanked by either of those two teams and as much as I'd love for a Big1G team to win it all, fuck OSU, i hope they get embarrassed.   I see FSU beating Duke, I hope MSU beats OSU, and Auburn should beat Mizzou  setting up an FSU vs Auburn NCG which will be highly entertaining.  If MSU beats OSU, they're in the rose bowl, right?  How fall from graces will OSU drop?  They'll still get a BCS bid because they'd still be ranked in the top 14, right?"
WisconsinBadgers,1rvn0p,franklin_stubbs,2,Mon Dec 2 16:10:10 2013 UTC,"I think so. I think MSU is in the Rose Bowl either way, with OSU either going MNC game or Orange Bowl."
WisconsinBadgers,1rt7w7,ALARE1KS,10,Sun Dec 1 02:17:57 2013 UTC,"But had we won, what transpired in the Iron Bowl would have been doubly good for a BCS bowl berth for the Badgers."
WisconsinBadgers,1rt7w7,vindicatednegro,3,Sun Dec 1 03:28:23 2013 UTC,"How? Bama losing puts OSU in the ship, and the Rose Bowl spot open for grabs. That committee is much more likely to pick MSU over a 3-peat losing Rose Bowl participant. Our best bet was with the Orange Bowl.  But none of that matters because we suffered another heartbreaking LOSS!!!!"
WisconsinBadgers,1rt7w7,HedgeFundBaby,2,Sun Dec 1 16:38:15 2013 UTC,"A victory would have assured a BCS bowl game as we would be ranked above 14 plus we'd get an artificial boost in the Big10 because OSU would probably go to the big game, as you said. You're right, there's no way we'd have gotten to the Rose Bowl given our history but Sparty going to Pasadena opens up a non-shitty bowl game to us. And I agree that it doesn't matter at the end :( Dollar General store bowl, here we come!"
WisconsinBadgers,1rt7w7,vindicatednegro,3,Sun Dec 1 19:25:24 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately being in the top 14 doesn't assure you a BCS bid, only opens the door. And 3 B1G teams weren't going to go to BCS games so that would've left us as the odd team out."

The historic intro has a lot more than before, and it includes some of the old commentary and sounds from the games, rather than just plain music.  I wish I knew where to find that online."
WisconsinBadgers,1pcih8,SonOfGallifrey,2,Mon Oct 28 04:17:14 2013 UTC,"I kind of miss the ""From the Pond... To the Rink"" intro but i definitely like the historical intro. They could use that as the initial intro and then still use some form of an enter sandman intro before player/team introductions. It's how we weed out the students who have absolutely no rhythm and can't clap along."
WisconsinBadgers,1pcih8,SonOfGallifrey,2,Mon Oct 28 04:21:18 2013 UTC,"Everyone gets in time with the clapping once the bass kicks in!  The trouble with keeping in time now is that the band is one section over - the farther students are from the band, the harder it is to do the power play (and Badger intro) song/chant in time, and it won't sound as cool.  I like how they enter in the dark arena with the spotlights (if only it didn't reflect off of a bunch of red plastic these days...), but they could definitely throw ""Enter Sandman"" back in between the opposing team's introductions and ours."
WisconsinBadgers,1pcih8,SonOfGallifrey,2,Mon Oct 28 04:26:31 2013 UTC,"I noticed that at this past series. I was in section 115 and i could tell that we were a couple seconds behind 117. Hopefully we're just rusty and will pick it back up as the season progresses. If anything i was impressed by the turnout for the student section for the first series. I know, I know, we used to have a TON of students going to all the games just a few years ago. It was still nice to see everyone show up (and on time too) for the first series.   I also want to see the student section become a little more organized with our cheering. Some hockey fan friends created a facebook page so we could try and coordinate something with the other crease creatures.  The clever chants are always better than the tasteless, vulgar ones"
WisconsinBadgers,1pcih8,SonOfGallifrey,2,Mon Oct 28 04:34:58 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I'm a part of that facebook group, and definitley in with the ""organized clever chants are great, especially when they replace boring vulgar ones.""  I'm also always in 115.  Hopefully more than just a few students can learn school songs that the band already knows.  Singing random songs in unison is fun, but singing UW songs would be even better.  They obviously needed the opportunity, but calling out Bobby Goepfert for plagiarism was one of the great moments in Crease Creature organization.  They moved the band last year because they moved the A/V rooms downstairs to add suites behind the students. They were smart enough to make sure the front of the suite was higher than students' heads when they stand, but moving the band farther from the center is a more subtle problem.  As always, freshmen learn chants and cheers the first weekend, and will develop more enthusiasm as the season goes on."
WisconsinBadgers,1pcih8,ChrisWebersTimeout,2,Mon Oct 28 04:44:44 2013 UTC,"My band friends made sure that I know all those songs by heart. Maybe a clever distribution of song books at the game... Hopefully word gets around and we can get people to sing along. I am also hoping that we can come up with something better than ""Lake Superior is not a State""  I'm sure it will still happen though. I see it as the students providing valuable information to the opposing team. We know our 50 states.  You can always tell who the freshman and first timers are by the giggling that ensues after some of the more interesting chants. But hey, at least more people are getting introduced to badger hockey."

You can't sit in the back seat after losing three Rose Bowls and be like, ""Come on!  We're good!  Rank us better!""  I agree that we're worthy of a top 25 ranking, but we haven't won any close games to warrant just being handed the benefit of the doubt.  It seems we either blow you out, or we lose."
WisconsinBadgers,1oxwq0,b4dger,8,Tue Oct 22 17:49:15 2013 UTC,"1) Performance from past seasons should have NO bearing on this seasons rankings.  2) When we win, we win by a lot.  As much as you could reasonably expect any team to win by.  True, not many of our wins were against high quality opposition, but we beat the teams that were presented to us.  It's not like we were just squeaking by Tennessee Tech or UMass (unlike Michigan who is somehow ranked above us).  3) Our losses were in very difficult games.  One was to #4, on the road, at night, by 7 (hardly embarrassing) and the other loss* was yet again an away night game that we had to travel west for and we lost* by 2 on one of the most egregious officiating blunders that I can ever remember.  4) The human polls show such a lack of knowledge and thought that we have every right to complain about our ranking, especially compared to other teams around us and ESPECIALLY in our conference.  Nobody that watches the Big10 could honestly say that Michigan and Nebraska are significantly (or at all) better than us.  The actual rankings smack of coaches and press folks who don't really watch all the games and are simply ranking on record and perceived conference strength, so our loss* to ASU is REALLY hurting us here.  5) Poll momentum is a real thing and starting position matters.  Starting the BCS unranked, as opposed to in the 18-20 spot like we might deserve is going to make it significantly more difficult for us to rise to a point of BCS eligibility."
WisconsinBadgers,1oxwq0,dradam168,-4,Tue Oct 22 18:36:05 2013 UTC,"We got our ass handed to us by both ASU and OSU.  Everyone wants to say, ""We only lost by 7"" to OSU, but the truth, is that we screwed that game up so much.  A GOOD TEAM (one worthy of a decent ranking) wouldn't have lost that game.  Period.  Now...again...I'm not saying we're not better than the teams you mentioned.  And I'm not saying we don't deserve to be ranked.  But we have some serious deficiencies and things that need to be cleaned up.  I would hate to bitch all year long about ""We deserve to be ranked higher!"" and then get our asses handed to us by an SEC team.  Edit:  Who have we beaten this year?  Illinois, Purdue, UMass, Tennessee Tech, and Northwestern.  So your theory is our best games are ""close losses.""  ""We did so well when we got beat!""  It doesn't work that way.  To your point #2, margin of victory isn't figured into the rankings.  Maybe it should, but it doesn't.  I agree...Michigan squeaks by Akron and UConn...but they still won...hate the system.  Bottom line, WIN YOUR GAMES.  We screwed up the OSU game with mistakes.  ASU outplayed us on the field and the officials (probably) gave them the outcome of the game.  Who knows if French makes that field goal.    tl;dr We wouldn't be whining about a ranking if we had taken care of business."
WisconsinBadgers,1oxwq0,b4dger,2,Tue Oct 22 19:48:13 2013 UTC,"A football game is 60 minutes long.  Each team has the full 60 minutes to score as many points as they are able.  Any game where you are in position to win in the final minutes is hardly ""getting your ass handed to you"".  Can you make an argument that it was our own mistakes that lost us that OSU game?  Of course.  But it is hardly accurate to say that ""any decent team"" would be able to go into Columbus and win a night game.  Likewise, the ASU game, we put ourselves in the position to win completely within the rules of the game, but were denied a final play thanks to gross incompetence of the officials.  Should we get credit for this game as a ""win"", probably not, but we certainly shouldn't be penalized for it to the degree we are.  I'm not arguing that we should be ranked as if we had won both those games, nor am I arguing that we've beaten the world here, but the games we have lost have been close and to very good competition and the games we have won have been decisive victories.  The same can not be said of many of the teams ranked ahead of us.  While it is true that MOV is not included in the computer polls, there is a good argument to be made that it should at least play a factor in the human polls.  Instead, it seems the human voters are using the most superficial possible method of creating their rankings such as simply comparing records, and THIS is what I have a problem with.  TL;DR  It's pretty stupid to say ""just win and you'll be fine"".  Yes, if we were undefeated things would be different, but we aren't.  This doesn't change the fact that we are ranked wrong."
WisconsinBadgers,1oxwq0,dradam168,1 point,Tue Oct 22 22:15:46 2013 UTC,"but the games we have lost have been close and to very good competition   What part of the computer rankings is this?  They're still losses!  So let's examine the two loss teams to see if we're getting screwed.  LSU lost to (then healthy and ranked #9) Georgia and unranked Ole Miss.  LSU has beaten Auburn, Florida, and TCU (#20 at the time).  With those three wins, they have proven they belong where they are.  Texas A&M (#15) lost to #1 Alabama in a shootout and (now) #11 Auburn.  They haven't really beaten anyone.  Potentially over-ranked, probably because of Manziel.  Possibly the biggest argument can be made about South Carolina.  They lost to (healthy and #11) Georgia.  But they beat UCF (which now looks like a pretty good win).  But they slipped by Kentucky and now lost to Tennessee.  South Carolina has been consistently over-ranked all season (IMO).  But here's the thing...they won.  They beat Kentucky.  They beat Vanderbilt.  And (again, hate the system) that's all that matters.  They won.  So in the polls, they don't get punished when they win.  They may not move up a bunch for not winning big, but here's the thing:  you don't get punished for winning even if it's only by 1.  Now look at us.  We lost to #4 Ohio State.  We lost to #29 Arizona State.  We haven't beaten anyone and our Northwestern win looks more and more dismal as they keep falling. It doesn't matter if we beat the teams we're supposed to by 50.  We're supposed to.  Again, I completely agree with you.  We have the #6 Total Defense in the country and the #18 Scoring Offense and we're unranked.  I think it's bullshit too.  But I'm just trying to be devil's advocate and present a different side of the argument."

You remember that a full 2/3 of the BCS comes from human generated polls, right?  That part.  The part were HUMANS are supposed to be able to actually look at more than a couple numbers to determine the relative quality of a team.  Yes, a loss is a loss, but a close loss to someone like Ohio State is only barely worse than two weeks of squeaking out wins to the likes of Akron and UConn and certainly ISN'T worse than a loss to someone like E Washington."

WisconsinBadgers,1nfp0i,invulnerableHenchman,6,Mon Sep 30 12:40:22 2013 UTC,"I completely agree with the call.   If you get that one yard, great, you still have a long way to drive the ball to score and there's no guarantee you will.  If you don't get the yard, you just gave Ohio State the ball in field goal position and they'll probably turn it into a touchdown. You just lost the game.  You play the odds. If you make it, you're in a slightly better position to win, if you don't, you've pretty much guaranteed a loss."
WisconsinBadgers,1nfp0i,Dynasty471,2,Mon Sep 30 16:20:58 2013 UTC,"You play the odds. If you make it, you're in a slightly better position to win, if you don't, you've pretty much guaranteed a loss.   It's hard to find advanced stats for NCAA games but this calculator for NFL games should be somewhat similar.  Entering in the stats (4th and 1, own 17, ~6:50 to go, down 10) you find that going for the conversion has a winning percentage of 5%, punting yields an expected win percentage of 3%  Regardless of precise statistics, the chances of pulling out the win in that situation are slim.  I'd rather go down swinging."
WisconsinBadgers,1nfp0i,Dynasty471,2,Mon Sep 30 17:13:48 2013 UTC,"I'm not really familiar with the terminology used in this calculator, as in I don't know what WP or EP refer to so I really can't confirm what you're saying. Either way, these statistics are pretty one dimensional, and don't include anything on the teams besides the current game situation.  And to say we didn't go down swinging is pretty silly. We played that game hard until the end and we had a chance of tying the game."
WisconsinBadgers,1nfp0i,wackywiener,2,Mon Sep 30 18:19:25 2013 UTC,I'm not concerned in the slightest. We had a chance to tie. We didn't run out of time. The mental errors are the much bigger concern.

This is as much on the Wisconsin players as it is on the officials.   As if the Badgers should be responsible for pulling AZST guys off the dead ball.  Fantastically stupid suggestion.

The fact that people can be so stupid as to actually try and defend this call. If people actually recognized that it was a bad call and went, ""well, there's nothing we can do about it."" I would accept that, because there really isn't.  But if you're someone like my roommate (who is a Nebraska fan) and you say ""Oh, Stave never took a knee, he just put the ball down,"" ""Joel Stave is very much at fault too because he should have handed it to the referee,"" ""the Arizona players didn't hear the whistle, they can jump on the ball, it's human error"" ""the ref is just telling them to stop so he can get out the way,"" and ""referees always take the same amount of time to spot the ball before every play, they always lolligag like that."" Then I swear to fucking god I might snap and just straight up kill you.  I guess it doesn't help that Arizona State is just a massive school full of dumb fucks."

They knew the right thing to do was take the time to get it right, and they just didn't bother.  At least give the kicker a chance to miss the field goal.  (He's not a very good kicker.  Which is why they were probably centering it.). Oddly enough the best thing that could have happened is for the official to call it a turnover then they would have HAD to look at it in the replay booth.  I'm also kinda wondering why a reply official couldn't do something in this situation.  Maybe they can...anybody know for sure?"

I think that some fans want to have 6 seconds put back on the clock and a field goal attempt for the Badgers, but that is never going to happen.  This statement is far better then what the NFL gave last year after the ""Fail Mary"" and it makes me content knowing that they admitted there was a screw up; instead of just saying ""there was so much confusion and referees were trying hard to clear everything up and the clock unfortunately ran out"".  We are not going to get a W for that game - it is over and all we can hope for is that we finish the rest of the year strong and make a good bowl game (and hopefully win this year)."

WisconsinBadgers,1lurgu,Dynasty471,2,Fri Sep 6 14:23:07 2013 UTC,"I know that Clement is a fairly highly touted recruit, and he was probably against the idea, but I really wanted us to red shirt him.  We've got sooo many running backs. I figured it made more sense to have Jeff Lewis work the number three spot and Vontae Jackson as 4 at least until he recovers from his knee injury.  Then we can ease Clement into it and save his talent until after White graduates."

In the Big Ten, the Badgers have the most points and goals among returning players from last year.  I'm also looking forward to seeing how the the back end of the forwards will fall into place.  No Woods anymore, but Morgan Zulinick has good scoring ability, and will be a redshirt freshman after missing most of last season due to injury.  Jefferson Dahl showed some pretty good stuff scoring-wise last year on that Little-Dahl-Little line.  Then throw in Jedd Soleway for even more depth.  I can't wait to see a full season out of Kerdiles after finishing last year with the WCHA tournament MVP."

WisconsinBadgers,1k8mwf,wackywiener,3,Mon Aug 12 22:59:34 2013 UTC,How did the offensive line look? How did the secondary look?   These are my two concerns for this year.
WisconsinBadgers,1k8mwf,MisterMath,7,Tue Aug 13 00:57:07 2013 UTC,OL looked great from what I understood and saw. Secondary looked better than I expected.  Still some work but Musso looked great. Overall pretty decent I thought. WR looked awwwwful.
WisconsinBadgers,1k8mwf,hotcarl23,3,Tue Aug 13 01:22:10 2013 UTC,"I thought that Phillips looked the best at QB, followed by Stave, who showed flashes but had some struggles. I was not impressed by McEvoy, he made poor decisions, didn't step up in the pocket, and missed some throws.  Dezmen Southward looks like a goddamn beast, he got HUGE.   If Corey Clement doesn't get a few carries, I'll be stunned. He looked awesome.  The defense will be more exciting - last year, we didn't give up many big plays but didn't make too many, either. I think there will be more of both this year with the blitzes and inexperienced secondary."
WisconsinBadgers,1k8mwf,hotcarl23,2,Tue Aug 13 04:09:18 2013 UTC,I agree for the most part. I unfortunately thought Phillips looked the best but I just don't trust him. Stave looked like shit for most of the day especially the beginning - then the JA td which was something. I will say he looks much more mobile than I thought he was. More Aaron Rodgers than Tom Brady imo. McEvoy was trash - he's quick but the passes were horrendous. One ball where he just hucked it off his back foot- should have been a pick. Last I'll say about qbs - I wouldn't be surprised if Houston reenters the competition. I thought he looked great. Very decisive. I would have put him in a close third behind Stave but honestly just barely (Granted he was playing with and against third string).  Clement was nuts. Definitely going to get touches. Probably a good amount in close yardage stuff.  Definitely exciting defense. Hoping the secondary keeps getting better. Much better than I antcipated.
WisconsinBadgers,1k3hos,walkstar2,5,Sat Aug 10 17:10:37 2013 UTC,That is awesome especially core value #2.
WisconsinBadgers,1k3hos,ripple619,5,Sat Aug 10 17:13:29 2013 UTC,"I agree and I hope they take these to heart.  We need to run a clean football program. I love grabbing the headlines for winning, but one thing I am proud of is that Wisconsin does not grab headlines for sex scandals, stealing (I want to hear nothing from you Jack Ikegwonu), free items (shoe box scandal is behind us).  If we don't win every game and have a crappy season sure it sucks, but it's better than being Penn State, Ohio State, USC, or Miami. On Wisconsin!"

WisconsinBadgers,1jtjdy,WiscDC,3,Tue Aug 6 16:39:02 2013 UTC,It would be great if the USHL team was successful in Madison. Watching high level junior hockey at half the price of Badger tickets is outstanding. One could hope that if fans were drawn away from the Badgers (whom I love) that maybe UW would be inclined to offer better deals to get people through the doors of the Kohl center. It is getting much too expensive to go to Badger games and season tickets are almost just as expensive as buying day of. More hockey is always good!
WisconsinBadgers,1jtjdy,BuckyCop,3,Tue Aug 6 17:32:50 2013 UTC,"One could hope that if fans were drawn away from the Badgers (whom I love) that maybe UW would be inclined to offer better deals to get people through the doors of the Kohl center.    I've been one of those fans who has been vocal about specific negatives that they need to fix at the Kohl Center to improve attendance.  From what I've heard, those in the athletic department is already making efforts to try and improve fan relations and get fans to come back, because of significant attendance woes in the past couple of seasons.   It is getting much too expensive to go to Badger games and season tickets are almost just as expensive as buying day of.   This is a big issue, IMO.  First of all, those five-game ticket packages aren't even discounted!  Sports teams, at various levels, often have packages of tickets for those who want to get to several games, but won't commit to buying a whole or half season plan.  Those tickets are offered at a discount off of the single-game price.  The regular season tickets should be less per-game than they are.  Also, the best seat in the arena (whatever that may be) is $24, and an obstructed view seat in upper deck end seating is $20.  That seems pretty silly to me.  A tiered pricing system would make more sense.  I'm hoping that this USHL team will succeed, but not at the expense of the Badgers.  Obviously, the Wisconsin Badgers brand and a higher level of hockey mean that the USHL team won't be taking significant numbers of fans from the Kohl Center, so they'll have to get other fans.  I'm hoping that those who don't go to many (or any) games at the Kohl Center will consider going to cheaper games at the Coliseum, which may be a better option for those living nearer to that venue.  While the competition issue is obvious, I could see the USHL team, should it manage to be successful, strengthening the local hockey scene as another piece along side the Badgers."
