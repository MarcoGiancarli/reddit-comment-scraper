I'll only help on the make table if it's a large order and might affect my delivery time.   Regarding your primary question, it depends on the manager for me. With one, he only does the fryer. The other does surfaces and might sweep if I'm in-and-out all night with deliveries.  When I'm closing as manager I'll do floors, surfaces, the fryer, and, if I'm able to, help out with dishes since I'm familiar with closing."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3e19cy,Siddabear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:40 2015 UTC,"Base level drivers at my store make 4 and minimum split wage (which was 7.25 might be 7.50 now or soon). They are expected to answer phones, cut pizzas and top pizzas. Unless they are a closer or opener, then they also need to know how to slap out a skin as well. All drivers are expected to clean and maintain the store.  If your manager does not do any cleaning then they are jerks, lazy, or you are missing something.  A good manager delegates fairly and when time allows does assigned cleaning/tasks for other people so they can cut the labor costs by sending people home.  If they don't do this, it's no sweat off my back. I get paid by the hour. I do what's assigned and call it a night."

But drivers do boxes, dishes, clean surfaces, etc. I know when I close, I take care of the makeline and cut table, so all they have to clean is dishes and sweep/mop.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dxk3u,ThatOneGuyDotNet,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"Visa/MasterCard/ect say you go by the total.    I, as an employee, do not give a shit what Visa/Mastercard/ect  have to say about this issue. The tip is a transaction between the customer and myself, AFAIK no third party can make a decision regarding my property.    Failure to do so can cost them the entire charge.   ""them"" being who? You need to be specific. Is this ""them"" the credit card company? ""Them"" the employer, the entity that assumes all financial risk in their business venture; include the risks associated with accepting credit card transactions. ""Them"" being the tipped employee?   Multiple failures to follow the rules could result in inability to accept whatever brand bans you.   No brand will ever band a specific tipped employee. A brand might decide that a business is not abiding by the agreement that entity made with the brand."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dxk3u,redditcoruum,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"You're right, I could have been more clear. Let me try again.  Your employer has to agree to visa's terms which include not charging more than the authorized total (which may or may not require proof of signature, based on the check total, if requested by Visa). If your employer charges more, Visa could revoke their ability to participate in the Visa acceptance program due to failure to meet the terms. Not likely to happen unless it happens a lot, but possible. Any person (ie a manager) that knowingly charges more than the authorized amount is technically comitting C.C. fraud and could also risk personal criminal charges.  The customer told you he was going to give you $5 and handed you $4...it sucks but that's what happened. Your employer owes you nothing more than the extra amount they collected over their portion of the charge (although they may pay it to be nice)."

I hope you do not take this as a personal attack, I am attacking your assumptions.   I don't see it as a personal attack. I'm a very blunt person myself so I enjoy people being able to have a civilized discussion but also not feel like they need kid gloves. It is worth noting that none of these are assumptions. I have researched all of this as part of one of my projects at work (writing credit auth validations and procedures into restaurant register software).  Also this information is just what is supposed to happen, not what usually happens.  (As some of the comments mention, some restaurants will pre-auth a tip amount which is wrong and can also get their Visa/MC/Amex privilages revoked, but they'll probably be able to operate for decades without any fall out actually occurring)   Your employer has to agree to visa's terms which include not charging more than the authorized total (which may or may not require proof of signature, based on the check total, if requested by Visa).   Yes, I agree. The employer agreed to those terms, at no time did I agree to those terms.

As soon as a tip has been created, by means of writing the tip amount down on the line or increasing the total amount on the line, then that tip becomes the property of the tipped employee. That there is ambiguity in the amounts is the risk of the employer, not the employee.   Here's the thing... you have absolutely no authority to collect money from that credit card.  The company is the only one with that authority and they only have the authority based on the ""total"" line.  Nothing else matters.  At that point, they take what they are owed and record the remainder as tip. If you put a different total into the machine than what is on that piece of paper and I catch it due to a closing audit or the customer challenging the charge, I would fire you because it's not worth risking my business. You don't know which part the customer wrote wrong, you don't know their intent. You could probably make a fairly accurate assumption but that's not good enough when it comes to contracts. (Every credit card transaction is a small contract between the card holder and the business charging the card)  Some con artists will do exactly what happened to you and then challenge the charge when the wrong total is added to their statement.  It's not usually the case, but it does happen.   If your employer charges more, Visa could revoke their ability to participate in the Visa acceptance program due to failure to meet the terms.   The employer is not charging more. The tipped employee is claiming their property. If the customer wishes to contest the amount, they can do so. I am not a party to the dealings between my employer and their credit card company.   It isn't your property until the business can collect it to pay it out to you.  If the entire credit card charge gets denied then they could refuse the entire tip (manager's call since it would come out of their expenses). Just because the customer said they were going to give you a million dollars does not mean that your employer owes you a million dollars if they can't collect it.   Any person (ie a manager) that knowingly charges more than the authorized amount is technically comitting C.C. fraud and could also risk personal criminal charges.   Possibly. I do not allow management to become involved when I report my tips. I may ask their opinion, but their opinion only holds the exact amount of weight I decide to give it.   Addressed above. If it were my business and an employee had that attitude then they wouldn't work for me very long. A) Their opinion does matter because they are your boss. B) Charging the wrong amount is illegal and puts the company at risk on many levels.   The customer told you he was going to give you $5 and handed you $4...   You have now changed the scenario. Please address the scenario at hand and not make up a scenario to support your conclusions.   Addressed above.   The customer was unclear in their intent. Since this transaction is between the customer and I, I will ultimately decide what their intent was. I am not unreasonable when I make these decisions.   You don't get to make that decision, the terms of the credit card issuing company have already decided what happens in this scenario.  It is not up for debate.   *Edit: removed an unformed response here  Your employer owes you nothing more than the extra amount they collected over their portion of the charge (although they may pay it to be nice).

I have researched all of this as part of one of my projects at work (writing credit auth validations and procedures into restaurant register software).    Sweet, you're going to provide evidence... wait... no you're not.  You're just attempting to assert some type of authoritative knowledge without proving that you actually are an authority. Great job! You almost had me there. I almost believed you were an authority on this subject. Sadly though...   Also this information is just what is supposed to happen, not what usually happens. (As some of the comments mention, some restaurants will pre-auth a tip amount which is wrong and can also get their Visa/MC/Amex privilages revoked, but they'll probably be able to operate for decades without any fall out actually occurring)   Really? You mean like when I see a pre-authorized tip on the majority of the web based orders I took tonight? I bet Papa Johns Intl would love to know this. They've only been doing this for going on 10 years.   Hey guys!!! Do any of your employer allow a pre-authorized tip? If so your employer is violating... wait... uhmmm... ThatOneGuyDotNet , what exactly are the employers violating?   __Comments on your first paragraph__  As I started reading your first paragraph, I thought/hoped that maybe you'd actually provide something more than just your assumptions/opinion. Sadly though you have not provided any evidence, just fanciful conjecture.  While you may be correct in your understanding of the agreement between the business and the credit card company, that has little bearing on the issue at hand. What is sad is that you believe the knowledge you do have, writing credit card auth validation code, is applicable to the topic at hand.  _____ Next paragraph_____   Here's the thing... you have absolutely no authority to collect money from that credit card.    At no time did I make any assertion that I have authority to collect money from the credit card. My assertion is that the employer has no right to make a decision regarding the amount of my tip.    The company is the only one with that authority and they only have the authority based on the ""total"" line. Nothing else matters.    I am going to give you the opportunity to walk back this statement. I highly suggest you do so. If you do not understand why I am giving you this opportunity, just say so and I will illustrate the absurdity of  this statement.   At that point, they take what they are owed and record the remainder as tip.    Cool! But damn... I cannot comment any further because of that really stupid statement you made. Once you correct/walk back that statement I'll hopefully remember why I thought this one sentence of yours was cool.   If you put a different total into the machine than what is on that piece of paper and I catch it due to a closing audit or the customer challenging the charge, I would fire you because it's not worth risking my business.    Uhmm... no, you would not. You would not because you are not my employer. Here's the thing... I've had this conversation with my employer, in the personage of my General Manager, many times. I actually had the conversation today, discussing this topic with my employer, and she agrees with me. Funny how that works. One person can have an opinion and another person can have a completely opposite opinion. And they're both correct!   Wait.. I mean wrong. No... wait...    If you put a different total into the machine than what is on that piece of paper and I catch it due to a closing audit or the customer challenging the charge, I would fire you because it's not worth risking my business.    I find this hilarious. How long have you been in this business? And how much law have you studied? And where did you study law? Its not your business though, it is?    You don't know which part the customer wrote wrong, you don't know their intent.    You know what... you're correct. And I do no care.    You could probably make a fairly accurate assumption but that's not good enough when it comes to contracts. (Every credit card transaction is a small contract between the card holder and the business charging the card)   Oh.. ohh.. yummy. You mentioned contract, yet you fail to understand that the contract between my employer and their credit card company cannot be used to deprive me of my property, that which is the tip. I am also aware that each card transaction is a small contract... and it is the responsibility of the person writing that contract to be explicit in their intent. Any ambiguity of the contract cannot, or should not, be held against a party that is not a party of that contract... the tipped employee.    Some con artists will do exactly what happened to you and then challenge the charge when the wrong total is added to their statement. It's not usually the case, but it does happen.   Yes, I agree that some con artists will do this. So what? Really.. so fucking what? Has absolutely no bearing on me. It has a bearing on the business, not me. If the charge back is created it is the business what bears the financial burden, as it should be.   __Comments on your second paragraph__  While what you have said may be true in every sense, it still has no bearing on me, or any other tipped employee. The employer has a statutory obligation to process the tip, since it is the employer that set up that condition. Do you understand what I have just said? Specific legislation was passed, in the body of the FLSA, that creates the statutory obligation of the employer to process the tip. That obligation supercedes the contractual obligation made between the employer and the employer's chosen means of financial transaction methods.   Now, you may be able to prove me wrong: Are you able to find an interpretation of the FLSA, by the Federal Department of Labor or any other authoritative body, that contradicts my assertion? If you are able, please provide a link to that reference material; I would really like to be proven wrong. For in being proven wrong I will further educate myself.  __Next paragraph__  End of Part 1"
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dxk3u,redditcoruum,0,Tue Jul 21 09:50:05 2015 UTC,"Part 2  Pre Edit: I don't know how you got those multiple quotes working for you, I've never been able to do it. I may have to edit this a few times to get the formatting correct. I prefer to write my longer responses in a word processor and then transfer the totality to the little box that reddit provides.   You don't know which part the customer wrote wrong, you don't know their intent.    You know what... you're correct. And I do not care.    You could probably make a fairly accurate assumption but that's not good enough when it comes to contracts. (Every credit card transaction is a small contract between the card holder and the business charging the card)    Oh.. ohh.. yummy. You mentioned contract, yet you fail to understand that the contract between my employer and their credit card company cannot be used to deprive me of my property, that which is the tip. I am also aware that each card transaction is a small contract... and it is the responsibility of the person writing that contract to be explicit in their intent.

Some con artists will do exactly what happened to you and then challenge the charge when the wrong total is added to their statement. It's not usually the case, but it does happen.   It isn't your property until the business can collect it to pay it out to you.    Seriously...? This is another statement you need to walk back. You need to walk it back because you obviously have no idea what you are talking about. Here's the thing (YEP.. I did it AGAIN!!) when I walk out the door at the end of the night I walk out the door with 100% of my tips; including the pre-authorized tips, and those tips that have been entered in according to what I believe the customer's intent was (assuming the customer was vague in their intent).    If the entire credit card charge gets denied then they could refuse the entire tip (manager's call since it would come out of their expenses).    Not my problem. The employer chose that method of transaction, they assume all risks to their choice. I assume none of those risks. Once has a gratuity been denied to me by a representative of my employer when the transaction method was in the form of a credit card. My employer paid me that gratuity, even though the third party (not even the credit card company) denied the tip.   And it is NOT the manager's call. It would also not come out of the manager's expenses. It would come out of the business owners accounts. Because it is the business owners responsibility to accept all risk in their financial endeavor. If the customer committed fraud, against my employer, that is my employers problem; my employer better damn well pay out my tip or they will pay more for a lawyer to defend their illegal actions by denying me my property.   Just because the customer said they were going to give you a million dollars does not mean that your employer owes you a million dollars if they can't collect it.    Uhmmm... worthless example. See now you're becoming ridiculous. How about you stay on the side of reasonable. If you decide not to be reasonable I will not be able to continue this discussion.  But I'll even respond. Yes, it does mean that my employer is responsible for making good that 1 million dollar gratuity, IF the customer has the means to make good that gratuity. I'd even allow my employer the time necessary to verify that the customer is able to make good on that gratuity, and that the customer really intended to make good. I am not unreasonable.  Now if the customer only has a $10,0000 limit on their credit card, then obviously they cannot make good; so they can make good by making good on the remaining credit limit they currently have on that credit card. But honestly... I wouldn't expect them, my employer, to make good.. because I know that scenario is FUCKING RIDICULOUS. And it makes you look ridiculous by putting it forth.  __Comments on your third paragraph__  Well... I really hoped you'd be intelligent and reasonable about this, I got my hopes up. That sucks.  __Next paragraph__   If it were my business and an employee had that attitude then they wouldn't work for me very long.     Cool. It's not though, is it? So step down from your pedestal.  Ohh and yes, I would. I am sure the owner of the franchise I work with holds the same opinion you do, but for some reason I still work there. I wonder why that might be. I can make some educated guesses... but that information is reserved for people I know and trust.   A) Their opinion does matter because they are your boss.    So what? Seriously.. so fucking what? Does their being my boss remove from them their legal obligations to me? No. Does them being my boss give them the right to effectively steal from me? No.   B) Charging the wrong amount is illegal and puts the company at risk on many levels.    While you may be correct, you have not provided one shred of evidence that it is illegal. What you mean to say though, I believe, is that charging the wrong amount violates the agreement between the business and the credit card company. That does not make the act illegal, unless of course you can provide evidence that a law or statute has been violated.  __Next Paragraph__   You don't get to make that decision, the terms of the credit card issuing company have already decided what happens in this scenario. It is not up for debate.    Sure I do. And yes, it is up for debate. It is up for debate simply because I say so. It is also up for debate because you are debating me. It is also up for debate because the NLRA says it is open for debate because it is a term or condition of employment.   __Next Paragraph__   You can disagree all you like but your employer does not owe you money it did not actually collect.    Sure they do. They owe me the tips that their customers made a contract to provide me. The employer has an obligation to process that tip and give it to me, since that tip is MY property. The tip is my property, in accordance to the The United States Department of Labor's interpretation of the the FLSA; which is a law, created through legislation which (AFAIK/IIRC) supercedes any contract my employer makes with a third party that would effectively deny me my property.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dxk3u,homergonerson,0,Mon Jul 20 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"The manager him or herself does not necessarily have a financial incentive, but that person is the embodiment of the employer, the business. The employer/business has a financial incentive to lie, obfuscate, or omit; these actions allow the employer/business to create or retain the profit associated with their business venture. In this scenario, where the employer decides what your tip is, directly benefits the employer because it is an attempt, by the employer, to remove the financial hardship; charge backs.  The employer has a right to make decisions regarding their portion of the credit card transaction, not that portion of the transaction that is the property of the tipped employee.   Charge backs cost the employer money, because, IIRC/AFAIK, the employer is responsible for defending what occurred. If a tip, paid via a credit card is paid out, and later the customer files a charge back, the charge back is assessed against the employer, including that tip amount, not against the employee. If the charge back is upheld, and the employer accepts the charge back, then the total amount of the credit card charge is deducted against the employer, including the tip amount. In this scenario the employer has no, AFAIK, legal authority to assess damages against the tipped employee.  That's their financial interest."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dt5vl,telepathetic_monkey,10,Mon Jul 20 13:38:23 2015 UTC,My first time posting here. I am beyond aggravated from my company's habits of promising raises/promotions to people only to get them to do something or work a little harder until they can fully staff their store. Then they just blow you off on the raise. I've got managers who haven't gotten raises in 4 years and new to the company management comes in making more than them. I was outspoken about how I see my fellow coworkers and myself being screwed over. Now I am basically stuck at minimum wage until I find something new. (I work for a company owned papa John's.) I also realize that pizza is not a highly paying job field but the way the company treats its employees is downright ridiculous.

So if you have touch screens there is a good chance it will be messed up.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dt5vl,redditcoruum,3,Sun Jul 19 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"Being a corporate store for Papa John's SUCKS SO MUCH. Corporate expects certain things, and for some reason, our town is completely unpredictable. They'll send our district manager to inspect everything, but she always comes on the slowest possible days (again, unpredictable) and always wonders why our numbers are so bad. We're currently on GM #3, imported from a nearby store, about an hour from town. I wonder how long it'll take for them to realize that it's not the general manager's fault that some things don't go as they should. There's one assistant manager who is just terrible under pressure. We'll get three orders on the screen, and she will lose her shit. Everything is so god damned dramatic. And her friend whom she hired as a driver is the same way. She'll be on cut, and slam a pizza down, ""DELIVERY UP."" So fucking loud, you'd swear the people waiting at their house heard her. When I'm cutting, I'll spin the box around, ""Delivery to 609 Nelson"" calmly and loud enough to be heard over the oven. I told her to calm down once. We had maybe five orders on the routing computer, and she lost it. ""I can't calm down, I have a job to do!"" I just stared at her. The reason you NEED to calm down is BECAUSE you have a job to do. If you're pulling your hair out, you can't do your job correctly! She called me smart ass. I called her a bitch. I got upbraided for it.  The one manager, who's only a few years older than I (I'm 20), HE knows how to run the fucking store. He doesn't yell at anyone, he treats the customers well, he treats the employees well. And good Lordy, does he slap out some beautiful pies. His dad is an insurance agent, and everyone agrees that he should convince him to buy the store for him. We got a plaque from corporate verifying that we are a ""Million Dollar Store"", so it'll pay for itself pretty quickly.  That's what I hate about Papa John's."

That would be enough tips to make up the difference between his direct wage contribution and minimum wage?  Edit: What he is doing is laying a paper trail so he can terminate you. Since you do not consistently report enough tips to make up the spread he is paying you more than drivers that do report enough to cover that spread. Have you responded to that written reprimand yet?

But yes, basically it seems I recieved it for not reporting enough tips to cover the 'spread'. The problem is, I DO report every last penny I get in tips, even the 'Keep the [$0.01] change"".

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dsqso,redditcoruum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think the write up specifically mentions tips,   Did the person that talked to you mention tips in the conversation? If they did, then the reprimand was about you not reporting enough tips. Do not accept what they put in writing, they do this so they can create a paper trail to provide some justification for terminating you. You need to create your own paper trail to protect yourself.   we don't get copies of the reprimand,   I'd ask what State you live in, to investigate whether you should be receiving a copy or whether you can request a copy of your personnel file, but if you do not feel comfortable doing so I understand. If you'd prefer to provide that information in private then just send me a private message.  Regardless of whether you receive a copy you should put in your own words what was said during the ""counseling"" session. If your employer's representative said something to the effect ""he was looking over my pay history, and I am not claiming 3/hr in tips""; this could easily ( and would most likely be deemed extortion (I could be using the wrong word to describe this action) by the NLRB) be construed as extortion that you are required to claim at least the amount of tips to make up the tip credit allowance. This you should put in writing, I would suggest in an email, and send it to yourself and someone else you trust. If you'd like we can discuss what I'd put in writing if this were to happen to me.   I didn't actually read it all the way through.   I suggest in the future you do read through and demand a copy of anything you are expected to sign or acknowledge. That anyone does not demand a copy of something they sign boggles my mind.   But yes, basically it seems I received it for not reporting enough tips to cover the 'spread'. The problem is, I DO report every last penny I get in tips, even the 'Keep the [$0.01] change"". See another post here for how last night went; it has been pretty typical lately.   This is VERY important, and I am glad that you said this, because now I can tell you that your employer is so full of shit and has opened itself to legal action, if he uses this write up as a reason for terminating you.   Your employer has made this an issue of pay, so you should return the favor and address that issue, in an appropriate manner which will put your employer on the defensive and protect you in the future. My suggest would be to compose a response to the reprimand and illustrate the following...   That your employer's representative brought up, verbally, during the counseling session that the reason you were wrote up was due to the fact that you are not reporting enough tips to cover the tip credit. That you report 100% of your tips. That you were not made aware of any actual complaints made against you for poor customer service, at the time of the reprimand. And that you have a good faith belief that the reason for the reprimand was to extort you to claim more tips than you actually earned.   Once you put that in writing, have someone you trust accompany you to your employer and present this to your employer, (make sure you have copies and that your witness signs/initials each true copy) and request that this document be added to your personnel file.  It doesn't matter whether they accept the document, just by writing it up you've created some significant protection against retaliation for addressing this issue (since this issue is truly about pay/wages). If your employer declines to accept the document just accept that, but keep the document yourself and further write on the document that your employer refused to accept this rebuttal of your written reprimand.  When/if you mysteriously start losing hours or receive other bullshit written reprimands, you can use those actions against your employer; that's what is considered retaliation and it is a violation of federal law. If you get written up again (for a bullshit reason) you should absolutely demand, respectively, a copy of the document and inform your employer verbally that you believes this newest reprimand is retaliation for having addressed this original reprimand and that retaliation is a violation of the law; willful violations may result in additional punitive damages (I don't know this for certain, it depends on your location).  If you are terminated you can use these reprimands to file an unfair labor practice with, at least, the NLRB; and you can use this information, possibly, to counter your employer's refusal to pay unemployment.  Edit: I'd also suggest that if you have a coworker (delivery driver) that you trust, ask them if they have received a similar type of written reprimand. If this is a common practice, of the employer, to extort the tipped employees to report more tips than they've actually earned, then your employer could be in much more trouble, bankruptable amounts of trouble."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dsqso,laosimerah,3,Sun Jul 19 15:16:52 2015 UTC,Seems that you (along with countless other customers) can't understand that a delivery charge that doesn't go to the driver has become industry standard.  That's why notices have to be placed on boxes.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dsqso,redditcoruum,-2,Sun Jul 19 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"That's why you might want to maybe blame your store, but the customer? The customer if paying for something with no obvious reason? Part of the surcharge should be given to you. It's a delivery surcharge and you're delivering and you're hired and are working for the company which charges this fee.  I'm from Europe btw. I've noticed quite a huge difference in attitude. I think the company is dishonest and making extra profit off your backs.  If there is some law which allows this, it should be changed as it's quite clear most think it's entirely normal that you get part of the delivery fee."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dsqso,redditcoruum,3,Sun Jul 19 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"The store has costs associated with delivery. Drivers may get the bulk of their money in tips, but the store still pays them something. It's entirely reasonable to charge more for delivery.  What would not be reasonable would be the store charging for delivery, not giving it to the drivers, but making customers think it's a substitute for a tip. Fortunately, this doesn't really happen. Every store I've seen that has a delivery charge makes it very clear when you order that the delivery charge is not a tip, nor a substitute for a tip."

The store introduces this, your tips go down.  There have been various times where people mentioned that such a surcharge was introduced. Meaning, it didn't exist before. Then suddenly 2.50 USD more.  Ps, getting downvotes because of a different mindset is sad. Travel and see the world. What's normal and logical in one country is totally strange in another.

Plus perks like getting free food (cancelled orders) is nice. I would also say I feel more ""connected"" with my city. More street smart. I know it's side streets and alleys, and I know it's people  CONS: Well, there is the wear and tear on your car, and you are putting yourself at greater risk of getting in an accident with this job. Seriously. I must have the luck of the devil because I am the only one at the store that has not been in an accident. Both of my best friends work with me. One had his car totaled. Two had his mirror taken off and his car hit when it was just parked. Everyone's luck runs out eventually.     Also you are taking a job that is socially looked down upon. Awkwardly delivering pizza to all the people you went to highschool with sound fun? Nope. You take a lot of bullshit because you are a lowly pizza guy. You will be blamed for bullshit corporate policies and just take the brunt of stupid people's outrage at the littlest things. If you have no patience, DO NOT TAKE THIS JOB. If your delivery radius is like anyone elses, there will be some sketchy ass places you deliver to, so you are putting yourself at risk too.  Other Cons: You may or may not lose faith in humanity/ patience with people on the roads. Be warned.    Overall though, I'd say don't work both jobs. You'll find yourself with no time to have fun over summer. And I think everyone should enjoy summer when the weather is nice."

The cooks/managers will be making pizzas ordered 30-45 minutes prior. When it's that busy too, we often have to wait for other orders to come out of the oven that are located close to each other. Drivers also usually do other things in the store like answer calls, help carry out customers, etc. There have been plenty of times where my delivery has been ready but I'm stuck on the phone with some moron who takes 10 minutes to place an order. Just because it took a long time to get your order doesn't mean it was sitting out for a long time. Almost always, the order will be bagged and out the door in 5-10 minutes max.

Late at night, we're usually just running with 2 drivers and a manager, so if I get sent out to the edge of our delivery area, I'm not going to make it back for about 30 minutes if I break ALL THE LAWS and hit all the green lights. If there's two deliveries in opposite directions, that means there's no one to deliver the pizzas for a good half hour, and when we get back, there's 5 orders to take. This is commonly why you'll see us ""out for delivery"" for 20 minutes, even though you only live five minutes from the store: someone's order was even later than yours, and got the priority, and the drivers are taking both (or maybe even three runs) at the same time.  We do a pretty decent job of keeping the food hot while they're waiting, and the newer hot bags are really good at keeping them warm on the way to you, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't microwaved.."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,nutbastard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I really don't mind microwaved. I can't tell, but I assume it's possible. However, it's a chain. They will have extra thermal bags around, probably used for stuff like this.  It was at around 2 PM, so it wasn't late or anything. That being said, I can imagine the guy was out / at the end of the delivery area or something like that also. Traffic also takes blame there."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,Catsowntheinternet,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, 2PM, that CAN be just as bad. Usually at OUR store we only have one driver and the Manager in until around 4, so it's even easier for one long run delivery to back things up (the back ups are just a lot quicker to recover from). It almost never happens, but if three people all order at once during lunch, someone's getting the short end of the stick. Sorry that was you this time :("
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,Stealthy_Lehninger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"They usually have 2 drivers on, so it's weird that they only had 1 guy that day."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,TheDoctorDi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"First off, no microwaves.  We have heat racks we store the orders on until they are taken out for delivery.  Second, managers fudge numbers.  One way to do this is to bump the order from the make line screen as soon as it appears.  6 minutes later, it automatically switches to 'Checked for quality.'  It's possible that the pizza isn't even in the oven at this point.  Lastly, if it fails the quality check it has to be remade.  We don't have any way to indicate this on the Tracker, just it just stays listed as 'Checked for Quality' until a driver signs it out.    Basically what I'm saying is the Pizza Tracker isn't gospel as to the status of your order.  In fact, I wouldn't trust it at all.  We don't have a bar code that gets scanned through each step of the process."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,Triassic_Bark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:11 2015 UTC,The pizza tracker is actually on point all the time. Drivers always take ~20-30 minutes depending on the traffic to deliver the pizza. It shows the little ___ is delivering your order thing right after the quality check.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,Triassic_Bark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:58:59 2015 UTC,"It was on the ""Checked for Quality"" thing for ~40 minutes, which means that it's already made and waiting for the driver.   Gotcha... yeah that's bad, someone dropped the ball for sure. Best case scenario someone 'checked for quality' by accident without it actually having been made."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,slim_chance,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"It's always the same person making the pizzas and checking for quality, so it'd be really odd for them to mess up there."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,Triassic_Bark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:14:57 2015 UTC,"It was probably due to the store getting slammed and simply waiting on a driver to get back to take it out. Or it may have had to have been remade.  I had one double run the other day where the guy was asleep - I went on to second delivery and then back to him, it added a bunch of time :("
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,Triassic_Bark,2,Sun Jul 19 03:30:20 2015 UTC,"Sometimes we get a load of deliveries at once, sometimes we crash the bikes and have to remake the pizza, sometimes there's a bunch of traffic, and sometimes we simply get lost. If there's three deliveries in the bike and you're last on the list it's going to take a bit longer.  It makes no sense for us to screw around before the pizza is delivered. After it's delivered is another story though ;)"
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3djqkq,Triassic_Bark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:35:41 2015 UTC,"None of my drivers for the local chain have bikes, everyone uses a car.  I think the screwing around just happens on the really dull days. I've heard some people on this sub say that whenever it's a boring day, they take an order and then spend some time just outside of the store because it's better than the dullness."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dhn25,hawk-651,8,Thu Jul 16 10:11:18 2015 UTC,"Nope - I have a delivery job because of a weird sleeping schedule.  DSPD - Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder.  With a day job it's kind of a bitch. I'm wired to work at night. Have been my whole life. My dad has it and my uncle had it (RIP) and it's way easier to mold my life around my sleep than to mold my sleep around my life.   Any good remedies for this?   I'd recommend getting up at a normal hour like 9 or 10am and then killing the time before work, but honestly for the sake of safety and sanity... you really don't want to start your shift having been awake for 7 or 8 hours and end it having been awake for 16 hours. Fatigued driving is dangerous as hell - not just for you, but for other people. You could easily ruin your life as you know it by mowing down a drunk pedestrian who wandered into the street.  Dealing with the moment-to-moment unknowns while driving is hard enough when you're rested and alert.  It's a lifestyle, not unlike long haul trucking or being a firefighter. I say either embrace the wonkiness or consider changing jobs."

When I was growing up I would lay in bed for hours awake after being forced to go to bed.  Getting up to an alarm clock was torture every morning.  Now I go to bed when I'm tired, around 4-5 in the morning, and wake up naturally around noon, just like I've done pretty much my whole life."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dhn25,Laurim,5,Thu Jul 16 10:43:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah used to deliver for a sandwich shop in a college town that was open until 3:00 AM on weeknights and 4:00 AM Friday/Saturday. That was fun. Being in Michigan at the time, there were entire days that would go by in the winter without seeing the sun at all. Wake up around 5:00 PM as it's getting dark out, go to work, get off around 4-5:00 AM stay up watching TV or partying with people from work until 7 or 8. (Yes, when you work that schedule pretty much the only people to hang out with are your coworkers.) Go to sleep and restart. It was not the best of times..."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dhn25,Merovingion,3,Thu Jul 16 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"Weird ? no.  I'd call it ideal.  We start delivering for lunch and up to closing time. I work mostly lunches through diner.  I go to bed when I'm tired or feeling sleepy and wake up without an alarm clock, been doing so for a few years now.  I consider it a really nice perk to my job. I normally wake early but not early enough not to need an alarm clock if I were on a seven or eight to five job which is very common around here.  I really dislike being woken up, especially by an alarm clock."

After a few months, I dropped it and went back to delivering. Much happier since.  I'm one of the main opening drivers at my store, so my days don't start till 11.

For example, where a credit card company charges an employer 3 percent on all sales charged to its credit service, the employer may pay the tipped employee 97 percent of the tips without violating the FLSA. However, this charge on the tip may not reduce the employee's wage below the required minimum wage. The amount due the employee must be paid no later than the regular pay day and may not be held while the employer is awaiting reimbursement from the credit card company.

What I did was really unprofessional, but it felt so damn good.  I left the store at 10:45 pm and was supposed to be off at 11 pm. After waiting 15 mins in the lobby of the station; I thought, ""No problem, He's a cop and deserves respect, I'll wait a little longer"" after 30 mins total, he FINALLY came down and then wrote a huge X on the tip line. It was the end of a long day, and the cops have a habit of making us wait way too long in the lobby and then not tipping. I was mad so I looked him in the eye and said ""Next time you make someone wait half an hour to give you your pizza, you should probably tip."" and walked off.  I got into my car and turned it on when I heard a tap on my window. The cop had followed me out without saying anything. I rolled down the window and he gave me some BS about having a ""thing"" about tipping on cards. Like he didn't think it was safe or something. I looked him dead in the eye and told him ""Look, I need this job and I was raised to respect cops. I've probably said too much already so I'll just let you fill in the blanks. Have a good night officer."" I rolled up my window and drove away. Told my manager she'd probably be getting a complaint about me and told her the story. She told me she was more mad that I waited that long for the cop to come down.  Unprofessional? Absolutely. Did it feel good? Oh yes."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3df3tc,mightaswellfuck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:50:20 2015 UTC,"A chicken is like five bucks, a head of kale, a dollar & sweet potatoes .30 a lb. One hour prep and cook, same as the delivery wait.  So for seven dollars you could feed 3 or 4 people. That won't even buy a medium pizza."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3df3tc,atomsk404,3,Thu Jul 16 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"the point your making is totally valid and I completely support it.  that being said this is a bad way to make it... Like ""oh let me just whip up this fucking roasted chicken organic kale whatever-the-fuck""  people are busy..especially poor people...and nobody has the time to sit there and process all that shit...oh and a chicken that cheap probably hasnt been deboned or trimmed of fat so have fun doing that before you can even start your hour long cook time"
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3df3tc,mommy2libras,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Who debones a whole chicken? You stick some butter under the skin and pop it in the oven for an hour.  This is how I cooked when I was poor...still do even though I'm not anymore, cause $50 lasts two weeks in food. I've spent fifty bucks on two people getting Thai food take out...That's two weeks of groceries! You make the time to check sales and make a plan, if you need that little boost to your wallet.  I would argue most poor people who are smart / frugal do...it's the stupid people who also happen to be poor that don't. I mean, there are hundreds of ""peasant cooking"" dishes out there...they came from smart poor people who knew you can make something really good with not a lot of money.   Hell I made beef stroganoff the other day with a box of noodles, one cup sour cream, a lb of beef, a package of mushrooms, an onion & a few cups of beef broth. Total cost was 8 dollars, and it made seven helpings.  Granted, sometimes the last thing I want to do is cook...but to say people getting two large pizzas from Dominos is cheaper than making ""normal human food"" is way wrong."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3df3tc,atomsk404,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're making the assumption that cooking is an innate skill or something, a lot of people have no idea wtf to do with a whole chicken if they even have access to an oven or stove."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3df3tc,TannerRed,3,Thu Jul 16 04:55:13 2015 UTC,"I think you overestimate people. I can cook and I can cook well. I can take things you never dreamed would work together and feed people. I grew up poor but there was usually something I could scrounge from the deep freeze or garden and feed us. I also had people in my family who cooked so I picked up things from them (my dad and uncle) when they were cooking or talking about it. But many people have never been around things like that. A recipe that looks easy to you or me leaves them with a bunch of questions. There are a lot of things I just know that they have no idea what they mean. Sure, they could buy a whole chicken but assuming they actually cooked it tight in the first place, that's what they're eating for the next few days- just toasted chicken. I can make leftover chicken into at least 20 different meals, using things I may have around. This is another place where some people would just stand and stare and eventually start ripping off handfuls of cold chicken and just eating it."

I'm sorry you feel singled out because of your age, but if I was going o say this to anyone, it would be to everyone regardless of age. :)  It's kind of MEANT to make people aware and put people on the spot (which is why I don't personally do it) because like a few others keep mentioning all around, they just didn't know that the tip was supposed to be separate from the delivery fee, or that there's even an option to tip on the card at all, or exactly for this reason- friends don't tip on friends' cards (or with friends' cash) unless they're told to.

I'm in a fast growing section of the city, and we are almost always busy. I take home an avg of $100 a night in tips/mileage and the customers tend to have money. I could probably work every day of the week if I wanted to. The overall distances are usually pretty short and I can take triple and quadruple runs when it gets really busy.   Drawbacks: Traffic jams during the evening rush hour, not many good places to park. I dealt with these by learning ways to get around that won't be jammed as badly, and bought a tiny car so I could park it more easily.   Also a downside: Rent and home prices are in the clouds. It could be worth it to live on the outskirts and commute in to work in the city.   Lots of independent pizza shops in the area pay better and have more generous customers. Many options to choose from.   Good luck, OP!"

I've always had a bit of anxiety about delivering in a large city with difficult parking, but sounds like you made it work. What parts of the outskirts would you suggest living in? Likely renting. On another note for a chain shop it sounds like you are doing pretty decently yourself."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dg28g,Powerfuldot,2,Thu Jul 16 03:49:04 2015 UTC,"I used to drive an old station wagon, that thing drove like a cow and was pretty tough to park. I made it work with my magnetic sign and turning the flashers on while parking too close to stop signs, in front of fire hydrants, 3 min loading zones, and ""No Parking This Space"" spaces.   Only ever got one ticket and that was from parking in a pay lot. The guy was still there and he said ""Oh, I didn't know you were just here for a few minutes for pizza. I wouldn't have given you a ticket. You should have a sign or something!"" <I try very hard not to roll my eyes in the direction of the 2 x 3 ft brightly colored plastic sign mounted on the roof of my car>  To avoid tickets, I never block disabled spaces, curb cutouts, other people's driveways, garage entrances, bike paths, or any lanes of a roadway.   Cities and towns both directly N and S of the city (like Burien, Renton, Shoreline, Everett) will be where the rent is cheaper. You have to plan for the traffic if you'll be commuting into work in the evening, though. Driving into the city SB is worse than NB in those times. There's a giant lake in between Seattle and the Bellevue, you do NOT want to live E of that lake, one bridge is a toll bridge and is a bit faster, the other is not it gets so jammed up. Costs you either way.   Our chain shop is one of the two busiest in our franchise for the area (Western WA) so that helps make up for being rather inexpensive and the lack of tips that can come with that. The are is also pretty wealthy. Any place you go, I'd suggest finding out the rough demographics and order level of stores before you pick which one to work at. You don't want to hang around the store washing dishes all day! :)"
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dg28g,nutbastard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"In a big city, there really isn't that much parking enforcement after dark... you can get away with a lot if you're only going to be there for a couple of minutes.  I park wherever the fuck fits the car. Even private driveways and such, but to be fair my boss doesn't really care about complaints so your mileage may vary."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dg28g,Powerfuldot,2,Thu Jul 16 12:19:44 2015 UTC,"I probably would park in people's driveways sometimes if I knew which house or apt building they were in. The vast majority of places I go have the address numbers hidden behind trees and bushes, painted the same color as the house, backlit, or just missing. My favorite is big fancy buildings that have the name of the building plastered all over the front and sides, but no number visible until you're at the front door and see it's painted in white on the glass 15 feet above you, a couple inches high, with a white background. I am always happy when a customer adds the building name in the delivery instructions.   I always wonder how firefighters manage to help anyone with these kinds of setups."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dg28g,Laurim,2,Fri Jul 17 03:00:37 2015 UTC,"I deliver in a suburb that's known as a pretty wealthy area. We're averagely busy (20ish deliveries in a 6-8 hour shift). Our area is fairly large (about a 8 mile x 8 mile square). Tbh, I seem to average the same tips from the brand new mansions in gated communities compared to the trailer parks/cheaper apartments I deliver too. Usually end up using about $10 in gas (really cheap here) and about 60-80 in tips (including .50 per delivery). Pretty relaxed work environment though and rarely have any complaints/angry customers.   Edit: City is about 150k people but there's another store that covers part of the city. No issues with parking ever and traffic is really rare. Also live in a very low cost of living area.

I used to work in pizza in San Jose, California and the sheer number of people on the phone that were angry or upset that I didn't speak Spanish was a huge drain.

As for ""speed"" do not break the law, getting to a house a few minutes earlier is not worth losing your job over.  Only carry what you need, and a max of £20 / $20. As for weapons, NO. I am unsure of the law where you are, but here in the UK carrying a weapon will get you arrested even if it is for self defence.  Day to day can vary depending on the number of deliveries and tips. I've made between £15 and £40 in a single shift.  Have fun and don't get down if you don't get tips and just learn to shrug off the bad customers."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dfn7o,ColaMonkey36,3,Wed Jul 15 22:42:11 2015 UTC,"Answering phones, helping carrout, working the ovens, folding boxes, doing dishes, cleaning, etc.  When going into apartment complexes, LOOK A TTHE MAP. #1 tip I can give you. So often I hear newbies (and sometimes even experienced drivers) bitch about how they just spend 10+ minutes driving around trying to find the right building. 95% of the time, there will be a map, right at the entrance. Spend 10 seconds looking at it, figuring out where you need to go.  Drive safe. You're on the road a LOT more, so you are at much greater risk.  Completely depends on the store and how busy you are. For me, I usually get anywhere from $120-150 in a closing shift just in tips and mileage pay.  Number 1 thing about this job, is to not forget shit. Triple check before you leave the store. Forgetting stuff is bad for everyone."

Make sure you have at least $2 loose change in addition to your bank.  3)  Put delivery receipts in your box after each delivery, so they'll be in order once you cash out at the end of the night.  4)  Pay attention to your surroundings, smile and try to find something to compliment the customer about on each delivery :)  5)  Wear comfortable shoes.."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dfn7o,slim_chance,2,Thu Jul 16 06:14:53 2015 UTC,"Good luck on your first day!   1) Make sure to ask that when you show up. It varies from chain to chain, and since you're working at a mom-n-pop, your responsibilities will be whatever they want you to do.  2) Don't go more than 5 mph over the speed limit, and ask other drivers if there are places cops like to sit frequently in the area. One speeding ticket can suck up a week's worth of tips.  Google Maps uses real time data to suggest routes that are the quickest, and adjusts its recommendations for accidents and breakdowns, so it's a handy service.   However, the sooner you learn the area without GPS, the sooner you can just get in your car and be on your way without typing in the address. Also, you can hit the microphone button and speak the address without typing it in. Make sure to give it Street vs Avenue vs Boulevard and the like: sometimes they're different. The city is a good idea too, but that's only got me one time.  3) Ask if there's any neighborhoods with restrictions. I deliver in one of the most dangerous cities in the US (top three, prolly), and we have a whole host of places we either don't deliver to, or don't deliver to after dark.  If something sketches you out, act on instinct. Pull up to a house and the porch and windows are all dark? Call em and ask them to turn the porch light or at least some inside lights on and come outside. If the place looks abandoned, nope the fuck out. Hopefully the delivery tickets give you their phone number. If anything seems amiss, give them a call.  Never go into someone's home. Unless they seem elderly and/or disabled, there's no reason for you to be in there. You can wait outside in the heat for an extra minute if they don't wanna let all the AC out while they find/collect/count the money (WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU CALLED AND THEY TOLD YOU THE TOTAL, FUCKWAD..... deep breath)   On the rare chance someone threatens you, just give em what they want. Don't take pepper spray or a pocket knife to a gun fight. When I get to the store, I put ALL of my money and wedding ring (my money gets rolled up into my wedding ring, so I know I brought it from home) and jewelry into my lil cashbox at the store that only I have the key to. Hand over the pizzas and your $20 you keep in your pocket (never more than $20, RIGHT? RIGHT?!), and in 99% of cases they'll leave you alone.  4) This varies greatly by your location. I'm in a pretty poor town, so everyone's rich and generous the first week or two of the month, and I can take down $60-80 in tips in an 8-hour shift. The last few days of the month when everyone's broke, I'm lucky to make $25 in 12 runs. It's a huge crapshoot.  5) Keep your vehicle in good shape. Your brakes, tires, and transmission are going to take a pounding.  The dudes working inside don't get to leave whenever you do, and don't usually get tips, so they often get stuck in the hot store making less than you, while you're chillin in your car. Try and help them out as much as possible.  Chat up the dude while you're handing over the pizzas. I kind of treat it like a stand-up routine: I put on a little one minute show. I can see what sorts of things work, tweak the routine, come up with and try new material all in one shift. The dudes your dealing with don't know you've used the same line like 15 times already that day, so you can gauge reactions. He's got two big dogs? I talk about how I can't wait for my wife's cats to run away so I can get a dog like he's got. Several cats hanging out in the yard? Talk to them on your way up the walk. People love their pets. HUGE source of materiel. Thank them for having their lights on with big house numbers, and comment about recent delivers that didn't go so well because you couldn't find their place. If you hear sports announcing on in the background, ask them what game their watching, and what the score is.  It's really easy stuff, just be a person bringing another person some foods. And thank them!  If you deliver to someone and no one answers, call em. If they're not home, tell them they have five minutes. After that, you're heading back to the store. AND THEN GO BACK TO THE STORE after five minutes. Once every two weeks it seems I'm standing in someone's driveway in a sketchy neighborhood waiting on someone. If they think I'm going to wait for them while orders are piling up at the store, they got another think coming.  Have fun dude! It's a pretty sweet gig, and remember: if shit starts getting stressful, remember it's just a pizza. No big deal."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3dfn7o,Laurim,2,Thu Jul 16 07:15:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on the store entirely. I work at a large chain and I pretty much just deliver, fold boxes, cash out carry-out orders, cut+box orders, and do dishes. If I close, I help clean the makeline/counters and sweep/mop. If I open, I help the manager prep food for the day. It's not required, but if we're busy I help the cooks/managers make pizzas. They REALLY appreciate it and constantly tell me how great the help is. As long as you make sure you have everything they ordered (drinks and sauces and sides included) you should be fine. Make sure you always grab credit card receipts for them to sign (mostly cause if you don't bring it, they likely won't tip.) and as others have said, keep like 20 pens in your car. Driving efficiently will kind of come to you as you learn the area better. There's certain streets I know I can take as shortcuts, certain lanes at certain intersections to avoid getting stuck behind a ""left turner"" etc. I live in a grid-city so there's usually multiple correct ways to get somewhere. If I'm at a red light and could either go left or straight, I'll go left since green arrows for left turns always come first in the cycle, etc. you'll learn as it's different each place though. I'm also not going to advocate breaking any laws but if your store has car toppers, use them. Cops are pretty cool here if you have one on. I drive very safely but I also drive pretty quickly. I once left a car-topper on for 4 months when I had a headlight out (including when I wasn't working) and didn't get pulled over once lol. I've always delivered in pretty nice areas but there are certain parts of the city we don't deliver to at night. A lot of other drivers I have worked with carry small knives. If it'll make you feel safer, do it. But if you are mugged or whatever, DONT TRY TO BE A HERO. (Never heard of this happening to anyone I've driven with though). If you ever have an order that seems sketchy, call them before leaving the store and make sure you don't carry more than the required amount of change ($20 seems standard). Entirely depends on the day / shift / holiday? / time of year / weather / etc. I'd say I average anywhere from $40-$80 in 15-20 deliveries in 4-8 hour shifts. It also depends on how your store pays mileage/per delivery. Actually saw this on reddit and it's been pretty awesome: i started texting people when I was on my way. I have a message that I just paste and change the ETA time. I've had a ton of people say that they really appreciate it and it helps me too so they're ready when I get there."

The only ones that didn't were the online orders. Tips were limited to something like 20% or 5$, whichever was greater.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,JoatMasterofNun,2,Mon Jul 13 08:46:00 2015 UTC,"The only ones that didn't were the online orders. Tips were limited to something like 20% or 5$, whichever was greater.   This was the case for the franchise I worked at. That changed almost immediately after I received a credit card tip in the amount of $10 on an order that has a sales total of $3.xx (it's been like 5 years). Basically what happened is that I told my manager he was going to give me my tip, I don't care how he had to make it happen. Since then only when there is an issue with the online order system do we need any type of approval, and then it's just a code... Employers do not have any legal authority to deny a tip, the only legal thing they can do is approve."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,monsterbate,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:54:59 2015 UTC,"Yea. It was really stupid and I brought up issues with the online system ALL the time. Hell, I brought up issues within the franchise all the time.  The part that sucked, is that I could pay said employee out, but then the franchise would get on me for 2 things:   Till being short (since I had no way to put in the system said tip) ""Unreported tips"" - basically not having, again, it in the system the proper amount of money paid out.   I fucking hated that franchise. Half of them had their heads up their asses and I got no respect from a lot of people, likely due to a combination of my age and no bullshit attitude.  It was funny because I brought a store in a shitty demographic up to a good profit line, using all my own ideas and solutions that I had previously tried to get put in place, while working with a GM who basically got the job as a family friend of someone higher up. After said GM was given a store in a nice area, I guess they figured I could have said shithole store in said slums because no one would ever want it or put up with it. I fucking busted my ass and paid out a lot of favors to long time employees willing to bust their asses too. I turn it all around and a year later I'm training a ""prospective GM""... who they turn around and give the store to and make me an AM again... I got so fucking sick of his bullshit. Couldn't schedule right, couldn't do food orders right, fucking played favorites with who he liked not who deserved it.  I told my 3 loyal as fuck drivers, with roughly 50 years between them (longest employee had been there since before the franchise owner was a franchise and was just mom&pop) to get ready to jump ship. Waited until that fuckstick was in clear violation of the company's (corporate) food policy (Past a certain day, zero exceptions) and dumped roughly $8k of expired product at the end of the night. This was in the summer time and it was funny as shit to see that dumpster the next day with several hundred pounds of overproofed dough pouring out into the parking lot.  That mother fucker of a GM was whining his ass off and I told him I was simply following company policy. He told me I was ""lucky I was even going to be on his schedule because I'd never hold a job as a worthless asshole of an employee"". I told him, ""No, see X, you have it all backwards. You're lucky I've stayed around, because many other people would fight to have me at their store.""  I called one GM and told him I was leaving the store and looking for spare hours, boom, 30 hours in the next 7 days. Called a second GM, explained to him the same thing and hours I was already unavailable, boom 3 OCs worth about 16-18 hours each. ""See X, and that was only 2 people. Explain to me how worthless I am again?""  Topkek was when I left, I expected the three vets to leave too - and they did. What I didn't expect was for 9 of the other 15 regular drivers to leave as well. That dude tanked, HARD. Hilariously I kept working within the franchise for several months until a regional manager who never liked my comments (He one time told me I needed to wear a hairnet... I was bald, but him with his obnoxiously large and greasy slick back would never wear one, yet be over the low boys and in prep areas) found out after said store was deep in the red for an entire quarter. He called me up to fire me... so I called the other regional manager, whom I've never met and only a few times covered stores under him... who promptly had me assigned to his region. I ended up parting ways with the franchise eventually anyways though.  TL;DR: Franchises suck. If you're going to work for a national chain, go for a corporate store not a franchised store."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,redditcoruum,7,Mon Jul 13 09:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't want to be a party pooper, but this is probably a scam.  Tip amounts that big usually cause the entire total to be rejected by the card company.  It's a shady way to get a free meal and to crush the hopes and dreams of your server / delivery driver.  Congrats to OP if the store paid you for it, but you may want to put that money up and not spend if for a week or two.  When the charge gets kicked back, the store might come to you looking for the money to be returned.    I used to run a restaurant, and there was a time right around 2009 when it seemed like someone tried to pull this once a week.  One time it got through, and the server got the tip on her next check (CC tips were paid on on normal payroll days), then got it debited back out on the following checks when the adjustment came through.  She was not happy, neither was I, but the home office could care less.  I want to say it was $800 she got.  Payroll took it out in two installments.  They were at least nice enough not to take her whole check the following pay period."

Doesn't matter... the tip has been paid out, the employer cannot force the employee to give it back. Forcing the employee to give it back would be a violation of the law.  Edit:   One time it got through, and the server got the tip on her next check (CC tips were paid on on normal payroll days), then got it debited back out on the following checks when the adjustment came through.   This is also a violation of the law, most likely. If that employee knew her rights she could have fought this and easily one. Once the tip is created, that money becomes the property of the tipped employee. Only under two very specific instances can that change, this is neither of those instances."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,dfpoetry,4,Mon Jul 13 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"Read your other reply, I understand where you are coming from.  If my memory is correct, a blanket waiver to allow an employer to make deductions from an employee's check also violates the law. Not 100% sure on that for federal, 99.99% positive that's the case in my state.  Regardless, no deduction can be made that would result in the employee's net wage being reduces below the applicable minimum wage. Tips do not count in this calculation since tips can only be used, by the employer, to satisfy the employer's legal obligation to pay minimum wage. Any tips in excess of minimum wage cannot be claimed, in any way shape or form, by the employer.   The only proper/legal method the employer can resolve this issue is to take the hit. The employee assumes no monetary risk since the employee is not able to make decisions on how the employer accepts payment.  Basically what you're telling me is the employers are violating the law left and right and as long as the employees do not know their legal rights the employers get away with it. I'm actually dealing with a similar issue at this moment for an employee within my franchise, or will deal with it if his manager does not deal with it appropriately. The Area Manager already knows I am involved and is not happy at all that I now about the issue. Anyways... hope I made some sense."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,redditcoruum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"Basically what you're telling me is the employers are violating the law left and right and as long as the employees do not know their legal rights the employers get away with it.   Essentially, yes.  It's crazy common for employers to abuse the lack of recourse that most employees have access to.  When I was still in school and bussing for Bennigan's, the manager made the waitresses pay for checks if a customer skipped out.  When I worked at McDOnald's as a shift manager, they made the employees pay back any register shortages over $5.  This sort of things is really common.  There's some legal gray area where employers are given the right to dock your wages if they hold you accountable for gross negligence that leads to loss or willful destruction of property.  There are some specific legal requirements for this, but it really comes down to how hard an employee wants to fight them.  Most of my experience is with employees making slightly more than minimum wage.  I never worked in  management for a company that paid bare minimum to tipped employees, so I'm sure you're correct about that.  But I also know how I have seen employers deal with people in the past.  It is entirely likely that they have no legal recourse to get the money from a ""pure tips"" employee, and as I stated, a corporate store isn't likely to bother, but I have seen a particular scenario play out too many times at too many places.    It usually involves some money coming up missing, an employee is blamed, they're called into the office, and the manager / owner essentially threatens to fire you or get the authorities involved.  The employee then ""willingly"" pays the business back, and it falls under a civil agreement rather than docking wages.    But again, I'm no employment lawyer.  I've just had time as an GM and seen a lot of corrupt (and awesome) bosses over the years.  Unfortunately, the shitty ones seem to be very common.  I just wanted to warn OP to be careful because my experience dictates that the customer was more likely to be running a scam rather than being a good samaritan.  If his boss decides he wants the $500 back, even if he has no legal recourse to get it, OP may be faced with the choice to either give it back or lose the job, and then be faced with all the mess that entails."

Whether OP, or anyone else, asserts their rights is up to them. I personally assert my legal rights and it's been fucking liberating. My employer basically leaves me the fuck alone, since I am a very productive employee, and doesn't play this stupid crap with me. And whenever my name is mentioned by another employee within the company, my employer becomes very conciliatory towards the employee that mentioned my name."

My primary concern was to warn about the potential for this to be a scam (it's pretty common), and to be prepared for fallout.  The legal stuff was a tangent that I got sucked into more than I intended.  I've been out of the restaurant game a while, and there are a lot of variations in employment law around the country.  I just didn't want this windfall to turn into a clusterfuck for a fellow wage slave.    The sad fact of at will employment and these sorts of jobs, is a lot of employers view you as imminently replaceable due to the lack of specialized skills, so even if OP knows his rights, it may not matter.  I've butted head with employers in the past over related situations, and a direct quote from one raging hellbeast of a manager was ""would you rather be right, or employed?"""

I don't need to prove it, all I would have to do is bring charges against my employer with the NLRB. It does not take a lot to prove retaliation.   I attempted to address a valid workplace issue. I was threatened with termination ""Would you rather be right or employed?"" That's a threat. I inform the employer's representative that retaliation is a violation of the law. I write this all down and send it via email to anyone, I now have a paper trail. I wait to see if they take any negative action against me. They take some negative action against... terminate me, cut my hours, start writing me up for bullshit stuff... that's retaliation. I file charges against them with the NLRB and let the federal government bend my employer over and spank the ever living shit out of them.    As long as I do my job without blatantly violating company policy, I am safe. And even violating company policy doesn't mean I cannot still show my employer has retaliated against me.  It's about knowing what you can and cannot do, within the law. Ultimately the employer will eventually get rid of the employee, if they are willing to pay the exorbitant price of doing so. Is it worth more than the $500 tip (in this instance) or the hundreds of thousands of dollars defending themselves?"

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,Semyonov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:28:04 2015 UTC,"No, that's not a solution. The employer takes all monetary risks in their business endeavor, the tipped employee takes none. The employer instituting a 2 week hold on the employee's property would likely violate the law.   I am not saying that that the employer cannot pay out the tips on pay day, as some do. Just that they cannot place a 'hold' on them so as to determine if fraud has occurred. Again, the employer takes all monetary risks for their business venture, one of those risks is accepting the risk that a charge back will occur. The employee assumes no risk since they, the employee, has no ability to decline the payment type."

If they want the money they can request it back (and if I were the employee I'd say no), or they can get it back from the bank (fraud department, more likely outcome), or they can bring the employee to small claims (wouldn't turn out in the company's favor)."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,Semyonov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:59:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say check all the stuff you signed when they hired you.  They can't debit your check without permission, nor can they take enough from you to drop your wages below minimum wage, but it's pretty common for employers to slip a few lines into the new hire packet that they have you sign that gives them implicit permission to make debits to your paycheck.  Usually you're told it's just a formality because they deduct fees for employee meals or uniforms, but they are worded to cover any form of deduction or wage correction.  If you are charged for your uniforms, odds are you've already signed an agreement like this.  That was the case in our location, and it's been the case at other places I worked for.  Such agreements may not be legal (debatable) but they are close enough to passing muster to make it expensive to fight, and that's all they really need to be to victimize an employee working a job like this.  I'm not defending that behavior on behalf of an employer, and I am not trying to shit on OP.  Just saying that going by the dickheads in food service that I have worked with / for in the past, that someone may come looking for that money.  At that time, you may not be able to stop them from just taking it (if they have a contract), or might be faced with being bullied into paying it back."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,redditcoruum,3,Mon Jul 13 01:22:39 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a federal law that employers also can't charge for uniforms   Nope.  They totally can.  I know for a fact it isn't federal law.  Can't say so for most states.  The law that most people confuse for that is that they can't make deductions from your check that takes you below the federal minimum wage  (though they can take you below the state minimum if it happens to be higher, and isn't spelled out there).    I spent ten years in the restaurant industry, from line cook to operations manager.  Some places are great, some places are shitholes.  A corporate store will probably just eat it, but franchises / mom & pop operations have been my worst experiences.  Money is usually tight at places like that, and they will just take it from you if they have half a chance.    I just read OPs story and instantly thought of the girl I had to deal with.  That was at one of the shittier places I worked, and I hated being put into the position of trotting out the 4 year old piece of paper and showing the crying girl where she gave the company permission to fuck her.    It's also really hard to fight something like this if they just decide to do it and then claim he gave verbal permission to the debit.  In most states they don't specify that debits need written permission .  Just ""permission"" (and then it's he said / she said), and even if they do, there are all kinds of other letter of the law things they can do.  I really did just want to give OP a friendly warning to sock that cash back for a bit and see if there is fallout.  Hopefully I am just being a cynical bastard, and the customer was above board, but experience has shown me that that basically never happens, at least not for this much cash.  This sort of bullshit is worse because a person like OP feels awesome because they got a bunch of money, goes and splurges a bit, and then ends up called into the manager's office 4 or 5 days later to explain what happened.  I've also had it happen where customers claim the tip total was altered and doubt is cast back at the employee.  It's shitty all around most of the time.  I hope humanity proves me wrong in this, and just urge a little conservative caution from OP with this windfall."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d1f4x,Semyonov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe it varies state to state   It does. Some states have a statutory law in place that is more beneficial to the employee. Some states have their own Department of labor and decipher various state laws as to mean whatever that DOL decides it is.   it was a federal law that employers also can't charge for uniforms   It depends on certain conditions. If the deduction causes the employee's net wages to fall below minimum wage, then it violates the FLSA. That deduction is taken over the pay period.   Let's say the employee is paid $10/hr, and the applicable minimum wage is $7.25/hr (federal minimum wage), and the uniforms items cost $40. During the pay period that the deduction is made (assuming the employee authorizes it) the employee works 40 hours per week (the pay period is two weeks long) that means that the employer can deduct a total of $2.75 per hour or a total of $220 in uniform costs. Again, assuming the employee is paid $10/hr.  Most delivery drivers are paid exactly minimum wage, this includes all those delivery drivers that are paid via a form of tip credit, so ANY deduction from their pay check would reduce their net wages below minimum wage and that would violate the FLSA."

I was there for the last one and apparently the OER was over and we had a 4 star (good enough). As the guy was leaving, he noticed a screen that was still on an order with no one there. The girl at the front said the lady had just called and placed a fairly complicated and long order. The lady wasn't sure if she was going to pay with a credit card of cash and said she'd call right back after she found out. We weren't busy and there really wasn't any need for the computer for anything else. Apparently the OER guy thought this was a huge deal, opened back up his evaluation form, and gave the store a 2 star. The GM was replaced a couple weeks ago.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d2aw8,elangomatt,5,Wed Jul 15 03:23:32 2015 UTC,I agree with what everyone said above. As an American I think our system of tipping is pretty stupid actually. I always tip fairly well including delivery drivers (pizza only where I live). Numerous times I've had delivery drivers thank me an inordinate number of times for giving them a tip since apparently there are a lot of cheapskates around here. I think a lot of people assume that the small delivery fee goes to the driver so they don't need to tip. It really is pretty stupid that delivery fees don't usually go to the driver either but that's the way it is usually.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d2aw8,SoraComputers,2,Mon Jul 13 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"Reasons to tip:   If you are consistent tipper, drivers will remember and be more motivated to get to your place in 5 minutes rather than 15. It makes us really happy.  Our cars take a beating. The drive-in to my stores parking lot is angled so steep I'm constantly scraping my bumper. On top of constantly starting and stopping the engine, it probably costs us above the average operation cost of a vehicle just to drive. I know on bad nights, I lose about half the money (in wage and tips) I make on gas and maintenance. With gas prices in California jumping a dollar overnight, this weekend was really bad for me.  Tipping less than 10% infuriates me. I'd rather you go 100% cheapskate than halfass it and give me 73 cents. I make sure to carry my change with me and slowly count it out when they try to tip low while I tell them if they can't afford to tip, don't worry about it. They call in and complain but we've got a manager that is on our side and is willing to lose a couple customers a month just because they're too lazy to come pick up a pie on their own. He used to be a driver and knows how much it can take out of us and our cars. A good base on any one bag order is $3, and most drivers are happy with that. $4 is good, and $5 we'll love you. 20% tips are rare but when they happen you just made a drivers night."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3d2aw8,Iemowi,2,Mon Jul 13 20:17:09 2015 UTC,I'm glad to hear that because I always tip at least 5 but was kinda worried that wasn't enough.

After I hand her the food, I opened the door and she backed away into it and ended up tripping on the dog, dropping her two orders of wings. Both looked bad, but one ended up all over the place.  She was extremely embarrassed, and I asked her if she wanted me to do whatever I could to help her.  She refused and said, ""no, that's not necessary. It was my fault.""  I ended up going back to the store and explaining to my manger what had happened, and told them I think it would benefit us if we gave her more or did something for her.  My manager eventually was extremely on board with the idea, and told me to put the cost of an order of wings on her account.

With that said, you can usually tell those who are just fuckheads not wanting to tip or spending your tip by ordering that dessert or second beer versus those who don't grasp the concept. I would say that until his mother spoke up, he didn't know."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3cv7eb,JonathanWarner,6,Sat Jul 11 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"I once delivered a roughly $20 order to a 20ish year old guy with downs. He handed me 15 and started to shut the door. Now, I had had a particularly shitty night that night, otherwise I probably wouldn't have said anything and just ate the difference, but this night it would have literally taken almost all of my abysmal profit for the evening, so I politely informed him that the total was $20 dollars and I would be needing the other $5 before I could complete the transaction. He smiled from ear to ear, reached into his wallet and handed me a ten, said keep the change and then informs me that ""he does it just to see if he can get away with it"".... I couldn't control it and began laughing  hysterically, all the while thinking "" I'd bet with this guy's sense of humor we could have a lot of fun just going out in public and fucking with people"". Hands down, best delivery ever!"

But I don't care if it's Chris Pratt or Donald Trump if he don't tip, he is instantly not my friend and it's hard not to make a stab at his shortcomings.   I blame the sociology for my insensitivity and impatience with children, elderly, and disabled. I am by no means perfect, I can be self centered at times."

You can't just blame the disability.  I mean they still decided on and placed the order and produced payment.

The first time the teenage girl who tipped me 6 bucks for something like a 12 dollar order shut her boyfriend down about how he's never worked retail and should stfu. That was pretty great.  The second time was a similar moment to your story and I got to reply, ""Yeah it's really a big help.

Also, it's not as helpful to employees because, at least at my area stores, each call sent to the call center, our store pays them some amount of money.  That adds up and affects the amount of hours we can schedule the next week because it's money the store lost.  We can make it up by missing less calls the next week/day/etc., but it's all because they want us to convince people to order online more."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3crfd5,WonTonBurritoMeals,10,Fri Jul 10 04:21:25 2015 UTC,"The average tip I get is anywhere from 8% to 12%. As far as the amount of runs per shift it's a crap shoot, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the amount of runs in a shift. Weather doesn't appear to be a factor, it also doesn't matter the day of the week. I've had shifts where nothing happened at all, and shifts where we were slammed for most of the night.  But this is all for my store, my SO's old store before she transfered to mine was by her college campus, and they were doing a LOT more business that my store could ever dream of seeing."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3crfd5,PLAZZZZZZZZ,9,Fri Jul 10 09:47:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on the store's location and radius. The store I drive for only has about a 1.5-2 mile radius and when we close I'm usually the only driver. I'll take anywhere between 4-12 deliveries. We don't have a minimum total to take a delivery so I've taken just two cookies and a medium drink haha. A good tip is like $5 on a 15-20$ order, but I've taken a 35$ order and received a 1.50$ pre auth tip. Those people definitely had more ice in their drinks than actual soda haha."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3crfd5,EdenBlade47,3,Fri Jul 10 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"That's why I hate pre-auth tipping and try to pay cash for deliveries. Driver is polite and has all the stuff I ordered? 10/10, getting 25-30% tip (if I order delivery it's going to be $10+, not 2 cookies and a drink haha) Driver shows up missing parts of my order or with the wrong order entirely, looking like they don't even give a shit?

Luckily there were quite a few larger orders (as well as more generous tippers) to balance the lower $1 and $2 tips out.   I should add that my store was located in a downtown area and the majority of my shifts were weekdays during lunch time into the late afternoon.

Had a pizza once for a guy like this who ordered a couple minutes after we closed. We already had everything put away and were maybe 5-10 minutes from leaving. This dude orders a pizza with about 15 toppings. Was like $30 for a single pizza, including extra jalapeños. My GM adds EXTRA EXTRA jalapeños. Including pouring the juice all over the pizza. Shit is sopping with jalapeño juice. My eyes were literally burning as I cut it. I end up delivering it and the guy is barely coherent. I'm nice and friendly and whatnot. I tell him the total and he's surprised how much it is. I explain our pricing and how it should have displayed online as he placed it. He tells me it's fucked up and I should tell corporate to make it cheaper (right...). So he leaves to try and find cash for me. As I'm standing there holding the box, I notice liquid running down my arm. I kinda hold the box up and the damn thing was soaked through the cardboard, had split open and the scalding jalapeño juice is running down my hand. I ignore the pain as he returns. He gives me the cash rounded up to the nearest dollar. He takes the pizza and tells me to hold on. He apparently doesn't notice the box nearly splitting in two or the steam rising up that was making me cry. He sets the box on the pure white carpet and leaves. Comes back with a few dollars to tip me. I thank him and leave before he notices the damage caused to his carpet."

Because he has a significantly lowered opinion of everyone in the store, he probably encouraged said behavior.  I asked him if the grudge-holding roommate of his was ""irascible in nature"", but he described him as a good-natured, friendly, cool dude. What a warped sense of social cues."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ch8f9,Fishy_Fish,3,Tue Jul 7 22:09:44 2015 UTC,"A drone would have to cost less than minimum wage per hour for it to be more effective than a person.  Flying ones are obviously a no-go because they require a skilled operator or a clear area, so the other option would be a rover and a ramp into the car. In snow, mud, or in an apartment complex, that's going to get stuck. It's probably still cheaper to hire a person to ride along unless there is some way to solve these irregularities that a person can deal with (i.e. drone / rover friendly delivery boxes with legally set standards, address restrictions).  I guess if you were really inclined to semi-automate the process, you could technically have a few skilled operators in ""parent"" vehicles remote-controlling ""child"" vehicles so that there's a minimum of downtime. A parent vehicle could be constantly dropping off and picking up child vehicles and maybe having a stock of common pizzas or pizza-making facilities, and if one of the child vehicles got stuck they could go back and help it out. The payment / dispensing of pizza could be automated by the child vehicles which would carry one order and have a bill / change / credit card acceptor, and the operator's job would only be to drive it from the parent vehicle and back.   This would mean that the parent vehicle need only drop off the child vehicles, drive them to the door, drive them back empty and pick them up once they're done. Child vehicles could wait indefinitely while waiting for control, cutting out the time drivers spend waiting at the door / accepting payment and maximizing deliveries per operator. However, a rover fleet as well as dedicated parent vehicles would cost a lot and maintenance would be a pain."

Obviously we're talking about a future where these things exist. There are several companies putting significant amounts of money into automated flying delivery drones - I wouldn't be entirely surprised if automated flying pizza delivery drones happened in the next decade.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ch8f9,Fishy_Fish,2,Wed Jul 8 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"I know there's a lot of potential in flying drones, but fundamentally speaking they're really crummy at dealing with things like obstacles, energy efficiency, mechanical failure or inclement weather. Even with advanced autopilot solutions with 3D scanners looking for obstacles, the above problems could easily send a 20-pound carbon-fiber-and-aluminum machine with propellers spinning at several thousand RPM into unsuspecting passerby (or at the very least, ruin a couple-thousand dollar machine in an instant).   One of the practical ways to solve this would be having designated drone landing areas at residencies, but when you get to that point it just seems easier to just have a (much easier controlled, more reliable and safer) rover drive up to the front door instead."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ch8f9,ZorbaTHut,2,Wed Jul 8 16:31:21 2015 UTC,"I mean, yeah, at the moment, but again, large companies with a shitload of money are working on this. I suspect they're aware of the problems that exist right now, and they seem to think it's still worth plowing cash into solving.  Give it time.

But self-driving cars are going to be marketed, and will succeed, at looking to reduce accidents and reduce fatalities/injuries, which will eventually get laws mandated to make them the only cars sold and/or on the road.  That said, we're still going to be delivering for a while past that, I'd say, because, honestly...the theft issue.  I think people would be more likely to try to steal a pizza from a robot (which we likely wouldn't allow to have self-defense mechanisms as that's how the robots take over) than a human.

""Come on, just give it to me, please?"" I tell her no, I'm not giving you 4 free pizzas. She keeps making eyes at me and then fucking starts to grab the pizza bag out of my hands.

She she gets all pissed off and throws a fit calling me and asshole and saying if I was cool I'd just give her the food, making a huge scene.

So he has the pizza and tells me that he thought his girlfriend had already paid with her card. I said no, we had no payment for this order. He shut the door in my face, still with the pizza.  My first thought was well... fuck. I knew I had messed up. I considered leaving right off the bat. It was just one pizza after all. Not worth waiting for $4.25 an hour.  But then I suddenly heard talking. Just the guys voice, no other voices. But he was talking as if there were multiple people in the room, and loud enough that it sounded intentional. Like he wanted me to hear him. I'm guessing he pretend asked for money from his ""buddies"" or something. Eventually he came back to the door to tell me that he didn't have a way to pay for the food.  I told him I needed the pizza back then. He said okay and went back inside. Door shut in my face again.  A few seconds later I heard him shout ""Oh nooo, aw man, bro... ah..."" and other very fake-sounding exclamations. Then he came back to the door and told me that all of his friends had already eaten most of the pizza. I got two and a half pieces back.  He was blacklisted and I didn't get in trouble or anything.

It was in a trailer park across the river, which meant the specific unit was going to be a bitch to find, because the trailer parks make no fucking sense in this town. I knock on the door, about thirty minutes after she'd ordered, and she opened the door. I told her the total.  ""Why was I waiting so long?""  ""Sorry?""  ""Why'd you bring this shit so late?""  ""It was half an hour, I brought it as soon as it came out of the oven.""  ""Well it's mine.""  Now, we'll give you free food if you actually have to wait a ridiculous amount of time, but half hour is not bad. The food was still hot. And I was not leaving without payment. I informed her of this.  She then grabbed the bag from me (not only the pizza but like the entire bag) and closed the door.   I banged on the door a couple times and then called my manager. He said that she would be placed on the banned customer list until she returned the bag and paid for the pizza.

Well, A) we'd ended that guarantee seventeen years before... and B) her old address was only half a mile from the store, and her new address three miles away in the same direction, with only one intervening stoplight. So the order was 19 minutes old when I arrived at the first address, and very predictably going to be 26 minutes old when I would arrive at the second. She sounded disappointed when I informed her of this, but proceeded with the order anyway.  On arrival, she told me that the manager (whom she referenced by name) had given her $5 off. I bought this story, because I've always had a somewhat non-confrontational style (encouraged by franchise policy); the manager's name was not especially unusual, but uncommon enough; and the kind of blatant asshattery that such a lie would embody was surprisingly rare in our area.  Not THAT rare, it turns out. She seemed fishy enough for me to make a manager callback as I left. Turns out our manager hadn't approved any discount.

You'd need to find some way to get large food companies to start paying a real wage if tipping is to be replaced, and that's not happening without a real push."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ccnf3,ceMmnow,3,Tue Jul 7 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of people, including delivery drivers, have a very limited understanding of the the terms they throw around. Most people usually have a very limited understanding of what a delivery fee is, why it was implemented, why it is increased, what it is used to pay for, and what the employer can do with it.  I'd say the same thing about tips, tipping, and the tipping social construct but I am aware that there will be many people that adamantly disagree with me; so I won't even touch on that.  Delivery fees are a way for the employer to do a number of things:   pass on the cost of the delivery product (and it's a product, not a service) on to those customers that request that product.  pass on a price increase to customers for costs that should be included in the menu price. (this cost, in the form of a delivery fee is being passed on to only the customers that request the delivery product, effectively making them pay for the carry out customer's portion of that price increase) Until recently, it was a way for restaurants to artificially create an added fee to a bill. I mean the ""automatic tip"" some restaurants charged for large groups. (This does not directly effect delivery drivers, but it does have some tangential connection with delivery fees, because the ""automatic tip"" and ""delivery fee"" are the same thing, according to federal law.) While no employer will ever admit this, and it would be insane if they did, delivery fees are a way for the employer to reduce the employees received/reported tips; because delivery fees are believed, by a significant portion of the population, as being a tip or just another excuse for the customer not to tip for the service the tipped employee is providing. Employers pay payroll taxes on reported tips. Employers, in any industry that utilizes tipped employees, are best served by keeping reported tips to the absolute minimum. That minimum being the difference between what they pay the employee in direct wages (tip credit) and the applicable minimum wage. Any reported tips above the difference cause the employer to pay additional payroll taxes, which reduce the employers profits.    What do you guys say?   I say the issue is much more complicated then you believe it is and your solution is problematic."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ccnf3,Siddabear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:16:03 2015 UTC,"Been thinking about delivery fees a bit lately, from an owners perspective, and I think they come out a tad bit low. The owner, on average, makes less money on a delivery than on a carry-out.  The driver still has to be paid whilst he is delivering the order, in my area it is $5.05/hr plus patroll taxes, making it about $5.50/hr. However, the BO doesn't get any additional productivity out of that employee as opposed to him NOT being there and you just coming to pick the order up. From a business perspective, delivery is pure cost.  Hence the fee. My store charges 3$ a delivery. The average driver makes 2.5 deliveries/hr, bring the store 7.50$ in fees. of that $7.50, $5.50 goes directly into the drivers regular W-2 wages, and another $3 gets paid out to the driver as mileage reimbursement (fee or no fee, this is the case).  So at the end of the day, for every hour that the driver spending delivering, the business LOSES a dollar as opposed to not having a delivery service offered, assuming everyone who orders delivery would come to pick the order up instead.  Basically, delivered pizza has a lower margin of profit than picked up pizza, even with a $3 fee and reduced minimum wage for employees."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c9uaf,RedditIsFullOfJerks,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"It all depends on if you know how to handle whatever you decide to use. Pepper spray mists very easily, even standing with out backs to the wind to get a feel for pepper spray my friends and I ended up with irritated burning eyes. I have heard stories of panicked victims tazering themselves by accident during an assault. I personally keep a pocket knife on me at all times but more for a tool. But I have practiced a lot opening and closing and drawing it from my pocket. I hope I never have to use it for its unintended purpose, and if I do I hope the intimidation would be enough to scare anyone off."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c9uaf,jamie30jamer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"That's very true. I also carry a pocket knife, but i use it for opening boxes at work. I've never had to wield it in self-defense. Pepper spray seems like the best option because you can greatly irritate their sense of sight, smell and direction all at once without it possibly being lethal to your self. If you drop a knife, they can easily use it to end your life or gravely injure you. A tazer can be lethal, but in minor circumstances, and can also be used to incapacitate the attempted assailant. It's more personal preferance, but i'd rathe end up with a bit of back spray in my eyes than a stab wound."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c9uaf,rdeluca,2,Tue Jul 14 15:16:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's also very true actually, I'd definitely rather have stingy eyes than a stab wound. At least then the assailant would for sure be incapacitated.   I'm  not sure why I didn't think of that before, usually I'm a lot better at planning than this. Might be getting some pepper spray before my next shift.."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c9uaf,rdeluca,2,Tue Jul 14 15:32:24 2015 UTC,No problem. That's why we have these sort of discussions on here. Allow for collective use of everyone's thought processes.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c9uaf,culesamericano,4,Tue Jul 14 16:16:18 2015 UTC,"Ugh, man that sucks.  I know a bunch of guys in here have concealed carry (and don't tell their job) and some carry (large) maglights, but I'll sticky this and let them answer :)  But let me point out - this particular situation is a job for the police, not a gun, and not any other weapon. You get out of the car with a weapon and it's likely you'd get charged by the police too.   You don't use a gun in non-lethal self-defense, you don't take a weapon out of your car against a group of people, because it's more likely they'll take it from you and beat the living fuck out of you for trying to do so to them."

For clarity, my first spot was pre-youtube, pre-smartphone, pre-sub$400 GPS.  We used to just stare at a map and maybe jot down directions... on triples... Also I didn't have a cell phone.. because that wasn't a thing... So when I left the shop I was just sort of gone, with no recourse.  There were times when I had to drive to a payphone.

The only real problem is that they didn't sign for it, but if they're actually smart enough to bitch about it to the CC company, we'll call that company, tell them that these people are using a fradulent card, and then give their address to a detective and let them deal with the po-po.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c21na,Mashero,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:07:48 2015 UTC,No fuck that it does not work for driving. I have had my fair share of slow drivers working with me and it is zero fun to tell people over an hour for pizza that should easily be able to get to them in 30-45 minutes.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c21na,xboxhobo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:37 2015 UTC,If it's that slow then no it does not work at all but then again anyone going the speed limit or slightly faster should not take that long. It does not matter the size of the delivery area. Either way that's also how you decide if you hire people or not also if you fire them or not. They have to show they are an asset.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3c21na,Mashero,4,Tue Jul 14 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"When I drove, we had a number of insiders. If you were on the make table and you took forever, I hated you. Hungry customers are waiting on their orders from the time they place them, and I could only drive so fast efficiently. If the pizza took longer to get delivered and it wasn't my fault, it was still potential tips out of my pocket. Even if you're just on the phones, your slowness would sour the customer's experience.  So no, don't try to become an insider. You won't last and you will make enemies.  As far as becoming a driver, you know how when you order a pizza they tell you something like ""it'll be about 45 minutes?"" I always tried to be there before that quoted time. If you really take 1.5 times longer to make a delivery, the customer would be waiting over an hour. You will make no money from tips, receive a lot of complaints, and piss of the other drivers who have to pick up your slack.  So no, don't try to become a driver.

If you're really operating at 1.5x of a professional, let alone just a regular joe, dude seriously just go work in a movie theater.  Pizza is brutal. Your post tells me outright that it's not for you, in store or out.  I'm sure you have plenty of other slower paced options and resources that can hook you up.  I've made 30k pizzas. Thirty thousand.

Thereby stopping the asshat from having a chance to be an asshat.  Then you should have informed him of the price change and told him you honored the sticker price but are currently working on changing over the prices, so next time it won't be a surprise the price went up.

The person who entered the order into our system didn't see that (neither did I) so she didn't put ranch on the official order form. When I packed a driver bag, I didn't put ranches in it.  I get to their door, I hand the pizza over, and the guy asks where the ranches are. I told him that it wasn't on the official slip, and he showed me the note he left on the side of the initial slip faxed to the shop.  He got all pissy saying how badly he needed them, and demanded that I go get him some from the shop or he wasn't sure going to tip me. They're free, so whatever, kind of put a cramp on my other deliveries though.  I get to the shop after my other delivery on that run, tell my supervisor about it, and she just cringes at. She told me to hurry up because another delivery came in.  I rush back to the customer, and hand him the ranches and hightaled back to the shop.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3brt88,sylfire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:43:10 2015 UTC,So what was the point of your original comment?  Based on this new comment it wasn't agreeing or disagreeing with OP... just commenting about how much people like dishes.  That's cool.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3brt88,11equals7,0,Wed Jul 1 20:04:00 2015 UTC,"I only own a couple of them for when civilized people show up. Otherwise we just eat from cheap paper, foam or plastic plates, cups, and utensils. It ends up being just a couple more bucks than washing stuff."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3brt88,sylfire,5,Wed Jul 1 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"That's... wasteful beyond comprehension. Is washing dishes so reprehensible to you that you can justify spending that kind of money for the ""convenience"" of disposable cutlery and tableware constantly? Hopefully this is just a temporary situation, because honestly...  I mean it's like maybe $70 for some glasses, some plates, and some bowls. And those will last at least 10 years, if not more. Meanwhile, just looking at paper plates, assuming 3 per day per person, which I assume is 2 people, is around $37 per year. And that's JUST the plates. Plastic cutlery (assuming knife/fork/spoon on each meal) would run about $18 a year, whereas a general set is $25, which can last for another 10 years, easily.   So you're looking at a one-time payment of around $100, maybe $125 if you go for more stuff, as opposed to about $50 a year. I don't necessarily know your eating habits and what not, but I can say with very high certainty that having decent utensils and flatware is much easier on your wallet than the disposable alternative. Not to mention the money you'll save on trash bags.   I know you didn't ask for a huge thing about tableware, but I just hate seeing people waste money on disposable versions of something they'll use for the rest of their foreseeable future.   P.S. Yes, I do wash almost all of my dishes by hand, for a family of four. As long as you don't let it pile up, maybe invest in a dish rack to let them dry as opposed to a dishwasher, you'll hardly notice the little bit of effort. Especially if you end up cleaning the dishes after every meal, you won't ever have to spend more than 5 minutes cleaning, except maybe with company over."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3brt88,11equals7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"Then factor in the cost of dishwash soap, sponges, tea towels etc."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3brt88,sylfire,2,Wed Jul 1 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"But dishsoap isn't even expensive by comparison. Not to mention that most dishsoap doubles as hand soap. As for the towels, again, those are fairly cheap and last for a long time. We've had the same dish-drying towels for at least twenty years, still going strong. The smaller dish rags tend to have a shorter lifespan, yeah, but five years is still not terrible. And once they've outlived their lifespan, you could easily donate them to animal shelters to use as bath towels for the dogs, or use them for your own pets.  So you're looking at maybe $30 a year on dish/hand soap. Maybe additional upfront of $30 on dishtowels (they said they already had some dishes, so I assume they're already washing/drying them somehow, so maybe cut that down to $15 for one set of dedicated dish towels), and you're still coming out ahead in the long run.  Dishes and stuff are an investment, in a sense. You spend a little upfront to spend next to nothing over time. It's the same argument against those places that are rent-to-own. A $2000 TV can end up costing over $3500 with their payment plans of small amounts stretched out over a long time. With plasticware, you spend little over time, but after many years it ends up being a lot more expensive than just buying decent silverware/tableware up front."

And I would never want to give up eating with real silverware and plates - hell, I even take it camping.   But they are giving up that comfort for the luxury of never having to wash anything, at a cost difference that only starts paying off after 3-4 years.   I never considered that really, but since I move around a lot, it might be a good idea if I live somewhere for just a few months."

There many reasons you shouldn't do, for example, you have no idea of the customers financial situation, maybe they need that change more than you do. Maybe it's not their money, and not their choice to tip you. Maybe they have poor social skills, and are unable to apologise for the reason as to why they can't tip you. It is also very unprofessional. You don't know who the customer is or what they're like, they may call the store saying they were abused by the driver, and you then might lose your job. Is that worth a bit of change?  But I think the main reason you shouldn't ask for a tip is because it's just so incredibly rude. It is entirely up to them, whether they want to tip you or not, and if you don't get one, then smile, say goodbye, and cross your fingers for the next delivery.

I'm pretty sure that someone struggling to afford food isnt going to spend their money to get pizza delivered. If you can't afford to tip than you shouldn't be ordering at all, regardless of what excuses you may have. It's not ""social anxiety"" or ""lack of money"", it's lack of common sense and decency.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3bpwhm,DoctorWaluigiTime,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:25:39 2015 UTC,"Include it in the menu price and I'll agree with you. Otherwise, the price of the food is the price of the food.   You mean have a totally different menu priced solely for delivery? I don't really see how that would improve much of anything, especially considering that the price of delivery is effected by how far away the location is. I think it makes much more sense to just add the delivery charge after the fact and notify the customer of the new total.  I get what your trying to say with ""The price of the food is the price of the food"" but that's just my point, you're not just paying for the food. You're paying for the food and a delivery service. The delivery charge my restaurant charges on top of food cost is not enough to cover my cost in gas and time, and therefor I rely heavily on tips to come out at all on top at the end of the night. If no one tips the entire night, I most likely lost money that night.  When you order delivery, you are agreeing to pay for the food as well as paying the driver for their service. I deliver to a lot of people that don't really understand that delivery is basically two payments: the food, and the driver. Lots of people just expect the restaurant to cover the entire cost (they dont) or just hope ""the next guy will tip him to make up for it"" (often, they dont). And sometimes I think people just mistake delivery as a free service the restaurant offers.  If a delivery boy is just plain rude, than I agree that maybe they aren't deserving of a tip. But it's very disappointing when I go to three houses in a row, all with a smile on my face, ask the customer how they're doing, tell them to enjoy the food and have a nice night just to have them stiff me with zero tip. I'm not your slave.   (And yes, I do tip. I just don't also pretend that a tip is by any means a mandatory thing or part of the price.)   Good, I'm glad to hear it. But I still think you should consider tip part of the price. Sure he's not bringing it to you instantly, or on a silver platter, but the driver is doing their job, and assuming he isn't rude or incredibly late, they deserve to be paid for it.  Restaurants set their delivery prices assuming that the customer will pay an additional part of the cost and therefor don't set prices that typically cover the entire cost. They assume you are going to pay part of it, so you should. Just like a waitress doesn't get paid minimum wage, they get paid like 4 or 5 dollars because it's common courtesy that the customer cover the rest. If you dont, that employee doesn't get the wage they deserve.  TL;DR: The restaurant considers tip part of the price, so you should too."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3bpwhm,bluepotleaves,0,Wed Jul 1 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"If they considered it a part of the price, it would be in the price. I know it's not because of the (bad) tipping culture in the states, because of silly wage laws and Appeals to Tradition, but if a restaurant wants its wages to be paid by us, then they'd be in the price."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3bpwhm,DoctorWaluigiTime,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"I work for a small mom and pop shop as apposed to a large chain, and when discussing prices with my boss, they basically said that they estimate what the drive would actually cost and what the driver deserves per delivery and then they take a dollar or so off to account for tip. They assume most people will tip and that's why they don't just tell you the price you need to pay. If they did, the nice people would still tip and end up paying an enormous amount, so they take a few bucks out to account for tip. Maybe that's different than what most places do, but in the case of where I work, that is literally how it works. The restaurant expects the customer to pay a little more than what they tell them.   There's no perfect system for deciding what to charge for delivery, because some people will always tip regardless of the price while some just assume they only have to pay the exact total and don't tip. Because of this, the delivery boy is often the one who has to suffer when someone doesn't tip. The restaurant is always going to get what they charge no matter what and whatever is left over is for the driver. The least you can do is tip and save him from having a shitty night, because it's pretty much a guarantee that someone else that night stiffed them.   I know you already said you tip, so I'm not directly trying to convince you, just clarifying that for me and where I work, I rely very heavily on tips to make my money. If everyone tips at least a dollar or two, I come out fine. But I've had nights where not a single person tips, and after re-filling my gas tank I come out in the negative, which really fucking sucks.   So regardless of what you believe or how you think the system works, just always tip, because I can tell you from experience that the driver is counting on it.  If you do tip, thank you, we drivers honestly appreciate it. If you don't, fuck you. I dont like having to pay with my own money to deliver your food, which is inevitably what happens when you dont tip."

If you order with the intent of not tipping, that is where I see the issue. Just do it even if it's as simple as giving the guy a 20 for an 18.50 order and letting them keep the change. I've been hanging out with friends who decide to order delivery and when I asked if he had enough to cover tip he said ""what? Fuck no I just want food I don't wanna give a guy extra money"". I gave my friend shit and ended up having to cover the tip myself even tho i wasnt getting food becaude my friend wanted to be a lazy asshole. that is where I see the issue: it's the social norm, people know it's the right thing to do, yet decide not to because ""the driver doesn't deserve to be paid for doing their job, I just want my food"""

You can feel like a tip is part of the price all day, but it isn't.   This is wrong. Think of it this way: The delivery fee is enough to cover the cost of the trip, and that is all. It's enough to cover the cost of gas to get to the location and back, but it doesn't pay the driver at all. If I make 10 deliveries in a night and each has a 2.50 fee, thats $25 dollars in my pocket, right? Wrong. That's $25 dollars in my gas tank, and zero dollars in my pocket. The delivery fee covers only that: gas. Not the wage of the driver.   The delivery fee is for compensation, tip is for the drivers pay. At the end of the night, the delivery fee just means the restaurant (and customer) covered your gas. If no one tipped, you still earned no money for doing your job.

Just because something isn't direct included in the cost of the service doesn't mean it shouldn't factor into your payment for that service.  And I'm not trying to preach, I'm just explaining from my experience as a delivery driver how important it is and how much it affects us when someone doesn't tip, because I think a lot of people (not you, I know you said that you tip) don't actually know how payment and all that works for delivery drivers and don't know how much it affects us when they choose not to tip.  And on a side note, if you knew the delivery charge doesn't go to me, yet also claim that tip isn't part of the service, does that mean I'm just supposed to work for free for all the assholes that don't tip?"

When I was a delivery driver, I made minimum wage or higher and didn't have to tip out. I always felt like it was a great bonus when I received a tip.   For all the drivers who think that you're entitled to a tip: are you having to to tip out? Are you making below minimum wage? If so, I completely understand. If not, I am at a loss of the entitlement mindset.   Some drivers I worked with felt entitled while making a decent wage and also not having to tip out. I asked them why they felt entitled and they didn't really have a good answer. Some said low wage, and I would say ""Do you tip everyone you encounter in your life making a low wage for DOING THERE MINIMUM JOB REQUIREMENTS?"" Example: Cashiers and shelf stockers at grocery stores, cleaning staff and janitors, fast food workers, etc...and all of them said no.   If you're making above minimum wage, not having to tip out and are not tipping everyone in society who makes a low wage, then why should you be entitled? Why should customers subsidise your wage so your corporation can make more profit?"

OP didn't specify what country he lived in though, so I wasn't certain.   Is this a federal law or does it vary state by state? It seems like such a crock of shit that such a large percentage of your wage is based on the possibility of getting tipped.   Are cooks in restaurants paid less than minimum wage? Where I live in Canada most cooks and chefs get a ""tip out"" from the waiters and waitresses each night. The American system of tiered minimum wages blow my mind."

Don't ever say a word about the tip, or even imply you want a tip. Tips are for exceptional service. Even if 99% of your service is tip worthy to most customers, that doesn't mean you have the right to mention tipping to anyone. Even if you got the delivery to their door in 5 minutes, they have the right to not tip you.  It is a fucked up system, but remember, money and tipping is personal to a lot of people."

Then one day I slammed my finger in the car door and they sent someone who'd never closed to replace me. The manager was even told that she had to stay to close and she left anyways.   Well she got demoted to regular worker and I got a new manager and it was then that I realized just how much my pacifistic nature was screwing myself over.

This is what happened:  Reimbursement was per mile, and as gas prices fluctuated, so would the reimbursement. When I started driving, gas was $3.50 per gallon, and I got $0.33 per mile back. Which was just barely covering it to make it worth it.  Gas prices dropped down $1.80 in the winter, and reimbursement constantly updated as it fell, down to $0.23/mile.  Well.... then gas rose back up. And kept rising. But the gas compensation didnt budge.  The franchise owner is the responsible one for updating compensation. Gas almost got back up to $3.50, but compensation was still $0.23/mile!  I view the gas comp as more than than gas. Tires, oil changes, new thermostat and water pump, etc. I had to change my oil every month, and I use synthetic.

They are just doing their job with getting the food to you. When they see a delivery that is a remake, or going to an area that doesn't tip, giving them a couple of dollars really helps them out.  Most of the time, the driver gets a tip based on the interaction between the customer and the store. The driver wasn't involved in that initial interaction. The driver usually has to suffer for the bad service that other people have the customer, even though they didn't play a part in it. If the employees or manager, back at the store, are stupid or rude, then the driver is the one who gets punished by the customer. The driver has zero say in how things operate back at the store.

I went to hand her the change back and she insisted that I keep it and even pointed out that it was my tip. I said no thank you and she took it. She called the store to tell the manager that her driver did not seem to be very appreciative of the tip she had offered.  I don't make it a point to educate bad tippers on what a decent tip is. I am however happy to pretend that I didn't realize that the change that couldn't get me a ring from one of those vending machines at walmart, was supposed to be a tip. If they obviously didn't intend to tip an amount that a normal person could confuse as reasonable (~$1), then I don't want it and generally the message sent by giving back the change is worth the expense of those pennies.   I know my methods seem to be bad customer service, tips are supposed to be optional and all that. But I don't do this job, or any job for the good feels. I do it to put food on the table for my family, a roof over our heads and flexible hours while going to school. If someone doesn't tip, then I actually make less money because of that delivery than if I had just stayed in the store. I do not take kindly to customers who cost me money. If they get offended and don't order from us anymore, then I don't have to worry about delivering to their no tipping ass anymore and can take food to those people who say they appreciate my service and actually tip me in return for it.   I would much prefer that I was paid a decent wage all the time. Then tipping would be what it is supposed to be, a gratuity, something extra for appreciation. Then I wouldn't have to rely on them for 60% of my take home money and could just be happy when someone offers anything."

I have returned money to people who overtipped before if I thought they were drunk and didn't know what they were doing.  Honestly, tipping around 20% consistently will make you well loved by those who deliver to you. It will ensure people are happy to deliver to you and waste no time getting there, and it will mean they are getting paid well for the trip.   I get paid $4.00 per delivery, plus $1.25 fuel surcharge, so $5.25 per delivery. If its extra long distance, the fuel surcharge can go up (to a max of $10 but thats for a place 16 miles away). So on a typical delivery if you tip me $5, I made $10.25. If I do 2 deliveries in an hour (about average on a regular day), then I am making $20.50 and hour and I have a fuel efficient car so the fuel cost is pretty cheap in most cases). $20/hr is fine by me for an easy job like this. Not that I don't mind larger tips of course but within reason, as I don't want to feel like I am ripping a customer off. On a really busy day I can do 3-4 deliveries in an hour, although that's rare, and they would need to be very short deliveries.  Oh, note that I don't get an hourly wage."

Of course there are some nice wealthy people who are considerate etc. However, for the most part when doing deliveries, the more expensive the place the less the tip, or perhaps even no tip at all. Perhaps only asshole rich people order pizza, I dunno. The best tips - speaking entirely subjectively - seem to come from people in the trades/industry and people (around here that usually means people who work in Alberta on the Oil Sands) who also work service jobs but get good tips - waitresses in bars for instance. The trades people make great money and are here on a holiday so they splurge a bit, and the people who make their living off of tips know the importance of a tip.  The exception to the later seems to be cabbies, who make a lot of their money off of tips, but seldom tip."

Unless you're willing to drape wire around your room, you're going to have to place your tv/modem in a (roughly) 12' (3.6m) section of your wall. The issue with me deciding is, exactly, that it isn't my house. Believe it or not, people have said this and then called in complaining about where their outlets were installed. This looks bad on the tech who performed the install, as it counts as a repeat (trouble call). These trouble calls are then calculated against the total number of installs over the last 7 and 30 days for different metrics. Our target repeat % is 3% for 7 day and 7% for 30 day. Being above 3% is generally looked over if your 30 day rolling score stays at or below 7%. Figuring about 5 installs per day, that's 35 and 150 installs respectively. If you have one a week, you're good. More than that and it becomes an issue, so you do everything you can to save yourself on repeats. The complaints about outlet location because the customer told you to put it wherever was easiest for you and they didn't like it are 100% avoidable.

Realistic answer: People will say anything to try and get one over on the cable company. They don't know about metrics or any of the other things on which tabs are kept. If they call in and say they told you to put it in one place and you put it in another, it's always going to be customer's word over the tech's in the company's eyes. Sure, you can explain to your manager exactly what happened. If you're lucky, the email he sends back to the higher ups regarding the issue will be acceptable and you won't hear about it again. It will still count against your numbers, though.  I could go on and on about how shitty the system is, so feel free to ask questions.   TL;DR: Be nice to your cable guy. He's a human, too."

As an example, the Minnesota River does some pretty crazy stuff to our area assignments.  We're only two blocks south of the nearest northbound crossing, but our delivery area nevertheless stops at the river. Other stores cover most of the way to the northern bank of the river, except for a sparsely populated dead zone a couple square miles in size. The screwy part is that the dead zone, just over the crossing from us,  is only 6 miles from each of the other nearest stores... while our area goes eight miles lengthwise down the south side of the river.  Then again, we take the occasional call from that dead zone, because why not? Unless there's some really exotic issue like a drawbridge or frequently blocked rail crossing (i.e. unpredictable chance of stranding a returning driver), it's hard to see what that store is thinking."

Then you can use the neighbor address, no getting in and out for the driver, and the customer loopholes his way into a fast delivered sandwich. Wins all around.

I give him my info and finally got to my address, and he told me right away that I was calling the wrong store. That would be fine on its own, even though he wrong, except for the fact that he was pissed. He told me what store I should have called and I told him every delivery I had ever gotten was from his store. He told me anything north of X street is the other store, and I told him I'm south of X street, just north of Y street. He double checked and realized his mistake, but still seemed pissed for some reason.  I get that they must have been pretty busy and I get that they can get a lot of unnecessary calls, but what bothered me was he just automatically assumed I was another dumbass customer who didn't bother to check delivery zones.  Don't even know why I shared this. Thought it was mildly relevant."

We don't do the long distance ones very often mind you because it ties up a driver for a longer period of time and we often don't have enough drivers when its busy.

In case something happens or the driver gets lost we need to be able to contact you.""   Then he said ""It's a private number and I'm not giving it to you.""   I tried explaining that the computer wouldn't process the ticket with out a number and he screamed in the phone  ""I DON'T HAVE A PHONE!!!!""   So I asked him ""If you don't have a phone, sir, how are we talking to each other right now?"" Then he demanded to speak to my manager.  ""Sorry sir, but you are speaking with the manager on duty."" lol   He ended up giving me his neighbors number but pissed and moaned about it as much as humanly possible.

I have seen this a few times, where the customer asks for free menu items in the delivery remarks. If these items they are asking for, for free, are anything greater than packets of CRP, Parm, or Seasoning I completely disregard the comments. If the items are for CRP, Parm, Seasoning I will take a few with me in my pocket.   Usually I will hold back any ""free"" items until I see if the customer has earned them, via the amount they've tipped me. If the amount is less than $2 my response is usually ""I'm sorry, I just gave the last ones to my last delivery."" If the tip is between $2 and $3 my response may be ""Let me see, here, I have two CRP and Parm."" If the tip is greater than $3 then I will usually be able to find more in my pockets.

The less centralized stores cut into other areas to make up for the fact that they have a smaller population. So those stores have larger areas and sometimes other stores are closer but it is better to more evenly distribute the business between stores than have 1 store with few customers and other stores with a lot more.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3bdjy0,Catsowntheinternet,6,Sun Jun 28 05:07:32 2015 UTC,"I always tip my pizza delivery guy. I don't order often but people at my work do. Apparently they never tip him cause they pay with their credit card before hand and assume the tip is included. This past weekend they ordered a bunch of stuff cause we were having an event, and this poor guy was struggling trying to balance it all. It was really hot out and he looked really tired. The check turned out to be around $50. I assumed my friend would tip him cause it was such a big order but there was an awkward pause and then the guy turned to leave. I ran to my purse and pulled out two twenties and rushed to his car outside. Luckily I caught him just in time and thanked him and apologized and told him that he was always very nice whenever he delivered. I slipped him the money and his face lit up but was confused and told me my friends paid by credit card already and we didn't owe any more. I just said this was for being so awesome and he laughed and thanked me. Later I called the pizza place and raved about how nice he is and a hard worker. Our food was always on time and piping hot and he never gave my stupid friends attitude for not tipping. I still feel bad but I hope he felt better."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3bdjy0,molldee,11,Mon Jun 29 07:00:17 2015 UTC,"I think the whole tipping culture in the US is bullshit. Delivery drivers and waiters should be paid a set amount, above minimum wage, the only reason there's such a strong tipping culture is so owners won't have to pay their employees minimum wage. It's BS. That being said if I was ever in the US I wouldn't fucking not give someone a tip, because I know with the current system that's their only real means of income, not tipping just means you're screwing the kid delivering you your pizza, which means you're an asshole."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3bdjy0,QuintusVS,2,Sun Jun 28 12:00:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the area you deliver I'm sure. In my experience regulars that don't tip will continue not to.  Same applies for good tippers,  the ones that tip well always do.   I have read that asking a customer to ""fill out""  a credit receipt rather than ""sign""  brings in more tips. You'll have good night's and bad nights like most jobs where tips are a big part of your income."

A server is waiting on you, with multiple interactions. I generally tip 18-20% for an average server.

It is completely irresponsible for them to tell you to drive 20+ MPH over the speed limit. They are correct about the cops not pulling you over for speeding a bit, but they WILL give you a ticket for running a red light.

My town is small and the police here do give leeway to delivery drivers as long as you're not going 15+ over, running red lights, or being a general ass.   I also know of towns where the cops do not care if you're on the clock or not. They will pull you over. The police here may be a bit more relaxed, but they enforce the seat belt law constantly. So if you're not wearing your seat belt, be prepared for a ticket.   I regularly go about 5 over the speed limit. But I never text while driving and am always focused.

There is a fair amount of pressure from management to keep our variance times low, but the system that tracks it makes no allowances for things like 300+ unit addresses(aparements, hotels, and trailer parks) spread over 40 acres of land, and these places make up around 30-40% of our deliveries. They've labeled anything over 7 minutes variance as 'Needs improvement', but the fastest driver in the store (me) has a hard time keeping a variance of less than 5 minutes for any period of time.  Actual wages are the same as anywhere else for the drivers."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3b9aoi,S_Jeru,2,Sat Jun 27 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"I have worked for Pizza Hut, Pizza Inn, a couple mom and pops, and Domino's. The mom and pops were both great and awful at the same time. Much more flexibility in scheduling, and the team was smaller and more intimate. However, they are also sometimes run by people who have no fucking clue what they're doing, and I've run into ""Oh we didn't make enough to cover payroll, so here's half of your check, and we'll give you the rest when we can.."", and ""Oh, we don't have enough business to have you work your hours that we scheduled, so don't come in."", and ""We are closing for the entirety of summer because we want to go on vacation."" Pizza Hut was a joke, most of the drivers were ex cons/drug addicts, and so were the managers. I actually prefer working for Domino's. They are advertised as focusing on delivery, and, at least at the two different Domino's franchisee's I worked with/work for currently, they really make sure the drivers are treated decently. Yes, we have to remake food for morons that are  clearly lying, but at Pizza Hut I never even got mileage for taking those free orders. Pizza hut only paid .20 a mile, whereas te first Domino's I worked at paid 1.15 per run, and the one I work for now WAS paying the same, but gas prices plummeted and they switched to .35 a mile, which at the current gas price is pretty decent. I never got offered promotions or raises anywhere other than Domino's. As a matter of fact, I'm currently a driver AND an MIT, so I will be starting to run shifts twice a week and close/opn drive the other three or four shifts. I have never had a problem working for Domino's. This is probably due more to the franchisees I worked for than Domino's itself, though."

If you do not work in the US, then ignore my comments.   And I got the job at a Papa John’s store getting paid $3.25 per delivery plus tips.  Not long after, he raised my rate to $4.00 per delivery.   These statements do not align with the reality I am aware of. Are you absolutely sure this is correct? I know of no Papa Johns, in the US, that pay their employees based on a per delivery rate.   He told me I was being paid more than any other driver and I should not tell anyone about this raise.   While your employer can ask this of you, he cannot make this a condition of employment. All employees in the US have rights under the NLRA; one of those rights is that an employee can speak to anyone, especially other employees, about their pay, regardless of the company's policies.   His response was that, when I start school, he would have to cut my rate to $3.50 per delivery,    Again, this does not compute. Assuming though that your employer's method of payment is correct, and lawful, your employer can reduce your direct wage. As long as your hourly pay, over the course of the pay period, is at least minimum wage. Depending on what State you live in, or other jurisdiction, that applicable minimum wage varies. What State do you work in?  And are you SURE that you're being paid on a per delivery rate and not an hourly rate + mileage reimbursement + tips?   I have been working for this man for one year and nine months and he rewards me by cutting my delivery rate. How do I deal with this situation?

Lots of initial shock delivering to Danny--no lights on at night, seeing him sit facing away from the TV, and when he'd count the money out it would go something like:  Me: hey Danny, that'll be thirty-two bucks.   He'd pull his money out, laboriously, and slowly peel the bills.  Danny: okay that's a twenty right?  Me: Yep.   Danny: and this is a ten, right?  Me: You got it.  And we'd  go through until he got the order paid for. He would tip decently considering where he lived.  Why I most liked Danny is that he fucking loved two things: his niece and his blind bowling league. He would get so geeked  just talking about either.   I forget my point but he was a sweet old man. Either way, blind folks are usually hip to when others may not know they're blind. Danny was a cool guy."

It always sucks when someone orders and it arrives even a couple minutes late, since that cuts into such a huge chunk of break time.

The first time I served her, when she was done I gave her her check which was about $12.50 IIRC.. She actually asked me, ""How much of a tip would you like?"". I was pretty taken aback at this since I have never been asked such a thing while serving tables. I decided to high ball it, and suggested $5. She responded, ""Oh, ok. Well here's $20.

Where I worked, the franchise paid minimum wage to drivers (8.05) but after a checklist, you'd get a 50 cent raise (8.55) we made 5% on all deliveries, and only delivered 5-8 mins from the store. Not all that bad, can quickly get deliveries since it's all fast-paced, meaning I could do 12 deliveries in a few hours with 3 other drivers (this was at a slow store) so I'd come home with 30-50 bucks for a few hours of driving. (Though I had a V8 and got 13mpg so it all went to my tank) I wouldn't do it again. Not with my car. Management was good, but I rubbed them the wrong way once and got fired.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3b04fi,chanchan69,2,Thu Jun 25 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"If you're in a densely populated urban environment or a college campus that allows bike delivery it's alright. I can't speak for the suburbs though. You just make minimum wage minus whatever they tax you for being tipped, plus DMR which for us is 50 cents a mile.   I deliver in Minneapolis, it could differ a lot city to city, suburban to urban, and what your franchise's policies are.  Lunch shifts solely depend on weather or not you can snag the catering orders. If you get it good with catering you can get $70-90 in a 3 hour lunch rush, a bad lunch rush will be around $25.  Nighttime shifts can be pretty good, it's not uncommon to snag near $100 during a 5 to 7 hour shift but $50-70 is more towards the average. I once made $170 in a 8 hour shift, and $205 in a 10 hour shift, but I did do nearly 60 miles of biking those shifts, with 50+ deliveries. You gotta be decently fit and understand traffic and how to be a bit of a bike dick when you need to.   The corporation sucks, fuck Jimmy.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3b04fi,JimmyJohnsOnaBike,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"I've had numerous discussions with JJ's delivery drivers, and they all seemed to be very reticent in providing information on how they are paid. And even when one of them is willing to provide true information, they are unable to provide it in a meaningful manner. Depending on their specific jurisdiction they may be paid via a form of tip-credit (which means means minimum wage), just like most delivery drivers. The other important factor to understand is how they are reimbursed when they use their personal vehicle for the primary benefit of their employer. Most have told me they receive a base percentage of the sales amount, usually something like 5%, which seems a bit arbitrary, and ruinously low, to me.  Here are some additional factors you should be aware of before accepting a position:   How large is the delivery area?  What is the average distance driven? What compensation do you receive if you use your personal vehicle to effect the deliveries? Are there other requirements for the position if you use your personal vehicle? Are those that use their personal vehicle, versus those that use person powered locomotion, paid the same on a per delivery basis? Lower? More?   If the employer allows (I use the term ""allow"" loosely) you to use your personal vehicle to effect deliveries and reimburses you at a rate of anything less than $0.35 per mile compensation is probably too little (not to mention a violation of the FLSA). You'll probably not make a lot in tips, since the sales amount will probably be less than $10.  IMO, those that seek employment at a JJ's, and using their personal vehicles, are doing so because the requirements are less with JJs than with a restaurant that delivers (pizza delivery). Because, and this is important to note, JJs does not require the employee to use their personal vehicle, they allow the employee to use their vehicle. There are legal reasons why they do this.  Edit: changed a word and removed some words."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3aw5j2,Dent18,7,Tue Jun 23 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"I assume you have a three compartment sink.  I fill sink #1 with hot soapy water.  I put all the dishes in it to soak and loosen dried on food, except I rinse off things like a sauce bucket with the sprayer before I put them in sink #1.  Sink #2 I leave empty, sink #3 is sanitizer water.  I grab individual dishes from sink #1, wash them with a rag, place them in sink #2, and continue until sink #2 is full.  Then I grab the sprayer and rinse off the dishes in sink #2, then move them to sink #3.  That way they are clean when they make it to sink #3.  The only thing that makes me uneasy is when people fill sink #2 to use as a rinse.  After the first soapy dish is placed in there, it contaminates all the other dishes with soap, which is then transferred to sink #3."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3aw5j2,the_eluder,2,Wed Jun 24 03:53:01 2015 UTC,"this is the best response; it get into the nitty gritty. right now i live in a housing coop with 10 people, and we can't agree on the right way to use our 2 1 /2 sink system.  the health department to do a 3 sink system is sink 1 is hot soapy water. maybe you have a sprayer so the dishes get rinsed beore they go in there. sink 2 is hot water, which washes off the soap, sink 3 is hot water with enough bleach to sanitize. unless you are using way too much soap - like my roommates do - this will rinse off all the soap by the time its done. another system that worked well when we were camping was sink 1 was for soaking, sink 2 was cleaner soapy water, sink 3 was a rinse. this makes me want a 4 sink system.  the way i sometimes do it, 3 bucket system when camping, is soap in bucket 1, sanitizer in 2, plain hot water in 3.   op's method, of just letting the water run, is wasteful.a batch process is more efficient. change the water every so often.  this is when you dont have a commercial automatic dishwasher."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3aw5j2,arbivark,2,Wed Jun 24 04:19:52 2015 UTC,This is the correct way. Drain and replace water in sink 1 often.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3aw5j2,dolphkhan,2,Wed Jun 24 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"Some of the employees at my location wash dishes like this also, specifically they leave sink #2 empty and then use a sprayer to rinse the dishes. This method is less efficient than submersing the entire dish into hot water; it's also not the accepted way of performing this duty. You are also expected to leave the dish submersed for at least 30 seconds. Your method, of spraying the dish off, means you probably only spray it for a few seconds at most; you are definitely not spraying the dish for 30 seconds.   The only thing that makes me uneasy is when people fill sink #2 to use as a rinse. After the first soapy dish is placed in there, it contaminates all the other dishes with soap, which is then transferred to sink #3.    Yet this is the accepted method that the health departments expect food service workers to perform this duty. The amount of soap transferred to the rinse sink is negligible if you are using the correct amount of soap in sink #1. And sink #3 is not just to sanitize, the chemicals that are used to sanitize are also there to remove any residual soap left. Rinsing with a sprayer means that more residue soap is left on the dish and reduces the effectiveness of the sanitizing solution."

When I see people wash using the three full sink method, I see soap bubbles in sink #2, and a soap film on sink #3.  When I do it my way, there is never any soap film in sink #3.

We had these little boxes in our pipes that would pre-mix soapy water and sanitizer solution so it was really easy.  Worst though was that every department (grill, icecream, and the front counter where we made smoothies) was in charge of our own dishes, but there was only room for one person at a time in a particular sink bin, and anyway we all had enough dishes to completely fill the sink.

Yeah sometimes I have to interact with customers but they pay me for it (usually) and I don't have to stand at a line making food all damn day.  At the same time, driving pays so well because its risky as hell. There are so many idiots on the road who don't take driving seriously that every single delivery I make could be my last. My zone is a major metropolitan area, I fight traffic and dumb suburbans merging without signaling and 18-wheelers whose drivers may or may not be competent at their job, and I spend every second on the road on high alert, even though I'm listening to my music the whole time.  Its something that non-drivers don't understand. People who don't think the job is worth a tip, inshoppers who are bitter because I make more than double their pay and do seemingly less work, they don't get how goddamn dangerous it is to be a driver. If I didn't get perks like listening to music anytime I'm not in view of the customers, I wouldn't do the job.  On topic, yeah music makes it so much better. I did a ride-along with a new hire and he didn't turn on any music, and it shocked me.

I actually really like cars a lot, I read about them, watch youtube, used to go to car shows etc. But to do this job and make the best money, you need to put your gear-head tendencies to the side. That said I know a few guys that do this are also mechanics, which does open up the possibilities as far as what you drive for work.  I've had a couple cars/toys in a lifted 79 Bronco and a 91 Mustang GT, but I just have kinda moved on and really enjoy not spending money on my car at all really. It's taking all my will power to not go out and buy a new fiesta ST though. I could wipe my savings and do it, ugh but again rather have the money."

In the restaurant though we have control over our sound system, which is playing off our computer and the stereo speakers are on the front counter between the kitchen and the dining room. So I get to sing along with Billy Joel or The Hollies or The Band while cooking. We play a wide variety of music but usually oldies. Sometimes we play modern music, but more ambient electro than pop. Think Hooverphonic or Massive Attack or Groove Armada. Music is very important to my job and my customers. But I confess a lot of the time when I'm delivering I'm listening to NPR podcasts.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3aqras,adnaus,3,Tue Jun 23 02:04:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry I didn't catch this thread earlier.  One of the evening drivers was a funny guy. Kind of a gamer-bro type, he used to hang out on the offtopic.com forums, and dated the girl who answered phones. He was always cracking jokes, and was really into his car. He drove (and this was 10+ years ago) a beater of an early-90s Mazda Protege, and spent a lot of his spare time and money to convert it into a J-Spec Infini Familia. Apart from it being left-hand-drive, he had it looking close to dead-on, and he was proud of it.  Well anyway, I was dating this girl who also worked as an insider, and happened to be at her house one night when I saw a bumper sticker on her dresser. The background was horizontal rainbow stripes, with text on it that said ""I KISS BOYS."" I asked her if she had any plans for the sticker, and she said she didn't, so she let me have it.  My next shift with this guy was a busy one, and I had the sticker in my car. I'm coming back from a delivery, and see his car right in front of the store. Without anybody seeing, I put the sticker right on his rear bumper.  Fast forward to hours later, the other driver gets back to the store while I'm inside. He had the best look on his face, and knew that I was the culprit. He could barely contain himself from laughing as well, and explained that he had stopped to get gas on his way back from a delivery and saw a bunch of fellow tuners. He went to talk shop with them and pointed out his car, at which point he (and this group of bros he just met) noticed my handiwork.  He knew I had gotten him good, and he was a great sport about it, though he vowed to get be back in kind. About a week later, I leave the store for a delivery, and see him hastily trying to apply a full side-length dragon decal to my '94 Camry. It was then that we both realized he had nothing, and nothing he could do could ever top my prank."

Tips are where our money is really made, so you need to do everything you can to maximize them.

And I've had a few that are always in a confrontational attitude, when I get to the door, even though the way the transaction unfolds is always the same. If you pay with a card, I need to verify the card. I also need to imprint only the last four numbers of the card on the receipt, to prove the numbers match and the card was present. The only numbers I see on a receipt are the last four. There is no way I can commit fraud with the last four numbers. I am doing this to protect you as a customer, and my company against fraud, unauthorized use of a card, theft, and charge backs. I get people, all the time, insisting a picture of the front and back of a card is as good as having the card in your possession.   Twenty years ago, we used to accept checks. Back then, 90% of them bounced. Note people are trying to pay with cards they don't own, to get free food. I don't care if it's your mother or friend, over 1000 miles away, buying you food on their card! If the card isn't there, you're not getting any food!  All it takes is someone paying with a card, the card isn't at the delivery address, we give them the food anyways, they stiff us, the original card owner says they never ordered food from us. Now the scum bag lying customer gets free food and the card holder gets their money back. Some customers act like we should pay them to eat our food!  I've had many kids answer the door, and take the food, and say their parents ordered it for them at work. Why are your kids at home alone?! There's no way for you to prove that the transaction is legit. It's just your word over ours. The bank will believe their customer over our business, so we give someone free food because the bank says they aren't going to pay us."

All it takes to attempt to get free food is someone place an order on the phone or online, give the cc number, expiration date, security code on back, and billing zip code. Get to the delivery and the card isn't there. They make up a story why the card isn't there. If the delivery person gives them the benefit of the doubt, and gives them the food, or doesn't ask for the card, then has the person sign for it or not. Then the original card holder says the card is stolen or they didn't order food from us. We have to give them their money back on the card or the bank refuses to release the funds to us.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3akcav,hebtha,49,Sun Jun 21 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"Stuck to the top of the box via a point of contact at the center like that is definitely a ""something too heavy was on top of here with no pizzatable plastic box support"".  The cardboard steams from the pizza and weakens a bit, you stack a heavy order that's first on the way on top (or the soda if you're an idiot), that's what happens.  (I think you can even see the crease in the side of the lid where the cardboard has bowed in in the picture.)  If it had been actually dropped, just thinking logically, I'd expect grease marks on the lid from all the slices hitting or more toppings-slide if it was at an angle, not just this mark in the center.  But ""dropped pizza"", whether it actually was dropped or not, is one of the few complaints that feels like it actually reflects 100% on me individually -- late food, cold food, wrong food complaints all will be hollered directed at the driver because that's the customer's point of contact, but everybody generally knows there's a good chance it's not their fault: it was the line missing the ""no ham"", it was the dispatch situation with a full screen of orders and two drivers; the complaint gets diffused.  X dropped the pizza: that's me, and there's generally no situational excuse, no way to share the blame.  And I like to be not-shitty at my job, as shitty as it is to me sometimes.  So, if that happens, I'm going to immediately peek in the box to assess the status of the food before calling for a remake if necessary (thin crusts can take a bit of a jostle because the toppings are more secure; pans, on the other hand, are forfeit if you so much as tilt the box more than a few degrees from horizontal while it's too hot).  I want to preempt any possible customer complaint, because you've got management even above the store level keeping a hawk's eye on that shit and it is not fun to have people telling your boss's boss that you fucked up."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3akcav,asyst0lic,26,Sun Jun 21 04:56:06 2015 UTC,"This is why you should always, always put pizzas in the bag sideways.  The flutes of the corrugated fiber board (colloquially ""cardboard"" - though this is incorrect) run parallel to the y-axis when you're looking at it head on.  If you put it in the bag head on, ||||||||| that's the orientation of the flutes. All the forces from the bag handles are coming from the left and right sides. Between flutes is the least rigid part of the corrugated fiber board.  By rotating the pizza box 90o the forces are now perpendicular to the flutes, which are much more rigid.  If you're putting more than one pizza in a bag, the best way is to have the bottom one sideways, then alternate the position 90o for each additional pizza. This way the flutes are always perpendicular to each other, which creates more support and rigidity.  Source: Former electromechanical engineer who finds himself back in the pizza game."

Essentially, it depends on what the original plane of reference is for a piece of software.   If the software developed out of motion picture or video game (think platform side-scrollers) modeling, ""y=up"" because a movie screen/TV/computer monitor is typically vertical and the Z dimension then is ""in and out of the screen"".   Whereas if the software developed from architectural tools, the plane of reference was blueprints, which are typically thought of as being rolled out on a tabletop. Z is then ""in-and-out"" of the table surface.  So, my apologies for acting so matter-of-factly."

Hell, if I received that pizza you showed, I wouldn't mind, because hey, shit happens.  I did had one person get upset at some jostled pizzas and somewhat squished boxes, though. I had to take 6 pies at once to a bunch of engineering students on campus (and let me tell you, they're a real special bunch). He tried to make me give him a discount, but the person who was actually paying just walked over, opened a box, straightened it out, and handed me the money.

I'll generally open it up and inspect it, pizzas are remarkably resilient to cosmetic damage once the cheese has solidified to a certain point.  One time early in my pizza career I tripped on a set of stairs at a dorm and the pizza box was bent at a 90 degree angle.  I didn't want to have to come back, so I just straightened out the box, luckily the bend was right along a cut line, so the pizza wasn't damaged.  Needless to say, if the pizza is damaged, or anything comes out of the box during the fall, I just take it back to the store and wouldn't serve it."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3akcav,the_eluder,3,Sun Jun 21 05:20:50 2015 UTC,"If I suspected that the pizza jostled or got smashed, I would always check it before delivering. If it was messed up, I would show it to the customer(some people really don't care, because they are hungry) and ask if they'd like me to call the store and have it remade. BUT, if I missed something happening to it, I'd definitely not have a problem coming back out there to your house after a 5 dollar tip. Just show the driver that arrives with the remake what the problem was, and they will understand.  Also, when you call the store, just explain it calmly and ask if it's possible for a remake to be made. They will always say yes in this situation, but the nicer you are about it, the cooler everybody will be. The big companies are always told to do whatever the customer asks in situations like this, so yelling and all that actually makes no difference.  But yeah, I've never actually DROPPED a pizza and expected the customer to be cool with it. I did it once and called the store immediately for a remake because I dicked up. That was probably just somebody that had a few deliveries that stacked something smaller than the box on top of it to make that happen. Or maybe they were not too smart and put a soda on top of it or something. Either way, yeah.... if you called the store and just explained it, they'd solve it.

That would be kind of messed up. I've dropped 2 orders in my time as a driver and each time, I went back to the store to have it remade and then called the customer and told them honestly what happened. And I don't think I've ever known another driver to drop a pizza and deliver it anyway. They could potentially get in huge trouble over it.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3agkwm,dickravishing,3,Mon Jun 22 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"No matter what place you work for, people want free food. I can't understand that mind set. There was a burnt spot on their order, they want everything free, the entire order remade (even though they ate most of it), and money back.  TL;DR: People want free food and to get paid for eating it."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ad306,jbh007,71,Fri Jun 19 03:13:54 2015 UTC,"I swear, some people are incapable of realizing that preparing and delivering hot food actually takes longer than 5 seconds. I've had customers call in for carry-out orders and complain that they had to wait 15 minutes to pick up their order. Since when is 15 minutes a long time to wait for your food at any restaurant (other than a fast food place)?  My favorite is when customers go ""I have to wait 15 minutes?? Can't you make it ready in 10?"" Like yeah dicknose, it takes 15 minutes to make the pizzas for our normal customers, but you're so fucking special that we'll make it super fucking quickly and have it ready in 10 minutes just for you."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ad306,emshlaf,21,Fri Jun 19 08:00:39 2015 UTC,"The line I always used with customers was ""We're not fast food."" Yeah, we're affordable and convenient, but in a perfect scenario, with zero distractions and a small order, it takes a minimum of 8 minutes before the food is ready. That's not fast food."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ad306,ottergoose,23,Fri Jun 19 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if the app told her it'd take 40 minutes, and it was time she didn't have (screaming kids, had somewhere to get to after eating, whatever), and canceled the order, that's completely reasonable from her perspective. If you cancel the order via the app, and the notification doesn't get to you, that's the app's fault, not hers."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ad306,MartyMcMuffin,2,Sat Jun 20 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"I agree on that if someone didn't expect to wait more then a normal wait time on a pizza (and I consider 20-30 minutes reasonable for delivery), it's not their fault that there was a miscommunication.  However if someone has screaming, hungry kids the last thing they should be doing is ordering food that they should know will take more then five minutes to get to the door. Or if they know they need to be somewhere at least plan ahead for a long wait time."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ad306,UnkleRuckus420,2,Sat Jun 20 01:38:42 2015 UTC,"Did Grubhub pay for that? Our store has/had 3 (I believe it's down to 2) companies that do the same thing. Generally they have 1 or 2 specials that beat ours but a majority of the time the customer ends up paying at least $2 more than we would have charged. I've taken a couple that have had issues and the company paid for the order, including tip, when the customer refused to pay."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ad306,MAGICHUSTLE,2,Fri Jun 19 21:30:49 2015 UTC,Delivery for me has taken close to two hours before.  Typically it's about an hour or so. 45 minutes is fast to me.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,abigfatphoney,33,Thu Jun 18 22:16:02 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar delivery earlier this week. The house was off a major road and I miraculously spot the small numbers on the mailbox with enough time to turn off onto the driveway. I walk up the porch and ring the bell and knock on the door (I always do both). A disgruntled old dick, as you put it, opened the door furious that I went to the wrong door and that he put the instructions on the internet. I look at the ticket and of course there are no instructions.  I try to explain to him that I had no instructions and he just goes off on me. Finalizing with the ever great ""you wont get my business again!"" line.  I love how customers think we would be upset by that line, when in reality hearing that from an asshole/cheapo is music to our ears. I can not even begin to understand how shitty your day/life must be to get so pissed off over someone going to the ""wrong"" door."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,ghostplush,18,Fri Jun 19 00:37:49 2015 UTC,"Ugh, right? The one thing that baffled me the most about how angry my customer was that when I order food for delivery, you know what happens when I hear a knock on my door? I get happy because that means my food is there!    If you don't want somebody knocking on your door, don't fucking order a delivery! I could understand being mad at me for knocking if he had asked me to call when there, but that wasn't even his problem!"

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,bigpolar70,25,Tue Jun 23 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"Why is your manager being all passive-aggressive about it?  If you are going to ban him, straight up tell him he's banned, and that you don't deliver to people who curse out the drivers.  Now you still have to deal with him.    And somebody is going to forget he's banned after the sticky note falls off the wall, and you'll get cursed out again.  My manager would never ban someone who tipped $5 and told a driver to ""get the fuck off his porch.""  For a $5 tip, the drivers I worked with would have put a * by his name so they knew to take the delivery.  It would have quickly become a running joke - get cussed out and get paid.  Edit - we would definitely bitch about him being an asshole, but an asshole who tips is 10x better than a really nice, polite guy who wishes us to have a blessed day and pays with exact change."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,caeliter,11,Thu Jun 18 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Our owner takes the ""Customer is always right"" nonsense to the extreme, so if we are going to ban somebody from deliveries, he's afraid of us actually telling them to their face, hence the manager is forced to deal with the situation the way she did.    I'm the only driver at my store, and 5 dollars isn't worth my dignity. I'd rather lose out on that 5 bucks than deliver to the asshole."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,bigpolar70,-1,Thu Jun 18 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"Damn.  You have the exactly the opposite attitude that I and everyone I worked with had.    Maybe you are in a better position than I was, but especially when I was delivering at Domino's, where a $1.50 tip was considered decent, I would absolutely have taken runs to an angry old man who cussed at me but tipped $5.    Heck, I did actually get regularly bumped up in the queue to take runs to the fat naked hippy (who wasn't usually naked, just once or twice when he was on something) because it was always a $4 tip and one of the female drivers got creeped out by it.  That was hardly universal though, the other two didn't care and would fight to get the run.  An extra $4 meant you could splurge and hit the dollar menu on the way home."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,caeliter,3,Thu Jun 18 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at some of my other jobs at mom and pop places where I got paid less than minimum wage off the books? I'd probably put up with it for the tip, but I kinda lucked out with my current job.    It's a bit over minimum wage, and I frequently get large catering orders for parties and such with very good tips, so maybe I've gotten a little spoiled, but either way, it feels nice to have the ability to refuse to deliver to somebody for being over-the-top rude and belligerent to me."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,Kitsunami,2,Thu Jun 18 22:51:25 2015 UTC,your average tip is $0.50?

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3ac54x,slim_chance,6,Fri Jun 19 05:55:02 2015 UTC,"I've had a few people comment on my knock before, which always surprised me. I don't like playing the ""did they hear me?"" game so I do average louder intentionally, but it never seemed excessive.  Anyway, a couple weeks back, I knocked a little quieter than usual because I was a bit distracted coming up to the door. I scolded myself while I waited, and sure enough, nothing happened. So I amped it up a bit. I went through this for a three separate knocks that didn't yield anything before just giving it the cop knock.  The guy came out so mad about it that I thought he was joking."

Gotta stand there for a minute or so before you knock so the customer doesn't think you're an impatient douche.    Even worse is when you wait long enough to knock and they don't come, so you gotta wait longer to try knocking again before you call them."

Doorbell > Knock > Knock > phone call  I then start calling about 5 or 6 times because people don't pick up for numbers they don't know even when they order food.  If I head back to the store, my boss will tell me to drop off the delivery again once they call back so I get fucked either way."

One of the things we're all for is no change for $100 or $50 bills unless we recognize you by name.  In the 9 months I've been at my spot we've gotten $160 in counterfeit bills.  First time customer, no way. It's not worth risking the food, the money, or most importantly, the welfare of the delivery driver. There's a lot of lists, but delivery driving is always on the top ten most dangerous jobs in the USA. Fuck being robbed and assaulted over chump change.  The other change is no god damn online orders for cash and no phone orders for cash late at night.  We've lost way more in late night cash orders for customers that are too drunk and passed out by the time we get there than anything else."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a9p4t,DBH114,3,Mon Jul 6 11:25:33 2015 UTC,"Unless the order is >$80, never bring change for a $100. Classic robbery setup."

I certainly wouldn't do it for a first time customer unless it was at a reputable hotel.  And actually, now that I think about it, the size of the order shouldn't matter. An $85 order plus change for a hundred just means you're going to get jacked for $20 and $85 worth of food."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a9p4t,Scourge108,3,Thu Jun 18 12:04:53 2015 UTC,Yes your right. I'm half asleep. Most customers would ask if you have change for a $100. So the correct response would be a driver never carries more than $20 so we can only change your $100 if the order is >$80.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a9p4t,Jay_Train,2,Thu Jun 18 12:18:58 2015 UTC,New customers don't get change for 100. People I've delivered to before can get whatever change they want.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a836p,redditcoruum,4,Sat Jun 20 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"You're right, that is fucking ridiculous. I wish people realized that it really makes more sense to just put in a specific order time if you already know no one's going to be there...  Reminds me of a delivery experience I had a while back.  I drive out an online order to the apartment and ring the doorbell, pizza box in hand. A minute of complete silence goes by. No footsteps, no shout of ""I'll be right there!"" through the door, not a peep. Goddamn it, is this what I think it is? I ring it a couple more times, then check the label to find the customer's number and punch it into my phone.  Nothing, the dude doesn't pick up. Great, what a fucking waste of time. I wait for a little longer then try the number again. This time the guy picks up.  ""Hello?""  ""Hi, I've got a pizza here for delivery. Are you at the address ______ right now?""  ""Oh no, that's actually not my apartment. It's my friend's, I wanted to surprise her with a pizza! I'm actually calling from LA."" (this is all the way across the country from our location)  Ugh, really? It's a nice gesture and all, but if you can't be sure that your friend will actually be there to take the delivery, then it's really not such a great idea logistically. You have no idea what they were planning on doing for dinner either.  ""Ah, I see. Well can you do me a favor and call your friend to check in? Or just give me her number and I can call her directly?""  ""Yeah sure, it's xxx-xxxx.""  ""OK thanks, bye.""  I punch her number in.  ""Hi, I'm prohitman with <pizza place>. Your friend paid for a pizza for you - but you don't seem to be at home right now. When should we expect you to be at your residence?""  ""Oh - well I won't be back until about three hours from now.""  ""Hmm. Then let's do this. Since that's a long time away, we don't want to hold onto this same pizza and re-deliver it. It's been paid for, so we'll make you a new one at 6 and come back with a fresh pizza at that time.""  ""That works, thank you!""  Well, now the surprise is ruined, and my total wasted time is half an hour factoring in the drive to and from. At least I'll get to keep this pizza now since we can't redeliver...  I call my manager and tell her the situation and ask her to put in a ticket for a timed pizza at 6.  Fast forward to the end of my shift, 8 or 9. I take the pizza from before and head out the door to my car. Just as I'm unlocking the car door, I remember. Oh shit - I never reminded my manager to put in the order! It never happened! Too late to do anything about it now. I just say ""fuck it"" and head back home at that point. We never got a call from either of the two people about it, and since the slip was never signed, the credit card transaction was never put through. So at least we didn't charge anybody for a pizza that was never delivered.  tl;dr: took an order to an empty apartment, received my tip six hours later in the form of a large pepperoni pizza"
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a836p,redditcoruum,2,Thu Jun 18 18:32:57 2015 UTC,I saw that note on a delivery one time... the biggest mistake I made was getting out of the car and dropping it off nicely. Should have just tossed the pies onto the driveway out of my car window. But they actually left a good address.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a836p,SoldMySoulToReddit,-5,Tue Jun 23 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"I am replying as I read your story... (I might have to edit due to formatting)   It all started one normal evening. An online order came in for a delivery. As I prepared the delivery, I printed out the receipt and saw it had the following note:  ""If no one answers leave food at door.""   This would have resulted in a phone call. If no answer, then no delivery would have been attempted.   If the customer called back later, we would have informed them we would be performing a callback before we attempted the delivery. Meaning that we would disconnect the current call with the ""customer"" and call them back on the number they had provided us originally. If there was an answer, and it was the customer, the order would have gone out; assuming the customer paid via credit card.   ""Great,"" I thought to myself as I packed up the 2 boxes and two-liter. I was not looking forward to the possibility that no one would even be there to answer the door. Granted, it wasn't a huge deal since they had already paid online (with a pre-tip of $2), but I still wasn't particularly happy about it.   Well, at least they tipped? /s  Still not going out the door unless...   I headed to the street and noticed I could not find their house number. No problem, I'll just call them.   Really... (I know my opinion on this subject is opposite of the accepted norm but seriously??) You should have called before you left. Yes, I am a judgmental bastard. And in your situation I can effectively tell you exactly how much money you saved your employer by using your persona cell phone for the primary benefit of your employer, otherwise know as Unjust enrichment via Criminal conversion and specifically known as a rebate of wage/Kick-back in your state of residence.    For fuck's sake, dude. Now he was really starting to annoy me. How the hell do you not know your own address?   Ok.. I am reading and seriously... how many warnings do you need?   Fucking seriously?   Yep. Seriously.   Really asshole? That's not even remotely close to the first number you gave me. I was becoming livid but I managed to keep my cool.   Well, if I had reached this point (in a fantasy world) I would have just informed this person that the product would be at the store when they decided to pick it up.    And then I finally headed back to the store after wasting about 30 minutes of my life searching for that dumb fucking house. I still don't know if it ended up at the right address but at that point I was beyond giving any fucks about it. I should've known better and just not taken it when I saw that note.    I am so happy you actually made it back to your store, instead of being... robbed, assaulted, raped, or murdered.  I understand you live in a low crime city, in relation to some of the other cities in your State, but you, and every single delivery driver, need to use common sense and apply some basic safety guidelines to how you/they conduct themselves. Safety/security policies are written in blood, literally and figuratively."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a836p,redditcoruum,6,Thu Jun 18 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"I actually did call before I left. I didn't include that in the story because I didn't want it to be too lengthy. He confirmed the address and I figured it may have been a newer house that wasn't on the maps yet.  I understand your point about safety, and I agree with you completely. However, in my defense, it was pretty easy to tell that this wasn't an attempted robbery and that the customer really was truly clueless. Additionally, the delivery occurred during broad daylight and I was on a very busy street, so even if he tried to rob/mug/rape me there would have been no possible way he could have gotten away with it without someone seeing.  I really do appreciate your concern, though."

OK, I can see how you could draw that conclusion. I might have done the same, since we have a lot of new construction in our delivery area.   However, in my defense, it was pretty easy to tell that this wasn't an attempted robbery and that the customer really was truly clueless.   Yes, I can see that too. I was commenting as I was reading your story.   so even if he tried to rob/mug/rape me there would have been no possible way he could have gotten away with it without someone seeing.   Where there's a will, there's a way. (Yes I know how creepy that sounds) In the event you take up this type of job in your new location, you will want to, seriously, take safety into consideration. Even in those areas where you believe are safe, they are not. I grew up in the area where you may be moving too, so I have first hand experience of being ""jumped"" in an area that I KNEW was safe."

I get it, some younger kids can be nervous wrecks in any social situation, and I feel for them and semi-apologize for my rant in those cases where it's warranted.

That can be somewhat hidden, e.g. second pizza is really cheap if you go to the store. Likely I'd round off the amount, but that's it. Especially if there's already a delivery charge then it seems pretty strange to tip. Person should just get a good wage and be happy if there's a tip.

Whether or not you do tip is entirely up to you, but in the USA it is (currently) customary to do so.  Something like 30% of my income is from tips. If that went away, I'd consider another line of work. There are plenty of less stressful and all around cushy jobs that I could take that match my base pay. I work in pizza because I like to be active, I'm damn good at it, and it pays better than any other job I could get at this point in my life due purely to the tips."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a7712,TannerRed,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:01:59 2015 UTC,"On you to decide or not.  I worked in a Subway years ago, I never expected a customer to tip.  It was a pleasant surprise if someone did.  Now if you happen to be a customer running in as were putting the close sign up, or needed 15 specific subs.    You still don't need to tip, but anything you say like ""thank you so much, I know I was a bother"" seems insincere without tipping and any worker that just had to put up with it is cursing in the back of their mind at the customer.  Any good worker is still smiles and exchanging pleasantries though as the customer leaves.   So tip if you feel like it, and you should maybe tip if you feel a business goes out of their way to take care of you because they see you as a regular they like.  Even then, I remember having customers that didn't tip and I still loved taking them because they were fun to talk to and serve because they weren't stupid.."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,3a7712,redditcoruum,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"Subway or jimmy johns.    Ok, my opinion on this subject is complex and sometimes conflicting.  I dislike the idea of a ""tip jar"" because one never knows how those tips will be disbursed. Since I am a tipped employee, and understand the minutia/laws surrounding what makes a tipped employee, I see a tip jar as a way for multiple parties to abuse the concept of a tip.  A tip jar constitutes a tip pool, but it also constitutes the idea that the in store staff are tipped employees. Let me tackle whether the in store staff are tipped employees.  Are they tipped employees? They are not. They are not because they are not providing a personal service. They are not because they will not, in all likelihood, report this income.  It takes reporting your tips to make you/allow you to be classified as a tipped employee. They should also NOT report this income, because if they do, and then the employer classifies the in store staff as tipped employees the employer could then pay the employee less than minimum wage.  Tip pool: Is it a valid tip pool? Maybe, probably not. Who controls the disbursement of the tips placed into the tip pool? Who determines who receives what amount? How do I know the amount I placed into the tip pool will go to the person that I believed provided me with a personal service.   A tip is the sole property of the tipped employee. The employee may not want to be classified as a tipped employee. They may earn more than minimum wage, receiving a smallish amount of tips per month, that results in them having their direct pay being reduced below minimum wage, may well result in them now making exactly minimum wage.  All that being said... I will put money in the tip jar. I ask questions of the person that provided me the service I deemed worthy of a tip. If they cannot answer my questions well enough, I give them money directly to them and tell them it is theirs and it should not go into the pool."

The in-store staff (at stores that have in-store staff) and the drivers make minimum wage ($9.47 currently) plus tips and driver reimbursement (Was per delivery, $1 in my area but different in others. Now it has changed to a per mile system that takes some other things into account like if it is a new or old car). Tipping was decently consistent but if we weren't busy then no one was walking home with a lot of cash. Expect ~$3 or $4/delivery when averaged at the end of the night.  A shift manager makes a negligible amount more. I constantly had difficultly keeping shift managers because there was a fair amount more responsibility but almost no additional compensation. I wouldn't know how much they make now but when I left Pizza hut we had just finished getting them bumped to $10/hour (remember, minimum wage is $9.47 now and was $9.17 or so when I left iirc).   As an Assistant manager I was salaried at 40 hours per week, 25k per year.   As a RGM I started salaried at 50 hours per week, 35k per year plus bonus based on the performance of my restaurant. When I resigned I was making 37.5k/year. This is a bit misleading though because the work load coupled with the understaffed stores typically meant the RGMs put in closer to 70 hours per week and had to be available to deal with problems whenever."

They will lie through their teeth to get what they want, and they will happily screw you over to get it.  Anyone that's been in this industry for any length of time will have had any or all of the following:   Fake address just inside delivery area. When driver calls customer, it will be ""actually it's just at this address, it's only a couple of minutes further, and you're already out here anyway...."" Driver ""forgotten"" drinks / desserts, and when driver is pulled up on it, they will swear on their first-born that everything was delivered. ""You sent the wrong pizza"". Fine we'll do a remake, but give us the original back. End up getting a box filled with trash just to make it feel like there's some weight in it. My favourite, I ordered my food an hour ago, and it's still not here. When I checked the system, ""actually you ordered 30 minutes ago, and the driver left the store 10 minutes ago. He'll be with you any minute"".   So yes, customers will fuck you over. They don't care if it costs you extra fuel to get to them. That you'll be late getting to other deliveries because you've had to go further to get to them. And they don't care that they are essentially stealing form the company just so they can get free stuff.

But I will limit my reply to just this one comment.   They don't care if it costs you extra fuel to get to them.   It should never cost the delivery driver for the extra fuel. The employer should, and is expected to, reimburse the employee for that additional cost of returning to their, the employer's, customer's location. No delivery driver should accept a situation where they incur a cost of operating their vehicle without fair reimbursement. The law supports this position.  Edit: added a word."

I work for a franchised Pizza Hut in the UK. The franchisee pays £1 per delivery. This is supposed to cover fuel, and wear and tear on the vehicle. It's bullshit. On the longer runs, it barely covers the fuel.  So if a driver goes towards the edge of our trade zone, where fuel costs are barely met, and then get asked by the customer to go further, then it is the driver who incurs that extra cost.   Now the drivers are perfectly entitled to refuse to deliver, and I will always back them up on that, but most people will take the view that they are already 90% there, so will finish the drop.   Any time we've been in the situation, I've paid an extra drop to the driver, but the customer doesn't know that. As far as I've been told by franchisee, there's nothing that forces us to pay the extra, but that could just be the boss being a tight fucker!"

What I can tell you is that there are attorneys in the US that are fighting for delivery drivers on this issue. Pizza Lawsuits is one such firm.

Ok... a quick investigation shows that equates to approximately $1.56. That is 6 cents more than what I receive. But I am sure our fuel costs are lower. Without knowing specific information I can only guess that what is being paid in mileage compensation might be ruinously low.   As far as I've been told by franchisee, there's nothing that forces us to pay the extra,   Of course the franchisee (the employer) will say this. Even if they KNEW they were expected to pay it, they would most likely SAY that they are not expected to pay it.   I am sure all the employers involved in the many lawsuits in the US have made the same statements, yet they've all (except for those still litigating) have increased their mileage compensation."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,39v5hv,Malak77,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"True. If you're inside the store's zone and get told that, it must be very frustrating. You've either got a new staff member, or someone who doesn't know what they're doing.  But if I send a driver outside my trade zone, that delivery is usually late. Because the driver is late getting back, subsequent deliveries are then also late. Complaints all round.  In my town we have roads called Old Orchard, Orchard Croft, Old House Croft, and outside my zone there is Old House Lane.  The drivers know which of these we can go to, but most of the receptionists don't drive. They get given a post code which is only a couple of digits out from legitimate addresses and process the order. The road sounds very similar, and I can guarantee that the customer will say they are in our town, when in fact they are in a surrounding village.  So when I say that we don't go to that address, and the customer says we've been there before, my view is just because we've made a mistake once, it doesn't mean we are going to keep repeating it.  I'd rather piss off one person who we shouldn't be delivering to, than 2 people who have delayed orders because of it."

I guess I was imagining the dozens of orders they already brought to me.  lol   She finally relented. This particular place is famous for screwing-up orders and we stopped getting stuff from them over a year ago. Nothing is worse than peppers on a steak when you hate peppers and have to pick them out, but the juice remains. Ick."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,39v5hv,TheDrunkenChud,6,Wed Jun 17 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"I had this happen once. The guy told me he lived a block from the store. A couple miles later I arrived a little annoyed. He was very nice and tipped decently though, so I felt a bit better. I jokingly said ""Your house is a little more than a block haha"". With a serious poker face he says ""It's just a long block..."""
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,39v5hv,Scourge108,4,Mon Jun 15 04:48:53 2015 UTC,"I hate that shit. We have a huge area, abs I'm pretty solid on 90% of the streets. Which is literally in the hundreds. Seriously, my delivery area is ridiculous.   Anyhow, I always get the assholes that ask, ""do you deliver to 5 and close street?"" Me, ""yeah, what's the address?"" Them, ""10011 bumfuckerton"". Me, ""that's nowhere near 5 and close, that's more like 11 and no fucking way."" Though, usually said more tactfully. Some people have a real liberal view of distance."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,39v5hv,nrlulz,2,Mon Jun 15 05:58:30 2015 UTC,"This is why you really shouldn't make exceptions to the delivery area.  Sure if an address is just out of range and it's slow and they offer a good tip, it seems like a good idea at the time.  But then they call back when it's a different situation, and ""you delivered here last time"" is some kind of promise in the customer's eyes that it will always be so."

He's several miles out. What really pissed me off is when told he was out of our area, he'd throw his little tantrum, whining about ""but you did it last time,"" then call back ten minutes later and try to get someone else to put his order through, and it actually worked for him a couple times. Seeing the out of area delivery on the screen didn't annoy me as much as whoever took the order (inadvertently) rewarding his childish behavior..."

Waited until you were walking away and called you back to ask if you carried it. Odd guy, to say the least.  Always order 50-70$ of food and never tipped, too. Was tempted to get a bottle of bacon flavored ketchup just to offer the guy. Never did though."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,39up5y,idontlikeu6,2,Mon Jun 15 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"Before I got hired where I am now, I applied at about 12 different places.  I have around 10 years of pizza experience, mostly cooking and management, but I was only applying to drive.  I had 1 place ""hire me"" and then a few days later pull the same shit to me as that place did to you.  I had another place call me in for an interview, I went in only to find the owner leaving for an emergency.  He took my number and said he'd call later that day, never called.  Another place told me the new schedule was going up and they would put me on it then call to let me know....no call.  It really bothered me but I still needed something.  I bucked up and went out a few days later and hit a bunch more spots.  I must have showered that day because the first spot hired me, and the second called me and set up an interview but I did not take that as it seemed to be mostly cooking with a few deliveries here and there.  Just keep trying.  Where I live there are over 25 pizza shops within 6 miles.  I bet you have a bunch near you too."

One of my coworkers is a magician as a side job and he got me in on the waiting list.  so far I've had magic deliver a bottle of vikingsblod mead to Rhode Island, a breakfast burrito and vanilla latte to a suburb in Northern California, a dozen donuts and coffee to a TSA agent friend working at LAX, requested a fully decked out picnic to be waiting for me and my girlfriend at the top of a mount Diablo hiking trail at the summit, and a pack of camel crush cigarettes in the middle of a shopping mall in rancho cucamonga.  Magic rocks, and they love to fulfil interesting and challenging orders. You just have to be willing to shell out the cash for the convenience."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,39tpal,DontNeedNoBadges,8,Sun Jun 14 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"GetMagicNow is a concierge service. You text them a request, they quote you a price, you confirm or decline, they take care of the details.  Want a chipotle burrito while you're drunk and the closest chipotle is 45 mins away? they'll make the order and deliver it to you using a courier.  Can't find a sweater in a specific style? They'll find it and quote you a price and ask your size, then deliver it.  Trying to find a way to surprise your girlfriend? Ask them and they'll toss some ideas around with you that you wouldn't even have considered.  suck at being romantic? They'll get you reservations for dinner, flowers at the table, and a cutesy card for the occasion. You give them money, they handle the details, you just look like a suave motherfucker.  For example,  I texted magic and said ""i want a picnic for two at the peak of mount diablo.""  they said ""ok, any special requests? flowers? specific food?""  i told them ""no, just food that would be good for after a hike""  they handled the delivery, picnic setup, and food purchases.  All i had to do was hike up there, bring my girlfriend, and get to the spot where it was waiting for us.  Now, imagine you're the date in this situation. Your partner has taken the time to get a picnic, delivered, ready and waiting. How smooth is that? That's some Tony Stark level smoothness.  granted, i COULD have spent an hour buying groceries, then another hour getting the picnic set up, then gone back down the mountain to get my GF, then hike back up there and hope the setup wasn't trashed. But instead i got to enjoy my time with my GF without stressing at all. Totally worth the cost."

Now that I have graduated with a decent job and about to close on my first house that should be finished this month, I plan on giving a 50+ dollar tip to a delivery driver just because I know how awesome it feels!
