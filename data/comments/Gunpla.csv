Gunpla,3e35cn,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:08 2015 UTC,its a pretty solid kit aside from the shoulders and wrist. i personally like the g-lucifer.

I plan on customizing him but for now, here's a straight build, some pics and a quick personal review! Enjoy! This kit is a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes Build Fighters and or Gundam Wing. All others are exempt but highly encouraged to purchase lol"
Gunpla,3e2i2z,rxsiu,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:24 2015 UTC,"I think ill be grabbing one of these now then. Saw them in Akihabara last month while i was in Tokyo and decided to skip over it and just load up on other things, kinda kicking myself now, as they were cheap there too.   You mentioned it came with alot of extra parts, you have any pictures, are any of those usable to maybe kitbash with? I have a project im working on currently of refurb/kitbashing my old HG Sandrock and heavyarms custom."
Gunpla,3e2i2z,rumilb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah its worth it. Like i said, lots ofextra frame parts from MG Wing Gundam but nothing worth constructings. Since all the Armor pieces were used for Fenice, all thats left is older shoulder and leg pieces. And some inner wing pieces. Nothing capable of being built though as they're too spread out. Atleast 40 extra pieces tho. Just check Mech9.com's manual for MG Fenice and youll see all the crossed out pieces. maybe you an build something using MG Wing's manual but i doubt it"
Gunpla,3e2i2z,XTC-FTW,4,Tue Jul 21 21:34:03 2015 UTC,Holy crap. How did you find it for $29... That's like the price of an HG Rinascita in the west.

Gunpla,3e2i2z,XTC-FTW,3,Tue Jul 21 19:25:33 2015 UTC,Local hobby store East coast of Canada... $29.99 plust 15% tax

I didn't really like the flame effects - everyone's done 'em, and I couldn't think of how best to make them metallic without looking toylike.  The wings are a quick and easy add-on, they did require a brush coat of superglue, dried of course, to securely fit into the holes where the flames go into the back."
Gunpla,3e2j3q,thelastbaldwin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"holy crap that looks sick! but hey if you do plan on going with panel lining, why not use something chrome like too? maybe that might be going too far...  cant wait to start experimenting with paint, my mr hobby clear colors are taking waaaay too long to get here! Dx"
Gunpla,3e2j3q,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:12 2015 UTC,I'm probably going to go with burnt umber once I can figure out the right mixture of paint:turpenoid lighter fluid to do a panel line wash.  It never seems to work out.  The paint just turns a bit globby.
Gunpla,3e11ex,Cowvine,4,Tue Jul 21 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"Another amazing diorama from eiji - you see more pictures of this diorama here. http://www.modelers-g.jp/modules/myalbum/photo.php?lid=22311  Really amazing work, down to the weathering, and led work (especially where the gm exploded and smoke is coming out)  Edit: I'm honestly amazed at how people do dioramas nowadays to make them look so realistic, I was wondering where I could go to find materials to make this stuff?"
Gunpla,3e11ex,Maxlovesamber,2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:10 2015 UTC,"Some of the material is amazingly deceptive. My former manager builds 40k models and goes the full 9 yards with it. He's shown me how to use everything from old action figures to bottle caps and tin cans to make environments and effects. From there it's just paint and effort. I have to admit, this is the kind of work I want to do in the very near future."

Gunpla,3e40md,shpeilin,4,Tue Jul 21 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"My only suggestion would be to change the gold for silver.  You have a lot of highly contrasting colors already; changing the gold for silver will still give you that striking metallic effect, but will also mellow out the contrast a bit."
Gunpla,3e40md,sdwoodchuck,3,Tue Jul 21 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"I think the colors don't really match only because of the tones you've used. I think tweaking the tones of each color will bring it together, I'm leaning towards a darker cyan/red."
Gunpla,3e40md,Finishingtothesky,3,Tue Jul 21 20:52:22 2015 UTC,It seems like the general consensus is that the scheme needs a lot of improvement. I went ahead and made another attempt using the suggestions from this thread.

Gunpla,3e40md,DDRM,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think blood red and dark turquoise go together at all.   It looks like you've tried to distribute three colours across a lineart evenly, and it doesn't work for me at all. The DRAGOON launchers being a different colour to the rest of the wing assembly looks a little strange, and having such a contrasting colour for the facemask compared to the rest of the head will not look good in my opinion."

Gunpla,3e1jwi,Cyberrequin,4,Tue Jul 21 06:26:57 2015 UTC,"had an accidental spill of an acrylic paint cleaner today while i had the main body part of the heavy arm 1/100 sitting on the desk, cleaned it up immediately and let the main body sit for about an hour as i only thought it got on his back plate, went to remove said back piece to repaint it and the entire main frame completely just crumpled like it was made of sand all other parts are fine and dandy but just the main structural frame completely shattered. only a small amount of the cleaner had leaked into the model.   I need to know where i can order some replacement parts, or if i can even order them at all :("
Gunpla,3e1jwi,Cowvine,3,Tue Jul 21 06:30:57 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in another thread yesterday.   if you fill out this form ( https://gginfinite.com/help.php?section=contactus&mode=update ) with the kit, with the part number and runner information. They will e-mail you a price quote. They ship you the part after they've confirmed you've paid. It's about 5 dollars but if you get more than 5 pieces you get a discount. (Which will help you out since your inner frame exploded)   You can also go through bluefin, there are tutorials on the right side for finding out how.  Good luck, finding your replacement parts and I'm sorry that this happened to you. Hopefully you can get it fixed!"

Gunpla,3e3so9,berserkalucard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"You dont need a mask if you're hand painting. For priming/topcoating you can get away with not using a mask if you do it outside or in a well ventilated area for short periods of time.  But if you decide to airbrush, a 3M R95 (paper mask) works fine for acrylics. You'll need a better mask with filters if you decide to use lacquers"
Gunpla,3e3so9,SkeletalGroover,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I'll hold off on a respirator for now. Would you say its worth getting into airbrushing early, or maybe after I've completed a few kits and become a bit more confident"
Gunpla,3e3so9,cheese61292,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"The Tamiya spray primer is lacquer based which means you want to get a respirator with P100 filters.  For Tamiya acrylics, you don't need to use a respirator as long as you are in a well ventilated area as they are only thinning with alcohol. So the fumes are not damaging unless consumed in large doses. A Window with a fan sucking air outside is generally adequate."
Gunpla,3e3so9,cheese61292,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"I think I'll wait a bit before getting a respirator, I'll just try and get a good ventilated area for priming/topcoating."
Gunpla,3e3so9,cheese61292,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't advise waiting. You should always air on the side of caution.   As for getting into airbrushing, it's always worth to get in early. The cost of model paints & primers is high. Especially when it comes to spray cans. Like wise, you'll end up using less paint with an airbrush than you will by applying it by hand."

Gunpla,3e2e98,cheese61292,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:08 2015 UTC,I just use an Xacto knife and change out the blades as needed. Cut on a hard surface and not a cutting mat since it will just push and deform the metal. Also don't use the extreme tip of the blade because any pressure and it is sure to snap and fly off. I've found some of the Metal Earth/IconX kits to be thicker than the others so some might require more effort.
Gunpla,3e14py,Falcoteer,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"Paint is a bit thick, but it't not terrible. Thin your paints next time and it'll look great.  BTW not a bad choice for a 1st Gundam kit."

Gunpla,3e36r3,chrysamere,4,Tue Jul 21 16:37:46 2015 UTC,Might just need a little sanding. If you can't buff it out then you'll need to paint. What piece is this?
Gunpla,3e36r3,MarioAngel87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:13 2015 UTC,It is the Amuro Ray action base included with Nu Gundam Ver. Ka.
Gunpla,3e36r3,MarioAngel87,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"I would sand it down and spray paint it. Its easy to have issues with larger pieces like this like scratches and weird ""textures"" in the plastic itself so I've been getting used to seeing larger pieces and assuming I am painting."
Gunpla,3e36r3,mrliquidjesus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:16 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the scratches and minor gashes?   Sand it with a fine grit (800-1000). Hopefully that levels it off. Hit it with your favorite semigloss/satin black paint. Spray can/ airbrush etc.
Gunpla,3e36r3,YuriusFarrence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:27 2015 UTC,Either do Progressive Sanding on it via 800 > 1k > 1.5k > 2k.  You can also paint it easily or simply sand it a bit then use a top coat flat matte.
Gunpla,3e36r3,Andtheherois,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:10 2015 UTC,Hit it with 800-1200 sandpaper and buff it with a denim cloth. It'll be good as new.

I've repainted my build with standard colors still in WIP but the armor fitting is very tight and expanding the armor has caused major scratches to the finish. I'm just going to keep mine in closed hatch mode.
Gunpla,3e179f,holocause,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:19 2015 UTC,its still a work in progress. I'm planning to use a matte lacquer as the final top coat and hopefully it will be strong enough to keep the paint from chipping. I'm planning to do some weathering too so we'll see once everything is done.

I got it on Amazon for $9, and decided to use it as practice for a lot of different techniques. Some were a hit, but others were ended up a little lackluster. Admittedly, I like how it looks in pictures a little more than on my shelf; maybe that's because I don't notice some of the messed-up textures from the photos.  The two big new techniques I used were weathering/paint chipping and using a flat topcoat. Before this, I've used Future or I've neglected to topcoat my kits at all (something I probably won't be doing anytime again in the near future). I ran into problems on both these fronts, but admittedly the end result (mostly) makes up for that-- I'm happy with the way the weathered look turned out, even if it's a bit stronger than others might use."

I remember when we had maybe two or three new topics a day, now it's closer to twenty.   As a result, we get a lot of new people talking about their first models. We all have to learn at some point, and breaking or losing pieces, sadly, is part of that. I imagine most of us have had that surprise moment where you clip the last link between the part and the sprue, and the force of this pings the part off into the distance. Don't we all hold small parts while cutting them now? Some bits are fragile, some fall off because the fit isn't great, some of us are just careless.

Likewise if you get way back from the car and try to wash it with low pressure the water doesn't even get there, so you need more pressure.""  Basic rule of thumb - the thicker your paint and the farther away you spray from, the more air pressure you need. The thinner then paint and the closer you are to the surface, the less pressure you need."
Gunpla,3dy479,Candalos,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:41 2015 UTC,"High PSI (20 up), more paint comes out with every trigger press. Paint also dries faster as you are bombarding the pigment with more air once it is expelled. Great if you want to cover a large surface area like a huge propellant tank in quick swipes. Be careful though as if you put too high PSI and spray from too far away, paint will start to dry and bead before it fully comes into contact with your plastic. The result of which is you end up with paint dust flecks that look like powder on your kit.   Low PSI (10-15), less force is exerted on the paint pigments thus they are less agitated once expelled resulting in a much more 'wet' outcome once it reaches your plastic. Good if you want to come in close on your models for precision paint work (an inch or less away) and you want to draw your paint onto your kits like for panel pre-shading. You have more control of your paintflow and where it goes. Downfall of low PSI is it will take longer to fully cover large sections of model. You also need to be fluid with your brush strokes, leave the ab pointing in one area for too long and you end up with a pool of wet paint that starts to web away from the center. So be aware of your trigger management.   Ofcourse, results will still vary depending on the quality and type of your airbrush, as well as your paints."
Gunpla,3dx2ou,redryder74,11,Mon Jul 20 06:33:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bad tip because it shouldn't be a problem in the first place. The waterslide should not be soaked in water, especially not to the point where it separates from the paper. There should have been no reason to pick up the raw decal floating in water.   Grab decal (still on backing) with tweezers Dunk decal in water and immediately take it out of the water Wait 10-20 seconds. The surface tension of the water causes it to stick to the decal paper even though you took it out immediately Use toothpick or brush to slide the decal unto the model"
Gunpla,3dx2ou,razorconcepts,4,Mon Jul 20 06:46:00 2015 UTC,"Really? I've had decals not separating from the backing paper unless I leave them in water for 20s or more. I've also had decals tear while trying to brush them off the paper onto the model. Admittedly those were 3rd party decals and not Bandai, so they were extremely thin to start with.   I've never had issues with Bandai decals but have had difficulties with Samueldecal tearing easily."
Gunpla,3dx2ou,CivilC,3,Mon Jul 20 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"razorconcepts' experience with decals mirrors mine. as long as they're in the water for a max of 3 seconds and you wait half a minute, you shouldn't have problems and I've used 3rd party decals as well.   It's not a bad tip, but a bit more complicated and risky depending on the type of decal you're dealing with (very complex shapes, for example)."
Gunpla,3dx2ou,Candalos,2,Mon Jul 20 07:31:42 2015 UTC,Thanks both for your tips. I'll try that next time and not leave my decals in the water for so long.
Gunpla,3dx2ou,holocause,3,Mon Jul 20 07:37:13 2015 UTC,"Try using warm water - I find it helps over just cold tap water. Also, remember that once out of the waterbath the decal is still loosening it's adhesive due to the moisture. As long as it's kept moist, you shouldn't need to submerge it completely in water, just takes some patience."
Gunpla,3dx2ou,Pachurick,3,Mon Jul 20 11:09:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed with other's opinion. I find keeping the decal immersed in water leads to more trouble as once the decal separates from the sheet in a tub of water, it is harder to get a hold of and you run the risk of it flipping in itself and you loose track of which the adhesive side is up. Simply dipping the decal sheet in water and making sure the backing get's wet is enough for the decal to start doing it's work. There's a reason the backing paper is colored the way it is, the paper changes to a darker color when soaked in water. Once the paper changes to the appropriate color, you know it's enough to make the adhesion effective."

Cant exactly describe the shade when its good to go, but after 2 or so decals, you quickly find that sweet spot color."

Check the side bar there should be a tutorial on panel lining if the links aren't all dead. We've all got to start somewhere so don't worry.  Edit: looking closer, did you use a pencil? it looks like you did panel line but very faintly I think"
Gunpla,3dwdeg,CrimsonRavenXVII,2,Mon Jul 20 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"It's all good, I did use a marker but I tried to make the lines as light as possible by rubbing off a lot of the excess.  Personally I don't really like the way it looks with really thick lines.    I did watch a tutorial video but I'm not sure I have the hang of it yet.  I'll check out the one in the sidebar, thanks!"
Gunpla,3dwdeg,CrimsonRavenXVII,4,Mon Jul 20 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"Mmm, if you want them to be light id reommend using a grey marker, and then black for the gun,  there's always a panel wash how much you want to panel line is up to you some like it subtle, others try to get into every little crevice or groove they can. Paneling is pretty much up to the maker in terms of aesthetics. There are plenty of pens with really fine points if the thickness  isn't to your liking just hit up Google. Keep it up though!"
Gunpla,3dwdeg,Candalos,4,Mon Jul 20 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"In regards to the panel lining it's ok for a first attempt - as previously mentioned, grey is probably the way to go if your not a fan of the stark black look. However black has it's uses especially on darker colors and on faceplates. I can also see you may have had issue wiping away, since some of the lines are uneven - one trick I can put out is to run your hobby knife or scribing tool along the edges where you wish to panel line to create a shallow trench for the wash to flow in. This'll keep your lines nice and clean and give you an easier clean-up.  That being said, to be perfectly honest - there are other areas I would recommend you work on first before panel lining - nub removal - very obvious ones on the tip of the gun, eyepiece of the gun, shoulder plate and shield. Also on the ammo clip on top of the gun - obvious sanding spot there :P"
Gunpla,3dwdeg,thecompunction,4,Mon Jul 20 07:14:11 2015 UTC,"Nice job on the panel lines on the arms, tubes, and hands (not sure if you panel lined anything outside of that). Just a suggestion, but you could also panel line the gun c:"

Gunpla,3dyq53,crazyjeffy,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking to improve. if it's the paint application and surface, then stripping would be necessary.

Gunpla,3dy1kj,CarrotCatCake,5,Mon Jul 20 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is a tough one because they fill such a different collectors niche.   looks: Tallgeese. its got so much going on, with the articulated vernier backpack, the badass dober gun and the incredibly unique design.   Build: Tallgeese. agian, due to the unique design you have more to look forward to and be surprised by in the build.  Construction/Design: Zaku! tho i havnet built the 2.0. it appears to be very solid. the 2.0 hands are fully articulated, the monoeye moves behind the visor. He is incredibly flexible for a chunky suit.  The Tallgeese is plagued by many faults, not really being able to hold the gun, the weak waist, the bad balance, the ankle cuffs falling off, wing MG hands suck! and he practically needs a action base  Verdict: Get the Tallgeese if you want a Wing Collection necessity that's a really cool looking, but very finnicky model that's very difficult to pose.  Get the Zaku if you want the best version of a Classic mobile suit with excellent articulation and solid construction."
Gunpla,3dy1kj,wjapple,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"Not an expert opinion but looking at it monetarily I'd say go with the tallgeese since the Zaku is being produced in new variations constantly but the tallgeese only has the one version right now. I'd personally hate to miss the tallgeese and see its price go up with zakus being readily available later on. However if we're going on looks and final product only, I prefer the harder lines of a zaku. The tallgeese is a pretty build but I also feel like there are more display options on the Zaku given that through the years they've wielded almost every weapon and been in every combat situation imaginable. Feels like a more versatile kit for posing and displays in my opinion."

Gunpla,3dwaro,Gaius_Grahcci,2,Mon Jul 20 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"Not a real fan of the krylon because its too viscous, like water almost and you need to be extra careful when spraying and its too easy to screw up with. Tamiya makes a good primer, adheres well with an even coat but its a little more expensive and 180ml aint much but it'll last a few HG's, but sadly they dont make a black primer.   The difference between primer and paint isn't very much. And you can totally use primer as a final coat, I'll sometimes use some of my black tamiya paint as a primer if I need to or vice versa with my white primer. The primer you linked will work just fine."
Gunpla,3dwaro,CrimsonRavenXVII,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:23 2015 UTC,you mean not viscous enough?
Gunpla,3dwaro,Wontons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:35:54 2015 UTC,"No its too viscous, so it comes off a little watery which we don't want when painting leading to uneven coats"
Gunpla,3dwaro,CrimsonRavenXVII,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:00:36 2015 UTC,I like krylon because its semi-cheap for a huge bottle and the paint comes out very even. but it does spray thicker than i would like.  the only other primer I've tried is Alclad ii white primer and its... ok. I kept getting clumps building up on my needle and it wasn't very consistent at spraying smoothly. i would have rough patches on my pieces.   planning to try vallejo paint next time
Gunpla,3dwaro,metalhawj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:15:23 2015 UTC,"I would caution against vallejo, since it's a polyurethaneprimer it dries to a rubbery consistency and cannot be sanded down. However, if you don't plan on sanding then it's a very nice primer, works great on tabletop figures.like warhammer"
Gunpla,3dwaro,wjapple,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:05:43 2015 UTC,I swear by the Rustoleum painters touch gray primer...it lays smooth filing in imperfections and you can sand it... also works for preshadding when I am painting white pieces

Its a bit pricey to buy from him, but he usually gives around 15% - 30% off depending on his mood and how frequently you buy from his shop (personally speaking). GP is very much worth due to their variety and decent pricing. Their stuff is cheaper on-site than online. Plus, after $150 in purchases you get 15% off your next purchase (punch-card system).

I have a friend who works at Hobbietat and they sell gunpla there but I've never bought anything from them. They seem to get shipments about every other week but selection is still somewhat limited. MiniQ is another rather small shop in Aiea that also sells gunpla but its marked up quite a bit from stuff you'd get even from Amazon and their selection is smaller than Hobbietat. Hobby Co has a selection similar to MiniQ but they also have Tamiya paints. But they're also more oriented towards model boats and planes and stuff.

My advice is if you're doing layers, for example i had to do blue onto of silver, is to make sure the paint fully cures before you start painting over it. that way if you mess up, just take a q-tip with a bit of thinner on it and gently wipe away the mess. If you do it to hard you might wipe away the underlying layers. I didn't use primer, so i didn't have to worry too much about accidentally scraping that off. if you do end up messing up, I think wiping the paint off with paint thinner and starting over is one way to fix a really bad mistake.   all in all, just go at a very comfortable and slow pace and take your time, it lessens the mistakes you make. and wait maybe an hour or two between coats."
Gunpla,3dvyq9,l4zyhero,3,Mon Jul 20 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"How to completely strip your piece:  Soak parts in 91% Alcohol for 20-30mins (longer when using 70%). Take parts out and the paint will peel off using your fingers, use a toothbrush for crevices and panel lines. Repeat if necessary.  Causes no damage to Gunpla plastic.  Edit: Works on all types of paints no matter the layers."

Gunpla,3dvqtz,rg90184,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:41 2015 UTC,I haven't had any issues with holding weapons.  Maybe just the shield though figured out I have a certain piece the other way around so that there's a hole on the arm but not locking into.  A bit better now but it can't hold the arm up with the shield+gun.  Are you using the little nubs that pop out?    What I also found is how brittle it's become after a top coat (Krylon matte finish).  Almost everytime I try to move the thing something falls off or breaks off.  I find myself constantly gluing pieces back together.  Definitely a kit I've developed a love/hate relationship with.
Gunpla,3dtk1p,redryder74,6,Sun Jul 19 09:02:47 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's pretty boring. Worth it once the nub is gone, but still just tedious and boring.  I also listen to music and podcasts while sanding nubs."

It becomes a good rotation, then by the time I'm done cutting everything out and organizing by what part of the gunpla (chest, left arm, right arm, waist, right leg, left leg, head, weapons ect) I can get started on assembly/seam removal/touch up painting. I love my rotation method."
Gunpla,3dtk1p,rg90184,3,Sun Jul 19 22:07:43 2015 UTC,"I just cut mine away with an Xacto knife, unless it's an exceptionally large nub, or one in a tricky place. Goes pretty fast, and ends up with a very smooth surface and minimal stressing. The trick is going from both sides, and shaving small layers off once you get close to the part.  On the other hand I find panel lining and seam cleanup to be amazingly tedious. Still do it though, because it makes the kit so much nicer."

Gunpla,3dup3j,VentureGunpla,2,Sun Jul 19 21:52:03 2015 UTC,"Spaz stick is very similar to alclad.   You prime regularly then use a gloss black base, then your alclad or spaz stix. The chrome paint is very very thin and relies on the black gloss to be shiny to give it its reflective properties. The shinier and smoother your black the better the chrome looks.   Graphite powders such as MGM and Kosutte Gin San uses the same properties of a gloss black base. After the black base, powder is ""buffed"" on until there's a thin layer. The results of these are more delicate than paint but often looks more convincing but it's much darker than a standard chrome from spaz or alclad. Painting candy colors over it will lose a lot more shine than a chrome paint but it can be done."

If I usually really put a lot of work painting and making a kit look the best I can, what would I do with this one? Just panel line and topcoat?

I wish I had the mounts for the funnels, but the wings look pretty good anyway. May or may not add decals;me and waterslides have a rough history. Unfortunately, this one won't be joining the collection since it's a gift for someone else, but I had a good time making it."

Gunpla,3dtcnn,Beginning_Gunpla,2,Sun Jul 19 13:50:02 2015 UTC,Thanks. It actually seems pretty well detailed for a heavy grade. It also has some pretty good posablility and detail to the kit.
Gunpla,3duaic,AdmiralAntz,3,Sun Jul 19 15:22:15 2015 UTC,When I panel lined it was less than an hour and it was good to go for  a top coat. To completely cure sorry I don't exactly know. I do know that it takes  longer for larger pools of paint to dry though.
Gunpla,3duaic,tmluna01,2,Sun Jul 19 16:07:22 2015 UTC,It takes roughly 48 hours for enamels to fully cure.

They will e-mail you a price quote and then you pay via paypal. They ship you the part after they've confirmed you've paid. It's about 5 dollars but if you get more than 5 pieces you get a discount.  You can also go through bluefin, there are tutorials on the right side for finding out how.   Good luck, finding your replacement part!"

Gunpla,3droan,TwoHeadedPanthr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, get yourself a good hobby knife and also a set of sanding sticks or some various grades of sandpaper and some tongue depressors. The one thing I learned myself is that when shaving the nubs down close on colored plastic you can still get white edges or in the middle, so I rubbed then pretty hard with my fingernails you can sometimes get the color to blend."

Gunpla,3droan,SpaghettiJustice,2,Sun Jul 19 04:21:21 2015 UTC,Could you use a ballpoint pen to line them? I was thinking about it while I was building but I wasn't sure.
Gunpla,3dt69o,willhtun,2,Sun Jul 19 05:23:29 2015 UTC,"It will lead to discoloration but it will take a long time for that to happen.   If you want to protect your models, then you can get a topcoat with UV Protection like Mr Super Clear UV Cut."
Gunpla,3dt69o,cheese61292,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:50:28 2015 UTC,"It honestly depends on the plastic mix. With luck, it'll take a while. If it's a poor plastic mix, it can happen in days. I'm not entirely sure if a UV protection clear-coat alone is actually enough to prevent it from happening, but it certainly won't hurt.  My understanding is that it's actually the movement of chemical elements in the plastic (put in there to make it less flammable) that discolor the plastic over time by leeching to the surface when excited by UV, heat, and other environmental factors, not all of which can be prevented. Ultimately, since it's almost impossible to prevent some exposure to UV, the only long term solution is to paint the kits and not have visible plastic to discolor at all, but that's obviously not an option for everyone.  It's more prevalent in ABS plastic than polystyrene, but Bandai's using more and more ABS plastic all the time so that doesn't help much, and AFAIK polystyrene is still vulnerable to it, with the added bonus of also becoming more brittle over time with exposure. If possible, it really is best to not have it in a position with direct sunlight ever."
Gunpla,3dq17r,CaptainBenza,8,Sat Jul 18 09:29:50 2015 UTC,I like all the seed ones. They match the MS well
Gunpla,3dq17r,srsreflex,2,Sat Jul 18 09:45:57 2015 UTC,I agree. Justice and Buster have my interest the most-
Gunpla,3dq17r,Pachurick,2,Sat Jul 18 10:26:10 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to go with the duel. I might mess with the orange a bit to make it asymmetrical like the assault shroud. I'll also probably put some missle pods on there and turn the ""nose"" on the backpack into a long vertical thruster to further replicate the assault shroud."
Gunpla,3dq17r,TalonX273,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"For the Duel colours, I would suggest a less saturated shade of orange for the accents. As for the white, giving it a slight greyish-blue hue would make it blend a little better with the rest of the parts."

You've got a good eye for representing one colour scheme on a totally different suit.    I think the ones which break up the colours more are going to work best. Legend and Aegis for example are just going to look like blocks of red or grey with highlights. Buster, Reborns or Duel are I think the best choices from your selection to bring out detail in the model."
Gunpla,3dq17r,whattheboo,2,Sat Jul 18 09:45:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm impressed, most of the color schemes look pretty close to the actual suits. Really goes to show that a suit is defined by its colors!"

Gunpla,3dq17r,Rape_The_Willing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:55:03 2015 UTC,I find that in those situations you can scribe a panel line where you want the colors to separate. That way it looks less like one multi-colored part and more like two different colored panels side by side.
Gunpla,3dq17r,SushiBento,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:39:10 2015 UTC,"I'm glad people are liking my color schemes. I'm still a beginner painter, but that doesn't stop the ideas. I put a good deal of effort into seeing how I can mesh the patterns of the customized MS with the patterns and colors of the inspired MS. I tend to use lineart from here and then touch it up a bit to make switching between colors faster/easier/more accurate...so if anyone ever wants those templates or wants me to help make some for them feel free to ask."

Gunpla,3dssjf,Splosion_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"If this is in regards to a polycap or some other plastic to rubber connection, there are two ways to fix this. The more permanent option is to add a touch of super glue to the plastic and let it dry. This will add a bit more thickness to it and make the joint tighter. The less permanent way would be to get clear packing tape, especially the thicker kind. Cut a small strip of it and place it over the plastic. It will stay in place for a long time and can still be easily removed if desired. Either way works very well"

Nail polish, paint, and future all wear down faster than the plastic, and since the problem originally is usually either an overly loose or worn out plastic connection that's lost friction, using something softer than the plastic itself is only going to work for a little while."

Gunpla,3dsm8k,josh4406,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:00 2015 UTC,"Not just recently, but personally I think a recent mMG that is coming out is the Amazing Red Warrior from BFT. I think its a perfect opportunity for painting as its simplistic style makes me want to do some creative stuff on that kit!. Although I do need to subdue my habit of always braking off small stuff on EVERY kit that i've done so far :(."
Gunpla,3dsm8k,Koushiro_Izumi,2,Sun Jul 19 02:02:09 2015 UTC,i just bought the double x MG and just from looking at the box it looks like it is going to be an amazing kit to build!

Gunpla,3dsm8k,froogle72,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"Both the Fenice and the turn x are good picks. You could grab the more recent hyaku shiki 2.0. They are all great builds. However if your interested in some older mgs that are cool and have great technology, you could grab the turn A, they really went all out for this kit. If you don't mind the look of a mustache Gundam. The God Gundam would be another good choice, as it revolutionized the inner frame at the time.   I built him recently, and he holds up pretty well to newer master grades, however you do need to use screws. I hope you find a good mg!"
Gunpla,3drgg5,Plamobot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:12:26 2015 UTC,"It's for the MG Wing Gundam Zero Custom; just need one of the smaller text gray ""Colonies Liberation Organization"" dry transfers. :(  (I've looked at third party decals, but those are black, not gray, and aren't as sharp.)"
Gunpla,3drgg5,XTC-FTW,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:21 2015 UTC,lol try putting on the dry transfers backwards so the decals is facing you and gets transferred to the tape...
Gunpla,3drgg5,CivilC,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"Bad idea, the decal probably won't transfer 100% and look really bad. Unless you've tried this with amazing results, in which that'd be interesting lol"
Gunpla,3drgg5,XTC-FTW,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:41:10 2015 UTC,I'm saying I put the decal backwards so it rubbed against the surface towards me rather than the plastic. Awful lol
Gunpla,3drgg5,phonebooksamurai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:10:17 2015 UTC,I've done this.  It worked well.
Gunpla,3drgg5,XTC-FTW,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:43:18 2015 UTC,You rubbed the decal onto the tape and not the plastic too?
Gunpla,3drgg5,phonebooksamurai,3,Sun Jul 19 00:10:47 2015 UTC,"I put the tape on the wrong side of the decal by accident.  Luckily I use clear tape, not the cloudy tradional Scotch tape.  I put if on as if it was a sticker and you cant really see it unless you know what your looking at, its no different then if it was a sticker."

Gunpla,3drg9j,AdmiralAntz,2,Sat Jul 18 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"My best guess would be to use flock, like you sometimes see on trees in dioramas, in a similar shade to what you are looking for. Don't know if there's another way to do it, but that's one that I can think of."
Gunpla,3drg9j,translego1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Lightly brush on adhesive to the areas you want covered in algae, then coat it with a mixture of mostly fine grain sand or flocking and a small amount of medium grain sand or flocking. Once it dries and you brush the excess off coat it with a dark green and give it a pass or two with a heavy drybrush of light green."
Gunpla,3drg9j,Chamomileable,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:14:25 2015 UTC,"To add to all the ideas here, get some Mr. Surfacer 500 or thinned solvent based putty, and dab it onto some areas to get a corroded barnacle-encrusted texture going."
Gunpla,3drg9j,jwaldo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:58:18 2015 UTC,Weathering pigments might help to make it look like it's been sitting at the bottom of the sea for a long time.  Vallejo and Tamiya make some really nice ones. Vallejo also has this thing that looks like moss/algae.
Gunpla,3drg9j,randomking0x70,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:53:40 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd do a hairspray technique, with the bottom layer being the correct color of the Hygogg, and the top layer being the algae green, and then brush through the algae green to reveal some of the ""native"" blue beneath.  That way there's clearly a sense of the green being a layer on top of the blue.    Then for thicker segments that you want to have real depth, maybe get thicker bits of your green paint, (unthinned, and maybe let some of the thinner that's in the paint itself dry off before starting), and then brush it on in slightly thicker clumps.  Make sure you get a texture, but don't let it get too clumpy, or it will lose the effect and just look like thick paint.  Top off the effect with some flock, as u/translego1 suggested, and if you want seaweed effects, maybe get some green twist-ties, and cut out the green edges into sharper, leaf shapes.  These you can then position how you like; hanging straight down from the arms and such if you want it looking like it's just been pulled out of the water, or even angled upward if you want it to look like it's still underwater and the seaweed is flowing in the current.    EDIT:  By the way, this is an amazing idea for the Hygogg, and you've inspired me to probably do something very similar.  Thank you for sharing this."
Gunpla,3drg9j,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:59:36 2015 UTC,What is the hairspray technique? And thanks :)
Gunpla,3drg9j,sdwoodchuck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"Here is one good tutorial, though Google can lead you to dozens more.    Usually it's done to give the effect of scraped off paint, or parts being rusted through.  In the case of the Hygogg, I think the base color should be its painted color, and the top layer should be the algae green, so that you can scrape through it on parts leaving traces of it, while giving the genuine impression that it is a layer on top of the armor."
Gunpla,3drg5y,mllacsamana,3,Sat Jul 18 19:09:52 2015 UTC,Just use one of the generic U-shaped adapters the action base comes with. Those work fine.
Gunpla,3drg5y,vgambit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:56:25 2015 UTC,Action base 2 doesn't come with the RG adapter.  But if you do need an action base for your RG SF without an adapter you can use this then if you prefer using the standard action base 2 and need that adapter then buy more RG kits and use the adapter for the kits you don't need to be on an action base.  I have a lot of RG kits so I have a lot of spare action base adapters.
Gunpla,3drdbm,Vicer0yal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"Military style gunpla?  Check the HGUC GM Custom, HGUC Jegan, HGUC Jegan Ecoas, HGUC Geara Zulu."
Gunpla,3drdbm,YuriusFarrence,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the Geara Zulu looks amazing and I generally don't like the Zaku design. I wish there were some non-Gundam suits from Wing, like the Leo or Mercury I think it's called? (the space one with the disks)"
Gunpla,3drdbm,YuriusFarrence,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yep but those are old and bad kits. Some new ones that are out are the ones I've mentioned but there's actually a lot but depends on your preference.  Check HGUC Zeta Plus UC, HGUC Loto Twin Set, HGUC Gundam Ez8, HGBF Ez-SR"
Gunpla,3drdbm,YuriusFarrence,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"The Zeta plus looks pretty cool, wtf is with the Loto though, it's like something from armored core mixed with a transformer >.>, thanks for the recommends"
Gunpla,3drdbm,NeonLightIllusion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:34:04 2015 UTC,The Loto twin set is a UC unit that was not developed by Anaheim but by SNRI instead.  That's why its small but it was made to be a newer version of a Guntank that's why it requires multiple pilots to operate.
Gunpla,3drdbm,abugoy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"The most realistic Gunpla available is probably the HG Guntank Origins version. It's a pretty nice looking kit. Also, if you like the Z'Gok E, you might enjoy the Hygogg. The Kampfer is also another good option, as is the Loto Twin set."

I'm so upset, I really liked this gundam and it would have ruined it for me if not for how much I like the color scheme and the gundam itself. I can overlook it missing part of its face. I'm debating on whether I should put decals on it or not, idk if it will look better or worse with decals that are not waterslide.  Comments and criticism?"
Gunpla,3dp5sa,CivilC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"RG models aren't that expensive and with the work put in you can order another to replace missing parts, you could even order from a cheaper HG kit and find a way to make it fit."
Gunpla,3dp5sa,andyroid42,2,Sat Jul 18 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"Imo if you put that much work into your kit, you should try your best to find waterslides for it. However, if you don't want to go through that trouble, the RG sticker decals are pretty good for what they are."
Gunpla,3dp5sa,CR4CK3RW0LF,2,Sat Jul 18 03:37:27 2015 UTC,"Take a tiny piece of pla-plate, cut a section that will fit the hole, and then cut out the middle in a jagged up and down pattern to give him some jack-o-lantern style teeth.  http://puu.sh/j3xEO/a987aa0f6d.jpg"
