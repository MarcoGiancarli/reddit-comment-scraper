Edmonton,3e4eht,Vinsher,15,Tue Jul 21 21:37:42 2015 UTC,Good riddance. Anyone who exploits sick children and threatens to take it out on them among other things  if he doesn't get what he wants like he tried to do shouldn't be on a public board.
Edmonton,3e4eht,AntonBanton,10,Tue Jul 21 23:16:11 2015 UTC,He should not have voiced his opinion publicly the way he did while he was on the board of a public university. He was appointed by politicians and couldn't have had an unbiased view. It's disgusting what he and the group of CEOs did by trying to influence voters by suggesting that businesses wouldn't support the Stollery anymore. I'm glad he'll be gone. Hopefully more of the UofA board will go since they supported his appointment after his comments.
Edmonton,3e3z6n,leafyleafygreens,13,Tue Jul 21 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"Having just been in calgary for sled island and seeing the variety of small, seemingly successful venues they have, I think that live music can't be the number one draw. You need to serve food and you need a welcoming ambience that will draw people even when there isn't a band playing. Something like the original sidetrack comes to mind.   While I love the Wunderbar and have seen many phenomenal bands there it wouldn't be my top choice (or top 10 choice) of places to go hang out with friends, especially people who aren't into that kind of thing because it is filthy, smells, they are often out of beer and they are rarely open it there isn't a band and even then it is too small and loud to have a conversation."

Ask the seller for the serial number then check on that site or call your local police department to get it checked.

My friends are always getting me to hunt down bikes for them on Kijiji, and I've bought about 10 in the past 3 years. I find you get the most bang for your buck if you're willing to spend about $400 dollars or more- in that range you find a lot of good bikes that someone with a fleeting inclination to take up cycling bought 3 years ago for $1000+ and only used a few times.

If you order early enough in the day things may even show up at your place the next day, even with the least expensive shipping option.  Digikey, while based out of the US, lists the prices in Canadian dollars and builds the customs fees into the prices so you won't get any nasty surprises.  They ship really quickly and cheaply too.  They carry stuff from SparkFun and Adafruit as well, so you can get those products and take advantage of Digikey's low shipping costs."

It wouldn't hurt to call their non-emergency line and ask. They might be able to give you a better answer than 311.   Are you sure it's oil and coolant not oil and condensation from the A/C? The oil is obviously not cool but with some A/C systems it can look like the vehicle is leaking a ton of coolant or something when it's just water. You might want to make it clear that you're sure it's not A/C condensation because I wouldn't be surprised if they get a number of calls about leaking fluids that turn out to be condensation.
Edmonton,3e101c,AntonBanton,5,Tue Jul 21 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"Condensation doesn't stick around for a month... So yes I am quite sure... The back film is oil and the coolant floats on top of it.

Edmonton,3dyy4c,45Monkey,16,Mon Jul 20 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, just wanted to say good on you for looking to provide a better life for both yourself as well as your son.  Years ago, when I was in university myself, I was an employment counsellor for an aboriginal training organisation. Basically, we helped people who were either under employed or facing a career change find a new path.  First off, the Government of Alberta has a great tool called ALIS or the Alberta Learning Information Service. It will allow you to look up various careers with accompanying training requirements, likely salary ranges as well as career trends (i.e. is this an emerging field or something that is on the decline). Additionally this is new from the last time I looked here, but there is also a self-guided tool to walk you through the career choice process. It looks pretty decent. It also looks like you can contact a career advisor (which from what I remember are free of charge) at 780-422-4266  As for funding options, unfortunately, I only know of the aboriginal funding options available to students. With that, it might be hard to find a lot of funding mechanisms. For instance, the Alberta Works program offers funding for low-income Albertans to maintain employment or find new employment after being laid off. Knowing what I know of how funding is allocated in similar programs, career changes (for valid reasons such as yourself) are typically not funded as it is a ""choice"" in that respect in the eyes of government. Being a journeyman electrician, I am pretty sure there is the ability to access EI funding much like you may have done while going through your apprenticeship. That process may vary and you're likely better off at contacting that number above and talk to someone who deals with this on a daily basis.  Hopefully, this is of some assistance. It's been six or seven years since I did this work so some information might not be as relevant as it once was. I'll be around if you have any other questions and if that doesn't work, feel free to message me as well.  Best of luck!"

Edmonton,3dyy4c,theoreoman,4,Mon Jul 20 19:42:34 2015 UTC,I ended up setting the bar pretty low in high school so I would still have to do some upgrading but this actually seems like a really good option. Thank you stranger.
Edmonton,3dyy4c,kurelek,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"Another thing with PE is that it is very difficult to get into the program, it's the most competitive program NAIT and SAIT offer, something like 600-800 applicants a year for 120 or so seats, high school average I think needs to be around 85%, but you can get there with upgrading.  Things are also very quiet for PE right now, not a lot of places hiring. The nice thing with it though is that it isn't contract based and PE are the last to be laid off as they operate the plant until the plant itself is shut down.  It's also one of the highest paying jobs in Alberta (70-100k in town right out of school, 150k+ up north on a FIFO) and at the same time provides very consistent working hours and lots of applications (you can live in the city and work manufacturing / building operation / hospital and be home every night or go elsewhere and work in power plants, oil extraction, etc.).  I'm not trying to dissuade you I'm just giving you some realistic expectations, I'm not sure what schooling you are planning but honestly everything is getting hit hard right now because of the low oil, there was a time an engineering degree meant instant employment but right now engineers are being laid off from firms left right and center. Even seemingly unrelated jobs like IT are getting hit hard because goddamn everything in Alberta centers around oil.  I would almost say if you really wanted consistency pack up and move out to Ontario or something where you don't have to worry about oil fluctuating up and down, but that's pretty extreme and in a few years when the oil is back up you'll be back here anyway. Electrician is one of the most stable jobs in Alberta it's just shitty right now because of the downturn."
Edmonton,3dyy4c,peeflar,4,Tue Jul 21 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be negative but here's what I have learnt.  I took engineering at the u of a and did my 4 year degree and the competitive acceptance average is about 83-85% of your high school marks in chem, math, calculus, physics and English. I graduated in 2012 worked and am now unemployed because of the slowdown.  But Average starting salary for that degree is around 70k. It's doable but would be very difficult to work and support yourself full time because of the course load   Another option is power engineering, basically through nait, 2 options on how to complete it either a one year or 2 year program.  The other option is 2 $600 online courses plus I think $600 in books and a $4000 optional power lab. Lots of jobs but most of them are out of town and the jibs in town are always in high demand and many low paying.  I'm doing this right now to diversify while I look for work   But honestly I think that working as an electrician and having something is already more superior than starting from Scratch.  Maybe looking around at other companies who can give you more stable hours if that's even possible."

Edmonton,3dyy4c,kneecapper,4,Mon Jul 20 18:14:10 2015 UTC,The world needs electricians. Likely not the answer you are looking for but I think you already have a good trade with great future and well payed too. I would try to diversify your income streams so you are not so reliant on income from employment. Live on as little as possible now (while still giving your son everything he needs) and start investing/saving as much as possible. In 10 years you could be sitting pretty and easily ride out any downtime. Invest in income property (especially if you're a handy guy) and invest in the markets directly or have someone else do it for you.

Investing and diversification are somethings that I try to keep on the forefront of my career/life goals but every time I seem to be getting ahead, something comes and tosses it to shambles. I could always be a bit more stringent with spending but even tho I feel the need to set up my future, a guy has to have some fun in the meantime as well."

If your experience is oilfield or you didn't learn properly during your apprenticeship program you may have a hard time finding work.  Or if you are union. Not much demand for those guys in Edmonton.   As someone also in the industry, try and expand your knowledge at every project you work on.   If you don't want to work on the tools, try sales or estimating.   The pay will be close to a journeyman electrician and many companies will train you with the background you already have."
Edmonton,3dyy4c,Sickify,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"My background is mainly commercial with some residential, industrial, and mod work thrown in. I was never part of the union and I have done relatively little in the oilfield district. I have mainly found employment in smaller companies in town but would gladly work in a larger company if that led to a more constant work schedule."
Edmonton,3dyy4c,lsadiner,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion is that the smaller companies have more stable work. To the larger companies you are just employee #xxx.  However, if you need to miss a day because of your kid, larger companies have more guys so it won't affect them much.   Depending on your experience / availability you might be better off with a larger company. Most small companies want journeyman to be able to manage small projects."

I have run some smaller projects (two to four people) in the past and I enjoy it, much better than being an automaton anyway."
Edmonton,3dyy4c,JeffBoner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:07 2015 UTC,"My experience with the smaller places is once you are in they usually don't want to get rid of you.  Harder to lay off when you can put people and faces with names.  Personally from reading your posts I think you should stay in the trade.   I know it can be tough, especially when you have been out of work for a while. The last time I was out of work, I was off for a few weeks which making me antsy. Then I got 1 offer and 2 called and asked me to come in for an interview in one day.  After weeks of nothing.  After I got hired, I would get emails regularly about the resumes I submitted.  Sometimes it takes time for companies to look at the resumes they have.   Only other advice I have is make sure your resume is good.  Make sure your references actually will give you good references.   Add something interesting/funny to the filename of your resume.   And always better to be up front and honest on the resume and interview I think."
Edmonton,3dyy4c,batibite,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:58 2015 UTC,"Hey man, my two cents for you is this:  I was in a similar situation about five years ago. I didn't like my job at all, and wanted to upgrade to get out of it. More for personal reasons rather than having someone depending me. What I did was take night courses at metro continuing education over by Bonnie Doon. This allowed me to work during the day and get the pre requisites I needed into the program I wanted to take at NAIT. The prices were reasonable for the courses, and fit my schedule. I'm not sure what you're education is like, but this could be a good start. It would allow you to spend time with your son during the day, while still improving yourself.   Also, I'm fairly sure NAIT does offer a lot of courses that can land you a good job that's mostly done online and over correspondance. A friend of mine is working towards his power engineering diploma by doing that. The two years I spent at NAIT were probably the best thing I've ever done for myself. I took the materials engineering tech program, and I have a rewarding job that I actually enjoy. It's improved my quality of life drastically.   Lastly, as far as grants and bursaries, the only one I had received was from my former trade Union. Maybe student loans, while I don't like them, could be an option because I believe you only start paying those back when you complete your studies, and you're almost guaranteed a loan when accepted as a student. It would be a pain to pay back after, but it would allow you to get where you want to be.   And as others have said, thanks for trying to better yourself for your sons sake. I appreciate everything my dad has done for me, and I wouldn't be where I am were it not for him.   Hope that helps or might give you another lead to look into."
Edmonton,3dyy4c,unblur,2,Mon Jul 20 23:21:31 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the quality but this website might help, https://yconic.com/    Also, I would recommend going into NAIT (or whichever school you are interested in attending) and speaking to a academic/student aid/financial advisor. They should be quite in the know on what is available for scholarships or bursaries, or at the very least should be able to point you in the right direction."

I called the non emergency line to make a report, and a few hours later I called back because they hadn't showed up, and there were 137 calls posted at that time, and that was just West Division! The number of citizens to cops is probably around 50/1, and that's a low ball.

I'm talking public nuisance, minor squabbles, crazies, etc.  Also, for every pocket dial of 911 (and there are A LOT) unless the operator can call back the person that dialled, they have to be checked out too.  I say modern becasue these days folks are calling 911 when McDonalds runs out of McNuggets... Problems that didn't exist a couple decades ago.  I'm a bit biased though as my entire family is/was in law enforcement, so I know of the routine daily grind those police personel have to deal with.   I'm the only one that decided to get a real career and go with engineering.  :-)"

Edmonton,3dxpil,decadent_west,7,Tue Jul 21 17:48:31 2015 UTC,so much of what our cops do is basically shuffling homeless around from place to place. this is a huge drain on EPS resources. we should not be using our very highly paid (and skilled) police force to act as a free cab ride for the homeless to get to whatever shelter they'll be crashing in for that night. surely a roaming ETS shuttle and a pair peace officers would be better suited this kind of work.  ...of course we could fix this a lot of this problem by actually putting these people in housing.

Edmonton,3dxpil,NFN_NLN,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"hey, fuck me   Exactly, thanks for proving my point.  You accomplished nothing but tie up police from something else.  The police are a finite resource.  If they aren't at your place they could be somewhere else WHICH IS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE ARTICLE.  In other words, don't call them unless it's important.  But just to summarize this ""drug deal"":   Consensual transaction No one hurt No one in danger No arrest made (since they need to catch them red-handed) Do you really think that stopped anyone or did anything of value ... and that's IF we take your word for it that there was a even a drug deal AND that it was a hard drug like heroin     What about the time you called the cops because you thought a guy had an open container, but it was actually just an iced tea in a paper bag?"
Edmonton,3dxpil,LevSmash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"You're assuming a lot. How do you know any of those points? Also, my close friend who is a police officer was made aware of the activity long before, and recommended I call that number next time I saw the activity. Notice how he didn't say call him directly. He could be busy, or needed elsewhere whilst on duty. That would be more to your baseless accusation, calling him directly regardless of what he was doing. He said that's what the non-emergency number was for, they'll use whoever is on patrol in the area and not busy at the moment.  Bottom line is that I explained the situation very calmly on the non-emergency line, they asked questions, and responded when they had time. If they decided it wasn't worth their time, they wouldn't have sent anyone. They didn't pull officers away from like a car chase to come look. It's not my fault there weren't a bunch of people getting their heads cut off in another part of town and officers happened to be in the area when they did."

I'm planning to do another fall or winter session too before I try joining a team on the lower divisions -- so I'll fire you a message when I decide which class I'm taking again.

It was so fast and there was no control.  The second run we were all laughing like crazy people.  There was a lot of waiting before and in between runs - especially because of a medical emergency in the line before our third run - but it was totally worth it. Standing in line isn't so bad with the right company.  I think the ""triple slider"" package was perfect because there is no way I'd want to wait to go another time, 3 was great.   Well organized,  free drinking water at the epcor booth,  music playing- wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon!"

Edmonton,3dvvps,AdenosineJunky,5,Mon Jul 20 05:27:08 2015 UTC,"Love pretty much almost every aspect of this event. If there is a downside it's this: The city wouldn't upgrade the Great Divide waterfall because of concerns that fluoride was getting into the river, and endangering fish. Basically it was only ever turned on for a few hours on Canada Day. Yet a company from the US can come and run water for two days that emptied into the storm sewers.  It's like we had something that was uniquely Edmonton, closed it down because ""concerns"", and completely ignored ""concerns"" when business stepped in."
Edmonton,3dvvps,Runsamok,2,Mon Jul 20 05:49:00 2015 UTC,FYI there's more fluoride in a cup of untreated river water than what you get outta the tap.

Edmonton,3dvvps,H1deki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:36 2015 UTC,Storm water is carried back to the treatment plant for processing. The flouride / chlorine from the water in the water fall would have directly entered the river.
Edmonton,3dvvps,H1deki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:53 2015 UTC,"According to what I'm reading here storm water doesn't get transported directly to the treatment plant. If they have it wrong, then I'd appreciate you linking me to a proper source. Seriously. I'm not trying to be sarcastic. I'd really be into learning how that process of how storm water is carried back to the treatment plant."
Edmonton,3dvvps,does_thou_even_hoist,3,Mon Jul 20 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I design these systems for a living. We have really strict regulations on what can be emptied back into the river, and the answer is basically nothing can go back in unless it's been treated in some way. The only thing that goes completely untreated are legacy outfalls in old development areas. We also discharge straight to the river in large storms, but the City of Edmonton makes a effort to process as much of the water as possible before release.   The waterfall would have essentially dumped completely sanitized water with chlorine in it straight into the river.   We also have regulations in place for what goes into the storm sewer system, (No Paint, Soap, Oil, etc.) But we know it still gets in there so we still have to treat it. There are also requirements for larger businesses to process their own water before release, especially if there is high risks of spillage."
Edmonton,3dvvps,s1pher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"That's really great to know. Thanks for the reply. Since my response I went to this site and learned a bunch more about Edmonton's water treatment.  Regarding the Slide the City event: I can't say for sure, but I'm guessing that the sewers in that neighborhood fall into the ""legacy outfalls""  category. I'm just up the hill at 97th, and Jasper, and the stench coming from those sewers can really be overbearing at times. Thus I believe my original statement to be  somewhat close to the truth. That a business came into the city that basically spilled chlorine , and fluoride into the river for two days, as opposed to the hour or so that the Great Divide would have.  Again. You've got more expertise on the subject, but as a casual observer, that's how it looks to me."

Edit: Noted the Scandinavian Prohibition Organization in the crowd so definitely for prohibition.  Out of interest, does anyone know how much support or opposition, in general, there was in Edmonton over prohibition at the time?"
Edmonton,3dvugg,JcakSnigelton,0,Mon Jul 20 00:55:04 2015 UTC,The vocal religious minority.
Edmonton,3dvugg,Ashlir,3,Mon Jul 20 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"Church groups were often at the forefront of the prohibition movement, but it was also very important to the women's suffrage movement and the war effort as a whole. Prohibition was seen as a solution to war-time problems and was a favourite cause of female activists. Here's a relevant passage:   Even after casualty lists brought pain and darkness into far more homes than most had ever anticipated, there was still hope that the blood shed and lives lost might redeem the tragedy, making Alberta a national leader in direct government, enlightened and streamlined education and social reform. For these reasons many of the great progressive causes which had emerged before the war gained critical momentum and won their greatest victories in 1916. Rural and small town elites supported Prohibition, approved by provincial plebiscite in 1915, for ideological reasons and to tone down public drunkenness. ... French Canadians, a portion of the soldier vote, and perhaps some Ukrainian voters east and north of Edmonton, kept four districts temporarily wet: Victoria, Whitford, St. Albert and Beaver River. But during the referendum campaign, anti-prohibition rallies struck Albertans as unpatriotic, as they usually featured speakers from the neutral United States. The organizational brilliance and persistence of the churches, often led by the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and the United Farm Women of Alberta, could not be denied. Here the pre-war and wartime arguments of the WCTU made excellent use of the appeal of expediency. Precious food grain was wasted in alcohol production. Drunks wasted money, victimized women, neglected children and made poor soldiers. Money saved from being spent on alcohol would end poverty and win the war. Prohibition in Alberta became the law on July 1, 1916. Supporters cheered the decreasing number of arrests for drunkenness that followed and set their sights on new targets: non-partisan politics and votes for women.    (""Enthusiasm Embattled: 1916 and the Great War"", Duff Crerar)  Now imagine being a soldier coming home after the war had ended. Soldiers received rum rations every morning to cope with life in the trenches, and returned home to a dry country. The non-evangelical denominations (such as Catholics and Anglicans) who made up the majority of citizens weren't too keen on complete prohibition either, so it didn't last."
Edmonton,3dvugg,caoilfhionn_,2,Mon Jul 20 05:55:17 2015 UTC,"Or worst I guess.   An official, but non-binding, federal referendum on prohibition was held in 1898, with 51.3% voting for prohibition and 48.7% against, on a voter turnout of 44%. Prohibition had a majority in all provinces except Quebec, where a strong 81.2% voted against it.  I guess Quebec has had some good ideas in the past."

Edmonton,3dvugg,Loire55,0,Mon Jul 20 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"We're talking 1915, more than 300 years after the foundation of Quebec. New France was ""lost"" from pre-revolutionary and pre-enlightenment France roughly 7 generations before. ""Out of France"", sure."
Edmonton,3dvugg,b0risp,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"None of that is relevant. Quebec had a religious make up starkly different from the rest of Canada at the time being dominantly Catholic while Canada has typically been equal Catholic+Protestant with about 10% Anglican. Likewise Quebecois culture was not yet Americanized or Anglicized by 1915. Regardless of their political separation from France, Quebec maintained culture linked to the homeland that informed their opinions.  Catholics drink, the 19th century France drinks. Protestants/Victorian ideals led to prohibition, neither were strong in Quebec."

I think the down votes rained down on you because you acutally think that is a valid response or lends credence to what you have to say when discussing psychology. In reality it makes a lot of people doubt your ability to provide yourself with quality personal education.

Edmonton,3dwiov,ktollens,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:14 2015 UTC,Yes and same with any events at the Stadium.  Parking is hard to find and gets crazy expensive during major events.  You can also get towed if you're in residential areas without a parking permit.
Edmonton,3dwiov,CosmoKitty,3,Mon Jul 20 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"Clareview, Belvedere and Stadium stations all have parking. Clareview has the most of the three.  Trying to get out the Coliseum area after concerts is a free for all and traffic can be pretty bad."

Edmonton,3dwiov,switch13,2,Mon Jul 20 03:05:15 2015 UTC,"Rexall has its own parking lot directly to the north but it's usually $20 for most events.  Exit from the Yellowhead on to Wayne Gretzky Drive south and stay in the right lane to the parking lot entrance at 119th Ave.  Right now with K-Days it'll almost certainly be full most of the time.  If you have a handicapped placard though, there's almost always ample reserved parking right in front of the north doors.  Even if the lot is signed as being full, you just need to pull up to the gate with the placard showing and they'll let you in (but you still have to pay though too).  Lights control the intersection normally and there's traffic control (Edmonton Police) for unusually busy events like the Journey concert last night.  It can be nuts getting out, but I just usually take my time and it usually start to move freely within about 1/2 and hour of the mad exit rush."

Please tell me you didn't make the mistake of getting a BA in Biochem. :(   Your degree is pretty unmarketable without either staying in academia or getting your Masters degree, honestly. The Bachelor's Degree, generally has become the new High School Diploma--it won't get you very far on its own.  You're asking at the wrong time of year for available positions in government, even ignoring the fact that there is a hiring freeze at the GOA and an unofficial new hiring freeze (beyond new positions) at the City.  As far as job postings in your field goes, your faculty at SFU might be able to help you, as would career counselling services from SFU since they would also go over your CV as well.  I know this isn't the answer you want to hear, but unless you're open to working as unskilled labour (which is in decreasing demand lately), you're not going to be making $15-20/hr right away. If it's cash you're after, waiting tables or bartending would be the way to go. If you can get on and juggle two 20 hr jobs a week and hustle, you can pull in the equivalent with tips."

A certain top shop in the city that gets recommended every time has had quite a turnover of artists, and isn't what it was a few years ago.  Some have opened their own shops, and others have moved on to other shops or cities.  There are hundreds of artists in Edmonton, and that can make it had to figure out who you like.  Asking on here, you're mostly going to get the same results you'd find in a ""Best of Edmonton"" listing.  Spend some time on Facebook and Instagram.  Portfolios there are updated much more often than website portfolios and you can see what artists are doing currently.    Spend some time looking at the art.  Art is very personal, and if you're going to look at something for the rest of your life, you should at least find an artist that moves you."

Edmonton,3dtlf1,MyNameIsEnzoAmore,2,Mon Jul 20 04:38:14 2015 UTC,There is a furnished apartment on 111 street and 84 (maybe 85) ave. it is managed by west corp. however it is pretty noisy building if the room is facing 111 street. There is bus stop there and the convenience store down stairs have a loud truck came during the night. The salesperson at their leasing office is pushy and lied to me once. Basically told me she could give me a great apartment but did not mentioned the apartment was right next to a huge air conditioning fan for the building and would made unbearable noise in the summer.   So always take a look yourself or ask a friend to check it out. Don't completely believe them.   http://www.westcorp.net/galen-lofts-edmonton.php
Edmonton,3dtlf1,dcxx20,2,Sun Jul 19 12:25:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah their apartments are very nice, but expensive. Definitely get a tour of the apartments first - I had a tour at one of the properties they manage and the first couple apartments they showed me were next to loud fans, loading docks, etc, but we later were showed apartments with none of those problems. Just be wary of possible noise pollution in that area, I guess."

Edmonton,3dtlf1,forifttt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're looking for a 3 bedroom place. Is that correct? 3 bedroom suites along the LRT are very, very hard to come by, even if your budget is astronomical. On top of that, suites near Whyte Ave are expensive, hard to come by, and low-quality because it's such a popular area for UofA students.    In other words, your best bet might be to compromise a bit. Maybe consider a 2-bedroom place downtown, or one further south (like near Century Park) or one a little further from the LRT (like in Blue Quill or west Oliver)."
Edmonton,3dtlf1,anytimeyoulike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:03:30 2015 UTC,Have kid who wants to go to Strathcona high. 2 Bedroom would be a compromise. Basically only need it for 2-3 months while finding permanent place in area.

Edmonton,3drywy,AdenosineJunky,16,Sat Jul 18 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"Years ago me and two buddies parked our jeeps in front of Tin Palace on Jasper on a Friday afternoon. Unbeknownst to us at the time, the place we were parked turns into a no parking zone after 4 pm. The parking dude was just starting my ticket, so I told my buddies to bail and I'd distract him and take one for the team. So I started friendly chattng him up, and eventually he says ""is this one yours? If so, I don't have to submit this, you got to it in time.""  Parking dudes and dudettes are humans."
Edmonton,3drywy,shitbong,6,Sun Jul 19 00:23:54 2015 UTC,Tow trucks literally line up outside Canada Place on 97st in front of the Hardware Grill at 3:30 waiting for 4pm to hit. They then proceed to tow the 10 vehicles parked there. 45 mins later they are back to tow the 5 or so more sorry folks who are now parked there. I've seen so many arguments and engagements between the towers and the parkers and never once seen a dude moment.
Edmonton,3drywy,ZednotZee,7,Sun Jul 19 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"That's tow trucks, though, not parking enforcement. Tow trucks make cash directly from towing, so they have financial incentive to tow. Unless parking enforcement has a quota (up for debate), then usually the parking officers can let it slide, or be cool and it won't hit em in the pocket book."

Edmonton,3drywy,Mulatto_Prince,3,Sun Jul 19 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, the City changed their policy to allow their parking enforcement to let it slide more often. Turns out that employee morale went up, turnover went down, and there were fewer assaults on parking enforcement as a result of the policy change. The City will lose something like $1million in revenue though."

Edmonton,3drywy,Kerodohi,4,Sat Jul 18 23:17:37 2015 UTC,I am curious if anyone knows offhand - what is the minimum distance you need to park away from the exit of a complex?

Edmonton,3drywy,venomroses,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:46:31 2015 UTC,"Last winter, I took cabs home after work on really cold days because transit wasn't very good at that location.  There was a loading zone in front of the building where people were coming and going.  One bylaw officer worked the street for a couple of weeks.  He watched me get in and out of cabs.  I mean, watched me like I was doing something illegal.  On one of his last days on the route, he actually yelled at my cab driver for stopping...in a loading zone...it would take me literally less than 1 minute to hop in and drive away.  Instead, the officer yelled at us for about three minutes.  Finally the cab driver just pulled away.  Unreal....probably downvoted by a bylaw officer..."
Edmonton,3drywy,GarMc,2,Sun Jul 19 18:39:05 2015 UTC,In my neighborhood theres an intersection that you can't see left because there are huge trucks and even a cube van parking on the side up to the corner. Is this also a case to call? I've witnessed some very close calls
Edmonton,3drywy,FoodTruckForMayor,5,Sun Jul 19 01:17:32 2015 UTC,"In the absence of signs, you're not allowed to park closer than 5m from an intersection or traffic control sign at an intersection. However there are some cases where even 5m isn't enough to be able to see oncoming traffic. In that case, your best bet is to call 311 and ask for someone to check it out. Also useful if there are tree branches (public or private) that need to be trimmed for visibility."
Edmonton,3drywy,GarMc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"In my case there is a ""no parking sign"" that people always ignore. If they are within 5m of the intersection you will get results."

Edmonton,3dthoo,hyper-green,16,Sun Jul 19 08:21:08 2015 UTC,"No one seems to have mentioned this: remember that slower 'traffic' has the right of way. So if you're coming up behind some folks walking and someone else is coming towards you on the left, you have to slow down until you can find a safe way to pass.   Also keep in mind: these are multi-use trails for enjoying the scenery etc. Be chill. Lots of cyclists get all entitled when they talk about these paths... They're for everyone to use so you're going to see joggers and strollers and kids and people with dogs. Have fun. Let other people have fun. Don't be a dick."
Edmonton,3dthoo,USUNFK,8,Sun Jul 19 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"Have a bell on your bike to warn people that you are passing them,  other than that its quite simple and a good way to explore the city."
Edmonton,3dthoo,Ty199,3,Sun Jul 19 09:33:23 2015 UTC,Get a bell and ring it often. Assume everyone can't see you. I nearly ran into a guy who was walking towards me in his left lane/my right lane who wasn't paying attention and couldn't hear the five or six bell rings I gave him.
Edmonton,3dthoo,cookingbaconnaked,3,Sun Jul 19 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"Also, assume everyone is wearing ear buds. So give people a wide berth, and if you can't, slow down. I witnessed an old man being hit before, even when the cyclist used his bell. It wasn't pretty (I don't mean to scare OP, as long as you are cautious there is nothing to worry about)."
Edmonton,3dthoo,cache22x,2,Sun Jul 19 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"And,  half the time that you do ring a bell people often don't hear it.  Giving them lots of passing space on the path is the same courtesy as expecting safe passing by drivers on the road."
Edmonton,3dthoo,Vietmam,3,Sun Jul 19 23:00:08 2015 UTC,You can go a looooonñg way - pack water and snacks. There are occasional bathrooms/water fountains. Trailforks has maps of MTB trails that are not on the city's maps.  And definitely the bell.

Foxes are also around but I've not even heard of an issue with them. A bear in the river valley is so rare it makes the news the odd time it does happen, I don't believe a bear has ever hurt someone in Edmonton.  The biggest pests I find are the beavers and rabbits. Although they're only problem at night/evening. Rabbits tend to sit on the trails and won't move at night because they don't see you coming. Beavers on the other hand are just assholes and won't move even if their staring you in the eye. Hitting either one is less than ideal."

There's a million ways to cut hair and until you actually show me an idea of what a term like ""designs"" means to you, you may as well have said ""cut my hair good, scissor man!"" Until someone is physically in my chair in front of me and we're discussing what they want, I have no idea what they're after."
Edmonton,3dstov,zulukilocharlie,0,Mon Jul 20 19:35:29 2015 UTC,Repeating the qualification you already claimed isn't changing the fact that you didn't seem to know what an undercut design is. I'm sure you do good work but maybe you're not the kind of barber these people are looking for.

Edmonton,3duv8j,DADD780,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:40:55 2015 UTC,Negotiate your deals in the last week of the month. Most dealerships are open until 7 or 8 so don't feel bothered to go at 5 or 6 pm. Puts the pressure on the salesperson who wants to get every last sale they can
Edmonton,3duv8j,TheRealKozi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:41:16 2015 UTC,"1) know the exact model/trim/options you want, do not get the dealer to put clearbra/undercoating/stainproofing on your car, you'll pay more than shopping around 2) use https://carcostcanada.com/to get an idea of what the dealer is  paying for the same car you want 3) the dealership is not your friend, they want to part you with your money, theyre not your buddy or pal. 4)Offer them their cost for the vehicle, this sometimes works because of manufacturer hold backs (manufacturer holds onto a deposit, which gets returned after the dealer sells the car) 5) negotiate the price from there. 6) Make sure the salesman understands you have no problem driving to the next dealer. 7) congratulations, you bought a car, make sure the dealer isn't trying to fuck you over by putting on ""Security Stickers/etching, Document fees, Tire/Nitrogen Insurance"" on the invoice. This shit can easily total $2000 if you're not watching.  Explain to the salesman that you don't want to see any of that shit on the bill."

Edmonton,3drhah,eternalspira,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:42:25 2015 UTC,the latter seems most feasible. They don't even need to crossover until Churchill so if they crossover anywhere between Health Sciences and Churchill they can continue on the Metro Line.

I mean look at it, it's a pile of silver balls jutting out of the earth. It's not like it continues some some plateau line that falls off naturally and the art continues it. It's a pile of balls in the dirt. You're trying to hard to make this ""make sense"". And I'm someone who's defended the artistic merit of Pollock paintings.  You know what counts as good public art for infrastructure projects? The fish on Glenmore Trail in Calgary. Nice artistic addition to otherwise boring concrete.

Edmonton,3dn4al,DeadliestSins,6,Fri Jul 17 19:16:52 2015 UTC,"The official story from the city: http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/urban_planning_and_design/talus-dome.aspx  My reasoning is based on the fluidity of meaning, as described here: https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bp5352cfzBMC&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=%22fluidity+of+meaning%22&source=bl&ots=YZZOo_TMA7&sig=iEkSUlRC75pt-J2Lwp3xz43jfrg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCwQ6AEwA2oVChMI_4jew_TixgIVDhKSCh0Sog3O#v=onepage&q=%22fluidity%20of%20meaning%22&f=false  Art of any kind, whether written word, spoken word, sculpture, photography, etc can be only be understood within the context of its creation (including its intertextual references), but its meaning can only be derived through present experience because meaning cannot be frozen in time--it must be responsive to current sensibilities, or it is meaningless. This why hotel paintings can get swapped out every few years, but seeming mad randomness of a Pollock painting is timeless--it continues to say different things about and to contemporary society.  Hence, my answer in five years may be different, and I certainly hope it is because chances are, if it isn't, then the Talus Domes will serve no purpose and provide no point of reference to anything contemporaneous.   This isn't just art though, but in other areas too. Take for instance my wife's family, specifically her father's side. For centuries, they lived in a village in what is now France. However, in working with my MIL several years ago on a genealogy project for my FIL's 50th,  we noticed that several times, despite the name of the village remaining constant, the records would indicate that the same village was at one time or another in France, or the Netherlands, or England, or Belgium. Why? Because borders change, meaning changes, even if the physical object--in this case, the village-- does not change at all."

I would say they have a good idea of where food is, in fact they may even tell other magpies they see along the way where food is and you may inadvertently increase the magpie population of the city. Unfortunately,  I think the only permanent solution to this would be to destroy the animals, which I wouldn't want to do either, they have as much a right to live as we do. We have magpies in abundance here in Ottewell as well, they like to torment and tease our dog in the backyard. So I think we will just have to live with it and hope the population doesn't explode even more next year. But sadly, as the city grows, so will the amount of garbage we produce, which will just bring more scavengers around."

I've recapped it for your convenience:   You said magpies are beneficial to bird populations. All my comments are directed at this. I said they are not, they seriously fuck up bird populations as predators. You asked if I ever eat eggs and said they're ""just like us"" in terms of diet, drawing a connection between magpies and humans. I said that isn't the point, it is that magpies can destroy wild bird populations. Humans eat eggs that are farmed and there is no chance of destroying a bird population by doing that. You said I was impressing human morals on magpies. I said you're an idiot. You said chickens think their eggs get stolen. I'm going to, again, call you an idiot."

Sushi... recently discovered Watari. Also downtown, all you can eat dine in sushi and the quality is actually quite good. Cheap too, around $25-30 per person depending when you go. Inexpensive compared to places like Kyoto or Mikado, but doesn't seem to really sacrifice quality.  Dessert... Duchess Bakery. It has gained its accolades on its own, so I don't have to say much.

About half an hour later, they came storming back into our hotel.  The father was less than pleased with the recommendation.

Edmonton,3dnddt,feather_brain,3,Fri Jul 17 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"News person checking in: if it didn't make it onto the news there is a high likelihood that police didn't release any information, or the severity of the injuries didn't warrant sending a cameraman to the scene. Lately it's been the former of the two though.  For example, on Sunday morning woman was murdered during a home invasion near Southgate, and the shooters got away. Police didn't release any information until after our newsroom call them 24 hours later, after a neighbor called us to tell us that homicide investigators were in his neighborhood.  Police said not sending out a news release gave them more freedom in their investigation, and while I see where they're coming from... It's a little bit frustrating when they use an excuse like that."

While Edmonton is indeed the capital of Alberta, I feel like people focus too much on this one point. Similarly, the LRT line names (capital, metro, valley, river lines) all sound like names made up by people who don't actually live in Edmonton, and just checked out the wikipedia page. And actually, you should have seen some of the other suggestions for the capital ex replacement name (river city festival, etc).  Edmonton is so much more than a capital of a province with a river. We have a fantastic summer with more festivals than you can shake a fist at, a great river valley that people use all year round, a great music scene, and yes, even a fairly sized mall.   K-days may not make much sense in it's current incarnation, but I appreciate that it is a throwback to klondike days, which everyone called K-days anyways. Oftentimes names arise organically and this is an example of that."

I wonder if this reporter understands that economic diversification is one of the best tools available to minimize negative impacts of business cycles, or that investing in a lot of different things means that at least some of them will not work out."
Edmonton,3dnevj,decadent_west,4,Fri Jul 17 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"right, but the example in this article are of propping up failing industries and businesses that are already established. this was corporate welfare dressed up as diversification.  diversification is best accomplished by encouraging things around it rather than directly investing in a business. make post-secondary cheaper (or free). give tax breaks to companies looking to set up shop in Edmonton. establish more startup incubators so new companies dont need to worry about rent.  please Notley, don't go starting new crown corps or bailing out failing industries - the government isnt any good at picking winners and losers because they dont have a true incentive for profit. the province should just be making it easier to succeed here, not guaranteeing success to losing businesses."
Edmonton,3dnevj,MyNameIsEnzoAmore,3,Fri Jul 17 18:26:08 2015 UTC,Crown corps as a rule are not a bad thing as long as there is a need for the product or service that the private sector cannot profitably (for them) and sustainably (for the consumer) deliver to the quality of market demand.

What the govt should not be in the business of is financing and bailing out huge business interests; priming the economic pump can be done in much better ways that benefit the whole province rather than just shady 1% bastards."
Edmonton,3dnevj,samandiriel,2,Fri Jul 17 20:37:27 2015 UTC,I stand by it. The only good Crown corporation are the corporations created to fill a void that private businesses could or should not fill. Otherwise those Crown corporations should not exist.

Ever have a rich, luscious beer that just about fills you up on its own? You know what we're talking about.   Monasteries and beer have a long history, and to this day many orders of monks still brew their own beer in order to have a tasty and nutritious drink to accompany their meals and to sell to the public but most importantly to sustain them during periods of fasting. Fortunately, drinking beer is not considered breaking the fast.   The definition of food doesn't say anything about ""chewing."""

They actually take it seriously as it should be.   Number one problem is allowing people to choose when and where they take the test, and it allows you to drive any class 5 vehicle anywhere at any time. There is no standardization at all - you can book it with your CVT Prius in an incredibly small town on a sunny Monday afternoon with literally zero traffic or any actual situations you will come across.  This for whatever reason allows you to drive a manual, dual shifter (good luck finding one of those lol) 1 ton dually with a fully loaded 30 foot trailer down the QE2 or through edmonton rush hour traffic during a blizzard...  My mom did this and still refuses to drive in edmonton because she has no idea how to deal with real life driving situations, just cruise slowly down a straight empty road with other farmers etc."

When I brought it in to a BC registry to switch it, they just gave me a regular one.. I ended up moving back to AB 5 years later, and the registry here took my BC licence and gave me a full class 5.  So, all this to say, yes the GDL program has its faults. I agree with you that I think it should be harder in general to be licensed in the first place."

Then it would serve its intended purpose.   That said, less demirit points is supposed to make people be more careful, you could lose your license after 3 bad tickets for example, and zero alcohol rule hopefully discourages drinking and driving. So there are some benefits. Also, I do believe your insurance will go down when you get your full license, so that $130 might pay for its self fairly quickly."
Edmonton,3dks3q,Azd123,4,Fri Jul 17 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"It makes almost zero to zero difference on insurance.  The grid system is almost exclusively based on years with license, years insured, and years since last at fault claim, or tickets.  In my experience people who drink and drive don't care about GDL or not, they just do it. Even fundamentally they're doing it because they're either not thinking of the potential risks and consequences or just do not care.

I am getting more and more clients adding their adult children to their insurance policies after getting their Class 5.  Fewer and fewer 16-18 olds are getting their licenses.  I just added a driver today to a policy and she got her first DL at 25, that is not uncommon anymore.  Unfortunately the rules have be applied equally.  While some living here(and assuming they were born and raised in Canada) are used to our roads and conditions, in a computer database they are no different then some 28 yr old who came here the week before with no experience on Canadian roads from a country that has very little driving and managed to pass the driving test.

The more experienced a country as a whole is at driving, the safer individual drivers actually become. It was in some ask reddit or TIL post a couple days/weeks ago. Neat stuff. So yeah, it sounds really racist to say ""damned immigrants can't drive"" but statisticaly, objectively, there's a lot of truth to it when they're coming from countries with fewer vehicle-miles driven per capita than here (India, China, Africa?).  Additionally, there's some merit to the idea that a person who has never been a passenger in a car in winter driving conditions for years will have less of a general idea of the perils of such.  Though to be honest, the biggest difficulty I observe with most new-canadian drivers is that rather than follow the prescribed rules of the road, they tend to follow their observations of what's happening on the road.

It lasted about 10 minutes, we drove around a relatively quiet residential neighborhood for the most part, I had to point out potential hazards and was asked to demonstrate one type of advanced parking technique (I was asked to do a downhill park which is very easy but I suppose they could ask for a parallel which may make it tougher).  No traffic circles or anything like that, and we were only on a large non-residential road for about a minute total. I guess it may be different depending on where you take it. I took it in the west end (Mayfield) and it was very very easy. Easier than the initial test for sure.  That said it did feel good to get upgraded to a full license. But given how common sense the test was I'd hardly call it an advanced driving test (unless I happened to get a major slacker of a tester). I suspect that the primary purpose of the GDL program is to prevent 16-17 year old drivers from being fully licensed (as it's not possible to get rid of the GDL condition before you turn 18 even if you got your learner's at 14) or I guess a quick check to make sure you didn't forget the basics."
Edmonton,3dks3q,durple,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:05:54 2015 UTC,I thought the advanced test was supposed to be an hour long or something (which was why it's so expensive).
Edmonton,3dks3q,C0rdt,2,Fri Jul 17 04:14:35 2015 UTC,Mine was definitely not an hour unless you count the time I spent in the waiting room. 10 minutes is a low-end estimation on my part I guess but it was definitely under half an hour in the car. I was surprised how short and easy it was.
Edmonton,3dks3q,Wojtek87,2,Fri Jul 17 04:17:41 2015 UTC,"Surprising for me too, my test was exactly an hour long."
Edmonton,3dks3q,Wooshio,3,Fri Jul 17 04:19:33 2015 UTC,"+1. Made small talk with the test giver, he told me their routes are all pre determined and designed by some government branch, so I have no idea who tested this guy.  He did tell me if you fail you can re-take the test and it will be exactly the same.... So there's that...."

Edmonton,3dkktn,nhawkeye,3,Fri Jul 17 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Would you mind if I asked about some behavioural issues with my 2010 T&C Limited?   If not, don't worry about replying... I understand.  VERY occasionally, perhaps three or four times a year, I put the key in, turn it to start and nothing...no crank no beeping...nothing.   After that it won't crank for about 15 minutes then if I leave it alone for about 20 minutes it'll crank and run like nothing's wrong, but then the doors do something funky like one side will not power operate for the rest of the day and the remote start wont work.  The next day everything is fine until the next time this happens.   I have two different OBDII readers and they show no codes.   The dealer says the same thing and unless they see it happen first hand they can't offer anything else.  Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.   I'm thinking never buy a Chrysler again might be a good mantra....thanks."

Edmonton,3dkktn,arandom4567,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:59:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they had a recall on that series (caravan for sure) for the key fob cylinders cutting out while driving. Perhaps your issue is related.
Edmonton,3dkktn,lilshawn,3,Sun Jul 19 02:07:12 2015 UTC,Good luck Nick!  Can vouch for excellent service and very friendly individual.
Edmonton,3dkktn,FuguCola,2,Fri Jul 17 12:16:23 2015 UTC,"Got a 2007 Dodge Caliber.  We have owned it for a little over a year.  We bought it in the winter, so we couldn't test out the air conditioning... It blew cold air, but it was also -45 outside, so we took it on good faith.  We have been wanting to get it fixed, but money has been an issue. Able to do that kind of stuff?"
Edmonton,3dkktn,shnugget,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:05:42 2015 UTC,Probably just needs a refrigerant recharge. You might be able to easily do that yourself.  Check it.
Edmonton,3dkktn,lpvishnu,3,Fri Jul 17 02:11:59 2015 UTC,To properly fill your refrigerant system you will need a dual gauge setup to monitor the system pressures.
