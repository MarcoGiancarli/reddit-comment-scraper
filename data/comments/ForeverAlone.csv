I actually can't sleep unless I have the support from a pillow against my chest for my shoulder that's up from the bed (not on it, sleeping on my side).  If I don't have it, I have a really hard time sleeping.  For me it's not really about being lonely or pathetic to sleep cuddling a pillow, it's about warmth and comfort; pillows are thick and reflect a lot of heat, I don't like having really heavy blankets so it makes my chest the warmest part of me.  Also, the rigidity (however small) of the pillow, gives me support across my chest/shoulders so it's easier for me to relax and get to sleep.  It has nothing to do with being pathetic.  I'd estimate that people who regularly sleep alongside another person, probably do this very often when they're not sleeping alongside someone; when they do have someone alongside them in bed, they have someone to cuddle, and may not need it... but I'd be guessing if that person is gone, they're doing it too.  I think it's just self-deprecation that makes you say it's ""pathetic"" - because if you really think about it, it's really not."

Too many people underestimate the pain of being forever alone and therefore cannot understand us. Don't blame all women for bashing on us though, I still have a bit of faith in humanity and I sincerely believe most women are not that close minded. I would not mind to pay for an escort or a virtual girlfriend because those simulations are the closest I would ever get to a normal life. They are not as satisfying as a real relationship but they bring a bit of joy in my miserable life, so why should I feel bad for simulating a basic human need that can easily be fulfilled by everyone else. Why should I feed sad and stay still on my romantical void? Why can't I at least try to mimic what humans need most, affection?  I am not complaining about women not willing to date me because I know that I am not datable. If I was a woman, I would not date someone such as myself because the relationship would obviously not be fulfilling due to my defects. I just hope people can eventually understand that our problems are complex and cannot be fixed by simply lowering our standards. I have no standards and I don't belong to anyone's dating pool either, I am excluded but I still crave for affection because I am a human being and I don't know how to deny that feeling.

Obviously they would stop talking to me after seeing them. Most of them were so embarassed by what they thought that they tried to change the subject right away hoping I wouldn't notice something so obvious. Some of them had been programmed to feel the need to give a compliment, so they tell me that I have beautiful eyes. It was soulcrushing to realize that it's the same compliment I would receive from my mother's friends (who were also mothers) when I was a kid. One woman told me I have beautiful hands, which is sort of true, as in that women who like me also tell me I have beautiful hands, but it was obviuos it was a poor man's compliment in this circumstance. ""you're not ugly, you're not my type"" is not insulting per se when someone tells you that, but when dozens or hundreds of people do it's quite obvious that it's just a blatant lie.

However, I don't buy your numbers or the implications. I have heard this 80-20 stuff a lot, but as far as I can tell it's from that OKC study where women only rated a very small amount of men attractive (if the numbers originate from elsewhere, I apologize and am interested to know where). Now, that same poll shows that there is a gap between ratings and behavior. Regardless, one only has to look at how many men are actually FA. We are closer to 1% of the population than 80%.

In fact, the gap probably was even wider prior to the dawn of agricultural societies where monogamy became an institution.   If you look at nature you will see that for the vast majority of species males have to compete furiously with one another to pass on thier genes and most males fail utterly. In a way us humans are lucky because monogamy has actually decreased the competition."

By which I mean that the best evolutionary strategy for women was to be very picky so as to make each preganancy count (therefore only go for the absolute best mate you can find) while for men it was to mate with as many females as possible (less picky about mates). I think these mentalities are still with us today.   That being said I completely agree that far far less than 80% of men are going to end up totally FA in modern society. But there have always been and will probably always be more FA men than FA women.

ForeverAlone,3e37gj,EsteraMC,9,Tue Jul 21 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"For example, I made a comment one time on a girl who was considered average with my friends, and said she was hot, but they all said that she was average to below-average, and that I need to raise my standards.    First of all, you're not going to get a straight answer out of a group of guys, especially young guys.  Second of all, the only right answer to this is ""Okay, you don't like her?  Your loss, because I do.""  It's really no-ones business what people you're attracted to.   Stuff like this has happened plenty of times.   I used to have a friend, decades ago.  He always thought the girls I liked were gross.  I thought the girls he liked were really unappealing.  Which one of us had 'lower' standards?  I think neither.  Look, we all agree that fashion models are beautiful.  But most people aren't fashion models, and there's a huge degree of difference in the kind of beauty flaws we like and tolerate.  Fat is the most obvious one; some guys would rather date a skinny girl with a mediocre face, other guys will always prefer fat girls with pretty faces.  To some people crooked teeth are a huge turn-off, others just think it's cute.  For most of us, there is no ""high"" and ""low"", just various directions of ""sideways"".  People treat having ""high standards"" as some sort of status symbol (which is why your friends aren't ever going to give you a straight answer), when it's mostly just a self-imposed inconvenience."

I also keep a minimal standard for physical appearance when it comes to dating. A girl doesn't have to turn me on at all, she just can't repulse me (extremely obese, unhygienic). Sadly, I don't think I meet that standard for most women."
ForeverAlone,3e37gj,freakazoid14,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"Amazingly, everyone has different tastes. It's like when some men have a thing for hugely obese women, the bigger the better etc. That isn't te same as everyone else. Personally, I don't like women who wear a lot of make-up or dress provocatively, some are fine to look at, but I wouldn't want to be involved with one. I prefer the ""plain Jane"" type. In my opinion, a woman who doesn't make a huge amount of effort and can still be nice and have a good sense of humour goes a lot further than someone who tries far too hard."

ForeverAlone,3e37gj,benji_the_vandal,3,Tue Jul 21 19:15:37 2015 UTC,Yes.  I can even feel more attracted to a woman if I think that most men don't find her attractive.

As long as she's not obese and doesn't have an abhorrent face, I'd have a date with her, if she treats me with respect just like I do with others. Online I have contacted almost all women, I'm even very open about age, 18-45 when I'm in the middle. It never worked, the only women who wanted me were women met by luck through other means, and mostly introduced by common acquaintances to me. And they never were from my region, they all lived quite far from me. IRL on the other hand I can't bring myself to try to hit on the ugliest women, I'd have no drive. I also never hit on the beautiful ones, it's always a mix of beauty and personality that I get greatly interested in, but it never works."
ForeverAlone,3e37gj,AsdAsd80,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:58 2015 UTC,Of course. I would say that 90% of women under 30 who are not obese are extremely attractive.

ForeverAlone,3e2x82,trail22,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"Well, can I help it along by mailing it a map, or perhaps a GPS?  Because it seems to have a poor sense of direction from what I have seen so far.    Jokes aside, I think people says this because that's how it happens for most people.  They find their partners from relationships that developed organically out of their social circles.  And people see the world based on their experience and assume so they assume that it must also be the case for us.    However, as an analogy, just because most kids learned to speak their first language naturally and spontaneously, it does not means the small percentage of kids who needs special help by therapists don't exist.  For those kids it takes effort.  I can understand when people say that you can't look for love just as a comforting thing (whether it is effective is another matter), but I disagree when they try to use it as a way to stop a person from ""trying too hard""."

And it doesn't mather who it is. What really make things wierd is that I also hate being alone.    I think that may partially have been your depression talking.  Depression tends to make people less interested in what they once enjoyed.    But on the other hand, it may also be the result of just getting so used to being alone, that it is really difficult and takes effort to socialize.  I get that feeling too, much less so nowadays.  Unfortunately the only way I have found to deal with it is to keep pushing your comfort zone and socialize in spite of that, and hopefully eventually you start to get used to the new ways of doing things.     in a month I will start at university. I will be really busy studying and a university isn't really a place where you socialise? I mean you go to your lectures and that's it.     People are supposed to socialize in a university though...  Never again in your life will you get to meet such large number of new people naturally.  This is actually a very good chance to start over that you have that I think a lot of us wishes we have, and a source of regret for not having pushed enough self-imposed boundaries when we were there.  Please do make an effort to talk to and get to know more people, even if you have to push far beyond your comfort zone to do it."

ForeverAlone,3e1qhb,blancaweiss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:24 2015 UTC,As a matter of fact yes. We decided to stay just friends.

She is in general a fantastic and pleasant person. We'll be seeing more of each other I'm sure. But now that I know she's not looking for some kind of relationship it's not my intention to assume that it's just a matter of time before we start dating. If that's the case then great but until then I don't intend to waste time. I want to do the best I can to use this as fuel to sack up and maybe ask someone out for real.

We live in a hookup culture, most guys who are in relationships and young are there because they have no other options. Maybe you'll never be approached by another woman, this was truly a mulligan IMO. Just don't ""wait to get to know someone"", that is just saying you're not a man to these women.

I suppose I'm a bit disappointed that things didn't work out that way but that's life I guess. As much as I resent my own virginity, I'd still prefer to stick to my ideals.

Subconsciously being nice translates to weakness in our heads. We try not to think that but it's our nature and we can't help it. Be nice but don't be a doormat. Think of how the perfect professional boss would act and be that. That boss is polite and courteous but you respect him and don't take advantage of his kindness or he will shut you down.

It's very gross and it is a 100% complete turn off. Two months ago I discovered SkinCareAddiction. I've been lurking, studying, and apply everything I've learned there. I don't care what other guys think of me. Every morning and night, I cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize. I apply charcoal masks and use sunscreen religiously.

Virginity or lack of sex is a small part of the ordeal.  Look, when you are in your late teens and early 20's (which most of the kids on here are - like yourself), sure sex holds a higher than ""normal"" degree of importance.  Once you grow up the pain of not having the other things is MUCH MORE important than not having sex.  I couldn't care less about sex or me not having it.  Knowing that I will never have children is much harder for me to cope with than the fact that I am still a virgin.  Knowing that if tomorrow I suddenly met someone and was no longer FA but could still not have a ""normal"" life is sadder.  Sex, sex is NOTHING.  Love, now there's something worth fighting for.  Look, I have said it before and I'll say it again.  This sub focuses too much on sex.  I do understand why, as I said it's because most of the posters here are in their twenties.  They are still just kids.  Hormones are still flying.  Most aren't really FA just late bloomers, it's frankly too early to tell for most of them.  The vast majority of the kids who post on here are going to turn out just fine, most likely including OP.  You know how I know that?  Stats my friend, stats.  There is data on this condition and it looks overwhelmingly positive for most.  Less than 1% over 40 are FA.  But for those of us who are truly FA we have bigger fish to fry.  Sleeping with a prostitute would solve none of those issues.  All it would do is make OP not a virgin.  Having sex isn't the goal.

When I faced the same dilemma I had to seriously consider what I did on a daily basis.   Try doing that and consider what you could improve on, what might be a more productive use of time.

Anything that gives one hope is awful, because it sets one up for a worse failure/rejection later.  No one is guaranteed success or happiness in this world. We are all guaranteed suffering and failure of some kind. Understanding and accepting this are the keys to peace. You are not going to be happy this way, but neither are you going to be despondent because of external rejection.  I accept that I am incapable of loving and of being loved. I actively oppose being in a relationship now because I know myself and know that no one would accept my many faults and issues when there are so many better people out there.  If I harbored hope, I would continue to be rejected instead of accepted, and I don't know how many more times I can be pushed to that point before a suicide attempt triggered by those events is successful.

ForeverAlone,3e149s,111axa1,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm almost 47 years old and still a virgin--been on fewer dates my whole life than I have fingers and toes. I earn $505/month as an adjunct professor of music, and a few extra dollars here and there as a piano teacher, although recently I've been trading lessons for things like rent and food. I have a gambling problem. No one wants to play the music I've written. I've attempted suicide twice in the last few years. 911 refused to help me when I called the last time. I'm overweight and untoned. I haven't been on depression medication for 4 years because I can't afford it. I don't work enough hours for the state of Florida to say I deserve any kind of help like food assistance or medicaid.  And that's just for starters. Each fault by itself might be acceptable to someone, but all of them together are too much for me to handle, let alone someone else. I'm a broken person, a project no one wants to tackle. When they say it's all my attitude, I tell them they're right so I don't have to argue with them. Then they act like they could care less about how much I am hurting because I ""brought it all on myself."" Or even worse, I deserve to be where I am and therefore I don't deserve any help at all.  People have offered to help before, but no one has stuck with it. Right now, I'm just basically waiting to die.  I was told by previous people I found interesting (years ago, to be sure, but the message stuck) that the reason no one loved me is because I didn't love anyone but myself. They didn't know or refused to see how much I hate myself. But I guess it's true that if I can't love myself, why should anyone else think I could care about them?  And if I have to get to that point, I just don't think I can. Besides, why waste so much energy on fixing myself when it will all fall apart when someone rejects me again? I'm not worth fixing. If I died tonight, no one would suspect anything for weeks. The students at the school wouldn't think anything until I missed 2 classes (1 week). I'd be fired via email when I didn't answer my phone or respond via email. And that would be the end of the college's concern about me. My family wouldn't wonder about me until after 3-4 weeks of just getting my voice mail or until my phone was disconnected. I just wouldn't be missed. If I successfully ended my life, people would probably say ""about time he did it instead of talked about it."" That is, if people actually thought about me at all."

I had a girlfriend who did that with me, we were both the ""ugly"" roommates of attractive girls and met at a party. For about a year, we hung out a lot and took a ""fuck you"" attitude to the people that shunned us. All of a sudden, she goes back home for the summer and meets a guy who ended up living 15 minutes away from campus and was there on vacation.   Through him, she made some friends and after she tried to get me a bf to no avail, she cut me out of her life and said I was ""hopeless"". I already thought that, but it hurt coming from her because we had been each other's confidants. It's just something to be expected because it's all about hierarchy. Hopefully you process this pain and move on because what he says doesn't matter, you're either a creep or not because of your actions.

Second, exercise combined with better hygiene greatly improved my self esteem and made social situations much easier. I know it sounds shallow, but it's the honest truth. Of course this doesn't make social situations easy immediately, it still takes tons of practice, but persistence makes perfect. Good luck OP, and try browsing r/aww if you need a quick mood boost."

It's the tendency to not look like you're listening; the glazing over (people can actually see that).   Humour is usually good for extending a conversation but it's playing with wild-fire.

Maybe it comes off as rude to other people. Not only that but people can sense neediness, forced conversation, etc.   Never underestimate human insight.

The way normal people handle it is that they constantly meet new people and make new friends, which really sucks for people like us because school was the only comfortable environment for that sort of interaction.   Dunno what to tell you man. I've had a few friends outright ditch me for a more popular crowd in high school/college, which sounds like what your situation is right now. The nicer friends try to hang out once in a while and invite me to their family/friend gatherings, but that's maybe a few times a year.

I will truly have no one in life to talk to and life will be terribly, terribly depressing.  I guess I'm confused? I want to be alone but then again I don't. Meeting new people is a burden for me due to how much I just don't trust people and find everyone superficial and hide behind masks."

On the one hand you have guys pressuring other guys to approach women. On the other side, you have women saying how these ugly guys are ""creeps"" for approaching them. I know my only option is to keep to myself. I am not allowed to show sexuality of any kind or else it's creepy. Society has taught me to assume everyone hates me because most likely, they do. This isn't me playing the ""victim"" either. Judging by the reactions I've gotten for even daring to talk to most women in public is wrong. Do not SWH(socialize while ugly.) It is better to just stare down and not make eye contact with any women and I know I'm going to get downvotes from people trying to vilify me for having this view but the women I've talked to have told me a similar narrative. If an attractive guy approaches them, they will label him with every positive stereotype possible. If the guy is ugly, he could say the same exact words and be called a creep to the point, I wish someone would make a video of an attractive guy approaching a random woman then saying a couple of lines, then have an ""unattractive"" guy say the exact same lines."

Just suit yourself.  If some girl in yoga pants and a thong bends over and you want to check out her ass, just discretely look. Who cares, really.  I think one of the problems is it has become a common trend in our society to overvalue the opinion of a person because he/ she is attractive. I actually remember a Yahtzee review (he gives me a laugh) where he commented that reporting the opinions of celebrities who are mostly famous for their looks is a phenomenon our culture really needs to get over. I agree.  You don't ask Kate Upton or Jared Leto for their opinions on the renewable energy market cos at the end of the day, they've got nothing to do with those industries, so they don't fucking know.  Likewise, don't put too much stock in the Social Justice opinions of a bunch of people who've already wrongly convinced themselves that having an attractive bone structure inherently boosts their critical thinking abilities. Basically:  Their attitudes aren't really logical, because they've already decided to ignore logic.  So just see it for what it is and disregard their criteria of creep branding."

That's not what we were talking about though.   I wouldn't find the compliment you suggested creepy from someone I didn't find attractive. I'd just be flattered and say thanks.

Perhaps for you but a lot (most?) women obviously disagree.  It's a simple formula: a lot of (most?) women are insecure.  If an unattractive man complements them then she's thinking: ""oh my god, is this the best I can get? really? if I let this slide then everyone around me will think I'm on the same level as him! well we can't let that happen now can we sister? best to call him a creep!""  In other words accepting a complement from an unattractive man is seen by her as a loss of social status and that loss is a blow to her ego.  Rationally it's not actually a loss of status, but the rational part of the brain has gone on vacation and fear is driving her instead."

I'm sure some people with low self esteem might worry if an unattractive person approached them that they were somehow now in some lower imaginary 'league' but I really don't think it's that high a percentage.   I'd think an awful lot of girls are so jaded by being harassed for sex that anyone approaching them gets classed automatically as a creep. Which isn't right, but it happens.

ForeverAlone,3dyt4h,bejeweledlyoness,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:31:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the thought process of most women.   This may depend on where you live.  Even if you are in the U.S. like I am there are regional cultural differences.  There are a also class differences when it comes to culture.  By ""class"" I don't mean income per se, I mean the cultures associated with top, middle and bottom.  A woman who has absorbed the culture of the middle or upper class would probably show more refinement when rejecting a guy, but a woman acculturated with the lower class will likely be more crass.  But because of some levels of social mobility people from the lower classes have moved up and brought their culture with them.  There are plenty of very wealthy celebrities you can look at who are upper class by income but lower class by behavior.   I'm sure some people with low self esteem might worry if an unattractive person approached them that they were somehow now in some lower imaginary 'league' but I really don't think it's that high a percentage.   That's because you've never tried to seduce women.  If you'd like a woman's perspective on what it's like being a man you can try this great book on the topic.  Here is a video with the author about the book."

ForeverAlone,3dyt4h,bejeweledlyoness,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"No, manners and courtesy do not correspond with social class.   Which is why I specified the culture of those classes and not income.  Here is a great book on America's social classes and how they behave differently.  Here is a summary of the book and here is an article about the book.   I have seen poor people who were incredibly polite and mannerly and rich people who were mean and snobby.   I never denied that in my original post.  Rather I'm talking about general social trends.  Some exceptions does not invalidate the general rule.  Yes, we can generalize about people, if we couldn't then social science wouldn't work.  See links above."
ForeverAlone,3dyt4h,PuzzlePirate,7,Mon Jul 20 23:21:47 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously I can't claim to know the thought process of most women but I have to  say for me and my friends we're a lot more worried about personal safety than how the exchange is placing us on a social structure. Also, I'd be worried about hurting the persons feelings, though I've learned to be firm (but polite) when I say I'm not interested.   Also, speaking if that, a problem arises in the difference between how boy and girls are raised. Boys are told to ""Go for it"" and ""be forward"" and ""don't take no for an answer"" while girls are told to be polite. Often a girl will signal in a non-firm manner and the guy will take this as playing hard to get and push harder. The girl then interprets this as 'creepy' as she was trying to send him signals that she wasn't interested and he kept pushing. I am a big fan of honesty in relationships to avoid that but unfortunately I see it happening a lot, particularly in young people.   Lastly, though this is an insane thing to say on the internet ... Please don't assume I've never seduced ladies."

ForeverAlone,3dyt4h,oliviabix,-5,Mon Jul 20 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"""Nobody I know call guys creeps.""  Don't know what circles you live in.  I've seen the ""creeps"" be insulted, shamed, spat on, beaten up and more on a regular basis even if they tried their best to completely avoid eye-contact with anyone(yes I am talking about myself).  Why were they ""creeps"" then?Because they were ugly, unpopular and maybe glanced at a popular girl once.  Anyway, I think catcalling itself isn't really a problem, again as someone who has been insulted a lot in his life I find it weird that someone would get upset about someone expressing attraction towards you, it may be in a shit way but at the end of the day they still express attraction.  But well, I'm sure that girls, especially if they are drunk and out in groups would never catcall a guy and if then people would be really upset about it and shame them for doing so..oh wait no if a guy would complain about being catcalled he'd be ridiculed and called a bitch, just to put things in perspective.  That video with the girl walking through NYC blew up and it did shock me, but not because of the catcallers but because of that guy that followed her around creepily for 5 minutes or so, that was fucked up but the catcalling itself?Meh.  I'll go out on a limb here and say if being catcalled is a big enough problem in your life that you'd campaign against it(which some people apparently do), then you have a really good life."
ForeverAlone,3dyt4h,IskuSeagull,4,Mon Jul 20 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"Catcalling is just one of those micro-aggressions that happen a lot in the lives of women from puberty till 50/60. A steady drip of water can wear away a rock, so too do these things. In rarer occasions, it goes from catcalling to threats of bodily harm or rape and then on to actual physical violence. However, women aren't mind-readers; we don't know which guys will stop at catcalling, which will stop at insults and which will decide to hurt us."
ForeverAlone,3dyt4h,bejeweledlyoness,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"Ok I understand the fear part, if someone catcalls you at night for example if you are just out alone to go wherever, that can be scary.  But the thing is this..would you give up being attractive just to not get catcalled anymore?  Go and ask all ugly girls you know and ask them if they'd want to be attractive but get catcalled in return, they'd all say ""hell fkin yes are you kidding me?""  It's more like a tall guy going ""oh shit I'm so tall I don't have any legspace in planes"", would the tall guy give up his height for more legspace in planes?Hell fkin no.  Really, ask yourself what comes with being an attractive girl, people are nice to you, teachers treat you better in school, better chances for a job, getting approached by attractive guys, being attractive is just better at the end of the day.  And then as a price you pay being catcalled and having to reject guys that you aren't interested in but approach you.  I get that catcalling is annoying, but if you get catcalled a lot and are attractive, you didn't draw the short end of the stick."

Again, catcalling does not equal good attention. Your idea that catcalling is a a price to be paid for being attractive is bad. Here's what happened to one woman in 2014 when she rejected the advances of a catcaller (http://blackmillennials.com/2014/10/08/when-catcalling-kills-you/). Let me summarize it for you, she was shot to death and five others were also injured. This is just one story, there are tons more.  Is the possibility of rape, injury, or death an adequate 'price' for being attractive?"

That's not the reaction I get and not the inner monologue I would think they're having. It's more like ""This ugly guy actually thinks he could ever have a shot with me?""

If he starts to follow me, I now have a totally different issue on my hands. More than likely, no on else is going to help me so either I have to: be faster & run, run into a business/building with security there and make it their problem or turn around & confront him. Now think about having to make these kinds of decisions in seconds whenever someone catcalls you starting at puberty (13/14) until you are no longer sexually attractive to the opposite sex (maybe 50 - 60). And to the people who say, well, why didn't you just acknowledge him: 1) just because I'm outside means that I must engage with anyone and 2) if I acknowledge him then he feels like I'm giving him more attention and he has an invitation to take up my time."

On the other, they are yelling, kicking and screaming about the 'epidemic' of oppression and and harrassment they are supposedly subject to. And again, they claim the sole right of definition of what ""oppression"" and ""harrassment"" entail, going so far as to sue people over politely disagreeing on Twitter for 'harassment'.  Should you dare to suggest that this is hypocritical and unfair, you are an intensitive asshole at best and a woman-hating mysoginist at worst.

I used the 'keep your head down' strategy for years and people called me creepy a number of times. This was even to girls I had no interest in and ignored anyways."

I think women discriminating cat-callers by attractiveness is downright shameful, especially when they proceed to then make the argument that wearing scraps of cloth shouldn't draw any attention from men, even nonverbally. Calling unattractive people who notice a well- dressed woman ""creeps"" is just terrible. Women glance at men and comment on their clothing or bodies all the time, just usually not as publicly, probably a habit developed when women were seen as the more socially-reserved sex. Personally, I'm flattered when any guy checks me out, since if I'wearing revealing or dressy clothing, that was probably the point. He is not a creep unless of course I am one too."

With dating, you could do everything right and not have it go anywhere, or you could do everything wrong and have it pay off. It's more like gambling, really.

Even if they do settle for you they’ll be out the door as soon as a better option comes along. Even if you are in a serious, committed relationship and have kids etc. she’ll still do it because hedonism is all that counts now in social relationships now. The minute you stop making someone “feel good about themselves”, i.e. being their own personal human equivalent to crack, she’ll piss off.

You don't have to drink yourself, but if you do, you'll discover that drinking doesn't automatically lead to violence. For some people it does, but for most it doesn't. You'll have to learn to separate that.  Alternately, I know a few people who were alcoholics and have since stopped. They have no reason to judge others, but they avoid drinking situations out of fear for their own (loss of) self control. They still find dry activities, and other people to do dry activities with.

ForeverAlone,3dwd8w,Hideawayhuman,6,Mon Jul 20 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"From what I've observed the 3 key factors to getting a date are in order of importance:   Physical Attractiveness Material Possessions / Wealth Being personable / entertaining   I think most FA's are likely going to pick #1 as being their primary problem. I know that's the one I'd pick. I really seem to put women off for some reason that I've never understood, and I'm starting to realize I'm just ugly."
ForeverAlone,3dwd8w,north_america_sucks,7,Mon Jul 20 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"As someone with lots of wealth I believe 2 and 3 should be swapped. I also think way more people would blame their being FA on 1 and 3 over 2. I'm not saying that it isn't talked about because it can help make up for FA qualities. Though it won't make up for it, if your 1 or 3 are severely lacking. But being poor is rarely the reasoning for being FA, which develops from the first 1 and 3."
ForeverAlone,3dwd8w,Hideawayhuman,2,Mon Jul 20 04:39:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, but in addition #3 may need to be first. Lots of people with average and even below average looks don't have a problem. Maybe some people are so unattractive that it's a problem, but I'm even a bit skeptical of that. Part of physical attractiveness also reflects the person's mental state. I can't imagine a person having much success if they're physically attractive, but not pleasant to be around due to their personality."

I'm not saying they are necessarily good and pleasant people overall.  They might be horrible, psychologically abusing and even beating their partner. However, there must have been some nice bait at the beginning which got the relationship started, and which keeps it going.

ForeverAlone,3dwd8w,lonesomeloser234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"Most people can have fun with another person just hanging out on a couch and doing nothing. They can go to the bar and buy cheap beers and have a good laugh. Money does cloak a lack of personality. Sure, I can take someone to a fancy play or nice dinner. But in the end it does little in the long run to make me interesting. Places you go and things you do can be interesting but your company in those places really makes the difference. The only time money really changes the tides is when you have a ridiculous amount. I don't mean $1 m. We are talking 'let's take the private jet to xxx city and grab dinner' kind of rich. And even that might be fun only for a bit. That makes a bigger difference with lack of attractiveness. You get them to go out based on possessions and keep them based on possessions and personality."
ForeverAlone,3dwd8w,beebacked,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:47 2015 UTC,Sure that's possible. All 3 values are insanely important. If you're overly deficient in any of them it definitely creates issues.   I also disagree about being being megarich to make a difference. The lifestyle difference you're offering from say $50k a year to $200k a year is absolutely massive. Being afforded the opportunity to live much much more comfortably is extremely attractive to people.
ForeverAlone,3dwd8w,lonesomeloser234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, $50k and $200k is a big difference and you can do much more. My point wasn't that there isn't a difference but the uniqueness of what you can do isn't that great. Sure, you can go to nicer restaurants and you live in a nicer house and part of town. Yet, a $200k can't really do anything that a guy on say $75k can't do (maybe a slight step down and maybe not as often). Even a $50k guy can do those things on occasion. Sure, having no money is a big killer but having little money usually isn't a deal breaker. They are a thing to over come sure but it's not the same as not having a personality. I live in a place where beach bums that go to cheap dive bars get a lot of women. They are fun to be around but make very little money. The guys that make a lot with little personality are often single. I have met plenty of them."

Also, yeah people are attracted to success and that usually precedes wealthy. Successful people have more money. Money is an indicator of success. People want that.

ForeverAlone,3dwd8w,PuzzlePirate,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"If you have a base of good friends they may look at you weird and think you are being rude, but they will still be your friend.   After that you just have to be able to say stuff jokingly. By jokinly while smiling and laughing.   My theory of people liking you is that its basically a bell curve. Now on the far left and right are people who really like you and people who really hate you.   So you think if you are nice you will shift the entire curve toward people liking you, but in reality simply being pleasent only serves to make the curve thinner. In other words peopel who both really hate/like you shrink.   The thing about people who really like you, they stay around and become your lifelong friends, while people who hate you simply leave. This goes for women too (I think).   So you need to be polarizing which means taking social risks like sarcasm if your goal is to make good friends and meet women."

Judging from what OP said it seems clear that this ""Christian"" has a very distorted idea of Christianity - i.e. The Prosperity Gospel. Despite the fact the Bible actually states that Christians should NOT expect to have it easy - quite the opposite really - he is preaching that being a Christian will ""solve all your problems"".  Indeed, not only is this unsupported on a scriptural basis, but the way he is going about it is also wrong. Preaching to vulnerable people that ""they're going to hell"" is one of the worst things you can do to get your message across. Indeed, once again the Bible says that the best way to preach the Gospel is to act like Jesus did to others.   So basically as to ""why"" he cares the idea in Christianity isn't to just look at people who are obviously sinners but everyone - the rich, the poor, the depressed etc. However, the way he has gone about it is not only an extremely poor method but also he is preaching poor scripture that is actually doing damage rather than helping."

Using the views of someone like that as a stand to mock an entire belief system is like me using someone like TheAmazingAtheist to mock all atheists. It's cheap and shows inability to go for anything but easy targets - exactly what we on FA keep complaining about people doing to us.  Also, every response I've read here from him is - as you said - filled with atheist rhetoric. Calling people ""Jesus freaks"" is a cheap tactic to try and belittle the other side. How hypocritical that we in FA how taking part in this whilst forever bemoaning the fact that others try to belittle us with name calling. I just find it so funny that for a sub where we talk a lot about how many people don't care about us and we are constantly belittled (and that happens a lot to us I'm not doubting it) we are now belittling and mocking one of the people who actually is trying to help. Indeed I agree his methods are poor - very poor indeed and actual have the reverse effect to what he intends - but the guy himself clearly actually cares and is trying to help. If we're going to suddenly start mocking people like that then maybe we should stop whinging about the fact no one ever talks to or cares about us.  Then again I'm on reddit so I don't know why I'm wasting my time arguing this. It's very simple, pro-atheist insults with no substance to them get upvoted and anything trying to defend the other side gets downvoted, regardless of how much substance it has to it - indeed that has already happened to me, I've got a bunch of downvotes without any actual responses. Indeed, I don't care about downvotes (I wouldn't post this if I did) but just downvoting someone who disagrees with you is cheap.  Ah well though think I'm done with /r/foreveralone here.

The potential loss of love, is devastating.  I don't think my brain is compatible to feel love anymore, as it has built up a natural defense to this feeling.   Even my love for my parents and siblings has fleeted dramatically. I believe the early experience of true heartbreak, shaped my perception through my developmental years, leading to the wall that's been built sky high in my brain."

It's hard to reconcile wanting them to want you and also knowing they will be happier with someone else. In the end I always keep it to myself and let them end up with someone better.

ForeverAlone,3ds535,oliviabix,7,Sun Jul 19 10:48:05 2015 UTC,"When I used to show up for the dates, me being alone and stood up was so common that hostesses and managers eventually accused me of lying about having a date. They legitimately thought I was trying to milk them for sympathy for a free meal or free drinks. (I was comped meals and drinks before after being stood up early in the days I tried to date others.)  I never got an angry call from a woman berating me for not showing up. I never got texts or calls wondering where I was. I've never been accused of not showing up. I have received calls the following day, ""I should have called you, I'm sorry I couldn't make it. No, I don't know when I'll be free again.""  Some women just seem to find it easier to tell me ""sure, I'll have lunch with you"" and not show up instead of telling me, ""I'm not interested, please don't ask me again."""
ForeverAlone,3ds535,jlking3,2,Sun Jul 19 11:18:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's awful. What terrible behaviour. I'm sorry to hear that.   Though, I'd not make dates and then not go. If someone stood me up I wouldn't text them afterwards so you'll never be sure they're not there.   Why do you make dates if you know you're not gonna go, if you don't mind me asking?"
ForeverAlone,3ds535,Jack_Sophmore,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I make the date excitedly, but then during the week, I start to get a feeling that I'm going to get stood up, and then when I call or text the day of the date to confirm, I don't get an answer back. At that point, I'm pretty sure she's changed her mind and just doesn't want to tell me."
ForeverAlone,3ds535,oliviabix,2,Sun Jul 19 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"That's crap. Does this happen often?   I obviously can't speak for all women or even those my age but I don't know anyone who'd behave that way. That's appallingly rude.   I'm totally clutching at straws for a reason here, do you by any chance text a lot between setting the date and the date itself? I don't mean to immediately throw this right back on you but it's so weird that multiple women agree to a date and then ghost. Do you take a ""Keep asking until they say yes"" approach to getting the date? I've had a guy not take no for an answer a few times and while I'm forward enough to tell them to hit the road some girls are rather intimidated and might agree and then just not reply.   Either way, ghosting is not how adults should behave."
ForeverAlone,3ds535,oliviabix,2,Sun Jul 19 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think the first time, I might have texted a couple of times expressing my excitement, but after getting stood up from that first time, I stopped texting except to confirm. The last time I did this, I didn't even text to confirm, and just assumed she wouldn't show up. I asked the manager at the coffeeshop (who knew me) to send me a text if my date showed up that time, and to let her know that I'd be there shortly (and give her whatever coffee drink she wants while she waits for me). He didn't text me back and the following day, he told me there was no one who came in and appeared to be looking for someone.  I'm sure it's something about me that makes it easy to say ""yes"" and then have regrets. It's just easier to accept being alone than to spend the energy to change whatever it is that makes that happen. I'm too old to care about this kind of stuff anymore anyway. The longer I avoid putting myself in a position where I can be rejected, the easier is it to accept not having someone who wants to share life experiences."

ForeverAlone,3dt4pe,_urgeto_,18,Sun Jul 19 05:04:04 2015 UTC,"46 here. In 4 years I'm probably just going to buy a cardigan and spend whatever time I have left reading all the books I still haven't read.  Or hire a hitman on the Internet to kill me. He'll get a bonus payment (held in escrow or something like that) if I don't see it coming.  I'm 50/50 on which one it'll be. I've made my peace with suicide and got past all wider moral qualms. As an omni-failure, by rights I should have offed myself years ago when I understood what was happening and what I'd become. But I still got much pleasure and happiness out of just being alive ,and that baseline contentment with.. well, with virtually nothing at all really – still serves me well and keeps me going.   Suicide is a basic human right for all. The main argument against it is that your life is somehow not your possession – that it belongs to your friends and family (lol), or to society, or to God, whoever. I can't remember offhand which philosopher nailed the rebuttal: that your life is the only thing you genuinely possess, and saying you have no right (or even marginal rights) as to its ultimate dispensation is the same as saying you're the property of others, i.e. a slave.  I'm the sort who likes to toy with the idea that I'm toying with the idea of suicide. Hesse in Steppenwolf defines a suicide as anyone who is instinctively certain that suicide is how their life will end eventually, one day. In that sense, I am a suicide in waiting. In another, completely radical sense, I get a lot of contentment out of not being with people and just pursuing my solitary interests and even being bizarrely happy much of the time.  Methods are a pain in the backside and a nagging worry. Google is rigged to show you a couple of pages of 'why Method X won't work or be completely horrible'. You have to dig deeper and even then nothing appeals. The great Dorothy Parker sums it up:   Razors pain you;  Rivers are damp;  Acids stain you;  And drugs cause cramp.  Guns aren’t lawful;  Nooses give;  Gas smells awful;  You might as well live."
ForeverAlone,3dt4pe,HermannHermann,3,Sun Jul 19 07:40:03 2015 UTC,"Heh. That poem is very nice. I'd like to think that if I were to suicide, I'd jump from a very high place. Preferably in nature. There are some beautiful spots out there to kill yourself. And what better way to go than feeling the adrenaline rush as you fall?  But anyway, I really liked that poem, man. I wish I knew more poetry. I know some stuff I enjoy a lot, but I seldom have the patience to try out new things. Would you tell me your favorite poems?"
ForeverAlone,3dt4pe,bredontopology,4,Sun Jul 19 10:36:28 2015 UTC,"That's a huge question. Poetry is the FA art form IMO. Your best bet is to grab an anthology of 20th Century poetry and jump around until you hear a chord you like, and see where it takes you. I was led to Dylan Thomas, AE Housman, and others that way. They're great starting poets.   And this is a great FA-friendly poem:   Sanctity   To be a poet and not know the trade  To be a lover and repel all women  Twin ironies by which great saints are made  The agonising pincer-jaws of Heaven   Patrick Kavanagh"
ForeverAlone,3dt4pe,HermannHermann,2,Sun Jul 19 10:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yea this is point that I am arriving at. The moral issues seem to be settled, but it is still too permanent of choice to make, especially with family who are living. Also I am too scared to deal with the available methods. I feel it is easier just to string it along until natural death."
ForeverAlone,3dt4pe,HermannHermann,2,Sun Jul 19 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"I've got one family member still living who cannot be living when I do it. I will not be the cause of a horrific episode in somebody else's life. So until the point arrives when this one person – very elderly and frail – is departed, suicide is something for the future.  I'm scared of all the methods too. I want it to be 100% reliable and guaranteed. I don't want any mental terror. I don't want any physical pain. I want it to be quick so there's no chance to change my mind. There's no method that fits all 4 cowardly criteria, not even shooting. So when the time comes I know I'll have to be brave in some aspect. I'd settle for quick and certain and take the terror/pain.  The above was all pretty much decided over the course of the last 6 years. Once you hit 40 it brings things into focus. The early 40s for me were a time of great anxiety and panic and flapping around trying to see if it's really all over. It's really all over now. There's no coming back from here. It's not technically impossible, of course, but coming back requires the possession of a psychological and emotional toolset that I simply don't have and can't get. Looking back, at 35 I still had a chance, in romantic and professional terms, so you should get cracking.  I still love my books and TV and movies and radiant summer days like today too much for suicide right now. But I've given myself total permission and authority to do it at any time in the future that I see fit."

ForeverAlone,3dt4pe,I_BUGGER_HEDGEHOGS,16,Mon Jul 20 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'm four years away from fifty, and I can tell you that the idea of suicide gets more...obvious. I don't know what you mean by 'wrong', but I assume it's vaguely something to do with giving up when there's still hope.   In that case, yes, it gets less wrong. There is a level of absurdity to it, eventually--the whole notion of getting my shit together and starting a romantic life. It seemed pretty late when I was 20. I had missed the boat to some degree then. By 35, as you know, it seems really late, when other people your age have kids who have had more dates than you.   By 50, you're talking about AARP and dentures and gout, while trying to do things most people did when they were 16. There's nothing wrong with romance at 50. There's something deeply weird about a first one at that age. You're not a late bloomer. A late blooming flower doesn't wait till the middle of winter. You're just a failed experiment.   You may have fifteen years to desperately rescue the situation, but I wouldn't count on it. Forty will arrive soon. Very soon. Remember thirty?  That was what, six weeks ago?  Yeah. Forty will arrive very soon indeed, and then things go quickly from 'late' to 'very late' to 'over'.    Suicide becomes less about the dramatic gesture of hopeless angst, and more a simple, serious, unfortunate but obvious next step. Whatever games I once played in my head, toying with the idea of suicide, are over now. Now it's just the obvious thing to do. Things don't get better at this point. I've missed the boat.   If you have a chance to live before you die, do it now. Do whatever crazy shit you have to do before it's too late."
ForeverAlone,3dt4pe,HermannHermann,5,Sun Jul 19 07:52:55 2015 UTC,"I endorse everything here. The simple obviousness of what'll soon be required constantly amazes me. Here and now I can enjoy good health and whatever contentment I get from books and computer games and movies etc. 50 isn't a rigid cutoff for me, but I think it won't be long after.  I gave up on romance finally and definitively some time ago, so for me it's the expiration of interest in other things and/or decline in health that'll be the main instigating factor."

It's not there to help you offload the practical, legal and emotional responsibility of the act to medical professionals.  Most of them chose their jobs to help people live, not to be angels of death.  That being said, it's your choice, and as I'm concerned, a right.  If it's a difficult decision: good.

ForeverAlone,3dsply,yung1dzz,4,Sun Jul 19 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"The reason you fail socially is because of your blatant incongruency. If you're quiet sometimes, but super talkative other times, what message does that send? I'll  tell you. It lets everyone who interacts with you know that you like to talk, but you filter around certain people/situations. The result: you effectively broadcast your self-perceived worthlessness to the world.  By getting over excited, you also convey that you're emotionally unstable and manic depressive. Then when you go all quiet and moody after getting teased you reinforce their perception of you. ""He got all quiet after we made fun of his laugh. What a bitch.""  Bottom line is that care too much about what people think of you. It shows. You need to either learn to care less or learn to hide how much you care."

It's odd because there are some people that genuinely really like me when I act super excited.  For example, in my work there are some people who get excited when I'm in their shift and a few who even wanna hang out with me outside of work.  There are also people who literally said ""pustuliofoolio you are way too much for me to handle and need to go away.""  On top of that, people have built a culture around me.  I have horrible hearing so every now and then I go ""What?!"" and that became a thing at work.  Also people mimic the weird phrases I say. Of course I NEVER get shifts with the people I like so I spend all my time at work completely quiet unless I have to discuss something work related.  On online dating I come off as this over the top wanna be rockstar guy but once they meet me, they find that I can be pretty quiet.   Then I'm too boring...  There's also the other hand where I'm too silly to the point where no one can take me seriously.  I can't help but feel if I somehow managed to start dating someone, that I would be a complete embarrassment to them.    It's frustrating because people are either bored of me or annoyed of me.

You still feel romantically interested to other people and want to love them and be together with them, you just dont care about having sex (and sometimes have an aversion to it like me). Indeed you could argue it makes it even worse because it seems a lot of people agree that one of the important points of a healthy relationship is sex, but you cant really provide that so well (indeed I dont even want to), and so it could mess up your chances with women further.  Then again I only speak for my side as I have no idea what it must be like to constantly want to have sex, and so maybe it is better like this."

It's also important, though, that sex has a social aspect. I just feel like a total fucking loser because I cannot have this experience which I desire so intensely when nearly everyone else does.

ForeverAlone,3dr529,IskuSeagull,2,Sat Jul 18 17:56:04 2015 UTC,"The brain is an amazing organ that can fix itself. With CBT-training with a therapist.   Hell you don't even need a therapist, it's not like they wave their wands.Anyone can make themselves go through therapy. If you practice introversion and self-awareness, of your strengths, weaknesses, insecurities, social fears you can make up your training.    I once read in a book about dating, about these 2 guys and their trick to absolute confidence. You won't believe the extent of their effort. They spent 2 weeks, going around without taking a shower, dressed in ridiculous clothing like a thong and a dildo, they spent those 2 weeks living their life like that. Being out in public looking like absolute fools. And once it was done any and all trace of anxiety had been nuked. I know that this works because I have tried it myself. I had social anxiety as well.At some point I forced myself to randomly sing in front of people in public. And it worked. It changed me on a deep subconscious way.It was not a 'Haha-moment', 'Now I get it!'. I just changed, as if the fundamentals of my body moved on its own.    Anxiety is very primitive.Your body believes it's in danger (literally the sort of danger you might die of) which is why intense forceful exposure can let your body know it's actually not in danger.It has no choice but to recognize the fear is baseless. These guys walked around looking like fools for 2 weeks, probably made fun of by a shitton strangers...but what doesn't kill you make you stronger. They ended not giving a shit anymore.    When you know that your mind can be altered by your own actions, that your mind is bendable, there's no limit, you can change yourself.It only matters how much you want it and what you're willing to sacrifice. (these guys sacrifice their dignity for 2 weeks)    If you're ever desperate. Try what these guys have done.For 2 weeks in the most ridiculous outfit that you can think of, that would get you comments from strangers everywhere. After just 2 weeks you will be a completely different person."

They may assume people learn these things as they grow up by other life experiences, and assume that when you are in your 30's or 40's you will still have these skills and qualities appealing to someone of a similar age, despite having spending your life alone. 3) Relationships really do come naturally and grow organically among the social circles they run in.  They have no reasons believe it should be any different for us, but that it's simply ""not our time yet"" if we didn't naturally run into anyone yet."

This sub tends to focus on relationships, but I personally believe that making a couple of friends should be step number one for FAs. Having a social circle is not a guarantee to finding a relationships, but at this point we just need social experience and acceptance, period, from wherever we can get it. Start with that first and see where it goes. And I guarantee that a couple of bros will make you happier and will do more to get you a girl than buying some new clothes, or working out, or whatever generic ""do something!"" bullshit you hear will."

Electrical engineering, 90% placement rate and a good shot at jobs that get you 90-100k with a bachelor's. Mechanical is the same way, chemical, nuclear, and even a load of the technology majors. Staying for a master's is unnecessary if you play it smart.

We all try to give advice to help our friends based on our experience and perception of the world, and in parts in which we are not experience we extrapolate based on our existing experience.  From the viewpoint of people who are able to form relationship normally in daily life, an extrapolation of their experience is that love happens spontaneously in daily life by random chance, and therefore if it hasn't happened for someone yet by probability (since it happened for them more than a couple of times and they considered themselves an average person) it will likely happen in the future.    So I really just see it as an attempt to be nice and not confrontational, and may even make perfect sense from their perspective.

People are generally compatible enough to date other people. You don't need to work out for 2 years to date someone. That's escapism in and of itself. The things that do stop you from dating are high standards and/or an anxiety-prone temperament. Anxiety matters because it's not fun to go out chasing girls when you've seen the dark side of social and sexual human behavior. You're either afraid that they are going to pull some number on you like sleep with another guy, or angry at them for the time they did. You've been redpilled, if you will.  There's also a bit of luck involved. Some people who are sensitive to the world like this get tail while they are young, and so they grow up a little more embedded in their social/sexual network.

ForeverAlone,3drmgw,yung1dzz,2,Sun Jul 19 07:42:43 2015 UTC,"As I slowly creep from early 20's towards 30 the amount of contact I have with my ""friends"" is decreasing exponentially. I was never a fixture in anyone's life and now that people are getting married and having kids I'm among the first things to get replaced.   Oh they'll call me when they need help with something that I can fix or if they want something from me, but I'm basically non-existent in their lives at this point.   I guess I could try to make new friends, but after college this process becomes a lot more complicated and most people aren't looking for friends,.   Anyways, point is, that not all friendships, even the best ones, will withstand the test of time. Guys find a girl, settle down, and then you just hardly ever seen them anymore.   It does suck. A lot of things suck. It's not a bad reason to be upset, it's actually a pretty appropriate response. I cry sometimes for much more trivial things.   Worst part about FA is that I just don't have anyone to lean on when shit gets real. I just suck it up and keep marching. Every time I have to do it things get a little more difficult."
