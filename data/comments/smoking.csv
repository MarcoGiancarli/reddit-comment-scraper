smoking,3e37pe,proffelytizer,2,Tue Jul 21 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"It was built as a brick oven. My family used it for roasts some years back. It is built from firebricks that were in a glassblowing kiln. I'm slowly learning how to control it and finding out where the hotspots are. The ting is, it takes hours for the temperature to stabilise, it gets reallllly stable but by then, the cook is over. I have found that the best thing to do is to start a raging fire at the beginning of the cook for two hours. next time I might start the fire in the cooking chamber.  It is ideal as a smoker since the fire chamber is a couple of feet beneath the smoke chamber. The smoke chamber is arched so it circulates heat and smoke very well. It's got quite a tall smokestack.

smoking,3e37pe,muhaski,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"I salted the hunks o' meat a day before and rubbed them with Memphis Dust the day of the smoke. I started these off after I preheated the oven with some carob wood (very abundant where I live). Started smoking at 7:30 am. They went on at 225F and gradually went up to 250F throughout the course of 8 hours. I was planning on leaving them uncrutched because it appeared that they didn't hit the stall but 8 hours in they did (one of them at 160F one of them at 175F). So I crutched them and put the coldest one nearer to the fire and turned it up to 275F. Pulled them after 10hr total, both at 195F. I left them in the cooler for 2 hours before serving and they were still piping hot.  Bonus: Those are smoked and braised Maltese sausages. They are heavily seasoned pork sausages: mainly coriander and salt."
smoking,3e37pe,muhaski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:35 2015 UTC,Is the collar similiar in texture and taste to a butt or what?  I've never seen it.
smoking,3e37pe,Vuelhering,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"I have learned that Collar+shoulder = pork butt where I live.  The pork butt has a flat bone running through it. Where i live, pork shoulder is the side with the skin and fat cap. The collar is the side with the better marbling and the money muscle etc. It's a very neat, round cut, easy to cook and yields much better meat than the shoulder since the shoulder has no marbling. It is just a fat cap and a lean muscle."
smoking,3e37pe,Fat_Head_Carl,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Also, where I live they always come seperately. I've never seen the shoulder and the collar both attached to the bone."

smoking,3e30gc,Werewolfdad,6,Tue Jul 21 15:53:21 2015 UTC,"This is what I started with to see if I was interested enough in smoking to spend $1000 or more on something better.  For $60, it's actually a lot of value for the money and it's amazing what you'll be able to produce out of it.  Your friends and family likely won't notice the difference on simple stuff.  That being said, it's really a tedious pain in the ass.  Part of that can be fun if you want to sit and play with the fire and vents and shifting meat around all day long.  The metal is incredibly thin.  That means a) Terrible heat retention.  You breath on it wrong or the wind blows the wrong way and temps can drop well out of the cooking zone.  Open the lid for more than a couple seconds and your temps drop 30 degrees.  b) It's not going to last very long and definitely not if you leave it outside in the rain or snow.  It's really quite small.  You can barely fit a full packer brisket and a water pan in it.  A big turkey, probably not.  Also, because the heat varies so much across the surface, that brisket is going to come out uneven.  Or if you have multiple chickens or ribs in there, you're going to have to constantly rotate them and learn the hot spots.  That being said, I primarily use it for ducks and pork butts and it's fine for that.  The firebox is tiny and the door is tiny.  A good sized log will not fit in there lengthwise.  So you either have to cut your logs in half or use lump or charcoal.  There's not enough space to load it up with fuel for a consistent long smoke.  Cleaning it out is kind of more of a pain than you'd like it to be.  There are lots of improvements people have made, mostly in the addition of tuning plates and extending the vent lower with dryer hose and sealing it up well.  If you're into tinkering with that kind of stuff, it's certainly the most affordable platform to do so.  For me, it has taught me that I absolutely do want the $1000 smoker and there are good reasons they cost what they do... but I absolutely do not smoke enough to make that kind of investment.  If you're looking for an offset purely to play with and you like your Masterbuilt, I wouldn't hesitate."
smoking,3e30gc,triit,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:11 2015 UTC,"There are definitely much better rigs out there for a little more money.  FWIW, Amazing Ribs is not a fan of these smokers at all.  Or any cheap offset for that matter  If you only want to spend $100ish, a Weber Kettle is a much better investment, imo.  They are very competent smokers for small cooks.  If you're just cooking for 2-4 people and/or trying this out to see if you like it, its hard to go wrong with starting out on a Weber 22"" Kettle."

smoking,3e30gc,Unoid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"I use one. I'd advise forming an aluminum disposible tray  between the fire box into the cooking section to shield the meat and disperse the smoke better.  also some high temp silicone will help keep seals better.  Edit: I've never been able to smoke for more than 4 hours at a time, the charcoal/wood ashe piles up too fast. I've had average success with it."

smoking,3e30gc,zyrenthian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:16 2015 UTC,"It's pretty though to keep the temperature consistent. But the trick is to start the hot coals and fire on the side closest to the opening and have cold coals lining the other side so that. To add to that, you have to look at your gauges a whole lot more than WSMs.  So if I where you, I would spend a little bit more and try to get a WSM from Homedepot since they will be a lot easier to smoke with."

smoking,3e343q,MadBotanist,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"I've been doing it this way for the past 6 months or so.  Simplifies the process and makes the house smell incredible.    Only detriment I'd maybe claim is on my pork shoulders, I guess my gas oven has more humidity and the bark doesn't seem to form quite as well.  I've been experimenting with running it a bit hotter, bumping the oven to 275 or so, toward the end of cooking it with good results.  Been doing a 2/1.5/however long it takes with ribs this way with great results."
smoking,3e343q,spyyked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, my big concern was that the bark formation would suffer with less smoking.  Especially if half your surface area is resting on a baking pan instead of the wire rack.  Using a convection oven and setting your meat directly on the oven rack with a pan on the lower level could also be a fix"
smoking,3e343q,spyyked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"Oh glad you mentioned the rack idea.  That's actually similar to what I do.

smoking,3e2ceu,carlksufan,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:18 2015 UTC,The biggest reason why I don't like to use kingsford for smoking has nothing to do with the flavor or temperatures but the amount of ash it produces. It seems like by the time I get halfway through a cook I'm losing airflow to the coals and if I bump my smoker just right the ash goes air born and gets on the food. Switched to pump and I don't have the ash problems any more.
smoking,3e2ceu,reddit-mandingo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's my only complaint as well.  It burns long and slow and consistently in my WSM.  Since I use a WSM, I've found it to be pretty easy to just pull the whole smoker body & lid apart from the bottom charcoal section during a cook, set the top sections aside, and give the bottom a couple little taps with my foot to get the ash & coals to re-settle in the bottom.  After the ash stops flying (only takes a few seconds) I put the smoker back together & carry on with my cook.  I figure I lose less heat than even opening the lid."

All you need to do is learn how to set up for 2 zone cooking in your grill and you're fine.    A snake method will work, as well as putting a water pan in the middle of your charcoal grate, and coals on either side of the water pan.  You should be fine with what you have for quite a while, at least until you decide you have to start cooking for larger groups.  Here's an idea of what I'm talking about with the water pan.  You don't need those charcoal baskets, but they are $15 at Lowe's/Home Depot, so you might want to measure them and see if they'll fit in your kettle.  Another idea that can work"

You have the option of wrapping the butt in foil and it will help it get over the stall quicker, but its not required.  The fastest ""conventional"" way (I've found) is smoke @ 275* for 4 hours, wrap in double foil, and go for another 3-4 (until temp).

smoking,3e2c6z,WunDumGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:34:29 2015 UTC,Thanks! Can't wait to read through that.
smoking,3e2c6z,WunDumGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:34 2015 UTC,"It's full of good stuff, and it's fun to read. There's one section where he tests out soaking wood and concludes, ""Look like the water barely penetrated the wood after soaking all night. Weird! Maybe that's why they make BOATS out of wood! So don't soak your wood."""
smoking,3e2c6z,myk26,4,Tue Jul 21 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the party! You're rarely going to find one ""right"" answer to your questions. For example:   I would never soak my wood chips/chunks! But I know smokers that always do! Some cook ribs using the 3-2-1 method (3 hours smoked, 2 hours wrapped, 1 hour sauced). But I'm not a fan of wrapping, and have found great results doing a 4-1 method (smoked/sauced)."
smoking,3e2c6z,TheDahktor,3,Tue Jul 21 13:16:57 2015 UTC,Three questions:  What's your favorite sauce?   How often should you put wood chips in?   How often should you put more hot coals in?
smoking,3e2c6z,myk26,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:28 2015 UTC,"As /u/myk26 referenced, don't soak your wood chips.  All soaking your wood chips does is make it longer before they produce smoke, before they'll smoke they need to dry out.  The billow of white smoke you see coming from them is mainly steam tinted with a little wood flavor, so, don't soak your wood.  You don't need much for wood, maybe 8-10 ounces depending on how strong of a wood you select and your personal tastes.  Put on about 4 ounces when the ribs go on, once the thin, almost clear smoke stops put on another 4 ounces (or 5/5).  Record how much you put on, adjust on your next cook.  You may want more or less smoke, just add more or less wood next time.  Sauce, some people sauce..some don't.  A lot of people here make their own, but really, until you get into that there's nothing wrong with a store bought.  Before I was making sauce, Sweet Baby Rays was my go to but tread lightly as it's pretty sweet.. The meat should always stand on its own.  After they're cooked, paint some on and put the ribs close to your fire/start up the grill if you're using a smoker, about 10-20 minutes depending.  Be careful not to burn/further cook them.. you're just trying to glaze the sauce.    Alternatively, don't sauce your ribs and serve sauce on the side.  All in what you want, and either way is correct!"
smoking,3e2c6z,mmuoio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/TheDahktor in this one. Don't go overboard on how much wood chips/chunks as many people don't like a (very)heavy smoke flavor. Trail-n-error is suggested in this regard.  How often to add coals? The trick is not to. I'm not saying you failed if you have to add, but adding coals mid-cook is something you general want to avoid.  Sauces? My base is SBR (Sweet Baby Rays), that I usually doctor up (adding mustard, Worcestershire, and hot-sauce). But I like to make my own at times too. And with a GREAT rib rub, I'll go w/o sauce entirely (served on side)."
smoking,3e2c6z,myk26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"If we're not supposed to add more charcoal mid-cook, what is the best way to make them last?  I did a pork butt over the weekend and had it going for about 11 hours and went through about 2/3 of a bag of charcoal.  I use a Brinkmann ECB smoker, so the charcoal pan isn't very large (I did add a grate for the briquettes to sit on so they're not just in the pan).  Is it about the placement?  I figured there are better ways than how I did it (adding more every 45-60 min) but I'm still learning."
smoking,3e2c6z,mmuoio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"Of course, sometimes you're limited by your equipment. When size is a restriction, one would have to rely on the Minion or Snake Method (snake methods are for lower temp cooks). The basic idea of Minion method is filling your coal basket with unlit coals, and then placing 6-12 burning coals atop them (giving you a slower burn, at the cost of slowly building heat).  Even still, adding fuel mid-cook is something that every smoker will have to deal with occasional. Just that we try to avoid it when we can."
smoking,3e2c6z,myk26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. Last time I tried making a ring around the pan and putting hot coals in one spot (to initiate a slow burn around the circle), but about 1-1.5 hours in, I still wasn't up to 225 (only about 150) and I had company coming over so I needed it to get hot so I could cook. Next time I smoke I'm gonna try some things to help the coals go longer."
smoking,3e2c6z,mmuoio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:21 2015 UTC,"What you described is commonly referred to as the Snake Method. Replace the ring of coals with a massive unlit pile of coals, and you have the Minion Method (easier to get the heat up, albeit slowly)"
smoking,3e2c6z,ifartedhaha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'll give the minion method a try next time, thanks for the help."
smoking,3e2c6z,synackrst,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"Just my few cents on sauce:  Make your own! tvwbb.com has a bunch of free recipes. A lot of people like Sweet Baby Ray's, but that's packed with high fructose corn syrup and other weird stuff. If you make your own, you can use organic ingredients, including organic ketchup. You can also style it to taste.  Just as a word of caution, sauce can taste completely different once it goes onto your meat, so you have to imagine what it's going to taste like.  Your other questions really depend on the kind of smoker/grill you have."
smoking,3e2c6z,RingRingBananaPwn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  Like you, I started out with an inexpensive water smoker.  Here are a few lessons and resources that were a big help to me.   You start out thinking it's all about sauces and rubs.  Those are great.  But it's really all about fire management.  Without a good fire, the sauce doesn't matter much. So, what's a ""good"" fire?  One that is burning cleanly at the desired temperature.  You want thin blue smoke, not heavy white, grey or black.  If you take a whiff of the smoke and it smells sweet and not unpleasant, you've got a good fire.  If it feels like it's burning your nostrils, that's a bad fire (or you stuck your nose into the flames - don't do that!).  Often, a good fire is a small fire. Learn to make changes in your fire gradually.  Temp is getting low?  Open the vents... just a little bit.  You can always open them farther five minutes from now.  Fuel running low?  Add just a little more, not half the bag of wood or charcoal.  Give the fire more oxygen until it catches and is burning cleanly.  Temp too hot?  Shut the vents just a little bit.  The goal is to keep a nice even temperature and a clean fire, not to continuously oscillate between overshooting and undershooting the temperature. The big thing is to learn how your cooker cooks.  You can read up on this, but there is no substitute for actually managing a fire and cooking some meat.  And most of your mistakes won't taste half bad. As others have posted, http://www.amazingribs.com is a great resource.  Also, Aaron Franklin's web video series is tremendous: http://www.pbs.org/food/web-shows/bbq-with-franklin/ Most of all, have fun.  Don't get overstressed about this or that fine point and miss the enjoyment of one of the best hobbies out there."

smoking,3e2c6z,LaTuFu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"Typically I'd say 5 hour's roughly but it all depends. You could try the 3-2-1 method..so 3 hours on the smoke at around 225f -250f then wrap in butcher paper or foil for 2 hours then finally back on the smoke for an hour un wrapped. I only do this with spare ribs as the ones I get are meaty as hell and the wrap really helps melt down that delicious collagen. Baby backs i'll just let em ride till tender. You don't have to soak the chips but it won't help if you do either..I've done both and just don't bother now as the end product is the same and it doesn't flair up or make the chips last longer. A couple of good handfuls at a time should be fine...Don't open the lid for at least 3 hour's ""If you're look,you ain't cookin""..then if you need more add extra. Another tip is don't put sauce on until the very end when they are ready as the sugars will burn. I did 2 racks on my kettle this weekend and took off after 6 hours..it was still going so ended up doing some Polish Keilbasa and some chicken for the kids...I got a good 8 hour's without topping up. Good luck with your first cook.  edit spelling"

smoking,3e2c6z,Mehknic,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh...not to take the wind out of your sails, but that is a pretty rough smoker.    You're definitely going to need to pay attention to it when you're cooking with it.  They're difficult to maintain steady temps and often require a lot of feeding.  Google ""El Cheapo Brinkman"" mods or ""ECB Mods"" to get an idea of what I'm talking about.  You can mod them if you have the time and desire, to get to a point where they are serviceable.  A lot of people simply give them away or trash them and move up to a WSM or another more consistent smoker.  But above all, don't get discouraged if you don't get consistent results out of your ECB.  It is very likely not you, but the equipment!  This was my first smoker and it almost cured me of trying to smoke meat myself.    Definitely a good call to do ribs with it.  Try a boston butt, too, it is a pretty forgiving cut of meat, too."
smoking,3e2c6z,mmuoio,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:01 2015 UTC,I figured as much what smoker would you recommend?
smoking,3e2c6z,teach_me_how_to_data,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:16 2015 UTC,"Just depends on what you're doing, how many people you'll typically be cooking for.  A lot of guys will tell you get a dedicated smoker like a Weber Smokey Mountain, a Pit Barrel Cooker, etc.  Nothing wrong with those units, don't get me wrong.  But if you're just starting out learning, and aren't sure that you'll want to keep doing it, getting a simple setup like a trusty ol' Weber Kettle grill is a great way to get started.  You can do a slow smoke on a 22"" Kettle for ribs, boston butt, even a brisket if you get bold with it.  And it will also work as a regular grill.  Some other cookers can be versatile, too, but the kettle is pretty simple to use, easy to maintain temps, and has a ton of accessories for it if you're so inclined.  Plus they're pretty cheap.  You can get one on CL for $50 usually, maybe even less.  You may decide that is all you need after that.  If not, the world of dedicated smokers awaits you, and you'll have more experience behind you to know what you're looking for."
smoking,3e2c6z,iland99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:58 2015 UTC,"I bought a Kettle over the winter for smoking and grilling and love it.  I'd also recommend using chunks instead of chips, and if you do decide to go with the Kettle, research the ""snake method"".  Either way I would go with pulled pork over ribs, as it's more foregiving (and you usually have leftovers)."

You need to seal the main chamber and the fire box, these units leak like a son of a bitch. You can get kits on line that have both gaskets and food grade RTV for $20-$30. -I bought a couple of thermometers and installed them at grate level. -I haven't put in a tuning plate yet, but i can see how it would help, there's a 10-20 degree difference from the right to the left side.

smoking,3dy9ew,Beatnicht,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:05 2015 UTC,The first smoker I ever had looked identical to this. Found it in the trash. Rightfully. It was a complete piece of shit and we almost set the yard on fire using it. Got the job done though. I feel like it was called a Cajun something or a Bayou something.
smoking,3dy9ew,dbrees,2,Mon Jul 20 17:03:24 2015 UTC,They cost $50 at home depot here in FL. My friend got one for free and put about $30 into it.
smoking,3dy9ew,Lobsterzilla,3,Mon Jul 20 17:21:12 2015 UTC,I used one of these for years and still have it.  The only mod that I did was to take the legs off and bolt them to the outside.  Then I got four bricks and stacked them in pairs to hold the fire bowl.  Then I could much more easily mess with the fire by just picking up the smoker and sitting it to the side while I added wood or stirred up the fire.

I chose the Akorn because I could buy three for one BGE. I gambled that in the long run I will only need maybe two Akorns (I'm 40). The food on either is going to be great, that I know.  The Akorn grill size is more than sufficient for my family of four. Done a few parties as well. No problem. Two butts is not even an issue, and with a rib rack a couple racks of ribs fit easily. I dunno what the BGE sizes are, but that's my experience."

I own an egg,  and have for 7 years,  there weren't a lot of alternatives at that time.   If I were just getting into it now,  I would think long and hard.   I would likely still end up with the egg though,  the support end of their operation has been a pleasure to deal with the few times I needed it."

I have yet to find myself wishing for a smaller egg instead of the big one.  I cook for a family of 5 with several pool parties as well throughout the summer.     The only thing I wish I had was another egg,  and the next one will be a minimax.     In your place,  with just the 2 of you,  I would go medium.  I would then hope that the bug doesn't bite you hard and you start wishing for the large.   It happens to a lot of smaller egg owners.   I don't know what the cost differential is,  but if it's a 150 or less,  I could justify the large in my mind."

smoking,3e0twg,na3800,2,Tue Jul 21 05:32:34 2015 UTC,I have the medium egg and I live alone. I wished every day for the past 4 years (owned just over that) I got the large egg. The medium does a fine job don't get me wrong but the large would do better for bigger beef back rub slabs or a larger brisket.   The tipping point for me was when I attempted to do my thanksgiving turkey this past year I couldn't fit it in vertically so I had to lay it horizontally which then caused the skin to catch more heat from being closer to the edge of the place setter. The skin was too crisp to eat and the rest of the turkey was still very tasty but not as moist as it should have been and I still blame it on not being able to have a beer can wedged in its Ass and cook it vertical with steam on the inside.   Ok with that said go get a large and never look back and feel remorse like I do :)   I ended up buying a pellet grill to supplement me when I need to cook a larger item so yeah solution found for me but not the ideal one

smoking,3dygs5,MikeDWills,8,Mon Jul 20 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"When trimming a packer, I push on the fat cap. If it gives with the meat, it's thin enough. If it feels like there's wax on it, I trim it some more. That gives a nice 1/8 - 1/4 inch cap. I actually like it towards 1/4 so that it doesn't fully render when smoked... Fat carries the flavor and adds the feeling of moist, and you don't want to lose it all.  On your image, I can see the brighter white parts where I would've trimmed it a little more.  I love spicy hot foods, but my brisket mix has only a light sprinkling of sugar and montreal seasoning, which is basically pepper/salt/garlic. I will use sauce later as desired, and that is usually pretty hot stuff. But all the seasoning I use is to enhance the natural flavor of the meat, not to cover it up or take center stage over the meat."
smoking,3dygs5,Vuelhering,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:11 2015 UTC,I always wonder how I should judge the thickness of the fat in areas other than around the edge of the meat... This strategy is very appreciated!

smoking,3dygs5,Olue,3,Mon Jul 20 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"It looks like a little more experience trimming would be beneficial. I bet that piece on top of the point burned didnt it? I would go ahead and remove it next time. I haven't had any problems with bad fat in a brisket with Costco. You may want to try them again. For the price it is tough to beat.  I would let it rest a little longer in a cooler. Also, 202 is probably fine. For your next brisket, when it hits about 190, start probing it. It won't be ready yet likely, but you will know what an underdone brisket feels like. Poke it near the middle of the flat. Start poking it every other degree rise. It won't hurt it if it has a few holes in it. You should be able to get a feel when it is done. Once it is ready the probe will just slide right in. You just learned how to feel when a brisket is done. You'll also notice a difference when you pick it up off the smoker. When done, the brisket will go from stiff to bending considerably and jiggly."
smoking,3dygs5,LaTuFu,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"If there's anything I'm still especially unsure of, it's trimming the thing. Always frightened to cut off something I'm not supposed to. I appreciate the help! And I'll definitely give Costco's another try, as Prime for their price is hard to pass up.  When I pulled it this time, I mainly went by feel. When it felt loose and jiggly, I took it off, and then checked the temp. I'd love to be a little more scientific about it, so I will be sure to start probing early."

smoking,3e10yi,pnapod,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:54 2015 UTC,"I find chicken smokes better at around 325F.  If you have the skin on, you'll want to either put them under the broiler with a little vegetable oil to crisp up the skin, or over some hot coals.    Cook the legs until they get to about 150-160F internal, then throw them over the coals/under the broiler until the skin crisps (but doesn't burn) and you'll be good to go.  Internal temp at the end should be about 165-170F.  As for recipes, depends on what you like.  I've used my rib rub, but go light.. The taste of smoked chicken meat is divine, don't want to cover that up.  Serve dry, sauced, or sauce on the side.

smoking,3e10yi,zodar,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:53 2015 UTC,"You could start your ribs on the smoker, if/when you wrap them move to the oven, crank up the heat and throw your chicken on the smoker.  When you pull the chicken off, bring the temp down and throw your ribs back on to dry the bark out some.  Alternatively, could always just leave the ribs on when you spike the temp and put the chicken on, so you don't need to wrap and just take them off when they're done.  I know some people do their ribs @ 275F so I'm sure it'd be fine.  Just pay attention that they don't get overcooked... You also may want to wrap them so the blast of smoke from the wood you put on for the chicken doesn't over-smoke your meat.  Chicken doesn't need a lot of smoke though, so you may be fine if it's a mild wood.  BBQ in general is fairly forgiving and wrapping in foil and putting the ribs in a cooler will likely keep them warm enough for the chicken to finish if you want to do them separately, then unwrap and glaze the ribs.  You just need to find out what works best for the results you want."

This allows you to slightly overcook it and it still keeps them moist.  Marinating is also an option.  At any rate, a 5 to 10 minute rest after coming off the smoker always helps too."
smoking,3dvk4k,3rdIQ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"But remember - most pork tenderloins that you buy at the grocery store come already injected with a saline solution of some sort.  Basically, they're pre-injected (though perhaps not with the ingredients you would pick)."

So, I would follow Meatheads advice.. Study/plan in advance and you'll have a good product in the end.    Make notes of what you did every step of the way (how big the butt was, rub used, ambient temp outside, how much wood you used, what time the butt went on, when you mopped it with your vinegar sauce, temps along the way..etc.) and adjust at your next cook to perfect your process/tweak it to your liking.  I'm with you on vinegar sauces - try one without the tomato maybe, just distilled vinegar, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.  I put it on pretty much everything. :)  Lastly and most important, make sure you take some pics, post them on here and tell us what you did and how it came out!"

smoking,3dssgo,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,7,Sun Jul 19 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"OP says so. Looks a touch dry to my eye, and this is the first time I've seen a pork shoulder cooked to the point where it's stable under a knife. Not saying it's ""wrong,"" just different from what I've seen in the past. Also not my style, but if it's good and the customer likes it, then far be it from me to judge."
smoking,3dssgo,pt606,7,Sun Jul 19 04:47:04 2015 UTC,My guess would be that it's not cooked to the temp that pulled pork would be. So maybe like 165 internal temperature? That's probably why it can be sliced easily.

smoking,3du2yt,TX727,2,Sun Jul 19 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"I have also tried this with charcoal (full pieces) and had no luck. In mine, the charcoal didn't even ignite - it was still completely black. I think that you could get this to work though, you'd just need to light the charcoal before putting it in the smoker. The light charcoal should give off the NO you need to get a smoke ring, and I don't think it would hold enough to heat your smoker above the desired temperature, so your heating element would fill in the gap to bring it up to temperature.   I have the same smoker as you, I believe, which will hold wood chunks or pellets."

smoking,3dtx8e,DeathbedHandjob,5,Tue Jul 21 21:51:41 2015 UTC,"Don't smoke by time, smoke to temperature. I've had several shoulders that ""should"" have taken 6 hours, go 8+.  For planning purposes, I estimate 2 hours per pound plus two to rest/finish.  This isn't something you want to be pulling off the smoker as guests arrive.... Having it done in advance works better  I usually smoke it until it hits 165, then wrap it in foil and let it go  (you can switch it to your oven too) until 190 or the bone pulls out.  The temp probe should slide in like butter at this point to.  Pork shoulders do tend to be moist enough by themselves that you don't have to wrap them, but I do anyway.  I personally don't baste or spray the meat in anything, but I like more of a dry bark.  Some hints to make it turn out great:   Rub the night before and let rest in your refrigerator Let the meat come to room temp before you put it in Bring the smoker up to temp and let it stabilize before adding the meat Even if you don't finish in foil, wrap it when you pull it out and allow it to rest for an hour before you try and pull it."

Much practise with the kamado including 3 practice pulled porks in the last five months and it was showtime. About a month ago, I submitted my estimate of $300 and he said no problem.  I bought the roasts on tuesday, trimmed them and dry brined them in my fridge.  I burned up two vacation days taking thursday and friday off to do this adventure.  Thursday morning I rubbed the roasts using a saltless version of Alton Brown's Rib Rub.  Then I started the other five recipes I would need for this meal:  American Chili Powder x2  Kansas City BBQ Sauce x3  Bourbon Baked Beans x3  Classic Deli Slaw x3  Sweet and Sour Slaw x3 (to go on the sandwiches)  And of course the Perfect Pulled Pork substituting the rub.  I did the first three on thursday afternoon then took a break.  I lit the bbq about 8:00 and slowly let it come up to temp (being clay it takes forever to cool back down if you overshoot the mark)  I put the roasts on about 9:30 and went to bed exhausted.  My wife checked them about 11:00 and said the temp was around 200. I should have worried but I built in a huge buffer so I went back to sleep.  At midnight she said the temp was 100f and I leapt out of bed knowing I screwed up.  I relit the bbq using a propane torch instead of my chimney because I find it better for a slow cook.  I opened the air a bit more and went back to bed once it was showing signs of promise.  I woke up an hour later and checked to find sub 200.  That was the end of sleep.  I opened the vents and blew in to get it going.  My experience told me not to let it get too hot but I knew 225 was not going to do it.  I was already planning out crutching it and finishing it in the oven as a contingency.  I damped off the air to a reasonable setting when it hit 250 and I seem to have gotten it right because it hovered there for the rest of the cook. (Btw, the smoke wood was from Tequila barrel oak chunks I bought).  I went in and started making the slaws.  I finished that three hours later including clean up, checked the temps again around 5:00 knowing I was in the stall and sweating the decision to crutch or not to crutch.  I still had at the most 6 hours left so I left them in and went to bed.  I got up an hour later and still in the stall and again at 7:00 still in the stall.  I knew time to decide was running out.  I brought it up to 265 and added the water pan to speed the stall and it worked.  At 8:30 I went to the mom and pop baker I ordered the buns from, requesting the softness of a hamburger bun with the crust of a kaiser to hold the moisture.  They were perfect!  I checked the roasts around 10:30 and they were 195 but passed the wiggle the bone easily test, so I took them out, put them in aluminum trays and into the faux cambro and the cold dishes into another cooler and off to work I went.  I had my lovely assistant (summer student helper) sauce the buns while I set up and at 11:50 I started pulling.  The bones came out easily (yay!) and I ripped the meat with my Wolverine Claws adding 1 litre of the sauce when it was pulled properly.  The service went off without a hitch and I received compliments from a pretty tough audience.  They aren't conoisseurs, just we mostly make it a point never to say anything nice to each other.  When he didn't know I could hear him, the boss even told two others that it was the best pulled pork he had ever eaten, and he does know his food and bbq, so that was a major compliment.  The next best part was when I totalled the receipts, it came to $299.42.  $.58 under budget.  That was pretty cool.  I gave the boss the leftover meat (minus a bit) vaccuum sealed in two sadwich portions.  In total, I was about 4lbs in leftovers, so not bad.  So I missed two days work and what did I get out of it?  Well I originally told the boss in February that I wanted to cook 25 lbs of meat and didn't want to pay for it and couldn't eat that much.  I gained major experience in cooking for a crowd, which was my original goal.  I got leftover ingredients (many half full sauce bottles to clutter my fridge and half a bag of charcoal). And an idea of what it will cost to turn pro when I retire in twenty years if I still want to.  I work in a welding shop so I could make my own smoker truck.  tl;dr: half crazed welder takes two days off to make lunch for the company and it turns out to be an unmitigated success.  Edit: Credit where credit is due: Big shout out to Meathead Goldwyn at Amazingribs.com.  I couldn't have done this without his wonderful site.  I will be posting this link to my pitmaster profile page."

First coarse then fine steel wool. Also got high temp spray paint for the outside of the rig. The ash tray underneath was trashed so got a new one via the char broil website. All the handles sat in vinegar for a day to get that rust off.

smoking,3drixp,compromised_username,4,Sat Jul 18 19:33:22 2015 UTC,"Smoke only penetrates the meat for the first couple hours. After that, you are just slow cooking it. You can keep blasting it with smoke, and you will get some more smoke flavor on the bark, but once the muscle fibers start getting more dense, there will be no more penetration into the meat."
smoking,3drixp,mpmontero,5,Sat Jul 18 20:20:11 2015 UTC,I also will add. You aren't looking for billowy white smoke. You are looking for wispy bluish white smoke. A lot of the time that smoke will be so thin that you may think that there is none.

smoking,3dqjd7,ps6000,3,Sat Jul 18 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"How long was it above 130? It's probably safe to eat if you cook it more. You probably lost the magic that happens, but you could probably eat the meat. Cook it, take a bite, wait for death, should death not come enjoy...  From what I know about food safety which is limited, shit is killed at 130. If you meat was above 130 it killed the bad shit. Now if all of the meat didn't reach that temp that's a problem. Then when the temp dropped into the danger zone bad shit could reproduce again. I guess it really depends on how long it sat in the danger zone and how higher the temp was before.  Think about this. How long would you let meat rest after cooking? Then how long would you let it sit on the table?   Good luck!"
smoking,3dqjd7,Vuelhering,2,Sat Jul 18 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"130F is where it doesn't grow, but generally isn't killed. 140 will kill most pathogens.  I believe the issue is not with active bacteria, but anaerobic stuff like botulism. But that is largely moot with a whole muscle cut. Coupled with the smoke and hotter outside, as long as the meat wasn't mechanically tenderized it should be fine"
smoking,3dqjd7,ps6000,2,Sat Jul 18 19:26:45 2015 UTC,I need to read up more on the levels of pathogen killing. Have you read this article? http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/complex-origins-food-safety-rules/   They mention that 120 will kill most pathogens given enough time. So  safety seems to become temp+time=safety  I have been getting into sous vide and reading about the low temp stuff. What are your thoughts?
smoking,3dqjd7,Vuelhering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:47:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, pasteurization is a time+temp thing. I've seen some charts put out for restaurants. But what's scary is that your body can kill off lots of salmonella without getting overwhelmed, but if you get only 10 cells of a nasty E coli, it can mess you up for a year. So yeah, you need to estimate what you're fighting. In the OP's case, he would've cooked the outside pretty well, and in the smoker it would've been difficult for bacteria to grow fast enough to mess with him if her reheated it. I have eaten some risky things, but I believe this would've been safe, although he would've had to toss it if running a restaurant.  I sous vide many things. I just did a point cut yesterday, although I like brisket at the higher temps where the fat starts breaking down, around 160F. This was a test and it was great smoked then cooked at about 150 for 36 hours, but not the way I wanted it. I think it would be perfect grilled, and would give me the best of all worlds.  The lower temp things (like 130) are safe and take days to cook. But I regularly cook salmon sous vide at around 125 for only 30 or 40 min, then sear the skin on a cast iron skillet in bacon fat. In fact, its my favorite way to make salmon. The skin becomes what I call bacon of the sea.  Edit- I also have a chamber full of what can only be described as rotting meat, but it's actually cured and drying. It's covered in bacteria. But it's good, non pathogenic, and contributes to the flavor and safety. Looking at it is scary if you aren't certain what's going on. It's at 55F, right in the danger zone!  Dang, I just ate a huge dinner and now I'm hungry again!"
smoking,3dqjd7,Vuelhering,3,Sun Jul 19 06:43:03 2015 UTC,"I would totally eat it.  bacteria hate smoke.  edit - in addition, 140 was the internal and it's a whole cut. External was probably around 160+. But that is me, and I said that I would eat it, not that you should. ground meat would be a No."

I've never wrapped my whole chickens in foil during the cooking process btw.  It typically takes me around 4-5 hours to smoke a chicken @ 225-250 and at each hour in I will rotate the chicken 180, half way through I flip it over and then another hour or so in I rotate another 180.

He'll need some mechanical or chemical approach to remove the rust before he does this.   No matter what, if you don't do what Ringo says for the last step, you're going to have rusty grates.   With that said, I've got grates that I didn't do a perfect job seasoning, and they have some regions with rust.

It won't remove rust.   #1 thing you can do to prevent your grill grates from rusting is don't scrub the hell out of them with anything. Leave them greasy and dirty after you use them. Before the next time, heat them up, (I use a gas grill, but there are alternatives) then hit them with your regular grill brush to get any loose particles off that might stick to food. For something like ribs where the appearance is important, I like to use a paper towel soaked in olive oil to wipe them down. In the case of a pork shoulder that I am going to pull, I was done worrying about the grates when I used the brush.  I have rehabbed iron, and for that I've use sanders, sand paper, angle grinders, etc., and then re-season."
smoking,3do658,Iwasborninafactory_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:03:55 2015 UTC,Awesome man very insightful will consider all this info. And quick question to take off the rust before I season them should I use a fine grit sand paper?
smoking,3do658,teamDINGUS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much rust there is, and depends on what you call fine. It could range from steel wool up to needing a grinder.  Are you doing it by hand, or do you have a palm sander?  Do you have access to an angle grinder? An angle grinder with a wire wheel is pretty much made for this task, if you have significant rust.  But don't forget, you've got the option to just brush it and ignore it, if it's not sever."

smoking,3do5nr,the_shiner,3,Fri Jul 17 21:32:26 2015 UTC,I certainly had to learn the PBC way of smoking.   I made great ribs in a PBC many times. Questions: Did you use Kingsford original charcoal? Did you have both rebars in and the lid on tight. With the probe wires going through the rebar holes?   I'm at sea level and I set the bottom vent to a quarter open and haven't touch it since the first day I smoked with it.   I'm curious as how you checked the cooking temp when there is very little to rest a probe on.
smoking,3do5nr,WatermarkSample,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"Great point! So, my probe has a little clip that normally fits in the grate of a smoker, and it incidentally fits nicely in the narrow end of the hooks, so it was just hanging up top with the meat. HOWEVER, your point about running the wire through the lid is well taken. I'll put it through the rebar hole next time.  Everything else was as described in the video. I wonder if I just lit too much coal in the beginning or something, and that was compounded by the gap in the lid. Oh well. The ribs turned out pretty well anyway."
smoking,3do5nr,WatermarkSample,2,Sat Jul 18 00:28:03 2015 UTC,The lid and the rebar acts like a vent. When I do ribs both rebars are in and the lid stay on and I don't open the lid for the first three hours. When I do a pizza I have the rebars out for more heat and the last five minutes I crack the lid slightly.
smoking,3do5nr,DJCBlue,3,Sat Jul 18 03:08:57 2015 UTC,"If you're following the company's instructions, it should be pretty consistent around 250-300.  I agree with Watermark's comment to make sure you're using kingsford original and check airflow including the vent, lid, and rebar.  If you're still having problems after following the instructions, I would call the owner.  From what I've read, he's very responsive and helpful."
smoking,3do5nr,Boodz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, used Kingsford. The ribs turned out pretty well anyway, so I'll just have to toy with it and make sure the lid is on tight. Thanks!"
smoking,3do5nr,Craix8,3,Sat Jul 18 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"Pit barrel does naturally run hotter than your typical smoker (its why they call it the pit barrel cooker, although maybe they really hate PBS). Although 350 sounds too high, make sure you have the rebar in, check that your bottom vent is set properly (I'm in Colorado, so 3/4ths for me) and make sure the lid is on tight."
smoking,3do5nr,andylutes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thank you."
smoking,3do5nr,spauldingnooo,2,Sat Jul 18 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"I had this problem early with my PBC. The other responses are good on what to check (lid, vent, temp probe through rebar holes).  The other thing that I haven't seen mentioned is how you start the charcoal. I found that I was getting my charcoal too lit in the beginning, if that makes sense. When I used lighter fluid I was using too much of it. When I used the chimney I let it get too hot before pouring it into the cooker. I use lighter fluid most of the time now. It takes a little experimentation to get all the parameters right, but you will get there within a few cooks. As a general rule of thumb if I am too hot I close the vent more.  I will also use small pieces of foil to put around the rebar rods to further reduce the oxygen. If I'm too cool (below 220) I'll crack the lid a bit and put a very small stick in it to let more oxygen flow for a while. Between closing off the air with foil and the vent and opening the lid a bit I have found that I can keep it in the range I am looking for.  I know it is supposed to be set and forget, but maybe I'm a fiddler. Once I got the charcoal lit properly it pretty much is. I'm smoking some pork butts tomorrow, so I'll be using all these ""tricks"" myself.  Oh, and take notes for yourself (or have a better memory than me) so that you know in the future what worked well for you."
smoking,3dnih7,paulrenaud,3,Fri Jul 17 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"When I used to use a similar setup I had to do a lot of trial and error. I used too much charcoal, too much wood, not enough, etc etc... I had to vent opened too much, not enough, etc etc.... My biggest problem was I was too hasty in putting my meat n and I didn't wait long enough for the temp to even out. The second it hit my temp, I toss my meat on and found that once it was closed back up, the temp would rise again and hit well over my desired temp....    What I'm saying is... Do LOTS of things, take notes and you will find something that works out right for you."
smoking,3dnih7,mpmontero,2,Fri Jul 17 18:43:44 2015 UTC,My biggest problem was I was too hasty in putting my meat n and I didn't wait long enough for the temp to even out.

Beyond that it's just trial and error knowing how many bricks to use and when/how to adjust the vents.  Hope that helps"

I started taking a couple pieces of foil folded over several times - and then folded over the door - to use as gaskets at the top.  Gave that advice to another team at a comp recently, and it helped immediately.  Amazon also sells a gasket kit for the WSM."
smoking,3dnih7,seattleque,2,Fri Jul 17 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"The gasket kits rock and are easy to apply too.  My other issue with the WSM is when I was trying to get over 225F, having too much water in the bowl.. it just wouldn't move past the 225F-230F range.  Less water, I was able to hit higher temps.  I need an empty bowl to get up to 325F."
smoking,3dnih7,TheDahktor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I need the higher temps I go with the empty bowl, but still foil it just to catch the drippings.  I'll also add lump to the Kingsford I use, since it burns hotter.  Last turkey I did I managed to get the WSM up to 350° before putting it on, then with the meat added it dropped to about 320°."
smoking,3dnih7,seattleque,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"I had a similar problem for a long time on my WSM. The minion method helped me maintain temp for long periods of time, but I stay between 220 and 250. Hope that helps."

Generally if it's running cool you can just open up all the bottom vents and it'll be about 300 degrees in half an hour if you aren't watching it.

The best method I have found is to stack all your charcoal unlit on one side, then add 4 lit coals to the side of the unlit pile. The unlit ones will slowly light and keep your temp around 250, you will use your air vents to dial it in."

The wood needs to dry out before it'll start to smoke..so, don't soak your wood.  Lighter fluid should also be banned, can taint the food.. I actually just use a paper towel sprayed down with vegetable oil to start my chimney."
smoking,3dmt5g,TheDahktor,3,Fri Jul 17 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment. The smoke dies down, but the temperature stays the same. After I add charcoal to it and stir around the charcoal pan a bit it smokes a lot, then about 15 minutes later there's no smoke coming out of it. I'll try putting some dried wood chips in there."
smoking,3dmt5g,TheDahktor,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"Be careful with the amount of wood you use - you don't want to see a lot of smoke coming out of the top, there's a phrase ""thin blue smoke"" and that's the visual goal.  Light, hard to see, wispy thin smoke..at most.  You sometimes won't even be able to see it depending on your climate.. Trust in your process and remember it's better to have less smoke, than have the meat be bitter due to too much smoke... You can always adjust your recipe on your next cook.  You also don't want to be adding wood throughout entirety of the cook, first 2-3 hours maybe, all together maybe a little over a pound of wood depending on your preferences.  Lighter flavored woods (apple for example) you may need to use a hair more to get your desired smokeyness.  Always err on the side of caution until you know how you want to tweak your process.  Speaking of which, write down everything you do and the times you did it.. Where you bought the meat, how you trimmed it, when you brined it, how much salt per pound, what time you started your fire, when your cooker got to temp, when you put the meat on, what temp the meat was throughout the cook (they have automated, wireless temp monitors that'll graph this for you if you want to get fancy), when you put more wood on, when you had to put more coals on to maintain temp, when did you have to add more water in the bowl (if you use one), when you pulled it off the cooker..etc etc etc.  Write down all the details and use them to adjust your next cook.  Smoking meat, unlike grilling/fast cooking, means making small adjustments over time - making multiple fast adjustments can cause you to over correct and make things harder to manage.  If you haven't, check out Amazingribs for the fundamentals - I highly recommend every article/recipe they have to learn some basics then start tweaking for your personal tastes.  http://amazingribs.com/recipes/porknography/perfect_pulled_pork.html  And overall, don't stress it.. This cook may not come out perfect but you're working on a very forgiving piece of meat..it'll likely be good even with a substantial amount of ""abuse""..  It'll always be better next time!   Oh..and don't forget to post us some pictures. :)"

smoking,3dmt5g,gozzling,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"I twist two paper towels together and saturate half of the length with the oil spray, maybe a 2-3 second spray.

smoking,3dmt5g,CrustyGrundle,3,Sat Jul 18 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"I like wood chunks a lot more than chips, they last longer and produce a more consistent smoke. No need to soak them, I've read that advice too but it actually makes you produce a worse, bitter smoke filled with creosote.  As for the charcoal, I recommend buying a chimney starter, and once they get white-hot (around 10 min) they are ready to go."

smoking,3dmt5g,MaxThroughput,3,Fri Jul 17 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely think its worth it. They will light more quickly and evenly because they are all sort of compressed together, no need for lighter fluid.

From what I've read it's ok to use kingsford before it's 100% covered in ash.  In fact, i just add more fresh charcoal to the burn pot without even lightining it first.  Just toss it onto the existing hot coals.  cheers!"
smoking,3dmt5g,mmuoio,5,Fri Jul 17 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"What you want to do is only light 4 coals, and place it next to a pile of unlit. The unlit will slowly light and it will keep your temperature around 225-250 if you have your vents set correctly."

smoking,3dmt5g,mmuoio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:54 2015 UTC,I can get at least 4 hours from the first batch using this method. The downside is you get some smoke flavor from the briquettes lighting.

smoking,3dn60p,StormyBA,2,Fri Jul 17 17:04:34 2015 UTC,It'll change your life. I do an overlapped form of 2 on the bottle all uniform then one in the centre in the middle of that (kinda like a mini pyramid) it's great for keeping at 225f or higher without too much playing with the intake on the kettle. I prefer to put the wood leaning against the beggining of the snake or I'll use chips sometimes and just scatter liberaly. Start about 7 or 8 briquettes in your chimney and when white place them carfully at the front and make sure if using chunks of wood some of those are touching it to get it started. Put a water bowl in (steel) if your doing a long cook to catch drippings and create a better atmosphere for the food to cook in. When I get to about 220f I add my food. Then it's hopefully plain sailing but you will have to be on hand incase the temp drops too low or rises too high. I'd recommend a Maverick thermometer for that..set your high and low temps and enjoy the cook. I'm usually sat next to mine in our garden just for ease..the temps so low you shouldn't stink of smoke too much..but hey I like the smell anyhow haha. Good luck with the cook. Hope you post pics.
smoking,3dn60p,XtremeBBQ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:39 2015 UTC,I read the bottom vent should be fully open and the top about half open. Is that a good guide? Thanks!
smoking,3dn60p,XtremeBBQ,2,Fri Jul 17 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"No. Top open all the way all the time..bottom open after just before you've reached premium temp...then just adjust it and stay with it and keep it constant..you should be able to keep a great temp. My tip is to keep the briquettes very neat and uniform, I find it really helps on temp control. Some ppl just dump a load messily around in a snake and wonder why the temp is fluctuating...I've been using lump wood recently which burns hotter and is a little trickier to gauge how much to use but touch wood I've had great results...It's fun to experiment and if you mess up...try it again until you own it."
smoking,3dn60p,TX727,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"Good guide.  If the temp needs to be adjusted, adjust your bottom vents accordingly and not the top."
smoking,3dn60p,savyur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:56:55 2015 UTC,You will need to find the sweet spot yourself for your grill/ your enviroment. Kettles can work great as smokers but they take a bit more tending to. I typically have to get up every half hour and tweak the vents a little (mostly the top)  If I go full open on the bottom I get to 350 fast. I did a few smokes and each time I used a wax pencil to mark the bottom vent. Eventually I go a range that I know will work. Sometimes I need a little more/less air but between the two marks I have it works.  TL;DR  Guidelines are just that. You will need to pay attention to what your cooker does. Do you have a wireless thermometer?
smoking,3dn60p,philly_10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:38 2015 UTC,How many coals for the bottom strips?  I've been doing 20 coals (2 rows of 10) and then another 2 rows on top.  It tends to get very warm (last time the vents were 90% closed to keep it 225).  I will try this pyramid method this weekend.
smoking,3dn60p,XtremeBBQ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:46 2015 UTC,Two on bottom and one on top mate. I did the samexas you and got same results but I was using more briquettes. I cover a semi circle (half a grate) and get a solid 7 hours sometimed a tad more..cheers

smoking,3dn60p,philly_10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:17:59 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I did that as well.  I mean with only 3 rows of coal.  Do you dins the bottom open and then tweaking the top vent only, or do you still need to play with the bottom one?"
smoking,3dn60p,XtremeBBQ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:01:53 2015 UTC,Never touch the top..thats basically your exhaust. It's the intake you need to adjust. Keep the top vent fully open.

smoking,3dn60p,TX727,2,Sat Jul 18 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"Only other tip I can add because X did a great job on everything else, is you may also need to turn your top grate every so often so the meat isn't over the lit coals.  Other than that, the snake works on its own."

smoking,3dkw2v,blueblob11,3,Fri Jul 17 11:04:17 2015 UTC,"Was wanting a tenderloin, but when I got to the store they were having a sale on chicken and pork loins, so went with that instead - no regrets, not bad for $11.  I dry brined the meat for about 12 hours - my usual 3/4 teaspoon per pound of meat, then covered and put in the fridge.  Right before smoking, lightly coated with oil and threw a modified version of Meatheads Simon & Garfunkel rub on the loin, the chicken was lightly dusted with paprika, granulated garlic, pepper and onion powder. Both were smoked with cherry wood - been having fun with that as of late.  Approximately 4 ounces of wood.  Smoked at 325F, chicken took exactly 1.5 hours and the loin took exactly 2 hours.  Since the chicken was finished first, I removed it from the smoker and covered them until the loin was done - then out of laziness (didn't want to get the grill going), I coated the chicken with a little more oil and stuck under the broiler to crisp up.  Chicken went to 165F before I took it off the smoker, the loin went to 140F, I covered/let the loin rest until everything else was done, maybe 15 or so minutes.  Brussels sprouts were halved, sprinkled with olive oil/salt/pepper and cut up some bacon and put it all together on a foil lined cookie sheet, in the oven @ 450F for about 35 minutes.  The bacon rings were white onion rings, two rings in thickness, sliced, salted and wrapped in bacon also done at 450F for about 30 minutes - or until the desired crispness is achieved.  Chicken was smokey, the skin was crispy and bite through (admittedly I'm never good with the skin, this time was perfect however) and the seasoning was light enough that you could still taste the chicken.  Love it with a vinegar finishing sauce.  The loin was the show stealer, sweet, moist and so tender.  My kid, a scrawny 8 year old little girl, ate two drumsticks, thick slice of the loin and she asked if she could have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I'll take that as a compliment!"

I feel like the ends of the racks that hung over my deflector pan got overdone. Could just be because they were smaller in general though.   I had really not wanted to wrap the pork butt, unfortunately it just stopped going up. Next one I do I'll try unwrapped again and see how it goes."
smoking,3dkp7f,hosalabad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:54:38 2015 UTC,"Try a higher temp and I bet you won't need to wrap it.  I use a pizza stone as a deflector and put the drip pan on top of it. Because yes, if the meat hangs over, it can get direct heat and cook faster."

My 1st comp my wife came in the morning to help build my turn in boxes but other than that it's just been me and my WSMs. It's a lot of work but definitely possible to do it w/out a team. However it's also a lot funner to do it with close friends by your side. I just don't have any that are into smoking/bbq like me and are willing to put in the time and effort to do it right.   Make a checklist of everything you need to pack in the car to take to the comp site. You can even google lists people have posted already. Think about EVERYTHING. I once forgot to bring a freaking lighter to a comp and kept having to ask my neighbor to borrow some fire.   Practice, practice, practice. Get your recipes and routine down pat and don't stray from it come the day of the comp. The day of the comp is not the time to try out new recipes or techniques. Stick with what has worked for you.   During down time is a good chance to walk around and meet your neighbors and other teams. Everyone is usually very friendly and open to shoot the shit. Great networking opportunity as well.   Bottom line, have fun. You already have a good mindset realizing you may come in last but having fun with friends and the thrill of competition is what's important. My goal used to be not to come in D.A.L. (Dead Ass Last) and then I came in D.A.L. one time. It's like, okay, get that one out of the way and move on.

I've always done them with just one other friend. We drink a fair amount of beer and have a ton of fun. About the only time we get serious is when the health inspector comes around at the beginning to make sure everything is sanitary. If it's not too serious of a competition the organizers should be able to help you with any questions you have as far as equipment you'll need but like sushitampa says, make a checklist and if you forget something don't sweat it, remember you are there to have fun. After you get one or two competitions under your belt you'll know if you are interested in getting more serious about it. It's hard to beat hanging out at a BBQ competition talking BBQ all day drinking beer. My only advise, pre-make as much as you are allowed to the day or two before, don't bring all your ingredients for your rub and make on site, just bring the rub/marinades etc. We also make way more food than we need to turn in, its nice to share samples with your fellow competitors and we also invite lots of friends and family to come by for a sample as well."

Place pie tin on top of smaller pot and fill with water. Cut expanded steel down to size so that it just sits inside rim of pot, this will be your grate. Place meat on grate, sprinkle coals with wood chips as needed and invert second large pot on top for lid.

smoking,3dih8k,Nega_Duck,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"Seconded.. Choose the shape/size of the wood based on your application.    I like larger chunks for the smoker, I use smaller chunks from the bag for when I'm grilling as I tend to need more smoke for the shorter cook time."
smoking,3dih8k,TheDahktor,2,Thu Jul 16 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"It is also relative to the size of your cooker.  If you're using a WSM, kettle, or other ""small (ish)"" cooker, you'll want to stay more towards the lump charcoal/hardwood chunks or smaller end of the range.  Whole logs will be really inefficient in anything that small.  The smoke they'll put off during the initial phase of burning will transfer a bad flavor to anything you're cooking.  Plus a whole log will need a lot of time and energy from the fire (that it will take away from your food) to burn down to coals before it can be more efficient and useful for cooking.  It will make it harder to keep your temps stable during that time.  That's why you tend to see charcoal, lump, and hardwood chunks/chips used most often.  Consistency of the burn and reliable/predictable behavior during the cooking process."
smoking,3dih8k,LaTuFu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"What if the wood were to be cut into various shapes? Spheres, squares, pyramids?"
smoking,3dih8k,LaTuFu,3,Thu Jul 16 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"Now you're getting into what /u/Nega_Duck was referring to.  Surface area.   The surface area will increase the more you cut up the wood, and the more ""faces"" you cut into it.  Theoretically speaking you would want the wood cut into uniform pieces as much as possible (like charcoal briquettes) to provide as much consistency as possible.  Random cuts and shapes might look cool or sound like a great idea, but they just add variance to your cook times and temps.  If you're a seasoned pro, that isn't necessarily a problem.  If you're a weekend warrior, and you've got 8 people waiting on you to finish up that shoulder, it can be a huge deal.  But seasoned wood is much less efficient as a fuel for BBQ/smoking than charcoal or lump.  There is a lot of water, air, and other impurities that have to be released from the wood before it is an efficient source of heat.  During this phase of the burn, those impurities are what will give the food off/bitter flavors.  That's why you see guys who burn whole wood usually burn it down to coals before using it, or they're using a large enough cooker/smoker that it doesn't matter if they throw on a new log or two during the cook."

In Canada the whole shoulders are also often sold skin-on.  It's your option to trim or not to trim.  I've had it both ways and it was good both ways, but I typically trim it to allow more seasoning to sit on the meat.  Even if you do try to trim it, there will still be lots of bits of fat between the meat.  The fat cap (skin) will baste the meat a bit more, however.  Can't comment on the cook time, every shoulder is different, even from one picnic to the next, or one boston to the next."

Picnic will smoke, but it's a little leaner, people do use it to make pulled pork and some even prefer it - I think it's better used for making a ham (which I believe is traditionally the rear leg vs front, but it works here as well) or some other application.  We love cracklins here as well and if you're smoking yes, you should remove the skin with enough fat to get bare meat before you apply you salt/rub/smoke it otherwise you won't get as much of the desired bark. You can make cracklins separate of the meat, it's very easy.  Quick and dirty is to cut the skin into desires strips, maybe 1"" wide/2"" long, smoke or par-boil at a low heat to render some of the fat then throw in a pan and fry (or deep fry them).  I'm a big fan of Amazingribs, he's got a good outline to follow.  Try Meatheads suggested method and then tweak for your personal tastes: http://amazingribs.com/recipes/porknography/cracklins.html"
smoking,3dhhzv,TheDahktor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:22 2015 UTC,"The Picnic cut definitely tastes much more like ham. It should be interested to cook both at the same time so you can really taste the differences. I would recommend smoking until the internal temp hits 160, then wrap in foil and you can bump the heat until you hit the desired temp. The magic number for me has always been between 201-203, but some people like to pull it at 190-195. Wrap it in towels and place in a cooler for at least an hour. Then pull and serve!

I think beef ribs are especially fun to do in various flavors - Asian inspired/Indian inspired..etc.

smoking,3digsc,synackrst,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:42:11 2015 UTC,"There's not really a right answer, because what matters is what the people you are cooking for enjoy eating.  That said, I find that I don't love a lot of sweetness with beef, which rules out most of the major name brands of sauce.  That said, a more spicy/vinegary type of sauce - I thinking of the thinner sauces you can get at some central Texas places like Cooper's or even Rudy's - can be a nice complement.  However, the more vinegary the sauce, the stronger the argument for serving it on the side."
smoking,3digsc,WanderlustSailor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:43:10 2015 UTC,"The only sauce I put on mine is either hot sauce or A1 Thick & Hearty  as a binding agent for my rub. Try experimenting around with umami ingredients in your rub. Onion powder, powdered mushrooms, powdered soy sauce, etc.. I usually add a tablespoon or so of cane sugar and some chilies."

Right bottom: French mustard and light chipotle rub.  Also I glazed the things on the wsm by removing the top part and result was pretty good.  It was a close competition between the sriracha and Frenc mustard. Kids liked the simple garlic and pepper rub:-)

I would put it on smoke just for the 5 minutes to get things lit (that is about 160-175 degrees I think), then on to 200? (I think that is the next setting, or possibly the second one after 185). You want an end point of around 205, and I would be shocked if a twelve pounder got there during the night. In the morning, hustle to get a thermometer. If you hit 205 early, great. Its time to wrap in foil and towels and stick it in a cooler. It will keep its heat for lunch no problem.

The auction winner pays the difference between that market price, and the auction price. The 4H kid gets the full amount. So the winning bidder doesn't actually buy the animal.  With that in mind, walk through the barns BEFORE the auction, but after the beef and swine shows. Look for the purple ribbons/grand champion trophies, and start up a conversation with anybody around. Most of them will be happy to sell you another animal from their farm that perhaps didn't quite make the cut to bring to the fair. They can probably arrange to deliver it to the processing facility of your choice."

I used apple wood chips from locally grown apple trees that are kiln dried and chopped by one of the local stores around here. It was so tender and moist that I could barely get it out of the smoker without it falling apart in my hands, but a lot of that has to do with the meat itself. I got the pork shoulder from a butcher just up the street from me. They get all over their meat from local farms that raise their animals without hormones or any other additives. The nice thing about having a butcher is that they kept a lot of the fat on there when they were trimming it, whereas the local grocery stores near me will trim 90% of the fat or more off of their pork shoulders. And as an added bonus, the pork shoulder was only $2.29 per pound, only a few cents more per pound than the big chain stores around here who sell pork shoulders vacuum sealed and several days old by the time it is out for sale."

I usually smoke around 250 and I've finished butts literally twice that size in 12-14 hours, and I couldn't imagine leaving it on their for 10 more hours.

smoking,3dah7h,Cdresden,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"There is a reason most cooks/smokers use a thermometer these days.  There are lots of books, studies, and lots of science behind the cooking of different types of meat.  The internal temperature can tell you a lot of things that ""feel"" will not.  Like the temperature the fat will start to render out of the meat and what temperature the muscle will begin to tighten up along with many other tings.  I'm not telling you to never give it a feel test before you take it off, because there is a lot that the feel will tell you; but, feel alone will not tell you a majority of whats going on.  It's like if someone told you they didn't have a thermometer on their smoker and they just go by how much smoke and the feel of how hot it seems.  That sounds crazy to you, right?  because there is no way you can churn out delicious meats without knowing the cooking temperature.  Well same thing with a meat thermometer."

I use a wireless dual probe thermometer so I can see my grate temp and my internal temp, along with a quick probe.  203 degrees seems to be the highest consensus final internal tempature I've seen.  It really is preference, but pork terms to get mush when is overcooked which some attribute as tenderness.  Its hard to overcook pork shoulder to the point its totally dry.  I also don't know your setup, constantly checking it may increase your time that much.  I had a butt on while it snowed take 18 hours."
smoking,3dah7h,PuppiesScent,3,Wed Jul 15 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"No offense intended, man, but that looks very dry.  That is literally the driest pulled pork I've ever seen.  I'm  afraid I agree with some others here that you're drastically overcooking it."
smoking,3dah7h,Digitalzombie90,3,Wed Jul 15 05:32:17 2015 UTC,"How do you do yours, temp and time? Like I said I'm down to try new methods, practice makes perfect!"
smoking,3dah7h,Icouldbeanyone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:09:23 2015 UTC,"I smoke at 225-250F.  The internal temperature of the pork will rise and then plateau near 160F while it sheds moisture and converts collaten to gelatin.  Then the temperature will rise again.  For pork, beef, lamb, etc., barbecue is done when the meat internal temp hits 203F.  But you want to start checking for doneness around 195F.  Then the meat needs to rest insulated for about an hour before serving, so you can wrap it in foil or paper, then in a towel, then let it rest in a Coleman cooler or something.  The best way to monitor the temps is to use a dual probe thermometer, one probe in the meat and one just laid on the rack to monitor the smoke chamber temp.  The Maverick has a wireless remote, so you can clip it on your shirt.  It will alert you when the meat is close to being done, or if either of the temps varies outside the ranges you set."
smoking,3dah7h,Icouldbeanyone,2,Wed Jul 15 07:48:24 2015 UTC,"That is extremely dry. You're drastically over cooking your pork shoulder.   Have you ever had a properly cooked shoulder? It should look and taste far more juicer and tender than that.   This is a pic of one of my recent shoulders. Look at all the juices and fats you can see on all of the meat. I didn't brine it and had almost no preparation except for a rub with some prepared mustard (shoulder doesn't need brining, it's a very fatty cut. The connective tissue will keep from being dry if it is cooked properly, thus not needing a brine).   Keep over cooking your meat if you want, but if you want it to be like it's supposed to be, you need to invest in a probe thermometer and keep an accurate track of your smokers temperature.   Pork shoulders should be cooked at around 225 degrees until they reach and internal temp of 195-203. This is when they meat is at its most tender.   I've cooked huge shoulders. The longest it's ever take to get to that point is 12 hours. This means you are overcooking your meat by 8-12 hours. And if you're smoker is actually at at 225, then your shoulder is undoubtedly approaching 225 internal temperature, which is very very overcooked.   So that's the reason you're getting downvoted. That and the fact that you aren't taking much advice, but instead just arguing that your way is fine. Again, do it your way if you want to. I really don't care. But you're not doing it the way it should be done and your meat is undoubtedly subpar and not very tasty (compared to properly cooked shoukder) as evidenced by your picture and the information you've given.   Take care. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd be glad to help as long as your willing to actually take advice."

smoking,3dblui,daonemanshow,8,Wed Jul 15 01:17:12 2015 UTC,Some quick suggestions for accessories and charcoal I use with a Big Green Egg.   Wireless Thermometer  Royal Oak Lump Charcoal ThermoWorks Thermometer
smoking,3dblui,PaleDiablo,8,Wed Jul 15 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"First thing you need is a decent digital thermometer. You can get by with a single probe unit but its really nice to be able to monitor the cooker temp and meat temp simultaneously. Its quite pricey but I recommend a Maverick ET-733 ($65+). It even has a wireless receiver you can keep with you so you don't need to keep going outside to check temps! A good chimney charcoal starter is also essential. Weber makes a good rugged one. Around $15 at Walmart. If you buy a cheaper one it will burn through and wont last.   For charcoal I prefer original Kingsford. Don't get the ""matchlight"" variety. Its pre-soaked with lighter fluid and does not make good eats.  Everyones got a different technique when it comes to smoking woods. Sawdust, chunks, chips, pre-soak the wood, dont pre-soak the wood, etc. I just throw  a few handfulls of dry wood chips on top of the charcoal. I think soaking the chips tends to lower the temp of the coals initially. Besides....we want smoke not steam, right?   I usually follow Arron Franklin and his youtube videos when it comes to seasoning the meat and cooking technique. Keeping things simple usually gives me the best results."
smoking,3dblui,squeeb357,2,Wed Jul 15 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"... and if you don't want to spend $65 on a thermometer I got the Maverick ET-73 off amazon for half the price.  There are a few things that are mildly frustrating, namely, the range isn't quite as great and it won't tell you if you are out of range, but for me at half the price it's worth a buy."
smoking,3dblui,dayflyer55,-4,Thu Jul 16 19:31:23 2015 UTC,I disagree strongly that OP needs a digital probe immediately. I made a lot of great BBQ before I got a probe and the probe didn't make my BBQ better at all.   The only thing it was really helpful for was being able to set the alarm and ignore the cooker while I do other things (like sleep).

smoking,3dblui,dailybender,6,Wed Jul 15 05:38:00 2015 UTC,"Stuff on the smoker gets hot.  This should be obvious but you will find yourself trying to pick up a hunk of scalding tender meat with bare hands or small tongs, having it fall apart, fall on the ground, and not look pretty for karma.  Get a pair of grill gloves (see photo) and a helper to hold the plate.  Do it yourself at your own risk.  Smoke will come out of the front plate.  Many forums, discussions, money, work can be spent on making a better seal.  IMO it's not worth it, temps stay solid, smoke still gets to the meat, don't waste your time/money.  Heavy duty foil, nothing less.  Use and line the water pan, even if not using water.  Easier to clean up and prevents direct heating/burning.  I use these Weber wax starters (photo).  One under a chimney full of coals gets it going and no burnt newspaper mess to deal with.  I try to err towards more coals vs adding any during the smoke.  Tight tolerances, things are hot, so you have to throw charcoal/wood in there so ashes get kicked up and on your food.  And as you noticed no handles on the grill so you can't lift the whole thing up to add coals that way.  Use more coals and if you finish early just choke it off and reuse the coals on a future smoke.  Most recipes talk about ""...and let set overnight in the fridge.""  I can't ever plan that well but just a heads up to plan for defrost, brining, rub time, etc.  You can't say ""I'm going to smoke that frozen turkey today!"".  Plan ahead though nothing says you can't get great results by just throwing some rub on some ribs and throwing them on the smoker.  It's relatively forgiving.  http://imgur.com/GcY5w3e  Side story: brother in law just smoked a pork shoulder in a small metal trash barrel.  When he went to take the meat off the hooks (why hooks I do not know), the meat was so tender it fell off the hooks and straight to the bottom into the hot coals.  After digging around with tongs and into a face full of hot smoke for a panicked 3 minutes, we were able to recover the shoulder mostly intact (kept falling apart).    Was delicious as hell once we peeled the bark off.  So no worries, you can really screw up and still end up with a tasty meal."
smoking,3dblui,BravoDotCom,5,Wed Jul 15 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"Of course you'll make a mistake. It's your first time. Take a breath, have a beer, and know that it isn't a failure if you learn something, even if you have to order pizza.  Some good answers from other folks, here are more:  -plan for 1/3 pound cooked meat per person, which translates to 1/2 pound uncooked. So a nice 4 pound butt will be fine, AND it will cook relatively quickly (this is good). -doesn't the WSM have a swinging door that allows you to add more wood or charcoal? If so, you don't really have to worry about the fire too much. Just add more of whatever you need. But to build for a long cook with low maintenance, basically you just mix the chunks (better than chips) in with the charcoal. That's it.  Good luck!"

Kingsford Charcoal A good thermo, Maverick's are great Rubber BBQ gloves Wood chunks of various types, or at least something versatile like Apple wood to start with  A injection needle is handy A weber chimney for starting the charcoal Read up on and learn the minion method Some shaker cups, so you can mix up your rub in and shake over your meats Lots of saran wrap and heavy foil A spray bottle Some sort of brush (silicone?) for brushing/moping sauces on to your meat If you plan on doing whole chickens, it can be handy to have some sort of stands to prop them up.

A WSM is fairly cheap for the quality it offers, it has excellent temp control and has the largest cooking area per dollar you spend. Apparently 14inch version literally sips fuel. I have the 22.5 and fill that bad boy up every time :) They also hold their value very well and can be re-sold on craigslist within days.   My prediction, 14 is a great smoker, but I would need at least two, it would be perfect for cooking things in two different temps, or fish and meat at the same time etc... 18 is a good size for a person who smokes things for his friends once a month or so. 22.5 is the real deal.

The WSM isn't that great for the price, suffers from many of the drawbacks of things like the ECB (which you could buy about 7 of for the price of the WSM), and nobody ever talks about actual contenders in that small footprint low price area like the Akorn.  I don't think you are an astroturfer, but you have to understand that when people promote that product as if it didn't have all of the faults it does, it looks like astroturfing."

It could have been a different brand, I am not sure, but there was a small, medium and large one and only the largest one could have cook a brisket. The upper grate on my WSM is 370sqin and barely fits a large packer cut brisket. If it is too long, the edges can even get burned because the deflector plate/water pan does not extend to the edges , your akorn has 1 310sq in grate, and yes it can't cook the briskets that I am cooking, it proably is hard to do any brisket over 10lbs on that thing.

I'm sure there are exceptions, but is this still mostly true?  I've been smoking on a Kettle the last few years, but I'm interested in buying a dedicated smoker (between 200-400).

smoking,3d9e0i,taycky22,2,Sat Jul 18 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"You are right, most offset under a certain price point is going to be made of thin metal and not hold temps well, or so the people say. I never owned a cheap offset.   I said "" thats not an offset"" because I did not want to make a statement that WSM is the best smoker ever. Get a $4k Lang, meadow creek or a custom built offset you have a better cooker. Within you price range, and according to my experiences, WSM is the best cooker.   I like it better than Akorn because it is a dedicated smoker with more real estate and dual temp zones.   As an example, I can run the bottom grate ( which is as big as the top grate) of my WSM at 250F for Pork shoulder, while my brisket is kicking ass in butcher paper, on the top grate at 275F, without changing anything. I can cook 4 pork shoulders, 2 ribs and a 12 pound brisket all at the same time. I can access, poke, add etc.. my charcoal without moving the grates. Those things make WSM a better choice for me.   If you want to put a handful of good quality charcoal, one brisket and let it run overnight on its own for really good brisket in the morning, then yeah Akorn would be solid."
smoking,3d9e0i,Digitalzombie90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:35:40 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that makes a lot of sense. Is it practical to do pizzas on a WSM? Or rather, am I better off using a WSM than a Kettle?   I've never been able to smoke in bulk, so that concept is very very appealing."
smoking,3d9e0i,taycky22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will answer this question by saying no, WSM can't make pizza because it is a smoker and it is designed to run at low temperatures, and they are right up to a certain degree. If you use WSM the way it is intended, which is charcoal on the bottom, water pan full of water, air control using the knobs on the bottom, then it can't get to temperatures that give you that nice crust for your pizza.   However if you use it in a non intended way it can make one of the best pizza's ever, a proper wood fired one also. The trick is not to use charcoal but actual wood sticks. You basically create a small bone fire inside the WSM. If you have the 22.5 one, you have no worries since it is tall and wide enough to accomodate that. You leave the water pan empty and even remove it depending on how big your fire is. On the highest shelf you use a Pizza stone. You leave the charcoal door cracked open for enough air to come in.   Wood will burn much hotter and without water in the pan and enough oxygen you can get your WSM to 500-650 easily. You will also be cooking the pizza in wood fire, no charcoal no gas yo give you that authentic taste.   You asked me if it is practical, and no on a scale of calling dominos or throwing a frozen one in the microwave, it is not practical. I guess the scale from 1-10 is something like Frozen Pizza microwave 1 Frozen Pizza oven 2 delivery 3 takeout 4 Gas pizza oven 6 Kamado grills (akorn) 7 WSM 9  The thing is, yeah it is harder to cook a pizza in a WSM, but once you get immersed in the art of grilling and smoking, you realize that you make Pizza's about once a month anyways and the extra work you put in, to make it actually wood fired is worth it."

smoking,3d9vek,FriedBagel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:28 2015 UTC,My dad and I use a Brinkmann Trailmaster  Limited Edition offset smoker. We got it at Home Depot for about 300. It is a heavier gauge than most store bought smokers and can handle a wood fire with no problem. For the most part it is ready to go out of the box but you'll need to buy a thermometer with it as the lid thermometer isn't accurate for meat level temps.
smoking,3d9vek,asaikens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good price with high reviews. Do you use wood only and have you ever used charcoal in the smoker as well? Not very familiar with smoking, but if you use wood can you still put flavored wood chips on there, or is that more a charcoal thing?"
smoking,3d9vek,Lincoln_Hawk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"You can use charcoal and/or wood. The wood is the flavor, no need to use chips which are just smaller pieces of the wood you are burning. The wood chips aren't flavored, just different types of wood which give off a different taste."
smoking,3d9vek,asaikens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"We use charcoal as the main fuel and add wood chunks for flavor. You can buy bags of chunks for $7 at Walmart in several different kinds of wood. The chips burn up really fast and don't give off much smoke, but the chunks work well."
smoking,3d9vek,Arcanis117,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"Get him a pecos old country offset smoker. The steel is thick, smoke stack is at grate level, welding is solid, it's all around a great piece of equipment for someone looking to get serious about cooking with only wood. I bought one online and it shipped as 1 piece for 64 bucks practically across the U.S. It's 400 bucks and I really think it's the best value if your looking for an offset stick burner in that price range. I couldn't be happier with mine. He should be prepared to devote a good 16 hours to nursing a fire tho for a decent sized brisket, but that's the whole fun in it. It's truly a craft. Also warning, this smoker does NOT come with a temp gauge. You'll have to buy one that fits the pre drilled hole in the smoker. Make sure the thermometer comes with the necessary nut as well."
smoking,3d9vek,oh_look_a_fist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"Is there a specific reason you're looking for a wood only smoker? I was looking into getting a smoker recently, and thought I'd get exactly this: a wood only smoker. What I didn't realize is that most personal smokers that aren't gas or electric use charcoal as the fuel, and add wood chunks for smoke. I decided on the Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM) 18.5"" for $300. They also make a 14"" for $200 and a 22"" for $400.   Could these smokers handle wood as their only fuel? I'm not sure. I've read that if you were to use wood as your source of heat AND smoke, is that you'd need to burn the wood you use as fuel down a bit. Wood is used for smoke/flavor, not really for fuel. It's been pointed out that using wood for fuel and smoking can get pricey, and could require more temperature maintenance. The solution for this is to use a mix of charcoal and wood.  In my opinion, for the price range you listed, you would do best to look at charcoal smoker. The WSM is a tried-and-true smoker, with a lot of resources on the web. It is a vertical smoker. There are horizontal/off-set smokers, but I don't know them as well. You could go with the one /u/asaikens mentioned.  I've seen commercial and competition wood fuel smokers, but those are exponentially greater than your budget."
smoking,3d9n4e,bfinleyui,2,Tue Jul 14 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"Also, I'll likely be trying a 3-1-1, or maybe even like a 3.5/.5/1 this time around.  They were falling off the bone last time.  Which (as a rib novice in general) were plenty delicious, but I'm told that's not how they're best served, so I'll be aiming for bite marks this next time around."
smoking,3d9n4e,Destiny_Seeker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"Too tender and they can be a bit more of a mess than usual, but if the taste is on point I wouldn't mind. But if I can't have a hold on the bone and eat them without them falling apart, it's the slight hassle that you don't expect with ribs.   Sorry I can't comment on a solution to your problem, I've never done ribs myself and my friends that do all have fairly large offset smokers."

It might be a little tight but as they cook down it'll free up some room. If they overlap you can just rotate every hour or so.    I wouldn't wrap them. It seems like every time I wrap my ribs they end up being overcooked. Just do the bounce test starting about 5 hours in. If it begins to break they're done. If not, check again in 15 minutes."

It's too easy to pick up a $5 bag of wood chunks at your local Walmart and avoid the risk.    If you have pecan trees in your area, now's the time to go scouting neighborhoods for wood chunks.  Pecan trees tend to grow very tall, and their lower branches get weak and threaten houses.  They have to be trimmed fairly often, and sometimes they simply grow so tall that they have to be removed.   I'm in south Louisiana, and you can ride down the road in a pickup right now and come home with enough smoker wood for a year."

Yeah some fall through but most stay on top.  I put two igniters (those paraffin weber tablets or some paraffin wood tumbleweed things I found at Lowes) then build a small pyramid around them.  Then I light and wait until everything burns white, occasionally blowing on it so that I singe my eyebrows and go temporarily blind.  Once the coals are white, I put soaked wood chips in a steel smoker box then put the box directly on the coals or bigger chunks of wood directly on the coals, then place on the smoking stone, drip pan, grate and bring it up to temp.  I would say a key is not using too many coals (fuel) to start out.  Then once up to heat I manage via the vents and if need be, opening the top.  Both vents wide open = hotter.  Both vents closed = cooler (puts the fire out).  Something in between, both vents open slightly = managed temp."

Then I set the bottom at 2, top at 1/4 open til 175, then bottom at 1, top at 1/8 til around 215, then bottom 1, top just past the half moons. This will steady out the temp around 230-240.

If I do this again, and at some point I probably will, I would go low and slow with this. The amount of fat in the skin makes it difficult to get crispy, and treating duck like a chicken just doesn't cut it. The skin was very much improved after 4 hours in the oven at about 230-240. Initially, I had it on the smoker for about 2 hours at 300, until an internal temp of 160 was reached.  I was very happy with how the flavor turned out - 1 duck I did salt + 5 spice, the other I did salt+pepper+cinnamon+brown sugar+nutmeg+mace. I used cherry wood chips with this as well. I think I enjoyed the second spice rub more than the first, but I think I'd add brown sugar to the salt+5 spice mix."

smoking,3d6iyt,SiON42X,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:15:45 2015 UTC,The guides I read recommended that holes be poked in the skin every inch or so to let the fat drain. I would think that spatchcocking would eliminate the need for that but perhaps not. Maybe it would make the skin crispier.

Was able to keep the smoker between 200-250 from 8PM when it went on to about 7AM when I added more hickory for the last time.  At 8AM, the fire was mostly dead, and the internal temp at the flat was at about 170, when I stopped putting smoke into it.  I couldn't believe it had cooked that quick. Wrapped it in foil and put it in the oven at 250 until 11, when it temped at 195. Shut off the oven and let it rest in the foil till 1PM. Sliced and served.   Came out very tender, juicy, and with a great bark. The smoke ring was a little thinner than I'm used to, but mostly because this brisket seemed VERY fatty.

smoking,3d7kw9,andreas_borealis,3,Tue Jul 14 03:26:30 2015 UTC,Stop using chips and use chunks. Chips burn too fast and don't give you a good smolder for smoke. As far as placement you just put 3-4 chunks spread out on the coals. Some near hot coals others by unlit coals to add smoke later. Just remember that most meat stops taking smoke around 140° degrees.

smoking,3d7kw9,dinosaursandsluts,2,Tue Jul 14 11:22:17 2015 UTC,Wrap a handful of chips in foil to keep them from just erupting into flames and they'll smoke better. Not as good as chunks still but it'll work until you get rid of the chips.

smoking,3d7kw9,dayflyer55,2,Thu Jul 16 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"Either use chunks like /u/mecrob says, or take some aluminum foil, wrap up a handful or two of wood chips in the foil, and poke some holes in the top with a fork or knife.  This way, they put out a longer and more steady stream of smoke.  You may need to do 2-3 packets throughout the smoke, depending on what you are cooking and for how long."
smoking,3d78k3,abstract_buffalo,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:58 2015 UTC,The thickness of the brisket is an important factor here some are thin and long some are short and chubby. Thin ones will cook much faster. Also what did you wrap in? Foil? Are you checking the temperature right by where the meat sits?

I've seen some pretty big margins before between dome or door temp and grate temps. Not sure how your smoker is setup but it's possible you could be smoking the meat at a higher temp than what the door is reading. That does seem pretty fast so I would investigate the grate temp first. If you are rendering out the fat in that short of a time and getting the meat to 205 in 5.5 hours for 12 pounds, I'd be willing to bet you are cooking hotter than 250."

smoking,3d5pab,jeuclid,2,Mon Jul 13 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"I made his recipe (from the book) multiple times. I have one brining in the fridge right now! What I do is ensure complete coverage of the meat in the brine. I find a pot, plastic bucket or plastic box that will hold the brisket and fill it with water until the brisket is submerged. I then measure the amount of water I used. I Then adjust all ingredients quantity to my amount of water. You will see that the amount of water depends more on the size of your bucket than the size of the brisket.  For example (the original recipe):   4 quarts of water (1 gallon) 6 ounces or 3/4 cups Morton’s kosher salt (or 200 grams if measuring water in liters) 3 ounces or ½ cup sugar (100 grams) 2 teaspoons pink salt (sodium nitrite), optional 5 cloves garlic, smashed with the flat side of a knife 2 tablespoons pickling spice   If I need 6 quarts of water to cover my brisket I go with   6 quarts of water (1 gallon) 9 ounces or 1 cups (and 2 Tablespoon) Morton’s kosher salt (or 300 grams if measuring water in liters) 4.5 ounces or 3/4 cup sugar (150 grams) 3 teaspoons pink salt (sodium nitrite), optional 7-8 cloves garlic, smashed with the flat side of a knife 3 tablespoons pickling spice   You don't wrap! This is pastrami not Texas Style brisket. I take it out of the smoker when the meat reaches 160 °F.  If you don't steam it, it's better to cut it pretty thin for serving. If you do steam it, it's amazingly good!  Other advice: I keep the smoker pretty low (210-215) to ensure that the pastrami takes on a lot of smoke."

From that point, how long does it usually take to steam to 200? I'm doing a 9lb brisket and just want to make sure I set aside enough time.  Thanks again"
smoking,3d5pab,jimtk,2,Wed Jul 15 14:57:11 2015 UTC,"Time varies wildly depending on temp, meat shape, starting temp and even which smoker I use (in winter I use a kamado, in summer a WSM). around 6-7 hours should be enough. I'm smoking mine today (after 10 days in brine) so I should have more detail (with temp graph) tonight.   The advantage is you don't have to steam right after the smoke. I usually steam at least a day after smoking. Once smoked, I vacuum pack and put it in the fridge. I very often steam it a week later So there's no hurry. Start your brisket early, and it's not a problem if it cools down before steaming. I usually steam for 1 hours.   When you get it out of the brine don't forget to wash it under cold running water and blot dry with paper towel before putting the rub on. It's a surprisingly important step.  Good luck !"

smoking,3d5pab,jimtk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:56 2015 UTC,3 days is what Rulhman prescribed in his book (Charcuterie) so you should be OK.

There are some recipes/practices that recommend temps below that range for a really long time, so regardless of space that's something you'd have to consider.  I'm not bagging on PBC. It was either the PBC or the WSM, and I went with the WSM."
smoking,3d4jyz,ifartedhaha,4,Mon Jul 13 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"The PCB is really just an UDS.  You can dial in any temp really if you play around with the vent.  I just did a 10 hour smoke at 200 the whole time.  I've had it up to 400 as well.  The instructions state not to mess with the vent cover, thus their statement on the temps, but there's no real reason not to."
smoking,3d4jyz,BonquiquiShiquavius,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:43:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. I've only read anecdotes about people not being able to get below 275.
smoking,3d4jyz,ifartedhaha,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"I find the starting temp is crucial.  If you only use a half chimney to start it up, it's pretty easy to keep a low temp.  But if you use a whole chimney, you're going to have a tough time getting the temp down."
smoking,3d4jyz,BonquiquiShiquavius,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"How do you keep low temps if you're only using half a chimney to start up? How are you adding more coal for an extended cook? Just curious, maybe I'll pick up a PBC in the future"
smoking,3d4jyz,Talented_MrRipley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:52:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I only light half a chimney's worth of charcoal, but I dump it on a full basket of unlit charcoal.  When I dump the lit charcoal, I try to keep it in a small pile.  Basically the minion method.   For a cheap smoker, it works really well. It's not perfect, but it does the trick."
smoking,3d4jyz,zachbrevis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"This makes sense. I fill the basket up, then remove about a half of a chimney worth of coals (~40 bricks) and the coals will last about 8 hours... I like the idea of ALWAYS starting the cooker off with the vent totally closed and then adjusting it after coal dump."
smoking,3d4jyz,nightshifter,2,Fri Jul 17 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a UDS or WSM unless you can invest in a quality offset.  I owned a Pit Barrel for two years and loved it - you don't really need to access the coals. I now use a WSM and can get 12+ hours of even temps out of a single load of charcoal and wood chunks.  250 deg. F. with one vent adjustment.  Stay away from the cheap offsets. Apparently they are a real pain to manage -- you'll spend a lot of time trying to keep your temperature consistent because they are poorly designed and made with thin metal.  You'll likely have to modify them to no end to get them to work ok. I don't believe you can get anything worth while below $400.  The closest I've seen is the offset Aaron Franklin uses in his videos, which I believe is an Old Country Pits Pecos Coal Burner (roughly $500 at Academy).

smoking,3d4umk,hugosalvatore,3,Mon Jul 13 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"I have the same grill with the side fire-box. Personally, I'm a big fan of it. Yes, you burn through a lot of fuel to get the temperature up, but if you flip over the charcoal grate in the main chamber, it will keep things nice and even, giving you a huge surface to smoke on.   What you're proposing though would probably work well, but limit your surface area. I would suggest dropping the smokestack down to grate level. It made a huge difference in how much smoke got in the meat, and I think it helped with the temperature control.   It may be worth your while to fashion a new grate for the charcoal to make sure you still get good airflow but can still keep the fire low enough."
smoking,3d4umk,Fiddlebanjo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:29:38 2015 UTC,"I never thought to flip the grate over. Great idea.

smoking,3d3civ,Destiny_Seeker,2,Mon Jul 13 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"That is the same question my gf asked. I have not done anything specific, its just I think Brisket cooking is an art slowly learned by practice. I have read every thread on the subject, every book and article I could get my hands on, tried 225,250,275,325, naked, foiled, butcher papered, different rubs, prime choice select CAB, different manufacturers...... In the end, it all comes down to experience. Cook a lot of briskets and mysteriously you start doing things right. What are those right things? I am not sure.  The one above you, see was cooked for 8.5 hours @250-300, yeah temp control was not good, I had bunch of other things to do. It was smoked with hickory wood chunks, an amount most of you would call ""too much"", the trim was a hack job, I felt like I trimmed too much and did not have a ""great"" shape, rub was salt and pepper, again an amount that would have been called ""too much"" by many. Rested in a cooler wrapped in a towel for 2 hours, where it actually lost some juice, I think the towels absorbed them.  So it was too hot, too fast, too much smoke, to much rub, +-50F sloppy temperature control, I think it was choice grade, hack job trimming and it was the best brisket I made and head and shoulders better than any BBQ restaurants I have been to in LA."

The brisket was jiggling on all 3 axis randomly all at the same time and I was like, ""gents, I declare this brisket done"".   As I was taking it off the heat, I did take its temperature to make sure and the point was at 205 and the flat was at 202."

smoking,3d6v2y,godsocks,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:59:18 2015 UTC,I'm a little confused with your question. First difference is one is a grill and the other is a smoker. A grill cooks over direct heat and a smoker cooks with indirect heat low and slow. It's good for rendering fat and adding flavor and is a completely different process than grilling. Your grill is charcoal but there other fuels that can be used for grilling like propane. Your smoker is propane but there are others out there that use charcoal or wood. The question of fuels is different than the question between grill and smoker. As far as your neighbors there is nothing you can do besides moving the smoker away from them. Not sure what your smoke stack looks like but you could extend with ducting if it would help blow smoke away from say a neighbor's window. I'm not sure what your area looks like.

smoking,3d1837,crazykitty123,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"...are you from THAT silencerco, or just a fan?   Anyway, the smoke flavor is EXTREMELY mild.  I tried tossing multiple vendors pellets into it, and nothing came close to straight-up wood sticks.  Mesquite, which is sort of easy to oversmoke when using charcoal+wood was barely noticeable.  Also, the bark formation left a lot to the imagination.  While I'm not a fan of super-crusty bark, SOME of it is really nice.    On top of that, the fucker kept getting jammed up.  I'd have to remove the grill and pull out the unburned pellets.  Yes, I know you have to adjust the auger rate for temperature (so says Traeger themselves) but it got out of hand.    My solution?  Smoke stuff in batches, leave the oven on warm, and consider buying a small green egg or something at some point.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the food that comes out of the Traegers was bad by any means.  I'm just saying that they don't toss out enough smoke for me."
smoking,3d1837,Hausnelis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"I've been using mine for a year, never had any issues like that. In my opinion it has the perfect amount of bark and smoke flavor. If I don't wrap my pork butts, I think I have too much bark on the bottom. It's delicious but very crusty, so makes pulling it difficult. I've never over-smoked anything, but I think that's a good thing. I had some charcoal smoked ribs last week off a coworker's new smoker, and it tasted like ash. He's just getting used to it, so he probably did something wrong, but I don't know. Maybe it's me and the Traeger, but I enjoy it.  And I'm not from any Silencerco."

Its easy to set up and control temps, there is a huge following with helpful tips, tricks and recipes.  And if you get a chimney for starting it up, its a piece of cake.  Pair it with an iGrill.  Get one with multiple probes so you have an ambient and some meat probes.  You can set a temp band on your phone and it will alarm when your grill temp is at the limit... gets too low, walk outside and tweak open your control vent.  Too hot, tweak it shut.

smoking,3cz5pv,iBird,6,Sun Jul 12 02:43:06 2015 UTC,Awesome. I actually smoke in my Weber kettle all the time. One thing I use for the bottom vents is foil tape. Cover two and leave one open. Not sure if that is what you meant by foiling them. Saw somewhere that a guy drilled a hole in his kettle at the level of his grill grate that was big enough to put his thermapen probe in to check temps and covered with some foam tape over it.   Overall nice job. I hear you on making your own rub. I make a big batch which lasts me two or three cooks.

smoking,3cz5pv,shuddertostink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"OP, my only question is how did you regulate temp? Did you ever have to add charcoal to it throughout the smoke? I have a weber kettle and have never smoked anything in it because I have a masterbuilt electric smoker and it is boring me and ready to try something different"
smoking,3cz5pv,muhaski,2,Sun Jul 12 13:22:15 2015 UTC,"Yes I did. Not sure if you clicked the link but I went into this part a bit. The temps would go from 225 to 275 but mostly stayed right at 250 which is what I was aiming towards.  I live in NorCal and while were actually known for good weather, this day was completely off! It was very warm in the morning then go colder and colder and then windy then about 6 hours in we had a light sprinkle of rain (and were in a drought so that in itself was just bizarre.)  But yes, I did add some but like I said, on the imgur album descriptions I explained it a bit better. But the TL;DR depending on what you're doing (like a butt or a brisket) use a lot (like 50-60+) unlit coals and stack them ""minion"" method or snake method. I then added 18 or so WHITE hot coals I lit up on a bbq chimney. Then I through three big chunks of wood on top of all of that. About 2 hours in I added roughly 15 unlit coals and 15 lit coals. Then eventually added a little bit more and 1 more big chunk of wood. All this could have been prevented for the most part by just having more unlit coals stacked up, I only started out with around 20, which was a big big mistake.  Hope this helps, and honestly, it was a lot of fun. If you wanna try something diff, keep your eye open for a good deal on some ribs or butts and try it out (I'm still took timid for the brisket currently, in due time though.) I REALLY love my weber and have had it so long that cooking on it is super personal to me and it has a great seasoning on it from all my grillin/smoking.  Let me know if you have any questions, seriously, I've been tinkering with this for awhile.  One thing to make everything easier for you is to use the smokenator http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/smokenator_tips.html which I do not have but did make a makeshift sorta one myself."
smoking,3cz5pv,shuddertostink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"So is this mutton, or is there a difference?"
smoking,3cz5pv,shuddertostink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, pork butt is very different from mutton, which is lamb.  Mutton is a very dark meat, darker than beef, and has a more wild taste than beef. Pork is much more commonly found in the US, has a less strong flavor and is more traditional for bbq.  Pork is a light meat; the pork industry association for years marketed it as ""the other white meat"" when health concerns about eating too much red meat became popularized."
smoking,3cz5pv,shuddertostink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:37:30 2015 UTC,Mutton is meat from an adult sheep.  Lamb is a sheep within its first year.  Pretty much veal vs beef.
smoking,3cz5pv,HeadOfMax,2,Sun Jul 12 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"oh cool, didn't know that - thanks !   Do you think the food stores stick to that, or do they just generically call it all ""lamb""  ?"
smoking,3cz5pv,moesdad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Most places in the US here only carry lamb. You may find a really good meat market, or a specialized meat shop (something Mediterranean would be my best bet) carrying it, but for the most part I do not see it any any grocery or outlet stores, at least here in the Bay Area. I've done a TON of research and been into a bunch of places selling meat around here and not once have I seen it sold as ""mutton."" Ask around though, sometimes if a place doesn't carry it, it's worth asking if they know someone who does, especially if you're asking at a full type service butcher shop/market. On top of that, check your local farmer's markets, they also may have ideas/sources."
smoking,3d0kc4,shuddertostink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:23:24 2015 UTC,ohh chili powder for the rub? sounds bomb. have a recipe?
smoking,3d0kc4,compromised_username,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"It's s not actually a chile powder, it's actually chile.  That's it.  Dried, ground Dixon Hatch Chiles, not recipe and nothing else to it, I just covered the pork in it.    I buy the chile online from the Chile Shop in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  I discovered that shop while on a business trip and have been buying them ever since (mail order).   The hatch chile is the famous ""green chile"" of New Mexico (now becoming pervasive in Colorado as well, although it may not be the same chile as the famous Hatch, New Mexico variety.     Served green, it's a great, brightly flavored chile with just enough kick to satisfy a pepperhead, yet not offend those with milder palates.   In the right parts of the country it's actually pervasive in the cuisine, served as both ingredients in dishes as well as sauces as condiments. I've had the famous ""green chile"" in quiche, omelets and anything else you can think of.  In New Mexico specifically it's companion is Red chile, and you can order a combination of the two as ""Christmas"".  When dried and ground this chile takes on a completely different persona, from a milder brighter flavor to a remarkably dark, robust, earthy tasting chile that actually reminds me a bit of roasted coffee beans.  I use this chile in everything.  It plays a prominent role in my brisket rub, which I intentionally keep simple, savory and spicy.   It' also plays a smaller role however in my rib rub, which is a complex brown sugar based rub.  It goes in my chili, it goes in my blackening mix.. it has essentially replaced cayenne and ground chipotle as my go to pepper now.    The only areas I won't use it are Asian or Indian preparations, which very specifically call for their own unique heat sources.  For any SouthWestern/Mexi/TexMexi meals though it's an awesome chile.   I still eat jalapenos, both fresh and pickled.  I still love my Tabasco sauce, but for a chile powder this is my favorite by far now."
smoking,3d1p1s,dlgeek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't answer your question. I think it is the point. Some people call incorrectly call the point the deckle. To delineate, between the deckle on the ribeye (spinalis) and the point that they incorrectly call a deckle, they call it a chuck deckle. It kind of makes sense because the brisket sits below the chuck section of the cow. I would cook it at 275 until it's done."
smoking,3d1p1s,StraightoutaBrompton,0,Mon Jul 13 20:33:42 2015 UTC,The deckle is the thin layer of meat under the brisket between the layers of fat.
smoking,3d1p1s,whitecrane,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"You fellows don't know how Google works? The deckle, when they talk about steak is the cap on the ribeye steak. It kind of looks like an eyebrow. There was some guy I don't remember who said that he always eats the deckle first in case he dies before he can finish the rest. The deckle in this case is awesome. The deckle can also defined as: the fat, and connective tissue that attaches the point to the rib cage. In this instance it is not so awesome. If you are eating what we call a brisket in Texas and a packer everywhere else, you are most likely eating IMPS No 120: beef brisket, deckle off, boneless. It's confusing because there are different standards and parlance that people use to call the same thing. In brisket terms, when you hear aaron Franklin or someone say they are removing the deckle, what they mean is they are cleaning up any leftover pieces of the deckle that the processing plant left behind. It it will be the side opposite of the fat cap."

The great advantage is that you can use it in your kitchen.    I've seen it used to smoke a remoulade sauce.  The sauce, about 2 cups, was spread out in a 13x9 pan to increase surface area, covered with plastic, then the hose used to add smoke. Then they let it sit for 15 minutes, then stirred the smoke in.

I used my base brisket rub (salt, pepper, granulated garlic) with one small twist. I was out of salt anyway, and while I typically have always used table salt, a buddy of mine who runs a BBQ joint swore by using coarse salt, and I figured since I'm trying new things this weekend... why not...  Never going to use table salt again.   I used it sparingly per his recommendation and let it sit overnight. I've tended to go a bit on the heavier side with the table salt in the past in an effort to get better bark. This worked out much better. The meat had a perfect balance to accent it's natural flavor.   For the cook, I put the smoker at 225F with hickory for about an hour and a half (meat was about 26oz.) until the internal temp hit 120F. Pulled it off and had the grill white hot and seared it for 90 seconds on each side. Absolutely marvelous! Will be doing this again!"

Last time I called him looking for tri tip, I showed up and found 6 of them wrapped up for me.  5 of them are still parked in my freezer."

Beef ribs cut from the ribeye are called back ribs and have the meat between the bones. The beef ribs most Texas bbq joints serve are beef short ribs and are cut lower in the rib cage, have more meat, have the meat on top of the bone, and have more marbling and collagen. You can get them cut from the chuck or from the plate. The plates are larger and more uniform."

I don't adjust my vents, mostly because they're all  stuck and rusted, but also because I found that my que does better when I STOP MESSING WITH IT than when I constantly tweak it trying to get a perfect 225.  Yep, I get variations, I think it adds character to the que and it still comes out great.      -Personally I think messing with it every 30 minutes is too often, but if this was on a Weber that's a pretty small area and you're cooking directly on top the of the heat source so I don't know how that affects everything, I use a cheap sidebox.   -To me there's alot more to great q than just the tenderness - while I definitely shoot for tender, I've had incredibly tender yet flavorless q that may as well have been cooked in an oven.  I wouldn't worry too much about whether they came out perfectly tender or not and focus more on the overall awesomeness of it."

Baby backs will only need five hours probably. I do a 2-2-1 with those. Two on smoke, two in foil, and finish one outside the foil.   Dry rub.

smoking,3cxeo5,shuddertostink,0,Sat Jul 11 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:   I wouldn't rub or sauce everything the same way.  I've only smoked pork a few times and didn't bother seasoning it at all; it all got pulled and sauced on the sandwhiches anyhow.   Brisket rub should be different than rib rub IMO.  JUST IMO.  For brisket I use New Mexico hatch peppers I buy mail order and use them as the base, with onion and garlic; I like to keep that one simple and hot.   For ribs I use brown sugar as a base and then add a LOT of stuff, but only a hint of peppers (usually cayenne or hatch, and some ground black pepper).   This is my personal preference, great thing is its YOUR Que, do what makes you smile :)   I wouldn't start them all at the same time... I'd try to get them to come off roughly the same time. If something does come off early, you can cooler them as you stated, but remember that the meat will continue cooking even off the smoker for a bit.  Don't know what else to say there though; I've never  had the problem of que coming off early.   Always the opposite for me ;)   To reheat, use a steam basket.  Don't just put it in the oven...by steaming it you'll get it ""falling off the bone"" moist, always you may lose some of your bark or your rub may get a bit pasty.   I don't think the ribs will take 6 hours ... I've only done a few back ribs but they're really small and light compared to spareribs... I think my last batch was  maybe 4 hours total if even that.   If you want to marinate, I recently experimented with 4 different racks of back ribs.  Each was marinated differently:    ""Chinese rib"" sauce, a recipe online.   Didn't come out like chinese restaurant ribs though. Some commercial hoisin style marinade Can't remember the other one but it doesn't matter because the mega winner was:  Chinese chili oil.   You know that paste of hot peppers they have on the table in restaurants ? You can buy that by the jarfull.  I added extra oil to thin it and make it more of a marinate, and soaked the ribs in it over night.  Everyone agreed these ribs were the best.  Firey, tasty, they were just awesome.     Maintaining heat: get to know  your vents, and open them over time instead of adding more wood. And stop looking at the damn thing. Everytime you open that door you swing the temperature... check it half as often as you think you need to, or use an outboard thermometer.  I like to use wood and coal from the start, and all the way through.  There are techniques you can try such as building a mound of coal and wood, and putting your lit starters on TOP of it; since the heat goes up they don't all ignite but rather the fire ""settles down"" and keeps the heat going.  The idea being that if you do it right the rate of it keeps the temperatures even.  I've tried this, even built metal pyramid shaped grates for it ... it DID help, but now I just add more wood and coal as I think it's called for.  No, I do not get steady temperatures, and I'm okay with that the que is great either way.  I have a lazy electric, and although it maintains perfect temperature, the que off my stick burner is always better and honestly I'm beginning to think that it's because of the variations in temperature.     Good luck man, now I'm thinking of running out to the butcher !!"
smoking,3cxeo5,shuddertostink,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"Great advice. I'll probably try two different rubs on the ribs just to experiment (seeing as I'm already making two different bbq sauces this should be interesting).   The steam basket is a good idea for reheating. I don't know if I'll have to reheat, hopefully I can get my timing down.  Maintaining heat was difficult for me last time. I started with the vents wide open then left them half open the remainder...that might be the source of my trouble."

smoking,3cy1cj,Cdresden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"The meat absorbs heat from the smoke, cooling the smoke in the process.  The more meat you put in your smoker, the more it will lengthen your total smoke time.  However, it's not going to slow things down very much.  If you normally smoke 10 lbs of meat in a WSM 18.5 (2 5-lb butts), smoking 30 lbs (6 5-lb butts) might add about an hour to your smoke time."

I have no experience with ceramic grills, FWIW.   The thing I like most about the Yoder is the range of temps you can achieve. I can set it at 150f to smoke salmon without a worry, or crank it up to 600f to grill or make wood fired pizzas. The ""set and forget"" aspect is great too, I can start a pork shoulder or brisket the night before I want to serve the food and it will be done by noon if I crutch it. There's zero learning curve with temperature management on the pellet grills too.   I have both the Yoder and a gas grill, and primarily use the Yoder for slow and low cooking. The separate grill is nice if I want to take the food off the smoker, and then throw it on the grill to crisp up the outside; chicken wings for example. Alternatively, I could just crank the smoker up to 300 or so and achieve the same effect. I'm not sure if you'd have the same option with the Primo.   I do not have the grilling attachments for my Yoder. I have found that I don't need them to make great steaks. I spent the extra money for the second rack and its great if you're trying to cook a lot of food. They definitely fill up quick if you're trying to do a bunch of ribs or salmon fillets.

It has been so rainy here and I've been busy on the dry days that I've just had to stare at this thing on my deck.   Rather than spend $60 on a brisket flat (7.79 /lb yikes) that I had a high chance of messing up I decided on the $6 value pack of chicken legs for the test run. While looking up how long to do them for I saw a video where they lollipop them like this and decided to give it a go.   I brined them with brown sugar and salt for 3-4 hours and after drying them off I seasoned and smoked with royal oak lump and some apple chunks for about 2 hours before I pulled them off and added some sauce for another 15 minutes.   Pretty happy with how they turned out. Not sure if the lollipop prep was worth it but it was easier to eat and made a more condensed mass of meat to cook. Can't wait to use it again.

smoking,3cx204,Pikeman212a7a,4,Sat Jul 11 15:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, well worth going through the effort.  If you haven't already, rinse, rinse, rinse the roast well with fresh cool water. Pat roast dry and set on a tray/cookie sheet in the fridge for a day - primarily to let the meat dry out.   After a day of fridge draining/drying, rub the roast with a fine coat of vegetable oil (canola or peanut are good, soy is also acceptable) and do a medium coat of dry rub. Too much rub, and your smoking 'bark' is mostly dried spices, so use a gentle hand with your dry rub. Also, due to the long brine-time, I'd select or concoct a dry rub which is very light on salt, if any is used at all!  Yes, your brine most likely broke down the cell walls of your meat with great efficacy and fattened up the cut with unnecessary liquid gain. Drying and re-seasoning your roast, in conjunction with the wonderful culinary magic of slow-smoking, will still produce more than satisfactory results!  Post pics!"

I saw some that were advertised for other types of sausages but had a 25mm thick casing and even lower.  And at the beginning of my smoke I dried out the casings further to give more snap (might do less time in the future because they were really snappy).  If you do that, try not drying them and and go straight to smoking."

smoking,3cs7bk,Bogey_Kingston,5,Fri Jul 10 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"Your color and moistness look just great.  I prefer the grind on my smoked sausage more toward the COARSE side, but that's a personal choice.  Did you use any curing agents (Tender Quick or Cure #1)?  They will give you a pinkish tint, and I believe they help with moistness too, but the biggest advantage is that you can overshoot the 4 hour safety window, and you can pull the sausages at a lower internal temp (155°).  Something I can see in your future is using HI-TEMP cheese, for a chile/cheese kind of wurst.  My buddy uses about 30% beef in his, also uses TenderQuick and does a grind similar to yours. We trade sausages back and forth each time one of us makes a batch."
smoking,3cs7bk,beefox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:09:36 2015 UTC,"I like mine a little more finely ground BUT on this sausage I ground with a coarse plate then a fine plate and it was at the thickness I'd like. Then when I tried to use the sausage attachment in the grinder it wouldn't push the meat through unless I used a grinder plate with the sausage attachment, so I was forced to third grind that I didn't want to do. I don't think it made that much of a difference though.  I used cure #1 after the first coarse grind and let it cure in the fridge overnight  And yes! I would've done the hi temp cheese this time but I was in a rush just a few days before 4th of July and couldn't order it. Also just wanted to keep things simple for my first time"
smoking,3cs7bk,Strelock,2,Fri Jul 10 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"It's rare to find a grinder/stuffer combination that excels at both, the KA grinder for example is fine for me (20 or 30 pound batches), but their stuffer is horrible.  I use a dedicated upright model and really like the job it does.  Often, grinding twice through the same plate is better than downsizing the plate, this can overwork the sausage and make it hard to stuff.  Also if your seasoning is higher in salt, and it sits overnight, it can make it hard to stuff too. Lastly if your ice water is not super cold, that can make it harder to stuff as well. Some markets use handfulls of shaved ice when they load their stuffers. I generally add a little new ice water to each bucket of meat right before stuffing just for insurance. Lastly, not flushing the casings and not giving them enough time to soak can cause stuffing problems."
smoking,3cs7bk,notanalter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"I was already looking into one of those upright, dedicated sausage stuffer! haha.  I'm glad to hear they work well, I was a little unsure of them at first.    I'll have to remember all that for next time, thank you so much for that advice.  And yes, it did get progressively harder to push through each time.  I kept putting the meat back in the freezer and only taking out what I was going to grind immediately.  I need to keep everything colder; the bowls, the meat, I just recently read a lot of people put all of the stuffing attachments/stuffer in the fridge/freezer beforehand as well.  I started to put cubes of ice in with my meat this first time but I was worried about the ice melting and having way too much water that the meat would be floating around in.  Is this a problem or do you just drain as much water as you can after griding?  Lastly, I gave the casing plenty of time to soak but what is ""flushing"" them and what does it do?"

smoking,3csj98,psuskifan,3,Fri Jul 10 12:40:28 2015 UTC,"Lamb ribs are more delicate due to their size, but you are generally cooking lamb racks to medium rare.  It all depends on the fire if your bones will darken or not.  The Pitmasters didn't want to take the chance from an appearance point of view, so they wrapped the bones.  Did you notice the slick trick with the string to strip the meat? This is easier than working with a parring knife.  Here is a bone in rack of pork (crown roast) that cooks close to two hours (part of the cook is indirect and the finish is direct) and you can see the bones are not looking too dark.  You don't really need ""several hours"" in the foil for ribs, that will likely over cook them.  I check for tenderness after 45 minutes, and if the rack is really meaty I might let them ride another 15 to 30 minutes."
smoking,3csj98,3rdIQ,2,Fri Jul 10 13:17:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the great info.  That string strip method was incredible.  The first time I did ribs I did something like 2:30 bone down, 2:00 foil, 45 no foil.  I should have just done 3-2-1 and my smoker wasn't hot enough so they still were not tender enough.  If your bark becomes soggy due to the foil do you ""crisp"" it back up out of the foil or cheat in a broiler?"
smoking,3csj98,3rdIQ,3,Fri Jul 10 13:23:11 2015 UTC,"Any of the time-step-cook methods for ribs (3-2-1, 2-1-1, etc.) are just an easy way for folks to keep track of which group of times works best for them.  The actual 3-2-1 times were used on full slabs of spare ribs, this might work if they were trimmed down to a St Louis cut, but is generally too much time if they are baby back ribs.  Pit temp, and especially pit temp at the grate is important.  Most factory thermometers are in a lid or door on a smoker and are not giving you the ""acutal"" grate temp. A cheap oven thermometer will let you know exactly what is happening close to your meat.  Wrapping will soften the bark, when I wrap mine I go meat down. Yes, you can return the rack to the smoker to firm it up, or one of my tricks is to finish them meat up on a foil tray, this way you can still trap liquid, like apple juice under them while the bark on top sets back up."

smoking,3cq6cc,pirotecnico54,2,Thu Jul 9 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"On July 3rd, I did a surprise birthday party for my godson. I smoked some ribs and Peruvian style chicken. Temps were around 250 - 275 for the ribs and bumped up to about 325 when the chicken came in. Rub for the ribs were paprika, kosher salt, black peppers, brown sugar, slap your mamma, and almonds. Bbq sauce was just some cheap kraft bbq sauce we had with some brown sugar and honey added. Chicken marinade involved a lot, so I can send you an excel I have with the info if you'd like. I was worried the increase in temp would mess up the ribs or dry them, but since they were wrapped, they came out so good and falling off the bone.   Edit: My smoker is an Oklahoma Joe Highland  Edit 2: I now have a half a rack of ribs, and 2 half pieces of chicken that have been vacuum sealed and are now in my freezer for another time! There is no such thing as overcooking. Have to take advantage of the smoke."

I used about 1/4 cup of Meathead's Memphis Dust on each rack of spare ribs.    We also had some beef roasts that we threw on as an after thought. I think there were 2 rump roasts, a chuck roast, and a shoulder roast.  I  injected them with beef broth and rubbed with S.P.O.G. (Salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder)    In total there were 6 racks of ribs and 4 beef roasts. We ended up smoking with hickory at about 225 - 235 for about 7 hours, which was about an hour too long. We had to leave to save my brother-in-law's boat from sinking."

It's a bit paranoid but I'd rather be safe. In this instance you're doing the right thing. Beef doesn't carry as high of a temp requirement so it's best to have it on top.

But if you're smoking meat, wouldn't you be brining the temp up to 180 or whatever. That's way beyond the safe zone for poultry. Am I missing something?"

smoking,3cocgo,lateralex,9,Thu Jul 9 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"I'd start it tonight. If your smoker has been trustworthy in the past, it should be fine now. You don't want to try to rush it by putting it on in the morning."
smoking,3cocgo,Gently_Farting,2,Thu Jul 9 14:16:07 2015 UTC,"Good suggestion. I guess it could easily take 12hrs, and then I would have to skip resting the brisket for an hour or two, which would probably make it come out pretty dry..."
smoking,3cocgo,Gently_Farting,3,Thu Jul 9 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"My first brisket was somewhere around 14 hours, and I've heard of 18 hour marathons before. Brisket can be touchy to get exactly right, so it's better to give yourself some leeway in case it needs extra time or you have to try and save it if it gets a bit dry.  My best tip is to let it sit overnight in the smoker and finish it off in the oven the next day. I know it's not the most popular way to go, but if you haven't done a lot of brisket it gives you better control over the temp, makes it easier to check, etc. The smoke mostly stops absorbing after the first 3 or 4 hours anyway. But, I'm a poor bastard and I couldn't afford to possibly ruin my first $60 cut of meat. Came out perfect, got it sliced at the butcher shop. Even they said it was really well done."

I have to think the brisket has at least 10 degrees of carry-over cooking if wrapped and tossed in a cooler?"
smoking,3cocgo,JaRay,4,Thu Jul 9 16:06:57 2015 UTC,For 8.5lbs I would not be worried about starting it in the morning.  My typical routine is if I am planning to eat at lunch I start are 10 the night before.  If I am doing it for dinner then I will start it around 5.  My briskets usually cook between 250-275.  I have no trouble finishing 12+ lbs briskets at this schedule.  About 1 hour per lb of cook time always works for me.
smoking,3cocgo,walkerlucas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will keep that in mind if I run into any trouble tonight and decide against it. What temp do you pull at when cooking at 250-275? I was thinking of cooking at 225 overnight and pulling it at 190 due to carryover."
smoking,3cocgo,walkerlucas,2,Thu Jul 9 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"I pull around 203.  Sometimes I wrap sometimes I don't.  If the meat feels jiggly, I know it is done!  I only recently realized I was cooking that high.  I use a WSM and followed the temp on the stock thermometer.  I always felt like my briskets finished early, so I decided to stick a probe by the meat.  Sure enough it was about 25 degrees hotter.  No complaints though because it was came out wonderful, so I try to stick to those same temps."

smoking,3cocgo,potaetoSON,2,Thu Jul 9 14:50:28 2015 UTC,"A few things you can do to speed up a morning smoke: (1) wrap the brisket once it hits the stall (i.e., 150°F); (2) separate the point and flat muscles from each other.    I did both of these with a 15 lb whole brisket and finished it in 10.5 hours (cooking at 225°F).  I did mine over night though, and when it finished at 10:30am (temp around 203°F), I wrapped it in a blanket and stuck it in a cooler.  The temp was still around 145°F or 150°F by 430pm/5pm when we sliced it up.  Depending how you setup your fire (minion/snake/etc), you may want to throw chunks of wood on every 30-60 min for the first few hours, so if doing an overnight smoke without a minion/snake, I just set myself an alarm to wakeup and do this.  I agree with /u/LususV's suggestion of a wireless thermometer -- I love my Maverick."
smoking,3cnrvx,damagement,3,Thu Jul 9 09:55:39 2015 UTC,"That looks fantastic.  Now, I want to cook myself a roast.  A couple of additional tips that I've found to be helpful:   Salt the meat as far in advance as you can.  The night before is great.  Two nights before is better. When you do the final sear, leave the lid closed (not sure if you had it open all the time, or just to take a picture) If you go low and slow and let it rest before the final sear (e.g. while you're heating up the oven or gas grill to sear), you really don't have to let it rest before slicing."
smoking,3cnrvx,synackrst,2,Thu Jul 9 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"For the resting time I have my own method. During resting is when I set the table and get all drinks, sauces, sides etc ready. Everything nicely set up and ready and I can carve meat straight to everyone's plate:-)   I think huge difference in taste was that I had the thing overnight seasoned in the fridge like you suggested . Very nice garlic, salty flavor."
smoking,3cnrvx,TheDahktor,0,Thu Jul 9 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with the above, with the exception of closing the lid - this tends to continue to cook the side you're not searing and you'll be more likely to get a ring of meat that's ""more done"" than you intended."
smoking,3cnrvx,synackrst,2,Thu Jul 9 16:37:13 2015 UTC,I seared it with open lid only like 20 seconds a side. Max temp to the weber gas grill and got the nice crust quick.
smoking,3cnrvx,TheDahktor,0,Thu Jul 9 17:35:22 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the ability to sear all sides at once was why I suggested keeping the lid closed.  Less time searing overall, and fewer chances of flare-ups while on the gas grill.  But it sounds like OP kept it awfully brief as it was, so it's all good."
smoking,3cnrvx,synackrst,0,Thu Jul 9 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"Unless your ambient temperature is the same temp as the heat coming from your heat source, you're not going to sear but continue to roast."
smoking,3cnrvx,TheDahktor,0,Thu Jul 9 19:15:01 2015 UTC,"Right, but the point is crust formation.  The meat's already fully cooked, after all.  In a grill or oven preheated to 550 or so, you can put a very nice crust on your roast in a short period of time while increasing the internal temperature minimally."
smoking,3cnrvx,HawkHogan,2,Thu Jul 9 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"Started heating bullet at 8:30am and we ate at noon. The roast was small, about 2lbs so perfect for 2 adults and 3 kids.  Went with light smoke and loads of garlic on th roast. Chopped and rubbed  garlic black pepper and left it sit overnight. Mushrooms were with gorgonzola and bacon, turned out really nice. Leftover chopped bacon went over the carved ribeyes on the plate to maximize flavor.  First time smoking cow and will definitely do this again:-)"

smoking,3ckrux,Zerba,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"Aluminum is extremely reactive.  It is not present in nature outside of oxide and silicate ores.  (fun fact: many gemstones -- including sapphires -- are aluminum oxides).  What you have in your kitchen is probably anodized aluminum, which is aluminum coated with nonreactive aluminum oxide.  If you scratch that coating off, the aluminum can leach into your food and react to form various other aluminum compounds.  Most of these compounds are of relatively low toxicity; however, there is research that suggests aluminum plays a part in the development of Alzheimer's.  It's somewhat of a controversial topic because the research is so limited, but my wife and I avoid it anyway.  The only cookware we have now is cast iron or stainless steel."

Research has not shown aluminum to be a causative agent, but there is a growing body of evidence linking the two.  It's not difficult to see why the Alzheimer's Association would be pressured by the Aluminum Association to refute it as a causative agent.  The same text appears on the Aluminum Association's site.  Despite not yet being proven as a causative agent, modern studies still point towards a correlation.  In addition, the fact remains that aluminum is a known neurotoxin that has no known biological use.  I don't cook with it.  I cook with cast iron any chance I get -- it is superior cookware.  The iron that leaches into the food is biologically useful and properly seasoned cast iron cookware lasts damn near forever.  Since my wife is anemic, it's a no-brainer.

smoking,3ck5u3,Vuelhering,2,Wed Jul 8 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"You can brine for days without turning it into pastrami. Here's how I do it:   Salt the meat as you might, adding enough for the entire fowl as if you were going to grill it without adding extra salt. Set it aside for the moment. Fill your brine container and salt the water as if the brine were just clear unsalted broth. Don't add any extra for the meat. Taste the brine until you just get the amoune of salt you want coming through. Add the rest of the spices to the brine. These should be strong. Usually, I use about the same amount of sugar, and lots of spice. Then add the meat, and it can sit for days without becoming oversalted."

smoking,3ck5u3,dzernumbrd,2,Wed Jul 8 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yep I've done it.  I used a five spice, salt and pepper rub (it wasn't really a rub, i just sprinkled some of each all over it - go easy on the five spice, a normal dusting will do, no need to cake it).  I tried to get the skin crispy by running the smoker at max heat which meant taking the water bath out so the meat was over the coals (I have a smokey mountain style smoker) and the amount of duck fat dripping on the coals was insane.  It smelt great and tasted good at the end result but the skin still wasn't crisp.  I'd say next time I would smoke it to get the smoke flavour into it and then jam it in the oven for the skin.  I poked holes all over the skin with satay sticks but otherwise treated it like a chicken (12 hour dry brine and 12 hour fridge air drying).  Disclaimer: I am no expert, I've only tried it once."
smoking,3ck5u3,nosexpantherbyodeon,2,Wed Jul 8 19:37:32 2015 UTC,I make a duck breast bacon that I put in a salad.  I cure them in salt and thyme (personal preference).  About a cup of salt per breast.  Cure them for 24 hours in the salt mixture and them wash them thoroughly and let them air dry at room temperature for about four hours.  In order not to render the fat you have to low smoke them around 150-200 degrees for about 45 minutes.  I use a mild fruit wood and only give them one handful of chips so they don't over smoke.  Since duck is so fatty it quickly absorbs the smoke and it is easy to have it overpower the taste of the duck.  When they are done rest them well (a day or so) slice thick and fry up into lardons.  Great addition to soups and salads.

smoking,3ckzaj,damagement,8,Wed Jul 8 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would shoot for 115-120* then quickly sear it under direct heat"
smoking,3ckzaj,na3800,5,Wed Jul 8 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"This advice is golden.  For prime rib, the best approach I've found is slow cooking with gentle heat, followed by brief high heat to sear and create a nice crust.  I've done a prime rib roast in the oven for the holidays several times and it never fails to delight.  Basically, I do what's described here: http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/12/food-lab-guide-to-prime-rib.html  If you're going to use the smoker, you have essentially the same procedure, except that you're using it to provide the low and slow temps (and tasty, tasty smoke) rather than an oven.  To sear, I'd probably just use an oven cranked to its highest temp.  You could alternatively just crank up the fire in your smoker to blazing hot.  That has some appeal - with the right gear, you could get a much higher hotter sear than your oven - but you could also burn the heck out of the roast.  Also, your pit's going to take forever to cool down afterwards, which might or might not be a problem for you."
smoking,3ckzaj,synackrst,2,Wed Jul 8 22:20:28 2015 UTC,Thank you! Meat is now in the weber bullet. My plan is to crank the gas grill to xhot and sear the thing in there.  Let's see how this goes. Planning for a light smoke and closer to medium temp as there is small kids eating also who won't like their meat too red.
smoking,3ckzaj,na3800,2,Thu Jul 9 06:00:10 2015 UTC,Searing would be more or less for visual purposes or does it serve other purpose? 120 would mean medium-rare or thereabouts?
smoking,3ckzaj,I_AM_A_DRUNK_DONKEY,2,Wed Jul 8 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"The sear is visual, but also adds a little crust to the exterior and makes a more dynamic flavor. Frankly, the roast is not going to look very appetizing without a sear.  115-120* would finish Rare. An internal temp of 125* followed by a fast sear should set you around medium-rare"
smoking,3ckzaj,rajincajingt,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. I'll be searing it then. Cheers:-)
smoking,3ckzaj,TheDahktor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:37:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/na3800 that the sear does make it look better but I'd say it the other way around and the sear is for flavor first and eye-appeal second.    Regardless of the reason, yes you must sear! :)"

smoking,3ck5su,MaxThroughput,4,Wed Jul 8 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly how a GFI works. You could try tracing the wiring from the plug to the board and see if there are any frayed wires. I would try a non-GFI outlet, one connecting to a breaker matching the input amperage of the smoker, if the breaker throws, then you know there's a fault with the wiring.   A GFI measures input current and makes sure it matches output  current, if it doesn't, it shuts off to prevent electrocution. Since you're dissipating a large amount of current into heat, it would make sense that your input current would be greater than output current. This is just electrical theory, I have not used an electric smoker on a GFI, but theory tells me it's a bad idea."

Regarding poultry, I think it's best to smoke at a higher temperature, 350-375F.  If you smoke poultry at less than 300F, the skin comes out rubbery.  And with poultry there's no need to convert collagen to gelatin, so you don't actually need to go low & slow.  With chicken, you're better off spatchcocking the bird.

smoking,3cl8bf,FierceApollo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"First you have to cure them, if you are buying fresh ones that is.  This will take several days.  Then you rinse and rest them overnight and smoke the following day.  If you can buy ones that are labeled ""smoked"", it's best to do a second smoke on them as this will really wake-up the flavor.  Smoking is straightforward, they take several hours and I pull them when the internal is around 170°.  With either method, there is a finishing step.  Some folks will braise them to improve tenderness or if you have a pressure cooker it takes a very short amount of time to get them super tender.  You can also opt to put a smoked leg into a pot of beans and cook it until it's pullable, and use the meat just like ham.   I wish I could rember the weight on this one, but it was a giant leg, about 12"" long."
smoking,3cl8bf,3rdIQ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"These are fresh legs, I was thinking a 4-6 hour braise with    1 gallon water 1 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons chili powder 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon ground pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin   And maybe a Rub for good measure."
smoking,3cl8bf,3rdIQ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:56:03 2015 UTC,"Here is the cure I use and I cure 3 days.  The addition of Tender Quick is what will give them the pink color and ham-like texture.  Fresh Drumsticks  1 gallon water  2/3 to 3/4 cup of Morton's kosher salt  2 tablespoons Morton's TenderQuick  1/2 of an onion, sliced  several cloves of garlic, sliced  handfull of brown sugar  cracked pepper or pepper blend  peppercorns  Heat the water and and dissolve the salt, sugar and Tenderquick. Add onion, garlic and pepper. Allow to cool. You can hold back on some water and add ice to speed up cooling. Submerge and brine drumsticks in a non-reactive container for at least 12 hours and up to two or three days, refrigerated. The longer the time, the more pronounced the flavor and texture change from the curing agent. The longer cure will also result in a saltier finished product. Following brining, rinse and soak in cold water for 1 to 3 hours. Dry off and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, overnight is better.   Smoke at 225° to 250°. I do them until they are at least 175° to 180° internal. Plan on 3 to 3-1/2 hours in the smoker. Because of the brine with Tenderquick, the longer times using lower temperatures are quite safe. Check the internal temperature after 90 mminutes and adjust your pit temperature if needed."
smoking,3cl8bf,MiltownKBs,0,Thu Jul 9 21:38:11 2015 UTC,Indirect low heat on a charcoal grill with smoking wood like hickory or cherry.  Use a baste as well.  Whisky mixed with seasoning or apple juice work well with turkey.  Baste often and replenish the wood as needed.  Keep heat very low.  Finish with barbeque sauce or your favorite seasoning.

smoking,3ci458,muhaski,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:35:52 2015 UTC,"Good old Victorinox with the fibrox handle, used by most professional, is more than sufficient for handling meat.  For veggies and general cutting a Chef's knive is the norm. If you have big hands (and a large cutting board) you can use a 10 incher. For normal and smaller hands a 8"" will do perfectly.  For fat removal , boning and general ""sculpting"" a boning knive is what you need. A 6"" is sufficient. A straight stiff blade will do everything, and if your budget allows for a another one, a curved semi-flexible blade will make fat removal easier.    And the most important thing: a sharpening system. There's a shitload of them on the market. Find one  you like, master it, and use it often."
smoking,3ci458,jimtk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"I'll second all the victorinox recs: good knives, relatively inexpensive, light (huge factor), and easily replaceable when you get to that point or keepable if not.   I made the admittedly bonehead mistake and going out to get ""reality good knives"" for by first kitchen job. Now I've replaced those knife's for being too heavy and not as well made or comfortable to use as the Japanese carbon steel knives I have now.  I'd recommend a 10"" chef (if you can train yourself to use a knife this size, you'll never go back to an 8""), shortest pairing they have, bread knife (ribs, brisket, sometimes pork shoulder... But not in the south). That's really it. After a couple cooks (at least six?) You might get a boning knife if you find you are buying lots of cuts at the butcher and are trimming and boning etc, but don't need generally. That's it.

I needed knives that will keep sharp for a relatively long period as I use them for cutting meats and various things at work, and also had to be comfortable.

This unique formulation ensures low levels of foam not generally seen with other semi-synthetic products especially in soft water areas. This clean running formulation also prevents the loading of grinding wheels, ensuring good surface finishes and minimal burning.   A very versatile product that works well in a wide range of operations such as grinding, milling, turning,drilling, and tapping. Extremely good product for cast iron and steel machining and grinding. Extremely fine emulsion reduces carry-off for low total operating cost. Fast wetting to get the fluid to the point of cut and fully coat the work piece and chips for superior corrosion prevention. Extremely hard water tolerant. Easily recycled or disposed of without special handling or equipment. Contains no DEA, chlorine, nitrites or phenolic compounds."

smoking,3cf7l8,Smaulz,4,Tue Jul 7 13:57:46 2015 UTC,"I've had my 640 comp model (just like the pic) since December 2014. Love it. Consistent heat. Added some extras; one probe port for use with 4 probes, grill grates for grilling. You can't believe how good smoking rib eyes to 125 IT and the searing them on grill grates to 135 until you try it. Better then restaurant offerings. Cold smoke with just the blower and an Amaz-N pellet tube. Cheeses and butters smoke so well with this. The grill grates even flip over for a flat surface to grill veggies or to cook that frozen pizza (don't knock it till you try it). They're pricey, but customer service is nothing less then outstanding  (response emails <15 minutes reported by many users). Built like a tank (pictured model weighs in at ~350) in US of A. Great fan based Facebook page also for tips, recipes, and help (Yoder monitors closely)."

This year i'm experimenting with charcoal.  Temp control is much better, i just need to figure out the right amount of charcoal, and how to distribute it for a nice long low smoke.  Its a piece of trash and i cant wait to upgrade, but i dont regret the experience ive gained from it.  I put two disposable pans in the bottom racks to catch all the drippings.  When things get too hot i put some water in them."
smoking,3cibwk,RedShiz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:16:56 2015 UTC,"I use a bigger foil pan in the stock water rack ( I smash it in there) and it holds lots of water.  That's why i was thinking adding ice might cool it down for long enough.  I was reading about other mods, and it they include getting rid of the chip pan entirely, which is interesting.  I am new to this, so I don't find it a piece of trash yet.  I like the dual doors, and vertical space, I just need to find a better way to control temp, and it seems like turning down the gas would help.    Do you put your charcoal in the tray, or how do you do it?  Do you just add coals when needed?"

I've tried charcoal in the water pan, charcoal on the main holder thingy, and charcoal in a basket on the main holder thingy.  There are many other variables to play around...  And I'm a newb so it's gonna take time.  I've only wasted one flat brisket so far.  Another tip: use a BBQ brush to scrape to inside top before smoking.  You'll get a lot of buildup on that surface which will drip with moisture, or otherwise flake off onto your food.  Reasons why I think it's trash: * have to baby sit it to maintain temps * impossible to cold smoke * low quality burner  But I'm stuck with it until I can afford a Yoder."

smoking,3cipn0,Baconrules21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:37:45 2015 UTC,"The ordering is fine, the issue is you could be being a bit optimistic about cook times, refueling and load/unload of meat. 10pm-8am is 10 hours. You need to cook an average size bone in pork shoulder (7-8 pounds) at almost 260-275 to cook that fast and that if you had perfect temp control and foil wrapped it at 160F. A 4.5 pound brisket needs 6-7 hours if you want it to be over 203F and also needs to be wrapped with butcher paper or foil. Ribs is a completely different story. Bare min 6 hours if they are spare ribs or you are not gonna like the results.   For an 8 pound shoulder a 5 pound brisket and normal size ribs I would allow  12 hours for shoulder  +1 load/unload/refuel  6 hours for brisket  +1hour load/unload/refuel  6 hours for ribs  +1 hour unload/rest  = 27 hours  You want to cook all that in a medium egg one by one and eat at 6pm? You need to start cooking at 3pm the day before and sleep in small 3-4 hour batches.  Or replace the ribs with baby backs and do em 230F on the grill for 5 hours with a 45 min wrap in between and a last 30 minute watered down bbq sauce glaze, while the brisket is smoking."

People have been trying to cut corners and make it easy for years. What you end up with is bad bbq. That might be okay if there are no other options.

However if you don't have that then you can try and keep it in a styrofoam cooler but make sure the meat isn't too hot when you put it in or else you will cook it more and ruin all those hard hours you spent smoking it.

Match up the wide end to wide end, smaller end to smaller end bone to bone.  Tie it up like a roast with a few wraps of twine.  You're going to have to move them often since one rack is closer to the coals and you're going to have to flip them since you have 4 racks total."

smoking,3cei7l,tommymart,4,Tue Jul 7 07:49:14 2015 UTC,I just finished a catering job in Croatia where we had a Rational oven and these things are super awesome ovens (next lottery win I am buying one for my home). I really wanted to do some smoking for the crew and after a bit of googaling I found they did an attachment so I am currently convincing the owners to by one haha. looking forward to seeing how well it produces smoked goods. The oven has a steam and roast function and you can adjust the ratios of one to the other which could mean some nice moist meat!

smoking,3cfzx7,fallenelf,3,Tue Jul 7 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"Typically if it includes an acid it's considered a marinade. On a large chunk of whole muscle a marinade won't penetrate far in a day or so, but the outer layer will be very seasoned.  Marinades, contrary to popular belief, do little for tenderizing meat. They do, however, bring a huge amount of flavour to the table.  Brines are typically used to force more moisture into a cut of meat. This is done by increasing th concentration of a dissolved solid in a liquid surrounding the meat. This causes the meat to absorb the liquid and dissolved solids in an attempt to reach an equilibrium. If the dissolved solids are salt, sugar and seasonings we end up with a piece of meat that's seasoned from the inside. Beijing also increases the moisture content of the meat. When being used for barbecue or low and slow smoking, brining is almost solely for flavour, as any absorb d moisture will likely be lost during the long cooking process."
smoking,3cfzx7,brilliantjoe,3,Tue Jul 7 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"This is interesting, thanks for the read!    So, as of right now I have around 4 days before I'm planning on smoking the shoulder (8lbs).  Would it be worth it (or detrimental) to essentially brine for 2.5-3 days, then add a rub the day before?"
smoking,3cfzx7,TheDahktor,2,Tue Jul 7 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"To add to /u/brilliantjoe, marinades don't penetrate very far into meat - they simply can't.  Salt can penetrate much much deeper and if your marinade is very salty and you marinade for too long you'll end up with a salt-lick.  I brine my shoulders for 48 hours - I don't foresee a problem with 3/4 days if you have to - I've done three due to having to reschedule a smoke for various reasons, no harm done.  I brine all my meat, I'll never go back especially with chicken.  After I started brining chicken it was like a whole new world."
smoking,3cfzx7,brilliantjoe,3,Tue Jul 7 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"awesome!  I dry brined the last shoulder I smoked for a day and a half and it came out fantastic, but a little salty.  I wanted to try a traditional brine, but thought that apple cider vinegar might add a nice fruity taste to the pork.  Right now I'm just experimenting, but wanted to know if there was anything detrimental to brining for moer than a day or so, and if anyone had tried cider vinegar with pork."

smoking,3cc5wb,the_doughboy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:02:31 2015 UTC,"This recipe is richer than a classic porchetta because it lacks the pork loin (which traditionally gets wrapped in the belly). The loin is usually dry, but adds texture and balances the belly's richness.   Reheat: I love making sandwiches -slice 1/4"", heat slowly in low heat dry pan, toast some buns, add some pickled onions and spicy mayo. Add some fried eggs for a breakfast sandwich.   Better next day: Chemical reactions and coagulation. Basically the same reason why bolognese and ragu sauces taste so much better the next day.  Refrigeration allows for all of the various flavors in the dish to migrate into the cooling protein and starches. When slow cooked meat cools down, the gelatinous material from the collagen and tendons etc. that has melted during cooking begins to gel in and around the chunks of meat. As this happens, the various flavor compounds get trapped in the gel.

smoking,3cc5wb,Ehran,2,Mon Jul 6 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"12lb Berkshire belly - scored almost to the skin (see below for dry brine), and refrigerated for 48hrs. I also included my method for cooking and finishing.  BRINE: Toasted then ground 2-tbsp of whole black peppercorn and 3-tbsp whole fennel seed. Added 12-cloves of garlic (grated), 1-tbsp crushed red pepper, 3-tbsp of finely chopped rosemary, 2-tbsp sage, and finally a very liberal sprinkling of kosher salt. Work rub and seasoning into the scored meat. Roll, tie, and rub exterior with mixture of 2-tbsp kosher salt and 1-tsp of baking powder.  COOK: Low and slow at a consistent temp is the goal - which is why this is best done sous-vide (although still great in oven or smoker). I got the smoker going several hours before and used a pan of water for additional stability.  FINISH: Crackle is the goal. You can bake in oven at 500 for 20min. But I wanted to cook everything outside, so I ""deep fried"" using duck fat (oil is fine) using a large wok. Heat oil/lard to about 400. Carefully slide pork into oil using spatulas and tongs. (It will not be fully submerged). Immediately cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally until sputtering dies a bit, about 2 minutes. Using a large metal ladle, spoon hot oil over the exposed portions of the roast continuously until the bottom half is cooked and crisp, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook on second side, basting the whole time. Remove from pan, blot with paper towel and let rest for 5-10 min."

smoking,3cb0nu,StraightoutaBrompton,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:45:50 2015 UTC,Over salting is usually not an issue. I find most people under season their meat. When you have such a thick cut like that the surface you are salting is relatively small compared to the mass of the meat. Im sorry I'm just having a hard time with the too much salt thing. Did you use really coarse salt so you were biting into really big pieces?
smoking,3cb0nu,AGirlNamedRoni,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, it wasn't too salty as in inedible, but it was more than I was used to. I used a cracked sea salt and the chunks may have been a factor, but I think I just eyeballed it too much. I usually use a basic S&P ratio for brisket and such, but this I went 1/4 salt, 1/4 pepper, and then 1/8 garlic salt, onion, and paprika. It was a bit of guesstimating and I think I just over did it is all, or the other seasonings may have had something. Like I said, not too salty as in inedible, just a lot saltier than my other attempts have come out. I'll just measure it next time and go with the S&P rub I use for brisket haha"

smoking,3cb0nu,digital0129,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:36:13 2015 UTC,I stay away from that cracked sea salt and use Kosher salt. The graulate are thick enough to stick but not thick enough to leave a huge clumb of salt on for an unsavry bite. Swithcing to just Kosher salt is prob the best advice I can offer for seasoning bbq
smoking,3cb0nu,digital0129,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:39:35 2015 UTC,Generally you want to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt per pound of meat. It's best to salt first and put it in the fridge wrapped up for 1 - 2 hours before smoking. This allows the salt to penetrate the meat instead of pulling liquid to the surface during the smoking process (if you salted and immediately smoked). Just before smoking you add the rub to your meat without salt.
smoking,3cb0nu,jalbee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"OP added 4 Tbs salt to those ribs (assuming 1/4 meant cup). That's way too much salt. 1/2 tsp per pound of meat is ideal. That way it's seasoned well, and people can add more salt later if that's how they like it."

I liked this:    Fried Chicken: Cut into joints two tender young chickens, wipe the pieces dry, season with salt and pepper, red and black, then set on ice. Fry a pound of streaky bacon in a deep skillet, take out when crisp, roll chicken in flour, dip in beaten egg, then roll again, and lay in the fat, which must be bubbling hot, but not scorching. Cook, turning often, to a rich brown, take out, then pile in a pan, set the pan over another with boiling water in the bottom, and put all in a very hot oven for fifteen minutes. This cooks the chicken through and through without making it hard. The pieces must not touch in frying so there will be two skilletfuls. When all the chicken is fried, and in the oven, dredge in more flour, stir it well through the fat, then add a cup of cream, stirring hard all the time, and letting it barely simmer—boiling curdles it. Or if you want a full-cream gravy, pour off the fat, stir the cream in double quantity in the skillet to take up the flavors, then pour it in a double boiler, add pepper, salt, minced celery, a little onion juice, and one at a time, lumps of butter, rolled well in flour. Cook until thick and rich, and serve in a gravy boat."

That's the best part about this hobby/obsession.  You constantly want to do better.  I've never done hot dogs on the smoker, how did they come out?  I've got grand kids, and when they want hot dogs, I end up firing up the grill.  It's not a problem as I've already got a fire going in the smoker, I just take some coals to start the charcoal in the grill.  But maybe they'll taste better in the smoker?

smoking,3cax51,savyur,2,Tue Jul 7 13:07:18 2015 UTC,Instead of mustard just use oil. Canola is fine. The oil will help transfer some of the oil soluble compounds in the rub to the meat. It will also help to bind the rub to the meat. Mustard is mostly water. Didn't you want to dry the meat next time?  There is no sin in using an oven to finish off your meat. Or adding some more unlit charcoal to the snake. I don't fuss with the 2x2 or 3x3 I just pile it into the Weber and make sure I leave a bit of air to circulate.  Water pan? I use a big one underneath to act as a temperature stabilizer. I use a small one above the coals as a humidifier.

smoking,3c8vno,wsender,3,Mon Jul 6 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting the smoker man, hope you like it and keep it up.  Yes, you should season it before you ever cook on it. That'll burn out any chemicals or metal shavings that might be in there and get it ready for food. Use the seasoning process as time to get to learn your smoker and how to control the temps. Make notes of what the temp does when you open/close the firebox or the damper on the stack.  It's hard to say how much charcoal you need cause I don't know what type of smoker it is, but the seasoning process should help you figure this out. Maybe start with a smaller amount and then add more as necessary. You want to aim for lower temps, somewhere between 200 and 300 to start. Like I said earlier, learn how to control the temps on your smoker while you season it.  If you don't have a digital thermometer, you should think about getting one. It'll make it a lot easier to get an accurate temp.  If you can't cook with wood in your offset, I'd recommend using wood chunks with your charcoal. Don't soak them in water, just throw them on the charcoal and let them smoke when you first put your meat on. Meat will only take smoke up to certain temps, so you want the smoke in the beginning.  Start off with a pork butt for your first smoke. It's pretty forgiving if your temps fluctuate a lot.  Learn your smoker and keep practicing. Good luck!"
smoking,3c8vno,MrWalkattyMan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:51:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I can't wait to starts smoking.
smoking,3c8vno,Really_Elvis,2,Thu Jul 9 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"You don't need an entire bag of charcoal unless the thing is huge.  I like oak and pecan mix. Chunks last longer and helps save charcoal.   Temperature is something you have to learn with your machine. You regulate the heat by adjusting the air vents. And the size of the fire.  Smoke is smoke. It will be heavy white as the wood starts burning, then thin out.   Adjust the vent and watch what it does to the temperature.   I like ribs or brisket. Cook at 225-250 degrees. Not too hot. I make a pan from foil and put water in it, inside the smoker to keep the food moist.  Ribs take 2 1/2 hours or so. You can wrap them in foil near the end to keep them moist. Keep an eye on them. When you can tug a bone and they separate, you got it. For brisket, I like the ""lean"" or ""point"" the best. About one hour per pound, plus an hour will get you close. I don't buy more than a 7-8 pounder, just because of cooking time.  I'm known for being a good cook with great bbq. Let me know if I can help with anymore questions. Bbq is my favorite hobby !!!  Good luck and Great bbq'ing......"
smoking,3c8vno,unclexbenny,2,Mon Jul 6 01:03:37 2015 UTC,"Might depend on your cooker, but a whole bag sounds like way too much. I'd start with maybe 1/4 or even less and go from there. Can always add more. Put the wood in right at the start and just let it go with the charcoal, that way once your charcoal is up to temp, your wood should be burning nice and clean, or at least that's how it works out on my smoker. I generally have apple, cherry, pecan, hickory, and mesquite chunks on hand. Definitely depends on what I'm cooking, pork I like apply or cherry mixed with hickory. Beef can take more hickory or even mix in some mesquite. Chicken? Fruit wood only. I haven't noticed a huge difference between brands at the big box stores, just make sure the bag you're picking up has decent sized chunks in it, little chips burn up too fast for my liking. Can't really comment on an offset, but for the WSM heat management is generally just open the bottom vents to raise temp, close to lower. If the fire really gets too hot, might have to close the top vent a little temporarily but 99% that is just wide open for airflow. Thin blue smoke, correct. You'll know it when you see it. Number one mistake I made when I first picked up a smoker was thinking it had to have smoke pouring out top the entire time and adding wood when the smoke disappeared. Just ends up with bitter tasting meat. Like I mentioned a couple questions up, on my WSM the top vent is fully open 99% of the time. Not sure about an offset but I imagine it would be the same. Ribs wouldn't be the worst thing, but like a previous commenter said pork shoulder is much more forgiving. Go pick up a 8-9 pounder from the store, cut it in half, and smoke that. First of all they're pretty fatty so they'll help break in your smoker, plus they can handle the temperature fluctuations you'll likely experience without ruining the meat. They're also pretty cheap if something were to go horribly wrong. Be patient with your meat. Give yourself a couple extra hours if you're cooking something like pork shoulder or brisket for guests, it can always rest longer. And when people say you have to take things like that to 190+ internal temp for them to get tender, they mean it. Don't think you overcooked something because you pulled it off at 192 and it was juicy but still tough, go for 195 next time or even longer. It's called low and slow for a reason. Also if something goes wrong a couple hours into a cook, there's no shame in using the oven as a back up. The meat will already have a smokey flavor by that point anyway, and 225 in the oven isn't that much different than 225 in a smoker."

smoking,3c8js6,JohnSquiggleton,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:18:41 2015 UTC,"I suspect you're having trouble with fire control.  What are you doing now to control the fire/temperature ?    any adjustments to the vents take time to have any effect. If you change the vent on the firebox, WAIT to see what it does. For your first few smokes, don't touch the chimney vent! It's hard enough to keep track of what one does.   What are you using to gauge the temperature ? the ones mounted in the door are notoriously bad.  The reviews on that amazon page seem to mention some mods folks have done to help, have you done any of them ? regardless, I don't think you need them, at least at first; you may want some later.  Try this:    open the chimney vent 75% open the firebox vents 100% light one full chimney of charcoal briquettes when the coal is grey and ashed over, dump it in your firebox. using only the firebox vents, hold as close to 225° as you can (anywhere 215-250° counts) once you've held that smoking temperature for 15 minutes, put a pot with 3-4 quarts of water in the smoke chamber, and bring the temp back up (wrap the pot in foil first, to make cleanup easier). now see how long you can hold 225° without adding any coal, or touching the chimney vent.   Your smoker will vary, you may need to choke down the chimney vent more than this, it may take a couple of tries, you might use actual meat and wood to make smoke...  BTW, Amazing ribs has a brief article about your smoker, and the techniques page (http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/index.html) probably has help for you in both the offset and vertical smoker parts.  You'll probably find some useful stuff on the rest of that site too."
smoking,3c981m,hstexan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:03:03 2015 UTC,Check each probe in boiling water to make sure they are reading correctly.
smoking,3c981m,StargateCommand,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:57:53 2015 UTC,"I will do that to double check, but I also forgot to mention I used one probe one yesterday and the other today.  I'm fairly certain they're reading properly because the chicken was cooked by temp and it turned out as expected as well as the fact if I put it in the daisy wheel it ends up reading close to the lid temp.  Could the plate setter and/or water pan be affecting it this much?  What about being too close to the meat?  I guess after I determine they are reading properly in boiling water I could always do a dry run and try to dial in the probes on it without anything cooking"
smoking,3c981m,TheDahktor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:04:11 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Don't know nuttin 'bout BGE's  If your ambient temp probe is too close to your meat, yes, it can cause a difference in temperature.  The air around the meat will be cooler than the rest of the smoker, yet another reason to make sure when doing multiple chunks of meat, you've got at least a couple inches of space between.  Generally the area closest to your water pan will be a little cooler as well, however in a WSM for example, the air coming up around the water bowl will be hotter.  May want to map out your hot/cool spots in your smoker with the dry run you mentioned."
smoking,3c981m,Nega_Duck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:27:46 2015 UTC,Does the dome temp gauge really matter if you have the maverick?
smoking,3c981m,Nega_Duck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:21:36 2015 UTC,"Apparently so because the dome temp was rising by 50 degrees and the Maverick would drop by 2.  I don't see anyway that my dome temp reads 400 and my Maverick is barely showing 290.  110 degree difference because of 6-8 inches?  The only reasonable explanation is that something is interfering with the prob getting an accurate reading and I can't figure out if it's the water pan, plate setter, meat being too close, some of the above combined or something I haven't even thought of.  If my Maverick was getting accurate readings that means I cooked my 5.5lb bird in one hour at an average of 295 degrees.  That also means yesterday's smoke at 225-250 (dome temp) was actually done at 170-180 (Maverick reading) and one of my racks of spare ribs was overcooked by 4.5 hours.  The numbers just aren't adding up...at this point I'm inclined to believe the dome temp is exponentially more accurate than the grate reading I'm getting from the Maverick right now."

Ribs 24 hours.  Everything comes out much juicier, even as leftovers reheated in a microwave.  Perhaps you had an unfortunate cut that didn't come out well.  I use 3/4 teaspoon of salt per pound of meat.. The link someone posted below suggests 1/2 teaspoon but I find that's not enough.  Can you give more information?"
smoking,3c6bqt,TheDahktor,4,Sun Jul 5 13:08:00 2015 UTC,Same here. Dry brining is the way I go.

smoking,3c6bqt,TheDahktor,2,Sun Jul 5 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend you give it another try - the results you're reporting just aren't the results you should get with a dry brine.  Measure it out next time, start with the 1/2 tsp per pound of meat (exclude bone and trimmings).  If you don't want to ""risk"" the experiment on a long and slow/big piece of meat like a shoulder - try a couple of chicken breasts.  Your comment actually makes me want to do a comparison for folks here - there's a lot of anti-brine people and I just don't understand where their logic is coming from.. With that said, without offering up proof, why should they believe me? ;)  I may do a comparison with chicken breasts and post the method, results and pictures for others to review."

A simple rub of kosher salt, black pepper, granulated garlic, ancho chile powder and cayenne, applied the night before Smoked them for roughly four hours, until the internal temp was about 196 Smoker temperature was a little low at first at 200-220, but I kept it in the 240-250 range for the bulk of the smoke They came out nicely smoky juicy.

smoking,3c43qi,psuskifan,2,Sat Jul 4 17:13:56 2015 UTC,What were your temperature ranges and how many hours did it take total.  When you cook over night is it the kind of thing where you get the fire good then check it every two-three hours?
smoking,3c43qi,psuskifan,2,Wed Jul 8 01:32:41 2015 UTC,I have one of those wireless maverick thermometers where you can set an alarm if it goes above or below a certain temperature. I set it for 200 to 250 and it only went outside of that once while I was sleeping. When i was awake I tried to keep it at 225. It took about 17 hours total.

smoking,3c3x72,Higgilicious,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"It defiantly extends your charcoal for the sheer fact of being more efficient with it. The IQ 120 only has the ability to make your charcoal hotter, when you need to lower the temp it just turns off and chokes the fire for awhile till the ideal temp is desired. With that being said, it gently brings your WSM to your set smoke temp in an effort to not over shoot it. Being more efficient equals extended charcoal life. I would recommend it"

The trimmings will keep indefinitely if kept dry and when you want to use some for smoking, just soak a handful or two in water for half an hour or so before throwing them in the smoker. (I smoked with lump charcoal, so I would just throw the sage right on the coals.) Sage worked the best with pork and chicken but I used it for lots of meats. I don't think that a human has ever made a better meal than the apple wood and sage smoked pork roast I used to cook. Obviously if your don't have access to a sage bush this is irrelevant."

After a bunch of frustrating smoke sessions,  I eventually decided to cook based on my smoker instead of trying to make my smoker do something it clearly wasn't interested in doing.   I researched hot and fast recipes and method for ribs, brisket, etc, and all has been good.   The suggestion to reduce airflow is a good one too. I got the steel door from Cajun bandit and the pressure knob. Also added the gasket kit. That helped somewhat, but this thing just wants to go high.   Then I got the BBQ Guru, now I struggle to keep it above 275. It's much more comfortable at 225 now. YMMV. Good luck!"

smoking,3c41gu,stealth1236,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've done a pretty good job eliminating a-lot of the variables that could be effecting your temp.   There are three things I can imaging being the source of your problems. First - How tight are the vents at the bottom? When you turn them do they spin freely or do they require a degree of pressure to turn? There is a sweet spot where it should turn with a small degree of pressure but not be so tight that you're cutting grooves into the porcelain enamel when you adjust airflow. I can imagine if your vents aren't secured tightly enough they could be allowing air in.  When the food is done and the smoker is cool take it apart into it's constituent pieces by which I mean the lid center and base. Carefully inspect where the pieces join looking for any dents or deformations that would let in air, while putting back together check to see if they line up properly perhaps your smoker suffered some damage at some point and you have an oblong part where a perfectly circular part should be. If your smoker has had these temp control issues from day one it may have suffered some shipping damage or have been a return that someone damaged.  The last thing is how tight is the fuel door? I've seen WSMs on display in Walmart that had some ill fitting doors and have heard of other people with that issue. I believe there is a gasket kit somewhere on line you can buy to help seal it.  In any-case for your heat to be that high given all that you have been doing there has to be an air flow problem, meaning too much is getting in. Hopefully this helps, good luck!"

The only reason I finish in my pit is to not have my oven on heating up my house in July. However, if you want to throw it in the oven, you won't be losing any smoke flavor."
smoking,3c40u5,Ringo934,2,Sat Jul 4 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"So for all intents and purposes the oven will do just fine, but from what I can tell I just won't get the same bark like I would if I rocked it for 10+ hours or so, right?"

smoking,3c40u5,fireboxer34,5,Sat Jul 4 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"it's the same. If your hunk of meat is in the oven at 250, or the smoker at 225, if it's uncovered the water evaporating out with cause the 'stall' in either chamber. If you want to skip the slowdown, wrap up your meat. If you prefer not to soften the bark, leave it unwrapped."

smoking,3c40u5,Digitalzombie90,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:24:15 2015 UTC,I usually do this when I am doing long smokes 4-6 hours in the smoker then finish in the oven
smoking,3c40u5,Mindflux,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:44:42 2015 UTC,Big difference. I once put a turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving and used my stoker to monitor it while I was at my parents house. It was great to get updates on the progress without having to watch over it. BUT! What I found out is that the oven has a 40 temperature swing during the course of turning the heating element on and off while cooking the turkey. Bet your smoker doesn't have these swings.

smoking,3c1g2j,HomerJay420,2,Fri Jul 3 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"So you want to cook more based on temp of the meat than time. Pork shoulder is quite forgiving so you can do 225 slow smoked on indirect heat and if you're not getting up in temp as quick as you expected you can crutch (wrap in aluminum and place back on the grill) to accelerate the cooking time.  Around 155-160 degrees you begin to notice the meet temp stalls because this is when it begins to expel or sweat its moisture out a bit which, just like as you run outside, as the sweat forms it cools the skin. If it's cooking too fast then no aluminum wrap will allow the stall to just work through itself and you can better gauge the time it will be done from there.  Ideal internal temp is 195 minimum but 203 as a maximum.   Grill Temp with indirect heat should try to hover 225 but again as its a forgiving cut of meat you can bump that temp up to cook it faster as well.   If the shoulder finishes too early for your preference wrap the finished product in aluminum foil and a beach towel you don't mind washing and place it in a cooler as it will then hold the temperature for another 1.5-2.5 hours until you are ready to shred and serve :)  Have fun with it man... It's pretty hard to mess up a shoulder unless you pull it too soon from the grill or do way too hot of a Temp!"
smoking,3c1g2j,bxna,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"Oh that's awesome, I've saved this so I can reference it in the morning.    Thanks!"
smoking,3c1g2j,bxna,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:37:40 2015 UTC,Oh and when crutching you have the option to include a bit of apple juice and/or a bit of Apple cider vinegar as well. Kind of creates a steam effect and the components of the juice will help to melt the fat.  If there is still a layer of fat on top of your shoulder I suggest trimming it to be nearly gone (not entirely gone just not a layer especially a thick one) because the smoke won't permeate the fat and too thick of a cap won't melt as you are smoking. Around 170 degrees the fat liquifies a bit and it begins to turn gelatinous which is where the ability to pull it apart starts to shine.  I too am doing pork shoulder tomorrow. Unfortunately I'm cooking for 2 and the smallest my local butcher had was 9.5 pounds so yeah lots and lots and lots of leftover pork lol

smoking,3c1g2j,downwithship,3,Sat Jul 4 01:44:54 2015 UTC,Just thought of something else for you. Because your shoulder is kind of filleted in a way you may want to consider kite string or butcher twine to hold it together. You don't want both shoulders to start falling apart on you as they get tender

smoking,3c1d3j,lingodayz,3,Fri Jul 3 21:30:18 2015 UTC,Sounds like maybe there's a bit of a plug on the bottom or if u soaked your wood maybe the water is keeping it cold
smoking,3c1d3j,bxna,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"What creates the heat, wood or charcoal? When the ribs finally finished they had a lighter than usual smoke flavour.  Should I have had more wood in it?"
smoking,3c1d3j,bxna,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:39:17 2015 UTC,"So your charcoal (I assume you were using either a Kamado or side by side type smoker) is likely limo charcoal Which is normally an oak base. Already wood in a varied form. These get hot and create the temperature you're seeking.   The flavor chunks or chips of wood often time are soaked in an effort to slow the burning of the wood and create a thicker smoke.   My thought is two part:   You did not allow the lump charcoal to reach full heat and then added in the water soaked wood chunks/chips too early which actually put the charcoals out (and by the time you realized the heat was too low and opened up in full your charcoal was half out).  You soaked the wood but then didn't drain the water very well and actually in the effort to throw the chunks or chips in you also managed a good deal of water on the charcoal below which likely appeared to give off a quick blast of smoke but may have actually been steam from the water burning off the hot charcoals.   Also not every lump charcoal is created equal. Bigger chunks of charcoal tend to allow for longer burning but they take a bit more energy to fully light initially. Smaller chips ignite quickly but tend to clog the air vent at the bottom of the smoker if you use a Kamado grill. I have used both and I have found suffocation issues from super tiny bits of charcoal if I did not allow the charcoal to begin turning white/grey before addressing temperature controls.   Bottom line with any grill I have cooked on is that you need to allow full ignition of the charcoal before Doing any cooking or any flavor chunks of wood or you suffer from temperature issues of some sort (flare ups as more charcoal catches, Dropping temps because of inadequately lit charcoal).   Im likely being redundant - I apologize as I have had a few to drink lol"
smoking,3c1d3j,Dopplers_Effect,2,Sat Jul 4 06:05:48 2015 UTC,"I have had this happen.  If you cut off the air flow the coals can go out but the grill holds temp well.  What i did was blow thru the bottom vents, up thru the coals.  Different grills have different vent positions, but mine was easy to get to.  I never opened the lid.  Worked great."
smoking,3c1d3j,bxna,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:36:38 2015 UTC,Piggy backing on this -   If you own a dragon grill fan or looft lighter equivalence you can use those to blow the air through the bottom vents.   Check for tiny bits of charcoal or burnt charcoal ash in he holes blocking oxygen flow as well.

I've never seen a raw rear ham in the store.   Point being, I use picnic and Boston butt (shoulder) interchangeably for pulled pork. I will often gently debone it, taking care to leave the muscles as intact as possible. Then I stuff the cavity with bacon and rub. I will also peel the skin back to put rub under it. I use cooking twine to put it back together. Smoke it skin side up. Don't try to pull any of the gristle with the meat, and it comes out just fine."

smoking,3c0a4v,Muff1n5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"Hey there.. Yeah, bark will still form.. In fact, I'd say it forms largely during the stall.  Mine starts to stall around the 160F, the bark will be a loose red with some granular pieces of the rub still evident.. once it hits around the 170F-175F point the bark will be the glossy ebony I go for.  I then wrap with some apple cider vinegar.  To combat the softness of the bark, I let it rest in foil for awhile - how long will depend on when I'm going to serve - but when it gets close to go time I'll pull it out of the foil and put it back on the smoker.. That'll fix up your bark just right.  A buddy of mine and myself have been comparing notes.. I live in a very very very dry climate and he's in a very humid climate.. We have very different cooks - so your environment will impact your smoke.  His finishes quicker at the traditional 225F and his bark looks much better earlier on.  I have to crank up my heat to get the same timeline."

Some like dry, some like sauce mopped on, etc...  There are so many ways to cook ribs.  The right way for you will depend your tastes.  So my advise is to try all methods to see what you like.  Each time you cook ribs, only change one thing at a time so you can accurately evaluate if that change was a good change...have as little variables as possible from cook to cook so you fully understand what that change did for you.  It took me about 2 years to really dial in my ribs to exactly how my family and I like them, and I'm still evolving, trying small changes as I go.  My methods might not be at all right for you, so try it all and eliminate what does not work."

smoking,3byjv4,daynedaman,2,Fri Jul 3 14:38:47 2015 UTC,If your making the rib in the smoker. Cut open and smoke an onion inside the grill for around 2 hours in the beginning of your cook. It makes the meat taste great plus you can mix it in the meat later for added flavor.
smoking,3byjv4,militarypuzzle,2,Fri Jul 3 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"If you are doing a 3-2-1 or some variation, put honey, brown sugar, and butter/margarine on them before wrapping, then dust them with a bit more dry rub after unwrapping and put them back on the rack."

I'm not sure what exactly the butter/margarine does exactly, probably makes them more moist and tender, but Johnny Trigg who is one of the rib kings uses a bottle of blue parkay squeeze margarine as his signature thing. Every time I've used it, they come out tasting great. I prefer not to add sauce while it's on the smoker so you need something to add that sweetness other than just the sugar in the dry rub.

smoking,3byy1r,RussianDat,2,Fri Jul 3 07:59:05 2015 UTC,"This is mostly based on my own opinion, but here goes:   Every brisket is different. You have to decide how tender it is. Some get probe tender at 198, some at 200, some at 205. It depends on the animal it came from. That's why recipes are, at best, a guideline and not concrete rules Don't use just wood, especially in a grill. It will wind up over-smoking the brisket, making it bitter. I would use a snake/fuse. In my experience, that's the best way to maintain a (relatively) steady low-and-slow temp in a grill. My experience is that a snake 2 briquettes wide by 2 briquettes tall gives me around 216 degrees. Also, based purely based on my taste, apple smoke is too delicate for beef. I recommend pecan, hickory, or oak (I hate mesquite). I think the best way to re-warm smoked meats is sous vide, or a method close to it. I usually vacuum pack my leftovers, but you can replicate this is a zipper-lock bag. Put it in a pot of cold water (make sure the bag doesn't touch the bottom of the pot, or it may melt) and bring the pot to 140-160. Leave it there for 10 or 15 minutes, and enjoy. I think a brisket needs to be injected."

smoking,3byy1r,qovneob,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:59:48 2015 UTC,"For your grill, look into doing a snake method with your charcoal. It saves fuel and gives a more consistent temperature. I do 2 briquettes wide on the bottom and one briquette wide layer on top with a wood chunk every 4-6 inches and wood chips in between.   Use a good thermometer to keep an eye on meat temp. If it slowly rises, you could take it to 200-203 before removing it to rest for at least an hour. If temp is going up quicker, pull and wrap it around 190-195 as it'll keep cooking."
smoking,3byy1r,beer_madness,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"I'll give you my $0.02:  Internal temp is only a guideline, cook brisket (or shoulders etc.) until they FEEL tender when probed.  If you use a lower pit temp, they will tender-up at a lower internal (~200°) - if you use a higher pit temp they won't tender up until the internal is higher (~205° or higher).  The two-zone set-up is fine.  Use lump (natural) charcoal as it brings a little flavor of it's own to the party. You only need pieces of flavor wood not a 50/50 mix, and I like to mix either chips or pellets within the charcoal as well and light with a torch.  Reheating can be done in vacuum bags or in a covered pan. But you need liquids in with the meat.  Foil juices, broth, apple or white grape juice, or CocaCola are all good choices. Following reheating be sure to add a finishing rub to wake-up the flavors.  I use injections and/or injectable LiteBrines on most all meats. They add flavor and insure moistness."
smoking,3byy1r,3rdIQ,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:11:26 2015 UTC,"Besides what the others have said, I know this is kind of sacrilege but if you're in a hurry you can reheat a lot of smoked meats at about 40% power in the microwave.

smoking,3bwahf,shaky_handed_surgeon,2,Thu Jul 2 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of times this happens when the ribs are wet packed. They take on a lot of moisture and obviously lose it as the meat cooks. This method gives the meat packer a good way to get rid of shitty ribs because they appear to be supple and full of meat. These are probably from National Beef or BPI.  When this happens, you pay for it. There's nothing you could have done differently in temperature or time to fix these. If you cooked them less they'd have been tough. As a poster above said, get some from a local butcher and pay a bit extra. It's well worth it. Ask them when they cut their ribeyes and tell them you'd like the ribs whole. Any decent butcher will hook you up....hope this helps."

They can be tasty but honestly not a lot of meat. If you have a good butcher ask them to cut you a slab of short plate ribs. That's the meaty almost pornographic ones you tend to see on here. They're full of awesome marbled fat and when cooked right are better than steak imo. The official name is NAMP 123A.  Save the sauce for your pork ribs. Beef ribs only need 2 things: kosher salt and course ground pepper. The flavor of the meat in the short ribs is so good that those seasonings are all it really needs.   Other than that, good going and do keep at it. Any smoking is good smoking!"

smoking,3bxkzx,drummel1,4,Fri Jul 3 00:43:32 2015 UTC,I use kingsfords and oak/cherry. My brisket tastes great idgaf.

smoking,3bxkzx,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Fri Jul 3 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"Smokier. The lump adds smoke flavor. In fact, I have a friend who adds no wood to his lump. Says its smoky enough with just the lump. Now me, I love oak, so I use Royal Oak lump charcoal, and I add oak chunks, and I get fantastic smoke flavor, much more than I used to get when I used briquettes with added chips/chunks."
smoking,3bxkzx,TheDahktor,2,Fri Jul 3 11:27:57 2015 UTC,"I will second this. I find I go through a bit more lump than briquettes (I like the Royal Oak Lump as well) but you get a mellow underlying smokey flavor, in addition to your main wood chunk flavor, that I can't recreate with chunk wood alone.  Trying to do the same with chunks alone (by using more of it) just overpowers the meat. I love to use lump for the grill for this reason too."

They will always be ""overcooked"", as in they will always go far beyond what you would do with a roast in the oven.  You're cooking so that the fatty tissue breaks down into gelatin so you could go on for a very long time.  That's why there is the 3-2-1 rule and you just cook for 6 hours and call it good."

Sort of the standard rule of thumb is 1.5 hours per pound. Mine take less, yours might too, but if it's done early you can foil wrap it and stick it in a cooler for hours. If it's done late, well, all you can do is drink more, which isn't a bad thing, but it can lead to a belly full of nachos, which is ALSO not a bad thing, except for all that pork you just cooked."
smoking,3bveac,Mr-Mills,10,Thu Jul 2 13:43:20 2015 UTC,If it's your first ever smoke I would recommend pork butt or shoulder. The cut is super forgiving. You can make a bunch of mistakes and still eat it. Ribs can be really bad if you mess them up.
smoking,3bveac,kilgore1313,5,Thu Jul 2 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"All of your questions are personal preference.  I would advise you to do a dry run with no meat on your smoker to ensure you know how to maintain temps for 12+ hours,  keep it simple the first time you do a meat (you can get a great result with just salt, pepper, and time - or a simple rub mix of which there are hundreds of recipes online).  There are so many ways to do things and you have to learn your own style.

If you haven't done so, yet, I'd recommend making a really damn hot (I'm talking cleansing hellfire) fire to get all the factory shit burned out of your rig.  After that, have a go at trying to make a reasonable smoking fire and learn how to control temps in your setup.  That'll make your first real smoke way more enjoyable."

I made my own  special blend but really its just a bag of seasonings i put together, some of it from what i have read and some my own personal touch...heres one i dont see often...use mustard (i used dijon) as a coating on your ribs to help the rub stick. It creates an awesome crust. And apply rub liberally! Dont be shy. Especially if you plan on a low and slow cook. But like i said man...just dive into it. Good luck!"

I happen to enjoy the challenge, myself.  And the fact that I have a lot of real estate to either smoke, bbq, or grill on.  If you want a smoker, though, and don;t want to deal with the COS hate and hassles, try looking at a Weber Smokey Mountain or one of it's knock-offs.  The WSM will run $2-300, but it about as close a set-it-and-walk-away as you can get in that price range.  My buddy did two briskets in his, in sub-zero MN Winter that came out awesome!!

The first one I got I would leave the ashes in the firebox until the next cook.  After the metal started getting pitted after a year I started cleaning it out after the cook but only getting the ash and chunks out.  It eventually rusted completely through after 5 years.  The next one I started cleaning it completely out and washing the fire box out after every cook and applying oil/cooking spray.  I've had that one for 10 years now and it's still doing fine.  And the metal is pretty thin..

smoking,3bwdyj,Hellview152,2,Thu Jul 2 19:44:33 2015 UTC,Oh boy. My friend has done two buffalo briskets and they both came out rubbery as hell. Not 100% on his method but he's no novice. Buffalo/bison is real tricky to get right. I'd stick to beef and call around for the best price.
smoking,3bwdyj,3rdIQ,2,Fri Jul 3 07:40:37 2015 UTC,We go to Denver a few times a year and get pork bellies at the Asian Markets and really good deals on pork butts or whole shoulders at the Latino Markets.  I generally get brisket at my local Sam's Club.
smoking,3bvj8q,A1ucardBe1mont,2,Thu Jul 2 14:26:29 2015 UTC,Why not just smoke it over night Friday?
smoking,3bvj8q,coachwyo,5,Thu Jul 2 15:31:20 2015 UTC,Because not all of us have a setup that allows us to sleep while something is smoking.
smoking,3bvj8q,dayflyer55,2,Thu Jul 2 16:34:24 2015 UTC,I thought about that but I have to make a long drive Saturday morning so I thought doing this would be allot easier for me to do.
smoking,3bvj8q,ralphyb0b,2,Thu Jul 2 15:41:12 2015 UTC,What time are you planning on eating on the 4th? You could use a cooler with some big bottles of hot water to keep it for quite a long time.  Fill up something like this Ozarka bottle with really hot water and put it in the cooler with your meat: http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-682b/k2-_64d967bc-6674-4009-9203-ef00ab0e5cc6.v1.jpg
smoking,3bvj8q,ralphyb0b,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:32:09 2015 UTC,Oh serving it warm to hot wouldn't be a problem. It's just a time thing and I can't smoke while I sleep. I just wanted to know if cooking it the way I said would work.
smoking,3bvj8q,StraightoutaBrompton,2,Thu Jul 2 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, you sure can smoke it at first and then finish it in the oven. I would probably do over 200 degrees though."
smoking,3bvj8q,Vuelhering,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:39:56 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for the help! I thought it would work but I just wanted to make sure I wouldn't be ruining the brisket.

smoking,3bwbe8,XtremeBBQ,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:43:38 2015 UTC,This is pretty much how I do it too only i add a couple more ingredients for the relish after the brats are cooked. Learnt this method while in Germany.
smoking,3bwbe8,MOS95B,0,Fri Jul 3 07:50:21 2015 UTC,"I know it is tradional and revered by most, but...  eww"
smoking,3bwbe8,snarkky,2,Thu Jul 2 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"I smoke brats regularly while I have other things going. I just use Johnsonville and smoke them at 225-250 for anywhere between 1.5-2 hours. My best results are with a hickory/apple mix. They should, depending on the wood of choice, come out with a nice dark red color on the outside. When they start to wrinkle, pull them off and enjoy. If you don't smoke them too hot and too long, they'll stay juicy. I love smoked brats."
smoking,3bwbe8,MOS95B,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"I smoke raw sausages for about an hour, brats are delicious over cherry, before finishing them on the grill  Sadly, I have to admit I've not tried just straight smoked brats.  But, it shouldn't be that different than any other meat, 275 or so until done (meat thermometer)"
smoking,3bwbe8,TomEdison43050,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best way is to grill them high heat.  I assume that your ribs are being cooked around 225, right?  If you want to smoke them for about 30 minutes at 225 just to impart smoke, no problem.  But I'd move them to a grill afterwards to finish and sear.  When it comes to cooking them in beer, I did a test regarding this a while back.  I'll copy my text below from when I posted this previously.  I did a bratwurst test tonight. I've always been fine with brats on the grill, but every authentic Wisconsin recipe says that you absolutely HAVE to do brats in a beer/onion mixture, simmer until cooked, then on the grill to sear, then serve.  Well, I did an experiment tonight....3 brats went into a mixture of beer, onions and a bit of butter. They simmered until around 130. Then I took 3 brats and got them started on the grill with no beer simmer. Finished off the beer-simmered-brats by searing at the right temp (160), and got the grilled brats at the same internal temp (160) about the exact same time as the simmered brats (rather proud of myself on that one!) smile emoticon  Well, honestly - the grilled brats were better and juicier. And doesn't this make sense? If you simmer a cased sausage/meat in liquid for 20 minutes or so, the cooking will certainly create pressure inside, and drive all the juices out over the longer cooking time. All of the simmered brats had a big casing-blowout on the ends. With grilling, you cook for only about 5 minutes, the casing might blowout, but it was not nearly as big, and the cooking time was less, which I think kept more juices inside.  Whatever theories I might have as to why (right or wrong)....the grilled brats were noticeably better tasting.  In the end, while the beer/onion/butter simmer SMELLED AWESOME, it was a waste of good beer."
smoking,3bvlta,muksak,6,Thu Jul 2 14:47:49 2015 UTC,I was only able to get half shoulders from my local store a few weeks ago and I smoked both halves and it turned out great.  Cooked in half the time and had all the same flavor - in fact because it was split there was more bark to go around.  It wasn't dry or anything like that.  My process was the same as you plan on - smoked up to 185ish then wrapped until 203.  As far as I can tell and from everything I've found in searches there's really no downside to it except maybe taking up more room in the smoker if you're short on space.  I actually wonder why it isn't the norm to split them.
smoking,3bvlta,coffee2050,3,Thu Jul 2 15:08:54 2015 UTC,I always do this. The shoulders that I get from the local restaurant supply store are too big for me so I at least separate them into halves and usually quarters.
smoking,3bvlta,yankeefan138,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:36:58 2015 UTC,About how much do those quarters end up weighing? I just buying the pork from the grocery store and they are usually around 3.5-4.5 pounds I believe.
smoking,3bvlta,yankeefan138,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:43:34 2015 UTC,I think the original piece is usually about 12-16lbs
smoking,3bvlta,gun-nut,2,Thu Jul 2 16:11:55 2015 UTC,I know that slicing it into thin pieces will let less smoke get at more meat (surface area vs. Volume) I haven't done pork but I have had a lot of success with thin slices of venison. Just be careful not to let it dry out to much.
smoking,3bvlta,chasonreddit,2,Thu Jul 2 15:03:33 2015 UTC,One of the things that makes pork so bulletproof is the size and shape.  It doesn't dry out and consists mostly of whole muscles.  So it stays pretty moist no matter how you mistreat it.   Every cut will diminish this effect.   So long as you keep your pieces at least 3-4 lbs each you shouldn't have any trouble.  And will get the results you are looking for plus more bark if that's your thing.  But don't go stir-fry on it.

smoking,3bvjb1,Whiteelefant,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:27:55 2015 UTC,I just pulled some bacon off the smoker yesterday. My favorite recipes are liquor based. I did a maple bourbon this time and a scotch honey bacon a time before. Just check up online a few recipes to get an idea of the proportions of everything and start making it your own.  It's tough to go wrong.
