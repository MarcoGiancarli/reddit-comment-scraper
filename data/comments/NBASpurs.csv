NBASpurs,3e3yzl,LeoCRC,17,Tue Jul 21 19:49:00 2015 UTC,Ettore Messina seems to be the guy. I love Becks but Messina was the best coach in Europe and has decades of experience over her.   Her day will come though.
NBASpurs,3e3yzl,IncognitoBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure about Messina, just out of the fact that I don't know him so well... but Pop just said that he's planning on finishing his contract ( iirc that's 4 more years) and I'm not sure Messina is willing to be an assitant for that long"
NBASpurs,3e3yzl,Shipupi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"True, probably not to appealing to wait around 4 years and on top of that you have to take over for Pop."

NBASpurs,3e3yzl,find_my_harborcoat,6,Tue Jul 21 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"I think there is actually a decent chance of it happening.  If Pop really does coach out the length of his contract, even if he doesn't sign another, I can't see Messina wanting to be an assistant for that long.  Can't imagine Chip and Chad have HC aspirations (or really opportunities for that matter), and Borrego didn't seem like anything special (even for what he had to work with) in ORL, so that pretty much leaves Becky and Ime.  I think just because she's a woman there is at least somewhat less of a chance of other teams poaching her, and I also think she might be a little more inclined to stay with the team that first gave her a shot."

NBASpurs,3e3yzl,sfoxy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:53:47 2015 UTC,She doesn't seem as instrumental as Messina. I'm sure she is bringing something to the table but right now I honestly think she's getting out a lot more than she's putting in. I'm not bothered by it because that's how the Spurs have become such a great franchise. Pop knows how to invest in people and get remarkable returns on that.
NBASpurs,3e3yzl,Uncle_Skeeter,3,Tue Jul 21 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"Good luck with that, Becky."

NBASpurs,3e3yzl,KuyaJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:20:45 2015 UTC,"i think she would really benefit from a couple more years as assistant to pop.   i could imagine there is a team out there that is willing to sign her, maybe for basketball reasons, maybe just because they want to make a splash, but i really hope she declines and stays for a few more years to learn from pop."

Just because Pop gave her this opportunity doesn't mean she is next in line by any means. Gotta pay your dues in the big leagues. I honestly think she would be better served to coach in the WNBA, or at the college level."

I know he still has a lot to prove, but he should at least provide quality minutes off the bench.

NBASpurs,3e0qec,S0N0RA,12,Tue Jul 21 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard that said before. But, it'll be hard for anyone....ever...to do what Manu has done. Literally, one of the smartest to ever play the game, and quite possibly the most crafty, ever, as well. Gino has so much competitive drive"
NBASpurs,3e0qec,rollkall,4,Tue Jul 21 01:52:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not saying he is Manu, or could replace Manu, but in terms of explosiveness and energy, and maybe some of the controlled uncontrolled control reminds me of a young Manu."
NBASpurs,3e0qec,Hotdamncoffee,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"I hear you man, you arent trying to say that he can replace THE Manu Ginobili. But can anyone, ever?   Who has the link to that article about what a weird talent Manu is, and how Manu he is irreplaceable."
NBASpurs,3e0qec,jpops4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:26 2015 UTC,Definitely doesn't have his passing though
NBASpurs,3e0qec,andres7832,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:51:25 2015 UTC,"I dont think anyone ever will, but Simmons did a passable job making the right passes in SL. Nothing resembling Manu in flair, risk, whoa factor, accuracy or ambition, but Simmons did ok distributing the ball and finding the open man."
NBASpurs,3e0qec,typeskeyboard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:42 2015 UTC,If he stays grounded and learns the system he can be a Manu type 6th player.  Never will we replace Manu But Simmons can help us fill that role.
NBASpurs,3e0qec,Hotdamncoffee,4,Tue Jul 21 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"I see that for sure: very explosive, energetic, and just a wild card. But I think that what makes Manu, Manu is how tactically creative he is, ESPECIALLY with his passing. There is a lot of influence from soccer on his game, Nash was the same way."
NBASpurs,3e0qec,smithy006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"I never thought of it like that, but you're spot on, especially about the soccer thing, I know some guys where passing is the best part of their game and they also have a soccer background."
NBASpurs,3e0qec,wm210,2,Tue Jul 21 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say harden but people compare harden to Manu as well. But harden can't play D like manu did in his prime, or chooses not to. Either way I like Simmons so far."
NBASpurs,3e0qec,andrewcortex,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"The way he just springs a two handed dunk out of nowhere, or cuts off ball has a very similar style of movements, actually. I can see it. (Not comparing skill level, obviously)"
NBASpurs,3e0qec,69pissface420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"Sorta but not really. He's a slasher, sure, but he relies more on the crossover + a quick first step than Manu, who was always more of a PnR or full head of steam slasher."
NBASpurs,3e0qec,ArthurSB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"A lit bit, i think he will grown, maybe in a 6th man manu-like or he will be a really good role player, you know, bringing energy from the benche, and giving us a good deep(and talented) bench.  Most likelly the second option, i supose."

NBASpurs,3dzsoq,InstinctBlu3s,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:09 2015 UTC,LMA said he's willing to play at the 5 and guard who Duncan usually guards when he rests. He said it'll be a good challenge for him and it's not a big deal like what the media has been hinting at during free agency.
NBASpurs,3dzpty,ClareCoursesFTW,3,Mon Jul 20 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"Slim to none, we're basically all set with filling out the SA roster for next season.  He may find a home in Austin and if Boban the Barbarian doesn't work out there's a chance he could get called up.  He didn't do too much to separate himself from the crowd during summer league but there's plenty of time for him to impress scouts."
NBASpurs,3dzpty,Go0n,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:49 2015 UTC,I have the same question about Treveon graham being from VCU an all haha. I'm just hoping treveon makes the D - league and then makes power moves after 1 or 2 seasons

NBASpurs,3dwk35,MidnightRofl,3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"I mean, Glen Rice Jr was the MVP last year so let's not get ahead of ourselves. That said, I love Kyle and his game. As an Austin native I hope to see him balling out in cedar park a few games this year"
NBASpurs,3dwk35,Smellmyhand,7,Mon Jul 20 16:12:24 2015 UTC,What position is he even?
NBASpurs,3dwk35,ilijazunic55,24,Mon Jul 20 07:19:32 2015 UTC,MVP
NBASpurs,3dwk35,Smellmyhand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, he's generally a SF but has ball handling skills so I think it'd be interesting to see if Pop uses him more at the 2 or even the 1"
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,greasyfunky,18,Mon Jul 20 02:18:15 2015 UTC,Well deserved by the numbers he is putting up. I hope he will continue to make waves when he gets more playing time on the Spurs.
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,Josh_Escobear,16,Mon Jul 20 03:14:46 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this is the season he can function as a solid backup for Kawhi.   Edit: Also, I find it hilarious that in a time where the Spurs won free agency they also end up with the Summer League MVP, rofl."
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,Trancefam,3,Mon Jul 20 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"I've only watched one game this summer (the bucks), he was definitely an aggressive scorer from what I saw. What I didn't see was his passing flair and his assists are way low (under 2 apg). I'm sure that can change with better players around him, I was just hoping to see boris diaw type passes."
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,Geohalbert,8,Mon Jul 20 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably because the Spurs often have their roster players work on improving or demonstrating specific things during Summer League, often not things that are their strengths (see TD working on jumpers from specific spots in 1997 and looking bad in comparison to Ostertag).  They know he's a dope passer but probably wanted to see how he was at using hesitation moves to get to the bucket and/or draw contact, as well as doing some spotting up for shots."
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,find_my_harborcoat,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:41 2015 UTC,He had no one else who could score aside from Simmons. That probably had more to do with it than anything.
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,CryHav0c,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:07 2015 UTC,He was the primary scorer for this SL team so I expected his FG% to take a dip but his shooting % and assist to turnovers were terrible this summer. Hopefully one of he or Simmons can improve their shooting and passing and offer some bench scoring like Belinelli used to

NBASpurs,3dwdyb,boying747,5,Mon Jul 20 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, that's funny. It does look a bit unkept in person too."
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,tvfilm,2,Mon Jul 20 09:29:16 2015 UTC,I saw someone in r/NBA refer to him as evil steph curry or something like that. I can dig it.
NBASpurs,3dwdyb,Mattsasse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:28 2015 UTC,Maybe because he played back to back to back to back and had no time to shave it.
NBASpurs,3dzgi3,Go0n,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:17 2015 UTC,Some of the top posts all-time in the Phoenix subreddit are Spurs hatejerks.   I sleep sound at night knowing we denied them playoff glory almost  a half dozen times in the Steve Nash era.
NBASpurs,3dzgi3,TimDuncanTheAlmighty,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:42 2015 UTC,Loved whoppin D'antoni's ass at his own game.
NBASpurs,3dydoh,NoahthePretzel,11,Mon Jul 20 15:23:44 2015 UTC,"""REJECTED by Duncan!"" ""REJECTED by Duncan!"" I think this was Game 5. And then the DJ goaltending.... jesus, I almost died."
NBASpurs,3dydoh,labpluto123,11,Mon Jul 20 17:24:51 2015 UTC,My favorite was probably late season when we absolutely whipped the Warriors. Really gave me hope that if we kept a decent seed & stayed healthy then we'd make another deep run.
NBASpurs,3dydoh,CaptainChronocide,16,Mon Jul 20 17:04:17 2015 UTC,In my opinion some of the best games were games we lost. The triple overtime game versus the grizzlies and the Cavs/Kyrie going off game was great too. I know we lost but as a basketball fan those are great. The final game versus the Rockets where Tim blocked harden was great too.
NBASpurs,3dydoh,WEINERDOGvsBADGER,9,Mon Jul 20 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"Came here to say the Cavs game. Talk about a Finals atmosphere, great game by both teams and well won by them."
NBASpurs,3dydoh,Baribal,6,Mon Jul 20 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"""He just hammered him"" is my favorite part of the whole season. The salt, the block. Oh my fuck"
NBASpurs,3dydoh,Sweatycocks,5,Mon Jul 20 16:45:07 2015 UTC,Let's not forget Game 7
NBASpurs,3dydoh,Smellmyhand,3,Mon Jul 20 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"Got decent college discount tickets at the last minute for the 3 OT Grizz game. Will always be one of the best game I've attended, so many huge shots by both teams. I still enjoy looking at the videos I got of Danny and Tim's buzzer beaters from time to time."
NBASpurs,3dydoh,Chillinthamost,7,Mon Jul 20 20:45:16 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the rockets game where duncan blocked harden at the rim I'll always remember that moment
NBASpurs,3dydoh,Win_Duncan,4,Mon Jul 20 18:08:10 2015 UTC,Same here
NBASpurs,3dydoh,o0adam0o,5,Mon Jul 20 18:12:15 2015 UTC,For me.... Kawhi leonard vs the warriors. I know its a team game but with 4 steals on curry in about 5 mins 26 points in 26 minutes and he didn't even play beyond the first few minutes of the second half. He came in with  like 15 points and just went back off. All jump shots and post moves. You could just see the frustration in the warriors. And then... He just sits. Its like having Cerberus on a leash.
NBASpurs,3dydoh,ParkBaller27,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:55 2015 UTC,The Rockets game at the very end of the season where we did hack-a everybody.
NBASpurs,3dydoh,klemkb,4,Mon Jul 20 17:45:02 2015 UTC,"The Cavs game that we won because Manu was the hero. He had too many games last year where he shat the bed late, but he robbed Lebron on that last play to win the game. It was nice to see him be the hero again."
NBASpurs,3dydoh,amp112,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:47 2015 UTC,The game against the Rockets when TD got the game winning block vs the Rocket.  On the MVP runner up no less
NBASpurs,3dydoh,Mattsasse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:48 2015 UTC,"For me it was either the rockets game where Timmy got the clutch block on Harden (I live in Houston so that game was a fun one with my rockets fan friends), or the Pacers game in Indiana because my gf surprised me with tickets and we drove from Oxford, OH (I go to Miami University) and we got to see Pop's 1000th win on a super super close game."
NBASpurs,3dxe8u,idioticpeople,7,Mon Jul 20 09:20:01 2015 UTC,"He's been a nice surprise during Summer League but I'm unsure how much PT Pop is willing to give him next year.  I like the athleticism and explosiveness he's bringing, definitely something we need."
NBASpurs,3dxe8u,Dimaaaa,4,Mon Jul 20 10:14:00 2015 UTC,I was thinking he can take Bellinelli's minutes?   What do you guy's think?
NBASpurs,3dxe8u,Airgerman,5,Mon Jul 20 10:44:59 2015 UTC,Those minutes will go to whichever player can hit consistent Catch and shoot shots from the perimeter. This makes Simmons the more likely candidate. I think we will see KA more though.
NBASpurs,3dxe8u,LCee210,4,Mon Jul 20 15:56:44 2015 UTC,Hopefully those minutes go to Anderson. He does well in Summer and D league but he desperately needs minutes in a NBA setting
NBASpurs,3dxe8u,LCee210,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see KA thriving in the NBA, too slow for the wing, maybe as a 3 he can play a role but not as a 2."
NBASpurs,3dxe8u,tvfilm,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:58 2015 UTC,Thats what i meant. Marco played back up to Khawi last year. We didn't have a true back up 3.
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,DanParker001,26,Sun Jul 19 23:52:14 2015 UTC,That Simmons dunk
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,timokazaki,11,Sun Jul 19 23:54:54 2015 UTC,Nasty
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,lowcontextculture,7,Sun Jul 19 23:56:07 2015 UTC,He can jump!  Good for at least 1 dunk per game.
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,ginobili,10,Mon Jul 20 00:08:08 2015 UTC,Don't forget kawhi!
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,SquandasNutCheese,5,Mon Jul 20 00:09:43 2015 UTC,For sure.. I meant Jonathan personally good for 1 dunk.
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,ginobili,18,Mon Jul 20 01:18:56 2015 UTC,"Simmons is definitely legit. Plays well on both sides of the court.   Spurs also need to lock up Eddie. At the very least, you get a 3 point specialist."
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,Trancefam,7,Mon Jul 20 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if they're still looking for a wing Eddie is the guy to bring up."
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,Koozzie,3,Mon Jul 20 00:43:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I just don't know if they'll actually have space on their roster. Don't they already have 15 players under contract? Given that he's been playing pretty solid in the Summer League, I don't know if they'll be able to keep him around on their D-League team.   A lot of guys in SL jack up shots. Not everyone looks good or is consistent. As Isaiah Thomas said, Eddie's shots look good even when he misses, lol."
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,Trancefam,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:56 2015 UTC,I believe Bonner was number 14. Spurs still have 1 slot. Although in many of the previous years they've left slot 15 open to start the season.
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,Mattsasse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:46 2015 UTC,Reggie Williams was taking up a spot. I assume they can get rid of him if they want since there was an update saying they weren't opposed to adding another wing
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,Koozzie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:17:57 2015 UTC,"He's also a good dude, talked to him quite a bit after games, very genuine."

NBASpurs,3dvxmr,jorgegil96,11,Sun Jul 19 23:52:52 2015 UTC,I'm having a blast watching these games.
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,squanchy_56,9,Sun Jul 19 23:59:34 2015 UTC,Simmons had 2 monster jams in this game.  Check out his other on the 7 footer. Jonathan Simmons
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,ginobili,8,Mon Jul 20 02:03:00 2015 UTC,We're going to get more than one dunk a week this season boys!
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,nokarmawhore,7,Mon Jul 20 00:26:46 2015 UTC,My blood pressure went through the roof. Unbelievable comeback.
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,surprised-duncan,51,Mon Jul 20 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"Let's hope we can play the Suns, just so we can take something else away from them."
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,Streeb-Greebling,18,Sun Jul 19 23:55:54 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. I love that they hate us. I love that we own them.
NBASpurs,3dvxmr,Tyranitator,9,Mon Jul 20 00:01:14 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even give a crap except for the fact that they still won't shut up and move on.

NBASpurs,3dvxmr,monkey_swagger,3,Mon Jul 20 01:46:37 2015 UTC,I think 8 central time
NBASpurs,3dw0ql,karlchilders1,8,Mon Jul 20 00:19:33 2015 UTC,I love that quarter.
NBASpurs,3dw0ql,YourOnlyVato,2,Mon Jul 20 01:10:45 2015 UTC,I HATED that quarter. Even my friend who's a Lakers fan was going ballistic.   I cheered so much I ended up with a severe headache through halftime and some of the third. Seriously never seen anything like that in any sport before (not old enough to have seen Nova do their thing in the championship game).  .

NBASpurs,3dxlzo,jsmooth4hawks,6,Mon Jul 20 11:10:28 2015 UTC,"I think he'll definitely get a camp invite, he earned that."
NBASpurs,3dxlzo,KuyaJohnny,3,Mon Jul 20 12:21:29 2015 UTC,That's what I'm thinking. Hopefully he can improve his defense and earn a spot. His shooting definitely gives him a chance.
NBASpurs,3dxlzo,Koozzie,4,Mon Jul 20 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"The Spurs might give him a shot at some point, but very unlikely he gets a guaranteed contract imo. The team likes entering the season with an open roster spot."
NBASpurs,3dxlzo,m__surly,4,Mon Jul 20 19:18:06 2015 UTC,I like him and hope he sticks around the organization.
NBASpurs,3dxlzo,hoopdummy,4,Mon Jul 20 14:00:09 2015 UTC,Hope Eddie makes the team. He's a great shooter.
NBASpurs,3dwkix,drivin12,6,Mon Jul 20 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"Ah shit, he's too old now. Blow it up boys, time to rebuild."

NBASpurs,3dwjb7,Go0n,3,Mon Jul 20 03:06:54 2015 UTC,Is it just me or is Slow Mo faster than usual today?
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,gamesshades,11,Mon Jul 20 04:42:13 2015 UTC,For sure the Golden State Warriors are the biggest threat. They just came off a 67 win season. Plus they already have experience in the playoffs.    GSW Thunder (if healthy) Clippers Rockets.
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,tlbking99,5,Mon Jul 20 04:46:44 2015 UTC,For overall west supremacy I 100% agree. I believe though that the Clippers are still our worst matchup head to head. Paul disrupts Tony to no end and we still don't really have a consistent defensive answer for Blake and Deandre outside of the hacka strategy. Our perimeter D will be a nightmare for those other 3 teams.
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,Mattsasse,3,Mon Jul 20 05:26:57 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Memphis goes up against the clippers because I miss that rivalry.
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,Koozzie,2,Mon Jul 20 17:41:55 2015 UTC,I prefer the golden state-clippers rivalry myself but both are great. I'm still salty towards Memphis for various reasons so I'd rather we get to beat them ourselves.
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,Mattsasse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"If we face Memphis I want it to be in the WCF. Mostly because I like Memphis and the Spurs either of them in the finals is fine with me. But also because Memphis is not going to be an easy out for anyone (if healthy). People seem to be counting them out, but that golden state series would have been a lot tougher had Conley and Allen been at least like 80%"
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,Koozzie,6,Mon Jul 20 19:29:16 2015 UTC,I think with a healthy Dmo and the addition of Lawson the Rockets are just as dangerous as the thunder. I think:   GSW Rockets-Thunder-Clippers Memphis
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,Geohalbert,5,Mon Jul 20 16:12:59 2015 UTC,Clippers and thunder
NBASpurs,3dwt5s,kemar7856,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:56:30 2015 UTC,Warriors - Rockets - OKC - Clippers. All those teams have youth and athleticism.
NBASpurs,3dwx60,andres7832,8,Mon Jul 20 05:25:34 2015 UTC,I like the guy but we need a wing. 3 PGs is enough. If we didn't get McCallum i'd be all for this. He can probably get paid better somewhere else as well
NBASpurs,3dwx60,Mattsasse,2,Mon Jul 20 05:42:11 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it, the less it makes sense. It would be an easy thing to talk yourself into, but it just doesn't click in my head. He would take minutes from Mills and McCallum, we really need that defensive effort, and we also need another wing to take some of the pressure off of Manu. Don't see it."
NBASpurs,3dwx60,ilijazunic55,2,Mon Jul 20 07:18:17 2015 UTC,Play small-ball with 3 ball-handlers could make the opponents tilt.  And Pablo doesn't need to get minutes. Just when needed.
NBASpurs,3dwx60,regularbassman,2,Mon Jul 20 12:19:59 2015 UTC,YES.
NBASpurs,3dwx60,jjaazz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:14:49 2015 UTC,I dont really see what he'd give us. we have more than enough point guards/ballhandlers/playmakers.   he'd just be an unnecessary defensive liability.
NBASpurs,3dum6d,gosuns33,10,Sun Jul 19 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Excellent review of each move. Very fair on grades as well. Nice post, OP.   By the way, I think the addition of West is very underrated. He is a glue/heart-and-soul kind of player that makes a team stronger even on the bench. (Hope he doesn't spend too much time there...)  By the way, how good is our second unit?  Manu, West, Mills, Diaw, and ???  They could compete with a lot of team's starting 5."
NBASpurs,3dum6d,BeerMeBooze,7,Sun Jul 19 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"I always hated playing against West, it seemed like whenever we faced him he would keep his team close. Can't wait to see how Pop fits him into the rotation, if his one desire is to get a ring, i can see him being even more of a terror than when we faced him."
NBASpurs,3dum6d,eqgmrdbz,5,Sun Jul 19 18:21:22 2015 UTC,I think his quest for a ring will be contagious. It might be that little extra something that we need to get over the hump.
NBASpurs,3dum6d,BeerMeBooze,7,Sun Jul 19 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. As great as the Spurs are, even champions can become complacent. Adding Aldridge and West--two very talented players, hungry for a ring--should be just what they need to win that sixth banner."
NBASpurs,3dum6d,scanner_hymn,2,Sun Jul 19 20:44:30 2015 UTC,Anderson?
NBASpurs,3drzaw,Go0n,16,Sat Jul 18 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, I kind of love that at the every end, Anderson is losing his shit over winning a summer league game.  Between that and the way he serves as the SL version of Patty, always sprinting over to pick up teammates, I feel like he's such a great guy to have on the bench, even if he doesn't end up being Kawhi's backup and plays a role more like Patty's original one on the Spurs where he was mostly known for his towel waving."
NBASpurs,3drzaw,find_my_harborcoat,19,Sun Jul 19 01:00:03 2015 UTC,Simmons is legit.
NBASpurs,3drzaw,steeledl,24,Sat Jul 18 22:24:47 2015 UTC,Becky Hammon is legit!!
NBASpurs,3drzaw,tarek619,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah. She's made some really good calls. Quite a few of the games have been close games, and she's drawn up the right plays for the occasion. Wish there was some sort of video that showed a more in depth, up close look at her discussions in the huddle. I'm just really curious to see her approach and demeanor."
NBASpurs,3drzaw,Trancefam,10,Mon Jul 20 09:21:46 2015 UTC,"The one I'm most intrigued with is Eddie. Over the last 5 games, he's averaged 48% from the 3 point line. Simmons has impressed as well. Maybe the real question is: If the Spurs opted to take a chance on one of these players (Anderson included), who would be the most promising prospect?"
NBASpurs,3drzaw,Trancefam,6,Sat Jul 18 22:31:34 2015 UTC,Simmons and Eddie are really impressive. At least Simmons got the 1 year guaranteed contract. The spurs need another three point shooter on the roster. They should really give Eddie a chance. Wow. 48% from three?! Another team might sign him if the spurs don't pick him up.
NBASpurs,3drzaw,InstinctBlu3s,3,Sat Jul 18 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah. That's right. Forgot Simmons has that 1 year deal. I definitely think Eddie should get some serious consideration after SL concludes.   Edit: Actually, I think it's a 2 year deal."
NBASpurs,3drzaw,Trancefam,2,Sat Jul 18 22:39:01 2015 UTC,Eddie is a one trick pony but he can really shoot the rock and has a quick release. I'd like to see him on the team but at the end of the bench. I think Simmons has a chance to work into the rotation and be a playmaker this year.
NBASpurs,3drzaw,steeledl,4,Sat Jul 18 22:42:02 2015 UTC,Eddie is a good replacement for Belinelli. You can never have enough catch & shoot 3-pt specialists.
NBASpurs,3drzaw,InstinctBlu3s,2,Sat Jul 18 22:46:00 2015 UTC,"Perhaps Simmons has a chance to be the next ""Danny Green"" type of story for the Spurs."
NBASpurs,3drzaw,Trancefam,3,Sat Jul 18 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"Talked to him a couple of times around the arena, he's such a nice guy. No ego at all, friendly and just chill. I really thought that was impressive to see."
NBASpurs,3drzaw,tvfilm,5,Sat Jul 18 23:27:31 2015 UTC,Looked like there were quite a few spurs fans in the arena from what I heard on tv. Must have been fun to watch live.
NBASpurs,3drzaw,InstinctBlu3s,2,Sun Jul 19 00:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yea watched so many games, always the spurs. The lakers games were so packed was not comfortable. Good times."

NBASpurs,3dsoqo,LeoCRC,2,Sun Jul 19 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that finger roll at 1:08 between two defenders. Beautiful"
NBASpurs,3dsiza,STSRAMOS,27,Sun Jul 19 01:09:04 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the consensus even around the league. One reason everyone was willing to shell out 60 million for Green. It's also another reason people were a bit baffled and pissed that we got LMA AND kept the Green/Leonard backcourt duo.   It seems unfair on paper, but thank goodness for our front office and the culture we have created.   Everyone says the players association should be pissed at the Spurs for all of these discounts, but last I checked basketball was a game. Team comes first and ultimately everyone made their own mind up to come here for the price they did.   I love our team."
NBASpurs,3dsiza,wild_thingy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:29:05 2015 UTC,I cannot wait for our match up against golden state for this reason. My dream is to see us put kawhi on curry again and go big. How crazy would  KL2/Green/West/Aldridge/Duncan be.
NBASpurs,3dsiza,ParkBaller27,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:47 2015 UTC,That makes kawhi primary play maker. Think he's ready?
NBASpurs,3dsiza,robinfeud,2,Mon Jul 20 05:06:22 2015 UTC,True. Maybe make it...  Kl2/Green/Diaw/Duncan/Aldridge   Run the point through diaw. Hell you could even put ginobli
NBASpurs,3dsiza,ParkBaller27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:09:35 2015 UTC,True. Maybe make it...  Kl2/Green/Diaw/Duncan/Aldridge   Run the point through diaw. Hell you could even put ginobli
NBASpurs,3dsiza,ParkBaller27,16,Mon Jul 20 05:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Everyone knows what Kawhi brings to the table. People outside of SA are more enamored with Green's 3 point shooting than anything else, but it's his defensive prowess that makes him an important part of the Spurs' success. With teams like GS opting for small ball at times, Green and Kawhi play a huge part in helping to contain their 3 point shooting."
NBASpurs,3dsiza,Trancefam,9,Sun Jul 19 03:32:10 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure it's close. I'm going through it in my head right now and the closest I could think of is George hill and Paul George.
NBASpurs,3dsiza,macbeth_htebcam,8,Sun Jul 19 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"Feel maybe Memphis would be close with Tony Allen and Mike Conley, but really, Kawhi's versatility and length makes all the difference."
NBASpurs,3dsiza,BlackBoxTheme,3,Sun Jul 19 08:07:55 2015 UTC,"That would be another solid choice. But let's get serious we are just going to be talking about second place now and I guess you can flip a coin. Don't discount how amazing Danny green is as a defender, he's usually the one facing the point. To me what sets Danny and kawhi apart is how impactful they are. Timmy deserves some credit for being there to help make them look good as well."
NBASpurs,3dsiza,macbeth_htebcam,3,Sun Jul 19 10:18:16 2015 UTC,take the question mark off it isn't even a question
NBASpurs,3dscdz,S0N0RA,5,Sun Jul 19 00:03:48 2015 UTC,Yes and yes. Hope they sign him. He's got the shooting touch. Perfect for the spurs system.
NBASpurs,3dscdz,InstinctBlu3s,5,Sun Jul 19 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"Between Simmons, Reggie Williams and this guy we would really only have room for two. Reggie is already under contract with us and is technically number 15 with Simmons. Not sure if it's guaranteed or not, but our roster is maxed after Boban and Matt signed."
NBASpurs,3dscdz,wild_thingy,2,Sun Jul 19 02:35:42 2015 UTC,What are the contract details for Williams? I almost wonder if Eddie is a better option than Williams.
NBASpurs,3dscdz,Trancefam,2,Sun Jul 19 03:37:39 2015 UTC,I thought Williams was only on through the end of last season link

NBASpurs,3ds32s,InstinctBlu3s,9,Sat Jul 18 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"Not only did they not put Kawhi or Draymond (or Gobert or Duncan or Gasol or MKG or Bogut), they also put 3 guys who didn't even deserve serious consideration in Davis and Jordan who, other than their blocking and rebounding, leave much to be desired on defensive end, and Jimmy Butler who still is a solid defender but wasn't that good this year. Most of the other categories seem fine but not they definitely screwed up the Best Defender category."
NBASpurs,3ds32s,jflowers321,10,Sat Jul 18 23:18:35 2015 UTC,"That's why people have said before, players shouldn't be allowed to vote. They vote for their friends. I guess players are also upset about Draymond Green winning the title because he is not afraid to voice his opinion on any team or player lol people are just jealous. Butler was a good defender in 2013-2014 but last season he even admitted to being worse defensively. Analytics +/- RPM, and defensive rating show DJ is not a good defender. Davis is a great shot blocker but can still improve as a position and on-ball defender. IMO, Kawhi's got it all defensively. Oh well."
NBASpurs,3ds32s,rattatatouille,4,Sun Jul 19 00:28:20 2015 UTC,"Also, Kawhi got snubbed because he doesn't crow much about his D. Just lets his game speak for itself."
NBASpurs,3ds32s,medobule,2,Sun Jul 19 09:43:13 2015 UTC,Agree 100%
NBASpurs,3ds32s,andrewcortex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:34 2015 UTC,...or players offer a legitimate point of view separate from our own. Could be that the point of the players having their own awards is to offer their own take and not to just have a popularity contest.
NBASpurs,3ds32s,dragonbutterfly89,2,Sun Jul 19 12:09:08 2015 UTC,"I  think this just shows that players' vote is no less shallow than the media's. Did Kawhi get left off because he is not popular amongst a majority of the players? Did Green, as well,or did they not appreciate his arrogance? Either way this award is not being given solely based on merit. The media has not always given an award unbiasedly, so we should not expect the players to do so either."
NBASpurs,3ds32s,TeamworkDreamwork,3,Sun Jul 19 12:20:24 2015 UTC,"You could also say that a players' awards is a popularity contest though? it's like voting for a high school prom king and queen except for basketball players lol at least the media voters use stats, off court and on court impact throughout the whole season. They watch a player's progress or lack of it from the beginning of the season until the playoffs more objectively than a player does. I remember reading about players admitting that they don't watch film of their competitors and only judge what they see when they play each other twice a year or more. Rick Barry was interviewed recently and he said players shouldn't vote for each other because ""they get mad at each other and don't like guys.""

Apparently people place heavy emphasis on All-Star appearances when determining a player's worth or legacy, but that is just a popularity contest for the fans and does little to explain player value.

NBASpurs,3dq5ig,Panthjit2,41,Sat Jul 18 10:44:16 2015 UTC,"I'm really not that afraid of the Warriors because we have the best perimeter defense with Kawhi and Danny. That's why I was so worried Danny would leave. Them guarding Steph and Klay negates their ability to go small. To counter their small line up, you can go Tony, Danny, Kawhi, Boris and LMA and then just make them pay every single time on the defensive end. Kerr will have to react if they can't make shots and we have automatic offense by giving it to LMA in the low post IMO"
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,casasolafuego,5,Sat Jul 18 11:56:55 2015 UTC,"Man I want to see Kawhi mug up on Steph again, that shit was brilliant in the regular season."
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,MidnightRofl,2,Sun Jul 19 05:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yes! But my thought is they'll play him on Klay and let Danny take Steph. Based on how we defended the clips, this is all speculation, but Kawhi seems better used as a sort of ""free safety"" who PGs have to keep a constant eye on when passing. Because of his length and quickness, kawhi is almost like a constant double team lingering around outside your peripherals. And if Steph gets hot then we just sic Kawhi on him and it's a lock."
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,Hotdamncoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:31 2015 UTC,"You have a good point, after all Danny is swift and an anti-fastbreak kinda guy who definitely is gonna be pinned against Klay and Curry, to also avoid giving Dub's opening for any uncontested shots."

NBASpurs,3dq5ig,MidnightRofl,11,Sun Jul 19 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"The Warriors are the biggest threat because of their excellent 3-point shooting & defense. There is a reason why they were #1 in both categories last season. Even with Kawhi & Danny, Curry and Thompson can look unguardable at times (I mean they aren't called the best backcourt in history for nothing). Plus they still have Iggy, Barnes and Green. Bogut didn't even play the last three games in the finals b/c Kerr just loves small ball lol. What worries me is Tony Parker. If he isn't 100% healthy they struggle at times. I noticed they ran offense thru Diaw when Parker was injured. Hopefully the Spurs can run some more offense through Kawhi and Aldridge next season. It will be interesting to watch now that West, McCallum and Anderson will get playing time together. I like the bench because it takes the pressure off Manu and Mills who is still rehabbing from his shoulder injury I heard. Popovich will have to figure out something about countering the Warriors' small ball attack with Aldridge at the 5 and Leonard at 4. Spurs still need another wing scorer and defender. Hope they can sign another young prospect. Imo, clippers are arrogant. Heard Griffin recently say that they aren't afraid of the Spurs anymore b/c they proved they are better after beating them in the 1st rd. Well, this Spurs team is new and improved."

NBASpurs,3dq5ig,AristotleStatus,2,Sat Jul 18 20:23:20 2015 UTC,But some people were saying he'll just go to training camp like what happened with Bryce Cotton?
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,InstinctBlu3s,3,Sat Jul 18 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"He has a 2 year contract, 1st year guaranteed."
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,AristotleStatus,3,Sun Jul 19 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"The fun thing about this spurs team is that we have dominate enough big men to destroy small ball teams. Like good luck having Barnes defend LMA at PF its not gonna happen. So the we drag them in to ""bigball"" and our team is way better then them at that."
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,DoriaTheExploria,3,Sat Jul 18 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"Small ball only REALLY works when the opposing team has incompetent bigs. For example, late in the Memphis series for GS they would always go small (Draymond as the biggest man) and they would put Draymond on Zbo, leaving Barnes on Gasol. Well, turns out Gasol is softer than charmin and can't beat up a skinny 6'7 swingman. If you replace Zbo and Gasol with Duncan and Aldridge it really puts the Warriors in a hole if they want to run a small lineup. However, a Spurs/Warriors series would be really fascinating because they may possibly have the best defensive duo in basketball with Draymond/Bogut, against at least a top 2 offensive tandem in Duncan/Aldridge.  I'm honestly not sure if anything I just said made sense out loud, but it's whatever lol."

NBASpurs,3dq5ig,bigPUNnbigFUN,3,Sat Jul 18 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"Aldridge is actually better for SA than Splitter when it comes to GSW. Aldridge is one of the best PF at switching (which is insane because as you stated he's also one of the largest PF)  He'll be able to switch onto GSW's smaller players and be able to space on offense if we want to go small with Boris and Kawhi doing more work around the post, which will allow him to get back on defense faster since he'd be our only rim protection.  He won't be as good on defense as Tiago, but he's probably a better rebounder and he'd be able to compliment the offense much better.  Completely usesless for me to say this, but if we could've somehow kept Tiago, SA becomes immediate champ favorites. Tiago would've fit perfectly next to LMA and already played extremely well with BoBo."
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,Golai77,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:44:47 2015 UTC,"While LMA's nimble feet are impressive for a man his size, the younger much more athletic Tristan Thompson got absolutely abused by Curry. He MIGHT hold his own against Klay for a possession or two, and Barnes isn't a focal point offensively so I think he could stay with him for a while."
NBASpurs,3dq5ig,WePrezidentNow,3,Sat Jul 18 19:05:18 2015 UTC,Duncan/LMA/Boris/Dwest are all extremely versatile bigmen offensively. They are going to be a nightmare to guard for opposing teams. They also provide spacing that wasn't there when Tiago/Timmy were together. That's going to be huge for Danny/Kawhi/TP.

NBASpurs,3dq5ig,tvfilm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:53 2015 UTC,Honestly I still think the Clippers are still our worst overall matchup. Having Tony and Tiago hurt in the playoffs really made that worse but we still have no match for the athleticism of their bigs. They will have tremendous trouble guarding our front court but we still can't consistently guard theirs. Especially if hack a deandre is addressed with a rule change. If Lance Stephenson plays to his potential they're even more dangerous.

Back in 2011 year when he played in Zalgiris (Kaunas, Lithuania) he was really awful: bad rebounder, awful speed and etc. We called him a tree because he could just stand in place with his arms up.  But the progress this guy made over 4 years is tremendous. He made a big progress in his game though he still lacks speed. He couldn't play in fast lineup for sure.

NBASpurs,3donlc,primalwhite,4,Sat Jul 18 00:41:46 2015 UTC,I feel like he'll rack up quite a few DNPs along with that 10 MPG usage in games he does play (could be lower if he makes cameo appearances to foul). His usage will mostly come if Duncan or one of the other bigs are resting. Hard to get a consistent 5 man big rotation and I can't see him leapfrogging any of the 4 above him.

NBASpurs,3dlomt,ird6,9,Fri Jul 17 07:38:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think he can succeed without drawing fouls. Luckily he seems to be very weird to play against and very good at drawing them. I do think it's going to take him time to earn the respect of the refs though.   Defense is a bigger concern but he looks way, way better than he did last year. Still not where it needs to be but it's a reassuring improvement."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,servernode,2,Fri Jul 17 08:37:14 2015 UTC,"When he is playing against more conservative defenders who do not have 10 fouls to give, I don't think he will be getting fouled at the same rate as he is in these summer league games."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,andrewcortex,15,Fri Jul 17 11:24:32 2015 UTC,Next big thing as in useful role player? Yes.
NBASpurs,3dlomt,Homesteadrunner,2,Fri Jul 17 16:35:53 2015 UTC,And I would add that I think being a serviceable role player is his ceiling. I WANT him to do well but I just don't see it happening...
NBASpurs,3dlomt,BeerMeBooze,2,Fri Jul 17 12:51:08 2015 UTC,"""serviceable role player"" is all I want out of him. His ball handling and passing are good enough that I could see him as a leader off the bench, but if he can't improve his three point percentage it's hard seeing him be successful even in that role. There's one thing every successful team asks out of backup wings now and that's floor spacing. Caught him shooting on the way down a couple of times in SL and that's not good."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,diffeqmaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think his ceiling will depend on his ability to reliably knock down the 3. He's a good passer and seems to see the floor pretty well. He's a high IQ player. Right now, I think he's a serviceable role player. I think if he can help space the floor with his shooting then he'll be upgraded to solid role player."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,Trancefam,19,Fri Jul 17 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"A lot is made of his slow foot speed but I think calling him ""unathletic"" isn't giving him enough credit. He is long, has good hands, his lower body seems to be strong enough to backdown smaller defenders. His coordination and centre of balance is very high, which is why he can always get fouled on his fade always in the high post. He is a half step slow with on-ball defense but he often seems to maneuver himself back to the players hip and force a contested shot or get a hand in passing lanes.   To me, his biggest problem is that he just can't seem to convert on open threes or contested layups/jumpers. If he can convert enough to make defenses have to respect him then he could be work well at the NBA level.   He was also being used offball a lot while trying to learn the system. That is a very different roll than anything he's had to do in HS or college where he played point."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,andrewcortex,12,Sat Jul 18 08:18:56 2015 UTC,"I want him to succeed because he's got a quirky game that i like, but to be successful when you're that slow you're gonna have to be able to consistently hit contested shots. Luckily he's got plenty of skills and maybe SL will help him fine tune things."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,WePrezidentNow,6,Fri Jul 17 10:50:54 2015 UTC,"He's actually finished through contact pretty well this summer. Obviously he needs to continue to improve in that aspect, but I do think he's gained some strength in the last year."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,Golai77,4,Fri Jul 17 12:26:28 2015 UTC,"he needs to refine his jumper to really be effective. His length allows him to get off midrange jumpers off his own dribble over a defender, but he does not make them consistently. He also does not shoot the 3 ball well. Bring both of those shots along and he will be effective on offense."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,Cecil_Hardboner,5,Fri Jul 17 15:38:43 2015 UTC,Paging Chip Engelland...
NBASpurs,3dlomt,Starsy,3,Fri Jul 17 14:07:57 2015 UTC,His shooting numbers in summer league are pretty bad. I'd love to see him succeed but I still have doubts.
NBASpurs,3dlomt,ProjectGSX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"His %'s may not look fancy but when you see him dictate a game , it's pretty good. He completely took over the D-league last season, I think it's a matter of getting his body to sync with his court vision. Once he can do that, I have a feeling that we would have a very strong piece for the future."
NBASpurs,3dlomt,Pale_Grey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:54 2015 UTC,his defense is not that great. He is a bit too slow to really lock down any player

NBASpurs,3dlomt,macbeth_htebcam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:31:50 2015 UTC,I think he can be a great role player for us...but he has a lot he needs to work on. Some of those shots he's making in the summer league won't be there for him during the regular season...same with the fouls he's getting. needs to make quicker decisions on the offensive end and needs to work on his defense.

I think a hefy chunk of it is on TP , hoping that he keeps his health steady through the Playoffs."

NBASpurs,3dlyme,ChaoticAeon,5,Fri Jul 17 16:32:37 2015 UTC,I am going to be a bit more realistic and say 58-60 wins. We have quite a few new pieces and they will take time to gel + with Tony and Kawhi the potential is always there for injury.
NBASpurs,3dlyme,dragonbutterfly89,4,Fri Jul 17 11:13:32 2015 UTC,"this is my answer. i think integrating LMA into the offense will take some time and we'll start a bit slow (so nothing new, basically) and finish out the season on a 45 game win streak."
NBASpurs,3dlyme,WePrezidentNow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"That would be my prediction, too: 58-60. Although it seems slightly pessimistic. 2013-2014, we won 62 (and 63 in 05-06). I don't want to get too hyped, so I'll agree with 58-60."
NBASpurs,3dlyme,lowcontextculture,6,Fri Jul 17 14:35:21 2015 UTC,"We'll win the Stanley Cup, too."
NBASpurs,3dlyme,lowcontextculture,3,Fri Jul 17 14:31:59 2015 UTC,64 wins
NBASpurs,3dlyme,Discord_Show,3,Fri Jul 17 10:50:24 2015 UTC,"58-24. It'll be a slow start by Spurs standards since they'll need time to develop some chemistry and get everyone into a rhythm, particularly McCollum, LMA, and West. I'd be very surprised if they came out of the gate firing on all cylinders. Historically, Spurs gradually progress as the season reaches the mid point and then turn it on during the famous Rodeo Road Trip.   There's also still a question mark surrounding how Manu will perform the first few weeks of the season.   Personally, I'd much rather they get off to a slower start then hit their stride going into March and continuing it as playoffs start. I think there's always a danger of hitting your peak too soon and then tapering off a bit."
NBASpurs,3dlyme,Trancefam,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:41 2015 UTC,We'll probably start a little slow and ramp it up in March/April like we always do.
NBASpurs,3dlyme,CorporateKnowledge,2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"Given that last year we managed 55 wins with Leonard being injured at the start of the year and one of our worst Rodeo Trip performances, I don't see why we wouldn't reach 60. I think it's going to come down to how much rest Duncan-Parker-Ginobili need on road trips (which seems to be a lot). I think our 2013-2014 (62 Ws) is a good benchmark."

I think between the new guys needing to find their groove and the rest we will be giving to everyone to make sure they stay healthy 60 is the best we can do and 55 is the worst.

NBASpurs,3dl7br,lGoSpursGol,10,Fri Jul 17 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"Mainly its in Pop We Trust. One of the reason the Spurs moved him wasn't only his lack of fit in the system, but because he was complaining publicly and vocally about not receiving more playing time over Tiago."
NBASpurs,3dl7br,weeman2525,8,Fri Jul 17 19:10:47 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, did some googling, and he indeed did come off as a cry baby taking a lot of shots at the team when he left. Shame he couldn't accept his role, which is probably as good as it's gonna get for him in the NBA."

I wouldn't really mind having him on the team if he was effective, but I just don't feel like he would be at this point. The last time we saw him, he was ancient. His defense was nonexistent. We don't even know how his conditioning is at this point or whether he even wants to return to NBA.   His role on the Spurs would be specialist that only comes on to shoot 3s/space it (kind of like Steve Kerr back in the day). But when would he get minutes? Maybe if the Spurs go small and put Kawhi at the PF with Green at SF for end of game possessions? Even then we could slot Mills at the SG or something. Green is pretty good as a shooter and more versatile if it comes down to Green vs Allen. Honestly, I'd rather have the roster spot to leave to a more versatile vet wing or a project."

You don't stay at that level of shooting for that long without pure discipline. If he wanted another ring I have no doubt he could get back in shape and be a perfect guy to come in off the bench and stretch the defense. Will he come to SA? I'd like to dream but I doubt it :(
NBASpurs,3dox0o,Professorgatsby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:53 2015 UTC,I don't think Ray Allen will ever join the spurs. 2013 was too painful for spurs fans. Plus it looks like he will retire.

NBASpurs,3dk6el,Golai77,16,Thu Jul 16 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"LMA in a vacuum is a worse defender than Tiago, but he's better than Baynes, Diaw, Bonner, Ayres, etc.  Since Tiago couldn't be on the floor with Duncan for too long (against most lineups) due to spacing, overall I think our defense could improve due to the LMA/Duncan combo getting more time together per game than the Tiago/Duncan lineup.  Tiago was great for coming in when Timmy went out though, but West is a better defender than Baynes/Ayres, so maybe in the end our bench D will be about the same."
NBASpurs,3dk6el,wild_thingy,6,Thu Jul 16 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"I have also read that people around the league think LMA is a better defender than we have seen yet. Apparently he was just never truly pushed to defend, but most think he can breakout defensively under Pop."
NBASpurs,3dk6el,Parrallax91,3,Fri Jul 17 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"With less offensive responsibility, Aldridge can focus more on D."
NBASpurs,3dk6el,Cogency,10,Fri Jul 17 04:50:40 2015 UTC,"No doubt losing Tiago is going to be huge.  But I think we can reintroduce a few of the old twin towers defensive schemes that required two good shot blockers to work really effectively.   So that might be a net positive.   West might be a huge improvement for our 2nd-3rd string unit.  We haven't had this good of a defender come off the bench since maybe ever.   The second string might actually be better defensively than the starters if you keep khawhi on the floor.   Tony hopefully is in better shape this year to actually play some defense which is the biggest improvement we could theoretically make.   He's never been the best defender but he was never as bad as he was last year.    All in all I don't see the defense improving that much.   Green, Khawhi,  West,  and Duncan will be our best defenders."
NBASpurs,3dk6el,WePrezidentNow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:05:03 2015 UTC,So how do we go about handling Tony on defense if he's more or less the same? I cringed when we faced elite PGs last year because I knew they were gonna have a field day if he guarded them for any stretch of the game. IMO Danny is too slow footed for most PGs and Kawhi might be needed elsewhere. I guess the plan is to just deal with it and hope for good rotations?
NBASpurs,3dk6el,ChaoticAeon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:33:28 2015 UTC,"Let's just turn him into a shooter and have Patty start, lol. I know that sounds pretty stupid. But shooting/scoring seem to be his strengths, and maybe playing effectively with Tim. But maybe Patty will be ready to roll this year, and I am super excited for Mccallum. He looks to a be a great player and fit all around."
NBASpurs,3dk6el,HutSmut,2,Fri Jul 17 23:34:46 2015 UTC,In addition to what has been stated already.  Our half court defense is a lot better than our fast break defense.  LMA will convert more baskets and score a lot more than Tiago was capable of.
NBASpurs,3dk6el,ChaoticAeon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am hoping that really makes it easier on the starting 5. Less effort having to be expended each possession."

He doesn't need to be the most physically gifted guy out there, he knows his game, and he's a very smart player, so I think he has a good chance at succeeding in this system.

Under normal circumstances I would say they have a very slim chance of having a contributing role based off Summer League performance, but the Spurs' depth issues might give reason enough to think they might have a legit shot this season.   Anderson doesn't need to slash or do anything spectacular that requires speed. He's a high IQ player, so I'm sure Pop can use him this season.   I like what I've seen from the Spurs SL team.

NBASpurs,3disgm,SharpsExposure,20,Thu Jul 16 23:37:14 2015 UTC,Spurs were hated From 2003-2008ish because of the low pace/boring game + Ginobili's exaggerated movements/flopping (the original James Harden).   The team that ran from 2012-2015 became so beloved because of the passing and camaraderie people saw. It was a team playing basketball the right way for the first time in decades (80's Lakers were probably last one to play that way successfully).  We'll have to see how this team shakes out with so many new faces. David West will definitely become a primary target to be disliked by opposing fan bases but even then I think Spurs will be widely liked/watched by non-Spurs fans.  Clippers are for sure the bad guys this year.

Guy made it to the ASG off the bench as the third scorer which is nuts.  Harden's career would have probably taken a similar route had he stayed with OKC and he'd probably have a championship to show for it by now.
NBASpurs,3disgm,wild_thingy,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:49 2015 UTC,I'm excited about West. Minus 2014 all of our championship teams had that gritty tough guy that would just get under the other teams skin and push our guys when we were down.   I think he is going to be a great fit.
NBASpurs,3disgm,lowcontextculture,13,Fri Jul 17 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"I've noticed it, too, a bit. This is all I see."
NBASpurs,3disgm,Addicted_Runner,11,Thu Jul 16 19:05:42 2015 UTC,"We've been seen as this bad guy before. I believe it was after we won the '07 championship. I have a printed out comic strip from back then, I'll find it and post it sometime this weekend. Very funny.   It's just that other organizations don't have the type of consistent success that the Spurs have."
NBASpurs,3disgm,rattatatouille,12,Thu Jul 16 18:48:38 2015 UTC,Mostly because Suns fans will never stop being salty about it.
NBASpurs,3disgm,tvfilm,7,Thu Jul 16 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"In Vegas summer league, a lot of fans from various teams are here, 95% here have mostly respect for what the Spurs have done. I think behind a keyboard it might be different but in person for the most part, many I have talked to, are in awe of the Spurs. This is, of course, not a scientific study, just personal observations here."
NBASpurs,3disgm,Jelal,3,Thu Jul 16 18:38:21 2015 UTC,the other 5% were suns fans?
NBASpurs,3disgm,tvfilm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"Haha, bad use of percentages I know. Haha. I talked to a lot of peeps, when I said spurs, majority were just glowing about the spurs moves, even players I talked to.   The one guy that was pretty cool was Mudiay, he was very approachable and mingling with us. Wish him the best."
NBASpurs,3disgm,D_Hall,7,Fri Jul 17 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"The Spurs are, always have been, and always will be the 'good guys'.  Anyone who says differently is a 'bad guy'."
NBASpurs,3disgm,RichardLOD,3,Thu Jul 16 22:22:44 2015 UTC,The rest of the league is like Anakin at the end of episode III.  From their point of view the Spurs are evil.
NBASpurs,3disgm,thatsafoulbro,6,Thu Jul 16 23:29:54 2015 UTC,don't care I hate every other team
NBASpurs,3disgm,jewzaseven2,6,Thu Jul 16 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Warriors fan just coming here to say that we still love you guys <3 Also, stop with the acquiring good players. The NBA is already kill."
NBASpurs,3disgm,SeveralPeople,2,Thu Jul 16 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"We need a backup shooting guard. Can we have Mo Speights, please?"
NBASpurs,3disgm,topset_21,4,Sat Jul 18 04:07:36 2015 UTC,I have never cared about what other team's fans thought and I still don't. They use to call us boring. They said Bowen was dirty. They claimed Manu was just a flopper. It was always wrong and I don't care what they think now.
NBASpurs,3disgm,RichardLOD,2,Thu Jul 16 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"The only thing people said that really bothered me was what they said about our first 2 championships.  ""1999 has an asterisk"" because Shaq opened his big fat mouth.  ""2003 is the least talented team to ever win an NBA tittle"" even though there were 5 lock Hall of Famers on that team (arguably more).  We had to win 3 championships before people started to think maybe we were just really good."
NBASpurs,3disgm,WePrezidentNow,2,Thu Jul 16 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly 2003 is just a testament to how fucking good Timmy is. David was on the way out, TP and Manu were still developing, Bowen was already all defense at that point, but he was still a year or two from becoming the legendary defender we remember him as. Talent wise, it's the least talented CHAMPIONSHIP team in the Duncan era, but he was so good it didn't matter.  Duncan and the entire organization being underrated isn't exclusive to the early championships though. Every year you hear about how the 'Spurs are done' despite putting up 50+ wins for damn near two decades. Every year father time will finally catch up to Tim. It's a tired argument, but at least 2014 showed the world that we're ALWAYS in it."
NBASpurs,3disgm,thegeekprophet,2,Fri Jul 17 12:19:55 2015 UTC,"IF people hate the Spurs it's not because of who we got, it's because of consistency/and we are just that good.  Remember the Jazz when they were good?  They had our number and would knock us out in the playoffs every time. I hated them.  It wasn't until years later that I realized it was because they were just that good."
NBASpurs,3disgm,cinereoargenteus,2,Fri Jul 17 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"Don't care.   I used to get really sad when someone would say something ugly about my Spurs.   But then I realized that we're like the Colts (with more success and less evil owner).  First Manning then one bad year and they get luck?   And did you see the FA's they picked up this year?   (Dre, how could you? )  And the fans are so smug and entitled.   Like it's just a given they're going to win the division. Like Houston could never be a serious threat.  Spoiled, assholes.  Seriously,  Fuck those colts.     So, yeah,  I can understand how we're the bad guys."

NBASpurs,3dfac3,Starsy,18,Wed Jul 15 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, and I'd rather have LeBron than Bonner, too. Bonner comes for the vet minimum, 1/4th the price of Baynes and 1/6th the price of Splitter.  Honestly, there's no better player we could get for the vet minimum. Good shooter, knows the system. For vet min, that's all we can ask for."
NBASpurs,3dfac3,rattatatouille,8,Wed Jul 15 21:25:37 2015 UTC,Great locker room guy and makes few mistakes too.
NBASpurs,3dfac3,Starsy,5,Thu Jul 16 01:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, basically. He's a great guy to have because when someone gets injured -- and you know someone will -- you can put him out there and know he won't lose any games for you. He might not win any for you, but he won't lose them either, and for a guy that's effectively our #5 big, that's quite a luxury."
NBASpurs,3dfac3,mogwai316,15,Thu Jul 16 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"Baynes got almost $7M/yr from Detroit, and Splitter is around $8-9M/yr.  Bonner is way way cheaper than that.  You can't really compare them directly."

NBASpurs,3dh8ft,servernode,10,Thu Jul 16 07:26:05 2015 UTC,The latest time (for at least 5-6 years) he didn't compete for France during the offseason (last summer) was his worst season for 4-5 years. I can see him improve next year with the European Championship

NBASpurs,3dh8ft,yamaha2k11,8,Fri Jul 17 02:32:58 2015 UTC,RC Buford said on xm nba radio that tony plays better if he plays international ball before training camp. Seems like management endorses his summer play.
NBASpurs,3dh8ft,tvfilm,6,Thu Jul 16 14:35:15 2015 UTC,Maybe it's offset by us getting knocked out early. It's not like we went to the finals again and THEN he goes overseas for more b-ball. Just...be careful Tony.
NBASpurs,3dh8ft,RnJSnoZero,2,Thu Jul 16 11:42:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I think he just needs to work on himself and try to get better from this past year he said in an article he needed to work on his body and be healthier...maybe him competing in international ball is that.
NBASpurs,3dh8ft,SquandasNutCheese,3,Thu Jul 16 14:55:05 2015 UTC,He had the summer off last week and came into the season out of shape and had a terrible year. I'm glad he's playing for France. And the season doesn't hinge on TP's health anymore than it does for about 5-6 other guys on the team.

NBASpurs,3dbf3e,Go0n,54,Tue Jul 14 23:36:57 2015 UTC,"What about your own free agency? How did that go down?   Green: “We talked on the phone up until the date. Pop told me to let them know what was happening (with other teams), what was going on before I make any decisions. I told him I would, and we kept in contact. Detroit came in and Toronto came in, and I told Pop. They (the Spurs) told me they might have some space. They’re not to to be able to give what other guys are going to offer, but they could come close. I said if you guys can get close, I’m coming back. It’s simple as that.”  “He said, ‘Alright we’re going to make the moves we need to make and try to make space and bring you back.’ And they did it. It got done so quickly, I didn’t have to go through the whole frenzy. It was easy to me.”   Why were you so willing to stay in San Antonio for less money that other wings got elsewhere?   Green: “Because I thought we had a good shot at getting LaMarcus. San Antonio is home for me. I know the system and the organization. It’s an easy way of life. Anywhere else, you don’t get the same weather, the same type of fans and people. It was a situation where I was willing to come back for less.”   How seriously did you look at other teams?   Green: “I was supposed to have a meeting with (Detroit’s Stan) Van Gundy, but that got cancelled because it happened so fast. I didn’t get a chance to talk to many people.”"

We developed the best young 3&D guy in the NBA and managed to sign him to a 4y/45mm deal that will be an amazing value as the cap rises.  V3RDE!!!
NBASpurs,3db7bb,Go0n,8,Tue Jul 14 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"The more I think about our offseason, the more I think keeping him (especially at that price) was basically just as important as getting LMA.

NBASpurs,3db7bb,BabyS1othWithA1,3,Tue Jul 14 23:24:20 2015 UTC,It's insane how much money Danny turned down to stay with the Spurs. Wes Matthews got 70mil coming off an achilles tear. I'd easily rather give Danny that then somebody coming off the worst injury in basketball. DG effectively turn own an extra 25 mil to keep playing for rings. Just.....wow. I hope he has a long awesome career.
NBASpurs,3dctth,schizophrenicpanic,15,Wed Jul 15 07:10:00 2015 UTC,You put a small ball lineup in and try and defend the post up carnage that will be Aldridge and Duncan plus Kawhi's post up game was pretty sweet too
NBASpurs,3dctth,NoSuchManAsJezz,3,Wed Jul 15 08:56:17 2015 UTC,"And aldridge I believe can cover a small ball 4, so we shouldn't be sacrificing much in the way of defense."
NBASpurs,3dctth,piratecalvin,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:01 2015 UTC,"One of the highlights of his defense is his ability to switch. He's probably not going to be as good as Tiago on D, but he'll be close and his offense compliments Tim's, unlike Tiago's."
NBASpurs,3dctth,Golai77,2,Wed Jul 15 23:39:02 2015 UTC,yea small ball only works when the other team has big men in foul trouble in the late 3rd quarter.

NBASpurs,3dctth,big_fig,2,Wed Jul 15 17:06:32 2015 UTC,"It's just intriguing me, we have signed Aldridge and West recently. And Matt Bonner possibly staying? That counts to about 9 or 10 Big Men. Any thoughts on this? What seems to be the move here for the spurs? I certainly don't want to see Diaw go, killed me enough when Splitter was traded - always thought he was a good Duncan cover."
NBASpurs,3dctth,MRTsmash,6,Wed Jul 15 07:13:29 2015 UTC,"well, technically, it won't be 9 or 10 big men when the regular season starts. Milutinov is not coming over to the States for at least this upcoming season, and Lalanne could get sent overseas to develop, but we'll see. Ayres is more than likely not coming back. Bonner is getting interest from Sacramento, but I'm guessing Pop and R.C. would like to have him back. if he does come back, I'm counting 6 bigs on the team: Duncan, Aldridge, West, Diaw, Boban Marjanovic, and Bonner. I'm fine with having 6 bigs, considering West and Diaw are 6'9"" and 6'8"", respectively."
NBASpurs,3dctth,NoSuchManAsJezz,3,Wed Jul 15 07:49:32 2015 UTC,And Diaw can quite easily play oversized shooting guard. Pretty sure he was sg at phoenix (although more slender)  when he won 6th man  Edit. And by 6th man I meant MIP
NBASpurs,3dctth,andrewcortex,2,Wed Jul 15 08:58:31 2015 UTC,"Part of me thinks they are trying to groom Anderson to play point offensively. I think it's his most productive position. If he proves good enough for some regular minutes he could play point offensively, and then put on the least threatening wing on D. With Leonard and Green D'ing up the more ball dominate backcourt players, Anderson's length could make him useful offball defender.   Not sure if this is how it will all work out, but based on his skill, the roster and how Anderson was used in Summer League; it might be their thought process."
NBASpurs,3dctth,NoSuchManAsJezz,2,Wed Jul 15 11:40:14 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. I guess we will wait and see how Simmons and macallum are used. A lot of people can't seem to believe Simmons was stuck in the d league for so long and are assuming he is just a shit locker room guy. So not sure what the spurs were doing with that pick up either
NBASpurs,3dctth,WD51,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:45:57 2015 UTC,"Diaw isn't guarding any shooting guards. He played SG in Phoenix a decade ago, but he was slim back then. He no longer has the foot speed to keep up with most SFs, let alone SGs."
NBASpurs,3dctth,Shiztastic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:52:59 2015 UTC,"Ohh I see, 6 bigs would be perfect. I didn't know much about the new guys not actually making it to the roster, was just judging it on the roster list and active free agent talks. Come to think about it, Duncan, Aldridge, West, Diaw, Marjanovic is a good front court lineup. It ain't really that big as well, Marjanovic is the only TRUE Center, maybe Timmy to an extent but he'll always be a PF to me."

NBASpurs,3dctth,TeamworkDreamwork,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"The Spurs do need another three point shooter. Belinelli didn't play alot of minutes but he did knock down some timely threes when they needed him to. Hopefully they find a sharpshooter from Europe? Seems like alot of teams are trying to find the next curry or klay thompson, look at this year's draft, devin booker and RJ Hunter are considered the best shooters and are being compared to Klay."
NBASpurs,3dctth,Cefkovod,2,Wed Jul 15 19:32:16 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about that! We do need one or a couple of guys who can knock down shots or a guy that could create shots, drive or slash much like Manu coz let's face it, he hasn't been that effective recently and that's understandable.  This guy, Scottie Wilbekin is making waves at the summer league. 13 3pts made in 3 games, good quick release, can catch and shoot or dribble and shoot. I was watching his game earlier he made 6 threes and I immediately thought ""Boy, would he fit into the Spurs"".  Devin Booker's shot is a bit wonky though, it's not quick enough or smooth enough of a release - needs a lot of polishing. Haven't seen RJ Hunter yet."
NBASpurs,3dctth,MMAandCoffee1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"RJ Hunter looks good so far. He has a nice shooting form. Celtics are lucky they drafted him.

NBASpurs,3db80g,camtire,12,Tue Jul 14 22:42:06 2015 UTC,He signed that at the summer league I think. Saw him and Buford walking out a suite at the Thomas and Mack center here at the summer league. I could be wrong. I'm not WOJ! haha
NBASpurs,3db80g,tvfilm,3,Tue Jul 14 22:46:31 2015 UTC,I wonder if other spurs players will go to Vegas to sign their contracts.

NBASpurs,3db80g,tvfilm,4,Wed Jul 15 08:53:58 2015 UTC,"That looks like they use regular printer paper.  Like Peter Holt had the contract file on his laptop and just clicked 'print'.

I had the same thought last year when the possibility of the Kings coming to Seattle was being talked about. I was really bummed when it didn't come to fruition. I may have to make a trip to Portland this year whenever the Spurs come to town.
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,Ryham,22,Tue Jul 14 16:04:46 2015 UTC,i'm 99% sure patty is staying. He's under contract and was part of the pitch to Aldridge. I don't think LMA would be too happy if the Spurs just traded Mills away. Plus he's a huge part of our bench.
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,_SPORKS_,17,Tue Jul 14 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"in one of the interviews Aldridge said he was looking forward to playing with Patty the most out of anyone (outside of Duncan). so yea, it's probably something they've talked about already because otherwise i don't think he'd say something like that."
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,Niyari,11,Tue Jul 14 17:24:38 2015 UTC,Patty is 100% staying
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,Sweatycocks,11,Tue Jul 14 16:19:03 2015 UTC,With the salary cap at 70mil instead of 67mil (as initially thought) we can afford to keep Patty.
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,FrenchQuaker,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:38 2015 UTC,How does it work that the cap increased to 70 from 67 but Kawhi and LMA get more $$ because they are max deals? Super pumped to have Patty back
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,yamaha2k11,7,Tue Jul 14 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"They will earn more money, but will take the same percentage of the cap, but since nobody else's contract will go up, so there will be extra cap space for us, but I don't know exactly how much. Probably around an extra million.  I could be wrong though."
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,lowcontextculture,6,Tue Jul 14 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's because you can re-sign existing players on the team (essentially one or more of a group of ""Bird"" Exemptions, that come with their own set of regulations/rules) without those salary amounts counting against the team cap, but only if the re-signing players meet certain criteria (that varies). I'm on mobile, or else I'd look up Spurs-specific and Mills numbers, but my best bet is some maneuvering of these exemptions plus maybe paying luxury tax."

NBASpurs,3d9mgp,wild_thingy,11,Wed Jul 15 01:17:51 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken Patty was already under contract for this year at 3.2 million dollars. He was never a free agent this year according to the links I have seen.  http://hoopshype.com/salaries/san_antonio_spurs/  Edit: Patty signed a 3 year/ 13 million dollar contract with us in 2014-2015. He was going nowhere unless we traded him which may have been where some of the confusion came from in regards if he was going to be a Spur. We had to unload money for Aldridge and did that by moving Tiago.   Edit 2: I am a dummy and didn't realize you were talking about him being traded. Carry on.
NBASpurs,3d9mgp,amp112,3,Tue Jul 14 17:10:39 2015 UTC,Patty was part of the sales team that met with LMA and when LMA was asked which Spur he looks forward to playing the most he said Patty. For sure staying.

NBASpurs,3da99u,CorporateKnowledge,18,Tue Jul 14 18:41:20 2015 UTC,Zone isn't really viable as a primary defense in the NBA.  Duncan will guard centers. Diaw will guard centers. West will guard centers. The Mountain will guard centers. And Aldridge will suck it up and guard centers too.

I've only sat on the floor once...we lost to Boston and this was maybe 3 or 4 years ago?...anyway its incredible, the game is so much faster and rough (i saw a player get a technical for celebrating in a refs face and it was like a choreographed action scene or something), would love to do it again but yeah its pricey.  Our routine is to get upper level midweek tickets vs a lower ranked team off stubhub (they usually run anywhere from 4 to 12 bucks lol, only time we paid more than that was to get a bunch in a row), pregame with the boombox in the parking lot, mosey on down the lot to the att, relax up top watching the game and chatting. After the game we play frisbee in the parking lot til the line to exit goes down. We make our way to our usual dive bar haunts nearby afterward. Might sound a bit too chill for someone who's never been before and wants the spectacle but our little song and dance has been fine tuned over the years, haha. Can't say that we'll be sitting on the floor anytime soon but hey if you want to join in feel free to pm me.

NBASpurs,3d6xlc,MRTsmash,3,Tue Jul 14 00:51:24 2015 UTC,"All signs point to him not returning, the spurs acted quickly with everybody else, and are now looking closely at other free agents. Realistically they only have one spot left on the team...they like to keep the 15th spot open. No I Don't think they are giving Bonner the last spot."
NBASpurs,3d6xlc,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Tue Jul 14 04:40:11 2015 UTC,They already have 14 players signed

NBASpurs,3d4yjr,boying747,14,Mon Jul 13 15:46:26 2015 UTC,This guy looks like he will fit in perfectly with us
NBASpurs,3d4yjr,Wockett,8,Mon Jul 13 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed, seems like he has a real good head on his shoulders from what I've seen from/heard of him.   It'll be good seeing him and Patty get decent minutes with Tony probably resting more often this season due to health concerns."
NBASpurs,3d4yjr,BabyS1othWithA1,8,Mon Jul 13 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. You can tell he's the kind of guy that will thrive in the Spurs system.

NBASpurs,3d4o21,jflowers321,9,Mon Jul 13 14:34:31 2015 UTC,Golden State is the only one even close but I think DLee for Gerald Wallace was a downgrade for them.  I just need to see these new guys prove it.
NBASpurs,3d4o21,starvinmartin,6,Mon Jul 13 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"Easily. DLee still has it, but got injured early on and just fell out of their lineup. Wallace is basically a ""keep getting them checks"" type of guy at this point."
NBASpurs,3d4o21,starvinmartin,3,Mon Jul 13 14:57:27 2015 UTC,Not to mention he's exactly like half of their roster in terms of size.  Can't call Lee a true big but he was about the closest thing they had to one besides Ezeli and Bogut.  Edit: and Speights
NBASpurs,3d4o21,youukay,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"Good point! They don't really have many reliable bigs at this point. Even with the popularity of small ball, Lee had some great moments in the finals, especially considering he was barely playing this year and was definitely rusty.  Can't really believe how underrated he got. Him and just the idea of good offensive bigs that can get down low and give you easy points when you're struggling"
NBASpurs,3d4o21,doublepint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:03:52 2015 UTC,It's his rebounding they'll really miss.  I know last year wasn't great but he's made a career out of rebounding and easy offense underneath.

NBASpurs,3d4o21,Golai77,3,Mon Jul 13 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"Rasho was never that clumsy - his foot work was insanely good, and his passing was decent.  He was extremely serviceable for his role, and the only reason I think people crap on him is because he was replacing #50."
NBASpurs,3d4o21,doublepint,3,Mon Jul 13 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, not hating on Rasho.  He had a role and did it well.  But you can't deny his work with the ball in his hands wasn't exactly pretty. Or for more recent comparison when Tiago first got here he was a walking turnover/botched layup.  That obviously improved over time but it seems to be common with a lot of bigs who got their start in Europe and transition to the NBA"
NBASpurs,3d4o21,Interlake_Olympia,3,Mon Jul 13 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"Rasho's biggest issue was the pump fakes, and lack of committing to the basket.  His hands weren't as ""stoney"" as Tiago's were when he got here.  Many, crazy to think we've gone through Rasho, Fabricio and Tiago ..."
NBASpurs,3d4o21,doublepint,2,Mon Jul 13 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"Nazr, Kurt Thomas, McDyess and DeJuan too."

NBASpurs,3d4o21,HutSmut,3,Tue Jul 14 03:18:20 2015 UTC,"Be wary of assuming players are going to instantly become great because they're playing for Pop. He doesn't have a magic wand that he waves to instantly make players better. What he does do is 1) He's a great motivator, 2) He plays to players' strengths. He gets everyone on the team on the same page and to buy into the same ideas around team success. This makes players much more likely to play to their strengths in a more limited role. Which makes them more effective and appear to be better players.  I'm not saying that Spurs players don't improve more over time than with other teams (particularly with Chip on our coaching squad). But they're not going to suddenly turn a guy from being a terrible defender to suddenly stopping Lebron 1 on 1. There's a reason Marjonovic isn't a great rim protector despite being well over 7' tall. All the coaching in the world won't help his terrible vertical and slow movement. And if he couldn't block well in the Euroleague, he's gonna really have a hard time in the NBA. The best we can expect and hope for is for the Spurs to take the skill set he does have and leverage it to get the most out of him while hopefully mitigating some of his shortcomings. In time, maybe he can get a little better at some of them, but you're setting yourself up for disappointment if you're expecting that. Danny Green still can't consistently be a play maker and instigator...but he's been wildly successful here because we recognized that wasn't his wheelhouse and didn't expect it of him."
NBASpurs,3d4o21,Go0n,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"All valid points. But in fairness to Boban, he's not much slower and probably gets about as high on his jumps as Duncan who's still a great rim protector. He does it on smarts and timing. But again those are hard to teach."
NBASpurs,3d4o21,RichardLOD,2,Mon Jul 13 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"I know we're all a bit anxious, but our new guys could develop into solid role players as well. Patty, Splitter, Cojo and Danny were all unproven with lots of question marks when we first got them."

NBASpurs,3d4c9c,ProjectGSX,3,Mon Jul 13 12:31:47 2015 UTC,I see promise but Im still worried his speed will hold him back as a point guard in the NBA.
NBASpurs,3d4c9c,thepop,15,Mon Jul 13 15:51:10 2015 UTC,Well stop worrying cause he's not a point guard.
NBASpurs,3d4c9c,thematterasserted,6,Mon Jul 13 16:20:33 2015 UTC,He's projected to play at the 3 tho.
NBASpurs,3d4c9c,emeraldrumm,3,Mon Jul 13 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"He got a lot of fouls and should have made the shot on a few, but I don't think he will get nearly as many playing with the big boys. His shot hasn't gotten any quicker and his 3 ball isn't much better. He looks like his old slow self, I mean he can't really push a fast break. His handles and passing seems to have gotten better. Some improvement but I am still not sold on him getting serious playing time yet.  His 3 ball needs to be better and his ability to finish at the rim needs to improve. If he can do this 2 things then he will probably seem more playing time after Kawhi."

Stay all four years in college to eliminate your flaws, perfect your fundamentals, and develop your body. He came in ready to play and overwhelmed everyone with his maturity and skill.   The only thing that is attributed to luck is his relative great health. Yes he has had some injuries that have slowed him but none that were career threatening."
NBASpurs,3d20eh,Traderious,15,Mon Jul 13 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You can add tremendous work ethic and drive to the list as well.

NBASpurs,3d2rek,servernode,6,Mon Jul 13 01:52:16 2015 UTC,Buford says Ray McCallum will start some games like Joseph did for Parker last season. He said that they don't expect Parker to play all 82 games so this will be great just to watch his development and learn the system.
NBASpurs,3d2rek,TeamworkDreamwork,3,Mon Jul 13 02:28:30 2015 UTC,"He has a more offensive game than Joseph, so hopefully his defense can develop though he doesn't have the size."

Really this season depends on how healthy Parker is, if Ginobili can still maintain 15 mins per game, and how well LMA/West mesh with the offense. Last part will be easy me thinks. Parker, if healthy, will be in prime condition. Ginobili is biggest concern. If he doesn't step up then they need Anderson or Mills to be that scoring 6th man off the bench."

NBASpurs,3d257f,Mattsasse,8,Tue Jul 14 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely like what I've seen from Simmons and Anderson. Aside from one off game, Anderson has been very consistent in the Summer League games. Simmons has had 2 solid back to back games."
NBASpurs,3d257f,Trancefam,4,Mon Jul 13 01:57:19 2015 UTC,It was very cool to be there in person to see Becky get the first ever win as a female head coach in men's basketball history.

NBASpurs,3d1sej,TeamworkDreamwork,8,Sun Jul 12 20:46:22 2015 UTC,Ray McCallum Peaks After March
NBASpurs,3d1sej,Sweatycocks,18,Sun Jul 12 21:46:16 2015 UTC,I 100 percent agree.
NBASpurs,3d1sej,Lone_Star_122,11,Sun Jul 12 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"I personally do not. Parker is probably the 4th most important player on the team right now. If Pop continues to make it a TP-centric offense then yeah I'd agree but that'd be foolish with Aldridge coming on board and Kawhi poised to take a bigger chunk of the offensive duties. If TP is completely out then yeah, it'll be tough to win the championship. But you could say that literally about every other player on the team. I just think he doesn't have to be terrible like he was last year for the Spurs to succeed. An ""okay"" season is good enough..."
NBASpurs,3d1sej,_SPORKS_,5,Sun Jul 12 22:05:58 2015 UTC,"Second this. As long as TP can manage to run our offense and keep the ball moving, we now have more than enough offense to pick up the slack. No dribble dribble dribble this year and we will be in good shape"
NBASpurs,3d1sej,Sweatycocks,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"Tony Parker, when healthy, creates a lot of opportunities for the offense when he's able to get into the paint and cause defenses to collapse. Duncan may be the cornerstone of the franchise and Leonard / Aldridge may be the future faces of the team, but Parker is definitely one of the most important cogs in the Spurs' machine.   He's the catalyst that gets things moving effectively."
NBASpurs,3d1sej,Trancefam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"Nobody is saying otherwise. But he's not in his prime anymore, Spurs fans need to accept that. When Tony ran the show, it's because he was still the only member of the Big 3 in his prime. I still think he can be very effective and do the things that he's done in the past. But to make him the focal point of the offense when you have two guys arguably in their primes in Kawhi & LMA would not be a wise decision IMO."
NBASpurs,3d1sej,_SPORKS_,0,Mon Jul 13 02:08:11 2015 UTC,"People are saying otherwise when they say he's the 4th most important player on the team. This is the first time in a long time where we might be able to get away with individual abilities, but we can't win a championship without the system being run how Tony runs it... In my opinion ."
NBASpurs,3d1sej,MurseShark,5,Tue Jul 14 03:13:30 2015 UTC,"My hope is that Parker takes this personally and blows us all away. But I have the exact same concerns, from what i've seen of him over the last two years is a guy who can't stay healthy and is a bit slower. I really do hope he can get it back."
NBASpurs,3d1sej,macbeth_htebcam,5,Mon Jul 13 05:00:43 2015 UTC,Yes because we all know Pop is too stubborn to play a backup pg even if they're outperforming Parker. Pop rides and dies with the big 3.
NBASpurs,3d1sej,rockynante,7,Sun Jul 12 22:10:58 2015 UTC,Yup. Even other NBA analysts were asking during the playoffs why Parker played more minutes than Mills when he was clearly hobbled with injuries.
NBASpurs,3d1sej,thinktwice84,2,Mon Jul 13 01:15:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe with some help from the coaching staff, McCallum could really start to make a big impact and keep growing. His personality really fits well with the spurs system, so hopefully he'll be able to pick up on that and really thrive. If that's the case and he can be consistent (which I really can't say about Mills), the possibility of Pop easing TP's transition over the next few years is very real. He's stubborn, but change will happen in the next 2-3 years and I'm curious how he and the front office will handle it."
NBASpurs,3d1sej,FuckJohnGalt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"You mean like Parker becoming a 6th man in the next 2-3 years? Because I don't think that will happen. The Spurs do need to groom a young point guard to eventually take his place though. Parker told SAEN that his plan is to play for at least 5 more years. ESPN analysts were already calling him just a ""serviceable point guard"" not elite anymore. I hope his injury struggles won't continue to this next season. It was a rough year for him. I'm excited for next season because it will be perfect for McCallum to play when Parker rests games, McCallum can get used to playing with the other starters and gain some reps for the playoffs."
NBASpurs,3d1sej,felipegod,2,Tue Jul 14 09:25:22 2015 UTC,"So I'm thinking between them, these two have what, at least five, six years of pro basketball experience?"

NBASpurs,3d1sej,macbeth_htebcam,4,Mon Jul 13 01:14:12 2015 UTC,"Juliet is annoying like a younger sister, but I think she has some interesting views... Sharp however is completely worthless."

NBASpurs,3d012c,FuckJohnGalt,12,Sun Jul 12 09:36:28 2015 UTC,I have no clue what to think. He is massive and he looks self aware but I haven't seen him make any meaningful post moves beyond camping in the lane to pick up scrappy put backs.
NBASpurs,3d012c,WEINERDOGvsBADGER,5,Sun Jul 12 13:20:44 2015 UTC,"Well, as our 5th big he's going to be going up against less skilled big men on the other team, so I'm hopeful that he can do damage perhaps on sheer size alone."
NBASpurs,3d012c,CryHav0c,2,Sun Jul 12 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"What also concerns me with his big asset of size is his physical health and prone-ness to injury, like most bigs in the 7+ club ."
NBASpurs,3d012c,MidnightRofl,3,Mon Jul 13 01:26:44 2015 UTC,I like his passing! Looks like a bigger Tiago in that regard!

NBASpurs,3d012c,spurfan219,4,Mon Jul 13 01:52:40 2015 UTC,This guy is not a splitter replacement...more like a baynes replacement. He's a 5-10 mins a game type of guy who can grind it out in half court sets. No uptempo so you won't see him playing against the warriors. He rolls to the basket pretty well and can drop the hammer. His wingspan is too wide for anyone to block his shot. He's also a big body and ugly as hell so quite intimidating for anyone trying to attack the rim LOL
NBASpurs,3cyxwo,sY20,84,Sun Jul 12 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, this is Pop's first real opportunity to prove himself as a coach, he's been lucky the past 2 decades and 5 rings, this coming season will make or break his career."

NBASpurs,3cyxwo,oldskool88,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:58:17 2015 UTC,"Well then why put him in those late game situations, we all said Manu needs to be yanked from late game heroics, but Pop keeps going to him. Still he is a curmudgeon and doesnt like change, luckily change has been forced on him and he will have to deal with it. This is not to say i dont like Pop, it's just ""Pop stop giving Manu the ball late...please""."
NBASpurs,3cyxwo,eqgmrdbz,10,Sun Jul 12 01:57:30 2015 UTC,"I would love to know if Kerr had Pop's deadpan delivery before he met Pop because I don't remember him being like this when he was doing TV, but as a coach he sounds at times like Pop Jr."
NBASpurs,3cyxwo,GameTimeArt,10,Sun Jul 12 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"Well he still had that dry, sarcastic style of humor during his speech at the Bulls championship parade... Maybe hanging around Pop helped him fine tune his skills"

NBASpurs,3cz3po,Koozzie,12,Sun Jul 12 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"I think everyone needs to realize this guy is 6 fucking 9. He's handling the ball pretty well. He's just long. As you can tell with that crossover he's doing well simply because each step takes up so much space.  I think he's definitely a diamond in the rough. Look at other great 6'9"" or more guys, they usually have more muscle and can move more quickly (save Durant...I don't understand Durant). Just let him keep working and he's going to be an absolute beast. Maybe not Magic Johnson, but if he gets enough muscle he'll be spectacular. Muscle will work wonders on his speed, ball-handling, and jumper."

NBASpurs,3ctmh1,Pale_Grey,2,Sat Jul 11 02:27:04 2015 UTC,I think Boban is younger and he played a lot more in the Euroleague. Gave some legit big guys fits.

NBASpurs,3ctmh1,coastlines,23,Fri Jul 10 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"Boban is a great player. Huge guy with huge hands and some nice moves, but very slow. Not just running but almost everything. He can hit a midrange jumper (not much actual jumping involved :) ), even a turnaround jumper. Even though his trigger is slow, i don't think it is a big deal because not a lot of people in the world can block him :) Defense is solid but not stellar. Rim protection is ok, he is big, strong, not easy to move around, but for a 222 guy 0.9 bpg is not that great. He was KK Crvena Zvezda's primary offensive weapon, mostly post up plays so his p'n'r will be quite rusty. That being said, i don't know how will Bobby perform as a role player simply because he needs the ball down low to be efficient. Great passing, nice court vision and high IQ allow him to deal with double teams easily and with his size and toughness, you can just lob the ball to him whenever your offense stalls (basically 50% of KKCZ offensive plays were ""throw the ball to Bobby and expect him to do magic"", and he mostly delivered). His rebounding is as great as you would expect. Just this season he broke the euroleague record for total rebounds in a season. Incredibly soft hands for such a big guy, just check out these clutch free throws (and the battle under the basket with a pretty semi-flop at the end there :) ) If I recall correctly, LeBron was in a similar position against Houston this year, and missed both soooo Bobby >>> LeBron :D I've seen him swish a couple of three pointers during warmup, but don't expect much of that. My money is actually on 0 3pt attempts during his NBA career. Awesone person off the court, not too lazy or too proud to sign autographs. Picture with his wife. Another one. Not many people are aware, but Bobby already played in the USA before. About five years ago, he played for CSKA Moscow in games against Miami, OKC and Cleveland. Although he started, he only played a couple of minutes and didn't use them very well. tl;dr Bobby is a great player, but needs the ball to be efficient/effective, and i'm not too high on him being as great as a role player. But if anyone can make him great, it is Pop.    If i forgot something, made a mistake, or if you have any question feel free to ask :)"

NBASpurs,3cubqd,Win_Duncan,26,Fri Jul 10 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"To clarify, he's a 6' 6"" slasher from Austin Spurs"
NBASpurs,3cubqd,svivvty,18,Fri Jul 10 21:25:02 2015 UTC,Shot 40%+ from three last season.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,find_my_harborcoat,17,Fri Jul 10 21:53:44 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly more important than him being a slasher, you're right.   Here's to hoping he fills his role well!"
NBASpurs,3cubqd,yamaha2k11,20,Fri Jul 10 21:55:50 2015 UTC,The only thing I ever remember about this guy is this.  Which is not at all a bad thing to remember about a player.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,T-Luv,8,Fri Jul 10 21:06:22 2015 UTC,That's one sexy eurostep. He'll fit in right here :)
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Interlake_Olympia,7,Sat Jul 11 01:18:32 2015 UTC,Will there be room for Bonner on the roster?
NBASpurs,3cubqd,tvfilm,8,Fri Jul 10 21:54:34 2015 UTC,Yes.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Cogency,7,Fri Jul 10 22:27:11 2015 UTC,Bill Simmons should like this pick.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,find_my_harborcoat,4,Fri Jul 10 22:43:20 2015 UTC,Is any of it guaranteed?  Or is this just camp fodder?
NBASpurs,3cubqd,69pissface420,4,Fri Jul 10 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"Full guarantee for the first year, but still feels (to me) like it may just well be for camp really, somewhat like Cotton's role last year.  The only question is of SS&E's willingness to eat $500k; they've done it in the past but might not love the idea of doing it in a year where it's possible they'll already be paying some luxury tax."
NBASpurs,3cubqd,find_my_harborcoat,3,Fri Jul 10 21:46:16 2015 UTC,Cotton was only guaranteed like 25k last year FWIW
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Chillinthamost,2,Sat Jul 11 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, didn't mean to suggest the money situation was close, more meant that it feels like they don't really intend to keep him on the roster past camp."
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Spurs50,5,Sat Jul 11 00:33:39 2015 UTC,Really? I figured we would sign someone more relevant for our back up wing.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,find_my_harborcoat,14,Fri Jul 10 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"I bet they'll probably try to play Kyle Anderson as Kawhi's backup, and see how that plays out"
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Chillinthamost,7,Fri Jul 10 21:22:55 2015 UTC,What makes you think they can't get wing minutes from him?
NBASpurs,3cubqd,find_my_harborcoat,4,Fri Jul 10 21:41:11 2015 UTC,II've just never been optimistic of D-League players who aren't rookies.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,yamaha2k11,9,Fri Jul 10 22:48:10 2015 UTC,"Fair not to be optimistic, but (not at all trying to make a comparison, just pointing out that rare exceptions exist) that's what Danny basically was, a second year guy in the D-League, so it is at least possible.  And his 3FG% has been in the vicinity of 40% so I think there's a chance he can at least do a poor man's Marco impression in spot minutes.  I'd actually prefer to see PATFO go this route rather than with Delfino or someone, just because those vet signings might help get a ring short-term but don't really help the future vision."
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Chillinthamost,10,Fri Jul 10 23:10:45 2015 UTC,Plus doesn't the Austin Spurs run the same kind of sets we run? He shouldn't have a tough time acclimating to how Pop runs things hopefully.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Golai77,2,Sat Jul 11 01:19:43 2015 UTC,"Good point, I trust PATFO as much as anyone but this was just kind of underwhelming after being spoiled this free agency. IMO if a D-Leaguer hasn't proven himself in his first season or two then there isn't much there. That being said, I hope we can develop him into a good role player and he can add some of the shooting we lost with Marco. The FO has found gems before..."
NBASpurs,3cubqd,yamaha2k11,4,Fri Jul 10 23:24:14 2015 UTC,Spurs D-league-ers are different than other teams'.   They signed Bryce Cotton to a deal similar to this last summer and he ended up being just a camp body. He turned out to be really good for the Jazz later in the season and they signed him to multi-year deal.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Brygantopithicus,2,Sat Jul 11 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"I was hoping we could have kept him. But I feel confidant in this guy. He's not going to be getting a lot of minutes. He just needs to be good enough in case we need to give our guys a little bit of a breather, or step in and play more of a back up role if god forbid, anybody gets hurt."
NBASpurs,3cubqd,KuyaJohnny,0,Sat Jul 11 01:21:21 2015 UTC,"yea, that's really logical because everyone develops at the same rate."
NBASpurs,3cubqd,tommyphammy,6,Sun Jul 12 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"welp, no shved then i guess"
NBASpurs,3cubqd,yamaha2k11,3,Fri Jul 10 21:13:19 2015 UTC,Can he shoot?
NBASpurs,3cubqd,attillcus,3,Fri Jul 10 21:35:15 2015 UTC,Apparently he's shot 40% from the 3 last year in the D-league. That's a good sign.
NBASpurs,3cubqd,tvfilm,3,Sat Jul 11 01:22:47 2015 UTC,Does anyone know enough about his game to give a quick summary?
NBASpurs,3cubqd,Mattsasse,2,Fri Jul 10 22:10:37 2015 UTC,Looks like a Jamal Crawford.
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,LoLz14,41,Fri Jul 10 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"Hey spurs fans, I am Croat who isn't really a Spurs fan, but I watched Marjanovic pretty often when he came to Croatia to play vs Cibona and Cedevita, and lemme tell u sumthin, this guy is a freaking beast.  He played vs legit 7 footers in Euroleague, and just fucked all of them. I don't know if his game will translate to NBA, but IMO it will. He is smart, he moves well and can post up. He was double teamed every time he got the ball in the paint.   Plus, he is solid shooter. I posted some info and links here"
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,Baribal,9,Fri Jul 10 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks man."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,LoLz14,9,Fri Jul 10 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, I always love to bring some info about players that I know and follow. If anyone has any questions, ask and I'll try to answer :D  PS:  It isn't fair what is your team turning into :("
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,Baribal,5,Fri Jul 10 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"The only criticisms seem to be that he's clumsy, any merit to that?  Also this is weird, but how is his personality? We are a pretty low key and subtle team and I hope he would fit in with that well.   It isn't fair what is your team turning into   I'm okay with this."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,LoLz14,8,Fri Jul 10 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"As far as personality goes, from everything I've heard and read, he seems like genuinly nice guy, I think he will fit in nicely.  And about clumsiness. Well look at him :D It is hard not being clumsy at 7'4. But for such height he moves pretty well (check out the video and just watch him run the floor and move along with the action, he seems ok)  EDIT: Here is an article about him, his wive and their life It is in Serbian though, so try to translate it through Google translate (I doubt that will be efficient :D) But from what I've read he seems like super chill guy."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,thecrunchcrew,6,Fri Jul 10 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"Can he defend at all? For a 7'4"" guy I kinda expected to see some blocks in these highlights."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,LoLz14,7,Fri Jul 10 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"Ugh yeah, I think he isn't that good of a blocker.  I think his presence alone means a lot. I remember when I watched his former team play vs Cibona and Cedevita and opposing team's centers just couldn't go into the paint with him being there. It was really hard to do so.   I mean you can check out Miro Bilan's stats and look how he played vs team ""C.Zvezda"". Bilan was best (or second best) center in the league after Boban I'd say and he was struggling against Zvezda always. (This is adriatic league)  Same goes for other centers."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,BabyS1othWithA1,17,Fri Jul 10 22:09:36 2015 UTC,He is a large human
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,muddyturtle,13,Fri Jul 10 18:55:06 2015 UTC,Right?  Jumping is only a formality.
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,nokarmawhore,14,Fri Jul 10 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"He has nice hands for his size and isn't soft at the rim like Splitter. He probably wont get a ton of minutes but I wouldn't be surprised if he excelled when sharing the floor with Mills, Manu, & West."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,Interlake_Olympia,11,Fri Jul 10 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"He has to get 15+ mins a game, no? Timmy will most likely play 26 mins a game max. idk I'll leave pop to figure this out haha"
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,muddyturtle,7,Fri Jul 10 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that Timmy will be around 26, but LMA will probably be around 34. That leaves 36 min for Boris, West, Marjanovic and probably Bonner to split. I don't see Boban getting more than 12 minutes a game, honestly (if even that much)."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,Trancefam,4,Fri Jul 10 20:45:22 2015 UTC,Idk. I think will see all kinds of crazy ass lineups early in the year. Can't wait to see it all unfold. Should be a fun year.
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,hey_sergio,2,Sat Jul 11 01:31:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like that he isn't soft around the rim. He'll need time to adjust and develop in the NBA, but I can't wait to see his progression. Honestly, knowing the Spurs' luck and ability to turn perceived duds into studs, he'll probably turn out to be much better than people initially think."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,tvfilm,10,Sat Jul 11 02:31:22 2015 UTC,Did anyone have his rights? Was he just some awesome center in Europe that anyone could have signed or drafted?
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,nokarmawhore,7,Fri Jul 10 20:57:57 2015 UTC,my body is ready
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,kiciner,3,Fri Jul 10 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"anyone know if he can play in the summer league? I wanna see him go up against some 7 footers.  That said, I'm already a fan of his offensive game. Looks like he can step out and shoot from the mid range too!"
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,gshortelljr,2,Fri Jul 10 19:55:30 2015 UTC,nope.. he''s with serbian national team in euro cup (sept I think)
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,attillcus,5,Fri Jul 10 21:40:33 2015 UTC,He's very fluid for his size
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,oldskool88,4,Fri Jul 10 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"He looks slow and will probably struggle a ton on defense, especially in PnR coverage. However, it looks like he has no problem finishing around the rim  as he has great hands and rarely drops the ball below his shoulders. He should shoot a monster FG% in the limited minutes he gets. I think he'll get time when Duncan sits out games. It'd be interesting to see random lineups with 4 shooters and Boban lurking for easy finishes in the paint as well."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,find_my_harborcoat,3,Fri Jul 10 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this, I had never heard of him. He will be better than Splitter that's for sure.  7'3 300lbs he is a big boy but seems a bit slow from the video, at minimum he can pick and roll and clog up the lane and protect the lane.  We will see.  Welcome Bobi!"
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,leeauxxx,5,Sat Jul 11 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"Everybody's going nuts over this, and I'm not ruling out the possibility of this meaning anything, but two things to note:  1)  The league has moved (and continues to move) significantly toward a style of play where this guy would be forced off the floor, and 2) it's a one-year deal and he's almost certainly not going to get any real minutes on a team with TD, LMA, Boris, and West in the front-court rotation.  So I don't think it's quite the amazing move some are making it out to be."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,bawbay,5,Fri Jul 10 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you that the league is always changing, and it seems the ""small ball"" is prevailing, however, I think that having a big center is always going to be a need - I don't care how much the league evolves - Steph Curry is never going to be able to guard Marc Gasol - and if Steph Curry and Klay Thompson double team him, Marc Gasol can always pass it.  2.) You could be right as far as not getting any real minutes, however, I don't think anybody is expecting him to be Yao Ming for us, he just gives us a pretty attractive insurance policy if he plays anywhere close to his potential."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,HearThatAlotInPrison,2,Fri Jul 10 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"He looks good against these guys, but we're going to see if he can do it against the best in the world. Hope he can give us something though. He looks smart and he's tall. Looks like he might get pushed around a bit by the more physical centers in the league. But like I said, hopefully he will come out the gate as good as the rest of them!"
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,amp112,2,Sat Jul 11 00:16:20 2015 UTC,My bro calls me Boban.  Awesome to see its a real name. Now I want my son to be called Boban.
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,andon94,2,Sat Jul 11 01:40:34 2015 UTC,he looks good but I have a feeling Ima be yelling at him through my TV to dunk it instead of laying it in. Either way I'm stoked we got someone to back up Timmy.
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,Alphadestrious,2,Fri Jul 10 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"He moves very awkwardly (even for a man that size), but great effort. Could use a few footwork drills."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,andon94,3,Fri Jul 10 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"I hope he makes it in the NBA, but i doubt it.  He played good in the Euroleague in the regular part of the season with teams that were not actally stacked on the 5 position.  Top 16 was a whole different story, he was matched with cappable 5s and was shut down.  Partizan stoped him with Milutinov almost every time they played, but had to use a double team.  I don't think he'll be able to compete with NBA caliber players, but the Spurs system.... I dunno.   He's a good guy and I wish him good luck."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,ImAlwaysLegit,3,Fri Jul 10 22:16:04 2015 UTC,Some other guy a few posts up/down said he played against legit 7 foot centers and was a monster.
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,andon94,0,Fri Jul 10 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"Jokic, the guy that just signed with Denver easily scored 20 on him."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,M0rTaR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:06:06 2015 UTC,"Dude he played really good in Top 16. Being a fan of Red Star myself i watched almost every game. He dominated the same way he did in the regular season. He was probably the best center in the Euroleague last season. I don't know how you got impression that he got shut down beacuse he wasn't.  In regular season he averaged 28 mins per game and 16.8 PPG, 10.7 RPG on 64.6% FG and 72.7% FT.  While in Top 16 on 26 mins per game he averaged 16.39 PPG, 10.6 RPG on 60% FG and 82.2% FT.  I had to reply because you clearly don't know what you are talking about."
NBASpurs,3ctrgb,vaughandrix,0,Sat Jul 11 08:33:20 2015 UTC,"I'm on my phone, and can't look up any stats but I remember him being shut down against bigger and stronger teams."
NBASpurs,3cuci1,coastlines,9,Fri Jul 10 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"Uncertainty surrounding Bonner (and Ayres) is briefly mentioned.   ""We’ll miss the relationships we had with Marco and with Cory and with Aron, and Tiago. Losing those guys…and Jeff Ayres, we don’t know what’s going to happen yet. And Matt. So losing those relationships, not only a big part of the success but the chemistry and the culture of the group, you have to continue to recognize there will be some losses in this process. It’s never easy.”"
NBASpurs,3cuci1,wm210,3,Fri Jul 10 21:12:03 2015 UTC,Yeah did he mean Bonner is out?
NBASpurs,3cuci1,BabyS1othWithA1,4,Sat Jul 11 00:59:41 2015 UTC,This whole thing is a really good read for those who haven't yet - it's great hearing his side of things
NBASpurs,3cuci1,AristotleStatus,2,Fri Jul 10 22:04:38 2015 UTC,"It was informative. Especially because we've been so speculative in the moves PATFO were making (Tiago and Plan B, anyone?) within the sub for a while now. Or rather, what feels like a while!"
NBASpurs,3curty,cooley1990,11,Fri Jul 10 23:07:11 2015 UTC,I really hope so. We should still have a slot.
NBASpurs,3curty,servernode,7,Fri Jul 10 23:15:49 2015 UTC,"I think Matt could find a new team if he doesn't come back, but I wouldn't be shocked if he joined our coaching staff. In all reality we are pretty deep now up front. He would make half our team forwards and centers. I'm not so sure he would play much, but he would be great leadership still.   I'm honestly fine with whatever happens to him, but if we don't sign him I hope he atleast sticks around. He did mention he would love to play in Boston since it's close to his home state."
NBASpurs,3curty,wild_thingy,7,Sat Jul 11 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"That said, he's a different type of forward. He is still a good option to space the floor because like Danny, he holds a defender at the 3pt line pretty much permanently."
NBASpurs,3curty,swimfast58,6,Sat Jul 11 02:52:18 2015 UTC,Can't lose Coach B/Medium Fundamental.

NBASpurs,3curty,Addicted_Runner,3,Sat Jul 11 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"Anyone we put at the end of our bench is going to make the veteran minimum or barely any less. Given that, no one is going to be more effective than a guy that knows our system. Bring back Bonner."
NBASpurs,3curty,Starsy,2,Sat Jul 11 07:44:47 2015 UTC,"I really hope so, I've been a fan of his since I played against him in high school. I would have been a fan no matter where his career played out, but it's been even more enjoyable to watch him have success with the Spurs."
NBASpurs,3curty,Roarstar,2,Sat Jul 11 03:57:44 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be back. He knows the system and could help out all the new recruits fit in. He is a tall guy that can be a three point threat, even though the % dropped last season. If only he could get fouled a lot more, his FT% is pretty good."
NBASpurs,3ctc0c,woggyk,25,Fri Jul 10 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"See, after all that hand-wringing about how LMA should hurry up and make a decision, we should all be glad he's a thoughtful guy who even gave himself a night to sleep on his decision. Polar opposite of DeAndre!"

NBASpurs,3ctc0c,Pale_Grey,14,Fri Jul 10 17:17:25 2015 UTC,"Most likely, we haven't signed him yet though."

NBASpurs,3cu0pu,alottleocd,8,Fri Jul 10 19:55:06 2015 UTC,It's actually a boom mic which is used for long distance recordings like in movies and talk shows and the case is to protect it from wind gust sounds. :D was funny nonetheless
NBASpurs,3cu0pu,BeardDiseaseJr,6,Fri Jul 10 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"The mic is ready in case anything is shot outdoors, the audio guy came prepared in case something was to be filmed outside/outdoors (maybe reporter was going to another shoot afterwards), it's kinda overkill inside a building but since the conference looks like it was inside the Spurs practice facility this sort of mic and enclosure (called a blimp) can filter some of the excess noise from shouting, basketballs dribbling, etc.   But it's really there to cut down wind mostly, used on location but it's not unusual to be seen inside noisy environments.   Frankly, I think the audio dude was just prepared in case some shit escalated and a brawl ensued outside between SJax and Devin Brown. ""you ain't about dis' life homie"""

DJ is a lazy bum that won't practice is free throw while getting pay millions.  And Doc River is very unlikeable.

NBASpurs,3cu73q,ARBentz,17,Fri Jul 10 20:28:25 2015 UTC,I'm sure he'll be back on the vet min.  Probably won't dress a lot of nights but will contribute on any Duncan rest nights.  He won't go anywhere.  Worst case scenario he's added to the coaching staff or some position in the organization.
NBASpurs,3cu73q,Mattsasse,7,Fri Jul 10 21:30:59 2015 UTC,This is the positivity I need in this sub right now!
NBASpurs,3cu73q,coastlines,5,Fri Jul 10 22:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah we have 13 guys under contract now I believe with the Simmons deal.  Bonner makes 14 and then If the previous years are any indication, PATFO will leave the 15th spot open for flexibility.  Edit: Basically he would fill Ayres old role"
NBASpurs,3cu73q,Mattsasse,4,Fri Jul 10 22:32:36 2015 UTC,"We had 6 bigs last year, why can't we this year? Sign Bonner and a minimum contract wing to fill out the roster."
NBASpurs,3cu73q,Chillinthamost,6,Fri Jul 10 21:01:25 2015 UTC,Considering that there are talks of LMA becoming more of a 3 point shooter and taking more 3's this year than he has in the past. It doesn't sound too good for the red rocket. i think we need to see what Manu ends up signing for and how much money is left. We might not have the ability to give out any more contracts.
NBASpurs,3cu73q,macbeth_htebcam,6,Fri Jul 10 20:49:23 2015 UTC,Maybe we can start a GoFund.Me to help absorb some of Bonner's vet min contract?

NBASpurs,3cu73q,macbeth_htebcam,4,Fri Jul 10 21:37:03 2015 UTC,Especially we need to sign one more wing player since we're thin there.
NBASpurs,3cu73q,yamaha2k11,3,Fri Jul 10 21:00:19 2015 UTC,Coach B could be the Reggie Williams this year. His locker room presence is invaluable :(
NBASpurs,3cu73q,dicky_________seamus,4,Fri Jul 10 20:46:44 2015 UTC,Looks like he won't be back. It makes me sad too. :(
NBASpurs,3cu73q,frankl45,6,Fri Jul 10 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"With the way Bonner disappeared in the playoffs, I think it's a good choice. I'll miss his personality though."

He just got traded to a serious contender and will probably play close to 70 games this year and provide a valuable role off the bench. Good for him. Also im pretty sure San Antonio is an upgrade from Sacramento in terms of cities you want to live in.

NBASpurs,3cra8s,tvfilm,2,Fri Jul 10 06:53:54 2015 UTC,He's making millions of dollars a year. He can drive/fly to SF or LA any time he wants. A flight to LA is like 1.5 hrs. He's closer to more interesting cities/things to do in Sacramento than he is in San Antonio.

NBASpurs,3cra8s,karmadestroying,3,Fri Jul 10 07:11:18 2015 UTC,"I spend a lot of time in Sacramento. Went to a few Spurs games at the generally awful Sleep Train arena.  Sacramento sucks. There's like 3 blocks around midtown and sac state that are worth spending time in, most of downtown is dead and abandoned in preparation for the new arena, everything is expensive, parking is awful, roads are poor, it has central valley desert heat in the summer, it goes on.  Everyone with means lives east of town in Placer or El Dorado counties, which I'm going to bet includes the Kings players and staff.  The biggest positive points of Sacramento is that it's only 90 minutes to San Francisco or Tahoe, so it's not too far to someplace you'd actually want to be in. Also probably easy to score drugs when the legislature in is session."

NBASpurs,3cra8s,RichardLOD,8,Fri Jul 10 06:54:30 2015 UTC,And don't forget what Chip does with shooters.
NBASpurs,3cra8s,Trancefam,2,Fri Jul 10 10:27:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm surprised we've been able to keep the guy this long. Given the results of his work, you'd think some other team would have made him an offer he couldn't refuse."
NBASpurs,3cra8s,-Gojira-,15,Fri Jul 10 20:24:34 2015 UTC,I like him already. Can't wait for him to do some work!
NBASpurs,3cra8s,mrbrownstone1482,10,Fri Jul 10 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"I've read that his contract doesn't count against that cap. Is it true, and does it allow us to sign Manu with cap space and save the room exception?"
NBASpurs,3cra8s,diffeqmaster,13,Fri Jul 10 05:22:40 2015 UTC,"Correct, it's an unguaranteed rookie deal so it does not count.  Just another reason it's a great trade."
NBASpurs,3cra8s,ec2xs,2,Fri Jul 10 05:49:12 2015 UTC,"I assumed the savings were going to Tim, so I was surprised that he only took $5 mil a year.  Does this mean we have a little extra to offer than the vet minimum?"
NBASpurs,3cra8s,diffeqmaster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:04:25 2015 UTC,It depends on how Manu comes back. It seems likely we have exactly one contract left that's slightly higher than the minimum but in the current market that doesn't mean a lot.
NBASpurs,3cra8s,ec2xs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"It may mean outbidding for a player that performs exceptionally well in summer league, gets waived (like ridnour did), or is willing to break a contract in Europe.  Can't hurt, at least."
NBASpurs,3cra8s,VO2Max,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:29:23 2015 UTC,Can you ELI5 this for me? What does unguaranteed rookie deal mean here?
NBASpurs,3cra8s,longb123,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:01:39 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it means his salary doesn't count against the cap until a certain date (maybe sometime in August IIRC). Basically it means more money for Tim or someone else at least up to the salary cap.
NBASpurs,3cra8s,diffeqmaster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"First round draft picks have very rigid contracts. These all have the same structure, all end in restricted free agency. The value is determined by the pick number.   But a second round pick, like McCallum, is a lot more flexible. McCallum's contract can be waived up until some point just before the season starts, and for that reason he has no cap hold."
NBASpurs,3cra8s,El_Psy_Congroo_03,6,Fri Jul 10 17:47:02 2015 UTC,Excited to see him in SA. Hope he'll get some minutes and improve more here.

Alexy Shved is tempting, but I don't know if we really need him now.   I would like a legit backup center still...someone who can play solid minutes even if they aren't a game changer. Depending on his health, I've heard Emeka Okafor's name floated out here...we aren't going to find any great people for that spot but I just want someone who can hold their own"
NBASpurs,3cstng,BabyS1othWithA1,14,Fri Jul 10 14:37:59 2015 UTC,I really want Okafor. Seems like the best defensive center available and I want defense more than anything from our backup 5 role.  Edit: never mind.  I'm ok with that Serbian giant dude we got.
NBASpurs,3cstng,Mattsasse,2,Fri Jul 10 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"Wait, this doesn't add up, you want defense more than anything at backup C but you're fine with Barjanovic?  He's very much more of an offense-focuse player than a defense-focused one, and the defensive contributions he does make are rebounding only, nothing in the way of rim protection which I'd much prefer."
NBASpurs,3cstng,find_my_harborcoat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:38:02 2015 UTC,I'd prefer defense yes but this guys skillset seems greater than Baynes' was on both ends.  I think he'll have a higher ceiling. Pop can hopefully coach him up on the defensive side a little bit. I don't see any free agents that are particularly good rim protectors still available. Might as well go with the one with the longest reach and hope for the best. Not sure Okafor would be much better at this point in his career either.

He is 30, plays SF and can shoot/make some plays off the dribble. Seems to be able to move decent enough on defense. He could be an option.  If we could get a solid, veteran C, that would be huge. ZaZa would've been great, but no way R.C. gives up more second rounders this off-season."
NBASpurs,3cstng,Golai77,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, he's more of a DeJuan Blair PF type."
NBASpurs,3cstng,SAmatador,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"From the highlights I've seen he's not near the rebounder, but much quicker. He's not KD, but he can make plays from the top of the arc, something Blair can only dream of."
NBASpurs,3cstng,Golai77,4,Fri Jul 10 18:16:11 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see Adam Hanga be brought over. He's pretty gifted athletically and while he is a pretty bad shooter now if he gets some time with the Chipp he could improve.
NBASpurs,3cstng,TotallyAlex,3,Fri Jul 10 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"I want him too, but I don't think he could do much for us this season."
NBASpurs,3cstng,CorporateKnowledge,6,Fri Jul 10 17:02:52 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping we bring over a guy from Europe. Wouldn't mind us dealing a prospect and a number 2 for one that we like. Also, I heard Sasha Kaun really intrigues me. I think he'd be ready to roll right away. I really have no idea what we are going to do next."
NBASpurs,3cstng,SAmatador,7,Fri Jul 10 17:57:50 2015 UTC,We really need more shooting.
NBASpurs,3cstng,CorporateKnowledge,3,Fri Jul 10 17:01:46 2015 UTC,we need a wing player that can shoot.
NBASpurs,3cstng,_Invalid_Username__,3,Fri Jul 10 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"Matt ""The Sandwich Hunter"" Bonner."
NBASpurs,3cstng,sharkenleo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:03:50 2015 UTC,Luke Ridnour would give us really good depth at PG. Shved would be a solid pickup too.   Cole Aldrich as backup C.   I think we find wing depth from the D League. Probably shuttle several players back and forth throughout the season. Jarrell Eddie seems like a guy who will probably get a look.
NBASpurs,3cstng,Cecil_Hardboner,5,Fri Jul 10 15:05:39 2015 UTC,I think we are set on PG... Ray was a good signing... Another shooter and big guy would be great... Like Prince
NBASpurs,3cstng,Cecil_Hardboner,7,Fri Jul 10 15:07:49 2015 UTC,Tayshaun Prince is the last person I want us to sign. I really dont understand why so many people in here are bringing him up.
NBASpurs,3cstng,drainoltx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:37:28 2015 UTC,Why not? Just curious. We need a backup SF and he seems like he can be a good backup.
NBASpurs,3cstng,Mattsasse,6,Fri Jul 10 16:13:37 2015 UTC,Tayshaun Prince 5 years ago would've been awesome. He's lost a step (or 3) and can't defend anywhere near what he used to be able to do. His offense was never anything special to begin with. He could be adequate at best but there's likely younger guys out there who would produce as much if not more than him with much higher ceilings.
NBASpurs,3cstng,Cecil_Hardboner,4,Fri Jul 10 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"I just think he is toast. I will concede that the SF market is thin though, and he might be the best available option anyway. But I'd rather go with youth and energy."
NBASpurs,3cstng,odeon63,5,Fri Jul 10 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"Man if we got ridnour after 4 franchises traded him and then waived him, and somehow made him play some valuable minutes, people would lose their shit!"
NBASpurs,3cstng,drainoltx,4,Fri Jul 10 15:33:08 2015 UTC,We don't need 4 PGs.
NBASpurs,3cstng,drainoltx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:12:36 2015 UTC,Tayshaun Prince maybe. Might be better to get someone younger tho.
NBASpurs,3cstng,Sneezus_Christ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:12:11 2015 UTC,You guys like anybody from the summer league team? How about the littler Bertans?
NBASpurs,3cstng,Chillinthamost,5,Fri Jul 10 17:04:32 2015 UTC,I'm pretty underwhelmed by our SL roster so far.
NBASpurs,3cstng,KuyaJohnny,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:20:52 2015 UTC,not sure if we have a shot at shved but he'd be perfect.   as far as big mans I'm not impressed by any of them...I'd rather see them give Lalanne a shot.
NBASpurs,3cstng,tvfilm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:26:11 2015 UTC,Tayshaun Prince. Period.
NBASpurs,3cstng,Mattsasse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:42:43 2015 UTC,I think with the Marjonovic signing all we need is an smart veteran wing with a decent outside shot and we ready.  Rasual or Caron Butler come to mind immediately.  Not sure who else is available/affordable
NBASpurs,3cstng,HereComesJustice,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:32:01 2015 UTC,We need a 3 pt shooter. We need a Beli-like player

NBASpurs,3cpmp2,Lone_Star_122,5,Fri Jul 10 05:30:34 2015 UTC,Why would it have been removed?
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,Lone_Star_122,6,Thu Jul 9 22:39:25 2015 UTC,"General consensus when we asked a while ago was that upvote parties should be removed/reserved for like real important things.   As we saw from DeAndre, nothing is official in free agency until something is signed -- we wouldn't want a Chris Bosh Upvote Party situation on our hands"
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,BabyS1othWithA1,7,Thu Jul 9 22:49:44 2015 UTC,I gotcha. So up vote parties aren't completely outlawed like in the Warriors sub then?
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,33bour,4,Thu Jul 9 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"We'll probably have another discussion about it, but as far as I know right not they're not outlawed just very rare"
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,BabyS1othWithA1,7,Thu Jul 9 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"I'm asking a serious question here no disrespect, but are upvote parties really something that need to be regulated? Like all we are doing is celebrating something spurs related that happened with fake Internet points. In fact the reason I love this sub is because we used to have a lot of them and we'd always get them visible on r/nba. I just think of all the things mods need to worry about, upvote parties aren't one of them. Just my 2 cents."
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,tvfilm,5,Thu Jul 9 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"I totally get where you're coming from, and definitely appreciate the feedback (I see you posting around here and /r/NBA a lot).   Like I said, we'll probably bring it up again at some point during the offseason but just from me personally, having ""Second Win in A Row Upvote Party!!!"" or ""Kyle Anderson 10 points upvote party!!!"" gets annoying. It's harder to place a somewhat less strict limit on them because where do you draw the line, you know?   E - if you want feel free to shoot me a message and we can talk about this or other things with the sub, rather than getting more side tracked here. More than happy to hear feedback"
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,ChaoticAeon,12,Fri Jul 10 00:36:38 2015 UTC,"Can't believe the Bulls traded him away on draft night.   Speaking of the Bulls, F U Pau Gasol."

NBASpurs,3cpmp2,Mattsasse,11,Thu Jul 9 21:57:33 2015 UTC,The bulls had the #2 pick and got LMA. Then traded him to Portland for Tyrus Thomas.
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,rattatatouille,8,Fri Jul 10 00:59:18 2015 UTC,Lol tyrus Thomas. It's crazy what one good NCAA tourney will do for a players draft stock. But then with Stephen Curry it was the opposite.
NBASpurs,3cpmp2,starvinmartin,5,Fri Jul 10 01:35:59 2015 UTC,"the thing with Curry is that he was showing his chops even before the tournament. Taking a virtually unknown school to the tourney itself is an accomplishment, tbh."
