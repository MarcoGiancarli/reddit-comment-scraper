KingOfTheHill,3dw4ul,__z__z__,17,Mon Jul 20 03:06:52 2015 UTC,"I mean... have you ever grilled with propane?  It's a quality gas, I'll tell you what.   You get precise control of the heat, able to turn up/down the flame as needed... unlike charcoal.   You really do get to taste the true flavor of the meat itself, rather than the black sooty flavor of the charcoal. The charcoal flavor masks the meat's flavor, making a even the best steak taste like an old chimney sweep's hat.   If you're really looking for some additional ""flavoring"" in your meat, don't go with charcoal.  Get yourself a real Smoker and use some quality wood.  But that's a whole different ball game. You get to smell the meat too.  When you're grilling with propane, all you smell is the meat you're cooking (rather than the thick stench of charcoal filling your yard).   More importantly, propane is a clean burning fuel.  You aren't getting that smoke and ash blown into your face, you don't have burned out briquettes to dump and black sludge to clean out of your unit.   Propane gives a man true control over his grill.  Tell you what, son.  Why don't you head down to Strickland Propane (if you live near Arlen) or any other fully-licensed seller of propane and propane accessories closer to where you live, and find yourself a grill.    You won't regret it.    Propane is not an ""obsession"", it is a passion.  A mutual respect between a man and a gas.    Seriously though, my family and I have grilled with propane for decades now and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Summer nights in the backyard, standing in front of a propane grill with a spatula in one hand and a beer in the other, that's what America is all about."

KingOfTheHill,3dp5hl,ztiberiusd,45,Sat Jul 18 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"""Pretty Pretty Dresses."" A Christmas episode that is actually very dark, as it goes into Bill's hopeless obsession with his ex-wife, Lenore, who left him on Christmas. He has several rituals to help him cope with the fact that she's gone, like putting presents under the tree for her, hanging up a stocking with her name on it, etc. all in hopes that she will come back.  He tries eating dinner with the Hills every night so he doesn't feel lonely, but he always thinks about Lenore and always starts talking about her, and eventually Hank can't take it any longer, so he tries to ""help"" Bill by destroying everything to do with Lenore in front of Bill, and this scene is the result. Hank isn't being malicious, he just doesn't understand how emotions work (having had to suppress his own for most of his life) and tries to fix it quickly like an automobile or a broken grill. So in his eyes, not feeling anything is an improvement from feeling woeful about Lenore.  It's one of my favorite episodes because it not only goes into how broken Bill is, but it also demonstrates Hank's fatal flaw: His inability to deal with emotions."

KingOfTheHill,3dlb7a,chiselplow,24,Fri Jul 17 04:53:58 2015 UTC,I really disagree with the ideas that the show still makes too much money you go on streaming. Doctor Who brings in more money than any other BBC show and is on Netflix.
KingOfTheHill,3dlb7a,Minnesota_Nice_87,7,Fri Jul 17 13:02:33 2015 UTC,Luckily Adult Swim keeps me in constant supply of KOTH.  After seeing this article I have pretty much list hope in it coming to streaming so I'll just start getting the dvds.

KingOfTheHill,3dlb7a,bomber991,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that if Adult Swim dropped KOTH, it would get picked back up on Netflix."

KingOfTheHill,3dlb7a,sdaly0107,9,Fri Jul 17 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"We are talking about FOX though.  The BBC seems like it is light years ahead of Fox when it comes to producing quality tv shows that people like to watch, and then keeping those shows on air.    Firefly, Terra Nova, Arrested Development, etc...  This list goes on and on."

KingOfTheHill,3dlb7a,DJ_BaLaLaWa,5,Fri Jul 17 19:13:10 2015 UTC,"What really irks me is that Fox isn't even releasing any of these DVD's anymore (not since season 6 anyway). Seasons 7-10 were released by Olive Films (and seasons 11-13 will be released by them in the future). I would venture a guess that Fox would make more money by streaming KOTH to any streaming service out there rather than leaving it in their vault. It's awesome that Adult Swim has it, it's great that it's available to purchase individual digital episodes, but not having a streaming option leads people to places to watch the entire series."
KingOfTheHill,3dlb7a,splintersmaster,6,Fri Jul 17 19:48:11 2015 UTC,Sorry everyone. I cracked about 6 weeks ago and starting purchasing seasons at 15 a pop.

I can remember Hank hating the Mega Low Mart up until it exploded, don't recall hearing much about it after that.  Does it have something to do with Buckley dying, or possibly it is because the explosion and the effects afterward brought him and Bobby closer?

Hank could never relate to Bobby, and as much as he loved his son he always missed that special bond.  Peggy always tried as hard as she can to create that bond although it was a fruitless effort.

KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,ew629,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:00:36 2015 UTC,What episode is this from?
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,Xerox748,9,Sat Jul 11 20:39:16 2015 UTC,Dia-BILL-ic Shock
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,CardinalAmbition,15,Sat Jul 11 20:42:37 2015 UTC,"Can't stand the end of this episode. After ending up in the hospital twice, the second time after ignoring his doctor, the good doctor tries to scare Bill straight. Instead of getting his act together, Bill misinterprets the doctor's warning and gives up on life. Everything, including the guys remodeling Bill's house, is due to Bill's stupidity. Yet Hank had no problem letting Bill assault a doctor."
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,DrDemenz,14,Sat Jul 11 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"I actually really like this episode because at the beginning I'm 100% on the doctor's ""side"" because Bill is so comically dumb re: his health and condition (like, beyond simple ignorance - just totally off-the-wall stupid).  Then, at the end, you kind of get the sense that even though Bill needed tough love, the doctor was being unnecessarily harsh.  The nurse looking the other way when Bill wailed on him at the end was to accent that this guy was a best-seller at the jerk store and treated Bill horribly - even considering Bill's painful idiocy."
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,behindtheaegis,6,Sun Jul 12 00:19:49 2015 UTC,I think the doctor was mean to the nurses too.
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,aquasharp,2,Sun Jul 12 04:13:44 2015 UTC,...yeah that was kind of my point...
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,behindtheaegis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:50:58 2015 UTC,I know. That's why I said 'too' instead of 'but'.
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,aquasharp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:48:39 2015 UTC,I know way too many doctors like this. I'm sure any doctor will become world weary after having to see so many trainwrecks that when he saw Bill he maybe was being harsh with good cause.
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,theirv15,11,Wed Jul 15 22:10:13 2015 UTC,"Considering the way he talks to his nurse/assistant, I'm going to say the doc wasn't giving Bill tough love, but was genuinely being an ass.  Plus the part where he says ""I didn't say anything that could be considered malpractice under its current definition"" just leads me to believe he's a doctor because he likes the power/ego trip and doesn't care about anyone other than himself."
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,Computermaster,0,Sun Jul 12 02:34:58 2015 UTC,dammit I thought this was only me thinking that the doctor just told him to get a wheelchair while his insurance was good and bill was idiotic during that
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,omararod,0,Sun Jul 12 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"Ironically enough, If the doctor never maid bill go into that tailspin, he never would have gotten his sugar under control. If the doctor was the normal ""just diet and exercise"" type, Bill would have ignored the doctor and been done in by diabetes."
KingOfTheHill,3cxtkq,CardinalAmbition,2,Sun Jul 12 09:43:43 2015 UTC,Lets not give him too much credit. The doctor just scared him into buying a wheel chair he didn't need. At that point Bill could have just as easily given up and gotten worse from depression and even less physical activity.  The real credit goes to the guy that brought him into his circle of friends and worked out with him everyday.

I love the fact that it's Octavio, and that Dale is totally accepting of being scammed. Like he was impressed by it. Octavio fucking rules it anytime he's around.   I think the episode is ""the suite smells of excess"" or something."

KingOfTheHill,3cvo48,Whothehllareyou,4,Sat Jul 11 07:26:30 2015 UTC,Yeah and he appears in other episodes (hires Luanne and what not). But I think the writers were aiming for the imagery.

KingOfTheHill,3cvo48,masterofreality71,7,Sat Jul 11 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"Looking for a clip of the scene but can only find full episodes.  Jack, the barber, is going crazy. When Hank walks in he says something like, ""I'm just finishing up Hank, I'll be right with you."" then sits down in the chair and starts putting a lot of moose in his hair.  Hank then begins to tell Jack (hair will noticeable amounts of moose still) that he won't be using him as his barber anymore. Jack expected this says something like ""There were a lot of jack asses in this business, you were one of the good one. Your son was one of the jack asses."" Moose still in his hair, a lot of this (important to the whole thing).  Hank starts to leave and Jack holds a hair dryer up to his head and turns it on, the moose starting move a little from the blow dryer. Cut scene to the outside of the barber shop. The moose flies and splatters the window of the barber shop.  All on its own it seems innocent enough but the way he holds the blow dryer, the depression you can see on his face, the timing, all leads to the scene to be about suicide of an old man who is losing his lively hood."
