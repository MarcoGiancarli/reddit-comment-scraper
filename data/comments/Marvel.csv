Marvel,3e2lot,CaptTenacity,3,Tue Jul 21 13:59:35 2015 UTC,The article makes it seem as though they believed him at first.
Marvel,3e2lot,Pokevenger,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:00 2015 UTC,You'd think that he wouldn't get pulled over with a flying car.
Marvel,3e2lot,Sanlear,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:20 2015 UTC,And yet... What if he is?
Marvel,3e2lot,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:14 2015 UTC,He failed a breath test. Should've popped a Tic Tac first.
Marvel,3e2lot,mentho-lyptus,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"""Drink-driving"", huh?"
Marvel,3e2lot,SkweezeDeez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:12 2015 UTC,What's goin on to the left there?
Marvel,3e1usp,OutspokenHindude,22,Tue Jul 21 08:49:34 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who's not clamoring for a Black Widow movie? The only reason I'd be excited is if Alexander Lukin is in it (played by Al Pacino) and we get to see his Red Skull alter ego.
Marvel,3e1usp,the1egend1ives,8,Tue Jul 21 13:47:28 2015 UTC,Just watch SALT and consider it a Black Widow prequel.
Marvel,3e1usp,DBHT14,3,Tue Jul 21 16:10:02 2015 UTC,Angelina has a better Russian accent anyway. Not sure why ScarJo's valley girl Black Widow doesn't bother anyone else.
Marvel,3e1usp,dietcopepsi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"I also really love for headcannon purposes including ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" as in the MCU with some good retro Cold War espionage.   Or replace Jack Ryan with a young Nick Fury and include Hunt for Red October."
Marvel,3e1usp,DBHT14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:58 2015 UTC,You literally don't know what a Valley Girl is if you're saying her Black Widow is like one.
Marvel,3e1usp,Tom-ocil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:49 2015 UTC,I think he just means American accent...possibly.
Marvel,3e1usp,calgil,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"Well, again, he'd have no idea what he's talking about."
Marvel,3e1usp,Tom-ocil,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:15:57 2015 UTC,Nope. It'll be the first MCU I won't see if they make it.
Marvel,3e1usp,WhatImMike,7,Tue Jul 21 14:34:24 2015 UTC,"You'd see it. Maybe not opening weekend, but you'd see it."
Marvel,3e1usp,VelcroKing,12,Tue Jul 21 16:01:15 2015 UTC,I would trade Quicksilver to come back and kill her. She is boring..
Marvel,3e1usp,agustin-barris,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:37 2015 UTC,The Black Widow circlejerk has gone on too long.
Marvel,3e1usp,Dane_J_Zone,3,Tue Jul 21 10:58:11 2015 UTC,"It's really more of a joke than a circlejerk. But it seems a little old - I mean, this would have been more funny if it came out two months ago."
Marvel,3e1usp,cheddarhead4,4,Tue Jul 21 12:50:07 2015 UTC,You kind of spoiled the point of the post with the title.
Marvel,3e1usp,MattJRice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Spider-man doesn't have a mysterious origin. There have been like 5 movie versions of it.
Marvel,3e1usp,dietcopepsi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:59 2015 UTC,*Two
Marvel,3e1usp,MrBlanch,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:51:46 2015 UTC,5 was a slight exaggeration to show how non-mysterious his background is.
Marvel,3e3ddx,Lox22,7,Tue Jul 21 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"Minor nitpick, he says he didn't play it that week, so he ALMOST won, but didn't."
Marvel,3e3ddx,CrackedOzy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:19 2015 UTC,True
Marvel,3e0j41,jcmendoza2,42,Tue Jul 21 00:48:39 2015 UTC,He actually did it again for Ant-man
Marvel,3e0j41,izzyv1990,25,Tue Jul 21 01:49:19 2015 UTC,The fact that Paul Rudd can keep a straight face the entire time for 15 years is just so absolutely amazing.
Marvel,3e0j41,RogueHelios,15,Tue Jul 21 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"That's why I loved all the marketing for Ant-Man. The ""ant sized"" trailers, posters, magazine covers, and even billboards are just that type of troll-ish humor. I like to think Paul Rudd's contract included him giving ideas to the marketing team."
Marvel,3e0j41,elguitarro,-14,Tue Jul 21 07:07:15 2015 UTC,Easy to keep yourself from smiling when something isn't funny.
Marvel,3e0j41,ranhalt,12,Tue Jul 21 14:54:24 2015 UTC,Thats probably why OP posted this in /r/Marvel
Marvel,3e0j41,__________-_-_______,32,Tue Jul 21 03:26:14 2015 UTC,"While probably most posters here know of this, my favorite is the paraplegic Olympian who did the same thing on Conan.."
Marvel,3e0j41,Holy_Balls_,11,Tue Jul 21 01:37:58 2015 UTC,She should have said the clip was of her attempt at Cliff Diving.
Marvel,3e0j41,the_one_true_b,11,Tue Jul 21 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"That's why I was so hyped for Paul going to Conan to promote Ant Man. I just love that guy and the troll ""ant"" trailers/posters were so Paul Rudd like. I really hope word-of-mouth helps this movie as some friends weren't planning on watching it until I insisted it was a good comedy/action movie."
Marvel,3e0j41,elguitarro,11,Tue Jul 21 02:24:19 2015 UTC,Dude Paul Rudd is a may-may master.
Marvel,3e0j41,Gironu,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:04 2015 UTC,This is great
Marvel,3e0j41,Wooaahh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:32 2015 UTC,Reddit has been posting these clips for 15 years it feels like.
Marvel,3e0j41,AttilanKing,0,Tue Jul 21 08:46:28 2015 UTC,"I wish he played the clip again, oh well the joke's gotta end somewhere :/"
Marvel,3e0j41,reddevilbat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:32 2015 UTC,Uh..
Marvel,3e0j41,elguitarro,3,Tue Jul 21 07:07:56 2015 UTC,"Dude, I was joking!"
Marvel,3e0j41,reddevilbat,0,Tue Jul 21 12:27:30 2015 UTC,"This is Reddit,  we don't joke around. Thought you would have learned this by now."
Marvel,3e0j41,elaks,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:50:37 2015 UTC,This is funny. I also don't really like Conan.
Marvel,3e2ncc,dokebibeats,3,Tue Jul 21 14:13:34 2015 UTC,Runaways is one of my favourite Marvel comics ever. It's so fantastic!  Glad to hear you discovered it and like it.
Marvel,3e2ncc,athzar,3,Tue Jul 21 15:30:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have the location connection but I also loved Runaways. I was a little apprehensive at first, it was recommended a lot but it looked at least from the covers as a children's comic.  But it was really very enjoyable. Really unique. So sad when I ran out of issues."
Marvel,3e2ncc,Indyfanforthesb,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"So good. It's probably my favorite Marvel comic. You probably want to stop when Joss Whedon ends his run at issue 30 of Volume 2. Runaways is Brian K Vaughan, and Whedon does a great job of continuing that for the six issues he wrote, but after that, it's not the Runaways anymore."
Marvel,3e2ncc,cheddarhead4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with this. Even the Whedon arc is a step down in quality, but after he leaves they completely lose the plot."
Marvel,3e2ncc,ajp0002,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"one of my all time favourite comics, so much so that ill read pretty much anything with niko, chase & co. in.  hope one day it gets a film adaptation because it would be awesome!"
Marvel,3e2ncc,nelsonio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"Same, I binge-read the first 15 issues or so in the first day I go them."
Marvel,3e2ncc,nimuymuynitantan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Man, no one ever sets a comic in anywhere near my hometown (unless you need a convenient cornfield in the middle of nowhere).  Although Hank Pym did once use the phrase ""Cornhusker humor."""
Marvel,3e2ncc,FlashbackJon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:46 2015 UTC,So you live in Smallville?
Marvel,3e2ncc,ColossusaurusRex8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Runaways is the bomb. And while LA has been a more-or-less recurring location in Marvel comics dating back to the 70s Werewolf by Night series, this is one of the few titles in which it is baked into the DNA of the series in a natural way."
Marvel,3e2fj2,The-MadTitan,6,Tue Jul 21 13:04:17 2015 UTC,"Got the girl though, mate."
Marvel,3e2fj2,bradimus_maximus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:59 2015 UTC,Did Thing ever show back up after turning into Ultimate Wonder Man?
Marvel,3e2fj2,KungFuWombat,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:38 2015 UTC,Woah...THAT'S what happened to him? I read about his transformation but didn't know that. I really need to get into reading Ultimate FF.
Marvel,3e2fj2,amidoingthisright19,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"They didnt CALL him wonderman, its just he was able to tranform and have the same glow as him he was still always the thing"
Marvel,3e2fj2,Maybe_2pac,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:35 2015 UTC,they tried to FLESH him out
Marvel,3e2fj2,Lighetto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:19 2015 UTC,"Looks like Greg Land's art. I've never read that comic, but pretty sure I've seen the Invisible Woman's face several times."
Marvel,3dzeop,1Voice1Life,45,Mon Jul 20 19:45:17 2015 UTC,They look kinda like very complicated bionicle.
Marvel,3dzeop,ScottWPilgrim,16,Mon Jul 20 21:32:58 2015 UTC,This is what a Michael Bay Marvel movie would look like.
Marvel,3dzeop,This_Aint_Dog,4,Tue Jul 21 01:21:56 2015 UTC,That was my first thought. They were kinda like early drafts of what Lego expected the Bionicles to look like.
Marvel,3dzeop,tedbosses,49,Tue Jul 21 01:13:14 2015 UTC,Ultron is kind of redundant.
Marvel,3dzeop,RepublicofTim,10,Mon Jul 20 23:39:11 2015 UTC,I was hoping the artist would just insert a normal picture of Ultron from Google
Marvel,3dzeop,kaptainrawr,2,Tue Jul 21 05:35:00 2015 UTC,Or just a picture of James Spader
Marvel,3dzeop,smileimhigh,33,Tue Jul 21 14:42:56 2015 UTC,They all look like Iron Man except Iron Man.
Marvel,3dzeop,potatotheory,28,Mon Jul 20 20:32:51 2015 UTC,Disappointed to not see an iron man in a tony suit
Marvel,3dzeop,antrobus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:44 2015 UTC,You just blew my mind.
Marvel,3dzeop,Demonoluck,12,Tue Jul 21 09:58:11 2015 UTC,"Link to the Ultron one on the artist's page, you can find the rest of them through here. There's actually a story behind these, basically Ultron wins and annihilates all life on earth, then becomes so bored  he creates machine versions of all the old heroes to fight, led by a sentient version of Tony Stark's old armor."
Marvel,3dzeop,chimpo470,10,Tue Jul 21 01:36:00 2015 UTC,Why is ultron a tree?
Marvel,3dzeop,addition,8,Mon Jul 20 22:34:24 2015 UTC,Robot + robot = tree
Marvel,3dzeop,bemorr,8,Tue Jul 21 04:45:48 2015 UTC,"Robots, or Final Fantasy summons?"
Marvel,3dzeop,underthegod,6,Mon Jul 20 22:54:19 2015 UTC,Too many spikes.
Marvel,3dzeop,DeusEverto,4,Mon Jul 20 22:32:28 2015 UTC,But... Ultron is already a robot?
Marvel,3dzeop,successadult,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:05 2015 UTC,And there's already a Doom Bot.
Marvel,3dzeop,insane_contin,5,Tue Jul 21 04:26:50 2015 UTC,"The design on these are too busy. Like the Michael Bay Transformers. Loki and Hulk fit the characters, but the rest don't."
Marvel,3dzeop,Mikeyd2tall,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:38 2015 UTC,These are cool!  Good work to whoever the artist is!
Marvel,3dzeop,alphasquid,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:35 2015 UTC,Should Ultron have just been a picture of Ultron?
Marvel,3dzeop,Psykerr,3,Tue Jul 21 03:34:09 2015 UTC,Took me a minute to realize that was Venoms other leg...
Marvel,3dzeop,Arillious,2,Tue Jul 21 03:35:49 2015 UTC,I love these. I actually used to work with the guy who made them. I've got a signed print of the avengers ones on my wall too
Marvel,3dzeop,ProtoJazz,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:40 2015 UTC,Captain America and Thor look tight as fuck.
Marvel,3dzeop,dokebibeats,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"They look like old lego toys that I use to play with, bionicle"
Marvel,3dzeop,JonathanL72,2,Tue Jul 21 05:02:05 2015 UTC,"Poor doom, that bot doesn't do him service."
Marvel,3dzeop,Shoreyo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:39 2015 UTC,It should have just been a picture of Doom Bot.

Marvel,3dzeop,tha_based_god,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:20 2015 UTC,Loki is a protoss and iron man is an archon.  Ultron is the eye of sauron building tower thing

Marvel,3e0itv,soulbreaker1418,53,Tue Jul 21 00:46:19 2015 UTC,"""krysten ritter is soooo good. and michael colter.  wait until you see michael colter. the casting of luke cage, in my opinion, and have said this to everyone behind the scenes, is as strong and spot on as the casting of tony stark. its probably the hardest to cast and they got it. perfect.""  Internal squealing!!!!"
Marvel,3e0itv,marcohtx,15,Tue Jul 21 01:04:54 2015 UTC,"i´ve been like 15 minutes like that, so much hype!"
Marvel,3e0itv,stormz96,8,Tue Jul 21 01:09:54 2015 UTC,I mean he'd really be the ultimate judge here. I'm such a huge Alias and Pulse fan and Krysten Ritter is awesome so I have such high hopes for this show. So hyped!!!
Marvel,3e0itv,youmonsterikill,17,Tue Jul 21 02:18:42 2015 UTC,"Wow. Great to hear this. Especially about Ritter and Colter. I was optimistic, but a little trepidatious about the casting. I had a similar reaction to daredevil, I loved it, and I was their toughest demographic, (Very critical and familiar with the source material.)"
Marvel,3e0itv,deadpa,11,Tue Jul 21 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"You're not their toughest demographic - maybe you'd be an outspoken critic but they don't consider that the ""toughest demographic""."
Marvel,3e0itv,youmonsterikill,16,Tue Jul 21 05:34:02 2015 UTC,"I guess ""hates comics, thinks netflix is a fishing rig"" would probably be their 'toughest' demographic. Nonetheless I was prepared to hate it, and they won me over."
Marvel,3e0itv,alianov,11,Tue Jul 21 05:59:42 2015 UTC,"This helped a lot, but IIRC he also does like the Ultimate Spider-Man TV show a lot, which is kinda mediocre compared to the last one they did.  So, take with maybe half a grain a salt? Still, very happy to hear this."
Marvel,3e0itv,electrodrone,4,Tue Jul 21 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"yeah it is not like he´s TV critic or an expert on the matter but he saying the scripts were great even before going to Netflix is a really good sign. About USP... i saw almost all of the 1st season(bad) and couldn´t care less honestly, like a few days ago got a video on youtube Spidy fighting Deadpool and it was so obvious they were clones personality wise that made me cringe"
Marvel,3e0itv,MavericksFan41,5,Tue Jul 21 04:18:10 2015 UTC,SO. MUCH. YES.
Marvel,3e0itv,BuckNekkid18,4,Tue Jul 21 02:32:26 2015 UTC,I'm glad Colter is rocking it. Got kind of sad when he was replaced for Halo 5
Marvel,3e0itv,MrWarMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"He didn't get replaced in Halo 5.  Edit: My bad. His voice got replaced, but they're still using his likeness, and mocap performance."
Marvel,3e0itv,BuckNekkid18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:31:08 2015 UTC,"That sucks, why'd they do that?"
Marvel,3e0itv,HalfBredGerman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:01 2015 UTC,Maybe his performance wasn't up to their standards. His voice acting was definitely off during the H2A cutscenes.
Marvel,3e0itv,zaj209,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:14 2015 UTC,I think it's easy to say that since he was going up with Keith David who is a pretty powerful figure in that universe.
Marvel,3e0itv,zaj209,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:44 2015 UTC,when does this come out?
Marvel,3e0itv,Kingshabaz,4,Tue Jul 21 05:42:42 2015 UTC,"any day now the production will end, so following the Daredevil schedule i can guess in 1/2 months we get posters and a teaser, and 3 or 4 months later the series is released so around late november/early december"
Marvel,3e0itv,alianov,2,Tue Jul 21 05:46:10 2015 UTC,Thank you! have to admit I am hyped for this after seeing dare devil and ant man!
Marvel,3e0itv,Kingshabaz,2,Tue Jul 21 05:55:24 2015 UTC,I haven't read Bendis' work with Jessica Jones. Was it Alias?
Marvel,3e0itv,alianov,8,Tue Jul 21 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he created the character in the pages of Alias, and then wrote pretty much all of her significant appearances afterwards in The Pulse and New Avengers. At this point, maybe only Al Ewing and one or two other people that aren't Bendis have even written dialogue for her."
Marvel,3e0itv,Screecher12,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:10 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of Pulse, is that good as well?"
Marvel,3e0itv,ksaid1,8,Tue Jul 21 04:01:24 2015 UTC,"The Pulse starts out as a kind of interesting journalism comic, and then it becomes a hard-to-follow Secret War (2004) tie-in, and then ends as a nice epilogue about Jessica Jones' personal life. It suffers at the beginning from having such a different art style and audience from Alias, but it works as a nice happy ending affixed to the end of it.  What you should absolutely definitely without a doubt read is Alias, which is best thing Bendis has written for Marvel next to Daredevil."
Marvel,3e0itv,Ronocm13,4,Tue Jul 21 04:12:29 2015 UTC,"i´m reading Alias right now,i´m not sure i like the art that much(weird women faces specially) except the astonishing coloring, but oh man this is amazing,she is an incredibly complex,relatable character that gives you a new perspective in how the heroes live, their relationships and doubts, and more important, how the society sees them from the ground.  My favorite case till now is the Rick Jones one, one of the best meta commentaries i´ve ever seen in any medium"
Marvel,3e0itv,Ronocm13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:39:00 2015 UTC,"yes sir, that one and the pulse plus Bendis´s run on Avengers(or secret Avengers? i don´t remember) when she was a member for a while"

Marvel,3e1n9v,mercado1121,10,Tue Jul 21 07:06:23 2015 UTC,"As posted by another redditor, it should just be him retelling previous marvel events in the same way he did in the movie."
Marvel,3e1n9v,kw1nn,6,Tue Jul 21 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how long that joke could be sustained, but I would read every page.  Edit: Make it like Drunk History. I'd be all over that."
Marvel,3e1n9v,one4jj,9,Tue Jul 21 16:50:54 2015 UTC,I could see Luis becoming a supporting character post-Secret Wars.
Marvel,3e1n9v,supahmonkey,3,Tue Jul 21 15:45:26 2015 UTC,I'd buy it so fast...
Marvel,3e12b6,danielmilutin,12,Tue Jul 21 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"This is a little concerning to me. If they can find a way to organically foreshadow Thor: Ragnarok, then okay, fair enough. What I'm worried about is that this 'tease' will be like AoU, where the tease resulted in an abrupt detour in the movie to a scene that basically screams setup, adding nothing to the current movie, and hurting it overall. TWS was fantastic because it felt extremely self-contained; I'd prefer to see Civil War be a similarly constructed movie without forcing references to future films."
Marvel,3e12b6,fractionesque,10,Tue Jul 21 09:47:34 2015 UTC,Post Credit scenes are mostly used to tease next movies.
Marvel,3e12b6,ChocoboTorchicKid,2,Tue Jul 21 11:34:56 2015 UTC,I honestly hope this is the case and if it is within the movie just do something subtle.
Marvel,3e12b6,NovaStarLord,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"I hope that in the long run, that detour will end up being worth it and pretty cool. Life doesn't happen one segment at a time, I like when comics follow that premise.   The trick is that the payoff has to be worth it. I liked Thor, but only tolerated parts of the dark world. If they want to have a truly badass Thor film for ragnarok, the comedic relief needs to be dialed back (looking at you Kat Dennings). The audiences needs to feel like this is actually the end of the days for the Asgards and there need to be real consequences. I like Thor and Chris H, but he should probably get the Iron Man treatment and ""die""...maybe until Infinity Wars pt. 2."
Marvel,3e12b6,Rowdy10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Thor ""dying"" thing might have worked better if they did Ragnarok before Civil War.  IIRC everyone thought Thor was dead in the Civil War comics as well."
Marvel,3e12b6,TheDude415,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah in the comics, [spoilers: comic version of Civil War] someone built a life model decoy of Thor and it went crazy and killed some characters.   I don't expect to see much of Thor in Civil War and I hope the explanation is that he's dealing with the end of times.   [spoilers: age of ultron film] The reason I don't expect to see Thor is that he's too powerful. Removing him and the other most powerful character we currently have (Hulk at the end of AoU) brings the fight to a level where Falcon, Black Widow, and all of the other non-god tier characters can interact without us thinking ""why doesn't Thor just strike them all with lightning?"""
Marvel,3e12b6,Rowdy10,9,Tue Jul 21 16:18:25 2015 UTC,Does anyone else find the Thor movies not all that enjoyable?
Marvel,3e12b6,dabumtsss,12,Tue Jul 21 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"I like them, though mostly for aesthetic reasons. Asgard is beautiful and I like seeing all the mythological shit. They're also good to bring girls to lol."
Marvel,3e12b6,YepImanEmokid,15,Tue Jul 21 06:58:17 2015 UTC,"I actually really like the first one. It gets better on every viewing.  But I feel the opposite for The Dark World, which gets worse each time."
Marvel,3e12b6,7ephyr,10,Tue Jul 21 05:59:18 2015 UTC,"Thor is my favorite Phase One movie, hands down.   The Dark World isn't terrible, and I've actually come to enjoy it a lot more. I had such high expectations for it going in (because, as I said, the first was my favorite Marvel film to date), so I was let down at first, but whenever I catch it on Starz now, I really enjoy it."
Marvel,3e12b6,thewisefoolHHH,6,Tue Jul 21 06:27:12 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I really like the first one. The second one had so much potential. Just a super un-interesting villain.
Marvel,3e12b6,ABerko15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:50 2015 UTC,"I saw the first one, and haven't seen it since. Now that I think back to it though, it seems to be better. I tried to rewatch dark world and couldn't even get through the first half hour."
Marvel,3e12b6,dabumtsss,3,Tue Jul 21 06:24:56 2015 UTC,"I found the first one to be very enjoyable. Even though, in hindsight, it has a ton of problems.  The second one, on the other hand, isn't nearly as fun to watch. Despite the fact that on it's an all-around better movie on paper."
Marvel,3e12b6,the1egend1ives,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Then again, I never really liked Thor in comics either. I don't know why but he just felt out of place. You have a dude that shoots webs, a dude with iron claws, a dude with a high tech armor, a dude that can burst into flames and then a fucking Norse God. I understand there are a lot of other gods / beings in Marvel but the whole Norse thing with Loki, Thor and stuff just felt out of place. But that's just me and my opinion though."
Marvel,3e12b6,greenmask,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:50 2015 UTC,"I've honestly never seen a whole film. My dad watches them from time to time whenever they are on The Movie Network but I haven't given them time. I'm just not a fan of mythology in general, that's why I don't care for his backstory at all.  I might change that though. I think Hemsworth is probably a perfect Thor by looks."
Marvel,3e12b6,Cootch,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:41 2015 UTC,"He is. He does a great job of it too, as does Loki, but they're sadly (imo) in really mediocre movies. We'll see how Ragnorak is though."
Marvel,3e12b6,dabumtsss,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:52 2015 UTC,I think the Thor is (after the first Captain America) the worst MCU movie. (those two are the only ones I don't like)  But The Dark World was great.
Marvel,3e12b6,Jax_Harkness,8,Tue Jul 21 08:17:19 2015 UTC,"On an aside, My respect for the first Captain America went up after TWS came out.    I look at CA1 as an investment.  He kinda had a boring origin story blahblahblahblah... but then you pull him out of that and he becomes an infinitely more interesting character.  The way he contrasts with SHIELD during TWS was perfect and Cap 1 needed to be a time investment for TWS to have worked as well as it did.   It probably could have been better and Red Skull could have been a little less forgettable (but that's hard given that he was created literally to be a bad guy with a red skull), but it's exactly what it needed to be to allow Cap to move into the modern world and be who he really is."
Marvel,3e12b6,RoyAwesome,5,Tue Jul 21 10:08:03 2015 UTC,"I actually quite enjoyed the first Cap movie, but that's largely because of my love for movies with Nazis getting punched.  Having said that, I feel like they could have done more with Red Skull.  There's almost not even really a battle at the end."
Marvel,3e12b6,TheDude415,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:17 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed CATFA for the Spielbergian vibe. I didn't watch it until after Iron Man 3, but when I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was like a cheesy 80s movie with a nice message, good dialogue and characters, entertaining actors and an interesting story. Red Skull wasn't great and the action is hardly memorable, but overall, it's very enjoyable."

Basically there's a magical artifact similar to the siege perilous. Since it was supposed to have long lasting effects, some characters who received stronger abilities from the mirror kept them. IIRC Beast, Gamora, Young Angel, Young Iceman, Young Cyclops, Groot, Kitty Pryde, Ronan the Accuser, and I thiiiiink Nova all received cosmic powers, but only Kitty Pryde, Groot, Gamora, and Young Angel kept them.

Marvel,3dyo5u,Nejfelt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it has been directly stated from Marvel, but I think the general feeling is there won't be any TV show characters appearing in the movies.  Coulson was the exception but since he ""died"" in the movies he's been absent from them. Plus there were no TV shows before then.  The other way around is possible.  It might have been Feige who stated he didn't want movie going public to be confused if they didn't watch the shows.  Now to me this is going to do one of two things:  The movies and tv shows will each be in their own corners of the MCU.  Or eventually this will have to be addressed in the movies somehow.  But for Civil War I would put good money on not a single tv character appearing.  Inhumans is going to also test this relationship, though I could see the movie being about the first family and not even referring AOS characters. Which would be really weird."

Marvel,3e2rbe,Garntus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"Power Gem (Red) - Grants its wielder increased strength and durability, and enhances virtually any superhuman ability.  Time Gem (Orange) - Allows its wielder to manipulate time freely, slowing time or speeding it up, traveling through time, seeing into the past or the future and accelerating or slowing down ageing.  Space Gem (Purple) - Allows its wielder the ability to teleport freely and is able to alter the motion of other objects.  Soul Gem (Green) - Allows its wielder to observe, steal or attack a being's soul or spirit, and can also be used to revert individuals to their ""natural"" state.   Mind Gem (Blue) - Grants its wielder near-limitless psionic powers, such as empathy, telepathy and telekinesis.   Reality Gem (Yellow) - Allows its wielder to freely alter all of reality, bending it to their whim.

If it DOES do well, then Marvel is truly untouchable for not even trying and finding success."
Marvel,3dym69,dpgaspard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Marvel was still trying. They've definitely promoting the movie, but obviously they're not gonna promote it as much as they would a bigger blockbuster like Age of Ultron. The two movies will never have the same priority at Marvel Studios, doesn't mean they weren't trying, and claiming they weren't is just to further the Marvel Studios circlejerk about how untouchable they are."

Marvel,3e297q,TitusAquilinus,3,Tue Jul 21 12:01:31 2015 UTC,"So, I just saw this link and it confirmed something I have suspected for a while. If Sif is getting an increased role, then I feel that Thor: Ragnarok is most likely heading into the Death of Odin/Thor Disassembled realm. Personally, I think this would be awesome, as Civil War will massively shake up the Earth-based heroes, so it makes sense that Asgard would get the shake-up too. That sets the stage for the Avengers to be spread to the winds by the time of Infinity War 1, forcing them to come back together, possibly too late, therefore leading into Infinity War 2.  Anyone else excited to see Thor pluck out his own eyes on screen?"
Marvel,3e297q,nottherealstanlee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:30 2015 UTC,"I mean it's called Ragnarok right?? I'm thinking it's not as cataclysmic as the actual comic where you basically hit the reset button on Asgard. I DO think though that it'll take him out of the equation on Earth for a while and leave a gaping hole in the team. When Infinity Wars 1 comes around he'll be out of the picture I think...  As for Sif, I bet she dies or loses her arm or something."
Marvel,3e297q,Carlosdanger15,0,Tue Jul 21 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"I think ""critical condition"" is a stretch, but I believe the Thor franchise is the perfect case study of why an increasingly larger group of people are growing frustrated with Marvel. The first Thor was for all intents and purposes a lot of set up, and The Dark World is probably the most formulaic movie in the MCU  (Guy named Chris + generic villain + macguffin + CGI galore = over half a billion in box office receipts and a sequel). I like Chris Hemsworth and I think he's under-appreciated in the MCU, but the movies just need to learn to stand on their own. Maybe Ragnarok will be the one to change that."

Marvel,3e1y8d,Xecron050,3,Tue Jul 21 09:35:50 2015 UTC,"According to Incredible Hulk #388, a comic published in 1991, he is effectively immune to disease caused by microbes.  http://www.incrediblehulkonline.com/immunehealth.jpg  His body also recovers very quickly from physical injury, which means that certain other diseases would probably have minimal effect. However, ""disease"" is a very broad category of things, so it depends on what you count as ""all disease."" In 2000 or so, he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's Disease (he got better), so he's clearly not immune to all forms of disease.  Minor tertiary powers are the sort of thing that tends to fall out of continuity, so I would not be at all surprised if there are later examples of Hulk suffering from some disease or another at some point.

Marvel,3dz1ze,lordtyp0,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:55 2015 UTC,I don't think so. This was the early seventies. Before comic shops. My understanding was that unsold copies got returned to the distributors. They cut off half of the cover and sold them at a discount.   Anyone know for sure?

Marvel,3e0hr6,LibraryDrone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:40 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you mean. They can't completely continue since they take place on Battleworld and Battleworld is gone after Secret Wars.
Marvel,3e0fdx,Nova-Six,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't found an app that includes price. What I recommend is doing a search on the series on http://comicbookrealm.com/ Keep in mind that the site doesn't price books lower than cover. So basically when you come across a book that's close to cover price, figure it would sell in a wholesale bin ($0.25-1). It's not what you're looking for, but it's the fastest way I've found for pricing out large quantities fairly fast. At least this way you can look at the prices of an entire series instead of one at a time."
Marvel,3dyvha,didntexpectTheBeard,6,Mon Jul 20 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"It's a longer path, but Ed Brubaker's Captain America is not only excellent inn it's own right, but also serves as the primary inspiration for First Avenger, Winter Soldier, and presumably a decent bit of Civil War. It runs through and past Civil War, and outside of the main event is probably the most crucial reading for the era."
Marvel,3dyvha,TARDISd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know there are a lot of stories that run parallel to Civil War, which I will get to eventually, I'm just looking for a wide view of the situation if that makes any sense. Like I know House of M splits off to Son of M or something, but I just want to get the general gist of the situation at hand (I only read House of M because it gets mentioned in Road to Civil War)  Thank you for your input though, I'll keep that in the back of my mind and will eventually get to it all."
Marvel,3dyvha,TARDISd,4,Mon Jul 20 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"The trouble is that outside of the main event, most tie-ins are centered around individual characters or teams with their own stories that are/were running alongside Civil War, so you're generally not going to find one book with a cohesive overview.   I'd suggest looking into Marvel Unlimited, maybe. I know it's a cop-out suggestion, but if you just want to read the stories it's your cheapest option by far, and if it's still active, there is a promo for one month for one cent with promo code PENNY."
Marvel,3dyvha,tcooker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know its a tough question to answer, thanks for trying though. I guess I could have worded it a different way, I'm really just looking for graphic novels that come after Civil War that are in the same universe.  I'll take a look at Marvel Unlimited since I would like to really get into comics but I always get overwhelmed.  P.S. Can we just say screw whoever decided to add those ants to the marvel unlimited website."
Marvel,3dyy9e,AlphaTyrant,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that story line isn't done.  Hank mumbles something like ""could it really be?"" If that line hadn't been there I would say it was over but Marvel wouldn't use that line if there wasn't a reason."
Marvel,3dyy9e,jdinger29,3,Tue Jul 21 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be the guy that says she's dead. Pyms time is over and now it's Hope and Scott's time to take up the mantles of Antman and Wasp.   I do think it was Wasp in some form in the Quantum Zone, but for her to come back would defeat the purpose of Pym passing the torch."
Marvel,3dyy9e,WhatImMike,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"Her coming back doesn't have to be about Hank. It will obviously affect him and we'll see that, but it will be more about her and her state and reaction to having been trapped for decades. Not to mention Hope's relationship with her suddenly-returned (probably young) mother."
Marvel,3dyy9e,LochNessMonocle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"I think it was Janet, the silhouette looked more winged than caped, and at a quick glance much like her suit when she disappeared. With Hank Pym remarking about how Scott got back from the Quantum Realm (Microverse) I'm sure a sequel would dive into that exact idea, rescuing her.  My theory/idea for a sequel would be as follows:  Following the events of Civil War, while the new Wasp (Hope) and Ant-Man (Scott) are distracted with the battle(s), Hank uses this time to work on another suit and go to the Quantum Realm (Microverse) on his own. Hope comes home to find her father missing, seemingly for weeks, but finds clues that he's been working on a new suit and Quantum Realm research.  Figuring out that he clearly went to the Quantum Realm, Hope asks Scott for help finding her father, so they both travel to the Quantum Realm. Once there they now discover a whole other universe (Microverse) present there, full of many dangers. Also Janet hasn't aged a day since she disappeared."
Marvel,3dyy9e,Vegeton,0,Mon Jul 20 22:47:04 2015 UTC,I like that. You know that scene when Cross is in the Pym house and picks up that picture of what's implied to be Janet? Do you think that's the actress they'd use?
Marvel,3dyy9e,Vegeton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:21 2015 UTC,They'd likely cast a relatively known actress for Janet (though I doubt it'd be Catherine Zeta-Jones).
Marvel,3dyy9e,cheddarhead4,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think she's dead. I don't think it was too much of a loose end.

Marvel,3dyy9e,WhatImMike,0,Mon Jul 20 20:41:36 2015 UTC,It's the Negative Zone but Fox owns it so they had to rename it.

Marvel,3dz6qi,papagator521,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"If we're talking MCU specifically, I would say it's a tie between Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. If it's any Marvel property movie, it's s tie between the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man films. They do look pretty dated now, but I was about 5 and 6 when those movies came out, so the nostalgia alone makes me forget about the early 2000's special effects. Seeing Spidey swing across the sky was awesome and unforgettable! I grew up with those movies, and I feel like I would've never gotten into comics if it weren't for them!"
Marvel,3dz6qi,ace22nd,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:04 2015 UTC,They had great story's and villains. Spider-Man 2 is IMO the goal for a superhero movie sequel. It is the highest rated marvel movie adaptation ever according to Metacritic

Tony is so sarcastic and narcissistic and I love it.  Guardians was hilarious and so original, like nothing we've seen before. Even though it had a very weak villain the Heroes were amazingly developed and I felt for every one.  Winter Soldier blew my mind, surprised me and had me on the edge of my seat. I don't care what people on r/movies say. It was a political thriller and I loved it.  Ant-Man was also hilarious but a completely different kind of humor than what we've seen. I liked the heist feel to it and its effects were top notch. It'll be a shame if it doesn't do well in the box office.  Avengers. Just the word alone would give me chills back before it came out. The idea that all these movies connected was amazing, and it happened. Seeing them all together at odds and then fighting side by side was amazing."

Marvel,3e0pxo,kylesleeps,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"It has Coulson, Agent May, Fitz and Simmons. Quake and Mockingbird are spotlighted in a couple of recent/upcoming issues. Yes it does. The comic is basically Marvel Team-Up with Coulson and the hero/heroes of the week, so you see a good sampling of other characters like Sue Storm, Dr. Strange, Ms. Marvel, etc. They have the same character voices. Waid has given Coulson and Simmons backstories and motivations that are specific to 616 but in the spirit of the TV characters. SHIELD is continuing in its pre-Secret Wars timeframe until November, and then it'll be relaunched as Agents of SHIELD #1 with Marc Guggenheim as the writer. (Now isn't that funny - Arrow's showrunner writing the AoS tie-in comic!) That's a tough question - I think opinions on the comic are fairly mixed, but being a fan of the show certainly helps. I think the Ms. Marvel, Invisible Woman, and Scarlet Witch issues are probably the strongest, but I'm not super keen on the rest. I would definitely give it a look if you watch the show, though.   You'll also probably be interested to know about the SHIELD 50th anniversary one-shots coming out this September; there's one for Nick Fury (a team-up with Sr. and Jr.), The Cavalry (May), Quake, Mockingbird, and Agent Carter (Peggy, not Sharon)."

Example, Josh Tranks new FF4, as 26 upvotes, Spider-Man 3 has -3. Like really people?"

Marvel,3duoik,MichaeljBerry,9,Sun Jul 19 17:52:48 2015 UTC,I really loved that Doom. I still have the 12 inch figure somewhere. Ya besides the Thing those movies were dope. Also it shows how great of an actor Chris Evans is. Wish they would have made a third.
Marvel,3duoik,CamTheGringo,8,Sun Jul 19 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"Chris Evans always does absolutely amazing in films based off comic books even if the movies themselves aren't stellar.

Marvel,3duoik,AdrianIsBeast,2,Mon Jul 20 01:15:29 2015 UTC,Ya he really is a great actor. I really liked that movie he was in about the end of the world where everyone lived in a train. Dude can act!
Marvel,3duoik,CamTheGringo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:21 2015 UTC,His 2nd suit was more like the comic but it was stuck in a bad movie. Really the issue is they keep trying to make Doom an origin story.

If anybody can wear a giant undetailed metal suit including face mask and just a cloak and actually look bad ass it's Doom.

Marvel,3dyg3n,HelperBot_,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"It's a great book in that it shows the Jean Grey School characters, but it's mostly about the kids who go there (Quentin Quire, Kid Gladiator, Shark Girl, etc.) and their interactions with Wolverine. Jason Aaron's actual Wolverine run, which is more about Wolverine and is also really good but for different reasons, includes a Wolverine v3 arc, Get Mystique, a miniseries called Wolverine- Manifest Destiny, all of Wolverine- Weapon X (an ongoing that takes place between Wolverine v3 and v4) and most of Wolverine v4, another ongoing that takes place right before Wolverine v5 (not by Aaron), the one where he loses his healing factor."

Marvel,3dyque,SteadyRockin44,2,Mon Jul 20 16:57:42 2015 UTC,"The funny thing about the cartoon is that the story arcs mostly came from X-Men stories from the 80s. I would recommend jumping on at the early beginning of the Dark Phoenix Saga in 1980 with Uncanny X-Men #129 and reading from there through to the first introductions of Apocalypse and Sinister that happened later. There's a lot of good stuff there.  The cheapest, easiest way to read all this is Marvel's digital subscription service, Marvel Unlimited. It costs $10/month or $70/year and it's got every issue of Uncanny X-Men on it.  Also, if you like podcasts, you should check out Rachel and Miles X-Plain the X-Men, which is going through the whole history of the X-Men and it's really well done."

Marvel,3dv726,leper3213,14,Sun Jul 19 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"Basically the journalist equivalent of his character in Whiplash, then.  Minus throwing chairs at Peter."
Marvel,3dv726,weblewit,6,Mon Jul 20 06:46:15 2015 UTC,That is actually pretty bloody brilliant.
Marvel,3dv726,FilteringShit,3,Mon Jul 20 08:15:46 2015 UTC,Where is this from?
Marvel,3dv726,Ciocana,24,Sun Jul 19 23:59:53 2015 UTC,4chan.
Marvel,3dv726,SadisticBuddha,98,Mon Jul 20 00:08:09 2015 UTC,I thought it was implied that he was the hero of the movie. He was the only one warning people of that spider menace.
Marvel,3dv726,Thebeardedragon,47,Sun Jul 19 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"Jameson's motivations have gone back and forth, but I think the general belief is he A) just wants to sell papers and going the Fox News character-assassination approach sells papers, and B) he's not stupid, he recognizes that Spider-Man is young and he is rightly afraid that young people will try to emulate him to their risk."
Marvel,3dv726,Snakeoilsage,33,Sun Jul 19 20:51:20 2015 UTC,A popular characterization is also that he genuinely believes Spider-man shouldn't be taking the law into his own hands - he's been hard on vigilantes overall.
Marvel,3dv726,Ahesterd,11,Sun Jul 19 23:49:06 2015 UTC,Also true. You know it would be kind of interesting to see him played as the righteous Jim Gordon to Spidey's Batman. That would be a neat twist.
Marvel,3dv726,Snakeoilsage,8,Mon Jul 20 00:07:52 2015 UTC,You should read Ultimate Spider-Man then.
Marvel,3dv726,suss2it,3,Mon Jul 20 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"I do remember him being more supportive of Spider-Man. I never got into Ultimate Spider-Man very deeply though, as I just was never a very big fan of the Ultimate line."
Marvel,3dv726,Snakeoilsage,5,Mon Jul 20 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"Ultimate Spider-Man is really like the rest of the ultimate line, you should give it a try if you're a fan of Spider-Man. Some of the best Spidey stories in the last decade are in that run. And JJJ starts off hating Spider-Man like in the regular Marvel U but after he sees him saving a bunch of people's lives during a crisis his opinion changes."
Marvel,3dv726,suss2it,15,Mon Jul 20 05:12:52 2015 UTC,Apparently Jameson's first wife was killed by a masked mugger/house intruder.   So he is vehemently distrustful of anybody who wears a mask.
Marvel,3dv726,XMenOrangesTangerine,2,Mon Jul 20 01:22:16 2015 UTC,she went out like uncle ben
Marvel,3dv726,Maybe_2pac,4,Mon Jul 20 13:39:47 2015 UTC,"I also really enjoyed the professionalism in that high pressure situation. As a journalist, he refuses to give up his source and that is commendable. His actions showed he had grit and a code. Probably what got him that position in the first place."
Marvel,3dv726,I_film_stuff,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:47 2015 UTC,"That was a nice character trait there. JJJ is an old reporter. He predates the Fox News and tabloid sensationalism for sales monopoly on the journalism industry (not to say it wasn't always there, but not always the dominant force). It's such an ingrained part of him that it is just reflex now. Apply pressure to him and he reverts back on that instinctual reflex to never give up sources."
Marvel,3dv726,Hraesvelg7,13,Mon Jul 20 12:48:58 2015 UTC,"When written correctly Jameson can be very nuanced. I had a free month of Marvel Unlimited that I used to read the as much as I could of the original Amazing Spider-Man run and got to around 112 (give or take) issues. I found that often Jameson was boring and one-dimensional. More recent comics really try to flesh out his character and despite the hate for Dan Slott, I love what he's done with Jameson.   One of my favorite incarnations of Jameson is from the Spectacular Spider-Man animated series because it gives him heroic moments, and shows how much he cares for the staff and integrity of the Daily Bugle."
Marvel,3dv726,Jazzimusprime,3,Mon Jul 20 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"I've long wished for a Daily Bugle TV series. It's a simple set, no need for big names, action pieces or CG, though we'd all love J.K. Simmons at any cost. There's a wealth of character exploration to be done with Jameson as an old-time reporter struggling to adapt to a new style that he doesn't respect, a world that is gradually abandoning his print industry, his divided motivations between sales and integrity, his clear hopes to groom a replacement to continue his legacy, etc. Then there's the rest of the staff, a mix of veterans and younger people trying to move the business into the future.   We've already seen how well Ben Urich translated in Daredevil. A show perhaps partly based on the Marvels comic series alongside that Daredevil style would be cheap enough for TV, but consistently relevant to every new Marvel movie and other show."
Marvel,3dv726,Hraesvelg7,2,Mon Jul 20 13:04:25 2015 UTC,"Wow. I never knew I wanted this. The great thing about the Daily Bugle is the employees can be just as interesting as Jameson himself. There's Betty Brandt, Ben Urich, Ned Leeds, Robbie Robertson, etc."

Marvel,3dv726,FamilyGuyGuy7,5,Sun Jul 19 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget J.J. is an old school news man, a journalist... the kind of journalist that will go to jail for contempt because he won't divulge a source to a court of law. Plus he's pretty mercenary, if Parker is killed by ole' Gobbie he can't get any more pictures for his paper."
Marvel,3dv726,Jimbonosarembo,4,Mon Jul 20 02:43:52 2015 UTC,I just realized something. How does GG not know? Any credible paper sites its sources.
Marvel,3dv726,AUGUST_BURNS_REDDIT,5,Mon Jul 20 01:55:57 2015 UTC,"Probably credits as ""staff photographer"""
Marvel,3dv726,r2vq,3,Mon Jul 20 02:49:46 2015 UTC,Hmmmm sometimes Other times he uses giant robotic spiders and massive robot men with his face on them to try to kill Spider-man in pure hate It can go either way He's better than DB at least
Marvel,3dv726,apocalypse_meow2,2,Mon Jul 20 04:40:17 2015 UTC,What comic issue is this from?
Marvel,3dv726,heyman0,8,Sun Jul 19 21:20:06 2015 UTC,First raimi movie
Marvel,3dv726,Raffit,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"It's also in Ultimate Spider-Man, don't remember which issue though"
Marvel,3dv726,lovalin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Well, in the 1990's Spider-Man, JJJ joined forces with Norman Osborne, Wilson Fisk, Smythe, and other crime bosses to put an end to Spidey even if it would entail killing the latter."
Marvel,3dv726,qpaenumw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:48 2015 UTC,He's not heroic.  But it does have integrity.
Marvel,3dv726,Dealthagar,0,Mon Jul 20 16:30:12 2015 UTC,This is pretty hyperbolic and reductionist. How many lives did Jameson save? One? How many has Spidey saved? Countless on screen alone.
Marvel,3dziwb,50_shades_of_clay,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:39 2015 UTC,"You definitely get a new box each year. The AOU box just came out in April or May, so I'm pretty sure you'll still get that for awhile. I started my MUP in April hoping to get the Rocket package. Was disappointed to get the AOU stuff,but sold it on eBay and paid for most of this year's cost."
Marvel,3dziwb,rzneader,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the movie or comic AoU? I can only find the rocket and Ultron stuff online, but it says AoU was for 2013/2014."

Marvel,3dzdyi,eastcoastshocker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. Some variants were just marketing gimmicks which were artificially inflated before even getting released, so make sure to shop around if you're getting into collecting. Also, certain artists are just simply cooler than others, so keep that in mind :)"
Marvel,3dvret,IanMazgelis,72,Sun Jul 19 22:58:57 2015 UTC,You don't want it to be good so you have a good movie to watch? You've got strange priorities.
Marvel,3dvret,TARDISd,6,Sun Jul 19 23:01:41 2015 UTC,"i actually respect his priorities.  mass schadenfreude is something i can get behind.  that said, i'm not talking about it.  i rarely mention it.  i'm just quietly wishing ill upon this film."
Marvel,3dvret,thikthird,2,Mon Jul 20 05:43:16 2015 UTC,It is kinda fun to just sit back and watch. I just can't help myself sometimes.
Marvel,3dvret,TARDISd,-51,Mon Jul 20 05:53:03 2015 UTC,"There's no denying I'll enjoy quality, but watching everybody try to act like they were behind it since day one would be more satisfying"
Marvel,3dvret,TARDISd,44,Sun Jul 19 23:04:58 2015 UTC,"I'll put it this way - for many of us that are fans of the comic book F4, Fox has failed pretty miserably twice already in making a quality film adaptation, and for us there's little that has been shown or otherwise revealed about this new version to give hope that they've finally figured it out. The trailers are increasingly cringe-worthy for many of us, and the tone is off.  Now, these are things that are not universal, and everyone likes what they like. Some people are excited for F4, but many of us that know the comics better see plenty in this new one to cause concern over how these characters are being reinvented.   Personally, I'm hoping for a pleasant surprise, but not really expecting one."
Marvel,3dvret,FlatTire2005,5,Sun Jul 19 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"Three times, wasn't it? The 90s version."

Marvel,3dvret,TheEpicEdge,-7,Tue Jul 21 15:47:50 2015 UTC,What 90s version? I'm sure you're mistaken as the 2005 film was the first one.

I want a good film first before concerning myself if it lifts from the source material 100%. Variation, I think, keeps people interested too, otherwise a person could just pick up the comic. Plus, this is Ultimate FF inspired. Overall, I'm excited for this next installment. I hope Fox can keep on delivering after First Class and DOFP"

Marvel,3dvret,TimDawgz,10,Mon Jul 20 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"I feel thats exactly what happened with TASM 1 and 2, there saw how much the trailers gave away, got pissy because the trailers were shit then went it to watch it with an already made opinion of the movie.

Marvel,3dvret,ItsNotAPhaseDad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"SM3's script was a clusterfuck that tried to be four movies at once. ASM2's script was a clusterfuck that tried to be five movies at once. If nothing else SM3 resolved Sandman and Harry's plot, the only plot ASM2 resolved was Gwen's. 2/3 > 1/4  I honestly don't know how you can say ASM2 had an amazing love story while SM3 had a shit one considering the love story in every single Spider-Man movie is the same. Peter and Love Interest are into each other but they have relationship problems that pull them away from each other but they get together at the end anyway. The only difference is that in ASM2"

Marvel,3dvret,spidersting,44,Mon Jul 20 11:16:04 2015 UTC,"Whether it is good or not doesn't matter to me. I just want the rights to be with Marvel Studios. The Fantastic Four are not called ""Marvel's First Family"" for nothing."
Marvel,3dvret,Africanfratboy,4,Sun Jul 19 23:45:16 2015 UTC,"The honest to god truth is that the Fantastic Four work the absolute best when they're able to be in a shared universe. There's a reason the Marvel Universe was built up around them. Check out the earliest issues - they helped with the Hulk, Reed conversed with Xavier, Spider-Man came to them for a job - they helped build the Marvel Universe because they're those kind of characters. They set up framework for cosmic threats and universal concepts, they introduce characters that are major players in the grand scheme of things. It carries through to this day - Hickman used the FF to set the stage for Secret Wars.  Personally, I feel that being in a shared universe is just best for those characters and the stories that it would allow the MCU to tell, much more than they would be able to on their own and headed by Fox. This isn't a studio war, it's just where the best place for the characters is in the long run. FF can do so much more in the MCU than they could do by their own, with Fox."
Marvel,3dvret,JangoSky,-42,Mon Jul 20 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"I really don't care about Disney getting the rights instead of Fox. I really think the past few years they've been on the ball, and that Days of Future Past was better than most of Disney's Marvel movies, and First Class was at the very least on par. The Wolverine wasn't that bad either"
Marvel,3dvret,Africanfratboy,6,Sun Jul 19 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"When it comes to stuff with the X-Men, I prefer Fox keeping the rights just because them coming to the MCU will be a little too much. I wouldn't say Days Of Future Past was better than most, but it was better than some. As for First Class, I didn't like it because it didn't feel like X-Men to me. Maybe it's just me not liking the continuity errors in the series."
Marvel,3dvret,JangoSky,-15,Sun Jul 19 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"I really think First Class was the most X-Men movie, and I think it'd be pretty easy (granted not necessary) to integrate the X-Men into the MCU"
Marvel,3dvret,Africanfratboy,10,Mon Jul 20 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't. Bringing Xmen into the MCU would create the same logic problem the Xmen are having in the comics. Why do civilians hate mutants but not other super powered people? They can't tell them apart so it doesnt make sense. The Xmen are better left to their own devices and the MCU is better off not having them in it."
Marvel,3dvret,Africanfratboy,2,Mon Jul 20 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"While I agree the X-Men would be hard to integrate into the MCU at this point, I think if they had started out with the MCU it wouldn't be completely illogical that mutants are feared. The superheroes are few and far between but they're also (hopefully) still recognized for how powerful they are. They're not perceived as being ""the norm"", and not even the Inhumans can play that role in terms of natural development. It's the fear of the unknown that usually makes stories like the X-Men, Inhumans, even Godzilla, work to a certain degree. The mutants, as we all know, are portrayed as the Darwinian next step, are (perceived as) hidden in society amongst people's children and wield as much - or more - power as the Avengers. That isn't illogical fear, that makes sense in my book. The mutants are feared because there are typically more of them than the superheroes."
Marvel,3dvret,fiendzone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:28:02 2015 UTC,"Cap isn't the norm. Spider man isn't the norm. Thor isn't the norm. But outside of special events were the aforementioned characters need to hated for plot reasons, they are loved in the marvel universe. There is no reason for civilians to hate one group and not the other. That logic gap is interesting in concept but almost always poorly executed"
Marvel,3dvret,MeanAmbrose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"That's a good discussion point honestly. We need writers to make sure they effectively relate that flawed logic to the flawed logic within the world around us.   EDIT: Also, my point on ""the norm"" was that mutants occurred (somewhat) naturally. It's in the DNA from birth and laying dormant until puberty, most people's emotional rollercoaster time period. Cap and the others are folks who were pretty much given their abilities by an outside source and are much, much rarer. They're not perceived as ""replacing"" humans, right?"
Marvel,3dvret,autorazr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:48 2015 UTC,My point is why aren't they? The general public has no way of knowing a supers origin story. For all they know every super is a mutant
Marvel,3dvret,alrighthamilton,-21,Mon Jul 20 19:35:35 2015 UTC,The illogical premise is literally the entire point.   What's the difference between blacks and tan people? It doesn't make sense that Asians are so much more accepted
Marvel,3dvret,autorazr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:07 2015 UTC,Eh that example is kind of a leap. There are actual physical differences between the outward appearances of races. However someone like cyclops looks human but will still be hated because they suddenly know he has powers and he is a mutant. How do they know that cap wasn't a mutant or hawkeye? It just doesn't make sense. Illogical fear is a good story element but the inconsistencies in the universe cause some glaring issues.

Hating on this movie is becoming a bit circlejerk-ish and it gets tiring reading only negative things about it in the comments. I understood the skepticism whenever the movie was in production when we would only get half-assed rumors that made the movie look bad, but now that we've seen some footage (which I think is pretty cool or at least decent looking) people are still ripping every aspect of the movie to shreds. I really hope this movie is good not only for people to enjoy but also to show that not every comic book movie needs to be literally exactly like it is in the comics. I do, however, agree with them that Doom could've looked a bit better and the Thing should wear shorts. Other than that, I'm completely on board for this movie and will be watching it opening weekend."

If movie makers would just stick to the source material the movies would be a lot better. My personal belief, is that Marvel has done their movies way better than Fox.  I agree that X-Men First-Class and Days Of Future Past were decent movies,  but X-Men 1, X-Men 2, X-Men 3, FF 1, FF 2, and Daredevil were terrible."

Marvel,3dvret,cheddarhead4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:08:32 2015 UTC,"The main thing I've gotten from all of the previews and what I've heard from the script is that the screenwriter and the director don't really know how to treat the Fantastic Four. They don't know how to get in touch with the characters and the dynamic between them, so they instead try to go outward - try and maybe go towards themes of innovation and technology and science, but missing out on what makes the characters really unique.  The big deal for me is the relationship between Reed and Doom. Anyone that's been reading Hickman's run with FF/Avengers/Secret Wars can see how great that dynamic can be - but the movie doesn't seem to be picking up on that in the slightest. Maybe the trailers aren't showing it, but that represents to me a fundamental lack of knowledge of how to treat the characters, and instead deciding to rely on more general sci-fi tropes."

Marvel,3dwmur,mmmasian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:51:16 2015 UTC,Man-Thing?
Marvel,3dwmur,amidoingthisright19,5,Mon Jul 20 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"Man-Thing was originally a scientist who was doing top secret research on plants in the Everglades when his wife betrayed him to AIM. In desperation, he injected himself with his untested formula, only to discover it had seriously unexpected consequences.   In Iron Man 3, AIM uses a formula based on plant research to give people superpowers. Also, the female AIM agent (played by Stephanie Szostak) who battles Tony to the death midway through the film is named Ellen Brandt, who is best known to comics fans as Man-Thing's treacherous wife. The character even has the scar on her face she received fighting Man-Thing in the comics.  Maybe it's just an easter egg, but I love thinking that Man-Thing's swamping around in the Everglades somewhere.  Would love to see him show up in a Doctor Strange installment."
Marvel,3dwmur,mmmasian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. Now that you mention it I do recall people discussing that back when IM3 first came out. Any idea of Marvel officially has the rights to Man-Thing?
Marvel,3dwmur,amidoingthisright19,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"They sure do!  I forgot to add, Maria Hill specifically mentions Man-Thing in Agents of Shield in the episode Nothing Personal. (""Who or what is a Man-Thing?"") Here's the updated guide from The Geek Twins."

Marvel,3dwmur,vikmourne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:36:37 2015 UTC,"Howard Stark was one of the driving forces behind Brotherhood of the Shield, the leader of The Stark Seven, and just starred in Operation: SIN.  Foggy hasn't been in the line of danger in comic book history as much as Howard Stark has (and when it does happen to Foggy, it's 95% of the time not by choice).  Foggy has also never had a title where he wasn't supporting.    Betty Ross was Red She-Hulk dude."

Marvel,3dwmur,jallyward,4,Mon Jul 20 03:54:33 2015 UTC,I think Black Panther should be on this list. Jessica Jones too. You also missed Falcon.
Marvel,3dwmur,plymouthpower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:10:22 2015 UTC,"Probably best sorted with sub-catagories, and then whether or not the character was created for the movie/show, or appears in the comics, like how Agents of SHIELD and Peggy Carter have alot of people exclusive to the show. Meaning under Punisher, you could list all of the characters that have been in his films, such as Jigsaw, Micro, The Russian etc coming from the comics, but Looney Bin Jim being created for the film. Each movies supporting cast can count as additional characters. Unless your only counting ""superheros"", in which case your gonna hit alot of grey areas."
Marvel,3dwmur,ShoelaceAglet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:31:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't include any of the characters from The Punisher films since they aren't canon to the MCU.  Micro, just because he was mentioned already would be understandable."

Marvel,3dwmur,zeo1137,2,Mon Jul 20 07:31:59 2015 UTC,Back in like the 90's Marvel was going broke so they sold off a bunch of their characters' film rights. Marvel has almost everyone back except for the X-Men & all related characters and the Fantastic Four & all related characters.  Those are owned by Fox and since the X-Men movies are making them a ton of money we'll likely never see them in a Marvel Studios movie for a very long time.

The middle scene shows Dr Hank Pym showing Hope the new Wasp costume, which sets her up as the Wasp for future movies. The second scene shows Falcon and Captain America, who seem to have captured Bucky the Winter Soldier. They state that he needs help, but they can't go to Iron Man. Falcon says ""I know a guy"", who we know is Ant Man. This sets him up to return in future movies as well."

Marvel,3dv3em,1204Sparta,-16,Mon Jul 20 04:18:58 2015 UTC,Yay. Another politically correct character taking over an iconic character in the new Marvel Universe. I repeat what Stan Lee: more original characters please.
Marvel,3dv3em,ne_dave,12,Mon Jul 20 04:20:54 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with it in this instance.  Hank Pym has never been a particularly popular character.  We can shift Ant-Man around a bit, because it's also a, now, non-specific power set.  Anyone could be Ant-Man at any time."

Marvel,3dv3em,CaptainDawn,-5,Sun Jul 19 21:32:36 2015 UTC,I've read comics long before you were born. Try again.
Marvel,3dv3em,ne_dave,7,Sun Jul 19 21:43:01 2015 UTC,If you did you would realize different people taking up superhero mantles is a regular thing and there have multiple giant men already(one of which was black). Also tell me how was Hank Pym as Giant Man politically incorrect?
Marvel,3dv3em,CaptainDawn,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"You dont get my point. They are changing characters not after build ups, storylines, etc in this case. Theyre doing it to appease their social justice friends. Like I said, even Stan Lee objects and says make new characters. I agree with him. Theyre pushing an agenda, not make compelling stories as their first motivation."
Marvel,3dv3em,ne_dave,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:56 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for any of these political agenda claims? I've been out of the loop on this storyline but it seems there was something leading up to this. Again if you read comics you would know new characters taking up old mantles has always been a thing so why now in 2015 is it some plot by SJWs? Because these new characters aren't straight white males? How did you feel about Scott Lang and Eric O'Grady becoming Ant Man? Also this Raz as far as I know is a new character so your point is moot.
Marvel,3dv3em,CaptainDawn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. You consider him new. That makes a difference. I don't, but I see your angle on it. I will accept your argument on those grounds. My sjw point is Im seeing the overall tone of the new Marvel lineup and I see it riddled with political correctness. Comics have for years addressed social issues, but Im seeing a major bias in one specific direction. My worry is comics from Marvel going beyond discussion to propaganda. I will take a wait and see attitude on Raz. Thank you for the rational discussion."
Marvel,3dv3em,ne_dave,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:03:57 2015 UTC,"Stan Lee said he wanted more original characters instead of taking older characters and changing something about them (i.e. sexuality, gender, ethnicity). From my understanding of him, this is a new and original character, that's going to become a new version of an already established hero."
Marvel,3dv3em,Nero2333,-2,Sun Jul 19 22:13:24 2015 UTC,"You know... When they started doing this it, with spider-man, it was cool because it was unique. But now every hero mantle is given a minority character. It doesn't mean anything anymore. They are just doing it  to be in the news. Its lazy and as a minority myself, its kinda insulting."
Marvel,3dv3em,aces08,3,Mon Jul 20 00:17:09 2015 UTC,"I liked what they did with miles because it was fresh. It made Spider-Man young again and I am sure that appealed to younger readers and older readers wanting to relive their youth. But this just kind of reeks of trying to capitalize on the recent scotus ruling. Maybe it's just bad timing. I like the earlier versions of ultimate colossus before he was a junkie, but I hate what they did to 616 iceman.   I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt that it's just bad timing."
Marvel,3dv3em,tysonmoorewood,-20,Sun Jul 19 22:19:16 2015 UTC,Marvel is so lame with this politically correct nonsense. I have a feeling Bendis played a part in this.

Marvel,3dv3em,The-Gunslinger-X,3,Mon Jul 20 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"You know your completely wrong right?    No, I don't.  You're going to have to explain how minority characters are somehow more ""political""."
Marvel,3dv3em,SegataSanshiro,0,Mon Jul 20 01:21:38 2015 UTC,"Sure. I used the term politically correct, not political. Meaning the people at Marvel get accused of having too many white super-heroes, so they re-brand a popular character with a twist of diversity, and hopefully increase sales while maintaining that they respect all races. For some people, that works. I would like to see them come up with brand new characters that are really unique. If they happen to be of a different race, that would be great, but please don't force it down my throat."
Marvel,3dv3em,The-Gunslinger-X,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:13 2015 UTC,"I don't see how they're ""forcing"" anything down your throat.  Raz is a new character.

Marvel,3dv3em,The-Gunslinger-X,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:08:57 2015 UTC,"You don't want to explain your point of view, because you seem to have no interest in explaining what an ""organic"" introduction of a new character is.  Is every Robin after Dick Grayson inorganic?  What about every Flash after Jay Garrick?  Every Green Lantern after Alan Scott?  Is Scott Lang ""a simple rebrand""?  You demand that minority characters get introduced organically but don't provide an example of how a minority character can be introduced.  Are you just against legacy characters in general, or is it only when they're not white guys that it's bad?"

Marvel,3dv3em,sconeTodd,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"Because Marvel is currently in a brain drain when it comes to creating new, interesting minority characters, and some of us are tired of our iconic heroes getting black-faced to sell comics/movies. Any other questions?"
Marvel,3dv3em,The-Gunslinger-X,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"It's what sells, Marvel is a money making enterprise and they do what'll make money, old mantles with new characters inhabiting them gets more attention than completely new characters.  People say time and time again that they would be willing to support new, original, non-mantle minority characters; and time and time again their books, runs, and properties get cancelled or shuffled into forgottenness because they don't sell. Dragonfire, Coldmoon, Sun Girl, The Triumph Division are just a handful of examples of great minority characters that never made it past their first appearances because they didn't pick up any popularity. Do you honestly believe marvel is incapable of creating and writing unique and original characters? They are more than capable. They just don't sell as well.  Iron Man is a brand. Captain America is a brand. The Hulk, Spider-Man, Giant-Man, Wolverine, are all brands. It's not that ""Marvel is running out of ideas hurr durr durr."" It's that they know what will sell. Introduce a new character under a recognizable title. Have them develop their own story and characteristics that are different than the original.   Legacy characters are not a bad thing. Introducing a difference sex, race, orientation, species from the original title holder is not a bad thing; unless you think that them making a new version of a traditionally white or male character black or female is some horrible offense, I don't personally see it as a big deal, but if you're a #whitegenocide type I could imagine this would be pretty scary to you. I also get if you want new ideas rather than retreads, but honestly, there is so much of that in comics, changing the ethnicity of a character brand is like the lowest offense.  I'd say that unless you're racist or sexist you probably really shouldn't worry about all this ""blackfacing"" because it doesn't really harm anyone in my opinion, and it isn't even close to the biggest problem when it comes to lack of originality in superhero comics."

Marvel,3dwgg2,johnny0neal,6,Mon Jul 20 02:40:59 2015 UTC,"So, just to check, did you read any of Dark Reign? Did you get to Siege? If you are liking Hickman's Avengers and New Avengers, you should go back and check out Secret Warriors and his Fantastic Four run at some point. Very good stuff. Also, if you were reading Dark Reign, you should finish that up, because the Siege event that ended that era was good stuff.  For the X-Men, if you stopped around 5 years ago, I'm guessing you didn't read the Second Coming crossover? If so, that might be a good place for you to start. From there, you can follow Uncanny X-Men, Uncanny X-Force, and X-Men Legacy from then until the big relaunch in 2012 after Avengers vs. X-Men. Other good X-series in the last five years or so include Wolverine and the X-Men (2011), New Mutants (2009), and X-Men Legacy (2012).  After AvX, make sure you read the AvX: Consequences mini before picking up All-New X-Men and Uncanny X-Men, which have been the main X-series for the last few years.   This site can be a good resource for putting things in order if you get a bit lost: http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-marvel-reading-order-guide/  Other really good runs from the past 5 years or so you should check out would include Daredevil (2011) by Mark Waid, Hawkeye (2012) by Matt Fraction, and Thor: God of Thunder (2012) by Jason Aaron, to begin with. Oh, and definitely check out Mighty Avengers (2013) / Captain America and the Mighty Avengers (2014) by Al Ewing. Really good stuff there."
Marvel,3dwgg2,centipededamascus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response!  Are all those X-books good? Even before 2010, it had been a while since I enjoyed X-Men as much as Avengers and Spider-Man. I grew up on the classic Claremont X-Men, and I enjoyed the Morrison run (up to a point) and what Joss Whedon was doing. But all the recent X-Men story arcs have seemed overwhelming without seeming essential."
Marvel,3dwgg2,centipededamascus,3,Mon Jul 20 11:26:52 2015 UTC,"I think the best ones are Uncanny X-Force (2010) and X-Men Legacy (2012). Those series are really, really good. I really like New Mutants (2009) as well as Fraction and Gillen's runs on Uncanny X-Men, and I think Mike Carey's X-Men Legacy is pretty good as well. Your mileage may vary on Wolverine and the X-Men (2011), but I think it was a pretty good, fun book.  The way I see it, there was a brief shining time from around 2009 to 2012 when almost all the X-books were firing on all cylinders. Since 2012 though, the only X-books I can really recommend is X-Men Legacy (2012) (which like I said is really, really good) and Wolverine and the X-Men."

Marvel,3dv55l,0o-FtZ,11,Sun Jul 19 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"It's not even out in most parts of the world though.  Nothing in this review even says something about it beying a bad movie, just that the turn up so far isn't that great.  Also it says 'They should have had a cameo from Iron Man or something to up the ante"" Yeah that's what the fans want. Just throw Iron Man in as a cameo and you have guaranteed succes.  I think that maybe if only about 25% of the audience is families, that maybe they should gear their movies more toward the other 75% of their audience, instead of dumbing things down for kids. But, who am I.   I'm quite sure that even if this movie really tanks (which I don't think it will, it's not in theaters that long) that they will save everything with Civil War which includes Spider-Man in the MCU.  If anything will make visitors come it's Spidey getting included into the MCU.  And I'm very confident that Dr Strange will differentiate itself enough from the rest of the MCU that it will pull people.  As long as they really pull the psychedelic out of this plane type of stuff.  Though I haven't seen the movie yet, judging by the trailers I also feared that Paul's acting wouldn't be so great. I'll come back to that when I've seen it this thursday though."
Marvel,3dv55l,izzyv1990,-26,Sun Jul 19 21:27:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the trailer looked bad. Maybe not by general movie standards, but Marvel standards? It looked terrible. If they'd had a clip of him going Giant man, or if the movie had been a different actor and the character had been Hank Pym and not Scott Lang, it might've pulled off a hat trick. But the fact of the matter is: It wasn't, and it didn't, and Marvel should be ashamed for its subpar attempt at making a funny character out of one who's more commonly associated with being one of the brains in the avenger teams. And Rudd? Rudd was a terrible choice from the getgo. He's the common man's discount Ryan Reynolds. And don't tell me he's not, because you know its true.  The entire movie was doomed to fail from the moment they threw out that first trailer. Its a movie that tries to take itself seriously and prop itself up on the same pedestal as the rest of the avengers...but looks as if it was put together for five year old audiences. It shows a lack of concern for quality, and an overabundance of cocky pointless snark and really ridiculous and childish scenarios."
Marvel,3dv55l,2TrikPony,8,Sun Jul 19 21:32:49 2015 UTC,Not a single person who knows the difference between Hank Pym and Scott Lang is going to miss this movie.  Not even you.

Not great by Marvel standards, but still good. Fight scenes were superb, story flowed well, and Michael Douglas performed VERY well as Hank Pym.   It pains me to say Rudd was one of the lowlights of the movie, but he did his part. This is an Everyman movie. He has no powers but a shrinking suit. It's not perfect by any means but it's still worth a watch."
Marvel,3dv55l,izzyv1990,-13,Sun Jul 19 23:12:59 2015 UTC,Antman was respectable until they put Rudd in the suit. To be blunt? This movie is Marvel's equivalent of DC's previous Green Lantern film. And it hurts me to know we'll probably end up seeing Rudd make lame jokes and add terrible acting to Infinity War.
Marvel,3dv55l,WhatImMike,4,Sun Jul 19 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"That's not even a close comparison. GL had shoddy CGI, bad acting and a awful script.   We're gonna have to agree to disagree."

Two years ago.  I've also noticed the quality of some of the older stuff can be pretty bad. Most of the 2000+ stuff average about 15-25mb folder size (depends on how many pages etc) while the older books come in between 6-10mb.  They could also stand to put some more effort into the smart panels. I like the feature for reading on my phone except when I can't read anything cause half the words are cut off lol.

If it weren't for him the X-Men films would've bombed and Marvel would've had them back by now (see what happened when he left after X2?). And they realized that and got him to save the franchise before it crumbled. Matthew Vaughn can be credited for the assist, because First Class brought hope, but not the regained love that Singer attained with DOFP. I'm pretty sure he knows that fans complain about the faithfulness, which is why the past two films have been based on actual story-arcs (albeit their ""faithfulness"" to those story arcs).

Marvel,3dtema,Wakani,17,Sun Jul 19 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"It's come leaps and bounds. Of course things like this happen occasionally, but as long as the reading experience is as solid as it is now, I'm happy. It's service and price that's almost too good to be true.   No joke, I seriously can't believe how much the experience has improved in such a short amount of time."
Marvel,3dtema,Jaymii,2,Sun Jul 19 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"You know, there are many complaints to be made about the service, but you are so right. When I got it a year and a half ago, it seemed like there really wasn't much on there. Now, the only times I ever have problems are when I'm reading something super obscure and a couple of issues are missing here and there.  Although I'm still really pissed off that they refuse to put any of the M-rated comics like Ennis's Punisher or Alias on there. I've never seen any discussion on it or any kind of statement by Marvel as to why they don't have them. I mean if they're worried about little kids reading them, they just need to put some kind of child lock on the app or something and stop preventing people from reading some of their best comics."
Marvel,3dtema,IAmATroyMcClure,8,Sun Jul 19 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"I've subscribed for about a year and a half. The app is so close to being great, but is way more frustrating than it should be.   The service keeps track of what comics you've read/been reading, but doesn't mark them in any way. The other Marvel Comics app, that you pay per comic, uses a different ""smart panel"" engine (someone previously commented that it's a white box version of the Comixology engine). This is far superior to the ""unlimited"" version, which is frequently useless to the point of ruining the reading experience. It's too freaking stupid to line up with the edges of panels, especially when there's several in a row, and you'll end up with half a panel cut off. Maybe 75% of a comic can be read with smart panel on, but you frequently have to exit smart panel and pinch and zoom to read parts of pages.  When you're reading a multi comic event, the app will always link the next comic in a series to read when you finish a comic, regardless of what is next in the event arc. This is incredibly frustrating for something like Civil War. Combine that with the aforementioned not marking things read means I haven't even come close to finishing that event, since I spend five minutes trying to figure out where I left off any time I start reading it again.   I really, really want this service to be Netflix for comics, but there's so much friction involved, it's too frustrating to try and binge read. The price is fine, and as it is it's mostly fine on an iPad, but I much prefer reading via smart panel on my phone, or I would if that actually worked."
Marvel,3dtema,HASHTAG_thatssoraven,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"For that multi-comic event point, it seems like such a weird issue to have. I'm sure some unpaid intern would love to assemble air tight read orders for them to adjust to."
Marvel,3dtema,QuirkyGroundhog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. What I really want is a sort of ""add series to library"" function, so for example I can add All-New X-Men to my library, and Unlimited will keep track of which issue I'm on, rather than having to manually add the next issue each time I stop reading so I won't forget where I was.  Kinda like on Netflix, adding a TV series to your list."
Marvel,3dtema,phoenixhunter,21,Mon Jul 20 18:37:52 2015 UTC,What attention exactly? It's a great value but a frustrating experience. The app and browser version are buggy as shit and their suggested reading orders are just based on publishing dates not an actual chronological timeline.
Marvel,3dtema,testcartest,6,Sun Jul 19 08:15:16 2015 UTC,"Basically, what op's picture is showing."
Marvel,3dtema,Mathieulombardi,2,Sun Jul 19 15:39:05 2015 UTC,I agree. The browser reader is buggy as hell and the search function to find something to read is awful.
Marvel,3dtema,2udaylatif,2,Sun Jul 19 14:22:37 2015 UTC,"Their iOS app has improved dramatically since it was initially released. I used to find it unusable, but I'd say the reader itself (by this I mean the portion of the app you interact with as you actually read a comic) is mostly serviceable. The interface for finding things and their reading orders could definitely use some improvement though."

Marvel,3dtema,Emehan1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"i was very tempted to sub to it, but no matter what i couldn't find what was actually available in it beyond the vague ""issues published up to six months previously"" item.  i'm glad i didn't at the time because the series i was reading i found out by watching marvel.com new issue releases page to buy digital copies new, while watching that section i noticed that the series and lead ups i was interested were multiple years behind.  ultimately i've become rather unfond of buying through marvel.com in general. there are more pleasant ways to read issues and less hamfisted and dictatorial in how and when and where you read them. i feel it's a bit overbearing that reduces the value when new digital copies are full print retail price.  i like that it's an option, i just wish it was in better shape and more upfront about what's inside."

But they did an update like a week of two ago and it is is now working really well for me.  I've always been stunned that they let you read such an large library for a reasonable monthly rate. There are certainly holes in the offerings, but they're always emailing me about the new issues added.  The biggest complaint I have is a better recommendation system for people who want to explore a character or creator. There's a feature there but it's really underwhelming."

Marvel,3dtema,bob1689321,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:05 2015 UTC,Cracks me how much hate marvel unlimited gets.  It's an amazing app that keeps me reading comics. As a father of four with mortgage and bills and blah blah there is no way I can spend the money on comics and I dropped off years ago.  MU has let me get back in and maintain my interest in the hobby and I even buy a few new issues now so I don't have to wait and use the app for the tie-Ins and spin offs   I have read hundred of comics that I would never have bought in the last year since getting the app  I read a comic at lunch or on breaks at work and it's great.  I've never been a DC reader as I didn't grow up with it so its much harder to get into. If DC had an app like this I would binge read the shit out of it and be DC fan too!
Marvel,3dtema,Catpipe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"It gets hate? Sure, it used to suck so freaking hard when I first tried it about six years ago. I tried it again about a year and a half ago and it was still painful. They finally updated it and it's better, but I still prefer Comixology.   On the other hand every freaking time Comixology has a sale on Marvel titles someone comes in and mentions Marvel Unlimited as the Holy Grail. Yes, I get it $10 for a huge chunk of Marvel is amazing, but I like my freaking Guided View!"

Marvel,3dvpag,damola93,13,Sun Jul 19 22:40:32 2015 UTC,It's worse than cashing in. It was only made so Fox could retain rights and continue to put out shitty F4 movies.

Marvel,3dvpag,mjac1017,3,Sun Jul 19 23:09:33 2015 UTC,Don't know why they replaced the middle-aged Mr.F with a Mark Zuckerberg type.   Because the movie is based on the fantastic four from the ultimate universe. This goes for some of the other changes too.
Marvel,3dvpag,Tree-Stump,3,Mon Jul 20 04:56:01 2015 UTC,I'm excited for the possibility of them doing Ultimate Reed on screen.

Marvel,3dvpag,ace22nd,3,Mon Jul 20 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"I thought the age difference was a bit odd too. From the trailers, the group looks more like a couple of teens that hang out occasionally instead of a group of that is as close as family. I was ok with the age difference once I thought of how talented each of them are, especially Miles Teller and Michael B Jordan. It's understandable to be cautious about this movie. I'm totally gonna watch it to at least give it a chance instead of detesting it like everyone else seems to be doing."
Marvel,3dvpag,Vegeton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"The second trailer brought softened me up a bit, but if the movie does well then other movies will be made simply for the money which will hasten the end of superhero movies.

Marvel,3dvpag,spookyfox1,2,Mon Jul 20 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"It's funny too, since Marvel offered to extend their Daredevil rights in exchange for Galactus and Silver Surfer (or perhaps all of the Fantastic Four related characters), but Fox denied.

Unfortunately, that means they don't translate very well to a more grounded, modern remake. They should be a bit cheesy and off the wall. This new film could potentially be the worst Fantastic Four film yet, and that's saying something.  Or it could be okay. I'll probably still see it, because I still love Marvel."

I've been trying to get them to fix it for years, but that week was never updated in accordance to The Official Avengers Timeline and Fury's Big Week.    Iron Man 3 is weird, because a newspaper clearly says December 2013, but it makes more sense to take place in December 2012 to fit AoS's timeline."
Marvel,3dvc76,mmmasian,2,Mon Jul 20 09:02:57 2015 UTC,"Chronology officially syncs with Agents of SHIELD Pilot in August of 2013 (in the U.S. International dates vary).  Thor TDW,  Captain America TWS, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ultron, and Ant-Man all happen when they premiered in the U.S.  Iron Man 3 has a bit of contention.  It was released on May 3, 2013, but takes place at Christmas time.  Speculation was that it took place Xmas 2012, but a newspaper in the film can be seen that says December 23, 2013.  This would put it during the mid season break of Agents of SHIELD and after Thor TDW, which came out in November.  This would explain why SHIELD wasn't present for an attack on the president's life, as SHIELD was at the time waging war on Centipede bases all over the world.  Phase 1, according to the tie in comics, happens mostly within a span of a week with the exception of Iron Man and Avengers.  IM is, I believe, roughly 6 months before IM2, and Avengers about a year after Thor.  As far as I can find, there is no official history released of the MCU."
Marvel,3dvc76,mastyrwerk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work for Iron Man 3.  Iron Man 3 HAS to take place before Agents of SHIELD because they reference Extremis (Centipede concoction) in the first few episodes.    You either retcon Iron Man 3 to December 2012, or you move Agents of SHIELD and Thor The Dark World to January 2014 instead of taking place from Late September - Early November 2013.  The latter makes the most sense in my head so that you aren't discounting Iron Man 3, and there isn't an awkward 3 month break in AoS.    You're correct about Phase One, I have a detailed breakdown with sources in an older comment."
Marvel,3dvc76,mmmasian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:19:27 2015 UTC,"Wrong.  Extremis had been around since 1999.  Maya Hanson was working on plants with it way back then at a science expo in CERN.  SHIELD would have been aware of her research for years.  Iron Man 3 has Killian ready to sell Extremis.  Centipede had early research on Gamma, Super Soldier, Chitauri, and Extremis.  Nothing advanced enough to use on its own, so they combined everything.  Remember, SHIELD is an organization of Intelligence keeping.  They would have known about Extremis before the general public did."
