Has anyone ever read a story involving Darkseid? Superman has to use his intelligence to win in some cases.  When I was little I loved him because he can fly and wears bright blue, red and yellow. As an adult I love him because he appeals to the humanity in us all."
superman,3e3i2d,woetothedownpressors,4,Tue Jul 21 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"This is the most petty article I've seen in a long time. We can't make the argument that Superman isn't boring for being a God amongst men, and then say that there is no way Batman could win. I'm pro-Superman should win and all.. but come on. This movie going to be good, just like Dark Knight Returns was and just like Man of Steel was."
superman,3e3i2d,GoldenFalcon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, the Deadspin guys are essentially professional internet trolls. Sometimes they are legitimate journalists (like when they broke one of the biggest sports stories of 2013 but for the most part they just try to rile up their readers.   Drew Magary, the only one from the site I really like, just started his annual NFL preview series, called ""Why Your Team Sucks"" and every year fans of the teams he attacks overreact and viciously attack Magary and Deadspin in an attempt to defend their team.  So, I'm almost 100 percent convinced that the true purpose of this article was to simultaneously anger Superman and Batman fans, so it's best not to take it seriously."

I mean, the vast majority of the time, they're comrades who respect each others' differences. Which makes sense. It makes sense that Batman -- a mortal (who is intimately aware of mortality) in a universe populated with super-beings and demigods who could all easily kill him -- would want the most trustworthy one on his side. It makes sense that Superman -- an outsider to the human race who loves humanity -- would respect that a human being was so mercilessly committed to their ideals.    And I really don't get what the fans get out of hating Supes or Bats, because both characters have been in some of the best comics ever published. As a fan of comics, to me it's like walking into a museum and saying, ""I only like the blue paintings."""

superman,3e1blf,0Sanctuary,3,Tue Jul 21 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"I think both of the articles that were written by this guy are complete nonsense.  He does of a lot of bashing the previous games without ever pointing out what kind of game would be fun.  Picking an art style and saying that Superman needs to change into his secret identity isn't a game mechanic.  On top of that, the comments are all - ""Here's what you do:  One, two, three... BLAM SUPERMAN GAME!""  Anything that can be written in a few pages is not going to work.  This needs to be thought out well and there are absolutely ways to introduce power limits without taking away from Superman.  As long as there is a point in the game where he's fully powered, it'll still be a Superman game."
superman,3e1blf,dpkonofa,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"I think taking the Max Fleisher style will only look like copying Epic Mickey/Cuphead/Transformers: Devastation. More importantly, that careful art gothic style was the product of painstaking rotoscope work. It's not easily duplicated with video game hardware, because it's so reliant on the extremely particular animation. It's not something that could be emulated with shaders (like Devestation and Borderlands) or sprites (like Cuphead).  More importantly, it deliberately dates Superman. This is a novel hook for a novel, but it makes it difficult to invest in a game, especially one that would sit alongside the Arkham Trilogy, which is more than capable of presenting a compelling Batman story that feels quintessential rather than reinterpretive.  EDIT: Actually, now that I think about it this pitch, particularly the ""multiple earths"" bit, is vaguely reminiscent of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which did similar things with Spider-Man 2099 and Noir Spider-Man."

Why does he wear a space suit in Justice League Unlimited?   Same reason electricity hurts him. Timm chose to depower Superman.  4.) Why does he not just make a lead suit to counteract the krypton it? (I know he has built one in the superman animated series but why does he not use it more?)  Lead is not the most flexible material. All I can think of is the lead vests they make you wear when getting an x-ray. He couldn't wear something like that.   5.) How does he get sick in all star?   Overexposure to solar radiation."

The video itself was done most likely with research all by themselves. Otherwise the viewer would know that when Superman was tossed into Earth by Khyber in a possible future, it took him years to resurface, not moments. He didn't just walk it off.  That being said, I'm always amused by the 'X can beat Superman, but if he can't, then Superman is just OP' argument.  If X could beat Superman, then that would make X OP.  Besides all that, the main thing everyone should take away from either match between these two is this; Goku needs 50 different forms and borrow energy from other people to be a threat, while all Superman has to do is be Superman.  Why is this even a debate to begin with?"

superman,3dt9la,PennedHitchhiker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"Thing is...math. Scroll to bottom for math, read rest for explanation.  Super Sayan 4 maxed Goku's strength/force output at 160,000 tons. Canon.  It's not specified how many times stronger Goku's Super Sayan God form is compared to his base form, but in canon, super Sayan 4 doesn't exist, so why not say SS4 is equivalent to SSgod?  Or for arguments sake let's say that Super Sayan God is 100 times physically stronger than super Sayan 4. Even then though. Even...then  Going super Sayan from the God base form multiplies his strength by 50. So 800 million tons would be super Sayan God-super sayan's max output.   Superman's max strength, canon, is over 6 SEXTILLION metric tons.   This is 7.5 TRILLION TIMES STRONGER than Goku's latest form even if we assume SS God is stronger than SS4.  Considering the first fight caught him off guard as to what Goku was capable of, I understand why the rematch didn't seem so evenly matched. Superman was not messing around and didn't want the earth destroyed again. And considering that 6 sextillion tons > 16 million tons....I just don't blame Superman for casually walking through that kamehameha at all.   EDIT: Superman's exact New 52 strength can be found and cited on Wikipedia but I used screw attack's first video for Goku's super Sayan multiplications. (Super Sayan strength=base x 50)"
superman,3dt9la,flying87,2,Mon Jul 20 02:32:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry to disappoint but Goku is actually a bit stronger. In Battle of Gods, Goku wrecks a good portion of a dwarf planet while in Super Saiyan 3. A magnitude or two below Superman's strength but still a slight problem. Also New 52 Supes has a bit more strength too, I won't bother explaining it but I'll link to some of his feats."

At least make the fight competitive. In the last fight, ScrewAttack claimed Goku would be too dumb to figure out Superman's powers are solar based. Fair enough, but wouldn't he figure it out if he's been training in the afterlife with King Kai for over 3 years? And Superman dying was ""early"" in his career? Post-Crisis Superman was 34 when he died. The Raditz comparison makes no sense.  SHOW THE SUPER FLARE. SHOW A FUSION. The fight was so half-assed and the reasoning was the same thing they said the first time copy and pasted."

Fair enough, but wouldn't he figure it out if he's been training in the afterlife with King Kai for over 3 years?   I really don't see how he could figure out the solar based powerset. Assuming the fight would stay completely on Earth, Clark would always be under the effects of the sun. Any weakening he would face, I think Goku would chalk up to 'losing ki' or just being tired.   Superman's power isn't ki-based, so I think it's safe to assume that Goku would not be able to sense Clark's power. I'm sure it might feel different from the people he's used to fighting, but really, Clark's ki should be at the same level as any other person's, in my shitty opinion.  Besides, it doesn't matter. Goku could have pre-knowledge of it, and he wouldn't exploit it anyway. Goku likes his opponents to be their strongest. He would want a ""cheap"" victory like draining Clark of his powers or even using kryptonite to kill him.  On the training with King Kai comment, how would that allow Goku to figure it out?"
superman,3dt9la,cenyule,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"You're right. He wouldn't be able to figure it out in their first fight.  However, if Goku was training in the afterlife with someone as knowledgeable about the universe as King Kai from January 2012 - July 2015 before being resurrected by Superman, he would definitely know about  Red Sun radiation by then.  Using his Instant Transmission technique on Superman wouldn't be exploiting it."
superman,3dt9la,mrlowe98,3,Sun Jul 19 15:18:41 2015 UTC,"However, if Goku was training in the afterlife with someone as knowledgeable about the universe as King Kai from January 2012 - July 2015 before being resurrected by Superman, he would definitely know about Red Sun radiation by then.   I think King Kai would have a tough time figuring that out. The Kais aren't quite infallible and not even King Kai knows about all the ongoings of his own universe. I doubt he could peak over at the DC universe to find out that information.    Using his Instant Transmission technique on Superman wouldn't be exploiting it.   I assume that by using the IT that you mean Goku would teleport Clark to a planet with a red sun.   If so -   I still think it's a non-factor.   Assuming that King Kai told Goku about the red sun, they would still have to find a planet for Goku to teleport them to. Even with the New Namek planet, Goku had to concentrate to find them. He needs a ki source to lock on to travel with it. He had some trouble while just standing still concentrating. Superman would all up in his business, so I think the teleport would be very difficult to pull off mid-fight.   Besides, Goku loves to fight strong opponents. Exploit or not, he absolutely would not use a weakness like that to defeat Clark. He would want to beat him through his own power.   Now, I could see him using the weakness if Clark were out for blood and trying to destroy the entire planet and Goku is completely losing the fight. But that's a worst-case scenario for Goku.   That's a problem I have with the Screwattack vidoe as well. In there, the two are not villains or out for blood, but they have Clark fry Goku's brain. That's so out of character, on a scale of one to even, I literally can't."
superman,3dt9la,cordialhero,4,Sun Jul 19 16:07:00 2015 UTC,I don't know why people keep saying Superman is OP. He isn't. He's powerful relative to the villains he faces.
superman,3dt9la,NefariousRaccoon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:29:47 2015 UTC,"Doesn't that kind of make him OP though? He's so powerful that the only thing he has to worry about is choosing the right power level so he doesn't instantly obliterate anyone he faces. That is only true, of course, only if he actually has lifted infinite mass and done all the other shit the video claims to. I know a lot of the times in comics, there are certain scenarios that make things like that possible that would otherwise not be. Like him sneezing and destroying the solar system was only possible because of Mxypltk."

superman,3dt9la,Sorge74,3,Sun Jul 19 13:39:57 2015 UTC,"It was kind of a let down. It certainly is not long enough. Its not really a sequel and more of an epilogue to the last fight, which is fine. Its best to imagine that Superman is still in his ""god form"" from the previous fight. Its the only way any of this is really plausible."
superman,3dt9la,mrlowe98,2,Sun Jul 19 08:29:39 2015 UTC,I thought that was kind of the assumption since Goku started out in his god form too.
superman,3dt9la,flying87,2,Sun Jul 19 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"See if that was the assumption, its superman prime, a million years hanging out in the sun, then its fine. From my understanding superman tires, his cells deplete solar radioaction, he can be hurt. He is limitless in the fact he can absorb limitless energy, not that he has limitless power from the get go."
superman,3dt9la,mrlowe98,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"Well by 'god form', I mean where he left off at the end of their first fight. Like, at the beginning of the first fight, he began by fighting Goku at the power level he tries to fight normal villains at. Then he slowly got stronger and stronger as the fight progressed because Goku did too. So he got to the point where he was just barely more powerful than Super Saiyan 3 Goku when the fight ended."
superman,3dt9la,flying87,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:28:23 2015 UTC,"I love Superman. But there really is no way he is defeating super duper god form goku that easily in his normal form. God form Superman can easily walk through whatever the entire dbz universe can throw at him, simultaneously.   God form goku is a ""god"" in the comic book sense, like Loki or Thor. Both can still get their ass handed to them by mortals like the Hulk. God form Superman is a ""God"" in the biblical sense. As in ""creator of the heavens and the earth, of the stars and the sky."" If god form superman thinks it, it becomes so. God form superman is literally GOD.  And that is why he can't be defeated. Because if you choose to have Superman fight at his maximum potential, which is the premise behind screwattack, nothing could stop Superman. The entire dbz universe combined couldn't defeat god form superman. And thus ends that debate....hopfully. Probably not."
superman,3dt9la,mrlowe98,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, not Superman Prime 1 million God form. That's non canon. I'm thinking more around the power level of silver age superman when he's traveling galaxies in minutes and carrying solar systems is 'god form' for normal, canon Supes. If we bring One Million Prime into this, it'd take a literal Supreme Being to kill him. A million SSG Gokus couldn't lay a finger on him."
superman,3dt9la,flying87,2,Sun Jul 19 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"Well they said in this video and in the last one that they were exclusively using post-crises Superman. I'm assuming this video is a direct continuation of the last one and only a few minutes of passed between the two fights. Superman wouldn't wait to long to wish the Earth back. So I'm assuming Superman is still super charged from being inside the middle of the sun.   In the last episode Superman stayed inside the sun for the same amount of time it took goku to charge up a giant ass super spirit bomb to absorb. So considering how fucking long even in real time a normal spirit bomb takes to charge, its safe to assume Superman is hella charged up for round two. Idk if its Prime level, but its probably close enough.   Going extra close to the sun is enough for Superman to one punch darkseid into unconsciousness, another person who considers themselves a god. Super charge Superman, and its game over.   Is Superman Prime no longer canon? I thought it was still there as a potential possibility. I'm confused at how DC canon works now."

superman,3dsksx,Atrocitusrex,11,Sun Jul 19 01:27:34 2015 UTC,I watched the whole series as it aired. I constantly went back and forth thinking it was great and it was terrible. Such an inconsistent show but some great stuff in there. Although I didn't like that he inherited his fortune instead of being a self made man I'm in the camp that Rosenbaum as far as personality portrayal is the definitive Lex.
superman,3dsksx,thekingearl,8,Sun Jul 19 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"Smallville was constantly a show of that gave as many cool things as it took away. It was consistently inconsistent. And yet year after year, I watched every season"
superman,3dsksx,MarcReyes,5,Sun Jul 19 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, first it was a fun new take. Than it became too formulaic with its ""freak of the week."" Then it started giving us an arching story. Then that story became a poorly written soap opera. Then it gave us teases of the DC Universe. Then it became a DC soap opera. Then it became he's almost superman. Then they completely mishandled Darkseid. Then it ended. And I watched for a decade."
superman,3dsksx,thekingearl,4,Sun Jul 19 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"I wish Rosenbaum's performance would've made him the go-to actor for Lex in any future story. Like Hugh Jackman for Wolverine. He was by far the best portrayal of Lex I've ever seen. Incredible character, he stole the show for me every time he was on screen."

It has a lot of commonalities with man of steel for me where it feels almost like a character assassination, but it definitely starts shining in the later seasons in some episodes.  I'm just starting season 4 now, where Erica Durance joins the cast incidentally - Another cast member that I felt was well cast. Has some facial similarities to Kate Bosworth as well."

superman,3dhrtx,StuartM96,24,Thu Jul 16 11:20:37 2015 UTC,That actually makes a lot of sense.  They are taking a more realistic approach with Supes this time around and it is ridiculously unrealistic for a rock to have traveled 100s of light years in 35 years. I guess the only other explanation would be that it was in Zod's ship or the world engine.
superman,3dhrtx,n0solace,11,Thu Jul 16 11:57:58 2015 UTC,"It could work as the following:   World Engine goes about terraforming Earth into Krypton, succeeds for the same area as Metropolis' destruction. When Supes destroys it, it causes the unstable Earth/Krypton matter to be damaged by the radiation on the W.E. So, we now have radioactive Kryptonian matter - Kryptonite. The radiation doesn't go unnoticed by Aquaman, who locates it and brings it to the surface. At the same time, Luthor's forces acquire the glowing green rock. Aquaman, knowing that shit's about to go down, decides to follow the radiation, thanks to an Atlantean Geiger-counter, or something. Follows the signal to Gotham/Metropolis (according to Snyder, the cities are now located next to each other, like San Francisco & Oakland.) Witnesses the fight between Batman & Superman, and waits it out. Sees Luthor attack Superman with the Kryptonite. Jumps in and busts up Luthor's plan/armor/Metallo/etc. Tells Supes, Bats and WW that his Atlantean technology warns of a bigger threat, and that they need to work together. Also says he knows of 3 others that can help them. #UniteThe Seven.   Or something else. Possibly."
superman,3dhrtx,StuHardy,2,Thu Jul 16 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Well, the kryptonite could come through the same wormhole as Kal's ship or the prison ship.  Unlike how it was portrayed in Smallville, it wouldn't all land in the same place as his ship since it would have a different speed/direction of travel when it entered and left the wormhole. And rocks can't make course corrections. :)  Also, it seems strange to me that the world engine--which is explicitly designed to make planets more habitable to Kryptonians--would produce a radioactive, deadly rock as a bi-product.  EDIT: Actually, now that I think about it, neither of those explanations would work in this universe! Kal's ship left long before the destruction of Krypton. And the prison ship wasn't modified for space travel until well after the explosion. World engine is the only way! (Without violating the universal speed limit...)"

superman,3dhrtx,Mikeahya,3,Thu Jul 16 12:08:42 2015 UTC,it could be a energy core of the ship or terraforming machine
superman,3dhrtx,loco1876,3,Thu Jul 16 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think the terraforming had everything to do with it. I think that is why Kryptonians couldn't fly on their own planet, because their atmosphere has actual kryptonite in it.... and the terraforming machine not only increases the gravity of the planet, but changes the composition of the air to include kryptonite. An effect of that, like you said, could be that it changes things in the ground and creates big rocks of kryptonite. Just a theory."

superman,3d9xb3,Johnny_Stooge,92,Tue Jul 14 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I believe they are setting up his humanity. People need to place themselves in a 3rd person point of view. As viewers and lovers of Superman we are basically omniscient. We know who Superman is, his universe does not. Therefore there is resentment, praise, and fear towards him. He currently isn't a ""he"". He's an ""it"". Humanity doesn't see him as a person but as a force. He will show them he cares. With his actions and words. He will doubt himself and wonder if he should have even came to the public, but he knows he had to. This isn't Superman who saves a failing plane or helicopter. He was dragged out by the acts of a conquerer. So of course people aren't going to welcome him with open arms.  Reeve's Superman got to save people immediately, doing caring acts of stopping robberies and saving cats stuck in trees. Cavil is getting the chance to do that now. In the next Superman film (not bvs) we should see a more trusting society."
superman,3d9xb3,F1F2F3F4F5F6F7F8,30,Tue Jul 14 18:01:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I actually feel the conflict and the tough decisions he is forced to make, magnify his humanity. It is quite human to struggle with decisions, ideas of self, and feelings of solitude. Struggling with who you are and your role in society is part of coming of age and makes you who you are. To say he lacks humanity isn't true, if anything he reflects humanity maybe a little too much? People want him to be perfect because they aren't... and well, young Superman is far from perfect."
superman,3d9xb3,Shabadoo9Nine,25,Tue Jul 14 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agreed with this. The whole point of Snyder doing the film was to say that humanity would treat him like an alien because he is one. They wouldn't all the sudden be like, ""he has laser vision and can fly! Neat-o!"""
superman,3d9xb3,DashSatan,9,Tue Jul 14 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't all the sudden be like, ""he has laser vision and can fly! Neat-o!""   Ah, for the days of the Silver Age..."
superman,3d9xb3,nermid,4,Tue Jul 14 23:33:10 2015 UTC,Exactly. Superman doing what is right in spite of what he will face in BvS will highlight his humanity. He could easily kill Batman or anyone else who opposes him. Yet I'm sure we will see him take a more noble path.
superman,3d9xb3,musicisfree91,6,Wed Jul 15 07:27:53 2015 UTC,"As a Superman fan I think the article is targeted to a more general view of what people think of Superman, where it fails is in the focus of the narrative that Snyder is setting up for the movie. I agree with the next Supes movie connecting with humanity, I really think the next movie (not bvs) will make or break the Superman movie franchise"
superman,3d9xb3,Ley_Line,2,Tue Jul 14 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely agree with this. Also, what a lot of people criticizing MoS and BvS don't realize is... A movie is not a lot of time to create a big story for him to do the things were used to Supes doing in say a comic or even Smallville. Yeah, it's cool seeing him take a couple pages to deal with a softer side, that doesn't fit so well in movies now. People would get bored watching 15 minutes of him helping people all the time and being cheerful.   The closest we've come was the omnibus part of Superman Returns I think, outside of Reeve. It's just not there for viewers anymore."
superman,3d9xb3,Imbillpardy,6,Wed Jul 15 01:59:16 2015 UTC,"This article isn't talking about how the public views Superman, but how the film industry views him.  In Man of Steel:   The tone of the whole movie was very serious and dark for a Superman movie. Clark never jokes around with anyone in the movie. All his exchanges are very formal and stoic. Clark gets into a tiff with a customer at a bar and does the superhero-equivalent to keying the guy's car and slashing his tires.  Clark steals clothing from a meals-on-wheels driver Clark doesn't try to move the fight with Zod outside of the city.    Batman V Superman:   The Day of Dead people are flocking around Clark trying to touch him. What does he do? He looks off into the distance rather than converse with the people. The people on the flooded house are reaching out begging to be saved. What does he do? He stands there hovering above them. He doesn't interact with the crowd and show people how to get the help they need. He just sits there.   All this to me says that the Goyer/Snyder Superman is not anything that has been done before. Either they don't respect the comic book Superman or they don't understand him. This article points that out. It's not new, either. I have been a Superman fan for over 30 years. The number thing someone says when they find this out is, ""I don't like him. He's too powerful. He's too boy scout-y."" They can't conceive of anything that would make this an interesting character, so they assume no one else can, either. Maybe this is why they are choosing to make a ""dark"" Superman. One of my favorite things about the comic book Superman is that he actually has an incredibly dark past and is really destined to be one of the loneliest characters in existence but he doesn't choose to have a somber attitude about it. He chooses to be an optimist. He chooses to be nice to people.  Now, bring on all the downvotes for criticizing the Snyder movies."
superman,3d9xb3,nullmiah,37,Tue Jul 14 18:57:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you're making an awful lot of assumptions about Superman in BvS based on very little information."

superman,3d9xb3,Calhoun1389,3,Tue Jul 14 21:48:01 2015 UTC,"You're totally right, but I am going with what I have seen. I remember when the Man of Steel trailer came out and the exchange between Pa Kent and Clark about the kids on the bus:  Clark: ""What should I have done? Let them die?""  Pa: ""I don't know. Maybe.""  All I could think was, ""I'm sure they just cut off the 2nd part of the dialog where he explains that he did the right thing but still needs to be careful."" Then the movie came out and that was the full exchange. It still blows my mind. No wonder he killed Zod with a dad like that."
superman,3d9xb3,nullmiah,9,Tue Jul 14 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"The entire characterization of Pa Kent in Man of Steel was shit, to me. Absolutely nothing like the Jonathan Kent in the comics or TV shows."
superman,3d9xb3,cosine83,6,Tue Jul 14 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"No wonder he killed Zod with a dad like that.   That was my honest opinion of the ending from day 1. Given that Pa Kent is a crazy backwoods nut in this incarnation, Clark is going to need more time to develop into the man we know and love."
superman,3d9xb3,nermid,2,Tue Jul 14 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"The line is trying to show that rarely in reality are things so black and white.  He doesn't get mad at Clark for saving them, he just admits to his son that he just wasn't sure what he should have done either, and that felt like an honest and interesting way to approach both Jonathan and Clark.  This is what Clark deals with throughout the whole movie, what kind of man is he supposed to be?  The only person that is really sure is Jor-El, and we see that he died for his convictions, just like Jonathan Kent did, and together I think their sacrifices will really help shape Clark into Superman.  This brings to mind the tornado scene as well.  That scene seems horribly stupid to most people (including me) because we forget what Clark says to Lois right after.  Paraphrasing: I let my father die because I trusted his judgement and beliefs.  The Earth was not ready, and neither was Clark (right before he's yelling at his parents like a teenager for something silly, showing his immaturity).  Most of the early part of Man of Steel is about Clark exploring that judgement for himself and trying to grow.  His dad wasn't a nut, he was a real dad trying to protect his kid.  Clark killed Zod at the end because he is not Superman yet, he is the Man of Steel maybe (hence the title), but he's not Superman.    I think BvS will clearly end with him much closer if not fully into the mantle of Superman, and things like killing, or not being friendly and full of hope, will be long in his past.  Their building to something great, I think."
superman,3d9xb3,Radical_Ryan,2,Wed Jul 15 04:55:57 2015 UTC,The line is trying to show that rarely in reality are things so black and white.   What's so crazy about this to me is that the young Clark did exactly what Superman would do. It was the right thing and there isn't any other way around it. Then Pa Kent reigns him back in to 2nd guess doing the right thing.

superman,3d9xb3,Radical_Ryan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"Then Pa Kent reigns him back in to 2nd guess doing the right thing.   It's kind of self-serving, but its also the sort of ""irrationality"" that comes with love.  Watch ""The Flashpoint Paradox"" (again).  Look at Superman in that movie.   He's a mess.  That's the kind of thing Jonathan is worried about.  He doesn't want his son taken from him, experimented on, dissected, etc.  It's easy to judge him from your comfy seat with your Milk Duds because 1) you know it's not real, and 2) Clark isn't your son.   Jonathan isn't a bad guy, but it's pretty normal to care about YOUR son, that you've loved and cared for and watch grow, more than his classmates.   Jonathan is in the wrong, sure, but it's not bad writing or a bad movie.   It's human.  It's understandable."
superman,3d9xb3,Jordoom,2,Sat Jul 18 21:16:49 2015 UTC,I'm hoping in bvs that Superman and Batman push each other to be better.
superman,3d9xb3,runnerofshadows,2,Sat Jul 18 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm thinking.  Superman learns from Batman the importance of preserving life, and that it is inevitable that he will be a symbol: all he can choose is what kind of symbol he will be.  Batman learns from Superman that there IS good in the world.  Here is a guy who could destroy or rule the world, and he just wants to help people."
superman,3d9xb3,Jordoom,3,Sat Jul 18 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"The best/worst part of that exchange was shortly after when Jonathan says of Clark's powers, ""one day you're gonna think of them as a blessing.""  HOW ABOUT TODAY WHEN HE'D OTHERWISE BE DEAD IN AN ICY RIVER WITHOUT THEM??  Forget the debate on whether or not he should have saved his classmates.  HE'D. BE. DEAD.    That's when it becomes apparent that Pa's dialogue doesn't represent a legitimate point of view.  It is just gibberish disguised as plot service."
superman,3d9xb3,wilyquixote,0,Wed Jul 15 00:57:46 2015 UTC,"It may not be as bad, but I also feel like they are missing the mark with Martha as well. She has that monolog in the BvS trailer where she tells Clark that he doesn't need to be a hero, or do anything, and that he doesn't owe this world anything. I really hope the surrounding dialog makes that a lot less selfish in the film."
superman,3d9xb3,nullmiah,6,Wed Jul 15 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's a common theme in superman stories that Supes beats himself up when he doesn't save everyone, that he feels personally responsible for many bad things that happen. Martha frequently tells him to look at it as him saving many people, that people would be in a worse position without him. That line seems to fit well in a ""Just because some people died doesn't mean you failed"" speech."
superman,3d9xb3,skpkzk2,6,Wed Jul 15 07:19:32 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind the tone they're hinting at.  I can get behind a world that is actively conflicted about the presence of Superman and in return, he's conflicted about his role.    However, I do think they're missing something valuable if not integral by having the Kents take an ""well, fuck them then"" approach to humanity.  But like you said, that (out of context) quote isn't as bad as the nonsense spewed by Jonathan in the first film. It's not an absurd position for Martha to take."

That's not what she said.  She says (emphasis mine):  ""Be their hero, be their angel, be their monument, be anything they need you to be.  Or be none of it.  You don't owe this world a thing, you never did.""   It seems clear (to me) that he's going to her for advice, and she's basically laying out his two options.  ""If you use your powers, people are going to criticize you, idolize you, put you on a pedestal.  You have to accept that.  Or, don't use your powers.""  Then, the ""you don't owe this world a thing"" line is her saying the choice is ultimately his, which fits thematically with MoS, the contrast of the natural birth and the genetic programs of Krypton, the Platonic republic vs. individual free will, etc.    Martha isn't being mean, she's clarifying things for her son, and its actually good and truthful advice.    As for Superman being distant, I think that is part of why he is going to her in the first place.  He doesn't want to be a symbol, he doesn't want to be idolized, he doesn't want to be a ""god"", false or otherwise.  And this isn't because he's an asshole, but because of the exact opposite reason: he's a humble farm boy and he's uncomfortable with it.    He just wants to help people and do the right thing."

superman,3d9xb3,RickRussellTX,14,Thu Jul 16 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"Obviously, different people have different views about what it means to be a ""fan"" of Superman.  This post, to me, makes me feel like you don't understand Superman and don't respect the character.  The person we've seen so far (minus a short trailer that you've extrapolated to the point of ridiculousness) is not Superman.  He's Clark Kent struggling to come to terms with the fact that he's Superman and doesn't have a choice in the matter.  He is, without a doubt, the most powerful being on the planet and he's had to pretend he's not.  He's had to deal with being an outcast while pretending to fit in.  Secondly, they're not choosing to make a ""dark"" Superman. They're choosing to, for once, bring Superman into our reality and accepting that it wouldn't be all sunshine and roses for humanity to suddenly find out that aliens are real and one of them has been living on this planet.  Every previous Superman movie has this inescapable layer of disbelief that we have to suspend because they simply plop Superman into our world and everyone accepts it without question because ""Oh, wow... there's a guy who can fly and shoot laser beams out of his face and he must be the good guy because reasons"".  Otherwise, they have to make it clear that this is a ""comic book universe"" and everyone just instinctively knows that superheroes are real and that's ok.  That's not reality, though.  The Donner-era Superman movies are some of my favorites and they're classics but they're not great stories to me because they constantly remind me that they're a movie.  Man of Steel is the first movie that actually made me feel like there was a hero that could actually live in our world.  On top of that, based on the situation given in MoS, whether we like it or not, we're screwed unless we accept his help that he's willing to give.  One of my favorite things about Superman, on which I'm in full agreement with you, is that he chooses to be an optimist and a good person.  I think Snyder is simply explaining to people why, despite being an outcast, Superman chooses the high road and not the low road.  He is a beacon of hope for all of humanity instead of a tyrant hellbent on dominating this measly little planet.  He doesn't kill people.  He tries to understand his enemies. ...And this is why he's like that:  cue Man of Steel  People treat Man of Steel as if it's a Superman movie.  It's not.  That might be disappointing to some people that just want to see the Superman we know and love.  Snyder has chosen to show us the journey the character takes to become Superman and I fully anticipate that we won't see ""Superman"" (proper) until the end of BvS or until the next Man of Steel movie.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if the colors got a little brighter as the movie progresses, if the tone becomes lighter, and the world becomes more hopeful.  End the movie with a flying shot of Supes as a nod to Chris Reeve and now we've got our Superman."

I do suppose that if you take into account the changes Goyer/Snyder made to the Kents, then maybe it is an accurate way to depict Clark as a grown up: someone that bottles up anger, can't hold a Job, doesn't get friendly with others and needs to destroy a city and kill a person to know that is not the right thing to do."
superman,3d9xb3,nullmiah,6,Tue Jul 14 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"Please elaborate. How do I not respect the character?  As for your several paragraphs about the world and how it reacts to Superman: I don't have any issues with that. I am totally fine with this direction. I am not happy with how they made Clark and his parents.   My comment was simply a reaction to your assertion that Snyder doesn't respect/understand the character.  After watching the special features on Man of Steel and listening to him talk in interviews, I feel like he understands the Superman character better than nearly any other director in the past.  Richard Donner ""understood"" Superman as much as the general public did in that he knew what he looked like and what people expected out of him.  Snyder, on the other hand, understands the character's motivation and struggle in our world.  If you don't think they understand and respect the character, then I'm simply unconvinced that you do.  That's all...   If a 30yo man doesn't know how he is, we have problems.   Why?  He's not an ordinary 30 year old man.  He's an alien that's always been alone for over 30 years, hiding who he is.  How could he possibly know or understand where he fits into the world?   I do suppose that if you take into account the changes Goyer/Snyder made to the Kents, then maybe it is an accurate way to depict Clark as a grown up: someone that bottles up anger, can't hold a Job, doesn't get friendly with others and needs to destroy a city and kill a person to know that is not the right thing to do.   This is a perfect example of why I don't think you understand the character.  He doesn't bottle up anger.  He has to confront it because he has no outlet for it like everyone else does.  If he did, he might hurt somebody.  The restaurant/trucker scene is a perfect example of that.  He's struggling to be a human being because he can feel all the same emotions but yet he's not the same as a human at all.  It's not that he can't get friendly, it's that he's afraid to.  He, literally, knows nothing about his past or who he is or what he's capable of until he finds the ship.  Lastly, the last 2 points are just disingenuous and ignorant.  He didn't destroy a city on purpose.  He didn't kill because he wanted to and just ignored the fact that it was a bad thing.  He'd literally never been in a fight before in his life and was suddenly in a fight with someone that was, arguably, much more powerful and a better fighter than he was.  You tell me what other choice he had (besides the completely laughable ""he could have taken him out to space"" or ""he could have moved the fight to a less populated place"") and maybe there's a dialogue to be had.  He didn't have another choice.  Ultimately, if that decision forces him to grow into Superman, then it's a great development of the character."

superman,3d9xb3,nullmiah,3,Wed Jul 15 00:27:14 2015 UTC,"I do not respect the goyer/Snyder superman. I have the utmost respect for the comic book superman character.   So which comic book Superman character are you referring to?   Superman: Birthright? Superman: Secret Origin? What about the New 52?  Based on the material that Goyer/Snyder used in MoS, I think it's clear that they are borrowing heavily from The New 52 source material. Superman didn't really come out until Brainiac attacked. He was more cynical with humanity than not in the series as well.  Even The New 52 Justice League pitted Superman against Green Lantern and Batman until they were united in common cause against Darkseid. I see that plot-line being echoed closely in BvS.  So how exactly is Goyer/Snyder Superman different than The New 52? They are two different interpretations of Kal-el's growth into Superman..."
superman,3d9xb3,dpkonofa,0,Wed Jul 15 12:45:07 2015 UTC,"Most comic iterations of Superman are great. I was not a fan of Earth One, either. They seemed to have made a emo, smart ass out of Clark. The new52 superman you're referring to is from the Justice league run, I think. I haven't read it. I have been reading the Superman comic from New52 and it is the Superman I know and love. I haven't read the Grant Morrison t-shirt and jeans Superman, so I can't comment on that."

Clark Kent, the boy who grew up in Kansas, has to decide if he really wants this job. He helped on the oil platform because he was finally away from home and really wanted to understand what he could do. Then Zod forced his hand; he had to act because Zod was looking for him specifically.   But does he want to intervene in natural disasters, wars, etc? It's an interesting question without a completely obvious answer. Clark needs to weave some moral cloth from disparate fibers to understand how setting an example for humanity will benefit them in the long term.  Heck, even Reeve's Superman had these questions, see the scene added back into the Donner cut where he goes to Jor-El after his first appearance as Superman."
superman,3d9xb3,RickRussellTX,-1,Wed Jul 15 05:32:59 2015 UTC,I think you have some really cool ideas about Superman figuring out his place in the world but I don't remember those being themes in Man of Steel at all.
superman,3d9xb3,TomCollinsEsq,2,Wed Jul 15 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"His exposure was forced by extortion, his experience with his father's AI was limited. Reeve's Clark Kent spent months if not years learning from the Kryptonian libraries that came with his ship, as well as the AI of Jor-El. Cavill's Clark Kent met his father's AI for perhaps days, at most. Why does Clark go to church for guidance? Because he doesn't have anything else to turn to, really.   Unless you want to do the ""I'll just talk to my space dad"" scenario.  Now that Zod is gone and Clark's secret identity is relatively well-preserved, Cavill's Clark could go back to being an anonymous lobsterman or any other job he wants. Or he could become a super-activist godlike hero and save people 24/7/365. Or he could try to find a middle ground. I don't think it's a stretch to suppose that future films will explore these questions."

Alas, Zod knew how to fly by that point and was able to evade the continued aerial attacks, so Kal settled for trying, with varying levels of success, to keep the fight in areas with few people in them."

He's not looking at them maybe because he doesn't want to be viewed as this God or something had alerted his attention.   The shot of him above the people is just a Hollywood shot to set him up as a saviour before he actually saves them (seriously do you think he's actually just hovering there and not going to save them at all?) plus it fits the trailer with the line about devils in the sky.
superman,3d9xb3,temjrpgh,-4,Wed Jul 15 01:17:25 2015 UTC,It's up for debate until the film comes out. I'm just going by the trailer. I could be totally wrong about it.

superman,3d9xb3,sunsk,3,Thu Jul 16 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"You bring a very interesting point -- but allow me to interject:  I think the distance between Superman and humanity is intentional.  In Man of Steel -- we see Superman forced out into the open, using his power for the first time in its fullest. Yeah, he was a mother of all fucked up. But he did saved the world, nevertheless.  Now, BvS focus on his connection with humanity. Looking back at MoS, he has this social awkwardness (which account for lack of jokes, tiff-ness, and clothes stealing). That social awkwardness is still being translated in BvS but under huge scrutiny for his action. That's enough to cower even the most powerful man on Earth simply because he has the humility to be cowered in the first place.  So I really like the approach that Goyer/Snyder is taking with Superman. In the comic book, Superman is always making the right decision. Even from the very beginning when he first came out at Superman. It wasn't until later edition, one-shot, that authors began to add more humility into Superman, making him more infallible.   So the author of that article has a point, but I think it's from a certain point of view. Goyer/Snyder are clearly exploring this from a different point of view and I for one am intrigued with that particular point of view and that particular universe as it resonance with real-world more closely than comic book could.."
superman,3d9xb3,belladoyle,0,Tue Jul 14 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"Your absolutely right, while it is a valid point that to the people Round him in the movies he's an it, the industry itself doesn't get it. That's visible by his lines, and his attitude. In new relatively modern comic continuities superman hasn't acted like that. I agree with the article. If you look at how superman acts and carries himself in the movies it isn't the character from the comic books."
superman,3d9xb3,nermid,2,Wed Jul 15 02:13:26 2015 UTC,Agreed. The article was so concerned about trying to prove how much better the author knows superman's character than synder does that he just wanted to say his piece rather than give an actual analysis. The article completely ignores the events outside of superman's control that happened in the film.
superman,3d9xb3,runnerofshadows,4,Wed Jul 15 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"He was dragged out by the acts of a conquerer.    I've never liked this for Superman. We all agree that Superman is best summed up as a good guy that just wants to help people. So I think it really undermines part of the character by painting him as a reluctant hero, as a reaction. And reacting kind of sums up a lot of what he does in the movie. He reacts to Pa and Jor-El, he reacts to Zod and the choices Zod presents to him. And it's not just Man of Steel. It happens in Earth One as well and my opinions extends to any story that cuts a similar path.   I like the active Superman. The one that acts upon the world and the people he interacts with. To me that's part of the inspiration. He takes his decisions into his own hands."

What he wants most out of life is to be like everybody else. To be Clark Kent. He puts on the suit and saves lives because he thinks it's the right thing to do with the power he has, but if he didn't see it as a thing he had to do, he wouldn't.  One of my favorite examples of this is when he's depowered after the Infinite Crisis and the Corps gives him a Green Lantern ring. His willpower creates a green suit and tie and a hat with a little PRESS tag, because what he really wants to do with his life is be Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great Metropolitan Newspaper. Not Kal-El, last surviving son of Krypton. Not Superman, strange protector from another world.  His entire career is a reluctant reaction to the world."

superman,3d9xb3,alchemeron,2,Wed Jul 15 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. My favorite thing about Morrison's run on Action is that he started being Superman as a young man, fresh out of college, without a whole lot of plan for how to do it. he just knew he wanted to change the world and that he had the power to do it- so he did.  I like Man of Steel, but it completely missed the chance to give us a proactive Superman who wants to make the world a better place. Instead, like Earth One, it hands him purpose on a silver platter by giving him aliens to fight. Boring.  On the other hand, both Morrison and Waid's reboot of Superman have involved him almost giving up due to public xenophobia. You could read that as an admission that a world without super-threats is no place for a Superman, and that like Hugo Danner before him, people wouldn't understand him or tolerate him unless they needed him to protect them from super-threats. That's a damn depressing thought which just came to me."
superman,3d9xb3,bliffer,40,Thu Jul 16 04:46:47 2015 UTC,The movie hasn't even came out yet and he's writing like he's already seen it.
superman,3d9xb3,20forlife,11,Tue Jul 14 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"Man of Steel is out and it seems reasonable to me to assume that they will continue the characterisation they set up. The trailers certainly don't look any different.  What's wrong with having a critical discussion based off that? Plenty of people are on the other, wildly praising the movie."
superman,3d9xb3,nermid,11,Tue Jul 14 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"Because in Man of Steel he wasnt even Superman. That's why it's called Man of Steel. You find it hard to believe that it actually takes something drastic to go and change a person to a certain degree where now he knows how to be after past events? Thus birthing Superman before our eyes. In that trailer alone he saves the rocket ship crew, all the people from that burning building, and the flood victims how is that not Superman?"
superman,3d9xb3,sunsk,-2,Tue Jul 14 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"Because in Man of Steel he wasnt even Superman. That's why it's called Man of Steel.   This has nothing to do with what the article is saying whatsoever. It's discussing why the movie is the way it is, why this development was chosen."
superman,3d9xb3,alchemeron,14,Tue Jul 14 23:23:45 2015 UTC,"I don't get the ""too powerful"" complaint when writers give every other character some ridiculous, unconvincing, ultra-specific gadget for every given situation."

superman,3d9xb3,nermid,3,Wed Jul 15 10:01:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the main premise of this article.  We did see the Superman he talks about in Man of Steel, but we saw him before he became Superman.  We saw a young man who knew he was different, more powerful and was using those powers to help and rescue people.  We then saw this same young man suddenly thrown into battle; no longer a simple rescue, but a fight with people who were quickly becoming as powerful as him and who, unlike him, were trained fighters.  In fact, I think the killing of General Zod will be a building block, an important one, in turning Clark Kent into the Superman who inspires us all, the man who has the power to be the most successful tyrant, the most selfish being in history, who chooses to use his powers, to help, rescue, and fight for truth, justice, and the American way."
superman,3d9xb3,TareXmd,6,Wed Jul 15 01:19:58 2015 UTC,"Superman is an extremely human character, both in the comics and in Snyder's universe. Yeah he can do things we can't, and finds himself in situations we won't find ourselves in, but can the same not be said about any other super hero? Superhero films aren't enjoyable because you don't know whether the hero will win, or because you don't know if the hero will wind up doing the right thing. We know supes is gonna save the day, just like we know iron man or batman or spider man or whoever is going to save the day. The entertainment is the journey.   Sure superman is an incredibly nice person even by super hero standards, and sure he is especially powerful, but that doesn't mean he doesn't face dilemmas. The fact is every other character can say something along the lines of ""what can I do? I'm only human."" But Superman is that person who can't, someone who has to face every dilemma head on and actually make a decision. When one false step can level a city, how can a man not agonize over what the right thing to do is? When are you no longer helping people and just living life for them? How evil does someone have to be for you to interfere? How can I afford to spend time with Lois or Ma when a child is crying for her mother a thousand miles away? Supes is always going to do what's right, but sometimes what's right isn't clear.   I think MoS did an excellent job showing Clark wrestling with a few of these issues. I don't want to see a superman movie where he saves the day by lifting something heavy, I don't want a superman movie which is really just a cheap social commentary. I want to see Clark fly home to smallville and ask Martha if she thinks he did the right thing or not. I want to see Superman do the right thing when doing the right thing isn't easy. I want to see him having an awkward conversation with lois because he honestly has no idea what to say to lois.  ""It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then... He shoots fire from the skies and it is difficult not to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to him."" - Batman"
superman,3d9xb3,TareXmd,8,Wed Jul 15 08:06:19 2015 UTC,"I actually like his analysis of what makes Superman an excellent character, but I disagree with him that Snyder & Co don't understand this or haven't conveyed it on film.   I actually think Snyder & Goyer got it 100% right in MoS, a movie that keeps getting better and better each time I watch it. I also think BvS will continue this.  Superman also isn't just one thing. He's both just a very good, normal, person, and a god among men. He can, and should, be conveyed as both. Snyder pulled that off in MoS and the trailers for BvS conveys this perfectly."
superman,3d9xb3,TareXmd,9,Wed Jul 15 02:06:42 2015 UTC,"This guy clearly has a broad understanding of Superman, but his idea of what Superman should be in a film is pretty narrow. Superman is literally the oldest superhero in the modern sense. That makes him well defined, but it also means there are many more iterations of the character than your average superhero. Batman is in a similar place as a character, but I think that people generally have an easier time taking batman serious, and there is a more defined consensus of what Batman should be like. THAT is what makes superman more difficult by comparison."
superman,3d9xb3,TareXmd,5,Tue Jul 14 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"people generally have an easier time taking batman serious, and there is a more defined consensus of what Batman should be like   Except for Adam West Batman. And Brave and the Bold Batman. And George Clooney Batman. And Superfriends Batman.  People have an easier time taking Batman seriously today. That has not been the case for most of the character's life."
superman,3d9xb3,TareXmd,2,Tue Jul 14 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"That's totally true. I think people generally give Frank Miller credit for changing perceptions about Batman in the 80's, but there has still been some pretty goofy batman since then. I'm not saying Batman is an easy character to portray, but I am saying that Superman is a particularly difficult character to portray."
superman,3d9xb3,TheGreatRao,2,Tue Jul 14 23:54:25 2015 UTC,"For all the camp it has through today's eyes, Burton's film in '89 helped, as well. Miller did it for readers, and Burton did it for viewers.  And then Schumacher did his damnedest to undo it for viewers.  I agree with your point, though. Superman is pretty tough to get right. It's a fine line between this and this."
superman,3d9xb3,ez_sleazy,3,Wed Jul 15 00:08:41 2015 UTC,It looks like an article about the Reeve Superman movies. MoS did the best job yet to show Kal-El's humanity. BvS does the best job to show our response to that.

superman,3d9xb3,TeamStark31,0,Thu Jul 16 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"Because he doesn't once refer to the Donner movies or says that he wishes Man of Steel was more like them. He doesn't Man of Steel to a version from 20 years ago, he compares it to one that's in the comics right now."
superman,3d9xb3,Schlessel,2,Thu Jul 16 02:09:53 2015 UTC,"He said Hollywood is not getting Superman right. I said he seems to be referring to what the Donner movies have been doing, since -IMO- it doesn't apply to MoS. He didn't mention Donner or Reeve; I said what he wrote applies more to them."
superman,3d9xb3,dHUMANb,0,Thu Jul 16 02:58:03 2015 UTC,Oh ok that explains the confusion. How did you have that reading? Because he specifically says that Man of Steel falls short of the mark. This article is critical of the new cinematic Superman.

superman,3de6dw,batinthebelfry5,5,Wed Jul 15 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"I love the Kents. They love Clark as much as any iteration of the Kents... They're unfortunately victims of lines that can be read in very different ways. For example, when Pa is saying ""maybe"" you do see a lot of people jump the gun and say PA IS TELLING SUPERMAN TO LET THEM DIE, whereas I thought it was completely honest as a father. It was right to save them, but as a father, he doesn't want to risk his (I'm guessing) 11-ish year old son... He doesn't want to put that weight on his young shoulders and he doesn't want any not so friendly parties finding out about Clark.  As for Martha's line in the trailer, I feel like it's treated much like the above line in some crowds. When she says ""Be anything they need, or be none of it. You don't owe this world a thing. You never did."" from what I've seen, it's jumped on as a MA IS SAYING SCREW THE WORLD. Again, it's got a few different interpretations... My view on it is less that and more of a ""don't do it out of some debt you think you have. do it out of love for them."" Which I reckon is a lot better thing to say than yeah you owe them... But, as I said, there are a lot of interpretations of it and that's just mine. I could absolutely be wrong, but I do love the Kents and I believe they raised Clark right for the world they're living in."
superman,3de6dw,chanmanthe2nd,4,Thu Jul 16 11:30:44 2015 UTC,"I was okay with Martha. Not a huge fan of Jonathan. Someone actually posted something on here about people not liking MoS, and part of my response is relative to this thread as well:   Honestly the only think I didn't like was Jonathan Kent. He was conflicted as to whether Clark ought to be saving people at the risk of exposing himself, and that conflict literally killed him. I feel like the other iterations of Jonathan have been more resolute and are the reason Superman is as idealistic as he is in all the other iterations. He had Jonathan raising him, and Jonathan stuck to his convictions, so Clark did too, and it shaped the man he becomes. We just didn't get very much of that in MoS. I felt like Clark had more connection with Jor-El than he did Jonathan, and that sort of irked me."
superman,3de6dw,LieutenantDanzig,2,Wed Jul 15 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with your assessment and I think it was very intentional. I believe that for the DCCU they really wanna push the Sci-Fi angle of the character and make Superman Kal-El the alien more than Clark the farmboy from Kansas. Sure his history at Kent farm is still there, (imagine the shitstorm that would have happened if they changed THAT!) but it's diminished.   The film focused on Jor-El a lot more than Jonathan Kent, and played Jor-El as a masculine man of science. He fucks his wife in a world where there is only in-vitro procreation, he shoots space guns and puts on a space mecha to go toe-to-toe with Zod, he even is crucial in defeating Zod on Earth, and most importantly he's the only parental figure of Clark's that fully support his super-heroics.  It's all an attempt to ""modernize"" Superman by distancing him further from humanity.  Granted, thats just my assumptions from where I see things leading based on one movie and a trailer. If I remember correctly, Martha hasn't really said much about what she thinks of her son being Superman in MOS so I'm making the assumption that she's ambivalent towards it based on her little speech in BvS."

Part of this may have been a symptom of reboot-itis, where the filmmakers struggle to come up with something to differentiate themselves from the previous incarnation (see: Amazing Spider-Man and the hoops Webb jumped through just to avoid reiterating ""With great power..."")  They clearly didn't want to ape Glenn Ford and John Schneider and while I commend them for that, the alternative was muddled and ineffective.   Even his death was a result of wanting to avoid ""tradition,"" but in doing so took a very human element and made it very silly. The tornado scene was just poorly scripted."

Start by discrediting him to the point that the general public are afraid of him. If he loses the support of the people it would be much easier to actually take him out and then youd be known as the man who destroyed the evil alien tyrant.

superman,3d0vuc,Targeryan,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:35 2015 UTC,"I vaguely remember, not 100% sure on this, a book which talked about a group of greek mercenaries that ventured deeply in enemy (persians... ?) territories, in a line it said that their enemies called them red (crimson) capes and were so feared that the sight of the capes alone was enough to deter persians from attacking.   The first time i heard the line i tought it was a sick reference to this in some way but your explanation seems way more likely."

superman,3cy6bz,whatudontlikefalafel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:55:55 2015 UTC,"This I believe could happen.    I wrote a Superman script years ago which was sort of the same idea, except it was Luthor that turned into Doomsday.  Kryptonite poisoning gave him cancer, he used some of Superman's DNA to try and clone himself the perfect body.  For a while it worked and then it went to hell and he ended up morphing into Doomsday.  So if I can come up with the idea I'm sure a real writer could.  On the other hand, in the special features on MoS there's a shot of Kryptonian language from the crashed ship that says ""beware Bertron's curse"" which leads me to believe Doomsday may be a Kryptonian thing specifically."

I think they know he stopped Zod, but to them, they probably think Zod only came there because of him in the first place. Whether he saved the world or not is probable irrelevant to the people holding those signs as they probably think supes created the mess he ended up having to clean up, and now they blame him for it."

superman,3czak0,CoorsFight,5,Sun Jul 12 09:48:43 2015 UTC,"I can think of maybe some reasons.    Perhaps they didn't want the competition of another species in the solar system.  Wipe out humans, it's all theirs.  Others:  Presumably they still need to be in the ""Goldilocks zone"" to have a habitable planet.  If they terraformed Mars or Venus and created a New Krypton with water it wouldn't survive, it's not in that zone.  Earth is.  They had to set up shop here.  yet more reasons:  I wonder if the terraforming wouldn't entirely have destroyed Earth.  It may have simply altered the earth and atmosphere, leaving some of the infrastructure intact.  They could still have dwellings, roadways, power sources, food sources.  The process may have also altered the biological makeup of certain life, maybe it would have killed humanoid life but plant or animal life would adapt to the new atmosphere, providing food sources for the new Kryptonians."

superman,3czak0,neoblackdragon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:30 2015 UTC,Really he just did it to earth to kill Kal-El.

Supes either needs to  be nerfed to the point where it wouldn't be fun or he would just be so OP that it isn't fun. That being said, if someone were to figure it out and make a good game, I would play it because I do love me some Kal."

I see this sentiment a lot when people discuss the possibility of a Superman game, and I really don't agree with it. I do think that Supes would need to be nerfed, but it's not like a balance can't be struck that allows the right amount of player tension while also fulfilling the power fantasy.   Ideally I'd like them to have two main kinds of gameplay scenarios that cater to power and vulnerability. For the former these would be like 'rescue' situations - a burning apartment building with trapped residents, a bank robbery with hostages, etc. Fulfill the Superman fantasy by having players effortlessly walk through blazing fires, or have bullets fired by visibly frustrated criminals pitifully bounce off of Supes. These would be puzzle-oriented sections, requiring players to determine how to best manipulate the environment to save innocent civilians.   Combat scenarios would be where vulnerability comes into play. Now Supes is the one in danger. Introduce enemies that could feasibly hurt the man of steel (kryptonite wielding mercenaries, highly advanced robots, any number of Superman's alien foes). Superman wouldn't be as squishy as Batman is in the Arkham games. He'd have a somewhat meaty healthbar. However, he could easily be overwhelmed by large numbers of foes if the player wasn't skillful with power management."

superman,3crmag,srstone71,3,Fri Jul 10 13:08:34 2015 UTC,It's still about George Reeves' career and life. I enjoyed the movie.
superman,3crmag,Johnny_Stooge,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"Hollywoodland is like 2 movies, the Ben Affleck Superman stuff is gold, the Adrian Brodie Detective Louis Cemo stuff is weak."
superman,3crmag,TheCoreyClem,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:25:56 2015 UTC,I remember when they cast Affleck I thought that was funny. The movie was good though. Correct in assuming it's not really about Supes but it was a cool look back at the Superman of the past and how he USED to be portrayed and admired
superman,3cj43r,creatorman5,14,Wed Jul 8 08:48:12 2015 UTC,"I really can't place my finger on what exactly is doing it, but for some reason this picture just looks like it was taken circa 1997. Like I'm looking at Nickelodeon magazine or something. I really can't figure out why."
superman,3cj43r,LieutenantDanzig,11,Wed Jul 8 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"This looks like a photo of the page, not a scan or a digital copy, so that might be it."
superman,3cj43r,wallaby_al,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:02 2015 UTC,Its the lighting of the shot and the resolution
superman,3cj43r,thecoffee,4,Wed Jul 8 19:33:55 2015 UTC,I like how they kept the armor-like appearance while still changing the colors.
superman,3cj43r,calidoc,5,Wed Jul 8 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"Man, is he a handsome guy."
superman,3cj43r,supermanfan122508,7,Wed Jul 8 22:17:53 2015 UTC,Looks like they brightened it up! Now if only they can get him to smile...
superman,3cj43r,Gambit1024,6,Wed Jul 8 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"He has such a nice smile, too. You can feel the happy when he does. It's why the ""first flight"" scene is my absolute favorite part of Man of Steel. There's just so much joy there. It's almost magical."
superman,3cj43r,supermanfan122508,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:17:37 2015 UTC,The suit has always been bright. It's the filters that were used that dulled the color. Well to be fair I do think the BVS is a brighter blue but the MOS suit is pretty bright blue in reality.
superman,3cj43r,neoblackdragon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Question, is the other EW mag still out? The one with Batsy, Supes and WW??  I've been looking for it, can't seem to find it in my area.  (I hope I haven't missed it -grumbles-) And is this one from the Deadpool issue??"
superman,3cioip,royal_dump,16,Wed Jul 8 05:24:41 2015 UTC,That scene was perfectly for showing you who Superman is.
superman,3cioip,ImaginaryFri3nd,11,Wed Jul 8 17:22:27 2015 UTC,His first punch in the movie. I loved that part.
superman,3cioip,ThunderHawkLives,4,Wed Jul 8 18:16:22 2015 UTC,Think how good it felt for him after all those years. Finally being able to hit someone who could take it.
superman,3cioip,Bleezy79,2,Thu Jul 9 00:29:35 2015 UTC,I loved this scene
superman,3cioip,JMPesce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"This really shows you just how much Kal loves Martha, and I love that a lot."
superman,3cioip,Tserraknight,23,Fri Jul 10 11:10:35 2015 UTC,"I dunno, if someone threatened my Vulnerable, not weak, vulnerable, mother and I had all that power against someone with that same power it seemed honestly short. I could easily be pissed that long, and im just some random dude."
superman,3cioip,kfpswf,9,Wed Jul 8 08:20:59 2015 UTC,You aren't alone in feeling that way.
superman,3cioip,Tserraknight,3,Wed Jul 8 10:20:17 2015 UTC,"That could have worked too, but I did like the current phrasing becuase it felt more zero-tolerance policy concerning Martha. I always felt, for the greater universe, I always felt like the justice league would all do what they could to protect her in particular. There was that episode where J'onn went to the kents for Christmas in JL(u?) Barry would empathize as would Bruce. It might be headcannon more than reality but I always felt Martha was the ultimate ""Off Limits"" and I really liked the rage at the violation of that. Again, it plays into my biases but, I did like it."
superman,3cioip,littlejohn134,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:42:33 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm thinking more Hulk that Kal-El
superman,3cioip,mydarkmeatrises,-16,Wed Jul 8 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, still seems lame to me."
superman,3cioip,dcfan99,10,Wed Jul 8 21:22:57 2015 UTC,The Donnorverse isn't coming back. Sorry.
superman,3cioip,stealingyourpixels,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:07:00 2015 UTC,Why is everyone in /r/superman so defensive?
superman,3cioip,mydarkmeatrises,-7,Wed Jul 8 10:53:21 2015 UTC,That's only unfortunate for you all who like their movies to resemble video games. Too bad you'll never witness the perfected superhero movie that is Superman'78
superman,3cioip,ElCrowing,3,Wed Jul 8 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"Superman handles his origins quite well, but in my opinion, completely falls apart after that. It's just way campier than I like my Superman."
superman,3cioip,anonwb,-9,Thu Jul 9 06:00:30 2015 UTC,You mean man of murder?
superman,3chw1f,ohtheplacesiwent,15,Wed Jul 8 01:07:11 2015 UTC,Looks a lot like Gerard Christopher to me.
superman,3chw1f,alchemeron,21,Wed Jul 8 01:12:28 2015 UTC,George Reeves forgotten again.
superman,3chw1f,MarcReyes,11,Wed Jul 8 02:13:18 2015 UTC,And Kirk Alyn.
superman,3chw1f,RanmaCanada,5,Wed Jul 8 05:14:57 2015 UTC,and Ben Affleck (playing George Reeves)
superman,3chw1f,Ginger-Nerd,4,Wed Jul 8 09:49:05 2015 UTC,"I see Affleck, Reeve, and... Catherine Zeta-Jones?"
superman,3chw1f,basiamille,2,Wed Jul 8 01:49:34 2015 UTC,She sleep beneath lasers
superman,3chw1f,CamTheGringo,3,Wed Jul 8 04:18:30 2015 UTC,They look like RL versions of the DCAU versions.
superman,3chw1f,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,3,Wed Jul 8 02:44:35 2015 UTC,How did I not know about Adrianne Palicki!
superman,3chw1f,Whovian4291,6,Wed Jul 8 01:43:49 2015 UTC,Probably because the Wonder Woman pilot she shot never got picked up for a series. I don't know if anyone ever saw it.
superman,3chw1f,sexandliquor,2,Wed Jul 8 02:25:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure a copy of the pilot was leaked online, though I'm not certain about that."
superman,3chw1f,Dorkside,6,Wed Jul 8 02:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was leaked. And it was horrible."
superman,3chw1f,SelfProclaimedNerd,3,Wed Jul 8 02:55:09 2015 UTC,"Man! Bruce and Kal look amazing! But Diana definitely needs some black hair shooped onto her. She doesn't look like Wonder Woman at all to me and I can't tell if it's just the hair or if it's the face itself.  Anyway, that's a surprisingly young looking Superman (probably why he resembles Gerard Christopher) and a surprisingly older looking Bruce Wayne. Looks great!"
superman,3chw1f,Adekis,2,Wed Jul 8 05:37:14 2015 UTC,I very hastily shopped 'Kal' onto a Superman body.  http://imgur.com/qUAd9ZN
superman,3chw1f,ultrasargent,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:50:50 2015 UTC,I would love to see that Batman face shooped into a couple of costumes.

superman,3chw1f,Ximitar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:56:53 2015 UTC,i see the philipeno superman guy in there
superman,3chw1f,seankay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"The right side is Christopher, the left is Tom, the lips and chin look to be Henry, the nose might be Brandon, and I think the rest is Dean."
superman,3chw1f,supermanfan122508,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:23:55 2015 UTC,You can see a lot of routh in the superman face.
superman,3chw1f,Shooter-Mcgavinn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:49:49 2015 UTC,Saw this in a comment on the Batman subreddit and thought you all would enjoy it.
superman,3cipe3,royal_dump,3,Wed Jul 8 05:34:59 2015 UTC,Wait is Schnyder going all Bruce Timm and having a Batman and Wonderwoman as love interests?
superman,3cipe3,patfrickincassels,5,Wed Jul 8 10:47:21 2015 UTC,Sometimes and man and woman can dance and not be romantic.
superman,3cipe3,neoblackdragon,2,Wed Jul 8 18:58:39 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he's the reason I'm biased against seeing WW/Superman love interest poses being an avid non-comic-reading fan.
superman,3cipe3,LTmad,3,Wed Jul 8 19:24:16 2015 UTC,I want Snyder's shirt in the last picture!
superman,3cipe3,HylianLibrarian,2,Wed Jul 8 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Is that Bat signal picture available in ""high res""? I would love that as my wallpaper if it was possible.
