feedthebeast,3e27tf,TheMerricat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need to edit any mods, its a way to place the drives that works by default.  You'll really want to look up the SSD for a complete explanation, but it works by setting up six drive bays as a subnetwork and adds an interface and storage bus. You attach the SSD up to your main network by taking an interface from the main network and connecting it to the storage bus of the SSD. Because you do it that way, the whole thing only takes one channel from the main network.  When the SSD is full, you just build a new SSD and connect it up using the interface from the old SSD and the storage bus fr the new one. This can be done indefinitely for all intents and purposes, and it still will only take one channel from your main network."

Just one more thing: i'm currently builing a big building with a high nummber of machines. And so i wanted to ask you if you could tell me how it is possible to connect 2 networks with each other with acces to everything which is connected on both networks. So that it is possible to access the inventory @ building 2 and 1 which is located in b1 and have acces to the machines in b2 through crafting terminals or other terminals in b1. because as i know it is not possible to connect 2 controller via cable :/
feedthebeast,3e27tf,Zeoic,2,Tue Jul 21 18:49:44 2015 UTC,"There was an earlier comment in this thread talking about a super soaryn drive, this uses a technique that can solve your problem.   In AE2, there is a block called a Storage Bus, having it plugged into your AE system, and it facing a block with an inventory, will allow you to use that inventory as a sort of storage cell. If you used two storage busses from two different systems together, you can see the whole other system from one terminal.   You can also send the AE power over quartz fibre cable ( it only transmits power, no data) so you can also only need to power one system for both to work."

feedthebeast,3e42t3,Sunconure11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:53 2015 UTC,"It varies depending exactly on the pipe - but you are correct, by and large.  Rather than use a Modelling program like Techne or Blendr which generate either importable files or javacode representations of a bunch of cubes, most pipes use ISBRH renderers. There are a bunch of reasons for this but simple put: they are MUCH more efficient when it comes to rendering - they only render once (unless updated), like normal blocks, and are then cached for future re-renders, whereas models (implemented through Tile Entity Special Renderers) update every render tick.  Now - as for the actual implementation - like I said - it depends, however generally speaking the renderer will have a way of rendering a central ""hub"" and then another piece which goes from that hub to the middle of the block's face. The renderer then just needs to check what pipes are in adjacent blocks (and thus which it needs to connect to) and then rotates that connection part accordingly.  Hope that helps"

Edit: someone made a reference to suggesting that Vazkii add 'rape vines' to Botania, seemingly as a follow-up to some of the hentai jokes people were making. The person complaining was referring to that comment and not your whole thread. (Honestly I wouldn't consider it a rape joke so much as a crack about common hentai tropes, but that's a whole separate discussion.)

feedthebeast,3e23x3,woodlark14,4,Tue Jul 21 10:55:10 2015 UTC,This is a AE system that takes in water and produces minechem elements. i have only added 20 or so right now but you can add the patterns for all the elements. Eventually i would like to add chemical synthesizers to all the production of just about everything but that will take forever to make all the patterns.
feedthebeast,3e23x3,hilburn,5,Tue Jul 21 10:57:36 2015 UTC,"If you get close, let me know - I'll add more molecules.  If you are willing to get a bit creative with your AE system, what you can do is use a turtle with a Chemical peripheral and a journal to interface with the synthesizer - then you could request things by placing it in the turtle's inventory, it then selects the right recipe in the journal and places it in the synthesiser and the AE system could then extract the crafted item. At least - that's what I did when I tried this but I only had it crafting like 5 things because I was lazy"
feedthebeast,3e23x3,Kiux97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:31:20 2015 UTC,Does it take only water? Can we have a clearer explanation? World link?
feedthebeast,3e23x3,Kiux97,2,Tue Jul 21 14:03:58 2015 UTC,It takes in water then splits it into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen and the fused and fissioned by the ae system to make any element.
feedthebeast,3e23x3,Kiux97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:15:51 2015 UTC,"How can hydrogen and oxygen make any element? And what are those ""fused"" and ""fissioned""? I know their meaning"
feedthebeast,3e23x3,TheMerricat,3,Tue Jul 21 14:19:55 2015 UTC,Minechem allows you to split element and fuse the together ie two hydrogen makes helium also the oxygen can be split into two smaller elements. So I can craft any element from water.
feedthebeast,3e23x3,Kiux97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"I assume ""any"" is much? Because I dont recall hydrogen or oxygen as compounds, they are elements, you cant break them, or is it Minechem?"
feedthebeast,3e23x3,hilburn,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"In the real world you can potentially take two atoms of any elements and fuse them together to make a third element this is called fusion. In the real world it makes the sun go. In MineChem it just makes new elements.  In the real world, and the old school square periodic chart, the elements at the end of the chart were almost exclusively made in similar ways and did not exist naturally.  The opposite is fission, which takes a large atom and splits it in two to form two new elements. In the real world this is where most of our nuclear power and weapons come from. In MineChem, again, it just makes new elements."
feedthebeast,3e23x3,Bobboy5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks but , wouldn't that make minechem a lil' bit OP?"
feedthebeast,3e23x3,xavion,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you get to end game and devote... well the volume of about 7 chunks from bedrock to build limit would do it for the fusion/fission reactors - plus a way to store all the radioactive elements to prevent it decaying naturally. You would then need another 2-300 synthesisers to cover all the recombination recipes - as well as powering them etc etc.  OR you could install EE/Project E etc and do all that in 1 block, with less hassle, less effort and much higher output.  OP is what you make of it. imo - if someone wants to go to all that trouble to get all that stuff from water, then super - but it's not OP - especially compared with the ease of resource collection from quarries etc"
feedthebeast,3e23x3,hakuna_tamata,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:28 2015 UTC,Not really. The Multiblocks required to do it are insanely expensive and require extensive minechem work to get some of the elements required to craft the blocks. The fusion reactor also needs nether stars to run. This is the same reason Rotarycraft isn't OP.
feedthebeast,3e3rv1,Meticulouslack,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:43 2015 UTC,Using supplier pipes. If you have frames being autocrafted you don't even need to worry about keeping a stock since when frame is requested it will autocraft it and send it to the supplier pipe destination.

Also, I believe that there is an argument to task it to specific CPU's or at least to specify the number of cores to use.  I'd dedicate two cores minimum.  At the same time, increase the client memory in the FTB launcher to at least 4GB on the minimum side.  I'm not sure, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that should reduce the amount of data the client is asking for from the server by keeping more of it in the client's cache.  Look up the correct garbage collector argument.  I believe that there's one that's better for 64 bit.  Maybe someone else can provide the argument because I don't know it off the top of my head.

I haven't done much with space, but we do want to setup a base there and do a cross dimensional AE system.  So i would like to still use it.

I only configured allocated RAM.  Regarding cross-dimension AE system, you really should consider learning Logistics Pipes. Direwolf20 has a good spotlight on them. I'm saying this because (I'm biased and love the mod) you can link a Logistics pipes in other dimensions using a pair of pipes and Ender Chests.  You'll need 2 Ender Chests for each dimension you want to link to and a power supply (Tesseract, engines, whatever; just to power the LP Power Junction needed in every network (dimension). It is not a power hungry mod, so if it's just to connect and request to your main network, basic power is enough.  Back in 1.6.4 AE and LP could be linked. You could request from one another. that now is broken and is on their roadmap to fix. You can request items (except crafting) from AE2 to LP, but AE systems cannot see what is stored in LP systems."

Right now 1.7.10 Pack updated fairly often but suspect it will slow down eventually.  I haven't built it yet, but I believe AE2 has built-in support for doing cross dimension, it looks like a bit of work though but looks possible.  I love AE, but it's so expensive and time consuming to get the basics up now.  I can't stand 1000 chests everywhere.

I will go read your other post. in the meantime, I must ask: have you used magical mods before? Botania is nice and can allow automation (nothing like AE; I doubt anything comes near to AE)."

I got three mana pools filled from 8 hydro flower farm, was going to stack another 8 on top of it to have a total 16 producing mana but want to see what we can create with it to see if there is anything worth using it for.  I know we can generate ores with it, but I think that's kind of cheating and odd ball so I don't want to use it for that.    I wanted to look into Witchery as well.  I really love AE for the lack of chests and having everything in one place to craft and find, I only touched on the auto crafting part of it, since we play in survival, it takes a while to build stuff up at times."

It's a dimension in eternal twilight where no mobs spawn on any block that has clear view of the sky. Also has dungeons and a lot of places to explore. Since Twilight forest has it's ground level close to bedrock, ore gen is compact. Meaning you find a lot of stuff faster by digging.  Other dimensions can be made. That's right, made. Using Mystcraft (magical, has a bit of randomness to it; might be fun for your kid to delve into) and RFtools (which is more precise but needs power to keep the dimension open).

Each random dimension you create has a library near where you spawn (or at least most do; I once got into a dimension that was full of trees and gave up finding the library, as I couldn't see anything below the trees on the map).  The library has 5 visible Mystcraft pages visible on lecterns as soon as you walk in, and may have a lot more on one of the cirners of the room, hidden behind a bookshelf, inside a chest.  Never go into a Mystcraft dimension without a linking book linked to the Overworld. If you die there, you respawn there. You are locked in there forever, unless you use cheats.  Also, never go there without a form of flying."

feedthebeast,3e2prj,Nightcaste,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"On the right set of squares, just chose the colour of each slot for each side of the machine. If you look carefully to the machine GUI, you will notice that any item slot as a colour. The input is usually red, I think, and output blue. If it has more then one input, the slot will have the colour around it. With this colour information, you just choose the correct colour for each side of the machine using the set of squares on the right.  Ignore the input on/off and the left squares unless you start painting items. Also, auto eject is always nice to have if the tubes dont auto-exctract."

feedthebeast,3e3l7f,That_Batman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"Depending on exactly what you are doing, this can be viable. If you don't need full access to all your items in your AE system, then tesseracts can work.  An example of this, I wanted to autocraft nether stars on demand (This was one of those exercises in ""can I?"" rather than ""should I?""). I wasn't comfortable building and containing withers right in the middle of my base, so I put it in a deep underground chamber. I have an AE Interface pointing to a tesseract that sends 4 soul sand and 3 wither skulls to my RFTools wither killing setup. When the wither dies, the items are collected and sent back through the tesseract.  Of course this isn't without its own limitations. You need two tesseracts for each setup, since they each need their own tesseract channel.  But most of my automated setups are pretty self-contained. My tree farms don't need extra items from my AE system, so I just use a tesseract to provide power, and to send items back home. If that's all you need it to do, then that's exactly what tesseracts will be good for."
feedthebeast,3e3l7f,thesixler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"Tesseract Ideas: Have an incoming channel for the network. This tesseract will import its items to the network. Anywhere you drop a farm or a quarry, you just set it to send to the incoming channel, and poof, its good to go. To make things run smoothly you'll want a chest adjacent to the destination tesseract, and hook up your import buses to that.   Trash channel. Have a similar setup that exports trash into a tesseract that links up to a Matter Condenser. I dunno how well exporting directly into a tesseract works so I would probably export to a chest and use itemducts to shoot the items through the tesseract into the matter condenser as the destination chest.  Use Tesseracts for wireless power.  Use Tesseracts to Export Items to Off base locations, which are then imported into an offsite AE network that is independently powered via tesseract. I have a void world base but I farm in the overworld. A small network controls the inventory, much more than a big old chest might, and I have emitters that control the export of materials into my home network.  If you think of a tesseract+separate network as a sort of analog to a quantum network bridge, you'll be able to do all sorts of fun stuff. But they aren't the same network, so stuff like crafting is going to have to be handled separately.  Also AE2 has a wireless terminal that you can jam full of upgrades and then you can access your network from a large radius. Each upgrade costs tons of network energy, but with a good power setup you can have a massive compound with wireless network access.  Also Also you can automate the construction of tesseracts with your AE network, it's great fun."

feedthebeast,3dx77e,colossalwaffles,5,Mon Jul 20 09:13:54 2015 UTC,Here: http://i.imgur.com/xagtYVQ.png  You can use special glass on the sides. The output current is determined be height of electrodes and capacity by electrolyte. You can either use water or sulphurous acid. The second gives much better results.  Configuration of electrodes is free but in short time we will change that instead of height of electrode determining current it will be its area touching electrolyte.  The costs of building one are high but its capacity is also great.
feedthebeast,3dx77e,Nentify,2,Mon Jul 20 09:17:01 2015 UTC,Where does the sulfuric acid come from? Can I use Railcraft Sulfur in some kind of electrolyzer and turn it into acid?
feedthebeast,3dx77e,Nentify,2,Mon Jul 20 10:50:22 2015 UTC,You make a sulphur block with gunpowder on top and burn it in water.  I've forgot that we have changed recipe to blaze powder. I will add sulphur ore dict soon.
feedthebeast,3dx77e,Nentify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:52:49 2015 UTC,Will you add an API for other mods to add electrolytes?
feedthebeast,3dx77e,Nephatrine,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:46 2015 UTC,We will think about it. The easiest path would be a config but we will think about an API.
feedthebeast,3dx77e,CreeperShift,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"Well shit, that was fast.   Those look awesome! Glad to see some multiblock storage finally appear. When I finally get around to putting a custom pack together ZettaIndustries just earned it's spot! Great stuff."

feedthebeast,3dx77e,nanakisan,2,Mon Jul 20 12:08:00 2015 UTC,"Not (yet) we are adding configs as we rewrite parts of ZI.  One sulfurous acid in battery gives 150MRF. Enderium Energy Cell has capacity of 100MRF. It was balanced so it is better than stacking those cells which are cheaper.  Either way, expect a config values for that in near future, also expect that in/out current will depend on surface of electrode touching electrolyte instead of its height."

Resonant Rise for example.  Even though it's from an EE2 clone, I think they're fine representations of balanced EMC values. I have no idea how EE3's EMC system operates, though.   Copper: 150 Tin: 150 Cobalt: 8192 Ardite: 8192   Meh, those were some I could find off the top of my head without launching it. Looking into Resonant Rise's ProjectE values would be a start."

If people care - they will check their page.  Also - geif download numbers!"
feedthebeast,3dzdr0,hilburn,3,Mon Jul 20 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"This is all turning out pretty well.  I never really expected FTB to do it themselves, I always assumed that it would all be in Curse somewhere eventually.  So kudos for putting in the effort.  Being notified of a mod in a pack is neat in theory, but I find it hard to justify the effort to implement it when it doesn't really seem to serve a lot of purpose other than self-satisfaction.  I don't actually need to know, as is probably the case for most modders.  New public packs just don't seem to go up on there often anyway, so it's not a big deal to just look every so often."
feedthebeast,3dzdr0,_FyberOptic_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:15 2015 UTC,"The definition of public packs is something I've wrestled with for quite a while. Currently, I use ""Listed Public Packs"" to mean packs new users see by default in the third party tab of the launcher. ""Unlisted Public Packs"" are ones behind a code, but that are for anyone to use. ""Private Packs"" are ones intended to be used only by a small group. See a more thorough definition here.  This would apply to all unlisted public packs, which are added to the launcher at a rate of nearly half a dozen a day.  Ideally, a notification system would eventually replace mod authors wanting people to notify them before using their mod in a pack. There are some popular mods that require this and it's annoying to us to have to deny packs that haven't notified. But yeah, it's a fair bit of effort for a relatively small group of people, and it would require them opting in somehow, which a lot of them wouldn't, mostly defeating the point."
feedthebeast,3dzdr0,GalvasPlay,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"Good work on that, looks really good.   Something I didn't understand, and I think would be cool, was to be some king of search mechanism for unlisted public packs too, instead of just code. An easy way for users to browse ""other packs"" instead of having to go the forum for that.  On that note, the Curse sync is only for listed packs right? Since the client already has a search mechanism that would be also cool.  The mention distribution policies being automated would be cool, but on the other hand I think a minimal amount of effort on the pack creator is good just to make sure he knows what he is doing and bring down the number of ""I put a bunch of mods together just because"" packs."
feedthebeast,3dzdr0,JackStargazer,3,Mon Jul 20 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's the idea, a page just like this, but all third party packs. You would click on one, get the usual info and the pack code. Pack authors can easily include a link back to a forum thread in their description if they want.  Curse sync will be for anyone at all, assuming you have permissions for your mods.  Problem with that is the people who want to redistribute infinity with a dozen added mods or something. They just want to play with their friends, so they couldn't care less about whether it's balanced or has a theme, but we have to deny it because one of the mods they added has an author with that mentality. Not every pack has to be perfect."

I'm in this boat myself. What are the options for a person in this situation? I've basically just been rehosting a rar file with the extra mods and instructing people to download it and overwrite the infinity folder, but that prevents a lot of them from getting on normal infinity servers because it replaces the basic infinity files. Is there a method for private packs with <10 users to set up a launcher based solution in the works?   I know ATL has sharecodes and Technic lets you upload private packs, is there something similar planned for FTB?"
feedthebeast,3dzdr0,jbranscum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"There is and has been for two and a half years. I intentionally don't advertise much.  Similar to ATL, FTB requires you to get permissions from mod authors where applicable, though most mods don't mind. My gripe above was with the mod authors that do care, and only give permission to packs they think are interesting enough, preventing people like you, who just want to play random mods, from doing something like this."

Opt-in would be ideal so that unused/forgotten/abandoned packs and those that intentionally do not want their packs listed would be left out of the list.  Notifications: Notified of what?  I use the reddit heavily, if someone needed to contact me, I would appreciate them contacting me through reddit or my FTB forum account.  I would dislike another point of contact to maintain.

To install as shown in the video, set up your liquid storage room, run your wiring to the computer, and type:  pastebin get DgbjDGuA install install   Then follow the instructions on-screen - edit your config files, and reboot the computer by entering  reboot     This is an early ""beta"" version. Version 1.0 will include liquid monitoring, and keep your tanks full (optional features that will be easy to add).  Questions? Comments? Suggestions? Let me know! And, while I'm not really a YouTuber, I will be posting another video whenever there's an update, so do subscribe if you want to be notified.    Edit: Some basic info about the config file, in case anyone's confused. If you would like to reference it while reading this, the actual, default config file (the one that's installed alongside Smeltery++) is here.  Editing the config file  To edit the config file, simply type  edit smeltery++/smeltery++.cfg   This will open the file in ComputerCraft's built-in editor. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around. To save, press ctrl, select [Save], and hit enter. After that, you can exit in the same manner.  Settings you absolutely must change  I may refactor the config file to put these nearer to each other.   general/monitor_side - Which side of the computer is the monitor on? If you are familiar with ComputerCraft, you can substitute a network ID for the side, since this is just passed directly to peripheral.wrap(). The three settings under 'wiring' - Smeltery++ needs to know which side the bundled/colored wires are that drive your various devices. 'metal_storage_side' is the cable that triggers all your drains in the liquid storage room. 'tank_clear_side' is the cable that triggers the drain on your main tank, in the smeltery room. By default, since I assume most people will have fewer than 16 tanks in their storage room, they are the same side. The 'liquid' section (see below)   How liquids work  When Smeltery++ is loaded (by rebooting the computer), it checks the config file for every liquid in a preset list. This list is located at  edit smeltery++/liquids   and by default it contains anything that shows up when you search NEI for ""molten"" on the current version of DW20.  It will not search for any liquids that aren't in the list, so if you need to add a liquid that isn't supported by default, make sure you put it in the list as well as assigning it a color in the config file.  Please note that changes to the default liquids file are not tested as of this writing. They are a high priority, but I haven't gotten there yet. These instructions assume that that the feature works, but I honestly can't swear to it. Welcome to beta code released by a Lua novice.  Assigning colors in smeltery++.cfg is very straightforward. Simply type in the name of the liquid as it appears in the liquids file. If you are dramatically opposed to a fluid's default name, you can change it, as long as you change it in both files.  Type the colors exactly as they appear in this list. Leave out ""colors."" so that you're left with ""red"" and ""orange"", etc.  Example settings other than the defaults might be:  [liquids] glass = lightGray silver = gray aluminum = white cobalt = blue ardite = pink enderium = green   Once you've set that up, you're done! Save the file, reboot the computer, and enjoy your smeltery room."

Every now and then I go empty excesses into my Terrasteel pick..."
feedthebeast,3e04ye,Garos_the_seagull,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:37 2015 UTC,"And yet, a single endoflame replaces 60 dayblooms for mana gained per time. That's kind of the point of the change."

I just need a hopper, a pressure plate, a couple of redstone and a open crate. Fill it with charcoal and its pretty passive. One endoflame will take days to burn all the charcoal :)    Passive flowers are supposed to be used to generate a little of mana at the beginning, so you can make mana petals to craft more advanced mana flowers. They are not supposed to be spammed over multiple chunks... Its like using 100 stirling engines from BC because they are cheap and they can produce all the energy you need instead of making an hot boiler....."
feedthebeast,3e04ye,howdoiusethissite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:55 2015 UTC,"A much better way of dealing with that issue, in my opinion, would be swapping endoflames with dayblooms in the mod's progression. This way, you'd be able to start out by burning fuel instead of spamming flowers (that die eventually with default configs) and waiting, which is one of the reasons people get turned off by Botania.  Forcing the option that makes flowers just die by default simply feels off for me, especially given the extra amount of effort you need to put into making floating flowers. At least make them require some maintenance every so often or something instead of straight murdering the poor things."

A flux capacitor is imho the better upgrade for your hammer.   As for compressed cobble production, I don't really consider it part of a cobbleworks because it's mainly dependent on a speedy cobblegen. For a well thought out cobbleworks, you don't need as much cobble, so I usually separate the two.   Matter balls I simply forgot about. I'll include them in an updated version.

feedthebeast,3dvsgu,YoraeRyong,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:18 2015 UTC,"I did the math and even tried it out, but at least in my pack that doesn't seem true.

Even with dark steel (which i don't use because they're not renewable), 32 clay blocks netted me ~100 silicon and ~100 clay. 4 stacks sand, on the other hand, got me nearly 6 stacks silicon.

feedthebeast,3dvsgu,gchpaco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"All true unless you dont have IC2. If you dont have IC2, which happens a lot nowdays, silicon is better obtained from Sag mill with clay instead of sand and since its a generic cobbleworks, you should take that in account!"

feedthebeast,3dvsgu,Lyqu1d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:49:52 2015 UTC,"I am just pointing out that with EnderIO, you can also obtain silicon from clay and that it is more efficient to get silicon from clay then from sand when using ender io only since the silicon yield is higher and you still get a lot of clay from it allowing to reuse the clay multiple times to produce silicon(which makes the yield become even higher).    And that information is omitted in your flowchart. Players that have no clue about mods and use your flowchart to learn will assume that without IC2, the only way to obtain silicon is sag milling the sand which is not true and it is not the most efficient way, specially at early game if you dont have a full cobbleworks factory implemented and are digging for sand to make silicon when you could dig for clay and get way more silicon."

Which means you can use the phyto-gro to grow wheat in an Insolator, craft the wheat into a bale, smelt the bale, pulverise the charcoal, and make more phyto-gro, in a stable loop. It should also provide surplus wheat and seeds, meaning you have a cobble-gen based bread/toast/toast-sandwhich source, and can feed the seeds in to make biomass for the dirt production.  Edit: and by not having the charcoal-pulveriser not attached to the storage system, it would only keep a limited amount for phyto-gro production, and you could route excess charcoal to storage, thereby adding charcoal to your outputs too."

If you did everything that was previously commented before, (enough channels, power, security terminal, latest stable version), then the cause of your problem is due to faulty design at somewhere in your ae system that causes a item transfer loop and end up freezing the entire system.   A friend and I was playing a server together, my friend wasn't very good at technical design, what he did was he had a hyper transfer-node pulling lava buckets from a enderchest while having a export bus on the same enderchest with acceleration upgrade. That enderchest he used was also the chest in where we import our quarries with acceleration upgrades. This resulted in a loop where the system is trying to pulling and import from the same chest. The loop gave me the exact same problem you described. The problem took me a while to figure out, once I found what my friend did with the enderchest, I destroyed it and my import/export pipes immediately worked again.   You also very likely have a design problem somewhere in your ae system that is causing a similar loop, think back for a while and try to remember if you or your friends built anything that mightve fried the system due to poor design."

feedthebeast,3dzadx,Zandorum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:00 2015 UTC,I feel like some dimensions cost way too cheap versus the manually made ones and even the manually made ones are too cheap.
feedthebeast,3dzadx,McJty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:38 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know. That depends on the presence of other OP mods (i.e. Big Reactors). In my own plays where I don't use Big Reactors, powering an RFTools dimension becomes a lot more of a challenge.  Also once you are at the point when you can make that kind of power using Big Reactors to power such a dimension. Do you then still need what the dimension can offer? Is it still OP at that point in the game? You're likely to get plenty of resources anyway then."
feedthebeast,3dzadx,Zandorum,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"I refuse to use Big Reactors, too easy; I was thinking of doing a Rebalance personal mod for myself adding an IC2 Esk Heat system and possibly making all of the recipes much much harder. But back on topic my power gen stems from a Tokamak Reactor from Reactorcraft but normally I use either Railcraft Steam Engines, Rotarycraft Rotational Dynamos or Forestry Biofuel; I don't use Thermal Expansion due to my opinions on its balance but that's a whole different thing (I also have Extra Utilities but I've disabled the Generators because just no).  Edit: I also do a few Exotic Powergens but its more for completionism like Botania's RF production thingy (cant think of its name).  Edit 2: I also use Forestry Electrical Engines too but that's if I went into IC2 since you can get a 140/rft Engine out of that."
feedthebeast,3dzadx,Zandorum,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't play with Mystcraft because it was too good, I don't play with your Dimensions because they are too cheap. If there were 3 more 0's I might try it out because honestly, Some of those Dimensions I'd pay Millions of RF/t for but they just dont cost anywhere near that much and it being so much cheaper devalues everything in that Dimension but because of how many things can be in them it generally Devalues every block in the game."

Add the minetweaker mod and then in /minecraft/scripts/ create a file such as 'myscripts.tz' and then paste into that file      MiningLaser.addOre(<BigReactors:BRIngot>.weight(10)); The weight is the frequency the drills will produce. 7 is the default for diamond so 10 should be good but you can always adjust it.

As you can tell, I'm no expert on coding, and I'm sure you know what you're talking about much more than me, but the ""BRIngot"" part seems a bit fishy in the code.

feedthebeast,3dv0nm,Drullkus,2,Sun Jul 19 20:39:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! I thought it looked like Decocraft but for some reason I couldn't find the skeletons in my NEI.
feedthebeast,3dv0nm,Dragonfire177,3,Sun Jul 19 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"How long did this take?  Looks great!  The TNT on the shelf gave me a chuckle.. yeah, lets carry this around"
feedthebeast,3dv0nm,MystifiedMustard,3,Sun Jul 19 20:23:18 2015 UTC,Nice.. Very nice... Except...  Where's the Big Industrial Fans? D:
feedthebeast,3dv0nm,MystifiedMustard,4,Mon Jul 20 01:43:31 2015 UTC,I have large fans in the tree room. Forgot to take a picture. They're on the ceiling.

feedthebeast,3dv0nm,Sm314,4,Sun Jul 19 19:29:34 2015 UTC,For some reason my FTB isn't opening but I want to say the suits are from IC2.
feedthebeast,3dv0nm,supersayanftw,2,Sun Jul 19 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"Helmet is from Mekanism, not sure about the suit though. Looks like Mekanism as well."
feedthebeast,3dv0nm,CogChoir,3,Sun Jul 19 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"No, those helmets are 100% mekanism. OP never said he was running an unaltered infinity instance, he could very well have Mekanism installed."

feedthebeast,3dytjf,6210classick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:41 2015 UTC,don't dig manually it's painful instead setup an Ender Quarry it will skip bedrock and will only mines ores

feedthebeast,3dy99h,frogfigther,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:36 2015 UTC,Ok so I know I'm not going crazy here.  I took a trip into the Twilight Forrest the other day and got about 20 blank info fragments.  I put these into a chest for the future when they would unlock for me.  during my testing yesterday trying to figure out my above problem I know I took them out of the chest and looked at them and they were all still blank.  I upgraded all of Reika's mods just yesterday but I guess I didn't look at the info fragments again for I just took them out of the chest and low and behold they are all no longer blank.  It must have been a bug is all I can figure because its working now.  Thanks for the help all!
feedthebeast,3dy99h,Slikrick98,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:34 2015 UTC,Glad you figured it out :)
feedthebeast,3dzn2p,toxiboxi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:49 2015 UTC,Is there a way to change my spawn/character location without logging in? How do i fix this?     Yes there is a way to fix this issue. But 1st we need to identify what it was you fell into. Is there anyway at all you can get into the server and quickly snapshot before you crash?    Otherwise one solution is simply editing your player.dat file

feedthebeast,3dzm83,dmfiel,2,Mon Jul 20 20:37:58 2015 UTC,Maybe try a mod-based itemsink module?
feedthebeast,3dzm83,Belathus,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:45 2015 UTC,That might work! Let me go try  EDIT: IT Worked! Thanks for helping me solve this basic issue.  Take this reddit Silver.

feedthebeast,3dypb9,mokniker,5,Mon Jul 20 17:07:32 2015 UTC,And if you didn't find a Division Sigil from dungeons you can just make a TiC Cleaver and farm Wither Skeleton Skulls and kill the Wither who will always drop one.

feedthebeast,3dypb9,SirJohnSmith,13,Mon Jul 20 17:20:35 2015 UTC,If you were to cheat it'd be much faster to give yourself the pearls directly.
feedthebeast,3dypb9,the_ravenous_red,4,Mon Jul 20 17:34:06 2015 UTC,"I found it was easy enough to create an EnderIO enderman spawner and use that method, as all you need are the required machines and a power source.  You can make the sword as well from that mod and you will get 2 Enderman every ~30 seconds while the spawner is active and assuming your sword is charged they always drop a pearl."
feedthebeast,3dypb9,Ruuubi,3,Mon Jul 20 17:28:00 2015 UTC,The easy way:  Catch some endermen with a Safari net and throw them into a Smeltery from Tinkers. Each Enderman is worth 4 Enderpearls (you need liquid inside to damage them).
feedthebeast,3dypb9,Ajama11,3,Mon Jul 20 18:52:50 2015 UTC,"You can also put a floating version of a Vinculotus from Botania above the smeltery. Whenever Endermen try to teleport out of the smeltery (or near the smeltery), they'll be forced to teleport to the flower. Because the flower is floating above the smeltery, they'll fall back in, and they can't grab the dirt/grass that the flower is on (because floating)."
feedthebeast,3dypb9,6210classick,2,Mon Jul 20 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"what mods do you have installed ?   look for Endermini look for 3 magical chalk in village chest and desert & jungle temples then travel to the Runic dimensions + you customize the loot   the best way to get ender pearls the vanilla way in my experience is to find a desert then build at least 6 high bock tower then look for enderman , also having a sword with looting will increase the chance of dropping one   kill them with EIO dark steel steel because it will prevent the from teleporting and will always guarantee at least 1 Ender Pearl to drop )"
feedthebeast,3dypb9,FowD9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:17 2015 UTC,why desert? i'm guessing because the sand will fill up the potential caves underground?
feedthebeast,3dypb9,6210classick,4,Mon Jul 20 18:27:38 2015 UTC,nope it's a wide open area and mobs can spawn Perry much everywhere plus sometimes I don't like to hear rain drop sound
feedthebeast,3dypb9,Ajama11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"If it's raining and you're not in a desert, the Endermen will teleport away because of the water. If you're in a desert, then the Endermen won't teleport (and the Endermen in the adjacent non-desert biomes can also teleport to the desert with less health)."
feedthebeast,3dypb9,Brimshae,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:25 2015 UTC,"If it's raining and you're not in a desert, the Endermen will teleport away because of the water.   .... which is hilarious if you're playing a skyblock map and haven't expanded very much."
feedthebeast,3dypb9,Matt_Sheridan,2,Tue Jul 21 07:09:27 2015 UTC,"Once you're at the point where you're making tesseracts, it's probably worth your time to actually make an MFR mob farm. Just spawn and grind infinite endermen forever! Or until you decide you want ghast tears, charms or keeping, wither skulls, etc. instead. It takes a little setup, but it's totally worth it."
feedthebeast,3dypb9,p75369,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"If you've already got your first lily, invest your first ender pearls in making Ender Core(s) to plant the lily on.  Use tick accelerators (watering can, agricraft sprinkler, lamp of growth, ritual of the green grove, etc) (NOT bonemeal nor things which apply the bonemeal effect), to accelerate the growth of the lily and use your choice of automatic farming method, you'll be rolling in lillies before you know it.  Alternative, enderman farm."
feedthebeast,3dypb9,HoneySnuSnu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:34 2015 UTC,All the various pages say that Ender Cores grow lilies the fastest but after planting six on End Stone and six on Ender Cores the End Stone ones were producing more. The growth mechanics for Ender Lillies is pretty weird and I can't explain my result but it's been that way consistently. I don't know why.

feedthebeast,3dypb9,Droggelbecher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"You said Ender lilies are hard to come by, but trust me, it's the most sensible way. Of course you need some luck to find a few but even 4-5 can help a lot in the early game. Especially if you make your first Ender Pearls into End Stone to speed up their growing process a lot and set up an auto-farm (golems) for them so you don't need to plant them and take the damage.  Or do the extreme version and use Ender Cores which is even faster, but due to it taking Enchanted Books I never bothered with it."

feedthebeast,3dypb9,animeguru,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"""Better"" is subjective as the power requirements can be pretty steep and mob essence isn't exactly hard to come by.  It depends on preference and what works best for the user."
