Winnipeg,3e4loi,Vilyamar,3,Tue Jul 21 22:29:26 2015 UTC,I do things on my bike Id never do on a car. But really I dont feel like most would be different than me. I mean if Im on the road I follow signs / lights etc. But If Im stuck in a mile long stretch of gridlock traffic and there's a perfectly good sidewalk right there Im sure as shit not going to sit in traffic bored out of my mind. And Id bet money most people would do the same thing.   I guess Im wrong for doing little things like that. I dont think Im nearly so bad as the idiots that fly through stop signs without even looking though. And when I DO use the sidewalks pedestrians come first. I always slow down significantly and yield for them. Its their domain not mine.
Winnipeg,3e4loi,Randformula,2,Tue Jul 21 23:14:42 2015 UTC,"I find this impossible to believe,  except that I think that they are counting all possible infractions.  Since bikes wouldn't be able to go over the speed limit nearly as often as a vehicle, there will obviously be many more cars breaking speed limits than bikes.  It's still difficult to believe. I never see cars hop up on the sidewalk or blow through multiple stop signs and red lights during downtown rush hour.  If I'm at a red and I see 5 cyclists, guaranteed at least 4 of them won't be there when the light changes to green."
Winnipeg,3e4loi,eightinchtip,2,Tue Jul 21 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"Out and out running of red lights by bike people seems pretty rare to me these days. Dunno why. Going against the ""don't walk"" signal is pretty common in places where bikes are supposed to use the pedestian crossing at a intersection. I don't really entirely understand what bikes are supposed to do there though. There are a random mix of stop and dismount signs at those places.  Everyone blows through stop signs here in Winnipeg. It is pretty much a tradition..."
Winnipeg,3e4loi,upofadown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:52:21 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  At best I'd say that cyclists mostly treat red lights as stop signs.  If they stop at all it's just until traffic has cleared enough, and then they are on their way."

If you're lucky they will have a regular schedule in the area (class, job, workout, etc).    Any chance that you opted for the 'new car' insurance? That will take some of the sting out of the claim anyway."

It covered a lot of good material (CCNA, MCSE, A+, fundamental electronics/electricity theory, Linux) and taught a lot of great skills (technical communication, soldering).

Winnipeg,3e2pd7,klevenisms204,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"Or you can try and fight it yourself and likely pay just 2/3 the cost of the ticket. If it's your first ticket, you will likely get it reduced without help."

He was well within 1 m of the edge of the roadway (the cones).  E: The speed limit here is 30 km/h because of construction. Not only was the bus driving dangerously but also speeding in a construction zone upon exiting the intersection.

Winnipeg,3dyhlx,noexistence,8,Tue Jul 21 03:50:50 2015 UTC,There was a defined lane here. There was only one lane. The person was in the lane.  If there were multiple lanes then the slower traffic would of been expected to to move to the right lane. You are obviously not required to allow someone to pass you inside a lane. Cyclists sometimes allow such a pass out of courtesy where it is safe to do so. Normally passing a vehicle requires the use of at least part of another lane. The requirement to keep right is intended to make such a pass safer.

Winnipeg,3dyhlx,pegpegpegpeg,5,Mon Jul 20 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"Here's the formula on how much time you lose to a cyclist going half speed   Time = Distance ÷ Speed  So say the construction is 1km in length (and that's a lot of construction...about 12 city blocks!).  Time = 1KM ÷ 60kmph (the maximum speed in a construction zone) Time = 1 minute  now stuck behind a cyclist doing half that speed  Time = 1KM ÷ 30kmph (the maximum speed in a construction zone) Time = 2 minute  But I hear you, cyclists are soooo slow.  Say the average cruiser cyclist for some reason decides to go through construction during rush hour (unlikely but still).  Time = 1KM ÷ 15kmph (the maximum speed in a construction zone) Time = 4 minute  So you're calling people retarded over 2-4 minutes of lost time over an unlikely 12 city blocks of construction?  This math is actually why speeding generally never makes sense unless it's over LOOOOONNG distances. But then you dramatically increase your chances of getting caught so realistically you're better off just leaving earlier."

My point is that new technology will effect the way people in all jurisdictions create, move and consume power. This will impact MB Hydros ability to resell power in the future.   Given that they have asked for a 4% hike per year for the next 20 years from ratepayers to pay for these projects it is extremely prudent to be absolutely sure we can resell the power at a profit before we pour billions into creating new supply. I realize some new generation will be needed for the MB market but not enough to come close to justifying the expense or scope of what MB Hydro and this govt have on the table.   The plans on the table would double our provincial debt to pay for them when we have zero assurances we can recoup the cost let alone profit."
Winnipeg,3e0ops,whammypeg,0,Tue Jul 21 16:25:29 2015 UTC,You are right that the places we export to will be changing the way they produce energy. Majority of their power comes from coal and with Obama restricting the amount of coal for energy by 30% by 2030. They will likely invest in Wind and Solar to replace it. The problem with Wind and Solar is the mass storage of the excess electricity to use on non-sunny and windy days. This is why having Hydro is a benefit to them plus use. If you look at how Norway uses a pumped storage system as a “Battery” for the rest of Europe’s Wind generation. We have the advantage that we don’t have to pump the water at a loss of electricity we just don’t flow as much until it’s needed.  Here is a video of Norway’s hydro’s energy storage system. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSUPpwtqhQ .
Winnipeg,3e0ops,tetrock84,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"We have the advantage that we don’t have to pump the water at a loss of electricity we just don’t flow as much until it’s needed.   What? No. That's not an advantage. If you have a fixed investment in something, you need to be able to get as much out of it as possible. If you are shutting it down - presumably to stop creating so much cheap off-peak power - then the asset is sitting idle. It's not being productive. You're shutting down your asset to stop the investment from continuing to create losses. That's all you need to know right there, isn't it? It's still aging, it's debt still requires servicing, and it still requires significant maintenance. Where in all of that expense is the advantage to shutting down the asset?"
Winnipeg,3e0ops,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"You know they have to pay to store the electricity right. This is why we have massive contracts to export to the states. We are only like 10% to 20% of their electricity intake. They would have no way of storing there electricity if they didn't which is the problem with wind and solar. Dams also last 100 years plus like Pointe du Bois Hydroelectric Dam which was built in 1911 and its still running. Well with in the life time of the dam we would need the full usage of the dam and likely we will be building a lot more by then too. Wind turbines last only 20 years on average while producing less kwh in their life span. Solar needs massive batteries to store electricity. Manitoba is the perfect location for in-stream type generators.  Now for your argument that we don't need to build more hydro for export. So obviously a growing Province is going need and use more energy than it did the previous year. Right now we export 31.3% of the electricity we produce. https://www.hydro.mb.ca/corporate/electricity_exports.shtml Let’s say to maintain the lowest rates we need a formula of 33% percent exports. The more the province grows the demand goes up and the amount we import declines below 33%. We have to build new generation to maintain that proven key formula for low rates. Let’s say we need 100 mwh (example number only)  So we have 3 options   Option 1: Build a small dam that will cost 100 mil and produce 100 mwh (example numbers only) that will get us back to that 33%. But where does that 100 mil come from. To pay for the new dam our rates go up dramatically until dam is paid for because it is an added cost to build. This is only a temporary fix until we fall back below that 33% mark our rates will start to climb again until we catch up which is a never ending game of catch up.   Option 2: Build a 400 mil which produces 400 mwh (example number only). We only need 100 mwh for now so any extra mwh we can sell until we need them. This added revenue goes to pay for the dam.   Option 3: Do what Pallister and the PC say, don't build the new dams and stop exporting. So our key formula for lowest rates erodes and erodes until we pay for 100% of the generation. Then the cost maintain current generation and to build new generation is only on Manitobans to pay. Than the only other options are start importing electricity for a cost, or make Hydro take loans it can't pay to bankrupt it. Making his case for privatization more appealing to the public.  So what I'm saying is Option 2 is the best solution for getting the needed generation we need at the lowest cost."
Winnipeg,3e0ops,tetrock84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"make Hydro take loans it can't pay to bankrupt it   I'm happy to see after all of your very rudimentary and dirty understanding of what you're reading that you understand exactly how hydro is currently managing itself.  Your model only works where the costs of power are constantly increasing. Except they're not. And they haven't. So that's a hell of a limb you're out on. What you are trying to suggest is that Manitobans are going to subsidize power to the northern US as some sort of long-play towards having the US ultimately subsidize our power and there's no basis for reality in that whatsoever. None. Hydro's capacity can easily handle our demands as it is. It doesn't need to sell power to the US to make ours cheaper. The market price for a KwH to the states is currently less than the marginal cost to produce from Wuskwatim (~4.18cents). Please explain how selling power to the US at less than what we pay and less than its cost to produce is going to somehow leave us better off in the future as we get ready to put even more supply online.  Listen, Greg. I get it. An election is coming up and you're looking pretty bad right now. But there is nothing that can defend Hydro's infrastructure explosion. Nothing. Stop trying to pretend like all the experts have it completely wrong. And I'm not even talking about solar or wind. Your position becomes even more indefensible when you start talking about the falling costs of solar panels."
Winnipeg,3e0ops,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"And what happens when households can suddenly and reliably create, store and use their own energy? What happens to demand then? This is coming and it doesn't matter how deep people have their heads in the sand about it. It makes none of your options palatable.   Hydro has acknowledged this reality themselves as have other jurisdictions. In fact, California has a written consideration to ban going ""off grid"" in the near future because they fear there won't be enough rate payers to maintain the grid when adoption of new technology making it easy to do so becomes cheap enough to go mainstream. Other options include taxing ""off gridders"" instead of an outright ban. They're basically saying that this new tech will be so disruptive to electric markets that they are seriously considering banning it outright or making people pay for the pleasure of being self reliant.  There are many companies doing incredible research but if you want a place to start researching all you need do is lookup Tesla Power. Elon Musk's company has the most hype but it doesn't mean what he's offering won't change things. It will. Other companies like Google are also pouring huge capital into this as well, as are hundreds of other large and small companies."
Winnipeg,3e0ops,whammypeg,0,Tue Jul 21 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"The issue is that building massive amounts of unnecessary infrastructure to service demand that barely exists is exactly why Manitobans are going to lose those cheap rates. We will be busy subsidizing the oversupplied power to the northern US all because we have so much of it. Somebody has to pay the bondholders. If it isn't the end user - which it won't be because these projects ensure discounted power - it'll be the Manitoba tax payer. You really need to understand how supply and demand curves work. You can't build infinite capacity, expect rates to stay the same, and pretend like there was no capital investment required. It doesn't work that way.  Ed Schreyer is writing op-eds in the paper about the long-term mismanagement of Hydro. Ed Schreyer! The former Head of the Public Utilities Board (who's also a Chartered Accountant) has been writing about the long-term mismanagement of Hydro. But that won't stop the ideologues. The real corporate governance and management experts are right here in this sub."
Winnipeg,3e0ops,WpgTroglodyte,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:51 2015 UTC,LOL worried about rates going up...Please...  Try living in Ontario.  Your hydro bill would be easily 4x as much for the exact same sized home.  I think hydro is amazingly cheap out here and there is more than enough room to support projects like these.  They'll create a ton of jobs and investing in future infrastructure that you're going to need anyways is a good thing.  Just don't fuck it up like the morons running Ontario.  McGuinty and Wynne have fucked up that province so much it's scary.
Winnipeg,3e0ops,bigpipes84,3,Tue Jul 21 12:44:31 2015 UTC,No kidding. Our power is still cheap if they raised the price by %20. People forget 3.95% of 7.3 cents is nothing.   It'll be way more expensive to delay these projects and have to build them 20 years from now.
Winnipeg,3e0ops,lamothek,0,Tue Jul 21 13:24:51 2015 UTC,Rate increases compound. You're using the wrong formula. You need to use an exponent. Get your math straight then make your comment.
Winnipeg,3e0ops,WpgTroglodyte,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:40 2015 UTC,Your missing the point. With compounding increases over the next few years we still pay a tiny amount relative most do North America.
Winnipeg,3e0ops,lamothek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know how to calculate compounding rates. That's the problem with your argument. It's also not 5 years, it's 10. And then another 10.  Why don't you show me what 4% compounded over 20 years on $.073 looks like."
Winnipeg,3e0ops,WpgTroglodyte,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:38 2015 UTC,16 cents. Which is a lot relative to what we pay now but we need to remember our power is reliable and hydro has high safety standards. That isn't cheap.   Personally in okay with rates going up. We're going to need Bi-Pole 3 as our usage goes up at the rate it is.
Winnipeg,3e0ops,lamothek,0,Tue Jul 21 19:07:50 2015 UTC,Ding Ding!  Bi-Pole isn't even for us. It's for exporting power to the states where demand levels haven't moved in ten years.  Hydro was creating enough power (and reliably and safely so) at the rates before it started trying to be a multi-national energy conglomerate. We're now subsidizing power to the northern US.
Winnipeg,3e0ops,WpgTroglodyte,4,Tue Jul 21 19:19:50 2015 UTC,False. The way Manitoba's power usage has increased we have almost maxed out what Bi-Pole 1&2 are capable of handling. We will need it to serve Manitoba and power exports. If people actually read the reports and looked into the whole picture they would see why hydro wants what it's asking for.
Winnipeg,3e0ops,lamothek,2,Tue Jul 21 19:29:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no, I mean, the public utilities board has no idea what they're talking about. And exponential rate increases over 20 years are always what happens when assets are able to pay for themselves.  You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about."

Winnipeg,3e0ops,JoshEco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"It's not five years. That number is incorrect. Nobody would be quibbling with a 5 year term. Hydro is seeking increases over two ten year terms. Over 20 years at a rate of 4% compounding annually that rate increase is 119%.  By the way, you guys want to borrow some money?  EDIT: I do see where you're getting this, but it's not the investment horizon. The utility submitted for a two year rate increase the last time around and is now trying to submit for a three year. They were rejected in that endeavour, but that would have given hydro an effective compounding 5 year rate increase. This has little to do with their need to continue increasing rates past that horizon."

If you graduate with a sociology degree and you grew up at King and Dufferin, you don't have a network that is going to provide you a soft landing in the job market. Because absent a graduate degree in that discipline - hell, even with one! - you have very few prospects. You are going to count on your social capital - your network, your ability to converse, your soft social skills - to become employed in a field very likely to be unrelated to sociology. That's just for example.  On the other hand, if you're a plumber's apprentice and you show yourself capable of doing the work, you'll find a job plumbing somewhere. And that's a lifelong skill.  Nobody is disparaging a liberal arts education. I'm making the point that they're only useful to certain people.

Personally I would push for hard sciences. If you have Aboriginal programmers, engineers, technicians and medical students you don't need such a tailored social network, you need commitment to studies, good grades and high hopes and interest in academics.

But there has to be a culture of education behind you before you can understand what's required to succeed in those professions. There's simply no way - or no way that's sustainable across the demographic - that just sees people from broken families succeeding in those sorts of technical fields without significant familial mentorship and assistance. It's hard enough for white middle class families to compete with the privilege that being upper-middle class affords students.  Trades are an easy entry point into the market. And realistically, all jobs have their drug and alcohol cultures to a degree. But at least they have a skill, a ticket, and the ability to earn a decent living. That decent living part is really the key. People with commitments and structure tend to at least grow out of childish boozing and the like. And they can at least get on a path towards economic security.   If you put them in competition for the high end technical sciences, you're going to have to lower the bar to end up with anybody even remote qualified for admission. From there, the affirmative action literature paints a pretty dire picture of those who can't compete in the educational environment and for whom things get worse in the work world."

I searched for the Ralph Lauren frames I had tried in store, found the measurements online, and then was able to search Clearly Contacts for any glasses with similar measurements and found pretty much exactly the same glasses under a different brand name for way cheaper.  You're allowed to try them free for 30 days with your prescription and return if you really don't like them, and I seriously saved hundreds of dollars and they gave me a document for Blue Cross to file my claim. I even got a discount for being a Blue Cross customer.   I totally sound like a walking billboard for Clearly Contacts right now, but I seriously had an extremely good experience every step of the way and I got a great deal instead of forking over at the mall."

Winnipeg,3dwpin,icky40,4,Mon Jul 20 04:06:04 2015 UTC,I'm interested. Would love to give 5e a try. I played lots of 4e and dungeon world some years ago but it's been a while. Would love to get back into it.

Winnipeg,3dwpin,MrAdamLerner,6,Mon Jul 20 04:41:47 2015 UTC,It's not that hard to get the hang of and its pretty simple in the first few levels. More importantly this game is kind of the shit if you can get into it. If you are interested but aren't sure yet I can PM you about it once a couple people are on board and you've had time to think about it. There are free dice rolling apps too so there isn't really any monetary investment

This upstanding citizen  might not be 100% legitimate. I am shocked...  You mean to tell me the guy who runs the rebranded river city choppers clothing store is not legit.  A member of a record label which was created to skirt anti gang laws is not worth investigating....  I would be pissed off if police were not investigating this guy.     Https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OW78Y3Y6-2o  Heres his fellow labelmate showing the highly sophisticated process of extracting cannibus oil.  Im sure none of this was ever sold through the store....  Nothing to see here folks. This is clearly just the police targeting innocent business owners with a hate for marijuana.  Im sure the gang related shooting of a dealer just blocks away before this business opened up was entirely unrelated....  One of the neighborhoods most prolific drug dealers in the same building as a storefront trafficking narcotics is 100% coincidence....

Id just hate to see the proceeds of this medical marijuana going to the pockets of people who also peddle crack and other hard drugs.  I hope it is just 100% coincidence. Sadly this would not be the first storefront in this area to blatantly sell narcotics out of. The HA in winnipeg sold out of the pool hall old joes a decade earlier. That was at the same time river city choppers was open on main st.  Now you have hood hopprz in the same location as the previous river city chopperz and the owner of said store also has a business in the same building as this storefront selling marijuana.

Winnipeg,3dwsjk,dankydankster,0,Mon Jul 20 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"The bigger picture is how the Conservatives are using this as a wedge issue in the election.  The image that they want for people who support the use of medical marijuana is that of burnt-out freaks looking to use the activist Supreme Court ruling on medical marijuana as an excuse to get high.  ""Vote for Stephen Harper because he's tough on crime, tough on drugs - you don't want your children getting marijuana - DO YOU?!""  That message plays in the ridings they need to win and this jackass has become their poster-child.  FFS there is a protocol in place for medical marijuana.  Follow it at least until the campaign is over and then be prepared to pressure the fuck out of the NDP to legalize it.  Fuck it, pressure them to commit to full legalization now and then be prepared to hold them to account.  Anyway.  Look.  He might mean well, as well as yourself.  But the political reality is that he is bolstering the argument against both mdical marijuana and legalization.  Politics is not based on rational though, it's about manipulating and appealing to people's emotions.  That. is the bigger picture."
Winnipeg,3dwsjk,DerrickD26,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:57 2015 UTC,This shit only plays in ridings the Conservatives already have locked up tight. Cannabis reform has serious political support that is not jeopardized by a man disobeying laws that anyone who actually examines can see were cooked up to be unreasonable. Forum research recently did a poll and found that even 1/3 of Conservatives would switch their vote to support a party or politician that supports legalizing marijuana.

Determining the effect of the micro-targetting by the Conservatives using the legalization or use of Marijuana will be based on more than seat count.  The first question, which will be easy to assess is, ""did they use the issue""  The second, ""was the use of marijuana as a wedge effective.""

Given his actions I was right and am very happy to have never set foot in his place.  The last thing I need, or want in my life is a hassle with the police or courts.  I went out of my way to get carded legally and it did cost a pretty penny.  Unfortunately there are a great many people who don't have the resources I do.  Those folks may be served by a shop such as his, but he has to do it right or the Police are left with little choice other than enforce the law.  It's unfortunate, but the issue, right now is getting caught up in the Federal Election.  Medical Marijuana and Legalization are wedge issues that the Conservatives are planning on using as part of their attempt to hold on to power.

Winnipeg,3dwsjk,DerrickD26,0,Mon Jul 20 21:47:37 2015 UTC,"No it really doesn't matter. You're the one feeding the negative stereotypes by constantly badmouthing this guy's appearance. Stop talking about the anti-marijuana folks, the tide has turned and the majority support legalization. The conservatives won't be able to effectively use cannabis as a wedge issue in the election because even a lot of their supporters are in favor or relaxation of the laws. Not to mention that if you actually look into their policies they are clearly nonsense without logic. You're the only one feeding them by badmouthing a system that seems to work pretty good for patients in BC. If what people thought actually mattered then cannabis would be legal right now. Police have plenty of choice of what laws they enforce and how they choose to enforce them as we don't live in a world of infinite resources.   Didn't you learn not to judge a book by it's cover?"
Winnipeg,3dwsjk,weendogtownandzboys,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"Openly selling marijuana in violation of the law and then amping it up by trying to get people to smoke dope in front of the cops.......those are actions.  If his shop was ore clinical, his appearance more professional, his attempts at licensing more thorough, he would have much, much more support.  Including mine.  But going off half-cocked and coming across like a character from an underground comic alienates the majority of the population.  The Conservatives will use it in their campaign, and they will use it effectively on the doorsteps where their voter id campaign identifies it as an issue.  It won't be the ballot question for most Canadians, but it will be for many.

Winnipeg,3dv5up,miigis,3,Mon Jul 20 01:13:47 2015 UTC,Also Russell Brewing is getting taken over. I hope the new majority share holders continue with the craft beer that Fort Gary has been doing. It would be a shame if they only thought of the bottom line and weren't willing to put money toward trying new stuff. http://www.vancouversun.com/touch/story.html?id=11169638
Winnipeg,3dv5up,tetrock84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"True. Although most of the shareholders are locals... FGB is local in every sense of the word, other than ownership."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,TheCaptainsDizzler,16,Tue Jul 21 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"Depends what you're looking for. Both Fort Garry and Half Pints do some really good small batches...stuff you only find at the HP brewery or the growler fill stations. And they have such a great variety in what they put out, so if one's not your style, wait a couple weeks and try a different one.   For example, I've got a really nice saskatoon wheat beer from FG in my fridge right now. I've had a nice double IPA from HP as well. There's honestly just too many to remember and list."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,zookeeperme,6,Sun Jul 19 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"Go to grape and grain on Osbourne and buy grains. Then mash them and boil with hops, add yeast. Bam, beer as local as it gets. Produced in your very own house!"
Winnipeg,3dv5up,Winterpeg,3,Mon Jul 20 03:50:00 2015 UTC,Already got that covered (plus growing my own hops).
Winnipeg,3dv5up,OwenFinnn,3,Mon Jul 20 04:03:24 2015 UTC,Agreed - the best local beer is the beer you make yourself.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,TheCaptainsDizzler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:02:50 2015 UTC,"True, although the process is a tad more involved than winterpeg makes it out to be..."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,OwenFinnn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Not really - homebrewing is not difficult. I liken it to making a really good homemade soup, just that it takes 2 months of waiting for it to be ready."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,TheCaptainsDizzler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"To make vinegar? Sure. To make a good Homebrew requires good equipment, proper cleaning practices, temperature control and monitoring and many, many other things which make a beer ""good""."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,OwenFinnn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:57 2015 UTC,"Hardly that complex - temperature control is minimal (a basement closet is just fine for almost all types of homebrew), monitoring is a 2 minute every couple of days thing, cleaning practices are a cinch and ""good equipment"" can be had for under $200 all in, less if you buy used.  Seriously - it's so easy to get great tasting beer."

Winnipeg,3dv5up,kent_eh,6,Mon Jul 20 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Big Hops, so many of the ""special"" beers don't do much for me.  I do however really like Fort Gary Dark and Half Pints' Stir Stick Stout.  I just wish I could find Stir Stick by itself in a case. The only way I have seen it lately is in the taster packs (which isn't too much of a hardship, but the IPA is always the last in the box.)"
Winnipeg,3dv5up,pulltheanimal,2,Sun Jul 19 22:47:14 2015 UTC,Unfortunately for you they announced on their website that Stir Stick is going to be phased out of the tasters (in favour of more seasonal offerings) and be limited to draught only.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,kent_eh,3,Mon Jul 20 02:24:36 2015 UTC,"dammit.  .  Sayyy... They fill those growler thingies from draft, don't they?"
Winnipeg,3dv5up,pulltheanimal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:22 2015 UTC,"In theory yes, but it's not even listed at the LC as ever having been on offer in growler form.  Check Half Pints' Twitter and Facebook feeds to see if they ever have it at their growler filler in the brewery."

Winnipeg,3dv5up,Brayq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:46:00 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of dark beer but I had FGD a few weeks ago and it was mighty fine. Not something I'd drink all night though.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,ConcernedAboutWpg,6,Mon Jul 20 00:51:18 2015 UTC,"If you want excessively hoppy hoppy hop hops, then Half Pints is the place to go. I still like them, and they used to be my favourite, but I've gotten over-hopped and I'm not nearly the fan I used to be. They still have some great special beers that are quite creative and sometimes not overly hoppy. The Belgian Abbey trio they did recently (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) was truly, truly excellent.  Fort Garry's regular beers (Dark Ale and Pale Ale) are always excellent reliable beers. In the past few years they've also gotten really creative with their Brewmaster Series."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,s3t1p,5,Sun Jul 19 21:29:51 2015 UTC,They do lots of stuff that isn't very hoppy. Of their four flagship beers only one is really hoppy at all.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,chefsati,2,Sun Jul 19 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, St James Pale is barely hoppy at all. Tastes like biting into a big ol' biscuit."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,Manitobaexplorer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:17:56 2015 UTC,Do yourself a favor and drive to Kenora. (It's almost local!) check out lake of the woods brewery. They are doing it right. I find that fort gary has a somewhat limited vision. As an experienced beer drinker I'm fairly excited about the upcoming brew pubs opening later this year!
Winnipeg,3dv5up,TheCaptainsDizzler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:12 2015 UTC,"Limited vision? Fort garry has new brews coming out pretty much on a monthly basis. in addition the inherent red tape involved in starting up any type of beer related business in manitoba is insane, most of these places want even get through the hurdles to break ground. But things are changing in the right direction, let's hope it's easier for start ups to get their foot in the door."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,WinnipegFox,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"In the next 24 months there's gonna be 13 beer type operations opening up in Winnipeg (brewpubs, breweries, etc)"
Winnipeg,3dv5up,MaplePoutineRyeBeer,2,Mon Jul 20 22:04:15 2015 UTC,"Half Pints and Fort Garry. To me, for the longest time Fort Garry was ""old farmer beer"" and low quality but they've improved their beers a considerable amount in the last 5 years. Their Dark Ale is damned nice in the winter time and their seasonals like Kona Stout are damned good. They also make some really bad beer like Stone Cold.  Half Pints is easily one of the best breweries in Canada, but their beer is more for those who are more experimental when it comes to beer tastes, but St James' Pale Ale is cheaper at the LC than Budweiser/Bud Light and tastes damned better than either of them.   There's going to be lots of competition in the next 5 years, but 13 in a year? No. At most 4 or 5 new brewpubs/breweries in province.   Farmery's a writeoff for me, unless if the only options are Farmery or Molson or Labatts at a restaurant."

Winnipeg,3dv5up,DTWinnipeg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:42:38 2015 UTC,Tried Farmery for the first time last week. 8/10 would drink again.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,BiereDeGarde,6,Sun Jul 19 22:35:25 2015 UTC,It is brewed in muskoka Ontario
Winnipeg,3dv5up,stazy,4,Sun Jul 19 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"Meh, highly over rated and it gives me a hangover halfway through a beer for some reason. It's not even local!"
Winnipeg,3dv5up,DTWinnipeg,0,Sun Jul 19 23:01:18 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it. Went down smooth. A great summer beer. Not my favorite but I'd drink it again.   Not local in what way? Could have sworn Farmery is made here and started here. And the founders are from Neepawa.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,stazy,5,Sun Jul 19 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"it's a very sophisticated marketing ploy.  It's been discussed before, it's actually brewed in southern ontario and shipped in.  They have a farm out west, and they may have started growing some of the crops, but i don't think they've used any to make their product yet, it takes a few years to get it right.  Assuming the crop doesn't get damaged."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,Waterpole,7,Mon Jul 20 05:36:57 2015 UTC,Farmery has their beers outsourced to Muskoka.  Calling Farmery local is heresy.(just b/c they promote it so much)
Winnipeg,3dv5up,mazzysturr,6,Sun Jul 19 23:25:11 2015 UTC,"I mean I agree with you but their ingredients are local (to Neepawa). So that's something. But yes every time I hear anyone promoting it to me at the LC or something the first thing is say is, ""So how's that brewery coming along?"""
Winnipeg,3dv5up,DTWinnipeg,3,Mon Jul 20 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"I had no idea. They're trying to open a microbrewery in Neepawa, according to their Wiki."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,Waterpole,2,Mon Jul 20 00:00:48 2015 UTC,They've been trying for awhile now but I think they're too busy making merchandise.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,generically,3,Mon Jul 20 01:44:04 2015 UTC,"But if you want local soap, pancake batter or candles they can serve your needs.  If only they put as much effort into making a decent beer and getting their brewery up and running as they do marketing they might be onto something."
Winnipeg,3dv5up,MaplePoutineRyeBeer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:22:55 2015 UTC,My vote is for Fort Garry Black IPA. Not sure if it's brewed here but it's awesome.
Winnipeg,3dv5up,TheCaptainsDizzler,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"Brewed right across from the IKEA. But their owners are in BC, but it's still local to me - it's local people creating the recipes and brewing the beer and mainly local people drinking the product."

Winnipeg,3dv5up,Sherylificus,3,Mon Jul 20 00:39:17 2015 UTC,Scotch can't be local. For something to be considered scotch it has to come from Scotland.  We do have our own whiskey distilleries here in MB  though.

Brian is a good mechanic and a nice guy so he gave us lots of good advice and saved us lots of money over the years we went there, but he's not that good at running a business.   He waaaaay overbooks what he can handle in a day.  I'd call at 5pm to pick see if my car was ready to pickup and it was always the same.  ""Uhh....  what a coincidence, it's just going up on the hoist right now..."".  Three times I made appointments two weeks in advance to have a timing belt replaced, and all three times I'd go to pick it up and he'd say he was to busy to get to it.  THREE FREAKING TIMES.  He says he just can't turn away new business, but that attitude (and the overbooking it brings) lost him a long time customer.  If you want to take your chances, he's a great mechanic..."

Winnipeg,3dvmgo,Minus6OffIce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"I've never liked Fido's plans as they severely overcharge on Data (50 cents/ MB). If you're a smart phone user who uses data (music streaming, youtube, internet browsing, etc) then Fido is not your best option."
Winnipeg,3dvmgo,Doc_Ydoc,0,Mon Jul 20 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"Their over usage fees on data is $5 per GB over your cap and with the new legislation, the max anyone can charge extra is $50 month."
Winnipeg,3dvmgo,Brayq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:20:50 2015 UTC,I feel that their new pulse plans' high prices are the catch for the $5/1gb thing. I'm grandfathered into a $45 smart plan and my data cap is 200mb + $5 per extra 250mb.

Winnipeg,3dudv7,sourbluerazberry,10,Sun Jul 19 16:46:06 2015 UTC,I've lived in that area all my life. It smells weird maybe once or twice a month and you never smell it inside and normally only in the mornings.
Winnipeg,3dudv7,manitobanlady,9,Sun Jul 19 16:49:24 2015 UTC,I live in old St Vital hardly ever smells and by hardly like almost never. I hang my clothes out to dry all the time without worrying about the smell.
Winnipeg,3dudv7,biga204,5,Sun Jul 19 19:06:50 2015 UTC,I have lived in that area for 4 years. I can't remember the last time it smelled. It is most definitely not once or twice a month as someone else suggested. Also I am almost literally at St. Annes and Fermor. I'm just behind the safeway.
Winnipeg,3dudv7,cmperry51,3,Sun Jul 19 19:37:41 2015 UTC,"I visit often nearby, have never noticed any smell.  I do remember how awful it was by Marion and Archibald from the slaughterhouses."

Winnipeg,3dudv7,Mikebbworkhard,3,Sun Jul 19 16:13:39 2015 UTC,I live right in that area. I smell it maybe 3 or 4 time over the summer. It's really not that bad as you only really smell it in the morning when your heading out to work

Winnipeg,3dudv7,h0twired,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:28 2015 UTC,There have been days when I have been able to smell the mushroom plant all the way to EK (near the river).  It all depends on the wind.
Winnipeg,3dudv7,scopar,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty much just get the hell out of that whole circumference, cause eventually the wind will come from the bad direction.   Sorry but I think this is a gross exaggeration. Your circumference is basically all of Windsor Park and Old St Vital, which does not consistently smell. Hell even parts of Island Lakes are in your radius. I've lived in these areas as well as have many friends in many areas in the green circle and the odour is not evident.   Winnipeg has wind patterns - the two primary directions are from the South and North West. South origin wins take both the Mushroom and Meat plant smells to Point Douglas/south-west Transcona, and the North-West wind typically don't impact as many residential neighbourhoods.   In terms of odour producers, the Mushroom Plant is actually a lot closer to residential communities than the meat plant, especially affecting areas along the Seine river, especially north of Marion."

Winnipeg,3dwkq5,an0n1213,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to answer this nicely. So I apologize in advance.  Because its only about you. Because no one else cares. Because it goes in everyone's feed we have to see your BS.   Because this its becoming a trend that conceded people can post questions that they can easily google.  Oh look! I googled it for you. The top option is a site called ""Yelp"" that reviews hair salons and will tell you the best place to go. It even has customer reviews.   All of which you wont find on reddit.   So to sum up. Reddit isn't the best place to get reviews for local dining, shops or repairs. There are actual web sites designed for it."

I actually want to use Reddit to filter relevant information to my main feed. That includes local information.   Lately Ive been getting pictures of trucks, 'best in the city' and 'ive lost' appearing in my main feed. Too much. I unsubscribed.   There is a winnipeg site dedicated to bad parking (or /r/coalrollers). Yelp is good for local reviews, and the police should be contacted for lost goods.  Not only does it diminish others Reddit experience, but it can be done better elsewhere by using common sense and google.   Also the argument of ""its pretty quiet"" is terrible. Its quiet because people don't get to see the important articles because they get lost in the BS.   So to sum up. I don't really care. It isnt going to change. Someone should start a new /r/winnipeg where mods will actually do their job."

I tried googling, etc. and came up with nothing. I don't know anyone who can offer advice, and red tones can be difficult to get right. There were no previous posts here on the topic when I searched.   Yes, it may be too specific and not helpful to a lot of people, but if someone in the future ever has the same question and checks here, they'll find something helpful.   Sorry that my question doesn't meet your apparently narrow definitions of what belongs on a local subreddit, but it did turn out to be a good idea because now I have a starting point with the suggestions from system_failure that I would not have found otherwise."

Winnipeg,3ds15n,thegirlstoodstill,3,Sun Jul 19 06:15:33 2015 UTC,"Hey neighbour - there's been an increased amount of bike theft in the area recently. Someone was caught trying to steal bikes outside my place and when confronted, he pulled out a knife. Cops were called, but you know how that goes.   There was also another complex  last week that had someone get into the building, break open a lock box and gain access to the storage rooms."

Use a U-lock and not a skinny one that can be broken by putting a pipe in the middle and turning.

Winnipeg,3dq9s0,Peezle,3,Sat Jul 18 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"I wish I could offer recommendations, but my experience with various driving schools in the city ranged from poor to miserable.   Pan-Am - Missed the first appointment I arranged. They apologized and rescheduled it. Missed that one too. Never bothered trying again.  Crossroads - Instructor (Dane) was quite knowledgeable, but the experience was miserable. We spent a good portion of the lesson travelling to/from Transcona, because apparently that's the only place he knows?   He would stop the car in the middle of an intersection if he thought I was turning too tightly, or in the middle of a street if he thought I was too close to a curb or parked cars. I got the feeling that he was a skilled driver, but extremely paranoid passenger. Seemed more worried about curb rash on his fancy training car than anything else, at least when he wasn't on his cell phone. The website talks about a lot of fancy features that weren't used during my lesson, other than the passenger brake, which makes it incredibly awkward to work your own pedals if you have larger feet.  I paid for three lessons initially, and found out after-the-fact that it was actually two lessons and then a warm-up + road test. After my first lesson, he told me I needed way more lessons. At that point I didn't have much faith in him, but I had paid for the lessons already, so I scheduled my next lesson, to which he did not show up. After that I tried scheduling another lesson via the website, and again he did not show up, nor did he return calls or e-mails, so I disputed the charge on my visa and never heard a thing. I did the road test in my buddy's car a few weeks later and passed with no problems."

I highly recommend him. From my experience, we scheduled our lessons and meeting place (apartment or work in my case). Since I have no experience in driving he advised me to take 10 lessons and it worked well for me. We started with basic parking, parallel parking then just drove around our neighborhood. As I progressed, he took me highway driving then traveled along downtown rush hour traffic. He even booked my road test with MPI for me. Really patient, friendly, and professional driver.

I mean, it's dumb when you think of it in terms of normal cinema, but when you consider the potential for avant-garde cinema, focusing on the vertical plane instead of the horizontal might be cool for emphasizing scale. Imagine a movie like Cliffhanger, but shot in vertical rather than horizontal position, to emphasize the mountain's size.  Anyway, in 20 to 30 years movies are going to be shot in 360. Theatres will still play movies in static 16x9 (because they're not going to retrofit thousands of theatres worldwide), but when you get the movie on home video, you'll be able to scroll and pan 360 degrees. It's already happening on YouTube."

For some reason the Winnipeg shawarma places in this city are so stingy on the ingredients or don't put anything authentic in.  A good shawarma should look like this.  Not just iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions and hummus.    You NEED the Lebanese pickles, the pickled cabbage/turnips, the mint/parsley mix and the marinated onions.  Then a good tahini, hummus and hot sauces."
Winnipeg,3dkh9v,h0twired,3,Fri Jul 17 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"Have you been to Baraka? Was great when I went there. Unfortunately, it is far from my place and not open late."
Winnipeg,3dkh9v,crandell84,5,Fri Jul 17 16:43:34 2015 UTC,Baraka is good for the authentic ingredients.  I just find their meat to be pretty dry and tough at times (not always freshly cut off the spit) and sometimes their pitas aren't the freshest either.  They definitely have some great baklava.
Winnipeg,3dkh9v,h0twired,2,Fri Jul 17 17:46:45 2015 UTC,Best Pizza and Donair is good on Pembina. So much fillings and 'authentic filling'. Though ask for donair meat if you want beef/lamb with shawarma fillings + garlic sauce. mm

Winnipeg,3dl6ux,jqpublick,6,Fri Jul 17 13:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm used to asshole drivers and a crappy transit system.  The recurring theme here is I need to learn about the Jets. How are the Jets? Was last season good? Did Jets fans become Coyotes fans when they relocated? Who are the best players?
Winnipeg,3dl6ux,jqpublick,6,Fri Jul 17 05:52:57 2015 UTC,"Many of the Jets are good, I'm sure. I don't know them personally or anything.  The last season was amazing. For a team that's only been around for what, 4 years they made it to the quarter finals. They got knocked out of the quarters right away, but they were up against the best team in the division. Even though the Ducks didn't make it all the way through, they were a top contender for the Cup until the Blackhawks smote them mightily.   When the Jets came back to town I talked to a bunch of friends who are more into hockey than I am and the consensus seemed to be that it'd be fifteen years before we had a really viable hockey team.   I know a few people that followed the Coyotes at first. Most people I know started upping the Flames or the Oilers. Western teams anyway. Western Canadian teams I mean.   I was hoping though, that the theme of the Jets would come across more humorously than it did. Apparently.   The food here is fantastic. There really are a startling amount of restaurants in town. Aaaand I just realized how hungry I am.   Enjoy the city! Virtually I mean."

My favorite football team (Raiders) might be moving away to Los Angeles in a few years so I don't know what I'll do if that happens...

Winnipeg,3dl6ux,ShimmyShimmyYes,3,Fri Jul 17 06:20:27 2015 UTC,"/r/ataradrac named some really good ones, but I feel like the heart of Winnipeg lies in our ""Crappy"" little hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants.  We have an area called the West End (It's actually pretty much dead-center in the middle of the city now...) that is a bit more low income and home to so many great restaurants.  We have a couple food trucks but our summer is too short for a real ""street food"" culture, so I feel like the West End restaurants are our answer to that.    Ask a group of Winnipegers where the best place to get a bowl of Pho is and you'll start an all-out brawl."

For slightly less fancy but still schmancy I would suggest Deer + Almond or Enoteca.   If you want the Mad Men experience in a steakhouse, can't beat Rae & Jerry's.   If you're here during the winter and can get tickets, you have to try Raw: Almond, the restaurant on the river (literally, built on the ice on the river).

Tickets are super expensive to go, amung the highest costs in the league. However they do have a perogie hot dog that is really good, much better than a Dodger dog.  There are seasons here. My wife always made fun of me for saying California is just hot and less hot for seasons. We have four distinct seasons and its wonderful. My wife finally realized that -20C with the sun shining and no wind is a beautiful day.  Bringing a Californian Weimarainer to Wpg is kinda funny when it sees snow for the first time.

But people will pass you and smile when you're out, fall time is absolutely gorgeous, you can find all different artsy/cultural/sporting type activities to attend from concerts, plays, musicals, folklorama in the summer, festivals, hockey, football, or baseball games, you can go fishing in the city...you name it, we have it...well except maybe an ocean breeze.   Culturally we are quite diverse. Macleans said we were the most racist city, but I personally don't think that's true. Journalist didn't do her research!

Or maybe Pembina is the wall and we're the Wildlings? I dunno.  One of my parents is from California originally! That side of the family really couldn't understand why my folks haven't packed it in to move south yet haha.  We have a very diverse music scene. It's really good because they have not much to do other than sit in the basement and jam because its too cold to do much else much of the time.   Our roads are in terrible shape (for many reasons).

He is there to find a way to exploit your family's financial distress to his advantage, i.e. to get you to sign documents that will enable him to eventually get the property for cents on the dollar. He is a  parasite and no good whatsoever will come from having anything to do with him.   If the parents are behind on the mortgage, then they better hurry up and get their shit together. Work something out with the lender or put the house up for sale if they can't afford it. Once foreclosure begins, any equity built up in the property gets flushed down the toilet.  Bottom line: Ignore this twat because he's only going to make things worse for your family, and make sure your parents pull their finances out of the ditch even if that means selling the house and moving. Pony up a few hundred bucks to talk to an expert real estate lawyer and get their advice specific to your situation. Foreclosure means you have lost and lost badly. Do not let it get to that point."

Most often things are not as bad as they seem when all the information is discussed in the open.  Second.  This guy is a parasite.  He's looking for people who are desperate, or more importantly - feel desperate.  Not saying your parents are desperate, they probably aren't.  But that's what this asshole is looking for,  Through normal foreclosure, and I'm not saying that's the case with you parents, but normal foreclosure processes take months and don't involve someone skulking around your house harassing kids.  If this guy was talking to you over the phone without verifying that he was indeed talking to the mortgage holder, then he's violated privacy laws.    Given that he spends a lot of time in Court, either as a Plaintiff or a Defendant, you and your parents should think very long, and very hard about having any dealings with him.  I know I wouldn't deal with him with that kind of a record.  Good luck, and things will work out as long as you stay away from parasites like this.  If your parents need to re-mortgage - go to a Credit Union.  They would be the most helpful and you have the piece of mind knowing you're dealing with an organization that is 100% legitimate and not out to fuck you over.

Though admittedly, since the paywall, the WFP is the last site I visit, and even then only if I'm looking for something specific. Their new site is absolutely atrocious and makes me throw up in my mouth a little."
Winnipeg,3dn2rq,_Benedek_,2,Fri Jul 17 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"I figured I would give the pay as you go a try, because I'm not sure if I read enough articles in a regular month to justify the full $16.99.  I can report that it appears to work as advertised.  You have a short period of time after loading the article to close or leave the page, in case it was by accident.  Haven't been charged any of the times I've done that.  The refund system works well too.  I've read a couple wire articles and a couple I felt there wasn't enough content to justify 27 cents.  In all cases I clicked refund, selected one of the reasons (Too short, misleading title, not enough depth, etc) and it instantly refunded my 27 cents to my running total at the top of the page.  I've never  subscribed to the physical paper, but this seems like it'll probably be a perfectly acceptable solution.  Journalists, photographers, editors, etc need to eat too."
Winnipeg,3dn2rq,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:40:27 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Appatently i read 180ish articles last month between cell work and home.
Winnipeg,3dn2rq,_Benedek_,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:05:24 2015 UTC,"Journalists, photographers, editors, etc need to eat too.   Yeah, that's true. But it's going to come down to a political decision for most people. If you don't agree with the hard left tack the WFP has taken, you won't pay for it. And if you do, you will. But I don't think this will end well for them. Even before if you didn't agree with some of the more ridiculous editorials with activists seeking to be offended, at least you were there providing eyeballs on the news articles. Now you've lost those too. Like anything, a lot of the more popular content subsidizes the less. Who is going to pay for a Jen Zoratti editorial if they won't pay for a cover article? Nobody. And you may have even been able to generate a few hits on that less popular article just by virtue of proximity and convenience. Not anymore.  I get the sense we're 2 quarters from declining revenues before we see a rehash in some capacity."
Winnipeg,3dn2rq,WpgTroglodyte,5,Fri Jul 17 19:57:51 2015 UTC,"Was it their ""hard left tack"" that led them to recommend a Conservative Party majority in the last two elections before election night?"
Winnipeg,3dn2rq,_Benedek_,0,Fri Jul 17 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"That was four years ago. I'm not sure if you've been paying attention to the WFP lately, but you may want to pick up a copy.  On another note, why is everybody so reactionary in this sub? There's no argument about what the politics the WFP represents these days. Not everything requires breathless indignation when it's obvious. If you like it, fine. But don't bring extremely outdated facts into the debate just to stir the pot."
Winnipeg,3dn2rq,WpgTroglodyte,0,Sat Jul 18 00:07:29 2015 UTC,It's the very same editorial board today.   I'll take a bet with you -- in October the WFP will recommend another CPC government before the election. Want to take it?
Winnipeg,3dn2rq,_Benedek_,0,Mon Jul 20 13:11:53 2015 UTC,"A) What does this 'recommend' business mean? I've never heard of a newspaper 'recommending' a government.  B) From the editorial:   Assuming it is even implementable, the assumptions it was built on are outrageous -- that corporate tax increases will increase revenue and not kill the goose that lays golden eggs; that pensions can be increased lavishly without hurting job growth; that pulling supports out from under a pillar of the economy, the oilsands, won't set back the West; and that slapping on a $3.6-billion cap-and-trade regime will not cripple the recovery when the dollar is soaring and we need to create jobs while competing with America, India and China. All in all, Mr. Layton's plan is a recipe for economic stagnation. It shows he and his party have not moved past the discredited tax-and-spend fantasies of yesteryear.   I'd say fantasies of hilariously discredited leftist policies that only show up first year political science textbooks deserve this sort of treatment, don't you?   C) If you think the WFP is going to endorse a Conservative party government, I have no idea what to tell you. Of course they aren't. If you actually think the WFP is a bastion of right-wing thought, then you're so far out on the left nobody could possibly take you seriously. It doesn't matter if the editorial board is the same: they take their direction from the corporate office. You'll notice I used the word 'tack' to describe their obvious political about face. That implies it was abrupt, because it was. People who aren't looking for fascist bogeymen at every corner recognize this was the WFP's business strategy over the past year. Which is why I'll reiterate that an endorsement 4 years old is irrelevant.  My guess is you were probably 14 when that endorsement was made. Just because you can google something doesn't mean you grasp the picture. Maybe in the next election cycle you'll be old enough to understand how this stuff works."

Winnipeg,3dn2rq,Ilikepeg,0,Mon Jul 20 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think the city will have a collective roll on the floor if the editorial board of the Winnipeg Free Press endorses a Conservative Party Candidate. When the NDP took Alberta Shannon Sampert was running around on Twitter and telling Maurice Alexander - a black dude - to check his white male privilege when he questioned what sort of political expertise a yoga instructor added to the ballot to fill ridings weeks before had.  Yeah, I think it's pretty unlikely that the Winnipeg Free Press, a newspaper that employs Jen Zoratti and Melissa Martin to look for instances of sexist outrage around every corner, endorses the Conservative Party. It would be a profound joke if they did."

If it weren't for the fiscal reasons Harper could easily distinguish cannabis from harder drugs and chalk up a win with the libertarian section of the conservative base. Pretty easy to label cannabis policing as dumb big government privacy invasion. It would be super easy to spin to change current opponents minds if they felt like it. Not to mention that plenty of conservative voters already want cannabis reform."

Winnipeg,3diu0d,bingwen,7,Thu Jul 16 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"The way I approached it was to go to my general practitioner, with whom I have a very good relationship, and explain that I had been using marijuana for quite a few years, a fact he knew already. I explained that my doing so did not lead to me ignoring his advice, or not taking the prescriptions he thought were beneficial to me.   I then showed him the Health Canada form and explained that if he simply signed this piece of paper, my marijuana use would cease to be illegal, and I would not be risking my career, and a criminal record for using it.   He had no problem signing it on that logic."

Winnipeg,3diu0d,f48hve94unkj,2,Thu Jul 16 18:54:36 2015 UTC,"Are most doctors reluctant to give out prescriptions? If so, why?"
Winnipeg,3diu0d,iendeduphere,5,Thu Jul 16 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, most doctors are reluctant to fill out the medical document, because while it is legal to prescribe it is still an illegal substance. The only reason it is legal in Canada to prescribe cannabis is because the supreme court ruled it so. The doctors however, still receive scrutiny from their provincial college if they begin to prescribe cannabis. The more cannabis they prescribe, the more scrutiny they come under. All the doctors who are doing this are doing so knowing that their college might give them a hard time because of it."
Winnipeg,3diu0d,majikmonkie,2,Thu Jul 16 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"It is not only the scrutiny they receive from the local college, but for legal liability reasons as well. Most doctors know that the prescriptions being given out are being used to purchase and use cannabis that is of an unknown origin with no quality control procedures in place (the dispensaries, not the lps). Therefore they cannot know what exactly you are taking with that prescription, what type of marijuana, what dose, how often, etc. All they can do is prescribe a number of grams per day which to them means nothing.  The fear is that someone will take the prescription, buy some bad weed, get sick, and sue them for prescribing it in the first place, because they had no way of controlling what the patient did, as stated above. This is not a small issue. All doctors are forced to pay exorbitant prices for medical malpractice insurance, and this is not something they want to deal with, from a legal and insurance standpoint.  Once they are able to prescribe specific strains from specific producers or specific oils with specific dosages, I believe they will be much more comfortable doing so. Right now, the medical marijuana regime set up by the government simply does not mesh well with the medical insurance / liability paradigm."
Winnipeg,3diu0d,GBTRU,3,Thu Jul 16 17:52:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for elaborating. There is also a form that you can have your doctor sign that releases them from any liability due to your decision to consume cannabis.

Winnipeg,3diu0d,klevenisms204,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:16:11 2015 UTC,"There are no actual guidelines for prescribing marijuana laid out by Health Canada. So technically it is not possible to ""prescribe"" it. Marijuana is not an approved drug or medicine in Canada.  The College of Family Physicians of Canada has some vague guidelines: http://www.cfpc.ca/uploadedFiles/Resources/_PDFs/Authorizing%20Dried%20Cannabis%20for%20Chronic%20Pain%20or%20Anxiety.pdf  The notice that the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba gives is: http://cpsm.mb.ca/cjj39alckF30a/wp-content/uploads/st187.pdf  ""Medical purposes"" is literally as vague a guideline as possible.   Dosing guidelines have very weak evidence behind them.   Read through the guidelines and it will quickly become apparent why most physicians are unwilling to ""prescribe"" marijuana."
Winnipeg,3diu0d,f48hve94unkj,2,Fri Jul 17 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"To clear up the questions in the other thread:  What are the advantages to a dispensary versus ordering online? Can you compare cost/fees, selection, advice, etc.?"
Winnipeg,3diu0d,I_AMA_Lorax,5,Thu Jul 16 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"I answered this in the other topic, i'll copy paste my answer and try to add additional comments.  Vancouver is the first city in Canada to begin to regulate dispensaries, however they are still federally ILLEGAL. There is nothing in the law books stating how to go about regulating dispensaries and licensing them. There is NO license, because dispensaries are illegal. HOWEVER. They should not be illegal as they serve a great purpose. If I order my medicine today, on Thursday I will most likely not receive it til Tuesday. That's almost 6 days without medicine, now I could always keep track and make sure I have enough to last me, but what if I end up using a bit more than I thought I was going to? Now it's Sunday night and I have to last two more days without any medicine. Mail order works for some people, but the choice should be ours. If I want to walk into a store and get what I need right then and there I should be able to. I want to see the medicine, I want to smell it. I don't get either of those when ordering online. With all the different phenotypes of similar strains, I'm not sure how well one LP's strain will stack up against another LP with the exact same strain. If I can see the meds in person I can figure out which one I would like better.   The thing with cannabis is its different for everyone. It's not akin to normal pharmaceuticals because it has such a vast amount of effects and medical uses. It makes it easier to understand when you look at it like wine, or liquor. They're all alcohol in the end, but they have different aromas, different tastes, and different price points among other things. What if all those liquors and wines had the same labels and were sold behind the counter and you weren't able to tell what you were going to get? Convert that problem to cannabis and you may understand our plights a bit better. Different cannabis works for different people, for different conditions. Not being able to inspect and know what we are receiving makes it difficult to tell what will help us.  Also, the Licensed Producers, which is the only place we are LEGALLY allowed to get our meds from, charge extremely exorbitant prices. I am with the LP Tilray, if I was to buy my full monthly limit from Tilray it would cost me anywhere from $9 to $14 per gram, plus tax. My limit is 5 grams per day, which equates to 150 grams per month. 150 * $12 (in the middle of 9 and 14) is $1800, and that's without tax and shipping. Can anyone afford $1800 for their medicine, per month?   From the dispensaries, the more I buy, the less they charge. Maybe a gram is $10, but an ounce of that same cannabis would cost $220, right there I save $60. There's nothing like that with the LPs. It's all made to soak people of the little money they already have. Most people that consume cannabis medically are on disability, can anyone afford $1800 per month?   Remember, cannabis is an uninsured medicine. No insurance company will cover it, the only people who get their medicine subsidized are veterans."
Winnipeg,3diu0d,I_AMA_Lorax,2,Thu Jul 16 17:43:00 2015 UTC,Why is it that in Vancouver there are tons of dispensaries giving out prescriptions of marijuana. Why cannot this be done here? What laws are different?
Winnipeg,3diu0d,GBTRU,3,Thu Jul 16 17:18:10 2015 UTC,"There are no laws that are different, only different mind sets of people. If the people here showed that they wanted dispensaries and didn't want the police interfering with them, we could have the same atmosphere here."
Winnipeg,3diu0d,Stinkipeg,2,Thu Jul 16 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"I went to Vancouver last year and stayed on Granville. I walked down the street to get beer and was stopped by a girl who was giving cards outside a dispensary. She said ""come here between 6 and 9 pm tonight to talk to a doctor over Skype and get a prescription for $20.00 and then you will receive a free gram, bring a friend and receive another free gram."" Is it that easy to get a prescription, over Skype? Also, the cop shop was a across the street. Couldn't believe it.   Edit: I added that she said that I would talk to the doctor over Skype."
Winnipeg,3diu0d,redditSadly,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:26 2015 UTC,It really is that easy in BC. Technically now that the MMPR has replaced the MMAR a doctor can write a recommendation for cannabis for almost any condition it may help with. Some doctors are just more strict on what they will write it for. In BC friends of mine have shown their asthma inhaler and gotten their documents signed.
Winnipeg,3diu0d,f48hve94unkj,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yes! I just got back from Vancouver and it's literally that easy. ""I can't sleep at night and marijuana is the only thing that really helps"", Skype Doctor says, ""Oh yes, this is extremely common"". You're then good to buy weed."

My question is: what documentation do I need exactly? Would a simple note stating what my condition is be enough? Or does my doctor need to actually recommend this treatment for me?  I also lost my medical records a few years back, so I don't have much of a documented history with this condition. Could that be a problem?"
Winnipeg,3diu0d,pitynade,4,Thu Jul 16 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"No, your current doctor does not have to support cannabis as a treatment. Either a letter of diagnosis, or part of your medical history showing your condition will work. If your doctor will not give you what you need, you can talk to Vapes off Main and they will have their doctor send a formal written request for your medical history. Your doctor cannot refuse this. The doctor Vapes off Main works with charges $225 to fill out the paperwork, this is the cheapest option I've found in the city.   In addition, if it happens that you are not approved, you will receive your money back."

Winnipeg,3diu0d,Brook420,3,Thu Jul 16 17:45:07 2015 UTC,150 grams is a lot of pot in a month.  Thats literally a joint every hour of every day from when you wake up till you sleep.

Winnipeg,3diwsq,Jokurr87,5,Thu Jul 16 18:03:28 2015 UTC,"The only downside is the length of time dragonflies take to mature. Depending on the species, it can take months before they finally leave the water. While they're in the water they still feed on mosquito larvae, but since those damn mosquitos are prodigious and fast breeders, we'll still have a lot of them buzzing around long before the dragonflies take to the air."

Winnipeg,3diwsq,ZenMommy,3,Sat Jul 18 18:24:29 2015 UTC,"The way it's been explained to me, it's effective at some points, but the life cycles of the species are too different.  Dragonflies live for an entire summer and have an enormous appetite. Sounds great, right?  Mosquitoes can have numerous generations over the course of the summer and can spawn an enormous number from a small population.   So let's say you have a huge number of mosquitoes and a huge number of dragonflies. The dragonflies can successfully reduce the population to minimal levels.   But now what? The dragonflies are still hungry (they can't store fat reserves the way mammals can), but there's nothing left to eat. So they move on or die off. A month later, the mosquito population is back exactly where it started.  In theory you can have 'waves' of dragonflies waiting in the wings, but the numbers aren't feasible. The sheer scale means timing and dissemination would take an army.  It's like getting bears to kill off a glut of mice. Yes, the bears eat a lot of mice. In fact, maybe even almost all the mice. But they'll never get all of them, and when the supply dries up they wander off in search of more stable food supply.  Chemicals used to kill mosquito larvae will also kill dragonflies, but it wipes out the year's population, whereas a few weeks later the mosquitoes have a new batch ready."
Winnipeg,3diwsq,jerrolds,4,Fri Jul 17 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think they bred dragonflies at Bird's Hill this year for Folkfest as they seemed to be everywhere in huge numbers.

Would it be great if everyone was provided with a water bottle, coffee cup, tent, and full meals for the whole festival? Sure, that'll be $1,500 each please. It truly amazes me how many people can complain on the one hand that the festival isn't doing enough, while on the other hand, complain that it costs too much."

Cannabis oil is literally one of the most valuable substances on earth,  it's healing properties can treat a vast amount of ailments and if it can't treat them directly,  it can at least make the symptoms bearable.    Going from dozens or hundreds of seizures a day to none for 18 months is an open and shut case,  this little girl is not doing it to get high.    If our health minister and government had their way,  they would lock up this little girls mother and throw away the key,  then give the little girl her 30 pills back and let her seize daily until she died in CFS custody.

Michalak later visited the ""landing site"" several times where he would find pieces of metal from the spacecraft, but no tests on the ""evidence"" he found proved it to be radioactive and in fact most of it was very common (see next point) Michalak worked with scrap metal, which is awfully convenient   The ""explanations"" for these inconsistencies are all really weak.

The proper thing to do at that point is to just vote and debate against the original motion and not waste everybody's time with the dramatics. It's true that in a democracy the minority has the right to be heard, but shamelessly stalling and filibustering the will of the majority is also a denial of democracy.

Winnipeg,3dftzj,noexistence,4,Thu Jul 16 16:19:32 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of what a co-worker would say when other co-workers would freak out over the possibility that he might get rained on:   ""I am not made of sugar. I will not melt."""
Winnipeg,3dftzj,upofadown,2,Thu Jul 16 17:00:26 2015 UTC,I just bring extra gitch to work lol
Winnipeg,3dftzj,noexistence,2,Thu Jul 16 17:14:56 2015 UTC,Realistically it's 6 months depending on when the snow melts and when the first major snow fall happens.  But with proper protected bike lanes it could extend all year round if you simply dress properly.  Plus the act of cycling generates body heat to keep you warm.  Probably the biggest challenge would be dressing light enough to prevent sweating.
Winnipeg,3dgfp1,GBTRU,19,Thu Jul 16 01:57:16 2015 UTC,The Harper government doesn't want medical cannabis to work effectively and only pass laws that make it more inconvenient and costly to patients. Part of this is not licensing any storefront dispensaries. Dispensaries are an effective way for patients to get advice and actually see what they're buying unlike with mail order. Given that there's no way for dispensaries to operate legitimately the police should do the right thing and ignore it. If you seriously think that the police don't have a million other things that are more useful to do then you aren't thinking clearly.
Winnipeg,3dgfp1,weendogtownandzboys,-10,Thu Jul 16 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"""the police should do the right thing and ignore it"" The police ARE doing the right thing.  They are enforcing the law.  They may or may not agree with the law but their hands are tied."

Winnipeg,3dgfp1,BedriddenSam,2,Thu Jul 16 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"I don't care about having a dispensary around, hell if it helps people then great.   But please, clean it up a bit. I go by there twice a day and it isn't the nicest place too see. Bring the people that like to hang out outside back in. Or do not allow them to hang around. It really just looks like a place for people to hang out and smoke pot all day. I'm sure the Epic Wedge loves it, but many other people do not.   There are always 3-4 people sitting outside on ugly old chairs, there is garbage all around, and that fucking dirty headless manikin with the hideous shirt and all that other ugly clothing on the rust old rack does not belong on the sidewalk.

Winnipeg,3dgfp1,DerrickD26,5,Thu Jul 16 02:02:23 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there is any licensed retail stores yet. Under the new MMPR medical marijuana regulations only the producer can sell dried product.  There are tons of regulations for building security, procedural security, quality control, laboratory testing, storage requirements, supply chain management, patient management, labelling requirements, packaging restrictions, reporting oh the reporting needed, etc... It is very difficult, expensive and time consuming to get these licenses.  If you are a patient with a valid prescription you can become a customer of a grower and can only buy from that grower. You can not shop around, you essential have the prescription with that grower. This can be an issue if you cannot find a strain that is optimal for your symptoms. Health Canada may have worked out prescription transfers by now but in the past you had to go to your doctor for a new prescription. In theory, it is now easier to get a prescription (less onerous on the doctor than the old system) but few doctors will give the prescription.  Oh and after all that security they use Canada Post for delivery."
Winnipeg,3dgfp1,Stompn_Tom,-6,Thu Jul 16 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"Many Meds are controlled tho, I still don't understand why he either can't, or won't get a license?"

Winnipeg,3dgfp1,Stompn_Tom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"Because you don't get prescriptions filled at just any retail store.   You get them filled at a pharmacy,  where they actually have the proper paperwork, and a trained employee with a specialized degree."
Winnipeg,3dgfp1,deathrevived,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:36:56 2015 UTC,It's is still a retail store. Right now the only license is for a manufacturing plant that mail orders to customers.  This operation does require proper paperwork as well.

Winnipeg,3dgfp1,DerrickD26,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:45 2015 UTC,"That is where you start with the regulations. There is no $2M license fee. The cost of getting the building, lights, HVAC, security, IT systems, lab equipment, packaging etc... Costs about that."

It will be legal for recreational use soon anyway. Then let the tax dollar roll in."

Good on him. I don't smoke weed, used to when I was in my late teens but from what I've seen people that smoke weed tend to be pretty chill people. If it helps people with disabilities and pain mitigation then even better and it should be allowed to be sold with a prescription. You can go into a safeway and get a derivative of heroin. That sounds more f**ked."
Winnipeg,3dgfp1,DerrickD26,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:19:38 2015 UTC,"Well he isn't the sole source according to the article, no one should be denied any form of medicine but him closing doesn't deny that, and insulting one form of medicine isn't cool, FYI."

Winnipeg,3dgfp1,DerrickD26,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:17:56 2015 UTC,But in the article it says people can get it delivered to their house from ordering online? So no one is really depending on him? There is other sources?
Winnipeg,3dgfp1,So_Trees,6,Thu Jul 16 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"You are right, they could order through the mail.

The government isn't giving out any licences for this kind of thing so anyone across Canada that owns a dispensary is doing so illegally by federal law, now whether or not your local police service chooses to enforce the fact that it is illegal is up to them.  Vancouver is the first city in Canada to begin to regulate dispensaries, however they are still federally ILLEGAL. There is nothing in the law books stating how to go about regulating dispensaries and licensing them. There is NO license, because dispensaries are illegal. HOWEVER. They should not be illegal as they serve a great purpose. If I order my medicine today, on Thursday I will most likely not receive it til Tuesday. That's almost 6 days without medicine, now I could always keep track and make sure I have enough to last me, but what if I end up using a bit more than I thought I was going to? Now it's Sunday night and I have to last two more days without any medicine. Mail order works for some people, but the choice should be ours. If I want to walk into a store and get what I need right then and there I should be able to. I want to see the medicine, I want to smell it. I don't get either of those when ordering online. With all the different phenotypes of similar strains, I'm not sure how well one LP's strain will stack up against another LP with the exact same strain. If I can see the meds in person I can figure out which one I would like better."

Winnipeg,3dgfp1,majikmonkie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"I would assume that because of the shipping costs, you're kind of forced into buying larger quantities than would be available at a dispensary. If that product doesn't work well for you, there's little recourse, except ordering up a batch of a different strain, and paying shipping fees once again.  Or you could go to the dispensary, tell them your issues/preferences, and they can recommend a product. You'd also be able to buy a smaller quantity to see if it works for you. Remember, many of the people with pot cards could be off work or on limited work because of their illnesses, and costs for medication can add up very quickly.  I'm not in on the medical scene though, so most of what I'm saying is purely speculation, but makes sense to me."

Winnipeg,3dgfp1,DerrickD26,-1,Thu Jul 16 15:56:40 2015 UTC,I still can't figure out why it can't be dispensed from a pharmacy like most other drugs are
Winnipeg,3dgfp1,such-a-mensch,2,Thu Jul 16 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"It probably can and likely will at some point but I'd assume it's got to do with the fact it's not regulated in a manner that would allow a pharmacist to distribute it without fear of losing their licence.   Having seen dispensaries on TV etc, they appear to be set up quite a bit different than a typical pharmacy as well. It seems people want to see and touch the medication prior to procuring it. That along with the fact that different strains help with different disorders, maybe the amount of space required to store and showcase the medication is prohibitive when an existing pharmacy already has their store set up in place and leases signed long term etc.   I'm thinking in a few years we'll start seeing more comprehensive pharmacy's that have standard drugs, mmj and whatever else hits the market coming up. It's not going to happen overnight though."

It's not akin to normal pharmaceuticals because it has such a vast amount of effects and medical uses. It makes it easier to understand when you look at it like wine, or liquor. They're all alcohol in the end, but they have different aromas, different tastes, and different price points among other things. What if all those liquors and wines had the same labels and were sold behind the counter and you weren't able to tell what you were going to get?

Winnipeg,3dgl6r,kochier,2,Thu Jul 16 04:48:58 2015 UTC,"That's not how a representative democracy works. Besides, he isn't detrimental to the city at large. The pedestrian and cycling strategy passed because Wyatt was in the minority overall. The system worked as intended."
Winnipeg,3dgl6r,Jokurr87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, though it feels he was unfairly stalling it, and had a bigger say than the others, that could be because the papers give him more coverage.   Maybe if all the candidates were voted by the whole city, and the top 12 got in or something? Though I guess that wouldn't work either. I'm sure it's best the way it is. Just feels he gets more clout than a lot of the other councillors put together."
Winnipeg,3dgl6r,kochier,2,Thu Jul 16 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"The media does give him more coverage because he is very vocal, but when it comes to actual procedure on city council he doesn't get anymore clout than anyone else. He tried to filibuster the pedestrian and cycling strategy, but the majority of council saw right through it and voted to not waste their time with his endless amount of amendments. The system worked, though it's easy for the media to distort that."
Winnipeg,3dgl6r,Jokurr87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear. Watched the recording of the live stream, nice to see rest of council mostly ignores him.

I did find articles that referred to the ad copy:   ""In last fall's civic election Winnipeggers spoke loud and clear: it's time to fix our basic transportation infrastructure - roads and sidewalks. Now, the Mayor and council are rushing through a long-term plan to spend over $300 million on commuter cycling infrastructure, while our roads continue to crumble,"" one ad says.  ""It's too much. Let's get back to common sense! Let's get back to fixing our existing roads and sidewalks first!"" - Source   This was a classic ""they're spending money on A, therefore they must not be spending anything on B"" argument, which is obviously not true. The strategy calls for $334 million  (or the cost of one underpass) over 20 years. The proposed 6-year (2015-2020) street renewal program is $640 million.  There was also an ad that said the strategy called for cuts to snow clearing.   “Your mayor and council are about to consider a pedestrian and cycling strategy that proposes cuts to sidewalk snow removal. As taxpayers, we know we are a winter city and snow removal has long been a core municipal service, especially for seniors and the disabled. Let’s get back to common sense. Let’s maintain sidewalk snow removal,” the female voice in the ad reads.  It then urges people to call the mayor and their councillors and lists the names of those who paid for the ad. -Source"

Winnipeg,3dez6m,MrAsuleOne,3,Wed Jul 15 19:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate to say this, but there's very little about Winnipeg that I think I would lack in Minneapolis.  You guys have a Fringe Festival about the same size as ours.  You have better cycling infrastructure, a better university, much much much better waterfront recreation, better public transit, better sports, cheaper housing, etc. etc.  You also have some larger employers who actually draw from outside the twin cities area (same with the U) so you have more of a metropolitan feeling than Winnipeg, where there's a very strong feeling of everyone having the exact same social circles since high school.  I'm not being a debbie downer.  I really like Winnipeg (and for many of the same reasons that I like Minneapolis).

Winnipeg,3dez6m,MightyJoeMoon,2,Thu Jul 16 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, just got back from one of many cycling / camping trips in MN, so i'll toss in my $0.02  There's a small, devoted, cycling community populated with cool people, however, there isn't much to ride here....and the bike culture is nowhere close to what I've seen in MN.    Road: Almost all highways are of a lower quality than many MN county roads (no paved shoulders, poorly maintained, etc). Nothing exists like the epic trails being built in MN (Gitchi Gami comes to mind).  Mountain: Flat as a pancake, all trails maintained to some extent by other riders, almost no ""fast and flowy"" like you see in Duluth, Cuyuna, etc. Some fun technical Canadian Shield riding in NW Ontario, but 2-5 hours away (Cuyuna is 5 from here). Downhill: Nothing, zip, zero. Duluth or west of Calgary. Commute: The further your commute is, the more death-traps you'll need to make friends with. It's slowly improving, but 15-20+ years behind the Cities.  Winter: The city doesn't maintain many cycling paths at all during the winter. That being said, it's doable (I do), and 99.9% of Winnipeg will think you're nuts, which you will then wear like a badge of honour!   Camping: Booze is allowed most weekends (unlike MN), both good and bad there. There's some amazing parks, backwoods adventures, and lots and lots of government land to explore. Grand Beach on Lake Winnipeg is a jewel, miles and miles of white sandy beaches. Provincial Park camgrounds here are 'rustic' compared to MN DNR campgrounds. Also, much like MN, owning a cabin is a big thing there for those with the means.   Anyhoo, there's lots of things to like in 'Friendly Manitoba' for someone from 'Minnesota Nice', though cycling isn't one of them. I saw some other really good suggestions in the thread, definitely spend a week up here on a recon mission, particularly during summer festival season.   Edit: formatting"
Winnipeg,3dez6m,Spencie-cat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:55:47 2015 UTC,"Well, we do all have that. There are a lot of great restaurants in the city. I suggest checking out the restaurants on corydon ave and in the exchange district. We have some pretty good shops for nerdy things. Game knight on corydon is cool.   We have bike paths, but probably not to the same caliber as over there."
Winnipeg,3dez6m,humewood_fellow,3,Wed Jul 15 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"Greetings!  It all depends on the season. Here are some ideas.  Summer - Go on a walking food tour (Exchange District or West End), walk through the Forks (there's a variety of events on the website. Barge festival is one that comes to mind, or Interstellar Rodeo happening this summer). You could take a canoe trip in the whiteshell and then pick a spot to camp. Caddy Lake has some neat tunnels. There's actually a few food tours that involve biking from place to place, so those might be of interest to you (I believe they are organized by Downtown Biz so check their website). Osborne Village or the Exchange District are great for nightlife, as is the Good Will which usually has a band playing. There's also Nuit Blanche near the end of summer which is a really lively arts night in Winnipeg. Oh, and another fine dining place to check out is Segovia, which is in Osborne Village.  Here's some other summer day trip ideas outside of Winnipeg:   Ziplining over Pembina Valley Gimli, which has Icelandic culture and is also close to Integrity Foods, a farm which hosts a pizza night each Fri/Sat in the summer Riding Mountain National Park. Wasagaming/Clear Lake is a somewhat touristy spot so if you're not into that, head into a different area of the park.   Now for Winter, which is a different experience.  If you come during Winter, come during Festival du Voyager. Festival is huge in our city and there's tons to do outdoors during it (like attend concerts, check out the historic Fort Gibraltar, climb an ice wall and try Caribou drink), but it still isn't really a ""touristy vibe"" in my opinion. Apart from the festival you can try a pop-up restaurant on the ice of the river (Raw:Almond) or skate that same river trail, which is very very long with unique warming huts along the way. Other winter activities include snowshoeing, cross country skiing, ice fishing and tobogganing. You can even ride a horse-drawn sleigh at Fort Whyte. In the winter you could also spend some time indoors at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and other museums."
Winnipeg,3dez6m,humewood_fellow,3,Wed Jul 15 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"We don't have a tourist season. You'd be best off coming during an event, if you just want to visit. There is probably a week's worth of sights to see though, if you like a wide range of stuff. I would look into the Zoo, the CMHR, the Manitoba Museum,  the Mint, the Aviation Museum, a guided tour of the Exchange, and the Exchange and Osborne Village for nightlife. There's usually some random event going on as well.  I almost forgot the Winnipeg Art Gallery. Right now they are housing a world class Greco-Roman artifact exhibit.  As for the bad, I guess you could check out Portage Place, or go for a walk up Main St north of Portage."
Winnipeg,3dez6m,popeslopethe3rd,2,Wed Jul 15 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"Last two weeks in August is folklorama, it's not a dominating event, but its a great way to sample home cooking from the various cultures that live within the city. Also the weather will still be hot. Grand Beach is busy but nice, Gimli is a nice town nearby, or the provincial parks have nice swimming, camping, fishing, etc. Manitoba is a lot like Minnesota in that it seems everyone goes to the lake on weekends."
Winnipeg,3dez6m,popeslopethe3rd,2,Wed Jul 15 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"Folklorama is first two weeks of August.  But yes, my fave time of year.  Come check me out at Spirit of Ukraine!!"
Winnipeg,3dez6m,nostructurednarrativ,2,Wed Jul 15 23:01:31 2015 UTC,You do know you can't just toss your shit into a car and move over if you like it right? Just making sure that you check to see if you are even eligible.
Winnipeg,3dez6m,wpg_tattoo,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yup, I am aware there would be a immigration process, figured I would visit before spending too much energy in that. Worst case I've got a nice vacation."

Winnipeg,3dez6m,dafirnz,3,Fri Jul 17 00:55:54 2015 UTC,Minneapolis is one of my favorite cities in the world and I have traveled a lot. In my opinion you would be insane to consider moving here. it's fantastic for a visit but Minneapolis offers so much more.
Winnipeg,3dez6m,BackToTheFanta,7,Wed Jul 15 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"Minneapolis is wonderful without a doubt. The short answer is that from the outside at least, I like a lot about Canadian politics better than US , though to be fair I am still learning. Winnipeg makes a visit to my family a long weekend as opposed to Vancouver or Toronto.  This is still very early comptemplation."

Winnipeg,3dez6m,greyfoxv1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:52:03 2015 UTC,"Depending on how much traveling you do, as you mentioned camping somewhere, while there are definitely some kick-ass awesome places to camp nearby. One of the single biggest differences would be that everything that isn't camping is so far away. The nearest ""major"" urban center is about 5 hours away. It's not like you can hop on the I-94 and go to Chicago for a concert and  come back the next day. Any other city worth going to is a full days drive away. Just something to think about."

Winnipeg,3dexyu,sinistermigraine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments. I am thinking about doing this as I have an extra room. So how do you screen your guests? Do you just use Airbnb or do you use Facebook, Skype or Facetime to see their demeanour?"

Winnipeg,3dexyu,pegpegpegpeg,2,Thu Jul 16 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"I have some colleagues who rented using AirBNB while they were being relocated.  A nicer and more 'neighbourhoody' way of learning the city while moving/househunting than staying in extended-stay suites somewhere.  I've been an AirBNB renter before.  I think the biggest thing is that you have to make really clear what to expect.  Is everything going to be provided and cleaned at the level of a good hotel, or should you expect what you'd expect from crashing with a friend?  A lot of the complaints I see on AirBNB are related to these mismatched expectations (people whining, ""oh, the couch leg was wobbly, the towels were thin"", etc.)  I think part of the issue with AirBNB is that they actually serve two markets:  One is essentially short term vacant condo/house rentals kept to hotel standards, professionally managed but impersonal.  One is staying with hosts in their homes to have a social experience.  The expectations are very different!"

Winnipeg,3de2xn,magic5950,2,Wed Jul 15 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"RBC is probably the best for small business. Avoid Credit Unions, they have a strong personal banking orientation, so they lack the ability to offer a lot of services that would make your life easier as a small business (like email money transfers) and likely will only have a one or two specialized Small Business Account Managers.   And if you're looking at lending, remember that Credit Unions and most banks will only lend if you already have money or have tangible property (like real estate) to put up as collateral. RBC is one of the only banks that can and does lend to cash flow, so looking further down the line that is why I'd suggest RBC."

I feel my case was horribly handed by my team of adjusters and after researching MPI that seems to be the case more often then not. I also feel my witness to the case is lying to protect himself as he was working as an parking attendant on the scene of the accident and i'm unable to get the statement unless I take it to small claims court.  I regret not getting the police involved/pushing for more eye witnesses but I was unexperienced in the situation and my girlfriend was hurt at the scene so other priorities took precedence. My only lucky break so far in this case has been the nearly 10k damage to my car didn't write off my car.   If anyone saw or remembers someone talking about a speeding truck smoking me while parking at the Red River Exhibition parking lot on June 17th around 4:30 could you forward information onto me. Its a long shot but I do appreciate any help on this situation or if you know of someone attending the Ex on that day around that time if you could ask on behalf if they saw anything.

There is a serious argument that money can be better spent on something that can be used year round. 60000 people should have a voice. They should be heard.   But ROI for something used 2/3 of the time, with constant upkeep may not be the best way to invest public funds. If 60000 people want bike lanes, maybe they should consider raising the money and upkeep themselves.   They are the minority. The majority of them still use cars. There is a limited budget. We should put our public money where the ROI is the highest. Its as simple as that."

You seriously believe that cyclists should raise the money ourselves to fund city infrastructure?

If you cycle 6 months of the year and take the bus the other 6 months are you a primary cyclist or transit user?   There is no way 9% of the population cycles as it's primary for  of transportation year round. That's just common sense.   There is a small cabal of lunatics that cycle year round, and that's it. Maybe 1/2 of 1% of the population. No i don't have official numbers but neither do you.   The money should be spent on public transit, which can be used year round by everyone.   Bike lanes are great, but a lot of the cities implementing active transportation plans already have their public transport system together AND also have the climate for it.

Winnipeg,3d9dzs,SophistXIII,3,Tue Jul 14 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"See this post... 4 intersections worth a total of ~10 Million dollars, each with more capacity than the needs of the entire neighbourhood. That is what I would call ""over-funded infrastructure for personal vehicles""."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,jxadh95,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"That's an interpretation, not a definition.   Moreover, by what objective measure are they ""over built""? What is the population threshold necessary to justify those intersections.   Have you accounted for potential population growth in those areas? Maybe they're overbuilt right now, but would they considered to be over built in 20 years? One of the chief complaints about our current infrastructure is that it was never designed to accommodate modern traffic levels."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,SophistXIII,4,Tue Jul 14 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I didn't really want to get into the math... If you want me to pull out my green book and for me to open up synchro I can, but I don't think you'll understand the output. (This isn't meant to be a knock on you, it's a lot of info that means very little to a lay-person)  As for the idea that the population could grow in that area, it's actually impossible. It is surrounded by 4 arterial streets, all R1 zoning, and in the curvilinear street pattern. They will never be large multi-unit buildings in there, other than the small number in and around the intersection of Lindenwood Drive E and W. It is already at its capacity.  EDIT: Just to add...   4 intersections... each with more capacity than the needs of the entire neighbourhood.   is a definition of over built."

Winnipeg,3d9dzs,soysource,13,Tue Jul 14 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"1) There is almost never 5ft of snow. Roads are almost always rideable in our winters. The worst spots are intersections (iced up from cars spinning their tires) and fresh snows (mostly at intersections).  The days we get heavy snowfall are few and far between compared to wetter locations. The only difference is that our snow sticks around all year or sublimates.  2) You'd be very surprised how few layers you need while riding around even in -35C. Good mitts, good boots and maybe some Fe-oxide hand/foot warmers, a facemask/balaclava and ski goggles and you're kitted out to ride better than someone driving."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,Vilyamar,3,Tue Jul 14 16:48:51 2015 UTC,What tires would you recommend riding in Winter? Im looking at trying it out. Its my first year riding everyday (Since April).
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,coldpreacher,6,Tue Jul 14 17:39:02 2015 UTC,I use Schwalbe studded tires during the winter months and they are brilliant.  Not once did I glide on ice.  The only thing they can't handle is brownsugar-street-sludge.  But no tire can get traction on that stuff.  Luckily that is only an issue within 24 hours of a new snowfall.

Winnipeg,3d9dzs,brendax,3,Wed Jul 15 01:32:50 2015 UTC,"If you've got the money go for something studded or winter-specific like these from Continental or these from Schwalbe. Really depends what your shop can get in.  If you're on a budget, you can look up how to make studded on your own (screws and tape) or just run a CX type tire up front and a marathon or similar durability tire in the rear.  You really only need studs up from but definitely stick with a flat-resistant tire in the rear (I recommend schwalbe marathons).  E: along with what /u/bussche mentioned, I ride a slightly smaller frame (56 when I normally ride 58-60), use riser bars and sit upright. I ride single speed and two-brakes in the winter with a BMX chain that I lube often. I don't personally use studs but I use the Kenda Kwicks up front and Schwalbe marathon in the rear."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,Vilyamar,2,Tue Jul 14 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents.  For the past 3 years I've ridden relatively skinny, knobby tires (compared to mountain bikes) 700c x 30 Kenda Kwicks. I find they're great on everything but pure ice.  Some people swear by studded tires, I might gives those a shot this year.  The other key factors for me are that I ride a frame that's got a bit more relaxed geometry , a Raleigh One way commuter, and is also a bit small for me.  This makes it easy to dismount in case of an emergency.  It's also fixed gear.  If you've never ridden fixed, it might sound crazy but I find you can really feel out your traction and adjust accordingly.  You stop with a combination of light hand braking and resisting the pedal with your legs, that way you don't lock up your brakes and go down."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,bussche,11,Tue Jul 14 18:37:05 2015 UTC,My last 5 years of winter biking have taught me that is when it's even better to bike. When conditions are shitty your car is not going to start and the bus is not going to show up.  ... Always have a lighter to defrost your lock!

Winnipeg,3d9dzs,sauze,-3,Wed Jul 15 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.   Even if you cycle 6 months of the year, you're still by far aways the minority.   Investing in transit infrastructure - both rapid transit and dedicatrd bus lanes which cyclists can use as well - makes far more sense than investing in bike lanes.   Why does this make sense you ask? Well, transit can be used by nearly everyone, it can be used year round and it is used by a far higher volume of people.   Cycling in this city is at best a 6 month endeavour, and even then i would suggest that the vast majority only do it in the summer months. Secondly, only a small fraction of the city's population cycles to work. Spending millions of dollars to accomodate a small fraction of the population is absurd. It's simply not an efficient allocation of tax dollars.   Can you spend money on fixing infrastructure, better public transit and ""active transport""? Well yes, you can. But that also means spending more of our tax dollars.   And now, let the small minded ecomentalists downvote me without addressing any of my arguments."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,SophistXIII,11,Tue Jul 14 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the article again. The ""small fraction of the population"" that cycles or walks to work (9%) is larger than the percentage of transportation funding that goes towards pedestrian and cycling infrastructure (6.7%). How is that not an efficient allocation of tax dollars? Why should other modes of transportation get a larger slice of the pie than they deserve?"
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,Jokurr87,-7,Tue Jul 14 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"I specifically mentioned cyclists, we don't even know what percentage of that 9% is cyclists. Moreover, we don't know what percentage of that 6.7% is spent on just cycling infrastructure. So no, we can't determine whether or not money spent on cycling infrastructure is efficient.   Secondly, you haven't addressed my argument that cycling is at best a 6 month endeavor. Is whatever percentage of that 9% taken from peak usage in the summer? Or is it an average over the year? If it's only a percentage of 9% over a 6 month period, you could half that percentage in terms of actual use on an average monthly basis."

If it's only a percentage of 9% over a 6 month period, you could half that percentage in terms of actual use on an average monthly basis.   Well, considering we build automobile infrastructure to the peak usage of 5 hours in the day I don't think this argument holds salt. Should we be spending 3 million dollars on intersections that will need that capacity for morning and afternoon rush hour? ~ 20% of the total day. Because that's the road you're going down. If we only need it for 20% of the day, perhaps it should be 20% the capacity."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,jxadh95,11,Tue Jul 14 19:43:05 2015 UTC,You do realize that even if it were true that people only biked for 6 months of the year that's 6 months of less vehicles on the road which means:   Less accidents. Less greenhouse gas. Less road wear which means reduced maintenance in the long term. Healthier residents which means reduced health costs in the long term.   Think outside your narrow perspective.
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,greyfoxv1,-10,Tue Jul 14 18:37:10 2015 UTC,"This is some pretty tortured logic.   Less vehicles on the road or less people taking the bus?

Cycling is not the be all end all, try getting that out of your small brain."

Winnipeg,3d9dzs,greyfoxv1,-9,Tue Jul 14 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"My only point of contention : 10 percent want to use bikes, for HALF the year.   I think there is a serious argument that we should invest in infrastructure we can use all year round, and in any weather. People don't bike on rainy days either."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,an0n1213,9,Tue Jul 14 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"1) Plenty of people do bike on rainy days, and bike through the winter  2) You seem to have misread the numbers. 10% DO bike. 47% want to bike, and would if there were better infrastructure."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,AssaultedCracker,-4,Tue Jul 14 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"1) Statistically less people bike on rainy days or through the winter. When it rains or is cold, statistically more people drive.   2) Using 47% of people want to bike is misleading. It has no metric with it, suggesting how often they would bike, or at what ratio to car use. I would argue, the majority of 47% would still use their car as a primary source of transportation. Also ""47%"" wishes is like saying 80% of people hope they can work out more. Even if they make a new free gym, the actual usage would be much less.   So I think my point stands. OF the 10% who use bikes, you should at least modify it by 2/3 to account for winter, when comparing it to the 6.7 % investment of infrastructure.   I am not nay saying bike lanes. I am just suggesting that if you want to do this ""by the numbers"", they number should not be misleading to total use. (Since cars are used year round, are the primary source of transportation, and are almost a necessity for a lot of jobs. - which bikes are not)"
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,an0n1213,6,Tue Jul 14 20:10:54 2015 UTC,"1) Sure. But your original post made it sound like you think that only 10% of people want to bike at all, and that none of them would bike in winter.   2) Citing that figure on its own is not misleading, it is merely limited by the scope of what is claimed. If somebody used that figure to claim that biking would go up by 47% with proper infrastructure, that would be misleading. Neither of those is as misleading as using the wrong numbers for the wrong facts, as you did when you said ""10 percent want to use bikes, for HALF the year.""   OF the 10% who use bikes, you should at least modify it by 2/3 to account for winter, when comparing it to the 6.7 % investment of infrastructure.   That's fair enough, although I'd certainly prefer to have those numbers in hand, rather than just take a guess at them. But since we're taking all things into account, we should also account for the reduced cost to the vehicle infrastructure that will happen when some of the people who now drive start cycling because of the improved cycle infrastructure, not to mention the improvements to general traffic flow, which is a factor that's directly linked to the production of the local economy, which is of course linked to tax revenue."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,AssaultedCracker,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry. ""10 percent want to bike for 2/3 the year, minus the majority of people who dont want to bike in poor weather""  To your third point, putting money directly into improving roads would improve traffic flow probably more than indirectly through bike paths. Especially when considering bikes will not be uses 1/3 of the time.   For the record I am all for improving bike lanes. I just argue there is a lot lower trade off value since we live farther north, and our city has more urban sprawl than most.  If there is a trade off for road vs cycle, I am pro road. If there is an option for both, do both.   For example, there are bus only lanes that I see are not busy during peak rush hour. They go to the same destination, but are ""speed lanes"" to help reduce wait times on buses. Given that situation, I would rather have an extra lane of road, than a road dedicated to buses. Increasing throughput, and efficiency for all."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,an0n1213,2,Tue Jul 14 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry. ""10 percent want to bike for 2/3 the year, minus the majority of people who dont want to bike in poor weather""   But that's still wrong. 10% DO bike, minus the people who don't bike in poor weather. 47% WOULD bike, minus the people who don't bike in poor weather, if there were better infrastructure.   To your third point, putting money directly into improving roads would improve traffic flow probably more than indirectly through bike paths. Especially when considering bikes will not be uses 1/3 of the time.   But this is irrelevant to my point. We were discussing the benefits of implementing biking infrastructure, and this is one of the benefits that should be factored in.    If there is a trade off for road vs cycle, I am pro road. If there is an option for both, do both.   Well then you are always pro-road. There will always be something you could do for motorists instead of cyclists. Your example is incredibly short-sighted. The same could be said for commuter lanes, and yet every single major city I've been to has them. They're often underused compared to the rest of the lanes, so why not open them to everybody and increase throughput for all? Because they are there in order to influence behaviour, in order to increase throughput for all on a much larger scale. The less vehicles we have on our roads, the more efficient they will be."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,AssaultedCracker,0,Tue Jul 14 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"Sigh. We are going around in circles. I think we both made our points.   I dislike your characterization of me being short sighted for pointing out flaws in the current system. It is beneficial all around to admit that there is a under use of bus only lanes. There has to be a better solution. Maybe a bus only lane sometimes Or changeable street directions like in Alberta.   Influencing behavior is nice. I get it. Its positive. I want less vehicles on the road as well. It doesn't solve the short term problems, or fix the fact that most Winnipegers chose to drive because they arent going to walk/bus in the cold or because they have to have a car for their jobs.   So to go full circle, I like encouraging buses. I like encouraging biking. I just have an argument with the $ return in use on bike lanes, and the efficiency of bus only lanes during rush hour. Logically if there is a road, and it is not used, there has to be a better solution."
Winnipeg,3d9dzs,an0n1213,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:03:32 2015 UTC,"I dislike your characterization   I didn't characterize you. I said that your example is short-sighted. If you took that personally, that's on you.   It is beneficial all around to admit that there is a under use of bus only lanes.    The reason I call this short-sighted thinking is because you are focussing on the problem of now, without prioritizing fixing the problem in the long-term. The lanes are under-used for a reason. They are under-used so that they are fast, for busses. So that people will want to take the bus, even if it is cold out. This is a concept that every major city I've been to utilizes in some fashion, whether it be car pool lanes or transit lanes. Those lanes are, by your definition, under-used. But that's how they're supposed to be, because it encourages people to use them, which gets cars off the roads. Now, I still think you have a point, that we could be combining our bus lanes with another use. They could be combined bus lanes and car pool lanes.    Influencing behavior is nice. I get it. Its positive. I want less vehicles on the road as well. It doesn't solve the short term problems, or fix the fact that most Winnipegers chose to drive because they arent going to walk/bus in the cold or because they have to have a car for their jobs.   See, you're doing it here. When you prioritize the short-term over the long-term, you are being short-sighted.  Influencing behaviour is more than just nice. It is the solution to long-term traffic problems. The population of the city is only going to grow, and with that traffic is going to grow. If you don't have a user-base of people who use transit instead of using a car for everything, despite the fact that it's cold here, then at some point it is simply going to overwhelm the capacity of your roads. Are we going to tear out all the businesses along Pembina, Route 90, Portage, Henderson, etc in order to make wider roads? What's the cost-benefit ratio to that? No, the solution is developing a culture where people use mass-transit, and the only way to make that happen is to make it more appealing than driving. In a climate that is colder than most, we will need to be particularly aggressive and forward-thinking in order to make that happen."

Winnipeg,3dbez0,greyfoxv1,10,Tue Jul 14 23:36:02 2015 UTC,"According to city staff, Terracon needed provincial education taxes waived on the property in order to make the deal work.   I'm going to call bullshit on this one. If they (Terracon) don't have the financial capability to develop the land in a timely and profitable manner they should sell all their holdings before they go broke, because obviously they have no clue what they are doing. As a corporation they are ginormous. They already have on fully developed business park in Terracon place, another well developed but still expanding one at Tuxedo business park and the 2 buildings that so far represent ""The Waters"" on Mazenod. Never mind the other companies that fall under the same umbrella."
Winnipeg,3dbez0,dafirnz,-2,Wed Jul 15 01:16:16 2015 UTC,"Land development in this city is exceptionally expensive, and that goes especially when you're accommodating industrial development that pays low rents and requires lots of capacity. Returns are somewhere on the order of 5%. This has nothing to do with the financial capacity of Terracon, it has everything to do with deciding whether a project is worth the risk.  What does the size of the company have anything to do with whether the investment makes sense? They have plenty of capital. As such, they get to decide the best usage for it and they've determined this isn't it."
Winnipeg,3dbez0,WpgTroglodyte,6,Wed Jul 15 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"So the city should then backstop private for profit development with education taxes?   They obviously enough profit made from their other ventures, because they keep building. If there really is no profit to be made the land will continue to sit as it has forever, vacant. If there is profit to be made, someone can feel free to make it."
Winnipeg,3dbez0,dafirnz,0,Wed Jul 15 05:28:46 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the city doesn't have any control of education taxes. They're merely bound by legislation to collect them. The reason this development was moving forward was because somebody in the old administration made a promise they couldn't keep which was that the province would waive them. They won't. In the meantime, the city has waived their portion which is the municipal mill rate.  Second, the city doesn't have to do anything much in the same way the corporation doesn't have to. That's why Terracon walked. The issue is that the city, by its own admission, doesn't have the competence or expertise to develop the land. They were partnering with Terracon in a joint venture for that reason. Now that Terracon has walked away the city is going to take a huge hit having to rush services into the area so they can get the tenant (Parmalat) ready for build. You'll notice Parmalat isn't picking up the tab for that either. That's because there's no money to be made on this particular piece of land development even if the city is able to collect business taxes and create employment going forward. That's something Terracon has no interest in but motivates the city in a different way. It's also a six-of-one, half-dozen-of-the-other proposition. The city can either waive a certain amount of property taxes in order to see the development come to fruition, or it can itself go and borrow more money to put the servicing in. It's the same effect. You can classify one as 'backstopping private development' and not the other, but they're both the same. That's the cost of being able to attract corporations to employment lands. You either incentivize them in some capacity or they take their production facility to a municipality that will.  And lastly, every piece of land is different. All of the servicing requirements and different physical components of the land can make something unprofitable just by virtue of its proximity. You keep mentioning Terracon's other ventures; those are completely irrelevant. There are a multitude of reasons those projects could be more valuable: i) cheaper land costs (either from being further out or from having been held for many years) ii) Easier engineering for servicing iii) Tenants prepared to pay higher rents etc... They have less than nothing to do with this project. Your logic would actually lead somebody to believe that given they have many other successful ventures, if they can't make a profitable run at this, it's likely nobody else can either. There's no merit in the fuzzy connection you're trying to draw. And this is why the city is going to take a bath servicing and getting this land ready on their own."
Winnipeg,3dbez0,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:16:03 2015 UTC,"You mean extending service to new land is expensive here, right? Building and land out there in bumfuck nowhere transcona is cheap. Extending service into empty fields when our core is crumbling around city hall is what's expensive.  Wyatt's out there shouting to the rooftops that we can't afford a few AT upgrades when he wants to throw cash at businesses that can afford it."
Winnipeg,3dbez0,Vilyamar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:53:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, he voted against this plan interestingly enough.  But no, I mean land development is expensive anywhere in this city today, including the outer reaches. Residential is somewhere on the order of $250K/acre. Industrial can run higher because of the size of services you require in order to accommodate fire suppression and the sheer amount of water and waste that emanates from manufacturing facilities. I'm not talking at all about ongoing maintenance or anything else - I'm speaking strictly about the rate of return associate with the development of the property and that's driven only by costs and rents. And industrial rents in this city are weak. That's why there's a shortage of industrial lands.  But these are considered employment lands and as such are valuable to the city beyond just the property taxes which was why they were prepared to kick in the municipal portion of the tax bill. They see business taxes and employment.   In the end, the city has to borrow the money and cut the taxes anyway to get this serviced - now they're just out the experience they went looking for in the first place. I have no idea why people think Terracon is bluffing on this. If there was money to be made, they'd be doing it even without the provincial tax subsidy. But they're not because it's a worthless project that they're happy to let the city take a bath on instead of them."
Winnipeg,3dbez0,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:21:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'm not familiar with any numbers beyond anecdotal. I can certainly understand that industrial rents are low here.  As far as I understand it, rents stay low because of vacancy. I imagine that the city bending over to build new developments doesn't plus ""new car smell"" buildings make it more attractive to develop new spaces before its not worth it.  Now it isn't worth it... so I suppose the city should go back to working with what's available and selling that to developers?"
Winnipeg,3dbez0,Vilyamar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:16:29 2015 UTC,"Industrial leasing is quite a bit different than other forms. You can have vacancies available but with nothing suitable for the prospective tenant. And there can be a multitude of reasons for this - capacity of servicing, size of the space, layouts that can't be feasibly re-engineered, proximity to rail lines and highways, etc... - but they all matter. If you have a landlord sitting on a long term vacancy, you'd hope to be able to get a deal done with them. For one, they're desperate. That means you're getting a deal right off the hop. But you're also likely to get incentives: leaseholds, discounted rents, months of free rents, willingness to absorb certain tenant expenses, etc... This is a good option where you can find it. But in this case there wasn't a proper fit anywhere; they needed to build. As such, they needed vacant land zoned industrial that's serviced. Well, there isn't much of that. So now the city is stuck doing the development. And given that the numbers don't work for a company like Terracon, selling it to another developer is unlikely. The city will have to take the loss itself."

I can also confirm there is no Fringe Flyer shuttle bus, the Fringe could not get funding for it, so it was scrapped.  One other change this year, is all advanced tickets need to picked up at the venue just prior to the show.  No more picking them up at the MTC box office.  The suggestions are a fairly good list.  I'll also plug the Jenny Revue and its online program guide which is searchable."

OP is trashing the clinic because their computers were frozen, and appears to be using Fedora as the scapegoat. He doesn't seem to offer any insight or evidence that indicates Fedora being the problem. He saw something he clearly had a negative experience with and jumped to a conclusion.

The letter said that the computer had been stolen, and was not password protected, so I was advised to contact an identity theft specialist. Completely outrageous. I work for the government, and we're not even allowed to save things to our hard drives. Everything comes off a server, and we work on a virtual drive. What the hell Concordia?!

Some of our city leaders understand what it takes for a city to grow, but it seems there are just as many who don't understand. It's hard to get change to happen in Winnipeg. I also hate how as a city we are growing out (e.g. Sage Creek, Bridgewater Forest, etc) rather than growing up (condo, apartments etc.)."

As long as you know where you want to go and are flexible in the dates, Google is really good at finding flights (it's a built in feature of the search engine).

Winnipeg,3d7vs5,h0twired,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:07:55 2015 UTC,I disagree.  Most international flights are around 10-15% more at best when compared to leaving from Toronto or Vancouver.  Sure it is still more but its not going to break the bank if you are already planning a trip to London or Hong Kong.  If you are flying within Canada or the US it can actually be cheaper to live in Winnipeg.
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,tmlrule,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"It all depends where you're traveling. A lot of destinations don't have any direct service from Winnipeg, so you basically have to pay for a round-trip flight to Toronto/Vancouver/Montreal on top of the flight to your destination.  I'm flying to the Maritimes for a wedding for example, and the trip is essentially double the price for the same trip for my friends from Toronto."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,h0twired,2,Tue Jul 14 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"Really you mean you have to pay more when you fly further?  Go figure.    How do you think their guests from Vancouver feel?  At the end of the day Winnipeg is in the middle so if you travel east just as much as you travel west, it should average out to the same (if not better) than those living in Vancover or Toronto and traveling to the same destinations."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,tmlrule,2,Tue Jul 14 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  Flying from Winnipeg to Charlottetown is within ~$150 as flying from Vancouver to Charlottetown. Both go through Toronto, but there's enough traffic from Vancouver to make the prices much more competitive. Flying anywhere on the west coast, and the person from Vancouver will save $600 for the cost of a Winnipeg-Vancouver trip."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,h0twired,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:03 2015 UTC,I took a look at Air Canada and took the same dates from YVR to YYG and from YWG to YYG and the difference was $242 for the return flights (taking the cheapest flights available).  Additionally a return flight from YWG to YVR for the same dates came in at $492.  The smaller difference here comes in the fact that you are still landing at the same airports.  You can't just assume that the flight from Vancouver to Toronto should be $600 more than the flight from Winnipeg to Toronto just because a flight from Winnipeg to Vancouver costs $600 return.  The difference being paid here is the costs for the plane to be in the air for an extra three hours from Vancouver.
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,TheRealSilverBlade,23,Wed Jul 15 14:06:29 2015 UTC,I love that this city is affordable to live in and that you can be anywhere within 30 minutes.  But I hate that it's so fucking hard to meet new people. No one wants to know more than their circle of friends.

You chose where you live.  I lived out in the sticks when I was living in Calgary (couldn't afford to live in the core) and hated it.  When I moved back to Winnipeg I specifically chose a house based on its proximity to work, schools, parks, stores and other amenities.  Poor urban planning resulting in areas like Sage Creek, Waverley West and East Transcona are the worst things about Winnipeg IMO."

Just because people with money want to get away from all the drug dealers, hookers and drunks in the shitty parts of town, it's poor planning?  There's better amenities out here than in most other parts of the city.  The sobeys here is amazing, there's other stores going in right now.  Banks, a liquor mart, restaurants.  There's even a school going up in sage creek.  We chose to live out here because my wife drives an hour one way  to the south west for work and this is the best appointed convenient location."

I'm visually impaired so I'll never be able to drive and I'm clumsy as fuck so riding a bike freaks me out. Transit is pretty much my only option for getting places that aren't in my neighbourhood. The worse part is getting from downtown to the suburbs.

It has interesting neighbourhoods with a lot of texture, and there is enough going on to keep one from ever having to be bored.  I also like the fact that people here are really engaged. You get the sense that people care about the city. Maybe it's because so many of us are born and raised here, I don't know. But people really pay attention to what's going on here.  One of the things I like least is our insecurity. Things like:  *incredulously asking visitors why they came here, as if there was no possible reason that a person could find Winnipeg interesting  *(guys are bad for this) latching on to the Jets and wearing Jets gear from the moment you leave Canada until the moment  you return, as if anyone outside of a few sports obsessives know or care what the Jets or the NHL is  *(the media is bad for this) going nuts about any kind of coverage that Winnipeg gets in the foreign press  Generally speaking, we do have a lamentable adolescent-like insecurity complex when it comes to our relationship with our city."

We need to do something about it now, before it gets handed down to another generation. (On both sides) We need to have an open discussion about it, without one sided propaganda. It has to be forced to a Federal level to deal with the issue of reserves.

Hate: The worship of True North and the Jets and their merchandising empire with fans almost as rabid and devoted to their expensive subculture as Juggalos.   The racism and how cavalier people are about the suffering going on in our inner city ghettos and food deserts.  The parochial and closed-minded attitude of people who grow up here. Folks are scared to death of any kind of change in this city, and vote in administrations with no new ideas but more of the same- endless suburban sprawl with no cohesive plan for transit or transportation, subsidizing private developers with a city budget that can't keep up with infrastructure and service costs while the cops/firefighters/EMTs and the good old boys at city hall hoover up the rest of the money.   People are terrified of letting newcomers in to their established groups, lasting from highschool, to the workplace, to the grave. Good luck getting any sort of decent job without an 'in'. If you don't know how to nepotism, you're going to have a bad time in Winnipeg. The old frontier attitude of ""got mine, fuck you"" is very much alive here."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,Minus6OffIce,8,Tue Jul 14 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the hate for True North and the Jets. If you're not a hockey fan, that's OK. You have to understand what True North has done for this city. More so Mark Chipman.  Winnipeg was in bad shape in the mid 90s. Poor dollar, crime at an all time high. Then the city lost the Jets as well. Chipman brought the Moose here so his city could have some form of professional hockey while he tried to get an NHL team back.  He spent 15 years trying to get this city something they lost, back. We have a new arena downtown which was a huge catalyst to the revitalization of downtown. Regardless of what people say and how bad downtown is. It's nothing like it use to be. Chipman and TNSE are putting a lot back into the community. More than anyone has in the last 20 years.  Yea, some Jets fans are tools. Those people are tools and just happen to be Jets fans.  I know for me, I appreciate everything Chipman and TNSE has done for this city."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,mysticsavage,4,Tue Jul 14 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the True North hate either, but I can agree with apothocalypse that this town can be clique-ish and incredibly resistant to change.  And most of that is because previous administrations have left us in such a cash/infrastructure crunch that moving us forward means serious raises in taxes."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,apotholecalypse,3,Tue Jul 14 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Taxpayers should not be subsidizing private sports teams, and especially not an NHL franchise that's making their owners ludicrous sums of money. Why should two levels of government sink hundreds of millions of dollars of public money into a team that the majority of citizens couldn't dream of affording tickets to see, and will likely not stick around in the long term once fans feel the pinch of a lousy dollar and lousy team once more?  Mark didn't increase the value of the Canadian dollar, or fight crime in Winnipeg. True North hasn't done much for the downtown core, aside from opening up bars where you can go and give the Chipmans even more of your money, while taking away customers and sorely needed funds from non-sports related businesses and events downtown. The piles of cash blown away on a mediocre NHL team by our governments could have been put to so much better use in this city, but sadly, they caved to the unending hockey stick penis envy of fans here- who would like to pretend Winnipeg can afford to compete in the rat race of professional sports with the big money American teams.  At least we can all now pay hundreds of dollars to watch a bunch of millionaires slap a puck around for a few hours, before heading home because there's little else to do downtown that's not about wasting a bunch of money watching sports and/or drinking overpriced booze. Don't forget to pick up your official licensed Winnipeg Jets rug for for only $59.99, and remember to pray on it five times per day in the direction of the MTS Centre!"
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,A-Ron,-2,Tue Jul 14 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"You're basically shitting on the general idea of organized, for-profit sports and their fans.  If you think there is no benefit to a city having a pro-sports team, there is no sense in arguing with you.  I'd be willing to bet you're in the minority when it comes to your feelings about the Jets here.  You should just accept it and let people spend their money on what they want.  Go back to knitting, because you sound like a pantywaist."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,apotholecalypse,3,Tue Jul 14 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Okay there, brodozer.   I have nothing against organized sports, as long as it's strictly privately run and supported by the fans, not subsidized with tens of millions of dollars in public tax money doing little more than making a few millionaires and sports bar owners even richer at everyone else's expense. If you think True North has somehow revitalized downtown, maybe you've suffered one too many concussions."

Winnipeg,3d7vs5,A-Ron,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:18 2015 UTC,"You should look a little harder then. Are you saying you've never heard of the True North Foundation ?  http://jets.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=75796  And you're going to ignore any current or future development that's been done downtown, undoubtedly because of the Jets returning ?  You'd also have to thank their return for at least part of any ""revitalization"" of downtown that's happened.  Not being a hockey fan is one thing, but being ignorant is another."
Winnipeg,3d7vs5,greyfoxv1,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"I should have qualified that as an ""impartial list"" but even then the IcePlex and a single charity of choice is hardly much. They also did not revitalize downtown. Having people show up for 49 home games for a few hours each doesn't inject much cash into the downtown aside from those individual nights. Future developments are irrelevant since the True North hotel/residential complex has yet to even break ground."

This place is filled with people clogging up left lanes, slow drivers, a lack of turning signal use, idiots with lifted trucks who think they own the planet, inefficient road design, poor light timing, excessive lights, a lack of under/overpasses to get around trains etc. The Layout.   There are merely small pockets where the city is of any value at all to a person who wants to walk from their house to actually do things other than just walk.  Unless you live in Osborne, there is pretty much no place where walking can conveniently get you to anything more than a convenience store.   The weather.  If its hot, a storm follows.  If its cold its bitter.  There is rarely a happy medium where it isn't raining and the temperature is tolerable. Jets fans.  What an insufferable group of nauseating people.  As a fan of a team other than the Jets, the level of obnoxiousness you see in this city is bar none worse than I have ever witnessed.  Just as an example, Leaf fans have been FAR more enjoyable to watch games with in their barn.

Now, if you're in a fwd vehicle, it's a whole different story and it's more difficult to take the tail out, and much more difficult to regain it.    That being said, a good driver will test the limits of the vehicle to know where that control edge is.  How do you know where that edge is if you've never looked.

Aside from being overly aggressive around pedestrians (e.g. it's amazing that there haven't been more serious injuries on Graham Ave by The Bay) but they also drive like their little Yield signs mean anything.  Driving at speed beside a bus with slippery roads and ice grooves and traffic on the other side of you? Who cares, that bus is coming into your lane any time he wants. All the fucking time."
Winnipeg,3d6dxn,eightinchtip,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:33 2015 UTC,Why do you think that yield sign means nothing? In most cities you are charged for not yielding right of way to transit.

Yield signs on the back of a bus? Not so much.  And, if you're beside the bus and he just decides that he's going to come on over forcing you to throw on your brakes or get pushed over into other traffic? That's not right of way, that's just another bus driver being an asshole who's going to get someone killed.  I am curious though. What cities have bi-laws allowing for a person to be ticketed for not yielding for a lane changing bus?"

Winnipeg,3d6dxn,ThethingsIdowould,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"TIL, some jurisdictions give special right of way to buses.    As far as I can tell, Manitoba has no such laws, although there appears to be some support for some type of 'Yield to Bus' legislation from some City of Winnipeg politicians. (I haven't found any similar support from any provincial politicians which are who would have to pass such a law)  But, even in BC, the legislation stipulates that ""Transit bus operators must ensure that traffic is yielding first before pulling onto the roadway.""  In Winnipeg, where there apparently is no similar laws, the bus drivers bother with that.  They just pull out when they fell like it."
Winnipeg,3d6dxn,eightinchtip,0,Fri Jul 17 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, they transporting up to 75 people, have the right of way over you, the individual."
Winnipeg,3d6dxn,ThethingsIdowould,0,Fri Jul 17 02:50:29 2015 UTC,"They problem is (a) I don't think that they have any special right of way in Manitoba, and (b) even if they did they are required to ensure that it's safe to do so, which they don't.  I'm convinced Transit drivers get more training on being being 'assertive' (aka aggressive) than they do with being safe.  ""I'm big and carrying up to 75 people, therefore I'm more important and I'll endanger these other vehicles because I'm more important""  You want to know how insane they can be, take a lawn chair down to Graham by HBC during rush hour. I've seen a pedestrian get bumped and I've heard of numerous accidents.  I believe someone was killed there a while back (within the last 10 years?) and they still take that corner like their blind, or like them moving is just too important to wait for the intersection to clear."
Winnipeg,3d6dxn,eightinchtip,2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"You obviously have a personal grudge against transit and feel you are more important than the public transportation system. Nothing I say will change that, so nice chatting with you."
Winnipeg,3d6dxn,ThethingsIdowould,0,Fri Jul 17 02:56:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I would call it a personal grudge. I've never been in an accident involving one, or had any direct negative problem with them the times I rode with them, which was at least 15 years ago.  But, I do think that they are terrible drivers. Unsafe and uncourteous. Overly aggressive and careless. Unskilled and undertrained. Unalert and inattentive.   And no, I absolutely do not think that I am more important than the public transportation system.  I don't even think that I'm more important than a single bus.  I also don't think that a bus is more important than any other vehicle on the road. The fact that you think so is one thing, the fact that these bus drivers think the same and drive as if they were, is ridiculous.  edit: I don't think either of us will be changing the other's mind.  I actually think that we might agree that Winnipeg bus drivers are terrible drivers who switch lanes when it is not safe to do so.  The difference appears to be that you think that they are more important than other vehicles on the road that that entitles them to drive the way they do.  I also don't think that they are much worse than cab drivers.  The difference being that cabs are much much smaller and cause much much less damage in an accident."

Winnipeg,3damol,noexistence,4,Wed Jul 15 02:29:52 2015 UTC,The Winnipeg Free Press and its paywall has become irrelevant to everyone except those with ink on their hands.
Winnipeg,3damol,204in403,3,Tue Jul 14 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"It's showing just fine for me, here's the article.    IF you're a member of city council, you probably shouldn't make any dinner plans on Wednesday.  Opponents of Winnipeg's bike-and-pedestrian strategy intend to bring dozens of amendments to the 20-year plan to city hall Wednesday, when council gathers for the final meeting before the six-week summer break.  The July meeting is often the longest of the year, as councillors attempt to deal with as many reports as possible before council is prorogued. In 2009, for example, council sat until 10:30 p.m.  A lengthy meeting is possible, if not a certainty, as Transcona Coun. Russ Wyatt intends to bring 15 or more amendments to the bike-and-pedestrian strategy four other councillors have panned for several weeks.  Mynarski Coun. Ross Eadie plans to bring 20 amendments of his own to council, after previously pledging only to bring them before tonight's Lord Selkirk-West Kildonan community meeting.  ""I don't know how else you're going to get change,"" Wyatt said Monday.  He intends to issue each amendment as a separate item before council. If city clerk Richard Kachur allows the filibuster-like manoeuvre, council could wind up making a series of votes about the strategy instead of a single vote.  It is unlikely, however, there will be separate debates about each amendment, as council tends to discuss all matters pertaining to a report just once. But if each member of council speaks for her or his allotted 10 minutes, the bike-and-pedestrian debate alone will take the better part of three hours.  Wyatt said he would rather see Mayor Brian Bowman agree to lay over the report until the fall to allow changes to be made to the document. Wyatt said he asked Bowman to do so at a meeting between the two on Friday.  ""The mayor is requesting we adopt policy, so it has to be done right at the outset,"" Wyatt said. ""I'm hoping amendments will be approved.""  Wyatt and Eadie are among five city councillors who've spent weeks criticizing the strategy, which advocates spending $334 million over 20 years on active transportation.  That amounts to $16.7 million a year. The city currently spends $2.4 million on bike paths, sidewalks and walking trails each year.  Couns. Eadie, Wyatt, Jeff Browaty (North Kildonan), Shawn Dobson (St. Charles) and Jason Schreyer (Elmwood-East Kildonan) took out radio ads decrying the plan, which they describe as flawed, imprecise and financially irresponsible.  Bowman called the radio ads fear-mongering and said the bike-and-pedestrian strategy is not set in stone.  Supporters of the strategy did not seem perturbed by the prospect of a lengthy council meeting.  ""I'm happy to have a long discussion about active transportation. It doesn't concern me at all,"" said Fort Rouge-East Fort Garry Coun. Jenny Gerbasi.  Also Monday, Eadie held a news conference to reiterate his opposition to the cycling plan. He wound up in a 30-minute debate with two cycling activists who live in his ward."

My sister had a birthday of hers at a pool ages ago and they gave us a rather large room to eat/put all of our stuff in, and then all the kids buggered off to go swimming.  If you want to do a hotel, try calling The Viscount Gort. They do birthday party packages where you get one of their meeting rooms, they put out tables with cutlery and paper cups and napkins, and provide kids meals (hot dog and fries and/or chicken fingers and fries).

If it's the compressor, it's probably best to replace it.  if you can find a used one, it might be the simplest as you might have to re pipe with 410 which can be a pain depending on the routing.  The coils, as long as you stick with the same tonnage, are usually just an orifice change.      That being said, it might be only slightly more expensive to just have it all redone."

Segregation does not work and people seem to be inadvertently trying to bring it back.  ""This is for us, not you.""   Yeeaah...we may as well get those swatches or whatever from a paint store and when you show up for a festival, we match you with your colour and send you into that line and if you're doing or wearing anything that shows something that your visible race hasn't come up with, you're kicked out.    This is not the way.  I absolutely agree with you.  Born of a treaty mother, I see nothing wrong with anyone celebrating the beauty of my culture.  This is my blood and I am proud and overjoyed that others enjoy it.  No, I don't hold every belief the native culture has, but I do still find it absolutely beautiful and love when other people see that as well."

Winnipeg,3d2lcu,noexistence,-3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:26 2015 UTC,Ya but you can't wear it around other people that it's culturally appropriate.  The person wearing the headdress wasn't with aboriginal people.  Would you feel it was appropriate to just wear around town?  Or would you only feel comfortable wearing it with your coworkers or going to temple with them?

If someone finds it fashionably acceptable, I'm in no position to say they're wrong. How many native articles of clothing are in mainstream fashion these days? I don't particularly like someone wearing a headdress or turban if they're not of the culture it came from but doesn't freedom allow for someone to wear either, if they so choose?"
Winnipeg,3d2lcu,noexistence,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:31:12 2015 UTC,"But the question isn't native articles of clothing, it's the cultural significance of the headdress.  You won't find aboriginal run stores selling native clothing selling headdresses.    But I do find one thing you said interesting, so you say you are in no position to say if something is right or wrong, but what if someone from that culture says it's inappropriate?  It was an aboriginal woman that first brought this to the person's attention, explained it was inappropriate (I have no idea if it was civilly or not) but the person ignored them.  I would think an aboriginal person would be in a position to say if it was inappropriate or not.  Really I'm not taking about taking away rights, which is where I think we are having a miscommunication.  I'm talking about what is and isn't appropriate.  People can wear the headdress like they can wear black face or an SS uniform, but is it appropriate (forgive my extreme examples, I'm not trying to enact Godwin's Law with them)? I don't think it's appropriate to wear a headdress unless it is part of your culture and it's culturally appropriate (because traditionally aboriginal woman can not wear the headdress either).  That's all I'm getting at.  Even now there are a number of news articles talking about how it's inappropriate to wear a headdress, a number of specifically mentioning music festivals (I guess they have become trendy at them?)"
Winnipeg,3d2lcu,jimmyrustler204,17,Mon Jul 13 19:43:59 2015 UTC,twitter class in an uproar. SJWs on the march.  perhaps the person wearing the headdress identified with indigenous culture and suffers from racial identity dysphoria. These people harassing her about it are just insensitive assholes.

Even then these symbols can be used inappropriately, you do not have to earn them to have them.  If I bought a cross no one would bat an eye unless I was preaching satanism.

I'm entitled to my beliefs as much as you are yours as much as this much maligned poor girl is hers.   When this came up at Halloween, I thought the guy from Gags Unlimited had an interesting point. If wearing a headdress is disrespectful of FN culture, then isn't wearing a business suit disrespectful of Anglo Saxxon culture? There's really not much argument where the suit and tie culture came from, there's plenty of people in the world that take their suiting extremely seriously and adorn themselves with ornate clothing and baubles in a similar vein to a headdress. Is there a threshold on how serious something needs to be before being offended is acceptable? Is it a time limit thing? I'm quite curious as to who gets to decide what's respectful and what's not. Is there a secret panel somewhere or is it left up to the tweeting class?"

Wearing Black Face offends people.  Wearing a Medal of Military Valour you did not earn offends people.  Wearing a Headdress offends people.  Yet someone only one of these is something you won't do, even though you already said ""No one has the right to not be offended"".  Interesting.  I did search why it's appropriate to wear a headdress but all I can find is reason why it's inappropriate.

I just support banning it because I think it's inappropriate and I gave reasons as to why I feel it is inappropriate.  People can choose to say we shouldn't ban it for whatever their reasons are.  Anyways I think you get where I'm coming from because you wouldn't wear the Medal in the first place.

That's what I'm speaking against. It's one thing to have your own personal opinion about something, but quite another to ask the hundreds of thousands of people who attend Folk Fest to not wear something just because you personally find it offensive. The majority of people there didn't find it offensive at all, or didn't find it offensive enough to complain, so why should the festival have to step in? I think you understand what I'm getting at."
Winnipeg,3d2lcu,noexistence,3,Mon Jul 13 17:31:50 2015 UTC,"And if the festival chooses to ban them (like other festivals have for the same reason), then that is the festivals choice.

Winnipeg,3d2lcu,Frozesolid,6,Tue Jul 14 00:28:45 2015 UTC,"Who's proving that Winnipeg is the most racist city?   Is it that ignorant twitter poster who claims wearing a head dress is racist?  Should we take a look at the definition of racism?  Racism: the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.  How is a girl who finds part of my culture beautiful, a racist act?   Did she have a pin on it that said, ""Fuck these lazy, drunk, money-leeching indians.  I hate all of them.""   Did she have a ""Let's  burn all the tipis"" t-shirt on?  People need to stop dropping the ""omg that person is a racist!"" bomb when there's no racism to be seen.  Or maybe the commenter's in this post are the racist ones for thinking that this isn't that big of a deal and the people, not all natives, but the specific, ridiculously simple-minded, people of any colour who are getting butt-hurt and finding offence in a woman celebrating a part of my culture that she sees as beautiful, are just a bunch of people we don't need around.  If that was a confusing sentence, what I'm saying is that maybe I missed the comments here that are hating on natives specifically, because it seems to me that it's not the colour of their skin being brought up, but the words they are saying.  Whether you're black, white, purple, or green, ignorance shines through the same.  As a native, when I see a non-aboriginal with a dreamcatcher tattoo, or dream-catchers in their house, or building a Tipi for their kids, or wearing a head-dress to a music festival, it only makes me smile.  It makes me proud to be from such a beautiful culture and that people still remember it and find joy in aspects of the culture I have come from.  I absolutely love seeing my culture being enjoyed.  A couple keyboard warriors on twitter and SJW's or whatever the fuck who always seem to have to find ""This week's reason to have a stick up my ass,"" does not count as the position of all natives.  I have a huge family.  I literally have hundreds of cousins.  One of my aunts died at 94 with over 180+ grandkids, great-grandkids, and great-great grandkids.  And that's just one aunt.   I can't think of very many people in my family who would be offended by or think it's remotely racist for a white girl wearing a head dress."

Winnipeg,3d2lcu,Frozesolid,2,Mon Jul 13 15:03:59 2015 UTC,"I did see that comment now where a guy's saying ""indian's are race bullies"" now.  Which I guess would be racist, but to me it's just ignorance, and racism does stem directly from ignorance.  Still, one ignorant comment that actually sounds racist does not prove that Winnipeg is the most racist city in Canada.  It shows that less than 1% of the people who have commented are racist or hold views on current situations that he's expressing in a racist manner due to ignorance.  I'm not agreeing that natives are ""race bullies,"" but as a white indian, I have been subject to far more racism from my fellow aboriginals than any other race.  So I can see why someone would say that, but it's obvious to me that they don't have an understanding of where that grudge came from and why native people are still in pain today from past racism showed to them that still lingers through some people.  My family has abuse of every kind running rampant; be it substance abuse, physical abuse, or sexual abuse.  It is absolutely awful.  But there is a reason for all of that.  Those who see this abuse and attribute it to the fact that someone is native, and not because they are from a people who have been treated poorly, to say the least, for a real long time are very short sighted and need to do some research and for suggesting that you are completely without merit, I apologize.    I'm not trying to say racism doesn't exist in Winnipeg and I'm not trying to dispute that Winnipeg may be the most racist city in Canada, I don't hold the true facts and I cannot be certain about that stance, but I do know that this post does nothing to prove that Macleans article correct.  Furthermore, that Macleans article did nothing to promote wellness in the human culture and did everything to further segregation of humans.  It made hate more visible and created anger within people which creates, albeit inadvertently, more racism and more hate.    That Macleans article is someone either trying to promote racist in a conspiracy theory kind of way, or was done by someone of ignorance, that thought they were helping by pointing something out (and maybe given time, we will see it come around and lessen racism) but ended up creating more tension between cultures and so far has done little to help any real problems."

Winnipeg,3d5o64,SlopBasket,24,Mon Jul 13 19:02:05 2015 UTC,Does the bike path cross side streets that the road has the right of way of? Sometimes the bike are pretty much fancy sidewalks where you have to stop at every single road that you wouldn't have to in a car.   Most of the bike routes like the ones you speak of aren't put in for commuting they're put in for recreation they wind and loop and go all over the place.  I was listening to Russ Wyatt on the radio saying why would we build another path on at Henderson they both end up at the same place it's just an extra 16 blocks of biking to get to the same place.   Some people can't grasp that if you're commuting by bike it's not about getting there in your nice leisurely pace you want to get there as fast as possible. It's not like you ended up on grant because you wanted to take the longest route with the least amount of traffic you took the most direct route.   Share the road and quit being a twat. Maybe get out and walk or bike a bit and release some of your rage. Your driving doesn't seem to be good for your mental health.
Winnipeg,3d5o64,b3hr,3,Mon Jul 13 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"As i understand it the point of dedicated bike lanes (not just bike paths) is to encourage more people to commute by bike. I think that it's safe to argue that OP is describing a bike lane designed to be used for commuting and not a bike path used for recreational purposes.  I've seen this happen on Pembina as well, which has a dedicated bike lane.   Now for sake of argument, we can assume that bike lanes (not paths) constructed on major arteries (like Grant and Pembina) are largely designed for commuting and not purely receeational use.   We can then conclude two things: bike lanes on these routes are not designed for communters, which goes against one of the main mandates of active transportation OR that they are so poorly designed and constructed that they don't facilitate their intended use, and cyclists end up using the roads anyways."
Winnipeg,3d5o64,SophistXIII,13,Mon Jul 13 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"The lane OP is describing is the rec path beside grant that meanders through the forest. It is not a commuter path, it is a ""ride bikes with grandma to get icecream"" path. It is also particularly cracked and bumpy   that they are so poorly designed and constructed that they don't facilitate their intended use, and cyclists end up using the roads anyways.   this is 100% true of all of the ""active transportation paths"" the city has put down. Commuting by bike at 25-30kph does not and will never mix with absent minded joggers and baby strollers. I just dont think the city has been able to comprehend up until very recently that bikes can actually go kind of fast."
Winnipeg,3d5o64,brendax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:11:43 2015 UTC,Commuting by bike at 25-30kph does not and will never mix with absent minded joggers and baby strollers.   Nor will it mix well with impatient drivers.

(As long as you don't split the lane to pass me on the right at a stop light so I have to go around you again...  :)  )  It's the idiots riding high in the seat, in the left-hand side of the lane, going 10kph down Pembina at rush hour (and passing me at red lights) that make me want to accidentally knock them off a bridge."
Winnipeg,3d5o64,bgrnbrg,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"Impatience is not any sort of thing to protect or cater to.

Winnipeg,3d5o64,thefirstfirelizard,6,Mon Jul 13 19:25:37 2015 UTC,I am always bemused by cyclists going over the QE II bridge (between Marion and Stradbrook) on the road side instead of in the very nice protected bike corridor. It's not actually inconvenient to motorists because there is plenty of room on the road side but the bike lane is so much better. I just don't get it.
Winnipeg,3d5o64,brendax,11,Mon Jul 13 21:36:10 2015 UTC,It's probably because that corridor is impossible to use legally as it dumps you onto a sidewalk on both sides.  Also I want to turn left.
Winnipeg,3d5o64,thefirstfirelizard,-1,Mon Jul 13 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, makes sense. I guess technically you would have to dismount for the few yards of sidewalk you need to cross.  I mostly use the sidewalk (BMX; no way I'm risking my ass in traffic, not worth it) so some things that affect road bikers elude my notice."
Winnipeg,3d5o64,sauze,3,Tue Jul 14 03:42:03 2015 UTC,"My issue on that bridge is I always want to go down Marion and so if I use the bridge path it's getting off the bike, waiting for two sets of lights."

Winnipeg,3d5o64,salapeno,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:02:29 2015 UTC,The problem with bike helmets is that no one can figure out if they actually help and there is some evidence that they might hurt ... at least for adults.

Also I super enjoy being alive and active.   So I lump helmets in with seatbelts, for myself, and will for any children I have."
Winnipeg,3d5o64,assholemcnigger,-2,Tue Jul 14 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I've never thought of seatbelts as uncomfortable but I can see how they could be to some people. But that only affects a small subset of the total people who use a car, whereas helmets are uncomfortable and inconvenient to anyone who uses a bike.   There's a lot of evidence that seatbelts save lives, but there is no consensus as to whether helmets do the same or if they actually decrease safety, so to make it mandatory is a really drastic step. Other places that have introduced mandatory helmet laws have seen a drop in cycling rates of up to a third, with no measurable improvement to safety. I'm all for wearing helmets, but it really shouldn't be a legal requirement.   Thinking in terms of people's responsibility to society and reducing bills on the tax payer etc, it would be much better to get more people cycling and less people driving, so as to reduce road deaths, reduce pollution, improve the health of the population etc, which are all massive costs to society, rather than enforce a rule that does the opposite of that."

He has a cute sign on the back that says something like ""Don't worry, it's just a little six-cylinder.""  I want to know where one finds a six-cylinder diesel."
Winnipeg,3czc89,cmperry51,3,Sun Jul 12 16:38:07 2015 UTC,I want to know where one finds a six-cylinder diesel.   Six cylinders are the most common diesel engine configuration.   The Cummins in the Dodge trucks are inline 6 cylinders.  The German diesels are either 4 or 6 cylinders.   In fact the vast majority of semi trucks are inline 6 cylinder engines as well.

Winnipeg,3czc89,cmperry51,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yep steam engines are much too inefficient.  I think GM and Ford are the only 2 to put a v8 diesel in their trucks.  Dodge does have a 1/2 ton with a 3L V6 (VM Motori) engine in it.  Lots of reports of 30+ MPG.  Dodge can't seem to make enough of them so there is a shortage of them, plus dealers are asking a premium for them.   I don't know why the other half ton manufacturers haven't followed suit. I sure wish they would."

Winnipeg,3cys5p,takaji10,3,Sun Jul 12 11:12:14 2015 UTC,"You certainly can use an IR filter like an IR720 or R72 filter to achieve a similar effect.  Though you are limited to having to setup your scene focus it, lock it off on a tripod and you have to use a long shutter speed of several seconds in bright sunlight to pull it off so you loose sharpness as trees and things become blurry if they are blowing around in the wind.  I converted a spare DSLR body to permanently shoot IR so I can shoot like a regular camera.  Here is where I got my camera converted > http://www.lifepixel.com"
Winnipeg,3cys5p,takaji10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips!  I once bought a cheap IR filter off Dealextreme, but when I used it with an exposure of a few seconds, the image was just tinted purple. Wondering if it's because it's a cheap filter or something else.   I don't have the spare cash to do the DSLR body conversion, but I might be able to afford a proper filter!"
Winnipeg,3cys5p,takaji10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:22:48 2015 UTC,"I've tried those cheap china IR720 filters when I first began IR photography but they were just terrible in terms of sharpness, color and quality.  Everything should be a reddish tone but that's because of the filter.  Now you must shoot RAW and enhance the exposure, color and contrast afterwards in Photoshop or Lightroom.  It also helps if you use a custom white balance, just shoot a properly exposed picture of the grass (or something green and leafy that fills the entire frame) with the filter on and set the camera to ""Custom White Balance"" before going on your shoot.  Not sure if the Rebel XS supports custom WB.  Either way, consider a Hoya R72 instead and read up on some tips and tricks of IR photography without a converted camera.  It's definitely more challenging doing it that way!"

Winnipeg,3d0rqf,germ77,6,Sun Jul 12 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"Here's how it works. You pay extra money and the homeowner puts that extra money away for you. If you miss even one payment, the contract is broken and you lose the money.  The only - and I mean only - benefit of this arrangement is you decide on the house price before you pay. That means, if housing prices go up, the price of the house stays the same.  Of course, the housing market is more balanced now. So, rent a place, and that extra money you were gonna give the rent-to-own landlord? You put it away in a GIC or something that is accessible, but not all that accessible. That way, when you have to miss a rent payment because of a catastrophe OH HEY LOOK THERE'S MONEY IF I NEED IT AND I DON'T GET EVICTED AND I DON'T LOSE ALL MY MONEY!!!!!  Seriously, don't do it.

I know there is very little regulation in the rent-to-own market, and many if not most people who start one don't end up owning it.

As long as the articles are tagged with something like [WFP-PAYWALL] it's all good, and the onus is on the user for clicking the link.   Maybe add some filters so users can block the links with that tag, I know other subs have a similar system.   However, if the free press gets prickly about people copy pasting the content, which is understandable, then there's no point and they should be blocked."
Winnipeg,3cxopv,tmlrule,12,Sat Jul 11 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have to argue that I'm uncomfortable with the posting of paywalled articles in the comments.  Everyone on Reddit gets super prickly whenever any original comment gets ripped off and posted elsewhere, why is it okay to do the opposite?   Not to mention, in the original discussions about the paywall, the consensus seemed to be that people thought the WFP didn't offer enough good content to justify the price, and other sources were just as good. Once again, if that's the case, let's back it up and support those other sources with links."

The pay per article option means that a mis-click or a url shortener (that we may have missed on our blacklist) could be used to incur a charge on a user's credit card. While they could go get a refund, that places the onus on them and mean's they lost some money coming to a place where that hasn't happened before. That's not an experience I want any user to potentially have."

Winnipeg,3cxopv,EnigmaticTortoise,7,Sat Jul 11 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"I still feel that they have the right to do what they want with the content they produce, but that the subscription model has some costs itself. For example, jeopardizing it's exposure on social media sites like this one. 8000 people maybe isn't a lot...but maybe it is.  IIRC there are some tools somewhere to bypass the login, but I'm unsure about the paywall. In general, I don't want to jeopardize the future of the subreddit by inviting admin scrutiny over posting potentially illegal content."
Winnipeg,3cxopv,majikmonkie,2,Sat Jul 11 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Plenty of sites use archivers and/or screenshots of websites (/r/kotakuinaction comes to mind), and the Admins have never said anything about it."

Wether it's ultimately up to the admins or not, I don't think it's right allow it.  While I don't like it agree with their method (paywall) I respect that they own and pay for the production of the content and it's ultimately hurting their business by allowing it.

Winnipeg,3cxopv,greyfoxv1,2,Sat Jul 11 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"If we expect discourse to adhere to a certain level of quality, I think we need to have the minimum expectation that we're all able to read the referenced material. Embracing paid-exclusive content clearly disallows members from participating in particular discussions.  The real question then becomes: Is it better to allow for an exclusive conversation on a topic, or have no conversation at all?"
Winnipeg,3cxopv,_Benedek_,0,Sat Jul 11 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"Excellent point!  What are we to say to this? Again, the problem resides in the implicit qualifications that can be easily discerned by the concrete analysis of the concrete situation, as the WFP  would have put it. Fidelity to the democratic consensus means the acceptance of the present liberal parliamentary consensus, which precludes any serious questioning of how this liberal-democratic order is complicit in the phenomena it officially condemns and, of course, any serious attempt to imagine a society whose sociopolitical order would be different. In short, it means say and write whatever you want on the condition that what you do does not effectively question or disturb the predominant political consensus. So everything is allowed, solicited even, as a critical topic: the prospects of a global ecological catastrophy, violations of human rights, sexism, homophobia, antifeminism, growing violence not only in faraway countries but also in our megalopolises, the gap between the First and the Third World, between the rich and the poor, the shattering impact of the digitalization of our daily lives, and so on. There is nothing easier today than to get international, state, or corporate funds for multidisciplinary research into how to fight the new forms of ethnic, religious, or sexist violence. The problem is that all this occurs against the background of a fundamental WFP paywall, a prohibition against thinking. Today's liberal-democratic hegemony is sustained by a kind of unwritten WFP paywall similar to the infamous Berufsverbot in Germany of the late sixties; the moment one shows a minimal sign of engaging in political projects that aim to seriously challenge the existing order, the answer is immediately: ""Benevolent as it is, this will necessarily end in a new gulag!"" And it is exactly the same thing that the demand for scientific objectivity means; the moment one seriously questions the existing liberal consensus, one is accused of abandoning scientific objectivity for the outdated ideological positions. This is the point that one cannot and should not concede: today, actual freedom of thought must mean the freedom to question the predominant liberal-democratic post-ideological consensus-or it means nothing.  The solution, of course, is obvious."
Winnipeg,3cxopv,stazy,2,Mon Jul 13 20:17:03 2015 UTC,I figured I'd re-frame the question in a way others may not have considered; You're welcome to address where my attempt failed. I certainly have no problem telling you that bad satire doesn't magically get better by making it longer.

Since then I've had a change of heart and get by without even looking at their ""front page"".  They're off my favs list and life goes on.  With that said, let the links stand as-is and people can choose."
Winnipeg,3cxopv,DerrickD26,2,Sat Jul 11 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"So the key question here is: do we want to filter out pay walled services?  Short answer: No. More and more services are turning to paywalls because people are cheap and they need to make money to keep producing good content. The WFP isn't perfect but it produces good content so I don't think we should make that choice for everyone who browses this sub.   Long answer: The WFP is one of the last outlets in Manitoba to do investigative journalism and they've been putting out some good work lately. They don't post the click/link bait we're all against so they definitely deserve credit for holding a higher stander than other online news outlets. By filtering out the WFP from our sub we're only going to hurt them, even if in a small way, so I'd rather not penalize journalists who are doing some good just because a few people want good things for free. I don't think it's our job to filter good content from other users. If a user doesn't want to pay they can choose not to by reading attention the paywall tag."

I still want to see what the workday crowd has to say come Monday, but it's pretty clear that the userbase, thus far at least, prefers a non-interventionist policy anyways. I'm more than happy to leave it be."
Winnipeg,3cxopv,DerrickD26,2,Sun Jul 12 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"It's fine if they're doing good work, but the problem is that the sub has a bunch of links to stuff most of us can't actually read and that makes the sub itself less useful, except as a promotional tool to try and convince us to pay for the WFP.  If /r/winnipeg filled up with a bunch of links to Amazon Prime videos, even though Amazon Prime has been putting out some good work and even though it's not our job to filter them out, would it be good for the sub? There is a small subset of /r/winnipeg users who might actually have a VPN that lets them watch that stuff, but those links are useless to everybody else."
Winnipeg,3cxopv,kochier,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:00 2015 UTC,I don't buy those arguments because:  -This isn't Amazon. It's journalism.  -It's not promotional since it's not given advantageous treatment.  -People are posting the text anyway and that'll likely continue until the mod team receives information indicating it's not acceptable.  -It's 27 cents.
Winnipeg,3cxopv,wickedplayer494,2,Mon Jul 13 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"The journalism on the WFP is a product being sold online just like a documentary on Amazon Prime.   It is promotional because when you click on something, it leads you directly to a place where you can pay to see it. There's no link to something getting advantage  People posting the text of something you're supposed to pay for is IP theft and not relevant. I don't want to pay for a WFP subscription, but I certainly don't want to fucking steal Bartley's work instead.  27 cents isn't the point. There's stuff on Amazon Prime that's free.

There is nothing wrong with the free press wanting to charge.  Someone may not want to pay, but that's not a reason to ban WFP articles.  I would also oppose allowing text copies of the article.  That would be no different than pirating music.  People do it, but that doesn't make it right."

In no particular order: • July 25 - Folklorama Festival Kick Off Winnipeg has a ton of different cultures and we like to celebrate that. Folklorama is a chance for these different cultures to share their unique cuisines, dances, and culture. This is the kick off and it is located at The Forks, which is where the Assiniboine River and Red River meets. • July 26 - Salsa Night at The Forks Speaking of The Forks, they have Salsa nights on Sundays. • The Manitoba Museum An awesome museum that has a number of different galleries including history of Hudson's Bay Company, Metis hunters, buncha others plus a dope planetarium and science gallery. • July 23 - West End Food Tour If you're a bit of a foodie there's a tour of some west end restaurants on July 23. I've only been to Cafe Ce Soir and it was really good.   There's also a really good New Visitors guide put out by Tourism Winnipeg."

Winnipeg,3d1nlj,bigpipes84,2,Sun Jul 12 21:21:24 2015 UTC,"My most hated thing people always do is take like 5 blocks to go from 0km/h to 40km/h and stay there when the actual speed limit is 60km/h, it's +30C, there isn't a single cloud in the sky, and it hasn't rained in weeks.  Or police officers that go 30km/h.  I think they're just trolling, and it's pretty hilarious how people react.  Often times they'll form a wall of traffic because everyone is too chicken shit to go the actual speed limit passed the police vehicle."
Winnipeg,3d1nlj,MSevenG,3,Sun Jul 12 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"The wall of traffic happens all the time regardless of whether it's a police car. There's a LOT of drivers out there who just go the same speed of the vehicle beside them and never glance down to see if it's even close to the speed limit. This happens every fucking day. Person A decides to go 50 in an 80 zone and Person B in the lane beside them matches their speed and hangs just on the side of the other car's rear corner so as to form a rolling roadblock and allow no one to pass.  The worst is when you get one of these stupid fucks on your rear corner when you need to get over into the other lane. I'll start slowing down to let them pass so I can make the lane change and they start slowing at the same pace I do. This results in me having to either slam on the brakes to force them by, or mash the gas to get ahead of them and then be forced to cut them off and get on the brakes to make my turn."
Winnipeg,3d1nlj,minivan-megafun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:38:03 2015 UTC,One thing I've seen out here is police officers turning on their lights to go thru a red light and turning them off and carrying on their way after. I've seen it 7 times now.  And I don't understand why people think it's OK to just poke along in the left lane. I've lost count of the number of times I've laid on my horn and passed someone on the right who was going way too slow under the speed limit.  Keep right except to pass...not a difficult concept.
Winnipeg,3d1nlj,bigpipes84,-4,Sun Jul 12 23:38:52 2015 UTC,You should see how some people act with lights and sirens behind them!

I'd be near the front of the pack, hoping that people would go fast enough that I could make it through Kenaston/Waverley...only for some jackass to crawl through the intersection and hold everyone up, like he's scared his gas pedal is going to give him leg cancer. Then I'd be stuck waiting a million years at the red light.  Then I would proceed down onto 3 and catch up to the dick doing 75 while the limit is 100. You can't win with these people."

How about when the kid acts out and smashes the caregivers house up CFS does nothing except take the kid away to a group home... For two days...

Winnipeg,3cx1rd,Randformula,-5,Sat Jul 11 19:41:06 2015 UTC,Actually today I havent been there yet. I am going in a few hours. However the lead up to today has been surprisingly open. No lines and plenty of places to set up your beach stuff. The water was wonderful yesterday though. Super cold despite the heat.  It looks like they expanded the beach to twice its previous size so people are so spread out its not crowded at all.
Winnipeg,3cx1rd,Randformula,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"I love Birds Hill, go almost every weekend. I was just told that it would be a gong show due to the festival, but I didn't think the two had anything to do with each other. And really, I am not one to care about people having fun, I may not be a teenager anymore, but i enjoy a good toke and drink more than I ever have."
Winnipeg,3cx1rd,tootsmagoo,2,Sat Jul 11 19:46:41 2015 UTC,"The thing is the beach is about a twenty minute walk from the festival camp ground. So all the drinking and toking are being done there, rather than the beach. I mean Ive been here all week and I have spent an inordinate time at the beach and havent seen anything gross or whatever.  I dunno.  I mean Im not seeing the shit people are describing. I think people are just here to have fun. Im sure there are bad eggs out there, but clearly they arent at the beach."

Winnipeg,3cx1rd,mrmeow75,2,Sat Jul 11 22:50:26 2015 UTC,They aren't doing that at the beach and if they are they shouldn't be. The campground is a half hour walk from the beach. I've seen no overlap.

Winnipeg,3cx1rd,NeechieChief,2,Sat Jul 11 19:07:52 2015 UTC,Lol sorry. It bothers me because people here seem so cranky over folk fest and portray it as something awful. Sure there are people in the camp ground letting a bit loose but it's a closed off area. The beach and actual festival grounds are very clean and nice.

Winnipeg,3cxd1s,midnight-_samuri,2,Sat Jul 11 17:15:19 2015 UTC,If price isn't the issue then don't do all you can eat. That is marketing towards cheap people who just want to stuff their gullets. Just go to the best sushi place and keep ordering dishes. I promise they won't cut you off.

They have so much selection. Rolls are hit and miss, so beware.  Igi BBQ and Sushi on Pembina. On weekends they have red tuna, halibut, and sweet shrimp sashimi. Their quality is always fresh and the service is great. There's also the novelty of grilling your own food.   I'd avoid Sushi Gen/Sushi Jet/Magic Sushi and Wok/Miso/Mooshiro. All low quality and charge a ridiculous amount for what you get. I believe Sushi Gen and Sushi Jet charge 10% gratuity like IGI does, except their service sucks. And Miso + Mooshiro are owned by the same group of people. I have a friend who used to work there and she told me a lot of stuff is just store bought crap they deep fry.

Winnipeg,3cw8zx,TBwpg,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"Okay so here's my story. I had three tickets at one single pull over. Because of that, I was entitled to a Responsible Driver Course. Although it sounds like a riot, it really was. The instructor asked basic questions about driving practices for the first 10 minutes to make sure no one was a dumbass that didn't know the laws, and once he got those bases covered it was fucking awesome. For the duration of the class, we literally just shared stories about being pulled over, run ins with police officers, any law experiences we had. The fun stories, stuff you brag about.   For example, a guy in the class that I was in told a story where he was driving down highway 1, and a cop pulled up next to him and then gave him the hand motion to roll down his window. I guess because the cop saw it was a new vehicle (and really souped up), the cop said ""I know you were speeding back there, I radared you at 20km over"". This guy said ""Aw come on man I just bought the car and got it insured, I don't need a ticket too. How about if I beat you to the next set of lights I don't take a ticket, but if you win, I'll take 2. 1 for speeding and the other for the racing (reckless driving)"". They raced, he waxed the fuck out of the cop, and that was the end of that. Cop didn't pull him over. He was in for something other than that however.  Basically it's like AA for drivers. But (my class at least) it's truly fun. I would go again."

Winnipeg,3cu10a,wpgken,26,Sat Jul 11 00:08:27 2015 UTC,"I live in Waverly West. I like it a lot. People are willing to pay a little more for homes here because it is the only place to buy new houses in the SW quadrant of the city which is also the hottest real estate area in the city. The prices are perhaps slightly more than elsewhere in the city buy not out of line with what the community does/will offer.  Not all houses here are that expensive either. When we bought ours we could have bought a detached home with land for just over $300K. For comparison I sold my 50 year old, 3 bed, one bath, no garage house in Ft. Richmond for more than that.  Design. Waverly west is the only new area in the city that demands that all garages are set back into the house. This means that when you drive down a street you see more than a line of garages. It's pretty nice.  A walkable community. This area has the best bike paths I've ever seen. I can literally bike from my yard to work 6 kms away and never have to ride on a surface street. When Bridgwater Centre is built out I will have everything I need (dentist, groceries, restaurants, entertainment, doctor, etc) within a few minutes walk. One of the new Save on Foods will be built here next year. I'm looking forward to being able to walk there.  Diversity. What we have are families (mostly) from all over the world plus existing Winnipeggers becoming new residents here all at once. That means that everyone is forced to meet the neighbours because we're all new. It also means that my young son has access to far more playmates and ethnic variery. It's great.  We also have a great mix of homes here. Like I mentioned before, you could buy a new house for as little as $300k but the prices step up to well over a million. This makes for a neighbourhood with diverse families and a wide variety of housing.  About the dump. I've smelled it a couple times since I moved here. I think the smell most people are concerned with is the poor management of the compost over at Samborki. It was terrible but I haven't smelled that in a while. I think they got raided/shut down. The more houses that are built and the more trees that are planted the less the wind blows smells around.  A leap of faith. We bought our home when there wasn't much here but dirt. It was hard to buy into something I could not see. I can understand how someone who doesn't live here can look around at the construction mess and not see how things will get better. They have continued to get better as I  live here and announcements like the Save On foods only make things even better."

Winnipeg,3cu4j0,WpgTroglodyte,16,Fri Jul 10 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"It is largely the same thing, just not the same thing you think it is.  In 1985 it was due to a still flat economy after a recession and restarting the $1.4 Billion Limestone Project.    In 1985 the rating was an AA3 and went down to A1.  It went back up one notch to AA3 at the end of the Filmon years in 1998. But then went up twice more under the NDP.   So even with the downgrade it will still be a higher rating than when the PC's were in.  The overall economy and large spending on infrasructure and mega-projects has way more to do with it than whichever party is in charge."
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,Good_Day_Eh,-5,Fri Jul 10 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing. I'm saying when the NDP is the steward of the public purse long term, there's complete disregard for public spending. And that's mentioned as the reason for the recent downgrade. I don't think that comes as any surprise to anybody. If you continue to dig yourself into debt with no eye towards the future, eventually your ability to repay becomes questionable. Especially when debt rating agencies start stress testing your revenue streams.  EDIT: Having to manage yourself out of a hole is infinitely more difficult than managing yourself into one. The idea the the NDP have created these credit ratings is simply completely without merit. They managed to take good economic environments and destroy them. The fact that the PCs had to come behind and clean up the mess means that holding a rating steady is more impressive than watching revenues flow during low interest rate environments. Today's situation is remarkably similar. When times are good, the citizens want infinite spending. When the punch bowl is taken away, they demand responsible fiscal stewardship that doesn't come from NDP governments."

Remember when you were bragging about how much the credit rating agencies loved us because of our 'ability to pay'?  Just gonna leave a couple of your choice quotes for you and everybody else to see:   I know it's hard to take that the NDP are better financial managers than the PCs or the CTF, but that is the reality of the situation. I am sure there are other issues that the Tories can make some from.   That one's kinda funny given today's news.   Thing is, the NDP knows this and it's because of the investments that this government makes in infrastructure like highways is one of the reasons we are doing so well.   Huh. I guess the bond rating agencies claiming all that debt is kind of a bad investment means they haven't asked /u/RedditSadly his professional opinion on things. Weird.   I am aware the caution issued by Moody's. Still not a downgrade like the Filmon Team had.....at least twice.   Twice? That's weird, 'cause that never happened.   AND, it is the ability to pay that counts.   Yeah. Until you can't. Then your rating is downgraded. Like today.  My favorite one is how you claim there were two downgrades during the PC years when the only two downgrades in Manitoba history were both during NDP governments. Kinda like last week when you made all those claims about MTS' share price doubling on the same day when it took three years out from underneath government control.

Eliminate flood compensation for people who choose, or have chosen to build or buy properties, businesses or farms outside of already protected areas. Sell Manitoba Hydro and all of it's assets. Eliminate the $750 Manitoba Property tax Credit.  The City of Winnipeg should take care of it's own affairs. Shut down the Health Sciences Complex.   Move the Teaching, Cancer, research and other elements of the Health Sciences Centre to the UofM and expand in that area. Cut all transfers, grants and programs for the Social Services Industry.  Including the United Way, MaWaTiChiWadaYadda Centres, and the like. Privatize Corrections. Cut the remaining Civil Service by 50%. Implement a Means Test for all billable procedures, consultations, and use of any and all Health Services. Implement a $250 Medical User fee for each visit.

Winnipeg,3cu4j0,Arclite02,7,Fri Jul 10 21:23:47 2015 UTC,Taxes don't factor into the credit rating and our rating is still very high in the AA rating. Also if you read the article both Saskatchewan and Ontario were downgraded due to the debt load which has increased under the sagging economy.
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,greyfoxv1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, Saskatchewan was recently upgraded to AAA in September of 2014 with the analyst report citing a budget of 'fiscal discipline in a low oil price environment'.  Ontario was downgraded in 2012. In May Moody's issued a negative outlook, but that's not really that surprising given that Ontario still thinks it's reasonable to try and pit a unionized manufacturing workforce against low cost labour from right-to-work states and Asia.  Also, of course taxes factor into credit ratings. Credit ratings are a combination of willingness, capacity, and plans to pay. Taxation is the lion's share of the revenue stream for governments. As such, things like unemployment measure the capacity. If you increase taxes, you will increase your capacity so long as the agencies don't think you're increasing them to a point where you begin to cut into incentive.  Not sure where you're getting your facts."
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,WpgTroglodyte,5,Fri Jul 10 23:14:19 2015 UTC,The article previously said Saskatchewan so it looks like they removed that. The rest of what you said is interesting though so I'll keep reading on it.
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,greyfoxv1,0,Fri Jul 10 23:36:33 2015 UTC,And Sask also has 19 Crown Corps to plunder when times get tuff. Manitoba has 9.
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,tetrock84,2,Sun Jul 12 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"That's irrelevant. Moody's includes Crown Corps in their analysis. If you start shifting money off the books of one to balance something else in the budget, the net effect would be the same. You can't make debt disappear unless you misstate your financial position. That would be considered fraudulent."
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,WpgTroglodyte,0,Sun Jul 12 05:37:49 2015 UTC,Example. SASKTEL pays 500 million annualy in income taxes back to the public. MTS has payed once in the past ten years which  was 1.2 million in 2010 and they will not be paying more until 2020. That's only one of there 19 crown Corps.
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,tetrock84,2,Sun Jul 12 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see your source on this. SaskTel's taxable net income from 2014 was only $19M. There's no $500M tax bill on $19M in net income.  Also, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. In your first post you're insinuating that the Saskatchewan provincial government is 'plundering' crown corps to balance the budget (presumably). Now you're suggesting the opposite of that by implying that SaskTel properly accounts for all of its taxation revenue and pays it into the public purse.   I think you might be a little too focused on your ideology at this point."
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,WpgTroglodyte,0,Sun Jul 12 14:42:16 2015 UTC,http://economyatwork.ca/2015/05/25/a-cautionary-tale-of-two-telcos-one-publicly-owned-and-one-privatized/ . I was wrong it is 500 million in 5 years. That's 100 million a year. Now the benefits of Sasktel is that they will pay majority of there revenues back in taxes while having a mandate to have all there jobs in Sask. Instead of like MTS were a lot of there jobs are in southern Ontario. Here is a article stating they get 150 million just in royaltys from pot ash and that's before it has to pay taxes and there threating to take more in the future http://www.thestarphoenix.com/touch/story.html?id=10901081
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,tetrock84,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:22 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, you're ignoring the fact that within that figure are the dividends Sasktel pays which are far less than what MTS pays. For some reason, ""economyatwork.ca"", just decides they're going to call something ""dividends paid to province"" - a completely meaningless measure that ignores one is private and the other public - and compares two completely different figures.  A) MTS is far more profitable than Sasktel. Ergo, its dividends are much higher and those flow to shareholders, many of whom are Manitobans, and then are taxed at a higher rate than corporate income tax. It's convenient to leave this aside, but it's garbage analysis.  B) Sasktel's net income is $76.4M but it's actual taxable net income is only $19M. For a company bringing in well over a $1B in revenue, these numbers are terrible. And it's declined every year since 2010 except for a small YoY gain in 2011 even as its revenues increase.  C) ""Now the benefits of Sasktel is that they will pay majority of there revenues back in taxes"" - This isn't even close to true. The majority of Sasktel's revenues are plowed directly back into the company where they become mostly inefficient. For instance, SaskTel generated a 1.5% rate of return last year. MTS generated an 8.1% rate of return. I think it's clear which is a better company.  I don't even know what ""economyatwork.ca"" is. It's clear it's not that interested in facts. If you want to speak authoritatively on these matters, how about instead of googling some random leftist blogger who can't understand a set of financial statements, you set out to do your own research using the companies many public reports?  It's not research when somebody sets meaningless parameters and then fudges facts to suit their narrative. And I'm not even here to answer the question as to whether the privatization of MTS was a good or bad move; I'm just simply saying you very obviously don't know what you're talking about and you're quoting sources that fortify that belief."
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,WpgTroglodyte,0,Sun Jul 12 20:25:11 2015 UTC,The dividends from MTS go to foreign investors. Majority of the share holders are not Manitobian. And the few that are are pretty wealthy. Just saying.
Winnipeg,3cu4j0,tetrock84,0,Sun Jul 12 23:33:34 2015 UTC,"Taxes may not directly factor in, but the fact that they keep digging deeper and deeper, and deeper into our wallets yet STILL keep racking up debt over and above that?  Even if it doesn't matter to the rating agencies, it damn well matters to ME!    I'm sick and tired of keeping less and less of my paycheck, and getting very little in return out of this government."

Winnipeg,3cu4j0,greyfoxv1,2,Fri Jul 10 23:46:50 2015 UTC,"Manitoba is near the top. In exchange, we're near the bottom in per capita GDP (9th of 13 provinces and territories).

Using 2013 figures, We're last of all provinces that aren't maritime or territories by a significant margin, trailing even Saskatchewan by about 25% of their total. And this would explain why our GDP per capita is and has always been pretty poor. Part of the reason is that a not-insignificant proportion of our population isn't technically unemployed even though they don't work. They aren't classified as such because they aren't actively looking for work, but they're still part of our population base. And it's interesting because Manitobans are some of the most productive workers in the country, we're just a poor economy with a lot unproductive dead weight.

Here's what I mean: this morning I posted something targeted to Winnipeg-only (so only our Wpg-based fans would potentially see it. We have tens of thousands of Winnipeg fans.  Guess how many people have seen the post.  78 people.  Not a typo.  If we put money behind it, it will be viewed by more people.   This is true for all pages. Ever notice how you seem to miss posts from the pages you follow, or you don't see things at all until it's too late? This is why. Facebook wants money, and they get it by keeping eyeballs hostage - unless those few people who saw it initially like/comment/share a lot (that makes FB show it to more people).  Does it make sense for your business to put marketing dollars towards Facebook? Maybe, maybe not. If you're B2B, definitely not. If you're B2C, it's worth considering.

Winnipeg,3csltm,lisarae,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yes and No. When I was College I worked part-time for a large Global company and was a part of their online team. We took the companies secondary Facebook page from 250,000 Likes to 850,000 Likes in nine months with a zero dollar Facebook advertising budget. We never gave Facebook a dime for advertising or boosted posts.   If you constantly are putting money behind your posts and boosting them so ""people"" actually do see them your page and people who like it are probably not even necessarily interested in your product offering. Another reason why I put people in quotes is because so many of those accounts that are engaging with your boosted posts aren't even real people.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag"

Winnipeg,3csltm,GBTRU,3,Fri Jul 10 15:10:13 2015 UTC,Facebook isn't really needed. But just make sure that their name is googleable and comes up with the hours address and possibly a menu.
Winnipeg,3csltm,roughtimes,2,Fri Jul 10 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"3 things I found about social media from working with a firm that was actually recommended here on Reddit.  First, before you even start, you should have ideas for content. Nothing is worse than a blog/facebook page/twitter account/instagram account that has no activity. If you can't think of enough content just don't bother.  Second, are you sure your customers are looking these places for vendors? Coffee/Vending company, I really don't know...  Third, most social media companies can't even follow their own rules. When I was looking for a company to work with I joined 10 different email lists for ""social media experts"" in and around winnipeg. None of them really said ""I know what I'm doing"".  The company I ended up going with told me I should do little social media other than have a website with a bio of my main employees, previous projects and email sign-up. They actually told me I don't need all the extras because that wasn't where my market was getting info from. Perhaps you should think about if this where your market is, and it is where they are looking for your type of service."
Winnipeg,3csltm,jxadh95,2,Fri Jul 10 16:16:56 2015 UTC,This would be a great question for /r/marketing. Loads of experienced folks who can give you solid advice.
Winnipeg,3csltm,lisarae,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"At the very least it's a free place to post your location, contact information and provide a simple way for customers to get in touch with you. Most people only have experience with their own personal pages and assume that's how it works for business. Not so.  Direct your superiors to the stock chart for FB and point out the market cap of 245 billion. Ask them how a public company which charges nothing for a personal account is worth that much.  It baffles me that a business will spend hundreds of dollars on trash/recycle/bus images or billboards yet not bother dropping $10 on a simple post boost which you can target to a specific group."

Winnipeg,3csltm,sinistermigraine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a content strategy that provides value to your users then it is not worth your time.   Do not worry about getting a massive following as you have to ""pay to play"" on Facebook anyways now. There is value if you can integrate your brand into your Facebook and provide real value to people.   Think about ways you can post information about making good cups of coffee, differences in beans, etc. Something that your audience might actually care about.   You can incorporate pricing promotions into posts once in awhile as people do appreciate a good price and will be motivated to buy.   Social media marketing should be a part of the entire integrated marketing plan and should have a well thought out purpose and strategy. Just ""being on Facebook"" won't do shit for you - there needs to be a plan.   I use social media marketing for both a hobby project and a company that I am the Marketing Manager for.   I promote every post I send out so it actually goes somewhere. The content strategy I have for both are vastly different but I still focus on providing value to those who are interested in the products/services I am selling."

Told me he's done things from bar mitzvahs to weddings where there's lots of polkas to sports events, whatever. He just feels the crowd, whatever they want he gives them.

If you want some sweet mixes you can ask him and he will gladly play them!  Chris is a good bet as well!
Winnipeg,3csqwx,chaniship,2,Fri Jul 10 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"Suggestion. Regardless of the DJ, just make sure it's known that the party will want to request some specific ""good songs"", but in the meantime ask the groom for some suggestions of what people might want to hear, then make them easily available to the DJ. Put them on a usb stick in GOOD QUALITY formats (ie. high bitrrate mp3 or wav). Above all, avoid the ""I have some songs on my phone that we want to hear"" midway through his set.  All that said, once people get the drink on, all those shitty songs are gonna be sounding just fine..."

Personally I'm all for transperancy for the public sector, but I think the $50,000 cutoff is far too low for the disclosure. Public servants, especially non-political and non-management staff, do deserve some degree privacy and confidentiality over their finances.  The cutoff should be at least double the current amount for both the city and the province."
Winnipeg,3cpdjr,scopar,19,Thu Jul 9 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"These disclosure things are like the worst of all worlds.  They're public, so everyone knows your business.  But they also don't do much for accountability, since they don't distinguish between base salary and overtime, bonuses or other pay.  And in other cases, the job titles aren't really detailed enough for anyone to know whether the salaries are appropriate.  So, they're great for gossiping about how much your neighbour makes, but they're kind of shitty for holding the city accountable as a taxpayer or knowing whether you're being equitably paid as a city employee."

Fast forward 20 some-odd years and now just about every full time employee makes at least that much.  I don't work for the city but I don't see why their employees should have to put up with such a glaring lack of privacy. There are ways to provide accountability without invading privacy. One example is the feds provide general salary ranges, not an actual dollar amount to the penny. There are other ways of dealing with this too. City employees should take this up with their unions, just like the cops did."

Winnipeg,3cpdjr,ConqueringCanada,8,Thu Jul 9 23:04:08 2015 UTC,Wow that's a lot of firemen. We're getting to a point where we're going to have to rethink that whole department. We will always need ambulances and could probably use more of them. Pay for it by trimming down our fire service.
Winnipeg,3cpdjr,nrgturtle,8,Thu Jul 9 23:25:59 2015 UTC,Why do we need a full fire truck responding to a drunk passed out in the street?
Winnipeg,3cpdjr,enabler204,7,Fri Jul 10 14:12:53 2015 UTC,Because they have a strong union and no other (or at least not many) major cities seem to do it this way. So it's only logical. /s    One day I was driving and actually saw a fire truck going full lights and sirens with an ambulance right behind it and while there is a chance they were responding to a fire with an injury odds are they were going to a medical call. To ensure funding they have to keep their call numbers up.
Winnipeg,3cpdjr,dafirnz,0,Fri Jul 10 02:46:09 2015 UTC,"The alternative is that fire fighters spend their entire day playing ping-pong or lifting weights at the hall.   You have to have the same level of staffing for the fire department to respond to fire calls. If they weren't responding to medical calls, 95% of the time firefighters would be doing absolutely nothing.   Having them trained as first responders makes it so they actually work for their salary. It also allows Winnipeg to have one of the fastest 911 response systems in North America.  Having them not respond to medical calls would have no effect on required staffing - staffing is determined by need for fire coverage. Including medical coverage is actually more cost efficient as it decreases the number of ambulances and ambulance stations the city needs.  Paramedic salaries are 50-100k a year. If you had fire stop responding to medical calls in their down time, you would need to train and pay around a hundred more paramedics, buy and maintain around 10-20 more ambulance (around 7 figures each), and build and maintain about 20 new ambulance stations (millions of dollars).   Having fire respond to medical calls saves the city tens of millions of dollars a year."

Winnipeg,3cpdjr,NH787,2,Fri Jul 10 14:14:29 2015 UTC,Or working double shifts or having to deal with dead bodies and bodies bloated from being in the river or having to deal with people with guns or having to deal with rapes and child abuse/exploitation or going into drug and gang houses or having to deal with people who just lost a family member etc. I very much doubt your job is anywhere near as stressful and I also very much doubt that your job contributes anywhere near as much to society as a police officer or fire fighter or whatever.   If it's so easy and such easy money then why aren't you working as a police officer?
Winnipeg,3cpdjr,cptmartha,7,Fri Jul 10 14:26:16 2015 UTC,"I never said it was an easy job. It's very much honourable or respectable. My beef is with politicians who can't say no to influential unions. That is a recipe for financial disaster no matter which sector you're talking about.   In 2001 emergency services were 31.5% of the city budget, now it's 44%. At what point do you say enough is enough?

Definitely not as cheap as Superstore but they have better meat and produce that is worth paying extra for. I also think they have a way better Deli than Safeway.   They have the occasional good sales but it cheaper to get your staples elsewhere.
Winnipeg,3cpbjr,gayselle,3,Sat Jul 11 02:16:30 2015 UTC,That's great news for the Northgate area. Something needed to go into that former Zellers site.

Depending on which part of downtown you live, for example, like the Broadway area there's Food Fare, which isn't much. If you live near Chinatown there's Young's market. If you live near the Health Science Centre and are willing to take a bus to get there, No Frills opened up where extra foods used to be. Cabs: Cabs aren't cheap and I don't think Winnipeg has Uber yet like some other places? (Could correct me if I'm wrong.) If you have a driver's license I recommend doing the Winnipeg Car Co-Op, many of my friends who live in Wolesley and in the downtown area have only good things to say about it.

So 300GB data that shaw offers wont be good enough for me

Winnipeg,3cp17c,TheCaptainsDizzler,5,Thu Jul 9 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"You might be the only one. He's a hometown hero, there's not a lot of people who can say they captained an awesome team, won some cups, some gold medals, does charity work at hospitals/rinks, etc... The list goes on.

Winnipeg,3cp17c,tetrock84,5,Thu Jul 9 18:27:06 2015 UTC,I think he is very disserving. He does a lot of charity work in Manitoba and comes across as a humble guy for his age who always remembers and promotes were he came from. Which says a lot for a young athlete cough cough....

He comes back every summer and does a lot of work with local charities and contributes a lot of money.

Winnipeg,3co9zd,jupitergal23,7,Thu Jul 9 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe that there are no regulations for food trucks currently in Winnipeg, I feel the article missed something.  Besides the point there should be inspectors from Manitoba Health and Safety checking them out monthly in the summer."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,BrawnyJohnny,10,Thu Jul 9 14:52:32 2015 UTC,As someone who was thinking about buying/custom building one with a partner I can tell you that the propane tank and the fittings are inspected yearly by the Department of Labour (the DoL sticker needs to be adheared to the tank to get your health permit from Manitoba Health) and that's about it. No other inspection.
Winnipeg,3co9zd,jxadh95,3,Thu Jul 9 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"Well the health department checks them out once a year, or more, like they do restaurants. A few of my friends run trucks and I know they get regular inspections. I don't think they check out fire safety issues too much, I know they'll point out grease build-up, if your exhaust fans aren't working and the like though, but I assume they are less trained to deal with propane fittings and such."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,kochier,3,Thu Jul 9 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"Yup... I'm fairly certain that the health inspectors only look for a current year sticker and that's it (EDIT: I am talking about fire hazard stuff, not food handling/health related stuff). Don't quote me on that though, I just spoke with one when we were thinking of opening one -- a Chinese food truck... Bad ideas.  They know their food handling and their kitchen stuff, but you ask them about compressed gas and combustion temperatures and they would shrug I'm sure."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,jxadh95,3,Thu Jul 9 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on the inspector I guess? I've seen food trucks get dinged on that Manitoba health .pdf that gets updated a lot, they have to be looking for that stuff to see it. They check temperatures, PPM of your chemicals, etc. Maybe if they're checking monthly they are just checking if you have your permit and everything (though you think that would be something the by-law officers would look at), but I'm sure they do a full inspection once a year."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,kochier,2,Thu Jul 9 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't talking about the food safety side of things... I was strictly commenting on the fire hazard stuff. They will run checks on water temperature and all that like they do for restaurants, but you won't see a manitoba health charge for fire hazards (EDIT: other than food related ones like a plugged exhaust fan or something...)."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,jxadh95,2,Thu Jul 9 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay, that's where the confusion was. Yeah you're right, they don't really besides anything super obvious."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,kochier,2,Thu Jul 9 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"On the bylaw thing: If you read the by-laws that they (bylaw department) enforce, they're focused on property standards almost exclusively, and food trucks aren't a type of building so I'm guessing that's it. And they ain't health inspectors."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,cptmartha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh I thought they did vehicles as well, parking and whatnot, so I thought this might fall under vehicles."

Winnipeg,3co9zd,kochier,2,Fri Jul 10 05:33:54 2015 UTC,"There are regulations, but they're mostly around food safety. Looks like they inspect once before you get your permit... and then that's it."
Winnipeg,3co9zd,Syrairc,5,Thu Jul 9 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"What exactly do they expect them to inspect? Make sure nonexistent egress routes aren't blocked? There's a mile long list of fire code requirements and only a hand full apply to a food truck.   If they have kitchen hood suppression systems, those are inspected annually by a third party life safety company like Bison or ABC.   There are apartments, warehouses, factories and office buildings that don't have inspections regularly. I don't think the OFC has the manpower for that, forget adding a bunch of food trucks."

I am having a hard time understanding what they were trying to accomplish. Were the radio ads supposed to be so persuasive that the citizens would rise up and force the other councillors to vote against the plan? Were we expected to riot in the streets in response to the news that the City was planning to spend a minimal amount of money on AT?  It just seems like a overreaction to something fairly trivial.

Winnipeg,3cl3si,takaji10,5,Thu Jul 9 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"Joy Smith is not a nice person. Many years ago, I served as a board member for her riding association. There came a point when a number of board members grew unpleased with her actions as MP and tried to convince her that someone younger should run for the next election. She responded by bringing in a bunch of new faces to the AGM and having them run for board member positions. I don't know if she instructed them to not vote for the people she wanted booted, but those people did not win board positions.   After working with her for 4 years, I did not stand for the next election because my school work was taking me out of the province. Not even one ""thanks for your hard work"" or anything. The whole experience left me quite bitter.   Today, I know better. I'm not a Conservative supporter. I'm not an anything at the moment. I used to think about a career in politics, but it's really all about how much money you have. Jim Bell only sees the job as another career to make money at; I don't think he cares about the people at all.  As for Browaty? Yeah, I now see that he would've done less damage to Winnipeg as MP instead of councillor. But come election time, it would be great if leaflets were made illustrating all the stuff he's voted for/against. That might help  in making him go away...  I wonder what his falling out with Joy was all about.   Oh, and I can't even count the number of times Joy has inflated her own ego by saying ""he/she's a very good friend of mine."" She's said it for the PM too, even though she's only a backbencher."

Before buying Bowman's whine about Wyatt using tax dollars to get people to question one of Bowman's pet projects, ask yourself how much public money and earned media Bowman and other advocates have received.  I don't have the figures, but I'll bet it's hella more than a couple of radio ads.  The real slimy shit here is Bowman.  Without apology or even recognition, he's using all of the resources of the City for this project but then whines foul when a Councillor uses a portion of his allowance.

Winnipeg,3cl3si,DaleAle,-8,Wed Jul 8 23:45:16 2015 UTC,"When the disparity in access to resources is so large, being exact with the numbers is pointless.  The City of Winnipeg Budget is in the $900 Million range.  An Councillors annual allowance is in the $70,000 to 80,000 range.  Both entities have other financial obligations, but if both spend 1% of their Budgets on communications, Bowman has $900,000 to $80.  See.  Disparity.  Bowman has received plenty of earned media from rolling out the $300 Million Strategy.  Regardless of how one feels about the personalities and the strategy, having a opposing position articulated and discussed is healthy."

However, assuming such based on numbers you're pulling out of your ass is silly.  What do you mean by ""earned media?"" Are you seriously complaining that the mayor is getting media attention for getting things done? I don't understand. This is a decent project that's moving forward.

Ask mpi why the values areso diffferent they should tell you.    Arbitration costs MPI you you and mpi aren't far off on price negotiate on the permits that they won't need to post an arbitrator.  Repairing a write of isn't as bad as it sounds if you are smart about it.  Use parts from a wrecker. Source then from www.car-part.com so you're finding your best price.

Winnipeg,3clgu5,Doc_Ydoc,4,Wed Jul 8 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the replies everyone. Here is where I'm at. Shaw clearly has a better infastrucature (I believe it's fttn). But Shaw doesn't even come close to utilising their network and instead install very low data caps with slow speeds, with almost no ping thanks to fttn. MTS has an extensively upgrade VDSL2 network with plans to eventually deploy fiber (ftth). Their current stuff is maxed out at about 50mbps, but I assume they won't bother upgrading until Shaw pressures them to (which seems unlikely based on how terrible their pricing is and the general monopolisation of the telco industry). I know somethings horribly wrong when I get 30 down and 10 up on my phone (unlimited) and I get 15 down and .5 up at home..."

Winnipeg,3clgu5,Minus6OffIce,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:07 2015 UTC,Is it new? There's nothing that says it's fiber. And I doubt that it is. But. Pop open that green cover and take a photo of the tag on the cable going into it and i'll tell you.

There was nothing I could lift up without taking off the whole enclosure and there were people watching me. I did walk over to my buddy's house and took a picture of his connection which is clearly copper/dsl. Well thats too bad. Sometimes I wish MTS was still crown. Regina had fiber everywhere.
Winnipeg,3clgu5,sleepy502,3,Thu Jul 9 03:55:39 2015 UTC,"It's a ped. The tap is inside. Some areas use Arial drops while others use the buried as we see here. Shaw has fiber to the node. Their last mile is coaxial with some areas of the city and country fiber to the home. MTS has a some fiber to the home as well. They also have a couple apartment blocks off River that are fiber.  Unfortunately the speed limitations we see with Shaw is congestion on over saturated nodes. People say why not create more nodes? Simple answer. MTS has most of the digging rights in those areas and block infrastructure upgrades up to 2 years. I believe MTS owns all the peds in the province and other companies lease the rights to use it. If you manage to crack it out, you'll see the tap with a bunch of wires and spider webs."

Winnipeg,3clgu5,alex00725,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:10:20 2015 UTC,"New developments are getting fttp, waverly west, a couple in Tuxedo,  pretty much everywhere outside of the city. In new developments you pay for the install and everything in your mortgage so its not like its special or groundbreaking or anything, its not coming out of Shaw or MTS pocket. Unless something major happens with one of the providers we won't be getting fttp in existing areas. Coax has a lot of potential especially with Docsis 3.1 coming down the line."
Winnipeg,3clgu5,kochier,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:04:49 2015 UTC,That's a ped (pedestal). One that size is normally used to splice connections from your house to a larger unit somewhere central in the area. Highly unlikely that there is fiber inside of it (FOSC - fiber optic splice closure) since it appears you're in an already established area.

Winnipeg,3ckdax,Stompn_Tom,8,Wed Jul 8 16:54:56 2015 UTC,The Manitoba Museum is actually great. So is the zoo (but that's a little pricier).
Winnipeg,3ckdax,69321721,3,Wed Jul 8 16:21:11 2015 UTC,The zoo is incredible... lots of friends with young kids and they all absolutely love it (including the kids). There's a black light playground (air conditioned) inside the Tundra Cafe and the kids can literally play for an hour no problem if you need a break from walking
Winnipeg,3ckdax,takenforsaken,2,Wed Jul 8 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"Great idea.  Forgot all about it!     Oh yeah, and the Zoo cost us $50 last week.  It's crazy now."
Winnipeg,3ckdax,jxadh95,2,Wed Jul 8 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"If it cost $50 last week you should try for a family membership! If it's just you and the child it would be $95, and that's unlimited for a full year. Going during the Winter is awesome because the place is almost empty and the polar bears are more active.  But being that is was $50 I'm going to assume it was 2 parents and child, which would be $160. 3 visits in a year and you already are pretty much even. And if you ever buy food there you save 10%, or 10% off gifts... And even 10% of the Qualico food joint outside the zoo."

Winnipeg,3ckdax,xorrbit,6,Wed Jul 8 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"Some random ideas:  Find someone who doesn't have young kids but has a Show and Save book. Get them to give you the coupons they'll never use like the 2 for 1 Manitoba Museum, mini-golf and things like that.  Do you have a car? The beach at Birds Hill is nice. There is a great petting zoo type place (Deer Meadows Farm) that would probably be a hit with an 8 year old.  Aviation Museum is cool.  A walk around The Forks is always interesting, and there is the Childrens Museum there as well as a railway museum at the VIA Station.   Assiniboine Park has some fun stuff like the big playground and the steam train, and you can get a Sargent Sundae later.  City pools can be a good time with kids.  A Goldeyes game might be interesting if the kid likes sports.  Good luck!"

Winnipeg,3cg3bg,GBTRU,14,Tue Jul 7 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"In the 1960's the North End was nothing like it was today either demographically or culturally. Back when my grandparents were raising my parents and then when my parents were raising my brother and I, in the North End the poverty wasn't nearly as glaring, the crime was lower and individual neighborhoods were more compartmentalized.  The Polish folks went to the polish butcher, the Ukes and Jews did the same with their respective services, whether it be tailors or dry cleaners or what have you. How long ago did Omnitsky's close down? There's barely any corner grocery stores anymore and the ones still left seem to only be open to sell smokes and phone cards these days, not milk and produce.   It appears we've developed ourselves a nice little food desert in the North End of Winnipeg but IMO that's as much a function of the big box grocery retailers like SuperStore coming in and making the mom & pop grocers irrelevant as it is the demography of the area itself. If SuperStore, Giant Tiger, Sobeys or anyone else thought they could make money in that neighborhood they'd build a store. It's too bad they don't believe they can be profitable in that area but instead of continually bemoaning the lack of grocery options in the North End and Downtown of Winnipeg we should start enacting solutions proven to work to aid in fighting the poverty in these areas."
Winnipeg,3cg3bg,such-a-mensch,4,Tue Jul 7 18:54:15 2015 UTC,Interesting. Anybody have an idea when the north end's reputation as the rough part of town began? Looks like it would have been a tightly knit community with a lot of pride in the 60s
Winnipeg,3cg3bg,interstellar_sloth,4,Tue Jul 7 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, you'd be a bit surprised. The socioeconomic history of the North End looks something like a bell curve. In the old days of Winnipeg around the turn of the century to WWI, the North End had a reputation as an total mess where penniless immigrants arrived and lived in shacks in true poverty and terrible sanitary conditions.   After WWI things began to improve, and they really took off after WWII. By the 50s and 60s the North End was a tidy and comfortable working class neighbourhood that housed the descendants of the original Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish immigrants. It really peaked around this time, and owning a home at the corner of, say, Aberdeen and Powers would have been considered a perfectly normal thing to do, really no different than living at Jessie and Hugo.   By the 70s things began to decline as the boomer children of the Eastern Europeans left for more prosperous suburbs and the area began to be populated by Aboriginals moving in from outlying reserves. By the 90s, gangs started to exploit the impoverished conditions, crime escalated and the last vestiges of the old North End really started to fade.   In some ways, the North End has kind of come full circle, although probably with a lot more crime than there used to be."

At the end of the day, the poor immigrants who spoke broken English (if even), became successful members of society who bought cars and new houses in the suburbs and raised their families there.  The North End was then replaced by a new group of poor and working-poor who are content with going to Giant Tiger or whatever other big box store can provide them with the goods and services they require to survive.  European immigrants liked their small shops where they could speak their in their first languages and eat their familiar breads, meats and other products or where their shoes and clothing was fixed/altered/cleaned like they were ""back home"".  The people in the North End now do not have the same needs and as a result many of the smaller shops closed down or relocated to the suburbs where their customers moved to."
Winnipeg,3cg3bg,h0twired,4,Tue Jul 7 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"There is a universe of difference between the Eastern European immigrants of the turn-of-the 19th Century and the Aboriginal population of Canada.  The former had resources, identity, opportunity, and they came here - the latter have had their resources stolen, their identity eradicated, globalization has robbed them of opportunity, and they were here to being with.  My ancestors came here at the turn of the Century and they kept on going to Saskatchewan because that was where they were given 160 acres of prime farmland.....that had previously belonged to our First Nations.  Before everyone gets all pissy, I haven't the solutions but we must remember that the situation now is vastly different so it is unfair and unrealistic to expect Aboriginal people to replicate the same growth and integration as the early Eastern European immigrants."
Winnipeg,3cg3bg,redditSadly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"It is a matter of policy. The North End evolved in an era when policy allowed all sorts of different lot sizes, housing types (single-family, duplexes, row houses, apartments) and uses (retail, office) all in the same area. What ended up with was what Robert Galston describes in the Old North End, but also in most neighbourhoods built in the early 1900s in Winnipeg.  Yes, the North End has always been either the poor or working class area, and the educated children of immigrants were bound to move. But by the 50s and 60s, there were no ""nice"" new neighbourhoods that offered the same mix of housing types and land uses, but on a grander scale. Single-use zoning became the norm. In other words, it was public policy that made the only option be neighbourhoods or large lot single-family homes, with little or not multi family or retail. It was not market demand. Market demand made people seek out nice new neighbourhoods. Policy provided only one option.  So you can't act as though policies that try to bring back his mix of uses and housing types is forcing a policy on anyone. All development is governed by policy, but all we've known in half a century is policies that give us our modern, segregated suburbs."

Katz called me personally the next morning and within a week he and I had a meeting at City Hall in his office discussing the timers.  I'm sure I'm not the only reason we have the countdown now, but I was shocked when Katz claimed he'd never seen or heard of these before. He's surely been to cities that had them."

I think it slows us down because we tend to do more testing and studies than are needed, and we just push against new ideas.  I remember when these hit the news, and a lot of people were saying it won't work in Winnipeg, it'll simply make the drivers speed up, cause more accidents, it'll be a disaster. Since they've come out all I've found them to be is a help.   It's like this attitude we have that we have the worst drivers in the world. Every city believes they have the worst drivers, and this gets reinforced be selection bias, you see lots of bad drivers in your home town because you drive around there so much. In reality it's just a few impatient assholes who make everyone else nervous. People were saying it works in Toronto, but it won't work here because our drivers are much worse.

Winnipeg,3cf453,Stompn_Tom,7,Tue Jul 7 12:44:28 2015 UTC,I thought the idea is that the light changes to amber at 0. It should be consistent. I have no idea why it wouldn't be.
Winnipeg,3cf453,jxadh95,4,Tue Jul 7 14:48:42 2015 UTC,That makes sense. There are a couple that go zero then a few seconds later go yellow.
Winnipeg,3cf453,Vilyamar,3,Tue Jul 7 15:07:03 2015 UTC,The only ones that do this are ones with turning lights... The one I can think of off the top of my head is Selkirk at Main. When you are travelling Southbound on Main Street and the countdown hits 0 the Northbound Main travellers get a left turn priority signal. If no one is in the turning lane the sensors won't give them a turn light and the Southbound Main people get more signal time.

It's messy and unprofessional but it's not like the light goes amber while the CD is still on like 3 seconds then lights go green immediately on the hand.  I feel like the few second delay on the hands at full stop is an annoyance to drivers not peds.

I remember when I originally brought the idea to Katz that putting them at red light camera intersections was the first suggestion. The cameras already (supposedly) reduced the number of intersection collisions, and the idea of the timers there was to reduce even further the number of rear end collisions that occur because people never wanted to test the amber light or when the camera takes the picture so they'd slam on their brakes.  Nice to know a few of the intersections finally have the timer."
Winnipeg,3cf453,Vilyamar,7,Wed Jul 8 02:28:34 2015 UTC,"In 2009, I had a meeting with Katz about specifically this and he claimed that he's never seen this before. A man who has traveled as often as he has, has never seen this? Come on.  I'm at least glad that shortly after that meeting I started seeing the countdown timers go up. The only complaint I had to him, which I don't think ever got fixed, was that the first few that went up (Portage & Smith, I think, and a few others on Portage) flipped to yellow at four seconds, instead of at zero. That confused the fuck out of me, but at least the rest seem to be done properly."

Winnipeg,3cgjlo,paularlington,20,Tue Jul 7 19:07:07 2015 UTC,What a terrific way to discourage people from spending more time downtown.
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,apotholecalypse,25,Wed Jul 8 02:32:42 2015 UTC,"I get that they don't want arena events to eat up all of the on street parking, but 2 hours is not long enough for anyone going downtown for any entertainment purpose. If I'm meeting people for dinner or a drink, I probably need at least 3 hours."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,MyRealityIsBetter,12,Tue Jul 7 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"Why? Other than Jets games, it's not very hard to find parking downtown during most evenings. This move seems unnecessary."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,Jokurr87,9,Tue Jul 7 20:17:21 2015 UTC,The move is entirely to fuck over arena event fans and force them to pay. Also so WPA can issue more tickets while people are at said events.
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,minivan-megafun,2,Wed Jul 8 01:24:37 2015 UTC,Because there isn't enough turnouver around the MTS Centre area. The mayor talks about it on this Periscope of the media scrum today.  https://www.periscope.tv/w/aG1VNTEwNjAzNDV8MzYwNTE5MjmmgL6P_40kEqDlk1p9wuTLay469_X7WyAg9w_96xOrqQ==

Winnipeg,3cgjlo,IAMA_Boat,15,Wed Jul 8 03:10:41 2015 UTC,"Let's be realistic here. The only reason anyone parks downtown in the evening is either a) they work there, or b) Jets game or other arena event. What will this do? Force those people into paid parking venues and/or increase tickets issued by the Winnipeg Parking Authority. No one else is parking downtown in the evening because everything else is closed.   Talk about ass backwards. I was recently in Minneapolis and had to park in their downtown. On street parking is free and unlimited after 6pm. The only difference is ""event nights"" which basically follow the Vikings and Twins calendars. On THOSE nights event parking is in effect and that means you need to pay for on street parking up to a 4 hour maximum. Why doesn't Winnipeg do this? Oh yeah, because we don't bother researching anything before making decisions."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,minivan-megafun,7,Wed Jul 8 01:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, the only reason anybody ever goes downtown at night is for Jets games or country music concerts.   Nobody ever goes to the WSO, MTC, any of the restaurants and bars in Old Market Square, Cinematheque, The Garrick, the Millennium Library, Market Street, The MTC Warehouse, The WAG, Chinatown, or a whole pile of other places or anything like that.    We're not all hiding in our house in the suburbs every night. It might blow your mind, but there are people who care about stuff that isn't professional sports! Crazy eh?"
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,_Benedek_,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't say ""goes"" I said ""parks"". And if you look at the maps they want to implement the restrictions in its directly surrounding the MTS Centre.   And how would you like to have to leave the Ballet or WSO show to have to move your car?   This just seems awfully coincidental that now that 15,000 people are parking downtown 40 times a year that the WPA wants metered/restricted evening parking."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,minivan-megafun,3,Wed Jul 8 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on everything except that people go/park downtown for a whole lot of other stuff outside of arena events.  Nobody benefits from this plan, Jets fans, WSO fans, people who want to drink beer at Yellow Dog -- except for fucking Impark. Fuck those guys, and fuck all the councillors who are bending us all over to give them more money."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,_Benedek_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"If you were such a committed attendee of these places and events, you'd know that probably 90% of the patrons are from the suburbs. And the WAG is only open past 5pm one night a week. Who do you think is attending the Symphony and MTC? Or the Opera or the ballet? Do you think these places rely upon broke hipsters living in the village or in the Broadway-Assiniboine neighbourhood? Or do you think their audience are upper-middle-class suburbanites who don't just attend, but also donate?  And the Burt and Garrick are not big enough venues to have any sort of impact.  Also, Chinatown? What are people doing in Chinatown these days? Eating at Kum Koon during lunch?  It is almost strictly suburbanites that attend these places. That's why they drive. And they use off street parking because it's less risky, but it wouldn't be an issue anyway. Everybody on Market street on a given day is largely there for the same reason - be it theatre, symphony, etc. There's next to no other demand.  The only reason there's an issue now is because there are events that pull nearly 16K people at a time now. Those are professional sports games whether you like that or not. And those are largely the same suburbanites.  I have no idea why you feel the need to try and disparage suburbanites here. Without them, there wouldn't be any of those events you're feeling so self-important about."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,WpgTroglodyte,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"Nice meltdown!   Note that I said ""our house"" in the suburbs. See what you can infer from that. Guess where I live too?  Calm down, change the shirt you drooled on, and let's move forward.  PS: There are all sorts of events that happen on weeknights in Chinatown, but it helps if you're either part of that community or know somebody who is tied to it.  PPS: And I go to lots of Jets games too. MIND BLOWN."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,_Benedek_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"Strictly restricting parking on street is not good... It should be paid meter parking. Supply and demand/tragedy of the commons... If 16K people want a limited number of parking spots then they should have to pay for them, much like the people who work downtown M-F, 9-5."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,jxadh95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"Except that asking people to pay for something they're mostly disinterested in all but about 44 nights a year means that you're creating more barriers, not fewer. And I don't disagree that on those nights as a means to create some revenue they could at least compete with the off-street parking companies, but it has the same intended effect without discriminating against Jets fans. And I'm not even really a Jets fan, I'm just saying that it's politically untenable to single out the patrons of one very important event that takes place semi-regularly downtown.  Downtown can't compete with even the inner-ring suburbs for patrons unless there's something very unique or sought after. You have to create incentive instead. Threatening to ticket somebody for staying at their table for 15 minutes longer than they should have is a pretty good way to remind somebody that going downtown is simply a potentially very expensive hassle."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:51:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting...   The first-level post actually said that Minneapolis does this -- charges ""game night"" parking on street, so I'm not sure it's untenable (perhaps it is here)... It wouldn't be much different than charging for parking during the day. It is a good, it is in short supply, we have to charge for it because we pay to maintain it.  Aside from that, I don't think the ticketing agents, or whatever you would want to call them, would be out in force on nights where we didn't have hockey, so staying an extra 15 minutes would more than likely not net you a ticket, unless it's game night.  All in all I don't think that we should be charging for on street parking strictly to generate revenue (while it is a bonus if you ask me). We should be charging for on street parking to create a socially optimal number empty spots.  http://streets.mn/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/shoup-chart-parking-prices-occupancy.jpg  This helps people to find parking downtown for the short-stays and drives long-term parkers off street."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,jxadh95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"I just don't think anybody is going to depend upon the goodwill of the ticketing agents. They'll just see the potential result and opt out. Risk management at its most basic.  This is Winnipeg. And the Jets are sacrosanct. If you started charging only for game nights, you can bet this would become a political nightmare. It's why they stopped short of actually charging anybody even though that amounts to a $4 surcharge on a ~$300 game night. It's not the money; it's the perception of the intent. And Jets fans will consider it an attack on their willingness to go downtown which is already regarded by most as a favour to the city.  We also have a civic government that has almost comically mismanaged itself over the past ~15 years. They don't have any goodwill left with the citizens. Telling the citizens that they're being charged for parking as a favour to them will go over as you might expect. This isn't a city that has the sort of credibility to be able to make claims like that and have the average citizen believe it. It just looks like the government's hand in their pocket again. And if you believe that robust data is more powerful than populist belief, then I've got a bridge to sell you ;)"

Winnipeg,3cgjlo,hashbar2,4,Tue Jul 7 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"I hope this does not get approved. Night time activities run way longer than daytime errands. First of all, it's going to discourage people from moving downtown because it's a lonely life when there is no place for your visitors to park. I feel like it will most likely encourage drinking and driving, because people will feel the need to move their car immediately as opposed to spending some extra time enjoying downtown. For me, I would rather pay a small night fee, than risk getting a big ticket because my event went longer than expected."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,pickle_lady,6,Wed Jul 8 01:29:06 2015 UTC,Just another reason to avoid the area.
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,hiphopsicles,2,Tue Jul 7 20:22:02 2015 UTC,The only people who want this are Impark.  Our City Council are fucking us in the name of a shitty greedy company.
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,_Benedek_,3,Wed Jul 8 13:22:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, two hour parking on the street (even in the evening) is pretty typical of most mid-to-large sized North American cities. In my humble opinion, on street parking should be casual (2 hours) and longer term parking should move into a dedicated lot (or take transit). I feel this move is pretty reasonable."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,scopar,9,Tue Jul 7 19:47:51 2015 UTC,It would be reasonable if transit wasn't complete garbage and massively inconvenient to use; unless you live in some select spots.
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,hiphopsicles,5,Tue Jul 7 20:22:42 2015 UTC,Then do what I do and park in the select spots for free. Going to a Jets game and don't want to pay for parking? Park someone off Pembina/Portage/St. Mary's/Main/etc. where the on-street parking is unlimited and the buses are frequent from downtown.
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,randomanitoban,3,Tue Jul 7 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"A Jets game is a special sort of occasion though.  What if I just want to go to the pub for the evening?  Sure, I guess I could do what you suggested.  Or I could save myself a ton of hassle and go to a place that isn't downtown."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,hiphopsicles,3,Tue Jul 7 21:53:09 2015 UTC,Or you could stop acting like it's such a huge hassle to take the bus downtown when it's the best service region in the entire city.
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,greyfoxv1,4,Wed Jul 8 05:33:43 2015 UTC,The fact that its the best service region in the city is an example of just how pathetic the whole system is.

Winnipeg,3cgjlo,jxadh95,2,Wed Jul 8 13:49:11 2015 UTC,Honestly I've been having a huge hassle getting to and from work downtown recently. I've had to start taking an earlier bus because the one I used to take is now constantly too full to pick anyone up.

No. But it is expected for people to live within their means.

So I really don't give a shit if you have to pay for the privilege of driving to a hockey game, or concert, or whatever other event.

Winnipeg,3cgjlo,jxadh95,2,Wed Jul 8 12:43:16 2015 UTC,"There isn't much of a choice though.  The way this city has been built makes it pretty much impossible to have proper transit service throughout.  The roads are designed without any foresight and as a result, nobody, including buses can get anywhere fast.  Quite frankly, its impossible to correct without massive lifestyle changes or sacrifices from the people who live here.  For that reason, I'll be jumping off this ship soon enough.  I'm not interested in paying for the mistakes of the people that put us in this mess."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,hiphopsicles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"There is a choice, but (as I have said countless times before) it's a non-starter and political suicide. Taking lanes away from autmobiles and giving it to transit, bikes and pedestrians.  Just think of the Pedestrian and Biking strategy at EPC today. Look at all the councillors who talk about using that money for cars (5 or 6 of them)... The problem is their framing. They look at the strategy and think ""This won't fix anything. People want to drive to work."" without realize that people don't want to drive to work, they want to spend less time getting to and from work. We do have a choice, it's just one that politicians can't wrap their heads around (mostly because they are stuffed too far up their asses)."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,jxadh95,2,Wed Jul 8 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the politicians are totally useless.  I agree.  I just think that the problem is so severe at this point that nothing short of massive amounts of money or radical changes to people's lives can fix it.  As I neither want to fork over money or radically change my life in the manner that will be needed to fix the issue, I'm bailing.    I also don't want this burden of debt that will likely become a reality to fall on the shoulders of my kid.  So I'm getting her out before that as well."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,hiphopsicles,2,Wed Jul 8 15:49:57 2015 UTC,"But the people who want all this automobile infrastructure don't realize that it's what's causing the problem. They frame it the same way the politicians do, and they look at the problem and go with the brute-force solution that the engineers use to ""solve"" it, the Complete Street, which will do nothing but cost us more money.  Politicians, engineers, and citizens all need to realize that there is very little value to driving 50 in a residential neighbourhood. The distance from your house to the nearest arterial street is more than likely less than a kilometer. In that kilometer going 50 instead of 20 or 30 will save you ~10-15 seconds. But designing a street to 50 kph is orders of magnatude more expensive than designing one for 20 or 30. We are spending millions of dollars on streets like Linden Woods Drive, Scurfield/Columbia, Island Shore, Shore Hill, Sage Creek/Des Hivernants, Beaverhill/Lakewood, Ravenhurst, Devonshire, Red River, Amber Trails, Inkster Garden, Burrows (west of Keewatin), Jose Rizel, Hamilton, Westwood, Dale/Barker, North/South Town Road and Bison Drive just so people can drive 50 kph on them instead of 30. Why? The total distance of each of those is less than 3 kilometers each. 2 minutes... Millions upon Millons of dollars to save 2 minutes, or around 1/20th of the total peak hour commute time for the people they service.  This is not sustainable.  Streets that have a design speed of 30 kph are already pedestrian and bike friendly. They don't need to be completed because they are already complete. Not only that, they are cheaper than what the engineer would call ""complete streets""."

Winnipeg,3cgjlo,SophistXIII,2,Wed Jul 8 14:01:21 2015 UTC,"If you think we built all this infrastructure for transit then you need to rethink your understanding of transportation networks.  Do you think we require 4 lanes on every downtown one-way street because of buses? No, we require it for private automobiles to park and drive. Do you think we require Portage to be between 7 and 10 lanes from Memorial to Main? Nope, it only uses 2. Do you think Main Street needs to be 6-10 lanes from Broadway to Higgins? Nope again, they only use 2.  So tell me how much of that infrastructure is for ""transit"" and how much if strictly for private automobiles."

Let me get in my time machine and make sure the city planners of yore only constructed two lanes both ways for buses and some cycling lanes for the hippies.   By your ludicrous logic, we should only be building rapid transit lanes, bike lanes and only maintaining 1 lane on each existing street for buses. Everything else is just a waste of money."

Winnipeg,3cgjlo,jxadh95,0,Wed Jul 8 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"A lecture on logic now? Hilarious.  An absurd argument merits nothing more than an absurd response.   Winnipeg will not move away from personal transportation in the foreseeable future. Public transit will never trump the comfort and connivence of cars in this city, especially when you consider our winters. Waiting for the bus/biking may be acceptable on a wide basis year round in other cities, but not here. Only those who cannot afford a car will ""choose"" to take the bus when it's -40 outside.   We haven't even discussed the other uses of public roads besides personal transport, such as the transport of goods and other service industries that rely on the roads. Should pizza delivery drivers take the bus? Not if i want my pizza within an hour, or at all.   This vendetta against the car is nothing short of ludicrous, hippy bullshit spouted by those completely divorced from reality."
Winnipeg,3cgjlo,SophistXIII,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"I'm lecturing you on logic because you are using logical flaws. I'm not ""making an absurd argument"", I am saying that the City already has more than enough infrastructure for personal private vehicles, more spending on this sort of infrastructure will never be financially viable, the spending habit makes private automobiles the only viable form of transport, and that the debt driven spending on it will force our taxes up.  I never said that people would move away from personal private vehicles as their form of transportation, I merely said that the City will not be able to continue to fund this. For them to continue would move them closer to insolvency. They need to stop throwing more good money after bad.  As for the weather argument, and the trade argument, they have been used before and they hold no water. Minneapolis has a large biking population and they are not much warmer than us. And trade doesn't need more streets inside the city, they need better highways, a place I advocate for more transportation spending.  I don't have a vendetta against cars, I have a vendetta against people who think that public transit is some sort of subsidy where as you pay your own way when you take a private car. Private cars cost more in health problems, economic problems and social problems than public transit ever will. I also have a vendetta against people who think the street is the domain of the car."

Like most of what the Administration of the City of Winnipeg as well as the Mayor and City Council do is more more their own benefit than that of the citizen.  This is just another example.  Though I work downtown I am rarely in need of street parking because I cycle more than 300 out of 365 days a year.  It's just my preference.  I don't go to Jet's games and when I shop, Walmart has plenty of free parking, and no locations downtown.  You have a logical inconsistency to deal with, i.e: the claim you benefit financially from doubling the on-street parking rate, yet don't own a car.  There is no benefit to you.  There is a benefit to IMpark and the Off-Street Parking Lobby, but not to you.  In fact, the Off-street Parking Lobby and their Jo-Boys in the City Administration are picking your pocket, as well as mine.  ""Explore innovative incentives and tools to promote structured versus surface parking, such as a parking district assessment, tax increment financing, etc""  What does that mean?  It means that the City will give money directly, or through tax breaks to the benefactors of the Off-Street Parking Lobby to build parkades.  Wonderful!  Oh happy day!  get rid of those nasty surface parking lots!  Stop people from parking on the streets!  oh happy day!  Wrong.  What we wind up with are parkades that exist because of a financial incentive paid for by you and me, not parkades that exist because of actual demand.  In order to generate more ""customers"" for the Off-Street Parking Lobby the City ratchets up the on-street rate, extends the hours of paid parking, and reduces the number of on-street stalls.  So instead of people parking on streets that we have all paid for, the benefactors of the On-Street Parking Lobby using tax breaks that you and I pay for, get more ""customers"".....or, people just shop at Walmart because they have free parking.  Frankly, I don't just two shits about extending the hours, or doubling the rate.   The issue is bigger than that, it's the neo-liberal economic agenda of using public resources for private gain.  They are crafty fucks and in their powerpoint presentations given to roomfuls of bureaucrats they use urbanism, environmentalism, and even social justice as conduits to the public coffers and infrastructure for their personal gain.  That.  Is what I object to.  And of course the kicker here is that the City of Winnipeg can't even keep it's own parkade in operation.  It was condemned a couple of years ago and they haven't even bothered to fix it.   lulz  Edit: Fix link to Parking Strategy."

SAM’s commonsense, third-way approach to marijuana policy is based on reputable science and sound principles of public health and safety. At SAM we reject dichotomies — such as “incarceration versus legalization” — that offer only simplistic solutions to the highly complex problems stemming from marijuana use and the policies surrounding it. Our aim is to champion smart policies that decrease marijuana use and do not harm marijuana users and low-level dealers with arrest records that stigmatize them for life and in ways that make it even harder for them to break free from cycles of substance dependence.   The mission statement sort of sounds reasonable, but then you read  their ""Ten things to know"" (which actually has 59 points repeated many times.. wtf?) -> http://www.learnaboutsam.ca/ten-things-to-know.php -> you get gems such as:    Marijuana is harmful, especially to kids and adolescents. • Marijuana use is significantly linked with mental illness, especially schizophrenia and psychosis, but also depression and anxiety. • 1 in 6 kids who use marijuana become addicted. • Persistent and heavy marijuana use reduces IQ among those who started smoking before age 18. • Marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. • Marijuana use doubles the risk of car crashes.    These are presented as facts with limited research supporting them - the other points are similar. What kind of ""science based"" organization doesn't use peer reviewed based research to found its key points?  Why not just name your group the Anti-Marijuana Approach in Canada and be true to your obvious mission statement."

A TL:DR; for those who are too lazy:  Someone stole OP's bike parked in front of her, she chased after the thief, many  good Samaritans help her retrieve the bike, she is grateful.  A good story to start the week, thanks for sharing OP."

Winnipeg,3cbc2x,ErikKarlssonsTendon,8,Mon Jul 6 16:44:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Me too, I remember explicitly thinking while I was chasing after him, ""This is not how this story is going to end."" And lo and behold, I was proven right. People rock."
Winnipeg,3cbc2x,ataradrac,9,Mon Jul 6 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"That is SO great.  You're right, people rag on Winnipeg sometimes, but honestly - whenever I've seen something bad go down, I've seen people come stampeding up to see if they can help.   Be it fairly trivial, like getting your car stuck in a snowbank, or serious, like someone collapsing from a heart attack.   I'm so happy that your fellah got his bike back!"
Winnipeg,3cbc2x,izzitme101,6,Mon Jul 6 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly! I've never been stuck in a snowbank for more than five minutes without someone coming to help. Once, I was even stranded with a flat on highway 8, in -40 weather, while pregnant. And a couple went above and beyond in getting me on my way. I've learned never to underestimate people, but also never to expect anything. You're almost always in for a wonderful surprise."

Winnipeg,3cbc2x,superking4u,5,Mon Jul 6 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, everything happened so quickly that I had trouble processing everything. My brain was thinking these rational questions but my mouth couldn't deliver.  My spouse spoke with them and apparently the guy got the flat tire while trying to pass over train tracks while biking away while they drove after him. He then ditched the bike and they grabbed it. He obviously went across the train tracks to ditch them. Joke's on him!"

Winnipeg,3cbc2x,zzyjayfree,4,Mon Jul 6 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"Checking in!   Happy everything worked out for you! With that kind of a backstory, i totally understand why you were running after the guy without any shoes.  I had just come in to city limits, arriving back in the city from Morris. I was about to introduce a girl ive been seeing for the past while to my mom for the first time, and we were running late when I heard yelling/screaming from across the street. I saw you chasing after this guy on a bike, so, From my car I hollered at you ""WHATS GOING ON?"" I'm not sure if you actually heard me or if you were stating to anyone who could hear ""HE STOLE MY BIKE!!"". The guy ducked in behind the gas station, I turned off of pembina and tried following him along the sidestreet and down a back lane... I actually didnt see the guy again until he tried crossing the lane to get over the tracks. The two of us made eye contact, i stopped, and started to get out of my car.  The real hero was the guy already chasing on foot, who i have no connection to whatsoever! The guy chasing got to within 15 feet of your bike when the thief ditched it and ran over to some houses.  Beyond following the guy and maybe giving him a bit of a scare, all i did was provide observational support and/or backup for the guy on foot!  I told the story to my mom when we got to her place, and she wound up hearing you on the radio this morning. Of course she decided to call the radio station and give them my information.... A few hours later, i get a call at work from OP, who pointed me towards this post! I've been a faithful lurker for many-a-year, even on the winnipeg boards.. but i never thought to check after what happened on sunday.  Again, So glad things worked out for you. Also, if you havent considered making writing a bigger part of your life, you certainly should. You've got a talent!  Take care!!!!!"
Winnipeg,3cbc2x,zzyjayfree,3,Wed Jul 8 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"So glad it worked out. I married a guy who loves biking and owns an expensive Trek, and biking was the activity that brought us together, so I felt all the feels. We got married while he was still a broke student. Cheap weddings can be just as wonderful and fun as expensive ones!"
Winnipeg,3cbc2x,zzyjayfree,3,Tue Jul 7 01:46:10 2015 UTC,"If it was just a bike, even a  2,000 dollar bike, I'm sure he would have gotten over it in time.  But that was the bike that lead him to you . I can see why it means so much to you and him. And i'm kinda crying right now. I'm so happy for you both."
Winnipeg,3cbc2x,qwartx,2,Tue Jul 7 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"This was so awesome to read! Thanks for sharing, and good job on telling the story. :)"
Winnipeg,3cbc2x,LaconicMan,2,Mon Jul 6 23:21:56 2015 UTC,Not surprising. Bike theft is a low risk crime - the consequences are low and that's if the police even bother to investigate. I would be kind of surprised if 911 would send out anyone to chase after the guy in a timely manner.
Winnipeg,3cbc2x,e_cybo_pooch,2,Tue Jul 7 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"thanks for sharing, truly and inspirational story!  I hate bike thieves so much, after having a bike I borrowed stolen earlier this year, and then the front wheel of my bike stolen a couple weeks ago I've been afraid to even buy a bike again because I know it will just get stolen, so it's nice to see that sometimes the thieves don't get away with it!"

Keep in mind that you just request what you want from the chefs and they'll deliver it to you. If you stand around like a normal buffet they'll look at you like a dumbass.  ...  Or so I'm told.

The owner/sensei set up special classes for a large group that we got together during the school days, and he has been accommodating and awesome to work with.  My two daughters just earned their black belts and the program changed their lives (they have to write an essay as part of the process, and it was really emotional).  The dojo is friendly, the prices are right, and the leadership team is fantastic.  We've become friends with much of the staff and have spent time together out of the dojo, and a nicer bunch you'll never meet.  They're really committed to proper form and the ideals of the practice.    I'm not involved with them, just a happy customer.  A really, really, happy customer."

We always hit up the Mall of America, check out the Aquarium and Nickelodeon Universe - most of the rides here are pretty kid-centric, except for the roller coaster and the ninja turtle thing.  I noticed that you might be into boardgames, if so, I absolutely recommend the Fantasy Flight Game Centre! It's a huge gaming area, store and cafe at Fantasy Flight's HQ.  If you're into animals, check out the Como Zoo, it's free and has a bunch of primates. For Breakfast Hell's Kitchen. Pizza, Pizza Luce. Coffee, 5 watt Art: Walker (this one has paintings that don't look like paintings), Minneapolis Institute of Art (this has suits of armour and shit), The Weismen's pretty good too.

I'm not going to go in to what I am paid, but when you start, don't expect anything over $15/hour. I talk from the RRC perspective because when I went back to take my level two  program, half of the class was from Winnipeg tech. It is the same program, just MITT is going to be slightly less expensive. The other issue I had was getting a job, I did work at Winnipeg sport & leisure for some time, which was a great job with some neat perks, like borrowing bikes on weekends and what-not. Unfortunately, they never gave me the opportunity to prove myself as a mechanic and I slipped in to the ""yard guy"" side of things, so I left there, and am now fairly happy at a lawn & garden shop, where I am always busy with something. Anyways I'm rambling, but I hope this helped a bit, if you have any more questions I'd be glad to answer them, just shoot me a message."

The dealers that are left don't even carry much stock.  MPI killed street bikes. The days of everyone having a dirtbike are long gone. ATV's somewhat replaced dirtbikes, but now riding areas are being threatened by the enviro-nazis. ATV clubs that would try to protect riding areas have few members because nobody wants rules. Net result is less people riding than a few years ago.  Snoman is hell bent on making snowmobiling unaffordable to anyone that's not rich.  Between SnoPass fees, insurance and less snow, I know people that didn't even pull their sleds out of the garage last winter.  That leaves boats.  Place an ad on Kijiji selling anything and you'll have a dozen people wanting to trade you a boat for it.  Powersports needs new blood to survive and the younger generation doesn't have the money or interest.

Yeah there's a shortage because so few places want to hire apprentices. So instead of changing the way the schooling is approached, like maybe changing it to 1 day a week or night classes. We'll just keep the same 2 months out of a year schedule because people want to go on EI making a reduced income and employers want to lose an employee for 2 months. When the economy tanked in 2008, they set up a program to subsidize employees taking one day off a week by covering at least a portion of it with some form of EI, but make it so employees and employers are more likely to participate in something like an apprenticeship program would make too much sense. Imagine if all the people taking trades programs actually gained related employment. They wouldn't be able to keep cramming people through 5 month courses."

Winnipeg,3c85r0,Spencie-cat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yar. Yer mamma swabbed it good, yar."
Winnipeg,3c85r0,IAMA_Boat,7,Mon Jul 6 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"Bring less food and more money.  There are food vendors in the campground and it's way easier to let them do the cooking.  If you're bringing beer, bring canned beer to avoid broken glass."
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Flabergie,4,Sun Jul 5 20:43:58 2015 UTC,I dunno about that. There are some GREAT vendors this year but their prices are going to be higher than normal. You could just buy a small propane burner from a place like Lucky Supermarket and cook your own meals pretty easily. Those burners are like 20$ so super cheap.
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Randformula,5,Sun Jul 5 21:31:35 2015 UTC,"Just going from my own experience camping there.  I usually ended up throwing most of my food away at the end of the weekend as cooking takes time and effort, especially if you are indulging in intoxicants.  When the vendors came into the campground some years ago it made things pretty awesome.  It all depends on your finances.  For me the cost was minimal compared  the convenience of no cooking, cleaning, and lugging in stoves, utensils and food."
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Flabergie,4,Sun Jul 5 21:44:06 2015 UTC,"Hey fair enough. I dont really have experience in this so perhaps you're right.  Perhaps loading up on dried foods and fresh fruit that doesnt need to be refrigerated would be a good plan, and save the vendors for dinner or something."
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Randformula,6,Sun Jul 5 21:57:41 2015 UTC,In the unexpected benefits category; the number of burn injuries treated by festival campground first-aid took a nose-dive after the vendors were put in the campground.  Far fewer messed up folkies trying to cook with fire late at night.
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Flabergie,4,Sun Jul 5 22:46:01 2015 UTC,"I'm with you all the way. I brought food for 5 years in a row and I was always too lazy/hot to cook and do dishes and clean up and whatnot. Hauling all that stuff from the car and constantly buying ice was no fun either. The last two years that I went,I just brought munchies and cash and with the food vendors in the campground d open, it was way more convenient and enjoyable."
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Joshdecent,2,Sun Jul 5 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"I've been going for around 25 years now but I stopped camping a few years back due to wood smoke sensitivity.  No matter what food I brought, it couldn't match a bucket of mini-doughnuts at 3 AM."
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Flabergie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:55:23 2015 UTC,"Amen. The first year they started doing vendors in the campground, they had a stone oven pizza guy and the fruit stand sold bannock. I ate well that year."
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Joshdecent,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:03:28 2015 UTC,Heh heh heh. I knew one of the vendors super well and had done a big banquet with him the year before and was doing another one two weeks later. I convinced him to deep dry pizza pops for me. He was worried they would explode. They didn't and we're glorious.
Winnipeg,3c85r0,stazy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:22:50 2015 UTC,It's my first time going this year and I'm still trying to weigh cost/benefits. Do you know approximately how expensive the food vendors are per meal?
Winnipeg,3c85r0,Youre-not-funny-ever,2,Mon Jul 6 02:50:06 2015 UTC,Usually about $13 for a decent plate.

Winnipeg,3c8cg2,darkstrand,5,Sun Jul 5 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"I would call http://www.donvoth.com and see if he can take a look. If it's audio equipment and fixable, he'll be able to fix it."
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,madmadbiologist,2,Sun Jul 5 22:26:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation, shot him and email and hopefully it works out."
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,a_carrot,2,Sun Jul 5 22:37:28 2015 UTC,"Seconding Don Voth, he is the only person I trust with my electronic repairs."
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,CStanners,2,Mon Jul 6 03:19:10 2015 UTC,-Columbus Radio Ltd on Sanford likely does it -or if it's something simple (loose solder joint) you can pass by Skullspace on Tuesday evenings and see if anyone will resolder it for free.
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,LesleeGrace,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:20:19 2015 UTC,Seconding Columbus. Had them fix the plug on a pair of $200 Klipsch headphones for me last year. Only charged me $30 for the repair.
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,randylaheyjr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:32:59 2015 UTC,What kind of headphones?
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,YRPWKR_am_human,2,Sun Jul 5 22:05:19 2015 UTC,Audio Technica ATH-AD900
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,YRPWKR_am_human,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:08:46 2015 UTC,That explains why you'd like them repaired instead of just replacing them.  Is there no audio at all or can you wiggle a wire somewhere along the length of it to get some intermittent sound?
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,nizon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"The 3.5mm jack was completely bent so after that audio only comes out of one side, I know it's a simple fix of rewiring the end I just don't have the tools available to get it done and want it done as neatly as possible."
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,hahaha_ohwow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:29:33 2015 UTC,"That's pretty general fix, even if you can't find a place that specifically repairs headphones most electronics repair places should be able to help you out."
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,AssaultedCracker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:17:26 2015 UTC,"You can get a cheap soldering iron, solder and a new connector at Active for probably around $25."
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,AssaultedCracker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:31:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but a cheap soldering iron and lack of experience will result in a bad solder joint that is only going to last maybe a few days-weeks.  This is definitely not the fix to learn soldering on.
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,stazy,-2,Mon Jul 6 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"I can find those for $130 on Amazon. You're probably better off doing that, unless you can fix them yourself, or unless you know it's a straightforward repair. Repair guys always tell me not to bother fixing my $100 headphones"
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,BackToTheFanta,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:38:51 2015 UTC,They're 300$ headphones
Winnipeg,3c8cg2,thehypnotoad1988,-2,Mon Jul 6 05:29:47 2015 UTC,New. And they're $130 used. And what you're paying to repair are used headphones.
Winnipeg,3c8bj7,carsonbiz,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"I just received one of those City of Winnipeg police report emails and it states:  ""On July 4, 2015, shortly after 2:00 p.m. members of the Winnipeg Police Service were dispatched to a business in the 500 block of Washington Avenue for the report of a suspicious package.  Multiple units were dispatched and the area surrounding the incident location was shut down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic.  Members of the Bomb Unit attended and at approximately 10:40 p.m. successfully deactivated the package which contained an unknown material that detonated during the process.  No one was injured; however there was extensive damage to the business.  Police remain on scene.  Investigators have confirmed a link between the Washington Avenue business and the River Avenue explosion at the Peterson King law firm.  A 49-year-old male was taken into custody last evening.  Interviews are on-going and no charges have been laid.  The investigation is on-going by members of the Major Crimes Unit and continues to advance.  This afternoon police are in attendance at two locations: a business on Springfield Road, and a residence on Pandora Avenue. Search warrants are being executed with the assistance of Bomb Unit personnel from the Winnipeg Police Service and the RCMP. Some residents around the Pandora Avenue location have been evacuated as a precaution. Public movement will also be restricted at the Springfield Road location. Police are not aware of any specific information regarding explosives at either of these locations; however, we are taking no chances in light of the discoveries on River Avenue and Washington Avenue.  OR  This afternoon police are in attendance at three locations: a business on Springfield Road, and a residence on Pandora Avenue as well as a business on Stradbrook Avenue.

Some residents around the Pandora Avenue location have been evacuated as a precaution. Public movement will also be restricted at the Springfield Road location.

Winnipeg,3c8bj7,thebigslide,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:52:13 2015 UTC,I guess the big whit 5 tonne truck surrounded by officers has something to do with the bomb squad.
Winnipeg,3c8bj7,dafirnz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"Winnipeg police have a 49-year-old man in custody in their investigation into two explosive devices, one of which extensively injured 38-year-old lawyer Maria Mitousis Friday morning, but have not yet laid charges.   Supt. Danny Smyth would not tell reporters at a news conference late this afternoon who the man is, where he works, or how they suspect he is connected to the case.   Two separate justice sources told the Free Press the business on Washington east of Watt Street where the second explosion happened is linked to a former client of Mitousis. Police have been combing through the files of the family law specialist as part of the extensive investigation. The sources told the Free Press on Sunday that a ""disgruntled"" former client of Mitousis is currently in police custody being questioned. No charges have been laid at this time.  Police remain at the scene in the 500 block of Washington Avenue where a police robot used a water cannon Saturday night in an auto body shop to detonate a device. There was extensive damage to the building but no injuries.  ""Our investigators have confirmed a link"" between the two explosions, Smyth said, declining to elaborate.   Smyth told the news conference that police have 24 hours in which to charge or release the man — that will run out around 8 p.m., he said. ""He was arrested at his residence,"" said Smyth.  Investigators were able to talk to Mitousis Saturday in hospital, said Smyth. ""She was able to provide a fair amount of information. I’m not prepared to share that information,"" he said. ""She has been stabilized; her recovery will take considerable time.""   Smyth said that because of the ongoing investigation, police can not divulge what Mitousis told them, or make public any details about the explosive devices or how they came to the two locations. ""That one’s going to take some forensic analysis,"" he said.  Late this afternoon, police were executing search warrants at an unidentified business on Springfield Road and at a home on Pandora Avenue. Both city police and RCMP bomb units were on the scene, though Smyth emphasized that no other explosive devices or suspicious packages have been seen. Police also taped off a law firm on Stradbrook Avenue this afternoon since getting a call from the firm, but left about an hour later.  ""Since Friday, we’ve had 20 reports of suspicious packages,"" Smyth said. ""As we proceed, we’ll take the bomb unit in tow with us.""   Neighbours on Washington reported seeing officers with their guns drawn Saturday. Several nearby residents were also asked to evacuate.  One man who lives just north of the auto body shop said police ordered him to leave the area around 4 p.m. Saturday; he was allowed to return around 12:30 a.m. Sunday.   A block south on Jamison Street, Brigitte Ross said police told residents that leaving was voluntary, but told them to stay indoors.  Mitousis was rushed to hospital in critical condition after opening a package that contained an explosive device while inside her office in the 200 block of River Avenue Friday morning. She suffered extensive injuries to her throat and stomach. The Canadian Press, quoting a source, said Mitousis apparently lost one of her hands in the blast.  The Free Press obtained an email sent Saturday by a family member of Mitousis to friends and family which provided some good news:  ""(Mitousis) is in good spirits and is recovering well. Her surgeries were successful and the results are the best we all could have hoped for given the circumstances. The doctors and staff have been superb. Maria has asked me to express her gratitude for all your well-wishes, prayers and thoughts. She is looking forward to a speedy recovery and looks forward to connecting with you all in the near future,"" the email read.  A GoFundMe page has been set up online to raise money for Mitousis, stating she ""sustained very serious injuries"" and ""will require financial support as she recovers from this horrific event.""  Smyth told reporters Friday that investigators don’t believe the incident was an attack on the justice system.  They said the victim was alone in the offices of the small firm — Petersen King — at the time of the blast and nearby residents alerted them.   After the blast, police went to the downtown law firm where she had worked until last fall — Monk Goodwin — and workers were removed as a precaution. No devices were found.   There were at least two other ""suspicious"" incidents investigated later in the day Friday — one on Broadway, the other near Confusion Corner -- which also proved to be false alarms.   Mitousis’s common-law husband, Barry Gorlick, had worked at Monk Goodwin before being disbarred Monday on 15 counts of professional misconduct."
Winnipeg,3c596f,cheatersteve,22,Sat Jul 4 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not up on the newest slang, but the normal meaning of ""flag man"" is the person at a construction site who holds the sign to control traffic. It's basically a safety job.  If that's what he was talking about, then the vendor guy was probably trying to stop the dude from drinking on the job.  If that's what happened, then vendor guy did a good thing."
Winnipeg,3c596f,kent_eh,5,Sat Jul 4 22:55:19 2015 UTC,"Safety related job employ workers who have every right to drink in their own time.  Without more backstory, that's an odd conclusion to make.  It's possible they knew each other personally and the vendor guy knew the flag guy was working soon, but that's still not right because the flag-man could have been picking up beer for after work.    I suspect something else was going on, or they just wanted to get the guy talking because they suspected he was already intoxicated and a slurred response or beer breath established that."

Winnipeg,3c596f,noexistence,3,Sat Jul 4 23:01:53 2015 UTC,I see what he means about drinking at work. It could be that. The guy was also talking to some younger folks in the lot so maybe he assumed he was going to buy for them. They seemed to know him well.

Winnipeg,3c5kzo,devious_204,2,Sun Jul 5 13:30:13 2015 UTC,I love the complexity of the cuisine with all the spices and such.  Perhaps you are not a curry person?  Do you like Indian?    Or maybe you're like me and can't eat cilantro?  Thai uses cilantro in a number of dishes and I always stress that I don't want cilantro (because it's either that or I'm eating soap flavoured soup).

I'd be willing to bet you'll have more success."

Luckily we were asked to house sit for some people, so we had a couple months on the ground. I would call up the management companies themselves and see what they can do for you. I don't know many of them; we're with Towers Realty right now and they seem really professional.  You'll be arriving at a prime time to start up a lease, so you have that going for you (most leases are September-August, in my experience). Also, many more advertisements will go up 1-2 months before the date you want, so keep that in mind!  Edit: just noticed you're looking for furnished. That's not all that common here, but one long shot is to keep an eye on Sabbatical listings from the universities to see if any professors are away and want to rent out their houses temporarily."

Ask the citizens of Nova Scotia if they feel like winners with the prices they pay to their privatized Hydro utility. The wonderful invisible hand of the free market now shoves the highest power rates in Canada down their throats. Watch the same thing happen in Ontario once Hydro One is sold. Insurance prices in most other provinces where there is no public option are dramatically higher, as well.   Selling off a monopoly to a private corporation created solely to maximize profits is a recipe for one thing- exploitation. The Tories will be selling a license to gouge Manitobans to whatever foreign company offers the most for our crown corps, probably at a severely undervalued price, like MTS.   Privatization would be great only for greedy psychos like yourself who seem to take pleasure in seeing the poorest citizens of this province ground into the dirt even harder."

You don't get to decide the value of your house, the guy buying it does. And you probably don't even remember paying $1.50 to call Saskatoon when MTS was run (at a loss) by useless unionized government employees. It was the worst company on earth.

That's the exact same strategy that Filmon used to make the case for the sale of MTS.  BTW.  Filmon still sits on the Board of Directors for MTS and has made at least $1.4 Million from that gig alone.

Winnipeg,3c3tx9,Big_Hoss_Butt_Floss,7,Sat Jul 4 23:25:35 2015 UTC,Four things:  1).  Filmon and other Tory insiders grossly enriched themselves fom the sale.  2). Filmon explicitly said that he wouldn't privatize MTS before the 1995 election.  3). It was undervalued thereby short-changing the Manitoba taxpayer.  4). Throwing MTS under the bus made it impossible for the Province to roll-out a true affordable broadband infrastructure for all Manitobans.

Winnipeg,3c3tx9,Big_Hoss_Butt_Floss,3,Sun Jul 5 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"On point 2 there is a case to be made that Filmon actually lied but Selinger actually changed his mind, which is, in fact different.  The evidence for Filmon lying (i.e: he had previous intent) is that his government had consultants working on the sale in January of 1995 - months before he said he had no plans to sell MTS.  As for Selinger, the visceral reaction against the raising of the PST by several members Cabinet serves as evidence that Selinger was telling the truth when he said he woudn't raise the PST, but then changed his mind.  Stupid political move - yes, Lie.......not really."
Winnipeg,3c3tx9,WpgTroglodyte,5,Sun Jul 5 04:20:44 2015 UTC,"If it's libel, bring. it. on.  I have confidence because a statement of fact is not libelous.

Say it!  Go on.  Say it!  Say, ""Well Filmon's lie is OK because Selinger lied.""  SAY IT!   I want you to say it because the maybe it will sink in just how fukcing stupid that statement is.  ""According to the Canadian Radio Television- Telecommunication Commission (CRTC) the Filmon  government sold MTS at less than its market value.""  But what would they know about the valuation of a corporation they were heavily involved with.  The job description of a Provincial government is determined by the Legislature.  If they want to make affordable broadband available for all Manitobans, then it is within their mandate and authority to do so.  You may be happy being gouged, but plenty are not.

You can put any price tag you want on your house. It's a free country. But that doesn't determine what people are willing to pay. When something is out to market, the buyer determines what he's willing to pay. When MTS was sold, it was put out to market and the market said ""I'll give you this much"". And that's all. And what's more, what the actual fuck? When MTS was a crown Corp (you were probably not even born) we paid $1.50/min to call Saskatoon. It was a terrible company. The worst."

I don't support lying politicians and I don't historically vote Conservative, so I'm not going to say what you want just to fit your pre-determined narrative.  Selinger is a piece of shit, Filmon is a piece of shit.  In the present, Pallister is a lesser piece of shit than Selinger.  2).  You claim to fear no libel claim but refuse to affix your name to the post.  How do you justify this?  3).  The job of government is defined in the legal document of the Constitution.  That's literally the entire purpose of the Constitution; it explicitly lists the jobs of each level of government.  4).  I'm moving out of province next year as my contracted employment in this province expires in 2016.  I will probably vote Conservative and hope that they do privatize Hydro.  Good luck with that."
Winnipeg,3c3tx9,DerrickD26,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"LOL, policyalternatives.ca as your source, eh? Rock solid. And where is their source that fortifies their flippant claim that the CRTC claimed the company was undervalued? Oh, they just make the claim. I see.  Also, the CRTC is a regulatory body. It's not an investment bank. It has absolutely no experience doing high-level corporate valuation work and the idea that anybody - let alone a few bureaucrats with a narrowly defined legal expertise and no financial background - can accurately predict the closing price of a public equity share in any business is only the sort of thing somebody with less than no clue about markets would assert. Investment banks nearly always set a share valuation slightly lower than what they think the market might otherwise predict as a means for creating a market. If you set an initial share price too high you'll have the opposite of the intended effect by driving the share price lower as a result of narrowing your interest base. And this is very basic stuff. Like first year corporate finance. So you need to brush up on some basic stuff before you make easily refutable claims of conspiracies.  But yeah. Policyalternatives.ca. Can't argue with those finance wizards.  Stop writing with the flourish of a mental patient and make a relevant point every now and then. You aren't funny and most of what you write is just nonsense designed to obfuscate from the fact that you're either wrong is feeling very insecure about something. Enough already."
Winnipeg,3c3tx9,purseclutchingwasp,0,Sun Jul 5 05:45:36 2015 UTC,"Value is a interesting concept.  The value that I place on an item may be wildly different that what you, or others would.  In this instance the question is what is, or was the value of MTS when the Filmon government lied about their planned sale of MTS.  The CRTC believes that MTS was undervalued thereby robbing the Manitoba taxpayer of hundreds of Millions of dollars.  You are of the opinion that those at the CRTC haven't the financial background on which to make such an assessment.  And, that you'd find the valuation of an investment bank more palatable.  Two things here.  The first question you must ask yourself is, ""what happened to the price of the MTS shares when they hit the market?""  While I can't recall the exact numbers, the share price, which is the market determinant of the value of the company - DOUBLED in real short order.  What does that tell you?  ""That the value of MTS when it hit the market was far less than what the Filmon government pegged it to be.""  The fact that the share price DOUBLED is evidence that supports the claim of the CRTC ad restated by the CCPA that MTS was sold for far less than what it was worth.  As for the CCPA and Investment Banks.  Who crashed the World Economy?  If these geniuses in Investment Banking are so smart, so in tune with the market, so omnipotent in their intellect......how the fuck did they manage to work the world economy into such a pickle that these private individuals needed a Trillion dollar government bail out?  These are the ""Wizards of Wall Street"", the sharpest tacks in the pack.  The icons of ""Free Enterprise"" - and they got is so wrong they destroyed the lives of millions and added more than a Trillion dollars to the public debt.  So ya, I'll lend credence to the research of the CCPA because their role is not to grossly enrich themselves at the expense of you and me, their role is to critically examine public policy and provide options that in the best interests of the general public - not grab as much money from whomever regardless of the true human cost."
Winnipeg,3c3tx9,RDOmega,-1,Sun Jul 5 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"Again, you've resorted to ideological ranting so I'm just going to say two things about the valuation of something and leave it there. You're in over your head with this.  1) The value of a company today - be it multiples of EBITDA, strict asset value, etc... - does not necessarily reflect the value of something long term. The gap between those two values is what's known as speculation. Like Hydro today, MTS suffered from being a bloated crown corporation to the detriment of its own bottom line. The value in the enterprise was only realizable once it was out from underneath the government's domain. And that's what ultimately drove the share price. The investment bank underwrites a huge portion of the share purchase and goes to market at what it thinks the value is. If it happens to go significantly higher, then that's speculation on behalf of the market that the company will be able to turn itself around under it's new structure. And since you don't bother doing any research in favour of just flippantly throwing around what exists in your mind, the stock opened at $13.80. It took 6 days to even reach $14.00. The stock didn't double in value for another 3 years, and it took 6 to reach its peak of $51.55. It has since settled in around ~$27.00. So to suggest that there was some sort of conspiracy afoot on the basis of your ""facts"" is pretty weak given that your ""facts"" are almost entirely made up. Was the company truly ever valued at $51.55? Yeah. For a day. That means the market got it wrong. It doesn't set the true value of the enterprise, it's just the result of short term market dynamics and nobody should ever pay attention to short run gyrations in a stock price. That includes you. It took years of new management to bring about a material bump in the share price which is actually rare during an IPO. Generally you get a big bump after the opening bell and a slide during the afternoon when the investment bank starts dumping its shares. Not here.  2) This concept of a free lunch needs to stop. For example, Hydro is now a millstone around the Manitoba Taxpayer's neck because it's terribly mismanaged. That doesn't mean its financial problems don't exist, they just get to be handled a little differently. The losses are now socialized instead of borne by the shareholder who has the ability to hold management accountable. And MTS was no different and wouldn't be today. A) Our power is only cheap at the moment because the public utilities board won't give Hydro their wish for 2-4% rate increases every year over the next 20, so; B) Taxes need to go up to subsidize power into the Northern US. This is the exact same thing as a company ""gouging"" you for your services. We're just stuck with no other option because the Crown Corps' management is accountable to nobody but their political masters. This is a terrible setup.  Anyway, next time read something before you go off about it. The CCPA is a hilariously inept pack of ideologues who ignore anything that's even remotely counter to their position, are held to account by nobody (including themselves), and who think that an unlimited stream of resources flows from government to solve every problem imaginable. They're not a serious organization and they shouldn't be used as a source to refute complex enterprise value. They have about the same knowledge base as you do."
Winnipeg,3c3tx9,Sabo88,5,Sun Jul 5 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"Same argument used for privatizing MTS is being applied to Manitoba Hydro.  We've seen this movie before.  Whether it's the give-away of a public asset for less than it's real value to enrich those with connections to the Premier's Office, or the slavish acquiescence to the alleged ""free market"" - when people fail to respect the difference between public interest and private interest, the public interest loses.  Like the separation between Church and State, we need a better separation between Business and State.  Regardless, the value of an item is what the market will bare, and it's clear that MTS was undervalued and Filmon and his friends made Millions at the expense of the Manitoba Taxpayer.  Just like the geniuses in Investment Banking made Billions from the various taxpayers around the world.  This is why we need a better separation between Business and State.  So at the end of the day, if you want Manitoba Hydro sold off at fire sale prices and Brian Pallister and his buddies to make Millions off the sale whilst they sit on the Board of Directors for the private company that controls our electricity and natural gas, then fill your boots and vote Tory."
Winnipeg,3c3tx9,RDOmega,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:50:10 2015 UTC,"You need to separate the political from the financial if you're going to have this debate.  You also need to understand how an enterprise is valued. MTS had better prospects going forward precisely because it was sold off. What you continue to ascribe to a fire sale was a sale at fair market value. The speculative value that ends up baked into the share price is a result of the fact that new management and a departure from its status as a public enterprise now give it a much better financial outlook. Nothing came at the expense of the Manitoba Taxpayer because the Manitoba Taxpayer never would have seen that value. The status quo wasn't going to double the enterprise value. So that's a misleading assumption you need to stop applying.  And the same would likely occur with Hydro. Why? Because Hydro is a poorly run enterprise rife with political interference that causes it to undertake huge capital investments at negative net present value horizons. It's a dog in the parlance of the market. If it were ever spun off, the understanding amongst the market is that new management would need to kill most of its planned investment in favour of dumping that money back into the badly-needed maintenance of its existing grid and start running a much tighter ship. And because of that, the future value of the company would be reflected in the price of the shares going forward. Of course, the market would need a few months or even years to ensure that was the path, but they would be there to invest if it were; just like MTS. Would that mean that Hydro was sold off on an undervalued basis? No. It would mean that Hydro in its current iteration is a debt-loaded hog of an enterprise that can't run itself properly for various reasons that go beyond the competency of management. Removal of all the variables that keep it in that position would give it a brighter future.  This is the thing about Hydro. Hydro doesn't abide by the general understanding of what a crown corp should be. It's completely lost its way. The government has become so meddlesome in its affairs by using it as an unnecessary stimulus package that Manitobans are now expected to subsidize the power it sells. That's completely ass-backwards from how it's supposed to function. And it didn't have to be this way, but it is.  If Hydro only has a fire sale value attached to it anymore, you can thank the NDP over the last fifteen years, not the market.  We've seen how Hydro has been treated. The more likely outcome would've seen MTS follow a very similar path that would have brought about the endless rate increases that Hydro is lobbying to implement. Of course, you only call it gouging when a private company does it. When it's a crown corp, it's somehow justifiable even when there's absolutely no reason or merit for it."

Winnipeg,3c3tx9,DerrickD26,3,Mon Jul 6 06:47:20 2015 UTC,"Still don't see the ten seats they need to win.  I can see the Tories getting:  Assinniboia - Jim Rondeau isn't running again.  Kirkfield Park - Sharon Blady is highly competent and works it hard, but the area is naturally Tory.  Riel - Christine has had some issues and Rochel Squires (PC) has been out there for a while.  Seine River - Theresa Oswald has been exposed as the opportunist she is and the area is naturally Tory.  Southdale - Erin Selby will lose mostly because the area is naturally Tory.  St. Norbert - The area is naturally Tory and Dave Gaudreau has had a few stumbles.  Bjornson isn't running again in Gimli, so let's give that one to the Tories.  Hell even give them St. Vital because Nancy Allen isn't running again, and it's still only eight seats - they need ten.  Edit: Add article by Kevin Rollanson and formatting.    Brian Pallister's Progressive Conservative party is still entrenched in the hearts of Manitoba voters with the NDP lagging far behind.  A poll conducted for the Winnipeg Free Press by Probe Research found the Tories have the support of 46 per cent of decided voters compared with 29 per cent for Premier Greg Selinger's NDP.  The NDP have the support of 29 per cent of decided voters, according to the latest Probe Research poll.  The NDP have the support of 29 per cent of decided voters, according to the latest Probe Research poll. The Manitoba Liberals have the support of 19 per cent of decided votes, according to the latest Probe Research poll.  The Manitoba Liberals have the support of 19 per cent of decided votes, according to the latest Probe Research poll. Photo Store  Curtis Brown, Probe's vice-president, said Friday Tory support has gone up by two per cent since the last poll taken in March while the NDP has remained unchanged.  Brown said the Liberal party, under leader Rana Bokhari, dropped by one per cent to 19 per cent.  ""A couple of years ago, we saw the big dip in NDP support, and nearly nothing has happened since then,"" he said.  ""The NDP had a rough time in the legislature in the last few weeks, but while they have been battered, the NDP floor has remained intact. It's remarkable how things haven't changed.""  The poll shows the Green party has the support of five per cent of Manitobans while 17 per cent of Manitoba adults are undecided.  The poll of 1,000 Manitoba adults has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 per cent 95 per cent of the time."

Winnipeg,3c3tx9,DerrickD26,4,Sat Jul 4 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"This is the thing.  We know that the outcome of the battle waged between the PCs and the NDP in Manitoba is always determined by how well, or not, the Liberals do.  In 1988 when everyone and their dog hated - HATED the NDP, the Tories were expected to make off with more than 40 seats.  Nope.  Filmon actually lost a seat, it was the Liberals and the Meech Lake issue that made the gains at the expense of the NDP.  Fast-forward to 2015 ad while people don't like Selinger, many still like their NDP MLA and there is no Meech Lake sized issue for the Liberals to latch onto.  True they can siphon some votes, but will it be enough to give seats to the Tories? In large part that will be determined by the quality and name recognition of the candidate fielded by the Liberals in each given riding.  Already though, the Liberal brain-trust has let out a huge gasser by running their Leader against Jennifer Howard in Fort Rouge.  Naw-uh, no way is Bokhari going to beat Howard.  Jennifer has a hugh, solid core group of supporters and she bin workin it.  Because Bohkari is the Leader of the Liberals, they will pour waste a lot of resources that could have been spent elsewherehad they the sense to choose a better riding."

I don't know where you got this notion from but it doesn't hold water.  http://www.electionalmanac.com/ea/manitoba-popular-vote-results/  You will see that in the past 4 elections, the NDP vote has been enitrely consistent (a range of only 5% from their lowest to their best showing).  The Tory vote has a range of 7.51% and the Liberal vote has a range of 5.92%.  Those are levels of gross support.  If you want to look at relative performance, then you'll see that NDP support fluctuates by 10.6% of their mean, Tory support fluctuates by 18.9% of their mean, and Liberal support fluctuates by 50.9% of their mean.  The Liberal and Tory support has wide swings, and yet the last 4 election results have all been the same.  The only thing that will sink the NDP is a collapse of NDP core support."
