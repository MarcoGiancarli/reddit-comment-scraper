day9,3dsicx,TryGo202,9,Sun Jul 19 01:02:45 2015 UTC,My guess is they're doing a lot of work on it but realised that by releasing information and concepts too early they built a hype train that they couldn't deliver on. If they then restart that 2 months before release they'll get a lot more interest and potentially convert that in to sales and a strong online community. In the interim though it's better to stay quiet IMO.

day9,38dd2n,Morgin_Black,7,Thu Jun 4 09:11:06 2015 UTC,They finished Gemini Rue and the ending was a little lack lustre because it failed to explain who the characters were. It went into a ton of philosophical themes about what makes a person that person. Is it memories or their body or something more undetermined like a conscience. Whilst it was quite interesting it failed to answer fundamental questions we have about the people they've been playing for the last 12 hours. Bit of an empty ending

day9,33o07i,RDandersen,18,Fri Apr 24 04:27:17 2015 UTC,"If you're unsure of anything, read that post. It explains what's going on and why he doesn't do SC2 Dailies.   He had been open and communicative with his stream about it since he stopped them, but he admittedly made a mistake thinking that his starcraft viewerbase was watching and listening. Turns out he was just telling a bunch of hearthstone viewers why he wasn't playing starcraft."
day9,33o07i,BigWiggly1,5,Fri Apr 24 15:40:25 2015 UTC,This should be stickied here lol
day9,33o07i,Terakahn,20,Fri Apr 24 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"I believe he said that his work schedule makes it to hard for him to do Starcraft Dailies, they usually take a lot of analysis and time for him to make them at a level that he feels comfortable producing them at.  I also think that he said he switched to hearthstone because he can produce the episodes much quicker without as much work but the same production level.  That being said he is supposed to be returning for LoTV"
day9,33o07i,machiavellin,9,Fri Apr 24 03:41:12 2015 UTC,"He's just really busy with Artillery. SC2 dailies take a lot of prep work that he doesn't really have time for. I wouldn't say he's ""done"" with SC, but don't hold your breath for regular shows like we used to get. I would expect some events (maybe WCS, who knows) but I think as far as daily territory, the closest we're going to get for a while is day offs with subs or just laddering."

day9,33bkrx,Aeviaan,3,Tue Apr 21 06:02:30 2015 UTC,"I don't believe so. At the end of the last episode they mentioned being back next week and Sean had a little tangent about how they want to pick either a classic adventure game that is recognized as very good, or one that is hilariously bad."
day9,33bkrx,MustardBucket,5,Tue Apr 21 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"The Kings Quest, Mostly Walking was amazing. They had great chemistry and you could tell they loved playing the game and solving the puzzles. After The Dig, Nancy Drew and Grim Fandango, they haven't enjoyed them as much, their chemistry is off, Sean B is CONSTANTLY being interrupted by Sean P and Bill doesn't engage on a similar level that Sean B does.   Sean B is the cornerstone of the series, and even he is getting annoyed, you can tell he is itching to do the puzzles his way. In the beginning he would be careful about telling Sean P to do, or suggesting things. Now he just blatantly says do this. He tries to go into interesting topics concering the game and the mechanics, but Bill just makes a bad pun and Sean P starts doing stuff ingame that basically just says ""I don't care about what you have to say, it's annoying."""
day9,33bkrx,IHatloWomen,6,Tue Apr 21 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"If you feel that way then I can give you the recommendation to subscribe to Sean Bouchards Youtube Channel if you have not already.   He plays through interesting games such as Papo & Yo, Half Life, and currently Antichamber and gives his commentary from a game designers perspective and does a Q&A after each Play Session. It is very different from Mostly Walking, but I find it very interesting."
day9,33bkrx,Nooby1990,2,Tue Apr 21 14:58:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe don't overanalyze things (you're right though), I hate to think they would read this and try to change in some way.  The problem is just finding a game that they enjoy. I think they should play Broken Age Act 1."
day9,33bkrx,IHatloWomen,4,Tue Apr 21 14:44:29 2015 UTC,"Even if they read it, they would disregard it, it's just one opinion, you learn to deal with the negative critique when you're internet famous.  Yeah if they found something as engaging and fun as Kings Quest it would probably get back on track.   I'm confused though, why did you make this post? They aren't cancelling mostly walking."
day9,33bkrx,cleh1,6,Tue Apr 21 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"...What? They aren't canceling.  Sean (Plott) said that the only way the show would end is if they were ""cancelled.""  Bill questioned the term ""cancelled"" since they weren't owned by a network, which Plott clarified by saying that they would have to cancel themselves.  (And at one point joked about ""rage-cancelling"" a stream if the chat's being rude.) EDIT: found it  But it was just a joke.  At the end of the show, Day9 said they'll be back next week, and they're deciding if they want to play a classic game, or a straight up shitty game."

day9,33bkrx,Marscall,4,Tue Apr 21 17:03:31 2015 UTC,I think they should do Day Of The Tentacle to regain their chemistry. It's quite chill and funny and they could relax more instead of following a big conceptual plot like Grim.
day9,33bkrx,Terakahn,3,Tue Apr 21 16:15:55 2015 UTC,It's totally not being cancelled. It was a joke. They have too much fun most of the time. Even if some of the games can get tiresome during the latter parts the overall show is entertaining and fun.
day9,33bkrx,solarparade,3,Tue Apr 21 17:05:42 2015 UTC,Don't scare me like this. That's not even fair.

He talked about the kittens and ninja stars that night. I need to rewatch it because it is such a great tool to help myself to stay positive even when things aren't going right."

day9,32ta47,scotty3281,9,Thu Apr 16 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"I've never played SC2 or Hearthstone but he has been my favorite streamer/Youtuber of all time.  His Day Off games are always fun to watch (Antichamber, Ori and the Blind Forest, Psychonauts, and so much more) and his personal stories always makes me want to watch more of his videos.  His relationship with the viewers seems like I am a close friend of his and I get to hear his thoughts, from him working on Project Atlas to talking about his pet cats.  His more emotional stuff is always something I think back on and it's something I try to live by.  I also love Mostly Walking, in which he and two other people play point-and-click adventures and I loved their playthrough of The Dig and their current game, Grim Fandango."
day9,32ta47,wondertwins,3,Thu Apr 16 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"I was trying to explain this to someone yesterday but couldn't find the words. They asked me why I'm always watching his stream ""So he's like really good at this game or something?"" they'd ask. Lol not really. I watch for the laughs and the optimism and the way he treats others. Don't we all wish we could be more like Sean in those regards?"
day9,32ta47,Penguin474,2,Thu Apr 16 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"I found Day9 way back in highschool, and got immediately hooked. My friends and I used to get on Skype and watch his dailies together just for the entertainment value (Silver player life).  I consider myself to be a social chameleon, adapting my personality to the positive influences I see around me. The more I saw Sean stream, the more I tried to be just like him. I've watched his video on being relentlessly positive an uncomfortable amount of times, and even got friends who were in rough places to watch it as well. Sean Plott has helped improve the lives of so many people just by doing what he loves.  There is no bigger inspiration in my life than Day9, I've become the man I am because of him, and I dream to one day meet the guy.  It's funny, Sean has no idea who I am but he's built me from the ground up. He made me into a better person, and I've done what I can to positively influence the lives of those around me as well. A big chain of positivity erupting from this radiant source of inspiration. Thank you, Day[9]."

day9,32ta47,Lothrazar,-3,Fri Apr 17 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"Day9 inspires you to be better. That's wonderful.  However,  There are undoubtly days where Day9 wants to tell someone to go fuck themselves. Don't compare your-behind-the-scenes footage to someone else's highlight reel.  You see Day9 at his best. It's great to use that as inspiration. Just don't put him on a pedestal in the process.  Putting someone on a pedestal means 2 things.  1) that they can't fail or that they don't fail. Everyone fails.  2) that the values you are placing on the pedestal are un-achievable for yourself. You can be as kind, as positive and nice as Day9.   Lastly, ""fake it until you feel it"". One of the best life hacks that a person can have. Act positive and eventually you'll feel it."

I watched his content for a solid few months, and loved every second of it. Then he must have been casting at some tournament that I managed to catch, and he was casting with the illustrious Day9 himself!  From there I found the dailies and the rest was history.

Lucky for me, that first daily I tuned in for was the daily, the 100th one.   My first reaction was shock. I don't think I had ever seen someone so passionate about something, let alone a video game. My first reaction was something like 'Really dude? It's just a game, why do you care so much?' but I kept watching and he soon changed my opinion and won me 'round; I was utterly absorbed by his story. From that day forward I was an avid Day9 fan."

I was pretty terrible at the game, and kept hearing people say ""go watch Day9 for help"" in forums. I was pretty new to Twitch, having only watched stuff like Siglemic streaming Mario 64, but I hopped over just as he was starting a show.   It wasn't even about SC2 at all. He was going into a lengthy story-time about Magic, I game I hadn't played since high school, ten plus years ago. He was explaining his experience at a recent grand prix or something and going over the basic rules of the game. Every time he said ""tap"" he made this funny turning-sideways gesture with his hands.   I was hooked, and have been a DayKnight ever since, following for SC2, Hearthstone, Mostly Walking, and whatever comes next!"

day9,31617u,Exzodium,16,Thu Apr 2 07:03:52 2015 UTC,He said in a daily that even though LotV beta is coming that he won't be doing Starcraft Dailies simply because they are too time consuming and he doesn't have the time to do them. He said he may do some more SC2 content in the future but not right now.

day9,31617u,zabuma,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"I was never a huge fan of SC2, but I loved watching his Dailies. I'd be so happy with even a weekly LotV show; stretching out the preparation time over 7+ days would hopefully make that fit into his schedule."
day9,31617u,sirchumley,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'd go with that. One show a week would make a lot of people angry and he'd probably lose fans. Maybe if he gradually dropped to one show a week, maybe that would work. But five a week to just one? He'd definitely lose fans."
day9,31617u,safetyseal,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"Oh nonono, I meant that Sean could do a LotV show once a week on Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday in place of a Decktacular. He used to do Starcraft almost every single day, but with Funday Monday switching to the much lower-stress Mostly Walking and Friday becoming his Day Off, I don't see the need to return to a literal Daily.  If he actually only streamed once per week I would be so sad :("

day9,31617u,AhWarlin,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:30:07 2015 UTC,"It would be about the same. He'd have to decide what he was going to play, what his build path would be, then also take the same amount of time to set up the stream and do all things technical that are related to running the stream. I could see him doing a LotV Campaign Day-off play-through but I'm not sure about weekdays."
day9,31617u,safetyseal,3,Thu Apr 2 14:02:20 2015 UTC,That's not why he stopped. And won't stop him from doing sc content. It's just too much to be doing dailies either sacrificing other important areas of day9.tv
day9,30x0cd,unverified_user,9,Tue Mar 31 11:57:44 2015 UTC,They really need to pay more attention to where Manny is looking. The amount of times they clicked through Velasco and used the rusty anchor with the tattoo binder killed me. The mouse controls are pretty poorly implemented honestly and it is really negatively affecting their experience with Grim Fandango.
day9,30x0cd,Csmidge,6,Tue Mar 31 12:19:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for this discussion. It's good to know that some of their frustrations are due to the remaster and not the original game. I'm definitely a fan of trying to play the classics in their original state (not always possible with PC games though sadly). The Monkey Island re-issues, for example, are way more fun imo with the original graphics and control scheme."
day9,30q91n,WolfgangSho,5,Sun Mar 29 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"I have never used a hypergeometric distribution, but people might be curious how you can solve this without a special calculator. You can use any calculator that can compute binomial coefficients (though you can break that down into factorials and then simple multiplication, but that gets hairy).  I reasoned the formula like this. Every probability problem is represented by the number of equally likely successes divided by the number of equally likely possibilities. In this case, its the number of ways to get Y out of X good cards in the deck of N total cards in Z draws divided by the number of ways to draw Z cards out of N total. This denominator is easy: the number of hands of Z cards out of N total is (N choose Z) <- this is pretty much the definition of binomial coefficient, which is why its so simple.  The numerator is a little trickier, but not much more difficult. If you think about what a successful hand looks like, you know it must have Y ""good cards"". This means Z - Y cards are bad. This means the number of successful hands is the number of ways to get the good cards (X choose Y) times the number of ways to get the bad cards ((N - X) choose (Z - Y)). This means that out final formula is  / X \  *  / N - X \ \ Y /     \ Z - Y / --------------------         / N \         \ Z /   or  (X choose Y) ((N - X) choose (Z - Y)) -------------------------------------             (N choose Z)   This formula gives the same answer as the calculator (for the ones I tried)."

day9,2zf2vs,Finaglers,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"I'll try to hit the big points, because of how complex the answer is: This criticism comes from the long running reputation of how slow and ineffective blizzard is at communication.    Blizzard has taken months and sometimes as long as years to post replies to their forums. This has had an effect on diminished gameplay.  Instead of listening to the community of players, Blizzard has made very poor decisions to give players what they want. For example, despite years of players telling Blizzard that the SH is a boring and game-breaking unit, Blizzard still will not comment to the gameplay aspect of the unit.  They're just now changing the SH after years of comments.   I compare Blizzard to other game companies who change their game on a weekly basis to accommodate the community, and give players what they want."

day9,2zf2vs,CombatMagic,-7,Wed Mar 18 01:30:48 2015 UTC,"He was banning people from twitter who asked about StarCraft... he didn't made comments or reason... he just stopped... Destiny thinks he will come back for some LotV cash, a week or two of hype... and march away again..."
day9,2zf2vs,Corne777,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:34:49 2015 UTC,"LotV cash? What does that even mean? I don't think him doing starcraft dailies would bring him in much more money. If anything he would lose views I bet. And if you have watched day9 ever, you know he isn't doing this for the money.    Like other people have said, starcraft dailies take time to prep. With his full time job he doesn't have time to prep them. He can make good hearthstone content or subpar starcraft. I think it would be cool if he could prep maybe one sc2 daily a week or something, or every other week. Just to show people who doubt that he is still in the game."
day9,2zf2vs,CombatMagic,0,Wed Mar 18 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"Fact is he didn't say he don't have enough time... he banned people who asked... time is an excuse that other people say, who are blind to realize he didn't made a daily on starcraft for 3 months... he is not on the game anymore... Destiny is right, Destiny explained it better, but Sean will come proclaiming love for SC2 after all this time, and will march away as soon as the hype for LotV starts to fade... is a job for him now, not passion as before..."
day9,2zf2vs,Corne777,0,Wed Mar 18 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"So he took 3 months off, in how many years? 6? What is three months in comparison? A small break to pursue other things and people lose faith in his passion? I don't buy it."

day9,2yywny,FireKong,30,Sat Mar 14 00:12:41 2015 UTC,"Sean stuck with his SC casting longer than I imagine anyone expected him to. But with tighter time constraints, and the fact that most people just arent interested enough to tune in to that kind of content.   Do I miss SC content? Sure. Do I think it's a moneygrab for him to come back to SC casting? That's a load of shit. You could tell him he'll make no money doing dailies and I bet he'd still do it when LotV comes out. I would also bet that he still has less viewership numbers with LotV than he will doing a hearthstone cast.  To fault him for making a certain career choice is just plain stupid though. Let's not pretend that he doesn't have more love of SC than probably anyone you've ever met.   Edit: Just wanted to mention that I WOULD like to hear from Day9 stating why he left the SC2 scene completely, and sort of explain to his fanbase why he made the decision he did. Obviously no one's faulting him for it, but a little heads up probably would've been appreciated. It's not so much upsetting as it is confusing."
day9,2yywny,Terakahn,8,Sat Mar 14 06:35:45 2015 UTC,"Paraphrasing from what he has mentioned over the last few months.  SC2 scene has been stagnant for a long time, he started working on his own RTS game and he just doesn't have the time for the pre planning and prep work to do the justice to his SC2 dailies. Since on the other hand he can just roll home and do a hearthstone stream which he enjoys and people like watching with minimal effort."
day9,2yywny,Cheekything,2,Sat Mar 14 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"Also, what is the problem with going after the money, the thing that brings the most money is obviously the most popular in the audience... Your literally catering to the audience if you do what is popular."
day9,2yywny,Shubb,2,Sat Mar 14 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"That's not what his show was ever about. But I see where you're coming from. I get that things evolve, and from a business standpoint it was a sensible decision. But in a lot of ways day9 js synonymous with starcraft. To be doing no content feels like a self betrayal of his roots."
day9,2yywny,Terakahn,14,Sat Mar 14 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"It's not truly about Day9, this doesn't deserve to be here. The title on both subreddits is sensationalized toward a figurehead that most people respect for clickbait."
day9,2yywny,Afez,5,Sat Mar 14 05:23:21 2015 UTC,Destiny posted this in the thread saying Day9 wasn't a major offender of what he's talking about.

day9,2yywny,Sythe64,3,Sat Mar 14 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"Well Destiny is a really smart guy. He doesn't show it all the time but he is. And a lot of the things he's said would happen, came to pass. His delivery just wasn't optimal for affecting real change. In a lot of ways starcraft reminds me of Destiny. This game with mountains of potential and a very said fan base, but development choices caused it to sour and not be all that we know it could be.   Just to clarify, I've been a fan of Destiny since his pro player days. I still remember that friendsday Wednesday day9 did with him on it. That was a really good show. But after he stopped playing professionally, I think he embraced his asshole side a lot more. Hence the Destiny you saw on inside the game."
day9,2yywny,Terakahn,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:38:41 2015 UTC,I really like both him and Day9. I actually was wondering what had happened to Day9 until I saw this. Day9s contents is still good and I enjoy it watching. I just enjoyed his SC2 content more.   Destiny is rough around the edges but he speaks his mind and as far as I've seen doesn't pander to people.
day9,2yywny,Sythe64,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"People keep saying he left Starcraft.....and I'm so fucking confused. He made a Starcraft Daily a couple months ago (I know it's the internet, but that isn't a long time) and he cast Blizzcon and most of the Redbull Tournaments this year. He simply doesn't have time to do a ton of dailies and Hearthstone is just easier to do a show on. He never left, he took a very short break. (He's been doing dailies for what, four years? Three months of a break from doing dailies isn't long.)"
day9,2yywny,lighto73,-5,Sun Mar 15 08:48:36 2015 UTC,"I really like Day9 and his community, But I don't want this to happen."
day9,2yywny,JasonSteelflex,5,Sat Mar 14 00:13:59 2015 UTC,"well banning people for asking questions is kinda silly, for a person who, many times, have said he looooves his community.. but apparently only if they dont ask questions.   I mean, he doesnt have to answer on twitter. he could just some out with a statement about it on his site or in a video"
day9,2yywny,Terakahn,3,Sat Mar 14 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"Hasn't he talked about the amount of time that goes into a SC daily as opposed to Hearthstone? With his work at Atlas, I was under the impression that he didn't really have the time to put into those dailies. I could be wrong, and I don't have an episode number or anything to back this up, but I remember him mentioning it before"
day9,2yywny,automatica7,6,Sat Mar 14 16:23:55 2015 UTC,"Imagine you're asked tha same questions thousands of times per day. I'd get sick of it too, everyone has limits."
day9,2yywny,Cheekything,2,Sat Mar 14 06:32:22 2015 UTC,answer it once and you wont be asked again?
day9,2yywny,automatica7,4,Sat Mar 14 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe he has many times, maybe people don't listen, maybe people just love popcorn drama."
day9,2yywny,Cheekything,-1,Sat Mar 14 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"but the whole point of this is that he ditched starcraft, a game that in many ways made him who he is. now he wont have anything to do with starcraft, and wont even respond to his fans. they just want to know why he left and never said goodbye.... because we all loved him, and then one day he decided to never even speak about sc ever again. and yeah people do love drama thats for sure....   but aside from all the drama lovers that just want to stir shit... there were some sc players that loved sean... me being one of them. and they want answers, so i cant blame them for asking. just my thoughts anyway."
day9,2yywny,RDR911,2,Sat Mar 14 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"The things is as I and other keep saying he has said why he left the scene.  Just people ignore that or want him to answer them directly.  The tl:dr is he has his own game, it takes up a lot of his time, he no longer has the prep time to give the justice he once gave to making an episode. He just enjoys hearthstone a lot more."
day9,2yywny,FirelordAlex,-21,Sun Mar 15 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"Well he's gotta keep up that 30 under 30 lifestyle. If that means alienating your original fan base only to milk them for maybe a month of content, so be it"

day9,2xm5r5,kangamooster,3,Mon Mar 2 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"I really feel like he might be done with SC. I felt like the last couple of dailies were entirely fan pleasers and he barely knew the meta and just seemed to have very little interest. There are so many dailies at this point I feel like most of everything important he has to say on strategy has been said and the meta is not fixed so its almost pointless doing shows on the current meta because by the time someone else watches it, it will have entirely changed. I however would LOVE  Heroes weekly lengthy episode with his friends, they've daily been the funnest dailies in a long time."
day9,2xm5r5,nationalmaverick,2,Mon Mar 2 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"Would love to see a regular Heroes feature as well. I don't think he'll ever go back to SC2 fully like in the past, because the genre in general has just been shoved aside a bit by MOBAs and other multiplayer games.

He has explained why he stopped his SC2 dailies more than a thousand times. Pretty easy to find it by using Google or even reading other posts in this reddit.   Yet, people ask, ask and ask again the exact same question. I can't imagine how annoying it is to him. As a long time viewer and fan, it even annoys me to see such attitudes, looks like people do this on purpose just to annoy him.  Needless to say that I won't answer, I've seen questions and answers to this in the previous (most recent) posts, and a thousand more in older posts. Do a quick search to get answers instead of throwing questions to the others."
day9,2xm5r5,frozenpt,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"I've been watching him since he was still doing brood war dailies. And I didn't hear him state why he stopped. I read about someone saying he wanted to take a break after 700 episodes, but found nothing official from him. Even just a tweet saying why. Nope. Can I make assumptions on why? Of course. Anyone can. And mine would probably be fairly accurate. But I still haven't found anything from him personally. Maybe I'm not looking in the right place.   By not answering all you're doing is perpetuating the problem. Would it be so terrible to have a stickied announcement answering what is likely the most asked question these days?"

""He posted a new video almost two weeks ago, explaining in the comments that  Hey guys,  I have really been taking the last couple months to take care of myself mentally and physically.  There has been a ton of stuff going on behind the scenes that I have been working on as well as just enjoying gaming for what its meant to be, FUN!  It has been a learning experience for me to just take a step back and watch all the events, play new games, and just enjoy life and gaming. I never want to make videos just to make them, I want to do what is most fun, honest, and sincere for me.  I will say though, I definitely should update all of you more on whats going on. That is totally my bad and is something I know I am terrible at.  Thank you to everyone for the kind words and especially patience.   so he's still around, ﻿he's just been taking a break.

I'm not sure if he said anything during his last attempt at doing SC dailies, but he has explained and answered multiple times during his other streams,  including Day Off and Decktacular series.  So I guess you haven't truly been watching, you watched.  Day9 is somewhat moved away from SC2?  Destiny rant about Day9 coming back to LotV  Both pretty recent posts, first from 3 weeks and the second from yesterday. One has a pretty similar title while the other merely relates to this issue. Both easy to find and both contain the answer.  There is no point in answering imo, it has been answered way too many times. I just gave 2 examples of how easy it truly is to find and answer without bothering others with a spam of the same question. It is pure laziness."
day9,2xm5r5,frozenpt,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:39:15 2015 UTC,Both recent. Neither actually answer why he left. Even Destiny says in the video that he left without an official explanation. But this is pointless. And it's something neither of us will agree on. So I'll make peace and leave it as it is.

Do you not like your cats anymore or what? You get bitten by one of them like, 10 times each show?  I feel he didn't realize all the crappy things that comes along with having cats until a few months later. (which includes meowing excessively at dinner, claws(which he said didn't even trim nails in weeks, yet) I think he should have gotten a lap cat than high energy young kittens who can, and will chew on things, and even disrupt the program if they get on the desk and then... yet if he knew it just seems like some sort of prop to keep viewers interested cause internet automatically likes cats or something? Seriously? It's just really distracting and sometimes they just press a button on his desk or w/e.  Downvoted most likely (lol), but seriously, as a long time watcher, I like his show but the cats are just...no.

day9,2wn4kn,Boredpotatoe2,11,Sat Feb 21 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"This is correct, and the reason he always gives to this question. His Starcraft dailies, and Funday Monday especially, were very time consuming to prepare - he had to stay current with the meta, search through replays to find a good topic to present, etc. With Hearthstone or his days off, he just finds a deck/game and plays it with very little preparation."

day9,2wn4kn,Terakahn,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:55:35 2015 UTC,I'm curious. People are calling hearthstone a pay to win game. Does this mean you also consider magic the gathering a pay to win game?
day9,2wn4kn,CptHampton,15,Sat Feb 21 20:16:25 2015 UTC,MtG doesn't call itself free to play
day9,2wn4kn,Terakahn,1 point,Sat Feb 21 22:27:29 2015 UTC,"No, but you certainly get an advantage buying the more expensive cards. I think the last competitive deck I built was around $400 value."
day9,2wn4kn,frydchiken333,4,Sat Feb 21 22:31:27 2015 UTC,"But ""pay to win"" is generally a phrase used to describe ""free to play"" games as a criticism of the advertised pay mechanic. If you play MtG, you know you'll have to pay for the cards you want. In Hearthstone, you'll theoretically have to go through a huge grind to get the cards you want for free, or simply pay money to avoid it.   IMO Hearthstone isn't really ""pay to win,"" it's just ""pay to accelerate how fast you can start winning if ranking on ladder is what you like about the game."" People give money to Blizzard because they want to be competitive fast and obviously think avoiding the grind is worth paying money for, otherwise they just wouldn't pay."
day9,2wn4kn,KaptainKrunch,4,Sat Feb 21 22:49:54 2015 UTC,That's fair. People are impatient ;)
day9,2wn4kn,mikkjel,4,Sat Feb 21 23:06:04 2015 UTC,"Another fair bit about mtg cards is that many amazingly OP cards are not that expensive. Some of the pricy cards are just the super rare collector items.  Plus it's a trading card game, so you can trade a ""$5"" card for a ""$4"" card with no real money involved. Can't do that in hearthstone."
day9,2wn4kn,thepciet,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:49:41 2015 UTC,"If they can develop a 'trading card' aspect into hearthstone, it would be much more dynamic.  Limited editions of cards etc. etc."
day9,2wn4kn,Enlightnd,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:26:58 2015 UTC,There is something to be said for the fact that a lot of people who compete at the highest level do not pay for their own cards - they merely borrow them from a sponsoring store or friends.
day9,2wn4kn,Fillelito,2,Sun Feb 22 06:11:58 2015 UTC,"Best term I've heard for competitive Magic is ""Pay to Compete"".  Drop your $100-$500, then it's all about metagame knowledge and play skill. That baseline entry cost is different per format due to availability of the competitive / popular cards.  Magic is only pay to win if you can't afford it."
day9,2wn4kn,RDR911,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I've played since the start as purely F2P and won and lost my fair share, but there's cards that have been strong in the meta for a long time and new ones from the GnG expansion that I don't have which make it really hard for me to get anywhere above rank 12. I've been able to craft a ton of the cards I need over this time, but as for Legendary's, I'm still missing all the important ones and I'm missing even more important ones from GnG.  You can't get into high ranks without some specific cards.  That said, I still enjoy hearthstone, I like playing as underdog beating the odds and sometimes beating decks that are used by the top Ranked players.  Even if you throw a ton of money at the game to get all the cards and copy deck lists from the pro's, you still won't reach high ranks and a smuck like me with nothing but F2P cards can still wipe the floor with you."
day9,2wn4kn,Cheekything,1 point,Sun Feb 22 01:10:17 2015 UTC,I like to think that he's working up a large audience to then switch back to sc2. Giving sc2 a boost of viewers :D
day9,2wn4kn,square965,-18,Sun Feb 22 07:20:56 2015 UTC,He should really just change the description on his website. He hasn't been relevant to the SC scene for so long that it feels like he doesn't care about it and is becoming another p2wstone streamer.
day9,2wn4kn,Rainblast,9,Sat Feb 21 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"You sound a bit bitter.  He still does casting, however as with many popular youtube/streamer people he lost enjoyment with the game.  Then you have to realise that hearthstone is popular, it has a bigger player base than SC, Day9 enjoys it and more people are willing to watch him stream it.  Lastly there is no P2W in hearthstone, there is pay to remove grind. Unless there is a secret hidden cardback that only streamers can buy that gives them the best RNG."
day9,2wn4kn,DoubleDot,-10,Sat Feb 21 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"I guess that depends on your definition of pay-to-win. I've never played Hearthstone, and I don't know anything about it, but I happen to agree with the urbandictionary definition of pay to win:   pay-to-win Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.   So if you can pay for better gear and receive it instantly, while other people have to grind for it, that's Pay to Win IMO. The exception that comes to mind is if you can buy side-grades, like the alternative weapons in TF2.  What is the case in Hearthstone?"
day9,2wn4kn,ballssss,8,Sat Feb 21 18:10:20 2015 UTC,"Multiple people have demonstrated reaching legend rank without paying dollars on new accounts.  Skill is greater than collection size, but collection size greatly increases the variety of decks you can make.  Having the cards without the skill gets you absolutely nothing.  TotalBiscuit is the clearest example; he plays for fun and is fun to watch, but is horrible at the game and plays with tons of legendary cards."
day9,2wmlv2,schnelle,4,Sat Feb 21 04:51:18 2015 UTC,I didnt even know he ever talked about such things online.   I need to see this! please someone find this :D

day9,2wmlv2,Drovious17,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:18:42 2015 UTC,This does sound like a funday monday description related to the conversation (or lack of) the players were having in game.
day9,2wh86v,cleh1,12,Thu Feb 19 22:02:18 2015 UTC,It's phenomenal how they managed to turn 2 hours watching Day[9] doing sudoku into an enjoyable experience. Love Mostly Walking more and more every week.

day9,2wh86v,double_shadow,4,Fri Feb 20 00:05:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're definitely a three man team. Sean P. brings the gameplay, Sean B. brings the insight, and Bill brings the funnies. I also love Sean B's reactions. Just the truly sincere laughter always makes me laugh even harder.  I didn't expect the Sean Claude Van Dos show to work out, but it was still really entertaining."

day9,2tp3wp,xyviel,23,Mon Jan 26 07:16:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he always plays at the hardest difficulty setting. But he has a tendency to be completely incapable of reading and following instructions."
day9,2tp3wp,Terrafire123,2,Mon Jan 26 11:05:18 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. I have no problem seeing someone fail, I fail all the time at video games xD. But I was astonished to see someone who used to play Brood War at a very high level and who is now in game design pay so little attention to the game's mechanisms and instructions.  I can't remember the details, but I was really uncomfortable with his ""my way or the highway"" attitude during the Company of Heroes playthrough, especially considering how much of a gem that game is. I've stopped watching Days Off since (esp. considering it's very time consuming)."
day9,2tp3wp,xyviel,3,Tue Jan 27 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"The problem is that he's running a show, not playing a game, and because of that, he needs to do things a certain way. For example, 75% of the text that he reads, he reads aloud. (because some people are listening to it in the background?) People get bored if he does too much tutorial, so he tends to fast-forward.  He's much better at games with obvious rules, or games where figuring out the instructions is part of the game(Puzzle Games)."
day9,2tp3wp,Terrafire123,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:14:10 2015 UTC,"By those standards, I'm glad he doesn't play RPGs. That being said, I don't think that's true: neither Company of Heroes nor Age of Mythology have particularly steep learning curves. They're not Paradox games à la Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis IV. They just have their own identity that requires you to adapt (a little) to their style. For some reason, that has completely eluded Day9.  I'm arguing for the sake of argument though, I really don't care. I've stopped watching out of frustration, but thousands of others do watch, and that's perfectly fine. To each his own."
day9,2tp3wp,xyviel,3,Tue Jan 27 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"Oh god, you just reminded me of his Age of Mythology day off. Yeah... I'm fine with him not playing other strategy games."

day9,2tp3wp,not-lenny,2,Mon Jan 26 07:24:34 2015 UTC,"i'd love to see that too; hopefully he'll spend at least some time with it. it played something like a Supreme Commander with slightly simplified mechanics, but since it's 2015, i'm sure there's more under the surface that he'd understand."
day9,2tp3wp,sanguination,2,Mon Jan 26 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"Probably not, he doesn't do a lot of new releases."
day9,2tp3wp,JamesKrell,2,Mon Jan 26 07:11:46 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. I would watch him do online play but I don't think it'd be fun to watch him play 1 player campaign. It's not really an action packed game and I think that'll hurt the viewing experience. Plus, the units aren't interesting on their own so there aren't too many things we could see him do.  It's not a bad game, it's just that it's not that interesting to watch imo."

I think it could fit his channel quite well. I mean it used to be a StarCraft only project and a lot of the older subscribers should dig RTS content in general.  He could even do a GG Daily. Just one. Just for me. Please. That would even solve the 'issue' of him trying to force his playstyle onto the game, because he'd have to dig deeper and prepare the strategy talk beforehand."

day9,2rxdld,slam7211,16,Sat Jan 10 02:50:20 2015 UTC,"I think he is just on a Hearthstone stint. There's a new expansion, and he's been having a lot of fun."
day9,2rxdld,safetyseal,15,Sat Jan 10 03:01:23 2015 UTC,"His last SC2 video was just before the release of the Hearthstone Expansion. He also took two weeks off for the holidays. I think it's safe to say that he will be doing more SC2, just right now he's doing Hearthstone.   Though, he could also take a hiatus on SC2 until we get close to LotV, which I would be OK with."
day9,2rxdld,lighto73,6,Sat Jan 10 07:41:41 2015 UTC,"No recent changes in the metagame, no recent interesting matches to discuss strategy.  I feel like there's nothing for him to say about SC2 right now."
day9,2rxdld,omfgforealz,3,Mon Jan 12 02:49:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, I just feel like the sudden break from his regular schedule was a bit frustrating, an announcement would have been nice, instead of having to post a thread on reddit"
day9,2rxdld,omfgforealz,1 point,Mon Jan 12 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"I agree it's frustrating, but it's not really sudden.  He's been phasing in HS for a long time."
day9,2rxdld,Terrafire123,14,Mon Jan 12 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"Problem is that Day9's already said roughly everything can possibly be said on the subject. He has 726 hours of Day[9] Daily videos. What else can you want?   When Legacy of the Void comes out and changes the Meta, I'm sure he'll be back."

A lot of the competitive mindset Sean's always preached -- not being afraid of the ladder, how to make mistakes and learn, etc. -- can be shown just as easily in Hearthstone, where he's having more fun atm."
day9,2rxdld,sdflack,-1,Sat Jan 10 20:01:10 2015 UTC,SC2 is dead.
day9,2rxdld,Hithard_McBeefsmash,2,Sat Jan 10 06:09:26 2015 UTC,SC2 isn't dead. HoN is dead.
day9,2rxdld,Krobolt,-41,Sat Jan 10 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"boring as shit compared to Dota2 anyways  needs like 10 more units per race  edit: I was being facetious, but I do believe for the most part that Dota2  is a more interesting, exciting, and more importantly living game than SC2. The meta changes drastically every few months due to the big patches, and there are moderate changes within patches as it is. Sc2 is totally different, it feels very static. Not fresh in the slightest. It's hard to see it as exciting."
day9,2rxdld,Hithard_McBeefsmash,15,Sat Jan 10 06:15:44 2015 UTC,"needs like 10 more units per race   Yeah, with this statement you obviously know nothing about the game."
day9,2rxdld,Krobolt,2,Sat Jan 10 07:57:02 2015 UTC,"I watched SC2 from Day9's king of the hill up to when Taeja was fucking GSL up for TL (maybe he still is? Don't know). Easily 2 years.  I mostly watch Dota2 now. It's just more exciting. SC2 has lost all of its freshness. In Dota, things get boring after a few months. But there's always a new patch that turns things on their head in an exciting way. SC2 is completely lacking this. You're probably right, just throwing in more units isn't a magic fix. On top of that, there need to be significant changes to in-game, competitive content every few months to keep things fresh.  It's like World of Warcraft, but you get one expansion every 10 years, and small patches every two years. Boring as shit. Who's going to watch that? I bought Wings of Liberty. Why the hell would I spend that much money on Hots or LOv? For my purposes, and for 80% of people's purposes, they're the same game."
day9,2rxdld,Hithard_McBeefsmash,5,Sat Jan 10 08:14:37 2015 UTC,"I guess I judged too quickly. You're right, adding more units won't automatically make the game exciting. There are some fairly fundamental changes that need to be made in order for that to happen, IMO.  But a minor nitpick, since everything else you say is mostly opinion and I don't really feel like debating right now...   I bought Wings of Liberty. Why the hell would I spend that much money on Hots or LOv? For my purposes, and for 80% of people's purposes, they're the same game.   Not really true. Blizzard says that, of the people that have bought SC2, only 50% of them have ever actually touched the multiplayer, and far fewer have gone far enough in the multiplayer to play consistently.  So for most people (the 50%+ that just play campaign), the expansions are absolutely worth it just for the story content alone."
day9,2rxdld,dcm628,-1,Sat Jan 10 08:26:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought we were discussing StarCraft's regression as an esport, not whether it's commercially successful.  I barely touched multiplayer, I'm total trash at it. But I watched a ton of pro SC2. I had many friends in the same boat, it's quite common. So my perspective is that of someone who was once very interested in StarCraft as an esport (listened to sotg every week, etc.) and who is now completely disconnected from the scene. I only watch Day9's non-SC videos.  I would never deny that SC is financially successful, I don't think that's a problem Blizzard needs to be worried about. And if that's all they care about, not its success as an esport, then I guess they don't have any problems."
day9,2rxdld,Hithard_McBeefsmash,0,Sat Jan 10 08:34:20 2015 UTC,"DOTA sucks.  SC2 will be back for LOTV, Blizzard let the game stagnate after they got HOTS to where they wanted it."

day9,2rxdld,Brokenmonalisa,-8,Sat Jan 10 06:25:13 2015 UTC,"Dota sucks? Sorry, but I beg to differ. Dota is one of the best and most well polished games in existence."
day9,2rxdld,amac109,6,Sat Jan 10 06:46:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt go that far. It's pretty good and as far as esports go had totally blown SC2 out of the water, but best and most polished games in existence? Please."
day9,2rxdld,M_Cicero,-2,Sat Jan 10 07:37:23 2015 UTC,Dota is the king of esports right now. Even Day9 has expressed interest in playing the game on stream.
day9,2rxdld,amac109,2,Sat Jan 10 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think league of legends has the esports title at the moment by any objective measure. That's not to say it's a more competitive game, but it is definitely more popular than dota 2."
day9,2rxdld,captain_zavec,-4,Sat Jan 10 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"Popular yes. But competitive? No. Dota 2's scene is a lot more professional, it also has Valve backing it. TI4 alone is a testament to that."
day9,2rxdld,Inoka1,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"You've totally missed /u/Brokenmonalisa's point. It doesn't matter if it's the king of esports or if Day9 wants to play it, both of those are absolutely not the same thing as ""one of the best and most well-polished games in existence,"" which is a very big title and not one I would give to Dota."
day9,2rxdld,tomastaz,1 point,Sat Jan 10 17:57:33 2015 UTC,"So I just counted. As of today, not counting the holiday SC2 arcade games he played, Day9 has done 71 videos since his last SC2 daily. That's, like, mega disappointing :("

day9,2qbmk2,Finaglers,1 point,Thu Dec 25 06:37:06 2014 UTC,I think its because blizzard doesn't pay much attention to it either compared to their other games.

day9,2pj7mi,RDR911,4,Wed Dec 17 10:39:43 2014 UTC,And also works full time at a game studio. He can't really create the same in depth show anymore.
day9,2pj7mi,BARDLER,3,Wed Dec 17 18:51:48 2014 UTC,Well that and there is a huge lack of content to cover when nothing is really going on.  Expansion is likely to change that.
day9,2pj7mi,Cheekything,2,Fri Dec 19 09:47:51 2014 UTC,He can't get the GSL or SSL replays can he? Either way I really enjoy the non starcraft content. I do wish we could get newbie tuesday back :(
day9,2piqiu,24816842,8,Tue Dec 16 23:29:47 2014 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Day9 but he doesn't really interact with his community much at all in my experience. He never responds to people on twitter, very rarely responds on this subreddit, as far as I know never responds to e-mails and doesn't advertise a fan e-mail address or etc. At events he seems super nice and interactive but online he doesn't seem to be interested."
day9,2piqiu,Sidian,12,Wed Dec 17 01:19:09 2014 UTC,"It's my personal theory that this is by design: keeping himself to interacting on an in-person basis means that he can separate himself from the need to be constantly visible and accessible online.  If he were to be very active in responding to Twitter/Reddit, he would have a harder time removing himself from that situation if he needed to. For instance, he works a (presumably) full-time job at Artillery, so he needs time to be able to do that, his streams, his casting and personal downtime. Social media adds onto that a lot.  Also, because he spends less time on social media, he's less likely to say something that offends or compromises his fanbase, cause controversy or otherwise sabotage the empire he's made for himself. It's not just the shows or the gaming stuff: Sean's success comes from his image of being ""a nice, enthusiastic, positive guy"".  Say he has a bad day, lashes out at a fan, or inadvertently says something that is supposed to mean well, but might read as offensive. Suddenly, the Internet is on his ass, and regardless of whether he's in the right or not, there are people who are going to remember it how they want to.  That happens enough times, and hey, there's enough of a momentum to compromise that image that he's built for himself.  A similar case is TotalBiscuit. He's outspoken about a lot of things, and sometimes people mistake that outspokenness for controversy. Many times TB has admitted that he should ""get off Twitter""; Sean is never in that position in the first place.  By staying separate, except for in-person exchanges (where people tend to be a lot less reactionary and a lot more chill) and stream chat (where you have to pay to speak, except for certain segments at the end of dailies, and therefore have a financial risk to getting banned), Sean allows himself to have a barrier between ""Day9"" and the rest of his life.  While some would argue that he could be so much more if it wasn't like this, I think Sean's persona (genuine or not) is the single largest contributor to his progress, and the thing most valuable to his continued success."
day9,2piqiu,MattDemers,15,Wed Dec 17 05:35:27 2014 UTC,"Sean replied to my tweet about this comment:   https://twitter.com/day9tv/status/545091569565433856 https://twitter.com/day9tv/status/545092413232906240    it's more that I don't have time to ""upkeep.""  It sucks to engage a conversation and then not be able to come back for months  The ""risk"" of ""saying something bad"" I don't think is anything anyone would really consider much.  That's kinda hard to happen   Seems I was wrong about a lot, and I'm glad he corrected me. Bandwidth is definitely a thing, though."

day9,2owk88,cleh1,6,Wed Dec 10 21:25:26 2014 UTC,For Sean it's a job-related expense anyways.

day9,2owk88,CrazyEddie041,3,Fri Dec 12 02:02:50 2014 UTC,...which means his video game / PC purchases are tax deductible since he's self employed.
day9,2owk88,Markovski,2,Thu Dec 11 16:59:51 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying he isn't well off, but I'm hesitant to say rich as shit. I literally know nothing about how much he makes.  I'm just saying his revenue from YouTube can't be more than a few thousand a month.  Or I could be totally wrong and he rakes in 10k from videos alone plus casting gigs."
day9,2owk88,beanerbobe,5,Thu Dec 11 18:20:16 2014 UTC,"...plus his (full time?) job at Artillery.  dude puts in some serious hours.    In the video, he also says the only thing he really splurges on are video games.  He buys the cheapest furniture, cheapest kitchen appliances, doesn't really buy electronics, etc."
day9,2owk88,Aeviaan,3,Wed Dec 10 23:56:32 2014 UTC,plus twitch subscribers at $5 each a month

day9,2owk88,Terakahn,1 point,Thu Dec 11 00:28:16 2014 UTC,Every month. So in total it's 60k
day9,2owk88,Sidian,1 point,Thu Dec 11 00:49:42 2014 UTC,still. thats a recurring monthly income that he doesnt have to do anything extra for.
day9,2owk88,Sidian,3,Thu Dec 11 15:03:43 2014 UTC,"Not really a big amount. That's like 10 games. How long has hearthstone been out for? Hell, most people bought a new console and that makes that amount pretty close."
day9,2owk88,Inoka1,1 point,Thu Dec 11 00:55:49 2014 UTC,"For most people spending that much on one game is a lot, yeah."
day9,2owk88,Septembers,4,Thu Dec 11 01:01:48 2014 UTC,"What he says is true but he's kind of trying to justify it to himself and he didn't need to spend that much to enjoy the game. Still, dude is rich as hell by this point so it's nothing to him."
day9,2owk88,Sidian,9,Thu Dec 11 00:38:31 2014 UTC,"He's rich as hell? Is there a source for that? Honestly, I have no idea what sort of money twitch streamers/youtubers make :P I suppose he also works at Artillery too."
day9,2owk88,Rainblast,2,Thu Dec 11 03:37:30 2014 UTC,"It's unlikely he's ""rich as hell"" but with a steady job and no kids to support this isn't a lot of money"
day9,2owk88,sadeiko,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:02:21 2014 UTC,"In a vacuum it's not a huge amount of money but in the context of a single game it is. If someone spent $1,000 on a PC I'd be like ""Yeah okay."" But if they spent that on chewing gum, well, my reaction would be different.  In any case, I think you're underestimating his wealth. He gets paid a ton just for doing a weekends work casting, gets a full time salary from Artillery that is probably a respectable wage, gets YouTube ad money, Twitch ad money, Twitch subscriber money and so on. I'd be surprised if he wasn't making at least $250,000+ but then if you think $650 on one game isn't much then maybe that salary isn't much to you either, I dunno."
day9,2owk88,kael13,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:40:06 2014 UTC,"Why I found this really interesting is that I'm trying to decide whether I want to spend real money on cards for the game.  On one hand, it's free to play, so why would I spend money? On the other, since I enjoy it (I've been playing casually since the beta) why not show Blizzard some love. (though I was thinking $50 - $60, the price of a typical game, not necessarily $500.)"
day9,2ovz53,cleh1,2,Wed Dec 10 18:41:09 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about this puzzle after he solved it and something about it bothered me... spoilers  When you encounter this puzzle, Sophia keeps asking you not to leave.  Her dialogue choices, when you take her at her word, clue the player that the solution is nearby.  When you talk to her, she says ""don't leave me.""  Try to leave, and she says ""Get back here Jones!""  To a player, this should be negative feedback guiding them back into the room with the cell.  The game seems to be speaking through a character to tell you that you're headed in the wrong direction.  HOWEVER, in order to progress, the player has to leave her alone and explore.  Nor just stroll over to a nearby room, but wander deep into unexplored territory.  You pretty much have to not only ignore her feedback, but do the exact opposite.  Her dialogue implores you not to leave, so apparently that means you have to go ahead something like 10 screens, iirc, and solve more than one puzzle.  At first I just saw their points about bad puzzle design and clues, but I found this weird in the context of the gender dynamic that the rest of the game had.  For example, when you can interrupt her performance, or the solution where you push Sofia in front of the knife juggler, or where you tease her about her weight to get her through a gap to open a door.  The only female character in the game seems like half adversary at times."

day9,2ovz53,eden_sc2,6,Wed Dec 10 20:42:28 2014 UTC,"Definitely a clusterfuck.    They've been going through the game at a decent speed, but this past monday's show, they practically spent the entire night trying to solve the puzzle of how to get the girl out of the cell.  Which makes it frustrating is that Indiana can physically lift the cell door high enough for her to walk out, but she won't come out because she says she doesn't trust that he can hold it for long enough."
day9,2ovz53,Stark464,3,Wed Dec 10 21:23:37 2014 UTC,Old adventure games like thid are famous for obscure solutiona to puzzles that make virtually no sense. In addition? If you missed the thing to solve the puzzle it could mean an immense amount pf backtracking to find the oddly shaped rock you missed near the beginning of the game that solves this issue.

day9,2k1o65,ConfusedTangles,3,Thu Oct 23 13:04:03 2014 UTC,"I think the effects will be diminished if you've seen a tone of playthroughs. But, like most games, playing it for yourself is a completely different experience. What I especially liked was how subtle the puzzles were, how well the atmosphere was done, and honestly how much they hinted at the possible world outside that of the demo. My first play through it scared the shit out of me because I had: 1) no idea what I was doing and 2.) no idea if/when I'd get eaten by some scary dead lady. The second play through I was sure I wouldn't be scared until ""oooh holly hell, what is happening this isn't the same"" because of the random element the game contains.   Outlast, I'll say, had some great jump scares and some nice monster design. But beyond that, the meat of the story was pretty weak, and I found that to cut down on the whole scare factor quite a lot. And just doesn't stack up in terms of graphical quality, which makes a huge difference in horror games."

He talks to much about ""game Design"" as if he has invented it, when he is just stating fairly obvious points most of the time. Also, we all have seen him grow into what he is right now and stood behind him as we all supported him and his channels. We subscribed and looked every time his show was airing etc.  Is it that hard to do something your loyal fanbase loves, just for one day on Halloween? I just don't feel the connection anymore when I watch him. Its just him in his own cloud.   Maybe I'am overreacting, but only the time I find it ""fun"" and ""informative"" is when he is doing Mostly Walking with two other great people."

Finally when playing games, especially against higher level opponents, just play, don't think play fast, then like Sean emphasizes review the game. Rushing through your first 100 games in a week is much better then thinking and having it take months.

Smashers (Smash Bros players) are divided; a lot don't like Super Smash Bros Brawl, because of a few things, plus if you want fast-paced Melee is faster.  However, Smash 4 (for 3DS and WiiU) is coming out soon, so there's a lot of hype, it's a great time to come into the scene if you haven't before. My husband bought the Japanese version, so we already have it, and it's great; all the good, polished parts of Brawl, without some of the things that people didn't like about Brawl.   It's definitely technical, pros make it look fast paced, and it's just fun."

Thanks!"

Because it's not AS flexible as SC2, the basics of the game don't change; base stats, the power of moves, etc. This round of Smash will probably have DLC characters and such, but IMO, it's a lot easier to jump into the Smash community than it is to jump into SC2 or LOL."

The 3DS has a lot of pretty good games, the new Pokemon games are great, so imo, a 3ds is worth it. Plus, there's a lot of content to enjoy for just HAVING a 3ds and passing/meeting other people who also have one.   And even if you don't get into Smash competitively, it's a great game if you have friends who also play, and there's always the competitive scene you can follow if you prefer spectating."

day9,2he7uk,Necuno,2,Fri Sep 26 01:05:02 2014 UTC,"DoTA takes a lot longer to learn. That being said I find it more rewarding. The heroes are much more varied, and item builds aren't as static.  LoL is more fun to just pick up and play. And I mean a lot more fun. I loved league the second I tried it, DoTA took me a while.  After playing both extensively I find that DoTA has much more strategic depth. Coming from Sc2 myself, I found that to be the most appealing to me. Some of the most fun I've had in DoTA is sitting in skype with the group I play with and theory crafting dumb stuff to try out.  edit: I should add that I stopped playing LoL once I really got into DoTA (1000hrs after 1 year at this point). Probably starting a fight with that statement, but it's a more dense game, so I have more reason to play it. I, like I imagine you are, crave the strategic depth a game can offer. Not to say LoL doesn't but it isn't on the level of DoTA  I noticed you said something about DoTA being too slow. It takes time, but once you realize all the things you can be doing even when sitting idly in lane, farming up the next big item, that slowness goes away. Between pushing lane, pulling lane, harassing, dancing around the scary spells, vying for an opening, checking runes, last hitting, denying, and maybe helping out another lane with a gank, you really never have down time."
day9,2he7uk,ewic,1 point,Thu Sep 25 22:58:45 2014 UTC,"the problem with DOTA is that there is no surrender option, so even if you take a lead by like 4 items, you still have to wait it out, and let your opponent drag out a long winded victory/defeat. I enjoyed dota a lot, but so much time was consumed just trying to end a decided game, that I felt like I was spending an extra hour or so a day beating around the bush."
day9,2he7uk,ewic,1 point,Fri Sep 26 01:18:03 2014 UTC,"Oh, I never realized there wasn't a surrender option. That does sound painful, but I do like the fact that teammates (theoretically) can't up and leave a game like they can in Starcraft team matches."
day9,2he7uk,Thriven,2,Fri Sep 26 01:39:42 2014 UTC,counter strike GO certainly has strategy. at least at the level i play at. maybe not the silver boys
day9,2he7uk,Darth_Toast,1 point,Fri Sep 26 02:50:20 2014 UTC,"I actually have CS GO on my Steam wish list.  When I play SC2 online, it's usually 3v3, so I like the team strategy aspect of CS.  Next time it's on sale I may have to pick it up.  Side note: One thing that's also pushing me away from SC2 online is the amount of douches I've come across.  CS:GO is going to be just as bad, isn't it? haha"

Each hole is specifically made for one person and where exactly the holes lead or their purpose is unknown (at the beginning, they eventually learn more about them). Its really short (~40 pages) and fairly creepy.   Could someone perhaps post the link to the vod?   I don't know how to do that."

day9,2h2xcz,Krobolt,16,Mon Sep 22 12:13:30 2014 UTC,"From Red Bull Battlegrounds DC today. I was so nervous I could barely speak, but he was the nicest guy ever. There was a huge line of people waiting to see him, but he spent at least 5-10 minutes with each person, and made everyone feel like the center of attention while we were with him. Totally worth the hour-ish in line.  Edit: I had descriptions ready for each picture, but imgur is having issues tonight. The basic gist is: Sean smiles! Sean is startled by a loud siren! Sean poses with me and my boyfriend at the same time! Sean laughs at our jokes and it's awesome!"
day9,2h2xcz,thekaz,14,Mon Sep 22 00:40:27 2014 UTC,"So, tl;dr Sean is one of the coolest guys ever?"
day9,2h2xcz,Cheekything,3,Mon Sep 22 03:25:05 2014 UTC,"Pretty much. I was afraid that meeting him in real life would ruin my perception of him from his dailies and such, but it didn't. He's even cooler than I'd hoped :P"
day9,2h2xcz,invisiblemovement,9,Mon Sep 22 11:06:05 2014 UTC,"He's actually given talks about how being a genuinely nice guy is part of his business model, and he makes a special distinction between acting nice and being nice. http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020558/Keeping-a-Community-for-Five"

day9,2gb6oq,FPSmike,1 point,Sun Sep 14 01:12:54 2014 UTC,He has a social media advisor?
day9,2gb6oq,Lawlson,9,Sat Sep 13 22:22:44 2014 UTC,I would be surprised if he didn't. Day9 maybe the face of Day9TV but I doubt he does it by himself. While I was at Redbull Orlando talking to him I met his manager/mom so I know he isn't doing it solo. It would be damn near impossible to do so with the size of his business
day9,2gb6oq,ReferenceError,8,Sat Sep 13 22:27:04 2014 UTC,"Don't think of it as 'he doesn't do his tweets'. If he does have a social media advisor, it would be the same person that handles CMS updates to his website, keeps the domain up to date, writes articles, youtube descriptions, makes sure to get photos of important events, remembers to advertise/hype projects online, double checks when he tweets, etc. Its like when you're about to tweet something and turn to one of your bros and go 'Does this sound right?/Should I even post this'. Being PC is really important for sponsors."
day9,2gb6oq,har-yau,1 point,Sun Sep 14 02:17:37 2014 UTC,He has a person to sort out the negative messages out for him. He has talked about this in different dailies.
day9,2gb6oq,NOTjak,1 point,Sun Sep 14 15:03:07 2014 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only one this happened to. I'm fairly confident it happened after I sent a tweet to one of my friends about how day9/husky never did the sex and the city thing.
