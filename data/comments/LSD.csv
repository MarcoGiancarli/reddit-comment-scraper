LSD,3e1ba6,sykadelik,3,Tue Jul 21 09:00:03 2015 UTC,I don't want to say bad trips don't happen because they do and they can be terrible but this sounds nothing like any bad trip I've ever had. It sounds like a straight up psychotic lapse or something more than just the acid.
LSD,3e1ba6,YeOfTheGreenTwilight,12,Tue Jul 21 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's some freaky shit. How does this happen? Any theories or thoughts on how such psychotic break can happen?"
LSD,3e1ba6,pdpbigbang,3,Tue Jul 21 05:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm curious too. In addition, is there anyway to prevent this?"
LSD,3e1ba6,ikerplunkk,5,Tue Jul 21 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"Such a high dose is nothing to play with so the approach should be very serious and not playful. Don't think ""I took it often, I'm safe"". Respect the substance always as you take it for the first time. I would meditate and eat very healthy like a whole week before such a dose though I don't really know if would ever take such a dose. Plus your system should be clean of other substances, no THC, which seemed to be involved here."
LSD,3e1ba6,Calmandpatient,3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've only gone as high as 250ug. I usually find weed makes my trip more fun and intense. Sounds like it's easy to lose touch with reality at higher doses."
LSD,3e1ba6,ikerplunkk,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"High doses of psychedelics are no joke.  Set and setting become increasingly important, as does the level of personal experience with the drug.  Even if you've tripped many times at varying levels, every trip has the potential to turn dark, and sometimes it can do so in a way that is very hard to prevent/recover from.  If you trip enough times at higher doses, sooner or later most people will experience a bad trip.  I'm a big advocate of psychedelic use, but it's irresponsible to suggest that these kinds of experiences are just myths perpetuated by conservatives, or that they only happen with knockoff LSD (NBOMes, etc), or that they only happen when the person had a pre-existing condition.  But if you want to reduce the likelihood of them, it's no big secret:   Set:  mental state, maturity, age, health, experience Setting:  where you are, who you're with, what you'll be doing, what responsibilities may be thrust onto you, and what is the plan for handling the worst case scenarios of those responsibilities? Know your drug: is it from a trusted source? have you tested it? Know your dose: have you consumed from this batch before?  are you confident that the dose is correct?  Start slow and work up if you don't know the dose. Bigger doses = bigger need for tripsitter"
LSD,3e1ba6,throwhooawayyfoe,8,Tue Jul 21 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"So sorry to hear this happened to you. Remember, you and your gf will heal in time.   I had a remarkably similar experience with one of my friends. We each dosed about 350ug, by far the highest dose I've taken, although I'm not entirely inexperienced (plenty of 150-200ug trips).  First few hours were beautiful (I melted into the forest floor while being gently rained on), then we came back inside and the next 4 or so hours were a blur. I thought I'd died and my friend had become my guide through the afterlife. Also thought I became him. Apparently I tried to have sex with him. Also punched a window and broke it. Also pissed my bed. Took me two weeks to recover from the ensuing emotional trauma.   But I'm fine now. And you will be too! I wish both your spirit  and your ear a gentle and speedy recovery."

LSD,3e1ba6,shikuto,22,Tue Jul 21 05:01:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that man, wish her a speedy recovery. I don't mean to sound insensitive but I'm curious, did you guys tell the cops/hospital you were on LSD? Were there any legal consequences?"
LSD,3e1ba6,GestureWithoutMotion,9,Tue Jul 21 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I told them right away over the phone.

LSD,3e1ba6,Buck_Thunderpumper,4,Tue Jul 21 07:06:42 2015 UTC,I highly suggest keeping a few benzos in your psychonaut kit in case you need to abort your trip or someone else's. I know just knowing I have a few Xanax stashed away is comforting. I've had to use them recently and it would have been ugly otherwise. Glad everyone is ok.
LSD,3e1ba6,isweedglutenfree,4,Tue Jul 21 12:27:03 2015 UTC,Same! I always keep melatonin (that's enough for me) or Xanax nearby in case I need to nope out. I fortunately haven't needed it but I could tell one time that my friend did and I was very happy to have that on hand to prevent something like this from happening
LSD,3e1ba6,PickleShaman,3,Tue Jul 21 21:35:53 2015 UTC,"So sorry to hear this. This is a good reminder to always prepare for a bad trip, because you'll never know when it will happen. I once got arrogant too, thinking I was experienced enough to handle a strong dose. Things got really bad and I struggled through a bad trip for a few hours. Luckily I had my friends around to calm me down and made me feel loved. I hope you guys will recover from this episode soon. Most of all, you tend to learn from bad trips a lot more than good trips..."

LSD,3e1ba6,resonance_500,2,Tue Jul 21 08:00:44 2015 UTC,"Damn man that's crazy. LSD is awesome, but when it does go bad, it goes real bad, real quick. I've had some sort of psychotic break on a high dose once as well. Shit was absolutely nuts. Best thing to do when something like that has happened, is take a break for like a 6 months or even a year. Good thing about these experiences is you grow a hell of a lot of respect for the substance."
LSD,3e1ba6,lysergamide060,2,Tue Jul 21 11:31:33 2015 UTC,"I'm an experienced tripper, but anything north of 250 ug seems unnecessary. Beyond that, you're not really self-aware, so what's the point of being high? I can't really think of any space that can't be reached within that dosage.  HELPFUL HINT: If you're going to dose like that, find a source (it's not hard, doctor/veterinary friend , quality dealer or off the net) of thorazine and keep it handy.  Doesn't matter how much acid you take, that thorazine is going to bring you down hard and fast. Not a nice feeling, but better than the alternative. There are a few other medications that will achieve the same effect. Research intelligently - be aware of potential potentiation. Having this on hand gives me a sense of complete security when tripping. In fact, I can get in spaces I normally would avoid out of fear, knowing that if things get desperate I can kill the buzz in 5 minutes."
LSD,3e1ba6,GatoradeEnthusiast,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:13 2015 UTC,"I actually have hydroxyzine prescribed, although I never take them and keep them because I heard it could help bad trips.

Think about a 5 year old child for a moment, they would do any of those actions without even thinking twice. LSD will bring some people down to a basic instinct.

A lot of people do this through music, but anything works. I personally like doing it to visual things around me - something that makes you feel happy by looking at it and enjoying it for what it is.  For instance my go to for years was simply to put on the muppets 'rainbow connection', 'The first time it happens' or 'pure imagination' from willy wonka and look through my psychedelic fractals like these ones and everything always came good again =)"
LSD,3e2jn6,its_it_n_thats_that,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not bashing your strategy, but for me personally if things get intense and the visuals are overwhelming watching fractals or something that is also extremely visually stimulating makes it all the crazier... Although I suppose the heart of your strategy lies in the positive reminders associated with that visual stimulation... I'll see myself out :P"
LSD,3e2jn6,sirvapesalot,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"Keep things around you POSITIVE! What I mean with that is putting on some positive music/entertainment. What I personally love is to start the trip with an album of reggae (eg Babylon by Bus, Bob Marley)! Also your whole setting and the activity's during your trip will affect the trip. Good forms of distraction can guide you, like drawing, painting, walking in nature or anything you like. If you're afraid and keep your previous two trips in your mind this will affect your trip too. And if you're not sure why the last two ended up like that, there might be something with you personally/mentally. It's all about the right mindset that result in a good trip."
LSD,3e2jn6,dutchlumberjack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"I'll keep it simple because I'm on mobile. I have had a lot of experience as far as trip sitting and introducing people to acid. First and foremost take some time before your trip to prepare a comfortable relaxing set and setting. Try and fill your mind with positive thoughts, and always have something on hand to help keep you grounded/down to earth if things get too intense. I find video games do a great job of that. Just remember that if things ever start to go bad just remember it's just a drug and that it'll all be over soon. Keep up those happy thoughts. Have a nice trip :)  Edit: music music music. Positive upbeat music. Like was already mentioned... Bob Marley/papadosio/lotus/grateful dead. I really enjoy classical music especially Mozart. Even if you don't normally hearing all the different instruments working together to create this incredibly beautiful sounds is amazing.   Some music that many people like, but that I think can just be too weird/dark a lot of the time is pink Floyd. Great music, just not if you're trying to create this perfect set and setting.   Edit 2: watch planet earth. That is all.  Edit 3: unless the weather is nice. Then go the fuck outside if you have a good place where you won't be bothered by others.   I for one just deal with people. I have tripped in public on numerous occasions and can sober myself up pretty good to talk to people or deal with various issues at hand but that can be hard for most people while tripping so I recommend somewhere more private.   FINAL EDIT: do you have anxiety medication? More specifically a benzo? Others usually work but benzos are the cream of the crop as far as anti anxiety meds go.   I ask because if you do you can take a small dose of it before the trip to take off the edge. Or if you feel like you want to end your trip or make it less intense. I can help you with dosing if needs be just let me know. I'm here to help.  Dammit I lied... Final edit 2: I find that having a good friend or a couple good friends to trip with helps. Solo trips can be amazing, but can also be tough for some.  So much for keeping it simple. Oh well haha"

There are, in the straight pyramid format, ones that are ((at least, and in order by strength, lowest to highest) opaque green, opaque black, and translucent orange ones.

I actually mean literally) 20 minutes to pack a bowl.  We were listening to Animals-Floyd and Dogs was on.  I felt that I was starting to come down.  The second I hit the bowl the fractals intensified so hard that I swear I couldn't see 10 ft. in front of me.  It was a great first trip and I'll always remember it.  It really opened my eyes to Lucy and how awesome she really is.  Definitely my experience of choice.

LSD,3e1e33,ogru41,4,Tue Jul 21 05:21:32 2015 UTC,It takes months for it to stabilize the brain's chemical imbalance caused by depression and sometimes up to a year. That being said if you took both at the same time the SSRI still hasn't had enough time to leave your body. This is just me guessing but I don't think you've been on the medication long enough for it to stop LSD.   With that in mind please please please realize that you are prescribed an antidepressant for a reason. Know your priorities and tripping can wait until you are done with the drug.

LSD,3e0kge,Rectungle,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:34 2015 UTC,You didn't take enough to develop much of a noticeable tolerance even though it was undoubtedly there.  Smoking weed will intensify any trip.  I'd think that if you kept taking small doses that often your tolerance would definetly build up.  Honestly its much more fun to just go all in and have an amazing time and then give it a while. Lsd is a treat. Don't treat it like weed or whatever.
LSD,3e0kge,Skippitydoodah,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:14 2015 UTC,"I find the bunching trips together can be draining on the mind and soul. But tolerance is more noticeable if you take says 2 tabs, then redose another at the end of the trip(almost wasteful). Or you trip hard one night, next day you would need about double the dose and still probably not as great of an experience."

So much so that I would recommend you only take it when you can be 100% guaranteed you won't need to speak to ANYONE who doesn't know and is cool with you tripping! Seriously, even briefly it can be completely head pickling and you could quickly end up spouting utter gibberish and become so paranoid after worrying about what you said it could spin you off into a bad trip. Even looking at your phone and trying to send something as ordinary as a text message can be dangerous. I've been caught doing that before, thinking I was about to text my brother and, after the wave had subsided a bit, looking back to find I'd almost sent a completely nonsensical message to my MOTHER! Fortunately I didn't but, it's VERY easy for things to spin off like that. Be careful...   Oh, and sorry I don't know much about doses. I have no way of telling how strong anything I get is.

I won't take MDMA since I'm going to another place a week after.   I thought I would just sit in a quiet place first. My SO and I are going to get there early and relax. He's sober and I trust him completely. I always enjoy the atmosphere at festivals. If it's too crowded or I have bad feelings I wouldn't take it.  Just sucks coming out of town with no reliable sources.
LSD,3dz7rm,Stinkyhoop,5,Mon Jul 20 19:42:31 2015 UTC,LSD is fucking magical at a festival the last time I took it at a festival I felt as if I could fill the universe with the ineffable happiness I felt. Pure bliss. That was after I had already had a bunch of trips and knew that there was no way I'd have a bad trip.   It is nothing you can imagine. LSD is blissful and great but if you have a bad trip as your first trip at a festival then its not going to be pretty. Tripping at a festival is overwhelming as fuck. Not only that but you risk getting LSD rip offs which can be bad for your health.  Could you get LSD to take there?
LSD,3dz7rm,i_love_boobiez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:23 2015 UTC,Stupidly I agreed to let my girlfriend try LSD for the first time at a festival. It ruined both of our nights.
LSD,3dz7rm,EminGH,3,Tue Jul 21 12:27:44 2015 UTC,"If you're confident of holding your shit together, maybe a low dose. I would take no more than half a blotter, then again, who knows how much there's on there. Which brings me to my next point. This is a drug to be respected. It's not easy to hold one's shit together while tripping on acid, let alone in an unfamiliar setting, surrounded by thousands of strangers.  My first Lucy trip was nothing short of a sublime spiritual experience. That would not have been possible if I were at a festival rather than in a controlled environment with only a handful of my closest friends. You really don't want anything to distract you from fully enjoying that experience. You can only pop your acid cherry once. You'll have your whole life to drop at a festival.  Edit: If you do decide to do it, take it with you from your reliable source. It's odorless and easy enough to hide. When I travel with acid, I just put it in the small pocket thingy of my jeans. You can also put it in the pages of a book."

LSD,3dz7rm,EminGH,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"It is amazing, I've had great times tripping at festivals. But I'm also an experienced user who know what to expect.  ""A tab or two"" is definitely too much for a first time at a festival in my opinion."
LSD,3dz7rm,i_love_boobiez,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:30 2015 UTC,Not every acid trip is spiritual or overwhelming. If you're in a good mind state and can enjoy the drug and the festival for what it is you'll have a lot of fun. If you let the LSD take over and think about your fuck ups and regrets you'll have the worst day of your life
LSD,3dz7rm,EminGH,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"If you let the LSD take over   If only it asked your permission :P  Seriously though, not every trip is spiritual or overwhelming, yes. I've only had one first trip obviously, and that one was definitely spiritual and overwhelming (in a positive way). From what I've seen, most people tend to have that kind of first time. It's intense, man. You subsequently learn to not ""let"" it take over."
LSD,3dz7rm,OOMAMOW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"I went to Venice beach my first trip and I had a good ass time smoking weed and walking around. Sometimes it's good to take it for the sake of being ""fucked up"" in the most bizarrely wonderful ways. That's how 90% of my friends do LSD and  there's nothing wrong with that"
LSD,3dz7rm,OOMAMOW,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"My first LSD trip was at the zoo, and i did a tab of 165ug. Was a smooth trip the whole way through, but everyone's different. I had also done shrooms plenty of times before, so i was experienced with Psychedelics."
LSD,3dz7rm,FreeYourMindWithLove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:38 2015 UTC,I've ever only taken MDMA. Should I instead suggest to my friends who I'm going to the smaller festival with that we do that instead of MDMA 2 nights in a row?(Our MDMA dosage is typically very low)
LSD,3dz7rm,ThatWasTheJawn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:41 2015 UTC,"Its up to you and your friends to decide. If you have someone who is somewhat sober, and will be able to help you if the trip goes south I say go for it."
