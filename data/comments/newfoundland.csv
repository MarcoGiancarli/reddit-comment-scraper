As for smoking on board, stuff it in a ciggie and make sure you're the furthest downwind. Also, no one cares, most people smoke a little pot here."

newfoundland,3dzhs1,Arcsane,3,Tue Jul 21 20:36:25 2015 UTC,". . . search procedure?  As far as I know, show up, pay up, and board.  Admittedly I haven't been on the ferry in a few years.  But given that you're on a water based domestic transport, and not flying through the air in a giant ballistic explosive tube, I don't think they have to do any real search, aside from a check in and declaration that you're not taking certain things like soil and plants."
newfoundland,3dzhs1,ZhuangZ2,3,Mon Jul 20 21:06:06 2015 UTC,Why can't you take soil or plants on the ferry?
newfoundland,3dzhs1,Kelaura,5,Mon Jul 20 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that's still in effect or not, but it used to have to do with some sort of parasite we have in the soil that's not generally present on the mainland - I'm pretty fuzzy on the details.  edit - It's a potato cyst nematode/roundworm, apparently.  ""Pale cyst nematode is only present in Newfoundland. Strict quarantine measures are in place to prevent the potential spread of these PCNs.""

newfoundland,3dzhs1,---JustMe---,2,Wed Jul 22 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"Booked a trip home near the end of August near $700 (Roundtrip). Two people, car and room and then gas surcharges on every individual thing I swear.  I tried sleeping on the reclining chairs before and it didn't go so well, it was really uncomfortable so I'm hoping the extra money for rooms are worth it!  As for the search they are looking for any plants, soils, even the dirt on your car to prevent the spread of roundworms (Nematodes).  I work in a lab in Nova Scotia any soil samples we receive from Newfoundland we have to bake it to kill any organic material before disposing of it!    They'll peek in your back seats, your trunk and have a quick look.  I've never been lucky enough to get the free car wash though.  Enjoy your trip home!"

I currently live in Newfoundland and I use the ferry all the time, and I have never needed to pay more than $100 plus Newfoundland tax (0.13%). It's a little strange to see someone paying around $400 to go on a ferry. Odd, I have to say. I think you got ripped off, possibly."

newfoundland,3dwboi,otooleeddy,3,Mon Jul 20 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"if you have a truck or SUV you can head down horse chops road (near Cape Broyle) to Mt Carmel Pond or nearby Cape Pond Rd to Cape Pond.   once you get off the northeast avalon it'll be way easier to just find a random pond where you won't see anyone. use google earth to find somewhere you like and then ask a bayman you know from that area. I am assuming you and the bys are townies because this is the most townie question ever (it's okay I'm a townie too).   two awesome spots I can think of off the top of my head that fit your bill but they are a three hour drive.   1 Kings cove lighthouse. Nice grassy spot where you can drive right up. Might be people come by during the day but won't be anyone around at night. No pond but right out on the ocean.    http://goo.gl/maps/ndfeF  2 Barbour's Pond, Keels. Unless you have a truck or SUV to drive right in, this spot is about ten min walk from the parking spot. Go through keels and follow the sign to the devils footprints. Park around there and continue on down the dirt road. Any local will help with directions. Bring fly dope.   http://goo.gl/maps/Oi0KM  Now you don't have to drive three hours to find a camping spot by any means but if you want to check out the Bonavista area they are lovely spots to camp without a big hike or quad trip.   Let me know if you have any questions. I used to be in your boat and then I spent a couple simmers looking for good spots and recently bought a jeep and a canoe. Camping at a campsite is generally shit. Good luck!"

newfoundland,3d9yz3,mig39,4,Wed Jul 15 00:15:40 2015 UTC,Lol all the upvotes
newfoundland,3d9yz3,Nickislander,5,Wed Jul 15 00:20:03 2015 UTC,"All the angry Facebook comments (and my own supportive views on the seal hunt) aside, he's right to be pissed.  I read the article the other day, and it was absolutely presented as though Stewart was considering buying the coat. If the owner was simply misrepresenting the situation, that's bullshit.  Of course, if the story as presented was correct and Stewart is now backtracking, then that's bullshit, too. Only those in the store at the time will know for sure."
newfoundland,3d9yz3,OttawaNLer,9,Tue Jul 14 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"Store owner stands by the statement that Rod knew all about the sealskin. Based on the fact that they want famous people to know the other side of the seal hunt, I am inclined to believe Vogue to a certain extent. This only blew up after the British tabloids got the photo and went nuclear. That said, we'll never know the full truth, I suspect."
newfoundland,3d9yz3,Fauxtella,-4,Tue Jul 14 22:43:09 2015 UTC,I'm not inclined to believe Vogue much at all. This dude's job is to convince people that spending thousands of dollars on dead skin is a good idea. Pretty sure every salesman has a silver tongue.
newfoundland,3d9yz3,Fauxtella,3,Wed Jul 15 00:25:24 2015 UTC,"While that's true, they also are great supporters of the sealing industry, and speak loud and proud about it. As I said, we'll never know the truth for sure."
newfoundland,3d9yz3,Fauxtella,5,Wed Jul 15 10:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they speak loud and proud about it because they make a lot of money from it. He may have told Stewart about the aspects of sustainability, the fact that it's a humane hunt, etc. But I feel pretty certain he never said ""Before I take this picture, I just think it's fair to warn you that this is politically-charged product and there could be consequences if I share this photograph. Do you still want me to take it?"""
newfoundland,3d9yz3,tomousse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:11:07 2015 UTC,"At issue was whether he knew it was sealskin or not, not whether they warned him about the blowback."

newfoundland,3d9yz3,baiboi,2,Wed Jul 15 12:25:43 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. I doubt Rod would have agreed to that if he'd known it would blow up like this. Vogue lent some coats to the back-up singers, Rod gave Vogue a plug during the concert, that should've been it. The picture should have never been posted online and the owner shouldn't of presented it like Rod bought the jacket."
newfoundland,3d9yz3,OttawaNLer,2,Wed Jul 15 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see other people being reasonable about this. No matter your feelings about the hunt, I think we can all agree that exploiting someone to further your own political agenda is unethical, especially when that person has been decent and fair to you."
newfoundland,3d9yz3,Freckleears,-4,Wed Jul 15 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"So can we presume that Rod Stewart exploited the furrier company to further his own agenda? I mean Vogue was kind enough to loan the group some nice wear, and thats pretty decent and fair. Maybe we should call a spade a spade. Rod Stewart and his handler failed miserably and now he is outraged over the stupidity they exhibited. Wait till PETA hops on the bandwagon!"
