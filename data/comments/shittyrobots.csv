shittyrobots,3djpou,abasson,14,Fri Jul 17 05:22:00 2015 UTC,Having shot guns from bench mounts and flown RC helicopters I am guessing there is about a 40 degree spread if they built it extremely well.  If not then really bullets will go in a completely random direction.  Which is a big reason this is highly illegal.
shittyrobots,3djpou,FearTheCron,28,Fri Jul 17 03:26:12 2015 UTC,That and the whole remote murder sort of thing. This would be a solid way to get an alibi/not be seen at the scene.
shittyrobots,3djpou,Thrall_So_Hard,18,Fri Jul 17 03:30:57 2015 UTC,With modern fpv systems it would be really hard to be far enough away to have a realistic alabi. Especially when you are lugging a massive fpv setup around and need more or less line of sight to the thing.
shittyrobots,3djpou,FearTheCron,7,Fri Jul 17 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"See, now that I didn't know. I stand corrected then...for now."
shittyrobots,3djpou,Thrall_So_Hard,13,Fri Jul 17 03:40:01 2015 UTC,There are video systems that can do longer range and less line of sight but reliability and delay suffer significantly.
shittyrobots,3djpou,FearTheCron,12,Fri Jul 17 03:42:50 2015 UTC,"So, you would have a drone that flies to a covered position. Attaches or mounts itself to a firing surface. Aims, and then fires from there. Assuming the target is sitting still or moving slowly it wouldn't be too hard to hit them. Perhaps a heavier FPV could have a targeting system with a rangefinder etc.   It just seems like a great stealth weapon.   Alternatively just strap explosives to it and fly it into a target."
shittyrobots,3djpou,Kanegawa,5,Fri Jul 17 05:10:58 2015 UTC,I would just get a Raptor 90 and run it into them to be honest.  That thing is like a flying lawn mower.  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8Gdh1CJkLE/hqdefault.jpg
shittyrobots,3djpou,FearTheCron,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, its not reliability or delay that suffers... its just you have bigger size (reliability is the exact same, or technically better because you can go farther....)"

shittyrobots,3djpou,Nozzinja,2,Fri Jul 17 09:33:38 2015 UTC,I'm surprised someone hasn't built an FPV A10 model around a long gun with some of the model jet engines.  Accuracy would probably be much better than a quadcopter as the thrust would be in line with the kickback.
shittyrobots,3djpou,LongUsername,3,Fri Jul 17 13:58:42 2015 UTC,Its accuracy is as good as the gun's accuracy and how well you aim it. The fact that its mounted on a helicopter would not affect the trajectory of the bullet. It would just take ages to get a good shot...
shittyrobots,3djpou,ayriuss,3,Fri Jul 17 05:43:22 2015 UTC,"you're confusing accuracy and precision.  I'm assuming the gun itself has good precision when fired from a fixed test rig, so accuracy is purely being able to fire it in a way that mostly hits where you are aiming."
shittyrobots,3djpou,chrwei,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"When you hold it in your hand, you can hold it still. When it's on a drone, the recoil is massive. You can see the drone being pushed backwards while firing.   If the drone starts moving while the bullet is still going down the barrel, it won't hit its intended target."
shittyrobots,3djpou,Asddsa76,3,Fri Jul 17 10:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well, we know that recoil happens after the bullet leaves the barrel."
shittyrobots,3djpou,oneonetwooneonetwo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:47:59 2015 UTC,Presuming the recoil is not going past the elastic limit of the mount (bending and not returning to previous position) then even if it flexes it should do so repeatably and should easily be compensated for by adjustment of the sights.

shittyrobots,3dft4g,Barboski,14,Thu Jul 16 13:06:41 2015 UTC,It's algorithm's are pretty shitty and it is pretty slow.
shittyrobots,3dft4g,toper-centage,8,Thu Jul 16 14:28:37 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It scans each tile multiple times on each pass (pretty inefficient) and does not store board state in memory which slows down the game and allows the human player to cheat.  Pretty cool nonetheless.  I loved making things like this in school.
shittyrobots,3dft4g,rabidpenguin,53,Thu Jul 16 20:41:23 2015 UTC,You could speed it up if it stored what the board looked like and stopped searching after it finds an added piece.

shittyrobots,3dft4g,ThisIsADogHello,24,Thu Jul 16 04:14:12 2015 UTC,It doesn't store the information about the board between turns so it wouldn't know if you cheated.
shittyrobots,3dft4g,Liquid_Fire_,4,Thu Jul 16 04:27:10 2015 UTC,How do we know it doesn't?
shittyrobots,3dft4g,dschneider,2,Thu Jul 16 15:28:27 2015 UTC,Because it rescans every tile on every turn. It wouldn't need to do this if it stored the info
shittyrobots,3dft4g,Liquid_Fire_,5,Thu Jul 16 17:13:47 2015 UTC,But maybe it's rescanning the board to make sure the player doesn't cheat?

Each round consists of 5 solves, so 5 scrambles.   they have their own table where they mix cubes and put them in a box with the persons name on a paper.   You have runners who take cubes they see and bring them to a table and call your name. You sit down with the judge, and they wait for you to be ready(most people have a separate cube they use to do a practice solve using their own scramble, to warm up) then you have ..i think its 12 seconds... to look at the cube. You move any side you go down as Did Not Finish. Then when the 12 seconds are up you place the cube down and put your hand on the timer(they use speedstack timers) lift your hands, and start solving.   When you are done with all 5 solves, they calculate your average of your middle 3. They take out your best and worst solve. If you do well enough(top whatever depending on the competition size) you move on to the next round.    Depending on the competition and if they are behind schedule, they will do hard cutoffs. If you go past this time, it goes down as a DNF.   If your cube pops and pieces go everywhere, YOU are the only one who can touch any piece, you have to put it back very similar to the way it was before it exploded(that's up to the judge's discretion.) if someone else touches the cube or you put it back wrong, also a DNF."

Generally the abacus wins. The fact that in a controlled situation like this where you're simulating two perfect actors using both an abacus and a calculator and they come out at the same speed is actually interesting, although since most Americans have probably never even seen an abacus before the significance of this test is probably lost.  On the other hand, I don't know any Japanese so maybe this really was made as an absurd goof. Either way, it's legitimately interesting to see the difference in speed.

This is one of those. Some of the visuals had actual relevance to the song; many did not.   I spent much of my teenage years not really knowing what I watched."

shittyrobots,3c70c2,rwesterh,2,Sun Jul 5 19:08:53 2015 UTC,"woot.com pretty frequently has Roombas and Neatos on sale. I did some research and decided on the Neato. Slightly worse battery life, but significantly better tracking of where it is in the room. Corners around tables/chairs excellently, and it creates a very efficient path.  If you check around and wait a while for a deal to show up, you can usually get a good refurbished one of their Dust/Hair XV-21 for about $150 under their ""dents/scratches"" classification. And that's usually just a scuff on the top or something, which it'll get anyway because it's a friggn' vacuum.  Call mine ""Little Buddy"", works great. It's like havin' a pet but it cleans up after you instead of the reverse. Got my mom one for her birthday too, but she uses it to clean up whatever gets tracked into her garage, usually rocks and dirt and stuff. Poor thing."

Machine guards, color coding, rearranging work spaces, all of these things can drastically reduce human errors. You can also build fail-safes into the technology, essentially preventing human error from the machine's side.  I'll give you an example. There was a case of a worker reading a pressure gauge on a huge, room-sized autoclave. He was in a hurry and opened the door before the pressure was completely dissipated, and the door swung open and killed him. Now there is an interlock so that the door can't be opened until it is safe to do so."

shittyrobots,3bkch4,Falseidenity,4,Tue Jun 30 11:23:28 2015 UTC,"That problem probably stems from teams controlling one robot with 2-4 people at the same time, one controlling the steering, the other the spinner and one more the flipper or similar.

shittyrobots,3bkch4,WaterStoryMark,6,Tue Jun 30 11:37:13 2015 UTC,The old days had a bunch of people controlling all parts of the robot via a homebrew joystick and control panel... I was always fascinated by those.
shittyrobots,3bkch4,brick_eater,3,Tue Jun 30 12:57:58 2015 UTC,I think if you had a generic XBox 360 controller you could perform most if not all of these functions with one person.

shittyrobots,3bhffb,Neebat,12,Mon Jun 29 14:58:18 2015 UTC,"The containment hood was designed for the gloves to go the other way.  It shouldn't be over-pressure like that, because it causes any contaminates inside to leak out into the lab."

shittyrobots,3bhffb,PzYc0,12,Mon Jun 29 15:33:46 2015 UTC,I think you got it the wrong way.  The glove box is supposed to be at positive pressure to keep contaminants out of the box! so it perfectly works as intended.
shittyrobots,3bhffb,Neebat,8,Mon Jun 29 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, I realized after I posted that enclosures like that can operate either way:   Clean-room, high-pressure keeps the air inside purer than the air outside. Containment, low-pressure keeps the stuff inside from leaking to the outside.   But slapping the gloves like you've won a race isn't part of either function.  They're still designed to be used INSIDE the box."
shittyrobots,3bhffb,HoodooBrown,5,Mon Jun 29 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah it depends on the context. I used one of these to assemble a camera enclosure in argon, were it was kept at positive pressure to make sure no ambient air got in. The gloves would stick out like this."
shittyrobots,3bhffb,mabahoangpuetmo,6,Mon Jun 29 21:09:40 2015 UTC,"Funny story, when my college got a new science building there was a major design flaw in the chem lab.

However, I'm glad you got on this thread and responded to a bunch of posts!  What /u/bcdave and I were thinking* was that there was a big influx of new subscribers all at once, maybe a week or two ago.  Can you confirm and/or comment on this?  In my own experience with reddit, big front page exposure of small subs through popular comments or otherwise is like a magnifying glass to the sunlight of redditors - it turns a manageable dispersion of pleasant sunny day into a focused beam of flaming destruction.  The analogy kind of falls apart after that, because after a while the sub is just that much better with so many initiated users.  Also, I appreciate your comment on the difficulty of finding new content for /r/shittyrobots/ and your comment on the resolve of letting subscribers decide what kind of content is appropriate.

shittyrobots,3b4v9i,DerivativeMonster,2,Fri Jun 26 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"When I found this sub there was pretty decent content, but it was sparse. New content didn't come that often because frankly, most robots that the public gets to see aren't that bad.   The sub started to get more popular and a bunch of new content started to come, including virtual robots, both Reddit bots and robots made within video games. Eventually they banned those and it went back to very infrequent content.   Personally I don't mind poorly human operated machinery as long as it is sufficiently shitty and remotely operated. Comics, virtual bots, or robots that are reversed (one of the top posts was a functional and impressive robot simply played backwards) shouldn't be getting the attention they are. I subbed because of glorious robots like the ketchup bottles. At the end of the day though, finding new, innovative OC for this sub is a bit more difficult than it is elsewhere, and after some of the best posts had been exhausted they began to look for new places to get their shitty robots."

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,bzzeigler,7,Tue Jun 23 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"I think the plan with the rods was to jam wrecks' blade, like a stick in a bike's spokes."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,TheSlimyDog,19,Tue Jun 23 07:28:49 2015 UTC,Wrecks had insane power and decent armor. Its downfall was its lack of maneuverability.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Kichigai,9,Tue Jun 23 02:29:17 2015 UTC,Also the fact that if it gets flipped it's essentially game over.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Khrrck,32,Tue Jun 23 04:11:59 2015 UTC,"Since it doesn't have wheels or treads, it gets to weigh more. Accordingly it actually has more power and armor than pretty much anything else. It just can't apply it."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,stupidrobots,7,Mon Jun 22 23:45:24 2015 UTC,That's actually not true.  Wrecks doesn't qualify as a walking machine under the current ruleset and received no weight bonus.  They're both 250lb.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Khrrck,7,Tue Jun 23 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"What, you mean the random Youtube comment I read was wrong? D:"
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,stupidrobots,7,Tue Jun 23 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"Well ""walkers"" do get a weight bonus and that's usually a good balance because making something walk takes weight but it makes it more interesting, but then Son of Whyachi came and used the letter of the law to make a drivetrain that wasn't much heavier than wheels and get the bonus so they changed the definition of a walker to something that can move its legs independently and in more than one axis.  As such, Wrecks gets no weight bonus BUT it was chosen to compete because it was so strange and unique.  I know the builders well and they have several improvements to be made.  Luckily the fought something utterly incapable of doing any damage to it, so they just need to apply their upgrades :D"
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,wzcx,2,Tue Jun 23 15:39:41 2015 UTC,There was no weight bonus for walkers this time around.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,humansrpepul2,10,Tue Jun 23 19:51:42 2015 UTC,It survived a whole match. Not many losers can say that. So it has defense. It doesnt have wheels which can be ripped off or exterior motors that can fail. Still a really shitty robot and a horrible tradeoff.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,c4ptainmorgan,10,Tue Jun 23 04:28:52 2015 UTC,It used to be that you could get extra weight for unconventional modes of movement.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Akeem83,11,Tue Jun 23 03:18:02 2015 UTC,I think you still get 20% extra weight for a walker.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,AverageAlien,4,Tue Jun 23 05:54:00 2015 UTC,I think I've got it! Maybe he's so good that he wanted to build a bot that forces him to play in hard mode!
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,FryGuy1013,13,Tue Jun 23 02:52:33 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to out maneuver everyone. It just has to hit them with its big spinning disc of death.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Killashard,19,Mon Jun 22 22:35:05 2015 UTC,Which requires maneuverability.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Stitchy506,4,Tue Jun 23 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"It had a great weapon, it just couldn't use it due to the crappy way it moved."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Kichigai,2,Tue Jun 23 04:31:24 2015 UTC,"As we see here against a lightly armored bot, it clearly takes a couple whacks from the blade of death to incapacitate. So unless someone is stupid enough to drive right into its front end a couple times, that's kind of useless."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Elfer,7,Tue Jun 23 04:51:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is still the case, but it used to be that if you had a ""walker"" bot then you'd get a higher weight limit. Very few people did it because the weight of the walking system and the reduced maneuverability typically wasn't worth the extra allowance.  Looks like here, they tried to make a lightweight (i.e. barely functional) walking system, and pumped the extra weight into the weapon. Bold move, ultimately unsuccessful, but hey, worth a shot maybe."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,TaytoCrisps,6,Tue Jun 23 06:47:36 2015 UTC,"There has to be some sort of design constraints, like you are only allowed one rotary motor and weight constraints ect. I dunno..."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Stinkis,13,Tue Jun 23 02:14:40 2015 UTC,From what I know there are weight restraints. You can also have a heavier robot if you don't have weels.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,loklanc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"Wrecks had tiny wheels on each ""foot"" though, I don't think it got that extra allowance.  EDIT: just watched again, no wheels on those feet."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Tarantulasagna,4,Tue Jun 23 07:45:16 2015 UTC,I feel like they came up with the name first
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,_Madison_,60,Tue Jun 23 15:01:59 2015 UTC,Those two teams need to combine their bots.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Yahspetsnaz,178,Mon Jun 22 22:37:14 2015 UTC,giant spinning razor wheel can move   I think you're on to something here.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,ftc08,21,Mon Jun 22 23:26:26 2015 UTC,Take those two concepts to their highest level and you end up with Blendo.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Spartan448,11,Tue Jun 23 01:27:04 2015 UTC,Actually you end up with Nightmare but that's just my opinion.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Llamasontheroof,141,Tue Jun 23 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"Both bots were shit.  One was just shittier than the other.  Plan X lacked decent armor and a real weapon, while wrecks had a badass saw, but sucked ass at everything else."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,81,Mon Jun 22 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"Plan X lacked decent armor   I'd debate that. Plan X's armour looks like it's spaced away from the chassis not just to look cool, but to keep damage away from anything important. If you're up against hammers or penetrating weapons this could be very effective as the outer layer has to be completely removed to do anything serious.  Of course, that comes at the cost of size and mobility, but against a robot as poorly mobile as Wrecks this isn't a problem."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Yahspetsnaz,45,Mon Jun 22 23:08:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and she mentions at the end that the side pieces were there specifically to protect the vital parts. The weapon seemed pathetic against anything metal though."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,picklesitter,2,Mon Jun 22 23:25:45 2015 UTC,pathetic against anything metal though.   aka anything that would feasibly go in the battlebox.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,DeFex,13,Tue Jun 23 22:53:43 2015 UTC,if they made actual armor that did not shatter the first time it was tickled by zombie wrecks wheel.

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,wzcx,2,Mon Jun 22 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's definitely the problem. It was a work of art, just not really ""armor"" in the functional sense."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,robot_exe,7,Tue Jun 23 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that one robot that was supposed to compete didn't (Airline lost some parts).

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,8,Tue Jun 23 09:31:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, it depends how strong the frame is. A good example of using the principal to good effect was in the old UK Robot Wars series. In one final Tornado had a frame added to protect the body from Razer's crushing weapon."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,fathertime979,4,Tue Jun 23 09:49:49 2015 UTC,So who won
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,5,Tue Jun 23 14:26:09 2015 UTC,Tornado IIRC.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,VarioussiteTARDISES,3,Tue Jun 23 14:36:21 2015 UTC,It went to a judge's decision and was easily the most controversial result.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,robot_exe,3,Wed Jun 24 08:56:36 2015 UTC,"That frame operated on the principle of stopping Razers claw actually making contact. Plan x's wouldn't stop the contact between the robots, it doesn't seem like it would be strong enough to withstand it."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,5,Tue Jun 23 09:54:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the point is that that's what they were likely going for. Either way a flywheel can shred that kind of armour quite happily. These things have strengths and weaknesses."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,LobotomistCircu,22,Tue Jun 23 09:56:13 2015 UTC,Both bots were shit. One was just shittier than the other.   I haven't watched the reboot beyond this video but this was the entire premise of the original battlebots.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,ClearAsNight,3,Tue Jun 23 01:03:06 2015 UTC,Shitty robots battling each other until the least shitty robot wins the whole thing?
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,LobotomistCircu,15,Tue Jun 23 05:16:30 2015 UTC,"Or until one breaks naturally from 3 minutes of regular use.  Their best performing robot was this tiny roomba thing that had a spatula.  95% of the robots, it turned out, couldn't move if you flipped them on their back or side.  When you have a show where it's a giant mechanical fucking spider versus a spatula with wheels and the spatula wins I feel like you should realize you have a failed idea on your hands"
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,16,Tue Jun 23 12:34:20 2015 UTC,"You generally see these things evolve as each season passes.For example, in the UK version of Robot Wars the first series' winner was literally a wedge with no weaponry, but a runner up had a primitive 'flipper'. A couple of series later numerous robots use flipping mechanisms and you started to see teams building in mechanisms to self-right their robots when flipped. The designs very much adapt to the competition over time and so the first season is going to feature weird setups which don't really perform that well."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,rx-pulse,3,Tue Jun 23 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"Biohazard I think was the robot, aside from it's stupid spatula weapon.

They said the builder was a classic '60 sci-fi fan, and if any one word defined classic sci-fi, it was ""ridiculous"".  It was silly, but we shouldn't ridicule stylistic flair just because it's silly.

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Tamer_,21,Tue Jun 23 02:28:16 2015 UTC,Do you have a better solution to transfer all the kinetic energy?
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,TheSlimyDog,2,Tue Jun 23 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"While it is transferring all its kinetic energy that way, all the energy still isn't that much considering it doesn't do much damage on average (I don't know how much its maximum speed is)."

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Stinkis,2,Tue Jun 23 03:12:10 2015 UTC,They didn't even keep the hammers spinning for the entire fight.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,LochnessDigital,26,Tue Jun 23 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"Vertical spinners are most effective as launcher bots. The hammers on Plan X are spinning the wrong way. The idea was that they would smash the opponent, but they only help in lifting Plan X's front end off the ground, lessening the impact quite a bit.  For a vertical spinner bot, you want to invest most of your mass into the weapon itself, so that it can have an immense amount of momentum behind it when it makes contact."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,i_suplex_deer,13,Mon Jun 22 23:39:58 2015 UTC,Does this new season have a rule about the direction vertical blades can spin? iirc Nightmare had to reverse their spin and effectively neuter themselves after sending a competitor into the ceiling.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Toxivian,17,Tue Jun 23 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"I thought they added the ceiling so that that exact scenario would be ok. Seems kind of pointless. No one freaks out about smashing bots into walls, and I thought the material is the same on both."

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,6,Tue Jun 23 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"That was old Nightmare. When it was first brought out in the 90s. The Nightmare from the other night was spinning as it was originally designed. I was really sad that it lost though, Nightmare is my favourite bot."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,The_God_King,4,Tue Jun 23 11:20:55 2015 UTC,"I really hope nightmare gets the wildcard. If they could come up with a system to flip themselves back over, I think they'd be pretty tough to beat."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,2,Tue Jun 23 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Wrecks would be a thousand times more combat effective if he had some device to spin himself around on one spot. So many times Plan X was sitting ready to be destroyed but the driver couldn't spin around to take advantage of that."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,robot_exe,3,Tue Jun 23 20:28:55 2015 UTC,There's no rule about that. Also you can see nightmare is spinning the correct especially when it vapourises the minibot it spits it forwards.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,7,Tue Jun 23 09:28:24 2015 UTC,"It depends what the target's armour is made of, but largely no. They'd be a lot more effective if they were spinning the other way, although at that point you might as well just have a flywheel."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,robot_exe,3,Mon Jun 22 23:04:35 2015 UTC,"Bar spinners have quite a few advantages over circular type spinners. They are all flywheels storing KE tot hen dump at once, just in different shapes."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,3,Tue Jun 23 09:29:47 2015 UTC,Bar spinners seem to be a lot easier to jam or break off when they've stopped rotating.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,robot_exe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:50:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on the bar design, one like Plan x's probably would be but most are just a literal bar of metal with teeth bolted/machined on the end, there's no reason why it would be weaker than a flywheel particularly as the weight is concentrated in the correct locations. They do have a disadvantage if the robot can be stuck in such a way it rests on the bar as it requires more torque to self right with."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,2,Tue Jun 23 09:56:27 2015 UTC,weaker than a flywheel particularly as the weight is concentrated in the correct locations   It's not so much a matter of strength so much as reliability. A disc is a lot easier to spin up at close quarters than a bar design which risks getting wedged.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,robot_exe,2,Tue Jun 23 09:59:03 2015 UTC,"If you do a spinner right that isn't a situation you encounter. When a spinner hits whether it is vertical or horizontal three things happen. The damage, your spinner stops and both robots are thrown apart.  Now if the designer built the spinner right by the time the other robot has recovered to attack the spinner should be spinning again. If it isn't you can easily back off for a moment to get it up to speed.  A disc still isn't going to spin up pressed against another robot."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,GammaKing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:11:07 2015 UTC,"Now if the designer built the spinner right by the time the other robot has recovered to attack the spinner should be spinning again   This isn't entirely true since it very much depends on the target being struck. Some robots will recover more quickly simply by design. If outmatched on speed as well jamming the spinner becomes easier.  A disc may not spin up pressed against another robot, but it's less easy to break in my view."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,robot_exe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:17:34 2015 UTC,"We're not talking about the other robot spending ages, just that time it take the bots to land, the driver to reorientate themselves and drive back to make contact. If you build a spinner sensibly you only need a second or two to get the blade back up to a decent speed. Some of the smaller weight classes will get up to speed in under a second. A slow spinup spinner is lazy design.  Bars and discs are equally tough. Bars are much less likely to take damaging hits though. Source: I build and fight robots."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,The_sad_zebra,5,Tue Jun 23 10:25:50 2015 UTC,"And it seems like it would be smarter to use rope instead of solid arms. As soon as one of those hammers hit, the front of Plan X came off the ground."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,Kichigai,4,Tue Jun 23 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"Ropes tangle too easily, and I'd wager the assist bots have worse dexterity than a Scutter."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,wOlfLisK,2,Tue Jun 23 04:53:45 2015 UTC,Well the best type of robot I've seen is Storm 2. It could literally shove an opponent right out of the arena. Only reason it lost on the original show was because the producers messed around with the rules because they thought it was boring.
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,VictoriousEgret,7,Tue Jun 23 13:04:45 2015 UTC,"Right, I think the only reason Plan X won was because it was so much more mobile.  It seems like they spent too much time on the glowing brain, and not enough on the other stuff."

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,personizzle,21,Tue Jun 23 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"Lot of misinformation in this thread about this robot. It is not a ""walker"" in the conventional sense. It achieves propulsion through a principle called ""gyroscopic precession."" The spinning disk generates a massive reactive force when it is tilted or rotated about an axis perpendicular to its rotation. Usually, this is undesirable. You can see robots like Nightmare with similar vertical disk weapons tilt up onto one wheel when turning, and most have massively wide wheelbases to counter it.   But Wrecks tries to use it to its advantage. The geometry and motion of the thing in the back harnesses this force into a forward/curving motion of the entire robot. By alternating the direction, it can propel itself forwards. I don't think it recieves any explicit weight bonus under the current rule set, but it doesn't really need to. The weight of making a rocking leg is tiny compared to a fully fledged battle-ready drivetrain. As a result, all the weight can go to the weapon mass and powertrain, making it quite powerful compared to what the other competitors can do.   Similar designs have been quite dominant in the antweight (1lb) class. Obviously Wreck's implementation leaves a lot to be desired. But the theory behind it is anything but shitty, and a faster/more manuverable iteration may be quite effective in the future."
shittyrobots,3ar9z2,RazgrizSeed,8,Tue Jun 23 11:12:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps smaller, more rapid waddles would have lead to some decent forward movement."

shittyrobots,3ar9z2,BBBTech,2,Tue Jun 23 15:42:47 2015 UTC,Probably better rephrased as the best KO in the series. It was also a shocker because Nightmare was such a fan favorite and Wyachi was a rookie and a walker. Imagine Manny Pacquiao losing a match against a rookie.

shittyrobots,3agydz,merreborn,9,Sat Jun 20 03:54:05 2015 UTC,There seems to be a lot of interest in origami robots recently.  Probably because there would be a lot of use for a robot that can be stuck into a very tight space that can also deploy on site.  Not to mention ... Imagine If you could produce robots in layers the same way PCB's are made? The manufacturability of those robots would be through the roof.  Edit: Actually It would be an interesting project to pursue.  What I would try to do is create a circuit using FPC's and then adhere polystyrene layers (think lamination paper) and some other materials that contract with heat to sort of cure a permanent structure.  Locomotion could be achieved by using materials with high thermal expansion coefficients for heaters to warm up to create muscles!

Just instructions that tell it what to do. Heck, they can't even actually see, and I bet they don't have any kind of tactile senses either. A good example is the one that tried to turn the lever.

shittyrobots,39kzpw,Vakieh,6,Sat Jun 13 07:37:48 2015 UTC,Could you do a translation transcript please? I'd really like to understand what was being yelled (evacuate vs how cool is that).
shittyrobots,39kzpw,Maleval,18,Sat Jun 13 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I'm going to transcribe the russian, then do a translation.  Can't really figure out anything before 0:34, but then we get this:  ""Красота, блядь!""  More unintelligable mumbling, then at 0:48  ""Еблан, что-ли, чё подымаешь? Нихуя дурак! Вон поднял, смотри что делает! Охуеть дебил ебаный, ты дурак, поднял - еще хуже сделал! Пиздос нахуй""  Someone from the side says something about the 4th work-team being screwed or something like that and camera guy responds ""Us too""  ""Охуеть!""  ""Вобще лепота, ебама-рама!""  ""Вот так и работаем нахуй, ебать мой хуй""  ""Лепота нахуй! Шо тут, и провода горят нахуй...""  Which roughly translates to:  ""Fucking beautiful!""  ""Hey you cunt, why are you lifting it up? Fucking idiot! Look, he lifted it up. look at what he's doing! Fuck that, you fucking idiot, you lifted it up and only made it worse! Fucking fuck""  ""Fucking wow!""  ""Fucking beautiful, <untranslateble russian profanity with no real meaning but much emotion>!""  ""Yep, this is our working environment, fuck me!""  ""Fucking beautiful! What's this, some cables burning...""  So the general mood is pissed, no mention of evacuation or running away.  At this point I have to say that translating russian mat is a stupidly difficult task, because of the variety and how much of it is purely emotional combination of random words and occasionally sounds. But I'll try to justify some of my translation  below:  The first word I had a problem with was ""еблан"" (pronounced ye-BLAHN). It directly translated to ""fucker"" but that doesn't take into account just how severe the russian word is. It's a noun formed from the word ""ебать"" (ye-BAHT') which is the more obscene word for ""to fuck"" and so ""fucker"" just doesnt carry across the emotional charge of the original word, because of that I went with ""cunt"".  ""Охуеть"" (a-khu-YET') is a general exclamation of surprise, awe, anger, well, anything really, if you put your mind to it. In ""Охуеть дебил ебаный"" (a-khu-YET' deh-BEEL YOH-bah-ny) I translated it as just ""Fucking idiot!"" because here it describes being impressed with just how retarded the other person is. The more literal translation would be something like ""Fuck, fucking idiot"" but that just doesn't roll of the tongue as well. In the second instance ""Охуеть!"" is more of an expression of shock and awe at the consequences of someone elses stupidity, similar to how Gordon Ramsay uses ""Fuck me!""  The untranslateble russian profanity with no real meaning but much emotion is exactly what it says on the tin. In the original it's ""ебама-рама"" (yeh-BAH-mah-rah-mah) which sounds vaguely obscene and rhymes but doesn't carry any actual meaning. It's just the person making pissed off sounds.  And that comcludes our lesson, kids."

shittyrobots,39jdps,Scottehhh,5,Fri Jun 12 08:45:37 2015 UTC,"No.   A robot is a mechanical or virtual artificial agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, and even microscopic nano robots.   This ""drone"" aka quadcopter is 100% user-controlled. It's like a flying RC toy, but more expensive and with a camera attached."

shittyrobots,39ccc9,xu85,0,Thu Jun 11 10:55:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know that. What I suspect happened following this investigation was two things : Firstly, The bot that used to inform a user that  ""Your comment has been linked to SubRedditDrama"" quietly disappeared. It used to link every thread in 2013/2014, now it is no more. This meant a user in a far away sub 95% of the time will never know he got linked by the hordes at SRD, and will be none the wiser as to why he's sitting on -50 karma. This was probably done to stop the massive growth that it underwent in 13/14, it works to the detriment of the brigaded and the benefit of existing users who had less heat on their little brigading sub.

shittyrobots,38xnqd,Calber4,3,Sun Jun 7 20:54:12 2015 UTC,Boston Dynamics makes the Atlas robot many of the teams use. The programming is up for the individual teams though.

shittyrobots,38xnqd,hansdieter44,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:11:05 2015 UTC,It seems like the simplest thing to do would simply be to teach the robots to learn how to move on their own rather than hard code it. I imagine that's how these robots work? I don't know much about robotics.

shittyrobots,38xnqd,poop-trap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"Ever think there was one more stair and make a super awkward step because of it? That's what happened here. Most of these robots are programmed to run a subroutine ""turn valve"", and the robot is supposed to locate, size, and evaluate the shape of the valve, then turn it. It just thought it was somewhere it wasn't.   So, it went through its turning routine, which includes counterweighting to counteract the torque from turning. Since there was no torque, the robot crashed.   Robots are about 10-20 years behind where people think they are. The DRC is in part to help push the boundaries. They did it with self driving cars 10 years ago, which had some great Fail moments, and look where we are now."
