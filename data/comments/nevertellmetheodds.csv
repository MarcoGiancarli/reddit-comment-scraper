nevertellmetheodds,3e0z04,Invokaar,4,Tue Jul 21 12:46:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if you practice your technique elsewhere, you gain the confidence in knowing your ability. So basically, this is exactly the same. It's impressive, but you are wrong in thinking this isn't a practiced skill.   Now, if he were jumping out of the way of something and happened to flip through this hole, that would be more in line with the sub's intentions."
nevertellmetheodds,3e0z04,ZaphodBeelzebub,3,Tue Jul 21 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I've always thought of this sub as being more accidental stuff.  I know it doesn't necessarily have to be,  but that's still how I've always seen it. For some reason, posts where you can clearly see that it was pure skill kinda go against the point of the sub imo."

nevertellmetheodds,3dn7jo,Bob_Droll,47,Mon Jul 20 04:26:32 2015 UTC,It should be illegal to post a gaming gif without putting the game title in the comments.
nevertellmetheodds,3dn7jo,Bob_Droll,-33,Fri Jul 17 18:27:58 2015 UTC,Then the same should apply to movies and tv shows which I rarely see any gifs on Reddit do.

I dont come to the post specifically to see those comments and they are made usually to denote a reaction of some sort, not as a planned out piece of content that needs to have a title anyway. All you have to do is add the name of the game to the title you are already creating. Is it really so hard?"

nevertellmetheodds,3djxx1,Iamaqueefmachine,42,Fri Jul 17 01:02:04 2015 UTC,It is not statistically impossible... Highly highly highly unlikely but not impossible.

nevertellmetheodds,3djxx1,Stylmi,20,Fri Jul 17 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"Highly highly highly unlikely   That's what statistically impossible means.

nevertellmetheodds,3djxx1,KarmaAdjuster,29,Fri Jul 17 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"While this trick is highly highly highly unlikely, clearly for it to be statistically impossible it would require at least another ""highly"" possibly more. I think /u/lamaqueefmachine's analysis still hold true."

nevertellmetheodds,3cd1th,CHEONFK,49,Mon Jul 6 23:32:41 2015 UTC,"Actually twins are common when you buy the largest size eggs. Jumbo packs are measured by weight, so if an egg has two yolks, it will weigh more than the rest of the eggs, therefore twins are often grouped together in the same cartons. Still awesome nonetheless!"
nevertellmetheodds,3cd1th,licitranick,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"It goes even further. My parents always buy XL size eggs at the local greengrocer's, because they are specifically selected to be double yolked. Besides, they taste a bit better and hey, more egg per egg is always a win for breakfast ;)"
nevertellmetheodds,3cd1th,ChromeLynx,28,Tue Jul 14 15:14:48 2015 UTC,"According to the British Egg Association about 0.1% of eggs have a double yolk. Lets assume for the sake of argument this is uniform across all types eggs. If we ignore yolkless and higher polyyolk eggs then this means a 99.9% chance of getting a single yolk. This means that we can work out the probabilities of getting different amounts of double yolks in a pan of 4:   chance of no doubles = 1 x (99.9/100)4 x (0.1/100)0 = 99.6% chance of 1 double = 4 x (99.9/100)3 x (0.1/100)1 = 0.399% chance of 2 doubles = 6 x (99.9/100)2 x (0.1/100)2 = 0.000599% chance of 3 doubles = 4 x (99.9/100)1 x (0.1/100)3 = 0.000000400% chance of 4 doubles =1 x (99.9/100)0 x (0.1/100)4  = 0.0000000001%   With decimals like this it can be hard to comprehend how astronomically low the odds are so I will try to put this in perspective. Assuming you use 4 eggs in the pan every time you could:   you would expect to see a double yolk on average once every 251 days you would expect to see two double yolks every 457 years (about one every day since the time of Shakespeare) you would expect to see three every 685,000 years (once a day since Humans split from Neanderthals) you would expect to see three double yolks every 2.7 billion years (doing it since only photosynthesizing bacteria were the only life on earth)   That's a pretty long time to wait. Let's get some people along to speed the process up:   You'd only need 250 people (size of a small school) doing it once each to get one double Once by every person in Guam (160k people) to get two double yolks Once by every person in Indonesia (250m people) to get three And you'd need every person on Earth (7bn) to do it 143 times to get all four   So yeah seems like lot right? Let's bring that back down and make it real. The UK egg consumption is estimated at 12 billion eggs per year or 0.5 eggs per person per day. Lets enforce an international law that requires people to cook their eggs in batches of 4. Assuming that every person on earth has this same consumption, that means that the 4 doubles phenomena happens somewhere every ((4/0.5)x143)/365 = ~3 years  Note that because the less than 4 polyyolks needed less than 7bn people and even then only doing it once we can say that on average they happen somewhere on Earth multiple times a day: 28 times per day for 3 doubles, 44000 per day for 2, and 28 million for 1.  TL;DR: multiple double yolks seem like a magic rare experience if you just look at it from the perspective of 1 person, but when you account for all 7,000,000,000 people on this brilliant egg filled planet of ours they're actually quite common. Provided you create international laws on egg cooking."

Trying something over and over again until it works does not fall into that same category.

Sure, a bullet bill can get the guy in last place into first place in a hurry, but he won't maintain the position for long."

nevertellmetheodds,3bkrhe,Creepygroovy,5,Tue Jun 30 00:54:41 2015 UTC,what did it ricochet off of?  and why does it whistle?
nevertellmetheodds,3bkrhe,bbell171,6,Tue Jun 30 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"I believe they were shooting at a supported steel plate, steel is a pretty common target because you can hear a hit on target but they're usually built to move or fall over so that the round is deflected down instead of back. The whistling is from the round tumbling through the air after the ricochet."
nevertellmetheodds,3bkrhe,ItAintStupid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:32:55 2015 UTC,Jup and normally they put the targets at a downwards angle..
nevertellmetheodds,3bkrhe,DeadlyGreenGecko,3,Wed Jul 1 07:12:45 2015 UTC,I don't know the odds. But please never tell me
nevertellmetheodds,3bkrhe,champzors,2,Tue Jun 30 08:10:21 2015 UTC,"If the target is hit at 18.2s, and the ricochet returns at 20.0, then there is an 1.8s gap. If the speed of sound is 340m/s, then 1.8s * 340m/s = 612m. 612m * 1 yard/0.9144m = 669.2 yards. Or approximate 700 yards.  Edit: Rewatched and found I was off by a full second."

nevertellmetheodds,3au4r5,Roc92,4,Tue Jun 23 16:30:42 2015 UTC,Why wasn't the pizza cut into slices?
nevertellmetheodds,3au4r5,silianrail,5,Tue Jun 23 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"Presumably a request by the director? As the shot was that a whole pizza would end up on the roof, not slices scatter everywhere. At least that's what I would imagine."
nevertellmetheodds,3au4r5,silianrail,2,Tue Jun 23 21:23:30 2015 UTC,"Well, right. But what I mean is that it doesn't make any sense that a man would buy a pizza to bring home only to discover it wasn't cut into slices.

nevertellmetheodds,3aeiev,solateor,27,Fri Jun 19 13:52:44 2015 UTC,I'm guessing every golf expert will be here to tell you how to swing a club
nevertellmetheodds,3aeiev,Psuphilly,48,Fri Jun 19 18:46:50 2015 UTC,this actually happens quite often especially when hitting from a rubber tee that is too high
nevertellmetheodds,3aeiev,DoubleR345,5,Fri Jun 19 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"Haha, I was gonna say the same thing as everyone else... This ain't uncommon."

nevertellmetheodds,3aeiev,Pestilence48,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"When I was new at golf, I practiced a lot, and one shot I took perfectly knocked out the tee from underneath the ball.  The tee must've been the same exact height as the length of the club head, because the ball fell straight down and I had no idea what happened until a looked a little bit closer."
