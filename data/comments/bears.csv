bears,3cdyj6,eyeothemastodon,3,Tue Jul 7 04:08:08 2015 UTC,They use grizzly bear and brown bear interchangeably. Is that right?
bears,3cdyj6,Dimpl3s,3,Tue Jul 7 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"Ranger Mike Fitz addressed this in Katmai NP FAQs:   What is the difference between brown bears and grizzly bears?  All grizzly bears are brown bears, but not all brown bears are grizzly bears. The bears you are watching on the cams are brown bears. Grizzly bears and brown bears are the same species (Ursus arctos), but grizzly bears are currently considered to be a separate subspecies (U. a. horribilis). Due to a few morphological differences, Kodiak bears are also considered to be are distinct subspecies of brown bear (U. a. middendorfii), but are very similar to Katmai’s brown bears in diet and habits.  Even though grizzlies are considered to be a subspecies of brown bear, the difference between a grizzly bear and a brown bear is fairly arbitrary. In North America, brown bears are generally considered to be those of the species that have access to coastal food resources like salmon. Grizzly bears live further inland and typically do not have access to marine-derived food resources.  Besides habitat and diet, there are physical and (arguably) temperamental differences between brown and grizzly bears. Large male brown bears in Katmai can routinely weigh over 1000 pounds (454 kg) in the fall. In contrast, grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park weigh far less on average. There have been no documented cases of grizzly bears weighing over 900 pounds (408 kg) in Yellowstone. Additionally, grizzly bears seem to react to humans at greater distances than brown bears."

bears,3ccsv5,970souk,2,Tue Jul 7 14:38:45 2015 UTC,"First night, I spent in a hide in the Forest where the guides put food out for them. They were there when I arrived around 5pm, so the light was good. That's when I got the portraits.  The second night was in a one man hide overlooking a lake. I must have waited 3 or 4 hours for the first bear to turn up and by that point the sun had gone down. I didn't want to go much slower than 1/500, given that the bears where moving, so the ISO had to go quite high.  A lot of the shots were too grainy to use. But I managed to clean up some in Lightroom. I think the shots on that second night were better, because the animal's behaviour was more natural. It also helped to keep those shots quite dark. Making the exposure look like daytime just exaggerated the grain."

You are so lucky to see a wolf, eagle, and 435 Holly's family - I missed them by just one day last year.   You probably know about bear cam? I've spent way too much watching it ;)  I think the bear in the first photo of the first album is bear 128 Grazer, she is an adult female about 9 years, she has big fluffy and rounded ears that glow like light bulbs. Bear 500 is a 3.5 years old subadult female, here's a pic of her last September.  Interestingly 128 is thought to be an offspring of 408, sibling to 409 Beadnose and 500 is thought to be Beadnose's cub, so if that's true, those two are cousins!  I also think the first courting pairs are adult males 89 Backpack (blond bear) and 32 Chunk (darker bear), they are besties and like to playfight! Here's a video taken last Autumn by Ranger Mike, it's adorable!   The second courting pairs are 410, at 27 she is the oldest female bear around Brooks, and 856 is the most dominant bear at Brooks. Looks like he is still following her around..   The last photo in the first album is 747, he likes to sit facing away from the fall when not fishing, he's probably the largest bear at Brooks! He was another bear I was hoping to see but missed out."

bears,3bppq3,thr0waway7373,2,Thu Jul 2 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"I started watching the cam 2 years ago from a link I saw on reddit, so credit to that someone who got me hooked :)  From what I've observed, courting pairs don't playfight like the two. I recognised 89, the other bear has scars on its neck so it is most likely a male bear, after watching your video they behave exactly like 32 and 89 that I am familiar with."
bears,3bppq3,thr0waway7373,3,Thu Jul 2 09:34:58 2015 UTC,"I think the bear in the first photo of the first album is bear 128 Grazer   According to this pdf ""She fishes the lower river, the cut bank, and the riffles."" I don't see any reference to bear 500, maybe they'll update this pdf in time for next year.   I also think the first courting pairs are adult males 89 Backpack (blond bear) and 32 Chunk (darker bear), they are besties and like to playfight!   Showin' off their latest moves? There's a baby pic of Backpack on pg17 of the pdf. They grow up so fast!   /u/msobelle is right, you really know your bears!   (a backbutton mishit deleted a much longer reply, argh!)"

bears,3a55k9,970souk,2,Wed Jun 17 08:44:47 2015 UTC,At what age do sloth bears lose their juvenile teeth? I guess it's too much to hope that the ones knocked out were his baby teeth and not adult teeth?
bears,3a55k9,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Wed Jun 17 13:43:53 2015 UTC,/u/KaySeas would be the best person to answer this question - she has volunteered to work with sloth bears at Wildlife SOS sanctuary in India and may have even met Elvis!

bears,3a19a4,KaySeas,5,Tue Jun 16 13:06:30 2015 UTC,"I saw nearly 25 bears during my 3-week volunteering period. Only 6 of those bears were seen in the forest, the rest were all observed at a garbage dump. We believe that this female and her cubs are daily visitors as we think we saw the same individuals multiple times (a female with 3 cubs doesn't happen too often). She is teaching some very bad habits to her cubs. Bad momma bear!"

bears,37qe9n,KaySeas,2,Fri May 29 15:54:30 2015 UTC,I would like to know more about efforts to change the locals from not wanting bears and wolves to wanting them. Are you guys just relying on education changing them or are their plans for them to see a monetary benefit from the animals like some places do through tourism and managed hunts?
bears,37qe9n,uliarliarpantsonfire,3,Fri May 29 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"Good question! I've only been here since May 22nd so I don't know too much about how they plan on mitigating conflict, but from my understanding, they will mostly be focusing on education and outreach. Ecotourism would be a little tricky as you don't really see any animals during the day and this side of Turkey isn't as popular, but I believe the organization here is trying to think of something. There have been a few documentaries about the bears and wolves in this region which promotes the ecotourism value of northeastern Turkey. As for managed hunts, that would be a problem as there aren't any estimates on the number of bears in the country. That shouldn't be an option until there is a better idea on the population rate and size. For now, it is still illegal to hunt any large carnivores."
bears,37qe9n,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Fri May 29 19:22:47 2015 UTC,Well I sure hope that your efforts are successful since it seems that they are needed! How do they go about getting an estimate of the number of bears?
bears,37qe9n,uliarliarpantsonfire,3,Fri May 29 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"It's a little tricky since technically the forest couldn't support very many bears as there isn't too many resources available, but the garbage dumps have become a source of food for a lot of bears. So we are seeing females with up to 3 cubs. However, there is still no information on mortality rate of cubs either. Through the use of camera traps, we hope to figure out the density of bears. But it will be really difficult getting estimates as there isn't as much research on these bears as there is with bears in North America."
bears,37qe9n,disgustipated,2,Sat May 30 03:46:52 2015 UTC,"Gosh that does sound bad if there aren't enough natural resources to support them. I hope you'll keep us updated on your adventure, I find it fascinating and I'm so envious!"
bears,37qe9n,970souk,2,Sat May 30 06:04:54 2015 UTC,"Tell us about the bears! I live in SW Montana where we have a pretty healthy grizzly population now. I found it interesting that our grizzlies (U. a. horriblis), especially those in Yellowstone and the nearby mountains are much smaller, rarely larger than 300 kilos, yet more carnivorous (diet-wise) than the northern populations in Canada and Alaska.    So, what are your bears like? Do they forage for berries and moths like the ones in the Rocky Mountains?  How aggressive are they? What do you guys use for protection against attacks?  Do you have many maulings or attacks there?  Keep up the great work!"
bears,37qe9n,970souk,3,Sat May 30 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"These brown bears are also fairly small compared to other subpopulations. Their diet is definitely more vegetation-based rather than meat based. There are a few wild berries that grow here that they eat during those months. Other times they will forage through grass, and some bears will forage through trash. In terms of aggressiveness, it's difficult to say. There really isn't much research on these bears. This group of people are really the first that have put the effort to try to understand bears in order to conserve them. There is a lot of human-bear conflict in this area because there is no education on how to properly live in bear country. But there is a lot of attacks from these bears and there have been a few casualties. It will never be known whose fault it was exactly as stories tend to be biased against large carnivores. We don't really use anything for protection as there is no bear spray in the country. We just try to avoid going into dense forest areas. We are extremely careful and have actually encountered a female and her cub up close. Fortunately, they just ran away."

And how can I forget the black bear with her cubs at the base of Half Dome and the five or so people who were gawking and following them to get photos?

Thom Thom is  bit of a mystery man, he was found in the forest as a cub which is unusual, as they will stay with their mothers for thee first 2 years or so and usually even stay together if mother or cub gets snared by a poacher.  It could be that this was a strange occurrence with them being separated, or perhaps he was even rejected by the mother? Who knows, but it is very interesting for the different species to have bred in the wild. Whatever happened, on his on he wouldn't have survived, so while he couldn't be in the wild, he is dearly loved where he is now."
bears,339gor,P7uen,5,Tue Apr 21 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I was able to do bearkeeper for a day at the Cambodian sanctuary in May 2013 and I loved it. I hope I have the opportunity to volunteer again since a day just isn't enough.   I find hybrid bears so fascinating since my particular interest is in bear behavior. There was this really interesting study on the prizzly hybrids from the Osnabruck Zoo in Germany. Soon after the female brown bear gave birth to her 2 prizzly cubs, the cubs were sent to another zoo before they could learn any behaviors from either parent. It was discovered that these hybrids demonstrated behaviors that were more similar to polar bears than brown bears such as stomping on objects with their front legs.   Does Thom Thom demonstrate any behaviors that are more commonly seen in just moon bears or sun bears?"

bears,32n3sh,KodiakArrest,7,Wed Apr 15 12:16:07 2015 UTC,"(Where I live), most bears either forage or fish for food. Foraging is obviously passive, fishing is a little more involved, but it is still ultimately a wait-and-see game.   When bears on Kodiak Island do attack, it comes in two forms. The first is the more common bluff charge, the second is a genuine charge.   A bluff charge is usually exploratory... Their heads will be up, and they'll usually be running towards you somewhat sideways.   A real charge is nothing to mess with. They sprint at >40 feet per second, their heads will be down, and once you're tackled, they'll proceed to rip you apart with claws, teeth, and brute strength.   However, in all of the attacks I've witnessed coworkers have, it's more often a ""HOLY FUCK HUMAN YOU SURPRISED ME SO I'M GONNA KNOCK YOU OVER, NIBBLE ON YOUR LEG, AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE"" type of a deal."
bears,32n3sh,LapinHero,3,Wed Apr 15 05:55:25 2015 UTC,"So it seems like the charge is pretty important to their overall strategy. How do they ""tackle"" as you put it? Is it like a hug or a shoulder check or a push? I'm guessing hug since ""bear hug"" had to come from somewhere."
bears,32n3sh,instagarm,7,Wed Apr 15 12:19:16 2015 UTC,"Heyy, DnD/Bear lover here.  Bears swipe, heavily. For a real life reference, they have claws but their paw is enough, a good swing will crush bones. Think of them like a mace. For DnD this would equate to Blunt + Slash, kind of.   A tackle/charge is a weighty shoulder charge, and a bite can easily be a grapple. Bluff charge? Bonus to intimidation! :D  Bears hav ec thick deposits of fat around the neck, preventing jugular damage, ie, where most animals will direct attacks.   So high natural armour, high natural damage, still dexterous. Adult bears are dangerous.  Swipes can be a combo attack, two paws and a bite to grapple on a full attack."
bears,32jty0,970souk,7,Tue Apr 14 11:04:36 2015 UTC,"Video source - Katmai National Park and Preserve: 435 Holly's spring cub and adopted yearling play fight, Sept. 27, 2014 [4:12].  Male yearling was abandoned by his mother, who was in estrus and was in pursue by a dominant male bear, in early July last year. A yearling on his own is very unlikely to survive as sows usually keep their cubs for another year. The yearling was not seen again at Brooks Camp for another 2 months, when he returned in early September, he was spotted in the company of a sow nicknamed Holly and her female spring cub. Bear adoption in the wild is very rare, this yearling is very lucky to have given a second change chance*.  Read about it:  Katmai NP Blog: Abandoned Cub Finds a New Mother  NPR: In Alaska, An Uncommon Act Of Maternal Love"
bears,32jty0,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Tue Apr 14 11:11:46 2015 UTC,"This is an awesome story! I'm glad that she adopted him, but I wonder why they didn't take the cub to a rescue if it was clearly abandoned? I know here with black bears any orphaned cubs are sent to rescues that raise them until they are ready for release or try to put them in with a sow if it's in winter."
bears,32jty0,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Wed Apr 15 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"Katmai National Park Services has a no intervention policy, but not if widlife is injured as a result of humans action - a sow was seen with a wire snare around her neck last Summer, National Park Services successfully track her down and removed the snare.   I think the policy is based on the thinking that brown bears that have been taken into care can be very difficult to be released back into the wild, especially for a young bear as it cannot learn how to catch its own food and know where to find a good denning site from humans. In many cases, bears in captivity learned to associate humans with food, there has been a case where two recently released young bears had to be put down because they ventured back into humans settlement to search for food."
bears,32jty0,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Wed Apr 15 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"That's a shame. I know here with the black bears that they try to minimize the human to bear interaction. They also make a serious effort to put cubs with adoptive mothers but I think they still have some good results with releases of ones that had to be reared by humans. Of course black bear and brown are completely different ballgames. I understand the reason, but it would still be hard for me to let an abandoned cub just wander. They are tougher than me!"
bears,32jty0,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Wed Apr 15 11:53:01 2015 UTC,"Agree, I imagine it would be a very tough job walking away from injured bears, kudos to the rangers!   A dying spring cub was found by Lake Brooks one evening, which is close to Brooks Camp, in late Autumn 2 years ago, there was nothing the rangers can do but to watch and wait. When they returned the next morning the cub is deceased. The rangers suspected the deceased cub belonged to the same litter as this abandoned yearling - his mother had 3 spring cubs in Summer 2013, when she returned to the river in Autumn she had 2, and after leaving den in Spring last year she was seen with one.  When I was in Brooks Camp last Autumn, a lone spring cub was spotted around the area for over two weeks, it must have been separated from its mother and a cub that young, there was no way it will survive Winter on its own. I saw it twice over two days but it hasn't been seen after, it's eerie seeing the cub walking around the camp on its own and knowing it is unlikely to be around long."
bears,32jty0,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Wed Apr 15 12:34:59 2015 UTC,"To be honest we were cleaning out the goat stalls today and my son found a baby mouse. Comparing it to pictures online it's around a day old. We couldn't find the nest or the mother so I have a baby mouse in a box with a heating pad and I've been feeding it kitten formula and wiping it's bum off and on all evening. We routinely set traps for mice, yet here I am bottle feeding one. When faced with a baby anything though I am helpless to resist. That's how I know there is zero chance I could let a cub wander like that. This is why I know my limitations and should never be a  ranger!"

I think giving extra care to baby anything is about being kind and fair - fair because it deserves a better start to life. Once it grew into adulthood then it is on them to make it themselves."

In short, it ended up being my favorite part of the trip.  In long, it's the greatest place on Earth. There is an awesome drive-through zoo portion where you can see all kinds of cool animals roaming around, and YOU'RE the one in the cage. There were wolves, bears, mountain goats, bison, and tons more. Then, you can get out of the car and go into a more traditional zoo environment that has more bears and other animals. When we went, there were 9 or 10 bear cubs that were really active. They were running around and wrestling each other, climbing and jumping off of trees, etc. I probably stayed there way too long and took a ton of pictures.  Yeah, I guess you could say I liked it."

bears,31jtjt,KodiakArrest,6,Sun Apr 5 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"Great to see* a Kodiak biologist here! I have a question about Kodiak bears I have been dying to ask: I've noticed Kodiak bears have a funny looking lip, a bit similar to those of Sloth Bears, the photo you posted shows it and my photo of Jake the Kodiak bear from Alaska Zoo. I haven't seen that in other brown bears - is this a known trait?   Also, when I was at Katmai National Park, a ranger told me that there are cases of coastal brown bears swimming to Kodiak Island, have there been cases of Kodiak bears swimming to the mainland?"
bears,31jtjt,970souk,2,Mon Apr 6 01:58:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took so long to reply, I didn't have time to reply at the time and kind of forgot about it until someone made a comment on it today. Bears don't have developed enough facial muscles to use expressions as any form of communication. They can roar, obviously, but they don't have the ability to curl their lip into a snarl like wolves can. If agitated, they will huff at you which will give some lip movement as well.  I wish I had a better answer for you, but my best guess is that they're just panting. It could be a known trait to someone with better knowledge than myself (I'm a salmon biologist, so I'm constantly around bears but don't study them directly) and I'll ask him next time I see him. It's really interesting that you've only noticed this in Kodiak bears, too. They've been separated from the mainland for so long that they're actually a genetically unique subspecies, so perhaps it's just a trait that has spread throughout the population (similar to a regional group of people might have darker skin, a big nose, or curly hair, perhaps Kodiak bears have slackened lips).  As far as the swimming goes, I'd be pretty doubtful. If a Katmai ranger has told you it happens, I'd believe them as they're the experts, but that's a minimum 23 mile swim we're talking about. Not impossible; polar bears can swim up to 30 miles, but Kodiak bears are big, fat, ungainly, and happy. Whether they could swim 23+ miles is up for debate (they're less aquatic than polar bears), but honestly, why leave Kodiak? They're the biggest brown bears on the planet because of our abundant resources. It might have happened, but I would put my money on black that it hasn't.   Hope this helped at least a bit- I'm not a bear biologist but I'm completely enthralled with them. I chose salmon biology because bears have been studied to death... as a researcher, there's not too much groundbreaking stuff left in that realm. So I chose to study their food, so I can make progress in my chosen field while still maintaining a close relationship with bears."
bears,31jtjt,970souk,1 point,Thu May 14 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks, I really appreciate your reply!!  Salmon are pretty cool, they are the life force of Katmai (and all regions around), the same ranger from Katmai NP called it ""sacrify"" - salmon returning to their place of birth, gave back to the land by way of spawning and dying, giving life to many others like bears, wolves, birds, and indirectly fertilise the vegetation. Just their homing instincts alone is fascinating, plus they don't feed once entering fresh water and manage to last a further 3-4 months in their natural life.   I didn't know anything about salmon except they taste good until I started learning about bears, I still don't know much! It's pretty cool that you get to study them in your field of work and be out there :)  I hope you will be making post here on /r/bears that tell us more about salmon!"

bears,2zst2p,970souk,9,Sat Mar 21 12:22:06 2015 UTC,"Photo by Rosi Bilder.  The magical story of Tips and Taps:   Once upon a time there was a tiny little polar bear cub named Elvis. This special cub, the last one born in the Memphis Zoo to date, was born in November of 1979 in the Memphis Zoo to the prolific polar bear parents, Bruno and Olga, and was named after the late, great Memphis resident Elvis Presley, who had died two year earlier.   Elvis the polar bear cub moved to Zoo Osnabrück in Germany in November of 1980, where he lived with another polar bear lady named Sonja, together with some European Brown Bears, in the same enclosure, strangely enough. Living in this bear commune were European Brown Bear sisters named Susi and Ossi.  After 24 years of living together, there was a surprise for Elvis and Susi (and the zookeepers) in January of 2004. Susi gave birth to twin cubs. Tips (the girl) and Taps (the boy) were Hybrids, half Polar Bear, half European Brown Bear. Susi wasn't interested, but her sister Ossi took care of the cubs.    More photos and article (in German) of the two in Polar Bear Germany."

bears,2ys2bu,WolfOnHigh,2,Thu Mar 12 11:11:23 2015 UTC,"Then they should move him to a more suitable enclosure; better yet, release him to go be a bear in the wild where he belongs."
bears,2ys2bu,WolfOnHigh,2,Thu Mar 12 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"That would be ideal wouldn't it? However, unlike most other wild animals in captivity, a bear can only survive in the wild if it learns the necessary survival skills from its mother in the wild. A bear cub that is separated from its mother in the wild is very unlikely to survive on its own, unless it is adopted by another sow but that is very rare. Therefore majority of orphaned cubs that were discovered by humans were transported to managed care."

Well, that being the case, as stated before, the least we (they) could do would be to , oh, I don't know, enhance his life somehow.  Maybe have people be his ""bear pack"", or whatever social matrix bears have.  It just doesn't seem right that he should be alone."
bears,2ys2bu,CubbyRed,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:04:30 2015 UTC,"I thought the toys are just perfect, Milk seems to enjoy them. As stated before, bears are solidary animals, with the exception of mating pairs and mothers with cubs, young adults bears have been seen playing but it is when they are not hungry - this is commonly seen in Falls for the brown bears and in November for the polar bears. Solidary creatures may seem lonely but it was us humans projecting our feelings onto them (empathy).   I think you would enjoy watching brown bears fishing for salmon at Brooks Fall at Katmai National Park in July, September and October, stay tune as there will be announcement and links when the webcams are live again!  There are some stories by the rangers at Katmai NP that I think you might find interesting:    Bear cub separated from mother Bear cub adopted by sow"

But people can also be kind, capable of love, respect and compassion. These things are not mutually exclusive - a person who commits an act of cruelty, is also capable of love. For this reason we should always strive to be kinder, to love more fiercely and to be a better person whenever we can. In doing so, we can inspire goodness in others."

The next morning they were going to go out to hunt but my uncle wasn't feeling good so she went out alone in the dark and climbed up into the stand. A little while later she said she thought she heard him wheezing and climbing up the ladder. She thought his cold/flu had gotten much worse. She said she opened the door for him and leaned out to see if he needed help and was face on face with a black bear. She screamed and she swore the bear was trying to scream too.

bears,2tagci,autowikibot,3,Thu Jan 22 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"Scrum (rugby union):       In rugby union a scrum is a means of restarting play after a minor infringement. It involves up to eight players from each team, known as the pack or forward pack, binding together in three rows and interlocking with the free opposing teams forwards. At this point the ball is fed into the gap between the two forward packs and they both compete for the ball to win possession. Teams can be penalised for intentionally causing the scrum to collapse, and for not putting the ball into the scrum correctly. A scrum is most commonly awarded when the ball is knocked forward, or passed forward, or when a ball becomes trapped in a ruck or maul. Because of the physical nature of scrums, injuries can occur, especially in the front row.

It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. Black bears are omnivores with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food. Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food.

Traditionally it is distinct from tattoo and tatau in that the skin was carved by uhi   (chisels) rather than punctured. This left the skin with grooves, rather than a smooth surface.  Captain James Cook wrote in 1769:  The marks in general are spirals drawn with great nicety and even elegance. One side corresponds with the other. The marks on the body resemble foliage in old chased ornaments, convolutions of filigree work, but in these they have such a luxury of forms that of a hundred which at first appeared exactly the same no two were formed alike on close examination.

The one on display that I saw is a very Ron Weasley red head. I have yet to see one alive but have encountered several black bears around the neighborhood, so I am hopeful that I'll get to see one of the cinnamon ones eventually. My neighbor has seen one several times a larger male."

I hope you do get to see your ginger bear :) The more i read about bears the more positive I feel about them (not that I didn't already ready love them). I guess I'm less scared now. If you follow the right advice chances are very high of having a good experience with bears. One day I will come see them in the wild."

bears,2ns7vz,JohnQuittenton,7,Sun Nov 30 00:52:44 2014 UTC,What I want to know is where do they actually hibernate?  Everyone's mind goes to caves immediately but in many areas caves don't really exist.
bears,2ns7vz,slapknuts,8,Sun Nov 30 06:24:36 2014 UTC,"Black bears usually sleep in a hollow they can find, usually in tree roots, sometimes it doesn't even fit them leaving part of their body exposed to the elements.  Brown bears use muscle in their shoulder hump to dig a hole on hillside, normally facing North so the den's entrance would be covered by snow, a short video of a brown bear's den here.  Polar bears don't den, only pregnant female den. Their snow den would usually be found on sea ice but increasing number of polar bear den is found on land. Polar bears are ""walking hibernators"" in Summer, as they cannot hunt seals on sea ice and easily overheat hunting game on land.  Bears that can find food during Winter don't hibernate/den, eg. sun bears, giant pandas, sloth bears, moon bears, not sure about andean bears. Some male bears on Kodiak Island don't den either."

bears,2l5lyi,Accidental-Genius,3,Mon Nov 3 20:03:26 2014 UTC,"They are! No other colorations, these are the only 2 subspecies of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca and Ailuropoda melanoleuca  qinlingensis)."
bears,2l5lyi,autowikibot,2,Mon Nov 3 22:25:45 2014 UTC,"Section 6. Subspecies of article  Giant panda:       Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, color patterns, and population genetics (Wan et al., 2005).   The nominate subspecies Ailuropoda melanoleuca consists of most extant populations of panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colors. The Qinling panda, A. m. qinlingensis  is restricted to the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of 1300–3000 m. The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant pandas is replaced with a dark brown versus light brown pattern. The skull of A. m. qinlingensis is smaller than its relatives, and it has larger molars.   A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012  confirms that the separation of the Qinlin population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinlin population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.

Bears do not engage in eye contacts unless they wanted to pick a fight.   Check out the below:  Myth #1: Bears are unpredictable  Fact: Bears use body language and vocalizations to show their intentions. Learning about bear behaviour can be beneficial to people who live or recreate in bear country.  For more, check out bears wiki for bear related resources!"
bears,2kqh7f,sdhov,8,Thu Oct 30 00:47:54 2014 UTC,"My first thought was the Kodiak bears but they are actually the largest brown bear subspecies.   Kodiak bears are the largest bears in the world. A large male can stand over 10' tall when on his hind legs, and 5' when on all four legs. They weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Females are about 20% smaller, and 30% lighter than males.   Source. So, scrap that :)  Then I thought about the Asiatic black bears, aka Moon bears, since they are also found on the island of Taiwan and is known as the Formosan black bears. According to this source:   Formosan black bears range in size from 47"" to 75"" in height and weigh from 110 lbs. to 440 lbs.   Comparing to their mainland counterparts, source:   Asiatic black bears are considered to be ""medium"" sized bears with bodies ranging from 50 to 77 inches in length and weight variation of 220 to 440 pounds.    The same site also mentioned Japanese black bears being smaller:   Other than the fact that they are a bit smaller, Japanese black bears appear very much like the average Asian black bear. On average, they measure between 43 and 60 inches in length and weigh between 130 and 260 pounds. Females measure approximately 75 percent the size of males.   I haven't heard of any island dwarfism in bears but I don't know much about bear biology, am eagerly waiting for someone who know to tell us more!"
bears,2kqh7f,970souk,2,Thu Oct 30 01:21:36 2014 UTC,"According to this 2004 study which looked at a larger data set than earlier ones establishing the island dwarfism theory there is ""no consistent trend in the relative sizes of insular forms""   However:   Patterns of variation in body size of insular carnivores are more complicated than the island rule (Lomolino 1985) predicts. Island carnivores do often differ from mainland ones in very striking ways. However, they do not do so in a very predictable and apparent pattern.    In 2006 this paper notes that the island rule i.e. ""large mammals are usually smaller on islands (Kurten, 1953), small mammals often grow larger. Van Valen (1973) termed this pattern ‘the island rule’.""   Is not well supported for carnivores:   Our results suggest that the island rule does not apply to carnivores. Nor do we think it applies to bears – the ursid pattern probably rests on the shoulders of giant insular black bears, Ursus americanus Pallas, rather than on those of dwarf grizzlies (Ursus arctos L.). In fact, both bear species are on average larger on islands than on the adjacent mainland. Food availability may drive size patterns in these populations. P. Raia and S. Meiri (unpubl. data) suggest that ungulates usually exhibit dwarfism on islands, while carnivore size is closely related to the relative abundance and size spectrum of available resources.    TL;DR The island rule is too general, and to the extent it is true may only apply to herbivores"

His guess is that the ""bear found and controlled the dead bison from the start. It's not really touched yet and it's very recent activity so the wolves likely got nothing.""

bears,2gwrig,Joe1096,5,Sat Sep 20 00:13:13 2014 UTC,"I'd say it's the bear, bears are solidary creatures who do not confront unless they absolutely have to. Looking at the posture of this bear - head bow, ears back, indirect eye contact - it seems that the bear is submitting to the wolf, who appears to be more aggressive.    Edit: So OP's photo sequence is not as I expected, but I based my observation from my own experience and studies from below:    Bears communicate with each other by establishing a hierarchy or pecking order in situations where they encounter each other. It isn't always size that makes one bear dominant over another, it's the attitude of the dominant bear, or ""alpha,"" who is always in charge. Bears communicate their dominance by intimidating their opponent. Bears do not fight with each other unless it's absolutely necessary. Fight risks injury, and that is not the bear's objective.

bears,2gdfpn,970souk,3,Sun Sep 14 15:12:00 2014 UTC,"I was surprised to see this as I thought bears are generally solidary, perhaps that applies most to brown and polar bears? Are black bears social? These two are not related but probably shared the same enclosure for some time, perhaps bears in captivity behave differently and have to adapt to being more tolerant of other bears."
bears,2gdfpn,Squirrelboi,3,Sun Sep 14 15:14:47 2014 UTC,I would say this is definitely more due to them being in captivity. Brown bears are generally more social than black bears and even then it's only when there's food source they're all sharing (e.g. Salmon).

bears,2f7iua,Wazer,61,Tue Sep 2 16:08:26 2014 UTC,"Yep, on the Pacific Crest Trail in California a few years ago I was part of a group of teenaged girls heating some bacon over a little camp stove. A black bear decided this smelled delicious, and meandered into our little camp. We stood banging pots like the little lecture beforehand said, and he broke into a 'charge' of maybe 2 or 3 steps. Four of the girls peeled off and ran shrieking in different directions (going for help, they later claimed, when they returned to camp without alerting anyone). When they did, the bear panicked and rushed back to the base of the nearest sturdy looking tree, like ""fuck, this bacon is protected by banshees!"" He paused at the base of the tree, staring at me and the other girl who was left, all three of us just standing there kind of dumbfounded at the turn of events (the forestry man had assured us running or making high-pitched noises would cause the bear to give chase. Not so much). Eventually, after what felt like a long time but couldn't have been more than a minute, this absolutely dejected demeanor comes over the bear, realizing he stands no chance against 150 lbs of teenaged girls armed with a wooden spoon and pot lid and a bottle of sunscreen (Heather, you were never a bright girl, but at least you faced the bear) and he starts to shuffle away, looking over his shoulder occasionally to make sure no banshees were about to attack and to give us looks that clearly say ""aw, fuck you bacon hogs""."

bears,2f7iua,maxelrod,2,Tue Sep 2 16:03:46 2014 UTC,Combine a bears natural ability to go for long periods without food and water with the fact it wasn't a bucket.  It was an airbag. The kind used as adjustable shocks. It was a tube of thick rubber so it could still drink.
bears,2f7iua,totes_meta_bot,1 point,Tue Sep 2 18:25:53 2014 UTC,I think bears can go for months without food and water. Because the whole hibernation thing... They live off the burning of fat which creates water.

Black bears can still seriously cause damage to a person though. My guess is that having been stuck in a bucket for a month or so it didn't have the energy to fight back, and was probably scared. Also that guy that was on him was pretty big.  Still, I don't know that I would have had the guts to get that close, but I'm glad someone else does."

bears,2f7iua,bloodguard,14,Tue Sep 2 15:58:21 2014 UTC,"Maybe, not knowing how long the bear had been without food, they couldn't know what dose of tranquilizer to use.  Use too much, kill the bear.  Use too little, he might maul you."

bears,2f7iua,observationalhumour,2,Tue Sep 2 17:26:35 2014 UTC,"In general, I think the government will not have its employees risk their lives unless human life is also at risk.  When (not if, but when) someone is injured or dies in the rescue of on animal, then the government would be responsible for taking care of the human that is injured, or providing compensation for their death.  So we will pay for people to kill animals we consider a threat, or to grab animals considered a threat or nuisance to humans.  But if an animal is in trouble and also capable of injuring a human, then generally it's up to volunteers and not paid employees to do something about it."

bears,2cvx44,970souk,3,Thu Aug 7 14:47:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the link. I think I did most of what was suggested. That seems to work well for most bears, but this one in particular doesn't seemed to be deterred by the usual methods. I tried standing my ground and being loud, but had to abandon that approach when he was almost within reaching distance and still not backing down. There is no food or garbage outside my house, so I'm not sure what is attracting him. I'll pick up some bear spray for now just to be on the safe side and hope that he moves on. If not, fencing may be the only alternative. Thanks."
bears,2cvx44,helloz00,11,Thu Aug 7 15:28:10 2014 UTC,Might want to call the state park for advice.
bears,2cvx44,ppphhh,5,Thu Aug 7 14:59:48 2014 UTC,"Contact the authorities for the park, or whoever deals with animal problems in your area. The recommendation is to remove whatever is attracting the bear and chase it away, but in your case obviously that won't work. Black bears aren't usually dangerous but you don't want it to find a way in while you're asleep, or start getting used to the shotgun blasts and charge you while you're on the way to your car. I'm no bear expert and I don't know how likely that is, but it sounds like you've got yourself an unusual bear in the first place. Is there anything in your house that might be wafting outside?   Normally the park will have some big bear bin on a truck they can use to scoop him up and take him away if he's causing problems. I'd call them before it becomes an issue."
bears,2cvx44,Thebaconbull,6,Thu Aug 7 17:26:26 2014 UTC,"Contact the park service ASAP.   Edit: I'm serious, when I was living in a similar situation I had a bear act really close to what you are describing and one night it tried to break through my front door. I called the authorities and sat there with my bear spray and machete ready to go."
bears,2cvx44,rock-o3000,2,Fri Aug 8 00:29:35 2014 UTC,"This might very well offend some people, and I am sorry, it is not my intent. But is shooting the bear not an option?  Is it an ethical thing, national park thing or a general legal thing? I hear they make good steaks."

In the canadian wilderness to see bears? If so that is soo very awesome.  Also this show caused me to subscribe to this subreddit so was excited to see it on here. It is wonderful and it did cause me a little stress too as there were ups and downs.
bears,2cv7yu,Q8COAS,1 point,Thu Aug 7 23:13:32 2014 UTC,"Thank you again! I will prepare myself better before watching episode 2 :) It was interesting that even though I knew about all the brutalities of the bears' world, watching it happening was gut-wrenching.   Will be going to Katmai NP in Alaska! Will have a couple of days there, hopefully it will be as awesome as I imagine it would be!  Like you, I was inspired by watching brown bears on Explore.org's webcam from a link on reddit last July, subscribed to /r/bears, and the rest is history :)   Chris Morgan did a couple of live chats on the bear webcam so I was familiar with him before knowing about Great Bear Stakeout, another series I hope to watch is City of Bears, I am hoping I will be able to watch it online when I get to the US.  (note: the webcam is down at the moment)"

Specialists sometimes call the grizzly the North American brown bear because the grizzly and the brown bear are one species on two continents.
