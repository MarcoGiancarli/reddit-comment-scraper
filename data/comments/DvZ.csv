DvZ,3e2ij5,Dabusco7,8,Tue Jul 21 14:05:58 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to know whether to comment on this as a new map in its own right or as a remake of the original. Full disclosure: I absolutely loved the original Dogekac and felt it was almost perfect for the way the game worked at the time, and have generally been against the idea of remaking Doge or any other map for reasons I've given elsewhere. Apologies if I mostly focus on my concerns here and don't really comment on the positives - it's not that I have nothing nice to say, just that my comment will already be too long-winded and boring without that.  The exterior is certainly reminiscent of the old map and the monster side in particular feels very familiar. I wonder if the first shrine might be poorly positioned though, because you've effectively made it so that monsters can only attack it from behind (monsters must go beyond the shrine and double back to reach it) which is something of an oddity in DvZ. The courtyard area between the first shrine and the stairs to the keep feels very empty and flat, which makes me worry that monsters will have a hard time once they start spawning at the first shrine, as they have no cover to speak of and are easy targets for dwarven bow spam. I'd suggest putting some log piles in the courtyard as per the original map, and possibly moving the quarry to a more familiar location, and adding any more cover you feel appropriate for mobs as currently I can foresee situations where monsters are forced to climb the hills at the sides to make progress once the first shrine falls.  The change to the bridge is something I'm having trouble comprehending. Based on another comment about the bridge, this was done to make it easier for dwarves to hold the bridge? What you've actually done though is to remove the 'easy' bridge (the ""man bridge"") and in its place put the original ""danger bridge"". Monsters can just drop straight down onto it and the dwarves are mostly powerless to stop them - that's why the original danger cave/bridge was defended by the very bravest dwarves, because you never knew what was about to drop on your head. The ""bridge"" at the danger cave might actually be safer now because it's level with the lava, making it much easier to get back up if you're knocked off.  It would be nice if the jungle could be extended towards the ravine a bit more - partly because cover for monsters around the edges is currently very minimal, and also because if this is intended as a remake of Dogekac then it would be nice to incorporate as much of the gameplay and general atmosphere of the original map as possible, and currently I don't think the jungle can be realistically used to the extent it used to be (sneaky monsters jumping to the front wall, and skeletons in the trees).  The keep is entirely different from the original map so I have no feedback rooted in nostalgia, but do have some concerns regarding the front section of the keep exterior. The first staircase is rather tall and narrow, and stairs in DvZ are generally not very fun. From a mostly aesthetic point of view, the one-wide paths either side of the staircase (leading to the quarry on one side and the saws on the other) look strange and very cramped, and this part where a route into the keep from the saws is blocked is also weird (because it's more accessible than the aforementioned one-wide path, it seems like it should be the main route inside from the saws, but it's blocked).  I'm not sure I agree that the final shrine room is more spacious; it's certainly longer, but if the shrine is moved to the floor as shown in another comment the room is pretty similar in size, as that platform thing basically just extends the tunnels. Not sure what your exact intentions are for the final shrine placement but I'd suggest removing that podium. (This is pure opinion, but it also feels like you've gone a little over the top with the Cake God stuff down there. Also, as a veeeeerrrry specific comment, the staircases leading down from second shrine have very low ceilings which make jumping down them as a monster impossible, and that was something I loved doing on Doge!)  Overall I would suggest that nothing is gained by the modifications to the bridges and the map would flow better, and play on the nostalgia element better, if the bridges were more similar to the original map, i.e. moving the main bridge to the top of the ravine. This would also remove the need to get stuck in the strange labyrinthine section under the first shrine. I'd like to see how the lower ""bridge"" plays with the AIs before commenting further on that, it may be better like this. I'd also like to see the jungle extended outwards and possibly have the first shrine moved to a more sensible location."
DvZ,3e2ij5,Tomlough,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Something I find strange about the First Shrine is it's reliant on monsters going through the tunnels to meet the 20-30 second Spawn-to-Shrine run time. But one of the upgrades Zombies can get almost straight away is the leap, essentially allowing them to just Jump the ravine and be at First in about 10 seconds. I think it would work better if the bridge was reinstated as the main path and First Shrine was removed entirely. The extra cover around the courtyard could be added in as you suggested and then have Second brought outside before the Main Keep and just run it as a 2 Shrine Map."
DvZ,3e2ij5,Doom_BringerMC,4,Tue Jul 21 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"I've had a look around the map and these are my main concerns about it:   The tunnels leading from Mob spawn to the first Shrine are way too small for a main path. You need to fix this hole beneath the Second Shrine. Once it explodes anyone can fall in it and just be stuck. You've requested this area be Protected but regardless if it is protected or not I'm fairly certain it's still in the Shrine Capture radius, meaning mobs can just capture the Shrine from here even if it is protected. You've requested the Spawn be set here but there isn't really anything important there. It would make a lot more sense if it was by the Second Shrine since it's where all the pots, swords, bows and tools are as well as the armoury. I think the elevated platform for the Final Shrine favours mobs. With all the knockback going on it would be very easy for mobs to just stop Dwarves being able to get up. Realistically only Heroes would be able to hold it."

DvZ,3e2ij5,Dabusco7,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:32 2015 UTC,"For the most part, the lava is 1 deep, however in some spots it is 2 or 3 deep-- but it's only about 10%.  Muffin is currently working on sorting that out.  The flatlands are not really something to worry about, we'll put barrier blocks around the border to make sure they can't do that."
DvZ,3e2ij5,zzCratoszz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:52 2015 UTC,Barrier blocks can cause lag even if you don't see them. And unless you make walls and a ceiling we can just stack out with blocks or light bows anyway.

DvZ,3e2ij5,ArchasTL,6,Tue Jul 21 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed that the main bridge was removed, given it was such an iconic part of the original map, though I do understand the advent of ogres and goblins makes ""man-moding"" far more difficult and lethal than it used to be. I'm okay with it, though it shall be missed. ;_;  Perhaps I'm a slave to nostalgia, but I do prefer the old map's exterior. I liked the mass of jungled area around the keep's courtyard, the way the keep's outer walls and ramparts were developed. The keep in particular just looks strange from the outside; I'm aware this is a very subjective idea, but parts of the keep, particularly the two guard towers behind the first shrine, look out-of-place and/or crudely constructed, as though they were made of spammed blocks and not deliberately placed. Additionally, I fear dwarven archers may be too strong at the first shrine, given that the main bridge is gone and monsters have no real defense against rangers pelting them with arrows across the gorge. Archers are in no real state of danger at the start of the match, which admittedly is one of the perks of archery (less vulnerable to attack), but I think it might be too prevalent here.  I love the interior of the keep; its reimagining is quite well done, and although I'll miss the utter chaos of the original's multi-tiered staircase area, this is a great alternative that promises to play well. Pretty much no complaints about the keep itself.  Again, this is all very personal, subjective criticism as far as the exterior goes. I'll have to see how the map plays out in a real game to more accurately judge archer balance in particular, but I do like this reimagining of one of the classic DvZ maps. Well done, folks."

DvZ,3e2ij5,Dabusco7,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:16 2015 UTC,"The bridge on old Dogekac was the biggest problem when it came down to it.  A lot of people said they loved the map, enjoyed the thrill and risk involved with the ravine, but while they reveled in the combat style, some relished the impracticality.  The aim of removing the bridge was to attempt to reduce the frustration of dwarves, as well as monsters, while defending/attacking the main routes.  While the difference certainly detracts from the old ""Doge"" feel, I believe it will be much more new-player friendly, while also offering something new for the older players.

Remember the old doge when second was useless and nobody defended it...Then we just got screwed over if you tried.... and even if you held first perfectly you ran to third because second was so broken and useless nobody could defend it and i'm looking at this and I get horror flashbacks   Ill be the first to admit it doge was a first shrine map that isn't something that anyone needs for map flow and fun gameplay when once an ogre or a gobo knocks you into the lava THAT IS DEEPER NOW your basically screwed looking at those cliff walls.   all i really see here is just little changes to doge and some are good but all you've done is made some graphical improvements at the cost to game play please don't be cod come up with new ideas  If this gets added I am down to playing archives,grove,Machine and sometimes plains."
DvZ,3e2ij5,tipitonmine,4,Tue Jul 21 20:38:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, when we made Dogekac, it was before the multi-shrine system. Nisovin added in first and second afterwards, but the map was never designed with their locations in mind.  As an additional comment, I find the attitude of avoiding maps in general to be a little disappointing, I got a lot of fun in learning how to defend some of the old 'broken' maps."
DvZ,3e2ij5,Dabusco7,0,Tue Jul 21 22:14:54 2015 UTC,"I've said it before ill say it again remakes aren't good for dvz we turn into Ubisoft......  I avoid maps i don't like hence why i have played de_dust2 3 times  I understand you put work into this but it doesn't fit into the new dvz especially with the new update we need maps that aren't tedious to play and feel like a chore to constantly build up while gobos, leaping zombies, and ogres knock you down into a pit of lava that is near impossible to escape."
DvZ,3e2ij5,Tomlough,4,Tue Jul 21 22:22:52 2015 UTC,"I believe there's a different connotation to remakes here.  Counter Strike has been around for a decade, and they've gone through countless graphical improvements and upgrades.  It's also a multi-million dollar game, with professional gamers winning hundreds of thousands of dollars competitively each year.  DvZ doesn't even have a competitive aspect.  When Dogekac was first introduced, leaderboards didnt even exist.  Then, with that playstyle, doge was good.  People liked a challenge, they loved to roleplay, and very few people complained about how easy it was to die.  Did the Old Man teach you not to fear death, or did you not listen?    Anyways, as soon as people started to worry about shovel kills and leaderboards and titles, people joining to this new atmosphere hated Dogekac.  The mod team for PMC did not hesitate to remove the map from the rotation, and I completely understood.  I knew, and they knew it didn't fit the new game.    Old Doge was good for it's playstyle, New Doge may be just as good for the current one.  We're making changes, we're taking opinions, and creating a better map.  What we want is to let people have their nostalgia, while still making a newer and better map, that isn't just like the old one.  People can relish in nostalgia all they want, but eventually it will just be annoying to them.  So if you don't want to play our map, go ahead.  You have a right to your opinion.  But DvZ isn't going to become a grotesque monster of a game as a result of an old map made new.  You just have to make sure you do it right.  Here's to hoping we did do it right."
DvZ,3e2ij5,Dabusco7,4,Tue Jul 21 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"Anyways, as soon as people started to worry about shovel kills and leaderboards and titles, people joining to this new atmosphere hated Dogekac. The mod team for PMC did not hesitate to remove the map from the rotation, and I completely understood. I knew, and they knew it didn't fit the new game.   This is incorrect, Dogekac was in rotation on PMC from pretty much the moment it opened in beta right up until the end of May 2014. It was removed, along with every map in rotation at the time, for the release of the 'June update' of that year which featured an entirely new map rotation. Its removal was nothing whatsoever to do with leaderboards and titles (and nothing to do with the PMC mod team). Dogekac and Mt Willakers were the only maps which were never removed from the rotation for any reason between the Gym and the June update (which required new things from maps, hence the change).  It had people who disliked it just as any map does, but it was one of the most popular maps ever and was largely missed when it was removed. During the period before the update on PMC where the rotation was limited to 3 maps, Doge was often the only map people were willing to join for 'another game' because it was the only map of the three which provided a reliably enjoyable experience as both a dwarf and a monster. So I have no idea where you get the idea that people hated Dogekac, or that its removal had the slightest thing to do with leaderboards when it coexisted with the boards for the majority of its lifetime."
DvZ,3e2ij5,Tomlough,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:32:24 2015 UTC,"That's all I got from my perspective.  While I know you're right about the map rotation getting a wipe, I still think the call for new maps was as a result of a changing playstyle.  While any set of maps runs out it's playability eventually, I have some feeling that it didn't last as long as it would have if not for the points I made about competitiveness.  You are definitely very experienced, and I agree with your points on the subject.  I just wanted to make that clarification."
DvZ,3e2ij5,Doom_BringerMC,4,Wed Jul 22 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"The June update last year was pretty much a whole new game, that's when AI zombies were added, blue glue, upgrades and the OP heroes. The call for new maps was due to a changing playstyle, but not in the way you seem to think - the update meant that the game played completely differently and this warranted new, larger maps. It wasn't the result of a changing playstyle, it was in anticipation of a changing playstyle.  You can argue that some changes in the update itself were influenced by competitiveness in the game, but it's still inaccurate to claim that Doge was removed for that reason. I'm really not sure what you mean when you say it ""didn't last as long as it would have"" if not for competitiveness, when Doge lasted until the very last moment before a total change in both the map rotation and the game as a whole."
DvZ,3e2ij5,tipitonmine,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"Remakes are something I am very much against. You're essentially trying to balance Nostalgia with Playability and you're always going to loose. If you pander to the veterans and make it more nostalgic it generally won't play well and may not be playable at all. Not to mention you're reaching for such high expectations to begin with. I'm certain if you took the Gym Maps with the Gym mechanics and re-introduced them people would still complain it's not the same because things like Nostalgia have a tendency to exaggerate the feelings you had for it over-time to a point where it's unlikely to ever be the same. You forget some of the bad aspects in favour of the good ones giving an all round unrealistic expectation. If you drop some of the original features in order to improve the playability then the point of remaking it is redundant. You're no longer adapting it to be new you're just recycling old concepts which in many ways just cheapens the original. This has a much greater impact then you may think because while it mostly affects long-term players, these are the same people that have hyped up the map for newer players and a remake would just be underwhelming because it can't be the same to be playable. The other thing is that so many maps since Dogekac have had Ravines in them that its key feature isn't anything special anymore. And finally hitting that perfect balance between Nostalgia and Playability will just be underwhelming for all. Veterans will get a dumbed down version of what they remember that plays decently because it's still trying to incorporate old mechanics. I don't believe when making a map you should be jeopardising playability for something like nostalgia. Dogekac worked so well and was loved by so many because it was made for how DvZ played at the time. You're much more likely to recapture that by building something new from the ground up to work best with the new mechanics because that's how it was built before. A new Dogekac doesn't have to be a remake."

DvZ,3e3y3y,TheAeronoksGS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:05 2015 UTC,Were they not adding the ability to have different textures for the durability of the item in 1.9? that might work as well.

DvZ,3e33vn,johnb43,4,Tue Jul 21 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"Armor shred right now is a misleading stat, because the game doesn't take into account how much armor is actually shredded; it looks at how much armor shred you do per attack, and multiplies that number by the amount of attacks you successfully performed in that life. It does NOT take into account whether or not those attacks actually broke armor. You'll still get armor shred points on a hero, or a Jimmy with completely shattered armor, obfuscating the true amount of shredding you've done. I think this also applies to skeletons shooting AI, though I could be wrong on that, since I haven't played a skeleton in some time.  I'd personally like to see individual kill counts as a dwarf and monster. It'd be cool to see what monsters (discounting AI) you kill the most as a dwarf, and how many dwarves you kill as each type of monster. Hero kills as a monster would be interesting too, because although the idea of padding stats would lead to heroes being targeted more than they are now, it would help pressure the heroes (who are already damn near invincible) and slightly suppress their overwhelming offensive presence on the battlefield, forcing retreat and displacing hero positioning. It would offer a subtle, yet tangible, tactical benefit.  EDIT: Another cool thing would be usage rates for different items. For instance, list the percentage of games you've used the Axe of Malice compared to the greater runeblade or the Elven Dagger. It might be complicated to do, but I like statistics, and it'd be cool to compare item usage stats across a large selection of dwarves."

Although I mostly enjoy playing monster and would get more use from a stat like ""dwarves killed"" than ""monsters killed"", I agree with the reasoning behind not showing that information and don't think it would be healthy for the game. Perhaps it would be useful/interesting though if we could have a breakdown of how many dwarves you kill as each type of monster, but only as a percentage?"
DvZ,3e33vn,Tomlough,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, it does lead to a leaderboard-esque mentality, just not as publicly available. Your idea for a percentage-based tally is acceptable as well, and serves more to judge your efficacy as individual monsters in killing dwarves than serving as a numerical tally of how many times you've killed Jimmy. I'd be okay with that."

Rob and Nisovin made a conscious effort in the past to take rearmoring out of the game, so its reasonable to assume they didn't intend to reintroduce it. Until one of them really make a statement about this instance of rearmoring though, everything is really just speculation.  Personally though, I don't like the idea of rearmoring people, especially if it uses no gold. Its a cheap way of getting around a system where gold is important to your survival, and if people have the opportunity to exploit something like that to death, they will."

DvZ,3dsuho,NikoUY,3,Sun Jul 19 12:12:29 2015 UTC,"These are great but at the same time are kinda cheaty, with multiple textures is easier to target mobs in a crowd and is also much easier to get a proc because you don't need to keep track of the names (not as much at least) if you are fighting a bunch of zombies.  Even if optifine is allowed now I think this feature is particular shouldn't be allowed.  Edit: if you played when Zombies were able to spawn with armor then you know how much easier was to target those mobs for a proc, this can create a similar situation."
DvZ,3dsuho,Overhighlord,3,Sun Jul 19 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"The ability to cheat or give yourself an advantage has always been a potential issue when it comes to resource packs regardless of Optifine. I could make a pack without a fire texture, or with a smaller texture, and now the view obscuring factor of Fire Skellies is null and void. There are a range of ways to cheat using resource packs regardless of this feature."
DvZ,3dsuho,NikoUY,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:24:45 2015 UTC,There are enough different looking zombies to make targeting hard.
DvZ,3dsuho,Overhighlord,3,Sun Jul 19 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Actually the more you have the easier it gets because you are less likely to find Zombies (or any mob) with the same skin together.
DvZ,3dsuho,figsandthings,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"When playing with it, it seemed like that there was (more or less)an equal amount of each skins for the monsters, so targeting wasn't made too much easier."
DvZ,3dsuho,Overhighlord,4,Sun Jul 19 19:45:29 2015 UTC,"Assuming there's an equal chance of each Zombie skin appearing, then you'd be less likely to lose your target due to a zombie having the skin. There's six Zombie skins, so each would have 1/6 of a chance of appearing (Approximately 17% each, rounding). That means that if you're focusing on one Zombies, the probability of an arbitrary Zombie having the same texture is 1/6. That's why targeting is theoretically easier, because 1/6 of the Zombies have the same skin instead of all of them. Obviously, there's other factors that could influence though. You could get instances of 100 zombies spawning in a row all with the same skin, but over long periods of time it would even out."

If it can be done there wouldn't really be a way to force specific textures at certain times (I'm assuming you'd want different bow designs for each kind of bow). You can specify the properties for each texture to make some appear with greater frequency then others and you can determine skins based on Biomes but I don't think you can force the texture. And either way the skins are client side so players would see different designs than you. Unless of course you used the Biome in some way. And it may or may not be a new map."

Some jimmies think its more fun to spam torches so they have easy torch farms when they go mob that game.

DvZ,3dl8xn,tipitonmine,3,Fri Jul 17 04:29:53 2015 UTC,Just dump mana into zombie if you like seeing a number increase all the time
DvZ,3dl8xn,HypothermicIce,2,Fri Jul 17 06:52:31 2015 UTC,I can already see a problem with that. Just imagine what could be done with the double mana monsters and rats. Some mobs could just focus on sending mana to a couple others and we would have maxed out zombies before the first wall even falls. How is poor jimmy supposed to know  if a zombie is just easy prey or a maxed out one that could possibly kill him. The thing about DvZ is that the point is that mobs get stronger as the game progress and shrines and jimmies die. If I misunderstood your post please let me know and I will fix it.
DvZ,3dl8xn,AlphaChilli,0,Fri Jul 17 10:24:08 2015 UTC,"Seems like a pretty OP upgrade. Even if it was set as a final upgrade like fury of the night it wouldn't take long to get it because gobo's have such a short upgrade path. Plus, like HypothermicIce said, you should be dumping your mana into zombie. A fully upgraded zombie is more consistent than a fully upgraded gobo."
DvZ,3dh2ak,SuiSca,4,Thu Jul 16 05:28:01 2015 UTC,Unless I'm mistaken isn't Fury only active at night regardless of light level?   Otherwise looks good :P

DvZ,3dh2ak,Tomlough,3,Thu Jul 16 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"If you're almost dead, retreat a bit.   I think this depends. If you're almost dead and the dwarves are desperate for a proc, then retreat for the benefit of other monsters. If someone already has a proc though, or there are no other monsters nearby, then letting yourself get killed is often the better option because if you have rebirth, you can pop right back there at full health. Natural health regen for zombies sucks, so if you choose to retreat then you'll be cowering in a corner for quite a while.  The only downside really is the Axe of Malice cooldown but on balance that's probably not a big deal."
DvZ,3dh2ak,Lex_L,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:59:32 2015 UTC,Never thought of this; sounds like a good idea. I'll add it in my next round of edits.
DvZ,3dh2ak,Tomlough,2,Thu Jul 16 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"Solid advice, good work!  I have two tips for more advanced zombie players. The first one is triggering your arrow resistance very quickly after you rebirth. Basically, every time you spawn in as a monster, you'll be regenerating health in the first 4/5 seconds. If you get hit by an arrow in that time frame, you will heal through the damage and have a 95% resistance against further arrows for a short amount of time. So, it might sound strange, but when you rebirth, try to get shot immediately.  The second tip is to fight dwarves with your fist instead of your Makeshift Blade. Your fist does equal armor damage and heals you for the same amount per hit. Pursuit doesn't work, nor does leap, but should you need those, quickly switch to your blade and back again. The reason you would want to fist punch a dwarf is because you will do a lot less health damage to a dwarf. That creates the false impression of a weak zombie. A dwarf will be more likely to want to stay and fight you, rather than run away, and thus make it easier for you to shred armor. Once the armor is low, switch to your blade and finish it."
DvZ,3dh2ak,Lex_L,4,Thu Jul 16 09:19:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the second point.  You should be aiming to deal more damage, not less, because it costs mana to heal - especially in the case of dwarves with Jimmy Juice. If you're shredding a dwarf's armour, you should also be trying to get their mana down as low as possible to give them an urgent need to repair. Low armour or low mana are both reasonably easy situations to recover from, it's when they combine that dwarves die.  Additionally, a dwarf with crappy broken armour and blood everywhere is a beacon to other monsters to focus and kill."
DvZ,3dh2ak,Tomlough,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:05:17 2015 UTC,"The best way to lower mana is to lower armor. The quickest way to lower armor is to stay in a fight. The easiest way to entice a dwarf to stay in a fight is to lower your health damage output. It's a trade-off: more armor damage, less health damage. Well... until that armor is black and crumpled, at which point you can overwhelm the dwarf with an unexpected outburst of speed and health damage from the makeshift blade."
DvZ,3dh2ak,Lex_L,3,Thu Jul 16 10:33:43 2015 UTC,"I think you might be overestimating the psychological impact of fisting Jimmy. I'm sure there are definitely situations where this would be advantageous (just like I used to occasionally pretend to be an AI zombie to avoid trouble) but the majority of the time there's no good reason not to attack a dwarf's health as well as their armour.  In other words, while it's definitely a useful tidbit to bear in mind, I don't think people should be encouraged to forgo dealing full damage as a general rule."
DvZ,3dh2ak,TheEpitomE8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:38:51 2015 UTC,"True, and my apologies if I've presented this too much as a general strategy, rather than the situational tactic it is."
DvZ,3dh2ak,Tomlough,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:06:32 2015 UTC,"but the route doesn't matter as much as the destination.   I'd say the route is just as important as your destination. Picking the right upgrades early will get you to Fury much faster. I like to upgrade health first untill I get to Rebirth, which is the first skill I will try to max out. Rebirth's high chance to proc makes it so you are practically always in the fight and if you are behind enemy lines you will be able to break so many torches. After maxing Rebirth, I put the remainder of my mana in damage upgrades to get more mana per torch.  Torches are basically your only target in the early game. It really helps to have health upgraded first, so you are tankier and able to live just a little longer to be able to get away and get even more torches. Leap synergizes great with this.   Overall, I find myself to have Fury unlocked by the second night and with lucky rat waves, even before that or even before first shrine falls."
DvZ,3dh2ak,Lex_L,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:44:50 2015 UTC,"I find myself willing to skip Fury and spend the mana jumping straight to Kaboom on goblin instead, because the extra choice that opens up for the same mana cost (+25) is a lot more useful to me.  If I have the mana to spare I'll eventually come back and get Fury, but I don't miss it if I don't have it whereas I would miss Leap or Rebirth."

In the current game, walls need to be at least 7+ thick to even have a chance of not being melted by a single goblin that deposits their load all over the wall. A slab once took a while to kill, with goblins just a case of wait on bombs to go and gone. Slab thickness is no more good. double and more is needed."

However  2) ""Nether"" has a double meaning in Minecraft, so you have the possibility of a rather decent pun if you worked more Minecraft nether stuff into the build.  3) Flat is usually a pretty bad idea for a DvZ map, so you would have to think seriously about ways to provide cover for both the monster and dwarf sides."

A lot of people got bent out of shape about that stuff; why encourage it more?  DvZ ought to be tied to more fantastic, exotic locales, not ones in real life, and certainly not ones that give the bile-spewers in chat more reason to regurgitate tired old jokes that were only funny for about an hour."

DvZ,3da0vz,Konpaatre1,11,Tue Jul 14 17:44:23 2015 UTC,Please no. I had a game yesterday where the dwarves spent 10 minutes just slabbing and mortaring the entrance to the spiral staircase on Archives. Monsters Vs. Walls was not a fun game; Goblins don't need nerfing and reinforced stone doesn't need buffing.     In terms of final defences the old Shrine Box tactic isn't a beneficial one anymore. Having a lot of dwarves in a confined space is just bad for them and good for the monsters. If anything final shrines need to be larger if they are to last longer.
DvZ,3da0vz,Doom_BringerMC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"Slabbing off is something that should never happen in the 1st place, you cant balance fair game play for that one jimmy that is new to the game or eater trolling.  But don't you think it is strange that we play a game where dwarfs fight there last battle to defend the shrine but invite the enemy to fight at the shrine since its easier than seeing a wall melt?"
DvZ,3da0vz,Doom_BringerMC,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"In the example I provided it wasn't one Jimmy, it was two Heroes and half the Dwarven team, they wouldn't of been able to have maintained it for as long as they did if it was just one Jimmy.     How the game plays is dependent on the map, and the people playing it. Maps have much greater influence over the progression of the game, if the lead up to a shrine, and the shrine itself is difficult to defend then it almost always falls with gold in it. Building defences to aid in the sustainability of that shrine can extend the life of it. But the change from Creepers to Goblins made it so maintaining those defences is more about anticipation rather than responding. If you build defences they can last ages as long as there are players devoting their time to keep them there. If a Goblin gets off all 8 bombs and a Kaboom then that wall is pretty much gone. If someone breaks those bombs and interrupts the Kaboom then the Goblin can't do anything to them."
DvZ,3da0vz,Overhighlord,2,Tue Jul 14 18:41:30 2015 UTC,Yeah not many people seem to know that you can disarm bombs and even less people use mortar. Grey mortar is alot more important  now that less dwarves have blue mortar.

DvZ,3da0vz,Nat3wall,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"Idea for test games, leader boards."
DvZ,3da0vz,Juliandroid98,4,Wed Jul 15 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"Please no, the leaderboards did more harm than good to the game.  First and foremost, it promoted killfarming, this was never that big of a deal until slabs got accessible to everyone. People can and will go out of their way to farm kills, even at the expense of others.  Second, elitism. People being rude to others because they 'earned' their title by killfarming. Constant complaining about people stealing their procs.  Third, DvZ was never meant to be a competitive game, I'm not even sure what Robs idea was behind leaderboards. But it turned DvZ into the competitive game that I just simply didn't enjoy during PMC era. I like DvZ as a roleplaying game and it has to stay that way, leaderboards just eliminates the bit of roleplay that we have now."
DvZ,3da0vz,Nat3wall,2,Wed Jul 15 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"I went on the other day with the new update and I still saw some people building kill farms though were less I agree some people did that, I always looked at it as, if you had to do that you weren't skillful enough.   Yes, people were rude, even some elitism, but some that weren't even on the leaderboards were just as rude. The ""Titles"" just got more flame about it because people remembered their name easier. Yes they were wrong in doing so but that's just the way the internet is you get trolls.  Did Rob himself say that? This is my opinion, that more players would play if there was more motive then just roleplay. That is my opinion."
DvZ,3da0vz,Juliandroid98,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, killfarming still happens, but WAY less than when leaderboards were a thing.  And for the last thing, yes, Rob said that he wants DvZ as a pure roleplay game, hence why he made the update Jimmy friendly. He wanted newer jimmies to experience them being a strong dwarf.  As for 'another motive to play' it's either RP or killfarm. People who killfarm most likely have little to no interest in Roleplay. And I'll repeat it again, they can and will go out of their way to farm kills for the leaderboards, even at the expense of others."
DvZ,3da0vz,Nat3wall,3,Wed Jul 15 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"I think you are giving to much credit to killfarming, from my memory not that many people did that but I may have forgotten."
DvZ,3da0vz,Doom_BringerMC,0,Wed Jul 15 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"PMC DvZ was one of the worst iterations of DvZ for me because of the introduction of AI's with leaderboards. It took away so much from the game that it just wasn't an enjoyable experience. Pretty much every game there was someone building an AI trap, and then there was someone else destroying it to try to prevent the kill farming. The chat was then just people bickering over it and getting mad at each other for it. DvZ isn't about getting lots of kills. If that's what you're into then sure, play for the kills. But Leaderboards forced that on everyone in the game inadvertently. Even if you didn't care for it, people that did had a big impact on the game and were just detracting from other players experiences. I spent most of PMC DvZ with chat off because I was tired of all the arguing, I didn't even play for the last two months it was on PMC because I'd had enough of it."
DvZ,3da0vz,MillicentOak,3,Thu Jul 16 00:39:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure when you started playing, but there were only AIs for half of the time that DvZ was on PMC. That said, I agree with what you say about the way a lot of people behaved with regards to ""their"" AIs and people ""stealing"" kills - the boards were a big problem. Even before AIs, there were plenty of games where the shrine would fall because people were out at the front farming kills (especially on Oasis and Mt. Willakers).

I had chat off most of the time because I used it as a relaxing game, sit back and shoot some skeles, zombies, creeps. I also had it off for the RP couldn't stand it, I understood why they did it but I saw once they had built a boat and were protecting the boat instead of the shrine or seeing how far they can use the insta wall (Forgot what they are called). I never felt like it forced people to get kills I'm sorry it felt that way for you. I just enoyed see how good I was compared to others."
DvZ,3da0vz,Tomlough,2,Thu Jul 16 01:00:59 2015 UTC,"I just enoyed see how good I was compared to others.   This is really the important point and ultimate reason why the boards were removed - DvZ isn't a game people should really be considered 'good' at. More experienced perhaps, but it's not a game that was designed for people to excel or compete at.  Because for a very long time it was left in a state where you could measure yourself against other players people became attached to that competition, but the server actively discourages that mindset now as it isn't how they want the game to be played."
DvZ,3da0vz,Nat3wall,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:11:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the very point of the game is to see how long you can last before you die while having fun.

DvZ,3da0vz,Overhighlord,3,Wed Jul 15 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"It promoted extremely long games with people farming kills instead of playing the game how it's meant to be played, dvz isn't a competitive game and at those times monster was incredibly boring and u progressive. (Although it still happens) Alot of people hero hunted as it was much easier to get more kills as a hero making those games even longer. These are but a couple of reasons why it was removed."
DvZ,3da0vz,Nat3wall,3,Wed Jul 15 19:43:48 2015 UTC,"Those are valid points, I can't contradict them I can however offer some opinions why it should be brought back. Having a title used to be special you earned it, yes there were some that farmed games and kills but they were far and few between. I always felt that the top 20 in each board earned there spot, now you can buy your spot and feel ""special"" without ever doing anything."
DvZ,3da0vz,Tomlough,3,Wed Jul 15 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"I always felt that the top 20 in each board earned there spot, now you can buy your spot and feel ""special"" without ever doing anything.   Without ever doing anything, except for paying to keep the server running?  If the removal of leaderboards removed your only incentive to play the game, then that's just how it is I guess. But you can still view your own statistics which means you can give yourself personal goals. If your only reason to play DvZ in the past was to show off your kill count to other players, maybe the game doesn't matter. There are plenty of servers out there which do have leaderboards and in a far more sensible setting than DvZ."
DvZ,3da0vz,Nat3wall,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:25 2015 UTC,Im sure more then half of the people paying for the server are doing for the title not to pay for the server.
DvZ,3da0vz,Tomlough,4,Wed Jul 15 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yet they still fund the server. If it's true that half of the patrons only pay to get the title, then that's a great reason to make titles patron-only! If they weren't, the server wouldn't have as much money!  Most people who had titles when the leaderboards existed did not get them by accident, so I don't quite understand the scornful tone here."
DvZ,3da0vz,Nat3wall,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:54:32 2015 UTC,"I believe they would still get the same amount of people paying to get titles if they had the leaderboards, I only started paying for the server when I got on the leaderboards so I could see my title.  I know they earned their way onto the boards. I didn't mean to have a scornful tone. I don't know where you got that I was giving one."
DvZ,3da0vz,Tomlough,4,Wed Jul 15 22:05:29 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that you say half the people who buy Super Jimmy do it only for the title, but the same is true of people who farmed kills to get a title. The gravedigger board was basically entirely for people who wanted a title. Anyone who was desperate to have a title could get one, provided they could devote enough time to playing the game and were willing to concentrate on their statistics at the expense of other aspects of DvZ gameplay.  If your view is that someone who farmed kills in DvZ purely for the leaderboards earned their title more than someone who donated money, I disagree but won't bother trying to change your mind. Titles mean something different now, leaderboards are gone, and this conversation won't change that."

DvZ,3da0vz,ScottishViking,3,Wed Jul 15 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like the reason people aren't making defences inside is a lot more complex than just the damage that goblins are doing. It's a whole range of factors. This is more to do with proc halls and other variations of that, but it also sort of applies to any final shrine defences as they are similar.   One of the most influential is with the new armour shred update which means that you've either got to have a million wrenches and durable armour, or you have to stay really close to the shrine to get repaired because of the speed that your armour can go from full to nothing. Defences can work against you here because if you have a mazy hall then it would take a long time to get back to the shrine with mobs on your tail. If you have everything open it would allow other dwarves to easily shoot any mobs while you retreat.   The whole bows now working 100% indoors is another reason. Now you don't have to rely on proccing everything to get rid of the mobs and so if you have a proc tunnel it is much harder to shoot things due to all the turns.  It's makes more sense to open things up to bow spam them, or at least attempt to and hit all the AIs surrounding them.  The new monsters make it even more difficult to hold a hall considering how some of them cannot be procced. It is impossible to hold any sort of defence with ogres, pirates, ogremagis and golems (but because there are only two they aren't really an issue). These monsters will get a free pass to the shrine which means all remaining dwarves will have to be there doing their best to run around hoping Bruce kills the monsters while they repair each other.   The new weapons change the behaviour of dwarves and in some cases they make dwarves completely useless indoors, especially when in proc halls or other defences. For example trying to roll a proc with the intention of clearing a hall or shrine is made harder when a dwarf nearby has a warhammer. The dagger is good at killing things but has a great delay which is not helpful at all for proc halls or in a busy final shrine which needs cleared right away. The axe has great initial impact but completely stops due to it not rolling. It does have the advantage of being able to start one at will (when the cooldown has run out) which is the negative of the greater runeblade due to how hard it is to get a proc on  towards the end of the game now. The normal runeblade is basically useless inside, although hardly anyone uses it.  A small, indirect factor that could be nonsense is to do with how difficult it is to make defences now. Due to the class system less people carry slabs, which sped up the process tremendously in the previous update. That alongside the change that made it so you only get 2 cobble when digging gravel makes it extra slow. If you want to build defences you have to get a massive amount of cobble, which takes much longer than before. So by the time you have collected all the cobble you need, you can then start building. By the time you are finished the monsters have already been released meaning you have to have super mortar. However due to the class system, less people carry it. It's all these inconveniences that make the process a little more annoying, and to some, it might put them off. If you were really dedicated to building inside defences then you can make a proper class for it but it comes at the cost of being much weaker in combat, which the majority of players don't want."
DvZ,3da0vz,Alderdash,4,Wed Jul 15 19:52:38 2015 UTC,"That's actually an excellent summary of the differences in this version: it's not always just the big changes that make a difference, but small ones like the changes to cobble, and the lack of super mortar. I used to do a lot of building of defences, but since the update I've not found anything really practical I can do in the time I have to do it. From 15 super mortar, and 10 blue slabs before the update, I now have nothing - no money currently to get them, and not enough points to add them in anyway..."
DvZ,3da0vz,Cindella_D,3,Wed Jul 15 01:56:38 2015 UTC,"All of this, plus the fact that your inventory is smaller now with the glass."
DvZ,3da0vz,magicaldesks,2,Wed Jul 15 10:06:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is the grey mortar just doesn't cut it. After the build phase a goblin just need like 5 bombs and the wall is on another dimension. In pmc you needed an upgrade on the creeper to break the blue walls. It was either break blue walls or a lot of damage. Ofc most people want the damage so not many creepers bought the blue wall breaker. This makes it so that walls last much longer, especially at the beginning since people like to go zombie since it's the hardest to max out. So this makes it easier to defend walls since there are not many creepers that break them and they are more worth it to defend since you can proc without worrying about flying bombs coming at you and producing a tunnel is very fun.  Basically no one uses mortar and now every little explosion breaks walls so even if it's slower to break walls if no dwarves defend it it's going to fall very quickly."
DvZ,3da0vz,TheDrCreeps,2,Wed Jul 15 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"it's just that with the ways destruction has changed, the proc halls are not as effective as the creeper days. hell, when the blue brick and destruction creepers were introduced, proc halls fell faster than gobos.    the dwarves just need new ways to build against these new mobs sieging the keep in a different way. there is no need for another layer."

Same as how not all maps are conductive to making defenses in this iteration of DvZ. For example The Machine map. Beyond the first wall theres very little chance for any real defences to be built. At most on this map its a case of block up holes and see just how many dwarves you can get to hold each shrine. At best Final shrine it is still possible to make proc halls however only with multiple people working on them so it's literaly the entire corridors filled up with just one proc hall.  The best map for defenses now in my opinion  is Mt-Willikars Second shrine. Madness right? Not really, but only with multiple dwarves. Just before the second shrine a player made wall needs to be made with updates done to the pre-existing wall to make it useable and strong enough if there are dwarves still able to defend it.  Really in this iteration the best I've found is just mass thickness, don't stop making thicker. Its the only way to really hold once past first. Most inner maps sadly due to not being made with this iteration of DvZ in mind, aren't very good for making defenses but instead more conductive to pre-Goblin DvZ.  Honestly its a case of current maps not being built with this version of DvZ in mind and there not being a co-ordinated building crew amongst dwarves. With just two co-ordinated people working on defenses again, things have a chance. However just the normal lets all clobber together defenses have less chance of working since its a lot harder to try and build round and integrate the mess into a proper defense anymore."

D:  As for others saying to work on new maps instead of remakes: While there's upsides and downsides to remaking an old map, don't let the downsides automatically stop you from trying to remake a map if you really want to. As far as I'm concerned if you're willing to put the time and effort in making a map, remake or not, then its worth showing off!"
DvZ,3d5t96,winter477,12,Mon Jul 13 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"This is one of the more frequent suggestions on this subreddit and the result each time is a general ""no"". There's a secondary rotation (albeit currently only with one map) for old maps which are known to work in the current version, and if you want old mechanics I think Plains is the closest you're gonna get.  The impression I get is that while we often talk about DvZ as having distinct versions, it shouldn't be considered as such but rather as each update being a refinement of the game. So in asking for 'retro' DvZ, you're asking Rob/Nisovin to host the game in a state they don't consider to be finished or refined, or even good (for what it's worth, I wholeheartedly disagree with that sentiment but understand the perspective it's written from). Given that there have been so many incarnations and revisions of the game, choosing which one to host would be a nightmare in itself and just end up annoying people because in the vast majority of cases you wouldn't be picking their favourite 'version' of the game."
DvZ,3d5t96,Tomlough,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:38:51 2015 UTC,choosing which one to host would be a nightmare in itself   Not to mention that these old versions don't just magically appear out nowhere; I'd say it's pretty unlikely Rob still has the files saved for versions of the game as old as the gym.
DvZ,3d5t96,Splax77,3,Mon Jul 13 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"Which one?  There have been so many very distinct iterations of DvZ over the years. Are we talking dragon warrior DvZ, with clocks, and potionmakers having to wander out and find water? Or the craftertown version, with quartz workshops and netherbrick blacksmiths? Or the version where placing down stone put your equipment in your inventory, and there were 3 premade shrines on an otherwise randomly generated map? How about the version with the huge prebuilt shrine with a staircase in the middle? Or do we want to play DvZ as it was when it was first put on the gym, still mostly designed for streams and full of balance problems?  Do we want proc to still be a thing? What about heroes? Should we still have old monsters, like the squids, or blaze cannons, or (god forbid) chicken bombers?  Sure, we could go through these questions and more and figure out answers, but getting a consensus from the entire community about all of these issues would be a ridiculously complicated endeavour. Then Rob and Nis have to deal with compatibility issues - and even if everything works properly, there's still the time it would take to put it together - time Rob and Nis would rather be spending on other, more popular, and more current projects.  Don't get me wrong, I do miss a lot of stuff from old DvZ; the enderman portals (when they actually worked), the original wolves, the different dragons, the BLAAAAZE CANNONS! I think a lot of great stuff has been lost over the years. But trying to grab our memories and bring it back is utterly futile - especially when this latest update has been more packed with content than any previous version!  But I'm getting off point. The way I see it, Rob is already doing a huge service to his older fans by keeping DvZ alive at all. Asking more of him at this point - especially something as huge as making the older versions functional and accessible - is less than he deserves."
DvZ,3d5t96,Sarkavonsy,4,Tue Jul 14 01:08:21 2015 UTC,There are small servers all about the web that host older versions of the game already.

DvZ,3d5t96,Aragoth_,3,Mon Jul 13 21:57:52 2015 UTC,As a long time player I wouldn't like to have an older version of the game.  I get that having the ability to play on an older version of the game may be fun along with the older maps but DvZ is moving forward. Like what Silver said there a various versions of DvZ on other servers that may be of your liking.  Having a separate version of DvZ with the current DvZ is just unnecessary to have on the server.

DvZ,3d36gj,AvaThePanda,8,Mon Jul 13 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"Ah. Someone else who had that same problem. Bruce's ale does a lot of unnecessary healing. Jimmy juice heals when players are at 75% health. For Jimmy that's at 15 hearts. For bruce that's at more than 20. Nothing in the game can burst him down from more health than a normal Jimmy has that fast. I feel that the juice should be auto healing him much later in his health bar. At 50%. 15 hearts. Same as Jimmy. Early game the healing doesn't effect him at all, but late in the game it forces a lot of unnecessary double heals at 200 mana a pop. Bruce runs out of mana significantly faster because of this. This and fury being incredibly overpowered has caused games to end with 1500+ gold in a shrine because light levels don't effect mana drain and bruce is nursing himself while his ale drains all of his mana faster than he can regen and hope to survive."
DvZ,3d36gj,PickShark,6,Mon Jul 13 12:55:03 2015 UTC,"I plan on changing for heroes is making them immune to mana drain effects, but I disagree. If you're having problems with mana, that's because there is less dwarves alive. The longer the game goes, the harder it becomes to be a beast on bruce as your heal costs go up and up.  Right now heroes are very vulnerable to mana steal from zombies and wolves, but I plan on removing this."
DvZ,3d36gj,Rurikar,2,Tue Jul 14 01:06:15 2015 UTC,I've found that even in heavy combat mana isn't a problem until you get low on armor. Focus on repairing your armor more often and you should be good.

DvZ,3d36gj,Doom_BringerMC,2,Mon Jul 13 15:00:33 2015 UTC,"Bruce is designed so that basically newbs can be a beast all the time. Easy procs that are easy to roll. But the problem is for expert players, this would make the game end with all three heroes still alive. Look at the other two heroes, they are almost ALWAYS alive when the final shrine falls. We had games where there is still 1000 gold and just three heroes fighting at the shrine, that's not good for the game as players knew heroes were basically unkillable and were completely ignoring them already.  All the heroes will have the same healing abilities where at the start of the game they are basically completely unkillable, but by the end of the game they will have mana troubles and die just like any other dwarf. This makes it so early game, any player can be a beast on a bruce and the later a game goes, the more and more likely he can die.  With the current changes to bruce I went in a test game and did nothing but kill farm. The game ended we me having over 1500 kills on bruce in a 4k kill game. The changes on him so far are fine, your just comparing his survivability to the other heroes that essentially have unlimited mana.   This is what Rob said in regards to Bruce."

DvZ,3cyte4,Bruces_Jimmy,3,Sun Jul 12 00:40:33 2015 UTC,"Your map needs a lot of work before it can even be considered as a functioning DvZ map.   The layout makes almost no sense. I understand it's a WIP but the placement of the first shrine and the quarry is very confusing. The bedrocking of everything is atrocious. You have numerous void holes, in the quarry and under mountains. The path to the quarry is not bedrocked at all, and the placement of your cake shrine underneath the path means that griefers can easily stop dwarves from accessing the quarry. You also have a large bedrock hole leading to the superflat world underneath in the field between mobspawn and the first shrine. Some of the sections of the map are very odd. You have a weird water thing after what I assume is the first shrine, and is some flowing water with some packed ice in it. Your obsidian section (a portal?) is unpolished. Your mobspawn is a massive tube that opens up to the wrong side of the map. The front wall is very small and thin. The oil is hidden among some trees that are inexplicably inside a fence, in a way that makes it seem like an afterthought. It's very easy to get onto the superflat world.   This is a very brief list of what I saw on the map after a few minutes, and again, it needs a lot of work."

DvZ,3cyte4,Overhighlord,3,Sun Jul 12 09:09:58 2015 UTC,"It's not just about learning to take criticism that it is important, but also learning how to deliver it constructively. If you ever enter into a design or teaching field, you learn how to examine other people's work and give useful and positive criticism in a learning environment. Giving good criticism also forces you to articulate particular reasons why something could be different, rather than just say ""I don't like it!"" ""It doesn't pop!""  You should never, ever, be insulting to the person in a critique.    Good constructive comments should have 3 parts:   A positive remark about what you do like about the work. If you can't do this, then do not proceed to step 2. The critique, things that need improvement and how they can be done. Reiterate the positives and how your suggestions from part 2 can strengthen what you liked.      If you were to do this, then the comment above might look something like this:  ""Hey Jimmy! Nice to see you are working on a map, finally! I like the ice theme you are doing, the colors and textures you use work together really well and the ice spire shapes add something unique from what you see in other icy maps. While I was checking, I did find a lot of bedrock holes; have you seen SuperMason's guide about making sure the bedrocking is complete (linktobedrockpost)? It's a lot easier to deal with bedrock holes early before you get too far along on making the map. The cake shrine is really funny, but if you put it next to the quarry, you need to cover it in an impenetrable wall of bedrock so griefers can't stop the dwarves there. What if you tried putting it off to the side instead?   The paths between the shrines seems good, but you should look at where the mobspawn comes out onto the map, and the quarry placement will possibly confuse the dwarves if it is too hard to find. You need to have some kind of visual cues for dwarves to see when they run out of spawn that will lead them to where the quarry is.  The interiors are a good size, and with some more decorative details they will look a bit more polished and bring out the ice spire theme.  If the front walls were more massive, they would make for some better defenses for the dwarves, especially with all the gobos these days. I like the idea of putting the trees and the oil into a more formal garden or arboretum setting instead of a forest...what if the fence had some more substantial posts and you made the paths to the oil more decorative?  Overall, I think it's a good start, great to see you working on your own map finally!""   you get the idea."

DvZ,3cxalo,Sarah2376,7,Sat Jul 11 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"Originally LoM and DvZ were meant to be within the same Universe, with LoM predating DvZ, acting as a prologue of sorts. However now for RP flexibility and content creation reasons they are not, therefore never were, until retconed again.  UR, is again I believe while sharing similarities and the same general premise, is a different universe because of the above reasons.   Putting them all in together means that it creates limitations on what can be done RP and lore wise during content creation, something fans love to pick apart.  Each DvZ game is at least in the old days an entirely separate, universe, dimension, curseverse. Or however you want to call it. Bruce willikars being generally the only singular point on a lore perspective of either moving between universes/dimensions/timelines to try and save the dwarven race again or being made to relive it through a really cruel curse of immortality.  In general though with content creation, and series's especially ones which mix RP, games and timelines,think of them as always fluid and seperate works which may share similarities to the extreme, even the same universe but not the same in specific to that series lore. If the content creator says something in the future that contradicts the past, then one or the other is false or perhaps both are true in their own way. Think of it as a case of theres only so much continuity that can be done before eventually trying to make everything work within the continuity takes more work that making the content.  Or in even simply terms, everything is only exactly as Rob currently says, and all past lore is not neccesarily true now. Much like say comic books and their different ages, eras, series and writers. Sure its all the same person and same universe butttt its not the same person and same universe and what happened before is not what happened now."

DvZ,3cw5sk,winter477,2,Tue Jul 14 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it'll be to much like regular old PvP. DvZ isn't exactly a PvP game, and honestly giving dwarf equip to mobs might be way OP simply since mobs are meant to be UP while dwarves OP.  Add in how if the right few people get it, they can just solo other dwarves it'll be a nightmare for keeping balanced.  All in all, DvZ isn't really PvP, making it PvP breaks DvZ since the Z is not as strong, big and hard as the D."
DvZ,3cw5sk,IllyiaSvara,3,Sat Jul 11 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"strong, big and hard as the D   But in all seriousness the mob event is certainly meant to be a challenge with some of the monsters as strong/stronger then dwarves, like the current fully upgraded zombie is way stronger then a lone dwarf at night and this all goes into the idea of the OP, plentiful dwarves getting slowly widdled down whilst the monsters grow as strong/stronger then the dwarves."
DvZ,3cw5sk,Overhighlord,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"A fully upgraded Zombie however (barring mass early deaths) won't occur even with plague till about the third day/night. Zombie is the most expensive mob to get to its end point I believe, then its impact skelly, then the other skellies then goblins.  Most random mob events however are actually easily dealt with if you know how to deal with the monsters, even golems. It is still possible to solo a golem, however now you have to focus on emptying your bow(unless ranger bow) into the golem and staying out of its melee range rather than the older method of solo melee charge move around in a circle, break its armour and kill it quickly.  Random mob events shouldn't be so punishing that regular dwarves well have difficulty, they should push dwarves or if hard have a specific way in which they can be killed that all dwarves can attempt. This is just normal PvP, which in MC in reality often comes down to who has better ping and a better mouse for clicking faster. Cheap mouses actually don't register as many clicks as full on gaming mouses. MC PvP is sadly limited due to how there is little variation and just a case of have diamond enchanted exactly as this, have these potion buffs and then who clicks the most and better connection. Why DvZ is different in its PvP aspect in my mind is that its a case of doesn't rely on that but instead the different abilities and skills of the monsters against the all round mini bosses that are dwarves.  Its also why I feel ogres just need their arrow resist tuned down to about 60/70% rather than 95% simply since if theres a no hero game and no elven blades/they all plagued dealing with ogres is hard due for most dwarf types.  Everything else about an ogre is perfect just the arrow resist is a tad to high in my mind. They are just a bit to unbeatable by any dwarf without the correct weapon for a random mob spawn rather than special event.   To clarify what a special event and random mob spawn are to me: Special event: Mob team wide event, Bopen and such Random Mob spawn: ogre, golem, etc etc Variable random amount of them at a random point."
DvZ,3cw5sk,IllyiaSvara,2,Sun Jul 12 13:25:55 2015 UTC,"The idea of dwarves dying and returning as zombies with their dwarven gear is pretty cool. I think mechanically it could be made to work by inserting some limitations and abilities:   the risen undead should start with 4/5 bars of armor, which can not be repaired in any way (so an undead will only last as long as his armor, which is already close to the danger zone) their arrows should either be capped at a low number with a long regen time, or start at 10/15 without regen (mostly to avoid crossbow and longbow becoming too powerful) they should not be able to attack monsters, and living dwarves should be made unproccable/undaggerable (so undeads can't one-hit kill dwarves, or help dwarves by proccing/poisoning monsters) they should probably only have armor, weapons and tools, no other items, with maybe an exception for a small amount of cobble (to avoid torch farms, excessive blocking off, or undead helping dwarves by building defenses) healing wouldn't need to be changed, because the armor limitation means it won't take a huge amount of hits and shots shots before the undead starts losing mana that he can not recover   However, thematically it feels weird to have the risen undead dwarf be a special monster event. It would make more sense to give every fallen dwarf the opportunity (not the obligation!) to rise as an undead at the location of death. You can only rise once, and that opportunity will only be given at your first turn as a monster. This might seem OP, but considering that dwarven weapons don't do armor damage above the base 0,5%, undead dwarves are not as threatening as they might seem."

It would get confusing 3. I would not add some special new weapon instead maybe like a rusty rune blade or something to even out the odds being there has never been a monster with a melee and a range. 4. if you are talking 1 or maybe 2 dwarves with the same amount of health as the regular dwarf people could easily gang up on them and kill them like zombies. Try something like ""Monsters enhanced Armor"" which gives them more hearts to make them more of a pain. 5. Limited arrows would be good if you are talking a regular dwarven bow I could see many players being UnDwarves just sniping if not try instead of 20 arrows you could do 10 like crossbow.

DvZ,3cwdey,Input_Logic,2,Sat Jul 11 09:40:43 2015 UTC,"The bow is already in the game, it's the Longbow.     I think the sword would heal for less at final not more. It's a game of attrition, what the dwarves have is always shrinking, this would be the one item where the opposite is true.     I take it the Shield is a Potion item? From when it was tested in the early test games it was awful to use, it drained all your mana to heal you to full and the only benefit it had was KB Resist. With a cheaper cost or a greater heal it may be better but if it doesn't offer some kind of buff for using it then it will always be worse than the other potions."

Being denied access to the torches on the field behind it is really detrimental to the pace of upgrading.

I have further plans for this that include the jungle section.   I now understand why Rob hates this community sometimes. You guys take unfinished work and shit on it. Why?   This version is highly incomplete. This is but a tiny glimpse. Major changes are still to be added.
DvZ,3curw9,themanoftacos,7,Sun Jul 12 00:01:38 2015 UTC,"Read the whole comment. This is nowhere near completion.   I read the comment. It wasn't very hard to read considering the fact that you included very little information about the map aside from the screenshots. The screenshots you posted looked like a pretty polished part of this map.   I have further plans for this that include the jungle section.   First off, I didn't even mention the jungle section. However, the screenshots you posted include a couple of huge coniferous trees. Last time I checked, jungles don't have coniferous trees in them. Therefore, I assumed you had no plans to include a jungle section, which was a reasonable assumption in my opinion considering the fact that you only wrote one line after the screenshots that you posted.   You guys take unfinished work and shit on it. Why?   Dogekac is a map that is very near and dear to my heart, I have made many friends and had many good memories playing on that map. To take that map, and change it so drastically (of course, it is a work in progress), makes me defensive over the original. I don't feel that your version of the map (from the screenshots you posted) has much to do with dogekac, and trying to present as such is somewhat disappointing. I would also like to say that I most certainly wasn't shitting on the map, it looks like a perfectly good map but it's simply not the same as the original dogekac.   You're getting very defensive over a few comments that criticized an attempted remake of a very good map that many people cared about. You only posted three screenshots, and you really didn't say much else."
DvZ,3curw9,Tomlough,7,Sun Jul 12 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to judge something based on such early screenshots, but here's my concern. While this looks like it will turn out to be a perfectly good map, it doesn't resemble Dogekac in any meaningful way. Like, at all.  The reason the original map worked so well is that it was a perfect combination of many small things, in a way I don't think the mapmakers even fully predicted. A bridge over a ravine is not automatically a good feature, and wouldn't necessarily be terribly interesting if removed from the context of the rest of the map, but on Dogekac it had to be defended even though the monsters had multiple alternate routes at their disposal, which encouraged teamwork with dwarves having their own jobs (""I'll defend danger cave!""). This only worked because size and shape of the map meant that monsters realistically had four main routes to the front wall with at least one of them being clear at all times - there's a reason Dogekac was commonly cited as the map with the best experience for both monsters and dwarves.  Similarly, the jungle was very important as it gave monsters many options once they made it over to the other side. During the time of punch skeletons, the jungle was a huge part of the map's popularity because skeletons were able to sneak into the treetops and ping dwarves into the ravine. Replacing the jungle with unscalable cliffs removes a one of the main things that made the map what it was (which includes its visual identity).  I'm really not trying to shit on your abilities as a mapmaker here, I think those screenshots show the start of what will probably be a good map. But it's insincere at best to market it as Dogekac 2.0 when it's nothing like the original (still not forgetting these are early screenshots!). Even just with the changes needed to accommodate the larger map sizes being used nowadays, the somewhat-unique gameplay of the original map is hard enough to reproduce because it was the product of lots of small features adding up to a perfect whole.  Seriously, you should release the map when it's done but under a different name. Because really my issue here is mostly based in pedantry, I don't doubt your ability to make a good map but I do object to a misleading name. I still don't think ""2.0"" versions are warranted for any old maps; Mt Willy works because the original basically had no exterior, and the interior on the new version is an exact replica which was then slightly enlarged. On Dogekac, the exterior was exactly the reason people loved the map, so to create a new map with a different exterior and call it a 2.0 version is just... meh. Why not just make new maps?  As I say, I may be getting too wrapped up in a name, but it feels like if your pet rabbit died and your parents replaced it with a goldfish called Flopsy 2.0."
DvZ,3curw9,Th3A1ph4D0g,-1,Sun Jul 12 01:45:34 2015 UTC,"I first want to thank you for not being a complete ass over a couple incomplete screenshots.   monsters realistically had four main routes to the front wall with at least one of them being clear at all times - there's a reason Dogekac was commonly cited as the map with the best experience for both monsters and dwarves.

DvZ,3curw9,Tomlough,6,Fri Jul 10 23:40:59 2015 UTC,"Started typing a longer response but I'm too sleepy for it to make sense. Basically, my concern is that the charm of the original Dogekac was in the way it played, which was in many ways the product of several lucky coincidences. I don't think a recreation or sequel would adequately emulate that, so beyond pandering to some nostalgic redditors there would be no point in remaking Doge for new DvZ. With the changes required to modernise it, it wouldn't be Dogekac 2.0, it'd be New Map 1.0... so why not just make an entirely new map? By all means a new map with a ravine and a bridge, or a jungle, or whatever, but then free of the burden of trying to stay true to one of the most popular DvZ maps ever.  If a new map gets posted which bears similarities to an old map I loved, I can easily get hyped about it (e.g. I found Grapevine Vale had many similarities to Erebor, whether intended or not). I would generally rather see someone create something new than to rebuild something from a different time with a nostalgic label on it.

DvZ,3cvrmx,figsandthings,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:38:59 2015 UTC,"As interesting as the idea sounds, I think it would have negative effects on gameplay. Not only are the ideas of instant procs that can be rolled or instant AoE procs pretty overpowered, but it would put more emphasis on skill into the game. Players who are good at switching would dominate the games while everyone who can't switch well might struggle to be of any use.  More than that though, given the point system in its current state (Which of course is subject to change in the future), I don't think having two swords or two bows is worth the 32-64 points it consumes (Not including the Elven Dagger, which is only 4 points). There's a lot of other useful goodies you can put in a loadout and while most of them aren't 16 points, the ones that are worth 16 points add up fast. Personally, I wouldn't want to limit my other options by having multiple melee/ranged items."
DvZ,3cvrmx,Morvereth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:03:05 2015 UTC,having 2 melee weapons would be too op. Like having cheap elven dagger as sidearm to runeblade or warhammer. So that you can poison targets that you cant kill.

DvZ,3cvke4,keaganwill,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:38:04 2015 UTC,Getting kills would not be a good way to do it  As a dwarf vets can easily get 500+ kills a game while newer players would be pretty much unaffected by it  While monster is mostly about draining gold kills still do happen and once again mostly by vets  No real reason to give a bonus to a group that hardly needs it
DvZ,3cvke4,Overhighlord,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, monster kills are really easy to get now at first and final, at first you hang around behind the shrine as a zombie(all you need is armor shred, all attack and all rebirth and the rest make it easier) when shrine gold runs out and you target retreating dwarves, some even already have broken armor! This tactic is incredibly dangerous for the dwarves but many still manage to get past, ancient Grove is probably the best place for this."
DvZ,3cvke4,figsandthings,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:29:02 2015 UTC,"The only way basing something like this off of kills would work without bringing a lot of negativity into the community would be to do total kills in a game rather than a player's individual kills. But even that will just bring people trying to artificially lengthen games. Having a goal for kills across all games within a certain period of time say, a week, might work out well. One two hour game might not necessarily have more kills than two hour long games, so trying to artificially lengthen the game wouldn't exactly be good at ""beating the system"" and it would have the added benefit of being a community quest that anyone participating in would get gold from.  Though honestly, I don't think kills would be the right thing to base quests off of. Really, I think anything that players would have direct influence over has a lot of potential to bring negativity into the community. It isn't really needed too much with the current bonus gold system."

DvZ,3cuqhg,Aragoth_,2,Sat Jul 11 03:21:09 2015 UTC,Well as someone who fell in a death pit about a week ago I'd say dig in the same general layer everyone else is digging. Digging the death pits may be funny to you but is a major nuisance that gets dwarves killed like what Tundra had mentioned.   It ruins the fun for the person who dies who had probably spent the entirety of the build phase making supplies for the night. This game is about fun and taking it away from someone for your own enjoyment is not okay at all.   Hope this will help you explain to the people who dig the death pits to not do.
DvZ,3cuqhg,figsandthings,3,Fri Jul 10 23:07:56 2015 UTC,Most people probably don't dig death pits strictly for enjoyment or specifically so people accidentally fall down them.  Some people probably just find it the easier way to get large amounts of cobble. And it doesn't help that a lot of people (myself included) tend to just risk jumping right into the quarry to begin with.

DvZ,3cuqhg,Sarkavonsy,3,Sat Jul 11 00:18:40 2015 UTC,"Nothing like co-opting pseudodarwinist jargon to justify people screwing over their fellow dwarves.  For real though, the idea that a dwarf's survival before plague should be decided by natural selection of all things is laughable at best. Watching out for deathpits isn't an intended feature of DvZ, it's an undesirable emergent feature caused by careless dwarves in the quarry."
DvZ,3cuqhg,figsandthings,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:28:57 2015 UTC,"The people falling into the pits are arguably just as careless. Being aware of the fact that there just might be death pits in the quarry isn't exactly difficult.

It definitely sucks that it happens, but with something like this, its probably just be easier to keep a watchful eye to prevent yourself from falling down one. There's nothing stopping people from being ""Hey, try not to make death pits. People could fall down them and die"" but at the end of the day its a less important message for something that's generally pretty easy to avoid yourself.  My only suggestion would be to map makers for them to possibly take death pits into consideration when building their maps. Instead of super deep quarries, make them shallow but more spread out. Its obviously not a requirement, but it would certainly help!"

People always forget player zombies. With arrow resistance, rebirth and leap, I'd guess I could get up to that wall in two, maybe three lives. Then start breaking the wall and jimmy will have to focus on me, giving gobo's and skellies the time to get in position. If I can actually get through, I'll have a field day on the armor. An ogre would have more trouble with breaking the wall than a zombie, but would also be an even bigger distraction to deal with.  It could probably hold out for a little while, but I don't think it will be as effective as you are suggesting. It might even trap fellow dwarves on the wrong side, because you are essentially walling off. The only way to know for sure though, is to try it out."
DvZ,3crfuw,Lex_L,3,Fri Jul 10 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"This strategy has been very effective in the past; on maps such as Oasis and especially Molgan, these archer bunkers were commonplace to securely hold chokepoints. While rangers are even more powerful now than they were back on the Gym, I don't think bunkers are a useful anti-monster measure anymore. Here's why:   Skeletons can do the same to you, and given the tight quarters in a bunker, there's really no way to dodge arrows. Getting constantly pelted by arrows from skeletons can and will annihilate your armor very quickly, especially when AI will be spawning all over the place to block your own shots and serve as a meat shield for the skeletons.  Archers will have very little time to react to goblins placing boomboxes to destroy the bunker, and can hardly do anything about thrown boomboxes shredding armor.  Zombies, wolverines, impact skeletons, and golems are all very capable of simply busting down your bunker's walls and making you incredibly vulnerable.  A key factor in building effective bunkers back on the Gym was that most dwarves had to be involved in the ranger fun, with only a few competent swordsmen needed outside (back then, armor repair was nowhere near as much of a concern). In today's games, you will never be able to make enough dwarves complicit by a) getting them to adopt the required loadout items, and b) staying in the bunker. Most players will choose not to do this, stay outside the bunker, be effectively walled off, die when they cannot retreat to repair, and blame you for killing them indirectly. Ogres can just walk up to you, block all shots meant for other targets, and start bashing you around to disrupt your efforts. Arrow spam is no longer possible due to the quiver limits. This is a huge deal when Gym bunkers relied on hailstorms of arrows to drive back monsters entirely. You do not have this luxury anymore, making it almost impossible to create sustained arrow fire without massive (read: unrealistic) amounts of coordination. DvZ does not have the tools necessary for that sort of cooperation; previously, you didn't really have to worry due to the sheer number of arrows, but now you essentially need to create firing lines. This is objectively impossible in a normal, standard game. Jimmy is an enormous problem. When Jimmy sees a structure like this, he is often tempted to ""improve"" it by adding on. This can lead to things like tiered bunkers, or staircases to upper platforms, or what have you. The astute monster will use those to their advantage to infiltrate the bunker and cause havoc inside. Finally, it's simply more optimal to have freedom of movement inside the keep, now that procs are more easily obtainable and more important to survival, in that killing player zombies and skeletons as quickly as possible lessens armor damage and keeps your squad alive longer."
DvZ,3crfuw,ArchasTL,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:14 2015 UTC,"You're right about a lot of this, but I was thinking of this being a more indoor thing inside a hallways or something. But I guess it is pretty flawed. I'm just trying to think of a new strategy to defend hallways"
DvZ,3crfuw,ArchasTL,3,Fri Jul 10 05:58:54 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the Gym-era bunkers I'm referring to were all inside. Molgan in particular had a section of the keep's entrance where a wooden bridge led directly to the shrine, but breaking it opened up a lava furnace below that monsters would have to slog through, and a long flight of stairs separated them from the shrine. By far the most common scenario on that map was to break the wooden bridge and set up bunkers at the shrine side of the bridge and at the entrance to the lava furnace. Mobs physically could not bypass the shrine bunker because the gap was too large to jump over, and constant arrow fire kept them back, leaving them a single alternative in braving the lava furnace and hoping they got through before being shot to pieces.  Usually, they were shot to pieces.  That is a very specialized map for bunkers, obviously, and the same map features would certainly not apply in the current version of DvZ. However, while the map was very favorable toward bunkers, so too were the game mechanics at the time, and today's monsters simply cannot be effectively held off by an archer bunker, no matter where it's located.  As a dedicated monster player (I never play dwarf, at all), I can tell you that the single most useful thing you can do to defend hallways is to keep them open, free of obstruction, and have a small funnel at the end of the hall to make it a little more difficult for monsters to run by and get to the shrine. This gives monsters more maneuverability, yes, but it does the same for dwarves too, and that's incredibly meaningful when you have a proc. Several dwarves in an open hallway, dwarves who are consistently checking armor and health levels and preventing any one of them from being forced away from the others and killed, will hold the hallway for far longer than a proc hall or bunker will nowadays."
DvZ,3crfuw,Sarah2376,0,Fri Jul 10 06:24:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know very well the Jimmies think that the tower and platforms ou were making need to be connected to a staircase below and a network of small trees.  On the other hand, (something I will show in my BYOK guide I am making soon, outdoor bunkers are great, if you have them sunk into the ground a meter (or two) you'll have slightly limited view, but A: Ogres can't hit you off, and you can easily trap ogres with you and take them down. B: If you put it in in the right spot, gobos ignore it and/or can't reach them."

The Challenge   In that >hour video, he was proving that if people REALLY like where this game is going, and want to support, they'd be willing to watch the entire video and buy super jimmy. I was one of those people. I doubt many people are willing to watch a five minute video and then spend $15 on super jimmy, but wouldn't be willing to with the video Rob put out. I'm fairly certain that Rob will eventually make a video advertising DvZ again, and not in an hour long fashion.   The Player base   This I agree with. I understand where Rob is cumming from, but DvZ had 2,000 players last summer for a reason... It was advertised. I can agree with Rob that it isn't worth his time to make videos on something not worth his time, but he needs to make at least one video advertising DvZ to his viewers. I can completely agree to the fact that, if I didn't buy super jimmy during that beta phase, I would have absolutely NO idea that the game is now in an open phase.

More players means me and Nisovin have to bump our costs, bulk up our support/mod team, spend more and more time holding players and dealing with player related issues then making a game. I said when I quit PMC I don't plan on developing for Minecraft anymore, it's a dead end. I have put a lot of time into polishing DvZ for it's glory years and I have already done the pitch to my viewers to see if the size I'm at is right for the audience I have. This isn't the same as when we had PMC and half a dozen games that all need 50 people to function, DvZ is fine as long as it has a good 100 players on the server. Right now we got 150 people on LoM and 250 on DvZ so it's super weird when anyone tells me ""They are dead"".  I already have plans on doing DvZ videos, but it's super annoying when people tell me I have too/should because that's so wrong. If anything, I could make the environment of DvZ how it is right now worse by doing videos. More players means more hackers/trolls/newbies which then need some time to settle down and be dealt with.

DvZ,3crkfm,Rurikar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I assumed that the server is set at a max of 350 because that's all it gets. example: If a small server hopes to get really big with over 10,000 players daily, but they just started out, they aren't going to pay for a 10,000 slot server, but maybe 20, or 50. once it gets bigger, then they expand respectively.  Thus I assumed the 350 max was due to the fact that 350 is plenty as off now, but in a year, maybe it will be bigger. That's my thought process anyways  edit: the reason some of us say a new video would be better is because the one you made it targeted at people who are willing to watch that long of a video, and some aren't.  Then again, I guess people who aren't willing to watch an hour long video probably aren't the ones playing a 45 minute game daily anyways. maybe I'm in the wrong, I guess you're right."

We have two boxes for DvZ, one that hosts the lobby and bungee and the other that hosts the games.    the reason some of us say a new video would be better is because the one you made it targeted at people who are willing to watch that long of a video, and some aren't.   I have no interest in to catering to people who aren't passionate about DvZ. It's one thing if we have thousands of dedicated fans, it's another if we have just a bunch of people who are checking it out and don't really care. I completely and utterly regret even issuing that challenge because you guys are now debating that the challenge wasn't fair? The video was a snapchat of what 20,000 people watching a DvZ talk video is like for Super Jimmy, I did it not to get thousands of players, but because I was worried we WOULD have to expand if we had so many Super Jimmies that I couldn't hold them all in the small place of 350 players.  What's amazing is that while a lot of you watched that video, you didn't listen. I talk about perspective and try to give it to you guys, but you have to have some reasonable assumptions, respect, and trust, that I might know a little more than you guys about some things. I'm not trying to offend here, I ran a server much larger than this and have done videos in the past to pull in players. If I stream DvZ, I could easily bring 1.5k to 2.5k players to the server that night, but I don't have room to keep them and the costs of holding that many people is irresponsible. I worked at PMC for months and while sure we had a peek of 2k people we also had months where we could drop as low as 300. I know how many people were interested in buying the VIP status at the time, how many played what games, how many people bought gold, what they spent it on. This isn't random shots in the dark anymore, this is me and nisovin playing this very safe and trying to build a very dedicated, not big community.  Ask yourself this question, would you rather have a million fans that give you 1 dollar, or ten thousand fans who give you 100 dollars?  I read a book a long, long time ago that changed some of my views on communities and in my eyes, its much better to have a smaller more dedicated community then a larger, uncontrollable one. So if your logic is I would have sold more Super Jimmies in a video that wasn't an hour of me passionately talking about my game, you're right, but I don't care to really always focus directly on the masses with projects."
DvZ,3crkfm,Rurikar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:09:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, I've experienced both large and small. Small is 99% of the time better. I guess it's just human nature to assume 1 million fans is better, and so with that logic I assumed the same thinking applied here with you. I gladly accept I was wrong, looking at this community is amazing, and I congratulate you for making this what it is."
DvZ,3crkfm,Boe6Eod7Nty,9,Fri Jul 10 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"I have ZERO interest in being famous. It's not fun. People think fame is fun because they like the idea of being popular, but it's a burden. Just look at how many people have their lives destroyed or hindered from fame, look at how many people who are famous have their depression only worsen from the pressure of fans/anti fans.  No fame is a byproduct of the things I do. It's a necessary evil and growth should be very much a slow process as I'm more likely to buckle from pressure and fame than anything else. I'm not happy with any of my current projects, I feel they have so much more room to grow still by me managing them better and investing more time in them, the last thing I want to do is bring even more attention to projects I still feel are in their infancy."

Coward points: Us vets will just have to help the ones who ask questions and try to be better at the game. More jimmies will ask these questions if we are understanding and not calling them noobs.  The Challenge: The point of this challenge was to see how many people would show up on short notice ect ect.  The Player Base: I can't speak for rob. You'll have to ask him about this one your self. But coward points are shown in your stats book if you have any.
DvZ,3crkfm,winter477,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:32:05 2015 UTC,If you want a kit with warrior minus the jimmy juice then just make a custom set (Thats the point of making you're own set to fit your play style)

DvZ,3crkfm,IllyiaSvara,3,Fri Jul 10 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"The whole point of a prebuilt class is that you get more stuff, but less control over what stuff you get. If we start getting into customizing prebuilts, then there would be no point in using a custom, as you could just substitute a single item into the class most closely matching your playstyle, and bypass the effort a custom class is meant to take, plus having all the prebuilt bonuses.  And no, it would not stop at substituting potions, if rob gave us that option it would lead to demands that swords and bows be interchangeable, too."

With the increased damage output especially come final/second shrine so many kills are gabbed by me and other goblins that just artillery throw then kaboom on a dwarf using drinkable juice rather than jimmy juice. If your going below half health and defending the shrine with say middling armour left over, your life might as well be forfeit if a Goblin hits you with a direct kaboom. Your not coming back without jimmy juice. Jimmy juice might not neccesairly be the most efficient it is however the most safe juice. Only downside is Large damage and fall damage doesn't get registered and you have to wait till another hit to get healed. Hopefully this is just a bug they are working on fixing. 2 Goblins together take down a jimmy juice player with kabooms where a non jimmy juice could survive. Despite this your more at risk of the single goblin taking you out when your trying to conserve mana."

DvZ,3cr5v6,Overhighlord,2,Fri Jul 10 10:18:26 2015 UTC,"That is intended, these are scarved dwarves after all, they are those without beards due to them being a separate race and all. This is the story of a race that was wiped out, completely.

DvZ,3cr5v6,Faiden6,2,Fri Jul 10 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"Though I know where you're coming from with the standard definition of dwarves, the artist shouldn't be limited to that exact style.  If the artists want to draw the dwarves a little different to help them convey the story of their characters, they should be able to do so. There have been many re-tellings of fantasy style characters that don't go with the main stream."

DvZ,3cr179,Esbjorn_97,4,Fri Jul 10 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"Proc Halls just aren't effective anymore with Goblins, the only way to keep a proc hall in-tact is if someone stands in front of the entrance preventing any and all explosions going off, but then they're subject to the entire Monster force and will have a very hard time getting back into the narrowed entrance. I think you're better off just trying new builds and seeing what works and what doesn't. Something that was quite effective on Belly of the Beast was not building a full on Proc hall but just narrowing the corridor slightly. Goblins are less inclined to destroy it because it isn't as cramped but the space is narrow enough to be effectively defended, and you can get in front of it without the worry of struggling to get back in."
DvZ,3cr179,Doom_BringerMC,2,Fri Jul 10 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"So far as I am concerned, there are a lot more variables to defense than simply proccing.  The availability of bows, warhammer AoE, on demand procs, and speed builds are not very friendly to the old proc hall.  Additionally, the monsters have strong counters that include goblins, but also skeleton armor shred (any straightaway is a shooting gallery), ogre knockback (ogres would COMPLETELY own an old hall), and the inevitable kill machine... the golem (which needs either Bruce/Niso or bows to take down).  So in short... I think the new meta has not been established... except that old proc halls may not work anymore."

DvZ,3cr179,wingsday1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:18:16 2015 UTC,"I like when proc halls are made, but I would probably only make them for the 1st to 2nd shrine path. For 2nd to final you usually don't have enough people left for that to work. I usually just slab from 2nd to final and that seems to work just as well. Plus you have to repair which can only happen near shrines. Proc shrines seem to be a bonus and not a need IMO."
DvZ,3cr179,Bob_higs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"Given the changes to Proc, the old halls really don't work anymore. You're better off with straight shots so Jimmies don't get cornered, and rangers can shoot straight down them."
DvZ,3cr179,shalluspalaces,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly you end up taking a hell lot of damage with halls, you can't fight player mobs in a hall anymore because you end up taking A LOT of armor damage, and even if you start a proc at the end of a hall and want to roll it you don't have enough room to dodge the explosions, also if you need to recover mana for a couple of seconds is a good idea to stay near the walls where there is not a hell lot going on (mostly constant explosions in the shrines) so inside defenses became obsolete, as it is right now big open spaces are really good to avoid armor damage.  Also with the new mechanics you can't get a lot of cobble really fast and also can't skip making torches/mortar with custom loadouts unless you want to sacrifice some other upgrades so you have a really limited amount of time to build during the building phase which contributes a lot to the lack of structures."
DvZ,3cr179,NikoUY,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"I got an idea for anti gobo defenses, make the start of the hall into a funnel, like this _/ the dwarves can break explosives and there's less of a place that monsters can escape. The dwarf is not required to turn their back to the monsters and can keep fighting while breaking the tnt."
DvZ,3cr179,johnnjlee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"I've been too busy getting to grips with the new mechanics to look into defences properly, but from my point of view there are a few things we need to look at:  1) Old school proc halls are not working with the new mob/dwarf mechanics. Even simple things like the huge amount of cobble that goes into them - with the changes to upgrades, a lot of people don't have the starting building supplies they used to, or the slabs they used to, digging gravel now only gives you two pieces of cobble, and our inventories have been reduced in size. When you take into account how much bigger keeps/corridors tend to be now, the old version is just not practical.  2) In addition, many more dwarves tend to survive to the 'indoor' section of the game than used to. This makes proccing in the confined space of an Original proc hall much more difficult - I've lost count of how often I get a proc, but can't run with it because there are just too many dwarves between me and another mob. Interior defences need to take this into account, and have a bit more space for people to spread out.  3) As other folk have mentioned, narrowing down the corridors from the edge (perhaps to a three or four wide tunnel rather than the current standard 7?) seems to be the most helpful strategy at the moment. With the changes to armour, the traditional proc hall bend - where people could retreat and repair safely - is less important, but I think could still be useful to prevent goblins throwing boxes straight down the hall, and skeletons standing at the beginning and shooting straight down. You wouldn't need such a complex pattern, perhaps one bend along each straight stretch, so people can dodge out the way and run safely to the next shrine."
DvZ,3cr179,Alderdash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:10:17 2015 UTC,"Those proc hall guides are so old, lol. My take on defenses inside is that the old fashioned version really doesn't work anymore, even the proc halls modified for the previous version of dvz don't help much. Ogres easily pin you into corners and with there still being AI monsters around you really don't need to pin players into corners to get a kill for a proc. Proc halls were pretty much made to help dwarves pin monsters (who were all players back then) into corners to prevent them running away with low health. With there being AI's they're easier to kill and, in most ways, predictable in their pathing. Also with so many different loadout options for dwarves and so many ways of killing monsters tight hallways really aren't needed. If hallways are in place then people just get in the way of everyone else plus for people who use a bow for the proc its almost impossible to get a kill. You could argue that having a 3 or 4 wide proc hall might work better for this meta of gameplay but with the likes of goblins its hard to maintain halls long enough for them to be useful. I think people need to find a balance with the space given to them - you need enough room so people can get a proc easily (using sword / bow) but the area can't be too large otherwise monsters (ogres, skeles, etc) will just knock you around making it hard to get a proc."
DvZ,3cr179,SAVINGN00BS,0,Fri Jul 17 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"narrowing the hall by a block on both sides is just a more effective strategy at this point. a lot of mobs give a ton of knockback now, and the new goblins are too destructive a force to maintain old proc halls.having a hall multiple blocks wide will allow rangers to make shots down the hall and leave plenty of room for multiple people proccing."

(At least for me) The proc is one of the most distinctive and iconic features of DvZ, and while it's cool to have the other melee weapons, warrior always draws me back because that is the playstyle DvZ was built on. Rob's given you options if you don't like it as a dwarf, and it gives mobs a reason to fear death, so learn to back off if you're in bad shape for the good of the team, which is what both sides of DvZ are all about."

DvZ,3cqxnm,Doom_BringerMC,6,Fri Jul 10 02:07:07 2015 UTC,"Procs have been a part of the game for a long time now and pre-date the addition of AIs. It's one of the most iconic experiences in DvZ; getting that kill and going on a rampage that lasts as long as you are able to make it. In terms of Dwarf gameplay versus Mob gameplay they are not meant to be equal or even similar experiences. Dwarves are intended to be heavily overpowered, it takes a lot to kill a Dwarf and a Dwarf has a range of means to kill you before you are able to damage them. But they are limited to one life, and one play style. Mobs have infinite lives and access to all the mob play styles. The only Monsters that are currently immune to Proc are Golems, Ogres and Pirates because it suites the play style of those mobs  (Goblin has a Proc immunity upgrade but I'm not sure if that works currently). The Proc at this point is almost intrinsic to the game, there are weapons that do not have it but they are designed deal with mobs in different ways hence creating different play styles. The monsters counter to the Proc is their infinite lives. A Dwarf can one-shot most mobs if they have a Proc, but those mobs can keep coming back. This is most important in Zombies which when fully upgraded are as powerful as a Dwarf at night time as they can mana steal, heal and cripple their armour. The only way a Dwarf can kill that Zombie is with a Proc. But the Zombie will keep coming back slowly wearing away at them. The mob gameplay is one of Attrition, you wear aware at their defences, their armour and their resources. You're not over-powering and killing Dwarves by the dozen because you aren't designed to, you're designed to slowly eat away at them until they die. If it's the persistent dying or being one-shot that you dislike about playing mob, then maybe a different mob would be more akin to the play style you desire? A skeleton is typically more out of the way, dealing damage from a far in which case your biggest enemy is arrows which are much easier to avoid then Procing Dwarves. A Goblin can be as tactical as you want it to be; you can be sneaky and try and take down walls without being noticed or go in loud and hard dealing as much damage in as short of time period as you can. The Zombie is more about patience, you wear down the armour and eventually the mana of an enemy player until they can no longer go on. You probably won't do this in one life, you may not even do it in five, but eventually you wear them down. The Dwarves strength is heavily stacked against the mobs, but the Monsters are relentless and unyielding with an infinite and ever-growing army. Playing as a mob, you know you are going to win because you can't loose, but its about wearing them down to a tipping point not over-powering them."
DvZ,3cqxnm,Lex_L,-1,Fri Jul 10 02:11:22 2015 UTC,I guess it just seems kinda boring spending so much time for a measly amount of damage. If the gobo anti-proc actually worked I think it would be a nearly acceptable mechanic.
DvZ,3cqxnm,PickShark,4,Fri Jul 10 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"If you are constantly procced, we might need to evaluate your play style. What monster do you usually play as? How much is what you call a measly amount of damage?"

DvZ,3cqxnm,Konpaatre1,5,Fri Jul 10 07:12:30 2015 UTC,"1)  Try a non-proc class versus player zombies and wolves with Fury of the Night.  Most players simply cannot kill these monsters without the aid of proc.  I can even put it in a swing versus swing scenario:  A fully upgraded zombie without Fury of the Night will heal 1.5 hearts per hit.  A dwarf using a greater runeblade or axe of malice hits for two hearts per swing (less with warhammer, more with dagger).  So, assuming the zombie is just going to stand still and no other mobs arrive, it will take approximately 40 hits to kill a player zombie.  In that time, the zombie also deals base armor damage plus upgraded armor shred damage that probably deals about 30 armor damage per hit (I haven't zombied in awhile).  Using that math, you've just blown through about 1200 armor points.  Someone posted that normal armor has 1000 points of armor so, if that is right, the dwarf is already dead from having no mana to heal due to no armor.  Now factor that a zombie with Fury of the Night will steal 25 mana AND heal for four hearts per hit... poor procless dwarf never stood a chance.  And this entire scenario gets a LOT worse versus wolves.  Let's not forget the fact that only dumb (or very skilled) monsters choose attack alone.  2)  Anti-proc measures?  The only one I know of is for gobos, and they reach that upgrade in just minutes (if it even works), and specials like ogres, golems, pirates, and Bopen.  3)  To paraphrase someone, ""Heroes are supposed to be overpowered; a player is supposed to feel a like badass when playing as a hero, no matter how skilled or unskilled the player is."""
DvZ,3cqxnm,IllyiaSvara,3,Fri Jul 10 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"I'm someone that plays mob 95% of the time (at least until i have my loadout together) and i don't think the proc is a problem at all once you pay the game and understand how easily you can avoid it.   So lets look at the mobs.  Skeleton: a skeleton should never be anywhere near dwarves since they are simply not build for melee combat and they would only feed procs.  Goblin: Goblins are squishy and shouldn't be near dwarfs, they are played the best as a sneaky little devil that places bombs as far away from dwarfs at a wall or inside a wall if possible. They should have a immune to proc upgrade (i never buy that one) so that is already a answer to how to avoid procs. The other 500 upgrade is kaboom and that is the only time you want to be near a dwarf. but that already means you die. If the target is proced or not it will not matter if you only care about dieing, but you should still precast it on a way that it explodes once you enter melee range (if possible try to knock the dwarf towards the mob spawn so we can focus him and nibble on his armor)  Zombie/Wolves: Zombies are the melee fighters that will suffer from the proc the most, to balance this do they have the item ""up to 80% chance to respawn at your last death location globe"". Next to that do they also have leap, just like the wolf: If you see a proced dwarf, turn 180 degrees and rightclick/leap out the death zone and find another target/wait until the proc is over.  BUT ALWAYS run away if you are on low health or from a proced dwarf since you don't want to feed or refresh a proc. there could be exceptions but those are very rare and require DVZ mob experience/upgrades."

DvZ,3cqxnm,Bob_higs,3,Fri Jul 10 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"Monsters are not equal to dwarves. It is a game about endless hordes of monsters descending upon the last remnants of the dwarves race. Monsters are designed to need to overwhelm the dwarves to win. Otherwise it is just another PvP game, which really if people want PvP games DvZ should be wayyyy down low on the list.  (I'm primarily a monster player, secondly dwarven builder, thirdly silly dwarf) Playing as a monster just means playing smart and not trying to just bumrush the dwarves, thats what the AI are for. As a monster player you should target specific dwarves that are in bad spots, low on armour/mana. Push to disrupt defenses and cause as much mayhem as possible not go for the kill unless you know you can get the kill.  Zombies, disruption, attrition, unending.  Goblins, sneak, high AOE damage if hits, destruction.  Skeletons, Wither- Snipe out of position dwarves.                    Fire - AoE DoT, annoyance.                   Impact - Line Dirsuption, silliness. (maybe wall breaker but onlyif the goblins aren't otherwise just outclassed here)"
DvZ,3cqxnm,Codywild1234,2,Fri Jul 10 13:50:26 2015 UTC,"One of the best things about procs is that they are simple. Get a proc and you kill anything else you hit, except for Ogres and Golems. It would be a lot less exciting getting a proc and killing only AI and new zombies.  Another big thing is that AI are there more to annoy and protect actual players from being targeted. While an actual player can really destroy your armor and cause a lot of damage quick. If you couldn't proc actual players with the full health upgrade then by the time you reach 2nd shrine you will only proc AI and not the players. You would have to balance it by debuffing the player mobs then and that is something that is more difficult than changing the proc.   I could see why players who play mob most of the time would hate procs since you can be killed easily, but the game is balanced around people playing dwarf most of the time IMO."
DvZ,3cqxnm,pjvm2000z,2,Fri Jul 10 02:09:12 2015 UTC,"There is no reason why procs shouldn't be a able to kill non-AI's or players. First of all rob specifically said that in the new update dwarfs would seem more powerful due to the addition of more ways to proc, armor changes, and jimmy juice. So he saw this and buffed the zombie rebirth ability so you could come back more even if your proced over and over again. If you play skeleton and get proced you doing it wrong, skeletons should be far away from any dwarfs and sniping them. And Gobos should be hiding and placing boxes at walls, if your want to take the chance of using kaboom or throwing boxes that do massive amounts of damage, then you should have the risk of being proced. Finally any special monsters would rekt face if they couldn't be proced. Golems and orges can be proced by heros."

DvZ,3co15q,Lex_L,6,Thu Jul 9 11:57:40 2015 UTC,"Dang it Lex!  Ya beat me to it!  I was gonna write up a similar guide this very morning... but let me add my own thoughts:  Speedy Dwarfzales, or as I was going to call him... the Elven Hunter-Seeker (with a lore story to go with it), is a build I would classify as a light melee/assassin build.  It tends to be strong against ALL PLAYER monsters (more on this later) and weak versus large groups and, especially, AoE attacks.  With this build, the dwarf is not going to be bragging about  ""getting x K kills"" every game, however, the dwarf's fewer kills will probably be more meaningful to the war effort in the end.  As Lex did a very nice job explaining the core build, I will not duplicate his information, but I will go more in depth about the tactics I use in my build:   For my build, I generally stuck with elven dagger, studded runeleather, crossbow, 20 wrenches, Jimmy Juice (I never have to let of my dagger, gambling on the 80% knockback resist), and 8 spare points that I just stuck into cobble for less prep time in the morning.  (I might suggest getting scrolls in place of cobble as the speedy dwarf is usually first on the scene of a wall breach.) While in most games I do not cross the 10 wrench mark, there was one particularly memorable game where I actually used all 20 of my wrenches without draining all of the dwarven gold supply.  Due to that game, and a lack of other interesting things to get with my points, I decided to keep 20 wrenches. I have found that, except for truly amazing monster players (or green Jimmies), my speed build can effectively deal with all player threats... so long as they come at me one at a time.  The key to my build is going with a crossbow instead of the draw/time bows.  The crossbow keeps with the theme of always being constantly moving.  Granted, moving shots are quite a bit more difficult than standing shots, but with practice the moving bowsman can be a truly terrifying sight to any monster. A player zombie, even one under the Fury of the Night, can have half of their health removed with one shot of the crossbow, even at close range.  Continuously moving, or aiming for the back of the player, can prevent an average fury  zombie from hitting the dwarf too often and can lead to a kill.  Wolves are a slightly different matter: aim to poison them first, then strafe the wolf while firing crossbow at them. Perched skeletons can be a pain to get to.  The combined speed of the build and rapid fire of the crossbow can allow for blind-side shots of any skeletons.  One for fire, three for wither... most perched withers I meet only react after the second hit, and the third arrow is already on the way. Golems in the open field are quite a treat to the speed dwarf.  Run up to the golem for poison, then fall back quickly.  Some golems will try to persue, others flee.  Unloading the crossbow into a golem either way should be enough to kill the golem assuming one does not miss.  It takes about 12 hits, however by the time you fire 10 arrows, 2 have already regenerated. AI trains can be dealt with by unloading the crossbow into them... especially since they are usually polite enough to line up for you. If there are no priority targets to hit, go after a few AI that are attacking other players.  At worst, they'll turn to try to attack you, at best you weaken the zombies for easier procs for the greater runeblade users. ""Super Saiyan Sanik"" with Bruce's horn.  Enough said.   While the build sounds great, and it is for me, it does have a few glaring weaknesses that may or may not be apparent and will need to learn to be dealt with:   The build is EXTREMELY weak versus AoE attacks (fire volley, explosion).  Basically, if it cannot be dodged or run away from, it will WRECK your armor.  Last stands at the final shrine will be tough to survive unless the dwarf is AWAY from the shrine trying to poison gobos or dealing with skeletons on the edges of the room.  That may lead to a quicker shrine fall; either that or a dead dwarf from explosion spam... Do NOT get hit by withers.  Seriously.  Do you want to lose two armor haunches in one shot?  Because that is how you lose two armor haunches in one shot.  ALWAYS circle or strafe withers when you close to melee, and do not charge in head-on. Do not try to take on veteran players alone.  I enjoy dueling with Lex fairly often (usually I as a dwarf and him as a zombie) and while I can take him down easily enough without fury, he can actually survive quite well and make the duel cost too much armor while he has fury.  There are also a couple of wither skeletons out there who have figured out my methods and can surprise me with an arrow or two.   The key thing to the build is that it is not a ""kill everything, sort it out later"" type of build.  The speed build is designed to take out a single threat and then move on to the next one.  Sure, you can poison a horde of gobos or ogres to reduce their damage output, but the true thrill is zeroing in on a single monster and just outright killing them with the higher swing damage plus poison and the occasional crossbow arrow (especially since they cannot outrun you).  I will have to agree with Lex here: it is certainly the most fun build that I have run.  It is strong in its own way, using a fairly unique combination of odd weapons (and runeleather!), with just enough danger to using it to make it interesting.  I'd be glad to take any questions about the build here."
DvZ,3co15q,Adnerp,2,Thu Jul 9 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"I've been on the receiving end of this build more than a few times as a Fury zombie, and it certainly excels in single combat. However, the point Adnerp makes about veteran monsters is spot-on: players like me, Lex, and others are experienced and quick enough to remain maneuverable and land a few hits. While I have never actually killed Adnerp when he uses this build, the armor damage is something you cannot afford to stack up, and coupled with Rebirth and quick reflexes, I've forced Ad to retreat in the face of taking more armor damage than it's worth to kill me.  I'll emphasize that this applies mostly to wolverines and zombies, because they have Pursuit, giving them the potential to be nearly as maneuverable as this build and rack up chip damage you would rather not take. Wither skeletons are arguably more dangerous, but they also don't have the speed to dodge nearly as well, and landing their shots on a speed demon can be pretty tricky. When using this build, I'd advise you to pick your battles carefully at first. Learn to judge which monsters you can take on solo, and which will make more trouble than they're worth to kill. You're fast and powerful, but even a couple of hits can be bad news.  Something else to note is that while wither skeletons are incredibly dangerous, fire skeletons are also big trouble. Thanks to their volley shots, they don't need to be nearly as precise with their aim to hit you, and since every tick of fire damage does armor shred, just being in the the general vicinity of their volleys can make your armor cry. Your best bet is to flank them with the crossbow, and stay out of the cone of effect that their volley shots tend to travel in. They are an overall lesser threat than wither skeletons, but still cannot be taken lightly."
DvZ,3co15q,ArchasTL,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:33:09 2015 UTC,Can you record a video of it? I'd get it but I feel like alot of items are going to get nerfed/buffed so I just wanna see how crazy this speed thing is :P
DvZ,3co15q,Overhighlord,2,Thu Jul 9 23:31:50 2015 UTC,"I have been in games with you in which I was a monster (damn events get me every time), and pretty much all of the monsters agree that you're a horrible person. I mean, I have no problem with it, you're still easily avoided, but MAN the amount of bitching in chat is horrible."
DvZ,3co15q,druid24,3,Thu Jul 9 13:51:56 2015 UTC,The speed is incredibly fun as dwarf and unbelievably frustrating as a wither. I love it.
DvZ,3co15q,WhatTheHellMan,3,Thu Jul 9 12:44:26 2015 UTC,This is why there are no best builds. Because everyone has a different more fun build.
DvZ,3co15q,zzCratoszz,3,Thu Jul 9 12:58:42 2015 UTC,"This is the sort of build I have been using the last few days too.  I had been calling it a ""Hit n Run"" but Speedy Dwarfzales has a nice ring to it :3.    It is really fun to play, but it takes some getting use to.  As you said the strategy should be to always keep moving.  I wanted to hit mobs as I was running by, but I was missing a lot at first. I would swing my dagger but because I wasn't use to the speed it would always be too late, and the mob would be behind me before the swing animation was over.  I ended up lowering my FOV which made it easier to judge distance when attacking with speed, and have had a lot of success/fun since.    As for choosing the other essentials of the loadout, I went with Holy Ale as the extra absorption hearts can make a world of difference with the weaker armor (I'm sure the other potions work just as well, but it just comes down to personal preference).  Also went with Longbow, which is my 'get out of jail free card'.  It is great to have especially if you get swarmed.  What I like to do is run through the battlefield while poisoning mobs, grab a huge train of AI's, lead them away, turn and unleash Longbow arrow hell into them, and it has been very effective so far.  It doesn't take as much time as you hinted at either, maybe 10 secs to clear a train of 15-20 AI's, just put your back to a wall and let them come to you, if they get close enough then you don't really even have to aim.   Full build (64pts) is: - 4pts Elven Dagger  - 16pts Longbow - 8pts Holy Ale - 16pts Studded Runeleather - 16pts Wiggly Wrenches III(20 Wrenches) - 4pts Wizard Mortar I(8 super mortar)"
DvZ,3co15q,comkreaperkiller,3,Thu Jul 9 14:48:11 2015 UTC,Dagger gives a 50% speed boost. Just minecraft numbers are stupid so it looks like 5% on the tooltip

DvZ,3ckya3,Overhighlord,6,Wed Jul 8 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Some tips for those who wish to record (from someone who has sent in a lot tickets over the last year):  -Names need to be clear in the video. And need to be clear they are connected to the hacker.   -Videos can be short. It's better to send in 30 seconds of only the hacker than 20 minutes of you chasing him down. However, you need to maintain continuity between seeing the name of the hacker and them actually hacking as best you can. So avoid making cuts that ruin that continuity.  -If you can it is helpful to include the tab list with the recording. It helps confirm names, and provide connection context.  -If you cut your video for slow motion replay, it is best to also include the original real-time chunk.  -You can also use a freeze frame technique in your video editor to make it easier to see the name. But again inlcude the unaltered clip as well.  -In your support ticket include the name of the hacker and a brief description of the hack.  -For those that also do regular series, set your vids to unlisted on YouTube, so it doesn't clutter your external facing channel with hacker videos.  -OBS has a start recording hotkey. It is your best friend. Can't speak for Fraps or others.  That is all I can think of now. Feel free to include other tips."

DvZ,3cm1ec,SGT_JACKAL,3,Wed Jul 8 23:26:55 2015 UTC,My only request is that you have the ability to cast flare.
DvZ,3cm1ec,Sarah2376,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:35:55 2015 UTC,I wanna cast a spell...
DvZ,3cm1ec,iamtallerthanyou,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:37:21 2015 UTC,AHG MY EYES!!!! DAMN IT WHY DO YOU DO THIS?!?!?!
DvZ,3cm1ec,JamhaloS,2,Thu Jul 9 22:32:27 2015 UTC,"Gotta remember that what I really look for in weapons are things that change your playstyle.    Weapon   Lumberjack axe doesn't really have a playstyle and I don't really see it being good against anything. It's also impossible to tell the health of a monster and so having an ability that's based on hitting monsters below a certain health is kinda hard to play around, you'll just randomly do a bunch of damage.   Bow   We have a bow that snares that were gonna try out at a later date.   Potion   We have a potion that does something similar to this in mind for a future update.   Armor   We don't want to create armor that makes you not wear armor when you play as a jimmy, mostly because of the limitations of minecraft/armor system. We would love if every armor had different textures and skins and stuff, but that's not possible. Anyway, a resistance buff as a dwarf isn't all that valuable, I guess I could make an armor that makes it so you rarely ever need to heal until your armor breaks, but jimmy juice kinda already does what this would accomplish."
DvZ,3cm1ec,Rurikar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:22 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for your feedback
DvZ,3cm1ec,Derrheat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:05:02 2015 UTC,Umm... What?
DvZ,3cm1ec,josh__ab,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds a bit op, but I do like the idea behind the Lumberjack axe (minus the AOE)"
DvZ,3cm1ec,Headcrabhat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"It might sound op but these are just numbers I guess with no way to know how good it would be,  balancing the numbers could make them be just fine"
DvZ,3cm1ec,MegaMicrogames,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:22:03 2015 UTC,"The bow would have to be an AoE snare with a radius of like 2 or 3 blocks, otherwise there is no excuse for the damage debuff if it just snares one enemy."
DvZ,3cm1ec,MegaMicrogames,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:45:09 2015 UTC,"I like the sound of the theme, especially given the importance of chopping wood in DvZ already. Maybe a more general name like ""Woodsman"" or ""Survivalist"" would give you more wiggle room for ideas on the bow and armor.  Was the ale's name a typo of ""Lumberjack Lager""? I wonder if a maple syrup healing potion would be theme-appropriate or just too silly. Its stickiness could slow you down when it's in your hand.  Also, may I suggest the axe instead be called the... ""Lumberge Axe""? I use that name for my SSP diamond axes, but I'd love to see it make it's way into DvZ or UR Live. This post was a perfect excuse for me to get it out of my head and into some kind of public forum.  Thanks for sharing your ideas, Sarge!"
DvZ,3cm253,Sarah2376,15,Wed Jul 8 23:32:30 2015 UTC,"If you can't commit an hour to playing DvZ, you just really shouldn't start a game. DvZ is a very intense games, it's not healthy for people to sit in the back afk."
DvZ,3cm253,Rurikar,9,Wed Jul 8 23:35:05 2015 UTC,"While that is true, life is a mystery, Rob. You don't always know what's going to happen in 20 minutes from now.  During one of my DVZ games couple of weeks ago water stared pouring down my wall onto my bed. Needless to say, I went AFK pretty fast."
DvZ,3cm253,FallDamage312,5,Thu Jul 9 07:35:48 2015 UTC,"In fairness that's a pretty low probability event. For the average day, the average player is more than capable of working out if they have approx 45-60 minutes for continuous DvZ.  Occasional cases aren't really worth complex algorithms over, particularly as getting afk kicked by misfortune isn't a high impact event on the game."
DvZ,3cm253,Tebotron,2,Thu Jul 9 10:32:35 2015 UTC,"What if you have to go to the bathroom or something? Ive had times where in the time i get to the bathroom, go, and get back, ive already been kicked, dooming myself to play mob. I feel like it should be implemented but with only like an extra 5 mins before you get kicked and mo gold gains. Just my opinion tho."
DvZ,3cm253,LittleBlast5,3,Thu Jul 9 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"Then just go to the bathroom. It's a game, and much like any multiplayer game if you go AFK to do something else then you're open to the consequences of that. It's not worth their time implementing a system so you can pee during a game."
DvZ,3cm253,Doom_BringerMC,5,Thu Jul 9 14:30:30 2015 UTC,If you need to afk and do IRL stuff just leave the game and come back later as mob.
DvZ,3cm253,Morvereth,2,Thu Jul 9 00:18:44 2015 UTC,The afk timer gives you 5 minutes (iirc) to account for short term crisis needs to leave a game. Otherwise I don't see any need to add anything more as you can always reenter the game as mob after you leave.

Clef actually used to be GPZ and I ususally met him when  I tryharded my way up the leaderboards in pmc (lol).(Hey I got paladin in the end with ~25000 sword kills) also I would also say thank you to CptAmazing98 who actually bought me patron for 30 days so I could be a paladin (you needed to be top 100 with patron on pmc). Unfortunately again they have changed their usernames and I sorely miss playing with them. I actually survived my longest game with them (2 hours long, with me and another one of my friend whyusomean (who was also a GPZ for three days) making 5 stacks of torches on a map called daragor) I don't even know if they play dvz anymore but they were my first friends in dvz.

DvZ,3ckktl,Aragoth_,3,Wed Jul 8 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"I remember that my very first hero game was as Bruce on the Alpha Gym, in a ByoK game. Back then, zombies had a spawn protection buff to prevent spawn camping, meaning zombies could one-shot any dwarf for ten seconds after spawning. About two minutes into the match, I got straight-up one-shot by a zombie that was launched from spawn by a creeper (creeper blasts affected mobs back then), and was just dumbfounded by that turn of events. The creeper player apologized to me, realizing I was fairly new, and invited me to a Skype channel to talk about the game.  That creeper was Roxie, and I became part of the group that later would be called the Penguins, and later still ""that Teamspeak."" From there, I met tons of great people like Fig, Wifi, Toby, johnb43, Kurtvatis, and more. I spend a whole hell of a lot of time there now. :)"

Not sure if I have ever killed him in a game.

DvZ,3cl595,konge40,5,Wed Jul 8 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"Adding new weapons should be about creating playstyles, not just mixing different things together.  Othe's Battleaxe is worthless.   The leap is only really useful outdoors and a 1 second proc is too hard to use to ever be interesting even with increased movespeed. It doesn't make a new playstyle, it's just Runeblade with a leap.  Sunfury is annoying.  Once you are inside you don't really know if it's night or day. While I have thought to use the outside in the sun mechanique, to be honest I feel like it wouldn't be an enjoyable one. Even if you were perma proced in Sunlight, it would only be a mediocre weapon.  Dragon Flail  Monsters shoot volleys of flaming arrows. We don't need both sides having the same abilities as it just adds noise to the game making it unclear who is doing what. It would also be completely annoying for mobs. It has to be worth it to dump almost all your arrows in a single volley which means it has to be very powerful against monsters. Volley just isn't something I think Dwarves need, I have plans to try out some anti AI bows down the road though which involve AE.  Bowstaff  Is the warhammer. The jumping back and forth thing was cute, but wasn't really fun.  Blade of Endor  A defense buff isn't going to be able to counter armor shred. I might be able to make a system which reduces armor shred if a buff is on a player which is interesting, but that's not exactly a playstyle on it's own.  Revenge  We have something like this for a future update.  Crystallized Runearmor  Not happening. There is no way for mobs to know who is wearing it and who isn't without me dedicating an armor to just this upgrade. I could make it so they don't wear armor as well, but even then it's a dumb upgrade because it just greatly imbalances the game by messing with the repair system. Every hardcore player would see this as mandatory.  Defenders Crystal Flask   A Dwarf really shouldn't get more powerful when a Shrine has no gold. Things like this get out of control when multiple players have them."
DvZ,3cl595,Rurikar,2,Wed Jul 8 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"Thx for the feedback. Didnt really think everything thru, but it makes sence that all items should focus around playstyles and not variasjon. Il keep that in mind when I post something in the future. :)"

DvZ,3cl595,Doom_BringerMC,0,Wed Jul 8 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"The damages are to high, remember the runeblade is only 6 damage and this is the most damaging melee weapon.  Unbreakable armour, a few good players is all you'd need to make a shrine stay alive for pretty much eternity.  Like I remember back on PMC with armour still being able to break but dwarves limited to the gold they carry (#420gold) rather than gold for all. A few stacks of gold and the wrenches fully upgraded made progress so damn painful. This was when withers could 3 shot people it was still painful to progress when good dwarves got together. Unbreaking armour would become the only armour to be used. Good dwarves would be near unkillable outside of maybe double golem targetting them and maybe an ogre mage. Outside of that yeah no just 5 could easily hold the second and final shrine for ages without worry.  I know I can hold a shrine fairly well as a regular dwarf with the only reason to fall back being armour and I'm nowhere near being the top players.   Revenge- Feels kinda meh really. How often do dwarves die, really you only get mass deaths at the end, apart from that just a few random proc here and there. Good sure but useful maybe if your lucky, reliable not a chance.  The last one, might be useful but only at final in general sadly. Not many well stay at the first shrine or second when gold runs out simply since otherwise with a few well placed goblins they die quite nicely."
DvZ,3cl595,IllyiaSvara,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:03:10 2015 UTC,"The damages are to high, remember the runeblade is only 6 damage and this is the most damaging melee weapon.   The Runeblade is +10 attack damage and it isn't the most damaging melee weapon. Both the Warhammer and the Elven Dagger do +15 attack damage. While I agree +20 attack may be too much for the Sunfury (as it is Excaliju level) I feel the others are fine for damage, if anything I'd say the point values are off.     The armour idea I really like, I would like to see more in the way of armour for the loadout system. But what has been proposed is basically how the Heroes work, they have no armour values but their mana cost is increased. Heroes get 3 rows of hearts so it's not as impactful, but with the way monsters are, they can deal a lot of damage in a short time-frame; goblins, withers, fire skellies, spiderlings, venomburners, all have abilities that eat through health regardless of armour. It would essentially be anti-zombie, anti-wolf armour and that'd only be effective during the day. At night they can both mana steal so the benefits would mostly be negated. Sure they'd still be regening mana at the same rate but to a lower maximum value. At final they may not need to worry about gold or repairing, but with goblins doing huge bursts of damage, a lot of fully upgraded mobs able to eat away at their mana. The 10 point value may be greatly underestimated and the mana values could be tweaked but I think it could work."
DvZ,3cl595,Doom_BringerMC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:54:57 2015 UTC,Doom are you sure? In the loadout screen it says the runeblade is +6damage with the others all below it.

DvZ,3ci4ty,ZamTheJimmy,12,Wed Jul 8 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Not to be poking your eyeball or anything but... do you think Rawb did not think of this already? Im pretty sure he did. Rawb did try to bring out players. It was in that update video. If the server capped out he would hire a Musician. That was how he would know if the fan base was there. Turns out it was not enough.    You dont need to ask Rawb to expand on DvZ. He fucking loves DvZ as he put it. He knows how his creation could be worked on. How else did this latest update come out? Sure some of the vets may disagree with the dumbed down aspect, but some of it works well. The Custom kits! the Mob Heros! I've played DvZ since PMC and I love what happened recently. He'll keep working on it. He would probably make videos on it.   But it is important to remember, you dont need to tell someone with a passion how to act on their passion. Its like telling a passionate fireman how to put out fires. He knows already knows. Why else is he on the field?"
DvZ,3ci4ty,NaquIma,4,Wed Jul 8 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"I know the server didn't max out, but I just don't think it was an accurate measure of players who support the server. There are tons of different players in different financial situations. I'm one who loves the server, but simply couldn't find the money at this point in time. That doesnt mean I won't become a super jimmy somewhere down the line. I know Rob loves DvZ. This update says it all. Rob and Nis are hard workers. And like I said, I'm not trying to tell Rob what to do, just putting my opinion out there and seeing if others agree."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Ginauz,11,Wed Jul 8 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"Plus he opened the gates to friendship town on LOM that night. The whole of the ts I was in was going to play DVZ but then suddenly we could go beyond the wall for one night only, im sure we were not the only people that made that decision"
DvZ,3ci4ty,Alderdash,5,Wed Jul 8 09:56:19 2015 UTC,"Aye, same basically happened over in our Mumble: most of us are in the UK and Europe, so several folk had already left by that time of night (because time-zones) and the other few who were hanging around also play LoM and between playing one game of DvZ before bed, or a more relaxing stroll outside the walls on Lords, LoM won..."

DvZ,3ci4ty,IllyiaSvara,3,Wed Jul 8 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"The server capping was always gonna be hard on a two day notice plus the having to decide for many where to spend money Saturday's stream or something to not interact with the people you are a fan of. In general , people would rather spend on interacting with the person they are a fan of in anyway rather than spend just to play a game, especially on a limited budget.  I'm not sure that there is enough push really to make DvZ big again, think about back on PMC is what the single largest consistent game there. Never once could I not find multiple games going there. The other games were always a lot fewer.  The problem is there is nothing to draw the fans to DvZ especially given DvZ for the most part is not something you can interact with Rob and the Buffalowizards on since at best niso and rob just watch games now. Its sad yes, but its the way things are."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Rayalot72,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:31:20 2015 UTC,"Are you saying DvZ only had one constant game?  Because after last summer's update I remember being able to hop on any weekend and find 15+ games running at one time.  Even on the new server there's always 3+ games, and that's on weekdays."
DvZ,3ci4ty,MillicentOak,2,Thu Jul 9 16:54:52 2015 UTC,Never once could I not find multiple games going there. The other games were always a lot fewer.   I think it's single largest consistent game as in minigame or gamemode.
DvZ,3ci4ty,IllyiaSvara,2,Thu Jul 9 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you weren't around from pretty much December onwards. Last summer updater things spiked as they always do when an update. This was also on PMC, so lets remove the time at PMC and instead look at just the current server. Untill the recent update happened for most of the day you were lucky to be able to get a game at all if you were from any other part of the world apart from NA.  Go through the subreddit and look at all the posts about silliness in the lobby. The hours people waited to get games running who weren't on US time.  Even then it was rarely more than 2 games at most.  Only since the update and then only since the video did we see any real numbers.  Every single DvZ member that plays even semi regularly knows that untill the recent update the game was living off of just the fans of DvZ and not the fans of Rob, with games being few. That's exactly why the entire player requirement getting smaller the longer the lobby has been up for came into being. There simply were not enough players to get games running at what Rob sees as the best level for DvZ. We were lucky to get 30 in a game.  Every single DvZ regular or even semi regular knows this is the case. Unless DvZ actually gets some love it'll be the exact same situation again.  Look at LoM when videos and content slows down, then picks back up as just another example. You get left with those that are fans of the game staying and those that are fans of Rob/BW moving on to whatever they are currently doing.  It is a simple fact that has repeated constantly. Videos stop for a long time, numbers dwindle down. Update pops up, numbers rise, videos come out, server gets close to max if not max.  Hell the only reason DvZ had so many players constantly in PMC is because for the longest time DvZ was the only what I would call Unique minigame. Yes GM was different in its style, but at its core was just another PvP based partly on skill and a lot of luck. Beyond that there was very little in PMC to differentiate it from elsewhere so the overflow of people looking to do stuff but having nothing went to DvZ when it was there.  This can be proven by how many players never followed DvZ when it moved but stayed at PMC. They played because it was the only consistent different game on PMC, not because they were fans of DvZ but fans of PMC. This is not me attacking PMC, why should they have made another game when they had DvZ at the time a successful game that can keep people if people are drawn to it. They have also shown they can make games that can get people interested as well.  So it comes back round to the point of, if fans of Rob/BW play for the chance at interacting with Rob/BW, (proof in LoM, general success of stream goals, can be seen in other fandoms as well) they well move on as they move on. As has been done many times.  The game numbers well dwindle again back to the few of us that actually play as fans of DvZ. Each of us knows that getting a game up was a case of waiting hours at a time. This is not a joke, this is not exaggeration, a lot of the what would be considered hardcore players know this was true. 3 full games before this update was an extreme rarity, at best it was partially filled games running due to the player requirement decrease over time added into NA evening time. Any other timezone was screwed massively in trying to get a game."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Rayalot72,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"I never denied that Rob's work had an effect on the DvZ player count.  I just don't think it's that huge.  Almost every game of Rob's that wasn't kept alive by streams or videos lost players not because there was something else Rob was working on more, but because it got old.  Not only was December onward extremely broken with shields, but it was basically the exact same thing that was on Bruce's Gym, which Rob's main fanbase had played for a year already.  The Summer updates are always new and shiny, and while that's the same reason people liked LoM and such so much when it first came out.  A lot of the bursts on LoM don't involve interaction with Rob or the BW at all, but were just an update or change that did a lot ingame.  Throughout most of the summer update on PMC Rob did very few stream games, and those were patron things.  There are probably a lot of factors to where Rob's fanbase is going to go, but I very seriously doubt it's completely to be with Rob, that's just a contributing factor."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Sarah2376,2,Thu Jul 9 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair you had to pay money to join the server at the time, but I get the point."
DvZ,3ci4ty,taryntheterrible,-2,Wed Jul 8 03:39:17 2015 UTC,"Let me hold you there.  The only place Rob MENTIONED the server cap-out was on an obscure moment in his youtube video. He said possibly sunday, but the issue was he was under alot of false assumptions there :  1 : He was under the assumption he had just called it as official, that EVERYBODY had heard the news by sunday and that they would have all known about it. However, since he didn't mention it anywhere besides his youtube, and he didn't even specify WHICH sunday, you can't say the playerbase wasn't there. The playerbase WAS there... they just didn't know. He didn't even add a tweet to go along with it, so people who checked his twitter would know. Making it a double whammy. Believe it or not, there are ALOT of DvZ fans, who don't play the game 24/7, and who don't watch his channel. And they are some of the best damn fans of the game out there.   2 : He was under the assumption we could all afford Super Jimmy.  To be honest, there is no such thing as a server cap when donations are involved. Especially when you were as obscure as it could get with informing the public about it. If that had've been a hell of a lot more official, then the server would have filled. Without a doubt.   3 : Half the people wouldn't have even attended, due to the fact he never said precisely at what time, and so even if some of us PLANNED on attending, it was Sunday. Alot of people could've had something like church, or were out doing things with their family. They didn't have time to plan to waste their whole sunday waiting for the ""DvZ gods to decent from heaven and deliver us a musician"" . Most of the people who did hear out of him probably weren't playing DvZ. They were probably doing something else. And since DvZ is a minecraft minigame, it has competition. Unless you are seriously informal, there is no such thing as spreading news."
DvZ,3ci4ty,NaquIma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"wow... ok... you are alittle late... by a week... but let me bring out some points you and I can agree on.   Communication is 2 ways: if a guy hears about something, and he sees another guy not too informed, he would tell the other guy Assuming always makes and ASS out if U and ME: it screws everyone over People have lives: who gives a crap about playing a game for the rest of our days.   That satisfy you? Now here is my defense.  First off... Rawb was going for his YOUTUBE fan-base. Proof? this is proof. Proposition for who? The YouTube audience... No need to tweet it. Most who is on follows his twitter did it for updates on DvZ, streams, or for silly memes. Right now its mostly streams... When? that coming Sunday in the evening. Proof? this is proof. When was it? That coming Sunday 6PM-9PM EST.  Second off... At the time, there were already at least 120 Super Jimmies by the time of that video i showed you not once, but TWICE. How do I know? I looked at the server lists... Sorry I dont have a screenshot for proof this time, but I can say I have indeed seen at least 120 Jimmies on. Rawb said he wanted 350 on. 350 - 120 is 230. How many subscribers does Rawb have? Well right now 130 THOUSAND. No I dont thing that YouTube fan base was there...  Third off... A) he did say when... no point to use THAT argument again... B) dont have time? well the Lobby does not kick you for being on too long. I should know. I was ""online"" for extended periods of time. C) If you didnt hear about it OFC you are not going to play. Welcome to Obviousvile!  So... did I give you enough reasoning to think about YOUR response again? I think I disproved, or made more stupid, all of your arguments."

DvZ,3ci4ty,winter477,3,Fri Jul 17 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"The thing that is keeping LoM alive is the community but mostly the buffalo wizards on LoM. Before the update DvZ has been surviving solely on the community and a little bit of rob and nis. If DvZ has a constant 200-250 people during the afternoon I definitely think Rob should in some way interact in game sort of like lom. I honestly don't think he should bring back streams since he just doesn't enjoy them, and if he were to bring them back they just wouldn't feel the same."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Sarah2376,2,Wed Jul 8 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"Rob already said that he would not be bringing back DvZ streams, as in his opinion the game was not suited for them anymore, but I may be wrong on that. I agree though, doing videos and collabs on DvZ once he is done working on other projects would be great for it. Just remember that he has a dozen different projects to juggle and all of that. I'd say it would be a thing that comes next Summer."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Sarah2376,4,Wed Jul 8 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not asking for streams. I understand Rob is not planning on streaming DvZ. While I observe Rob has many projects to work on and limited time to complete them, I am a firm believer that DvZ deserves a spot on Rob's channel considering it played such a large role in its foundation. But, of course it's Rob's channel, and Rob's decision."
DvZ,3ci4ty,IllyiaSvara,2,Wed Jul 8 03:44:39 2015 UTC,"Well I have to agree with you there, then."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Sarah2376,2,Wed Jul 8 05:02:54 2015 UTC,"Next summer without anything to push for DvZ the game well be back to being maybe a single game only. Why? Simple reason really, a community of fans of Rob, well follow Rob to what Rob is currently doing in order to maybe have the chance of interacting with him.  This is the problem, by next Summer if nothing is done to show DvZ being played by Rob/BuffaloWizards only those that are fans of DvZ apart from being a fan of Rob shall remain here.  Look at LoM, its filled to the brink when they are doing stuff regularly, down to the tens when they started to move onto other stuff.  This is the simple nature of fandom in general. If not neccesarily a fan of the game but instead of Rob/Buffalowizards, people well go to where they believe Rob/BW are playing and doing stuff for the chance of being able to interact with them. It is why the stream gets so many. (in general, gobo's of pat was different I believe but personally when watching it just felt off to me, might have to others and that could easily have been why it was different than past ones).  Or to take another group that I'm sure at some point most of Robs fans have heard of and maybe even watched. Mindcrack, when they do their charity streams and such with the oppurtunity for people to donate to make stuff happen to directly affect them and thereby interact with them they always ended up with well over their initial number.   Being able to interact with the person you are a fan of well almost always trump being able to play a game with no chance of interacting with the person you are a fan of.  DvZ unless it gets love and this is the cold matter of things just from past occurrences, how multiple fan bases react, and current going on's. Well show a decline in numbers again so that come next Summer we well be in the same situation as we were at the start of this summer and we already know that rob is thinking of no more big updates for DvZ because of lack of numbers. Its a self fulfilling prophecy in effect. By not wanting to spend time on a project and not interact with a project due to lowered interest in the project from others leads to even lower interest as the fans follow where the interest of the creator currently is.  If the game is going to be big again it needs input from Rob/BW, otherwise it well never ever be big again. Come next summer back to being just the few of us that normally play."

I understand in the online community the need to attack others over their spelling and grammar is a way in which people use to attempt to feel superior given their simple lack of anyother viable response. It has and always well be a form of toxic behaviour simply through its inherent nature.   If a reply can not be formed without having to not just target someones grammar and spelling but then include insults as if it somehow physically harms you in real life is not a reply of any value in any discussion. It is the start an ad hominem, something which any form of valued discussion should avoid like the plague."

You are definitely overreacting to what essentially was a playful jab, though. Relax. No one is insulting you on a personal level.  If you feel a post does not objectively contribute to the discussion at hand, downvote it and move on. Your drawing attention to it makes it worse."
DvZ,3ci4ty,epicdragon905,2,Wed Jul 8 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"The thing is, DvZ might still be a gold mine for Rob and the BW, and it has been so for a while on his channel, but it's not currently the best gold mine he can mine anymore. Rob has switched to many other projects that a lot more people enjoy, so coming back to DvZ doesn't make a lot of sense anymore. He did LoM that's the same kind of rp content that is really popular and he's doing URL that's quite a success as well.  And for you it might feel like DvZ is the best game ever that would provide the greatest content on Rob's channel, but it might not be the same opinion for other people who never enjoyed DvZ, either as a game or as streams, or those who never even cared about it and have caught up on Rob's channel when he was doing TTT, LoM or URL. For those people they would feel that LoM is the gold mine and Rob should definitely focus more on that instead of wasting time on DvZ. But people are often blinded by nostalgia, not realizing that the content they might enjoy more is the content Rob hasn't even started yet.  Talking about Rob's content, DvZ cannot be a central point in his channel because he said he got bored of it as a video production material. He doesn't want to stream anymore, and he wants to move away from let's plays because he feels that's a market that's saturated and that might even stop growing in the future. DvZ being mostly gameplay with some roleplay aspect, going back to doing content on it would be a regression. He prefers making his channel evolve to producing content that he enjoys doing more and where he could really show his creativity. And in the end people never watched DvZ, TTT or LoM for watching Rob kill zombies, unmask terrorists or build post offices. They watch those series to see Rob do silly roleplay and interact with other funny people. And DvZ is not the best format to encourage that, LoM and URL and whatever series Rob comes up with in the future best DvZ for that point.  Also, Rob doesn't promote the DvZ server as much as he could because he doesn't want to and he couldn't even if he did. The server is fairly small and making it bigger is a lot more complicated than buying a couple more servers. Big servers that accept a lot of people cost way more money, enough so Rob couldn't pay it from his pocket alone, and that is a dangerous and scary route to go. Rob doesn't want to make DvZ bigger, he just wants to make it big enough so there's always at least one game running so that people can enjoy the game at any time.  And that's a big point, he wants it to stay active. He doesn't want to abandon it or let it die, otherwise he wouldn't have made a total revamp. In one of his videos he said that he would do occasional DvZ videos, even with the other BW, except not as a main series but at least often enough so that the playerbase doesn't die and renews itself.  So don't worry for the server Jimmy, as long as the monsters keep winning the game and Old Man Willakers hasn't vanquished the darkness, he will keep living this glorious battle over and over. Because that's the Old Man's curse as much as it is his blessing."
DvZ,3ci4ty,Overhighlord,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:27:23 2015 UTC,"Well, the server is already laggy as heck with 300 people on. More would make it unplayable. On top of that, they would run out of wool colors to name each game."

DvZ,3ci4ty,istisp,2,Wed Jul 8 14:28:42 2015 UTC,Can't they just upgrade the server? More ram? I'm sure this has been answered but if the player base is expanding the the server should as well.
DvZ,3ci4ty,Tripleat,3,Wed Jul 8 15:15:18 2015 UTC,He's talked about it before and it goes back to the fact that the server costs would get way too high if they tried to expand for more servers. And the super Jimmy week showed that the support for DvZ might not be there right now to afford expanding it
DvZ,3ci4ty,PickShark,2,Wed Jul 8 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"Buffing a server to let it accept more people is way more complicated than just downloading more RAM. Servers are limited by their processing power and their bandwidth as well, you need to purchase several servers, that means making the server scalable so it's not just like having a separate DvZ 1 and DvZ 2, it's way more work for the admins to maintain the servers, you need to purchase special tools and DDOS protections (and those are expensive), your community grows bigger and as a good part of the work is maintaining and managing your community, you need a bigger staff, more mods, more admins, and the day your server stops being popular and drops in visitors, you find yourself with the same player base as before but with an infrastructure several times too big and too expensive. catches breath  That's risky, scary, and since the EULA which made Minecraft become an unfriendly platform for mod developers and server owners, Rob has no interest in keeping making Minecraft minigame servers. He'll keep this one running to not die, but he has no intention in making it big."

DvZ,3cgrwl,IllyiaSvara,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call what is currently available in DvZ as proper support items. At best is the healing star which really isn't that valuable come mid-late game.  Support can only become useful if the items are available to do so. Right now personally I feel Niso is in the best position for running as a support unit that can make a difference and actually shows off how strong a support can be. Take niso as a range/spell caster. Tinderflame/wormhole are his two best spells in general. Tinderflame, slow down and damage mobs along with clear out AI swarms. Good for rocket booting to aid a dwarf in trouble or for lowering the health of player mobs for others nearby. Wormhole retreating, wormhole set ups, wormhole traps. Wormhole into tinderflame for those pesky bigger mobs.   Knockback 50 is an iffy spell, just due to how you might not neccesairly help. Truthfully I find tinderflame works better as a support spell than knockback 50. At most its an emergency get the hell away from me into rocketboot escape.  Rocketboots are essential for support niso, the unbeatable mobility lets you aid across the entire wall.  Niso can be played as a 100% support unit, people just forget supports aren't neccesarily passive and often to run a support good and have a proper impact often takes more skill just due to increased need for map wide awareness, moving all over in a team game like this (first shrine) and being able to figure out who actually needs help and who doesn't. Killing mobs is easy, rolling a proc is easy once you learn how. Support in a large game like this your always moving and watching and having to change what your doing.  Just right now, support items are pretty non-existent for regular dwarves."

They need more items to make the game viable for teamwork, right now each items beyond one is a case of help yourself and don't care for others."

DvZ,3cg7kd,firebolt8900,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:30:02 2015 UTC,Rob has too much on his plate to worry about this (I think anyway).

They may only want to watch it from Rob so there is nothing you can do if that happens.

DvZ,3cg0fz,Sarah2376,7,Tue Jul 7 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"I think something similar to the stats pages was suggested when the server moved from PMC, and Rob said no as it would just end up in people creating unofficial leaderboards.  Lords has an in-game bio function which removes the need to sign up to a website. I wouldn't be remotely interested in getting a Buffalo Wizards newsletter because I am a fan of DvZ rather than of the Buffalo Wizards, so it would just be spam to me."
DvZ,3cg0fz,Tomlough,2,Tue Jul 7 17:34:10 2015 UTC,Well I imagine an option to opt out of the newsletter would be provided.

DvZ,3cg0fz,PickShark,4,Tue Jul 7 17:57:50 2015 UTC,if leaderboards made a return i don't think i'd play again. inevitably they ruin the game by making people play in non standard ways that hurt the team.
DvZ,3cg0fz,Doom_BringerMC,4,Tue Jul 7 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like the direction that Rob is going now with team based gameplay.  Leaderboards are the exact opposite of teamplay, some people just go out of their way to hurt others for their own kills."
DvZ,3cg0fz,IllyiaSvara,2,Tue Jul 7 19:44:25 2015 UTC,The issue with Leaderboards is it promotes much more competitive gameplay and DvZ is not a competitive game.

DvZ,3cg0fz,Mobius1B,3,Tue Jul 7 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Statistics in general aren't the best idea if they track something people have direct control over. Things like the best and worst AIs are reasonable because players don't have any control over that.  I do like the idea of having certain statistics available, but it might just be hard to find a good way of doing it without making the game feel competitive like it was back when we had the leaderboards."
DvZ,3cg0fz,TheFlightlessEagle,3,Tue Jul 7 19:36:58 2015 UTC,In a way I agree but removing the leader boards was a good way to reduce the number of tryhards in a game that can be ruined by tryhards. Still would it really hurt to put up some player statistics especially team based ones like ravage kills by the dwarves in a game.

DvZ,3cely3,Jhojji,13,Tue Jul 7 08:44:52 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of Bruce getting weaker as the game progresses. Sure in a game of attrition it makes a lot of sense but this way of doing it is a bit weird. Heroes already get a lot of mob attention for being Heroes, if his heals cost in excess of 100 mana every time it seems like he'd be the first to die once final rolls around. Whilst before if a good player got Hero they were just unkillable, now it seems that Bruce won't be as much of a juggernaut as he used to be. As for the idea of newer players getting to be a Hero and having the feeling of being completely over-powered without those concerns of letting the team down I feel this counter-acts that. I certainly wouldn't want to play as Bruce or any Hero if they all have this mechanic, I'm terrible with mana conservation."
DvZ,3cely3,Doom_BringerMC,7,Tue Jul 7 09:17:00 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of Bruce getting weaker as the game progresses.   Tough. This had to happen.  Bruce is designed so that basically newbs can be a beast all the time. Easy procs that are easy to roll. But the problem is for expert players, this would make the game end with all three heroes still alive. Look at the other two heroes, they are almost ALWAYS alive when the final shrine falls. We had games where there is still 1000 gold and just three heroes fighting at the shrine, that's not good for the game as players knew heroes were basically unkillable and were completely ignoring them already.  All the heroes will have the same healing abilities where at the start of the game they are basically completely unkillable, but by the end of the game they will have mana troubles and die just like any other dwarf. This makes it so early game, any player can be a beast on a bruce and the later a game goes, the more and more likely he can die.  With the current changes to bruce I went in a test game and did nothing but kill farm. The game ended we me having over 1500 kills on bruce in a 4k kill game. The changes on him so far are fine, your just comparing his survivability to the other heroes that essentially have unlimited mana."
DvZ,3cely3,Rurikar,2,Wed Jul 8 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean as I have just finished a game on Grove as Bruce. I did not realize about the mana mechanics although I did notice my mana becoming a problem  as the game progressed, but its not as bad as you think. Yes, I did have to hide one or 2 times on final (in that secret room behind the gravel) but nothing crazy as I could still wreck havoc for the mobs all alone on the front wall and hold down proc halls once again all alone on final. My opinion is that Bruce is fine as he is now. There are stuff that can kill him but he is still the best hero.  Btw I believe Virendra can act as a dragon skin bow with no cooldown  Edit: This damn keyboard and the broken space button are ruining my life"
DvZ,3cely3,AlphaChilli,10,Tue Jul 7 12:16:02 2015 UTC,"Why is Bruce having his survivability nerfed? To me, Bruce is the immortal commander of the dwarves, cursed to never die, cursed to relive the extinction of his people for eternity. At least from a lore perspective, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for him to die.  And then from a gameplay perspective, Bruce is effectively immortal ANYWAY, even with this ale change. Bad players will die as Bruce, and good players will survive; while I hate to propose anything in DvZ as binary, I feel this is close to it. Bruce, in the current build, is not designed to die, ever. A lack of armor makes him immune to the armor shred mechanic, Jimmy Juice makes him incredibly easy to play without having to micromanage your health too much, and he has immense killing power between Excaliju, Virendra, and the Horn of the Buffalo. And you know something? I'm okay with Bruce being effectively immortal. It's thematically appropriate, and gives newer players a chance at being God, which can certainly draw people to the game.  What I would propose as a Bruce nerf is a nerf to his offense, not his defense. Make his proc shorter, make Excaliju do less damage, give the Horn a longer cooldown, something like that. The issue people have with Bruce is not his insane survivability, but his insane survivability ON TOP of his insane damage output. I say make Bruce easier to play as by allowing him to stay alive basically forever (not counting, of course, incredibly risky or dumb play, like swimming in lava for a few minutes), but in exchange, make Bruce harder to excel at playing by making him work harder for a proc.  EDIT: Also, there's a super sekrit way for Bruce to actually be physically unable to die, no matter how much damage he takes. But I'm not telling. :)"

DvZ,3cely3,Imhotep0,4,Tue Jul 7 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Mostly to be a tease, lol.  But basically, if Bruce blocks, he heals every time he gets hit. Like, four or five hearts worth of healing. I'm pretty sure it's a remnant of the shield healing item that was removed early in testing, and Excaliju was overlooked. It's absurdly OP, but it's an obvious bug."

DvZ,3cely3,Rurikar,5,Wed Jul 8 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"ehh... I think this was a necessary change, as bruce was practically invincible before the nerf. but I think the nerf hammer came down on bruce a little too... hard....   sure he needed nerf, but he didn't need a trainwreak.  I can handle bruce using more mana, after all, he is using the same juice. but increasing for every dead jimmy just makes it little bit harder in the long run. the mobs already do more dmg, and get stronger with every dead jimmy, and every shrine captured, in the last shrine, bruce can die easier than normal jimmys!  sure, you can say ""well, if he procs, he will survive much longer"" but do you know somethings that can still damage bruce even with his procs? gobo bombs and arrows. they do a so much dmg (armor and health) that bruce will be using 100+ mana every second. even with extra health, bruce still needs to heal 2 times for every goblin! (4 bombs thrown each)   Also, I'm glad virandra got a buff, it was just a bow with super knockback, now it oneshots everything. good job old man's wife."
DvZ,3cely3,TheDrCreeps,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:55:36 2015 UTC,Bruce doesn't have to heal once every second tbh. As long as he doesn't run into every goblin boom box intentionally they won't be a problem. It's also 3 or 4 arrow shots before the auto heal kicks in for Bruce even with withers which will not happen that quickly.
DvZ,3cely3,jujug28,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:26:00 2015 UTC,"well, the thing is, that is when he isn't at the shrine. when he is, he will get hit by everything, as he is trying to protect it. gobos spaming boxes and Kabooms. withers and zombies targeting bruce because he is a hero, will bring his mana down quick. and using more mana on top of that? that will get him dead quick."
DvZ,3cely3,TheDrCreeps,3,Tue Jul 7 12:22:36 2015 UTC,I just played Bruce and I felt he was still crazy powerful. He doesn't need armor repair and virendra one shots almost everything!
DvZ,3cely3,josh__ab,3,Tue Jul 7 09:12:46 2015 UTC,"I like it. Before, it was pointless for the monsters to even ""try"" and fight Bruce, it got to a point in a few games where myself and others just tried avoiding him the whole time, it made things less fun :/ But now, there's actually hope of possibly killing him, and he's still the greatest Dwarf warrior of all time :D"
DvZ,3cely3,Duffman295,2,Tue Jul 7 09:57:44 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why every Bruce I've seen is bleeding so often.  Not too sure how I feel about it. The image I have of Bruce is an unstoppable juggernaut capable of holding a hallway by himself, but now he's significantly more mortal than before.   I guess seeing millions of Dwarves die over and over again in countless realities has finally taken its toll on him."
DvZ,3cely3,AmbitiousHobo,2,Tue Jul 7 09:03:31 2015 UTC,"Ahhh this makes more sense. Yesterday, I was Bruce and was wondering why i was skirting such low mana. It made it so that I needed to hide and use my bow instead of fighting on the ground on the final so that i could still horn for the rest of the jimmies. I still think rob is tweaking this so this is probably not in its final state, though."
DvZ,3cely3,yellowleopard,2,Tue Jul 7 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"While I do believe that heros need to be able to be killed since right now I'm just like oh hero walk around them and ignore don't waste time targeting them since its pointless to do so.  Since I'm yet to get bruce in the update. #Niso4Life Can't really talk about how I think this would impact gameplay. However I have noticed more red sparkly bruce's and other bruces just fleeing to final or trying to stay as far back as possible instead of charging in and fighting. I believe this is an offshoot from the mana problem, red sparkles means death I think any new player knows this either from videos, old streams or pretty much almost any other western made game out there. Red = death Green= good. So when they see red they start to run thinking I'm a hero I can't die, Fall back and wait no more fighting till better.   Just dont change niso health stuff. Remember kids.

He's actually not that scary to play as I thought It was, the buffed Virendra really helps when you're in a dangerous spot.  The healing itself is also still consistent. If you play it smart you can keep on healing with the 200 mana cost, you'll be stuck between 200 and 0 mana, but it's not that big of a deal if you know what you're doing."

DvZ,3cedo4,jerMMM1,8,Tue Jul 7 06:50:10 2015 UTC,"I think the suicide at least might need a nerf, but I'm not sure it's entirely necessary, since game lengths are at a really good time right now.  And going to the normal armor shred, the armor shred coming from zombies are all from players, and you only do 25 per hit once you've fully upgraded, which is LATER during the game which is fine, that's how the zombies progress. As for golems, yea, they're doing their job. Are they scary? Good because they're supposed to be.  Wither skeletons need to be VERY good shots to land to shred armor, a lot of the time, AI and players will constantly get in the way of your shots so it's not like it's easy, it's difficult.   As for the armor it is your job to keep your eye on it and fall back before you get caught out and die. That's sort of on you if that happens.  The armor shred really only gets worse as the game progresses, the dwarves die, the zombies grow stronger in numbers and upgrades, to the point where they just overpower the dwarves, and really, that's fine because that's how the game should go.   Again things might need some tweakin, but it feels good to me right now."

Considering you can be fully upgraded at the end of the first night (or mid day if you don't push for mana) if you get the plague you get to do a lot of armor damage early game, and even if you are not fully upgraded you can maxout the armor shred really fast (which is what I usually do now), it would be a late game upgrade like you said if you were not able to get the upgrade as fast, I personally think that the armor shared should be available after you maxed out the attack upgrades so you can't get it instantly."

DvZ,3cedo4,_TheEtanMan_,9,Wed Jul 8 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I got a dozen games under my belt last weekend so I can refute this stuff.  I haven't experienced any problems with Goblin bombs yet and you can interrupt Kaboom. I doubt it's the damage that would need to be nerfed and just the radius if it is a problem, but I don't believe it is one yet.  Armor shred is fine. You can one shot player zombies with the proc, if they couldn't melt your armor, they would be insanely useless. Also your math is just you guessing. You can hit a dwarf 3 times per second which means you melt 7.5% armor per second. This means a fully upgraded zombies needs to hit you non stop without any interruption or things getting in the way for 14 seconds to shred through all of your armor. Do you die when you run out of armor? No, you still have a big pool of mana to go through. I can kill newbie Jimmies as a solo Zombie, but it takes a LONG TIME as between the knocking around and running around you can do in minecraft, this 14 second fight can easily stretch into a minute and all my progress is easily countered by a single wrench and involves multiple rebirths as a fully upgraded zombie.  Ogres don't have bonus armor shred. They really only kill you in combination with other players. If Ogres are spawning, your positioning on where you fight them matters so much more. The only change I might do is reduce how many spawn at once. Tap them with a dagger early, fight them in safe places they can't knock you trouble, or request hero support."

This means a fully upgraded zombies needs to hit you non stop without any interruption or things getting in the way for 14 seconds to shred through all of your armor.   According to the info on the Armor Shred upgrade for zombies, you do 3% armor shred per hit when fully upgraded. If as a zombie I hit someone once and then die, my armor damage report says I did 30 armor damage. It's the base 5 and +25 from the upgrades.  Which for your calculation means that under ideal circumstances you can do 9% armor damage per second, so a full armor set in 11 seconds."

DvZ,3cedo4,ArchasTL,3,Tue Jul 7 08:46:45 2015 UTC,Yup! People underestimate the power of the dagger against special mobs. One tap and a bit of time kills everything. Even more crucial when there are no heroes.
DvZ,3cedo4,ArchasTL,2,Tue Jul 7 09:04:45 2015 UTC,I can only agree on the ogres and partly on gobo. Armor shred seems fine. As other people have mentioned its what makes zombies fun and lowering that will make being a zombie uneventful and boring( I love separating a jimmy from the rest and messing up their armor so that a fellow gobo can blast him and insta-kill him. Gobos seem very balanced to me on low amounts but I just finished a Bruce game where half the mobs were Goblins. That's when it gets kinda crazy with all the boom boxes and creeper blasts  so I kinda wish they had one less boom box or maybe make it so that if you throw your boxes there is a cooldown before you can self-destruct. As for ogres  believe I killed around 10 jimmies as an ogre in about 5 games yesterday. With the bow resistance they seem kinda unkillable to the normal jmmies. Maybe make bows slightly more effective????  Anyway why I think those don't need a big nerf is because teamwork can counter all three subjects. There are always jimmies on repair duty back on the shrine and a fellow dwarf getting harassed by an ogre is always top priority for me.
DvZ,3cedo4,johnnjlee,2,Tue Jul 7 12:30:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, mobs like ogres are what the heroes are designed to dispatch. If you are a hero, your priority should be to kill the mobs that Jimmy is going to have trouble with, like ogres, pirates, and golems. Jimmy should avoid them if he can, while heroes should make them priority number 1. Simple teamwork, my friends.  As far as ogres themselves go, I do think they need a slight nerf. Jimmy does have a fairly effective answer to ogres with the Elven Dagger, especially now that holding the Dagger provides an 80% chance every hit to entirely ignore knockback. However, players with runeblades or warhammers are pretty vulnerable to ogre gang-bangs. I think a good way to nerf ogres while still allowing them to pose a dangerous threat is to lower their arrow resistance from 95% to 50% (or maybe even lower). That way, archers (longbowmen in particular) can dispatch the brutes with much more relative safety, and Jimmy is no longer in immediate danger if no heroes are around, but ogres remain powerful if they can dodge shots or avoid the rangers.  I won't comment on goblins or armor shred, because it's fairly obvious both are OP, but that's a matter of tweaking variables to balance them. Neither need their mechanics changed, just some numbers moved around.  Also, I'm surprised you didn't mention Fury of the Night as something that's hilariously powerful. If anything, that should be looked at before ogres or goblins."

You still can solo a golem now, just have to think about it more and hope no other mobs start focusing on you as well.  Goblins are an artillery unit. Outside of their bombs they are pretty close to worthless in a fight. When all 8 bombs are used up, you'll have to wait a fair bit to be able to throw one again. If in this time the dwarves are just leaving you, well kinda their choice 90% of the time. Goblins are a unit that when you have no armour you need to be aware of. With armour they are a nuisence, without armour they are deadly.    Armour shred as a whole yeah it does feel kinda high but numbers can be tweaked but not a case of straight to the ground with you.  Ogres are a disruption unit. Yes their arrow resistance can be reduced a lil bit say to 70%, but they don't need much changing if any. They are a big heavy tank designed to disrupt dwarven lines. Yes in tight spaces they can be dangerous indirectly, however this is more of a case of their disruption ability. Top tip here is jump move into their hits, you'll get out of the corner a lot faster and easier once you figure out how knockback works with minecraft jumping/airtime mechanics."
DvZ,3cedo4,Doom_BringerMC,2,Tue Jul 7 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yeeeeaaahhhh. I like the length of game time. If he nerfed the monsters then the games would be even longer. No one really wants that. Well, at least I don't want that. Some people may want short games while others like longer. It also depends on who dies, like if a bunch of Noob Jimmies die off first, then the game will take a bit longer. If the older Jimmies die first, then the game will be pretty short. It really depends on skill level."
DvZ,3cedo4,zzCratoszz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"So that's a grand total of 30 hearts on one gobo life.   And? Zombies and Skeletons can do an infinite amount of hearts in one life and you don't think they need to be nerfed? And since this version of DvZ isn't orientated around mobs getting kills it's irrelevant which mob kills the most players.     While armour shred is a bit strong at the moment, I think if you start lowering the values all it will really do is make playing Mob more boring. If you don't like having to repair a lot, run a build with Runeblessed, or have a build that allows for more wrenches to accommodate it.     I feel like people seem to greatly exaggerate how strong Ogres are. They're annoying. That's it. They have only the basic level of armour shred, the only buff to their mobility is having KB Resistance, whilst they have a high attack damage they have no health regain options nor affects on your mana. It'd take an Ogre quite a long time to wear through all your mana/armour, plus there's the added benefit of them knocking you out of their attack range every time they hit you. Ogres only real use is to push you into a difficult position which is either away from the shrine or into a hole or a corner, both of which you can get out of with the help of AI's. The most reliable way to deal with an ogre at the moment for non-Heroes is the Elven dagger; it has high attack damage and it slowly eats through their health. Whilst it'd be nice if there was another means of dealing with them it's one of the few uses for the Dagger. And if you took away some of the few things going or the Ogre (Proc resist, arrow resist, bonus health) then they won't be of much use either. Compare them to something like the Wolves; wolves do massive armour damage they can mana steal at night, they can recover health, they have a bonus row of hearts and they can leap great distances. They are very strong and if you're alone with no means to deal with it they can absolutely kill you. But they can be proced, and easily killed with a bow. An ogre is no-where near as damaging as a wolf, it's not going to kill you unless you're already low and whilst it's good at isolating you, it's unlikely to be able to kill you anytime soon by itself."
DvZ,3cedo4,Doom_BringerMC,7,Tue Jul 7 08:46:40 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am aware everything about the game could change still. I really wouldn't mind at least 1 proper way to deal with ogres other than just ignoring them. What is there weakness right now? They spawn with a lot of health, can't be proced, some arrow resist, and huge knock back weapons.  All you need to do is find something to corner jimmy with and hold him there for the wolves to kill. You just watch and every time they make a break for it push them back into the corner. If bruce couldn't proc ogres I'd probably kill him with this method too. This is if I am by my self as well. If I party up we just push jimmy away from the front lines never to be seen again."
DvZ,3cedo4,zzCratoszz,3,Tue Jul 7 11:21:25 2015 UTC,"The Elven Dagger. Its buffs are practically designed to counter Ogres. And you proved my point, Ogres are nothing but annoying unless there is another mob to work in tandem with them. A lone Ogre isn't even a threat. It's not the Ogre that's over-powered it's teamwork."
DvZ,3cedo4,Rurikar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, yes, if you give it enough time the Elven Dagger is probably a counter. If I have any beef with them though, its that there is no way to fight them other than trying to poison them and running away. And to be honest I think they are stronger than the ogre mage right now since he can be proced by jimmy. Also AI zombies would do the same thing as player monsters when the gold runs out or they have no wrenches."
DvZ,3cedo4,zzCratoszz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:54:41 2015 UTC,"You just tank the damage and keep hitting them until either they flee or they die if you're without the dagger. AI zombies drain armour way to slowly, they'd get a proc before that'd happen."
DvZ,3cedo4,TheFlightlessEagle,2,Tue Jul 7 20:00:23 2015 UTC,"But smart ogres don't play the dwarves game. They choose when to fight by only hitting you when you try and run. To be honest, if it was ever just 1 or a few ogres spawning. I don't think many people would care. Normally you have about ~15 of these things coming at you all at once. If you are not a vet and get cut off, especially after a shrine falls. The monsters are going to have their way with you. And they can forcefully cut you off with their knock back.  I'm not saying they are stupidly over powered here. I'm saying there is no way to really deal with them. And they get to control the flow of the fight. Where normally the dwarves do that unless its some kinda boss mob.   I assume what happened here is rob hasn't balanced them yet and went with making them too strong over making them too weak so they have a good first impression"
DvZ,3cedo4,Doom_BringerMC,2,Tue Jul 7 20:36:17 2015 UTC,They choose when to fight by only hitting you when you try and run.   Hence why Elven Dagger is a counter.
DvZ,3cedo4,Jhojji,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:10:08 2015 UTC,Most of this isn't necessarily me complaining but trying to defend my side of the argument fully.   I think they are generally fine. Besides Maybe so many spawning all at once. I mostly find them problematic when either a shrine falls. Which can be solved by just leaving the shrine early. Or final where that isn't possible. 1v1 yea the dwarve is going to win. Its when 5+ of them are beating you into a corner and you have no way of killing them all or getting away. Add in jimmy tunnels or monster teamwork and even vets are having trouble here.   Basically towards the later half of the game they get really powerful. but in the first half they are almost a joke. I don't envy anyone who needs to do game balance.
DvZ,3cedo4,NikoUY,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think there should just be less spawning, not nerfing them. I think one or the other needs to happen, because not everyone can have an elven dagger. So nerfing them or reducing their numbers would even it out a bit."
DvZ,3cedo4,johnnjlee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:48:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but all the gobos need to do to deal that damage is click 5 times. I've died mid-game, became a gobo, upgraded blast radius and amount carried, went to the shrine, clicked a couple of times and boom: 2 kills. Other mobs you actually have to think about what your doing."
DvZ,3cedo4,mineman00567,3,Tue Jul 7 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"Again. This version of DvZ isn't about killing. Those players wouldn't die if they weren't already in a position to do so. The thrown bombs are easily avoidable, if you're using Jimmy Juice then they're not going to kill you unless you've run out of mana. A single Goblin cannot do that in 5 clicks as you put it. If you're not using Jimmy Juice then it's no different to how Creepers were; you listen for the sound cues and heal when necessary. If you hear the ""KAAAAAAA-"" then you know to be at or near full health to take the explosion, or better still interrupt the goblin from exploding. The thrown explosives have two sound cues as well as being very obvious flashing green boxes, if you are aware of them you can heal or better still move away from them. If you can't heal to take the explosions then you were going to die anyway. Goblins are far from over-powered, and yes, they take very little skill to do a lot of damage, it also takes very little skill to avoid that damage as you can literally just walk away from the explosions."
DvZ,3cedo4,ArchasTL,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the 1 hit per half second thing may be the maximum possible... But players won't be able to click that fast normally. As well as the fact dwarves move, so you won't hit them every time, there's also the fact that your hits will be blocked by ais and other things WILL interfere.... Statistics are all well and good, but things should only be nerfed once the developer experiences it fully."
DvZ,3cedo4,johnnjlee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:00:18 2015 UTC,"players won't be able to click at 1 per .5 seconds? LOL! And I was comparing it with 1 zombie. Yeah it's not gonna be constant but in a game, but there's a lot more monsters in a game that are spread all over the place. And if you get knockback by 1 monster, you can just get knocked into another one. In my experience anyways."
DvZ,3cedo4,Tripleat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"Before someone says ""Is not finished yet"" or something like that I'm aware of that but I still want to give my opinion of what I think needs to be changed/tweaked, I'm not complaining, I'm just giving an opinion.  The only problem I have with Goblins right now is the fact that bombs do armor damage, I have been in situations where I can't disable half of the boom boxes and I lose 1/4 to 1/2 of my armor in a really small amount of time which is a lot considering your armor is probably already damaged, honestly the stationary bombs should do very little damage to the armor or just do no damage, also the throwable bombs are kinda a problem, the bombs are generally hard to see or you can't get out of the way fast enough which dosen't feel fair at all and you can lose a lot of durability really fast because of that, a posible solution for that is to scale the armor damage depending how close you are from the explosion instead of doing a fixed amount of armor damage.  I don't really have a problem with Skeletons doing a lot of armor damage because is hard to hit Dwarves with bows but I do think that Zombies/Wolf should do less armor damage, one of the appeals of the game (at least for me) is that unlike other games you can survive and fight for a really long time either in a group like it was before or alone like it was recently and having to retreat every 30-60 seconds mid/late game kinda takes away from that and moves the fight to the shrines, honestly I would prefer if the cost for repairing was greatly increased but the armor lasted at least 2 to 3 minutes mid/late game (Wrenches probably need to be nerfed which is ok) unless you are fighting a skeleton in an open space or you are bing hit by a Golem (Golems are mostly fine now, maybe a little tweak here or there). Ogres could have a little less health, I feel like you should be able to kill them if you are constantly hiting them for 20 seconds with a sword, maybe giving a strength buff if you have a proc so you do more damage to Ogres might be a good idea if you don't want to reduce their health so they still can be tanky."
DvZ,3cedo4,PickShark,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:23:10 2015 UTC,That strength buff is not a bad idea at all
DvZ,3cedo4,Cronurd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:41:40 2015 UTC,"I'm actually getting quite tired of people complaining about how ""OP"" ogres are. You complain because it's the 1 mob that you can't easily kill, the one that you can't take on alone. Ogres are meant to be tanks, that don't deal too much damage or armor shred. In a 1v1 situation, it takes ages to kill the ogre (Trust me I've tried it). Teaming up on them is a much more effective strategy, in which they can die in a short amount of time. I think that ogres are perfectly fine as of now, and should remain how they are. They really do 't get that many kills so I don't know why people complain, If Nisovin or Rob pulled out some kill stats, ogres wouldn't be near the top.   Currently, game lengths are perfect in my opinion. There are hardly any games that drag on for over an hour, but there aren't extremelly short games. You guys get obsessed with picking out every small detail about a certain mob that you want to be nerfed, when in reality, they aren't having a huge impact on the game."
DvZ,3cedo4,TheFlightlessEagle,5,Tue Jul 7 14:29:51 2015 UTC,"I think the problem people have with ogres is not their bulk, nor their damage output. The issue lies with ogres being able to force Jimmy into a horrible position with very little effort, and Jimmy has almost no influence on where he goes. I've never particularly liked mechanics in games that take movement choice away from the player, and while I think ogres are manageable in DvZ, I can understand why many players dislike them. I think they do need a nerf, but just a slight one, like reducing arrow resistance so archers become near-counters to them."

Rob and Nisovin are still tweaking the game, and even the experienced players don't really know what the best defences are in this version of the game yet.  We do know some of the things that don't work (mazes, for example, will still trap and kill dwarves and are a bad idea, putting roofs on tunnels will still degrade quickly, tripping up retreating dwarves and glitching them into blocks) and we can explain to the new folk these things at least while working out what does work.  Truly crazy stuff can just be ignored - if some wee Jimmy decides to pillar up and build a skybase, well, he'll regret it when the KB skellies take the floor out from under him and he falls to his doom. Though it'd still be polite to point that out to him, so he knows what went wrong!"

Don't get me wrong, as a veteran player it can be infuriating to get blocked off, see a 90 high 1 thick cobble wall etc.  But they're new players and are in the process of learning. We've had too long of expert players building expert defences in the previous edition. Eventually new players will gain experience of what works and what does not, as well as friendly advice from players with more games under their belt.  For now, just enjoy the time where the Jimmy's can Jimmy freely and we get a nice and weird variety of structures spawned from madness and ignorance."

DvZ,3cdw4r,johnb43,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's silly to assume old tactics work well against new monsters. Proc tunnels aren't just as useful as they use to be as it's very easy for goblins to melt them if you aren't defending entrance to them.  You are better off having a very thick wall 5 blocks with a small tunnel to make it easy to focus down AIs once you have a proc and the rest of the time stand in front of it defending gobos and using glue if a kaboom gets through. Slabs are great for building these when defenses aren't prebuilt and you can basically do them in middle of combat. Building at proper corners that will limit Skeleton line of sight also is starting to feel really important.  So no, I don't think we should be teaching jimmies the old style proc tunnels just yet. A lot of experimenting needs to happen before there is a good consistent way to deal with new threats."
DvZ,3cdw4r,Rurikar,2,Wed Jul 8 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Gobos, mob events and ogres have really thrown old tactics for a loop.

I believe he was also looking for an admin so if you're interested in that I'd suggest messaging him about that on the wiki/reddit.

DvZ,3cdw4r,Gr33nfield,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:57:34 2015 UTC,"A thought crossed my mind and that is for people to play more following the RP side of their chosen class, as well having a better balance across classes. Each of them have unique tools to help in their own way. I think covering this stuff in that way would be helpful to the community. Not focusing on how classes aid the specific player, but how they can work together to help the dwarves on the whole.  And perhaps for that need of the dwarves to split 20% 20% 60% across a three shrine map during the build phase. A lot of these maps are huge, and the smaller number of dwarves late game can't do any defending or fortifying if nothing was prep'ed earlier."
DvZ,3cdjp9,xythas,5,Tue Jul 7 01:58:40 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the basics:   Absolutely everything has to be made out of bedrock. This is to ensure that if everything gets destroyed there is still a playable path. The time it takes to run from mob spawn to shrine/shrine to shrine should be between 20 to 30 seconds. This is so that when you play as a mob, you don't spend ages running to the shrine to just die immediately. As players tend to build defences between shrines anyway this time will more than likely increase so it's good to aim for that time frame. As a general rule of thumb, each shrine should be within 200 blocks of the next one. The staging of the map should suite the progression of DvZ. Initially there are lots of Dwarves, and very few monsters, so naturally you want larger areas with more open spaces so the Dwarves aren't over-powered. As the game progresses and the balance shifts you want progressively smaller spaces for the Dwarves to hold as there aren't as many of them to do it and a lot of monsters to counter them. Ideally you need to include Gravel, Gold, Wood and Oil. Gravel is best done as a quarry, with either all or most of the gravel below ground level or in a cave. The combination of falling blocks and magic spells from people digging gravel causes a lot of FPS drops on those with lower-end machines, by putting it out of view it goes a long way to help those players. In terms of quantities for Gravel, it really depends on the size of your map and how much you want players to build, keep in mind a lot of people just like to have several stacks in their inventory in case they need it on top of building so you're going to want a lot (20k+). Gold is a bit more flexible as with the new system in place, if your map is short on gold they can put starting gold in the vault or make your map have Gold Panner to make up for a lack of ore. Generally 2.5k - 3k ore is enough but the accessibility of that ore is important. Wood can come in the form of trees or just piles of lumber wood. Oil just needs to be relatively close to your lumber yard area for ease in making torches/mortar. Supplies are an important thing too, these are how you get all your tools and weapons. In the DvZ resource pack, the minecart tracks are retextured to be the Dwarven Tool set, ideally you should place these near where they are needed (so Axes by the wood, picks by the gold, shovels by the quarry...) as well as having a set near spawn. On top of that you want to supply Potions, Melee weapons and Ranged weapons, these are best place near where you want the spawn to be and in multiple places throughout the map so players can have access to them should they need them at any point. Your map needs to have a saw blade for cutting wood, and armour stations for forging armour. The saw blade is just iron bars and are best placed near the wood and oil, armour stations are Extended Pistons and they can go near the quarry. If your map transitions from Outside to inside it may pay to have two of each work station, one inside and one outside or at least later on in the map. You can have 2 - 4 shrines on a map, but keep in mind the staging of the map needs to change to accommodate this. Three shrine maps are the easiest to make and usually the most preferable as both 2 and 4 shrine maps have to be made differently to work well. If you really wanted to you could do more or less shrines than that but keep in mind it's not really what they're looking for in maps.      I may edit with more stuff or go into more detail later on if needs be."

DvZ,3cdjp9,TheFlightlessEagle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:53:40 2015 UTC,How would borders of the map work when building them?
DvZ,3cdjp9,TheFlightlessEagle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:29:00 2015 UTC,And also when actually creating the world what type of preset would you pick?
DvZ,3cdjp9,Doom_BringerMC,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're proficient in or what you're willing to learn to use. World Painter is an external program that is excellent for creating the terrain of the map. But World Painter requires some time to learn how to use it well enough for effective and realistic looking terrain. This would however solve the world preset issue and the border issue. If your main tool is World Edit or MCEdit then you can simply create a void world (with preset 0;0) and then start moulding the world and the terrain in either World Edit or MCEdit. The borders of a map are typically just a tall mountain range to contain players within the play area, beyond that though you want just pure void. Standard terrain generation would mean players could just leave the map and continuously load terrain."
DvZ,3cdjp9,TheFlightlessEagle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"I'm super sorry to hound you, but while using World Painter outside of my map is loading as either superflat or a regular world. I've selected the void a border but these keep showing up."
DvZ,3cdjp9,Doom_BringerMC,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:40:47 2015 UTC,If you go into Edit > Preferences you can set the default world options for each new map you create. These may not apply to an existing map but will for future ones. If you go to Default World Settings you can set the World Type to Superflat and the Custom preset to 0;0 like so.     For a save you've already created when you go to export you want: These settings for General (Again change the preset next to World Type to 0;0). Make sure to uncheck everything in the other tabs so it does generate underground caves and resources. Then just export as a new map and it should all work fine.

DvZ,3cec5b,HypothermicIce,10,Tue Jul 7 06:30:48 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to quantify something like this, because there's no way of telling if you're destroying something that actually matters to dwarves. There are plenty of places on most maps where you can break purely cosmetic walls and torches of no consequence to dwarves, which would fluff the number. For torches, it's only really attrition if the torch you break needs to be replaced by dwarves. For walls, if you mistime a kaboom and just blow a hole in the floor, there's no way to know how much this helps the monsters - if you blow up in a tunnel, often you're just clearing out fallen gravel which if anything aids the dwarves as it makes it easier to run.  Except for first shrines, shrine power drained is often a meaningless number because it's so easy for dwarves to bring the shrine power back up as soon as you die. Additionally with torches broken, you do get a number for this in the form of monster mana, which directly affects your personal progression.  I'd actually prefer if the way the armour damage is displayed to monsters could be changed. The message in chat feels like it's there as a response to the complaints about monsters during testing, when people didn't understand the new armour system, and it doesn't feel entirely polished. One possibility would be to round armour damage to multiples of 10, and then display it on a dummy item at the end of your hotbar (e.g. if you deal 50 armour damage, you have 5 items in that slot). That would also mean you can see how much damage you're dealing while you're alive. Of course there are numerous issues and limitations of that idea but there aren't many more places where information can be displayed in-game."
DvZ,3cec5b,Tomlough,2,Tue Jul 7 09:05:07 2015 UTC,But what would attrition points do? It just seems like some more unecessary numbers.
DvZ,3cec5b,Overhighlord,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:38:09 2015 UTC,"It would actively encourage monsters to focus on wearing down the dwarves' resources on all fronts, rather than their gold storage. It would give new players the feedback on a ""good monster life"" during their very first game, as they may not know everything you should do as a monster, like break torches. As the armor shred report stands, it only encourages new players to smack dwarves in their bearded faces."
DvZ,3cec5b,jerMMM1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:11:08 2015 UTC,They would tell you the all important fact that would previously be unknown to you: How good you did! You can't trust your own mind to tell you that that was a good monster life! Look at the numbers!!
DvZ,3cec5b,ArchasTL,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:57:19 2015 UTC,It would just be one number to replace the armor shred report you already recieve as a monster when you die
DvZ,3cec5b,figsandthings,2,Tue Jul 7 07:07:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like a similar system could work, where the dwarves have a certain ""attrition value"" that decreases as the monsters accomplish key objectives, like killing dwarves or destroying armor.  Wait, that's the gold counter.  You're basically advocating we replace one set of meaningless numbers on our screens with another set of similarly meaningless numbers. The current stage of DvZ makes it very easy to delineate progression, from dwarven deaths to shrines falling to gold depleting. Those are indication enough that the monsters are gaining momentum. On top of that, your goal is to promote objective-based gameplay that doesn't necessarily revolve around killing dwarves; the problem with that is every action one could take to gain these attrition points is something fundamental to monster gameplay. Breaking torches, busting walls, and the like are all self-evident functions in monster gameplay that only the newest of new players haven't grasped yet, meaning the purpose of this attrition system (to educate players on what to do to progress) is ineffective given that almost everyone already knows what to do on a basic level.  If I may be candid with you, I feel this proposal is a waste of time that addresses a non-existent problem in the wrong way."

Here's 2 quotes from Rob on Golems:   One Two    I just think it can be too easy to get a proc when at final or whatever.   Have you tried just getting a melee kill at final with the Greater Rune? Between Goblin explosions, Impact Skeletons and Ogres the amount you get thrown around makes focusing one mob in particular a huge challenge. More importantly have you tried being new at dvz and trying to do that? I've been playing well over a year and I struggle with starting a proc in final, (<3 Axe of Malice) for most new players the bow will be their only shot at a proc, and frankly if you nerfed Dragonskin I don't think anyone would use it.     And I really like your suggestion for a Monster event."

DvZ,3ccm9k,jujug28,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:59:24 2015 UTC,"Decreasing the chance on no hero games for golems would not help, only decrease the games with the problem. Possible solutions could include a single golem spawning at most. Two golems in a already small, heroless game is rough to handle. I was in a small game the other day with 4 golems because we couldn't kill the first wave and then a second wave spawned. The game ended in about 3 minutes after that.   About the dragonskin bows. I personally don't feel they need to be changed. If you make them non functional indoors they loose 90% of their usefulness. Procs are pretty trivial in the outside portions of the game compared to indoor parts."

DvZ is built on bukkit which is now dead and while Spigot is a decent replacement, there is a lot of stuff that doesn't work well.  I don't plan to completely overhaul the game again either so if minecraft adds features that would break DvZ, we will stop updating the game for future versions of minecraft."

DvZ,3c9cwb,keaganwill,6,Mon Jul 6 05:12:38 2015 UTC,"Completely subjective literary commentary incoming...  The way I look at it, it's a fine line between 'stirring speech' and 'verse'. It already has a structure that doesn't quite scan, so adding an impure rhyme helps prevent it from falling into bathos.   From a non-technical standpoint, it could also be said that the dwarves don't choose death so much as they choose to fight, knowing they'll probably die.   And from a purely boring, IRL standpoint: It's taken from the original DvZ trailer, ""Choose the Night"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMZA7Q1P2Q4  (Though if you really want chills, I recommend ""Death Fears Me"".

DvZ,3cacib,Quintos96,10,Mon Jul 6 10:09:25 2015 UTC,"Minecraft is notoriously badly-optimized, so don't worry that it's on your end. In terms of trying to get better fps, you could:     Install Optifine Decrease the render distance under video settings in the menu Change to fast graphics (video settings) Decrease the number of particles (again, under video settings)   I think playing with VBO's and mipmapping/antialiasing can also help with fps, but you'd have to ask someone else about that - a wee bit out of my league :P  Hope this helps!"
DvZ,3cacib,Thyrllann,3,Mon Jul 6 10:30:53 2015 UTC,Also a good idea to update java
DvZ,3cacib,keaganwill,6,Mon Jul 6 14:18:56 2015 UTC,"Minecraft is not the best optimized game that are out there. thats for sure, but there is a few things you can do to make it better! heres my list:    update java! the way you do this if by remving the old version that you have localy on you computer, then you install both the 32 and 64 bit verison of java.    Change your ""max framerate"". you do thing by: ESC - VIDEO SETINGS - under renderdistanse you will find the fps setting. i wouild set it to max. another option is 60 or 30 frames.  Turn VBO on. VBO should increase you fps with 5-10% more frames. if it doest work out for you then turn it off :p Particals! Dvz is really partical heavy. i would turn them either off, or all the way to minimal. reguardless of who you are and how good your computer is. Optifine! as many other have said; optifine really improves your frames. but be carefull with using it in singleplayer since it will mess up how things are loaded and how thing spawn.  give more ram to the client! by defualt the client get 1 GB. however it will use more then that and may even crash time to time. i would say atleast 2 GB but 3GB for optimal. how to add more RAM And how to check how my RAM you have   if you are having some network lagg there is a couple of things that you can do:    get a wire! running wireless can be really bad for gaming. since you add a couple of MS (Milliseconds) of delay thats unesearay. Get closer to you router! if you dont have the optinon to have a cable, then get closer to the thing! but cable is better.  if neither of those really work, i would recomend you to upgrade your network. doest have to be crazy but 5Mbit up and down is plenty to minecraft."

I thought the tool tip said the fps was lowered by setting a custom fps. Even if the fps was not reached."
DvZ,3cacib,zzCratoszz,3,Mon Jul 6 16:21:11 2015 UTC,"This is only if VSYNC is enabled, vsync will cap the fps at 30 or 60 fps to meet the refresh rate of most monitors.  If you disable vsync and set it to unlimited that'll be the max you can get. Although if you're only getting ~10fps this isn't really going to change anything for you since it seems like a performance issue."
DvZ,3cacib,goalie1248,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:55:14 2015 UTC,Do you have some source that says otherwise? I assume the game has to work harder when limiting fps when other wise it could ignore this work. Even if the difference is just 1 fps this is an attempt to min-max frame rate.
DvZ,3cacib,zzCratoszz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:56:18 2015 UTC,"Well that's the point of limiting your frames, to lessen the load on your GPU/CPU, there's no real point of getting 100+ frames if your monitor can only display 60 fps.    I assume the game has to work harder when limiting fps when other wise it could ignore this work.    Its not that your computer would have to work harder, what you described is when VSYNC is enabled, and you have a cap of something like 45 fps. Even if your computer has the ability to meet that 45 fps, it will only reach up to 30 fps in this case. That'd be the only performance hit that setting a custom fps could cause.   But again for this case, when they're only getting something like 10 fps, max fps calculation, VSYNC, doesn't really come into play because of how performance hindered it already is."

DvZ,3cacib,Tripleat,3,Mon Jul 6 10:29:26 2015 UTC,Just to clear things up. It sounds like you think your fps is low because your internet is bad. Your fps has nothing to do with your internet connection and is only limited by how good your computer is. If you are playing on pc go to windows and type in resource manager. That should tell you what the bottle neck is.
DvZ,3cacib,zzCratoszz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:37:21 2015 UTC,"yes ping and overall internet connections should not effect fps, but it might just make you move and do other actions weirdly. I dont think that resource manager would show you much, since it wont show you detailed information about graphics card. And if you allocate memory to be used by java, it should also always show that amount is being used."
DvZ,3cacib,Morvereth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"Resource manager will show you all you need to know. Where the bottle neck is, so you have something to go off of. If my disk speed is hitting 100% most of the time I know the bottle neck is there."
DvZ,3cacib,zzCratoszz,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"I do not what type of hardware you run, but I have a modest PC that had a lot of FPS issues with certain areas in Minecraft.  I discovered that I was running 32-bit Java by accident, and changing it to 64-bit more than doubled my FPS.  I can give you more details if you want to try this route, but I'd recommend at minimum to be running a 2 GB graphics card and running a 64-bit OS no matter what CPU configuration you are using."
DvZ,3cacib,Adnerp,2,Mon Jul 6 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"to clear up confusion, if this was internet lag, you would see players and mobs freezing commonly and then teleporting forward when they catch up with the server. If you have frame lag, it is almost garenteed your PC, the only way this would be the server's fault is if the server was creating to many mobs and particles and such for your client, which would still be your local computer problem.  I second what /u/Thyrllann said!"
DvZ,3cacib,Boe6Eod7Nty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"I would suggest doing what these people said. Make sure you have all programs other than minecraft closed (Web browsers etc.) then turn down your video settings as low as possible. Things like particles, smooth lighting and fancy textures should be turned all the way off. Put your render distance at 2 or the lowest settings. If you still don't get decent fps you might want to consider getting a gaming pc. It is worth the money in my opinion."

This tactic works, until the ogres and pirates come. The ability to easily get and roll a proc is no longer overpowered, if your attacker(s) are not affected by it. A good player zombie can stop you from bow proccing in the first place, by catching and tanking your arrows. And in a bow fight with a wither skelly, your base damage is low enough for the wither to heal through.  Not to say that the dragonskin bow is not useful or powerful. It definitely is better than the pre-update dwarven bows. But there are counters against it, and disadvantages in certain situations. So I would disagree that it's unbalanced or overpowered."

As for good zombies stoping you how when they are spawning AI zombies like dandruff and they get one shot at close range. As for withers just don't engage them till you proc and you wreck them.
DvZ,3c9vj9,Lex_L,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"How to play fetch with arrows as a zombie: get 15 health -> get 1 level of arrow resistance -> stand in front of jimmy while he is shooting. Make sure you stand in the direction of his bow, and make sure you're really close to jimmy. Like stand on his toes close. Jimmy's first shot will do 10 hearts of damage, but it will also activate the zombie arrow resistance buff. That means all next shots only do half a heart damage, which a zombie can heal through easily. Now just move along with jimmy and if he changes his shooting direction, change your position accordingly.   Proccing withers is one of the easier ways to kill them, but not all withers are kind enough to only engage jimmy while in melee range. And as a dwarf, you can't afford to ignore a wither that is too far away to be procced but still shooting you."
DvZ,3c9vj9,Rurikar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:00:09 2015 UTC,That is why I try to move as much as possible as a dwarf using this strat makes it harder for the Zoms to just tank and usually even if they manage something like you are talking about they slip up a lot and wither let me kill an AI or I kill them since I do switch to sword while the Bow is in cool down.
DvZ,3c9vj9,Gr33nfield,7,Wed Jul 8 00:16:48 2015 UTC,"The impact of this is that my average number of kills has doubled since figuring this out.   And? Kills don't matter. If you care about AI kills, just throw on a Warhammer build and Ta-Dah it's like having a perma proc for killing AIs.  A skeleton hitting a Jimmy is worth 20 hits from AI zombies (and that's just a base skeleton!), having a crossbow or longbow is so much more important for dealing with players who can deal so much more damage to your armor then AIs. Your stuck believing that the only important thing in current DvZ is getting as many kills as possibly, when the reality is that you need a mix to get longer games. You need players who can take out high priority targets and players who kill can efficiently deal with AIs.  When you play as BruceWillakers, you are near god mode. You can literally get into the thousands of kills and that's what new players will do, just farm AI zombies. The good bruces though will just run around dealing with high priority targets and jimmies who are stuck with hordes on them and can't get away. Kills just don't matter all that much."
DvZ,3c9vj9,Rurikar,4,Mon Jul 6 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  If you find yourself just standing in a corner killing zombie after zombie and essentially just clicking attack and heal over and over again please stop yourself and think about what you are doing.  Are you really having fun?  Or just feeding into the addictiveness that games can often bring you to.    Sure if feels good to get a kill.  Then you want more.  You get a little bit of gratification with each kill and so that subconcious part of your brain kicks in saying it wants more.    And as Rob stated.  It is real real easy to get kills.  But its such a basic for of gameplay.    I found myself in that state and realized I was really wasting my time.  There was no real gratification from just standing there farming zombies.  So instead I turned to role play (of which some players may wish I never did ;) ).    I also really analyzed the battlefield and realized ranger was my true calling.  I now find myself a little back from the front lines.  Often on the high walls so that I can analyze the battlefield.  I snipe those high priority skele targets and goblins.    If i see a jimmie in trouble and low on armor I dispatch his foes so he can pillar up and retreat.  If i see a wall in need of repairs I hop down and get to it.  If i see mobs that can use a little poisoining (wolves I cant hit, ogres etc) I jump down with my lightning fast speed and stick em all and then jump back up.  This is usually done when i'm low on arrows too.  Likewise there are so many other ways to play as well for a much more satisfying experience."
DvZ,3c9vj9,Sarkavonsy,3,Mon Jul 6 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, if you enjoy killing zombies by the hordes, that's cool too. It just isn't the end all be all of DvZ anymore. Bows have a real purpose as they deal with higher threats that hurt the dwarves more."
DvZ,3c9vj9,jujug28,2,Mon Jul 6 19:47:09 2015 UTC,True kills don't matter but it effects things that do matter. Such as game length a bunch of power gaming try hard Jimmies could cause the game to drag on for a while especially in the final shrine fight. It also could effect enjoyment of people playing monsters if a cornered Jimmy can just start a proc super easy taking away the fun of you and a bunch of buds cornering and focusing down a Jimmy together.  I am also worried about what it does to the berserker class. The big draw of the berserker is the proc on demand but this makes it so warrior also procs on demand and it does so faster (on average) and lets you roll procs.   Ultimately though I trust Rob to make an amazing game. I just didn't want him to be blindsided by something being OP and then deal with a bunch of butt hurt Jimmies When/If it  has to be nerfed (I have seen this a lot of times when a game dev patches something OP). If it doesn't get nerfed that's fine if it does that's also fine. Honestly with some work it could be turned into a fun OP that still preserves some balance if say the amount of arrows in the quiver for dragonskin is reduced or if Axe of Malice is buffed to compensate for  Dragonskin+Greater Runeblade encroaching on its turf.
DvZ,3c9vj9,Doom_BringerMC,3,Tue Jul 7 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"If there are enough zombies on you, you won't be able to reliably kill one with your bow, and you'll get overwhelmed and killed. If there aren't enough zombies, you will be able to kill one with your bow, and you'll survive. Seems fair to me."
DvZ,3c9vj9,TheDrCreeps,2,Mon Jul 6 06:45:01 2015 UTC,Not really considering AI zombies are one hit kills with the bow. It's kinda hard to miss. At worst you fire multiple times until you hit an AI.
DvZ,3c9vj9,TheDrCreeps,2,Mon Jul 6 12:21:23 2015 UTC,"The Warrior class in itself is designed for newer players. For a new player, in this update, I imagine getting a Proc by traditional means is a difficult thing to do and rolling it is even harder for them. Having the ability to just pull out their bow, fire blindly into a crowd and get a Proc from it is going to make it a lot easier for them especially with Jimmy Juice in tandem with it."
DvZ,3c9vj9,ArchasTL,2,Mon Jul 6 07:11:10 2015 UTC,"it's not op....  it uses the same amount of pts as the crossbow, and crossbow might be better to get procs in dire situation if used well. with 30 sec cooldown, and no guarantee to kill an AI or anything in the final shrine. If you think if an Item is OP or UP, think how it would perform in the most worse situations, then it balances itself out."
DvZ,3c9vj9,figsandthings,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:59:00 2015 UTC,I am thinking more along the lines of the default classes it is true a custom class could be engineered to be more powerful but this feels like a lot of power for the starter class
DvZ,3c9vj9,pjvm2000z,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"and starters can't use that power well, so they need some good items to get them into the game."
DvZ,3c9vj9,figsandthings,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:41:52 2015 UTC,I agree in principle but I am worried that this discourages experimentation with the other classes since it feels like a little too much power to early.
DvZ,3c9vj9,LordCluckles,2,Wed Jul 8 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, I don't really have much to say about the Dragonskin Bow that hasn't already been mentioned, but this particular quote kinda got me thinking.   Outside of RP and niche play style reasons there is no reason to play any other class.   I thought this too, at least initially. When the update was still in very early testing, I took a look at what the individual weapons and armor sets could do on paper, and concluded that players would reach a consensus on the ideal, ""optimal"" build. My thought was, like with almost ANY game where you can build a custom class (think World of Warcraft, Etrian Odyssey, and the Elder Scrolls titles), one or two dominant builds would emerge as the best, and no one would have any reason to use something otherwise. For example, back when the longbow amplification glitch was still present, it didn't make sense to NOT use a longbow because it was so ridiculously powerful.  But now? I don't think DvZ has a ""best build"". I think some equipment is better than others, like the post-buff Elven Dagger being better than the Warhammer, or Studded Runeleather being less effective in the armor shred meta, but unlike a lot of titles I could name, DvZ really doesn't have a single top-tier class. That's mostly because of playstyle (I prefer a sword to a bow, for example), but also because of the balancing. Dragonskin bows perform marvelously indoors, but longbows are so much better outdoors. Choosing a weapon is as much a designation of your role as it is a personal qualifier for your skillset: by choosing Dragonskin, you are voluntarily sacrificing your potential for outdoor archery for an advantage once the game moves into the keep.  One of the hallmarks of a well-designed game is to present scenarios where no one option is the clear winner. Every weapon in DvZ offers a potent advantage in a given area that no other weapon of its type can match, but you have to sacrifice power or utility in another area to do so. By that definition, there is no weapon that can definitively be called ""outclassed,"" so your premise that the Dragonskin bow inherently drives all other bow types to obsolescence is rather shortsighted of you.  There is no immutable Truth to be found in what weapon you choose. Pick what you like, develop a realistic assessment of its strengths and weaknesses, and understand that above all, a weapon is only as powerful as its user is skilled."
DvZ,3c9vj9,jerMMM1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"My only complaint about the dragonskin bow is that, as someone who doesn't use it, I sometimes feel outclassed by people who do. But I suppose that's more of a personal problem than anything!"

DvZ,3c82yq,jerMMM1,8,Sun Jul 5 19:54:34 2015 UTC,I think that second idea would just benefit regular players that play 1-3 games per day anyway. Extra gold was intended to players that dont have time or interest to play every day. So that they can still try prebuild classes and enjoy games. If you play 1 game per day you should gain enough gold for all basic classes and one custom build in less than 60 days anyway with current gold income rate.
DvZ,3c82yq,Morvereth,3,Sun Jul 5 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"Anytime you suggest any gold ""ideas"" I have to explain that you won't get MORE gold from it.  Your first idea promotes AFKing constantly in the lobby. Not going to happen.  Your second idea would make people try to delay games for gold reasons which is bad for the health and would not net you more gold. It would be balanced so you just end up getting 4500/7 bonus gold but now force players to play every day. I also don't want to ""force"" people to play daily, I don't like daily quests in games.  Once a week is so much more appropriate even the most casual of player can participate with a once a week quest."
DvZ,3c82yq,Rurikar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"What I meant by ""wait in the lobby for the game to start"" was meaning the lobby that you get after you click to join a game. I couldn't find any other way to word it so that was confusing. And there's a maximum amount of 50.  The second one isn't going to force people to play every day that only can play a game every week. Your still going to get around 4000 gold per week and the numbers can always be changed. And the whole 50% thing was is mistake, but you can have it be 500 gold for the first game you play each day."
DvZ,3c82yq,macd4066,5,Tue Jul 7 05:58:15 2015 UTC,all I want for the gold gaining system is for the gold earned during the game not to reset if you dc and reconnect. my terrible internet connection is resulting in me getting a very low amount of gold per game.

DvZ,3c8jpl,Morvereth,8,Sun Jul 5 22:18:13 2015 UTC,Generally I think more tones of grey would go a long way to help the DvZ resource pack.

I think the transition from pure white to every dirtier shades of grey would be kinda cool.   In addition more contrast within the colour spectrum and white symbolises things that are new and pure. Plus easier to see dwarves on the wall.
DvZ,3c8jpl,Tebotron,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:42:34 2015 UTC,yeah something like spectrum from light grey to dark might work. So that dark is like burned down stone that its almost gone.

DvZ,3c8jpl,MX26,2,Mon Jul 6 03:13:14 2015 UTC,I like the idea of using golden mortar on darker bricks. I think that would fit the idea you were going for while also making it very easy to pick out what blocks are reinforced and which aren't. It also would go with the golden theme DvZ has been moving toward

DvZ,3c5sl8,Kylesmomabigfatbtch,9,Sun Jul 5 02:17:26 2015 UTC,"I don't want to force people to play certain ways to maximize gold gain. If we were going to do systems like this, it wouldn't be ON TOP of current gold, it would be instead of.  You need 100k gold to start building your own kit fully and after that it gets easier and easier as you buy more things and have more options to play around with.  That means you need 8300 minutes of playtime or 140 hours. That sounds like a lot, but every week you do your weekly you get about 5.5 hours worth of gold. If you played 1 game a week for the next 3 months, you would make 56640 gold alone.   Right now Kits might feel so far off, but their not. We plan to have bonus weekends and such too for more gold, but right now we are happy with people just playing classes as really players shouldn't start messing with kits until they really have explored all the classes and gotten a handle on the game. If you had a lot of hours of DvZ before this update, you probably already have a head start on unlocking things."
DvZ,3c5sl8,Rurikar,3,Sun Jul 5 07:01:42 2015 UTC,"This might be a silly question and I think I know the answer from how you phrased your post, but better to ask, probably:  What is the weekly quest? Is it literally just ""play 1 game this week"", or is there anything more specific about it? For example, is it 'this week' as far as the actual calender, or player specific, or server specific?  (I ask such an odd question because I tend to 'miss' my weekly quests on Hypixel's Warlords, since their weekly things have to be finished on a Thursday night, which a) is a bit weird and b) badly timed in the week for me personally.)"

If you have the Crossbow you're not penalized by proximity and can fire more rapidly but it only does 10 hearts and you're heavily limited on arrows. Compare that to the Dragonskin which does the same damage as a standard bow with the benefit of a proc every 30 seconds on kill, but it's affected by normal minecraft drawback mechanics and penalized at close range. Some items you don't necessarily need to nerf as the item in itself is giving you limitations by not possessing one of the other items. By having a dragonskin I can't shoot things at close range, by having a crossbow I can't proc off arrow kills. You're item gives a volley shot that rather than killing things debuffs them, by using it I can't proc off arrow kills, or necessarily even kill things at range, but I can slow or weaken a horde of monsters for the benefit of my teammates."

Gold is very important to overall balance of how long games are and this effectively means that games could last up to 2.5x longer.    Shoveolium Graveolium   The ability to place walls like that would be insanely annoying as well because it's EZ fix slabs you can spam.   Crystal of Repair   Long range repair is super niche, but could function as one of those unusual side perks.   Crafters Knockoff JimmyJuice    A juice that gives random buffs is neat, but I think it be better off as a Proc type of thing. The problem is really, their just aren't a lot of useful buffs in minecraft so I would need to create a lot of them.   Forgemasters Banner Would be annoying for both dwarves and monsters and I see almost zero strategy in this item, players would just use it as a more annoying ez-fix slab walls and the debuff wouldn't be that big of a deal for monsters. Spawning real things into the world is a super dangerous road to go down.  Crafters Burden    A volley bow isn't something I think I'll give dwarves because monsters already have it.

I personally doubt we would see this as a mandatory item especially with the same loadout point cost of a weapon(or higher). I can see most would have to forgo their weapon in order to get this or this, a proc weapon and maybe a juice and nothing else.   I really can't see many choosing this option as a mandatory thing since it means they are getting it to use it and not be as heavy a fighter.  I do however feel that some sort of alternate even single use repair item along that line would be a potentially good thing. Yeah single use item as the repair function would be good. The risk involved would mean it'll either be used up by to early by those not wanting to risk their life or at the end and the dwarf that used it is gonna die from it, High risk, high team reward, no personal reward. Most people think more about their personal self and survival in this game and well most games, rather than being willing to just sacrifice their life to help out the team.

The repair crystal is alright too, but it seems a bit gimmicky - if you need to repair a wall, most of the time you can just run over and slap mortar on it. Maybe if it used several mortars, but made blue stone?   The Forge Banner is a really, really cool idea. I imagine it would function as a sort of mini-shrine; when there are monsters around it - and no dwarves - it destroys itself. Alternatively, it could be broken by destroying the block below it - since it's a blue stone block, that would be difficult to do in the thick of battle. Maybe it could give xp to the monster that breaks it?  My only worry is that it might distract dwarves from defending the shrine proper - similar to the old ""cake shrines"" or this new cottage thing.  The Crafter's Burden, though, seems pretty much useless. Suppose, best case scenario, you manage to hit 20 different zombies and slow them all. All that would change is you'd be getting charged by the zombies you didn't hit. Further, people could grief and annoy fellow dwarves without any possibility of getting caught. I'd remove the dwarf debuff and make it so the arrows, say, apply elven dagger poison instead? That would make it worth the cost, and fit the theme of support items much better.  Uh, er, I mean. Damn crafters! Hail Deadbones! ...yeah."
DvZ,3c4u86,Doom_BringerMC,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"Personally not a fan of the poison mechanic in MC. Would be to0 powerful on a volley attack.  Poison stops Gobo booms, intereferes with jumping and moving so spider super movement be down. Golems can also suffer a lil bit since they have to jump to move and if jumping as poison tic the move forward stops .  A slow debuff on hordes is good for setting up procs runs for ithers, stopping that annoying spiderling, goblin, skelly from escaping from a dwarf and also helping people retreat or escape from mobs. Think of it as not a direct damage but a set up for others to get in position or escape.  I personally viewed the forge banner as the actual effect giving being a banner so either being blown up by goblins (eg three or four kabooms well render it dead, a banner placed on a block that gets broke dies as well) or broken normally. Given its a buyable items I personally doubt it'll be a cake shrine or boat or gravel pit or house for anyone other than those that currently do that. Really people that want to defend another objective already do so as it is. Never be able to stop it, so why worry about it.

I think that every themed ability or class should at least be useful in a fight."
DvZ,3c4u86,Overhighlord,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:30:43 2015 UTC,Question: Do you believe supporting dwarves does not help in the fight? Dwarves focused upon building and maintaining the keep. Dwarves that can drop buffs/debuffs. Dwarves that can repair.  The Pick and shovel in this idea also serve as weapons (hence their cost) with the shovel having the same base damage as the runeblade and pick 1 less. The bow is an alternate bow for the more support orientated ranger with a cost to benefit in how you can slow and damage a mass of monster but bad aim and you might give another dwarf a very short (1second) debuff in slow or blindness).

DvZ,3c4u86,Rosalen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:09:18 2015 UTC,In which case why even have a building phase and not just have prebuilt keeps and give every dwarf back the runeblade? It appears you highly underestimate the capability of dwarves that actually know how to support others.  Proc givers instead of proc takers. Roamin giving a proc to 5 dwarves withhis flames instead of taking it for himself server much better. New niso with the ability to wormhole and tinder on demand to set up kills and protect other dwarves. Sure can just wormhole and tinder or proc them myself or set it up for bruce or dwarves trying to retreat.   It also appears you have not actually read any of these ideas. Only one of these is only simply sitting back and clicking. The Crystal of Repair and maybe the building aid the shovel has. All the others are only effective when with other dwarves and fighting alongside them. So please actually now read these ideas instead of commenting without having read them.
DvZ,3c4u86,winter477,2,Sat Jul 4 20:47:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah,I guess support isn't entirely abysmal but still, these abilities don't seem that useful, you'd have to spend even more time on the build phase on just gathering stuff as these suck up alot of points that could be used on making your guy more powerful or with consumables without a small fancy novelty. Also I meant no offense to you and I did read your ideas, I'm just stating on how I don't really think that they're that useful."
DvZ,3c4u86,redtps,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:52:40 2015 UTC,"On the shovel:  +50% mining speed boost on gravel, + 50% increased cobble drop.   Increases the speed and rate of gathering cobble, thereby reducing the time needed to gather cobble and increasing the time on building up stronger thicker fortifications. Add in the base damage of a rune blade just without a proc and it serves a suitable weapon.  The Pick, increases gold drops. Gold is the only thing right now that leads to death. No gold, no repair, no armour death. Increasing the gold increases the time you can last as a whole as a team. It serves as a weapon at 1 damage less than the runeblade. With the potential for anyone who is at a shrine with defenders without any gold left over providing a risky but easily game turning repair. How often since the update have you got to the final shrine with like 10+ dwarves only for the gold to run out and then watch them fall. This gives that mass repair to those dwarves at what most likely in that situation is the dwarves death unless they are immensely skilled since they don't get the heal.   The alternative juice acts as a buff giver during fights to help turnback the monsters. Not reliable on giving the right one much like how Niso used to be, but imagine getting that strength buff from a fellow dwarf even for a few seconds. Get that proc going easier, clear the shrine or wall. Only way you can get this is if that dwarf is fighting alongside you.  The banner, think of it being able to potentially let choke points be used again now on maps or being placed strategically along the wall to create a stronger defense. Right now whats the point of proc halls, they last a minute maybe two once the goblins get into sync with their bombs and nothing is going to stop those goblins just melting them down to nothing. So how can we make chokepoints useful beyond a Bruce horn? A mini ""shrine"" that gives weakness to monsters letting you utilise choke points again.  Crafters Burden, as a volley crossbow, with reduced damage but debuff instead on monsters. Volley of arrows that give mobs a slowness debuff. Think you and any melee focused dwarf can certainly use that in getting an easy proc going from a slowed skelly or goblin or even a zombie running away."
DvZ,3c4u86,Cindella_D,0,Sat Jul 4 21:06:24 2015 UTC,Only support I need are repairs and more melee guys near me and ranged guys behind.
DvZ,3c4u86,PickShark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"Dvz is not just a game of proc and kill anymore. While it's true certain building structures are not as useful, I see this as a great opportunity to roleplay. My personal favorite is the pyramid with banner. Placing that down as a rally point for this epic dwarven last stand. Just because you can't appreciate a different way of playing than you're used to doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. See, support in its current state is weak... But if there was a fully support build... It could be great"
DvZ,3c4u86,PickShark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"Well only the outside portion of the game is non-linear and where support is useful, the longer and more linear portion of the game is where support items like the ones suggested aren't very useful compared to the high gold and point cost. The current supportive abilities  (nisovin's and roamin's) are combat oriented, proving my point further.  Anyway I don't really want to create a huge wall of text littered with disagreements :P."

DvZ,3c55j3,winter477,4,Sun Jul 5 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"As a dwarf I hate them with a burning passion...   But as an Ogre I love to sneak up on dwarves on high pillars or walls and teach them how to fly! Fly Jimmy, fly! :D"
DvZ,3c55j3,Endergrill,2,Sun Jul 5 07:53:37 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree here. Ogres are dangerous because they're the only monster that can consistently remove a dwarf's ability to control whether or not they're in combat, as well as being the only monster that can directly move dwarves around on the field. To survive an ogre wave, you need to be aware of your surroundings much more than with other special monsters.  Two of the special monsters - venomburners and wolves - rely on isolated dwarves to get kills (wolves can break walls and venomburners can harass with fire, but ambushing and killing vulnerable dwarves is still a big part of their kit). Ogres synergize wonderfully with these two, because ""isolated dwarves"" is exactly what they deliver. An ogre wave followed by a wolf wave can easily take out 3-5 dwarves during the outdoor stage.  Further, an ogre, a wolf or two, and a horde of zombies harassing a vulnerable Jimmy make excellent opportunities for Heroes and enterprising dwarves to attempt daring rescues, which is loads of fun for both the rescuer and the rescuee - and if the rescue fails, the monsters involved get to enjoy nabbing two fun, interactive kills."
DvZ,3c55j3,Sarkavonsy,2,Sat Jul 4 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"The knockback is certainly frustrating at times, especially when there's a lot of ogre and a lot of goblins. End game in situations like that can be very difficult. But I wouldn't necessarily treat ogres like they're going to remain the way they are forever. Tweaks here and there can be made to make them more of a threat or less of a threat depending on various criteria.  I think at this point its just best to wait and see what's going to happen with them. The server has been out of Super Jimmy only mode for only a few days, so people should be given time to really come up with ways of handling something that seems like this impossible threat. Things might seem bad now, but someone could very well come up with a good anti-ogre strategy somewhere down the road!"
DvZ,3c55j3,figsandthings,2,Sat Jul 4 22:36:18 2015 UTC,"Ogres are how I wish all special mobs were. I like how they are powerful, but not way too overpowered where the dwarves can do nothing against them. I think all special mobs except ones like rats and spiderlings should be proc resistant. It would make the dwarves have to rely more on teamwork to defeat the monsters, instead of running out by themself, getting a proc, and killing a bunch if special mobs. Whenever I get ogre, I target a group of about 5 Jimmies and start slapping them with my paddle. If they all stay together and fight back against me, I always die without getting any kills. In other situations, most of them run, leaving 1 or 2 stragglers who I trap in a corner and kill them as they panic. If we made all special mobs proc resistant, but not too powerful, it would force Dwarves to rely on teamwork to defeat the monsters, which is more of what the game is supposed to be."
DvZ,3c55j3,mineman00567,2,Sat Jul 4 22:45:23 2015 UTC,"i sorta agree with this but think about no hero games, unprocable wolves would just cause the game to end, i played a game with a couple ogres and no heroes, we went to beginning of second shrines to death not killing all the ogres. so if all special mobs where like this then no hero games would be only 10 mins"

For a normal player the premades are probably best, hell the default class is one of the better classes for just general gameplay.

Also i never really need to join a full game. maybe 1.5 instead of double or something. Also its not pay to win, your just faster. pay to win would be like getting 100 points instead of 64. and getting a full 64 class is hard (if good then USUALLY 95,000 gold!)

Aside from the usual steps (decrease render distance, decrease particles, close other programs), I recommend setting leaves to opaque with optifine - the current maps use a lot of them, and they can add up to a lot of lag."

DvZ,3c3d4q,comkreaperkiller,7,Sat Jul 4 10:53:53 2015 UTC,"I did like the shield when I got to play with it for a little bit, the KB res, res and regen made it a nice item to use if you know how to use it and I am hopeful it will come back in a later update.  As for the star I think it should stay at 16 just it needs a buff that is all, I played a pacified round on plains today and just straight up healed using my mana and never went below 900. I think the 1 heart for 10 mana isn't enough to make it a usable heal. I was thinking maybe 5 for 50 if you want to keep the ratio, I think that 10 for 100 would burn through mana just a little fast if mass healing. If you really want to make the star worth it to heal others I really think the star should heal say 10 hearts for 75/50 mana as this would give people are real reasons to use the star as a primary to keep other people alive rather then just a nice idea you use once or twice when you remember."
DvZ,3c3d4q,SGT_JACKAL,3,Sat Jul 4 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"If we're to keep it at 1 heart, I would prefer an aoe heal instead of line of sight would feel more useful at that point. But I also like your idea of 5 for 50."
DvZ,3c3d4q,jsmeth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:00:34 2015 UTC,"1 heart with the slight cooldown isn't useful enough, I agree that the heal other needs to be more worth it."
DvZ,3c3d4q,Rayalot72,4,Sat Jul 4 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"The star could be better if the cooldown on the healing was reduced/removed, so you can actually keep broken armor jimmies alive instead of slowly healing them 1 heart at a time, a mostly useless endevour when the mobs hit for such large amounts by that point."
DvZ,3c3d4q,josh__ab,2,Sat Jul 4 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"With the Regrowth Star, although it has that second function, it doesn't FEEL like it has much of an effect because you can't see the benefit. Perhaps if it did something more visual, such as reset the target players proc, dwarves would be more inclined to use it?"
DvZ,3c3d4q,SamNosliw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"Regrowth star as others have covered is to small a heal to really matter beyond early/mid. mid/late game mobs well just lol at that 1 heart and be like hey one hit you know what that is, its a blood drop to what we do now. SGT_JACKAL has a good idea in turning it 5 for 50. Would in my opinion have more use come late game while still having the same healing cost. Either that or an AoE 1 heart heal. Its just not useful come the point mobs start getting damage upgrades."

Basically it's just a musket that deals 40 damage per shot but uses 10 arrows per shot, so you'd get 2 shots normally but 4 shots with massive quiver. So  it's a lesser version of the famous gnome tinder flame that dwarves desperately attempted to recreate. It'll leave a small puff of smoke when fired and fire a small, really quick cloud of fire that hardly drops so it almost travels in a straight line. It can't proc and would be used in the ranged weapon slot maybe? It also has a convenient  bayonet attached to it making it deal melee damage of 8."
DvZ,3c2t8d,Overhighlord,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:41:43 2015 UTC,"A weapon I'd want is the Buffalo Lance, it'll have longer reach and deal 8 damage to mobs right next to the player but deal more damage to mobs the further away they are. Running with it equipped for 20secs would couch the Lance, so if you continue running and hit a monster you'll deal a massive 30 hearts of damage. The Lance would have no procs and would be much stronger in combo with studded runeleather. It's made from the horn of the once common buffalo that were hunted heavily for their horns and furs."

Dont mind the details, and the ""un-friendly"" (just not to say anything worse). I probably dont know you but you seen cool, so imo you should keep playing and not take any ""side"".

I made a minecraft mod you guys enjoyed and now they have decided that all the hours of free entertainment I have provided are worth nothing and to hate on me to what purpose? What could this stuff possibly achieve? Would you cater to fans who act like this?  When I was a teenager and played video games 24/7, I thought all the time about how the developers were fucking idiots and ruining the game I love. I bet you and your friends feel that way, shame you think so little of me that you guys can't see the bigger picture since the thing the devs NEVER did when I was young, was talk to the community. Ever. They never posted, never talked to us, never reached out. They just made changes we hated and we had no place to tell them how fucking stupid they are.  I'm listening, but all I see is hate and zero understanding. You want me to understand why you think I'm ruining the game, but refuse to listen to my explanations of why I feel I'm not. It's making me understand why the old games I use to play developers never talked to the communities."

I know how hard it is being a game developer. Coming up with stuff is not easy and balancing can sometimes be a real pain, especially with large amounts of weapons and features you have to keep track of. And the people shitting on you like that definitely doesn't help, small game companies and even solo developers can have a really hard time because of these people.  But I love the work you and Nisovin put into DvZ, it's amazing how just 2 people are able to create the minigame that I loved back on the gym and still love to this date."
DvZ,3c0wzf,Tebotron,11,Fri Jul 3 20:32:30 2015 UTC,"I'll admit when the summer update started I was sceptical. The initial changes seemed off and did worry me.   The game as it stands however works. It really works. I didn't expect it to work as well as it does. Honestly, given more time, I will come to enjoy this update as much as previous updates. Kinda like buying a new pair of sneakers.   I could backseat Dev and say the things I would have done differently, communicated differently but it's irrelevant.   Rob your game is great and the rush of players this week has been great to see. Not to speak too much for everyone, the community isn't perfect and there are always gonna be guys who don't know their limits through immaturity or just being jerks.   We won't always agree 100% with you Rob, and I can't say I'm your biggest fan at times, but we're glad your sticking with this and doing what you do. Sometimes we can't understand because of how you do things but we're damn lucky to have a guy like you as Dev."

DvZ,3c0wzf,jujug28,8,Fri Jul 3 23:31:09 2015 UTC,"Its funny how OP said you were disconnected from the community when in fact you left a personable story from your real life on a post that was very critical towards you.  I just wanted to apologize for what I said and believed you were doing with the update a few weeks ago. The event that changed my mind happened yesterday when I played a game with my friend who had played DvZ only once or twice before and stopped because quite frankly he sucked at it. About 10 minutes into combat he tells me how good at the game and how much of a bad ass he is. (between you and me he rolled maybe a 5 kill proc at most xD) But to him he sees ""I just one shot 5 people I'm godly!"". I was always against upgrades and progression and such because I wanted it to be a game where ""your weapons don't get better you get better"". But the update made my friend, and new players alike, feel like the pro player I've always felt like and I see nothing bad about that :D"
DvZ,3c0wzf,IllyiaSvara,4,Fri Jul 3 20:54:39 2015 UTC,"Those comments aren't the ones I'm angry about nor should they be here but massive posts such as the ""turning off chat thread"" that became a discussion are the ones that annoy me when deleted. I'm trying to listen to explainations but it's just getting into group mentality that is tearing at the seems as people that I like are trying to drive me away from specific opinions i.e. yours and your white knights. The fragmented community and it's individual groups are the main problem, not you."
DvZ,3c0wzf,firebolt8900,3,Fri Jul 3 21:09:00 2015 UTC,"The whole chat being turned off thing was kind of a pointless argument in anycase. When chat goes crazy the mods should do whats needed to keep calm. They did their job exactly as they should have. There literally should have been no discussion. This is from my past experience of being mod on different games/servers/forums.  Sadly unlike a forum, reddit can't lock threads so the only option they have to stop a thread from degrading into one big flamewar is to remove it. This is a reddit problem not a problem on anyone running a subreddit. Yeah you can use automod to autodelete new posts, however unless the thread is stickied it just vanishes as well. The problem at the end of the day in that situation is the tools reddit provides are limited. Reddit is not a good platform for anything more than general talk and discussion. It is far to limited."
DvZ,3c0wzf,Endergrill,2,Fri Jul 3 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"Seriously guys? That was your response to my post about how much fun I was having with the update. I'm actually quite emotional now, thanks to discovering that. I'm so glad Rob chose to remove that because it is seriously getting to me, even so, I'm glad rob chose to bring that in here. It proves his point quite nicely.  Just thank you guys, thanks. I was about to play some DvZ, now I think I'm just going to bed. Hope you're sleeping well, because I'm not."

DvZ,3c0wzf,AmbitiousHobo,8,Sat Jul 4 11:26:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is Rob is perfectly valid in his concerns about where the game was not just as the creator but also from having tried to get some of my own friends into DvZ. Haven't yet managed to get them back on since the update but before the update, yeah they didn't even survive the first half of the first night. Why? for the reasons Rob stated in his videos. After that they didn't really care since it just felt a case of oh gotta know to do this, this, this and this to have a chance. They didn't like that and never played again after a few games with me. When a game is not open to new people without extreme perseverance the game can not grow its playing fanbase. Which with Rob at one point not wanting to do videos is the games only way of growing a fan base. (Who know's what rob currently has planned for videos)  Now onto the whole communication thing. End of the day every single game well also have their own group of friends in their own private calls, Ts, mumble etc etc. Why is this? I'm sure most of us have at some point either been in a big world boss raid as a guild with everyone on call and seen the mess in mmo's. Having everyone in one call/teamspeak and such is something which doesn't work.  The game has never been co-ordinated amongst the population of that one game. It's always been groups in a call. At best you could point to old days of people playing and watching rob stream and go along with that.   For someone being banned for bad fellowship, its a case of they were on a consistent enough basis just being toxic in game towards people. Either insulting new players and calling out new players playing as heros instead of helping. Purposefully trying to screw dwarves as a dwarf, Probably the two biggest ways to get banned for that reason.   A regular monster really should not be able to 1v1 a dwarf. Why? The game is built around the RP premise of the unending hordes of monsters against battle hardened dwarves holding their last shrine. Hardly an epic battle if oh look killed by a zombie 1v1. Special mobs yeah, they are special for a reason. Regular mobs no, they should be balanced around being an unending horde rather than facetank hulk smash. While I have shown my support for full upgrade withers being able to kill dwarves if they can get the 3 hits on, I can accept it's not meant to be since it goes against the premise of the game as an unending horde against the last survivors forming an epic tale that while no-one might ever hear is one that shall last an age.  You also appear to misunderstand what Rob means by an antifan. They created a video about types of fans a fair few months back on LoM. An antifan is one who only ever criticizes and insults refusing to accept anything and only doing their best to create flame wars, troll posts, and attacks on the game. Not people with legitimate problems.  For rob shutting down recent posts against the game. At the start of the testing period he said give them time, they are still changing things, working on things and tweaking numbers all while running at a full schedule.   DvZ is still skillbased. Just different skills. As a dwarf, you now need to actually think when to hold the shrine, when to retreat. I'm yet to see a shrine regen its health so yeah gotta protect the shrine always. Do you stay at the empty shrine with no armour while rolling a proc or get away with it. All while a single kaboom and one zombie hit well equal death. How best to target mobs, do I try and stop that ogre knowing full well it can just bypass me easily. How about that goblin planting bombs in the wall, do I dig down or try and find where it got in.  Heros: Bruce is still bruce. Niso- Spells on demand, can actually play as a supporting niso with real tactics now rather than hope for the best. Romain- Believe they still fixing his kit so till then won't talk till its done.  For the regular monsters no more just facetanking new dwarves and killing them with ease and maybe being able to kill a good dwarf. Now its more about forcing attrition. Zombies, who shall I target with my armour shred, those archers, maybe that lone jimmy, or just charge forth and keep the pressure. Skeletons even more about dealing armour damage and forcing gold loss. Goblins booom.  Special mobs is where you can try and kill a dwarf. An ogre can corner and trap a lone dwarf once inside and let the hordes take care of him as just an example. You might not be able to solo anymore but you can use your skill to bring about their deaths.   People aren't choosing sides, there are those that want DvZ to stay as a case of pure normalish PvP based rather than the direction rob wishes the game to go towards. Really thats the only discussion there ever is and split in the game. Slowly the more pure PvP people leave and go to PvP games where they can have their fun, while those that like the direction of DvZ towards being a final fight as a dwarf where you are pretty much a one man army trying to keep back the monsters from the last of your race. While the monsters are pretty much an Ork WAAAGH! (those that get the reference shall understand)"
DvZ,3c0wzf,TNT19000,13,Fri Jul 3 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"Hey there! MisturLime here. I've been playing this game for a while. Not as long as you of course; I started in February of 2014 on PMC. I'm not sure if I can really help you with your predicament, but at the very least I can share my own experience a member of the community.  When I started playing the game I was captured. I couldn't stop. For all intents and purposes, it was an addiction. It was affecting my school work. Instead of putting the necessary effort into being good at something that would affect the rest of my life, I choose to play this game for hours upon hours a day, everyday, for two months.  Before what I would consider to be my downfall, when I made it onto the leaderboards, I remember telling myself that I wouldn't look down on other players if I ever got somewhere with the server. I didn't want to be just another self-absorbed player who acted better than everyone just because of some accomplishments in a video game. That wasn't the person I wanted to be. But fast forward two weeks after I started playing to when I got onto the Ranger leaderboard, I started to forget about what kind of presence I really wanted to have within the game, within the community.  I shot up the leaderboards in only a few weeks. I started hanging out with a group of people who had already had a presence within the community. That's not to say that any of those people were bad people, in fact I'm still friends with many of them. While spending hour after hour playing with them though, I completely forgot about my promise to myself, to not act like I'm above anyone else. We were always some of the loudest people in every game we played. We ignored questions, joked around at the expense of others who weren't good at the game. It was really the opposite of what I had wanted. To make a long story short though, eventually after two months I got burnt out on DVZ, took a small break and then came back right before the big summer update of 2014. I didn't really change much in personality after the update, but there came a point where I was on the receiving end of some of the antics me and my friends used to pull before the update and I realized just how awful it felt. That's when I decided that I wasn't going to put up with that sorta stuff anymore. Honestly, looking back at the kind of player I was a year ago, I wouldn't want anything to do with me.  I guess the moral of the story here is, you have to decide what you really want out of the game and community and stick with it. What I personally want is a friendly, loving community where everyone is welcome and given an equal chance to participate and where people aren't looked down upon for being new players or just not being ""good enough."" I can't speak for anyone else and maybe you're not looking for the same thing as I am, but I know that I've tried to use my standing within the community to make it closer to what I want it to be and what I think it should be.  I think that's what everyone really needs to do. Take a look inward and see what they want out of the community and if they're actually contributing to creating that image. A lot of people already have varying opinions on the current state of the community, but in my opinion, an outsider looking in at what we have hear would see a really ugly face.  Again, I can't tell you or anyone else what they should do with their time here. I honestly don't know if you should stay or leave because that's ultimately up to you to decide. What I can say however, is that if we want to make the fragmented community whole and to create an image where everyone can at the very least tolerate each other, which is something I really hope most of us want, then maybe its time we just said enough is enough and actually acting on our desires to make this a better place."
DvZ,3c0wzf,johnb43,6,Fri Jul 3 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"You just got dragged in by the wrong people man.  But there's plenty of room to create new, and maybe even better friends.  I'm part of one of the mumble groups, and I have to say they're the best people I've ever met.  And then there are individual players who you can befriend.  Trust me, you're not stuck to your current friends, branch out and try to find more people, people that will change your negative minds into positive."
DvZ,3c0wzf,TJB14,6,Fri Jul 3 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"This is a simple minecraft mod that we all enjoy playing. I don't understand why it has to be more complicated than that. I don't understand why people have to take a game so seriously that they declare ""There's a war going on! Everyone has to choose a side!"" That's a ridiculous stance to take. There's no 'war' and there's no 'sides'. There are people who enjoy the game, and people who don't. The reasons for each may differ, but that is as complicated as it gets.  Why can't we just enjoy the game? Why does everything need to be blown out of proportion like this to the point where no one is satisfied and everyone is upset? All of these complaints, all of these things that are ""killing the game"" seem so arbitrary and trivial. You can't just enjoy the game for what it is?  You know what? I miss Leaderboards and Shields too! I thought having a goal to shoot for was the best thing! I felt like a total badass charging into a group of mobs, killing a skeleton, and rolling a P.R.O.C for 5 minutes! But those things aren't here anymore and I'm fine with that because these things were not essential to having fun in the game.   During the Summer Update when mobs were weak, armor shred didn't exist, and before the days of Golden Zombies I was really frustrated whenever I plagued because I knew I wouldn't be having a lot of fun for 40+ minutes. But I kept my damn mouth shut because I knew Rob was still changing shit and understood that we were still in a Beta phase! Now mobs are fun again! Hurray! You guys get to pick on new players, break their armor, steal their mana, and kill them just like before! All we had to do was have some patience, but we got there in the end guys! Three cheers for an understanding communit- OH. WAIT.  This community is not doing itself any favors. If the community is damaged, it's because it does it to itself. I know this word gets thrown around without basis a lot, but if I could describe the DvZ community in one word, it would be 'entitled'. That's really all it is. The way you guys go on and on about how ""everything I love in DvZ is being taken away"" and that ""the game I love is gone"" is absolutely despicable and overall damaging to the community as a whole. That you would put such stock in a minecraft mod to the point of being emotionally hurt by these changes to the point of throwing around insults speaks volumes of the maturity that people can expect here.  Just... play the game. Build a wall, defend a shrine, roll a P.R.O.C, laugh with friends. Why does it have to be more complicated than that?"
DvZ,3c0wzf,winter477,2,Sat Jul 4 00:51:01 2015 UTC,"I agree but when you say people are saying ""everything I love in dvz is being taken away"" some people view this as an opinion. I understand it's not seen that way. But for those who it isn't a suggestion consider moving on."

I must agree with you, that the community is getting more fragmented than before but that, I think, has to do with a mentality change in people in general."

What in the wide world are you talking about? I don't see anything warlike going on. And posts like this are diametrically opposite to 'keeping the peace'. This is deliberately rude and inflammatory.  There's constructive criticism, and there's this. This is just troublemaking.  Judging on the general tone of this post, the fact that you hid behind an alt instead of having the courage of your convictions to say these things about the community to our faces, and this particular quotation here:   I’m pro-leaderboard, pro-skill based DvZ, and, atm, anti-Rob   ...then to answer your question, yes, I think you should leave.

If you then change the name of the resource pack to be legacy_buffalowizards_dvz.zip you can then edit the file.

DvZ,3bzwxd,steampunkdNinja,11,Fri Jul 3 14:42:43 2015 UTC,"The dwarves have a leader. His name is Bruce. :P  ...but seriously, I understand where you're coming from. It's really just good sense and good fellowship that you're looking for, though. We've had a huge influx of newbies in the last two days (and do remember, it is only two days! Everyone stop panicking!) and it always takes a couple of weeks before things calm down after an update or when there's a rush of newbies for some other reason. The regulars/experienced players are spread over five or six servers, so it'll take time for the community to absorb the new players and for them to learn how to do things.  We don't really need leaders. We just need good players behaving well and explaining things clearly when people ask for help - or sometimes when they don't ask, but need it anyway...!"
DvZ,3bzwxd,Alderdash,8,Fri Jul 3 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the concept of a ""leader,"" but you're definitely correct about needing players to be helpful towards new players (Which some people have already been doing!), and you're definitely right that this can be anyone who's played the game. What's most important here is that we're a friendly, welcoming community who wont look down on new players who don't know what they're doing and work together to help them out!  But as a side note, I think that naming a specific person as ""leader"" will probably only create a sort of popularity contest, especially with the way things on the subreddit (or even in-game) tend to go sometimes."
DvZ,3bzwxd,figsandthings,5,Fri Jul 3 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"I agree.  No one really likes being bossed around to be honest so I feel the concept of a leader will lead to problems personally.  But DVZ is a teamwork based game.  Whether you're on the side of good or evil all players should work together to get what needs to be done, done."
DvZ,3bzwxd,CptAmazing98,2,Fri Jul 3 15:01:56 2015 UTC,Heros usually assume the roles of leaders and there's a few dwarves here and there asking people to do stuff but overall I don't think that self-elected leaders right now would be helpful to the game.

SJ month was filled with very experienced players, and some things just would be impossible to balance or fix before they could see how it ran in proper games with a mix of players.

DvZ,3bz31p,Alderdash,2,Fri Jul 3 09:23:43 2015 UTC,"Bruce : Too OP. He is almost IMPOSSIBLE to kill. A lot of monster have trouble killing Bruce even after the shrine falls. Nisovin : Well balanced. I like how you can select spells to cast. Roamin : Very bad. He sucks, AGREED. I loved him before."
DvZ,3bz31p,LordCluckles,2,Fri Jul 3 09:08:42 2015 UTC,The thing is that old man Willakers is OP on purpose. he's made so that if anyone plays him they will do a good job leading the Jimmys and honestly that's fine.
DvZ,3bz31p,Tripleat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:05:14 2015 UTC,Hey! I played as Roamin before I didn't die. I had to leave when there was 17 more Jimmies and the second shrine was being defended. 5 min later I go back and the server I was on was gone. So the game probably ended or something.
DvZ,3bz31p,_TheEtanMan_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:10:51 2015 UTC,Roamin is bad because he's not fun (unable to PROC) not because he's underpowered
DvZ,3bz31p,keaganwill,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"I was a little disappointed with that. But the flamethrower made it so it doesn't matter. Roamin feels like a mix of Paladin and Berserker class. He can't proc, but he has something that can kill lots of enemies really fast. A near instant proc."
DvZ,3bz31p,_TheEtanMan_,2,Sat Jul 4 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"heros are made easier for the people. they are supposed to be easier and fun to play. they are supposed to be OP as they are the leader of the dwarves. they still need balancing, but they are designed so they can't be killed."
DvZ,3bz31p,TheDrCreeps,2,Fri Jul 3 11:49:45 2015 UTC,"I think people are a bit too hard on Roamin. I've only been him once but he isn't terrible. Roamin is still good at killing harder mobs and can still take down Golems, Wolves, and Ogres. He also can hit his flamethrower once or twice and let others proc. I do agree he needs a boost but Im pretty sure he is getting one soon."
DvZ,3bz31p,Bob_higs,2,Fri Jul 3 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"I played as Nisovin during the first week or two of the Summer Update, twice in fact. He was my favorite Hero before, and he remains such now. Picking spells is amazing, and makes getting P.R.O.Cs a breeze. I would just throw an Explosion at a group of AI and quickly switch to my Tinderflame to get an easy P.R.O.C. Nisovin is amazing fun to play, but I miss the mega shield and would like it to return in some way.  Roamin got nerfed hard, but he's still fun. I think I've only ever played him on Plains so I never truly got a chance to shine with him. The refilling Flamethrower is fantastic. I always hated having to leave the battle to hunt down an oil fountain, it always felt like a personal failure when I had to drag myself away from the wall because I couldn't defend it properly anymore. I am really excited for him to receive the OG Warhammer, that'll be interesting to play against. Though I understand that all heroes will be given Jimmy Juice, I really, really hope Roamin can keep some of his support moves. AE Healing was pretty fun!  Bruce is more fun than ever. I don't know what other people are talking about, I love the new Excaliju texture. Auto-heal is very strong on him, too. 30 hearts, plus an auto-heal when you get to 15, plus half cost, means that Bruce always has 1000 mana. It's fitting that he is nigh-invincible, he's goddamn Old Man Willakers!  I think it's a fantastic change to take away their armor, too. Somehow they just didn't look right clad in armor the same as everyone else, especially Roamin. It's a good aesthetic change."
DvZ,3bz31p,AmbitiousHobo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:02:25 2015 UTC,I think Bruce is supposed to be somewhat un killable but im not sure thats how i interperted rawb. but im not sure again

Specially now that there is jimmy juice one could just AFK standing in shrine waiting that game continues to end game part that is usually most exciting. and that is unfair to others. Since you are taking one playing slot so there might be one jimmy out there that could not play. Also you are leeching gold without giving anything to gameplay to others. What if every monster that had plagued would just AFK in spawn?  Fact that you only AFK:d few last minutes if of course lesser felony, but how would admin know have you done that whole game. At least Rob is known to be strict but ruthless when dealing with jimmyes behaving badly.  If noticed some individuals that are active and respected in community to AFK as dwarf hiding someplace (or at least kind of afk but chatting) until last shrine fall.

Therefore, my loadout consists of all three cobble upgrades, all three mortar upgrades, and all three torch upgrades. This adds up to 3 1/2 stacks of torches, 3 1/2 stacks of mortar, and 7 stacks of cobblestone I end up tossing at player X's feet before offing myself.  In essence, I am a walking supply battery."
DvZ,3bxi5k,ArchasTL,14,Fri Jul 3 01:33:54 2015 UTC,I have thought of putting a Chest Upgrade in for Dwarves to trade things around or donate materials to each other
DvZ,3bxi5k,Rurikar,3,Fri Jul 3 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of that. I know I'm certainly not the only one who is a dedicated monster player, and having a sort of communal supply chest item you can drop to reinforce needy dwarves would be neat. Hell, even if you don't plan on suiciding, that sorta thing would be cool.   As a general idea, I'd love to see what sort of other changes you could implement to further encourage teamwork, because I feel as though DvZ is sadly lacking in that regard. There's been obvious movement toward a more team-focused game, but at the moment, I still feel like the dwarves and monsters are not teams, but rather groups of autonomous individuals. Whatever you can do to break that mold would be stellar."
DvZ,3bxi5k,ArchasTL,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:21:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I think we as players have to be teamwork oriented as well. Calling out where a Golem or Mage is at is super helpful, but it doesn't happen that often."
DvZ,3bxi5k,ArchasTL,3,Fri Jul 3 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel that if there are few or no mechanics in place to encourage teamwork, then no teamwork will occur. Dwarves, at this point in DvZ, have little incentive to work as a team and coordinate effectively. Sure, calling out holes in the wall and where those wolverines are headed is helpful and benefits the team, but I think in order to foster a more tight-knit, cooperative band of dwarves, there ought to be an appropriate system of reward and punishment involved. I couldn't tell you how to do that, since I'm no game designer, but I'm confident that should Rob go in that direction, he'll come up with something great."

I do usually drop any available starting supplies, and sometimes do a bit of building, but actually having a backup loadout is something that wouldn't have occurred to me.

DvZ,3bto6r,Syndexic,2,Thu Jul 2 01:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the audience he is trying to reach with this post probably doesn't check the reddit regularly if they even know it exists.

DvZ,3bto6r,iamtallerthanyou,3,Thu Jul 2 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"The only time I ever really have a problem with people doing this is when its obvious that they know better. When its a new player or someone who doesn't play often enough and they see someone doing this and replicate it because they legitimately think its a good idea, I can understand although I still dislike seeing it.  Aside from a post like this saying not to do it, the only thing that can really be done is to let people know that its not a good strategy and why. Neither tall walls or thing walls are beneficial and making super tall walls is just a waste of resources. Stuff like that.  As for you specifically contributing to more people doing something like making super tall walls? Well, hindsight's a thing. I can't tell you not to do something like this in the future; That's your choice. I only hope that you and perhaps others who do know better when it comes to this sort of thing have learned from it."
DvZ,3bto6r,figsandthings,3,Thu Jul 2 02:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do like the map itself.  But these giant walls every game just put me off to the point where I just either avoid the map or suicide when it comes up.  I don't mind people goofing off, but goofing off in a place where it's intrusife for others is really annoying, especially if done every game."
DvZ,3btgw3,LittleBlast5,4,Thu Jul 2 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"MAJOR RED FLAGS EVERYWHERE! There are many reasons why this map won't work.   The map is in properly bedrocked. Lots of holes everywhere. Dwarves can dig into the mountain and hide... 6 SHRINES!? Runtime is very improper. The runtime between shrine 1 and 2 is about 12 SECONDS (Ideal runtime is 20s to 30s) Detail is poor. The beacons are exposed in the shrines. Improper capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and spelling. Too much lava. Bad for the dwarves and mobs. Too many lights. A great advantage for the dwarves. Poorly done. The map looks like it was rushed. You need to take time in detail. Too many paths. It seems like a maze. Many dwarves will get lost. Placement of areas(Such as quarry, lumber, mobspawn, dwarf spawn). Dwarf Spawn is far away from everything. Mobspawn is too close to the shrine. Dwarves can easily shoot any monsters coming from mobspawn. The entire map has to be re-done and fixed."
DvZ,3btgw3,LordCluckles,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:24:52 2015 UTC,"If you could point out where fits piorly bedrocked that would be nice. If a dwarf wants to dig into the walls the so be it, you can do that on a good amount of maps.  Runtime is short due to there being 6 shrines, when i was talking with nis a while back he said they were fine.  The map has 6 shrines, yeah, so what. Its unique.  Many shrines have visable beacons. And is the improper grammar in the post or the map? How does that have anything to do with this. And i find there to be plenty of detail.  There really isnt much lava, the can all be removed by a single jimmy with some cobble.  Really isnt to many paths, everything goes the same place, its all about choices.  Dwarf spawn is actually in the middle, for 6 shrine its at 4th, for the other two its at second (i put that in wrong on OP ill change in a second)  Mobspawn is close but there is a good deal of cover, and the platform above means skellies can rain hell on dwarves defending the shrine.  And just so you know ive been working on this map since ~october of 2014."

DvZ,3btgw3,Overhighlord,3,Thu Jul 2 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"this is very narrow, the whole map does not give ether the mobs or the dwarves any space. even with few alt paths, it needs a bit of widening. otherwise, it looks good!"
DvZ,3btgw3,Overhighlord,-1,Thu Jul 2 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like the positioning of the alternate pathes makes up for how narrow it can be at parts. Also, the platform allows skellies to rain hell on the dwarves at first, which is the narrowest point.  Edit: didnt Rob say no downvoting based on opinion? You dont see me downvoting you guys because you gave your point of view."
DvZ,3btgw3,Wifi_LC,3,Thu Jul 2 02:26:26 2015 UTC,"The alt paths are easier to hold then the main path, which is really easy to defend. The entire map is too narrow for 60 players. Not too mention how steep the first area is."
DvZ,3btgw3,ZamTheJimmy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:32:55 2015 UTC,"Arent alt paths normally easy to hold? The alt path from first is a mostly verticle path once you get to the end of the tunnel. The alt path from 2nd to 3rd is  only accessable from second, meaning if you get knocked back out the exit you have to go all the way to 2nd to get back and defend. This is only different on the 3 shrine map.  Something i forgot to note is that the path from the end of the bridge to 4th opens up beneath the floor of the enterance, and at the buildings.  The only real narrow area i see before going inside is first, which i believe i balanced with theultiple sode ways and the skellie death platforms.  Edit: What exactly do you mean when you say ""How steep first is"", do you mean the walls?"

DvZ,3brehk,Bruces_Jimmy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:41:09 2015 UTC,The same reason there is no monster spawn. I ran out of steam. There was about one month in between building them. I pretty much forced the final room out of myself because I had put so much effort into the rest. The weird shape I chose for it made it hard to do traditional pretty stuff. I had a lot more fun building the curvy pathways to it :P Cutting this to 3 shrines wasn't really an option either as the map has short distances between the shrines.
DvZ,3brehk,Bruces_Jimmy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"The run time between shrines is almost identical to that of Raenil Sanctuary's. With the paths at least seeming more defendable than that of Raenils I actually don't think it'd be an issue if it only had 3 Shrines, in-fact, a smaller map would be a nice change of pace compared to what we have currently."
DvZ,3brehk,Bruces_Jimmy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:23 2015 UTC,I'd rather put some more effort into the final. This is a WIP after all. I think 3rd is way too big for a final shrine.

I don't mean that we have bad content creating community members not at all. I enjoy a lot of the songs that are DvZ community made... but they are not something I would personally want to listen to while making or watching a video  I don't know maybe the grandios music is not what rob had in mind and I am just insane :P
DvZ,3boa0h,keaganwill,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:41:38 2015 UTC,Thats understandable   Thanks! :D
DvZ,3boa0h,jujug28,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:48:25 2015 UTC,I just want to clarify what I am about to say is 100% my own thoughts and speculations. Do not take this as information as what the developers had in mind.   Rob said people loved the old soundtrack but he couldn't use it because of copyrighted music. I am assuming they might want to have an album that captures the same essence and sets the same mood as the old soundtracks. Songs that vary from grandness to intense action moods.
DvZ,3boa0h,NaquIma,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:49:08 2015 UTC,also thinking about it we can use music in the free domain cant we?

DvZ,3bojpo,MastermegaGamer,2,Tue Jun 30 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"So a few things I noticed:  -The movement is smooth and believable (for minecraft), good job.  -The camera moves enough to be interesting, but not too quickly.  -There seems to be a slight visual artifact on the front and back of their bodies at about 4-6 seconds in.  -There needs to be sound, but I assume you will add this in post  -The Plain grass is a little boring, having some kind of scenery/ a proper setting would certainly improve the aesthetic.  That's all I can really say without going in to huge detail, but for a first time it's very good."

That was the Mage's only weapon that I could see and I didn't notice any other 'spells' it might have had.

DvZ,3bmgg4,johnb43,3,Tue Jun 30 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"Intelligence is a rather important merit. Given how ogres are typically portrayed as moronic brutes, an ogre with the capacity for reason and (at the very least) mid-level thinking would be seen as a veritable genius among their kind. Couple that with apparent magical aptitude, and it's pretty easy to see why the ogres would venerate him.  That said, the Mage itself is definitely not the scary part of the event. He contributes relatively little to the battle on his own; it's his curse that makes him dangerous. Being vulnerable to procs doesn't matter too much when his most valuable asset is auto-cast upon spawning in, and Rob has stated that his proc vulnerability is by design due to how dangerous the curse can be."

DvZ,3bl73r,ArchasTL,2,Tue Jun 30 10:01:31 2015 UTC,"So very very true. I'm located in Australia, and so Jimmy Juice was also a celebrated change that was added to the game for me :)"
DvZ,3bl73r,Doom_BringerMC,2,Tue Jun 30 10:59:21 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Juice is in a weird place. It's designed to be friendly to new players and those with terrible latency issues so that being a dwarf is not completely impossible. However, due to how lenient it is, it's by far the most powerful ale available, so there's simply no reason to use any other ale. On top of that, any change to the Jimmy Juice to encourage the use of other types of healing will make it less powerful, defeating the purpose of having it. It's SUPPOSED to be really, really good, and that conflict of interest bothers me a bit.  I mean, I like the idea of a ""hold-your-hand"" ale that caters to the relevant parties, but it's incredibly powerful, makes all other ales obsolete, and cannot be nerfed without making it worthless at doing its job."
DvZ,3bl73r,goalie1248,7,Tue Jun 30 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it makes other ales obsolete, the other ales are designed more for different uses. For example the regrowth star suits those that play Ranger or more of a supportive class. If you're generally out of the fray you have little use for an auto-heal and it's generally more beneficial to be healing other players since you're not using the mana for yourself. The Holy Ale allows for more sustained combat, you'll find if you try to be permanently in the fight with Jimmy Juice you're going to very quickly burn through your ale which is most true when it comes to defending the latter shrines. The additional 6 hearts Holy Ale gives is huge; you can go much longer between heals and conserve your mana for longer because of it. While the autoheal will keep you alive it will inevitable kill you too."
DvZ,3bl73r,FallDamage312,2,Tue Jun 30 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"I run a custom class with no ale selected, Jimmy Juice is useful, but I like to free up the points to use on other stuff like slabs and super mortar. Plus I like the added challenge to have to watch my health while procing since momentum/absorption hearts are gone."
DvZ,3bl73r,LittleBlast5,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"I use the absorption ale, jimmy juice takes the fun out of the game for me."
DvZ,3bl73r,Alderdash,12,Wed Jul 1 12:06:42 2015 UTC,They have every roght to play this game aswell.
DvZ,3bl73r,Tomlough,5,Tue Jun 30 08:16:11 2015 UTC,"but some people (including me) hate to be left out, and alone.   Aren't there enough other people to talk to? man, the way how you worded this is like you're saying that nobody around you is speaking English or something, while there are enough people who do."
DvZ,3bl73r,FlagFlayer,4,Tue Jun 30 08:32:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is such terrible poppycock!  ""Making an enclosed guild and not letting anyone else in"". If it's so important that you can understand this tiny portion of the community you know what you're perfectly open to do? Learn Dutch. Oh, that's too much effort and you shouldn't have to do that? That's what you're demanding of them!! To learn another language because apparently your language is so important!  You make such a big deal about not understanding what is going on when the Dutch players talk to each other, but you completely ignore that for them, that is every game that they go into without another person who speaks Dutch.   And still they come anyway, and thankfully, the majority of players attempt to make them welcome, not treat them like pariahs because the don't understand English.  This is a disgraceful, 19th century imperialistic attitude, and I'm honestly surprised to see it from someone who is, I assume, under 60."
DvZ,3bl73r,Abcmsaj,7,Tue Jun 30 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"I am the one that got hurt by this. I am not saying anyone else is. I personally hate when people shut other people out, be it for another language, or just plain ignoring. Your ignorance of what I am saying is unbearable.   Except that your original comment implied that ""we"" do feel the same way as you:   one problem with that, canceling out this lag means ever so more dutch in DvZ chat. No offense dutch, but we just don't understand a thing and it's kind of annoying.   You do not speak for the majority, nor even for a few. Whatever reasoning there is behind your prejudice, the way you expressed it is intolerable (and no, saying ""no offence"" doesn't make the remotest difference to whether people are offended by something) and unnecessary - it is this that's earning you the negative feedback.  If you dislike seeing languages you don't understand in DvZ chat, you can use the /ignore system or even /chat. In the meantime if you think the existence of multiple non-English languages is an attempt to shut you out of something, you may benefit from some research into the history of language, or you could spend some time learning how some people live in places that don't speak your language.  To be clear, you are an arse. Not simply for holding the views you do, but for the terrible way you choose to express them. (No offence, of course.)   You better not waste my time again.   Laughable."
DvZ,3bl73r,Tebotron,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"You know what? Making you shut up is hard so I'll just go the easy way, you win. Dutch people, speak all the dutch you want, I don't even care anymore. Happy now? Hope you are because I myself was very offended by the conversation. CONGRATULATIONS YOU WIN, YOU HURT THE COMMENTER SO MUCH HE DECIDED TO JUST LET YOU WIN, HAPPY TIMES."
DvZ,3bl73r,global_ninja,5,Wed Jul 1 07:43:28 2015 UTC,Congrats /u/Tomlough! :D
DvZ,3bl73r,global_ninja,5,Wed Jul 1 09:24:22 2015 UTC,"Can I just clear something up?   Your aggressive attitude only proves that you're demanding me to shut up.   and   If they want to speak dutch, let them ask in chat if there's anyone Dutch, be it in Dutch or English, and then /msg them instead. You better not waste my time again.   No server rule dictates that players should speak English. As such players are free to type in the game chat in whatever language they choose, should it be English, Dutch, or any other language.  It's not really a problem. Say someone from the Netherlands who doesn't speak English wants to play on the server?  If they can chat to other players in Dutch it helps build the community.  Yes, it's frustrating to suddenly find yourself in the minority of language speaking people, particularly if you're UK/US and really used to English being spoken. But it helps build the community and so it isn't a bad thing, and as such demanding they keep to to /msg's, which are more time consuming to write in a fast paced game like DVZ, is a bit much."

DvZ,3bl73r,FlagFlayer,9,Wed Jul 1 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"Guy, your argument is wrong and quite frankly doesn't make sense on any sort of level. Many Dutch people were playing the game regardless of lag anyway. I can't fathom how more people playing the game can be a problem, isn't that exactly what we want here?"
DvZ,3bl73r,Alderdash,5,Wed Jul 1 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and even then, generally Dutch people have good internet, so the lag they'll get on DvZ is very minimal."
DvZ,3bl73r,stefanloos,0,Wed Jul 1 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"EU lag my friend, it's bad. If there weren't the problem of pots+EU lag, there would be a bunch of people from all over the world, not excluding, the netherlands, because of: EU lag. I just got better internet, so EU lag can go to hell for me. But honestly, that Endergrill told me I can just ignore, problem solved :P"
DvZ,3bl73r,Endergrill,6,Wed Jul 1 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"I don't experience lag, and I'm from EU, it all depends on which ISP you have and where you live man. Not everyone has to deal with the same lag issues you used to have."
DvZ,3bl73r,FlagFlayer,7,Wed Jul 1 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"I really find comments like these disappointing.  People have every right to play this game in the language they desire. And why would you like to know what they say? Most of the times it won't be of any interest to you, just some chit chatter between Dutch friends."
DvZ,3bl73r,druid24,0,Tue Jun 30 10:05:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't tell them they can't talk dutch, I personally find it annoying. I can't stop them from talking, and honestly I don't wanna hurt any dutch player. I just hate when people talk to themselves and leave people out, and alone."
DvZ,3bl73r,FlagFlayer,6,Tue Jun 30 10:06:58 2015 UTC,"Then shouldn't you hate yourself for doing it to them...? :)  When non-English speaking players join the server, they're going into a place where the vast majority of what is going on they can't understand, it's difficult for them to get help or explanations, and then they have to put up with the hostility of rude players (not directing this at you, but I've seen some disgraceful conduct towards the Dutch players at times) who for some reason think that ""English"" is the default.  Most players on the server speak English by a considerable percentage, the players who are more likely to be left out and alone are those who do not..."
DvZ,3bl73r,druid24,3,Tue Jun 30 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"Well, you said you find Dutch speaking people annoying, it's effectively the same as saying 'you cannot talk Dutch because I demand you talk English all the time!'  And again, most of the conversations they make are nothing of interest to you or others, just some chit chatter with friends."
DvZ,3blmc6,LucasRed1,4,Tue Jun 30 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"Just a fair warning, the hud up on the top left of your screen probably isn't allowed. The only mod that is allowed on the server is OptiFine."
DvZ,3blmc6,MasterOfSpasms,7,Tue Jun 30 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"That is literally telling him info he could see in F3. That has no reason to be banned, as it gives no real advantage."
DvZ,3blmc6,Awesomeshafter,3,Tue Jun 30 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"The only mod that is allowed on the server is OptiFine.   That is optifine. There's an option somewhere that lets you see some of the basic info f3 tells you without needing to press f3, although with how many options there are it's hard to remember what and where a specific one is."
DvZ,3blmc6,Splax77,2,Tue Jun 30 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm using Optifine, the numbers are a recent feature. Really useful and I don't have to pull up F3 all the time."

It took me forever to be decent at dvz but now i can hang in there till the end. The new changes definitely make dvz more accessible, but also shrink the skill gap by making mobs potentially very very scary. even a very experienced dwarf can die early if they aren't careful and thats something I love. I think the update has brought a huge equalizer into the mix. And the ability to change your loadout can let you learn a whole new playstyle. when you get the funds to do so, I strongly suggest a warhammer/dragonskin bow combo for 5 second AOE procs every 30 seconds. that combined with holy ale and you're pretty much set."

July 1st was not, is not, and will not be the date, because the reason he announced that date was to drive home the idea of Jimmies clinging too much to a date that, like with all Internet things, is mercurial and wildly subject to change and delay.

DvZ,3bin8n,Overhighlord,23,Mon Jun 29 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"Not even close. We will continue to evaluate DvZ over the course of summer and we still have a lot of things planned. This weekend was to see if I had the star power to just really bring a ton of people into the community, but I don't. There is a lot of interest in DvZ still, lots of people came out to support it, but not so much it's something that should be a major focus for me. Short term, this doesn't really change anything, long term it means we most likely won't put a lot of focus on building on DvZ or changing the game drastically in the future. Keep in mind that this could change just on popularity of DvZ or how it fares after Summer.   I wanted to contract out this big time musician I have worked in the past to do a full album, but that's not going to be remotely possible now without a big investment from myself that I can't really justify for this project at this time. I still want to bring music into DvZ, but I'm going to have to look in a different direction now. It's not the end of the world or of DvZ, I was just hoping to be able to continue putting a major focus on DvZ going forward and I can still do a lot of things that matter more to regular players then music and still do videos, they will just be slightly less cool!  I still feel like a lot of the changes we have done to DvZ that have changed up the game are the right direction we want to head. We have gotten some great feedback and I'm going to be working most of this week on clean up, regular balance, patching up heroes, and changing a few things based on some stuff the community has brought up to me. Most of last night I spent just watching and talking to you guys in games and reading feedback on the new armor shred systems, so there is some stuff I want to change.  edit: Also you guys speaking on my behalf are really out of line.   edit2: Just to follow up. You guys are really irresponsible with this stuff. You have numbers you think are the only numbers me and Nisovin are using, you have a single puzzle piece of puzzle for what we were trying to do, and from that your drawing conclusions. I was trying to see what kind of immediate pull I have with my Youtube audience with a carrot on the stick approach. I'm sure if I make a big deal and gave tons of notices, we could totally pull in 350 people on a Sunday, you have missed the point though. I was looking to understand what the DEMAND of 25,000 people on Youtube does to a server that holds 350 people. To draw your own conclusions on how we should proceed and tell us what you think we should do with the information you have is foolish in itself because even you guys must consider you don't have all the information.  Chill out guys."
DvZ,3bin8n,Rurikar,27,Mon Jun 29 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"This weekend was to see if I had the star power to just really bring a ton of people into the community, but I don't.    Doesn't seem like you're being entirely fair on yourself. You announced this 'event' (for want of a better word) at extremely short notice, towards the end of what was basically an hour-long vlog which is not a typical format known to interest your audience, with no real specific time ('after the LoM parade' of undefined length), to occur at a time of night when the vast majority of Europe is asleep. Did you take all of that into account  when setting your target/deciding you don't have the 'star power'?  Also, if this is about bringing people into the community, then surely numbers from last night are irrelevant until compared with numbers a few weeks from now? If the majority of people who came last night stay and become a part of the community, is that not more of a success - except in financial terms - than 350 people who play once and never again?"
DvZ,3bin8n,Tomlough,7,Mon Jun 29 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"You announced this 'event' (for want of a better word) at extremely short notice  with no real specific time  to occur at a time of night when the vast majority of Europe is asleep   Which was intended.  My intention wasn't to focus my entire community and push them to DvZ, our servers can't really hold that number. I wanted a to see if a single video with notice is enough to bring the numbers up to a point where me and Nisovin have to consider changing the server scale. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't to the point where we had Super Jimmies unable to get into the server. It was that scale I was interested in because that is something I would have to fundamentally change before releasing it out of SJ mode.   I don't even know why this has to be an argument though. We have internal numbers and discussions you cannot personally understand from multiple levels of understanding and I'm not trying to be insulting, we don't give you guys that information. We have numbers of how much money we made from how many different people in a short time period from last year and I wanted to see if those numbers were comparing to todays numbers. I can't even possibly begin to talk about that though."
DvZ,3bin8n,Rurikar,15,Mon Jun 29 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't trying to argue with you, I was just curious about what your actual target was, because obviously there's a huge difference between getting 350 SJs in the limited circumstances mentioned above, and getting 350 SJs from a carefully-executed series of specific announcements. Now that you've said it was intended, your original comment about not meeting your target is a lot clearer.  As you've said you're now working on cleaning up the update, is there currently a place it's acceptable to post feedback/notes on that sort of stuff, or should we still be waiting for you to finish the update and then post a big feedback thread like last time? There are a couple of (minor) bugs I've not reported on the website because I figured you're not interested in those right now, but there's a reasonable chance you're not aware of them yet."

DvZ,3bin8n,rstd2,13,Tue Jun 30 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"This weekend was to see if I had the star power to just really bring a ton of people into the community, but I don't.    I don't think you give yourself enough credit for how much pull you have, you mentioned the event for a few minutes in the middle of a 1:15 video (us Jimmies have a very short attention span) and a tweet that went out about 30 min after the video said it'd be starting. Not to mention the video was only released a few days before that. I absolutely think that we could have filled out the server if there was a few more days for the news to spread.  I thought it was huge that we were over 200 SJ's for most of that time and that we had a solid 5 games going during that time.  There were a lot of new people, people who just dropped the cash on your few sentences to try it out, during the games and from what I saw the more experienced players were pretty helpful to them.   Whatever you decide I'll still be playing and keep up with SJ, I trust your skill with designing the game and vision for DvZ. Even though you get a lot of shit for the changes you make I know they'll turn out for a better game for pretty much everyone, that's how it has always been in the past.  And those times changes didn't work out as planned, you've never forced them on us, you adjusted them accordingly.  I think this update is the best one yet and it's not even done yet. No idea how to end this, I mostly lurk here, but thanks for keeping up the work with DvZ and I'll keep procing zombies as long as I can."

DvZ,3bin8n,Jeromemasterc,4,Mon Jun 29 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Then you weren't the target audience.  I put out a DvZ video, it had over 25,000 views. From this I can see how many people of this Youtube audience are interested in becoming paid supporters of DvZ without even thinking about it. I was looking for a snapshot of video support, not a kickstarter of getting the word out to everyone involved."
DvZ,3bin8n,Rurikar,6,Mon Jun 29 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"srry. meh bad. I did see the video, but I guess I missed that bit - being as long as it was."
DvZ,3bin8n,5ilver42,9,Mon Jun 29 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan of DvZ since it was still called Dwarves Versus Vampires and I didn't even know about the event in spite of keeping up regularly with DvZ. I hadn't had time to watch through the full video until now because I kept getting interrupted since it came out friday, and if I had known you were trying to get a big push of support I would've thrown money at you. Not trying to influence your decision, but to be fair the announcement you were trying to reach 350 Super Jimmies was tucked away at the end of an hour long update video.  Also the I chose this night speech gave me chills and I love you."
DvZ,3bin8n,TheSneakyPaladin,2,Mon Jun 29 19:44:56 2015 UTC,"From what I have seen in the past, I do think what you do as the creator of dvz takes the game in the right direction. I also think that unlike Urealms live, the only real drive to buy super jimmy is word of mouth. If you can't play the update, all you can really do is have faith in the creator of that game, which is especially difficult when money is involved. Personally I think that unless there are regular videos, it will be very difficult to obtain the same level of success you would with streaming."
DvZ,3bin8n,AbdealiGames,2,Mon Jun 29 16:48:03 2015 UTC,Altho the target was even close to being reached I know you are going to do what is best for the game. At the time it might seem like it is the worse update ever to the hardcore players or it might seem like that to the noobs but I believe in you and I trust you will do what is best for the DvZ community as a whole to make sure everyone can try and have an equally fun time with there Jimmys. DvZ is your baby and I know you will always do what is right for your babies future.
DvZ,3bin8n,billy9101112,2,Mon Jun 29 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"I feel that the game would gain popularity if you made videos of you playing it, However, if you don't want to record, just playing it with the Jimmys would also raise popularity. Also, I feel that a way to appeal to the hardcore fans without changing the game would be making the build-your-own class have a point max of 100, so it is more then a preset class. If that is too op, then maybe make the point max start at 64, but then up-gradable for an insane amount of gold."

DvZ,3bin8n,IllyiaSvara,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"I feel that DvZ can be big again like it used to be. The problem I think for reaching the goal was simply theres so much going on right now in the projects going on  that people have to choose between them. Like for money terms it was donate to UR Live or donate to DvZ. I don't have the numbers like you sadly :(, but when I watch the stream often see a lot of $10 and under donations with a few big ones. With DvZ being a minimum of $15 for SJ ($5 a month is good, well be renewing my 12month one in 3 months time) it may have been just a bit out of reach with everything that was going on.  Hopefully we can change your mind when the SJ mode comes down after everything is ready to be shown of fully. Also hopefully you manage to find fun in playing the game to. That alone well probably help bring your passion into life and drag people in. You know the right direction for it really, have shown that time and time again with the games continued life. We all have faith in the game."

DvZ,3bj2b7,zekzava,6,Mon Jun 29 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like this, there's currently there's a lot of repetition in death messages, with some showing in 3 places at once. Especially given that there are more things you need to pay attention to in order not to die, such as armour and gold, it'd be nice to put all the death messages back in one place.  If special mob kills were put in chat, then you could do something more unique with the action bar such as showing who you killed or were killed by."
DvZ,3bj2b7,Tomlough,2,Mon Jun 29 17:38:52 2015 UTC,Maybe have a command to disable the death messages like /chat so it wouldn't get in their faces if they play on windowed mode.

For those that say it was idiotic you would be correct and in forethought I should have built that wall on the sides instead of the front so it would have no harm to the gameplay which was never my intent. Again I know this is a team game and this action may have annoyed some but at the same time it had amused others and as I perceived allowed some one to facepalm but chuckle in enjoyment. All in all I apologize if the actions detracted from others enjoyments of others and I will try to be more considerate in the future.

DvZ,3bh4es,TheDrCreeps,6,Mon Jun 29 05:36:14 2015 UTC,"Armour shred is already in the darkness and light. So I was suggesting that Armour shred would only be in the dark, until you get the final upgrade what lets it work in the dark, and light. So instead of  almost hiving all the player zombies with Fury of the Night, and Armour shred that works in the dark, and light. They would have Fury of the Night, and Armour shred that only works in the dark, or Armour shred that works in the dark, and light, but no Fury of the Night."

DvZ,3bh4es,johnb43,2,Mon Jun 29 07:30:37 2015 UTC,Whenever I play mob I will usually go Zombie. During the night time I will run around smashing torches for my extra mana. This gets me upgraded really fast but when day comes I usually just afk-jump around mob spawn until night time/the dwarves move inside. I find that even with armour shred Zombie during the day can be boring. If I had to choose between these two upgrades then it would make zombie drastically less fun for me.

It's yet another game mechanic that takes something out of control of the dwarves, making it so your are absolutely useless. The shrines are no longer about taking out the monsters to clear the shrine to protect it, but instead it's a time to spam right click with your pickaxe while hoping other people are doing the same to you. Since the shrine room is always filled with monsters that cannot be procced, there is little you can do other than that, or of course kill AI zombies which accomplish nothing since they hardly hurt your armour, you get nothing from it since the removal of scavenger, the leaderboards, and this may not be true but I don't think they drain the shrine power."
DvZ,3bh4es,Tomlough,2,Mon Jun 29 10:53:37 2015 UTC,"Guys the way it's work since the beginning is that dwarves need to stick together and work together if they want to survive the next minute. It wasn't until these past few months that a dwarf could survive on their own thanks to skill and scavenger, and I'm actually relived the game is changing again. All you need to do when an update like this comes out is to change your playstyle, not get upset that your old playstyle doesn't work any more. I personally consider it an opportunity"
DvZ,3bh4es,NikoUY,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"It wasn't until these past few months that a dwarf could survive on their own thanks to skill    Not strictly true, there are quite a few people who are known for the way they used to hold specific parts of maps alone. Or Stef who had the absurd ability to single-handedly defend both sides of Daragor's upper level at the same time. I'm pretty sure it's always been possible and as long as there were leaderboards to make it worthwhile, people did it.  There's no point in Jimmies quibbling over the details of mechanics while they're still being tweaked, which armour shred is."
DvZ,3bh4es,TheDrCreeps,2,Mon Jun 29 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with the mechanic, is just too OP right now, it probably wouldn't be as bad if rebirth was like before (this makes targeting 1 player until runs out of wrenches extremely easy) but still needs some sort of nerf, also procing is a pain as you are likely to take a bunch of explosions while procing because they are hard to see with all the things going on or you just can't get out of the way, everytime I get a decent proc mid/late game my armor is over half dead after the proc and I'm using the extra armor I can't imagine how bad it would be if you are using normal armor."
DvZ,3bh4es,NikoUY,3,Mon Jun 29 07:37:02 2015 UTC,"as said by rob, all numbers are to be tweaked, everything is going to get a buff, or a nerf, whether the ability was UP, or OP."

DvZ,3bh4es,DrLolzworth,2,Mon Jun 29 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"I do know it rips armors into pieces, and I do love that. as a zombie and as a dwarf, As a zombie, I love doing 1k armor dmg every life, an seeing the dwarf's armor break from golden flawless armor to a shredded chains, and as a dwarf, you have to watch your armor more frequently, work together to repair the armor, and keep everyone in check."
DvZ,3bh4es,Lex_L,2,Mon Jun 29 11:11:21 2015 UTC,I think this is a good compromise to the armor situation. I really love the new armor shred mechanic. But I know that a lot of people find it too difficult for wrenchless dwarves.
DvZ,3bh4es,PrivateChicken,2,Mon Jun 29 06:27:57 2015 UTC,"By ""darkness or light"", do you mean night and day? Because the current Fury of the Night is not dependent on light levels, but on the day/night cycle. I doubt we'll return to a light level-dependent mechanic, given how that could be abused by a veteran zombie against a new player."
DvZ,3bh4es,mineman00567,2,Mon Jun 29 08:39:39 2015 UTC,"I think we're more likely to see an armor buff. Personally I don't have any problems playing as Warrior, but Berserker with rune leather gets way too punishing in the keep even with the wrenches. Which is a shame because the keep is where the Berserk is supposed to shine.  And obviously, if you're playing with out wrenches you're kinda screwed as well."
DvZ,3bh4es,Kurvatis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"Besides with golems, I think armor shred should stay exactly the way it is. There's a reason the Warrior class was given 10 wrenches... Currently, Warrior class players are pretty much invincible until their armor gets low. Usually they just wrench it back up and keep on fighting. If we nerfed armor shred in the ways that were said, it would make games take much longer, since there would be hardly any dwarves dying until final. Not to mention, killing players as a zombie takes a certain amount of skill, so not everyone can pull it off."
DvZ,3bh4es,TheRealMasono,2,Mon Jun 29 14:08:10 2015 UTC,"Armor shread is op and I see no reason for it to stay in the state it is right now. It requires every set to have wrenches as without them, even in daylight you can die within 15 seconds by a zombie with armor shread. I get that it's fun to play and I really like that it makes zombie the main powerhouse again, but it still needs some balancing."

DvZ,3bf0mh,AwesomeName7,2,Sun Jun 28 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"So, the map submission process for this summer will be as follows:   Create a new thread about your map. Include screenshots and a download link, as well as any other information you think is important for people to know when reviewing your map. If the community has suggestions or fixes, make those changes. Keep in mind you don’t have to follow every community suggestion. You’re the map maker, you can make the decisions for your map. Once you feel your map is ready, post a reply here. Include screenshots, a download link and a link to the original reddit post you made about the map. You should also include a list of people who made the map and any other information you want to include. You can also make recommendations for the dwarf spawn point, the shrine names, and any other map related information.   In order to make sure we get high-quality maps, and to help the map review process to be as simple as possible, please follow these guidelines:   Maps should have at least two shrines, and at most four shrines, but three is the best number. At a run, without obstacles, the distance between shrines should be about 20 to 30 seconds. Maps need these additional features: weapon and tool placements, a quarry, a gold mine, a blacksmith area, some lumber, and a lumber mill. The best way to learn how to make these is to just go play a game of DvZ with your texture pack turned off. Maps tend to work best if there is one primary route as well as some secondary routes to give the monsters some options. The main route through the map should be as clear as possible so players don’t get easily lost. Between the monster spawn and the first shrine, monsters need some protection so they can progress toward the forward wall without being constantly hit with arrows. Do not worry about the indoor bow mechanic. Bows will be changing with the summer update. Do not worry about oil placement for Roamin. Roamin's recharge mechanic will be changing with the summer update. Make sure your bedrock is in good shape. Remove all other blocks and make sure the main paths around the map are still usable even with other blocks gone. Be especially careful with stairs, it’s easy to forget the bedrock under the bottom stair.    EDIT: Formatting"

DvZ,3baivr,MastermegaGamer,3,Sat Jun 27 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"Jake Kaufman might be a reasonable guess as well.  Him, Rob and the other buffalo wizards already know each other from the Unforgotten Realms Live Nuren campaign.  They worked pretty well together on that project, so maybe they want to work with each other again.  Plus Jake has already made a custom soundtrack for Coestar COE-OPERATION so I wouldn't be surprised if he came with Coe's recommendation (if rob had been asking around if anyone knew a good composer)."

DvZ,3bc5ou,MastermegaGamer,10,Sat Jun 27 20:38:39 2015 UTC,Not sure on either of them. Looks a bit too futuristic? Not sure what it is but the highlighted edges are not going for me
DvZ,3bc5ou,Tebotron,4,Sat Jun 27 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"They look like they'd fit in well for satellite outpost, but maybe a little out of place elsewhere.  That's not to say I don't like the textures though! They definitely look nice regardless, both of them."
DvZ,3bc5ou,figsandthings,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"I was roughly basing my design off of armour from the italian renaissance, but with such a small texture most of the fidelity is lost, and upscaling to a 256x256 iron golem texture is not something I particularly like the idea of. I understand your point, but to me anything is better than the default texture."
DvZ,3bc5ou,Overhighlord,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:25:20 2015 UTC,The second one does look like it has plated armor.
DvZ,3bc5ou,NaquIma,2,Sun Jun 28 07:18:04 2015 UTC,I like the lighter one. It actually looks like its made of iron. EDIT: XD its 50-50 because of my vote
DvZ,3bc5ou,Overhighlord,2,Sat Jun 27 21:32:44 2015 UTC,I prefer the first one.

DvZ,3bc5ou,PopePan,2,Sun Jun 28 07:20:03 2015 UTC,"The second option strikes me as rather holy while the first fits a bit more thematically with the monster side. That said, I'm not convinced either of them are made of iron."
DvZ,3bc5ou,Nightmaresplody,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:26:39 2015 UTC,I prefer the lighter coloured one personally. The gold on the darker one stands out a bit too much for me.
DvZ,3bb2m6,jujug28,4,Sat Jun 27 14:45:22 2015 UTC,"From Rob's video, I think he'd expect newer players to unlock a different class rather than a different item (especially as they'd have to unlock an awful lot of items just to get something approaching the warrior class they're leaving behind), unless you want to design a class around this item. Personally, I'd probably recommend going for the ranger class to someone in this situation, as they can get used to healing themselves and practise on others, whilst spending most of their time out of immediate danger."
DvZ,3bb2m6,MillicentOak,2,Sat Jun 27 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"As with every suggestion, numbers are subject to tweaking (300 strikes me as very steep,but I don't know the game terribly well). But I really like the idea! Aside from the intimidation of switching, there's the matter of the current system allowing the sort of instant-death the Rob spoke out against (for DvZ) in his video when a player first tries to transfer."
DvZ,3bb2m6,Draken09,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:24:39 2015 UTC,We could split hairs all day long on exact numbers. My theory was it should be a deterrent from letting your health run all the way out without being too overwhelming.  I would say most players heal at 8-10 hearts remaining.  A heal that costs 100 mana to heal 10 hearts and a savior heal that costs 200 mana to heal 20 hearts would be too generous imo. People would rely on the save to heavily.
DvZ,3bb2m6,Awesomeshafter,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:32:56 2015 UTC,"Add some sort of ""intermediate juice"". This juice would function like the standard healing ale. It would heal to full health whenever clicked, and could possibly give to hearts of absorption. If the player runs out of health he gets automatically healed by the ale but gets charged 300 mana or something. (Enough to hurt him but not screw him over entirely.) This would provide learning players the incentive  and self reliance of healing manually, but still give him the safety net of auto heal.    Umm holy ale that doesn't heal around you?  Oh and costing 300 mana is waaaay too much. You would have to be an archer."
DvZ,3bb2m6,Tomlough,5,Sat Jun 27 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"That's not the suggestion. The suggestion is for a version of the normal manual healing ale, which would auto-heal you if your health got too low but would charge you more mana if it did so. The extra mana cost would only apply when you auto-heal, not if you heal manually.  Its purpose would be for people who start playing the game with the Warrior class now and learn how to play with the Jimmy Juice, but find the switch from Jimmy Juice to manually healing too intimidating and want a safer way to practice healing manually. So you don't need to worry about instantly dying if you fumble while trying to heal, but you'll certainly be motivated to learn how to heal manually rather than fall back on the auto-heal due to the significantly higher mana cost."
DvZ,3bb2m6,Awesomeshafter,2,Sat Jun 27 15:49:16 2015 UTC,Exactly.
DvZ,3bb2m6,ArchasTL,-2,Sat Jun 27 17:15:58 2015 UTC,I guess that makes sense. I barely read it to be honest. It's a good idea.

DvZ,3b8zmg,Tomlough,20,Fri Jun 26 23:10:37 2015 UTC,"Really appreciate the insight he's giving us into his thought processes and ideas for the direction of the game. Also like how he's acknowledging the different wants of different groups, imo shows a great deal of understanding on his part. Some of the stuff like weekend events sound awesome too, definitely looking forward to that!  That being said, not sure one three-hour slot on a weekend (which is typically peak time anyway) is really a good way to gauge interest from the YouTube audience, especially considering that for a lot of people (moreso in the case of those who are fans of him on youtube) the presence of rob himself might be seen as a bigger draw than the game itself. Regardless, it'll be interesting to see if there's a notable increase of new names on the server and if those numbers stay raised."
DvZ,3b8zmg,ewokaro,2,Sat Jun 27 01:09:56 2015 UTC,Maybe the real test is what happens after the weekend. He is trying to get people to play on the server again just like he said he would.
DvZ,3b8zmg,zzCratoszz,7,Sat Jun 27 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"I get that, hence why I said it'll be interesting to see how long people stick around."
DvZ,3b8zmg,ewokaro,10,Sat Jun 27 01:17:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a three hour time slot, it's the people who sign up to participate in a 3 hour time slot. I could have just skipped that part of the video, but by giving people a time and a goal to shoot for, they feel more compelled to shoot for it.  We have had more people buy Super Jimmy in the last 2 hours then we have had in a week and while you can claim that's purely because of the video and not a challenge and argue however you like about it, the fact is DvZ needs to become more popular for me to continue to keep justifying the AMOUNT of time I spend on it. I did this big summer update in hopes to rejuvenate the community and I would not have done it if I thought it was going to flop with a majority of my audience. This is something you guys don't want me to be wrong on, because it would mean DvZ is winding down which I don't think any of us want."
DvZ,3b8zmg,Rurikar,8,Sat Jun 27 01:46:54 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear about the super jimmy purchases! I was just saying that drawing data solely from the time slot you mentioned in the video wouldn't make much sense, and I'm glad you're not doing that."

DvZ,3b8zmg,CopyCatJ,9,Sat Jun 27 02:23:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit unsure about the whole album thing. Obviously some people will enjoy it but I'd rather see the server go back into non-SJ only mode so that everyone can play. We've not been told about any of the costs for anything which is why this is pure speculation, but surely it would be wiser to make sure the server is capable of handling a large influx of new players if it goes back into non-Sj mode, rather than spending a chunk of the SJ's money on some songs?"
DvZ,3b8zmg,ScottishViking,18,Sat Jun 27 00:50:42 2015 UTC,"Expanding the server past what we have is a massive cost increase, it's not as simple as just throwing money to buy more servers. We simply aren't going to do this as it will most likely never make sense unless the population of the server was just constantly maxed all the time. The cost is such that right now, me and Nisovin aren't worried about if it can or can't make the money each month to keep it up, expanding it would make this a real issue if we see a summer rush into a fallout again afterwards. You have already seen the money go back into the server, that's what this summer update is. Brucesgym had much higher costs because it was built to be expanded on but didn't gain the people again and your now telling me you believe it would be wise to expand before the money is even there to expand.  General fans of DvZ need a reason to get behind and support the summer update. By issuing the challenge I did, a lot of people will check out DvZ to show their support because they like the idea of music for the game and videos, if I didn't propose that, they might not have bothered. You're telling me it would be wiser to spend money that wouldn't exist on non music when it's music that will bring in that money."
DvZ,3b8zmg,Rurikar,2,Sat Jun 27 01:22:13 2015 UTC,I would guess this is a ratio issue. They are most likely trying to find the best ratio of largest space and solid connection with the amount of money it would cost to run such a server. Keep in mind that this is no longer the PlayMindcrack Server. This server runs off of two people. Not twenty some odd Youtubers and Patron Donations.

DvZ,3b8zmg,Awesomeshafter,3,Sat Jun 27 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"Can't imagine that being much of a surprise. :p  With regards to the video, I really agree that new/casual players have been in need of protection against veteran monsters. Too many times, I've seen this in chat in the first 5/10 minutes after monster release:    New_Player_X has been killed by LexLuster using Makeshift Blade <LexLuster> gg New_Player_X has left the game    Those kind of kills never gave me a sense of accomplishment (because beating newbies is not difficult) nor satisfaction (because knowing that New_Player_X is probably never coming back is actually pretty sad).   Jimmy Juice and some of the other changes aim to remedy the inherent unfairness of a fight between a veteran and a new/casual player. I think that is a good direction for the game, and I hope the support is there to justify pursuing this direction further."
DvZ,3b8zmg,Lex_L,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:34:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, but also /hub is better.  Killing new players and them leaving is just part of the process. You are progressing in the game as you were intended to. The fact that there are weak dwarves kinda fits with RP. The new player was a weak dwarf that was inexperienced in  fighting.   If they can't take death, maybe this isn't the game for them. You die literally every game in DvZ.   Jimmy juice is great for inexperienced players that haven't developed reflexes from years of experience like you and I might have although, we want new players to join DvZ. The server hasn't had many people on and we don't want them to shy away from the game because they can't heal and die in 6 seconds after mob release.  That being said, it is very hard to kill a player with Jimmy Juice as a monster. If a -creeper- goblin goes off when he has 6 hearts, then maybe (they heal at 5 hearts now, right?)  Btw, how do you do the crossing out effect on here?"
DvZ,3b8zmg,Awesomeshafter,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"Killing new players and them leaving is just part of the process. [...] If they can't take death, maybe this isn't the game for them.

Also thanks for the info  Also, new players dying isn't good or bad, it happens every game to all of us. Them dying early is just because they did something wrong and in the rp, they are weaker, inexperienced dwarves. Like they are. Not having correct reflexes sucks but it happens.  I think why I contradicted is I said new players die and Jimmy juice makes them hard to kill. New players are ridiculously OP with the Jimmy juice when they use it. some jimmies might pick like berserker and not realise it doesn't have Jimmy juice but a manual ale. This is just an error that comes from them not knowing what's in classes, but that's not really a fault of the system.   I probably messed up again, but that's what I do I suppose."
DvZ,3b8zmg,Doom_BringerMC,2,Sat Jun 27 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"The fact that there are weak dwarves kinda fits with RP. The new player was a weak dwarf that was inexperienced in fighting.    No it doesn't. The RP is that it's the final stand of the last remaining Dwarves, them being the last remaining implies they've survived to be that. Dying immediately would go against that along with the general idea that Dwarves are meant to be extremely over-powered.   If they can't take death, maybe this isn't the game for them.   Death occurs in the vast majority of games, it's not the fact they died it's the nature in which they died. As mentioned previously they're meant to be very powerful, if they die to the first monster they see in a matter of hits, it's an extremely underwhelming and disheartening experience.

Personally, I prefer and enjoy a more competitive game, but at times I do favor roleplaying. The last DvZ version was almost all competitive gameplay in while I found it extremelly hard to roleplay. The new update has completely changed that. I think the best option for DvZ is to integrate the competitive side and roleplaying side of the game and not completely remove the competitive side. It's fine to make the game more favorable to roleplay, but there still needs to be a competitive aspect. If DvZ has both of these in it, I'm sure it will draw in more players than it would as a purely roleplay game."
DvZ,3b8zmg,5ilver42,2,Sat Jun 27 15:26:27 2015 UTC,I personally loved watching Rob do DvZ stuff. The actually playing the game is still a fairly casual thing for me.

DvZ,3b8zmg,Wifi_LC,8,Sat Jun 27 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"Most of the first part is explaining the motivation behind the implementation of things like Jimmy Juice (accessibility for casual players) and then summarising each of the new dwarf weapons and the monster changes.  The second part of the video is Rob talking about the community, how he is trying to make the game more accessible so he can invest time to make DvZ content for his channel but hardcore players dislike his changes. He said that if his viewers max the server in SJ-only mode this Sunday after the LoM parade, he will know there is enough interest in DvZ from his general audience to put the time and effort into making DvZ content for his channel. Otherwise, there's not enough interest from the general audience and he will put the focus back on what the DvZ community wants.  Apologies for any bad paraphrasing."

DvZ,3b9lal,firebolt8900,3,Sat Jun 27 02:37:30 2015 UTC,"Tying very loosely into this, my favourite thing by far about this update has so far been Bruce's new speech when the monsters are released. It's the first time since the original Choose the Night/Death Fears Me animations that I think something's really captured the weight of the battle each game of DvZ represents.  I can get behind weird new Jimmy-friendly mechanics if they also come with cool roleplay stuff like this. This is exactly what I want from the game, because I don't need things like a new gold system to prompt me to defend a shrine if I know I'm playing a roleplay game where I'm a dwarf who cares about the shrine above all else.  There's so much potential in the simplest aspects of DvZ lore which is rarely used to its full potential. I'd love to see more of this stuff in build phase especially. The dwarves know they're going to die, they know they have limited time to construct defences as best they can before the demons come. They're working frantically to fortify the shrine while looking over their shoulder for death. And they don't run, they don't plead, they give their dying moments to protect their shrine because that's the most important thing to them. It's terrifying."

And then the gold was gone. :P  I know I looked at the basic classes and each had individual elements I was interested in, but also things I didn't like the look of (e.g. when I saw the options, I assumed I'd like ranger, then realised it came with the poison blade and no proc and changed my mind) so I haven't unlocked any of them at this point.  Instead I have wiggly wrenches unlocked, which are probably going to sit there unused now since the new armour changes mean I never have to think about repair at all."

IMHO that would remove the saving-up-so-you-can-buy-awesome-upgrade aspect of out-of-game upgrades.  Sorry for over-enthusiastic use of hyphens."
DvZ,3b5u1n,Alderdash,3,Fri Jun 26 09:43:26 2015 UTC,"Och yes, you're right there. I think that it still comes from a place of ""oops I spent all my money and now the game has changed"" though. :D"

I think it's balanced because if you cash it back, you get the gold YOU EARNED back. Which makes sense cause if you don't get the gold you worked for.... that just isn't right..."
DvZ,3b5u1n,MillicentOak,3,Fri Jun 26 14:09:49 2015 UTC,"Just to say, Mill didn't say that it was ""too OP"". He said ""Which I think is what OP"" describes. I think he was going for ""OP"" as ""Original Post"" not ""overpowered"".   ...he might've accidentally a word, though."
DvZ,3b5u1n,Alderdash,2,Fri Jun 26 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"Aye, as Alder says, OP meant original post ;)  I would point out that out-of-game upgrade systems are typically meant to get people to come back and play more to unlock more goodies. I can't say if that's Rob's intention, but given that it worked that way with the June update upgrades, I wouldn't be surprised to see that approach carried forward. That said, there's plenty of change going on, and I'm not taking anything for granted!"
DvZ,3b5u1n,Rurikar,0,Fri Jun 26 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"So... I'm assuming you agree with my POV? Cause from the look of it, you are saying you spent your gold on wriggly wrenches, which is a waste, so do you want the refund option or not?"

What's fair is that we refunded ALL of your gold from old systems into the new system. You spending it all is a goofy thing to do and you're stuck with what you bought. You don't need ""custom"" classes, they are for long term progression for players and more than likely you'll want most if not all the upgrades for messing around with builds in the future.  If you could refund upgrades, what would be the point of having any form of progression? Once you have enough gold, you just move your gold around into classes. Looks like you got a lot of games to play fluffy and hopefully you learned a real life lesson about spending your money too fast on things you don't understand!"
DvZ,3b5u1n,Doom_BringerMC,4,Fri Jun 26 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"Will there be a bulk refund at the end of the ""beta"" period like the one when the new system was introduced (as in, all upgrades refunded, not a choose upgrades to refund like the OP is asking)?"
DvZ,3b5u1n,rstd2,8,Fri Jun 26 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"No, but it is something I will consider and talk with Nisovin. You should assume there will be no refund though."
DvZ,3b5u1n,MasterOfSpasms,4,Fri Jun 26 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"I think at the end of the day its just a matter of us buying stuff we didn't really understand the mechanics of completely or didn't realize how useful they would be at the time, but we still consciously made the decision to buy those upgrades and its probably better to just let them sit there collecting dust instead of running the risk of people abusing a refund system (Though, if there was a refund system, it shouldn't be a 100% refund).  Personally I like the idea experimenting with different combinations of upgrades but unfortunately don't have many options to choose from at this point because I don't have the gold for it, so I'm fine with having ""junk"" upgrades sitting around in case I ever decide I want to play with them."
DvZ,3b5u1n,PickShark,-1,Fri Jun 26 11:09:51 2015 UTC,"Figs, I agree and disagree. I agree on part of the first sentence. Then halfway through, I was thinking, how in the world would you abuse this kind of system? (Unless it's a glitch) But I also think that unless there is an ongoing glitch that gives u back more gold than you bought whatever item u want to cash back for, there is no need to not have a 100% refund."

DvZ,3b4z0o,ArchasTL,3,Fri Jun 26 01:12:44 2015 UTC,"To be more precise, the crossbow is essentially a semiautomatic bow with projectiles that travel faster and with less arc than a normal bow shot, but have significantly lower range. Each crossbow bolt does about 12 hearts of damage, but the bolts regenerate more slowly than normal arrows will.  Crossbows are best suited for very accurate burst damage at closer ranges than longbows, because of their quicker firing rate, greater precision, and ease of use."

DvZ,3ay5pm,Doom_BringerMC,6,Wed Jun 24 15:22:51 2015 UTC,"The most interesting thing about these are the ""NoProcWarning"" and ""NoManaWarning""; it looks as if there will be events that prevent healing and procing."
DvZ,3ay5pm,Rurikar,13,Wed Jun 24 13:27:14 2015 UTC,"They are Monster Events that come with the drums. All the monsters spawn together in one huge wave with a big debuff on the dwarves. Right now the debuff time is 3 minutes, but like all numbers we need to play test it to see if its where we would like."
DvZ,3ay5pm,ArchasTL,9,Wed Jun 24 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"Now, this I like. As a player who plays monster in almost every game, it sure feels as though monsters aren't too impactful on the game (I know this is by design), but something like this feels like a rallying cry for the monsters. I love the concept of an event where the bad guys get a significant period of time to do some real damage, and the dwarves are forced to hunker down and hold the line, or die/lose the shrine. I'm a big fan of this idea, and I can't wait to see the in-game implications.  Obviously, there are variables to test, like the effect/potentcy of the debuff itself and the duration/frequency of the event, but I have high hopes."
DvZ,3ay5pm,mineman00567,3,Wed Jun 24 15:53:18 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome! I can't wait to test that out in some games.
DvZ,3ay5pm,Overhighlord,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:34:05 2015 UTC,I think the No Ale event definitely needs to be shorter than three minutes.
DvZ,3ay5pm,TheRealMasono,2,Wed Jun 24 19:59:00 2015 UTC,Well we can't judge what we don't know and I'm sure rob knows how to balance it.
DvZ,3ay5pm,ArchasTL,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:03:24 2015 UTC,I think he means no mana regen for 3 minutes
DvZ,3ay5pm,Doom_BringerMC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:52:13 2015 UTC,In battle without mana regen for 3 minutes is harsh.
DvZ,3ay5pm,ArchasTL,5,Wed Jun 24 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is. And that's good! A lack of mana regeneration for three minutes (or whatever the time may be; remember, these variables still need to be tested) is not inherently bad for the game, and is certainly not unsurvivable. It just means that you need to adapt to an unpredicted circumstance. You have a bow, you have blocks, and you have the human characteristic known as thinking. Put them to use, and you'll be a little worse for wear, but still fine.   When the game holds your hand really tightly as it is with things like Jimmy Juice and longbows, having periods of uncertainty and danger is a good thing. The problem I have with the update as it stands is that there is a distinct lack of tension; there's no suspense, no real danger of dying unless you fuck up on an astronomical level. Something like no-mana-regen and no-repairing events serve to inject that tension back into the game, and makes it more dynamic and certainly more interesting.  (As a side note, we need a name for these proposed dangerous random events. I offer the term ""Crisis Event."" Any objections?)"
DvZ,3ay5pm,TheRealMasono,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you Archas, I was thinking about meelee combat when I made my post. If I was fighting in meelee with no mana regen, I would probably die due to lack of mana in around 30 seconds."
DvZ,3ay5pm,TheDrCreeps,8,Wed Jun 24 23:15:49 2015 UTC,I think that's the idea.
DvZ,3ay5pm,Wifi_LC,4,Wed Jun 24 23:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as Doom put it, that's the whole point. These crisis events should be a means of rewarding quick thinking and short-notice adaptability; doing the same thing you were doing beforehand can and should get you killed. I am quite fond of the idea of measuring a player's worth by his or her ability to react appropriately in different circumstances, especially if they can do so quickly.  I wouldn't expect anyone to continue their melee hacking and slashing once a no-mana crisis event happens, and would be astonished if they made it work; the entire purpose of these events is to make life more difficult for the dwarves so that the monsters may pursue an advantage."
DvZ,3ay5pm,keaganwill,2,Thu Jun 25 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"But like rob said, all that stuff is going to need to be played out first before we can really start to balance it"

DvZ,3aqqmr,Sekka3,5,Mon Jun 22 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"I have many comments and questions for you.   The map has WAY TOO MANY colors. Just looking at it hurts my eyes. Try to stick with only a few colors, like woods and different types of stone.   The surrounding wall is very low and could use a lot of work and finer detail. The amount of detail in the builds are very low. Detail is important. Many of the structures in the map, such as the shrine, as very... plain and small. The terrain could use more hills and dips, instead of being one, big, flat plain. Spacing is crucial in a DvZ map. The ideal runtime between shrines, without obstacles(such as Proc Halls), should be 20 - 30 seconds. Everything looks claustrophobic and poorly done. Wait.... a sewage treatment plant is a dwarven stronghold..... I thought we were in medieval times.... o_o   These are just my opinions and feel free to change your map accordingly.  -LordCluckles"

DvZ,3aqqmr,Aragoth_,4,Wed Jun 24 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"A couple of thoughts:  1) would be nice to see as requested with the texture pack on  2) Invisible walls are a bit cheap, try to get some steep hills in and then delete all the chunks outside of it to prevent escapees. It just feels a lot more natural that way.  3) I like the destroyed gate idea, not sure about the goo eating the iron blocks but I can roll with that.  4) The sewers look ok in vanilla bedrock texture, but might not with the dvzbedrock texture (dirt) on. Might be worth expanding them to add detail blocks.  5) I have a bit of a problem with the block palette. Variety is nice, but you've thrown every block in the game at it in places and it doesn't look nice. This is just my opinion but it isn't too pretty in places. In some it looks fine (red wall and blue wall either side is neat) but in others it's overly busy and not easy on the eyes.   I'd prefer to see a coherent colour scheme throughout.  6) The map is pretty narrow. This means that a good density of dwarves along the frontlines which puts mobs at a disadvantage.   7) It's too early in the new edition to work out the balance of maps, so keep playing games and seeing which sections of the current maps work and which don't to get an idea of how to make areas work gamewise.  8) ""hills rose around the area with invisible walls, preventing Dwarves from escaping."" Ok now this is the nit-picking one from me, this is a bit of a weak excuse for the dwarves to stay and fight. This doesn't feel at all epic as a reason."
DvZ,3aqqmr,Overhighlord,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:48:06 2015 UTC,"I'll get to work on decorating the sewers. Also, the pit's canals/sewers have to have bedrock to prevent water from splooshing through.  I'll try to make the front wall more advantageous for the mobs. Any suggestions for that?  I might try to do something about the ridiculous block clutter. As for a color scheme, I might do Dark Oak, stone brick, & prismarine with a dash of other blocks."
DvZ,3aqqmr,Th3A1ph4D0g,2,Tue Jun 23 00:19:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about making it ""advantageous"" for mobs until we really know what that means. With dwarves not meant to die as such we don't know what this means yet."

DvZ,3ao92k,Doom_BringerMC,4,Tue Jun 23 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think accessibility is just as important as quantity in terms of gold, if you put it in an open and easy to reach place you're naturally going to have a higher gold count even if it's less gold than on other maps. For example maps like Archives and Mount Willakers where the gold is part of the quarry and more concentrated towards the bottom rather than the top you see a lot of games with low gold counts, even though they have quite a lot of gold in them, and if you compare that to maps like Belly of the Beast or The Machine where the gold is either separate or more accessible in the quarry they tend to have naturally high gold counts. And even with accessibility, we saw on the game Rob recorded on Mt. Willakers, we had 3,000 gold in the vault before monsters were released. The other thing to consider is that the Gold isn't evenly divided between your shrines, either Nis or Rob mentioned that Gold division will differ from map to map so one shrine will more than likely hold more gold than the others, most notably Mt. Willy has more gold in its final than the other 2 shrines giving it an extended last stand. I think depending on how your shrines are designed will depend on which shrine they decided to put the most gold into. In terms of spreading out resources you don't want to have the issue Friendship Town 4 had in that it was very confusing for new players to learn and quite annoying to obtain resources for, having multiple quarries lead to it running out in one place and players assuming all the gravel had gone. You're much better off concentrating gravel in one place and maybe having a second quarry if the map warrants it. In terms of Gold positioning I think it's best to have it all at or by first. In terms of quantities I think you have the right amount of Gold, Gravel should be fine too assuming you're not expecting players to do a lot of building."
DvZ,3ao92k,5ilver42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:55:30 2015 UTC,"I'll have the gold in a mountain spread everywhere in it. The gravel will be in a side entrance to second... with a cave-in of gravel so players are more likely to discover the gravel by digging through the cave-in.    Edit: The idea I have for the hallway is Hidden Valley-like (tall roof, 7 blocks wide), so I might need a little more gravel. There's also a giant pit, so I might need some gravel for Dwarves to pillar up, but said pit has four entrances up: A maintenance shaft (using this is suicide), a red sandstone staircase (might be a little dangerous), & the two sewers. The only issue I see is Knockback skeletons sitting on the stairs/near the sewers & preventing Dwarves from getting out. When this happens, the Dwarf under attack will probably need a bit of help to get out"
DvZ,3ao92k,ArchasTL,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"I've heard people say 2k to 3k is optimal gold, but with the update now, I think placement is just as important as the amount. At what shrine progression point are they safe to mine from? I can see having a main deposit by first and another smaller deposit(s) between the last two, allow for the possibility for dwarves to hold shrines longer...  I could see some situations where this can be good and others where it could be bad."
DvZ,3ao92k,5ilver42,3,Mon Jun 22 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely with the idea that gold deposits should be secure locations. At this point in the game, where dwarves are virtually invincible with gold, it should be MORE difficult to get it, not less. Im fact, I would say that if there are any extra gold deposits (there shouldn't be), they oughta be in a very dangerous or remote place where the odds of dying are high.  Let's not make it even easier for dwarves to maintain their gold count, when dwarves are already so obscenely powerful and survivable."
DvZ,3ao92k,ArchasTL,2,Mon Jun 22 12:38:49 2015 UTC,"I suppose I didn't articulate my thoughts that well. I agree with you on the gold needing to be in potentially dangerous places. I had the map I'm working on in mind, and have my secondary gold area spread out by final in a very large, dangerous, lava filled cavern."

DvZ,3an7l0,ArcaneWarrior303,9,Sun Jun 21 21:46:24 2015 UTC,I'm not swayed by anything that's been shown so far in terms of 3D models.
DvZ,3an7l0,Doom_BringerMC,6,Sun Jun 21 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"I think my first response to 3D item models in Minecraft was seeing stuff in Warlords, and that response was vague surprise. But I find they look really out of place in Minecraft, and they certainly don't make Warlords fun."
DvZ,3an7l0,MillicentOak,3,Sun Jun 21 23:28:38 2015 UTC,"they seem cool at first, but after a while, it seems wierd. but I think the main reason is so that they can use any item. currently berserker axe looks like a item, but with the 3D pack, you can make it look like a weapon!"
DvZ,3an7l0,TheDrCreeps,5,Mon Jun 22 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"You can make it look like a weapon without being 3D, in fact, making it 3D doesn't fix it's held position they both require the same changes to the JSON file."
DvZ,3an7l0,Doom_BringerMC,6,Mon Jun 22 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"I really dislike the idea of using 3D models in Minecraft, and hope they don't become too prevalent in DvZ. They're really taxing on low-end computer framerates; even my own computer, which handles DvZ very well, will struggle with servers like Hypixel which makes judicious use of 3D models in their gamemodes.  The aesthetics of 3D models for items and equipment are entirely subjective; if Rob likes how they look, and a significant portion of this userbase does too, then an argument declaring the items in question to be ugly (and therefore subject to removal) is not a credible one. However, lackluster framerate as a result of these items is a documented and objective truth, and I hope the novelty of such models does not blind Rob to the downsides of using them."
DvZ,3an7l0,ArchasTL,5,Mon Jun 22 17:12:11 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to find the exact quote but got bored and given up, but at some point back on PMC someone complained that the DvZ update had caused the game to run poorly on their PC, and Rob's reply was something to the effect of ""we've made the decision to make big epic games at the expense of catering for people with low-end computers"". With DvZ's recent updates moving further and further away from vanilla Minecraft in search of an epic feel, I assume this still applies.  As I say, I can't find the exact quote (it may even have been something he said in-game) but here are two related links: 1 2  So, although I agree with you (the best thing about basing the game in Minecraft is that millions of people own and can run it), I'm not sure this is going to make a huge difference to Rob if his mind is already set on how the game should look and feel."
DvZ,3an7l0,Tomlough,2,Mon Jun 22 21:46:19 2015 UTC,Not sure if the quote still exists anymore but Rob said that he did not cater to players that use a toaster to play DvZ.
DvZ,3an7l0,Th3A1ph4D0g,2,Mon Jun 22 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"FPS drops with 3D items? I know it seems obvious, but my computer isn't the greatest in the world and I can handle Hypixels game with relatively little lag. If there is a difference in FPS, then it is so small I cannot detect it. That is just how my computer handles it, yours is a different story."
DvZ,3an7l0,ArchasTL,2,Mon Jun 22 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"My computer is fairly strong, so it takes a very heavy amount of 3D modeling to cause stutter or lag; Hypixel is just one server that came to mind that can potentially cause that, due to its prolific appropriation of 3D models. Regardless of my personal circumstances, I know that several people within the TeamSpeak I frequent have notable issues with lag and FPS in DvZ already, and excessive 3D models would certainly push their gaming experience from ""choppy"" to ""unplayable."" It would be a shame to see that line crossed and make DvZ all but inaccessible to a significant amount of people, all in the name of subjective aesthetics. Whether Rob, or anyone else, likes or dislikes the models is irrelevant, as long as they do not become too prominent a feature in the game, thereby running the risk of performance issues in a game that is already fairly demanding on low-end systems."
DvZ,3an7l0,Alderdash,4,Mon Jun 22 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point, particularly since Rob is hoping to bring in more 'casual' players.  Regulars, if they have trouble, are probably invested enough in the game to either make a texture pack themselves or (me!) know someone they can ask to do so, and partly deal with the issue that way.  Casual players, if they have a difficult first experience with the game, are more likely to just shrug and move on."
DvZ,3an7l0,Doom_BringerMC,2,Mon Jun 22 19:33:22 2015 UTC,"But that is the benefit of it being attributed to the resource pack, you don't have to use them if you don't want to. In fact a lot of players don't use the default resource pack as is, it'd be quite simple to just run a custom 3D modeless one if needs be."
DvZ,3an7l0,Wifi_LC,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:00:06 2015 UTC,If Rob does happen to go through with the 3D textures Pooch has released a 32x32 DvZ pack which is still on the main page of the sub I will link it here shortly

A bit iffy on this, it's cool but the ghast balls aren't that dangerous at all and mobs will spend time with them as opposed to grinding down armour and gold. Similarly with gobo box launchers (may not work as gobo boxes are endstone with spells attached not tnt) and blue brick dispensers seems a bit gimmicky.  Honestly cool ideas but having lots of gimmicks ends up cheapening the map. The map needs to work within the gamemode as it stands.  2) Like the concept of nether first shrine through a portal into the overworld. A nice change-up from the regular progression of things.  3) The lava flows can be used to grief the map hideously. I'd recommend surrounding them with barrier blocks or just removing them because someone, at some point, will grief using them.  Similarly with the giant waterfall. Can cause issues from griefers (sadly they do exist)  4) Gap from mob spawn to first shrine needs to be bigger. Aim for about a 20-30s run time, but you seem to have got that in mind as it is.  5) Ground between first and second seems a bit flat and could use some love as you flesh out the detail on this map.  6) Progression seems a bit jarring in terms of theme. First shrine is themed around a (doomed) nether assualt by the dwarves, the second shrine is on a giant lily flower, the third is a keep, the forth is ice storage. Whilst the keep works in most any progression, the giant lotus flower and ice storage seems a little random progression and theme wise.  I mean, why does the dimensional portal come out into the giant lotus area? Why did they build a big entrance way to hell (replete with skull no less) next to the lotus flower. Wouldn't you want to build it near something a tad more fortified (like a keep).  I like the build ideas but not sure on the thematic progression somehow. It makes for an odd story.  There's a lot of potential here though and I really like the build and theming you've done for the first shrine and the exit from the nether dimension. Would love to see the lore expanded for this one too, because a good lore makes a map more epic and could tie in the shrine progression for me a bit more."
DvZ,3alvxt,Jeromemasterc,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"oh don't worry, I have it set so if a mob gets in, no one can get in, but the mob inside will have to you know..... share. also, the ghast ball doesn't spawn instantly, you need to wait. they won't do too much dmg, just the KB. gobo boxes. Im planning to change it to low-dmg-tnt-with-more-KB. these 2 are going to be how the mobs first take the front lines. as dwarves will be forcefully pushed back to the shrine quickly. some gimmicks I will get rid of, as some... might not help. Thank you, this is the most finished part of the map, and really the most I've worked on! most nether region will be region protected, there will be limited area for the dwarves to build. as it is the nether. the buildable area will be marked with blue glass, nisovin marked them! water fall, and most area around will be region protected. This is supposed to be closer than what it was. this is the home of the mobs, this is where they all come from. think of it like this. dwarves got the drill running, and in the distance, they see this fortress. but, it seems to be coming closer every day. the nether rack I always imagined as something.. fleshy. the whole nether region is alive. pulling the demon fortress closer and closer. until they attacked. I might shorted the distance, as this is going to be short fight. the first shrine only gets 1/5th of the gold, they are limited to where they can build, and there will be stronger mobs spawning, with artilleries and KBs.with not much help. this is a true challenge to the dwarves. and only the mightiest dwarves will fight in the monster's region. this shrine can be not defended and just ditched from the start, or defended, by the dwarves who are looking for a challenge. this shrine is not ment to be kept for days. it's going to be down really fast. that is going to have dwarven camps, assaulted by some... stuff.it's still a work in progress :) a little back story, the portal was built by the sacred mount Bek'Do, (skull was DB's idea) which is yet to be attacked. With the portal built on the mount Bek'do, they needed a front wall. they didn't want to abandon the flower, the symbol of the keep, so they built a front wall to protect the flower, the keep, and the village. The 3rd shrine is the keep, it will be somewhat in the keep, with a view of the court yard. it's more of a king's chamber shrine. 4th is the Ice storage. the reason this is, is that in the old time, there were no refrigerator! so Ice was rare when it wasn't winter, it was more expensive than gold! only the richest of keeps could afford to have a ice storage (actual story in Korea.) this is the most defended, and most fortified place in the keep, and Ice was more precious than gold. what a better place to retreat to than to the most fortified place in the keep!. these all make sense to me because I have the full picture. I will show everyone the full picture, I guess  when the map is done!"

DvZ,3agaf0,LordCluckles,3,Fri Jun 19 22:20:43 2015 UTC,"Couple of quick queries and thoughts.  First up, love the mountain shape.  I can see the enchanted forest, but the first shrine is set on what appear to be rocky plains. Not sure where things are in relationship to one another which makes it harder to judge.  Also an alarming switch from enchanted forest to bare mountain, might want to think about the transition.  Map seems to lack cover, particularly on the staircase which will reduce hand to hand combat due to easy shooting.  Can you give a sense of how big the map is? What are the projected run times between shrines?  That said, it's hard to give ""balance"" advice for the map as the game is in transition. Previously I'd have called it too hard for the mobs, but I'm not sure how to quantify that at the moment given the new attritional mechanics. Certainly not many places for dwarves to panic over.   Sorry I can't be more help, but given the phase of the game it's hard to give quality balancing advice."
DvZ,3agaf0,Tebotron,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:43:45 2015 UTC,"The first shrine is on stone because of the bedrocking technique I use. It will be changed in a later stage to a material more suitable to the environment. The transition between the mountain and the forest is slow and spaced, changing colors in the grass slowly and gradually. The staircase, I believe, is alright. The goblins will have a easy time blowing the dwarves off if they don't construct walls on the stairs. The walls will slightly decrease the ability to shoot easily without getting shot back by skeletons. The shrine on the staircase(Second Shrine) might not be easy to hold because of its position in the mountain. The shrine is on a small cliff. From my experiences on Hidden Valley, the second shrine is somewhat similar on both maps. You can easily get blasted off the cliff by ""gobos"" due the small size of the shrine area. The bare mountain is being worked on. I have planned some springs, bushes, and more aesthetical features both on the mountain and on the map in general. Thanks for your suggestions and comments! They really help a lot!"

DvZ,3a7zrp,Tomlough,5,Thu Jun 18 06:35:59 2015 UTC,"It would be a lot of work for them to add this sort of functionality, even in spectator mode you would still be considered a player in the game and interfere with the plugins that run the game. Besides this, spectators would take up slots meaning actual players can't join who want to play the game properly.  Here's another thread where a spectator mode was suggested, comments may be relevant.  If you want to see what's going on in test games, I think a better suggestion is to familiarise yourself with the members of the community who stream and record regularly. Often if there's a test game there will be at least one person in the game either streaming or recording, but not always posted to the subreddit."

DvZ,3a7172,TitaniumForce,7,Thu Jul 2 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"is it realistic to expect around 200 people to purchase super jimmy and play regularly once Rob posts a video on update dvz?   I am not sure about a video... unless it is a really good video I do not think it will attract anywhere near 200 people.   A stream though could easily attract that many people. If you have seen some of robs recent streams or Urealms you will know that a ton of people donate. Some will donate small amounts, others will donate hundreds. All they have to donate is $15 and then they can get in for any future streams that rob makes within the next 3 months.   I think a stream is the right idea.. although... rob has stated that he does not enjoy doing DvZ streams ;/ ;/ ;/ ;/ ;/  I dont know what will happen ;/"

DvZ,3a7172,TheMCJarhead,2,Fri Jun 19 01:38:37 2015 UTC,"They're not necessarily actively testing though. Rob has said he only gets maybe a couple days a week to do DvZ stuff. And usually when Rob/Nis are testing stuff the traffic goes up anyway. Just recently there was only 11 people online and a game was Forcestarted, that alone filled the game during its progression and the following games had 40+ people in them. From what Rob has alluded to both Him and Nis have a list of stuff they want to try and I'm sure as and when those features are added they'll be people online to try them out."

The only way that games can happen on this moment is if we set a time/date on the Reddit for everyone to join (best time would than be when both EU and US can play), or nis/rob tweets out for super jimmies to join because they will be observing on that moment.  We can also see atm that the wait time is that long that non of us have the time or interest to wait for 30 players, and than is it a non hero game that will put some players off as well."
DvZ,3a7172,Konpaatre1,9,Wed Jun 17 20:07:50 2015 UTC,are there no games to test DvZ.   And it doesn't make sense to bring down the paywall only to bring it back up a week from now either does it?
DvZ,3a7172,Rurikar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:13:40 2015 UTC,The update cycle for this summer is not yet complete. This is something we as players are often forgetting in these threads.
DvZ,3a7172,IllyiaSvara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"Ok rob has asked for patience so lets give him some time. I'm sure all of us know the sheer level of work that is he and nisovin put into their work and projects.  Remember the updates are not complete yet. There is still more to come and change. This was just the start. Nor is it hard to consider it to be so. Remember back on PMC the game easily saw hundreds constantly. While this might have been because of it being on PMC, personally I have to doubt that given back then there were also many games that had huge waiting times.  Rob has a large following. Niso, Deadbones and Romain have a sizeable following. These are people that in the past played DvZ alongside rob in Videos. Now they each have their own channels. I'm sure once rob deems the game to be suitable and the final set of major updates pushed out a video shall arrive. Not long after videos might arrive from the others too.  For all we know Pause might even decide to join in again and put videos on his channel. DvZ was something he always seemed to like doing with Rob just because while it was in minecraft it might as well not be minecraft given DvZ is an entirely different game to the extreme.   It is in noway unrealistic to expect a huge boost of people when the final main update for the summer is pushed, rob and niso deem the game ready and then the videos roll. Remember right now the updates are not done. They are still being worked on alongside other projects. Rob and Niso are doing, have done and shall continue to do a great job. It is not our place to doubt an update that is yet to be fully released. Perhaps when the update is fully complete and released then it may be our place to respond in our thoughts on the matter however right now it's not.  If taking a view of the game currently make it objective and use all the stuff we currently have been told, however keep in mind the current version is like a teaser version of the final(main) update for this summer. Rob and Niso work hard, play hard and do great. Never doubt the Old Man."

DvZ,3a7172,IllyiaSvara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"Given that the update is only partially complete right now, what would be the sense in releasing an incomplete version to people. Think of the stress rob has had from some of the posts about the game from just the few of us who have been able to play this incomplete version. Imagine how much worse it would be if pretty much everyone was here. If just a few created stress imagine how much worse it would be with a load.  There is pretty much no reason to release an incomplete version of an update to the public before it is ready for them. I believe Rob has said if your not ready to just play around right now don't get super jimmy and skip this current period. Yes it was underestimated how long, though this can easily be attributed to workload from all the different projects going on, add on the disheartening responses from a few which we all have seen in rob's videos a few times and his reddit comments does hit his heart since this is his passion.   An incomplete version is of no point to release to the public. The videos on release well easily draw people in. It has every time before. When a big update is done a huge influx enters when rob gets to talking about it and bam server full.  It'll happen again when rob is happy with the update."

DvZ,3a4zke,Tomlough,2,Wed Jun 17 11:57:22 2015 UTC,"According to my stats I'd been jumping around the lobby for over 1.5 hours before I lost the ability to sprint. I don't know if they changed something with hunger in DvZ besides making it visible but I don't recall ever being unable to sprint before, and I spent a lot of time jumping around the lobby on EU PMC."
DvZ,3a4zke,IllyiaSvara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"In normal MC if the hunger bar gets to 3 chunks or below (DvZ its amour huzzah) you can't sprint anymore. I believe thats how Rob/Niso have made it so when the armour is low you can't sprint simply by tying it to the food bar and making it dependant upon the armour health somehow. No idea how mind you but somehow. They just be that awesome.  PMC I believe auto-filled your hunger back up in the lobbies, can't quite remember haven't been there since DvZ moved."
DvZ,3a4zke,Tomlough,2,Wed Jun 17 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"I think not being able to sprint because of low armour is a side-effect rather than intended feature of the new armour system in DvZ, at least I got that impression from the way Nisovin talked about it during the tests.  On PMC I'm pretty sure all of the game lobbies are just part of the game and unique to each game mode, so I don't think the move from PMC specifically would make a difference. (The only change like this I can think of, unless it happened sooner and I didn't notice, was that you no longer see ""You can sneak to return to the lobby"" at the end of the game.)  If I'm guessing why we didn't get hungry in the past, I'd guess that DvZ either prevented hunger entirely or occasionally topped up your food level, and that needed to be removed in order for the new armour mechanic to work. But it could well be that we did get this hungry in the old days and I just never noticed, especially since there was no visible hunger bar.  (This is the kind of trivial stuff that suddenly becomes very interesting when you're supposed to be doing something more productive.)"
DvZ,3a4zke,IllyiaSvara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:14:41 2015 UTC,"I feel I remember rob talking about it somewhere but not entirely certain where sadly :( Though eitherway personally I actually like how low armour also comes with no sprint, least on a RP/Lore mechanic. As the fight wages on dwarves might be a strong hardy race however even they can not fight eternally without becoming ""exhausted"" from prolonged combat. To me seeing the armour degrade and then being unable to sprint, then finally my strength being sapped away (mana loss/noregen) makes complete sense in a RP look at it. Those strong dwarven hero's who fight to the end loose to the unending horde of monsters as the simple fatigue of a final stand takes it's toll. Imagine standing firm at the final shrine, having watched your fellow dwarves be cut down left and right by a seemingly unending wave of monsters yet your still fighting, trying to defend all that the dwarven race has left. Only to slowly realise the horde shall never stop, noticing the cracks in your armour, your muscles starting to get weaker, your movements slower, that gash in you arm just a bit too deep to heal. Slowly the realisation sets in that the dwarves are gone, gone from the world. This is the end, the monsters triumph.  I find it quite a nice conclusion to the dwarven story and last stand rather than just armour broke your dead. I like having the different ""final moment"" stages when I do play as a dwarf (not often mind you since I prefer monster, always have done), it just feels satisfying to my inner story side."

DvZ,39v2o0,firebolt8900,6,Mon Jun 15 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"That game was one of the most fun experiences I've had in this update. I definitely enjoyed fighting in such a small, bare-bones keep as opposed to the massive, sprawling fortresses you'd normally expect on Plains. Surrounded by hills, the shrine was getting ambushed from every direction and it was a constant struggle from the word ""Go"". I had so much fun.  10/10, would struggle with again."

DvZ,39v2o0,Th3A1ph4D0g,3,Mon Jun 15 23:26:27 2015 UTC,We had a similar game on Archives a little bit ago. Rob was making some change where he needed to be at shrine alone. He ordered us to remain in the keep for the game. This led to a torch shortage since there are no saws inside of the keep. We got armour from the interior stations though (probably the only time they have ever been used). This led to a very fun game.

It's great to see some people aren't fed up with the new update, because personally I love the new update just by the portential of it and not making it look bad by ""balance"" issues. DvZ has always been meant to be great and it's nice seeing a post like this. I support this post because it looks fun and brings joy to other people"
DvZ,39v2o0,Tomlough,10,Mon Jun 15 01:20:15 2015 UTC,"While I'm sure your comment is fuelled by positive intentions, this is really more a continuation of the deleted thread from earlier than anything relevant to missing saws on Plains. Without wishing to backseat moderate, I'd caution people from getting into any more debate about the game in general here and also suggest not mentioning balance in threads which clearly don't warrant it. There's been enough nonsense on here today."
DvZ,39v2o0,ScottishViking,0,Mon Jun 15 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like the reason people dont like the update much is not balance, although that is what they blame it on, but that the maps all feel very repetitive with the exception of plains, which has a new challenge every game. I feel like if they added more maps or re-enabled the side rotation more people would enjoy the game in its current beta state, as it wouldn't get so stale so fast."

DvZ,39ovas,_Pixel_Man_,24,Sat Jun 13 09:29:14 2015 UTC,This happens with everymap.
DvZ,39ovas,comkreaperkiller,8,Sat Jun 13 09:43:30 2015 UTC,"My only reason for avoiding Plains more than other maps right now is that every Plains game I've been in has been incredibly long. I wouldn't say it's any more or less fun than any other map, just I don't have a very accommodating attention span for long games like that and I don't like to leave games early if I can help it.  I disagree that it should be removed immediately though. The map rotation will already be changing in the not-too-distant future with the Crassel update so Plains is in theory due to be removed anyway. Perhaps the server would benefit if the odds of Plains coming up were reduced a la Satellite Outpost, but really... there have been people begging for BYOK to come back since the Gym closed. Now the moment a BYOK map is added back into rotation we have people shouting for its removal.  This happens with absolutely every feature/map in DvZ, as soon as something is taken away people never stop talking about it. I have a feeling lots of this is really just faux hipsterism, talking about old features is an easy way to display to Jimmy that you've been playing DvZ longer than them and thus are obviously better in every way, but when we do get something old back at least try to enjoy it while it lasts! If/when Plains is removed, it won't be long before more people start saying they want BYOK maps back.  It should at least be kept until the update is finished and the paywall is removed, so it can be given a fair chance in a proper version of the game, and so that non-Super Jimmies can have the opportunity to complain about what a horrifically boring map it is."
DvZ,39ovas,Tomlough,4,Sat Jun 13 10:26:40 2015 UTC,I agree with most of your points but I still believe some old features of dvz were genuinely better than later ones.  Things like momentum hearts really messed with the feel of the game. Once they were removed my opinion that it was better in older versions was confirmed.   Build your own keep maps are better for roleplay than game play. I think if DvZ videos started coming out with frequency Plains would be a much more appealing map.
DvZ,39ovas,jujug28,5,Sat Jun 13 11:46:23 2015 UTC,"I absolutely believe there are many aspects of DvZ which were better in the past than they are now, I could write an extended essay on the matter. But it would only be applicable to me and really, DvZ has always been a project which has changed greatly over time. If you go watch videos of an early stream game, a Gym-era game and then a June update game, it's obvious from how different they all are that there's no way the next update can keep everyone happy.  For me, I think it's unlikely that DvZ will ever recapture the level of enjoyment it gave me when I first played it. But it's a different game now, and that game's alright, so I still play that sometimes. And I hope that this update brings in new players who are still around in a year's time to fondly reminisce about how much better the game used to be."
DvZ,39ovas,Tomlough,4,Sat Jun 13 12:48:15 2015 UTC,"If we could get the community to RP more, plains would be a lot better.  I already love it and it's one of my fav maps, but RP can make it a lot better."
DvZ,39ovas,Juliandroid98,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:49:11 2015 UTC,Also I think that the previous maps are going to be readded since on the trello it says that the side rotation is going to be removed temporarily.
DvZ,39ovas,Overhighlord,2,Sat Jun 13 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"Please don't blame a single map for these problems, it happens with any map, I've seen it happen with Belly and The machine as well.  It's just that with certain times of the day lots of people need to leave cause it's either really late, have to do irl stuff or have played enough DvZ for the day."
DvZ,39ovas,Juliandroid98,3,Sat Jun 13 11:43:13 2015 UTC,"the problem with BYOK is that people dont like it... and that there are enough of those people that the game is ruined for the people who like it(me)  during test games for plains BYOK worked AMAZINGLY the keeps where very large and brought me back to the original BYOK's, however, now with all the uncaring people the keeps are just meh because ""we dont need a keep"" (due to the new temporary buffed dwarves as well as a dislike for the idea of doing work) and the uncaring dwarves not doing work and just running off and making a second shrine discourages the caring people...  TL:DR some dwarves feel the keep is unneeded due to the balancing of the game in its current state (when its polished BYOK will probably become a lot better)"
DvZ,39ovas,keaganwill,3,Sat Jun 13 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, BYOK on the gym worked a lot better because people did actually care to work, and that was with just 30 people.  But now the keeps are way smaller than they used to be, even with 50 people and a longer build phase."
DvZ,39ovas,Juliandroid98,3,Sat Jun 13 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe BYOK should be specially put into rotation... What i mean is IF they want to stream or record some DvZ, announce that they are doing a BYOK map so people would actually get hyped and play the map right. I don't see a purpose for having this map out if the only real way its going to be played is if its like a test game or something with Rob or Nis and people actual care/are hyped for it."
DvZ,39ovas,ModangerBoy_,2,Sun Jun 14 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"I usually see people leave after test games end, haven't actually seen plains, I have only played on Mt. Willakers and The Machine, I don't get really lucky with map times."

DvZ,39mqa4,Th3A1ph4D0g,7,Fri Jun 12 20:56:48 2015 UTC,I don't think this is a fault of the maps but how the game works now. Shrines repair your armor and are your main defending objective. Why would you defend some other location that doesn't magically repair your armor? It's much easier and safer to defend the shrine since you don't have to worry about your armor when you're there.
DvZ,39mqa4,Nincodedo,6,Fri Jun 12 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"It's not like being able to repair your own armor like it was recently made such a big difference, people still retreated to the shrines and was one of the reasons I didn't liked the game after the move and stopped playing for while, really there are 2 things that make it the way it is, recent maps have no good layouts (except for Archives and maybe Tree, good work to whoever made Archives) and the constant number of AIs.  Before the move once you got inside you were able to hold defences and positons because you were not constantly spamed with mobs that made it so you could actually push forward and hold a positons (not counting the slab issue we had at the end of PMC which could have been easily fixed) instead of being pushed to the limits where mobs can't stand in, you had this at the expenses of time, games were longer (I am one of those that think the game should be around 45 mins to 1 hour 20 mins max, otherwise the game will be forced in some way, but meh) which is not what Rob and Nis wanted after the move so they started making it so the game was forced to end and making it so Dwarves couldn't hold positons for too long because of AIs was a pretty good solution and they probably added the gold sytem we have now to have even more control over that if I have to guess. This created a bunch of problems that I think they are trying to fix now without removing the tiime limit and have fixed to certain point, you have to a certain extend that dynamic back but you still have the time limit, this time instead of time they are doing it at the expenses of Mobs which s not ideal in my opinion but I do have to admit I'm enjoying the game again.  Anyways, I am going to stop talking now otherwise I'll end up making a giant wall of text of me ranting about the game."

Either way, showing the Jimmies what it's like to make this stuff might be a good idea, even without any special commentary and just say, an hour long video of him programming and testing and doing whatever. I don't know, I'd probably be the only guy to watch it."
DvZ,39lahq,Juliandroid98,5,Fri Jun 12 16:59:44 2015 UTC,I'd love to watch something like that as well.  I'd love to see what Rob and Nis are capable of with MagicSpells and I'd be able to learn from them.
DvZ,39lahq,5ilver42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:28:15 2015 UTC,I love the shit out of behind the scenes dev stuff for anything and everything.
DvZ,39jvpl,Rurikar,36,Fri Jun 12 06:13:57 2015 UTC,"I really want to play, because I know you guys need people to play it, for testing purposes. But at the moment, the game is so painfully... uneventful, that sometimes even I can't play the entirety of it and I'm a very very patient man.  I've seen games when it took 2 Minecraft days for monsters to get a first kill, then another 10 minutes for 3 more kills (two good golems) and then the rest of dwarves died in the final shrine already. I monstered, and It was like banging my head against a brick wall. When Wither Skeletons were broken, at least they gave monsters a chance to progress but at the moment, monsters don't pose a threat... at all.  Now, I do not want to sound demanding by saying this, so do not misinterpret me, but If you could just made a small change to even out the difference, give monsters a powerful weapon, you'd get way more people playing and that could give you an opportunity to test all the other aspects of the game. I mean... I'm not really a game developer, this is just a suggestion."
DvZ,39jvpl,FallDamage312,5,Fri Jun 12 06:56:36 2015 UTC,Or just scrap the auto-heal really.
DvZ,39jvpl,FallDamage312,6,Fri Jun 12 07:13:48 2015 UTC,"The auto-heal is actually quite good for those of us who play from Australia and the like with 300 ping. Potting once and spending 300-500 mana or potting 4 times and having it activate 0 times is frustrating. With auto-heal DVZ has been the funnest it's ever been for me.  I can see how with nice low ping auto-heal might seem cheap and not needed, but for the people with high ping it makes a huge difference to game enjoyment."
DvZ,39jvpl,Princess_Pwny,6,Fri Jun 12 07:25:01 2015 UTC,"While I can totally understand that, auto-heal makes people unable to die, which is... not the best option..."
DvZ,39jvpl,FallDamage312,2,Fri Jun 12 07:29:24 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what you are balancing it around. Currently games seem to be balanced more around running out of gold and been forced to fall back rather than explicitly killing the Dwarves. Although it's quite different than what DVZ was a year ago, I don't think there is really any problem with the victory condition changing a little to be more gold-focused.   The shrine-gold system is a good way to implement more steady progression but as the current state of the game is, the primary goal is still to kill the Dwarves but the ""Local"" or ""Current"" goal is to run the dwarves out of gold and prevent more gold collection, then kill the Dwarves. When running the Dwarves out of gold becomes the goal, you loose some of the sense of progression from kills and have more importance on expending gold.   I feel like different people will like/dislike that change in dynamic to different extents , but I personally don't mind the change at all."
DvZ,39jvpl,Princess_Pwny,2,Fri Jun 12 07:41:04 2015 UTC,"Auto heal drains your mana faster than you think, even if it uses 50 mana, it heals early, and damage more than 10 hearts will pass on after the heal, meaning each blasts/arrow/few melee hits are going to auto heal them, and without them getting proc, it is fairly quick until they runout of auto heal."
DvZ,39jvpl,TheDrCreeps,9,Fri Jun 12 08:18:26 2015 UTC,"Auto heal drains your mana faster than you think   I don't know about that, I tested it yesterday. Got my Jimmy juice, and just ran into mob spawn protection and sat there.   Timed it for 85 seconds with all the debuffs, including poison 4, players and AIs hitting me, before I had to run away because I was down to 300 mana and decided I actually wanted to play :P"
DvZ,39jvpl,Imhotep0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:41:56 2015 UTC,"that's when your armor is in good condition, with shrine gold, and high mana with no ogres and 10000 goblins. in late game, Jimmy juice is more likely to kill you than help you. try getting knocked back out to the front wall by ogres, with withers, goblins, and fury wolves hitting you, with no shrine gold, no horn to help you out, and jimmy juice, which will be healing you every 0.25 second, that will get you killed."
DvZ,39jvpl,TheDrCreeps,4,Fri Jun 12 11:37:51 2015 UTC,"I spent a good few minutes in a dark quarry on Plains with a bunch of wolves two days ago and they couldn't really do anything to me. I was able to bowproc a couple because AIs, although at least half of them managed to leap away, so we just ran around each other while I tried to proc AIs. Eventually I got down to 100 mana so I just pillared out. I never actually felt threatened enough that I felt the need to, e.g. box myself in, even though there were impact skellies about who could've sent me back down there."
DvZ,39jvpl,MillicentOak,4,Fri Jun 12 12:25:08 2015 UTC,"I survived with no proc in archives at bottom of 2nd shrine after it fell  with 0 mana and loads of mobs including a golem attacking me, I lasted 5 mins and got out because Jimmy Juice just healed me as I ran around"
DvZ,39jvpl,Mario3573Z,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:43:01 2015 UTC,I was able to at final hold right click with axe and Jimmy juice at 0 mana against the hoard of gobos a wither skeleton and 3 player zombies targeting without any sense of dying nearby... the thing that killed me was a ton of server lag finally having me die at 50 mana aka a number I shouldn't have died to
DvZ,39jvpl,keaganwill,4,Fri Jun 12 13:39:59 2015 UTC,I heal at half health. Auto ale makes me invincible if I act like I normally do. With mana regen and such.
DvZ,39jvpl,Awesomeshafter,2,Fri Jun 12 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"In my experience, my armor getting to the point where I couldn't sprint anymore was what really did me in with the Jimmy Juice. Second Shrine on Mt. Willy ran out of gold so I couldn't repair, and when I tried to get inside I was just getting knocked around by AIs.  The fact that you take more damage as your armor gets lower and the fact that your mana regen is also less effective means that the autoheal definitely has its limitations."
DvZ,39jvpl,figsandthings,2,Fri Jun 12 11:17:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that you take more damage as your armor gets lower   I know it says this on the trello, I believed the same thing, but rob has said that this is not the case :P"
DvZ,39jvpl,Imhotep0,10,Fri Jun 12 12:39:00 2015 UTC,"Wither Skeletons were never intended to be the way they were. Monsters simply put, will not threaten dwarves by killing them in most cases going forward. They will put pressure on them and force objectives.  Monsters that can kill players just means good monsters kill bad players, that's it. Sorry to say, but if that's the reason the game was fun for you, I hope you can understand why it's a self damaging game design I'm just not interesting in keeping around.  It's fun to beat up on newbs, trust me, but the monsters can't really fundamentally kill good players unless they make bad choices without the game being very one dimensional in design. It was not fun to die to a wither skeleton and it always felt unfair. If you aren't enjoying DvZ as a monster right now because you can't kill people, nothing I plan on doing is going to change that unless your reason for disliking monsters is more then just that fact.  If you're a zombie, rebirth makes death not that big a deal. You can target someone down and if they get low enough you can even kill them if they have no real path to retreat.  Skeleton was never suppose to be about killing, but distracting. It still does this. We plan on giving skeletons armor shred so landing a shot is more valuable then a single hit from an AI, but other then that they won't get more powerful in terms of damage.  Goblins are a much more interactive way for dwarves to stop losing their walls without sacrificing any real power. Playing as a sneaky goblin is strong and their bombs give them something other then blowing themselves up to do.  If you don't like these play styles, sorry man. DvZ may end up becoming a game you don't like anymore. Not everyone will enjoy the changes we are making."
DvZ,39jvpl,FallDamage312,37,Fri Jun 12 07:45:07 2015 UTC,"I am not saying I want to beat up anyone. I'm saying that for a desperate dwarven last stand, the game is really dwarf-friendly. Monsters use a teamwork of skelly/goblin knockback to get a guy in a pit with 5 wolves and it's NOTHING for him at the moment.  Dwarves, being unable to die, are dividing themselves  into two fractions: those, who get spawncampy and annoying to the max, and those who don't want to do that and stay behind, doing nothing and getting bored, just waiting for the gold to run out so that the game can actually go on. And if you have good archers, gold runs out.... veeery slowly.  I'm not saying that everybody dying is a good mechanic, but getting stuck in a stalemate isn't one either. I can understand how goblin is fun, I usually go goblin, and they are AMAZING at taking down defences. The problem is, with current Dwarves, defences are not that relevant...  I love DVZ, it's THE game that made me play multiplayer for the first time in my life basically. I know that it has changed a lot since I've started playing, but I never left if, even when most of the people I used to play it with have no interest in it at all. I am invested in it, I'm making maps, videos, I want to like it, and I will, that's why I want these tests to be successful, and that's why I'm trying to convey to you why there isn't as many people playing at the moment. If you are not intending to level out the playing field, I hope that your Saturday video will bring enough players to have more games going.   I care, man."
DvZ,39jvpl,ArcaneWarrior303,4,Fri Jun 12 08:12:20 2015 UTC,"Fall, I have been experiencing some of what you described, and I think that after the Super Jimmy Wall comes down, game will progress a lot faster because most people who have Super Jimmy are veterans and are very good at this game. However, like last Summer Update, I feel that games will end quickly after the server is now free to the public."
DvZ,39jvpl,Tebotron,10,Fri Jun 12 10:19:27 2015 UTC,"I dunno.   New jimmies get the warrior class as a default, with bow proc, prix and Jimmy juice.  Their only way to die is by a) total isolation or b) armour breaking.   Since a is solved by getting a proc or another dwarf saving them (both likely) only armour will see a new player die. And after one or two games they'll get it."
DvZ,39jvpl,Alderdash,8,Fri Jun 12 10:31:07 2015 UTC,"The difference this time seems to be that things like the Jimmy Juice mean the newbies are far less vulnerable. They used to have to spend a few games getting to grips with the mechanics, but if even the new players are much stronger, then the addition of new players might not make as much difference to the game lengths as it did last year.  Also, if you look up at Rob's post there, he says ""Monsters simply put, will not threaten dwarves by killing them in most cases going forward."" So shortening games by taking out the newbies is, by the sounds of it, just not going to be a strategy at all...  (And there's a fair amount of veterans Beyond the Wall with no money to buy Super Jimmy too...)"
DvZ,39jvpl,skppo,25,Fri Jun 12 11:24:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, not being able to die as a dwarf makes the game dull for me as a dwarf too. I don't fight until the game progresses to inside because outside nothing can really kill me. I can always run. Before I was terrified of getting attacked by wolves in the dark. It was exciting.  Now I just feel sad for the poor puppy. Before I was worried that DvZ will end up with only one side having fun. Now I can't really have fun on either side."
DvZ,39jvpl,ewokaro,19,Fri Jun 12 09:09:33 2015 UTC,"Dwarf really is just wait for gold to run out, bye shrine, repeat, wait for gold to run out, last 10 dwarves die in 2 minutes. It's not really interesting or engaging and the replay value seems to have diminished as a result of it. My biggest issue with DvZ before the update was how there were no threats as a dwarf. Now people end up dying, which is good, but only because the number on the sidebar has reached zero. An exception to this is golems in no hero games, but in rob's words games that start at 25 players aren't really dvz anyway, so meh."
DvZ,39jvpl,Splax77,30,Fri Jun 12 11:20:08 2015 UTC,"If you aren't enjoying DvZ as a monster right now because you can't kill people, nothing I plan on doing is going to change that unless your reason for disliking monsters is more then just that fact.   You don't even need to be able to kill someone on your own. But right now there is zero sense of progress outside of the ticking timer above the dwarves' heads known as shrine gold, and if you have a game designed around constantly dying and having no way to make any progress on the dwarves because they are invincible until gold runs out then I can't really say many people are going to find it fun. Monster upgrades mean nothing at the moment, you can be all 3 classes fully upgraded and you can't do anything to kill a dwarf. Literally playing as a monster right now is AFKing waiting around for the gold to run out and then attempting to get a few kills before dwarves need to retreat because of low armor.  There used to be an element of strategy needed on both sides, but right now there is none. The game is 100% predictable in its current state and just by seeing what map it is I could tell you how the game will go. It's just so repetitive (like, you're playing out the same game every time; while it may sound good from a role play perspective, not everyone plays DvZ for the role play. In fact, role play is virtually nonexistent at the moment and in order to really understand how people think of the game you need to play some games on both sides giving no consideration at all to role play) at the moment that even with all the hype surrounding the update I've noticed a sharp decline from earlier in the week in player counts.  Now I do realize there is still a lot of testing and changes that needs to be done before you have the game in a state you are satisfied with, but I am concerned that unless the balance of the game changes a lot DvZ is going to turn into a game too repetitive to have anywhere close to the replay value it had say, a year or two ago.  Please do not take this as hating on you, or your game. I know many others share my concerns, and I have tried to express them as well as possible, but I'm not as good at wording these kinds of things as Fall without it sounding like I'm just shitting on the game. I want to enjoy this game, I really do, and there is a reason I still come back to it even after 3 years and countless hours of my life (and $300) spent on it. Even though it is probably easy for you to just dismiss this as hating or antifan or whatever, just realize that I give these criticisms not because I am trying to hate on the game, but because I care about the game and want it to succeed after the update.  Edit: I figured while I'm responding to you I may as well address the rest of your post.   Wither Skeletons were never intended to be the way they were. Monsters simply put, will not threaten dwarves by killing them in most cases going forward. They will put pressure on them and force objectives.   Maybe you see things differently than me, but this sounds like a terrible idea. I don't know what your vision for the game is or what these objectives might be, but you're really stretching the idea of balance here. If you make the game too easy for one side than neither side will be fun to play as and people's enjoyment of the game only goes down from there. Fall addressed the next part of your post already so I'll skip on that, and also because I actually might hit the character limit with this post.   If you're a zombie, rebirth makes death not that big a deal. You can target someone down and if they get low enough you can even kill them if they have no real path to retreat.   I don't know what game you've been playing, but zombies very rarely get any kills. In fact, zombie is probably the most useless of the three base mobs at the moment. Dwarves have so many weapons that can easily kill you, and jimmy juice/holy ale makes it really easy to live through anything. Zombies probably wouldn't be getting any kills at all if they didn't get credit for AIs doing most of the work considering they're a very trivial non-issue for dwarves. Maybe you've just been targeting really bad players, but unless you're at final it's pretty easy to just retreat if you get low on armor because of how easy zombies are. Have dragon skin bow? Bow proc them. Have crossbow? Shoot them in the face a couple times and they're dead. Have longbow? One shot them. You can even one shot wolves and ogres, specials are totally worthless right now because of longbows.   Skeleton was never suppose to be about killing, but distracting. It still does this. We plan on giving skeletons armor shred so landing a shot is more valuable then a single hit from an AI, but other then that they won't get more powerful in terms of damage.   Well skeleton has never served that purpose very well. Punch skeletons can be a minor annoyance sometimes, but being able to oneshot skeletons combined with them not really doing anything means you can just completely ignore them. I like the new vine system, but other than withers skeletons don't really have any use right now when it is completely trivial to just ignore them.   Goblins are a much more interactive way for dwarves to stop losing their walls without sacrificing any real power. Playing as a sneaky goblin is strong and their bombs give them something other then blowing themselves up to do.   Goblin is a lot of fun to play as, and easily the most useful of the three base mobs at the moment. Their ability to destroy walls is a little overpowered at the moment (oh, a slab? Here let me go vaporize that real quick) and basically makes inside defenses obsolete at the moment, but right now goblin bomb spam inside is the only way to kill dwarves before gold runs out. Nothing else does enough damage quick enough to actually kill dwarves, and even then it's only those without jimmy juice that die.    If you don't like these play styles, sorry man. DvZ may end up becoming a game you don't like anymore. Not everyone will enjoy the changes we are making.   And that's fine. But right now the game is very repetitive and boring, with almost no replay value. Once you've played all the maps once or twice, that's it. You've played everything DvZ has to offer right now, and unless balance gets a major overhaul from its current state you will be seeing record low player counts once the initial update hype dies down.   It's very important to be able to recognize the difference between a few people that don't like the direction the game is going in, and everyone trying to tell you that the game is getting worse and more repetitive. Obviously I have no way of knowing what exactly you plan to change before the update is released to the public, and that's part of the reason I made this post, but it's very important to listen when the community as a whole is trying to tell you something. The community is the lifeblood of this game and without it the game would not be nearly as successful as it is today; although you've never been the best at PR, it's very important to be able to communicate with the community when it is most needed, like right now. I don't care whether you actually change anything because of our concerns, but simply addressing them and saying ""this is something we were already planning to change, don't worry and sit tight while we get the game to a state we're happy with"" means a lot."
DvZ,39jvpl,Tomlough,16,Fri Jun 12 11:42:27 2015 UTC,"Previously a monster could hit a dwarf, and even though the dwarf could heal and would kill the monster with ease, there was still a sense that something was happening. To the dwarf, slight panic and a need to react. To the monster, a feeling that the dwarf at least notices their presence and has to take time to deal with them.  Right now as a monster I feel completely useless compared to AIs and more like a spectator class than anything. Hopefully this is temporary mid-update imbalance, so I'm holding out for more information and updates."
DvZ,39jvpl,Alderdash,18,Fri Jun 12 12:05:32 2015 UTC,"Role play is virtually nonexistent at the moment   Mmhmm, role play in DvZ has been taking a hit for a while. I have hero turned off at the moment because the last time I got Bruce and tried roleplaying it exactly as I had in the past, I was harassed by a number of players, one of which followed me around in build phase, standing in my face so I couldn't place blocks and then telling me ""Bruce should just be thinking about kills anyway"".   Also, it really doesn't sound like you hate the game, Roxie. It sounds like you love the game, and want to continue. For me it's the difference between, say, DvZ and Warlords. If they changed Warlords so that I didn't enjoy it and stopped playing, I wouldn't miss it, or really care. There's no community there. It's a mildly interesting pastime with silly weapons, no epic story or real excitement or feeling of danger. I care about changes to DvZ...because I care about DvZ."
DvZ,39jvpl,Joku_,9,Fri Jun 12 11:56:47 2015 UTC,I so do wish that more people did roleplay. I try to do it sometimes but since no one seems interested I just usually do it with some friends in a call.
DvZ,39jvpl,CopyCatJ,7,Fri Jun 12 13:08:20 2015 UTC,The reason I don't roleplay is because of the ais. I could stop and roleplay in chat but oh look 5 ais spawned behind the wall and are hitting me while I am typing.
DvZ,39jvpl,Juliandroid98,3,Fri Jun 12 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do often RP as heroes, But I should RP a bit more as dwarf, to encourge the community to do the same."
DvZ,39jvpl,ULiopleurodon,6,Fri Jun 12 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed, roleplaying feels like its been dieing recently."
DvZ,39jvpl,MasterOfSpasms,2,Fri Jun 12 13:35:32 2015 UTC,"Being able to roleplay as hero is fun, but like you said, a lot of people tend to get aggravated when heroes don't play exactly like they expect them to. I had a lot of fun playing as a Bruce recently who fought until the first shrine fell and decided ""It was time for retirement."" Even with the occasional horn, some of the community was a bit aggravated."
DvZ,39jvpl,jujug28,8,Fri Jun 12 20:41:06 2015 UTC,"In a game the other day you asked ""Does it feel like DvZ?"" I would honestly say no.  It doesn't feel like a game where the dwarves are fighting for their very lives against an overwhelming army.  It used to, but not anymore.  The dwarves no longer fight the zombies directly, they just get knocked around until they run out of gold and then they all die.  I remember old games when you would feel safe and content holding the front wall pretty well until you got into combat. You could deal with that problem rather easily. Until those problems kept occurring more and more often. And suddenly there was no more wall. And now you are at half manna. So the dwarves fell back and regrouped.  There became less and less dwarves as they got picked off and more and more undead with each wave.  Compare that to an average game.  There are three shrines with no incentive to fall back.  I honestly cannot remember the last time I died to manna loss.   Its almost always due to loss of gold and armor breaking.  There is a counter in the right side of the screen counting down to when I will die. ""Kill as many monsters as you can jimmy cause when that number hits zero you are fucked"" is both an accurate representation of the game in its current state and the sad corruption of what DvZ is about.   This is a fun casual, click click game but not the epic scenes depicted in your videos like Choose the Night and Death Fears Me. I know you are busy but I also know there is something fundamentally wrong with the direction DvZ has taken in the past year and a half."
DvZ,39jvpl,penguiniusrex,3,Fri Jun 12 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"I have found this last week to be a lot of fun. Each day I have tried out a new class, finding out that each ones has it's challenges. My favorite change so far has been the goblins - like you said it is giving us something other than just blowing up... now I can play strategically and dig into walls, place bombs in critical points; if someone comes near me I can start chucking them or blow myself up. Having three options is amazing :D"

For example, there are ongoing changes to the gold system, which affects how big you'd want to make your quarry, and heroes (I don't think Roamin needs oil any more, but who knows what changes are still to come).  Really, I'd advise waiting until you can check it out for yourself, as by the time the server is open to everyone again it should be safe to assume everything's finalised until the next big update."

DvZ,39gu5o,FallDamage312,3,Thu Jun 11 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"You might be getting confused about the different pieces of software being discussed. The two plugins used in the video are WorldEdit and VoxelSniper, running on a Spigot server. WorldEdit can be installed in single player, you can download it here: http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit if you need help installing it, I'd suggest looking up a tutorial on YouTube. I'm not sure if VoxelSniper can be installed in singleplayer, you may need to set up a local Bukkit/Spigot server for it which is probably too complex to explain in a single reddit comment.  MCEdit is a completely different program where you don't make changes to your map from within Minecraft. It is very different to the methods shown in Fall and skppo's video. You can read more at http://www.mcedit.net/ and maybe watch some videos about it so you can see how different it is.  Edit - I now realise Fall has confused you by linking you to MCEdit when you asked WorldEdit. Ignore the links Fall posted above. :P"

I definitely searched for WorldEdit in google, but it must have given be the official MCEdit website first and I just was all like 'Well, that's the official website, copy, paste'  Yeah, we are NOT using McEdit in the videos. We are using WorldEdit. WorldEdit is a MOD for minecraft, McEdit is a program that uses your minecraft but it's a separate thing.   At this point I don't know if you want to use the programs we used in the video or McEdit but I will assume it's the first one. u/tomlough has explained it pretty well, he's the smart oneI just build"
DvZ,39gu5o,LittleBlast5,3,Fri Jun 12 07:11:34 2015 UTC,"For an easier way to make mountains you should get WorldPainter.  It may be difficult to use at first, but it will become your friend for terrain. There are many tutorials on Youtube that explain the basic brushes for terrain. When you finally know how to do what you want to do for terrain, the process of making that terrain will be much quicker and you will be able to make more terrain.  I have used WorldPainter on all of my current maps because it is much harder to make a good mountain in WorldEdit/VoxelSniper. Even if you do know how to make it look good with those mods, WorldPainter can create even more great mountains in larger quantities in less time."

Here's one thread, there are many more. http://www.reddit.com/r/DvZ/comments/2yiz1v/about_starting_requirments/  As it currently stands (except for right now when the server is patron only) there are often times when a new game opens while another is already going, and people join that game even though the first isn't full. The new game starts with 30 players, and then shortly after the first game finishes and the players from that server move into the new one - making a full game, with one hero. This happens far too often, it's the compromise because people complained so much when the starting requirement was raised to 50.  If you were to speed up the rate at which the starting requirement decreases, this would happen all the time and we'd always have games with no proper hero/player balance.  As a European I sympathise with your pain of waiting forever in the vain hope of getting a game started, but no no no no no no :P"

Nisovin added this feature when we had a lull of players, but it won't even be a factor most of summer once I start releasing videos.  Right now were testing lots of things and have limited time to test, so we mostly want to focus on things that matter right now, rather then updating some old systems like this.

DvZ,399mgr,winter477,2,Wed Jun 10 18:51:43 2015 UTC,My personal problem with the map is that there is no gradual retreat anywhere on the map.  1st: You hold the wall until you retreat directly to shrine. No where besides the Front Wall and the Shrine are defended  2nd: Everyone falls back directly to the opening of the ship doors. This area is usually held until Gold runs out. This makes any interior defense useless.   3rd: No defenses can be made here at all. By this time there are an absurd amount of maxed goblins. These just obliterate any defenses placed here in a manner of seconds. Final here is a giant pit that goblins repeatedly spam their tnt into the shrine to blow every dwarf airborne. Final always ends here due to dwarves getting launched around constantly unable to do anything.

DvZ,399mgr,Tomlough,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:28:38 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if it has something to do with the water
DvZ,399mgr,winter477,3,Wed Jun 10 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"In the original version of the map the water was only one layer deep with barrier blocks underneath, because at the time mapmakers had been told that water deeper than one block would interfere with AI zombies. But the map was tested shortly after the server was updated to 1.8 and Nisovin was debuting the new depth strider zombies. In the first test game of the map, people complained about lag/frame issues and Nisovin wondered if the barriers were to blame; as the AIs could now cope with deep water, he replaced all the barrier blocks with water, and the resubmitted version of the map also removed the barrier blocks.  So whatever it is, it'd be a weird coincidence if it is the water because people had the same problem when the water was only one layer deep."

DvZ,397vul,keaganwill,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:07:02 2015 UTC,My only question is... where does space fit into all of this? :P  Would personally just say the dwarves had to use all there shields to survive a blast from all of the super creepers in the land blasting them to space :P
DvZ,397vul,louisethanking,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:05:23 2015 UTC,That is basically  the law for the space map so yea except there were no shields or that stuff and nis created some special weapons and stuff but it is one map and so it dosent nessiceraly need to fit in with the general view of the game
DvZ,397vul,louisethanking,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"I thought we were going backwards in time as we are getting lots more complex items now and so later in the war these items are lost and we are sent back to 1 type of blade bow and ale and we slowly ran out of things like ale (consumable potions) and then the basic minecraft mechanics. Then the dwarves became so few and far between that the monster hordes were not needed in such great numbers (pre AI)  The clock ect era happens when the dwarves began to run out of materials and so needed to constantly craft more to replace those they were using .then mobs were slowly not needed and they employed the weaker, less focused vampires who spent lots of time building and stuff until the dwarves were finally eradicated from the world.  One of the law items which doesn't follow this pattern is the slab so I am thinking that it was originaly ya scroll and then deadbones  trademarked them as slabs. Then never the end of the war there were few slabs left and so deadbones merged them into one super slab. I probably missed a bunch if stages of the game but this gives the general gist and I know there was a post about this a month or so back but I couldn't find it   I do not want you to think this is a criticism because it is not and I do like your idea but I am just putting forward another pov which I believe seems more true to the progression of the DvZ timeline"
DvZ,397o99,jerMMM1,6,Tue Jun 9 21:11:53 2015 UTC,Just saying that you guys are kinda making a huge deal out of something quite small :P
DvZ,397o99,johnb43,2,Wed Jun 10 07:01:42 2015 UTC,"I got 41 for sprinting and 40 for sprint jumping, so you seem to be correct in that they're essentially the same speed (Difference is negligible). Though the fact that you had to turn to face the actual track to run along, which could introduce a small amount of error, its probably not unlike a test you might do that compares two individuals.  For those who keep saying sprint jumping is faster: Its pretty clear that one is faster, but its also worth taking into consideration distance traveled. Over the short distance this test was conducted, the difference in time is negligible, but over long distances that small fraction of time does add up. So over long distances there's a clear ""victor,"" but over short distances, not so much."
DvZ,397o99,figsandthings,2,Tue Jun 9 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they have to be very long distances. I did this over a 200 block span and the difference was 6 (1.2 seconds)."
DvZ,397o99,figsandthings,2,Tue Jun 9 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that's correct? I'm pretty sure the timer is measured in ticks, and since there's 20 ticks in a second, 1.2 seconds should be 24 ticks. A difference of 6 ticks would .3 seconds, in which case even over 200 blocks the difference in time isn't very large. (Though for the purposes of DVZ, a third of a second can be the difference between having a proc and not having a proc)  Edit: Please correct me if I'm wrong about the timer being measured in ticks.  Edit: Seems I was wrong about the timer counting ticks. A difference of 1 on the timer should be .2 seconds, in which case you're correct with the 1.2 seconds. That was my bad!"
DvZ,397o99,keaganwill,2,Wed Jun 10 00:08:55 2015 UTC,Sprint jumping w/ speed 2 pot is slightly slower than not...not sure if the speed buff on the armor is equivalent to that or not though :3
DvZ,397o99,Tomlough,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"Thing is, I'd still do it regardless. If I play an older version of Minecraft with no sprint key, I still spend the whole time holding my sprint key without really realising. Plus, based on the responses in this thread it seems like the difference is so negligible that it would still be better to sprint jump to increase your chance of crits."
DvZ,397o99,NaquIma,3,Wed Jun 10 10:57:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, Wifi and Ewok did this on the Server. Yaknow? The place where it matters? Offline or not you are running in DvZ. It just happens that you seem to be faster when you sprint jump on the server. I'll look into the tiny things here and there but I do have 1 thing I need to say:  Damn boy, you are more stubborn than an overaged dwarf refusing to let go of his gold!"
DvZ,397o99,mbokn,3,Tue Jun 9 23:01:07 2015 UTC,"I'd take a standardized test with a timer over 2 people attempting to coordinate a race, which thanks to the minuscule difference in speed between jumping and not, likely is flawed due to reaction times and/or ping."
DvZ,397o99,NaquIma,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:03:42 2015 UTC,"likely is flawed due to reaction times and/or ping   Exactly. We are talking whether or not this affects gameplay online. The fact is, IT DOES. Specially a Minecraft online minigame, it is bound to have inconsistencies due to ping and signal crap. If you want results, you need to test in the conditions the data will reflect.   Testing if a car is waterproof in a desert wont do that... Putting it in rain will!   It may be stupid, but thats how things are. So unless you want to set up a server with 50 different 200 block long lanes  for 50 different people with different internet services and locations, then you're gonna want to trust Wifi and Ewok on this one"
DvZ,397o99,PrivateChicken,3,Wed Jun 10 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"The fact that WiFi and ewoks test was different doesn't mean they will always get those results. If the error was with their synchronization or latency, then the strategies are still equivalent over short distances of around 200 blocks. The synchronization will simply favor one result randomly, same thing with ping."

Assuming that fundamental Minecraft mechanics like running work differently than on a single player world is useless."
DvZ,397o99,NaquIma,0,Wed Jun 10 11:38:45 2015 UTC,"Me and a friend raced when we both had runeleather, sprint jumping is faster.   -Ewok    was with ewok   -Wifi"
DvZ,397o99,mbokn,2,Wed Jun 10 18:57:06 2015 UTC,Ok? There's still no way to ensure accuracy with something as simple as a race.
DvZ,397o99,NaquIma,0,Wed Jun 10 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"It wont :) But you can ensure precision. On a scientific perspective, precision is the measure of how close you are between two points of data. Sure, they may be inaccurate and be a few Minecraft ticks off the real number, but if they can precise winning rates (sprint jumping getting more wins more often) then precision is ensured."
DvZ,397o99,mbokn,2,Wed Jun 10 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"It is still nowhere near as accurate as the test in the OP, so I think I'll take that over some race."
DvZ,397o99,NaquIma,0,Wed Jun 10 19:14:49 2015 UTC,"Congratz! You prefer a seemingly right answer over an answer that may be wrong but still have consistent results, however you are missing half the point. Again from a scientific result, many people go through the same tests in order to test both accuracy and precision. I have no idea how many times jerMMM1 did this because all he said in a nutshell was ""Hah! Im right, you're not, I have evidence"" and did not really give us any data to work with. So I invite you, you have the accuracy part, now go and test the precision part. If both are consistent, then well, I guess we now know whether or not to sprint jump"
DvZ,397o99,mbokn,2,Wed Jun 10 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"I don't care about the science behind it, I want to know if I should sprint-jump or not with runeleather. One person did a solid test with no obvious downfalls, and gave us what he used to test it, while the other 2, well, said they raced. I know which I'm going to trust. If you feel the race is more accurate, more power to you."
DvZ,397o99,figsandthings,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"JerMMM1's test allows for a lot less error than Ewok and Wifi's test. I'm not trying to discredit anyone, and while mbokn covered where error can come in, the fact is, its two people racing each other while not actually measuring time vs. distance traveled. Did they start at the exact same time? If not, that's a source of error. Did they both travel the exact same distance while traveling parallel to each other? If not, that's another source of error.  Again, I'm not trying to discredit anyone here, but jerMMM1's is likely more accurate because it measures the time of each across the same distance, not simply eyeballing two players and saying one is clearly faster than the other."

DvZ,39664h,zzCratoszz,2,Tue Jun 9 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"I think this map looks really interesting. However, there are a couple changes that I would like to see.   The main pathways in the mines shouldn't have gravel or gold ore in them. Jimmies like to mine out the gravel and gold ore, which then makes those pathways have lots of holes. Honestly, I think I'd prefer it if it didn't have cobble either, just so creepers won't blow it up. Perhaps stone, andesite, and/or the smooth slabs? A used dwaven mine would probably have fairly good main roadways inside it. That lava trap needs some ways out. This is partly for dwarves, but mostly so monsters don't have to suicide if they fall in there. I think that wooden shortcut bridge could be a bit wider. It'll still be super dangerous for dwarves. You might want to cave in that corridor that goes to the Roamin oil. It's not a big deal, but it's unnecessary now and might cause a bit of unneeded confusion."

DvZ,396wpm,rstd2,21,Tue Jun 9 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"Mechanics     Monsters are now known as demons in the flavor text. Gold is auto-stored when acquired instead of being put in your inventory. At monster release, gold stored up to that point is spread evenly over each shrine. Any gold gathered after that point is stored in the current shrine. All armor repair (wrenches, passive, or helping a fellow dwarf) pulls from the gold stored in the current shrine. Can passively repair armor by standing on the shrine (very slow). While at shrine, can repair fellow dwarves by right clicking them with pick for a quick repair. 8 slots in your inventory are unavailable. 1 additional slot is reserved for arrows. You no longer craft arrows, but instead they regen over time (haven't timed it, but seems like 1 arrow per ~3 seconds). For most dwarves, maximum number of arrows is 20. Bows are no longer affected by having a roof. I think the restrictions on being too close to your target still apply though.   Dwarf loadouts     Everyone has 64 points that can be spent on their loadout, no way to gain more points. 4 Preset loadouts exist that use all 64 points: Warrior, Ranger, Paladin, and Berserker. Everyone starts with Warrior unlocked, the others are 5000 gold to purchase and then can be exchanged at will. Trying them out is a good way to try out the different weapon/armor/healing item combinations. You can purchase the various custom options and create your own custom build as well. I put together a simple builder tool here if you want to see what all is available. Not going to list all options here, since they are all in that tool. Change last night for Jimmy Juice is that you can't manually heal with it, only auto-heal. As such, you don't need to even have it on your hotbar. (thanks Beech for being the guinea pig on that).   Monster updates     Ogres - Knockback on their shovel, immune to proc from non-heroes, take significantly reduced damage from bows. Iron Golems - Armor is unbreakable plus high regen buff makes them effectively unkillable until it wears off. Exceptions: Ranger's Longbow, Hero proc, or Roamin flame can kill them. Rats - Can steal gold from shrine Skeletons - Infiltrator and Impact have been combined into one tree. I don't have the specifics of what the new tree looks like. Goblins - The new creeper. They get some number of boomboxes that regen back to their personal max. These can be placed for keep destruction (long fuse that can be reduced with upgrades) or thrown as an attack against dwarves if you have 2 or more. Thrown ones have a fuse as well (typical tnt flashing type fuse). Final upgrade gives suicide for major dwarf damage. Events - Two (?) events available currently. Announced with a pounding drumbeat which prevents mobs from respawning and then at the end the name of the event shows on screen and everyone waiting to respawn spawns as the creatures related to the event. Bopen spawns a skeleton king on a horse named Bopen (random player chosen), everyone else spawns as a skeleton with a gold sword and significant jump boost. I believe Bopen can steal gold from the shrine. There's a wolfpack event as well, but I don't know the details on that one."
DvZ,396wpm,Tringard,7,Tue Jun 9 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"Nice post! I'll just fill in a few parts that I've seen   For most dwarves, maximum number of arrows is 20.   For all most dwarves as it stands right now, there is an upgrade that increases the number to what we believe is 60, but that is currently broken and doesn't change the max from 20. It is reduced to a max of 10 if you choose to wield a crossbow, which seems to be favorable for those who primarily are melee.. It's an odd weapon to me for sure   Skeletons - Infiltrator and Impact have been combined into one tree. I don't have the specifics of what the new tree looks like.   The combined upgrades that you get are:  -Shield (absorption hearts)  -Siege Cannon (Damage bricks/walls)  -Vines (which got a buff, they now grow upwards a few blocks on placement)   -Infiltrator (immune to shrine protection)  So the broken TNT shot was finally removed as an option for impact as well as the slowness upgrade from the old poison skeleton.   Regarding wither skeletons now, they've received a pretty big nerf, pretty much impossible to kill any dwarf with Jimmy Juice now and they may have a reduced damage.. Apparently its never been intended for them to be able to 3 shot dwarves.   Dwarf loadouts   The default classes actually have about 80 points worth of items, so they're slightly more ""powerful"" than any custom class can be. This is targeted at making the game more friendly for newer/casual players. Source.   There's a wolfpack event as well, but I don't know the details on that one.   Pretty much the same as the Bopen event, all player mobs are held for a certain amount of time, and when they spawn all of them are wolfs. This creates a much larger group of wolves than just the normal random spawn wolf option.   EDIT: Forgot about crossbow's thanks Wifi"

DvZ,393nvl,Rurikar,3,Tue Jun 9 06:27:18 2015 UTC,"While I do feel that the new gold system is a huge improvement over the old one I also feel that it suffers from a big flaw which is this: Once a shrine falls you have about 30 dwarves with near dead armour waiting back at second shrine which then instantly pickaxe rep/wrench once it falls leaving you with far less gold to defend that shrine than you should have(the 1/3 of the gold for that shrine is usually halved at this point). I feel that the third of the gold that is saved for that shrine should be used fully to defend that shrine and not on previous repairs. Why? Because it makes the second and third shrine far weaker than first because you have less gold than you should. Could we possibly add a feature where when a shrine falls all dwarves armour is repaired fully if not even slightly to reduce the large amount of gold taken right after a shrine falls?

It should be 30/40/30% gold instead of 33/33/33%, because when the game starts everyone has full armour, but when you get to second gold drops massivly due to everyone wrenching while there is a lot of people still alive. In the long run gold on second runs out the fastest due to. Lots of people alive. Still broken armour after first shrine."
DvZ,393nvl,comkreaperkiller,5,Tue Jun 9 07:17:54 2015 UTC,Archas you did pretty well explaining this congrats
DvZ,393nvl,winter477,5,Tue Jun 9 01:42:58 2015 UTC,The new deposit mechanism keeps me from panic-dashing back to a Shrine with my hard-won loot moments before Plague so I'm not running the risk of losing it all. Can't say I'll miss that!
DvZ,393nvl,ross_varn,2,Tue Jun 9 02:24:12 2015 UTC,"So... lets say this... before mob release, there is 3k gold.  Mobs are released and now 1k is put into 1st shrine...  After first falls.... is it 1/3 of the remaining 2k? or 1/3 of the beginning total?"
DvZ,393nvl,NaquIma,5,Tue Jun 9 01:05:07 2015 UTC,One third of the beginning total
DvZ,393nvl,Wifi_LC,2,Tue Jun 9 01:05:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like Wifi said. The shrine gold amount is entirely based on how much gold is collected before monster release, divided by how many shrines there are. And, of course, any gold mined after the monsters are released goes directly to the current shrine, but that gold does not affect the gold total for subsequent shrines."

DvZ,393nvl,penguiniusrex,2,Fri Jun 12 15:50:30 2015 UTC,cant you just stock all the god in final shirne or do they have it so every shrine has its own?
DvZ,393nvl,xavierisapro,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"No, you cannot. Remember, all gold collected during build phase is put into a central ""pot""; when monsters are released, that pot is automatically divided into parts and equally distributed among the shrines. Once that gold division happens, all gold collected goes directly to the current shrine; you cannot actively deposit into another shrine."

DvZ,394p0h,TheDrCreeps,8,Tue Jun 9 06:12:57 2015 UTC,I have notice that the goblin's destructive features are not as strong as the creepers used to be  creepers were so destructive that slabs and putting blocks down were pointless.   I disagree. The current creepers seem way more destructive that old creepers ever were (mostly because 85% of creepers went damage).   If a single goblin can create 8 minor explosions + 1 major explosion this is much more impactful than one single proc-able creeper.  These new goblins are so powerful that indoor defences have become obsolete. They are no longer built or maintained.
DvZ,394p0h,8jy89hui,3,Tue Jun 9 06:37:27 2015 UTC,But you can counter the minor explosions and a Goblin doesn't get the major explosion until later in the game.
DvZ,394p0h,Rurikar,2,Tue Jun 9 06:43:43 2015 UTC,The dwarves can maintain outside defenses against goblins for a long time but when the game moves indoors the remaining shrines fall in minutes.  Feels like a map issue. I wonder how the game would play on some of the old single shrine maps.
DvZ,394p0h,prettypinkdork,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"The main difference the goblins and creepers have are the ratblocks, they cannot be repaired by mortar, and only way to repair the wall completely is manually destroy the block, and replace them, with destruction creeper slowly turning the whole wall into the ratblock, there are not much dwarves can do to repair it but slowly replace the ratblocks. but now, with goblins, spamming mortar can be done to save at least the structure of the wall, able to repair it to full when time comes."
DvZ,394p0h,ScottishViking,7,Tue Jun 9 06:44:13 2015 UTC,"In the other side, Dwarves can actually hold walls without the walls disappearing before they mortar it. with the ratblocks gone, dwarves can effectively fix walls with mortar, build it more, and keep the wall/proc hall in service for defence.   From my experience, trying to keep a proc hall against waves of deafening goblins is pretty much impossible. It's a waste of time and unless you have a proc you may as well go right back to the shrine. This is something which I completely dislike unfortunately, as it makes the amount of space on maps that people actually use cut down even more.   After the 2014 June update, the introduction of the AI zombies made this an issue in the outdoor section of the game. They made it so you pretty much had to run around with a shield to try and get a weaker monster for a proc, or just place yourself into a corner to swing at a group of AI zombies hitting you one at a time. It meant that in open spaces of the map, there were hardly any dwarves staying trying to defend it, which I really didn't like since in a game of DvZ the dwarves are meant to be having a final epic battle, not a hop from one shrine to the next which is most definitely not epic at all. It's far more fun in a steady retreat and it gives satisfactory visual monster progression for the monsters, as opposed to waiting until the gold runs out (but let's not talk about that atm!). The removal of shields, while having many positives, ultimately worsened this situation as now dwarves were forced into corners.   However inside due to the proc halls having may turns, there was a very steady progression due which was like the final epic battle you expect from a DvZ game. With everyone having slabs and super mortar you had the ability to quicker repair walls against a handful of destruction creepers and rats. Something that I feel is impossible in the end game against goblins. Especially since by that point they all have 8 separate boxes they are able to place with barely any cooldown. It creates the situation where inside everyone has to go straight back to the shrine unless there are bedrocked corners where they can quickly get a proc. Quite frankly it makes the game boring if you do that as the insides of the map have been designed by the map makers to include a defendable area suitable for some proc halls, while at the same time not making it too harsh on the mobs. This makes all of that redundant, which is a shame. So now it feels like you have both the outside and inside portions of the map have huge areas of space that will barely be used, which is just further gives an sense of the game lacking variety. Before you were able to defend any area you like, and have some success. Now it's the exact same areas every time. Lack of variety does not solely come from this as I believe the gold system plays a major factor, but it does contribute to my feeling of there being a lack of variety."
DvZ,394p0h,Rurikar,3,Tue Jun 9 12:05:31 2015 UTC,"That is true, goblins are quite... let's not say OP, but annoying. it pushes through proc halls (late game) so quick that there are nothing to the maps than the shrines itself. only part that takes steady progression is the front wall to the first shrine, maybe to the 2nd shrine."
DvZ,394p0h,ScottishViking,8,Tue Jun 9 12:10:46 2015 UTC,"I love shrine gold, gonna be hard to convince me to remove the system at this point. Maps play out amazing and older maps will be a lot more interesting with the new system. Shrines having limited amounts of power make sense too from a ""logic"" standpoint dwarves store their gold in a bunch of shrines.  DvZ has to end and we want games to generally be an hour long. While the idea of ""LASTING FOREVER"" is a nice thought, we tried it and it grew old. Games are limited by gold and while it is totally possible and will happen to delay games longer and longer, we generally have to have some control over averages. The gold changes were not popular with the community when they implemented them, but it was something I forced through because I believe it will make better games more consistently and we have strived to make the games barrier of entry and skill requirements much lighter so more players can fall in love with the game.  You are also kinda wrong. The reason you don't hold a shrine is still the same: Not enough dwarves to hold it. Just now the reason for that isn't that they died, it's that they can't fight anymore. To be honest, Bruce Willakers alone can hold a forward shrine forever by himself, hell some players or small groups of players can hold a forward shrine until they run out of gold. This just can't happen unless you want games that feel stale for monsters as you fight at the same spot and then instantly end. ""Retreating"" from a Shrine was an RP thing, you never had to retreat in dvz, we just did ""because"". Now it's a real reason. You still want to hold a shrine for as long as you can without losing dwarves. We are considering make it so when a shrine falls, all dwarves armor instantly repairs so that then there is a gameplay reason to hold as long with as many dwarves as you possibly can as it will add bigger risks and rewards to the game."
DvZ,394p0h,Rurikar,10,Tue Jun 9 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"The shrine gold system is an improvement on the last gold system, but in my opinion, the whole community gold system in itself is flawed and is incredibly detrimental to having an enjoyable experience as a dwarf and also now as a monster with the new mechanics (but that may change).   The system promotes boring gameplay. People will now solely defend the shrine and not the pathways to it (with the exception of the front wall, but you can still see more people on it at the start for no reason) meaning there is little visual progression for the monsters, in fact the only sense of progression they get is a random death or just seeing the gold counter going down, nothing else. This combined with the introduction of Goblins, as I talked about here, removes the feeling of a final epic battle, which you expect from DvZ. Being a monster has become a game where you just destroy armour until the shrine gold count goes to zero, then repeat for the next shrines.  The gold system is even worse for dwarves. The game almost always finishes because dwarves run out of gold. That is not enjoyable. With that, you lose all motivation to play as a dwarf, as you know that you will never be allowed to die midway through a heroic, epic battle, but rather now it's that nobody dies for 10 minutes, then 15 people die in the space of 2 minutes because the gold has run out. It's not even satisfying for the monsters as they know that the victory was barely anything to do with them as it seems the AI zombies are the ones who constantly hit dwarves, meaning their armour needs repairing.   This is not me getting annoyed at the idea that games can only be around an hour long. Regardless of how long the game is intended to be played, it is not enjoyable to limit it based on the amount of gold on a map. This again contributes to there being a lack of variety within the game. It is out of the control of the dwarves which again means you lose motivation. If you know you are on a map with a certain amount of gold, you know that you have a maximum amount of time left. You talked about how this is the issue of the maps and not the system, which is true but if you make them with the same amount of gold then the  different maps are all going to be roughly same length. Which again just makes the design of the maps redundant and pointless.   A way that could shorten the length of games, while still giving the motivation to survive as a dwarf is to buff monsters is change or get rid of the gold system and give the monsters the ability to kill dwarves must faster. Currently it's almost impossible to kill a dwarf meaning the monsters are dependant on the gold count. If you get rid of the gold system or completely change it so that it doesn't limit dwarves, you will make sure that dwarves have an enjoyable time, and regain that feeling of a final epic battle which had been lost for a while. Obviously these ideas were just quickly thought of and may have some other negative affects which I cannot think of but I'm sure there are an infinite number of ways in which you can change it for a better, fairer, and more enjoyable experience."
DvZ,394p0h,PickShark,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:11:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, I just utterly disagree with this opinion. You are thinking too idealistic with what you feel the game should be and what it was. Your idea of ""Buffing"" monsters so that they can kill Dwarves with both mana/armor is something we have done for years and does not promote good game play, it promotes skill. We have lowered the barrier of entry because this isn't some high skill cap game only the best of video game players can play. My compensation to the hardcore player for the changes we made was making it we could have a variety of maps coming out and load out builds to change your playstyle up, but things like Jimmy Juice will make it so that average players and below can last just as long as a good player use too. This is intended and while you might not agree/like it, it's important for the overhaul health of the game."
DvZ,394p0h,Rurikar,4,Wed Jun 10 22:34:13 2015 UTC,Repairing dwarves after shrine fall would help because if they fall back they instantly handicap the next shrine by several hundred gold.
DvZ,394p0h,RedstoneGate,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"No no no, I love the shrine gold, it gives the dwarves the risks to lose massive amounts of gold, and makes it so the game time is divided between the shrines, but I dislike the idea of ""we can't hold it because we don't have the gold"" rather than ""we can't hold it because we don't have enough people. now, a little suggestion, what if dwarves can transport gold from the vault? the vault will be the final shrine, and dwarves can transport little, I mean LITTLE gold to the front shrine, this can be done to only the first shrine, so if they want to hold the front line for a longer, or rescue some armorless dwarves, then it is possible, at least for one repair. but dwarves can't transport enough gold for the games to last on the front shrine. I guess the dwarves have to communicate that they will retreat, and do their final repairs.  but I also like the shrine giving full armor when it blows up, that gives chances for the dwarves to survive to retreat. It's one or the other I guess."
DvZ,394p0h,ArcaneWarrior303,8,Tue Jun 9 07:15:33 2015 UTC,"Because that counters exactly what I said. If dwarves could transport gold, they would and you would stay stuck at the first shrine. That would completely counteract the purpose of this change."
DvZ,394p0h,Rurikar,2,Tue Jun 9 07:20:32 2015 UTC,"Most maps are built not balanced, some shrines are strong, some are very weak. This feature just balanced the three/two shrines.  Also, Gold rushing adds gold to current shrine."
DvZ,394p0h,Awesomeshafter,2,Tue Jun 9 13:37:02 2015 UTC,I have noticed when I plagued that it is really difficult to actually put down a boom box and have it explode because it takes ~10 seconds to detonate fully upgraded. That is a lot of time when the dwarves are really protecting the wall well.
DvZ,394p0h,Awesomeshafter,3,Tue Jun 9 09:37:33 2015 UTC,You have to be sneaky with boxes or overwhelm the dwarves as a team that they can't get to them. It's counterplay for the dwarves.
DvZ,394p0h,blaster_man,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:46:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that I was a ranger one game (starts with  wizard mortar and scrolls to repair walls) and some goblins got behind the wall and in front of the wall and used teamwork to instantly take down a wall, the explosions didn't let me slab.   The new system emphasizes on teamwork.   Edit: said super mortar and slabs :P"
DvZ,394p0h,Awesomeshafter,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"but if you had few more dwarves checking the wall, bombs could be instantly taken down, goblins killed, and wall fixed with supermortar and slabs in no time! this didn't just make teamwork for goblins important, but it made the dwarves's teamwork important just as much"

DvZ,3944ql,Rurikar,11,Tue Jun 9 06:29:25 2015 UTC,"Its no fun to die because of gold though ;/ I would rather be weaker and have a harder fight than die from a death counter designed to terminate the game after a certain amount of time.  That is why I love your new system with the shrine gold, it makes sure every shrine has a chance."
DvZ,3944ql,8jy89hui,7,Tue Jun 9 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"This, absolutely. A ""last stand"" that's actually 15 dwarves falling back to a final shrine with no gold, pathetically limping around until they die just doesn't feel very epic. I love that this new system makes sure that some of the gold at least will be reserved for the final shrine so that that doesn't have to happen."
DvZ,3944ql,TinyLongwing,8,Tue Jun 9 06:48:29 2015 UTC,"Well, every game I've seen with the new gold still ends when gold runs out. In fact, the only time I've seen a shrine actually fall before it ran out of gold was when half the dwarves that game timed out. Unfortunately games still seem to end with a lot of dwarves just running about trying to conserve mana, with a sudden spurt of deaths in the last few minutes when people's armour completely goes."
DvZ,3944ql,ewokaro,2,Tue Jun 9 11:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, gold still is the major determinant right now, and I'm not sure how I feel about that or if it will feel different once a bunch of less-experienced players join us. I have a feeling that the army of veteran super jimmies has a lot to do with why games can go on until the last chunk of gold on the whole map is used up."
DvZ,3944ql,TinyLongwing,2,Tue Jun 9 14:11:13 2015 UTC,"Just got back, was about to edit in about the super jimmies :P It may just be because of that, but games at the moment feel not many people actually die until gold goes."
DvZ,3944ql,ewokaro,2,Tue Jun 9 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"While I agree, what concerns me is that people continuing to defend a shrine even after it already runs out of gold has the potential to waste the next shrine's gold. 20 people with broken armor who can't repair all repairing at once uses up a lot of gold, and I've seen shrines drop from ~600 gold to ~400 almost right away. The gold obviously would be used anyway, just kinda sucks that while its intended for a specific shrine, it ends up being used for the previous one."
DvZ,3944ql,figsandthings,2,Tue Jun 9 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but at the same time I completely understand not wanting to give up on a shrine that has a completely full meter even when there's no gold in it. We're used to defending to the very end and running back just because there's no gold left in that shrine sort of feels like giving up. We'll see how the game evolves over the next few weeks as we all get used to the new changes."
DvZ,3944ql,TinyLongwing,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:09:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. At this point its really hard to say that anything is an issue with 100% certainty. We only have a very small number of games to go off of and an even smaller amount that are exactly the same because we're in a testing period. Right now its easy to point out potential concerns, but a week from now they might not even be something to consider anymore!"

DvZ,3944ql,Th3A1ph4D0g,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:30:02 2015 UTC,I did and that wouldn't really change anything unless the repair when the shrine falls didn't use any gold. If that's the case that's a reasonable idea and if not then my concerns still aren't the biggest deal in the world.
DvZ,3944ql,figsandthings,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"thing is now that gold is divided by shrines, dwarves know when to back off. And that leads to dwarfs not dieing. And result is 30 dwarves still alive on the final shrine. And final battle is not epic few versus many.   Also more dwarves are alive higher is gold consumption so gold rans out sooner. One good thing what might come from this is that people stop wasting gold by getting unneeded damage. People that are killfarming AI mobs at start of game by standing in hole and getting hit while trying to get proc are using lots of gold without really defending anything."
DvZ,3944ql,Morvereth,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"dwarves know when to back off.   Not really, in the games that I played today, shrines were usually held long after gold ran out, and only lost when too many people retreated from lack of armor dura. Often there were still a few jimmies hanging around as it fell the shrine fell. Despit what people say, I feel the game is very balanced right now (rip momentum hearts)."
DvZ,3944ql,blaster_man,2,Wed Jun 10 01:26:31 2015 UTC,One reason why games last long is that there is only super jimmies playing. Not saying that there would not be any top tier players without super jimmy but there is no complete newbies. And also players are not committing as much suicides because most of the people want to test new dwarf classes.
DvZ,3944ql,Morvereth,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:20:14 2015 UTC,This right here. There are very few if no new players in games. You can't say games are long in beta because all of us are playing in try hard mode. Wait till it is public to determine if games are too long.

However, if you have a speed I potion (basically +20% movement speed) then sprint jumping will actually be LESS than just sprinting, since while you are in the air you are moving at a normal speed, and not at the +20% movement speed.

DvZ,392lzq,Th3A1ph4D0g,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:29:00 2015 UTC,I have heard from other players that leaves cause them to have significant fps drops.   This could be a big problem with Archives. Mainly because the entirety of second shrine is covered with trees (leaves).   I would be willing to go through Archives and massively deforest the Upper Section. Would you be interested in me doing this and seeing if players get better frames?  EDIT: Nearly 48k leaves in the current version
DvZ,392lzq,Rurikar,3,Mon Jun 8 22:49:20 2015 UTC,Those that lag should simply change their graphics to fast then. I mean that's what it's for.

My evidence is simply that I cannot enter any sort of forest biome in minecraft and get above 5 fps. Yet I get plenty of frames per second in non-tree biomes.  Also, I installed optifine and have everything on all the lowest settings: render distance 2, fast graphics, no smooth lighting, and every possible option to help maximize fps.  I have found though, that turning ""vbos"" on, removes the leaves lag, not fast graphics."

If I was playing with a game that looked like yours my frames would be awful too, but my video options page looks like this. Turn all fancy stuff off, and I only have proc particles on (no goblin explosions really helps frames). Your game might look a bit worse, and the render distance can hurt, but I rarely dip much below 20-30fps even when looking at the main battle outdoors or the quarry, and in build phase I can go much higher."

DvZ,392lzq,blaster_man,2,Mon Jun 8 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"Goblins are far more laggy than creepers simply due to the fact they can cause way more explosions in a shorter time. Also turn down your render distance, that's the most significant thing for me in terms of lag."

If the framerate spikes continue to get more severe after they begin, it is most likely java running out of memory. For me in this instance, it was a memory leak and updating java fixed it rather easily. Updating Java and lowering your in-game settings is really all I could recommend with certainty. I guess something else that could work, as much as I hate people saying it; is allocating more memory to minecraft (if your computer can handle it). That may atleast buy you some more time. If you had more about your system and your minecraft settings perhaps I could help more."

DvZ,391ux6,Wifi_LC,5,Mon Jun 8 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"I think the darker stone retexture for bedrock would be the best solution. IMO it doesn't look that bad outside, and for mountains and hills you can use the worldedit command: //naturalize.   What it does is change the terrain in a selection into: 1 top layer grass, 3 dirt layers and the rest stone. Ater that, you can switch the stone with bedrock, and since it's textured like dark stone it will look pretty nice.   I know that will require every map to be changed, but it will take waaaay less time than replacing the bedrock indoors with obsidian.  Also, it will help with terrain looking ""not changed at all"" even after all those goblin explosions."

I know you've said before, tom, about how much you missed the ""look"" of walls degrading after the introduction of blue glue. Something like the wall on the original Mt Willakers would gradually turn from stone brick, to cracked and cobble, and then to gravel - and gravity would make the gravel fall, so there were fewer of the ""random bricks hovering in midair"" that we're now so used to, since the stronger blue bricks often survive.  However, in this update the damage goblins can do has, so far, considerably outweighed the damage creepers can do. My first game of the update I was mob in a game on Mt Willakers, and when 1st shrine fell I jumped from where I was up on the mountain as a skeleton and ran across from the left side towards the shrine, and over to wood, intending to climb up on the inner wall and shoot from there as I had in test games.  But in the time it took me to cross the field, the entire inner wall was gone, other than the few decorative blocks that aren't currently destroyed. The new goblins (which I know have been changed even since then!) simply melted it away - much like a Jimmy spiderling wave might, removing all cover for the mobs rather than the dwarves. It was like modern artillery against a medieval castle, there was simply no contest. It was levelled as efficiently as a bedrock test.  There is no way that mapmakers - any, in the current rotation or on the list for the summer - could have predicted how powerful this new mob would be, and how quickly they could reduce our builds to bare bones. There's no rubble lying around because everything was exploded.  I'm withholding judgement on goblins though, because a) they're changing day to day at the moment and b) because they're new, and because some of the new dwarf upgrades are making players more reluctant to go zombie an unusually high number of players are using goblin at the moment. Hopefully when they (and other things) are finally in balance, and the popularity dies down, we'll see what their actual everyday damage looks like.  Lastly, I do think you have a point in that the dirt bedrock texture looks pretty silly inside keeps, and that is something that always mildly bothered me, but I just pretended not to think about it.  It could probably be solved by one small change to the texture pack: change the bedrock texture from dirt to stone.  1) It'd work ""in-lore"" for keeps with daintier blocks like sandstone/glass/quartz - putting a hard stone core in the build would make perfect sense, rather than them having dirt behind the walls.  2) The grey would blend in well with 'harder' stones like the blue brick, or even the new prismarine blocks because blue/grey and green/grey are actual colours.  3) Most dwarven keeps at some point end up tunneling through hills and mountains and the walls being stone would make a lot more sense than dirt.  4) Outside, grass is now usually unbroken anyway, and even if folk dug through it, a layer of (visually) stone underneath would not take you out of the game at all.  TL;DR   New mobs are interacting with the maps in ways the builders could not predict, and this is affecting the look in ways that we can't even understand properly till the new mobs are balanced and the game settles down. Having the bedrock texture changed from dirt to stone would make it visually better when the keeps are destroyed - both in the sense that grey is more neutral than dirt and blends better with the blocks, and in the sense that if you're tunnelling into a mountain you'd be more likely to see rock than dirt.

DvZ,38y68n,Cronurd,4,Mon Jun 8 13:34:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with change from dirt to stone for bedrock, or possibly a custom texture of some sort which is a mix of bedrock a stone?"
DvZ,38y68n,Tebotron,2,Mon Jun 8 11:28:18 2015 UTC,"Well bedrock is pretty much stone with a lot of added contrast, so I guess making the stone texture a bit darker with a bit of contrast would work pretty well."
DvZ,38y68n,FizZmc,3,Mon Jun 8 16:04:02 2015 UTC,"It could probably be solved by one small change to the texture pack: change the bedrock texture from dirt to stone.   In general I think this could make keep interiors look more normal. I guess the main reason for not doing it would be that it could be more annoying/confusing when it's mistaken for actual stone. I might play with the texture switched out for a bit and see how long it takes me to get used to... at the moment if I mistake bedrock for dirt I desist after one or two taps, but when I was new I'd be hitting that block for ages."
DvZ,38y68n,skppo,2,Mon Jun 8 11:32:58 2015 UTC,I think a slightly darker variant of the vanilla stone texture would work.

DvZ,38y68n,5ilver42,4,Mon Jun 8 13:11:40 2015 UTC,I agree with the need for maps to be made to look cool while being destroyed and after being destroyed.
DvZ,38y68n,8jy89hui,4,Sun Jun 7 22:11:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes please!"
DvZ,38y68n,Th3A1ph4D0g,2,Sun Jun 7 21:22:47 2015 UTC,"1st: I agree with the tall grass point here. Goblins sitting in tall grass spamming gobbo boxes when they are unkillable by sword due to being in mob spawn protected tall grass gets annoying rather quick.  2nd: For your idea about having one layer of stone in between the walls of the keep and the bedrock, we would grow to distaste the look of stone as we now dislike the look of exposed bedrock.  As a mason I can say that this is a rather difficult task for your second point. Some areas of maps especially the outside portion of the map are hard/impossible to bedrock. These being small buildings/pre-built sniper towers. The only things that can be bedrocked are the larger buildings. Usually only the shrine area. An example is my map Archives (currently in Summer Rotation). The only way that the cathedral can still look nice is with minimal bedrocking. I have some bedrock to keep a plains scenario from developing at final. (I don't have any post-goblin screenshots of plains but you are looking at 100% bedrock except for shrine blocks) Adding in another layer of rubble blocks would make the maps feel a lot more blocky/chunky. That feel could work for you... I personally prefer a more graceful flowing structure. I would be interested in trying to add rubble materials to the buildings, but I do not have any ideas for a third map at this moment. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas for maps they want to see built feel free to leave that in the replies section below."
DvZ,38y68n,Th3A1ph4D0g,3,Sun Jun 7 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not for a moment suggesting that any and all bedrock must be surrounded by a bonus layer of stone. I actually think the final shrine of Archives looks good at the end of the game. I wasn't suggesting it for things like sniper towers or outdoor shrine buildings either, really just the walls and ceilings of the keep tunnels."
DvZ,38y68n,blaster_man,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:51:10 2015 UTC,Another part about Archives Cathedral Shrine is because of the height of the walls you get destroyed material remaining on top. Yeah it is floating. But you get broken material.
DvZ,38y68n,FallDamage312,2,Mon Jun 8 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"If you don't like bedrock, then run one of many custom packs, and change the bedrock texture to something else, though it might make the outdoors look a little off."
DvZ,38y68n,skppo,2,Sun Jun 7 23:38:48 2015 UTC,"For the second point, mapmakers. I'd love to see more maps which are designed to look cool even after the goblins have destroyed the keep.   Hey Tom. How are you Tom?"
DvZ,38y68n,Alderdash,3,Mon Jun 8 06:27:05 2015 UTC,"Hello Fall :P  I hope this post doesn't come off as a criticism of mapmakers, I know you could do much more interesting things if you didn't have to take things like bedrocking into account. It's more important for a rotation map to play well than look good... the post was just me rambling and thinking aloud, and as I don't build maps it's difficult to say anything especially helpful. If anything perhaps, I should have excluded that paragraph."
DvZ,38y68n,Wifi_LC,2,Mon Jun 8 06:47:59 2015 UTC,"Alot of the issues inside can be avoided by not using stonebrick as the main building material in the keep. Then again stonebrick is kind of the ""most dwarven"" block. I can't come up with an obvious alternative that would keep the aesthetics of most keeps. The destruction has to be made so that terrain and keeps are still walkable, so I like the idea of making it mostly texture based."
DvZ,38y68n,Alderdash,2,Mon Jun 8 08:32:01 2015 UTC,"Aye, and even at that, skppo, the one thing that mapmakers are always told to remember is that every block has the potential to be destroyed - the only one we can rely on for certain is bedrock. It's not like there's two lists, and we choose the ones that don't blow up to make pretty patterns with, and then cover them up with the stuff that can be exploded/broken..."
DvZ,38y68n,MasterDJV,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:29:17 2015 UTC,"It's not like there's two lists   Except there is, theres a lot of blocks which cant be broken in any way take redstone blocks for example"
DvZ,38y68n,Alderdash,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"There are ones that in general can't be broken - but when you're building a map you're told only to rely on bedrock, since any of the others could change at any time.   (Take the glass in Valley and blaze cannons for example - when the map was built it should've been fine, but something was added to the game that changed the rules...)"
DvZ,38y68n,MasterDJV,2,Mon Jun 8 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea for the ugly bedrock look inside. We could retexture bedrock to look like stone to use in replacement to bedrock inside as it is explosionproof. Of course, Dwarves would be able to mine it, which is a major flaw to this. But if Niso and Rob could find a way to make it so Dwarves couldn't mine it..."
DvZ,38y68n,Doom_BringerMC,5,Mon Jun 8 11:59:08 2015 UTC,"If it's retextured, then although it would look like stone, it would still be bedrock. Dwarves wouldn't be able to mine it however it looks. :)"

DvZ,38y68n,Endergrill,2,Mon Jun 8 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"The problem with having something non-bedrock in between the two layers is it isn't just an aesthetic change. Adding in thicker walls would create spaces for mobs to create paths avoiding the main route of progression. And in terms of something aesthetically pleasing, there is very little you can do with only one layer other than just vary block types. Whilst having something prettier to look at in the aftermath of the game would be nice, functionality is far more important as people are more focused on playing the game then admiring the post-war landscape. It would also be incredibly time consuming for the Map maker; ensuring the Keep interior is sufficiently bedrocked, creating designs and patterns to cover the walls and tunnels, balancing the paths to not be hard on mobs but good for dwarves to defend, ensuring the progression is interesting..etc is some of the most time consuming aspects of map making, adding in a whole new layer, that is frankly pointless, just doesn't seem like a good use of time.

On that screenshot of The Machine, for example, the dwarves had filled the entrance with stone brick to create a short proc tunnel. I dug in against the bedrock on the left as a goblin to place my gobo boxes, which is a one block difference from the suggestion. Having two layers might be a problem in places where walls are high, so the outer layer is less likely to be destroyed, but anywhere the walls are made of stone brick and generally destroyed in the course of the game it doesn't make as much difference as you seem to be thinking. It's also not a new concept.   It would also be incredibly time consuming for the Map maker   This is an odd thing to read.

The two-layer walls isn't the only option though, my main suggestion to mapmakers was to just give a little more thought to how the map will look during the game.

The difference in this example is it's a flaw in the impromptu defences built by dwarves during the war. The whole point of a Proc hall is to direct mob flow to make it more manageable in a corridor, the design in itself is flawed because any mob with the ability to break blocks can just ignore it and make their own path in the filled in spaces. If nothing was built there, this wouldn't be an issue. But in terms of a keep, you're pre-building that feature into it without giving the Dwarves a benefit to it, they could build nothing and hold the corridor as is, and still have mobs sneaking by.    the primary concern shouldn't be knocking out lots of maps as fast as possible.   True. But that doesn't mean I'm willing to invest time in things that don't really matter for an issue that isn't really an issue.

If you make a map which is supposed to look like a dwarven keep, it's still supposed to look like a dwarven keep at the end of the game, just war-torn.   I find this statement ironic, since you're debating for maps to look more pretty when they're destroyed and then questioning why people would spend the time to make maps look pretty. The idea that the Dwarves would build a keep with the intent of it being destroyed just doesn't make sense to me. And the thing you're ignoring is that the visible bedrock isn't the result of the keep being destroyed, Gnome Dirt is the reinforcing material used to ensure the permanence of the keep. It's as much a part of the keep as the decorative blocks are. Something I like to do when designing keeps is minimise the amount of stonebrick used. Whilst it is a suitable Dwarven aesthetic, having walls that are just grey is just really ugly and visually uninteresting. Breaking it up with other materials, more durable materials adds to both the standing keeps aesthetic, and the war torn aesthetic as it usually means there are still blocks hanging around after the Goblins have been through."

That question was rhetorical, as you said you spent ages designing nice patterns. But if all that hard work can be quickly wiped out and left in a bedrock shell, would it not feel wasted?  I don't get what you mean by dwarves building a keep with the intent of it being destroyed. I don't think I suggested that should be the case, at least not intentionally. I meant that any structure, be it a dwarven keep, space hangar, tomb, ice cream van, etc. should still in an ideal world resemble that at the end of the game, rather than just an empty bedrock shell.

But if all that hard work can be quickly wiped out and left in a bedrock shell, would it not feel wasted?   The point of map design is it's a setting to facilitate the game. The whole point of people creating unique settings and differentiating aesthetics is to give the impression of that Last Stand happening in different places. It also gives an opportunity to contribute to the lore of the game. In that sense I don't believe the Dwarves would have built a Keep specifically for Bruce's last stand. These Keeps would of once served a purpose and for that reason would have been decorative. You're looking at it solely from a gameplay perspective and not as a greater narrative. DvZ at its heart is a Role Playing game, saying that a destroyed keep needs to reflect that means you have missed that point. The Bedrock isn't just a formality to ensure the map is still playable once it's been completely annihilated, it is the war torn keep. Whilst aesthetics aid the Role play there are some aspects that you kinda just have to role play."

You don't go to visit a castle and there's just a blank field as if a bulldozer came through.

When we add new things to players/monsters we work in the confines of MagicSpells. While Nisovin can add new things to magicspells, we rarely do that and look for easier to implement solutions. It's what allows us to have a quick turn around time on doing something like this.  So no, we can't without having to add a lot of extra work just for a single utility item.

DvZ,38ymfy,LittleBlast5,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:12:00 2015 UTC,Rob I recomend either making lamps not being able to stack on lamps or making lightbows fletiching cooldown to 5 secs so by the time someone gets the arrow they will fall

It prevents/kills procs with the really annoying damage tick and the pull(which I believe has been removed not sure though) makes it impossible for melee monsters to do anything
DvZ,38yech,Wifi_LC,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:37:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't been having much trouble with the damage tick anymore, or at least no more than I had before the update. There's times where I've been rolling a proc and it ended because of it, but there's also been times where I've still managed to kill whatever the warhammer was doing damage to. It can still be frustrating, but like I said, no more frustrating than the same thing happening before the update. Though I'm obviously just one person and can't speak for others."

I did not anticipate goblins though and would likely have made it differently if I'd known this could happen.  I think is is a problem with mobs and map, not purely either."

Stuff like lava ravines on asylum are cool because they're an obvious challenge, a feature of a map, but stuff like a place where withers and goblins can stand mindlessly spam onto dwarves who have no chance of dealing with it unless they're heroes isn't fun, its just frustrating and annoying. It's a bit like the bedrock trench on plains: sure, it's a challenge for dwarves, but it's one that's infuriating and doesn't lead to a fun experience."

DvZ,38wa5m,ewokaro,2,Sun Jun 7 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"You can make balanced maps without stupid frustrating elements (frost for instance). If you do want to make an anti-dwarf feature, something like grape's boltazeer or the bridges of rift are good examples. There is a lot of risk involved, and they cause deaths, but it's not a hard and fast ""You cannot deal with this"" to the dwarves.  Anyway, like teb said, it's a mix of the new mob mechanics and the maps that cause these situations, I just thing that enforcing hard and fast map elements on the dwarves beyond mobspawn protection generally leads to a lot of rage."

DvZ,38vyvk,TheDrCreeps,6,Mon Jun 8 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"mining fatigue actually doesn't do anything to the melee damage speed, just the mining speed. also, I what I think about the war hammer, is that it should cleave about 80% of the time, with as it is, less damage to the cleaved enemies, and less wormhole effect, so it is ok to attack and still get advantage over the war hammer dwarf, but it is still a weapon mobs have to fear. Bear in mind, this weapon can't proc, it needs the damage and the AOE effect for it to effectively kill mobs in an area. without the damage, or the AOE, it is going to be even worse then the Elven blade."
DvZ,38vyvk,Coathar44,3,Sun Jun 7 10:05:44 2015 UTC,Wither skeles may be a bit op but it's the only thing (besides goblins at final) killing dwarves because mobs are underpowered in mele.  That hammer makes it so you cant hit anyone because youre getting hit by the hammer.
DvZ,38vyvk,IllyiaSvara,2,Sun Jun 7 13:09:26 2015 UTC,"I personally feel the number of goblins well go down once they arent one of two viable mobs to actually play as currently. With Wither and Goblins as the only two mobs generally capable of the damage, destruction and push back needed to progress the game we shall only see mass goblins or withers with a few others thrown in. All the other mobs right now are incredibly weakened due to the new weapons. The special mobs are hardly any stronger than regular mobs right now. I've posted this in a few other threads so not really gonna post what currently seems to utterly destroy them here again but yeah.  Elvish blade however I feel needs looked at. As a mob you are dead with this, the only one that might survive is a golem. The poison length is a death sentance. It even counters lifesteal of wolves and zombies in anything apart from a mass of dwarves with rune blades. Poison in minecraft is and always has been an incredibly powerful negative effect. Irrespective of resistances (vanilla) you take the same damage. The ticking of damage can altar jumping and slows down movement. Prevents goblins going kaboom.  Its extremely strong. Perhaps not as bad as the warhammer. And not so good in zombie masses it is however the perfect tool for just destroying player mobs."
DvZ,38vyvk,Morvereth,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:44:47 2015 UTC,Yeah elvish blade really feels OP right now. Or atleast its not perhaps working as intended. It is possible to outlast it as wolf by lifestealing carefully only hitting different dwarves one or two times. so that you dont get into their notice and take any extra damage. But it sure is hard. Most of the times you are just doomed waiting for your death.

Monsters get bounced around and are unable to do anything and my procs are always cut short when some warhammer comes up and starts knocking everything away with damage ticks so I can't proc them.  They are by far the most non team friendly weapon in the game so far.
DvZ,38vlx4,Stadic777,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:25:23 2015 UTC,"I think that warhammers are kind of neat if used correctly. Warhammer class players should be tanks that sit on top of shrine and keep monsters away. Or jumps in to protect when someone is bleeding and getting low by standing near hammering like madman keeping wolfs and venomburners away.   There are plenty of other ways to cancel procs from teammates, first of them is someone else having a proc, second is everyone standing between you and monsters hitbox, third nisovins warp hole vacuuming all monsters out of reach, 4 bruce using horn just when you had proc...  Warhammer is team friendly if used such way. When one uses warhammer and sees that someone near has proc should be polite and back off."

I mean not much point to the other classes given the new weapons, even the specials are kinda meh with the new weapons now sadly. Wolf < Poison blade, hammer+ hornproc/bowproc  Golem < Rangers Bow K.O  Spiderling < everything though thats normal :p Rat< Hammer Time. Like AOE of hammer makes not having at least one hammer defendning shrine kinda silly. See a rat no longer a rat. See a goblin, what was that matey. See a zombie, hey hey zombie eat hammer. VenomBurner pretty much normal for its gameplay. Ogre < Hammertime bishes.  Jumping Skelly, Super jump and swing non stop only way to do anything with it. Bopen- Bugged in the games I played so can't say anything here  Sadly we get left with our poor poor withers and goblins.   Goblins the hero DvZ deserves, but not the one it needs right now.

That being said I play it with a custom class which is essentially the Berserker class but with Dragonskin Bow instead of Crossbow. I find that with just the Axes Proc I can cut about 25 - 30 seconds off the cooldown, with the Bow Proc I can cut maybe 10 seconds off as well.

It doesn't even accomplish much when you can do it other than sometimes knocking dwarves away from the shrine because Goblins don't do much damage. It's also very hard to pull off and requires a lot of coordination (like, voice chat of some kind is a must. Teamspeak in our case), much harder than it looks; especially if the dwarves start shooting at you, one falling off can ruin the whole operation."

Creepers are replaced by goblins, which can place a 'gobo boom box' or throw it, which explodes and destroys walls. They have a bunch of upgrades, with the ultimate upgrade being either invulnerability to proc or the ability to blow themselves up, which is basically what creepers were.  There's also ogres, which are green zombie pigmen, which as far as I can tell are basically Jasper from the Simpsons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQR-cPXlmY They have a paddle with knockback II."

The Monster Hero event is basically pre-warned with a sound of like a large creature stomping. After this all mobs that try to spawn are held in the lobby with an on-screen timer for 30 seconds. Once the timer ends, a player is selected as the Mob Hero and all mobs spawn in at once. For Bopen, he is a Wither Skeleton riding a Skeleton Horse. The Wave turns everyone into skeletons with Super Jump and spawns them with a Rusty Cutless (but the inventory seems to be buggy for this event). As for Bopen himself, he was very slow moving and when I opened my inventory I lost all the items he spawns with so I have no idea what they are/do. Though it seems his horse is immortal which has resulted in Dwarves riding horses and even Golems. This has since been fixed so his horse dies with him.  Edits: New info."

DvZ,38s2x2,NikoUY,5,Sun Jun 7 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"I have been playing as a Warrior to see how stuff work ingame before buying anything, this is what Warrior has:   Greater Runbalde (Proc) Dragonskin Bow (Bow Proc every 30 secs) Jiimmy Juice (Auto Heal) Runeblessed Armor (Extra Durability) 10 Wiggly Wrenches 1 Stack of Torches 1 Stack of Mortar 2 Stacks of Cobble (maybe 1.5, can't remember)   The class is in general really fun to play, the Bow is amazing if you are used to being risky, procing a lot and move all over the place... you can do stuff like turning around and spamming the bow for a proc after you lost you main proc and kinda chain it, also instead of running around trying to kill things I am actually using the bow, like a lot, really the most fun I had with the bow since AIs were introduced (probably most fun I had with the bow ever), the fact that is useful the whole game is amazing.  The basic stuff is nice but you can easily get them and the wrenches are waaaaay to many, I only used 2 in the two games I played, it might be because I'm using the bow way more but I feel like that many wrenches is a waste, I would prefer to have 5 wrenches and use the extra point on SuperMortar or/and Slabs.  The thing that is really really annoying  about this class is the Auto Heal, the thing is cool and all but if you know how to heal you are going to double heal A LOT, I think I double healed 95% of the times the thing activated, also is possible to triple heal with this, if you double heal as sometimes happens and the ale auto heals you then you can triple heal... if you are decent healing I wouldn't recomend you to get the ale, you will waste a lot of mana.  This class fits exactly my playstyle, I don't think I would enjoy the other classes as much, I would probably just use this class if you replace the Auto Heal with Holy Ale, Regrowth Star or just a normal Healing Ale, based on this I'm considering getting something like this:   Greater Runbalde Dragonskin Bow Holy Ale Runeblessed Armor or Massive Quiver (I really enjoyed using the bow) 5 Wiggly Wrenches If I choose Massive Quiver, a combination of Slabs and Super Mortar.   Edit: after doing some math I don't think it has Runeblessed Armor, but it feels really durable anyways xD.  Edit2: listen to Doom."
DvZ,38s2x2,Rurikar,5,Sat Jun 6 11:54:49 2015 UTC,if you know how to heal you are going to double heal A LOT   Auto heal has no cool down. You shouldn't even have potion on your bar. If anything I should just disable the ability to heal with the autoheal potion.

Forgive me if I've misunderstood something, but Jimmy Juice seems like a perfect opportunity for people to practice healing with a normal ale without risking their lives, because switching to heal quickly is one of the hardest things for new players to get used to.

DvZ,38s2x2,Doom_BringerMC,2,Sun Jun 7 08:33:01 2015 UTC,"I find Auto-Heal is the best Potion for a Ranger class. You can bow duel skeletons and not be having to switch away to heal, this is especially useful in fighting Withers. In melee combat however not so much, you take damage way to quickly and it rapidly drains mana, enough to prevent sustained combat. On a Ranger though, I find I can out bow most Withers without losing a lot of mana."
DvZ,38s2x2,keaganwill,2,Sun Jun 7 11:50:26 2015 UTC,I looked at how the jimmy juice worked for a little while and it appears that if you get dmged down to like 5 hearts from 12 or so in one shot the jimmy juice does not trigger until you are hit a second time... this appears to give the chance of getting hit for that 5 or so hearts you have remaining letting you die

This means Wither Skeletons should only do 37.5 damage base.  Dwarves have 80% resistance which means this damage should be 7.5 not included the wither effect itself. There should be no monster attack that does 10.5 damage which is what is required to skip over the auto-heal."

Everyone's currently a guinea pig anyway, as a lot of items and abilities will need balancing based on how games play out. However I'd say that not having proc wasn't the end of the world in the game I played earlier, despite never having had to ever play without it before (I had plenty of gold in Mr Bank at the beginning of last June). You just have to rely a bit on other players, and I quite liked that. I think if everyone has different abilities, it could create lots of opportunities for team play.

DvZ,38s2x2,Doom_BringerMC,2,Sat Jun 6 09:47:46 2015 UTC,"Och, that'd definitely true, Mill, but with limited funds, most folk will want some kind of idea of what things do before they buy them.   Though I'm kind of hoping that there'll be a second reset at some point once it's settled exactly what things do and what's being kept/changed/tweaked.  As to the 'having proc' thing, I'm sure it's not the end of the world not having it! But I've no interest in the poison sword concept, so if I'd bought Ranger and then discovered that was the setup, I would've been pretty disappointed."
DvZ,38s2x2,5ilver42,2,Sat Jun 6 10:54:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the loadout descriptions convey most of the information, this was my main concern with the price increases but so far everything I've looked at gives a very clear indication of what it does. Also it seems you earn a lot more gold from a game so the pricing isn't as significant as it seems. I will say if you're looking to play a game the Mob experience currently is a bit tedious. There are some things that need amending (as expected) and a lot of the games have hit 10,000 kills and are running over an hour long."
DvZ,38s2x2,keaganwill,3,Sat Jun 6 12:28:44 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, Doom. I understand that they are still balancing things and will hopefully change, but each of the games I've been in as a mob were reaching the line of not being fun many many times. Constant poison blade damage and being thrown around with the war hammers specifically. :(  The goblins are a lot of fun though, but it never felt like they were entirely usefully, like the explosions didn't do that much of anything. From the perception of the goblins anyway, from the dwarf side it may be the opposite.  Rob and Nisovin have made the game we know and love, so I trust that with time this will get polished into something wonderful again, just at the moment it feels rough and more dwarf biased that it ha ever been.  To me anyway. :)"
DvZ,38s2x2,Imhotep0,2,Sat Jun 6 17:25:00 2015 UTC,From a dwarves perspective I have yet to be afraid of goblins... The tnt blasts deal all of about 3 dmg  In mass amounts that could add up but even with huge amounts I have not seen it
DvZ,38s2x2,Doom_BringerMC,2,Sat Jun 6 19:52:36 2015 UTC,"a lot of the games have hit 10,000 kills and are running over an hour long   That isn't unexpected though, limiting the server to super jimmy only means that mob mana gain will be slower (no one dying to AI) and the majority of the players will be very good at surviving.  I'm not gonna post any serious opinions of my own until I've played a good amount of games, though. Still out ATM so I haven't even played one ;-;"
DvZ,38s2x2,Splax77,2,Sat Jun 6 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"It just seems the Mobs are underpowered currently. The Warhammer and Elven blade has rendered most melee mobs redundant as the wormhole effect the Warhammer gives makes it impossible to hit someone, the poison makes it difficult to run, jump and an obvious target to players. I haven't even seen a zombie kill today, mostly skellie kills (with the buffed wither) and the occasional special.    And a player having Super Jimmy isn't necessarily indicative of them being better at the game, there have been some deaths to AI's in the games I've been in. This and the fact the Mob team has just as many experienced players as the Dwarves."
DvZ,38s47w,Kreamator,4,Sat Jun 6 09:41:41 2015 UTC,"Since it's kills are still significant, I think having some other sound playing to tell the player they got a kill would be pretty nice.   I like this idea. I'll make it happen. I wanna make the Malice Axe talk to you when you haven't used the proc in awhile. This will make it so in the startup, he's more lore based weapon, but not as annoying in combat because your constantly using it.   Second bit of change I'd love to see, just to have the Axe be an actual tool like an Axe, Pick, or Hoe rather than a dye. Something about ""I AM THE AXE OF DEATH"" isnt as cool when from 3rd person it looks a bit silly due to it not being held by the player properly.   Hypixel Warlord weapons blew me away. By the end of summer, I'm really hoping to make all our weapons 3D and fancy, but I'm currently looking for another active 3D modeler with some good talent and minecraft knowledge."

DvZ,38s47w,TheDrCreeps,2,Sat Jun 6 13:08:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need to change the item to fix the appearance of the Axe in 3rd Person.

DvZ,38s47w,Doom_BringerMC,2,Sat Jun 6 13:56:11 2015 UTC,I don't personally know how to do this.

DvZ,38rse0,charzard4261,2,Sat Jun 6 08:17:16 2015 UTC,Currently rolling what I'm calling the defensive tank  Warhammer for crowd control and massive damage.  Runeblessed Armour and 20 Wrenches to be able to stand and fight for as long as possible.  The Lightbow because its cool :P Crossbow/Dragonskin would probably be better here but I'll have to try them out.  Thats what I'm rolling for now but will be trying stuff out all weekend to see what I like best :D
DvZ,38rse0,WhatTheHellMan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:35:27 2015 UTC,I like.  But if you wanted to be a really defensive tank you should roll the ale that gives you absorb hearts but I can tell that you probably don't have the room for that unless you want to just use a regular bow  I'm eager to try this class though!
DvZ,38rse0,Imhotep0,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:58:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it yet but I can't see the 2 absp. hearts being much use at all. Feels like some bad compromise between proc hearts and no proc hearts, from the discussions before about dwarf invulnerability and AIs :p"

DvZ,38rse0,SGT_JACKAL,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:04:57 2015 UTC,Yea man.  I mean.  Unless Rob or Nis decide to do away with it and/or nerf it.  The mana cost right now that it cost to use isn't much and you regen the mana faster than you use it really.  It also heals yourself the same as a regular ale and the range seems pretty endless so long as you can see the player.  It heals for 1 heart though only but you can hold down the right click instead of click spamming
DvZ,38rse0,WhatTheHellMan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:22:26 2015 UTC,"You know I was thinking about just going the pally class and then wrenches but that one upgrade has changed it all. I loved the star so much on the gym when I was Ked and are so looking forward to using it again every game now, I also didn't see it in the loadout is there a few upgrade that got added that we didn't see as well? So excited to look at them all and pick them apart"
DvZ,38rse0,SGT_JACKAL,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah stuff has been changed since the tests with /loadout  You do have to buy the stuff with gold now, you dont just have everything to choose from :P"
DvZ,38rse0,Juliandroid98,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:45:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I already knew that it is just I didn't see the healing star anywhere when I looked at all the upgrades so was just wondering if a lot of stuff got added after /loadout was removed or just a few things

Try out your class and think of a cool name to go with it =D                       Right now with the LightBow and the Evenom Blade and the other items makes me think of a Rouge Ranger of sorts

DvZ,38rse0,Input_Logic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:08:42 2015 UTC,So what would you call this class then?  Elvish Ranger Class?
DvZ,38rse0,Input_Logic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:14:15 2015 UTC,"Currently running a Crossbow centered class  I'd much rather run the Axe of Malice but I can't afford it currently as I went for a lot of other upgrades as well so I'm instead running Proc. Proc isn't entirely useless though the Crossbow can be used to soften mobs to attain a Proc. AIs take 3 hits to kill with the Crossbow so hitting them twice softens them to a one hit kill. Proc is also useful for lategame, but with goblins easily ending procs I feel that it's losing usefulness  The Crossbow at first glance may not appear to be an amazing weapon (nor does it look good....) but after using it a bit it's amazing for taking out skeletons, goblins and special monsters that aren't venomburners. It one shots the skeletons even at point blank range allowing you to run straight up to a skele and shoot it in the face, maxed withers take two shots or a shot and two melee hits and goblins take two shots.  The Studded Runeleather allows for increased mobility making it easier to run between targets. The decreased dura doesn't really matter as you outspeed AIs and aren't really getting into heavy melee it's hit and run to take out player monsters.  I have Holy Ale on this set because I feel that it really helps with approches to competent withers as it gives you those two extra hearts which can be useful.  Wrenches are there to repair the Studded Runeleather because it degrades quickly if you get into a melee.  Edit: Just found out this is nearly identical to one of the default classes I should really learn how to save my gold :s"

URL is what is being worked on and presented, whatever rob wants to work on, let him work on it. Don't plauge him with the questions about the other thing he's still working on. It'll get annoying very quickly, and could potentially ruin the night for him. We don't want this. Let thing roll out when they are ready.  Edit: forgot to mention this.

DvZ,38qnne,Zeeeeeon,8,Sat Jun 6 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"You've missed a few big updates since the Gym, the game has changed quite significantly since then. Rob hasn't made any DvZ video content for a while, but this video from last year should give you a reasonable understanding of how the game's moved on since the Gym: https://youtu.be/WZWA7XZTrnU  Since that video was made, there have been a few small changes, the largest of which is that gold is now a shared resource among all dwarves and repairing armour uses gold from a communal gold pool, which can lead to games ending simply because dwarves don't have enough gold.  This weekend there's a large update coming out, which you can read a summary of here: https://trello.com/c/btkoUZ0M/102-summer-update-changes There are a few videos by various people of some recent test games for the update, which have been posted on this subreddit, though it might just be confusing to watch those because a lot of things were tested but not implemented.  Edit: Trying to think of the most notable changes you might care about since the Gym, but there are a lot of changes and I don't want this list to go on forever. Others will probably contribute more below, and for a general overview there's a wiki: http://dwarves-vs-zombies.wikia.com/wiki/Dwarves_vs._Zombies_Wiki   Lots of new maps. The summer update will have a rotation of a new version of Mt Willakers, and a map called Plains which is actually a different map each time with BYOK gameplay, as well as 3 other maps. The map rotation is changed quite regularly now. Playing games earns you gold, which you can spend on upgrades in the lobby. The update is adding a class/loadout system to customise which upgrades are active at any given time, to suit your playstyle. Monsters also have upgrades, which unlike dwarf upgrades are unique to each round of DvZ (e.g. if you upgrade zombie fully in one game, next time you play zombie you'll need to start again). Monsters earn mana for time played, as well as from breaking torches, and get a mana boost when dwarves die, and this is used to upgrade. For zombie this is a single path whereas skeletons have multiple paths to choose from. Creepers are being removed and replaced with goblins, which are retextured creepers. There are AI zombies now. Lots of them. Zombies (once fully upgraded), digging zombies and wolves get 'Fury of the Night' which gives them strength I in darkness. The summer update will also make this apply to AI zombies. The game is a lot more dependent on the heroes, though I believe these are still being tweaked at the moment. Multiple shrines, must be captured in order. Monsters who stray too far past the current shrine get killed. Super mortar was added which has mostly made normal mortar redundant after monster release. It's a purchasable upgrade which turns stone blue and makes it much tougher. Using regular mortar before plague also turns stuff blue."
DvZ,38qnne,Tomlough,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks, I just played a game and I killed an AI zombie. I don't think it gave me a proc, is that normal?"
DvZ,38qnne,Zeeeeeon,6,Sat Jun 6 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"The proc is one of the upgrades, so new players won't have it to begin with. At time of posting, the upgrades are disabled because they're starting to roll out the summer update, but once the update's done there will be alternatives to the proc such as berserk (which I won't give details on because I think they're subject to change).  If you have the proc unlocked and enabled, the AIs do give procs though :)"
DvZ,38qnne,Tomlough,3,Sat Jun 6 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"that's kinda silly, I would've lived had I had a proc :("
DvZ,38qnne,Zeeeeeon,3,Sat Jun 6 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think the idea behind making people buy the proc was to help newer players understand how the proc works, since they'd have to read the information about it in the upgrade menu."

DvZ,38l8mq,LittleBlast5,2,Thu Jun 4 23:02:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have time right now to do a proper bedrock test, but here are some comments about the map in general, in no particular order.   I'm really not fond of the idea of maps being designed with teleporters in mind. That's a mechanic which was added to make existing maps work in the game rather than scrap the whole map. If your map is too big without teleporters, your map is too big. The mob spawn interior feels unfinished, or even like some chunk corruption's occurred. The plain bedrock wall, although people will mostly have their backs to it, immediately breaks the illusion for any monsters who turn round. Edit - Looking again at your screenshots, it seems like that back wall's supposed to be nether brick. Possibly I broke the map, but it might be worth checking to be sure that wall is definitely there. This sign is blank on both sides so I don't know if it's important. The path from second shrine is still not pleasant to traverse. Also remember that this is supposed to have been made by dwarves, who I don't believe would have had any trouble flattening out small bumps in the terrain like this. I don't think Nisovin's first point on the Trello about the walk from mob spawn to first shrine has really been addressed, as far as I can tell the only thing that's changed is the block palette? The bridges with lava under them leading to the fourth shrine feel like a very artificial gameplay choice, and not one I think will result in interesting enough gameplay to excuse their weird appearance. Perhaps they're inspired by the bridge on Molgan, but the lava under that bridge actually led somewhere useful, whereas anyone who falls in here will just be led back to another lava bridge. There seems to be a secret shrine room lodged in the bedrock near final, is that intentional? It's very obvious that you've glued a couple of maps together, with each map's saws, blacksmith stations, etc. intact. There's a clear aesthetic difference between the maps and there is no real sense of flow throughout the map. The map's just way, way too big, which again is the result of the two maps being combined.   My best advice would be to unglue the two maps, pick one and work on that alone. They don't make sense together, and the map is too big with both combined."
DvZ,38l8mq,Tomlough,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:55:24 2015 UTC,I believe he posted each of the maps
DvZ,38l8mq,keaganwill,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:36:01 2015 UTC,"Yes i did, the two maps compliment each other IMO"
DvZ,38l8mq,Tomlough,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:03:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry about how unorganized this is.  The path to first now has extra ways to assault it.  Yes the map is a combination of two maps. The extra saws and stuff is to make it less tedious on the dwarves who are setting up defences at 4th-6th. The combination of the maps solved both of their major flaws, the valley being to hard and the city being to easy. Nis has said that the size is fine. I know not of this secret shrine, probably just a glitch that happened when i merged the maps. Is that one bump really such an issue? The lava bridges are to make proc halling a bit harder."
DvZ,38l8mq,NaquIma,3,Fri Jun 5 10:28:20 2015 UTC,"The path to first now has extra ways to assault it.   Apologies. Is that a function of the teleporter? Because otherwise I can't see an alternative route past this: http://imgur.com/mBYM045   Nis has said that the size is fine.   He didn't say it's fine:   The map is obviously very large, but I think it has the potential to be unique. The shrine distances are short enough that it might work. I'm afraid that dwarves might begin to feel lost in certain places though, especially during the early game.   In other words, map's too big but it could be made to work (see also: Arkansium, Scorched Canyon). My criticism is that nothing is gained by the map being so large, and in that case it would be better to revert to Nisovin's original instruction that maps should have ""at most four shrines, but three is the best number"". If you're simply aiming to get off the unused list on Trello then sure, but if you want to make a map which players will enjoy and happily play over and over, consider the advice of players. It's possible to play a game of DvZ on any map, but a fun game requires a well-designed map.  As for the other points, your responses are too dismissive for me to believe you really care about feedback."
DvZ,38l8mq,ArcaneWarrior303,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:17:36 2015 UTC,"It is a function of the teleporter. There is a cave by the platform mobs can use to get behind the dwarves. And how did my other points seem dismissive? I was simply stating certain things about decisions i made. I will fix that bump though because the more i think about it the more its annoying me.  And about the size, at least in my opinion, i feel like it just makes it a bit more interesting, not having to do the same basic defense setup i see on most small maps.  Also i do agree on the lava bridge point, i do need to fix them up.  Again sorry if i seemed dismissive, i do appreciate feedback."

DvZ,38jq1m,FallDamage312,2,Thu Jun 4 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"There is official ""season"" as much as a marker. Season 1: Bruce's Gym Alpha. Season 2: Bruce's Gym Beta. Season 3: DvZ on PMC. Season 4: PMC June update. Season 5: DvZ on BW."
DvZ,38jq1m,JTHousek1,3,Thu Jun 4 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"You do know there was an ""official release"" of the Gym, which was coined as season 1 by Rob? Just something of note."
DvZ,38jq1m,system0101,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"This is good to know. I think I only played season 2 (maybe the tail end of s1 too), and one or two matches in s5."
DvZ,38jq1m,Splax77,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"So DvZ just magically came into existence when the gym happened? The game was around as a stream only event for like 2 years before that, trying to split the history of the game into ""seasons"" is just a nonsensical and purely arbitrary distinction that does nothing but cause confusion."
DvZ,38jq1m,Imanota,6,Fri Jun 5 17:07:11 2015 UTC,I think my favorite part is that players had a chance to make new maps that could be tested and played on without having to be sent through email or won through a contest. it led to a lot of creations and showed how well fan interaction could be
DvZ,38jq1m,LittleBlast5,2,Thu Jun 4 18:16:08 2015 UTC,100% agree

Probably a dozen other things I'm forgetting, too. Might add some more later."
DvZ,38jq1m,mineman00567,8,Thu Jun 4 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeahhhh we're not calling this DvZ ""Season 5"", I don't know what break down your using, but that's weird to say anyway."
DvZ,38jq1m,Rurikar,3,Thu Jun 4 20:29:03 2015 UTC,"I'm aware, It's a term I've seen a few players use, and It's a lot easier then typing out the dates."
DvZ,38jq1m,Negnar_Holf,3,Thu Jun 4 21:05:28 2015 UTC,Why not call it DVZ 5.0? DvZ Season 5 sounds too much like a tv show...
DvZ,38jq1m,Sgt_14tjyd,4,Thu Jun 4 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"Because where is this number coming from? Arbitrarily counted versions? It's just Dwarves vs Zombies, there is no version number we have used so it seems weird for you guys to use one."

DvZ,38jq1m,MasterOfSpasms,5,Fri Jun 5 04:45:19 2015 UTC,"Could someone tell me what happened in each season 1-5? Like.. Which season was PMC in?   Anyways... My favorite moment has to be when Nis was testing armor changes on West Delphia (armor could not break, when 0durability you only lost 1 mana per seccond.) I was Bruce during the game, and around 6k when we were holding the area after the first shrine, we ran out of gold. Everyone called ""gg, and nice game"" and then I was all like, ""I DONT NEED GOLD... I DEFY DEATH!!"" And proceeded to hold that hallway, with 10 other ppl protecting the shrine to maintain their armor durability. By having 0 durability on all my armor and losing 1 mana constantly, I was forced to keep a proc going to gain absorption hearts so i wouldnt have to use my ale and lose 100 mana + the -1 every second. By staying alive without having to heal, I slowly gained scav.gold over time. The game ended around 11k-ish when NisovinsIllusion died and i was the last one on the final shrine. I never died to gold though... The shrine blew up while I was still alive...  The reason that was so memorable for me, was because i had finally reached my goal of getting a 10k game as Bruce :3"
DvZ,38jq1m,Adnerp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:49:13 2015 UTC,Pmc was season 3 (before june update) and season 4 (after june update)
DvZ,38jq1m,5ilver42,5,Thu Jun 4 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely the shift in the game away from the competitive play. Not just because it helped to weed out a lot of the harmful players and attitudes, but because on a personal level I stopped playing the game in a way that was unhealthy for me. The game is much more enjoyable for me now because of that, so its definitely my favorite thing to happen to the game.  But as for specific moments, I can't really decide on any one. Any of the times where I got a chance to hang out with good friends of mine or even make new friends are tied for #1."
DvZ,38jq1m,Girafferider133,3,Thu Jun 4 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"Welp, here goes:   Getting to delve deeper into the community Having a blast with everyone in TS and on Reddit Finishing off my first map with help from friends Hitting 70k kills after a whopping 378 games Achieving a personal record of 146 kills in a single PROC Getting supporting comments from Rob for artwork Getting to play with, in my opinion, the best group of people in all of Minecraft"
DvZ,38jq1m,NaquIma,3,Thu Jun 4 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"I had a list of moments that got a bit off topic, so I'll just shorten it to these two games:  First, I was a Jimmy on a West Delphia game.  There was only Bruce (WiiWatcher) as the hero, and CptAmazing was recording for his return to recording DvZ games after a hiatus.  During that game, there were a lot of newer players who decided to fall back early into the defense of both first and second shrine.  Cpt was trying to make proc halls to final as fast as possible, but the real fun of the game was at second shrine where Wii and I went crazy by ourselves trying to protect the shrine (mind you, there were probably about 16 dwarves still alive at that point).  The two of us held it for a little while before we had to fall back, but someone in monster chat commented that if it wasn't for us two specifically, the game would have ended very quickly.  I didn't catch that chat clip in the game at that time, but when I saw it watching Cpt's video I felt accomplished.  Cpt even gave me props in his video as he knew me as a solid player even back then.  Finally, I was playing a hero game (Bruce) on a map I do not remember.  I was doing my usual Brucey thing; being the vanguard and trying to actively take down as many specials (and others) as I could before they made it to final.  Two monsters said things that day that I will not forget.  First, a monster in global said they should focus Bruce down.  A player, someone whom I acknowledge as being an awesome player, replied in global chat to not even try as this Bruce will never die.  Second, during a golem spawn event, another player said in global, ""Don't bother being a golem; Bruce will proc you before you even make it into the hall.""  Both players were right on both counts.  While my most memorable moments seem to come from community acknowledgement, I also dabbled this ""season"" with contributing to the community by writing up combat tactics for the Wiki and trying out making videos for Youtube.  I am eager to continue with my work on tactics for the (new) Wiki, though the jury is still out for the making of videos.  Overall, I am happy with my personal accomplishments with DvZ this ""season"" (and my own accomplishments for trying something I've never done before [posting videos]) and I am greatly looking forward to the next ""season"".  Edit: yes, this was the short version."

I joined right before shields were removed and remained very active. My favorite thing has been meeting so many great players and getting to play the game with them. So many people call this community toxic, and think it's bad, but in reality this is one of the best communities a minecraft server could have. There are so many great people who help you out and make you feel welcome."

The first experience with share gold was a delight as well.  And lastly. During the fast, faster, and fastest game. I got Bruce and fell in the ravine on Raenil. Daragor swooped down, picked me up, and dropped me back at the front wall. Then later when I went down there to save a Jimmy, Daragor fireballed me because I kept shooting him with Excaliju."

DvZ,38jcgm,Tundra1232,11,Thu Jun 4 16:35:36 2015 UTC,"Additionally, creeper blasts are unaffected by walls.  Trying to navigate a maze only gives a dwarf little distance between creeper explosions. Creepers tend to gang at the start of a maze and explode to tear it down.  This causes at best armor/gold damage and at worst death for unprepared dwarves."
DvZ,38jcgm,Adnerp,11,Thu Jun 4 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"Defences need to be thick, the typical one-block mazes are very easily degraded by monsters. Also, mazes become a maze for dwarves too, making it easy for dwarves too get lost or stuck.  They're also really not that fun."

DvZ,38jcgm,ewokaro,4,Thu Jun 4 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"I normally start by saying that they slow dwarves down more than they do monsters, because of the amount of knockback dwarves get whilst surrounded by monsters, monsters getting in the way of digging or pillaring, mobs' superior mobility, ability to destroy blocks and place vines, and their night vision. However, if Jimmy's explanation for building a maze is something other than ""it slows them down"", see if you can counter their claim. Generally people build these things because they think it's a good idea, so it's worth finding out, if you've got time, why they think it's a good idea. Then it's easier to explain to them why it's not."
DvZ,38jcgm,MillicentOak,5,Thu Jun 4 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"Mazes are a huge disadvantage against creepers, creeper explosion ignores walls, so Dwarves can die quickly if there are at least 3 creepers."

DvZ,38f7fg,MillicentOak,2,Wed Jun 3 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"A while back Rob gave some feedback on some lag I was having, which you may find informative. It sounds like, unlike what I had at that time, you have at least some downstream lag. Whether it's just that or both directions you can find out if you're in a call with someone - find out if your player is still moving in game when you get your lag. If he freezes, then it's the overall connection quality dropping. If not, you may find that it's downstream-only. If it's the connection quality overall, then it may be worth connecting to the router via a cable for a few tests to see if it continues. If it's down only, it could be competing traffic.  Good luck!"
DvZ,38f7fg,zzCratoszz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:52:49 2015 UTC,I have 1 question. Did everything freeze before you got the lag shown in the video? That lag is exactly what happens after everythng has unfrozen and I just watch my health drop. Anyways thanks for helping out.
DvZ,38f7fg,zzCratoszz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:57:54 2015 UTC,"It actually didn't, what happened before then was just a typical Doge creeper blast, no freezing. I hit record once I realised that I hadn't been ""able"" to hit the zombie in question (if Rob's explanation is correct, which I believe it is, then those hits wouldn't reach the server til much later). I'd had some similar issues earlier in the game, but as I said, no freezing. If other people are freezing, that suggests to me that you're not receiving (timely) updates about what they're doing i.e., you have downstream lag. With all that said, I'm not an expert, I may be misinterpreting the advice Rob gave."
DvZ,38f7fg,Endergrill,2,Wed Jun 3 23:44:12 2015 UTC,I would also check your resource monitor for disk and cpu usage. Make sure when playing these are not sitting at 100%. If it isn't your internet connection I suspect its your disk speed.

DvZ,38f7fg,Endergrill,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:59:03 2015 UTC,Minecraft is very much a cpu hog. But dvz is even more of a cpu hog. Just run resource monitor in the background and when the freeze happens check if anything is maxed. If its cpu or disk you know where your bottle neck is.
DvZ,38f7fg,zzCratoszz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:20:29 2015 UTC,"Oh god my laptop did that to me again yesterday, a simple restart fixed it but that is really annoying!"
DvZ,38f7fg,Endergrill,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:21:34 2015 UTC,Oh. Maybe you have background programs running you don't need. Check your resource monitor under overview. It should say everything that is running. Just stop or even uninstall what you don't want. Also I would highly suggest ccleaner if you don't already have it. Its very good at removing unused files and cleaning your computer.
DvZ,38f7fg,zzCratoszz,2,Wed Jun 3 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"It was only running skype. I did check everything, I turned it on, it was super slow so I checked the disk and it claimed to be at 100% and using all 7 gigs which was bs. I restarted it, started the same programs and it was fine.   The only thing that was different with my pc yesterday was the windows 10 reminder, and I honestly don't think that caused an issue. Disk running at 100% is also a known windows 8 issue according to every post I could find about it. It told me to restart my pc, and it worked. Simple as that.   I only use it for skype, there is absolutely nothing I could uninstall because I only have skype and minecraft on it. Ccleaner also never tells me to remove anything major so that is also not an issue. :)"
DvZ,38f7fg,NikoUY,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:56:19 2015 UTC,Well if it isn't hidden background programs then maybe its a full or fragmented disk.
DvZ,38f7fg,Jasga,2,Thu Jun 4 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"As I said it is a known issue, it is not full. My laptop is a year old and I literally only use it for skype."

DvZ,38f7fg,Jasga,2,Thu Jun 4 02:16:58 2015 UTC,"As everyone else said, try using a cable instead of Wifi, you might want to try restarting your router/modem and even try with other router/modem or with another PC, you should also make sure it only happens with this server to discard things.  if the problem still presists and you checked everything else on your end then you could try to figure out if the problem is in some of the nodes the connection is going through using something like WinMTR if you are on Windows (mtr on linux). That tool will send ICMP packets to all the nodes between you and the server which will tell you the state of the connection to the servers, the program will tell you the % of packets lost and the latency to each server.   If you see a node with high % of packets lost and also a similar % on the nodes after the first node with problems then probably that first node is having problems, the reason why you might see a high % of packet lost on a server but not in the others is because nodes sometmies ratelimit ICMP requests or they just don't respond to them at all.  If you found a node with problems you have a couple of options, if you have a Dynamic IP (your ip changes every so often/ when you restart your modem) then changing your IP might give you a new route that skips this node (you can check if you have a new route using the same program, on linux you need to restart the program no idea if that is the case on Window), you might need to do it a couple of times until your route changes, in case you have a Static IP then you could call your ISP and ask them to give you a new route (which might or might not happen depending of the ISP). The second option you have to skip the faulty node is to use a VPN or a Proxy to force a new route to the server, if you do this basically you are connecting to another server (the VPN or Proxy) and then connecting to the DvZ server which probably will take you trough a totally different route, you can find some cheap VPNs if you search on google, most of them will have a free period that you can use to test, I would recomend you to get one with a few servers so you have more than one option."

However an influx of new players means that we have he chance to meet new people and you have to remember that the new players which will be coming ini the community are Rob's and the other Wizard's subscribers so chances are that the majority may not e as bad as the general ""minecraft community""....I dont think DvZ will ever become a big minecraft server certainty never larger than a few thousand fans as opposed to the millions of Jimmies who go and play on servers such as mineplex overcast or the hive daily."

DvZ,38arok,MillicentOak,5,Wed Jun 3 00:21:07 2015 UTC,There must have been an extreme lack of withers in your games :P that 8% is pretty small
DvZ,38arok,Wifi_LC,9,Wed Jun 3 00:25:33 2015 UTC,"You may think so, but 28 games was enough to see things steady out quite a bit. Note that this is only in the last few weeks, so from after the wither nerf. It also, of course, doesn't include test games."
DvZ,38arok,FallDamage312,5,Wed Jun 3 00:27:52 2015 UTC,Participating in plenty of those Mill's tests I'll have to say that Knockback Skeletons are pretty much as deadly as Wither Skeletons. But that's unofficial data;p
DvZ,38arok,Tomlough,5,Wed Jun 3 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"The AI might be distorting the data a little. It's reasonable to assume a portion of those zombie kills, for example, are players taking credit for AI kills, but it's probably less common for the same to happen with skeletons."
DvZ,38arok,goalie1248,2,Wed Jun 3 09:50:37 2015 UTC,"While this is possible, the first half of each game was typically characterised by a lack of dwarves dying to zombies. It's only in the second half of the game that the zombie kills started to rack up, by which point the zombies were typically strong enough to take down the dwarves themselves.  It's true though, that the AIs do muddy the waters considerably!"
DvZ,38arok,FallDamage312,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:58:04 2015 UTC,Yea that number would be dramatically different if Moon and/or Gwood were playing on Grape.. I also feel like it'll be a huge difference after the update with how OP wither's have become now with degrading armor
DvZ,38arok,firebolt8900,5,Wed Jun 3 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure those games are in there, but you know, there are also other games. And if you put those together, they give you an approximation of kills in general.   It's just that people dying to skeletons are really salty and spread false data about skeletons being way too powerfull."
DvZ,38arok,firebolt8900,6,Wed Jun 3 07:01:57 2015 UTC,"I did play on Grape with Moon and Angie, and I also played on Scorched with Moon and Angie, where they wrecked every retreating dwarf as fury zombies.  Individual games vary wildly, that's why it's important to get as large and representative a data set as possible. In a couple of games, skeletons did actually get more kills than zombies, and that's represented there, right in that 8%."
DvZ,38arok,Coathar44,4,Wed Jun 3 08:59:25 2015 UTC,"Unknown confirmed most dangerous monster!  EDIT: in all seriousness, this is an impressive undertaking. I would be curious to see how the numbers would break down with an equal number of spawns across all monster types."
DvZ,38arok,jujug28,3,Wed Jun 3 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"Hehe, thanks!  That does sound like an interesting question, only Rob or Nis would be able to gather that info though. You might also want to consider what upgrades have been bought for that though, which would complicate things a bit :P My money would be on golems and wolves though!"
DvZ,38arok,Tomlough,2,Wed Jun 3 09:09:17 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'd agree with that. Golems probably get at the about a kill for every time they spawn. They just spawn quite rarely.
DvZ,38arok,figsandthings,3,Wed Jun 3 10:35:30 2015 UTC,But what about Daragor kills?
DvZ,38arok,figsandthings,2,Wed Jun 3 01:26:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Daragor didn't make an appearance in those games :P  (Even if he did though, he doesn't often kill people once the plague is over)."
DvZ,38arok,figsandthings,2,Wed Jun 3 09:00:58 2015 UTC,In all of the games I played with Daragor he usually gets tired of long games/has seen enough of the test/something is broken and kills over half of the dwarves :P
DvZ,38arok,Tebotron,2,Wed Jun 3 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"Test games weren't counted for this, only regular games in the current version."
DvZ,38arok,Tebotron,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:37:24 2015 UTC,"Aye, I've certainly seen that on occasion too!"
DvZ,38arok,Alderdash,3,Wed Jun 3 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"Its good that you brought up that these 28 games aren't necessarily indicative of past games or future games, or even necessarily current games (That comes from the number of games being low, all things considered). What this really comes down to is how the typical game of DVZ plays out, and in order to get the best, most accurate interpretation of that its best to conduct this experiment as many times as possible, to get as close to the actual, expected values for each category listed. Just like five games with creeper squads aren't indicative of the typical DVZ game, many other scenarios also are not. Outliers like those don't mean a whole lot when looking at the big picture though.  With that being said, even though these pieces of data might not provide the best possible representation of the spread of kills in the typical DVZ game, its interesting nevertheless, and worth keepign in mind when considering arguments made for balancing of certain monsters, or even just as fun pieces of trivia!  It would definitely be interesting to see someone (Maybe a large group of people?) get together and do something like this over a longer time period, say from one major update to the next (Including things like big armor changes, etc as ""major updates""), even if it was only one or two games a day. That way it would be easy to compare the games at various points in its life, and also be really interesting to look at!  Edit: I also want to mention, I really like how things came out being so close to a third each between Unknown/AI, Zombie, and everything else. Makes me wonder if, as more trials are conducted, it would get closer and closer to being a third each. Not that that necessarily holds any particular significance. Just a funny coincidence and a graph that's nice to look at."
DvZ,38arok,Cronurd,5,Wed Jun 3 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I wanted to get as much data as possible, but I also wanted a good spread across as many maps as possible, so I did decide, for instance, that I didn't want twice as many West Delphia games as anything else, so ended up stopping taking data for that one XD The map breakdown ended up as:   Asylum: 3 Scorched Canyon: 3 Rift: 3 Soph: 3 Grape: 3 Tree: 3 West Delphia: 3 Frost: 2 Throntodur: 1 Friendship Town: 1 Space: 1 H'Cet: 1 Raenil: 1   I wanted to make sure that each of the most recent main rotation maps was equally represented, and that none of the 'rare' maps occurred more than them. Other than that, I took what I could :P  I also had to abandon some data from videos when I realised that the people recording stopped (for various reasons) once they died as a dwarf. I learnt to check the end of the videos after that!  Whilst 28 isn't that many, it's also enough that it got to the stage where I wasn't seeing any major changes in the chart as I added games, even those which have a quite radically different distribution of kills (the last game I added was one on Rift, where there were significantly more kills made by creepers than zombies).  Getting other people involved in this helped me a great deal, I couldn't have got as much data without my mumble friends. I'd say the only thing to be really crystal clear about before doing a group experiment is making sure everyone understands and follows the same methods.  As for patterns, the one that really caught my eye was that zombies kill twice as many as creepers kill twice as many as skeletons :P"
DvZ,38arok,Cronurd,2,Wed Jun 3 09:32:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its probably better that the main rotation maps were used more often, though I think that in the long run (Not necessarily for your experiment though) it could skew the data a bit because of bias towards specific maps. As we all know, some people like to play differently between maps! Regardless though, for a small experiment like this its probably bets that the most played maps are also the most represented.  And yeah, it doesn't necessarily take too many trials to see things balance out a bit. Every trial gets you closer and closer to the expected values! I definitely believe you about the 28 games. It might not be a lot of games in terms of the amount of DVZ games that might have went on during the time period you took the data, but its definitely enough to get a reasonable picture and make guesses as to where the data might be going.  Also; Would you happen to have the breakdown for each map specifically? If you don't already have it easily accessible, then don't worry because that would be a lot of effort to type out! It would just be really interesting to see how these stats vary from map to map as well."
DvZ,38arok,Cronurd,2,Wed Jun 3 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"I do have the kills on a game-by-game basis recorded, but decided not to do any map analysis because I don't think I have enough games on any of the maps to get a good description of them."
DvZ,38arok,Imhotep0,2,Wed Jun 3 18:28:26 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the one downside. Three games maximum for a map doesn't really show much. Especially if all three of those games had creeper sqauds. :I
DvZ,38arok,jsmeth,3,Wed Jun 3 18:57:46 2015 UTC,Love the analysis.  I'm interested in performing a similar exercise for the update to see if/how things have changed with the new changes (which they probably will).
DvZ,38arok,Awesomeshafter,3,Wed Jun 3 11:59:42 2015 UTC,"Aye, though it'll take a while before a) the changes bed in (and any subsequent post-launch tweaks needed) and b) I have the appetite to do this again :P I'm sure I will though!"

DvZ,3876fx,Rurikar,3,Tue Jun 2 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Well aren't you technically already making money with maps built by fans? I understand that the maps are of course available to those who do not buy super jimmy. But, those who supported the server might've not had bought it if there weren't as many maps as there are now."
DvZ,3876fx,skppo,3,Tue Jun 2 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well aren't you technically already making money with maps built by fans   We don't sell maps, we sell hats. Basically all I'm saying is that I would rather only comission out hats, not just take fan hats and add them to the server. We are limited by the amount we could add anyway, so its better for us to do internally."
DvZ,3876fx,Rurikar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:06:05 2015 UTC,I honestly think that that the banners are nice but why I want hats is for Heros. Because you could custom fit them for each person like Roamin (or romaine :D) I think that would be awesome
DvZ,3876fx,pjvm2000z,2,Wed Jun 3 20:42:03 2015 UTC,To clarify:  When you say selling hats for real life money. Is this with Super Jimmy? Or a totally different purchase?
DvZ,3876fx,Th3A1ph4D0g,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:47:32 2015 UTC,The current banners are given to super Jimmies.  So I'd take a guess that would be the same when they get replaced with hats.
DvZ,3876fx,Juliandroid98,5,Tue Jun 2 21:02:35 2015 UTC,Bruce would need a beard :D
DvZ,3876fx,johnb43,3,Tue Jun 2 09:55:25 2015 UTC,"Just remember the ""hats"" are really just blocks.  Every hat would have to be a block that isn't used in any of the maps.  So we can't go nuts with it."
DvZ,3876fx,Coathar44,2,Tue Jun 2 11:47:05 2015 UTC,There is at least 9 such blocks we came up with while discussing this very thing. Enough for each title and heroes.
DvZ,3876fx,FallDamage312,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:06:31 2015 UTC,Mmk I just didn't know how many there were  Could I have the list?
DvZ,3876fx,Coathar44,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:07:35 2015 UTC,I can't remember them from on top of my head. It was during a DVZ game;p I'd have to reconsult.
DvZ,3876fx,FallDamage312,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"Technically, you could use any block you wanted. The models are separated between block (placed on the ground) and item (in your hand or on your head). Every block has a block and item model, so you could make an item model for a block and having it displayed on your head, but still have the block model to be placed in the world."
DvZ,3876fx,WiiWatcher702,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:21:14 2015 UTC,So they made the hats wrong in LoM?  Or did they purposely make it like that?
DvZ,3876fx,Coathar44,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"No, they made them correctly. The ""hat"" is the item model of a block. Mojang made this system so that people can have cool looking items but not mess with the blocks people are building with."
DvZ,3876fx,WiiWatcher702,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:58:50 2015 UTC,But when you place it down it looks like the hat...
DvZ,3876fx,Coathar44,4,Tue Jun 2 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"Then they must have put a item and block model in for the block to make it look cooler when you place it down. However, this isn't necessary, you can just make an item model and still have the block usable in maps.  Edit: Proof of concept Sorry about Warlords textures."
DvZ,3876fx,WiiWatcher702,2,Tue Jun 2 17:07:30 2015 UTC,Hmm. I didn't know this. That's interesting.

DvZ,3876fx,Maquatagi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:03:44 2015 UTC,Does it actually use the item model when rendered as a hat? Now that i think about it fences render with two posts (like the item in your inventory) when used as a hat. So I guess any block other than cobble could be used. And just make the hat block unplaceable/unremoveable. Thats a lot of possibilities for hats.
DvZ,3876fx,skppo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Well, cobble and lamps (not sure what block they are). So a lot -1."

DvZ,3876fx,firebolt8900,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:13:17 2015 UTC,Actually the item you have in your inventory is not a lantern just a dye item that is used to cast a Magicspells spell that places the lamp. So cobble is the only actual block item you can have in your inventory.

DvZ,381wpf,NikoUY,5,Mon Jun 1 09:24:06 2015 UTC,Yeah right. Being tiny is worth it considering it would also hide your nameplate well. This would be a massive cost for an upgrade.

DvZ,380yr7,Coathar44,12,Mon Jun 1 01:26:17 2015 UTC,Put your in game brightness to zero and you can see light sources
DvZ,380yr7,ScottishViking,7,Mon Jun 1 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"Toggle-able night vision would definitely be useful, but I don't think its needed in the game. Fury of the Night is already very powerful and many monsters seem to have little to no trouble finding sufficiently dark spots anyway. Some dwarves also like to hide light specifically so monsters can't get to them easily. Light is very important to dwarves as I'm sure we're all aware. If a mob sees a torch, they're more than welcome to break it and if they can't they should just keep moving or look harder. Dying while looking for it doesn't really mean a whole lot either considering monsters get as many respawns as they'd like. Just because some dwarves like to be sneaky with their torch placement, doesn't mean that monsters should just be handed the ability to bypass that completely.  However, since no one else mentioned it at the time of me typing this, I'll mention it. The ability to see light levels already exists in the game. Bringing up your debug screen (by hitting f3) allows you to see the light level of wherever you're standing."
DvZ,380yr7,figsandthings,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:20:58 2015 UTC,That was my only worry as it would help mobs a lot.  Though f3 does work its still time consuming and in procs halls easy to get killed.
DvZ,380yr7,figsandthings,3,Mon Jun 1 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"I can definitely understand. Using f3 to find hidden light sources is definitely something that would be time consuming and require a bit of trial and error. My best advice would be too look for holes in the proc tunnels along the ground, because those usually house torches in some way, though people like to make them difficult to get to without digging (Though keep in mind, some people like to do it differently). Just remember that the light has to come from somewhere, and if there's no visible light sources in the hall, its coming from the entrance to hall, the exit to the hall, or from within the walls of the hall itself!  I'm sorry if you already knew that, but I hope it helps!"
DvZ,380yr7,MillicentOak,2,Mon Jun 1 04:42:08 2015 UTC,"Back when only some special monsters had night vision, this was definitely helpful if you became, e.g., a digging zombie. However, since it was fixed I've gotten used to having night vision at all times: I'd recommend looking for patches of warmer colours as artificial lights have a different colour to light from the sky.  Personally I find it quite fun trying to figure out where the torches are, though if this was changed I wouldn't be too disappointed."
DvZ,380yr7,TheDrCreeps,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"When the nightvison was added, it is the player's own responsibility, it made is harder, but many have no problem, and It was a balance in it's own. everyone will be trying to break the torch, as it is mana, with it not as visible, it balances out."
DvZ,380yr7,mineman00567,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea and in my opinion, it would be a good addition to DvZ. However, milk and command blocks are definately not options. I think the simplest way to accomplish this would be to give mobs a night vision toggle in their inventory. When mobs spawn, they would be given the default night vision, however if they right clicked the item, they could turn night vision off and on. I have seen this method used on other servers and it was quite efficient. I know hardly anything about the magic spells plugin, but I'm sure you could make a spell that does what I just explained."
DvZ,380yr7,Morvereth,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:57:24 2015 UTC,I like the idea. Diggin zombies used to be pretty OP at killing torches because of the bug that they didint have nightvision.

DvZ,380yr7,zekzava,2,Mon Jun 1 01:46:53 2015 UTC,Urrrrh not really at all...   They could easily have an item that gives them night vision for 1 sec constantly... so they would never run out when holding it  What I would say (as a simple way for the devs to implement this w/o much work) is to give all mobs the night vision potion effect from there primary wep... then have a dup of there primary wep in there inventory next to seppeku w/o the night vision... so if they preferred no night vision you could swap the two copys out

DvZ,37z7vd,keaganwill,2,Sun May 31 17:43:45 2015 UTC,It wont be for a while... since Rob has just started doing his UR Live streams. (It started yesterday and I believe it went for over 7 hours)  Rob releases the stream as videos for his channel btw
DvZ,37z7vd,ModangerBoy_,2,Sun May 31 18:46:09 2015 UTC,I just wanted rob to do more vids at the very least and I am very glad to have a community there to answer this thanks guys!!! :D

The explosion would be massive doing extensive block damage (like just removing a forward wall) and have excessive Knockback (and potentially damage too). The Goblin King is slow but immortal, it only dies to its own explosion and so the Dwarves have to hold it back until its fuse goes and the mobs have to essentially meat shield it to ensure it reaches something useful to explode on.      A Witch or something similar that provides buffs to monsters in a radius (like the blaze cannon with absorption hearts). It's a weak mob that's easy to kill/procable but makes the mobs around it much stronger."

Fires arrows that do normal (fully upgraded) damage, but inflicts blindness (including the accompanying slow effect) for three seconds that overrides light from all sources (even daylight).  If skeleton arrows are going to follow what the dwarf test arrows were, doubles arrow generation for nearby skeletons.  Additionally, the Skeleton King gives five absorption hearts to other skeletons that is refreshed every 15 seconds (to prevent them from being one-shot by bows).  The idea behind the Skeleton King is to protect other nearby skeletons by both blinding dwarves and giving them an extra measure of protection to prevent them from being one-shot.  A Skeleton King in a nest of skeletons should be something to be feared, and it may force dwarf players to consider building defenses to the roof.

There was a spec in /loadout called ""massive quiver"" or something of that nature that doubled the limit of arrows for the dwarf.

The current spells are ok, but only really useful in specific circumstances, the tinder flame hasn't changed and is still powerful for some like yourself in the video but it never really works for me (I always miss), and the boots take time and skill to master and even then their positives are limited.  I've always felt nis was the weakest which felt more like a novelty rather than a strong hero so this new update seems to further enhance that idea.

All his spells are great at dealing with large groups of zombies, so it's good to use spells to save the endangered Jimmy surrounded by 20 monsters.  The ability to pick spells actually massively buffs him as a fighter/front lines hero, since we can select the Tinderflame spell and get easy procs everytime, not just through 40% of spells :P"

Your odds of dieing don't increase with every shot, it stays the same for every shot.  So you always have a 10% chance to die but you also always have a 90% chance to not die, which means the odds are massively in your favor.  Past results don't affect the present RNG results, which also makes it possible to roll back to back super shots if you are lucky enough.  With 9:1 odds every shot it is very possible to fire more than 9 shots before dieing.  However due to RNG you don't need 10 shots to be killed, you only need 1 (and tremendous bad luck).

I see your point about benefits of such a buff being over-powered and it certainly isn't my intention with the concept. If the speed buff was no more than what is gained from the proc it wouldn't mean longer/bigger procs as you wouldn't be going any faster than normal when procing. And in terms of the damage debuff its meant to be weak enough that you have to evade certain monsters as you'd just loose in a 1v1, you'd need to use the agility to target weaker monsters. It's more intended for agility than superiority. As a part of the loadout it being based on ""weight"" would mean you could heavily restrict what you can and cannot have in tandem with it, it could potentially cost an inventory row of space as well to balance the ""weight"".

It'd have a special ability where every 1:30 mins you charge with  your lance and you'll get speed 4 or higher/lower and you'll gain a powerful rampage for the next 20secs and a row of momentum hearts.

Long tunnels that had a 1 high opening to shoot through. We think with AI zombies and the fact that a lot of players won't be specced to use their bow a whole lot, we can make it so players don't ever want to build like this indoors in the future, but if it becomes a trend again in games, it will mean we have to do big changes to archery to prevent it."

DvZ,37qqi1,Rurikar,5,Fri May 29 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"The thing is with archers is they just can't deal with AI zombies using most bows and because of this fact, I think it's okay for bows to one shot most monsters indoors now.

DvZ,37qqi1,skppo,4,Fri May 29 23:38:56 2015 UTC,Traditional proc halls are kind of useless in the current game already. I usually focus on making the final shrine room smaller (more confined) and making sure that halls are easy to run around in and are built up to the ceiling to avoid monsters going over them. As you are pretty much invincible with momentum the best halls maximise mobility and visibility. Multiple people can't really roll procs in one wide hallways.
DvZ,37qqi1,Th3A1ph4D0g,3,Fri May 29 18:46:13 2015 UTC,2 wide is the way to go
DvZ,37qqi1,5ilver42,3,Fri May 29 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"What we need to focus on are 'proc chambers' and dependable points that can be held. We need a choke point for the entrance, but right after that we need a moderately small space where dwarves can group and pummel the zombies that come through, while also being able to push forward through the hole and drive the monsters back.  Having support from a higher ledge from archers would be a bonus, but we can't have a large opening that wolves and zombies to leap through."

DvZ,37qqi1,Morvereth,1 point,Fri May 29 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"I think that 1 wide proc tunnels have never been most effective form of defending hallways. They are just most popular because inexperienced players dont have to move mouse while rolling proc. So every dwarf is useful in them. Most experienced proc rollers have always tend to roll they procs on open sections of hallway.   In one wide tunnel its pretty easy to just ran past everything into shrine as mob. And as for creeper damage in 1 wide tunnel most dwarves stands on same spot, so one blast can easily hit several dwarfs. Also its much easier to find and proc skeleton, spiderling etc. on open hallway.  Having choke points (proc chambers) with short sections of 1 wide tunnels could be far better design. Now with indoor rangers choke points could have 3 or 4 high walls where archers can stand on top of. Unless map does not have low tunnels that dont allow it.  People should try new different builds. Problem is that community is so used to 1 wide tunnels that when someone tries to build something new to experiment on, people will either whine or start spamming more blocks to make it 1 wide tunnel :) I think that every design that is not 1 wide zig zag maze is worth testing :)"

They'll absolutely still have their uses as a bottleneck, I don't think anyone can really argue with that, because getting monsters in a small confined area is almost always a good thing. Otherwise though, we'll really just have to see how people adapt to the new system and how proc halls work with the way they adapt. I can definitely see some new designs being used that are tailored toward certain classes (But hopefully not just one!), but there's not guarantee that the standard design will fall out of use.

When you make abilities you balance the numbers last and I was just designing a whole bunch of different ideas for Sword/Bows and such. Some of them will just get stripped out.  Originally I had a week earlier this month that was for DvZ time, but I had to move my schedule and that time is next week. This is why Nisovin took the initiative in getting some abilities going. There are tons of things I'm going to change for balance reasons and for ""because this feels better"" reasons. There are some abilities that are going to still get removed and some that will get added. Even the text needs another pass over as abilities aren't just clear yet.

DvZ,37jmut,MillicentOak,3,Thu Jun 11 21:49:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's delve into this review shall we?     Exterior & First Shrine  First thing I noticed was your very good use of WorldPainter. Mountains look pretty great, but I'm not sure if you used a heightmap / custom brushes or did it with the default. The custom trees help with the jungle theme a lot and certainly make it difficult to ignore the map and sneak around. The only thing that bugs me (extreme nitpicking, beware) is this. The outside area has very smooth edges, yet is not flat (reminds me of Throntodur). This staircase seems rather small for the keep, but since monsters can easily go around it's not big issue.     Entrance to Second Shrine  The initial entrance into the keep is a good size, and the fall behind it will discourage killfarming. The cavern is very cool, and I love the way you've spread armour stands down there. The flowing lava may need to be worldguarded to prevent griefing however. The two side routes take almost twice the time as the bridge does (which is suitable for a secondary and tertiary route). A problem I have is the bridge itself. Although I don't know how creeper mechanics will be in june, I'm sure this bridge will either be abandoned or turned into proc hallway hell. It seems more efficient to just stay back at 2nd shrine once the entrance has fallen rather than protect the bridge and worry about flanks from the two other routes. But this is all speculation, and a test game is necessary to truly see the outcome. The second shrine itself is a decent size, but I fear it will be spammed with unnecessary slabs by Jimmies.     Second Shrine to Final Shrine  The two staircases are good since they have a downward slant, and should be pretty effective at preventing spawn camping. The first time I looked through the map I went down this spiral staircase thinking it was the way to final, it seems reminiscent of Nolrim spiral staircases (except with less bedrock holes). I noticed the quarry under second shrine serves as a second route that takes a rather long time for monsters. I don't think this will get much use from anyone other than infiltrator skeletons, since it leads into the same room as the primary route does. The next two sets of downward stairs lead to a similar room as the first. It seems much of the fighting will go on in these rooms as monsters jump down the staircases to their doom. A small concern I have with these rooms is that there is a lot of light that is very spread out. This would be very hard to remove without creepers. The final shrine after looks beautiful and has a cathedral-esque style much like the rest of the map. I like the idea of the final shrine being on a small balcony, and it would be interesting to play out. However, I feel having two of those very large supply rooms on either side is unnecessary and one would be more than sufficient. The small pixel art fire behind the shrine seems like it would be a good place for dwarves to repair or monsters to hide.     Overall  Overall, this map looks absolutely great, and other than the minor concerns I listed I feel it will play out pretty well as is. I really wanted to make this post because I see a good future in this map and want to see it succeed.     EDIT: Fixed formatting and replaced broken link"
DvZ,37jmut,MastermegaGamer,2,Fri May 29 01:53:30 2015 UTC,"It seems more efficient to just stay back at 2nd shrine once the entrance has fallen rather than protect the bridge   MMG, may I have the pleasure of introducing you to Jimmy? Jimmy loves the totally unnecessary and avoidable danger of standing on a bridge, and will stop at nothing to build a cosy new home on it :P  Edit: What I'm saying is that this is exactly my opinion about, e.g., the first bridge on Raenil, that it would be far more efficient to stay on the keep side and kill the monsters as they cross it. But everyone just goes for it :P"
DvZ,37jmut,keaganwill,1 point,Fri May 29 11:26:42 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, that wall of text scared me a little xD  The tools at final were mostly placed for decoration, having them removed wont be an issue though. I tried making the secondary paths longer on purpose to leave the choice of ""either this proc tunnel of instant death, or a little extra running time"". I believe dwarves will be able to hold the shrines for a decent amount of time, and personally I love the idea of being able to sneak around.   I also justified the lights (to myself) that creepers/ the new goblins will be able to take them out easily. I'd love to try being an infiltrator skeleton as well because just because of this. I like the idea of sneaking past dwarves and mess with the ones behind the front lines! >:3  If the tiny ara staircase turns out to be an issue, it wont be hard to fix either. I doubt there will be a lot of Dwarves sitting there, but as I mentioned in the screenshots, I do expect bowspam to happen in some places.  Thank you so much for your feedback! :)"

DvZ,37jprx,Adnerp,6,Fri May 29 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"I like to look at it more in teams/pairs of dwarves, and what combinations of loadouts can be effective.   One that came up yesterday was an Evenom/Beserker combo. Both will fight at forward positions, and try to keep defenses (proc halls/slabs) up for as long as possible. The job of the evonom wielder is purely to hit all the creepers. This stops them exploding and prevents them destroying the defenses, and knocking the beserker around.  Beserker uses his beserk to take out the congregated hoard, and hopefully reduce the cooldown to less than 30 seconds each time to keep it rolling pretty regularly. Both have holy ale to help the other person keep a few extra hearts, and reduce the need to heal a bit. Both have durability to last longer without retreating.   One has slabs, another has super mortar, which allows them to keep forward defences strong for as long as possible. Top this off with scav for both.  I am aware that goblins may not have the same mechanics as creepers do now, which renders this team useless, but it's just an example to show how loadout team combinations could prove very effective."

DvZ,37jprx,keaganwill,2,Thu May 28 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"Gold panner is no longer an upgrade either. Shrines now start with 500 gold, no one has life savings, and everyone has gold panner (Which I measured at 25%, although it was a very low sample size so might be a bit different)  Starting torches are also (imo) a waste, because now you cut 2 logs per right click on a tree, each log becomes 2 planks, each plank becomes 4 sticks. Each stick only becomes 1 torch, but they change at the rate of cutting logs, not old torch making rate. 1 stack of logs got me 8 stacks of torches :P  Safefall is also, again imo, not worth because you already take greatly reduced fall damage, and with perhaps the exception of rift there's nowhere it would save you that you otherwise wouldn't live."

Virendra's Hymn is there to allow me to obtain easy procs, I may swap this out if I decide that it's not worth it or if one of the other ""ranger"" specs gets an upgrade.  Durability is there to keep me in the action it also helps to save gold because I'm repairing less.

If those last two specs are to change or if I was misinformed I will most likely run Wrenches and Scavenger(Depends on what level this ends up being if it keeps wrenches thats great but if it doesnt I'd at least like a ""scavenger 7"" variation of the spec) or Wrenches and Gold Panner(Once again depends on the level of this I'd like a decent level of it)"

Wrenches are honestly useful for pretty much anyone, especially late game, so that's a must. Autoheal might be good for them, because if they can clear a lot of monsters they wont have to worry as much about the cooldown or the double mana usage, assuming they're not on the front lines with Rampagers or Evenomers. Momentum can also give them extra bulk. That leaves 16 extra points that a person can put towards stuff that might be useful in specific situations (In other words I'm not sure what else might work well for a defensive Warhammer/Berserker). This is just a thought mostly though. Its hard to tell what will or will not be effective unti you actually see it in use."

DvZ,37jprx,Cat656,1 point,Thu May 28 07:40:18 2015 UTC,"The combo I use is: War hammer, Vyendra's Hymn, Durability, Scavenger, and Momentum. Due to the hammers bonus damage and AoE damage, it makes short work of AIs in a large area, which also works very well with scavenger. Momentum is there as a cheaper but less powerful for of the auto-heal, as the user will most likely be getting kills for the entirety of the cooldown. Vyendra's Hymn makes the user has some sort of access to a proc-on-demand, and any sort of proc with the war hammer is absurdly powerful. Inside they will have to rely on the Horn for a proc, but because of the Horn's reduced cooldown when there are less dwarves, it should be not that much of a problem."

The flowers/foliage around final which is in Shrine protection is also annoying as when you fight around the shrine you end up cutting more grass than mobs and as the plants do not break the problem doesn't go away. Other than that it played quite well and I certainly enjoyed it."

DvZ,37jm4e,Alderdash,2,Thu May 28 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"I'd second DoomBringer's points about the ice and the flowers in final.  Specifically it's the speckled pattern of the ice - larger patches, like Frost Hold, can be sprinted over, but in this case you end up with a stop/start motion as you move off and on the ice blocks.  The first shrine ended up quite hard to defend since creepers took out the stone brick parts of the floor, but left the ice and snow. I was trying to run a proc and just got glitched into a block.  Final shrine had some lighting issues - I was standing on a block bang up against the shrine and still had blindness. I think Nisovin might've lowered the shrine beams at some point after it was mentioned, which then lit up the single floor-level block around the shrine, that helped a lot.   The bottleneck with Roamin's oil is pretty annoying for the monsters, very difficult to clear it when Roamin can almost sit on the oil and flame that tight turn, but Doom was Roamin during that test game, so he was probably enjoying it. :P"

DvZ,37jm4e,Endergrill,2,Fri May 29 01:12:51 2015 UTC,"The only time I've looked around the map is in 2 test games where I joined as a monster, so I can't give very extensive feedback.  Aesthetically speaking I'm not a fan of the packed ice everywhere (I know a lot of people complained about it being annoying to fight on, but I didn't do a lot of fighting on it). It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to look at, particularly in the trees, and especially when there's a river of packed ice running through the map anyway.  My biggest problem with the map is how flat it is. The valley is set in a steep mountain range yet somehow is completely flat - no variation in terrain whatsoever except for a few mounds of snow. Combined with the noisy look of random block types, the map just feels like a first draft of something that could be a lot better.  Other than that, I don't have any major comments about the map. (These kinds of comments always end up seeming more negative than they should, but that's not to say it's a bad map by any means.)"

So basically you get a refund, but then have to start from scratch? Interesting.  I do hope the points are tweaked ever so slightly - I know they don't want long-term players to become ridiculously overpowered, but as a not-really-strong player, I found that when I tried the customise system in the lobby, I had nothing left over for gold upgrades after I'd put in my ""live in the 2nd half of the game"" upgrades. My building upgrades got sacrificed too because they can theoretically be crafted, mostly..."
DvZ,37ecqx,Alderdash,2,Wed May 27 09:30:53 2015 UTC,"I found that when I tried the customise system in the lobby, I had nothing left over for gold upgrades after I'd put in my ""live in the 2nd half of the game"" upgrades. My building upgrades got sacrificed too because they can theoretically be crafted, mostly...   I felt exactly the same, I know is not finished yet but if you want to have a little bit of everything but not too much of something you can't, it's kinda hard to get what you want to just play and useful combinations of more basic things. For example if you want Slabs you are probably going to want Super Mortar, but that means you need to sacrifice something like Gold Panner or Scavanger, if you want Scavanger you kinda want to get Torches so you don't have to make them and have more time to build stuff but you can't really do that, if you want to build stuff you are going to want Gold Panner so you get gold for all the Cobble you are going to need, Slabs with Super Mortar and probably Torches and Mortar if you want to have extra time to build (if you play alone), that basically leaves you with nothing after you got Proc and something else, etc etc.  Maybe it would be a good idea to have tiers of items, something like 2 point for 1 slab, 4 points for 4 slabs, 6 points for 7 slabs and 8 points for 10 slabs. I would gladly take 10 Super mortar and 4 Slabs for the price of 10 slabs which I probably never going to use them all."
DvZ,37ecqx,NaquIma,1 point,Wed May 27 20:13:18 2015 UTC,"Aye, I actually thought about something similar  - I'd sacrifice half my enchanted lamps for half my blue glue, for instance.  I did wonder if it'd just make it to complex and foutery though."

I usually spawn with a stack of gold, and get another stack minimum from gravel, but when experimenting with the new loadout I ended up having to choose between stuff that helps me survive and gold/building supplies.  It's easy for ex-leaderboard types to look at the new setup and say ""What's the problem? All I need is proc, a torch and MY OWN INDOMITABLE SPIRIT...!"" but for those of us who are not in that league it comes close to choosing between having personal fun, or helping the team.  However, as always, these are tests, things with change, they're looking at the systems not the balance yet etc etc. :D"
DvZ,37f0np,Alderdash,5,Wed May 27 09:49:22 2015 UTC,"It's really not that bad  I run proc, bow proc, compass, wrench, lamp, scav, gold panner, torches, and gold  I have all the necessities with the fun of bow proc as well... there's lots of wiggle room  I will say I don't like the proc cost... imo proc should be forced down jimmies throat then when he throws it up make icecream out of it and give it to him again so he eats and likes it! Or else!"
DvZ,37f0np,keaganwill,3,Wed May 27 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"That's true, it should be default, unless you want to swap it out for something like berserk or other stuff."

DvZ,37f0np,Adnerp,1 point,Wed May 27 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"My average is about 275 gold per build phase, including time to collect weapons, tools, and getting armored.  Ten people could pull that off.  The issue now would be if I don't start with 64 torches I would need to make some.  That would reduce mining time.  Other stuff?  Barely ever use, even cobble."
DvZ,37f0np,Adnerp,1 point,Wed May 27 03:57:17 2015 UTC,And does that include any goldpanner from gravel? (I get all gold from goldpanner so I can then also have gravel and with max goldpanner it is about as fast as just mining gold)
DvZ,37f0np,Imhotep0,1 point,Wed May 27 04:32:38 2015 UTC,"Nah, just plain ole gold mining.  Digging gravel filled my inventory too quick and I usually just threw it out."

DvZ,37f0np,Th3A1ph4D0g,1 point,Thu May 28 12:24:26 2015 UTC,"I can agree with this however I came up with a pretty good spec after thinking it over with a group of friends: Proc, Virendra's Hymn, Durability, Wrenches, Gold.  This Spec allows me to spawn with gold and be able to save gold as well because I'll be repairing far less due to added durability and the lower cost of wrenches. Not to mention that I can still mine gold during the build phase. Something I would like to point out is that the gold panner currently in /loadout seems to be an extremely weak variation somewhere around GP 3 or 4 which really isn't worth it. Also during the tests people were running scavenger, it just wasn't working."
DvZ,37et2y,keaganwill,2,Wed May 27 02:38:04 2015 UTC,The /loadout command will most likely stay for now. Niso has been using it a lot for testing.

I'm not easy to annoy since I tend to take rude/ inappropriate things as jokes but that still isn't acceptable to me.   I'd also appreciate if people wouldn't make posts about it on reddit when they already know it was me who gave them it. A simple thank you ingame is more than enough!

I went with the Ranger class, meaning I had to no ability to proc but I had more arrows than others (btw - another test item, you do not craft arrows, you have a set amount and they slowly regen). In my last game, when I started getting used to it, I began taking on a new style, really upping my sniper skills and learning how to fight with my bow more. Looking for green sparkles to save my butt in hordes became a life saver! Also, learning how to fight in the final shrine was interesting.. hoisted myself up to aim for the door to avoid the floor combat (another Ranger perk, the bows were full power inside). I really like this new system. Going to take a lot to learn!! But I can't wait to keep practicing and finding out more :)"
DvZ,379jwi,NaquIma,1 point,Tue May 26 11:22:57 2015 UTC,The whole class system is customizable? Very nice! So Im assuming Paladin and Ranger is there... what about other classes? Gravedigger? Mason? Ancient?

However, the next game had a ""load out"" menu where you can select a pre-made class or customize it with ""64 credits."" Endy did a great job of looking at all the different items that you could pick for your character. And as you can see in the last bit of her text, she put a screenshot of Nis saying the tests were just for the class system, not the classes themselves so who knows what the final product will be! Can't wait :D"

(Edit: Seen some of the other upgrades, some of the replacements for proc are pretty cool!)  Neither do I like the idea of picking once and it being locked in. I've seen the picture of the shield giving regen/damage reduction and replacing your potion. It'd be cool to play with, but I definitely wouldn't want to have to commit to it, especially without being able to play games with it first. Would be very sad if you can only pick/build a class once and then have to always use that particular one, though I will remember it was a test game - so I remain hopeful that it won't be the case :P"

DvZ,37a08j,Awesomeshafter,7,Tue May 26 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"As previously explained to you, the test games are not the finished product. Each test game is generally only testing one feature/mechanic, and you'd be a fool to judge the whole update based on the test games so far. The test games are part of the development process... dismissing the update based on the test games is like going to a restaurant, demanding to taste each of the ingredients before they're cooked, and claiming your meal will be terrible because the chicken's undercooked.  Honestly I'd suggest just not joining the test games, especially if they're going to make you unfairly prejudiced against the finished summer update. Like I said before, every test game I've been in I've seen you complain about it as if it's the end of DvZ - you are going into them with the wrong mindset. You just need to do as you're told and play the game as best you can with the features offered to you.  Again: all the test games right now are testing individual features, not balance. It's highly unlikely there'll be a finished, release candidate style balance test until a couple of days before the update, if at all.  I mean this comment in a helpful way - I seriously think if people are going to decree the summer update as bad based on test games alone, that's a big problem for both you and the game. If you enjoy DvZ now in its larval form, give it a fair chance to impress you when it grows its wings."

DvZ,37324g,Imhotep0,4,Sun May 24 17:30:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hope they leave all current maps in, since at the moment it appears that all maps have similar chance to appear.  If Rob is trying to move it to a point where it can have sustainability without the need for constant updates, more maps in rotation can only be a good thing.

DvZ,37324g,Alderdash,3,Mon May 25 09:42:03 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd like a Primary rotation of a similar size to the current setup (I guess anything between 5 and 7 would be fine) with a higher percentage chance - perhaps 50% - which would ""showcase"" new maps. It'd help satisfy the folk who get bored easily and like shiny new things. (To be fair, most of us like shiny new things... :P)  Then with that, a secondary rotation of all older maps (that are still suitable) taking up the other 50%. This group will just keep expanding as time goes by, giving new players the ""Woah, is this a new map?!"" feeling when they've never seen one before, and old players the ""Ooh, nice, haven't played this in a while.""  I guess going into Summer that'd mean - Primary rotation, each map has a 10% chance of coming up, Secondary rotation, each map has a 2.5% chance, which will lower over time. (Feels a little low for the Primary, but I stuck with easy numbers because ew, maths.)  ...this may be too complicated/fancy, though."
DvZ,37324g,Imhotep0,1 point,Sun May 24 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"Really? A fresh start would be so much nicer, as long as they keep updating the maps after the initial launch I'm fine with not having any maps persist. As it currently stands I actively avoid all secondary rotation maps, which means I basically have just stopped playing until the update. Having every map that's been in rotation since PMC in a side rotation or even the main rotation come June 5th would just be bad."
DvZ,37324g,figsandthings,2,Mon May 25 09:50:46 2015 UTC,"Why avoid them? How is having 5 maps, maybe 2 of which people dislike, better than having 20 maps?"
DvZ,37324g,Juliandroid98,1 point,Sun May 24 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"Having played them for however long they were in rotation I grew tired of them. In a side rotation on the off-chance they come up I would play them because I'd know they may not come up again for a long time. But when you can guarantee they'll be a couple of games of it in a day then why play a map I don't want to play? Comparatively its like instead of having 5 maps in rotation, 2 of which I dislike, its like having 20 maps in rotation, 15 of which I dislike. I'm all for having lots of maps. Just lots of new maps."
DvZ,37324g,PrivateChicken,7,Sun May 24 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"More maps means more variety though. A map that a person dislikes is considerably less likely to show up (Assuming an equal chance for every map to appear). If that's the case we wouldn't have to worry about a case like Frost where the map has been in rotation for so long with so few other options that everyone's tired of it.  And there's always going to be maps that individuals don't enjoy playing, but once server activity picks up, its likely that we'll have a few games going on at once for a significant portion of the time the server is up, meaning that if you see a map you don't like, don't play it and wait for the next map (Something people already do, but more games equals less waiting)."
DvZ,37324g,Tomlough,2,Sun May 24 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"But recycling old maps is a cheap way to gain variety. There have been so many map submissions and there will likely be several more before June 5th even. With the increased popularity there will more than likely be a number of new players trying their hand at map making too, they shouldn't need to use old maps to fill spaces."

DvZ,371pon,MillicentOak,3,Sun May 24 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"Just a quick point about the water treatment lore, coming from a brewer: personally when brewing ale I want to treat my water as little as possible since it gives a lot of flavour (hence Burton, Dublin, London, Pilsen, Munich etc. having distinct regional specialities). Brewing with untreated spring water is the best way to create a good brew, and I'd assume that that's what would come most naturally to the dwarves, and be well within their capabilities. Water is the main ingredient in beer, after all :P  Also, say water treatment to a Brit and they'll think of sewage. Yummy.  Edit: spelling, parsability."
DvZ,371pon,MillicentOak,2,Sun May 24 10:30:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I didn't really know much about the brewing process, but this is a good lesson. I guess it should be fine unless the dwarves have good taste in beer."

Only issue I noticed having droppable holyblade on gym and pmc was that every other game some random jimmy asked ""Morvereth can i have your holyblade?"" I was sometimes nice and dropped it, but sometimes begging irritated me.   Dropping hero items are whole different story, since they effect gameplay. And some players have been previously toxic and demanded hero to drop ale, armor, etc.. to them because they thinked that hero was noob, and should not be ""wasting"" hero items."
DvZ,372c29,Morvereth,1 point,Sun May 24 08:21:07 2015 UTC,Dont think you can drop holy blade anymore (or so im told..) but if a jimmy is annoying you by begging just /ignore them

With that being said, personally I have no problems if people do and think that all title items should be droppbale again. I get that its a donator only item and breaks roleplay, but I know I've never used my tomb maker, even when we still had the leaderboards. Instead I would drop it at the beginning of the game and hope a new player picked it up so they'd get a chance to use it. I suppose now that leaderboards are gone and anyone can get title items if they have the money, there's not really as much of an effect with that sorta thing though."

DvZ,3717hx,Awesomeshafter,13,Sat May 23 22:26:47 2015 UTC,"There already are classes for people who die or join late. It's called zombie, skeleton and creeper. Making a spectator class would just pull attention from monster classes and make the mobs lose ranks. This isn't good because the mobs will make no progress and the game will just drag on. There will probably also be stupid ""jokes"" of persuading all the mobs to turn spectator, making the game even worse. If spectator class is forced upon joining a game then people who want to be mob won't be able to, which isnt good. There really isn't any point for a spectator class and besides. DvZ is a roleplaying game, a spectator class kinda breaks that wall."

DvZ,3717hx,Morvereth,2,Sat May 23 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"Now that you mentioned this I have this idea I have been working on from time to time and I'm trying to have it ready when the update comes out that will allow you to do something like that. Basically the idea is to capture the packets between the client and server (changing some packets on the client side to make them seem like they came from the server) and dump them into a file, just like a demo in games like Unreal or Quake (more or less), then have a server where you can join as spectator that will push those packets to the client so you can ""be"" in that game.  The idea is for you to being able to fly around in spectator mode, spectate people, maybe use it to make some cool videos, test cool features and stuff like that. I really don't expect people to use it that much but is one of the cool projects I have been working on around DvZ just for the fun of it.  Is going to have some obvious limitations like chunks only loading around my player, skin problems if the demo is too old (I have some ideas around that) and is probably not going to have anything interesting other than flying in spectator mode at first but I plan to add things to it over time .  Right now I have most of the heavy work done and I am refactoring my current code to been able to separate it in submodules and use it in different things like the server side of this and also use it in other project I have in mind and not having to maintain the same code everywhere.  TL;DR: I am doing something that will allow you to do that, it will probably be ready when the update comes out."
DvZ,3717hx,NikoUY,1 point,Sun May 24 00:26:48 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could just use something like tcpdump, windump or wireshark to capture data between server and client and dump it to file. And then just have modified server that reads data and another client to access that local server. then you would not technically be using hacked client.   But this still sounds hacking, and you should ask permission before using this to make replays etc..."
DvZ,3717hx,TheTJB14,1 point,Sun May 24 08:57:24 2015 UTC,"I'm doing something like that, I'm not touching the client at all.... I'm not using tcpdump or anything like that because I need to be able to decrypt the packets so is a little more complicated than just capture the data directly.  Edit:  I'm doing this because I like the game and I have fun doing cool stuff like this, nothing strange here.  If someone ask me to not make it public I won't but to be honest I don't think is a such a big deal, I wouldn't be talking about it otherwise, I'm just trying to make some cool stuff around the game for the community to use because I have pasion for the game, that is all."

It's a big process and it's not like were setup in anyway to constantly roll out new servers. Not mention, that it has to also be connected to the database server as well which could create load on both servers, this thing isn't simple guy.

DvZ,36zjrh,Juliandroid98,3,Sat May 23 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Last June, there were a couple of things that needed adjusting, that only came to light once the update was rolled out, and there were big enough changes that it was decided to reset the leaderboards after just a week or so."
DvZ,36zjrh,Rurikar,2,Sat May 23 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the idea, it's just not feasible.  Rob said himself that he isn't making any money off from DvZ, so a second server would just be more costs."
DvZ,36zjrh,Rurikar,16,Sat May 23 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"Man I wrote a big long post but my browser crashed.  Anyway, this isn't entirely true. I make money off all the projects I do online, when you hear me say something like ""I don't make money off X"" what I really mean is I don't make enough for it to be worth my time and the reason I do it is because I love working on the project. I know that by being dedicated to fans, they will in turn be dedicated to me in future projects. I don't feel like DvZ is in a ""great"" place in the sense that I can slowly start retiring the project and so I want to get it there first. This is also the reason why I don't want to do Youtube videos on it, DvZ is winding down with Minecraft content in general. I don't yell this from the rooftops though because some of the community would cry bloody mary. I'm just going to slowly have it fade away in terms of importance to my general fanbase (who for the most part already have), but at the same time I'm committed to getting it to a good resting place for those who love it.  I'll make money off DvZ this summer, but it would have been FAR better to put that time into making Lords/Youtube content. One of the reasons I don't like having blogs or doing constant update videos is because it's so easy to say something like this because to me personally, I don't feel that DvZ is worth investing my time in to see a return. I keep working on it because I love DvZ, not because it's going to support me. I really don't want to be judged on what I say, but what I do. It's so easy to talk to talk and anytime I do ANY video where I just talk about things I'm going to do, it feels so self serving and egotistical. I'd rather tell you guys nothing until it's time to release and I can show you what I been working on, but obviously people don't like being in the dark either. It's a super hard balance that I have not mastered yet, telling fans enough about potentially projects without so much that they get disappointed when it doesn't pan out.  For every major project I will release this summer, there was 2/3 other projects in the works that didn't see the light of day and if I made an update talking about this cool new thing I'm working on constantly and getting you guys excited, I'd just get burned when I end up doing something else. So often will I comment here in the subreddit about why we do X or why we won't do Y only to have you guys think I don't listen to fans. A few months ago there was a big thread about why Shields should come back and by then I already had a document about Shields coming back, but of course I can't share stuff because it's in development. Everything I put out this summer has been in production since JANUARY and I suspect next year there will be projects we start this fall that come out the following summer.  Anyway, I went off on a tangent, hopefully this gives you a better glimpse into my thinking."
DvZ,36zjrh,xavierisapro,0,Sat May 23 14:35:28 2015 UTC,Do you ever play under an alternate account so we don't bug you? More specifically do you like playing the game? Or just working on it?

Playtesting DvZ isn't really about checking for balancing though, and just feel of using abilities.

DvZ,36ufuk,stefanloos,4,Fri May 22 06:23:01 2015 UTC,"I also use this method of repairing, it is a lot quicker to shift click into the empty hotbar slot than to click the armor and find the slot. For the wrenches I just keep them on my hotbar."

What some people also like to do is free up a slot on their hotbar and throw away their piece of armour if repairing is needed. What happens next is that the armour piece will reappear in your hotbar slot, making this a fast way to repair too, albeit a bit dangerous. If you repair using this method you will have chance to glitch off your armour piece and thereby losing it forever. (Although this sometimes happens when using the first method too, but less likely)"

Right click back on me.  Then go to pants and repeat then hat and finally boots. I do this in a steady tempo so that I don't mess up and wind up with ale lost in my inventory or something horrible like that.   I try to never top off and waste gold but I admit I have clicked once too many before to give my armor that extra no dmg sheen. Sorry Roamin, I'll never do it again!

DvZ,36ufuk,Organizzzed,2,Fri May 22 06:08:26 2015 UTC,There are lot of helpful dwarves posting here. If your way of repairing is only okay. Maybe this can be some kind of tutorial thread for you to find something you like more? I'd love it if this post kept dwarves alive longer by finding better ways to repair. Let me know what you think?
DvZ,36ufuk,theshadowvaporeon,2,Fri May 22 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"I use hotkeys, I usually don't repair all at once unlike most people, I tend to repair the helmet and boots during procs and rarely pants if there are no creepers around, reparing during procs drains some mana because you need to heal and also can be kinda hectic to do if you don't have the muscle memory (or stop playing for a while as I dicovered recently). The chestplate and pants usually are repaired after a proc ended while I move away from the rest of the mobs, this might not happen if I have too many player mobs around me.  I usually can mantain 5 to 6 armor bars using this method and I retreat to safety if my chestplate is low but everything else is okish, even if I have 5-6 bars it's kinda risky to repair the chest while being agressive so I usually retreat at that point and repair all my armor normally, if I can't retreat then I usually use a wrench so I don't risk repairing the chestplate in a situation that is not favorable to me.  Doing it like this allows you to not retreat as often but it's a lot hectic because you need to keep track of the durability of all your armor because is a lot more inconsistent than repairing it all at once and also you have lots of micro inventory managements instead of doing it all at once.  I am looking forward to getting rid of the micro management I am doing currrently with the new system :D, even if I can't repair during procs anymore."
DvZ,36ufuk,figsandthings,4,Fri May 22 08:41:11 2015 UTC,You can still repair during PROCs. You just cannot be hit at all. You can repair on the move. Do not need to stand still. Really hard but not impossible.
DvZ,36ufuk,figsandthings,2,Fri May 22 11:26:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, can you?... I haven't played a test game with the new armor mechanics but I saw some videos where people were saying you couldn't."
DvZ,36ufuk,Axxmin,2,Fri May 22 11:43:45 2015 UTC,That is very interesting. I can see people using the proc speed boost to repair already.
DvZ,36ufuk,Morvereth,1 point,Fri May 22 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"You could also constantly switch to the pickaxe during a proc to get a free repair from time to time, repair while running away, do stuff while repairing, etc etc, basically use the pickaxe every time you get a chance and your armor is never going to break, I really doubt that system is going to stay the way it is, it seems a little too favorable for the Dwarves with basically no penalty for repairing."

I hold my cursor over whatever piece I want to repair and hit F, which I have mapped to my 3 slot, and then I just hit with it once because being three down on your armor bar means a single left click repairs it almost entirely full (Sometimes to full, depending). Usually I end up with half of one part of the armor bar missing by the end. This way is useful, at least in my opinion because once you get used to it, you can easily repair every piece of armor before a single group of momentum hearts disappears!"
DvZ,36ufuk,winter477,1 point,Fri May 22 13:57:38 2015 UTC,Nice. I tend to just let it drop to 3 armor bars and then hope it repairs smoothly.
DvZ,36ufuk,5ilver42,1 point,Fri May 22 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Its really circumstantial. I try and repair when I'm three down, but if I'm proccing and need to repair, I always wait till my proc is finished to repair, which means I occasionally repair when my armor is further down. I still do the one-click per piece though unless its clear that I can get two in without wasting gold."
DvZ,36ufuk,2opJimmy,2,Fri May 22 17:55:14 2015 UTC,I'm not good with hotkeys and so I actually use a glitch to repair fast. I take armor off of my slots and while i'm still holding it in my inv press esc. It automatically puts it in slot nine when before the armor would disappear. I don't know if that counts as abusing a glitch however :P

DvZ,36or7e,winter477,5,Fri May 22 15:16:01 2015 UTC,Maybe a Story or Lore filter? People have written a bunch of stories and lore for themselves and maps they've made.  A Tutorial filter? People who post informative content would be great to find.
DvZ,36or7e,Endergrill,4,Fri May 22 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"Stories and Lore can go into Fan art... art doesn't have to be restricted to visual art :P  Tutorial filter would be nice, though."
DvZ,36or7e,Stadic777,2,Thu May 21 14:06:11 2015 UTC,"This is true, but generally when people say ""Art"" they're referring to visual art or music. Writing can still be considered art, but by the average person its generally just ""Writing"" or ""Stories,"" etc. It wouldn't hurt to have a separate category for stories, if not for that distinction alone, then simply for sorting purposes. The two are different enough that someone who clicks to filter by ""Fan Art"" might only want to be seeing pictures, and not stories."
DvZ,36or7e,keaganwill,2,Thu May 21 14:57:42 2015 UTC,I agree that stories are probably best under 'fan art' but I like the tutorial idea.
DvZ,36or7e,Clefstar,3,Thu May 21 18:11:37 2015 UTC,How about a question filter?
DvZ,36or7e,keaganwill,2,Fri May 22 15:09:36 2015 UTC,There already is one :)

DvZ,36o8ug,vector_nova,1 point,Thu May 21 02:54:49 2015 UTC,Just wondering... what are you doing for facial expressions? Are you swapping out head/faces to get different looks (and mouth openings) or what? From my experience that is the most efficient but just wondering :D
DvZ,36o8ug,keaganwill,1 point,Thu May 21 03:04:43 2015 UTC,"While professionals swap out heads for each salable and facial expression that would be UBER expensive.

DvZ,36ob2b,Endergrill,1 point,Thu May 21 00:25:55 2015 UTC,It was an old bug that let you bring your items with you when you died. Then when you randomly were chosen as a special monster you would spawn with said item still in your inventory.

I also want to look at a design.  Edit: not a bug, just something that wasn't intended for you to do. When doing this, you also run the risk of getting lost.

DvZ,36ol0g,FizZmc,6,Thu May 21 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  Generating chunks isn't the problem. The problem is when a dwarf decides to run away from the game and do their own thing, when they are supposed to be building defences or defending shrines. There are millions of things you can do in DvZ, but it's a roleplaying game which depends on players not being total morons and buggering off into the wilderness to do their own thing.  Whatever your opinions of the harm you might or might not be doing by going on a little shopping trip in the middle of a DvZ game, you don't actually get to chose what's allowed and what isn't. If someone tells you that something can get you banned, the sensible thing to do is to take that advice on board and not do it, not to argue about whether or not it's a problem. The simple fact is you're not allowed to run off and play with villagers, you never have been in DvZ.  I honestly can't tell if you're an idiot or a troll. Everything you say and do seems almost deliberately calculated to irritate other people. If you refuse to listen to anyone's advice and get banned as a result, don't complain."
DvZ,36ol0g,Wifi_LC,5,Thu May 21 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"(even if you say. ""But clef. It's all for vanity. I just wanted to have a picture of my skeleton with all these special items."" I say in response that if it's allowed at all there is an ability to abuse it. No matter how care-free the intention you're better off treating any bugs as taboo and avoiding them rather then trying to find exceptions to them.)   You seem to have missed this part."
DvZ,36o8te,cboy7,13,Wed May 20 20:50:08 2015 UTC,no offense but its a bit silly to post updates on a map and not the screenies or downloads... also it is kinda silly even with screen shots

DvZ,36o8te,Wifi_LC,13,Thu May 21 11:10:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure no one wants to see a map built by someone who is Perma Banned.
DvZ,36o8te,Aragoth_,2,Wed May 20 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"Well I think he's just trying to be apart of the community even if he can't play. Just out of curiosity, what were you banned for? If you don't want to answer that's fine."
DvZ,36o8te,Axxmin,6,Thu May 21 05:55:31 2015 UTC,Someone who has been banned from the server obviously did something which went against the idea of the community and so deserves no place within it.

DvZ,36k8d3,firebolt8900,3,Wed May 20 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"I see poison as a team player; it can slow dwarves from running, it can provide a route over walls, and it can kill afk dwarves or repairers with the infil. Wither is the solo killer. It's about tanking damage with ultimate as well as healing easily, and with sniper it can easily drain a dwarf of mana by rapid shooting. Flame skelly is the crowd harasser. It's shots can volley and spread, that's just begging to be shot at big crowds and not at lone dwarves. Impact skelly is the wall breaker and literally death on raenil and rift. It tears through slabs."
DvZ,36k8d3,Axxmin,2,Wed May 20 01:47:29 2015 UTC,"hmm I can see where you get opinion from, for me wither and poison are all about hitting dwarfs while fire and siege are about hitting walls to either destroy them or have maximum fire spread but I can see where you are coming from"
DvZ,36k8d3,firebolt8900,3,Wed May 20 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"I guess it all comes down to playstyle, for me fire is about turning bottlenecks against the dwarves, and compensating for my atrocious aim and lag. I actually actually agree that fire is a support class, and feel wither is the only true offensive skelly (reinforced skulls, slight melee upgrades), but to me impact is for breaching, and poison is for infiltration. To me that makes them the most mergable."

A bow that has such a graceful ""twang"" when she fires, she pierces the hearts of mobs with double damage, and a spurt of fire erupts around the mob for a second."
DvZ,36ei21,JTHousek1,2,Tue May 19 00:42:24 2015 UTC,"Firework launcher: Dragon's Breath  Has a cast time (must stand still)) of ~ 5 seconds (taking damage stops cast), and a cool down of 30. Shoots a medium speed missile (fire charge speed) that when it hits a block, entity, or travels 100 blocks explodes into fireworks. Fireworks explode for 5 seconds, and any dwarf in the explosion is immune to blindness for ~5 seconds and monsters are given blindness. AI zombies are slowed.    An interesting tool that can be used to help dwarves out of tight situation or slow down choke points. Also can be used to shoot fireworks in the air for fun.  Balance-wise, it might need ammo (or a longer cool down). I was thinking about having to make fireworks to fire (similar to arrows) that could be used as normal fireworks. (and wouldn't have the buff/debug effect)    I've always wanted a firework launcher, and this would be a great weapon to help out a dwarf running away from a hoard of AI monsters. Probably a one in a game (hero) weapon, because more could be op."

I can link it to you if you want, but basically every second or such, you will get a maximum weakness effect (While you have maximum weakness you cannot punch anything.. like no knockback) While you have this maximum weakness effect, you time a command block that applies mining fatigue to the weakness so that the timing is in sync. It looks really cool when you can set it up right.   I experimented with the haste effect, but there is a mercy rule in vanilla minecraft that cannot be breached, so slowing your attack speed is the only option"

DvZ,36bj71,Endergrill,2,Mon May 18 10:21:18 2015 UTC,I want Safefall and Darkvision for the Canyon gold mine... Just Wheee! down to the bottom.
DvZ,36bj71,Cronurd,1 point,Tue May 19 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"Makes it a lot easier to chase after things down stairs and hills. Of course it also gives you an advantage in a rage event, if you get a chance to knock a Jimmy off a wall and jump down after them."
DvZ,36bj71,MillicentOak,6,Mon May 18 15:54:10 2015 UTC,"Procs should be purchaseable so Jimmies are aware of what they're buying and know what special ability they have.. But it should not take 5 games to get enough gold to buy it imo, given how core to the game it is"
DvZ,36bj71,Imhotep0,3,Mon May 18 09:58:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe Jimmy could start with some free gold to spend as they see fit, and they could find out about procs that way?  If that were the case though, it'd be helpful if Jimmy got an indicator on the lobby screen telling them that they have gold to spend on upgrades. Maybe not in the item bar, because they might not know the significance of it, and I doubt the scoreboard can be manipulated to show each player their own gold in vanilla (...?) unless somehow each player is in their own lobby. A welcome message in the chat window might be the most newbie-friendly way of telling someone that sort of thing."
DvZ,36bj71,MillicentOak,3,Mon May 18 10:07:08 2015 UTC,"It's good that Jimmy has to play a few games to get the Proc. Essentially it ensures they understand how the game works before receiving possibly the most confusing part and becoming eligible for hero.  Besides, Proc isn't as essential as some people make it out to be. I showed by roommate DvZ and watched in awe as he made it to the final 5 dwarves with zero upgrades. At the end of the day, your fundamentals are more important than any upgrades."
DvZ,36bj71,PrivateChicken,3,Mon May 18 13:11:25 2015 UTC,I really like the possibilities of the armour decay swapping out the diamond for iron and chain male is really cool. I hope they mess with it and re texture those two to look like cracked diamond or something.
DvZ,36bj71,5ilver42,2,Mon May 18 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, cracked diamond for iron and then truly fragmented and shredded armor for chain."
DvZ,36bj71,ULiopleurodon,1 point,Mon May 18 16:19:41 2015 UTC,Pretty awesome. The armor should be unbreakable to prevent confusion.

DvZ,36bj71,TheDrCreeps,3,Mon May 18 03:23:49 2015 UTC,Not that big of a change... mob dmg is halved... I do not like the feel of it however... when we first got the extra row it did not flip the game upside down but it did feel SOOOO good

Not going to speculate too much about other changes while everything's still in the test phase, so instead here's something small I hope happens in the update - some kind of epic music stuff when the game ends. There's cool music when the game begins, and all the heroes have death sounds, but by comparison the final shrine falling is kind of bland."
DvZ,36bddn,Tomlough,5,Mon May 18 00:34:03 2015 UTC,Well in a test game we just had a new armour system that included only having ten hearts and I thought that was really cool!  (we also just had a test game that dwarves got ~2 shot and no proc hearts! Hehe that was a lot of fun!)
DvZ,36bddn,Girafferider133,5,Mon May 18 00:27:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't played any of the test games with new mechanics, so I can only base this off hearsay, and of course this is just from tests so it's all subject to change, but...   Armour visibly degrading Repairing is faster closer to the shrine Being able to see each other's faces Bleeding when low on mana   I don't really know how the custom class system is going to be implemented, but if it end up levelling out the dwarves a bit, so that new Jimmies aren't as disadvantaged compared to those who have every (available) upgrade, then that's got to be a good thing in my eyes.  I recognise that there are people who enjoy grinding out upgrades in an MMO style, and they want to feel it was worth it having done so, but I genuinely don't think that that's necessary to make the game replayable. I've been here for coming up to one and a half years now, and it's not because I want to buy upgrades ;)"
DvZ,36bddn,MillicentOak,2,Mon May 18 07:25:54 2015 UTC,Custom dwarf class. Everyone can play to their unique play style.

DvZ,36bddn,ULiopleurodon,2,Mon May 18 15:36:54 2015 UTC,I'd say the new heroes. It's nice to have variation after a year of the same 3 (not saying they're boring).
DvZ,36bddn,Axxmin,2,Mon May 18 03:07:38 2015 UTC,"The classes, I feel like this will add some variety to the combat. I really hope for some magic items to return. (but likely not)"
DvZ,36bddn,TheDrCreeps,2,Mon May 18 03:14:19 2015 UTC,Everything really.  All the test games so far had something positive for me in them. So i'm hyped for all of it.
DvZ,36bddn,Juliandroid98,2,Mon May 18 08:57:35 2015 UTC,My new favourite feature?  Compass.
DvZ,36bddn,falcon9100,2,Mon May 18 11:30:43 2015 UTC,The monster heroes of course. Everyone's been asking for it and now it's going to happen for real. And also should they be called villains instead of heroes.
DvZ,36bddn,User_HC,1 point,Mon May 18 21:10:13 2015 UTC,Not really... As a player you take both sides (monster and dwarf/gnome) so from your perspective monster hero's ARE your hero's... If you only played as dwarf then yes

DvZ,36b2jt,zzCratoszz,7,Mon May 18 00:36:51 2015 UTC,Its not just you. There are plenty of younger people or people who think they are younger who let their anger get the best of them. A prime example can be seen just about any time a hero dies early. Plenty of people like to call them names in global instead of role playing how they just lost a leader in battle. If you don't let them get to you they can't win. If you ever need a friend in game feel free to msg me. ign: zzKratoszz
DvZ,36b2jt,wanderingfalcon,5,Mon May 18 00:39:52 2015 UTC,Anyone who calls new Heros bad gets an automatic ignore from me.  I turned heroes on a few weeks ago and I have maybe played them 6 times or so? (And by few weeks I probably mean months). Once in a test game.  I make it a little farther each time and 100% of the time get called shit by someone.   But everyone else is nice and we just have to encourage that because there will be more new people than not pretty soon.
DvZ,36b2jt,Imanota,8,Mon May 18 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"I think all communities have some sort of dark side. Sometimes you just find yourself facing it but the important thing to realize is that not everyone is like that and to ignore the harassing ones. Also, as others have said, submit a ticket. if people are willing to harass you, they are probably willing to harass others and thats not good for anyone."
DvZ,36b2jt,MillicentOak,5,Sun May 17 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"Please ticket this sort of thing, not only is it deeply unpleasant for you and definitely against the rules Rob established on PMC* (which still apply here, afaik), but it also sets a bad example for the new Jimmies if they see that sort of thing in chat.  P.S. You're not even remotely shit <3  *I'm linking an archived version of the rules because they've since reworded them, and I haven't been through to check exactly how they're different.

DvZ,369ts0,Tebotron,10,Sun May 17 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"We all, as a community have to be two things to new players:  1) Welcoming 2) Patient  DvZ is not a simple game to understand. It has nuances and bits and pieces that take while to understand. The game chat moves fast and there are a lot of in-game terms.  Prox, slab, skybase, block-off. All terms we understand but others mightnot. Along with heroes, horn, staff, Lord of the Undead and others.  The only way is to be patient. There's no guarentee of a tutorial being made or even them watching them. We need to instruct and teach one jimmy at a time or on reddit.  Getting frustrated and being able to push people or forcing people to do things won't help the game at all.  We need to provide the example. All of us. Not just ""the good people"". If we don't we create a ""new generation"" of poor players.  DvZ can be awesome or rubbish. What makes it good or bad is the guys playing it. We need to help make good ones."
DvZ,369ts0,MillicentOak,6,Sun May 17 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. If I die because I've been blocked out, but Jimmy sees this and learns from it, then my death won't be in vain. Of course, I'm apt to say in chat that I died trying to get back into the keep, but that's because Jimmy can't be expected to know my intentions, not because I want to name and shame them.  may curse in the relative privacy of Mumble, but that's because it's a safe place to let off steam, not because I harbour any genuine animosity."
DvZ,369ts0,Tomlough,5,Sun May 17 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"The cool down would result in no one being able to kill another Jimmy.   You want an upgrade that lets you punch other dwarves off stuff, intended to be used on new players. New players who won't have safefall. This will kill dwarves.  No, this isn't the solution. Clueless Jimmies are not a new problem, they come and go with the seasons and the best way to deal with it is to leave them to it. Many of them will quickly decide they're not actually interested in the game; there is no point in trying to teach those. The ones who do stay will learn over time - in order to learn from your mistakes you must first be allowed to make mistakes.  It takes just one game for a new player to learn they can't 'win the game' by hiding instead of fighting at final. People who build weird space towers and skybases will eventually learn that they're not safe (damn you, safefall) and stop building them. And if they stick around long enough they'll eventually get to grips with the game and the community properly.  Yeah, if someone blocks you out it's going to be annoying. But that's no reason to start slapping people."

DvZ,369ts0,TheDrCreeps,3,Mon May 18 09:50:02 2015 UTC,I believe Rob intends to make more videos of DVZ for YT (hopefully with the other BW members as well).  And I know for a fact that our own itsBad (formerly IBadassI) has explained basic dvz knowledge in Timmy's videos in efforts to assist new players who are in his fanbase.  Also I wouldn't support the punching thing at all.  It would be so misused for not it's intended purpose and would be more hurtful to the game than anything  Something like tearing down an entire defense though could be considered bad fellowship especially if you can prove that you explained why it's there and they still don't care.  Best you can do about that is just explain and if that doesn't work then take some screenshots and submit it if you feel it's worthy of one
DvZ,369ts0,Tomlough,3,Sun May 17 17:43:27 2015 UTC,I believe Rob intends to make more videos of DVZ for YT (hopefully with the other BW members as well).

While I agree that the influx of new players might be cumbersome in the short-term, in the long run it is absolutely great for the server, as the new players bring life to the server and community.   The obvious hurdles in the way for them to become established in the game and community is experience and respect which can both be acquired in game by just playing it and be nice to everyone.   Roughly a month ago I stumbled on a Dutch DvZ video made by a youtuber who had a fairly sized channel with loyal subscribers and I thought it might have been worth a shot to reach out to him and I asked if he needed some help with the game from someone experienced.   Long story short, he said yes, and now there are four Dutch DvZ videos out there which, hopefully, explain the basic mechanics of the game as good as possible. I've had help from friends who taught Timmy the core of the game, so we could teach those things to the Dutch people.   I am fully aware that there is no way you can teach the whole game to everyone in four videos, but that is where the community comes in. I've told the Dutch Jimmies in video to ask their questions in English as much as possible, just so that the most people can understand them and I am so happy to see that there are so many people out there who are willing to help them out with their questions.   I also understand that there are also Dutch players who don't understand English that well and therefore keep asking things in Dutch. I understand that this can be annoying, but please bear with them. I try the best I can answering things whenever I see a Dutch question (unrelated to my YouTube channel) pop up and I am sure that other Dutch people do the same.

DvZ,369ts0,johnb43,2,Sun May 17 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"We should never look down on new players for doing things that, to us, seem stupid or illogical. We were all new at one point and we all had our moments that when looking back seem silly. Like Teb said, being welcoming and patient are the key to dealing with new players. They'll learn in time but they need to be given the time in order to learn. Experience is the best way to learn, and preventing them from experiencing the downsides of their own strategies is preventing them from being able to experience the game and learn the game and become better at it. No one starts playing and is suddenly good. It takes time and practice, and every player deserves the ability to get better.   There's nothing wrong with videos and tutorials, and they're probably one of the best ways for a person to get the basic idea of how the game is played (Though its no substitute for actually playing the game). Additionally, there's nothing wrong with players in-game providing suggestions for new players. But what's most important is that we don't look down upon new players, because one day they might be the talk of the town and they'll just see everyone else as the people who were constantly putting them down. As a community we need to welcome incoming players with open arms and give them the gentle nudge in the right direction to help them grow as players. Being condescending, rude, or disrespectful gets no one anywhere and might just ruin a new players experience with the game."
DvZ,369ts0,johnb43,2,Sun May 17 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, tutorials are good. I mean, if they came here because they watched a video, maybe they'll be happy to watch a video? :P So please, go ahead and make some!  That said, most people, when they find a new game, kinda just want to dive into it rather than sit around learning about it, and then if there's anything they're confused about, they'll look that up or ask. So it's kinda to be expected that people will rely on natural survival instincts. So, if they're not learning from watching videos, how else do they learn?  They learn by observing what's going on around them, of course. So be a role model for them. They're more likely to learn that skybases are ineffectual if they see dwarves killing everything in sight beneath them, while they can barely get anything. Knocking them out of it doesn't teach them that, it just teaches them that it's okay to be rude.  Sometimes, you're not going to get your own way, and things won't be built or run to your liking. That's life. Try and remember that you're going to lose anyway, and the idea is to make a valiant last stand in the face of adversity. I've done that a couple of times in the last few days, and to be honest, it's been more fun than usual. The feeling of slowly being rescued by another experienced dwarf from Jimmy's frantic blocking off as I try to hold out until that last block breaks, or of holding a final shrine as the skybases crumble and fall around me, is pretty epic. And it's always nice to have variety. People are trying to make the game more dangerous for dwarves through maps design, but Jimmy can do that for us to."
DvZ,369ts0,pjvm2000z,2,Sun May 17 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"I think that having new jimmyes in game is always a good thing. They help games being shorter and more random. It is exiting to be blocked off and only way to survive is procin until creepers blow you a passage. Its also fun to see all the same reappearing jimmy tricks, like building mazes, skybases, roofs, or hiding etc... And from mob perspective its fun to kill 10 jimmies with single wolverine.  Dvz like any other game is most fun when you are still new jimmy, when you have things to learn and master. So dont ruin their fun by being rude to them."

The tunnels from second might possibly be too small but I'll wait and see how they play before I pass judgement, and there are two of them anyway.  Final shrine would require the golem barrier bug to be fixed, but that needs doing anyway (and might already be fixed in the summer update).  Creepers destroy quartz very easily, is the map designed with that in mind or would you want that mechanic changed? (Again, it may already be changing with the advent of Goblins.)  Again, great map and I LOVE RAINBOWS"
DvZ,3692tn,Tomlough,3,Sun May 17 11:47:55 2015 UTC,"Haven't actually sat down and had a multiple hour DvZ session in months (since, like, January) so I didn't know about a lot of the bugs till I was mostly done with the map.   The tunnels are narrow because there's two. Gets even worse with the tunnel on the left, which splits off again. So that's three openings on the other side.  They're easy to defend, but once one goes they're pretty much both gonna go.  Did not know about that bug. I did hear about the golems being able to break barriers bug, but I assumed that'd be fixed in the update. If I need to go fix it, whatever, it wouldn't be that tough of a fix. The map'd just look slightly less pretty. Not designed with that in mind, but it may end up changing with goblins, as you said. If not, the defended areas that are mostly quartz are also heavily bedrocked. Like, the quartz is one block thick, then bedrock. The stone walls'd still keep the creepers back, theoretically. If all else fails I go back and swap the quarts with diorite or something. Again, easy fix that'd just make it a bit less pretty.   And I'm glad to hear see a fellow rainbow appreciator!"

I think the area where the quartz would be most problematic is in the tunnels from second, because IIRC the quartz will be destroyed instantly by creepers but the chiselled stone brick will be impervious to them.  I don't actually think that's a huge deal though, if goblins don't change the mechanics smart dwarves will just dig the floor out - it won't look as nice, but at least it's possible (unlike the final shrine of Friendship Town) and hey, there's a war on."

DvZ,369oey,penguiniusrex,4,Sun May 17 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"One of the best things you can do when making a map is organise your ideas for it. Things like concept art, trello boards or just general notes on what you want your map to look like/play like is very beneficial when it comes to actually making it. If you have a list of things or just something to look at to help keep you motivated and so you don't come to a stop part-way through is really the best way to do it.    As for Minecraft Editing tools, MCEdit, WorldEdit and World Painter are all excellent tools for building maps. The best way to learn how to use them is to just use them. Experiment with them figure out what each of the tools do and how to use them. If you get stuck on how to do something just google it, there will usually be a youtube video or a text post explaining it.    My advice would be to use World Painter for terrain, it's a very quick way to build the entire environment of a map and have it look more natural than what can be achieved with either WE or MCE. The latter tools however are great for building structures, WE is very handy if you take the time to set it up on your world, as you can just make larger edits without having to back out of Minecraft. MCEdit can do most of the things WE can do and is a lot easier to use, it can also do things on a much greater scale (You can make Edits with over a Billion blocks provided your PC can handle it). But it is a bit more inconvenient as you have to back out of the world, make the changes save it and re-open it, and if you missed something or did it wrong you have to go back and change it again. And again the best way to learn how to use them is to just mess around in them."
DvZ,369oey,Doom_BringerMC,4,Sun May 17 16:05:18 2015 UTC,"more natural than what can be achieved with either WE or MCE.   I agree with everything else ;)  First paragraph in particular is good advice for any endeavour, not just map making!"

Step 2 use the raise or lower tool."

Change the minimum and maximum height to 1, so the terrain on top of the bedrock is only one thick. Tick ""Keep steep terrain covered"" so that the mountains can have a layer covering the bedrock Set underground material to Bedrock so you don't get resources, water and lava generating under the bedrock. Set the border to void and make sure Bottomless World is unchecked. In ""Default Terrain"" delete all non-bedrock layers (unless you want snow topped mountains without bedrock). Then in Chasms and Caverns, Resources and Other Layers uncheck everything so the only material being used is Bedrock.   Then start editing the terrain itself."

People often think that trees provide cover for mobs, but as anyone who played H'Cet or Daragor (once mob spawn was moved back and the forest was added, on the multiple shrines version) can tell you, they really don't provide much if the mobs then have to emerge from the tree line to attack on an open field. On the other hand, the trees next to the first shrine on Valley are excellent for monsters, because they provide cover at ground level and an alternative route at canopy level.  As for void/lava traps, I'm really hoping that the upcoming update is going to nerf (some) dwarves and buff monsters enough that they're no longer seen as a feature people need to make sure that their map isn't seen as boring."

Wither skeletons aside, they've never been super powerful and really only have their niche uses. With that being said, there's a bit of freedom with how people choose to play as monsters and they should certainly be given that freedom! As always, if people want to run skelly inside and possibly give easy procs, there's nothing stopping them. There's nothing stopping people from going melee skelly if they choose to. And of course, there's nothing stopping a person from trying to kill dwarves as a skelly instead of harassing them.

DvZ,36a6ea,figsandthings,1 point,Mon May 18 15:55:45 2015 UTC,The slowness effect of the poison skele is very overpowered since you need an AI zombie or a stupid player zombie to kill in order to keep your proc going (also helps out with dwarfs trying to run away)
DvZ,36a6ea,TheDrCreeps,1 point,Sun May 17 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"This is true, but if you're diligent you can power through the slowness. Its not the same as a wither skeleton bow spamming you in the past where a few hits meant death."

DvZ,36a6ea,Morvereth,4,Mon May 18 12:14:26 2015 UTC,Skeletons get most of their kills from killing A.I zombies! you can't hit a thing!
DvZ,36a6ea,Juliandroid98,3,Sun May 17 22:59:10 2015 UTC,Skeletons dont really do that much damage. Considering how hard it is to hit anything when there is AI mobs as mask. When you are at 10 hearths or below without armorpiece its ok to die 1 or 2 shot. Creepers kill on those situations too.   If skeletons are nerfed even more who would play skeleton? And if there is no skeleton players there is lot less easy sources of procs :)

DvZ,36790q,LucasRed1,2,Sat May 16 21:07:49 2015 UTC,"You see a fellow dwarf taking a nap on the throne in the shrine room of a castle far far away that hasn't been disturbed due to a magical shield keeping away from the monsters, you walk up to the dwarf. ""Oh, so you want to know my origins? First of all, I am the warrior Lucas Red! As for my father, was a pirate. He sailed the oceans, seeking adventure. He then married the head chef of his crew, then she gave birth to me. My grandfather, he was a ship repairman. He wanted to repair his great x7 grandfather's ship, so he had to earn money for the parts. He had been working hard repairing ships for over 17 years and eventually married, divorced, married again, divorced again over and over again for 6 years until he found the perfect woman. My great grandfather was a king of this nation until his stepbrother murdered him and took the throne. My great great stepuncle and his son were terrible rulers until this kingdom had declined and was taken over by the monsters. My great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather was an extremely weak dragon (It's the reason why I smell vaguely of cinnamon buns, why I really HATE beans, and my breath is 31 degrees celsius) that was eventually killed (It took only 3 minutes for him to be killed). I have no idea how a dragon could mate with a human, but whatever. My great great great great great great great great grandfather was a full fledged dwarf, but he married my great great great great great great great great grandmother (whose great great great great great great great grandfather was a dragon) and gave birth to a child who would eventually become a king. I am also 1/256 kobald, but I am nothing like a kobald, kobald. What? No, I didn't say kobald, kobald. You're just going crazy, kobald. Now, about me specifically, I decided to go back to my great grandfather's homeland to take back the throne. With me training myself to wield the sword, shoot a bow, mine gravel, build defences for keeps, chop lumber, how to parry with an axe, and a bunch of other stuff that a dwarf in the great dwarven war would do. I finished my journey and found the lands in ruin. The remaining people were trying to survive with all they got. I asked them what was going on, and they had explained. I eventually told them that I can lead them. About 6 (hundred) years later, the lands were in some pretty good shape. I have no idea what allowed me to live so long (Probably the meat of that giant, seemingly immortal, flaming bird I ate had nothing to do with it; most likely that I'm part dwarf)."" You either marvel or yawn in boredom at his tale. If you yawned, then Lucas Red told you to get out of his sight. If you marvel in excitement, then continue listening to the story. ""Now, let me tell you about my weapons. This tale will be very short. Whenever my longbow gets destroyed, I turn it into a runeblade. Whenever my runeblade gets destroyed, I turn it into a longbow. Yeah, that's right! My longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow which used to be a book about necromancy which used to be a longbow which used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow used to be a runeblade which used to be a longbow which used to be my great great great great great great great great grandmother.

You say that it wasn't really short, but longer than the previous story. Lucas Red chuckles, which sounds suspiciously of embarassment, but he doesn't even blush. ""Well, how do you think my castle looks?"" You are shocked that he is the king of this kingdom. You then reply..."

Meaning that you, Lucas Red, are 17 generations down a true dragon!  EVEN if your 16x grandfather was an extremely weak dragon! Therefore you are actually more of a dragon than you thought!   I knew that a weak dragon 16x generations down couldn't vaguely smell of cinnamon buns! Only a true dragon 17x generations down could possibly possess such a trait!  I conclude that you are 1 / 131072 pure dragon, and 1 / 65536 weak dragon. A mighty combo I must say! (To put this in perspective, you are ""1 / 2 to the 8th power"" Kobold....

DvZ,36790q,Thomalien,2,Sun May 17 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"Born without a body, I was forced into a life of seclusion. I spent my early life as a wanderer, roaming and without a home. Whenever I came across civilization I was met with judgement. How do you see? How do you smell? How do you exist? It was always the same, so I kept on wandering. One fateful day however, I stumbled a Dwarven civilization. I was scared to approach their mighty keep, but my solitary life had led me to crave interaction with others. I needed a place to where I belonged, and I was tired of searching. In desperation I hatched a scheme to blend in. I stole some clothes from a farmhouse and crafted myself a mask out of a wooden bowl. My disguise was complete, and I made my to the Dwarven keep. As I walked amongst the Dwarves I was nervous, but none of them seemed to see through my disguise. I ended up spending years amongst the dwarves, hiding in plain sight. Through those years I grew accustomed to Dwarven life and even made some friends, something I had spent my years prior without. Little did any of us know however, that death and destruction were on their way. When the time for battle came I joined every other able-bodied dwarf in preparation. I donned my suit of armor, picked up my sword, and made my way to the battlefield. I was not a dwarf but that wasn't important. There on the battlefield—the proving ground—the only thing that mattered was the courage in one's heart."
DvZ,36790q,Thomalien,1 point,Sun May 17 02:18:14 2015 UTC,"Well. I lead a agited life. I was kidnapped by aliens. They renamed me to Thomalien, i can no longer remember my real name. I spent 2 years of my life with them. I was submitted to several dailly experiments to break my will to fight and to see how tought dwarves really were. But i was unbreakable, i would never abandon my fellow dwarves, so they just gave up and left me to die on Earth. The monsters spotted me, with no weapon to proctet myself with i thought it was the end, or worse. The monsters wanted to test me, they wanted me to fight for them, they wanted to break my will, but were always unsuccessful, i refused to abandon the dwarves! Later when they were almost about to turn me, i thought about my fellow kin and pushed on, surviving each day has it were my last. Then when i thought all was lost. I stole a wooden dagger, set myself free and ran way. With zombies after me, with skillies shooting at me, with gollems putting their armour on, with wolves sharping their teeth i was about to loose hope. All of a sudden i see an arrow fly towards the monsters almost hiting me, an elit squad of dwarves arrived out of nowhere. Killing all the monsters, and rescuing me. There they stood Nis, defraction, john, halo, xKal, louis and others. Almost dead, i stood up, with the remaining of my forces. Stared at them, almost giving up into tears. I was finally free from the monsters, and back with my kin. They looked at me and each one of them gave me an item to fight off the monsters along side them. When the battle of the Frost was over i fainted.  Couldn't wake up, lost in my dreams i thought about the reasons for the kidnapping, i thought what would have happen if had really given up hope, i would be fighting my own kin! I would be killing my own brothers. I woke up in a laboratory. Nis looking into my eyes and mumbling some words that i didn't understand. Making me feel better. I got up, thanked him and left. I still do not know what he was doing. Still weak i wanted to make a difference in the war. I didn't want any other dwarves to suffer what i suffered. I grabbed a sword and a ale. Made a bow and crafted arrows. Took some torches and searched for some cobble and joined the front wall. On the first night almost about to die, in a Vulcano, def cames and saves me. Again. He looked at me, smiled within the flames and said - ""C'mon! Move or we'll both die"". Finally out i was exausted. But i never gave up. If i was going to die i would do so fighting along side my brothes! i heard screams far away, a dwarf needed me - ""Help. Please Help Me. I'll die"". Running the fastest i could i reached him in the nick of time and saved him, his words will forever remain in my heart - ""Thank you, my friend"".  I managed to make a diference. I saved a dwaf. Returning to the front wall i greeted halo he had his bow prepared to shoot some monsters. Saw john fighting of the monsters. So even though  i was tired. Even though i knew i would die i joined the fight. To this day i continue fighting for them, saving them, being saved, helping and building.  If i am going to die i would do so leaving some sort of heritage behind."

But at the end of the day they will need to restrict players significantly to keep the server at a small size.  Plus this is more incentive for people to support the server.  At the worst we will just have to wait a few weeks before we can play a functional and hopefully prosperous DvZ.

DvZ,364ruk,keaganwill,1 point,Sat May 16 17:21:02 2015 UTC,I have not personally read the EULA but would the super Jimmy only mode infringe on that? Or would it be fine because you are not giving advantages simply being able to play
DvZ,364ruk,Tomlough,10,Sat May 16 06:05:57 2015 UTC,You can charge for access to a server. https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation-the-follow-up-qa/   Can I charge for access to my server? Yes. How players join a server is up to you. Single entrance fees or subscriptions are both allowed.  How often am I allowed to charge players to access my server? You can charge players as regularly as you like. You can even charge for timed access if you think it’s the best way to monetise your server.
DvZ,364ruk,5ilver42,1 point,Sat May 16 06:57:38 2015 UTC,"From what I remember from last year, the issues came from game changing items that could be purchased with and basically be a 'pay to win' server. As DvZ is currently handed that isn't the case.  I haven't read the EULA either, but the differences on this server are purely cosmetic and act really only as an acknowledgement to being one that has donated."
DvZ,364ruk,keaganwill,1 point,Sat May 16 06:35:25 2015 UTC,Aaaand? Not trying to be rude but this is not really addressing my question... during summer for a time ONLY super Jimmy will be able to play
DvZ,364ruk,5ilver42,2,Sat May 16 06:49:05 2015 UTC,"So, I gave a read to the terms on monjangs website and found: https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/   You are allowed to charge players to access your server  So long as the fee is the same for all players, you are allowed to charge for access to your server. You are not allowed to split your playerbase into paying, and non-paying users, nor can you restrict gameplay elements to different tiers of player.  Basically, if you’re charging for access to your server, you are selling a “ticket” and there can only be one type of ticket, regardless of how much people are willing to spend.  You are allowed to accept donations  You are allowed to accept donations from players. You can thank them publicly or in-game, but can’t give preferential treatment for donating. You are not allowed to restrict gameplay features in an attempt to make money.   So from my understanding of this, it's all cool."
DvZ,364ruk,TheRealMasono,-1,Sat May 16 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"Since Mojang never made the EULA into a legal document, they have no control what servers do"
DvZ,364ruk,Tomlough,4,Sat May 16 06:58:29 2015 UTC,"This is not true, the EULA is a legal document which prohibits people from making money from the game.

DvZ,364ruk,Jumblepa,1 point,Sun May 17 02:49:17 2015 UTC,See this is where im glad I just bought super jimmy a few months back
DvZ,364ruk,DwarvesVsZombies,-1,Sat May 16 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"Rob said ""it goes from 100 dollars a month to 1000 dollars a month"". Now I might be being completely naive here but surely with the amount of super jimmies already playing then they are getting far more than 100 dollars a month? Probably more than that from just Endy...so surely for the first month they will have that extra money stacked up ready for the update when they will need more of it? Where has the extra money gone?  Not trying to claim they are making over 1000 a month, of course, or even near it. Let's take some estimates, which I think are fair/an understatement. So let's say there have been an average of 70 super jimmies (i think there are more but just to cut down on the numbers to show) over the 6.5 months this server has been going. Now let's take say 5 off for those who bought lifetime on BrucesGym, which would take it down to 65. Another problem would then be trying to figure out how many people have bought the 3/6/12 months respectively, which is rather challenging. I would say probably 50% are 3, 35% are 6, and 15% are 12, just from my observations and assumptions. Taking all of this into account, here are some numbers.  No. of people with 3 months = 32  No. of people with 6 months = 23  No. of people with 12 months = 10  Then using these numbers to figure out how much they all pay,  Amount paid by 3 month SJ= 15(amount for 3 month SJ)x32(No. of 3 month SJ) x 2.1667(number of times they would have to pay in the 6.5 months) = $1040  Amount paid by 6 month SJ= 27x23x1.08334 = $672.75  Amount paid by 12 month SJ= 50x10x1(assuming those with 12 only bought one since it can't have run out yet) = $500  That would meant the total, with my assumptions and estimates (which I think are fair) would be $2212.75  Take away the price of the server that Rob state in the video, which would be $650 and you have $1562.75  Now they say that the server would be $1k for the month, which would seem to be covered, at least for the first month and a half, but you also have to consider the potential new super jimmies coming in as well, on top of the fact that my assumptions are probably an understatement.  So you start to wonder where all the money has gone, since Rob said they don't do this for profit in the last video."
DvZ,364ruk,ewokaro,2,Sat May 16 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Ginna let MMG argue with you over the numbers, but you have to remember Rob and niso have other projects that aren't DvZ to financially support (UQuest especially), as well as basic living costs. Even if the DvZ server was running a profit, something I personally doubt, it's even more unlikely that the money made is going straight into their bank accounts- there are a lot of overheads and other basic costs to consider for a start."
DvZ,364ruk,DwarvesVsZombies,1 point,Sun May 17 08:58:45 2015 UTC,"The math you have done here is inconclusive. You would need to divide the total revenue of the Super Jimmy purchases by the number of months they are valid for. Doing this math; (32)(15)/3 = 160, (23)(27)/6 = 103.5, (12)(50)/12 = 50. We find the total per month cost is about $310, and nowhere near $2212. So unless 4 times more newcomers are going to buy super jimmy, it would be unsustainable."
DvZ,364ruk,Oldmantoby,1 point,Sat May 16 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"I wasn't doing it per month, as I said I based it on the 6.5 months the server has been going. What I was trying to get at, was that there should still be lots of money left over from the previous months, that should be able to cover the influx of new players, until they die down."

There are not enough slots on the server to accommodate the number of players Rob is expecting once the update is released. Besides this, it's unlikely that the update will be free of bugs at release. The fact that he is briefly making the server Super Jimmy-only means that the majority of the people playing the game will be familiar with community aspects like the subreddit which makes it easier to give feedback about bugs and issues, and it also means that the people who can access the server during its busiest period are the people who pay for the server.  By the way, a small tip. If someone's doing something to make you happy, and a time comes when they have to stop doing it for a short while, if you then respond with ungrateful posts like this and ""God really?""... you're really going to put people off from trying to make you happy."

This is to limit traffic through the server because Rob knows that the current server cannot handle the amount of new players that he expects will come during summer. This is hopefully only going to be two weeks of testing different things but then the server will become free to play again. This is all an effort to keep the DvZ server afloat. If he kept it the way it is now the server would likely crash.   After the Patron only test time everyone will be able to have these nice things that Rob has told us about. Hopefully everyone will be able to have their own titles but I do not know how that system works.  Hope you could at least understand most of this a little bit easier than the English replies you have received.  .  .  .  . French because I screwed up the Google Translate  Cela est d'utiliser Google Translate donc certaines choses peuvent être un peu perdu dans la traduction. Rob fait le serveur de Super Jimmy seulement pour juste un peu de temps. Cela vise à limiter le trafic à travers le serveur parce que Rob sait que le serveur actuel ne peut pas gérer la quantité de nouveaux joueurs qu'il attend viendra durant l'été. Ceci est, espérons seulement va être deux semaines de tester différentes choses, mais alors le serveur sera libre de jouer à nouveau. Cela est d'autant un effort pour garder le serveur DvZ flot. Si il l'a gardé la façon dont il est maintenant le serveur serait probablement planter.  Après le Patron seul test de temps tout le monde sera en mesure d'avoir ces belles choses que Rob nous a parlé. Espérons que tout le monde sera en mesure d'avoir leurs propres titres, mais je ne sais pas comment ce système fonctionne.  Espérons que vous pourriez au moins comprendre la plupart de cette un peu plus facile que l'anglais répond que vous avez reçu.  .  .  .  . German  Dies geschieht mit Google Translate so manche Dinge kann ein wenig in der Übersetzung verloren sein. Rob macht die Super-Server Jimmy nur für nur eine kurze Zeit. Dies ist für den Verkehr über den Server zu begrenzen, weil Rob weiß, dass der aktuelle Server kann nicht die Menge von neuen Spielern, die er erwartet, wird im Sommer kommen zu behandeln. Dies wird hoffentlich nur gehen, um zwei Wochen testen verschiedene Dinge sein, aber dann wird der Server frei, wieder zu spielen geworden. Das alles ist ein Versuch, die DVZ-Server über Wasser zu halten. Wenn er hielt es so, wie es jetzt ist der Server wahrscheinlich abstürzen würde.  Nach dem Patron nur Testzeit jeder in der Lage, diese schönen Dinge, die Rob hat uns erzählt haben. Hoffentlich jeder in der Lage, ihre eigenen Titel haben, aber ich weiß nicht, wie das System funktioniert.  Hoffnung konnten zumindest die meisten verstehen ein bisschen leichter als die Engländer, antwortet sie erhalten haben."

You have to take many weeks to months for a quality map. People notice if you didn't take much time to build on a map so don't be surprised if people don't like your map."
DvZ,35w0te,Aragoth_,1 point,Thu May 14 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"Aye. I'm a tad guilty of doing the same thing, but in our case, we worked for several months on Grove and were excited to get things in. The community didn't have too many things they hated about it until we had the map finally tested, and even then, that's the time where you get to see more opinions and things to change."
DvZ,35w0te,MasterOfSpasms,12,Thu May 14 22:06:13 2015 UTC,That was unnecessary :/
DvZ,35w0te,Endergrill,5,Thu May 14 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We want to encourage as many people to make maps as possible, so we have more variety in game. Everyone starts out enthusiastic and with a lot to learn, let's not quash enthusiasm while they're learning.   I can remember a much younger me thinking how awesome Mt Willakers and Erebor were, and being hyped to try and do something cool of my own.  I can remember certain people on my streams that would insistently try to get Nisovin's attention when he watched, much to everyone's annoyance. But they're older and wiser now, and valuable contributors to the community.   I guess my point is, be patient, and be happy someone is so enthusiastic about the game."
DvZ,35w0te,Darkflux,4,Thu May 14 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Haha I just did something similar actually, I was looking at the DvZ wiki to look at old maps. I saw a picture of Erebor and I couldn't believe that I used to think it was the most awesome build I had ever seen in minecraft! xD"
DvZ,35w0te,Endergrill,1 point,Thu May 14 12:01:06 2015 UTC,;-; But Erebor!
DvZ,35w0te,MillicentOak,2,Thu May 14 12:09:04 2015 UTC,But Erebor
DvZ,35w0te,Doom_BringerMC,3,Thu May 14 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"It had some problems (like terrible lag and the holes under the grass) but it was a great map in its own way. One of the few maps where nearly the whole map was defended and fought on until the dwarves had retreated to the final shrine, which had the unique feature of being more accessible via sneaky ways than through the tunnels. It was a map that demanded proper teamwork from the dwarves and in the long-gone days when that was something important in DvZ, Erebor had some really great games. Of course, the horrendous lag meant that a lot of people never got to experience those games before it was removed. (It also sucked with multi-shrine because half of the outside became irrelevant.)"
DvZ,35w0te,Tomlough,2,Thu May 14 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think the introduction of multiple shrines is probably what really did the map in. I played very few games of DVZ when it was in a state that maps only had one shrine, and as a one shrine map, Erebor was great. Fast forward a few months to the tests of Erebor with multiple shrines and the map just felt way too small."
DvZ,35w0te,figsandthings,2,Thu May 14 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Erebor had more consistently great games than any other map I've ever played on. It wouldn't work now, and it certainly had its flaws (the underground cobble and bedrock issues that other maps of its era had), but I will always miss it. While Dogekac had epic escapes from the ravine if you were unlucky enough to get blasted in, Erebor had epic retreats, for the entire front line. It's been out of the game for well over a year now, yet still nothing's matched it for that.  Edit: Hold on a moment, how many games did you play on Erebor? You're obviously stating that you agree with Nis about it, but how do you rank it against its contemporaries for how well it worked?"
DvZ,35w0te,MillicentOak,1 point,Thu May 14 19:07:11 2015 UTC,I think biggest problem in Erebor was that it had monster spawn too low and unprotected. In some of the games dwarves shot arrows inside of it. Spawnkilling all mobs.   Also there was not enough wood atleast before cutting logs mechanic changed. I dont remember if map get removed before that.  But those were just minor issues that could have been fixed. Other than that map was really nice overall. And there was some epic battles.
DvZ,35w0te,Morvereth,1 point,Fri May 15 00:29:46 2015 UTC,"Aye, I only ever played after infinite wood was added, so that was never a problem for me. I experienced one game where Jimmy was shooting mobs as they left mob spawn, from behind and to the right of it, it took a few attempts to get around and knock them down. That spawn was much better than Willy or Oasis though, both in terms of spawncamping, and in terms of getting flooded with lava."

You don't spawn with extra stuff and there's a little room under the shrine with oil and a saw. The randomly generated map thing is pretty cool, seems like a nice way to do it."

DvZ,35vxgy,Endergrill,2,Thu May 14 01:38:22 2015 UTC,Only 1 shrine. Monsters gets released next morning so you have the whole night to prepare as well.
DvZ,35vxgy,Morvereth,1 point,Thu May 14 02:03:23 2015 UTC,"only one night to build a whole keep? wow that's.... not enough time... in old games, wasn't it 2 nights, with spare items?"
DvZ,35vxgy,Doom_BringerMC,2,Thu May 14 05:44:58 2015 UTC,"I think it was 2. In the first test game we did have 2 whole days to get ready, and it felt too long.   None of the test games where monster were released at sunrise (that I have been in) have seemed like we had too little prep time.   I think it is a nice amount of time to get ready. :)"
DvZ,35vxgy,Doom_BringerMC,3,Thu May 14 06:03:45 2015 UTC,"In gym it was only one day and monsters got released at first nightfall. There was still plenty of time to build. Its amazing how much 64 dwarves can build in 10minutes, when they dont have to gather anything, like torches, armor... And normal plains game lasted atleast as long as regular map games.   Then again game was much more bow centered. In plains we never had roofs so you could use bow for entire duration of game. And bow proc was still game mechanic and pretty much everyone used it. And in plains you could bow proc even when standing on top of shrine.   Keep was not normally that fancy. It was usually just one shrine box and few straight outer walls that didint even connect anything. So monsters could just walk round them, but normally they didint bother, and there was good archers at sides."
DvZ,35vxgy,zzCratoszz,2,Thu May 14 11:35:02 2015 UTC,"It was fun the first test game, but 4 tests later and it was just not enjoyable. If it is to be in rotation I'd hope it to be at a lower chance than the other maps."
DvZ,35vxgy,Th3A1ph4D0g,1 point,Wed May 13 23:32:14 2015 UTC,I just have a hard time seeing how a BYOK map would work with how dvz works now
DvZ,35vxgy,winter477,3,Wed May 13 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"Essentially there are alterations to the standard default mechanics, like the build phase is the first day and night with mobs releasing in the morning of the second day. I believe the Shrine spawns in a plains biome specifically in a randomly generated world were instead of stone generating below ground bedrock does. The Quarry is the same every time and always spawns on the opposite side to mob spawn (some times in a very glitchy way). The room below shrine is a pain as there are no lights in it and you can't put lights in it so mobs can take the shrine from there as long as no-one procs. The world uses the minecraft world borders to limit the map size and chunk generation. But essentially how it played out was people tried to Shrinebox and each game they built it taller and taller, but since they couldn't build it to the height limit, the majority of the mob team was skeles just shooting down onto the Shrine. They were very awkward games that were kind of fun in the throwback sense but other than that not very good."

Of course saying this it isnt a huge problem but I definately dont want to play plains games with a low chance of it being a fun game IMO"

DvZ,35s0cg,keaganwill,2,Wed May 13 00:54:24 2015 UTC,I would recommend adding in background to the back of the map such as hills or mountains
DvZ,35s0cg,Tundra1232,2,Wed May 13 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"Much to worldedity, add texture and variation. Smooth=easy=/=look good"
DvZ,35s0cg,LittleBlast5,2,Wed May 13 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"Like Keagan and Tundra said. The unnatural stuff (fortifications, interior, etc.) Look amazing but the natural  stuff seems a bit lacking  (I have this problem too, one of the reasons I've avoided trying DvZ maps). This map looks like it could be amazing with  a little work on the natural details."
DvZ,35s0cg,firebolt8900,1 point,Wed May 13 01:05:21 2015 UTC,"That quarry seems pretty small, imagine 50 people digging there, the gravel would run out fast."
DvZ,35s0cg,Juliandroid98,1 point,Wed May 13 07:14:54 2015 UTC,"Remember more detail makes the map look better, for example adding more details to the shrine room and making it a bit bigger in some way will make it look better (if your going for a small shrine room then just add details to anything from the flooring to the roof) also make the cliff side with the 2 bridges a bit more natural also I recomend adding a long side path for monsters to go through like in dogecak"
DvZ,35qd7z,Awesomeshafter,35,Tue May 12 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"Really? You get to be an awesome overpowered hero, complete with your own special set of items that others don't have, and you complain about not getting your paladin sword? You can play with your paladin sword the next game, man. Play with your hero items."
DvZ,35qd7z,nisovin,1 point,Tue May 12 21:15:12 2015 UTC,"I am not even a super jimmy, just an idea  Edit: some people who are gravediggers might want tomb makers instead of switching to shovels and such. I personally just don't dual wield much when I do its a sword."
DvZ,35qd7z,nisovin,20,Tue May 12 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"Just remember that DvZ is a role playing game. If you are Bruce Willakers, then you aren't a paladin or ranger or gravedigger for that game. Bruce carries Excaliju and Virendra, not a holy blade or tomb maker."
DvZ,35qd7z,Axxmin,1 point,Wed May 13 00:26:05 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention that it does change my opinion. While I see his point, roll playing is more important."
DvZ,35qd7z,xavierisapro,1 point,Wed May 13 01:16:00 2015 UTC,roll playing....roll down the wall?
DvZ,35qd7z,Tomlough,-1,Thu May 14 06:26:55 2015 UTC,True but what about when the acients get an item? Bruce is old.
DvZ,35qd7z,Wiesenwachtel,2,Wed May 13 00:34:12 2015 UTC,"Ancient item will be a walking stick. While your own character isn't established in the DvZ lore, Bruce is, and he doesn't walk with a stick. So that's not going to be an issue."
DvZ,35qd7z,Endergrill,0,Wed May 13 13:30:29 2015 UTC,But who says Bruce doesn't have a spare walking stick? Just in case.
DvZ,35qd7z,Alderdash,1 point,Wed May 13 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"that would make it even more ""pay to fun"""
DvZ,35qd7z,Girafferider133,5,Wed May 13 09:45:24 2015 UTC,How is DvZ 'pay to win'?
DvZ,35qd7z,Axxmin,2,Wed May 13 10:37:31 2015 UTC,I can only assume that everyone is contributing to the monster side...
DvZ,35qd7z,Endergrill,1 point,Wed May 13 12:51:57 2015 UTC,"If you're not a super Jimmy, why do you even care..?"
DvZ,35qd7z,Axxmin,3,Tue May 12 23:57:14 2015 UTC,For others.
DvZ,35qd7z,TheEpitomE8,-1,Tue May 12 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"While I do see your point, and i'm not trying to contradict you, I think he means he wants variation. As in, maybe he's playing nisovin but really likes using his holy blade? Or he's playing roamin but roamin doesn't get a special bow, and he wants a ronger bow. I agree. While I don't have super jimmy, I would want a ronger bow as roamin for example. Bruce is not a good example, because his items are automatically better and who would want a holy blade over an excaliju. It's an aesthetic thing as I said bellow, and I absolutely love the way the holy blade looks. I think his point just may not have been very clear.  EDIT: Awesomeshafter also has had a tough time with the community, and hasn't been too obnoxious from playing with him, so while his point wan't clear, cut him some slack. Being told down by a respected dev is very embarrassing and very morally crushing. I haven't had that experience but I know what it would feel like :)"
DvZ,35qd7z,figsandthings,5,Tue May 12 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"I absolutely understand the attachment people sometimes feel towards their special items. I used to leave every game I would accidentally drop my longbow if Jimmy didn't give it back to me. But you're a hero with all these fancy things! Having to use a runeblade as Bruce wouldn't kill you, not having a longbow as Roamin wont kill you either. And as Nisovin why would you want anything else? The wand is amazing!    I think he means he wants variation.    After having played 10 games as a ranger with a longbow, how would becoming Roamin with a longbow be variation? As a Super Jimmy you get 3 titles to choose between, you can change it every game if you'd like to change it up. And if people want the Holy Blade for the texture, I recommend trying to play with your own texture pack. I do, and because of that I love my runeblade whilst the Holy blade looks silly. :)"
DvZ,35qd7z,TheEpitomE8,1 point,Tue May 12 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"You have a valid point as well. I'm just trying to clarify his post (not sayin it's unclear) so people don't misunderstand his point. I personally don't have a special item, but I get wanting one would feel like."

DvZ,35qd7z,comkreaperkiller,0,Tue May 12 23:46:33 2015 UTC,Wow so many unlikes for support to someone and stating someone's opinion. Just wow.
DvZ,35qd7z,comkreaperkiller,8,Wed May 13 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Seems useless to me in my opinion. What if you are a Ranger and you become Bruce? Do you still want to switch between the Longbow and Virendra? No, you obviously want to use Virendra for the double damage and knockback."
DvZ,35qd7z,Juliandroid98,2,Tue May 12 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"Not everyone likes to use Virendra as their primary ranged weapon! Personally I find the knockback annoying and only really use it to one-shot wolves. With that being said, I don't really switch bows as Bruce, I just don't use Virendra as often as I might otherwise.  Regardless, title items are cosmetic only, end you get nothing more out of them than you would the normal items they replace, so its just as easy to use those items."
DvZ,35qd7z,figsandthings,-1,Tue May 12 22:28:11 2015 UTC,"Who uses ranger? I honestly think that making your a weapon only shiny and doesn't look better is not as good as having a different looking tool, also there are like 2 rangers per game."
DvZ,35qd7z,Wiesenwachtel,14,Tue May 12 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of people who like going Ranger, but I feel like the amount of people who choose Ranger over the other titles doesn't take away from the fact that using the Longbow as Bruce is simply a downgrade.  I honestly feel like title items as hero aren't especially needed. Most people are already happy enough to be a hero in the first place, that they already enjoy using the hero items anyway, so they probably won't have the additional desire to have the Title items as well."
DvZ,35qd7z,keaganwill,8,Tue May 12 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"Just because Minecraft is limited to 1 bow doesn't mean that being a ranger is bad.  There are people who enjoy bowshooting a lot, so they become a ranger."
DvZ,35qd7z,Axxmin,2,Tue May 12 19:32:20 2015 UTC,And there are too many paladins.
DvZ,35qd7z,Juliandroid98,-1,Tue May 12 18:11:57 2015 UTC,Never.
DvZ,35qd7z,Axxmin,2,Wed May 13 12:11:57 2015 UTC,Yes there is. It's the reason I use the Ranger title now.
