The container can be used as the shell of a forge or furnace (depending on the size of course).  It is extremely dangerous to cut into an ""empty"" propane tank, though, as it could have a detonable fuel-air mixture inside.  You should fill it with water before any cutting to make absolutely sure all fuel gas is removed.  One thing propane is not great for is gas welding - too much hydrogen in the flame.  That is why acetylene is preferred, besides the higher energy density."

metalworking,3e2t7i,ColinDavies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"To fill with water, unscrew the valve stem.  Could be difficult.  You can look up burner designs online that use mostly common plumbing parts.  Insulation is usually some combination of soft fire brick and ceramic wool.  For a forge or furnace you just need the propane, while for a torch you may wish to use oxygen to increase the flame temperature (you need to buy a torch, hose, regulators, etc. specifically designed for this use).  Forge, furnace, and torch all do different things, so comparing affordability is maybe not so meaningful... What you choose depends on what you want to so with it."

I figured out that it worked a little better if the oil was under some pressure, so I rigged up an old propane tank with a schrader valve and a ball valve I could open to pour in the oil, plus a little pressure gauge, and another valve to regulate oil flow to the heater. I would hang it up upside down from a rafter, put a little air pressure to it and open the other valve to feed the oil burner heater. The thing would run you out of my old shop even if it was 5 degrees outside and there was 2 foot of snow on the ground. It also gave me a great use for all the used oil I ended up with from my old Powerstroke. I think I even have a picture of that old thing somewhere...  I had to stop using it, though, because it was temperamental. You had to keep a constant eye on it to keep it from running away. It ran away on me one day and was running like a jet engine. 2 dry element fire extinguishers would not put it out.

metalworking,3dwscc,Nihlton,10,Mon Jul 20 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"Unless you're talking about a different process to the one I know by the name 'precipitation hardening', then you can't harden 304 stainless that way.  The precipitation hardening grades are 630 through 635.  It relies on the addition of copper, molybdenum, aluminium and/or titanium - and 304 doesn't have any of those in it.  304 is an austentitic grade steel - case hardening is not an option, as the cementite formation relies on the ferritic phase.  (In principle one can try to shove in enough carbon to get iron carbides in the austenite phase - but that's a huge amount of carbon to even try that 1-2 % of carbon, which is well past sensible.  Also, no idea if the lebedurite + cementite phases would do what you want - it's well outside conventional).  I'm afraid that if you need a tougher part in stainless, you should look at remaking it in 403 stainless, which is harder and tougher purely by being a ferritic steel, or use a non-stainless hardening steel, and protect it.  Precipitation hardening steels are complex beasts, and if you want to go down that road, you should expect a few failures before you get it to work.  Note that case hardening doesn't really improve the overall strength of a part - just the surface.  It's good for abrasion and wear resistance, but it's not normally going to make a major difference for the sort of use case your describing.  Do you have evidence that 304 won't be good enough for that part?  Given that you say it's cosmetic, it might be reasonable to just try it - the alternatives are costly in either time or materials, and if it works, there's no problem."

metalworking,3dvheg,LordGarak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"Would I be able to build one from a drill press? I have an old one laying around that I don't really use. Then I just need the table and something to precisely measure when I'm at zero, and how deep I'm cutting."
metalworking,3dvheg,allaroundguy,6,Sun Jul 19 23:14:31 2015 UTC,"I used a drill press as a mill for a short period of time with an X Y table when I had nothing else. Didn't take long to ruin the bearings. Not only are the bearings not up to the task, the quill has a bit of flex to it.  A milling machine has to be very rigid otherwise the cutter is forced away from the work causing very short life. If you are determined to make one, look into the gingery series of books, and look into concrete machines."
metalworking,3dvheg,sheriffSnoosel,4,Mon Jul 20 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"One problem with using a drill press as a mill is that the spindle bearings are not able to handle those x-y forces. With that said, I hear you can replace those bearings with something that can handle the radial loads."
metalworking,3dvheg,EvanDaniel,5,Sun Jul 19 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Is your goal to use a mill, or to make a mill? Pick one. If the former, buy something. If you really want to do both, then buy something and also make one. Before you talk about building it to save money, know that you'll get a better mill cheaper by buying one, even if you don't count your time as having any value at all.  That said... Go out and get a copy of the first few Gingery books. Or if you just want to feel for it, get book 2 (the Lathe book). They're really good reading, whether you end up building anything from them or not.  If you want something slightly less daunting, but still useful, consider making yourself a surface plate or height gauge stand or similar. Just a flat reference surface.

Was ok for aluminum but steel vibrated it like crazy. Even little vibrations love to destroy your tooling, and extremely hard cutting tools love to explode. A big machine with lots of weight is a must. Quill bearings are a completely different animal than anything like a drill press. This is where the secrets of the machine lie.

Getting amped is likely to make you get crazy person style experimental and that's not gonna help.   Unless you have a landlord that enjoys hurting people its going to be at worst a financial hit not a steel pipe hit. So deep breath and chill out. When I had a rental building my tenants fucked all sorts of things up to hideous extent and its part of the job of being a landlord. Talking shoe on head stupid levels of break stuff and I never got to kill any of them.   The Clit BANG!!! stuff you used is apparently an Easy-off brand monstrosity so the first thing you want to start searching for is things like easy-off and stainless. No idea on what a Bang!!!!!1 level product BANGS!!!!!!! but its most likely the same shit as old Easy-off with a different smell so the solution to your problem is likely to be the same as with other easy-off products that don't BANGGGG!!!!!! the fuck out of baked on grime!!!!!  I just did a quick search and it turns out easy off eats stainless quite a lot. Found a  few angry letters to the ether about the issue and some ideas to try to fix it. I'm zonked and out of steam or I would do some digging but this is not a rare issue.   So my suggestion would be to chug some wine and or beer and go do some google-fu and search and collect things to try.   Unless you are moving out this week take your time and approach this with some caution so you don't make it worse. And if worst comes to worst hit the mark you made with a sledgehammer spray paint all the windows red and tell your land lord your apartment was attacked by fanatical anti stove activists and move to another country.

(photos would help)   What is the surface geometry, is everything affected flat, or are there depressions that you need to work on as well?  If it was a brushed finish, and isn't pitted, I'd start with some 200 grit sandpaper wrapped around a sponge, put some music on, and go to work, trying to stay parallel with the original surface finish.   If it was a mirror finish, and isn't pitted, you may want to start with a higher grit, so you don't put in scratch marks you'll have to take out later.   If it's really bad, you may need to start with a lower(rougher) grit, and work your way up.   I don't recommend using power tools for the sanding, as it takes some experience to get a good finish that way, it just takes time and care to get a good finish by hand."

Most cast iron isn't really hard unless it is white cast iron. If the hole is over 3/16"", pre-drill it with a small bit first. It might be a good idea to use some cutting oil to."
metalworking,3dffqp,jhwilly,5,Wed Jul 15 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"Your biggest thing when drilling metals is to have lots of cutting fluid and to get your speed right. A mill makes it easy - a drill press is ok - a handheld drill can make it a lot harder. From machinery's handbook 12th ed, cutting speed is 13 feet per minute with uncoated or coated carbide, and as follows for high speed steel drill bits depending upon the type of cast iron:   ferritic - brinell hardness 140-190: 100fpm ferritic-pearlitic - brinell hardness 190-260: 65-80fpm pearlitic-martensitic - brinell hardness 240-300: 45fpm martensitic (270-400): 15 fpm   Use the equation N=(12V)/(pi*D) where   V is your speed D is the diameter of your drill bit (in decimal inches) N is the speed in rpm to run the bit   to determine the running speed. For example, for a 1/2"" bit in a middle-of-the road condition with high speed steel, say 60fpm, your speed should be 458rpm.  Set it to that and see if it's working. If you get short, blue chips, its too fast, and if you get really long chips that don't break, you're going too slow."

metalworking,3dffqp,locopingvin,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:48 2015 UTC,"Sometimes there will be some sort of stamped material type, but cast iron is usually cast (imagine that), so someone would have to go out of their way to actually include the stamp in the mold, which isn't going to happen.  There's really no good way to test it at home. In a lab, you can do either brinell or rockwell testing to determine the hardness of the metal, which will tell you more about it. Depending upon the carbon content and the processing method, you'll get a high presence of martensite which is very strong, but also very brittle. Steel (which is just low carbon cast iron) is unique in that it can exist in a lot of different crystal structures, giving it different strengths based upon additives and quenching method, temp, etc. Here's a chart that's shows them, just in case you're curious: http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/96ClassProj/examples/kimcon.html  Hand drilling is going to be tough - the biggest thing to do will be to apply firm direct downward pressure and watch the chip size and color and adjust accordingly."

Out of curiosity, what difference does the 118 degree vs. 135 degree do?  When I was 3/5 through the casting on the first hole, I tried several drill bits. Some, although cheap, broke because I pushed too hard. I tried another bit from another cheap Bosch set laying around, also HSS, and it got through beatifully making small squareish shavings, and I was like ""YEESS FINALLY!!"", but when I tried it on a second hole it was just as effective as the others (making metal dust). Did I just hit a soft spot in the casting?  I just started the second hole and got like 1 milimeter deep in 10 minutes. I stopped too cool myself down, too frustrating. I'd avoid annealing the surface at all costs because the surface is finnished with paint. Is the tungstein carbide bit really expensive or just kinda?

Also, don't listen to the naysayers, pilot your hole at 3mm and blast through with the 10mm at full speed, you'll be fine. I've hand drilled too much cast iron in the past to give a flying one about speeds and feeds like the other crotchety guys."
metalworking,3dffqp,verdatum,2,Thu Jul 16 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"Question - what is the thickness of the material you need to drill?  If your thickness is under about 10mm  and you can tolerate a part diameter step in the hole, I highly recommend the use of a good step drill bit for hand drilling.  Hand drilling through 9mm steel, a hole that takes me about 40 minutes with a good quality twist drill set (cobalt, generally best material for hard metals) I can do in closer to 10 with a step drill.  That's generally unlubricated and vertical overhead, where I can't use a fluid for cooling, so frequent tool cooling (and arm recovery) breaks are required.  This would be a good quality metric step bit to use.  At 10mm, if your bolt is in shear and only supporting a kN or so of force per bolt, having the outside half of the hole 2mm oversize will make essentially no difference.  As you get to the larger sizes particularly, your cutting speed should be very low.  Probably 200-250rpm tops.  Your pressure on the bit as you get upwards of 6mm or so should pretty much be the maximum you can exert by hand.  Most metals usually drill best with high feed pressure, low speed, and a lot of care to keep the bit cool.  At 12mm I can't actually exert enough force by hand, even upside down with my shoulders wedged against the ground and full force from both arms, to provide the feed force my bit really needs.  Is this a wood lathe or small metal lathe, and what is its mass?  Have you considered the possibility that it would be much easier and more time efficient to simply rest the legs within a properly designed frame that has the wheels mounted?  You could bolt together a frame from L75x75x5mm steel angle that would drill easier (on the bench no less), do the same job, and pretty much eliminate drilling your cast base.  That size angle would most likely support almost any wood lathe and some lighter metal lathes."
metalworking,3dffqp,MrBlaaaaah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:28:45 2015 UTC,"The thicknesss of the casting I'm trying to drill through is 10-12mm. It's varying throughout the casting.  The lathe is a wood lathe, but built like a metal lathe. I think it weighs around 400kg, but that's just an estimate.  I can take a picture. The mobile base, made out of 2x4, will be mounted with 6 bolts.  The thing is, when I pug irregular logs (up to 60cm in diameter), and start the lathe, it's going to vibrate like hell. That's why I've put it on industrial rubber feet. When I want to move it, I want to have wheels on it, so I'm making something similar like this: http://woodgears.ca/mobile_base/sibley.html"

metalworking,3dffqp,PilotKnob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean.  What I was describing is a bit similar to this heavy skate, which is set up for much heavier machines.  Between moves it can be jacked with a bar and block and set on rubber pads or wood blocking.  The guy's commentary on that design was that it only raised his tool height by 22mm - that's the advantage of the angles over a wood skate.  That design is welded, but you could accomplish the same with bolted joints.  For a machine that light, a pair of 6mm low-grade bolts at each corner is sufficient to hold the weight if the skate is sufficiently stiff, so you'd be drilling much, much smaller holes, and in mild steel which is easier to drill.  Meanwhile, with that skate design the machine itself is intended to rest on the horizontal leg, enclosed by the vertical legs.  No bolts to the machine are required, and for a non-welded assembly you only need four four bolts total per corner to replace that joint.  Since angles can be done on a drill press, you could use your press to do all your drilling (which makes it trivial) if you had time to complete it first."
metalworking,3dffqp,IrideTheDirt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:25 2015 UTC,Hmm.. You might sway me over to actually do this. My neighbour has a L angle steel next to his garage collecting rust. It's a leftover from his building project. I can ask him if I can have it. I guess I can use a pallet truck in the meanwhile I finish the drill press.   I edited in the pictures in the comment above.
metalworking,3dffqp,IrideTheDirt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"That's a darn good looking lathe.  Nice find.  If you end up going the steel angle route, the easiest way to do that corner connection is probably to make clip angles (pictured) using bits of the same angle.  Two 6mm bolts into each piece joined should be sufficient, as long as they bolts are fairly well spaced apart from each other.  I would definitely still consider using the step drill either way, it will make your life easier even in the drill press.  I've got a press and full assortment of good bits, and still usually turn to my step bit first for holes through steel under 10mm.  Feel free to message if you decide to go that path and run into questions.  If I've tempted you into playing with steel, the least I can do is offer a little help, right?"

Thanks a lot for offer, this community is really nice :)My neighbour is on vacation so I can't ask him for the angle steel, but I can see myself making same bases for my other machines as well, so I might as well go out and buy a few lengths. My friend knows a place, and if I refer to him I get discount.  Yeah, the lathe is pretty nice. I searched Finn.no (Norways response to craigslist) day and night for lathes. Every lathe that came up for sale was thin sheet-metal lathes. Finally this came up. Cost me 200bucks, which for Norway is pretty cheap. Also it had a ton of accesories and cutters. I painted some parts because all the paint was gone and there were some rust. It has 3 mechanical speeds, but my bro is an automatician and a friend is an electrician, so they're helping me mount a VFD to further dial in the speed on the motor.  The only downer is that I can only turn max 90cm. Perhaps I'll make an extensionwing on it if I need to turn larger pieces."

Are you starting with a very small hole and stepping up slowly to the final hole size? (You should).  Finally, the reason to use cutting fluid is simply to prevent the bit from losing the temper, as well as preventing the metal from becoming even harder as a result of being heat cycled by the friction.  Use a drill press, turn the bit slowly, use moderate/heavy pressure and start with a very small hole.  Good luck."

Basically it impulses the RPM up and down. I tried drilling with that setting on, and while it helped, it didn't do much either.

That's something that needs to be done properly, with some engineering, or you will end up having half your bike rack fall off in the road and possibly really hurting someone. Also, lots of bike racks and similar items are pretty precisely engineered from the start to use the minimum thickness of steel, and any modification has the potential to compromise the whole structure, so put some thought into just how badly you actually need to modify this thing, any chance you can leave it as is?"

Thanks for your input."
metalworking,3de73t,spastacus,2,Thu Jul 16 12:57:52 2015 UTC,"Well then to answer your noob questions...  When you are ready to cut it use a hacksaw not a dremel. The cutting wheels have a natural tendency to make you hate everything about them especially on coated metal tubing. Certain abrasive Dremel discs also have a habit of exploding sometimes which is nice...  You will want to make sure you have solid perpendicular guide lines to cut by. On a dark surface I use blue painters tape and a sharpie. In order to make the line I use a single strand of stiff wire that I tighten enough to double check it then crank it on, draw my line and take the wire back off. That way you get a solid straight line instead of trying to eyeball it or try to use string which walks all over. Layout both sides at once and double check it before cutting. If there is an error its easier to rip of tape and start over than the alternatives.   Clamp it to a solid surface and be cautious that you can crush a tube very easily so it may take some creativity to get it to stay solid. I really like my Irwin squeezy type speed clamps and cheapo bar clamps and use them a lot so if you are eyeballing clamps or a decent vise to add to your tool kit this is a fair excuse.   A good hacksaw frame will last past the apocalypse so buy the right one once. Make sure you have the right type of blade and allow the saw to do the work. You make a few back strokes to begin your cut then its like long breaths not panting. It will be boring and take a while and your arms and shoulders will hate you. Check to see that you are still on course periodically.  When you are done de-burr it with a small mill file and touch it up with at least primer to inhibit rust.    Keep close track of your mess. Tiny metal slivers are hell on tiny feet. They can give you or your wife a shitty sore spot but they will give a toddler a very hard time so be circumspect with any metal work that you might track back into the house  My suggestion would be to chop off position three first. It gives you a practice run and since a two year old becomes a three year old in about a week and a half long year and a four year old a long month after that and you may want to add a kid seat to the mom bike(not to imply that minds will change but it might be worth leaving some capacity for that possibility). If in time that's not gonna happen you can chop it down again but a two bike carrier may be better for long term usage especially if you are going to keep up with trends and wishes that are dictated by toddlers."
metalworking,3de73t,spastacus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:50:48 2015 UTC,"Wow. That was both very entertaining and informative, thank you!...I especially like the part about the Dremel being a POS (first disc I put on it broke before I even started! (different project))...but also appreciate the forethought about cutting it down to a 2 bike rack first, both for practice and the possibility of stopping there if I should change my mind for any reason. You seemed pretty adamant about a good hacksaw frame...Any particular recommendations for it or the actual blade for that matter?...as far as the dangers of the shavings, shouldn't I just do it outside?! Thanks again!"
metalworking,3de73t,fightdad,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:50 2015 UTC,Not so much any specific brand of hacksaw but if you go to a home despot or lows or even a local place there will be a seven dollar hacksaw and a two dollar one. Buy the better one. The cheap ones tend to have shit hardware and poor quality control so its one of those tools you will end up with a shitty one for years on end or a good one for years on end and its usually only a few bucks difference. The same rule applies to caulking guns too. A few extra bucks buys a better working tool and you will not save anything by working harder to make a shit tool function like it should.  As for metal shavings; outside is fine but understand steel shavings are gonna rust if it rains on it so give your clean up an extra bit of effort so you don't end up with orangey stains on things.   My main point about shavings was more about what will stick to your shoes or hide in the hem of your pants and so on. Its very easy to pick up slivers and/or dust yourself off in the wrong place without thinking about it and all it takes is one gnarly little sharp bit in a soft toe to make a baby yell like hell is upon them. The same effect can happen to anyone barefoot but stomping baby feet or crawling knees and hands are bad for picking up tiny sharp crap.   So yeah work wherever but just try to keep track of where the debris ends up is all. When you have a little little kid in the mix how much you bring into the house sort of becomes an extra level of safety glasses type awareness that you should put onto your checklist.
metalworking,3de73t,fightdad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:04:09 2015 UTC,Yea easy. Just cut off the excess pipe. Then take a punch or something that you can smack inside the tube you just cut off to spread it open a bit. Go like 3 or 4 inches deep. Then drill a hole in it and then in the pipe that I'd still attached to the rest of bike rack so when you want to use it you can slide it over the bar on the car and just bolt it down.

I understand your piece about drilling holes, but how would the excess fit over the existing pipe for that? And wouldn't that bring the bikes too close together on the rack if I'm understand your suggestion at all?"
metalworking,3de73t,fightdad,2,Thu Jul 16 10:34:42 2015 UTC,"Ya I was drunk last night, but ya you need to spread the pipe open by hammering another peice of metal down it to make it wider something round and pointed like a spike. You shouldn't need to be to scientific about it. As for bringing the bikes closer together you need to check that and see how much clearance you have.   Option 2 get a peice of metal from the hardware store made of steel that fits over the pipe and have a hole on each end and a hole in each pipe and connect them via bolts. I'll draw some pics."
metalworking,3de73t,fightdad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:01 2015 UTC,Lol@drunk comment!...Pipe over with holes and nuts and bolts sounds better than hammering an end down. Plus having another piece takes away the issue of the bikes getting too close together. Good idea!

If so, I have a couple of ideas...  One is that your fillet radius has to be different for the corners on the inside of the tee and the outside of the tee -- in fact, different by exactly the thickness of the part.  Or, if your CAD package supports it, you could design the tee as a surface body, with the appropriate fillets as necessary, and then convert that into a solid by thickening the surface body."

Because Zinc Alloy is much more reactive it will tend to react fast and foam slightly. Also on bare surfaces aluminum will rub black onto your fingers.

I work almost exclusively in copper at this point and I can tell you with great sincerity that when you work with heat on copper the copper automatically sticks up its middle finger at you then starts laughing. The skill lies in knowing how to stick up your middle finger back at it   Because its such a marvelous conductor of heat you can easily spread the heat from your repair section into a cascade of swearing and throwing things while the solder goes fluid an inch away from your intended repair ad infinitum. Chasing a solder seam around sucks especially if you are trying to make it look nice   A couple of the issues you are going to find with repairing a piece like that.    The way that is formed will likely have caused the copper to be work hardened in weird ways especially at the edges. Which means it may not behave uniformly when you attempt your dent repairs. Just be ready for it to act funny and expect it to take you a long time of gentle tippy tappy.   I wouldn't use a soldering iron. I'm biased since I hate using irons on repairs and fine work or anything else for that matter. My go to is a Smith brand silversmith torch with either #0 #1 tips. This is not a cheap option if you don't already have one but a small tip allows you to essentially brush the area with heat instead of just area heat. Liquid flux like Tix or similar so you can brush it on to the area with a small brush. And use the lowest temp solder you can get so you are limiting the amount of time with heat. Its a tiny amount to repair so minimize your requirements as best you can   Honestly though I wouldn't work on it like that at all. I would put the work into replacing the center post, sand out the cracked portion with an emery board and use some carefully applied epoxy for copper to stop any further splitting. Unless this is getting put on display at face level a repair like that will not be seen from the ground.   The denting and dings are  perfectly acceptable for architectural aging and as the patina increases it will add more texture. The only thing I would say is be very cautious with any epoxy on the outer surfaces since it will halt the patina and you'll get weird inconsistencies in the color around your repair.   If this needs to be perfect for what ever reason I would suggest purchasing a new one. A direct replacement of that is available from amazon or home despot for 200 bucks since its going to cost you more than that to get it back to looking like new."

metalworking,3cw61p,dsr0057,2,Sat Jul 11 14:07:30 2015 UTC,Excellent advice! This is absolutely the only way to do this repair although I would say maybe look at the Smith #00 tip. It's much finer and allows better heat control which is always the name of the game. I use it primarily when doing soft solder jobs on delicate area (I repair band instruments).

An alternative option you have is to use phos-copper to repair the seam. The intended application of phos-copper is for soldering heating and air conditioning units, but it has properties that make it appealing for working with large-scale copper pieces.   Pros-  1. it's fairly cheap 2. if used correctly it can be used to fill a gap (obviously small gaps are easier to fill than bigger ones)  Cons- 1. It can be hard to control, and tends to run 2. It's extremely hard, making cleaning up the seam slightly challenging.   If you plan on fixing this piece and using it as a functioning weather vain, using phos-copper would be a good option: the repair is going to be pretty hard to see, and if you use the phos-copper correctly you might be able to fill the gap without having to repair the dents. However, if you plan on displaying the piece anywhere besides a rooftop it's going to be under a lot more scrutiny, and the imperfections (the dents and the solder seam) are going to be more apparent, so you'll really need to work those out.   I hope this helps. If you have any other questions about the phos-copper, or want a more in-depth explanation on the process let me know, I'm happy to go into more detail!"

If your bandsaw has low speeds available, those might work, but check your blade speed in ft/minute.

Getting up to around 2000 will start to make aluminum shiny, but you'll need a buffing wheel with polish if you want to get a mirror shine.  Depending on your stock material, I'd start at nothing lower than 320 grit if you're just trying to change the sheen.

I've never done die casting, but I tend to pay attention to parting lines on parts I work with...  You might also consider a 3-part mold, where the two outer halves meet at a parting line that lies parallel to the long axis of the part, and the plug makes the internal geometry.  If you're doing a 2-part mold, I'd have the parting line follow the edge of the part, not cut across the middle. As drawn, you end up with a really deep cavity in the mold on the left side. That seems like asking for trouble, both in machining and when trying to eject the part."

metalworking,3clk9g,germ22,2,Thu Jul 9 07:28:08 2015 UTC,The thickness is 20mm bisaloy 80.   The practicalities is consistency and time. The CNC only controls the height of the rollers. I have to control the backwards and forwards motion and check it with the template. Having the capabilities to know that the rollers are at the same height all the time makes it really easy. I roll one plate to find out all the heights then write them down/input them into the computer. Next time I roll that same plate all I have to worry about is the backwards and forwards motion which is easy.   I hope this clears it up :)

We have to roll in 3 parts and join because the bucket is too large. The skin itself is 6.2m wide and our rollers are only 3.6m wide. We could do the skin in two halves but that would mean that the hookups would be on two separate plates which would put stress on the weld and eventually break.   Hope this clears it up! :)

Rebar composition varies significantly but it will be heat-hardenable medium or high carbon steel so it's very possible you're using stakes made of glass.  Scrub some areas clean with sand paper in each one and use a torch to get them hot enough to turn blue. If they glow, start again! Blue will temper them back quite a bit but leave a little more strength than annealed, which is way too much work anyhow.  Not sure if you'll practically have issues but tbh I'd expect them to be very hard right now. Tempting fate. Likely an issue if you drop them on concrete or drive over them by mistake..."
metalworking,3ce9tq,DeleteFromUsers,3,Tue Jul 7 14:39:23 2015 UTC,Thank you VERY much. This is the kind of post I'm looking for.
metalworking,3ce9tq,johansense1,3,Tue Jul 7 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"Probably isn't much technical knowledge because it's not necessary to change the microstructure of the steel because the impact will be to the angle iron from a rock, shoe, hammer, mallet, etc. The worst thing that could possibly happen to the rebar is hitting a rock or something after being hammered or pushed into the ground, which would probably be very low in stress, relatively speaking. Most tent stakes that come with the tent are like 1/8"" and you can buy maybe 1/4"" and those have lasted fine enough to this point to still be used.   Tldr: tent stakes do not need a heat treatment. OP's post is irrelevant.   Edit: not to mention, it would be much cheaper in time and money to just make another tent stake then it would be to heat up steel and hold it for a treatment (assuming this is DIY and OP hasn't invested several hundred dollars in a furnace) if one did happen to break."
metalworking,3ce9tq,curly686,2,Tue Jul 7 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"OK well, I've built striking tools (I'm actually a die maker). It's not exactly uncommon for someone to use the back of a hatchet or an old claw hammer to put a stake in the ground while camping. Indeed a rock would be even more brutal. And I have had those striking tools explode because I didn't properly temper them.  I'm certainly not saying it's guaranteed to fail. Not at all. But I am saying that if you're out in the middle of nowhere setting up a large tent, maybe it's worthwhile to take 10min with a torch and temper your stakes. It's very possible, and likely, that they're super hard right now, and I't very possible, and likely, that whacking the stake with a steel hammer into a rock in the ground by mistake could cause a failure.  YMMV.   *Edit Really if you're concerned, stop talking and hit the damn things. Wear bloody eye protection, but see what happens. If it doesn't explode, no problem. If it does, temper the rest of them. I don't see why it's worthwhile to take a chance here. I've welded hardenable steels fairly extensively, and they can have odd characteristics if you don't treat them with some respect. But hey, I'm just some guy on the internet...."

Due to being rebar, I was looking for facts to support the extra work or not based of the fact that pot metals like this aren't consistent. I can only assume this is accurate since even mild steel can be very hard in some spots and soft on the same.piece of steel.   There will be no rocks where these are used but I'm going to anneal them anyway because I want them to last for years.  Now I have some reading to do on annealing~"
metalworking,3ce9tq,fireproofsalamander,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"""Annealing"" is a pain in the ass, usually requiring that the parts be brought above the lower austinizing temperature (i.e. glowing cherry red) and then very slowly cooled over many hours. You don't need this level of softness. You probably don't want it either has it provides the least strength.  You want tempering, which you can do with a torch in a couple of minutes. Tempering reduces the hardness while increasing toughness so that you don't have cracking issues. Look for steel color temper charts on google. Blue is pretty soft and you shouldn't see any failures."

If you have access to scrap already, or a steel yard to raid the remnants, even better. To prep dirty metal, you can use a wire brush, or a wire wheel on a grinder.

Secondly, welding steel is more common and can be done (several ways) by most any shop. If you want welded tube steel is probably the way to go.  Aluminum is adequately strong, lighter weight and corrosion resistant so, technically I would say it is the better material for the job. AFAIK, aluminum has to be TIG welded, which some small shops and most hobbyists won't be set up for. This drives up the labor cost on top of the more expensive aluminum tube.  If you want to do it pipe style in aluminum look up Speed Rail fittings. That should keep both cost and weight down.  Good luck!"

If it's water hardening a dip in h2o will reharden the stamp.   hmmm. no part of that seems true. For one you still need to temper a quenched part, even if your target hardness is the same as its quenched hardness. Using a stamp, as quenched, would just crack off all the details of the stamp.  second you'd have to have the stamp reach 1500F+ or so before quenching it did anything. it's not going to pick up anywhere near that much heat from the less than 2 seconds you're contacting the workpiece.  Fact is most knifemakers dont hot stamp but just do it cold on an annealed blade. it provides a cleaner image, you can take all the time you need to position it precisely, its not going to deform your workpiece.  If hot stamping is your goal you'd use a specific hot work steel like H13"

There will be all sorts of simple projects like the tapping block that was mentioned plus things like a vise stop, a ghetto lathe dog, a big ass bolt, or maybe some metal nunchucks...

They need a pilot hole for the through bolt so your accuracy in drilling those will determine how accurately positioned your full size holes will be. They will not distort your plate. These are the test holes I did in a piece of gash 2mm aluminium plate to check the fit of the inserted parts. Although punching holes for conduit is a common use for them in the U.S. they are in fact general use sheet metal punches and we know them as such; for example.  If I was doing your particular job I would mark out and centre punch one plate, stack the plates and clamp them together, and drill a small 1/8 approx pilot through the stack with a pillar drill or a drill guide if using a hand drill. Then open out the holes to suit the bolt that operates the tool. Then dismantle the stack and punch each hole individually. If you can't stack them for some reason (already fitted parts for example) then you'll have to mark each one out individually. Depends on how many you need to produce really. Waterjet them if there's hundreds to do."

They are really precise you can just take a center punch and use it to mark the spot for your pilot hole. Using a drill bit the same diameter as the bolt on those punches i linked to you you just seperate the punch and die run the bolt through the pre drilled hole and then thread the punch back together. Its quick simple and will cut a precise hole with no mess. As long as you can manage to put your pilot holes in the right places i don't think you'll have a problem.

They may be effective in 90% of cases, or 10% of cases, or whatever. Maybe they only go off correctly half the time. Maybe they are only effective when they use less than 4mm plate for the penetrator. Maybe a lot of things.

metalworking,3bpiau,Integral_10-13_2xdx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:58:15 2015 UTC,Just about anything can be polished to a mirror finish. I vote stainless due to low oxidation potential. Perhaps brass if you need something a little easier to work with
metalworking,3bpiau,wannabearmchairQback,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:15:42 2015 UTC,Anything that doesn't develop a native oxide layer. That is often the destroyer of surface smoothness. Some mirrors are made of gold for this reason. Someone said mercury. That is a good point because it is a liquid at RT and so surface tension ensures a good clean surface provided it is impurity free. But that isn't polishing and there is no polishing involved. But some telescope mirrors are made with mercury by spinning it on a rotary plate and allowing centrifugal forces to spread the mercury while surface tension holds it together to form a concave mirror.  I would say gold should be pretty good.

metalworking,3bl357,Oscaruit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:34:27 2015 UTC,Look into candy coatings. You might be able to prep the blade and have a powdercoater put a coat on the blade as long as the handle will handle around 300-400°. Or you can use a traditional candy clear application.

metalworking,3bl357,spastacus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:11:57 2015 UTC,Sculpt nouveau has been mentioned but their solvent dyes would be my suggestion instead.   The main drawback is that dyes can not be applied on a mirror smooth surface which means you would need to rough up the surface. Not sure if that interferes with your requirements but it would provide a fairly vivid middle blue and can be thinned to make lighter tinting.   http://www.sculptnouveau.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=45&category=6  http://www.sculptnouveau.com/pdf/info_solvent_dye_book_201401.pdf (10 page pdf instructions since the product page is empty about use on ferrous materials and explains how to thin it)
metalworking,3bl357,kowalski71,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:12:50 2015 UTC,"Isn't gun blue actually black? I think the process you'd be looking for is patina, which is forcing a thin layer of oxidation to form on the steel to protect it. Often you acid etch the blade first to remove any oxidation then expose it to something that will force it to essentially rust. I think that you can create a tint depending on what you expose it to. I have faint recollections of someone using red wine to create a red tint. There are some pictures of patinas here and one of them looks like a nice blue tint. If you google 'knife patina' you'll find a myriad of articles and forum threads on it."
metalworking,3bl357,SloYerRoll,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:22:55 2015 UTC,I wonder if there are any metals you could use with an electrolysis process to give it a blue finish your looking for?  I don't have much experience with this process past YouTube but would think this is a solid option for changing the color of your blade.
metalworking,3bl357,wannabearmchairQback,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"It is possible. What steel are you using? Most steels can have different oxide layers form on the surface when you heat it to form a native oxide, due to the presence of carbon in the steel. You can absolutely get a blue surface finish provided you heat treat and temper it at the right temperature. It is extremely finicky though. You'd probably need a very good temperature controlled oven to do this right so that its not patchy. If you go over or under the correct temperature range, the native oxide will differ in thickness by a few nanometers and that is enough to throw the color off.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tempering_standards_used_in_blacksmithing.JPG  At the same time a knife blade needs to be hard. So actually the method one might take is to heat a high carbon content steel to an austenite phase. Then quench. This hardens the blade. Then sanded down to remove the scaling and oxide layer on top to expose a silvery color again. Then tempering to the right temperature to soften the blade slightly and increase toughness. THis stage can even be at the 'blue' temperature color so you get 2 birds with one stone."

metalworking,3bl357,Emfuser,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:34:27 2015 UTC,that's what i would do to harden then temper a blade of that size you are either going to need allot of experience at a forge to make sure you don't get it to hot or to cold. or you could get a heating oven if you have a spare couple grand lying around. go with cold blue cheaper and easier

metalworking,3bkna2,langwadt,2,Tue Jun 30 03:05:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that a 1/4"" width of cut is going to be pretty harsh on a little lathe like that. You'll probably get a pretty poor surface finish unless you use an extremely slow feed rate. But if you can live with some loose tolerances, then it would get the job done.  Also, seeing as you didn't know tool blanks like this were an option, I'm going to assume you aren't familiar with how to hand-grind tools. If that's the case, you'll want to read up on how to grind a tool. If you just use one of these blanks out of the box, they're going to cut like crap. Even a few degrees of relief in the right spot will make a world of difference in the quality of the cut.  Take a look at the first 3-4 hits on google, and also understand that what I've suggested is not ""the right way"" but rather ""the quick way"""

metalworking,3be1lo,perrti02,2,Sun Jun 28 19:18:56 2015 UTC,I think you might be overengineering it. You could just drill the smallest hole you can that the shoulder bolt would pass through. You won't need a precision fit since the iron you are forming should push it tight against the shoulder bolt. If you were designing something for mass production then you would need greater reliability but if you are only using it from time to time and on low precision items then you will get away with a much looser fit.  You could always make a quick one and see how the results come out. If they are not good enough then you can improve the design.
metalworking,3be1lo,perrti02,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:29:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thoughts.  I do tend to overdo it when designing stuff.  I tend to forget just how strong steel more often than is healthy for my wallet.

If I were designing something for manufacture as part of my job it would be over specified because it has to work correctly or it will waste time and money. If I am designing something for myself then I make it as cheap as I think I can get away with. If it is right then I save myself a bit of money and if it is wrong I can deal with the extra time.

THe standard or most common method is of course anodizing, staining and then sealing. Anodized aluminum can be extremely durable. Look at some of the ipod products for example. They are aluminum and colorized. They are hard anodized.  Of course you're looking for a greyish color from the looks of it. Your product is likely already anodized. And you'd probably have to separate the aluminum piece to be able to do anything to it reliable. Then strip the existing anodization layer. Then re-anodize it with a stain and then sealed. Looks like a lot of work. Maybe consider just painting it over.  Other methods likely out of your reach are chemical or physical vapor deposition methods that deposites a special layer of material on top that blackens the aluminum."

Otherwise your aluminum will stay silver."

The specific way the power feed functions, the fact that the power feed uses a rubber band for a belt, the push-style tailstock... but in actual use, these are not only easy to use but quite well thought out.

I went through mine and de-greased / adjusted / lubed it, which made an improvement.  Bought the LMS QC toolpost setup (consider it mandatory), and some various tooling.  Didn't get around to the various ""lock"" mods, but would say they are probably worth doing for extra rigidity.   Overall... it's small but works as long as your projects are small and you don't mind going slow and taking light cuts (not the end of the world, I really only got pissed when trying to hog out stainless steel).  I used indicators as sort of a poor mans DRO so the knob markings / backlash weren't as much a problem.  There were times I could have used more bed length (ebay has 7x14 versions of these, as does LMS) for threading suppressor tubes, but whattya going to do:  you aren't going to find any other options to get your feet wet this cheap.    In short... fuck the haters.... not everyone wants to jump right into spending $5k + tooling on a 2500lb+ lathe (even though if you stick around long, you'll end up there before you know it).  You can get projects done with these and it's not like they are hard to sell when you are done with them (or keep it, as they are handy as shit for turning small screws and such)."

Get a long nut that's threaded to take your rod and use that to connect the pieces together.    To finish the loop, look into ""union's""  They are often used in plumbing to connect two pieces of pipe.  So, one end can turn one way, and the other end the other way.  I don't know if they will handle the lateral stress, but you could always try and find out.    Alternatively, (I think this will work, not 100% sure) for the last piece, you could possibly do a left hand thread on one side of one rod.  When you turned it, it would thread into both sides at the same time, finishing your loop.  You'd probably have to make a custom bolt for this.  To make the bolt, you'd use a tap, take a 1"" round piece of steel, and drill the right size hole.  Then you'll need to tap that hole to put the threads in.

I see you also replied to the application question, but not to the bit about the total radius/diameter of the arc/circle you're wanting to bend it to without permanently being. So, here is what I would do.  Buy stainless threaded rod in 1/4"", use the standoffs I linked previously to link them together if you really need one end to remain free spinning. Otherwise, I would use coupling nuts, and thread one all the way onto one rod, line up the next and thread the coupling nut over them both, use semi-permanent loc-tite, or jam nuts to keep it from backing off either side.  if you require a smooth section between threaded areas, buy the appropriate size die and cut threads into the rod, and use appropriate sized threaded captive standoffs or coupling nuts.

The australian knife community has a similar 'issue' when dealing with large suppliers. lots of people saying how much business they're missing out on...not by their definition.

The through-holes are of various shapes and sizes and are used to hold, support or back up a hot bar of metal for further shaping. Operations performed on a swage block include but are not limited to bending, cutting, punching and forming. The sides are scalloped to present formed shapes for forging operations. Shapes are for example the curve of a wheel, which could be used to finish a wheel rim, using a suitable hammer. Other shapes, such as the half hexagon, can be used with a matching top swage to form a hexagonal cross-section on a bar. The various shapes around the edge of the swage block all have corresponding shapes in the form of top swages to shape iron bar into various sections.  The image shows a 15-inch, square swage block with various semi-circular, hexagonal, and square shapes around its perimeter along with a selection of through-holes.

metalworking,3anopl,thesirenlady,2,Mon Jun 22 03:46:25 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if aluminum is suitable for this.   Whether or not aluminum is suitable depends entirely on the loads and the expected lifetime.   How accurate does the shape need to be? Can you bandsaw it out and finish with a die grinder or something? Or does it need to be perfectly symmetric?  Honestly, $80 for a single piece like that doesn't sound too bad. Even if you get it waterjet/plasma cut as /u/kv-2 suggests, I'd be surprised if it cost significantly less than that. And waterjet and plasma will likely leave you with a taper and/or a surface finish that's not very smooth which, based on what I can tell from the sketch, is probably something you want."
metalworking,3anopl,asad137,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:53:42 2015 UTC,"The taper, depending on material thickness and how modern the cutter is, should be minimal with a decent plasma system. Waterjet is a lot more expensive than plasma, maintenance on the pump being the contributing factor. I know for us with our gas rates alone it is pennies a foot even at 2-3"" thick material with a modern machine [ESAB or Hypertherm].

Sometimes time is a more accessible asset than cash though.   If I were to do this, I'd do a foam casting and be able to fit up your part before you heat anything up."

metalworking,3afpv8,johansense1,2,Sat Jun 20 03:20:48 2015 UTC,says who?  the motor probably won't overheat until you exceed twice the nominal rpm and 1.5 times the nominal hp.
metalworking,3afpv8,johansense1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:48:57 2015 UTC,Really? I must have misunderstood my google searches then. Can you provide me with a source?
metalworking,3afpv8,germ22,2,Sat Jun 20 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"it really depends on the motor.  a number of electric vehicle conversions have been made by rewiring a 480 volt motor for 138 volts delta and then running it at up to 480 volts at 7000 rpm.. 4 times its base speed of 1800 hz and it will deliver 4 times the hp at that speed. i haven't heard of anyone running a large motor faster than that, because you run into the rotor's first critical speed.. but you can machine a larger shaft and put bigger bearings in it, and balance the rotor more accurately to solve that problem.  the principal reason folks burn out their motors is because they expect full load torque at lower than nominal rpm.. and guess what's connected to the shaft.. the blower that cools the motor...   When you exceed the design rpm but keep the same volts per hz, iron loss climbs...however the iron losses are also the best heatsinked--its the windings that run much hotter than the steel does. Reducing the shaft loading reduces copper losses, which brings the temperature back down to nominal levels..the question is, how much do you have to decrease it.  now what i mean by decrease the shaft loading is, it doesn't remain linear with the rpm so if you double the base speed, you cannot double the shaft hp and expect losses to remain the same.  you may have to reduce them 25%.  I will have to run some tests on my 480v 5 hp motor. I rewired it for 138 volts, and from 120vac single phase with a capacitor, it pulls 170 watts no load losses. (so i'm presuming three phase 138 volts would deliver similar numbers) Full load losses according to the nameplate at 5hp at 88.5% efficiency is 484 watts So subtract 170 watts no load loss and you get 310 watts of copper loss.  So if at 120 hz we double the iron losses.. and to make the math easier, lets say we include windage losses in with it. so at 120 hz and 268 volts and 3600 rpm at no load the motor is wasting 340 watts. This means we have 144 watts to burn up in the copper windings before we exceed the nameplate 80C temperature rise (keep in mind though there is 8 times as much airflow produced by the fan that cools the motor, so we can exceed this significantly)  so here the math gets messy. because we're also delivering twice the nominal line voltage, when we load the motor to its nameplate load, the actual amps flowing into the motor will not increase in like proportion as they will at nominal frequency, because 5 hp at 276 volts is half as many amps as it is at 138 volts. so the copper losses caused by the shaft hp load will be one fourth as much as it was at 1800 rpm. assuming these things are linear, even though they are not..  we can take the 310 and divide by 144 and then take the square root of that which is 1.46 multiply 5 hp by 1.46 and you get 7.3.. which is approximatly how many hp i could extract from my 5 hp motor at 270 volts 120hz compared to 138 volts 60hz  and the same temperature rise given the same cooling conditions.  at some point my 5 hp motor, at some rpm, it will require 484 watts of electrical power to spin the shaft without a load.  neglecting the increased cooling [and shaft hp sucked up by the fan] provided by the fan delivering 27 times as much airflow at three times the base speed... we can assume that would be around 5400 rpm.   reducing the volts per hz at higher rpms will significantly reduce iron losses and you should be able to program your vfd to do this.  as an example of ""what is nominal rated conditions"" a water cooled induction motor spindle available on ebay for perhaps $400 including the vfd.. operating at 5 Kw shaft power.. at 400hz and 24,000 rpm.. is smaller than a half hp single phase 120vac 60 hz motor, and its actually more efficient."
metalworking,3afpv8,germ22,2,Sat Jun 20 05:56:50 2015 UTC,"It will be fine. Lower speeds will give you grater tool life. I would not be to concerned about your max rpm, but rather your torque. 5hp is really not much, you will be limited to rather low depth of cut and low feeds. The lower feeds will impact tool life more than lower speeds. Low feeds will cause higher heat at the cutting edge and wear out your tool faster. Higher feeds causes most of the heat to be thrown away with the chip. Another issue with low depth of cut and lower feeds is that you might not get ideal chip formation and the chips wont break properly. For a hobbyist, you setup should work. But don't expect very high metal removal rates. You could also post over at /r/machinists. A lot of smart people there when it comes to machining and metal removal."

metalworking,3afpv8,wannabearmchairQback,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend getting a stronger motor. I use a lathe with 15hp, and always bitch that I can't take heavier cuts and higher feed. Spindle load is always at 90% when cutting mild steel at .120"" depth of cut and .012"" deed per revolution. The stronger lathe I use has 30hp, which is more satisfying to use and has a higher metal removal. .170"" depth of cut and .014"" feed... At 90% spindle load. The higher the metal removal rate, the more products you can make, and more profit. So your limited power, and limited rpm, would make the lathe a very inefficient piece of equipment. Like /u/johansense1 said, you will be cutting at only 460 feet per minute. Carbide tools are meant to be used at 1000 feet per minute and faster."

You use a wet felt tip pen of sorts with the electrolyte wetted, and electrified with an electrode and touch where you want to anodize, so basically just selecting the outermost diameter rings to anodize that way. So can polish the whole thing and groove everything first, and spot anodize the outer diameter parts."

metalworking,3aeqvb,pagsball,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:05:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure what is causing your stainless to turn black in this media, but you can buy stainless blackening chemical mixes. They're pretty similar to what gets sold for regular steel blackening (aka bluing.) The main difference is the addition of hydrochloric acid to eat away the chromium oxide layer. Then the copper sulfate and selenium can work their magic on the iron. This kind of mix is pretty corrosive and the waste water needs to be handled properly.  If your parts are small (and it sounds like they are) you can oil them lightly and apply a lot of heat. It'll take some practice to get a satisfactory result, but it can be done very well. They'll need to be otherwise very clean. Start the heating gently to drive off moisture or you'll get weird water spots etc.  Good luck!"

If casting is less hassle, what is the learning curve like to do it safely?   it's really straightforward. you can build and be working with a simple forge in about a week, maybe 2, and ~$100 depending on how much you mess up.   What metal would be the easiest to work with?   aluminum is a common place to start because it's easy to melt and readily available, but you dont want to use aluminum for something like brass knuckles. it dents and cracks too easily and could trap your hand."

Do it in stages. I like to use an aggressive wheel to brake down the weld, then move to a wheel that's very similar to the profile of the work (dressing). If i need to make it look real nice I may blend with softer abrasive wheels. 3. Practice with similar scrap at first or if that's not possible clamp sheet metal to protect the work on either side of the weld until you get it down. 4.Mill scale is your friend. take advantage if it's hard surface."

It's a good run down, covers the basics and then some, I may have missed it, did you cover guards, there are several grinders without them, but I didn't hear you explain the reasoning for removing them."

I'm not working with a script and I did edit out a lot of info, also I'm making it up as I go. I will be discussing guards and safety in part 2 when we look at cut-off and wire wheels. I'm still getting used to talking without saying um and ah in front of the camera so I edit it out, that's why I don't sound fluid most of the time. I took a lot of the footage with the intent of doing a longer more indepth video at first but then decided to focus on the intro while showing some real results and a useful tip or two. Part 2 should complete the look at most styles of attachments  and impart some more usefull tips, tricks, philosophy of use, with other useful info. I'm also planing to do techniques and reviews of grinders in later videos. I really need to work on many things but right now I'm trying to sort out ways to keep my audio and video organised. Thanks again for the feedback it helps a great deal."
