Staying at the same place each and every day just drives me insane, especially with all the shit I put up with on a daily basis.   There's definitely a few tricks to maintaining your sanity while working at Walmart. A quick power fap in a handicap stall, for instance, energizes your workday in a way that coffee/energy drinks simply cannot. And be sure to take advantage of your daily allowance of shift drinks. Just make sure you scan your beers first so they can be accounted for when inventory time comes."

This saves you from having to check prenotes for features.   2- an area of the store for fixtures, shelves, extra peg hooks,  etc.   3- extra space in a modular to do with as you see fit. I use my flex for deleted or no mod, or I expand a good selling item to fill the space.   4- money for things vendors take back (busted cases of soda, expired items, mass feature quantities, etc. We pay the vendors as the merchandise comes in the building, they give us money to take it back.   5-a large feature (bigger than a single stackbase) of something.

Rack room- a room or location of the store where the shelves and other shit is stored such as labels, sign molds, price tags, and fast track. In my store, we call it the ""signing area"". It's usually a big mess and there's everything there except what you need.   Flex- Designated, extra space on a modular for deleted, not-traited, NRPL, CVP (Customer Value Program) and clearance items.  If it's filled with clearance items often, Customers will frequent that section often in search of deals and markdowns. A general tip of info is to only put these items in there and not general overstock so they don't get lost in your counts and on-hands.  Credit is money the store gets back for vendor items. I've used this before when I was DM for fish. If the fish delivered by my fish vendor died within the first 3 days of arrival, we got credit for the fish.   Wow display. Our managers usually call features wow displays when they are stocked well, or stocked a little bit over capacity and can be seen from far away.  As for the MC40s, I can't help ya there.

You inventory it by the weight to get its monetary worth.

It happens to all of us, not just associates.   Your honestly getting paid to do the same job, and if you are pretty reasonable with your Assistant about working in other areas, it'll work in your favor when you want a day off, need to leave early, interested in a promotion etc."

walmart,3dzvnw,AleAssociate,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:59 2015 UTC,Yeah. Apparently it's leadership training for the Department Managers. There is also a little hardback book with all their expectations in it.

Any reason they wouldn't be? From my understanding you basically do the same level of work besides actually having one set department. You even have more responsibilities with handling associates.

walmart,3dv3v2,AdvocatingforEvil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:22:22 2015 UTC,"This.  My first year I got 40 hours every week. A couple months before my anniversary I was pulled into the ad office and they showed me I had been averaging full time hours but was still part time. They had me sign a paper that recognized that I was working full time hours as a part time associate and that I was interested in a full time position if one were to become available. The manager said that they might have to cut my hours if a position did not open up. About a month later I was pulled back to the office and they said i had been moved to full time and could expect to continue getting full time hours. Then a bit after that I hit my anniversary and got a little over an hour of vacation for being full time for a couple weeks.  Basically, it is up to the management team whether you will be made full time or not regardless of the 12 week rule heh. The managers made it seem like they have to maintain a certain ratio of full time vs part time employees and that there are only so many spots they can offer up though I'm not a manager so I don't know how true that is."

People who know how to do it and are willing to work their butts off. The first store I worked at were crazy good at their job on mod team. They each would get a pile of mods to have completed by the end of the night and only worked together when they set the registers or mods in grocery.

While that's great and definitely a step in the right direction, it's gonna take more to increase moral. Employees are fed up. Overworked is an understatement.   Not only that, but let's be honest -- Walmart employees are usually the bottom of the barrel types. You might have one good, solid, hard-working employee for every five lazy slackers.  Personally, I can think of one thing that would eliminate a lot of problems. You work YOUR department. People resent being sent to work multiple departments. When I worked there, I took pride in my department. When I got sent to the backroom, or grocery, or to go get carts, I didn't give it 100%. Not intentionally, but it's hard to put effort into something that a) doesn't directly benefit you and b) you have no desire for. Hire enough people to cover departments. Simple as that."

Plus it's taking time away from doing things that do affect me. I think you're 100% right that being shifted around constantly is a morale killer."

walmart,3dsvgo,Ruzek,8,Sun Jul 19 16:24:52 2015 UTC,"We're overworked and under-appreciated. We're expected to get 12+ hours of work done in 8 hours. Anything less than perfect is considered a productivity issue. You can spend the entire day making sure your department looks picture-perfect, leave feeling proud of the work you've done, and come in the next morning to a note saying ""see me in the office."" Then you get a new butthole chewed into you for having too much overstock.  Positive reinforcement from management would change morale, at least in my store, exponentially. Instead of saying ""B looks like shit,"" say ""good job on A, B needs a lot of work."" Personally, that would make me want to step up my game and get things done. To the first response, I'd feel like they though of me as a slacker and would half ass both projects so they'd leave me alone.  Actually, on paper, we're under-worked. We're constantly getting our hours cut. Apparently my store's over 120 hours. 90% of my store has been cut down to 24 hours a week or less. Of course we're still expected to get all of our regular work done in half the time. With time left over to zone.  Most people can barely afford to live working full time here. We're essentially getting our paychecks cut in half. And most people can't get food stamps or anything like that, because we make too much money an hour. 20 hours of my work week is for rent an utilities. I still have to eat.  Basically, we get walked on for a hard day's work; and while we get paid more per hour now, we don't work enough hours for it to make a difference (at least for 8 months out of the year). That being said, I like my job. Management usually doesn't have anything to do with me personally, I work with a great group of people, and usually the first thing an irate customer says to me is ""get me a manager.""

I was willing to stay as long as it takes to get everything fixed, but I was forced to go home so all day after 4 pm there was no one in the meat dept on a Friday. You can imagine what that meant for us coming in Saturday morning.   Are you scheduled less than 40 hours? Use to be that you could pick up extra days as long as you didn't go over 40. Not anymore.if you are scheduled 20 hours then you are only working 20 hours.   We were always over worked and under staffed. Now it's even worse."
walmart,3dsvgo,Hockeyfanman,3,Sun Jul 19 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"There's always a catch when it comes to Walmart, always. We get a nice bonus check, but the following two weeks your schedule is cut to 19 hours a week. So it's not really a bonus. If you think you're doing them a favor by working on a holiday, they thank you by cutting your schedule on the next week in order to make up for the extra money they ""lost"" paying employees extra. They make you feel good while simultaneously kicking you in the balls.   Speaking about understaffed, I'm working the meat dept, which is fine and I have no problems with, except that almost every night, there is only 1 associate scheduled to work grocery (sometimes no one is there after 8pm) and zero associates in the Dairy after 7. So that means, I'm spending half my night helping customers find shit in the grocery/dairy aisles or running in the back to get stuff for customers. Then I end up having to cover breaks in the deli (cause they cut their schedules and are way understaffed). I rarely take my 15 breaks now because I actually try to get my job done, which I can rarely do because the store is so goddamned understaffed. I'm stuck having to do ten other jobs.  So in the end, shit just keeps piling up as a result of Walmart trying to save a couple bucks, and it's just getting worse. I'd be fine getting paid $8 an hour if we had a decently staffed store, then I wouldn't have to come home and drink a 12 pack each night to keep me from realizing what horrible life choices I've made.

If they dont / cant provide a person to help, or the right tools (telxon and printer for example), then it is their problem.  We are entitled to breaks and lunches. If we stay past when our shift ends(which they can not force, only ask or try to threaten), we are entitled to overtime, and shouldn't have to cut it. These are basic principles that are not only policy, but just common sense. They cant milk us til there is nothing left, then throw us away when we have nothing left.

I'm sure it's the same as other places but most other places offer perks to working there. Walmart just offers free water bottles and maaaaybe hotdogs for being accident free.
walmart,3dsvgo,musicismylyfeee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:04 2015 UTC,We have many old timers at my store.  They bitch and complain yet they have things I could only dream of currently.  Full time and making like $15+ an hour.  One is 83 and says they will have to fire her to get rid of her.  It seems like employees are either very long time or new and don't last long.
walmart,3dsvgo,Kingnothing210,2,Sun Jul 19 05:06:23 2015 UTC,"Don't know why someone downvoted me for telling the truth.  I always tell people to either move up quickly or find a higher paying job. Walmart is starting to make it harder to get a 60 cent raise. It took me 10 years to make it to $15 an hr.  I can land another retail job easily. When I interview for a tech job or any other field, the main question they ask is ""Why do you want to leave after being with the company for so long?"""

The Third Shift Assistant Manager was told by our Store Manager that he is not allowed to use us for stocking and other overnight purposes. Guess what we were doing last night? Spending 3 hours stocking freight because there was only 10 stockers scheduled and the Assistant apparently needed help stocking.   We told him we were supposed to be zoning as per our tasks given to us, and he said ""how about you zone these cases onto the shelf?""   We told him we don't mind stocking freight, as long as he's backing us up when we get chewed out for not doing what were supposed to do. I can already see what's going to happen if our Store Manager finds out he was using us- ""Well, you got it done without the Supports before, why is this any different?"""
walmart,3du1rr,ilikehockeyandguitar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:02:25 2015 UTC,If your store is above 80 million in volume you don't answer to the Assistants. The comanagers are your direct manager. Get with a Co and tell them the assistants aren't following the structure.

On Saturday, I am officially a support manager. 99% of the people I work with are happy that I will be a support manager (after 5 years as a produce DM). My CoMgr has already sat with us and gone over general guidelines, but the brunt is ""Action Alley is your office"". Will I get pulled for tasks? sure. Will I throw freight? sure. Will I pick and bin? sure. I am there to do what the CoMgr and my ASM need me to do. If I get 'an easy night"" of nothing but customer contact, great. If I have to spend 10 hours throwing stock, I can do that too. We all realize that there is a learning curve to the new position. The number one reason I took it, for the record, is that for 7 years, I've worked 3 days on and one off then 2 on and another one off. I am incredibly stoked about 4 on - 3 off."

walmart,3dpq44,Fisha695,5,Sat Jul 18 06:49:31 2015 UTC,the one time that happened with me i treated it like i would on the sales floor... 10 ft rule followed by walking with them back to sales floor
walmart,3dpq44,recklesspainter,2,Sat Jul 18 08:15:04 2015 UTC,"I had a customer come all the way into the breakroom just to scream""HEEEELLLO CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME"", and all she wanted to know was if we had an item in stock.   Worst was a crazy guy that came right into the truck while it was being unloaded just to whine about not getting help. He was escorted out by management."
walmart,3dpq44,JasinNat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:19:31 2015 UTC,I have this problem with people walking into the dairy cooler.
walmart,3dpq44,spiralprime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:10:56 2015 UTC,"I've seen customers do this when they see associates in the back, and can't find anyone on the floor. Every time it's happened I've just walked them out to the floor and helped them from there. They are usually just looking for something, and know 9 times out of 10 there will probably be an associate in the backroom."
walmart,3dpq44,ilikehockeyandguitar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"""Oh I'm sorry, this is an employee only area. I will be glad to help you if you just come with me"". Or something of that nature. Basically don't bark at them, most people are pretty understanding when you don't lay blame."
walmart,3dpq44,MyNameIsSkittles,-6,Sat Jul 18 15:36:55 2015 UTC,talk to management about getting a wireless door bell for the area if you are going to be in the back.
walmart,3dpq44,jimbobushido,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:15:04 2015 UTC,"and a monitor too , so you can see who it is w/ou thaving to leave the backroom. Perfect!"
walmart,3dpi4i,FedMex,11,Sat Jul 18 04:57:20 2015 UTC,if i won the lottery i'd still be unloading trucks at walmart just to avoid paying gym membership / becoming a lazy fatass
walmart,3dpi4i,recklesspainter,3,Sat Jul 18 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"So funny, i had that conversation with my finance couple months back and i said the same thing. Only thing that would hold me back is i know i would want to take a lot of trips lol. I honestly love what i do. Have dropped about 40 lbs in a year. Never knew i had that much i could lose, because its not like i looked like i needed to lose it. Its like bootcamp, getting paid to workout."
walmart,3dpi4i,truisdav,2,Sun Jul 19 03:30:57 2015 UTC,I honestly love my job (was my first job at 16 and I have now been here 3 years) and would only leave it if O found a job either a lot more enjoyable/less stressful or paid a lot more. But I wouldn't leave for something similar or that paid similar.
walmart,3dpi4i,alvmich,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"This.  I like my job a lot.  I get $9.50 an hour for it with full-time benefits.  The only other options are more tiring/difficult (fast food, landscaping) for less pay.  And I wouldn't get regular breaks and/or I wouldn't get a full hour for lunch.   A local university has on-campus jobs for students, but those pay minimum wage and require showing up at 7 am, which means getting up early in the morning.  Source: my brother worked at McDonald's in high school.  I would not do McDonald's for $9.50 an hour."
walmart,3dpi4i,Speed__Racist,2,Mon Jul 20 14:36:05 2015 UTC,Eh. I may be on my way out.  I kinda don't wanna. But I want outta unloading. Even tho I'm 90% sure I'm getting a support spot on 2nd shift.. They are are killing me by waiting this long to announce/fill the reqs.  I passed on a $18 an hour job at Sysco last summer doing the same thing I do now! Minus the manger part! (No stress)  I'll be putting in the apps for Sysco again if I don't get it. I know it might sound winey to some people.. But I've been unloading for 3 years now. I've learned all I can learn in the backroom. Time to move on. Either with or without walmart. I still love walmart and all the opportunities they've given me to learn and advance.
walmart,3dpi4i,Tippin187,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:05:26 2015 UTC,"Have you considered transferring to your local DC? superior schedule, and pay. I'm an unloader at the DC and make more than twice what I did as a Frozen/Dairy MS at the store."
walmart,3dpi4i,xnzs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:36:08 2015 UTC,I've thought about it.. Thought about it a lot.   But unfortunately.. I don't have a local DC.. My DC is in Smyrna DE.. And for all the crap I have going on in my life atm.. It's just not feasible for me to leave atm.   it's still definitely not left my mind yet. Maybe a year or so.. I'd think I'd like the change of seeing things from the loading perspective rather unloading.
walmart,3dpi4i,Tippin187,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:45:59 2015 UTC,"You should definitely keep thinking about it. There are lots of different jobs at the DC, loading, unloading, order filling, lift drivers, replenishment, hauling, office positions, truck yard positions, AP positions.   Transferring to the logistics side sort of changed my views about the company a bit. They put a lot of money into their DCs, and it shows. Plus the set schedule is kickass.   I'm not sure how far Smyrna, DE is from you, but if your life issues ease up a bit, I think you should definitely go for it. I hope things start to look up for you soon, man."
walmart,3dpi4i,xnzs,2,Sun Jul 19 09:00:23 2015 UTC,in a heart beat.....
walmart,3dpi4i,boytoy2070,2,Sat Jul 18 06:28:05 2015 UTC,"My reasons for wanting to leave is for a more equitable work & family balance. Spending holidays with family. Two days off in a row with a set schedule. If given the opportunity, I'm taking it."
walmart,3dpi4i,boogerjr,2,Sat Jul 18 08:16:15 2015 UTC,"Only if the new job offered more money, medical/ benefits, and weekends off. I have a set schedule of Saturday night and Sunday nights off and consider myself very lucky. Working holidays that fall within Monday-Friday is the only downside but that's okay for right now."
walmart,3dpi4i,musicismylyfeee,2,Sat Jul 18 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The nice thing about WM for me right now is that they work around my college schedule. But as soon as I'm done with college and I find a job in my chosen career, I'm out of there. I've been looking for a different job, but I live in a tiny town and there's hardly anything."
walmart,3dpi4i,perksofpilotry,2,Sun Jul 19 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"I was given a chance to leave, for a substantial pay increase, and getting out of retail. I actually accepted it, told everyone at WM I was leaving, apologized for the short notice (a week!), and then.. changed my mind. Or possibly lost my mind, I dunno.  It came down to two major things - WM is stable. I've worked for small companies before and been laid off with no warning twice. It royally sucks. I'm no longer in a position in life where I could ride through that again. WM also offers a pretty clear path upwards to anyone who wants to take it and is prepared to do the work. Sure, it's a grind, but it's a steady one.  And the second thing is that I realized that.. I actually like retail. I like the pace. I like seeing lots of different people. I enjoy helping people. Sure, I'm helping them to buy shit they don't need and it hardly compares to.. I dunno, saving the lives of small children, but for that one brief moment when I tell someone where an item is, I have legitimately helped someone.  Also working here gives me a perfectly valid reason to drink."
walmart,3dpi4i,workerbee41,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:46:48 2015 UTC,"Depending on how things go in my area, I might have a way out next year, if I play my cards right and something that is supposed to happen actually happens.   Otherwise, I might as well stay, even though the stress is killing me."
walmart,3dpi4i,ihaveneverbeenhappy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:12:56 2015 UTC,Absolutely.
walmart,3dpi4i,desert_dweller,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:32:57 2015 UTC,I'd get out if I'd found a job that involved with a hobby or if I won the lottery.
walmart,3dpi4i,spiralprime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:12:04 2015 UTC,"I've been with the company 10 years. Been going to school in hopes I can land a comfy tech job. The thought of leaving Walmart is nice but also scary, since retail is what I've known for the past 10 years."
walmart,3dpi4i,backroomassociate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:04 2015 UTC,yes
walmart,3dpi4i,goatfishtoo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:18:08 2015 UTC,It really depends on a lot of factors.
walmart,3dpi4i,Walmart76,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I'm sick of night shift, and I'm sick of being one the few managers that gets stuck working EVERY weekend."
walmart,3dpi4i,Gregatr0n,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"Unless I could make $20 an hour shittily playing guitar in my bedroom, I think I'll stay. My only other options are working on the river or in a steel refinery.  As long as my bills are paid and I have enough money left over to scrape by, I'm going to work somewhere that makes me happy.  I passed up a job at a call center that pays $15/hr recently, because I know that sitting behind a desk all day would kill me. Yeah, I could afford all the nice shit I want, but I'd also want to drive off a bridge every day on my way to work.  Right now I only do that once or twice a week."
walmart,3dpi4i,roundhousekicker88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:32:55 2015 UTC,"I want to say ""in a heartbeat""because walmart as a corporation is evil. And my store sucks. After almost 9 years it would be hard. If another job was close in pay and offered benefits, probably. But starting somewhere new, after 9 years, makes me unsure"
