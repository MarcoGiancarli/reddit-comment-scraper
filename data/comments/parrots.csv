parrots,3e33ag,Garwoodwould,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"I believe that's a Yellow Crowned Amazon, and its feathers look great!   If your friend is up for the challenge than that's great. The amazon being older means that there's a lot of already learned traits, and if he's a very even tempered and patient person then he'll probably do well.. However, I hope you went further to explain the biting than simply stating that it hurts... My own amazon is 25 and has gone through my ear (she didn't mean to..), but she meant these other ones on other people - through finger nails, a friend's palm, left a nice crescent moon shaped cut in my GF's finger last week, etc.. They're big birds with powerful beaks that can leave their owners needing stitches if they're not careful..  Have you maybe tried taking him to visit the bird and speak with the current owners? Research is great, but he's got a unique opportunity to put in some quality time with the bird and owners and get the real lowdown on the situation to see if he's up for the challenge. There will be a lot about the bird that they can tell him and he'd be wise to listen to. He'd also be very smart to take the time to visit because it's much easier to do that than to find out that he made a horrible mistake by adopting the bird. It's also much less stressful for the bird if it's only re-homed once, and I hope the current owners will be vetting the prospective owners prior to the re-homing..  As I'm sure that you're aware.. owning cats and dogs doesn't prepare you to clean a cage multiple times per week, get pooped on during your ""bonding time,"" try to order takeout/make a business call while your parrot's having a party in the background, maintaining a bird's diet (amazons are prone to packing on the grams), or having them out daily while watching/interacting with them.. It never seems like much until it needs to happen and you don't feel like doing it. :/"
parrots,3e33ag,LopsidedMidget,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"It's a Blue Front Amazon. souce: I own one, and he's a looooud 30 year old bugger who we rescued from a 90 year old man who could no longer look after his deceased wife's bird.  Arco is messy beyond belief, seed shells, pellet dust, ripped paper/toys are all around his cage. Think of it as a toddler at a restaurant throwing things everywhere as they eat.  If he is not a morning person, be ready to become one. They often crow at the crack of dawn, and sometimes endlessly even when covered for bed. We can hear our bad boy 3 houses down the road when he's upset we've left him to go out. If your friend has neighbours close by, he may get complaints from them. If he's in an apartment, he may get the ultimatum of get rid of the bird or be evicted.  Rehomed birds sometimes will act out at their new home. Ours was angry as hell at his previous home because of abuse from the old man who ""looked after him"". And that effect is still causing him to have aggressive outlashes sometimes. Some birds become depressed from being taken from their family, which can cause various emotional reactions.  If he's willing to deal with the ups and the downs, then I'd say go for it.  Edit excuse incoherence and typos; 2month old screaming making sun conure scream is making me a bit crazy."
parrots,3e33ag,Faithwynn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"Second that it's a Blue Front (they have varying amounts of blue). Its feathers are a bit ragged but it looks like she needs bathing, which most Amazons love. She has overchewed a bit near her neck, but hopefully baths and distraction will clear that up (after new growth).  It seems he's learning a lot on his own, but do mention the possibility of the bird 'overbonding' to him and having difficulty interacting with others. Mine likes to scream at anyone in our space and especially hates men and children, and nobody I know is willing to work with him because of the bite. I can get him to stop screaming, finally, but the point is that this isn't a cat or dog and they're not always nice. Of course, females are supposed to be easier than males like mine, and her life experience thus far will determine her behavior more than anything. (Mine was a rescue who attacked everyone, so the fact that he is a sweetie for me is good enough.) He will mostly need to meet her and find out!"

parrots,3e1zmr,humbledog,4,Tue Jul 21 09:55:38 2015 UTC,I personally Line the bottom of all my cages with newspaper since I have an abundance of it. (cages usually have bars preventing the bird from getting to the bottom of the cage.)
parrots,3e1zmr,Tenziru,2,Tue Jul 21 10:51:08 2015 UTC,"Paper products are best, and newspaper is the cheapest. If your cage does not have the metal bars that keep the bottom separate from the rest of the cage, just steer clear of the shiny, color printed portions of the newspapers since the inks can contain toxins or leads which can harm your parrot.  Also, avoid cedar shavings, walnut shells and ground up corn cobs as cage bottom liners. If consumed, all three can cause big problems.  I have an African Grey who is a notoriously picky eater, but she loves Zupreem fruit blend pellets. I just got a big 90lb bag from a seller on Amazon. The last big bag like that that I purchased lasted over a year. There aren't many pet shops within 50 miles of where I live, so I have to buy online. If you don't know what type of pellets your parrot was eating, try different ones (small bags) until you find one it likes. The Zupreem formula I use is made as a ""complete"" diet, but I supplement with fresh fruit and veggies that my grey will consume (when she's not afraid of it). I inherited mine as well, 15 years ago. I don't know who mistreated her, but she's a very mistrustful parrot :( We do what we can :)"
parrots,3e1zmr,Phasianidae,2,Tue Jul 21 11:08:45 2015 UTC,"Newspaper.  Any sort of shaving or bedding for birds in the pet store require CONSTANT replacing or they quickly form toxic molds.  In the end it just costs too much.  Newspaper (at least two weeks old if possible) is plentiful and safe.  You can also place a bunch of sheets in the bottom and just pull out the top sheet or two every morning for a fresh clean cage every day.  Keep him on the same pellets if possible.  Parrots can be picky.  Try to keep the amount of seed low.  It should only be about 5% of his diet.  Adding fruits and veggies may take some time.  YOU will need to eat more of them in his presence.  The idea is simple: Monkey see, monkey do.  If he sees you eating it, he will want to try it.  I've converted many parrots to a better diet by simply putting their food on one of my plates.  ""Oh look!  That food is on HIS plate, so it MUST be tasty!""  Try to get greens into the diet.  Greens should be a large component of any parrot diet.  Dandelion, arugula, collards, mustard greens, etc.   Try a variety.  Hang them in the cage, not just in his bowl.  One trick I've used with amazons is putting the good food in an omelet.  I don't think I've ever seen an amazon stick up his nose at an omelet...even with good foods in it.  Eventually you can mix up a big bowl of veggies and add just a tiny bit of beaten egg to give it some flavor (and less fat than a full omelet).  Speaking of fat, amazons are exceptionally lazy and obeseity prone parrots.  Keep treats to a minimum...especially fatty ones."
parrots,3e1zmr,Charlie24601,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:23 2015 UTC,I use plain newsprint packing paper. Comes in big packs and is fairly inexpensive. It's easier for me to buy this than hunt down old used newspapers. Also they are the perfect size for the bottom of my cage. I grab two sheets every other day and change out the bottom. The other benefit to using plain paper is you can easily see the condition and color of your bird's droppings.
parrots,3e1zmr,SamusAran388,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"Newspaper for the bottom of the cage (allows for you to see poop, which is an indicator of the bird being sick or not), and check out amazon.com for pellets. Our amazon and CAG like RoudyBush daily maintenance for medium birds (relatively affordable on amazon), weren't fans of Harrisons, and were just ok with zupreem.   Do you have any experience with parrots? What's this one's age? If you haven't done so already (or the previous owner didn't leave you any paperwork) I'd take it to an avian vet to get a baseline on its health. Make an appointment, though. Most vets charge extra for walk ins.    Here's a list of some foods that are toxic for parrots. Try to avoid highly salty foods or ones that have a lot of sodium in them, and peanuts. As another person mentioned, amazons have a tendency to be fatties and you'll need to keep an eye on the food intake. Also, it's not exactly intuitive, but on top of being a pretty fatty ""nut"" the peanuts can contain aflatoxin (bottom of page) in them, which causes liver damage.   So far as fresh foods go, the most recent ""weekly meal"" (I do it about every week/week and a half and put it in the fridge for them then feed them about 50% pellets and 50% veggies twice per day) for the birds was oven baked acorn squash and sweet potato, fresh broccoli, carrots, and boiled quinoa. Both birds go nuts for acorn/butternut squash when it's been baked, and the quinoa was also a big hit."

They middle two (the rescues) would come to me when it is night time, but they would run from the ex when she tried to grab them for bed.  So she would leave it up to me to grab them for bed.

My bird loves me, but sees my husband as a rival and will always try to bully him. Since we started clicker training him my husband can now get him in and out of the cage without getting bitten. I'll give you a quick example of how he accomplished this.   The first couple of days or even weeks you are going to just click the clicker and then offer a treat. The idea is to get him/her used to the sound and realize that sound means something good is coming. Next we start on the targeting part. I use a chopstick for targeting. So I first taught my GCC that if he touches the tip of his beak to the tip of the chopstick then he gets a click and then a reward. Parrots are naturally inquisitive so if I just held the chopstick near his beak, he'd eventually reach out and touch it. We did this for a few days to a week till I felt like he understood what I was up to. Then I made him follow the chopstick around his cage or the counter. We had him crawling all over his cage and running across the counters to get the tip of the chopstick. Once your bird has that down you can start holding your hand out in front of the cage door and then the chopstick out a little further than your hand. So your bird has to use your hand to reach the chopstick. This is how my husband had to get my bird out for at least a month. Now he can get him in and out no problem, but it was a very gradual process.  Here is a quick video on the subject."
parrots,3e19of,SamusAran388,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this suggestion. We did come across target training last night and it seemed to be the best long term solution. Your comment just reenforces that thought.   However in the short term, I fear she may be banished to her cage for the next two weeks. Before you started target training did anything else work, even for a short while? I just want my S.O. to get through these two weeks with her until I can get back and we can start target training her."
parrots,3e19of,SamusAran388,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"Before we invested the time and effort into the target/clicker training I did have to go out of town twice. My husband had to care for my bird all by himself both times. I moved all the food and water bowls around so they were attached to the bottom doors (the doors on his cage open out, they don't drop down.) All he had to do is open the cage door and the bowls could easily be pulled out without having to actually stick his hands in the cage. Before he attempted this, he'd give my bird something to eat that would occupy his beak for the few seconds it took to snag the bowls out. He said that only sometimes worked hahaha. He said sometimes he'd happily eat what was offered, other times he'd drop it and make a bee line for his hands. He had to do this for 1 week each time. My bird was a bit more agreeable to my husband when he realized I was gone gone and all he had for company was my husband. My husband said by the second day he was easier to deal with. Maybe this will work for you guys, you can test it out by leaving the room and letting you S.O. try to change out the food. Or if you have a little bit of time before your trip, have your S.O. take over the daily feeding tasks now.   Parrots are smart and once my bird got over the scary clicker sound (only took a few days in my case) he learned everything very very quickly. During the first real training session he figured out what the chopstick was for and within 3 days I had him turning around on cue without the aid of the chopstick. So far all we've taught him is turn around, wave, and nod his head yes. The other thing that helps save my husbands hands is he offers his closed fist to step up on, not his finger. Even now, and I am fairly certain my bird won't bite him hard. My husband is too afraid to offer his finger anymore after a few nasty chomps. The back of your hand when it's a closed fist is harder to get a hold of than your offered fingie.   While you are gone it would be a perfect time for your S.O. to start the clicker training process. Every day they can go sit by the cage, click and then offer a treat (assuming your bird will take a treat from your S.O. through the bars of the cage) Once that seems to be going well, they can offer the point of the chopstick through the bars of the cage, if the parrot touches the tip of the chopstick and only the tip, then click and offer a treat. Then you can start having your parrot move about the cage in different locations to get to the chopstick. By the time you come back he might actually be able to get your bird out of the cage with out your assistance. The key is to click the instant they do what you want them to do and reward. Always reward, even if you accidentally click the clicker."

parrots,3e0ii3,hollowlefty,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:39 2015 UTC,"Do you have a small table top perch you can take her when you work with her? I saw someone made this and I bought this perch. It's kinda cheapie but it works alright. I did have to wrap the perch part in vet tape because my bird didn't like the feel of the plastic on his feet. Having a designated area for training might help keep your bird focused during the training sessions. Work on having her step up and down from the perch and reward her every time she steps up successfully.   Also if she's hard to remove from your shoulders don't let her up there anymore. If my GCC is being a little cuss, and doesn't want to step up then the last place I want him is by my face. I set him on my lap or that table top perch if he won't behave up on my shoulder. Thankfully this rarely happens. Until she 98% of the time steps up on command I wouldn't let her sit on your shoulder. Being up there is a privilege she has to earn."

parrots,3e0ii3,SamusAran388,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"Do you keep the mic stand near her cage so she sees it and gets used to having it near? This might be a gradual process all the way around. Introducing her to the mic stand AND working on the step up command. Glad she's not going to take a chunk out of your ear lol. I have been bitten on my lip once. I about shot through the roof, it hurt so damn bad. I think even if she's well behaved up on your shoulders I still wouldn't let her sit there if she won't step up. The only other thing I can suggest is bribing her with a treat, so she'll have to step onto your hand to get to the treat. I keep suggesting target/clicker training to people as a means of reinforcing desirable behaviors AND building a bond with your bird."

parrots,3dzdzc,jayjay097531,4,Mon Jul 20 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he's been trained to act this way. First, I'm by no means a Tiel expert. I've actually just started raising one but it's a very daunting task. I've found a lot of useful resources online and on reddit but I've experienced and still experiencing my Tiel's anxiety with my hands.   Couple points that grabs my attention:  When you chase him around your room, you come across as a predator. Think of yourself as a kid playing tag or hide and seek. That can be a fearful thing regardless of how much your Tiel trusts you as its handler. If you let your Tiel out, you need to keep it contained rather then let it fly all over the place. My suggestion to either a) Let it out slowly and only when it's on your hand or on a portable perch or b) Clip its wing so it can't fly all over the place rapidly or c) Let it come back to the cage on it's own or approach you on its own.  And another thing is that you've said you neglected your Tiel. Tiels are creature of habit. In order for it to trust you and your hand you need to first reestablish the authority. Tiel aren't naturally ""moody"" or ""spoiled"" or ""bratty."" They are literally a creature of habit. You need to teach him that you are in charge and that your hands are there to provide food and entertainment. He probably learned that hissing and biting at you will let him get what he wants. As oppose to letting him know that biting you will get him what he wants, you need to let him know that your hand are there to stay whether he likes it or not. This will take a lot of time and patience.   The reason why you're having such difficulty with your Tiel is because of the habit it developed over the years. I understand that you neglected your Tiel because life is pretty busy, but try to spend 15-30minutes with it everyday just talking to him and putting your hand by the cage. Not necessarily letting it out and letting him go wild. If you are to let him out let him wander around slowly on top of the cage. If it starts flying everywhere, let him return to the cage by himself or approach you by himself. Don't approach him like a predator."
parrots,3dzdzc,TheHamburgerlar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I'm still reading on calming his behaviour and preventing distrust in my hand, but I noticed his spike goes up when I would say he's curious."
parrots,3dzdzc,rougefleurette,3,Mon Jul 20 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"I recommend a couple of things: A small stand for him to hang out at when you're at the computer. Or, have some tissues ready for him when he has to go to the bathroom. You could eventually potty train him but that's going to take a long time.  Be consistent with the training, and keep in mind a bird has a pretty short attention span. I spend maybe 5-10 minutes training a day, it's not much, but any longer than that and they get bored. Whenever he steps up onto your finger, make a big deal. Tell him excitedly what a good bird he is and give him a treat. Millet works, but so do sunflower seeds (yes, I know seeds are not ideal diet for birds, however using them as a training tool or a treat is highly effective).   Oh, and see if your little guy likes corn flakes (the unsweetened cereal). Mine LOVED it and it made training really easy, plus it also made getting him down from high places really easy (all I had to do was shake the box and he'd fly right to me). Again, this is merely a treat and not meant to be part of the main diet.   Cockatiels tend to like to do a quick lap or two around a room right after getting out of the cage. They get very excited about this and it really is good for their health to get the exercise. So honestly, you're going to have to let him do this. Just make sure the room is safe for him to fly around in. Don't chase him or come at him.   You can eventually let him hang out on your shoulder, but only when he's much better with stepping up.  Good luck!"
parrots,3dzdzc,rougefleurette,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks as well. I usually try to grab millet when he steps on and stop bothering him when he backs away from my finger. It's night and he flew down to my shoulder again. I got him to get on my finger and on to the monitor slowly. He then went back on my finger which i rewarded and let me gently touch his spike. I'd have to assume the calmness of night time helped but now he's in his cage with the day ending with mullet spray and a slight rub on the head! Few questions though.  Sometimes In his cage he would sit down at the bottom corner to take a nap instead of his perch. Is this okay?  When I put my finger near him and he sometimes would hiss when i even get near him, he would always hiss or bite. when he stays dormat when i move my finger i give him mullet but he's still not fond of the finger. Should I blow at him to correct this habbit?"
parrots,3dzdzc,rougefleurette,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:00 2015 UTC,"It's normal for them to take naps during the day. Take a look at this page to make sure he's not exhibiting these symptoms: http://www.cockatielcottage.net/symptoms.html  I wouldn't blow at him. I don't advise negative reinforcement for birds, positive reinforcement only! Best thing to do is to stop giving him attention and walk away when he bites. When he hisses, you need to be very gentle and encouraging. Use his name, reassure him, but don't use ""shushing"" sounds (they consider this threatening). Move slowly until he calms down."

parrots,3dzer6,Sooawesome36,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:50 2015 UTC,"Stress bars happen during the development of the feather, so that won't be the cause.  What you're seeing is just damage and wear & tear caused by the tail coming into contact with the cage, perches, or toys. It often happens when cages are too small, cluttered, or if the bird likes climbing on the cage bars.   No need to worry. :)"

parrots,3dzer6,crackofdawn,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:48 2015 UTC,"Just looks like the tail feather was poked through the bars of the cage a bunch of times which frayed them...no big deal (and for whatever reason I've noticed this on GCCs more than any other type of parrot, not sure why).  Stress bars are black lines that appear on the feathers (like someone literally drew a small black line across the feather, usually spaced out periodically)."
parrots,3dzer6,SamusAran388,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"I agree, the tattered looking feathers look like the result of them hitting up against the bars of the cage or her perches. The bars on the feathers themselves look like slight stress bars.  They don't look serious though. Like /u/painesgrey says stress bars develop while the feather is being formed. So you'd have to think back to what was going on around the time those feathers were probably forming. A few stress bars aren't anything to beat yourself up over though. It's hard to know what will upset our birds. I don't think I'd worry about it too much unless you start to see more of them. More specifically if you see more of them on her feathers after her next molt. Then you'll have to re-evaluate her living situation and diet. Possibly consult your vet if you can't come up with anything obvious as to what could be the factors that are stressing her out. I feel like taking your bird to the vet for it's annual check up is like going to the dentist. You try really hard not to get a cavity, but it seems like no matter what they always find one. I thought for sure after a few years of ownership the vet wouldn't find a single stress bar, but she found I think one last time, but she said not to worry about it and overall my bird looked healthy and happy.   Perhaps something to bring up at your next annual visit with the vet."

Kevin has been lovely so far: smaller than true toucans (he's technically an aracari) so a lot more manageable (especially in terms of the required space), calm, low maintenance when it comes to attention, and a big goofball.

parrots,3dwcwk,hzaybek,8,Mon Jul 20 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"Where are you located?   It's in everyone's best interest to do a ton of research before getting a bird. Their lifespans and intelligence make them a far greater commitment than most other pets.   You need to determine the following:   How much space are you able to give the birds? Bigger birds need massive cages, and ideally both birds should have their own cage (even if they get along).  Is noise going to be an issue for neighbors? Some species have more vocalizations than others, with big birds pumping out some crazy decibels.  How much free time will be devoted to the birds? Ideally, these birds should be spending most of their days outside of their cages, on perches or playstands where they can socialize with other members of the household. 9-5 work schedules and school can conflict with this, even if the birds have each other for company. What are you looking for in a bird? Appearance? Vocabulary? There are a ton of birds out there to choose from with vastly different personalities and habits. Don't choose a bird based on its size - there are plenty of little birds with BIG personalities.    Make sure you've thoroughly researched the type of bird you want. Parrots are a huge undertaking, and starting off the relationship with regret or ""what monster have I brought into my house?"" will make it hard for everyone."

Greys are just famous for their ability to make them at a volume that rivals the airport.  Up to you on if you want to go with babies or a rescue.  Both my birds are rescues and they worked out really, really nicely with my family.    Either way - I would really strongly suggest going to a rescue and not thinking about what kind of bird you want - but seeing which one really clicks with you.  They tend to pick out certain people to adore and sometimes they'll just latch onto you on the spot and make your heart melt."
parrots,3dwcwk,painesgrey,2,Mon Jul 20 05:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that does sound like a better idea, I'll run down to some rescues when I'm off and see what happens :)"
parrots,3dwcwk,MikeBenza,3,Mon Jul 20 05:55:11 2015 UTC,"Volunteering or hanging out at rescues is IMO the best way to figure out which size and species of bird you are ready to handle. It sounds like you are really eager to jump into parrot ownership but considering this is a hefty (at least 20-30 yr) commitment, it wouldn't hurt to take things slow.   For example, working at a zoo for 4 years with dozens of cockatoos, macaws, and amazons, I can firmly say that I am not (and may not ever be) ready for that kind of responsibility, nor am I fond of the insane levels of noise these birds can make.   Finally, not only will more hands-on big bird experience help you make a better informed decision, but you can see if there are birds in need of good homes that you mesh well with. You will see that you should never get a bird because you want it to talk, as there will always be a subset of Greys, Quakers, etc that never do. You will also see that no matter how hard we try, most birds will pick up annoying noises whether we like it or not. :P   Even if you don't go with a rescue, I would look into finding a reputable breeder online or in your area. I really dislike breeders on CL, who are more often than not people breeding their pets on a whim to make a quick buck. Sites like birdbreeders.com can be good jumping off points for this."

parrots,3dwcwk,LopsidedMidget,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"Most parrots can have some degree of speaking ability, but it depends a lot on the individual bird and its training. You could very well get a species known for talking that just doesn't want to talk.  In my experience, the best talkers are Quakers, Amazons, and African Greys. Each has their own virtues and vices.   Quakers tend to be far more manageable than their bigger counterparts, with shorter lifespans (20-30) that some people may prefer over the longer-lived Amazons (up to 60) and Greys (50-70). They have the tendency of becoming territorial with their cages, which may be an issue for owners and other birds.  Amazons can have incredibly clear voices and singing ability, but have the tendency to become aggressive/nippy, destructive, and noisy if not given proper care, attention, or training. Their general noise level is usually higher than that of a Quaker.  African Greys are highly intelligent, and boredom in these birds very quickly leads to behavioral problems such as plucking.   I think it would be wise to contact some area rescues. They can provide information on the individual birds they have to offer, and will likely have your family come in for introductions. There's no way in knowing how well a parrot is going to fit into your family until you meet the parrot you want to bring home.   Here are a few rescues I found in Texas:  http://bird.rescueme.org/Texas  http://bird-haven.org/  http://www.adoptapet.com/adoption_rescue/83597.html  http://www.starescue.org/  http://kanekareexoticanimalsandbirdrefuge.yolasite.com/  https://www.facebook.com/groups/POPBirdRescue/  http://www.parrotfestival.org/"

parrots,3dtiv0,budgiebum,7,Sun Jul 19 08:41:57 2015 UTC,In case anyone was wondering....  I'm a merchant on Amazon and I can tell you right now that is not Amazon's fault. It's some shitty merchant trying to make it look like you're getting a great deal. Merchants do have power to change list prices like that so they can show a larger % off. This one is obviously false but on a lot of other items it may be harder to tell and it's hard for Amazon to police. Next time you see a huge cage displayed as 50% off or whatever do some more research first. It's probably not a real deal at all.
parrots,3dtiv0,ff14person,3,Sun Jul 19 14:33:21 2015 UTC,You mean I'm not getting a good deal when an item is listed for $1.99 with a $15.99 shipping fee? ;)  Does Amazon do anything about this stuff? Is there a way to report it?

parrots,3dtiv0,luxdesigns,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:37 2015 UTC,To appeal to people who don't check facts on Prime Day?
parrots,3dwbf8,brotogeris1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"What are you  currently feeding?  Cost depends on the kind of bird you're feeding, and what kind of food you're feeding them. Yes, a lot of the premium pellets are expensive, but they tend to be the most commercially-available completely balanced diet. There also tends to be far less waste with pellets, if you feed appropriate amounts.   I buy a lot of my pellets (roudybush, zupreem) and treats (nutriberries/avicakes) from amazon. Most of the prices are reasonable and slightly cheaper than local stores, and shipping is free with prime."
parrots,3dwbf8,painesgrey,2,Mon Jul 20 02:11:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should specify how many birds/what you are feeding.   I usually shop at a few different places for bird food, including drfostersmith.com, mysafebirdstore.com, Amazon, and each seller's personal website. The first two sites have always been the cheapest AND had the best selection; though you have to pay for shipping I've found the total price comparable to Amazon whose products are just slightly more expensive but come with free shipping with prime.  To cut costs further you can also buy in bulk (freezing any food that isn't going to be consumed within the next month or so), buy during sales (mysafebirdstore and drfostersmith are having/had summer sales; they also have discounts during some holidays), and portion your food correctly so you have less waste. For example, my little birds eat only 1 tsp of pellets per day. By giving them an exact amount instead of just filling up their bowl, one small bag of pellets can easily last for 6 months or more.   Finally, the prices of pet food will rise an fall with the prices of their ingredients. An extra $8 isn't bad at all in this case, especially if you are only buying a few times a year."
parrots,3dumal,an_outstanding_user,4,Sun Jul 19 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"Sometimes allowing birds to nest can promote hormonal behaviors. In some birds it's not much of a problem, but in others it can lead to egg laying (and the chance of egg binding), or other territorial/hormonal behaviors like aggression.   There are a few ways you can try to discourage the behavior:   Make her nights longer. Try to get her to bed early, to mimic her sleep cycle in the winter. Just keep in mind that she needs quiet as well as darkness. Sometimes closets or unused bathrooms can be handy for this. Try to limit her access to spots where she tends to want to nest, as well as to the materials she's nesting with.  Rearrange her cage, or move the cage altogether.    As for her diet, seed diets tend to need supplements to provide balanced nutrition. Unfortunately, birds have the habit of choosing the tastiest, fattiest seeds, and often neglect the vitamin-rich supplements.   It's a good idea to try to switch her over to a more balanced diet. Pelleted diets tend to be the most ideal (Roudybush, Harrison's, Zupreem), though a mix of both pellets and seeds (Lafeber's Nutriberries or Avicakes) is certainly a viable diet.   In addition to pellets, she should be getting fresh fruits and vegetables regularly.   A diet that is high in fat and protein, like a seed diet, can also contribute to breeding hormones. You may find that a more balanced, less fatty diet may help her hormones as well as be healthier for her overall."
parrots,3dumal,painesgrey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's just that she seems so obsessed and entertained, we even put her some wood and hard paper to destroy, she has this available all year, she just loves to destroy. But when she nests, she uses this material.   She's got too many spots available, also a small wooden birdhouse we built too. But she likes to build her own nests in some small space, or carve some shoe box. If she wants she will find a place anyway I think. But I'll try to limit this  I'm not sure if destroying what she builds would make her sad, it seems cruel. But I guess this is what you are advising  She doesn't use her big cage at all, except at night to sleep in some perches in a corner of it. We don't like her in a cage where she can't fly, and she starts protesting in the morning like a prisoner banging the cell bars  We found her, and she has bad habits already hard to change.  A couple of years ago, she nested in a box, she took about one month building and stealing anything she could to put inside, that was funny. And then she spent almost all days inside for some weeks.   Then one day, I saw her perched on a stick, and she had dropped and crashed an egg. Maybe she though she was just taking a shit, or it was an accident. But at least that was it, and stopped being aggressive and reclusive. We found out she was a ""she"" because of the egg  About diet, she's spoiled, and eats what she wants, she has a mix of seeds and vitamin pellets, but she eats just what she likes from it. Almost no fruit at all, she doesn't like it. Except lettuce, and sometimes a couple of grains of pomegranate when we get some, and on a rare occasion some grape. She doesn't seem to like anything else. She also perches on your shoulder and destroys your clothes to ask you for millet  She sleeps fine, without noise or light, but it's hard to put her inside the cage if there's day light. I'll try to prolong sleep too  Thanks for the ideas"

Kind of ruins it for the rest of us that are just out there to enjoy and socialize with the birds.  I would urge them to network with other pet stores in the area. I worked in a pet store when I was in college, and one of our competitors called us after having a bird stolen. No less than an hour later, the thieves came into the store looking for information on the bird's species and needing supplies. We managed to get their phone number (under the pretense of doing extra research on the bird's species/care), which was relayed to authorities.   I'm not sure what came of it, but it can't hurt to try. In the very least, maybe they can provide better security footage that will help in identification."

parrots,3ds8fg,ArcadeRenegade,2,Sun Jul 19 04:28:53 2015 UTC,"I would say it's very effective!   For this I started initially with just clicking and rewarding maybe for a couple of days just to get him to understand a click means a reward. Then I used a targeting technique using a chopstick (target stick), you say the command target (or whatever command you like) and put the tip of the stick in his sight, if he touches the end of the stick I click and reward. Once he knows this then and is walking a good distance to come touch the stick you can start making him fly a small distance to the target stick so he gets used to that. Then you can target him to your arm and instead of saying target say his name so he gets used to the command, and do the same for the perch, target him there off of you and say ""perch"" or whatever you want the command to, be gradually you can remove the target stick and just use the commands and slowly increase the distance. It sounds like a slow process but they pick it up fast as long as you take it step by step and don't try to do more than they understand. Train with them once or twice a day when they want the treats (otherwise they won't have any motivation to do what you want).  That's the basics anyways, I essentially learnt everything from http://trainedparrot.com/ there's allot of great content there it's just not very chronological, I imagine his book would be a good buy for something laid out a but more clearly, I'll pick one up eventually.

parrots,3dnsz1,hungry-space-lizard,6,Fri Jul 17 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"Accompanying story:  So… yesterday, we had to separate our two new tiels. (we bought them from someone selling them away, we figured we could take better care of them, than anyone else in the neighborhood they were being sold in... we see it as a sort of rescue)   They were just fighting too much. This one here, is a bully to everyone. He (or she) is just incessantly mean to the budgies when they land on her/his cage. Beak open, aggressive. She pecks the other poor tiel (though he doesn’t have any missing feathers, so it’s just pecking without plucking?) whenever he (grey tiel) lets his guard down. (he also seems to have a foot problem that we swear is a new development, and trying to do research into this was been… unsuccessful to say. It’s like bent inwards when he walks on flat surfaces or cage roofs sometimes? Perches are fine.)  This has made him (the grey tiel, not pictured here) very defensive and just untrusting of everything. (tho he doesn’t particularly have a problem with the budgies, mostly. There were some instances of disrespected self-bubble popping from the budges.)  Anyway, this one here, i’ve been trying to train. Using perches to step up onto those. Then from the perch to a finger, and lookit what I diiiid. The angry bully is on my fingerrrr.   So it’s a lose/lose/win situation."

There are points where they like to spend their time, so the areas to be addressed don't really move around.  We purchased some vinyl floor runners from Home Depot, put it down under those locations,  and thrown them in the shower to be sprayed off after Birdie Bed time. takes 5 minutes, and we put them back down the next morning before I let them back out.  The only down side is that the Macaws think the runners are bird toys and tear up the edges.  Which means they get rotated, trimmed, and replaced every so often (about every 6 - 8 weeks we buy a new 2' length, and rotate the remainders to the smaller locations."

parrots,3dntqk,vaqari,3,Fri Jul 17 19:59:50 2015 UTC,"Brooding with a cage mate is stressful, i do recommend you seperate her. Make sure she has no materials to trigger her nesting (i.e. paper,  anything tearable.) Make sure she is getting a well rounded diet (i switched my teal to pellets and she hasn't laid since ¯_(ツ)_/¯.) Also, don't pet below the neck. If they are laying eggs you should generally let them lay on them for about 28 days or until they lose interest. Make sure to include a cuttlebone and plenty of calcium rich foods (dark leafy greens and so on). My cockatiel got so low on calcium that i needed to take her to the vet for calcium and vitamin shots. Also make sure she has plenty of water near her. That's all I can think of."

She's our only parrot, so there's no mate for her aside from my SO. She's strictly on a diet of pellets/veggies (no seeds or mushy veggies), we've shortened her daylight hours, decreased handling time with SO, and she has no access to anything that might be a nest or nesting materials.  Tango gets so bad that we have to do the Lupron injections. So far, a single, very low dose has been enough to break the hormonal behavior and bring her closer to being her normal self. She has to get a full exam by her avian vet in order to get the Lupron injection just in case there is something more sinister going on in her little body.

parrots,3dp075,ottawawah,2,Sat Jul 18 01:59:22 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions:  1) Grapefruit seed extract, apple cider vinegar, etc is not necessary. It is supposed to decrease bacterial/mold growth so I used it for a while in the beginning but after stopping a year ago and seeing no difference in my sprouting... not worth.   2) Regular bird seed can, in theory, be sprouted but there are a couple reasons why I stopped using it after a month or so. First, the whole seed mix, or select types of seed in the mix, are often not fresh. After sitting for months on a pet store shelf they become old and won't sprout. Sprouting old seed is the best way to get rotten/moldy and bacteria-laden seed, so it should be avoided. Second, the mixes aren't as clean, the ingredients not as high of quality, and they contain many ingredients that have to be removed (dried fruit/veggies, pellets, broken seed). Because of all of these troubles, in the end it really is easier to get a quality human-grade mixture. My absolute favorite is the https://sproutpeople.org/just-for-pets/bird-seed-mixes/. It is clean, guaranteed to sprout, and contains a great mix of healthy grains, seeds, and legumes.  Here is a quick write-up I did for a previous post:   For a small bird (budgie, parrotlet, etc) I sprout 1 tbsp of dry seed at a time and it lasts almost a week (feeding 1 tsp per day). In general sprouts can easily last over a week as long as they still have moisture to grow (you'll just end up with lots of leaves and stems after a while).  Basically after soaking I let them germinate for a day then store them in a small tupperware in the fridge. This slows down their growth so the roots stay small (the way my birds like them) and they also don't dry out. I used to store them in their sprouting jar in the fridge but then you have to rinse them once a day to keep them damp.  I offer sprouts, pellets, fruit/veg, and treats all in separate dishes, but you can mix the sprouts into your chop (as it can encourage birds to eat their vegetables).  A couple last tips:  1) You don't need fancy sprouting trays or cups to be successful, just a wide-mouth mason jar and a $5 plastic sprouting lid (can be found on Amazon).  2) I have found that soaking the Lil bird Mix for at least 12 hrs yields the best results. They say you can do it for as little as 8hr but sometimes the harder legumes, lentils, rice, etc don't sprout as reliably.  3) Play around with how long you let your sprouts grow before serving them to see what your birds like best. For example, my birds like them best when they are still very ""seed-like"" and only have a tiny root tip visible. But your birds might like them with longer roots or even spread across a bit of soil so they grow leaves and stems! Finally, the sprouts will continue to grow in the fridge so stopping them 12hrs to a day early can keep them at the desired growth stage longer.  4) My steps: 1) Soak for 12 hrs. 2) Drain and rinse 1-2 times, let sit in drying rack (or inverted and tilted not a counter) for good draining/circulation 3) 12 hrs later rinse/drain once 4) 12 hrs later move to tupperware and fridge. I found that rinsing them multiple times, swirling them for 5 mins to drain, etc like the sprout people website says is not necessary and save some time and effort. Also, you want to let the sprouts dry for 12 hrs or so before putting them in the fridge (soaking wet sprouts = mold) so no rinse before storage.   It's a lot of info but I hope it helps! Again, I think a big thing to remember is that sprouting or germinating seed should not be difficult. It sounds like some sort of scary science at first but it's honestly the easiest part of my bird-food routine."
parrots,3dp075,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:12:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. This is exactly the advice I was looking for. None of the sites I've researched so far have said you could continue slowly growing them in the fridge! I never would have thought of using the fridge for preservation.   I've heard of allowing the seeds to soak in 1/10 diluted bleach for 2 minutes and rinsing helps eliminate fungus and mold, have you tried this before or found the step unnecessary. This is the part I'm worried about, I don't want my birds coming into any sort of contact with bleach."
parrots,3dp075,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, the fridge will be your best friend if you are feeding small birds like me! Because the seeds/grains/legumes plump up so much during germination (i.e. the soaking period) you will be surprised how long a bag of sprouting mix lasts! Even feeding them every day I've still not finished the 1lb bag of Sprout People mix I ordered 6 months ago.  Another thing to keep in mind when sprouting is the relative humidity/temperature of your home. I live in the NE where we have cold, dry winters. During this time I had to adjust my routine to allow the sprouts more time to grow, as well as rinse them more frequently to prevent them from drying out. Now that it's summer though, the humidity is through the roof, and the warm temps mean I only have to do one rinse/dry after the first soak before getting the sprouts in the fridge.    Finally, like you, I would never use bleach around food I prepare for my birds. So no, I have not tried that method, but I can assure you using apple cider vinegar or GSE works just as well. At MOST I have use a tiny drip of bleach with lots of water to sterilize my sprouting (mason) jar (and then let it dry thoroughly before use), but with/without this step I have seen no difference in my sprouting performance.   This is my $0.02. All of these rinse additions are used for one purpose: to prevent mold or bacteria growth. The thing is, in all of my time sprouting the ONLY time I've ever seen mold growth is when I was sprouting ""pet store"" bird seed mixes (and more specifically the Volkman's A.S.D. Parrotlet food). In that mix not only was there a ton of ingredients other than sproutable seed (dried veggies, cracked corn, etc), but its true quality was revealed after none of the millet, oat grouts, or rice sprouted. What that left then was soggy seed that slowly rotted away, encouraging all of that nasty mold. ACV helped keep it clean long enough to consume in the first couple days (I actually just added a tbsp of the stuff to my soaking water), but I never kept the sprouts longer than that.  IMO the best way to prevent mold and bacteria is buying quality ingredients. Sure bird seed is cheap, but spending that couple extra bucks on human-grade, cleaned and tested seed mixes has not only cut down on the hassle of preparing sprouts safety, but kept my peace of mind. Not to mention their nutritional value is guaranteed to be the highest available, and since we are going to all the trouble of offering sprouts to our birds in the first place, isn't that the whole point? If you don't get your mix from Sprout People (my fav simply because of their variety and dedication to quality), then look at health food stores, Amazon.com, etc. Good luck!"

parrots,3dp075,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"Lol my budgie's diet is the biggest source of headache and frustration out of all my birds atm. They are all Petsmart/Petco birds, relatively untamed, and so are still very much in the mindset that their diet would be fine if it consisted of nothing but millet and cheap seed mix. Like yours they are similarly resistant to fresh foods. What they will eat: carrots (grated only), leafy greens that are wet and strung through the cage bars (but NOT kale, it's too tough), broccoli crowns, zucchini/sweet potato (again must be grated), and bell pepper seeds (but not the flesh). No fruits at all, other than the occasional nibble of strawberry.   Offering them fresh sprouts as a portion of their vegetal diet has helped a lot recently. Two of them also (grudgingly) eat some pellets, while they all love crushed nutriberries. It's not optimal in my book, but they've come so far from their pet store days and I do think their diet is well-rounded enough that they will live to ripe old ages."

parrots,3dmbv8,emilycloud,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:15:40 2015 UTC,My caique is a handful but no more than any other bird. She loves meeting new people and is relatively quite. Complete ball of energy and cuddling with her is closer to wrestling than anything. Never had another bird so I can't attest to anything else but I'm very happy with my caique. Good luck choosing your new friend.
parrots,3dmbv8,durling_md,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"My caique is also a socialite - enjoying good relationships with my family members, and attention from friends. He has a very loud scream, but rarely uses it. He tends to be quiet (though lives in a relatively quiet household) and uses whistles and clicks. He is exceedingly playful. All of this seems to be pretty normal for caiques."

parrots,3dkqr0,hafgrimm,6,Fri Jul 17 01:42:30 2015 UTC,Adding a pic of the new toy / reason for bird distress.  A rotten nut from this new toy bought at local pet shop...  Imgur
parrots,3dkqr0,darkling-light,3,Fri Jul 17 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"While owning a parrot IS expensive... Particularly vet bills.... What ARE you all doing for toys and stands?! I got a huge 6ft high cage online for $140 and pay very little for toys (that said, my bird isn't the biggest chewer). My stands are cobbled together from ferret/cat toys and hardware store products. I buy toys regularly, but rarely any over $15 (I shopped around till I find a good store) and make extra chew toys from whatever is lying around. No way I spend more than $20 on toys a month (and believe me, he has LOTS)."
parrots,3dkqr0,painesgrey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:01:58 2015 UTC,"There are a couple regular pet stores around me that have the run of the mill parrot toys, not exactly cheap.  On my birthday I went down to Chicago to a place I kept ordering odds and ends from windycityparrot.com and I was in heaven.  Had to force myself to leave... Spent close to $200.  But I got toys, sprouting mix, rope, coconut, chew toy parts... the list goes on and on.    I do make quite a bit of the toys now, but some you just gotta get... lol   The vet actually gave me a new idea yesterday.  Take a 2x4, drill holes in it and hammer in some nutritreats.  Let them go wild shredding the wood to get to the treats..."
parrots,3dkqr0,peony33,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:17 2015 UTC,"Veterinary bills are no joke, and exotic bills can be a shock. Most people don't realise that a routine vet visit will cost twice as much for a bird than for a dog or cat.   So many people are reluctant to have their animals seen by vets because of the financial burden, and in the end it's the animals that pay. There are so many options out there for financing (care credit, and even vets themselves will often work out payment plans), that it just saddens me that people wouldn't think that the animal's well-being is worth it.  I'm sorry about what you're going through. It's good that you got her into the vet quickly, though. If she was allowed to come home with you, then I think the prognosis is probably pretty good. I imagine you're watching her like a hawk. I know I would be. :(  Hope she gets to feeling better soon."
parrots,3dkqr0,Acurtin75,4,Fri Jul 17 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"Whenever people see my bird and say, ""Omg now I need a parrot."" I jokingly-seriously say, ""Sure, if you can afford $80 in toys every few weeks, $75 in food per month, a $400 cage and $200 vet bills yearly. That's not even getting into the one-on-one time they need each day!"""
parrots,3dkqr0,crackofdawn,2,Fri Jul 17 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size too.. We have a umbrella cockatoo and she can turn a 20$ toy into a shredded mess within 5 minutes, she's also picky and only eats expensive fruits and nuts. Still cheaper than a kid lol."
parrots,3dkqr0,peony33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:33:33 2015 UTC,"Wow what is your parrot eating that costs $75/month?  Our pellets/seed cost around $3/month total and then I would add maybe $5/month in for the various fruits/veggies we feed her, so $8/mo on average.  My 70 lb boxer doesn't even eat $75/month in food and we buy her really high end dog food."
parrots,3dkqr0,redneckrockuhtree,3,Fri Jul 17 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"He's a lorikeet and eats powdered nectar. It's about  $55 a bag, and the other $20 comes from supplemental fruits and veggies throughout the month (he can eat a whole apple in one day). :)"

parrots,3dkqr0,Fatdude3,2,Sat Jul 18 02:35:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, having a pet, any pet can be expensive."
parrots,3dkqr0,parrottail,2,Fri Jul 17 11:52:41 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the bird.  Aside from ~$12 every 2-3 months for pellets, $10 every 6 months for a pack of mixed seed, and the random fruits/veggies my bird eats, there aren't any other food costs.  My bird is not a destroyer so toys can be rotated and the only ones that ever get destroyed are the ones that are made out of cardboard/etc.  Vet bills can be expensive for any animal of course if something goes really wrong.  Aside from a checkup every 2 years which costs I think $65 we haven't spent any money at the vet for our bird.  I built by myself 3 stands for our Quaker when we first got her and we're still using those stands today 3 years later, total cost for those was probably $100-120 and they're really large/complex stands (PVC, twine, toys, rope ladders, food/water dishes, etc etc).  If I had to average our monthly bird expenses I would put them at less than $15, and I would say in the first month of ownership we probably spent $300 (cage, stand equipment, toys, etc).  It's different for everyone of course but any pet can be expensive or cheap, it just depends on the specific pet."

parrots,3dieve,RagingMuppet,4,Thu Jul 16 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"My Simon get the same sort of unexpected fixations all the time. If it's not chewing the desk chair, it's the lamp. If not the blinds, then the paint on the walls, etc, etc. Whenever he picks his next target it's full steam ahead, you-can't-stop-me-I-do-what-I-want, stubborn parrotlet obsession for the next few days or so until it gets out of his system. If I am not actively holding/supervising him he does the same as your GCC and goes right back to them as if pulled by a magnet.   What helps me (and may work for you):  1) Teaching him the word NO. Positive reinforcement of good behavior (playing or sitting nicely) and negative punishment after bad behavior (returning him to his cage for a 5 min time-out) has taught Simon that NO said in a stern voice is not good. He's great about listening to it 90% of the time, and will either freeze and stop what he's doing (thus earning lots of praise and attention) or fly away from the object in question, if he hears it. The last 10% of the time he may continue to chew and that earns him another time-out.   2) Redirection.  and  3) Eliminating the appeal items.   The desk chair was Simon's target about two weeks ago. Instead of sitting nicely on your shoulder like he had done for the past year he decided he needed to punch little holes in the pleather. He would NOT STOP, and in this case NO wasn't working so well (maybe only 50% of the time). So to fix things we cover the back of the chair with a blanket (eliminating the interest) and gave him a few hair ties to dismantle instead (redirecting his fury). After a day or so he lost interest, and now even the uncovered chair is safe again.  Hopefully some of these tips work for you. In your case, I might try removing all jewelry for a while to eliminate his interest, then slowly reintroduce it while using lots of positive reinforcement when he ignores them. Just remember the key to training is consistency. Good luck!"
parrots,3dieve,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:49:46 2015 UTC,"THIS. eliminate the opportunity. The act is reinforcing for him, so every time he does it, he wants to do it more. Teach him some tricks and then ask him to do one whoever he shows interest in your ear or nose - basically redirect him and provide something as(or more)  interesting to do. Don't just use step up, or one trick. Keep it fun for him. Only allow him near your face when he is tired and just wishes to snuggle with you. Praise the snuggles. Face /shoulder is for cuddle time, elsewhere is for play. I know of some people who have made bird ponchos with buttons, etc to play with. Personally I am not sure if I want to encourage clothing nibbling, but I do think they are smart enough to learn to isolate to just the poncho.  All that said, good luck - I've never gotten my bird to give up on glasses. He adores swinging on them, and will make a bee line for any pair as soon as his attention isn't focused!"

We also say ""night night"" when we put her away for the night, so if she wants a quiet place to sleep, she can say that.

She'll be walking around the front of her cage repeatedly saying ""Step up, step up, step up"" until we come and pick her up.  So I guess I would say go with things that mean something. Having a pet that's actually able to verbally communicate its wants and needs is a wonderful thing."
parrots,3dhiqc,LostxinthexMusic,2,Thu Jul 16 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"I have been saying ""goodnight/goodbye"" lately when I put him in his cage for the night, I'll give that one more of a go.  The go poop one is a great idea! I guess it can also be used the other way around for when you want them to go, like with dogs and stuff. I can usually tell when they're about to go by the little poop stance they do, but a verbal warning would be nice!"

parrots,3dh3i4,TibbersTeaParty,5,Thu Jul 16 05:42:04 2015 UTC,"Taking on a parrot is a huge undertaking and not to be taken lightly.   The first things you need to ask yourself are:   Am I financially equipped to care for a parrot? Food, toys, and even routine vet visits can be expensive (exotic vets cost much more than regular vets), and emergencies can easily cost hundreds. Don't take on the responsibility of a bird if you're not financially capable of caring for him in the best and worst of times. Is my home suitable for a parrot? African greys are noisy birds, and their incessant beeps, boops, and squawks can easily pierce shared walls. Only consider taking him in if you're going to be living in a place that not only accepts birds, but also where he will not be an annoyance for neighbors and roommates. Keep in mind that space can easily become an issue. An appropriate-sized cage for an African grey can take up quite a bit of space, and ideally he should have perches and stands outside of his cage as well.  Do I have a parrot-friendly work schedule? All parrots require a lot of time and dedication. Ideally he should be getting hours of quality, one-on-one time outside of his cage on a daily basis. Lonely birds quickly develop behavioral problems, such as plucking. African greys tend to be especially prone to this.   Taking on a parrot is like taking on a child... for decades. They are intelligent, complex creatures that depend solely on you for care, entertainment, and companionship. Parrots that have lived in less-than-ideal conditions add another facet onto their care: rehabilitation. It's one thing to take a young bird and train it, but it's a different beast to take on a parrot that has become distrusting, or outright fearful, of human interaction. Keep this in mind if you choose to take him, and be prepared to spill a lot of blood spend a lot of time trying to win him over.  In these situations, the needs of the bird should come first. If you take him and try to ""make it work"", then you're not doing the bird or yourself any favors."
parrots,3dh3i4,painesgrey,2,Thu Jul 16 06:44:06 2015 UTC,"I've been around him all of my life... I know what it takes to provide basic care for him. Maybe I worded my question wrong, but I'm asking how to help him become less timid and scared of everything. He doesn't let anyone really handle him other than my dad."
parrots,3dh3i4,painesgrey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:34:30 2015 UTC,"Oh! Sorry, I probably misinterpreted your post.   You're going to need a lot of time, patience, and treats. It's going to be stressful for him moving into a new environment, so trying to win him over during that period will be difficult. Usually it's best to let them get adjusted to new homes/surroundings before adding the stresses of training/handling.  The best thing you can do is to spend time around him, without pressing him to actually interact with you. Spend time by his cage reading or watching television, so he gets accustomed to your presence. Talk to him a lot, so he gets used to your voice. Avoid quick movements that may startle him, and don't forcibly handle him (toweling or grabbing). Forcing him to do anything is going to exacerbate his fear.  The most important thing is to keep interactions as positive and pleasant for him as possible. Offer him his favourite treats whenever you are changing food/water or cleaning the cage. The more he associates you with good things, the less fearful he will become.  The less fearful he is of you, the easier it will be to handle him. If he is fearful of your hand, try coaxing him onto perches with his favourite treats. Over time, move your hand closer and leave him with a shorter length of the perch to step onto. Don't be surprised if you get a few warning nips/lunges in the process.  Just remember that he is likely acting out of fear, not aggression (barring territorial behavior, which is another issue) or malice. Once you can pinpoint the sources of the fear you can help him work through them with diligence, patience, and lots of tasty treats."

parrots,3dgh9n,placenta_jerky,6,Thu Jul 16 02:10:12 2015 UTC,"Kudos to you for being honest about your commitments. Unfortunately I think 18 hrs away from a bird on a regular basis is too long, and anything close to 24 or 36 hrs calls for a quick check-in from a friend or bird-sitter at the least. Call me overly cautious but an unforeseen accident could happen at any time, and you don't want to find out 12 hrs later that it could have been easily prevented.  Aside from obvious safety reasons a few more of my concerns would be:   Birds thrive on consistency. This means having regular feeding, play, and bed times.   There is no way you can feed a varied and balanced diet if you can't come and change the food/water at least once a day. Especially in warmer weather, fresh foods go bad, attract pests, etc after just a few hours, and you wouldn't be a very responsible owner if you just fed them seed/pellets the whole time to get around that. Not to mention if your bird turns out to be a ""dunker"" or poops in his dishes. Sometimes I am changing my bird's food/water dishes 3 or 4 times a day because they are being soiled.  Your budgies may be alright because they have each other but a single parrot will not be okay being left alone and cooped up in its cage for days on end. Basically, if you or someone else can't follow the general rules - at least 1-2 hrs of socialization per day for smaller birds and 3-4 hrs per day for larger - then getting a bird should be off the table. These animals are extremely social, complex, and emotional; in the same way that it would be cruel to lock a toddler in a closet for days, it would be cruel to subject a parrot to the same treatment.    And these are just the bare minimum responsibilities of parrot ownership. Sorry if this isn't what you want to hear. It's just that I know my tiny parrotlet and relatively independent aracari start going stir-crazy if left alone for even a long work-day. They would be extremely unhappy (an probably act up) if left alone for more than than on a regular basis, so I know a larger bird won't fare much better. IMO you should definitely hold off on any more birds until you find yourself with a more consistent (and bird-friendly) schedule."
parrots,3dgh9n,budgiefacedkiller,2,Thu Jul 16 03:41:43 2015 UTC,"I know the importance of socializing my birds- back when I had a cockatiel, he would ride around on my shoulder practically all day while I did house stuff!   Thanks for the frank reply, though- that's why I posted in the first place. Sigh. I guess I was holding on to the hope that I could more than make up for it on the 5 days a week that I don't spend working all day, but that's not exactly fair either, I suppose.

I've been in a similar situation, having had to wait a year and a half before the time was right to get my parrotlet. It sure was agonizing, dreaming about my future fid and watching all of the happy parronts on this sub. :P  Since you will have some free time, do you think you could go hang out with a local rescue or bird club?

The other became extremely ill and at the last minute they figured out the bird was extremely dehydrated. It turns out the user had switched to one of those water bottles and neither bird was drinking from it. It's not necessarily intuitive for an animal.
parrots,3dgh9n,painesgrey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"If you are going to use a small animal water bottle then make sure you have a bowl of water out as well just in case. The water bowl is for dunking, the small animal water bottle is for drinking. I've seen my GCC dunk his food in his water bowl and then run up and get a drink of water from the water bottle. My only beef with those small animal water bottles is you have to really swab out the metal tube to make sure there isn't crud growing up in there.   I only added it because once my GCC makes a nasty soup out of his water dish he doesn't really like to drink out of it. The water bottle is a back up water source."

parrots,3dfsqj,irishayes86,2,Thu Jul 16 01:08:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Better safe than sorry.   That being said, I noticed that the beak moments had a different frequency than the breathing.

I've seen Falco and gizmo do it before after a beak trim or after having a juicy or sticky snack.   Have to ask, when was his last checkup?"

I've been keeping an eye on him all day and took him out again just a little while ago, and he isn't panting anymore. He got bananas today for his fruit and he eats basically all day (fat little shit) so it would explain him trying to lick his beak.

parrots,3deusg,TorchIt,7,Wed Jul 15 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"Do I bring him home and try to nurse him until he's ready for release?   No.   If you're worried that he's ill, put him in a box and keep him in a quiet, dark room. Contact a local wildlife rehabilitator and arrange for them to care for the bird.  It's difficult, not to mention illegal in most cases, to care for birds without proper experience, training, and resources. It's inadvisable to do it yourself."

I'm not particularly crafty but even just buying some replacement parts (like the seagrass mats, porcupine chews, palm fiber shredders, corks, etc) and replacing them once they've been destroyed on the original toy saves a lot of money. In this way I get away with buying a set of brand-new, pre-made toys once every two months. In the meantime I repurpose old toys to make them exciting again or replace the worn bits on others."

parrots,3da920,So_Motarded,3,Tue Jul 14 20:02:55 2015 UTC,Man what's it like living with a Macaw? Is it your only bird or do you have multiple birds?
parrots,3da920,thebbman,9,Tue Jul 14 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"He's an only child (aside from an iguana) because our apartment is just too small for more than one cage.    What's it like?  It's like a lot of things.  It's a little like having a kid, but easier in many ways (to me, at least).  It's so much fun, and it's a lot of work.    My husband and I have to put in quite a bit of effort to make sure Sparky is happy and healthy, but it's just become part of the routine.  Have to keep the cage/perch clean, his food fresh and varied, his toys rotated and fun, give him showers (so much fun), and make sure he has regular training sessions (he loves the one-on-one attention).    There are a lot of extra little things we do to make sure he's happy, like going on walks, going to the park, making foraging toys and puzzles for his cage, singing to him, and of course playing with him.  But that's all part of the fun for me!  He's such a fun bundle of energy; he only needs about an hour each day of high-energy stimulation.  After that, he's done and ready to be lazy.  He's a bit of a ""perch potato"".    Sometimes he gets a little neurotic or cranky (especially if it's been an exciting day and it's getting close to bedtime).  Sometimes he screams, but that's usually because he's scared, hungry, or (rarely) being a brat.  It's our job to give him to tools and words necessary for him to tell us what he wants, rather than just screaming when he's unhappy.  We also have to pay attention to him and be enthusiastic when he speaks at a normal volume and uses his words, and completely ignore him if he screams or squawks.  He's improved massively in this regard since we got him.    Through clicker training and socialization, he's gone from a one-person bird (who was hostile to anyone but my husband), to being very outgoing and tolerant of other people.  He's never really liked physical affection, but he loves watching and talking to people.    Right now, we're working on harnessed flight training, though it's still only in the early stages.  Eventually, we'll be able to use the Aviator flight line to let him fly to his heart's content.  We love seeing him happy, and he's always seemed to like things that are somewhat like flying (being pushed really quickly while sitting on a shopping cart, for example).  He's so much fun to interact with.  All his silly little habits, his moments of cleverness or profound stupidity, it's all ridiculously endearing.  I love my featherbutt.    Maybe someday when we own a house with a backyard, we'll build an aviary and add to our flock.  But for now, Sparky's our baby."
parrots,3da920,So_Motarded,3,Tue Jul 14 21:29:59 2015 UTC,It sounds like training birds is rather similar to training a dog.
parrots,3da920,thebbman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:30:00 2015 UTC,"Very similar.  The clicker method is pretty much exactly the same, but the motivations can vary (some birds like treats, some birds prefer praise and affection as rewards).  Clicker training can also be used to condition behaviors, like talking at a normal volume, or being friendly to new people, or not being territorial of his perch."

parrots,3dcdq3,Zephyrel,2,Wed Jul 15 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see either of these behaviors as anything out of the norm.   Even parrots of the same species can have vastly different personalities. While some birds may not mind cuddling and scritches, other birds may not be so tolerant.   Nips are usually done out of annoyance and warning, not out of aggression. Unless he's drawing blood or deep bruising on a regular basis, all he doing is trying to tell you that he doesn't like what you're doing. You have to take the hint and stop. Reacting at all is going to perpetuate the behavior.  As for the squawking - well, that's what parrots do. Whoever told you that GCCs are ""notoriously quiet"" probably misrepresented the species. While you certainly may get lucky and have a quieter bird, it's definitely not something you should count on. GCCs may not always be as loud as other conures, but they can certainly make some noise.  If you're trying to keep the bird from being loud while you're away, I would suggest leaving a radio or television on nearby. I found my quaker was far less squawky when he had some background noise to entertain him. Even when he was vocal, he would be more ""chatty"" than ""squawky"" - making it far less grating for the rest of the house.  As far as trying to reduce the contact calling when you leave the room, try encouraging him to use another sound as a contact call. When you leave the room, use this sound (for my quaker, it's ""pip pip pip!"") to call him, and ignore him when he squawks. Eventually, he'll learn that using the proper contact call will illicit a reaction, and a squawk will not.  For only having him for a few months, I think you're doing quite well. Time and patience will work out the kinks."
parrots,3dcdq3,painesgrey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:35:34 2015 UTC,"Everything you said made sense, thank you. I do feel he's a bit too aggressive a lot of the time though, maybe he is naturally a cantankerous bird.   When you leave the room, use this sound (for my quaker, it's ""pip pip pip!"") to call him, and ignore him when he squawks.   I'll try that! I didn't know you could alter their flock call."
parrots,3dcdq3,Haakkon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:26:14 2015 UTC,"Just because you don't understand them doesn't mean he doesn't have his reasons. Don't just write him off as crazy or grumpy. There are so many things I didn't think had any meaning initially that I now know my GCC was trying to tell me something.   With the rubs it's definitely possible for it to both hurt and feel good at the same time, if he's nipping at all during rubs it probably hurts. Try backing off and being super super gentle. It's really important you don't hurt him even by accident if he's to gain your trust."

Why is the red on the piebald birds just like a real grey's tail yet the pure red birds are a much pinker red?  So I think you can see why I'm skeptical of these photos.  Edit: Lots of better photos of lutino macaws out there, so my questions are satisfied. The red greys are still a bit of BS though."

There's also more photos of red factor greys if you just google. Also videos. While I can see why your skeptical of the pure red one(s), red factor greys DO exist. Also, I just found a pure red video. And to me, it does look pinker compared to the more piebald ones.  Lutino macaws are very very rare. There is a video of a macaw with a mutation similar to the Lutinos."

parrots,3d9h69,EviLRome0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:15 2015 UTC,"I think your best course of action would be to call local carpet cleaners and find out what, if any, chemicals they use in the process. Then call your local avian vet to see if these are going to be harmful for your bird.   Steam cleaning is usually the best way to clean without any harmful chemicals, but they may not provide the level of clean you're looking for.  If chemicals are necessary (and they usually are, when it comes to cleaning spots/stains), then maybe find a friend/neighbor/relative that can look after the bird, or even board the bird for a day or two while your house airs out. Better safe than sorry."

parrots,3d6rnn,cesare753,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:06:47 2015 UTC,"aw she's a beauty. that pic of her with the wet spiky do is hilarious!!. Sorry for your loss. Losing a bird is so hard because of the massive personalities that they project, It's really like losing a family member. I bawled for days when my lovie passed. It seems so sad that most bird owners seem to learn of the passing of their loved ones int he same way, unexpected and jarring.  The guilt of not being there when my buddy passed was so hard, I hope it doesnt get to you too much. I found it helps to think that she wouldnt have been mad that you were away, and most definitely wouldnt have wanted you to get yourself down about it.   Birds are happy guys and I think the best thing we can do to remember them and respect them is to be as happy as we can in their absence. Remember all of the great times you had together and how happy you made each other. Remembering the playful ear piercing chirps of my lovie still makes me well up. but in a happy way.   Be glad that you were able to give your buddy a life full of love and happiness, and that you bonded and understood her enough to be able to feel and receive love and happiness form her too.  Obviously let yourself be sad and mad and let out all of those feeling that you feel you need to let out. but only do that, just let them out, don't encourage them, or drag them along. Encourage the happy thoughts and trail along the great memories!!!  Here's a couple of my fave pics of my baby Luna, maybe our two have found each other wherever good birds go when their time is up!!  Good luck!!  keep positive!!"

Your Parrot WILL bite and try to take off the suction cups. I let Banjo do it until he realized he had no more perches. Now he doesn't do it (as much). Also connecting them makes it so they don't fall to the ground. A note that Banjo is fully flights and just screams-flies away when it happens.   Making things hard to get to has increased his confidence. I think this is why he is so good at flying and getting around now.

parrots,3d6qjk,BiscottiContessa,12,Mon Jul 13 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"Granted I've only had close relations with two avian vets in my life, but the advice that yours gave you does seem a bit strange. Even IF I were only to go off of information I had found on the internet, I still wouldn't suggest that pellets be eliminated completely from a bird's diet.   First of all, what my first vet told me (she's the one that deals with my budgies): it's true that birds like budgies, cockatiels, and other grass keets thrive on a diet with a seed component, since that is what they have evolved eating in their native Aussie habitat. But while some seed is fine (~1/3 of their total diet) it is important to include pellets and lots of fresh veggies/fruits because the seed we feed our birds isn't the same quality as they would be getting in the wild. In the wild, they are eating dozens of fresh, young grasses and germinating seeds. Not stuff that's been dried and sitting on a shelf in a pet store for months. Even Volkman's seed mixes (which I love as a treat for all my birds btw) is not ideal because not only is it dried but it lacks variety. Finally, the fact of the matter is, most of our birds aren't super great about eating their healthy, fresh foods. My budgies in particular like 5 or 6 vegetables/fruits and that's it. So to make sure that they are getting the well rounded nutrition they need pellets are a necessity. One of my especially stubborn females, has only made it so far as the Nutri-berries: they make up her base diet and so far she is healthy as can be. Now maybe if your bird was not very picky, and ate a well rounded diet including sprouted or germinated seed, then maybe I could back your vet's ""no-pellet"" advice. But considering most birds won't, or that most people are not willing to go to the effort of preparing elaborate meals for their kids, then pellets are really the best way to give them solid nutrition.   Finally, a couple things bother me about what she says:   She said they're bodies are made to digest seeds and nuts. Furthermore, if they only eat pellets their gizzards will become flaccid, resulting in illness or an early death.   I recently graduated with a degree in biology/ornithology (and took avian husbandry classes at our affiliated vet school). I can say that I have NEVER heard of such a biological phenomenon occurring, and it seems pretty anatomically impossible.   She said they're bodies are made to digest seeds and nuts.    I don't know what she thinks pellets are made out of. All pellets are made up of legumes/grains/nuts that are simply pre-ground and mixed with other ingredients to make them nutritionally complete. If you aren't comfortable feeding your bird corn, wheat, etc. some brands do exist that have a base of quinoa or brown rice (see Goldenfeast and TOPs). Especially if you avoid pellets with artificial vitamins, colorings, flavors, and preservatives, you are technically feeding wholesome foods.    She is even opposed to Lafeber Nutri-berries because she said the processing that occurs to make the Nutri-berries lowers the quality of the seeds that are included in the ""berries"".   Again, the only thing Lafeber does to its seed is hull it and coat it in vitamins. While some people want to avoid the artificial vitamins, nothing about hulling (the only processing occurring with the seed) alters the nutritional form of the seed (birds do it in their mouths before they eat unhulled seed). Maybe she is talking about the process by which they form the actual Nutri-berries.... idk.   Anyways, to make a veeeeery long post (sorry!) short, while I would normally say, ""Follow your vet's advice"" I caution against it when it seems to run contrary to most other vet, internet, and book advice."
parrots,3d6qjk,budgiefacedkiller,5,Tue Jul 14 01:24:37 2015 UTC,You. I like you.
parrots,3d6qjk,CygnusZeroStar,4,Tue Jul 14 01:37:55 2015 UTC,"Literally every avian vet I've ever been to would disagree with this person. And here's why:   Birds in your living room will not be flying the distances that they would in the wild, nor will they need to expend nearly the number of calories trying to forage for food or breed. Seeds are ridiculously high in fat. Sunflower seeds and millet especially have been likened to potato chips as far as nutrition goes.   Your budgie is native to Australia. The seed mixes you'll find anywhere are not the same seeds and roots and other such things they would be eating in Australia. So feeding a budgie, or any other parrot for that matter, a sunflower seed or pumpkin seeds and saying that it's part of their natural diet doesn't make any more sense than suggesting there's a pellet bowl out there in the jungle.   Seeds that are ""fortified"" or ""supplemented"" are done so while they're, of course, still in the hull. As a result, the added vitamins are in the hull. Guess what part your budgie isn't going to bother to eat.   Pellets are more nutritious than commercially available seed diets, because nobody's able to completely replicate what your budgie--or any parrot for that matter--would eat in the wild. But the suggestion that a parrot should eat only pellets is equally damaging. Any good avian vet will suggest a WIDELY varied diet. My avian vet of choice has always suggested to me a diet composed of 50-70% pellets, 20-40% fresh items (fruits, veggies, prepared foods like rice, even egg and chicken contain healthy amounts of protein), and no more than 10% seeds. Because even with all of the ""fortified"" and ""supplemented"" seed diets out there, they're still not what your bird would be eating in the wild, and all of the fortification is in the hull.   The key to a good diet is variety, and avoidance of the toxic things. Not feeding a bird seeds they likely wouldn't find in their natural habitat which are crammed with calories they're not likely to use as a pet."
parrots,3d6qjk,CygnusZeroStar,3,Tue Jul 14 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon to find people who support the ""feed what they would eat in the wild"" idea. Unfortunately, this mentality doesn't really work when we're keeping birds in captivity - wild diets aren't always the most balanced and conducive to longevity.   Roudybush has a great little pdf file that goes into detail as to why seed diets are inferior compared to formulated pellet diets. It starts on page 4, but there are tidbits about it littered throughout the document. It's a good read, especially if you're looking for responses to the typical arguments people have against pellets.  Seed diets tend to lack a lot of minerals (D3, A) that pelleted diets have built-in. So in addition to your seed diet, you'll be required to supplement other minerals in order to have a fully balanced diet. Unfortunately, birds tend to eat only what they want to eat (and absolutely reject anything they don't want), so making sure that they're getting those extra minerals can be difficult.   I would be interested in reading the articles that led your vet to this line of thinking. Most of the articles I've read from avian vets/nutritionists have argued that pellets are leagues above seed in terms of balanced nutrition."
parrots,3d6qjk,painesgrey,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the responses everyone. The information you have provided makes sense to me. I was just so surprised to hear the vet make statements that were so contrary to everything I'd read. I couldn't help but wonder if anyone else had been told anything similar.  To say ""thanks"" here a a few pictures of my boys.  Since they both seem willing to eat pellets, I think I will keep them as a major part of their diet and supplement with seeds, veggies, and fruit. I've also ordered some seeds from ""Sprout People"" - I thought I'd give that a try.  I'm looking forward to getting past the quarantine period so I can introduce my little guys. I'll be sure to document the process when it happens so I can share.  Thanks again!"
parrots,3d6qjk,TK4442,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:00:12 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the foundation/core of my [edit: last] parakeet (budgie)'s diet was: Lafeber's Nutri-An cakes (probably healthier than Nutriberries but likely similar processing issues) and Harrison's pellets, along with greens everyday. He was a healthy, happy person and was almost 15 years old when he died.   I have heard that a pellet only diet isn't good for budgies and I actually agree with that. I can't remember the specifics, but as someone who's had budgies most of my life, there's just something that feels off to me about feeding only pellets and no seed at all.   But - I think your plan of having both sounds good. I would question the Nutri-Berries, only because I feel like the retail Lafeber products aren't as good as Nutri-An (eg tend to have more sugars or along those lines). The problem with Nutri-An is that you can only get it through vets. Which I find ridiculous."
parrots,3d6j1k,Drummer68,3,Mon Jul 13 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"The first thing you need to do is figure out why you're being bitten. The answer might not be obvious to you, but take a step back and really take notice to literally anything and everything that might have changed. Did you move the cage? Is there a new toy? Is your bird feeling like it's time to breed? Is something happening outside where the bird can see that makes her feel threaten?  I've never met a parrot that didn't bite for a reason. The only real solution, beyond not responding to it as best you can, is to find out why. Prepare your hat and bubble pipe, because you're about to get all Sherlock on that birdy's butt.   Also...the first rule of parrot that I've ever come to believe is more often than not very true is--save for the little guys like budgies--if you're not bleeding, it was not likely an act of aggression."
parrots,3d6j1k,CygnusZeroStar,2,Tue Jul 14 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, there is always a logical reason its not random. Fear biting because something changed (your hair, clothing, makeup, glasses, carrying something, some new object in the room (especially something snake-like such as a broom handle or wire) etc?).

If it's only been a few days and he's still skittish then I have to say it is in no way abnormal. Depending on a bird's personality it could take a day, or a month, before they have settle into their new home and is comfortable approaching you.  For training I would recommend getting a clicker. There are many awesome references/books for clicker training that will show you how to use this tool to create a positive bond with your new friend. And I recommend trying out the millet. For small birds like lovies it's basically birdie crack. :P"
parrots,3d6h4h,budgiefacedkiller,2,Tue Jul 14 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"The first thing my Timneh, Gir, did when she came home at four months old was hang upside down from her rope and ring toy and squee gleefully. Then she came stomping out of her cage on to it's little ""balcony"" door (we no longer have this cage, that was a decade ago), tripping on the way, to coo at me until I came to cuddle her. She's always been an outgoing little bird butt.   My cockatiel cricket is an idiot. She propositions all sorts of things for pettings. She got very mad at a potato-head once because his hand wouldn't pet her. She was never very shy.   Nacho is a GCC I've had for a few years now, and he was a rescue situation. I know there's a cute little ball of conure-goodness in there somewhere, but he's often a perch potato that doesn't know how to play and doesn't realize that he has the freedom to move about. He does, however, dance and click when someone approaches him for cheekie rubs. It's been three years. I'm still working on him. He also likes to randomly bite and twist because GCC's are horrible little turds like that.   I had a Senegal named Devastator that took about a week to be okay with his toys, but was great with people.   My budgie Rain always hated everything. She was a ball of hate and rage. An ADORABLE ball of hate and rage.  Our first bird, Fidget, a lovely little boy 'tiel was very playful at the store, then very apprehensive when we came home. On day five, he climbed up my torso while I sat on the couch and got as close to my face as he could and just stared at me for...like...an hour. I wasn't allowed to touch him. He would hiss at me and do that little cockatiel ""Nyyyaaaaaaa!"" complaint if I moved my hands at all. He just STARED at me. The next day, he wanted pettings.   Those are my experiences. Remember that every parrot is in an individual. They're all going to be weird little feather balls at their own pace."

parrots,3d4kdk,kerovon,3,Mon Jul 13 13:52:15 2015 UTC,Perhaps because of the difference in how the singing sounds coming from inside the bowl?
parrots,3d4kdk,ZeMouth,2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:54 2015 UTC,I think this is probably the case! My cockatiel sometimes would talk into his bowl and come out and look surprised that it sounded different. He'd say the same word outside the bowl then in the bowl as if to compare.

parrots,3d5c7l,budgiebum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"""My son came home for the weekend before heading off to Vegas for a summer job, and we were talking about the number of birds that need to come in but we don't have room. He asked, ""Is it getting worse?"" The answer is, ""YES!!!""  2015, so far, has been the absolute worst 6-month period since I started planning the rescue back in 2007. Jared also asked why this was the case and if I thought the trend was going to continue. I will not lie...both answers to those questions scare the b'jeebus out of me! We are now at the point of being contacted about more birds found outside or left in apartments and homes in the first 6 months of this year than the last year and a half combined. Rescues, including us, are full, but we still must make a place for these birds, which could very well be birds we put on the waiting list to begin with. I don't even check the waiting list, which is over 50 birds long as of this morning, when I get a call like that; I truly do not want to know.  We are in a unique location that makes doing parrot rescue especially challenging. Unlike all of the social politics, etc in rescue that make the job a nightmare for anyone who hasn't grown a thick skin, we have REAL problems to face each and every day. Those problems must be overcome every single day so the job can be done. Here are just a few problems that make having a parrot rescue in this area a bit challenging.  *We are near Florida where a lot of birds are bred and sold.   *We have bird fairs where people impulsively purchase parrots with little or no idea what they are getting into.  *We have very few avian vets in Georgia, and few people, even experienced parrot owners, fully realize the importance of taking their bird(s) to an avian vet. This means when birds do come in, they need vet care, which is costly.  *People retire here, so birds they purchased in other states end up needing a place to go when they can no longer care for them. Many of these birds are older Amazons with no where to go.   *We have breeders here, also. When they can no longer care for their birds, we get a call.   *The weather is nice enough to have birds outside nearly all year, which means people keep multiple birds in an aviary. We frequently get calls to take in 6-12 birds from one person. There is no way to have that kind of space and funds on hold for non-emergencies, so those birds have to wait.  *Even in a metro location, we do not have stores that sell quality parrot food or supplies or offer educational resources. This means birds come in cages that are too small, with no toys, and a seed diet, all of which has to be changed prior to adoption. It also means we become the resource for those needs, and that spreads us very thin, but it must be done.  *For us specifically, we specialize in Cockatoos. Cockatoo rescue is not even the same sport as normal parrot rescue; we do both, so I write from experience. You cannot compare adopting out a cockatoo to adopting out a Grey, Conure, or Macaw; they are their own group, which takes me back to the social politics, but I won't go there.  We have cockatoos from individuals, animal control agencies, other rescues from across the country, found cockatoos, and cockatoos from sanctuaries from around the country. This means our space for highly adoptable birds is very limited, turning us almost into a sanctuary by default, which we fight tooth and nail against, but the cost is the same. To take in species that are not as likely to find homes brings about huge expenses without the benefit of adoption fees to help offset the cost. Every day is a battle for the funds, all while not becoming competitive with other rescues...oh the balancing act! ;)  What does all of this mean? It means we are just like every all-volunteer non-profit out there, and we do what we can and are forever grateful to those of you who support us with your time, money, and goods. It may sound cliche, but we really can't do it without you, so thank you very, very much!"""

That he bites his toys instead of you, even when you are in reach, is a lot better than him biting you.  It could also just be play. My conure loves to attack her toys when I come near her cage. It's like she's showing off, and if I get into it and rattle her toys with her, she gets even more into it. It's really cute. It's not an act of aggression at all.  You kind of have to figure out the motives to know for sure if it's just showing off his toys or being territorial or redirecting aggression. Whatever it is, it's not bad and shouldn't be punished. Just don't stick your fingers where they might get an accidental bite!"

She has issues. She's been with me about two years now and I think I've had to adapt to her as much as she's adapted to me! You just need to remember that there are reasons for everything, even if they don't make sense to you. Crumble is overprotective of her seed pot, because she used to get it taken off her - I can now take it to refill as long as she can see it at all times (I have a spare for when it needs washing, because if she can't see it she will SCREAM).  She can't fly. I have tried to encourage her, but she doesn't want to. She will fly short distances to get back to her cage but that's it - although recently she made it to the top of the wardrobe and I have no idea how. She's also only got out of her cage a few times by herself, as she won't get out unless I get her.   Crumble now loves scritches. She doesn't like anybody else though, just me. When I first got her she was terrified of all people and hated hands, but now she will squish her head against my hand if I'm not giving her enough scritches!   So yeah, you just need to be slow and patient. You're doing the right thing by introducing change slowly. If something is terrifying it might just take time for your bird to adapt."

parrots,3d2o6m,Synthyx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:12:35 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, high potency is formulated for special dietary needs associated with breeding, newly-weaned birds, or birds that are molting, in cold climates, ill, etc.   Their adult lifetime formula is a year-round feeding formula.   You can read more about them on the Harrison's website here.  EDIT: I consider the high potency to be a formula made to be more effective for birds that may eat less due to conversion from other diets, weaning, etc. It's higher in protein and much, much higher in fat. (5.5% min crude fat in adult lifetime, vs 15% in high potency in the coarse, and roughly double the fat in other sizes)."
parrots,3d2o6m,painesgrey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"thats what i expected. a ""special circumstance"" food. But the website says to feed a high potency for 6-8 months before a lifetime adult diet. Without really giving any reason. I wonder why they would have us feeding a radical fat and protein change for 6-8 months no matter the age."
parrots,3d2o6m,budgiefacedkiller,2,Mon Jul 13 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"In many cases (especially with older birds or those fixed on a seed-only diet) diet conversions can be extremely stressful. With one of my own ""seed junkie"" budgies, I had to stop/start the conversion process three times because she was so resistant to the pellets that she started losing weight. I can see how having a very high fat/protein diet during the conversion would be beneficial in maintaining a healthy weight and energy levels. It's the only reason I can think of that explains their advice."
parrots,3d2o6m,SamusAran388,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:38:02 2015 UTC,I emailed them once and asked about it. If I recall correctly they said you can feed the high potency for life as well. I asked at what age should I switch over to the adult formula and they told me I didn't need to necessarily. Maybe unless a vet suggested otherwise or something changed in my bird's health? They weren't very specific.
parrots,3d2o6m,painesgrey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, their website doesn't really provide the details as to why they recommend this. The only thing I could find was in their FAQ:   Harrison’s recommends all birds start out and remain on High Potency for a period of no less than 6-8 months. Subsequent to this period, Adult Lifetime is an optional formula for some species. Most birds can remain on High Potency. (Some birds, including African Grey, macaws, larger Cockatoos etc should remain on High Potency for life).  Only in situations directed by your avian veterinarian would Adult Lifetime be directed instead of High Potency.   and   High Potency is recommended due to empirically superior nutritional results.  Adult Lifetime or any combination is also an excellent formula, possibly just not as potent.   Their website doesn't mention why, physiologically, some species should be on high potency at all times. Just a lot of ""feeding the High Potency Coarse formulation exclusively...appears to minimize these negative characteristics"" (when talking about plucking African Greys) and ""in contrast to what might be expected, these birds seem to respond to the higher fat, higher protein formulation of High Potency Coarse..."" (talking about overweight Amazons).  It would be nice if they listed the scientific basis for their arguments, but they don't seem to."

parrots,3cx4as,NewayZ,8,Sat Jul 11 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"Poor Ray. :(   At this point it's only been two weeks. That's not long for even a tame bird to settle in, let alone a neglected bird like Ray. It sounds like he's already making improvements if he's screaming less and taking millet from a spray you're holding.   I'd keep doing what you're doing, only adjust the expectations for your timeline way out. Instead of shortening that millet spray over a period of days, make it a couple weeks. Let him realize on his owns terms that your hands are okay.   I rescued a budgie that bit a lot like Ray. When he bit down he'd grind his beak in to really break the skin. I looked like I'd run my hand on a cheese grater. The way he did it seemed almost like a flashback. I was able to train him to step up and he would happily hop on my hand, but he'd suddenly snap. He was terrified of hands when I got him to the point where he'd pant when I put my hands in the cage, so it was like he was reverting back and undoing all the progress we had made.   Now he likes me so much that he'll fly over to my hand on command, but that has taken a year and a half of working with him. Bites are very rare now though.   Clicker training and target training helped a lot. Clicker training created a line of communication that just clicked with my birds. Target training gave us a way to bond that they were comfortable with. They loved learning tricks with the target stick (a chopstick, ha). It built up a lot of trust between us. I recommend giving it a try!"
parrots,3cx4as,StringOfLights,2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:31 2015 UTC,"You can just love him for what he is. Birds live a very long time and they can change over time, but the change is slow and happens at the bird's own whims. I'd suggest that if you don't want your fingers bit you don't put them near the bird. Maybe eventually he will stop hating fingers. I predict he may always hate remote controls. Remote controls seem to be universally hated by birds, or at least universally destroyed."
parrots,3cx4as,sbhikes,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:32 2015 UTC,"It's a big jump for a bird to go from living in squalor to a more suitable home. Two weeks isn't a lot of time, and he's probably still trying to get adjusted to his new surroundings, new people, and new routine.  It's going to take a lot of time and even more patience to get him to where you want him to be. The most important things to remember are to stay positive (and have all interactions between you and him to be positive/rewarding), and to stay consistent.   You're starting in the right place by using millet to try to coax him into accepting your presence. Try using this method for when you are moving/rearranging his cage as well. Put some tasty treats in his food dish before you mess with his cage, and he may become more accepting. This may also act as a distraction to save your fingers.  Here are a few good articles that might give you a little more insight:  http://www.beautyofbirds.com/biting.html  http://trainedparrot.com/Taming/"
parrots,3cx4as,painesgrey,2,Sat Jul 11 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"my Maxwell was very antisocial when we first got him, too.  Lunges, bites, cage protective.    My opinion is that he was scared and had suffered trauma from hands.    The way I dealt with it was to persist in being close to him and trying to hand-feed treats (associate hands with good things only).  I kept playing with his cage and adding things and adjusting things, even though he'd chase me around while I did.  Again, I'd hang treats part of the time.    He stopped being so hand-aggressive after about a year and a half.  He still gets nippy when I mess with his cage.  But I keep working with him, and now he'll sit on me and let me pet him/groom him.   We keep working on it."
parrots,3cx4as,sarautu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:06:11 2015 UTC,"Poor fella!   I rescued a lovebird, too, last year. I have no idea if she was treated fine previously, but she was still mistrusting and stressed the first weeks. It took me 2 months to build trust and tame her, 2 weeks is too little especially for a bird who was neglected and mistreated like that!   The first month she used to bite me, I did what you're doing until she stopped fearing my hands; rarely she still gets scared, though, and won't let me touch her (believe her previous owners grabbed her forcefully and made her fearful of hands), but she's always receptive to having my face close to her, she has never tried to bite my face, so I approach her and just talk to her until she's calm. She loves it when I kiss the top of her beak!  I think you're doing fine, just have a little more of patience. Also, when he's playing with his toys, you could join and interact with the toy, too, see how he reacts. Lovebirds really enjoy playing with others, so this could be a bonding experience."

parrots,3cuthl,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"The breeding season is like birdie ""puberty"" in the sense that its exact time, duration, or intensity cannot be predicted and depends in part on a bird's environment and part on their genetic predisposition/personality.  Usually someone will notice that their bird's behavior has changed, then use process of elimination to determine the cause. If nothing about a bird's routine or environment has changed, they are reaching a certain age or it is spring time, and the new behaviors are stereotypical of either case, then they may assume that puberty or breeding behaviors are the culprits.  Even though we can't say for sure that your bird will show changes during these times, in general once the days start becoming longer in the spring you can keep an eye out as this would signal the beginning of the breeding season in the wild. If you bird never showed behavioral changes at this time it may be because it was 1) not sexually mature or 2) not inclined to be aggressive or horny. Of all my birds I do have one male budgie that never seems to catch the ""spring fever"". On the other hand, my parrotlet spent a month this spring regurgitating to my other bird and generally being a loud, nippy ass. His hormone surge is already long past, but I do know some people are still dealing with it. So again, much of it depends on the individual bird."

Don't react if he gets angry, just put him down, step away and let him be. If you jump and shout he'll take that as a positive thing to his biting. During the times he's calm and friendly provide plenty of treats and scritches.

Something that I've heard works well (other than the excellent advice about treating for good behavior below) is to have the less favoured family members do all the good stuff, and the favourite the ""bad stuff"".  So like, if Charlie really loves grapes ONLY you or your mom should ever give him grapes, so he learns to associate you with his really special treat.  And if he is particularly upset by, I don't know, vacuuming, only your Dad should do that in his field of view.  This won't turn Charlie against your Dad by any means, it will just show him that he can take comfort in, and bond with, other members of his flock.  Definitely do fun bird stuff with him too. Share meals together, let him watch you tearing bits of tissue paper, and let him help. Etc."

parrots,3csqxw,hollowlefty,2,Sat Jul 11 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"Before I clicked to read your text I thought ""lovebird"". Our bird has mellowed somewhat but for the longest time, she would attack anyone other than my oldest son. I'm not sure what has helped other than my son becoming busier and having less time to play with her every day. That and I give her cheerios and talk to her when she's in her cage. She's still best with kids though and even though she doesn't attack me anymore I can't imagine her ever falling asleep on my lap or crawling into my sleeves the way she does with my son. With him it's total trust forever."

We left her with the person we bought her from, and he's been sending pictures and videos every day.

parrots,3ctmiu,journalscats,2,Fri Jul 10 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"This pisses me off to no end as it hits FAR too close to home.  My yellow nape was in a similar setting.  Tiny cage.  Ignored.  Abused.  And yes, this bird is being abused, hands down.  No ifs ands or buts.  This is neglect plain and simple and honestly I wouldn't mind punching any of the family for letting this happen.  But I won't....punching the ignorant doesn't help.  Lets fix the simplest problem first:  Fruit flies.  Remove all soft food from the cage daily.  Dispose of trash daily.  You don't want the flies to have a food source.  In addition, clean and DRY all sinks in the home.  No standing water....even little puddles around the edge.  The flies drink this.  Now what are your fly traps like?  If its just a bowl of wine or whatever, that won't work.  Get some small plastic soda bottles, cut off the top 2 or 3 inches, then invert them, and tape them together....basically making a funnel into the rest of the bottle.  NOW add some wine or fruit juice with a little dish soap added.  Leave those nearby.  Now the difficult part:  Taming of the bird.  Amazons are real tough to work with.  They bite VERY hard, and WILL leave nasty scars.  There is really no way around this.  You can minimize it, but these birds can get very hormonal and also loose their heads to overload behavior.  The worst part is they can revert back to poor behaviors, so they need to be worked with daily.  I'm not going to lie to you....if mom and dad aren't willing to help, you have LOTS of work ahead of you.  First order of business is stick training.  Stick training is simply training them to step up onto a stick for ease of moving them.  It is not advised to hand train them right away.  Get a nice big dowel or other clean stick that can hold her weight and keep your hands far enough away.  ALL amazon owners have sticks at the ready...I don't care how long they've owned them or how tame they are.  We all have sticks nearby.  Get her used to the stick, by playing with it in front of her.  Leave it near her cage constantly.  Let her see its not something to be afraid off.  Let her touch it and play with it (through the bars) if she wants.    When she's ready, get a small supply of her favorite treat (Find out what it is if the parents don't already know) and a small step stool.  Peanuts aren't good for them....but amazons are suckers for peanuts.  Break them up into tiny pieces so you can get lots of training done at a time.  Now, open the cage and wait.  Let her start to come out.  If you have a play gym or stand she can get on, place it close to the cage.  Let her explore the world a little at a time.  If the door is open and she doesn't come out, thats fine.  Let her decide when to explore.  Sit close by her, talk to her, get her comfortable with people.  Mom and Dad NEED to do this as well.  Play with the stick at this time.  Eat a few peanuts.  Even play with new toys you get for her.  Get her interested in coming out.  Hopefully, she will come out sooner rather than later.  Once that happens, work on the stick training.  Hold the stick in front of her (not pointed at her), have a treat in the other hand and entice her to step onto the stick to get the treat (If you are afraid of bites, put the peanut or treat in a spoon or something).    As soon as you see she is about to step onto the stick, say clearly ""STEP UP.""  When she gets on the stick, give her LOTS of praise.  Make a big deal out of it.  She likes screaming at people because it gets her attention.  NOW you are showing her that following directions gets her attention AND treats.  Get her to step off the stick (again, more treats placed away from her), and do it again.  Over and over.  Give a treat each time.  Give praise each time.  Now the harder part.  Hold the stick so she can step up, and DO NOT have a treat that she can see.  ""Step up!""  If she steps up on command THEN you may give a treat.  Again, more praise.  If this isn't working, then again, get a treat and place it in a spot where she is FORCED to get on the stick to get to said treat.  Praise and treats are pretty much necessary for any training she will receive in the coming years.  Eventually, you will want to get her trained enough that stepping on a stick is second nature to her....i.e. doesn't need treats to do it.  Once stick training is done, you now have a way to let her explore outside the cage, but still control where she goes so as to avoid dangerous places, animals, or to protect your feet if she attacks them.  After this, it becomes a game of trust.  You need to show her she will never be treated poorly again and that she can trust people.  Even if she bites, you CANNOT punish her.  The only thing you can do is try not to yell or scream in pain, and give her a 'time out'.  Calmly place her back in the cage, close the door and quietly watch TV nearby or whatever.  Let her relax for a bit then try again after 10 minutes or so.  Unlike dogs or cats, a bird will not understand punishment, nor cause and effect.  They will only know that for no reason, they are being attacked.  That HURTS trust, and will put her on the offensive more often than not.  So now EVERYONE in the house must show her that they can be trusted.  EVERYONE must learn to work with the stick training.  EVERYONE should feed, talk, and even play with her.  Even touching should be done.  Start by softly touching the beak.  You'll all need to learn the warning signs of a bite however.  Eventually try to pet her head...even through the bars if need be.  Again, trust is key.  Let her know you won't hurt her.  And again, if someone hurts her or acts aggressive to her, all this training might need to be started again.  Here's the hardest part in my opinion:  Let HER touch YOU.  Some may disagree with me, but with all the birds I've worked with and or rescued, there always comes a point where they test you.    My own amazon didn't seem to warm up to me until I let him grab my finger in his monsterously strong and flesh rending beak.  In other words, by ME showing HIM trust, we strengthened the bond.  This takes nerves of steel with an amazon.  And training is still going to occur.  ""Be gentle!"" is something all birds need to learn when exploring with their beak.  Now there is only so much I can do by writing on reddit.  I highly suggest getting this book:  http://www.amazon.com/Sally-Blanchards-Companion-Parrot-Handbook/dp/096712980X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436669697&sr=8-1&keywords=the+companion+parrot+handbook  Best parrot book I've ever read.  It can help guide you on pretty much anything that will ever come up in a simple way for everyone to understand.  Hope this helps.  In time you can go from an 'evil' bird to this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_pIEushKck"

parrots,3ctmiu,r00sterr00,4,Fri Jul 10 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"That cage is WAY too small for her. Poor thing. Round cages are also not good for birds, so look into getting a square cage with lots and lots of toys and perches of different sizes"
parrots,3ctmiu,plusjoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"You will need toys to start with! She is absolutely bored if she is shut in there all day and never comes out, plus has no toys to play with! Get her a toy or two to start with, then maybe upgrade her cage to one that will fit in more toys and give her more room.   I would try to get her out of the cage as much as you can. For a week or so, try sitting next to the cage or close to it, and just read a book or talk to her occasionally. That will help build trust in you maybe some curiosity about you as well. When you want to try and get her out of the cage, start really slow and just open the door, don't put your hand in or try to take her out, let her do it at her own pace.  As for the screaming, yelling at her will not quiet her or improve it at all. She has learned that when she screams, people will give her attention and scream back. Try to convince everyone to try and ignore the screaming, then once she stops screaming, wait a couple of seconds and go over to her cage and talk to her to show her you will respond to silence more than screaming.  What kind of food is she eating right now?  I'm glad to hear that you are taking the initiative and trying to save this bird from neglect.   Also I have never owned a larger parrot before, so some of this info may be a bit off, but I am pretty sure the basics cover all parrots, large or small, and basic training still applies. Some other redditors will probably have more tips and insight than me. But I still hope this was helpful and can improve the bird's life even a tiny bit, as well as your own."
parrots,3ctmiu,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"Oh wow is there any way at all that you could get them to invest in a bigger and better cage? Not only is this one round, but it has no horizontal bars to climb, barely lets her stretch her wings to the fullest, and is completely barren. The two perches in there now are too uniform; you're just asking for foot/nail/beak problems later on. Birds also appreciate more horizontal vs vertical space (they aren't helicopters!). If you can get her something maybe double to triple the size of the current cage, as well as a dozen or more decent toys to rotate around, I assure you she will be much more comfy and more likely to be obliging. At the moment, you can't expect an animal that is bored out of their mind, trapped in the equivalent of a closet 24/7, constantly yelled at and ignored, to be quiet and cooperate with you.   In all: look for a LARGE (maybe 3 foot by two foot by 4-5 feet) cage. Lots of toys of varying type and texture. Get some made of wood/cork/palm fiber/etc that she can shred, some that jingle or are shiny, others that you can use for foraging and stuff with food. Find multiple perches. A good variety will include many wooden branches, one or two sand perches to help condition her nails, maybe a flat perch for roosting, or ones made from rope. You could also look into getting a playstand that she can come out onto if she doesn't want to be on a person.  Look at sites like Amazon, drfostersmith.com, ebay, craigslist, etc to find relatively cheap cages. There are many other sites including mysafebirdstore.com where you can find everything else. Just be careful that you are buying cages with the appropriate bar spacing and gauge of wire.  If for some reason you really can't convince them to improve her lifestyle then your biggest goal should be getting her out of her cage as much as possible each day.   This is a lot of the same advice but oh well: Start by building trust. You, your boyfriend, or any of the other family members can do this by simply spending time with her. You don't need to be actively engaged with her this whole time. Something as simple as sitting next to her while you internet, read, do work, or watch TV is enough. Just make sure that you stay close enough that she can recognize you are trying to give her company, and feed her occasional treats.   Treats and POSITIVE interactions will be the key here. You can't start to befriend her if all of your hard work is undone every time someone walks in the room and covers her up. Plusjoe has good advice about how to mitigate the screaming. Google ""how to tame a parrot"" or ""how to build a parrot's trust"" for lots more info.   Finally, the fruit flies are a thing for me too right now. I try to keep things as clean as possible but with an aracari that basically eats and shit only fruit, I'm still inundated with the little buggers. I just keep 3 or 4 traps up at all times around the bird cages, clean their bedding twice a week instead of once, and make sure all dropped food is removed at the end of the night. Good Luck!"

parrots,3cu4y5,that_random_Italian,3,Fri Jul 10 20:12:33 2015 UTC,"One quick note: captive birds come in species, not breeds.  Is it possible for you to go hang out with some birds at a nearby rescue, pet store, or sanctuary? Many places are open to volunteers and imo being around big birds is the best way to decide if your lifestyle can handle them. I worked for 4 years at a zoo caring for many macaws and 'toos. After listening to that racket for so long I can definitely say they are both forever crossed off my potential bird list.  As someone who similarly likes to stay away from large birds that are known to be particularly needy and noisy, I can say that you might want to consider the poichephalus group of parrots. Most are large birds, but they are considered relatively quiet and independent for their size (some even say their are appropriate apartment birds). Species like the Meyer's, Cape, Ruppell's, Red-bellied, or Senegal are all pois. I have extremely limited first hand experience with pois (maybe so other owners can chime in here), but have heard many good things about them and think they may be a good fit for you if you want to stay away from excessive noise."

parrots,3cu4y5,Safari_Eyes,2,Fri Jul 10 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"You are doing a very smart thing, taking the time first to be -sure- of what you want (and DON'T want) before purchasing a lifelong commitment!    I went through the same process 16 years ago, before I decided on and purchased Foo, my TAG (Timneh African Grey).  My housemate purchased a sun conure, and I'd worked with parrots before as a docent at a local zoo, plus I had friends with parrots.  I decided it was time to get a fid of my own!  But I made a promise to myself that I was going to wait one full year before purchasing my own, and during that year, I'd research which breed was the -right- one for me, AND assure myself that I could live with a parrot (my housemate's new conure!) before getting stuck with my own for the  long run.  I don't regret that decision for a moment!  When I started looking, I had a list of what sort of parrot I wanted.  To begin with, Cockatoos were at the very top of the list, and Greys were literally at the very bottom. (I only knew about CAGs at that time, I'd never even heard of TAGs)  As I researched, more and more types were ruled out for one reason or another, while Greys slowly but steadily climbed the list, making a big jump when I discovered the Timneh African Grey.  They were the least colorful or visually striking, and I'd had a childhood bad experience with a grey that had me initially leery of the breed, but they were among the very smartest, the best talkers,  and from what I read of other people's experiences, they seemed least likely to be given to sudden jealousies or attacking people in dominance games.  TAGs were also a bit smaller than most of the other parrots I'd been looking at, including the Congo Greys themselves.  Certainly they were bigger than the Conures and Caiques, but of the -talking- parrots, they were among the smallest.  Cockatoos are bigger, for the most part.  At the time, I had a close friend with an Umbrella Cockatoo, and while gorgeous and cuddly, she could be a terror!  She attacked me ONCE in a jealous rage over her person, and do not ever want to have that much angry velociraptor in my face again!  With a TAG, if the house were on fire and Foo was in a panic, or hurt and just biting anything that got near, I could handle him with my bare hands without possible crippling injuries to my fingers.  Sure, I might bleed a little, but even Conures can draw blood if they want to.  I could do it without hesitation if I had to, where I might easily hesitate with a larger bird.  As for noise Yes!  Cockatoos like noise!  Whether it's happy screaming, angry screeming, or bored screaming, Cockatoos love to yell and carry on.  A Grey can easily be just as loud when it wants to be, but they don't often get that loud for more than a few minutes at sunset or dawn, while a Cockatoo may decide to yell at the top of tis lungs any time, and for quite a long while at a time!  As for talking and mimicry of noises around you, the Greys (Timneh or Congo) are the undisputed masters.  Foo not only mimics every electronic noise produced in our house, (doorbell, phone ring from 3 phones ago, microwave noises, answering machine sounds, 3 different cats, each distinctly different, etc.), but he repeats the sounds at appropriate times and places! (and sometimes INappropriate times, to hilarious effect..)    For example, we're ... aging, like everone else, and one of my housemates had a sore back for awhile.  When getting up from the couch after watching a movie, now and then a groan or grunt escaped her.  We didn't even notice it - until Foo started making the same groan whenever she or -other- people got up from the couch!  Now that was funny!  He also laughs along at the appropriate times in movies, and often lets out a ""Wow!"" or ""Coool..!"" during explosions or exciting movie scenes.  He's smart.  And he doesn't just mimic noises, he applies meaning to the sounds happening around him.  He knows what sounds we make as a group, and what -different- sounds we make if we're having a party, for example, and he's shared the sounds back with us so we discover things that we never would have realized otherwise!  There were plenty of other reasons, but you'll have different reasons of your own.  Make up your own list - and good luck!  16 years later, I have not once regretted my choice of a TAG, and Foo and I are very happy together.  I hope you're able to pick the bird who'll really do best for you and your family, and that you have many happy years together to appreciate your wise choice of -exactly- the bird that you really wanted.  :)"

parrots,3cu4y5,Garwoodwould,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"How much time can you give the bird every night? If you can't give him an hours worth of attention (not necessarily undivided attention), I would reconsider. I HAVE to have my nightly scratches with mine, or he gets grouchy.  The way I've always seen grey's vs cockatoos:  Greys are the smartasses you can play mind games with, he will troll you BIG time, and you better enjoy it a bit.  Cockatoos are the loud mouthed cuddlebugs. And yes, they are known for throwing tantrums.  Both have very similar demeanor beyond that.  Both can be very loud, and both can be very quiet with proper training and patience.  Both will require a large cage, and need to be outside of it for an absolute minimum of four hours a day (I aim for 8). THESE ARE SMART BIRDS. I think that's the thing most people really underestimate. My Grey is way smarter than I ever anticipated. They will do things and gauge your reaction. It will drive you a bit nuts, and you can't react. This is how screaming birds start. They will need lots of stimulation in form of toys, ripping shit apart, foraging, and a bit of play time. To be completely honest - my grey is actually very low maintenance. He HAS to get his scratches every night for a little bit, but beyond that he's so chill. He just wants to hang out :)"

He came to the rescue a week or two ago, after his previous owner passed away.  The woman who runs the rescue had my son open his cage to see how he responded; he immediately jumped out of the cage onto my son's arm, which left her amazed -- he wouldn't let her get him out.  He steps up nicely to all our family members and is accepting of attention, cuddles and petting.  Buddy talks a bit, though we can't understand most of what he says. We're pretty sure there's a Step Up in there, and I think there was a Thank You, as well.  Edit: Looks like he has his new name -- Squit."

parrots,3cp0cp,CyberToaster,2,Fri Jul 10 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"hey, I wanted to wait until I had the time to sit down and actually write this up. I have a few suggestions based on my own experience and a friend of mine who also has a GCC.  Some general behavior notes. Basically I've found that the key is positive reinforcement. (I'm sure you've heard that a bunch of times.) But more than that, you need to pay attention as much as the bird does. Keep in mind that as friendly or non-threatening as you may attempt to be, you are still a several-foot-tall monster with two five headed monsters attached to your arms. Try and be patient. You are going to get bitten. Conures tend to be a little beaky, but the key is to pay attention to why. In all cases, ignoring the action is the best course. Teach him that biting will not give him the attention he wants. Sometimes it's for attention, but other times the bird may be scared or defensive, or just annoyed. I've learned to notice when Rori is on edge, and I've grown to read his body-language to understand when it's ok to approach, and when I should just keep my distance and let him do his thing. Most of the times I've gotten bit it was my fault, and I've had to correct my own behavior more often then I've needed to correct his. Birds are individuals. It's important to not just train, but communicate. Be mindful of boundries, and learn to recognize when you've overstepped them. It's more like learning to live with a roomate than training a dog, honestly.  Clipping, I recommend against it. I know this is a hot button issue on this board, and lots of people have really big opinions on the matter, but I'm simply bringing it up as a matter of personal observation. A friend of mine has a GCC named Wheatly whom the breeder clipped before sending to his new home. Birds have a fight or flight mentality about danger. Take away the ability to fly, and they are left with one option. Every time Wheatly was stressed, he felt that his only option was to bite. Sometimes he would try to fly away, and his clipped wings would cause him to crash, making him more stressed. Sometimes crashes would lead to bleeding, or minor injuries. In my opinion, clipping his wings heightened his stress levels. The pain and fear compounded on eachother. He didn't understand that my friend was trying to help him, all he knew was that it hurt. As a result, even though Wheatly is now 3 and fully flighted, he still lashes out sporadically and sometimes bites without warning. He seems easily agitated, and often causes trouble. Rori on the other hand wasn't clipped, and allowing him the ability to fly to a high place, or a different part of the room when he was startled or stressed, gave him an option besides biting. It gave him a way of escape, and it provided me with a clear signal to back-off. As a result, his demeanor around me as well as new people, is often inquisitive, docile, and relaxed. He definitely nibbles on my fingers once in awhile when I pay more attention to the computer than him, but for the most part it's just play and harmless mischief.   I don't mean to project our experiences as universal, and I'm not condemning clipping necessarily,  But on a personal note, I'm not entirely comfortable with damaging a bird's primary method of movement for its own good. I think it negatively effects confidence, and I think it puts the bird under a lot more stress.  Plus, it removes autonomy. I have Rori trained to fly to his stand whenever he needs to go potty. He flies back to my desk, and I give him a treat. It's become so second nature that it happens when I'm not paying attention. Rori will land on my desk and say ""Good Boy"" to me if he doesn't get his treat. :P You'd be amazed how far simply ignoring undesirable behavior, and rewarding good behavior will get you.  The fact that you are asking means you are taking all the right steps. Making a new feathered friend is a powerfully rewarding experience. (you know that already) As long as you are diligent and attentive, you'll do great! :D Conures are fun little fuzzballs full of love, and they are known for their snuggles. Rori falls asleep in the crook of my neck all the time, and every time it melts my heart onto the floor. I wish you the best, and I'm tagging you as Baby on the Way!  ~Cybertoaster"
parrots,3cp0cp,Doctor_Slendy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:28:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great reply! I totally agree with you about the wing clipping, I feel it would be equivalent to cutting off a persons legs! I have never had any of my budgies wings clipped for this reason, and I love it when they fly to you for the first time, as it really shows how much they trust you.  I am excited to try the potty training, as that was a concept only one of my budgies was able to pick up.  I am going to try pressure training with my conure, because I have read that they are nippy, which does not bother me, as you said you have to learn your bird's signs and when he is telling you to stop, but I do want to get him well socialized with other people. I am hoping I get lucky and just get a bird that never bites, like my last budgie ;)  What kinds of foods are you feeding Rori? And do you make any toys yourself?"
parrots,3cp0cp,Doctor_Slendy,2,Sat Jul 11 12:32:23 2015 UTC,"That's really great to hear! Sometimes I'll build my own stuff, but I'm usually really busy working from home. (Great because I get to spend all day with Rori, but it doesn't exactly leave much time for toy fabrication.) I did build him a PVC perch. Go to any home depot, buy some grip tape, some PVC, and some connector pieces, and its practically like building something out of K'nex. Any thing you have can be a bird toy. I put a bunch of hinged and rotatable lego pieces on a base, and it kept him busy for hours! Rori loves bells, and any toy he can use to make noise. He also has taken to chasing my DnD dice around my desk with ferocious tenacity, Which is totally adorable.  Mostly I have Harrisons in his food bowl. He goes and eats whenever he's hungry, and it's never been a problem. I try to offer an alternative at least once a day, but sometimes it will be every couple of days. I give him mostly fruits, carrots, and scrambled eggs. Every once in awhile I'll give him a dried fruit and nut blend he seems to go crazy for. Introducing him to new foods is always fun and entertaining.  Edit: Obligatory Rori Picture!"
parrots,3cp0cp,Doctor_Slendy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:51:43 2015 UTC,"Also, I wanted to add this. Make sure you make it very clear to the breeder that you want to keep him flighted. Most breeders clip the baby's wings as standard practice, and will sometimes do so simply as a part of protocol. When I was about to take Rori home, she didn't even ask. she just explained that she was about to go do it, and I had to tell her not to."
parrots,3cp0cp,CyberToaster,2,Sat Jul 11 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"My breeder keeps her babies flighted, she also thinks its an important part of being a bird! She will not clip unless asked to :) Also Rori is quite cute!"

parrots,3csgzz,Charlie24601,2,Fri Jul 10 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Some people have exterior cats to deal with pests or simply for company. Besides, the world is full of stray cats. I'm not a fan of them either, but what are we supposed to do, lock them down or kill them all? Leaving a cat oustide is pretty much the usual in our society, while leaving a defenseless bird outside and unattended demonstrates poor decision making and lack of common sense. OP is responsible for the bird and it's still her fault."
parrots,3csgzz,canlickherelbow,6,Fri Jul 10 13:51:37 2015 UTC,"Sure.  And some people used cane toads and mongoose to deal with pests.  Cats were introduced to the islands where the Kakapo parrot lived, and to Stephen Island, home of the Stephen Islands Wren.  Why don't you go google those and tell me how it all went down.  It may be poor decision making for OP, but yes, I am 100% behind killing feral cats, and 100% behind keeping all cats indoors, in a catio, or at the very least supervised on a lease."

parrots,3csgzz,canlickherelbow,8,Fri Jul 10 14:51:58 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to leave this here. (Also for /u/sabrunka)  This is also an article (one) covering the study (a bit easier to read if you don't want to go through the whole paper).   Basically from MANY different published studies (some as recent as 2013) we know that cats have a huge impact on local wildlife. While the numbers of animals killed in the UK tend to be in the millions, in the US this is in the billions. Not only do we not know the exact impact of this invasive species on native populations, but exact counts are nearly impossible as it is estimated that cats return only 1/3 of the prey they kill (either eating the rest of leaving them behind).  ""Cats never really bother anybody"" is like saying ""Global warming doesn't exist because we still have winter"". Just because you can't see a glaringly obvious impact doesn't mean it isn't real. The only reason we DON'T know the full impact of this introduced predator on our ecosystems (i.e. will this affect population trends in the future, are vulnerable or endangered species being affected, or what the indirect effects of high, introduced predator densities are) is because a study at this scale (monitoring all cats/kills/affected wildlife in a sizable area for a long period of time) is a huge undertaking, something that might become more possible in the future.   Overall, the great thing about this most recent study is it shows that even IF cat owners understand that their pets are killing wildlife they are unwilling to do anything to mitigate this.   So while I'm not down with killing tons of animals just to save a few more, I do agree with /u/Charlie24601 that feral AND domesticated cats allowed to run loose without supervision is careless and harmful to native wildlife. You know it is 100% possible to let your cat be outside, while you still watch it or keep it contained in your yard right? Some people even use leashes if their cat accepts them. Let me repeat: cats should be able to go outside while supervised, but you saying ""the world is full of stray cats... Leaving a cat oustide is pretty much the usual in our society"" as justification simply perpetuates irresponsible pet ownership. Someone shouldn't be berated for leaving a bird outside, when people do the same with their cats/dogs all the time. Either it's irresponsible for all or none."

Humans extirpated the wolf from the NE United States and white tail deer populations skyrocketed.  We have NO CHOICE but to kill them and allow hunting.  If we didn't, we'd see the problems we saw in Massachusetts in the 1920's (?  I think it was around this time.  Its been a while since I read the paper on it) THOUSANDS upon THOUSANDS of deer eating every blade of grass and every leaf within reach leading to starvation, desolated areas, etc etc.  Sorry, but when we create a serious environmental issue, it is our job to fix it properly.  So yes.  Those cats need to be exterminated, and personal pet cats must be kept in captivity.

Even if she looks fine now, cat saliva is very toxic and can kill birds quickly.  2) Don't EVER leave a bird outside unattended. Any birds we keep as pets are prey animals in the wild. If it's not a cat, it's a dog, or a raptor, or any number of environmental factors that can make birds sick, or worse.  3) Don't be angry with the cat. Cats are predators and just doing what comes naturally to them. A bird in a cage is just a meal they don't have to hunt down. They don't know the difference between a wild bird and a pet bird.  4) I hope she's okay, but please get her to a vet. Only they will be able to tell you the extent of the damage."

parrots,3ctl75,LatzeH,5,Fri Jul 10 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"You know, I saw your other post on theparrotforum and I have to say you shouldn't expect any advice other that what you already heard there.   You give one example of a professional zoo that supposably does this (though I can't find more info about it online) but you are merely using it as justification for your idea without considering all of the glaring red flags. First of all, lovebirds are a completely different species than quakers, with different social systems and methods of flock formation. You should not be comparing them to your birds, especially since the instances of mortality in wild quaker flocks is particularly high. You also should not assume anything about your birds (basically that they will return) because they have zero experience living in the wild.   You don't want us to tell you that this is too dangerous for your birds (like everyone did in the last thread) but it's important that you understand this fact: by letting your birds fly free you are essentially committing them to an early death. As a responsible pet owner you should be trying your best to avoid things like disease, predators, poisoning from native plants, the elements, and accidents. You already have an aviary where they can fly freely; there is no reason why you should allow an animal raised in captivity to experience potentially getting lost, eaten, sick, or hurt because of some desire to see them in their non-native habitat.    These are not assumptions that I am making, they are facts. Just google facts about escaped parrots in cities to see that their expected lifespans are usually cut in half at best due to all of the foreign dangers."
parrots,3ctl75,budgiefacedkiller,-2,Fri Jul 10 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"sorry about spamming your boards :p I just thought I'd probably get some more scientifically based answers on here than on the parrot forums. To address your comment, I'd like to point out that a wild population of lovebirds have actually established a colony on a danish island, so I'm thinking they do know how to handle themselves. You say I shouldn't be comparing lovebirds to monks, but if there is anything that I've gathered from the hours I've spent ""researching"" this on google, it is that lovebirds are extremely social animals, and that they do in fact live in flocks in the wild. I also gathered that wild populations tend to stay around a viable food source when they find one, and the fact that we witnessed the behavior that I'm looking for with the birds that got out of their cage, all 5 of which were caught and put back into the cage; they simply did not stray from the flock. some of them were out for 3 days, and none of them ventured out beyond the ""boarders"" of where I live as i described them in the original post.  Also, please excuse me if I'm a pain to discuss things with, it just seems that most people on theparrotforums just said no because the idea sounds outrageous to them, and not actually because they know anything about it, since very few of them actually believed my story about the danish zoo which keeps monks like this, which I for the record am 100% sure about."
parrots,3ctl75,budgiefacedkiller,3,Fri Jul 10 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"All of your comments in they thread so far are supposed ""proof"" that your birds will be able to survive in the wild and faithfully return to your aviary but in reality your logic is completely flawed.    From what I can gather from various websites, rosy-faced lovebirds actually DO use communal nests, unlike the other lovebird species....I also have a source which says that lovebirds roost (sleep and rest) communally... lovebirds are extremely social animals, and that they do in fact live in flocks in the wild. I also gathered that wild populations tend to stay around a viable food   I really don't think you understand what you are saying here. You are trying to justify letting your birds loose, to face predators, disease, starvation, etc. by saying that they MUST be able to survive because you think being social makes them fit for the wild? I also don't think you understand bird behavior at all (all parrots (with maybe the exception of the kakapo?) are social, flock together, and tend to roost together), or what we are trying to explain to you.   The reasons why your birds will not survive in the wild are not specific to lovebirds. They are specific to CAPTIVE birds. CAPTIVE birds do not have the skills necessary to flourish in the wild. Some may get extremely lucky, find some buddies, and survive for a very short while. But in the end they still only live to be half of their expected age, at best. Birds are released or accidentally escape from their home every day. Since so many birds go missing all the time, why aren't we seeing hundreds of feral parrots colonies all over the world? Because 99% of them don't make it.   But please go ahead. You obviously have your mind set on letting these defenseless animals go, even though your knowledge of basic ecology, animal husbandry, and responsible pet ownership is sorely lacking. YOU ARE NOT A ZOO. So please don't justify your decisions with the logic that ""they are doing it so why can't I?"". Those keepers are trained biologists working with vets and other experts. You are twisting information from the internet into support for your argument.  And FYI, the reason you don't see people doing this sort of reckless free flight thing is not because it ""sounds outrageous"" (even though it really does). They are saying no to your idea because the only ones that are going to be hurt by your actions are your birds. And as fellow bird owners it's really shitty seeing them being put into such a situation."

In this case though you aren't looking for discussion, only validation that your idea might work. You've also not offered a single shred of actual proof (a lot of ""oh I heard this"" or ""they do it so why can't I"" or ""I'm assuming it's okay""). You are not a trained animal behaviorist and so cannot make assumptions about animal behavior from something as trivial as ""lovebirds roost together at night, etc"" (something that most social birds do).   Finally, if you spend time around this sub you will see that the people here are extremely diligent about the health and safety of their birds. That is why you are being downvoted and generally disagreed with. As soon as a bird is seen in a compromising situation there is always a multitude of people ready to jump in with helpful advice or words of warning. So please don't talk about us advocating tiny cages and cruel conditions when that is simply the exact opposite of the truth. In fact, one of the biggest points of contention here is people taking their birds outside without a harness. Again, only because of a general understanding of the risks. My advice thus far has been given in the interest of keeping your birds alive. Take it as you will, but don't expect to find any sympathy here if something does go wrong."

It's actually a survival mechanism ""you won't eat me if you think I'm cute,"" sort of thing. The best thing you can do is give him some time to adjust and then slowly start doing some trust building exercises. There's tons of info on this online. One thing that helped my lovebird was watching tv next to him. He liked the noises and the pictures and soon, learned to like my company. Now we're inseparable. In fact, I'm currently sitting with him in an airport getting ready to board a seven hour flight because I knew he'd be devastated if I left him with the babysitter."
parrots,3cqu4h,mileysmustache,2,Fri Jul 10 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"As /u/mileysmustache stated, it's not uncommon for birds to be friendly during the initial ""honeymoon phase"" of a new home. However, getting a bird fully adjusted and comfortable in a new environment takes time and patience.   Some things you can do are:   Spend time near the bird without physically interacting with him. This means sitting near the cage and reading or talking. This allows him to get accustomed to your presence and voice without the stresses of handling. Make all interactions as pleasant and positive as possible. Offer tons of his favorite treats so that he associates you with things that he likes. Let him set the pace. Don't force interactions. Use treats to coax him to you, and allow him to approach you. Don't chase him - it will only make him more fearful of you.

It's not as clunky and the leash attaches at the front, rather than the back like on the Flight Suit."
parrots,3cpsn4,painesgrey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:32 2015 UTC,Does the flightsuit's leash attach by velcro? by bird i think would be able to either fly and make the velcro release the leash or just pull it off with his beak.
parrots,3cpsn4,painesgrey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"The suit closure is velcro and the leash attaches there with velcro (the velcro leash attachment goes between the two velcro pieces of the suit), but holds very firmly.

parrots,3cpv86,Synthyx,6,Thu Jul 9 20:35:13 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of parrots becoming aggressive in cages because the cages are too large. However, cage aggression is a thing and is largely linked to hormonal/territorial behavior.  You want to make sure that the cage is appropriate for a bird of your size. That is, bar spacing is usually the biggest difference between cages made for small/medium parrots and those made for larger parrots.   You want to make sure that the bar spacing is small enough that the bird cannot get its head between the bars. Otherwise you risk the bird injuring itself.  The other factor in how big a cage needs to be is how much time the parrot will be spending in the cage.   A smaller cage can be adequate if the vast majority of the bird's time is spent outside of the cage.   tl;dr - outside of bar spacing, there's really no ""too big"" when it comes to bird cages."
parrots,3cpv86,painesgrey,3,Thu Jul 9 20:46:16 2015 UTC,"It's really more about the bar spacing. In many cases, the larger the cage is the wider the space between the bars. That's where things get sticky for the little guys. If your bird can fit his head through the bars, there's a problem. Broken limbs and necks, getting stuck, escapes...not worth the risk.   If the large cage in question has proper bar spacing, then it's not really an issue. But I've met a bird who broke her wing by falling from the top of a really tall cage. Owner kept her clipped, so she tumbled with no way to catch herself. That said, your bird is going to find some amazing way to hurt itself at some point during its life. They do that.   Mind the bar spacing. Other than that, I say go for it."
parrots,3cpv86,CygnusZeroStar,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"Our birds live in a room with open cages in it. They can and do travel freely from one cage to the other. In a sense, there is no cage, just the room. They are not aggressive. They're sweet as pie.  Our two budgies live in a large flight cage. They aren't tame."
parrots,3cpv86,sbhikes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"Bigger will always be better, especially if you plan on keep your bird inside it for stretches of 4-5+ hours. A bird should not become more aggressive in a large cage, in fact, having more space/toys/places to play and forage is more likely to result in a bird that is less stressed.  If your bird is aggressive because it is feeling possessive of its space, the size of that space will not come into play. Territorial birds are just as likely to attack you in a tiny box or a huge flight cage. Source: my parrotlet is just as dickish in his flight cage as he was in his original tiny budgie cube. He's way less bored now though (so many toys to kill) and chirps a lot less which is nice.  Bar spacing though is the most important like everyone else has said."

parrots,3claug,winterisforhome,18,Wed Jul 8 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"So in case you haven't heard- Saskatchewan is on fire. Saskatchewan has this problem where either our spring/summer is a constant flood of rain and nothing can grow and there's a serious mosquito problem. Or our spring/summer is so dry that nothing can grow and everything catches on fire.  There's not too much of an inbetween.  Anyway, this year Mother Nature decided the latter option was a good idea, and the northern half of the province has been ablaze for weeks now. I'm not talking about a few fires and a ""no fireworks"" warning- I mean that this is one of the worst fire situations in the history of the province, if not Western Canada. Thousands of people have had to leave their communities and flee to the southern part of the province.  The majority of the bigger cities and towns are here in the south, but even so, the smoke has travelled down and made visibility simply awful some days. The air quality rating hit a record low and people were advised to not go outside some days. Some highways have been closed because you just cannot see anything. Our hotels and shelters are flooded with evacuees.   Not only did people have to leave their homes and communities, more often than not, they had to leave their pets. There are thousands of dogs and cats that have been left up north, with their owners hours away in the south. Now before you judge, keep in mind that the majority of these communities were given just hours to leave, and many people had to leave by bus. These are not wealthy communities, many people do not have their own cars, or reliable cars. They were forced to leave their animals behind.   There have been many, MANY rescue efforts to get these animals out of there. I can't even list the number of dog food companies who have donated over 11,000 pounds of dog food up north, I can't even list the number of people in the south who have risked their lives to go up there and get the animals, the number of people in the south who have opened their doors for multiple dogs and cats. The communities down here have really come together to help these creatures.  The parrot rescue that I'm a part of here in southern Saskatchewan has opened their doors for any birds! We've spread the word as much as possible all across Facebook- we want people to know that their birds have a safe place to go down here and that no bird needs to be left behind up there.  Yesterday, I took in Gizmo! He's a 10 month old brown headed parrot, his owner was from one of the more recent communities that had to be evacuated. With only hours to leave, and very limited space in her car, she was forced to put him in a hamster cage and bring him down here. She heard about us, and knew that it was probably better he stay in a stable house with a bigger cage as opposed to a hotel room. This woman loves Gizmo SO very much, she truly has his best interest at heart, and the connection between them is priceless! It was very hard for her to leave him with me yesterday, and I understand- she's had to leave her community, her home, and now her bird. I keep in contact with her over text as much as possible, and she is welcome to visit him any time!  I don't know how long Gizmo will be staying with me; it could be a couple days, it could be a couple weeks. I'm happy to have him with me, and his owner is wonderful, I have no complaints! He's a very laid back little guy, not noisy or easily startled at all. I cleaned up my conures old (but in great condition) cage that I keep for situations like these, and set it up with many perches and brand new toys! He's settled in just great and is showing no signs of stress whatsoever. There's two toys in the cage that he absolutely loves, so when he has to go home, I'll let him take those with him:)  Please pray for all these animals and their owners who have been evacuated! We have hundreds of amazing firemen up there, they've even come from Alberta, Newfoundland, and South Dakota. We have our amazing military that has gone north with their tanks and such as well. The province has really come together and helped each other in this crazy, stressful time. The fires show no sign of letting up, in fact yesterday was reportedly the worst day yet. So please pray for us and pray for the one thing we need most- rain.  EDIT: Wow, wow, wow, thank you for the gold! And thank you everyone for all the kind words and your willingness to help! If you're interested in donating to anything, check out the comments below- I've replied to several questions and there are many links to Facebook pages and groups that you can be involved in and help out with. Unfortunately, a statement was released this morning (July 9) that these fires likely won't end until it snows in fall (late October typically). I also work with a wildlife rescue, and I'm sure we'll be asking people to assess damage up north and let us know of any orphaned wildlife.  Doesn't matter where you are, you can help the animals and humans affected by these fires; just check out my comments below. Thanks again SO much guys!!"

My rescue,  Saskatoon Parrot Rescue, www.saskatoonparrotrescue.ca, is not overwhelmed with evacuee birds at this time. Birds simply aren't a popular pet up in those areas, it's the dogs that are coming down in groups of 50 to 100 at a time. My rescue doesn't need help at this time when it comes to parrots though. But thank you so much, the gesture alone is amazing!  If you do want to help though, please check out the Prince Albert SPCA, as they are the city that has taken in the most animals. You can donate on their site through PayPal here,  http://www.princealbertspca.com/donate_direct.html  If you know someone who is going to Saskatchewan in the coming days, it would be great to organize some items and bring them over. Pets are in need of food (unopened bagged food, canned food), and most definitely blankets! If you or a friend would like to send any of that our way, you can join this group. We've had people from BC and Toronto post on there and find ways to give! You could also reach out to Saskatoon/Prince Albert/Regina vet clinics and rescues and donate money- perhaps in the amount of a check-up or a spay/neuter procedure.   If you'd like to help people, they're in need of clothing, baby items, toiletries, games for kids (think more along the lines of small travel games rather than Monopoly), toys, blankets, non-perishables. We're having issues with the Red Cross as they're not accepting item donations despite people truly needing them. The community has taken things into their own hands, and the best group to learn more about what is needed and how to get it to Sask, would be this one. There's a pinned post on the top of that group with locations in different towns on where to donate.  Even if you or a friend aren't going to Saskatchewan any time soon, it'd be great to post in one of those groups about what you have and where you are- you never know who may be going through your town and coming back to Saskatchewan that is happy to transport donations!  Thank you for your concern, and thank you for dealing with our smoke all these weeks;P"

He hopped right onto his mamas hand and they sat on the couch and just played with him. They're welcome to come by any time, and I make sure to let them know they're welcome! They miss him dearly but they know this is the best thing to do given the situation they're in. I can absolutely see the love between them all and I hope they all get home as soon as possible, but unfortunately the area they're from has fires just a stones throw away from their front door and firefighters are working overtime to make sure it doesn't spread and burn down anything major.

The amazing firefighters and military are doing their absolute best to keep things contained, however, just in the last few hours here there has been a plea for 250 more volunteer firefighters to go north. Just about everyone knows someone who has gone up there to get these wildfires under control.   Thank you, Gizmo is doing great! I'm glad I could help him, and his owner is coming by tomorrow so I'm sure she's very much looking forward to that!  I'm a board member at the Saskatoon Parrot Rescue, http://www.saskatoonparrotrescue.ca/ . We are a group of 8 dedicated members that help run this rescue. Right now we have 20 birds I believe, we're typically in the range of 13-20 at any given time. These past few months have been very busy as we've taken in three macaws (all were in pretty bad shape), a feisty Amazon, and two cockatiels. We take them in, get them checked out at the vet, assess their behaviors, and then hopefully find them forever homes with an appropriate family. Finding a family isn't always the easiest thing, as Saskatchewan has a pretty small population. We try to be as involved in the community as we can. We're the only parrot rescue in Saskatchewan (we are a registered non-profit, by the way) therefore we basically serve all of Saskatchewan, not just Saskatoon. You can keep up with us on Facebook here if you'd like. Thanks again:)"

parrots,3cn3y4,piastix,12,Thu Jul 9 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"A cracked beak is a serious injury.  It's very painful and can bleed a lot.  If it's cracked all the way through, it can make it very hard for your bird to eat (too painful) or drink from a bottle.  Give her a bowl of water.  Discourage any flying (which makes the bird's blood flow through the beak).  Get your bird to an avian vet ASAP.  You can skip the pet store and go straight to the vet.  Depending on how badly it's cracked it may need surgery.  In the future you should keep some Metacam (a painkiller) for birds.  Have your vet calculate the dosage (it's different per species and various manufacturers have different concentration).  Better yet, have some styptic powder on hand.  It stops bleeding and is a mild painkiller.  It's not as strong as Metacam though."
parrots,3cn3y4,MikeBenza,3,Thu Jul 9 05:28:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you for your reply. I don't think it's a bad crack, it stopped bleeding on it's own even before I got to it with the flour, but .. yeah. I will call the vet and see about arranging a ride to get us there.  Definitely gonna buy the styptic powder, though. It's been on my list for a while.. go figure."
parrots,3cn3y4,Fluent_English_Riter,7,Thu Jul 9 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"Birds have significantly less blood than humans. Obvious, yes, but worth mentioning. If your parrot bleeds at all, it's considered an emergency. Remember, birds pretend that everything is fine when they are hurt to blend in with the flock, and when they finally do start behaving as if they are injured, it can be too late to save them. Watch her very closely, and get her to an avian vet as fast as humanly possible."
parrots,3cn3y4,Fluent_English_Riter,4,Thu Jul 9 05:47:57 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I definitely know & have my eye on her. I was just hoping I wouldn't have to try and make arrangements to get to the vet.. but, I will. I'll get her there for sure.  My city seriously needs an avian vet."
parrots,3cn3y4,Sooawesome36,2,Thu Jul 9 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"Good to hear. If you're having trouble finding an avian vet, I'm pretty sure they have a registry. American Avian Board Certified (if you're US)...or something like that. You can look at regular vets too. Check their website and chances are they have a vet who specializes in birds. It can be deceptive considering all you see on vets' homepages is cats and dogs. Attention whores..."
parrots,3cn3y4,Sooawesome36,3,Thu Jul 9 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the closest one is on the guy that's almost an hour away. He comes to town a couple times a month, but I highly doubt tomorrow will be my lucky day that he'll be in town when I need him.  Unfortunately, I have asked every single vet in town, and all but one have given an absolute ""no"" to birds (which is a little surprising, there are a lot of bird owners here). The one who said he will look at birds can be a little unreliable (he does house calls, and I needed him for an emergency visit a few years back for my lizard, he never returned my calls), and he's not on the registry, so I'd like to avoid seeing him if possible, but if I absolutely cannot find a ride to the avian vet, I'll give him a call."

I'm not able to help out, but I did want you to know that Open Wings Sanctuary is in your area, and in my experience adopting through them, they are very good.  If you do not find someone to take care of Hyperion, you might look into them."
parrots,3co8vy,saabstory88,3,Thu Jul 9 13:16:48 2015 UTC,"I think if this is the first time doing some regular grooming with a newly re-socialized bird, you should get a vet or knowledgeable groomer to do it. Then you won't do any damage to your newly forged relationship with the bird. Then it can be some stranger that is the ""bad guy"" and you guys can come in for the rescue. Once you see how he reacts you can start taking on the grooming yourself. That's what I did, now I am able to do nail and wing trims myself. It was something I knew how to do before, but didn't want to damage the relationship with my bird until I was sure he could handle the whole ordeal well. Also if the nails are long and overgrown it might be a good idea to have a ""professional"" do it in case they start to bleed.   If it was me though, I think I'd do the nails first to keep them from getting snagged and tangled up in a towel while you are trying to do the wing clip. If you bird shows extreme signs of stress from the get go, I'd just do a nail a day or every few days. Eventually you'll get them all. Just make sure you offer lots of treats and stuff after. I guarantee he'll freak when he sees the towel though because he'll know what's coming after awhile. My bird does, he sees the nail clippers and the towel and tries to make himself scarce. I have to catch him first then take him to the towel, not the other way around.   I don't think you could pay me enough money to man handle and groom a Grey though. My co-worker has one and I've seen the type of damage they can inflict if they get a good hold on your flesh.    *Edit, if you are determined to do the grooming yourself, maybe start easing your bird into some interaction with a towel. Have it out during play time. Drape it over him loosely and make game of it."
parrots,3co8vy,SamusAran388,2,Thu Jul 9 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"Typically I do nail clippings in 2 trips. One for one foot, one for the other. After I'm done one foot he's so freaked out and tensed up he needs to chill for a bit. I would do the same with the wings, so about 4 trips total. If he seems pretty relaxed while you're doing it - I'd try to get it done in one shot. Try to do your best to hold him, but cover his head. That's what I find works best.  Good luck. I'd full well expect for him to draw some blood. Mine is the biggest sweetheart, but wowzers he doesn't like his toe nails being clipped. I've never even hit his quicks before."
parrots,3cmvmv,Froslads,3,Thu Jul 9 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"Without a full work-up to eliminate the chances of any communicable diseases or parasites, it's impossible to know whether the bird has anything that can be transmitted to your lovebird.  It's always a good idea to quarantine any new additions (temporary or permanent) to your flock for 30 days. It can be pretty demanding, but worth it for all parties. Here is a site that goes into more detail."
parrots,3cmvmv,painesgrey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:45:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely see if you can get him to an avian vet. Just to check, make sure it's not mites/lice.  Other than that, baths.

parrots,3cm185,budgiefacedkiller,4,Thu Jul 9 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"Drafty is only bad if it is 24/7 and chilled air (like a cracked window in winter or right next to an AC vent). Drafty = chilled bird = higher susceptibility to illness or stress. In the same way that a warm breeze doesn't bother birds in the wild, fans in the summer aren't harmful for your bird (especially if they are far away, like on the ceiling). In fact, now with no AC our apartment gets pretty hot during midday and Simon will come and preen in front of the fan when we're trying to cool down."
parrots,3cm185,miparasito,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:04:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's exactly what I wanted to know.  Tasha is pretty complacent, so it's hard to know if something bothers her, sometimes."
parrots,3cm185,budgiefacedkiller,2,Thu Jul 9 02:16:10 2015 UTC,"My son calls bullshit on the whole ""birds can't handle drafts"" - he says A) they normally live outside and it is not possible for them to avoid breezes 100% of the time and B) isn't flying basically like having wind blow right in their face?  (Disclaimer: I think he raises good points, but please don't follow the advice of an eight year old over your vet!)"
parrots,3cm185,miparasito,3,Thu Jul 9 06:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah it makes sense, the only caveat being that birds outside can choose to avoid drafts if they want. So while a bird that is flying for 10 mins obviously isn't in danger from the wind, being trapped in a cage 27/7 next to a chilly AC vent can stress their thermoregulatory abilities unnecessarily. When people say to avoid drafts around your birds it's because these are usually cold and persistent, unlike something like a ceiling fan providing a gentle/warm breeze in the summer."
parrots,3cm185,awkward_titanium,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"I have definitely thought this, but they are canopy birds, which means they have less exposure to open air, so I'm really not sure. Your son is very logical though :)"

parrots,3cl4ku,budgiefacedkiller,3,Wed Jul 8 19:27:24 2015 UTC,"I recently (May) adopted a pair of assholish sweet and lovable cockatiels. They were about 4.5 years old when I got them.    We have a parrot rescue in my section of the state, and I went through them.  They aren't technically a non-profit right now, because their paperwork is in bureaucratic limbo.    For the process: I had been stalking the rescue for probably 9ish months as I settled in after moving into the area.  I knew I wanted a bird, and with living in an apartment, I wanted one of the smaller ones (cockatiel, parrotlet, etc.).  I was keeping an eye on their listings to see if they had any come in that might be a good match.  They had one older (~10ish) cockatiel come in, but someone else applied and got him before I was able to.    At the same time, I discovered that they have a monthly meetup at a restaurant that lets them use their patio.  I ended up going to it and hanging out with the people.  It was a mix of birds up for rescue, and personal birds.  Generally 3-4 macaws, a couple greys, and then an assortment of all sorts of birds (including a Hawkhead, who I had not met before).  I talked to them about what my lifestyle was like, and what types of birds I was interested in.    They gave me some advice, and at the next meeting, they mentioned they got a pair of cockatiels in. That had been together since a very young age, but were moderately human friendly.  Their owner had to go to college, and the parents didn't want to take care of them, so they were being given up.   I filled out their application form, and sent it in. One of them did a home inspection, which was very cursory for me, because I had been chatting with them for 3 months, and they were fairly satisfied that I knew what I was talking about. I then drove out to the foster's home to spend some time with the cockatiels.  They were a bit skittish, but did settle down relatively well.  I probably spent an hour or so with them.  I thought about it for a day or two, and then told them I would adopt them.  The volunteer drove the birds and their cage over to me, and I got in possession of them.  The rescue does request that they do a another inspection (or possibly just a phone call, depending on circumstances) after a month or two, but because both I and the cockatiels showed up at their monthly meetings, they decided that they could skip that step.    Price: I got the two cockatiels, their massive flight cage, and all of the toys in it in that picture for $125.  This rescue tries to keep the birds in the same cage with the same toys as they transition to help them make it more comfortably. Adoption fees from their website look they range between $75 (small birds) up to $500 (Macaws).  They don't have any birds that are particularly rare up for adoption, but they have said that there are some (like the hawkhead), that they will either not adopt out due to breeders, or that they will set pretty high prices on.  I think pretty much all of the birds come with their cage, and from what I've seen, the cages are pretty decent quality.  I've addressed a decent amount of 4 throughout, except for current condition.  The cockatiels are definitely friendly, and generally come out to me pretty well.  They are completely inseprable, and get very distressed if they are any distance apart.  Neither will let me give them a head rub yet, but one of them tries to preen my face.  They are both content sitting on me and preening (most commonly, one sits on the inside of my left elbow, the other likes my right wrist.  They both complain loudly if I move).  They are not at all spoiled rotten. Other than millet, they won't eat anything other than their normal food.  I am currently transitioning them from their previous diet (50/50 mix of cockatiel seeds and pellets) over to Harrison's pellets.  If I missed anything, or you have any other questions, let me know.  EDIT: Other costs that I forgot to mention.  Visit to a vet for a routine physical and checkup was $400.  Visit to the emergency vet that evening when one decided to have a stress reaction and went semi-comatose was another $200.  The emergency vet said that I should just  wait and see if he changes at all, because he couldn't find anything physically obvious.  He did give him a antiinflammatory injection.  The normal vet later said that his suspicion based on the description of what happened is that my cockatiel may have had a hypoglycemic stress reaction, which apparently sometimes happens in birds.  The other possibility is that he has some brain damage from an incident in his past where he apparently flew into a mirror, and had seizures and vomiting for a little bit before he recovered.  About 2.5 days after this incident, he was fully recovered and back to normal, but it is something I'll watch for during any possible stressful events.    I've also spent maybe $150 on outfitting a travel cage and getting some random toys and whatnot to improve their cage and stand a little more.  EDIT 2: Not enough pictures.  Them in their cage. After a shower, where neither got very wet."
parrots,3cl4ku,kerovon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:48:12 2015 UTC,Wow. Thanks a lot for the fantastic response. This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. It sounds like the monthly meetings were super useful in getting the inside scoop about the rescue/its birds. And while the process took some effort/patience it seems like you enjoyed yourself. Thanks again for sharing!
parrots,3cl4ku,kerovon,2,Thu Jul 9 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"The monthly meetings were great.  Between 8 to 20 bird people show up, and we spend a couple hours playing with each others birds and chatting about birds.  Also because of my exposure to them, it basically fast tracked me through the approval process, and I suspect put me to the head of the adoption list. I'm planning on continuing to go to the bird meetings whenever I can, just because it gets me my monthly bird person interaction time."
parrots,3cl4ku,StringOfLights,2,Thu Jul 9 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"Ugh I'm seriously jealous. I can only hope that my next move takes me to a larger city or place with similar congregations of parrot lovers. Unfortunately, though my town is known for their bird lab, the people it attracts fall firmly in the ""birder"" category. It's so hard to chat about my fids when all they care about is rare warbler X or Y. :'("
parrots,3cl4ku,StringOfLights,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"My two budgies were left outside a pet store and adopted through the store's nonprofit rescue, so I didn't go through a typical parrot rescue. That meant they came with no names, no history, nothing. I knew they were adults and I got to figure everything out from there.   Nobody wanted these guys, and the store manager bypassed all but the most minimal fees for me. I got them for $10, including their cage. Which I tossed because it was way too small.   I heard about them because a friend saw them at the store and knew I had experience with birds. I went to look at them, saw how scared they were, and took them on the spot (although oddly enough I'd pulled out some old bird stuff I had on hand before I went...hmm). I took them because I couldn't leave them, which is maybe not the best logic.   I didn't realize it right away, but they were in way worse shape than I anticipated. They were all ratty from their poor diet and hitting their feathers on their cage bars. They had no toys. Worst of all was how scared they were. They'd pretty clearly been grabbed and handled roughly. I thought one bird was going to die of fright when my hand went near him. The other had been trained to step up, but it was forced. He was miserable but obedient, which broke my heart.  Once I got them in a bigger cage I also realized they were too weak to fly.   It's been a year and a half and they are doing amazingly well! I was able to switch up their diet and their health improved immensely. With more space and time out of their cage, they've learned to fly. They are spoiled rotten with toys.   My goal was to get them comfortable enough with me for them to handle a vet visit, which they did. They responded well to clicker training and target training, and that helped me bond with them. They sing when they see me now, and they both step up and do a few tricks. The bird I thought might die of fright is now learning flight recall. The next big hurdle is to socialize them more with other people (the hurdle being finding people willing to socialize with my budgies).   I would not recommend an inexperienced owner do what I did. These guys are little, but this was bird training in hard mode: they were never tamed, mistreated, and fearful. I thought I had experience and I still felt lost. It took patience I didn't know I had. Forums like this were so helpful for guidance, which is why I invest time here. Trainers like Barbara Heidenreich really helped get me in the right mindset.   I didn't know how far these birds come, so every time we make a breakthrough it's a delight. I'd say for the last few months I've been able to enjoy them as companions rather than focus on their rehabilitation. I regularly get budgie cuddles now!   I don't mention my experience to discourage anyone from rescuing, because I think there's a very good chance of finding a bird with no major issues beyond needing a good home. Parrots are amazingly long-lived and are difficult to plan for, so a lot of birds simply outlive their owners. I took a big gamble by taking birds with no history or vetting from a dedicated parrot rescue.   Although progress could be slow, I've genuinely enjoyed the process of helping these birds. I think it's important to enjoy the process of training and handling your bird even if it's not all fun and games, and I think that's true whether a bird is a rescue or not.   Overall, I see my little guys as proof that these animals are capable of a lot more than we give them credit for. I'm so glad I could give them a chance, and I'm grateful they gave me one.

parrots,3cl4ku,JumpingPuddleDucks,2,Thu Jul 9 07:51:48 2015 UTC,"Wallace and Charlie both look so stinkin' happy. :) And your progress is really inspiring.   I do wonder though what you think about the pet store/rescue you got them from? I know the topic gets pretty heated on the sub, though due to my lack of experience with such operations I am neutral about the matter. Do you feel like there was a conflict of interests in this case (I mean their shop must also sell baby birds right, so doesn't this take away from some of their efforts to reduce instances of abandoned birds through the rescue)? Were they good about finding the right family for a rescued bird and providing them with decent care or was it more like the predominant pet shop mentality of I need to sell these birds?"
parrots,3cl4ku,jacobsheep,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:50 2015 UTC,"That pet store did sell birds, and I didn't really like it. They were not particularly responsible about what they did. It was not a place I shopped, but I went in there because I had heard about the budgies who needed a home. Budgies are fairly common in local dog and cat shelters as well. They chatter a lot, so people get sick of the noise and just drop them off at a shelter.   I know for dogs and cats the pet store worked with a local shelter to get animals adopted out. It's really unfortunate that they don't do the same for birds. I think they stopped selling larger parrots, but they really don't view budgies the same way.  At the price the store gave them to me, which was well below their normal adoption fee, they made absolutely no money on them, since they fed and housed them for a couple of weeks.   Personally, I would not ever buy a bird. I don't begrudge people who do as long as they're responsible about it, but I really have no desire to when there so many who need help. I guess these guys are lucky I found them, because someone inexperienced who thought they were getting a deal on two parakeets would not have been able to handle them.    The employees had taken kind of a liking to the birds, and I think they were really relieved that I had some experience and knew what I was doing. I remember the guy who helped me carry the birds out to the car was talking to them quietly and saying, ""Look, guys, it's the sky! I bet you haven't seen a lot of that. You're going home. You're going to be so happy now."" It was really touching. So even if I don't really agree with the store's practices, at least there were people there who genuinely cared."
parrots,3cl4ku,jacobsheep,2,Thu Jul 9 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"I work at a humane society in my area. We all always have cats, dogs, and rabbits, but we accept all surrenders. Unfortunately for the rats, turtles, birds, etc. That we do take, we arent very well equipped to care for them.   Usually we will get them in a rudimentary set up, and try to transfer them to a species specific rescue, if one is available.   About a month and change ago a very pretty lutino cockatiel was surrendered, and she got set up in a hamster cage that someone had donated. Being the only bird person at the shelter (SO and I have a 16yo cockatiel and 3yo GCC) I visited with her a lot, to figure out her temperment.   She (4yo, according to her intake form) knew step up, didn't bite, but was pretty overwhelmed about my attempts to pet her. She was desperately lonely though, and would start calling the second I left the room.   Boyfriend and I decided to add her to the flock after only a few days, and she was free because I'm an employee. Normally the 'tiel adoption fee is 15$.  We had an extra cage at home, because our birds are free range, and have both chosen to sleep in the same cage at night, leaving the other unused.   She is a pretty cool bird that has never been given people food & regards non seeds with extreme suspicion. I was working on it, when she suddenly started popping out eggs.  Sigh.   She has set up nest-camp in a tissue box under our kitchen table, so I moved her dishes down there, and I guess I'll see her in a few weeks when she is done being broody. She comes out for about 15 minutes a day to eat, drink, and look out the window, then goes back to her nest.   I'll take her to our bird vet once she's gotten this out of her aystem. No reason to put her through the stress of it right now."
parrots,3cl4ku,mewmewkitty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"Mickaboo Started off by filling out an application online. Then there was a phone interview and then a house-visit by one of the more knowledgable volunteers. The two visits covered a lot of the same questions, but they are known for being picky about who their birds get adopted to. I think it was somewhere around $150, but I don't remember now. Tango is a Meyer's Parrot. I worked with a husband-wife team of vets that saw parrots and other exotic critters. I've always loved the independence of the poicephalus group. The MP's seemed to be a bit more laid-back about new people and situations compared to Senegals. Tango had a vitamin deficiency when we got her due to her seed diet in her previous home. Her foster mom was able to switch her over to pellets without a problem, and she eats her pellets now with the same gusto that the black lab does. Tango runs our home. She's independent, demanding, declares war on the dogs occasionally, and is madly in love with my SO. Pois are really not the ideal parrots for first-time bird owners, but I knew what I was getting into when we adopted her. She has some behavior quirks that will probably never go away and we think they are tied to her past life, but she's amiable for the most part."

My elder bird had no prior bird socialization and baby seems to have no boundaries. I've been told by vets and the breeder that squabbles are normal. I think of it as negotiating rank and social boundaries.   They both bother each other at different times, but I only separate when it looks like it's not play fighting. And l honestly haven't heard squeaks that sound like pain or fear. Beaking beaks and mutual tonguing are normal. My older bird was beaking the other's feet at first, but never really biting.   Both also bond with me. And go off on their own. For me, seeing no aggression during eating or shared cage time was a good sign. They are social animals with personalities and social structures, so ""negotiations"" are normal."

parrots,3ciqs3,Phallenpheather,5,Wed Jul 8 13:01:16 2015 UTC,Card is here!  It's not as good as I'd like it to be but I'm still proud! The dots are his feet and the long streak is his tail :)
parrots,3ciqs3,Senbone,3,Wed Jul 8 13:11:02 2015 UTC,Hahaha awww I love it!
parrots,3ciqs3,Wingnut00,2,Wed Jul 8 14:24:32 2015 UTC,Haha so cute!!! I love seeing pics of Charlie
parrots,3chlku,owliebowelie,2,Tue Jul 7 23:41:21 2015 UTC,Ahha makes me miss my little wet cheeseball .
parrots,3chlku,soggyfritter,2,Wed Jul 8 01:47:56 2015 UTC,Ahh I love watching birdies walk around in water up to their trousers! So cute!
parrots,3cjs7q,Chive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:36:10 2015 UTC,"He's a very intelligent bird but also can be destructive. When he puts his mind to taking something apart he generally succeeds. I've bought him toys that I figured should last and he has them apart before he goes to bed.  So I'm wondering how best to keep him stimulated on a budget.  Alternatively I'd prefer not to pay a fortune for wood, rope and chains and wait 2-3 weeks for them to arrive if I don't have to, but I'd like to do it properly so there would be no chance of injury to his health."
parrots,3cjs7q,mrprogrammer72,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:43:20 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest looking into building him a play gym and some foraging toys. The foraging toys are nice, they can keep my guy busy for hours."
parrots,3cjs7q,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:23:11 2015 UTC,"I have a play gym and foraging toys, but he has destroyed most of the foraging toys, so I was wondering what materials I should be using to make new ones to replace them. I have a reasonably equipped workshop so the actual manufacture of them is not an issue, it's more whether certain woods might be better than others.  In that respect I won't be using treated wood because of the chemicals, and I'm avoiding pine because of the resin. I have a load of untreated birch and cedar that I was wondering whether it would be suitable for the purpose."
parrots,3cjs7q,budgiefacedkiller,2,Wed Jul 8 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"Referencing the safe/unsafe wood lists that I have on hand I see that birch is safe but cedar is not. More specifically:   Cedar Is Usually Listed As A ""Safe Wood"" And The Wood Is Said To Be Safe For Perches. However, Cedar Shavings May Contain Compounds That Can Cause Respiratory Problems And Other Serious Health Problems In Birds (same with rodents, etc). If Cedar Is To Be Used, Red Cedar Should Be Avoided. Yellow And Sitka Cedar May Be Safe (But Not Confirmed)..   Considering your bird will be effectively turning this wood into wood shavings, if you do not know what exact species you have you shouldn't risk it.   Pine seems to be in the same boat as cedar (i.e. it's okay for perches but probably not the best for chewing) unless you have Norfolk pine (which is completely safe)."
parrots,3cjs7q,budgiefacedkiller,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:48:06 2015 UTC,That's great information. Thank you.  Is that list online anywhere?
parrots,3cjs7q,chugach3dguy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:52:59 2015 UTC,This is the main list I use.  And then I saw that they mentioned only certain species of cedar were toxic so I investigated google and found this article.
parrots,3cjs7q,chugach3dguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. That's appreciated.  Edit: That's an excellent list. I'd have never thought of asparagus as a food they shouldn't have. I haven't been feeding my birds asparagus, but I do generally give them off-cuts from when I'm preparing vegetables and I do occasionally cook asparagus, and might well have given it to them assuming it was safe."
parrots,3cjs7q,chugach3dguy,3,Wed Jul 8 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"Funny that you mention the whole asparagus thing. I only recently had a whole fact checking session with a friend of mine when the topic came up (I've fed it in the past too).   Asparagus contains a compound called asparagin which can cause digestive upset in some birds. For the rest it is safe and can be recommended in moderation as it is very nutritious.  Many people unfortunately clump together things such as asparagus, which may be hard for some birds to digest, with foods that are actually TOXIC such as chocolate and avocado (as well as others).  IMO those who wish to ""play it safe"" and put everything questionable on the toxic list in some ways reduce the credibility of that list. If one is to say asparagus is bad and chocolate is bad we don't want those who feed plenty of asparagus to suddenly think ""well, she seems to handle asparagus just fine, maybe they're wrong about chocolate too.""  So, asparagus - not truly toxic and not a danger to their lives like some foods. But not all birdie tummies will handle it very well.  For more examples of ""debatable"" foods that are often thrown onto the never-feed-or-risk-death lists see here.  Overall, it's worth being cautious but also worth taking the claims of such master food/wood/plant lists with a grain of salt. Usually I research a food or plant thoroughly before feeding it, rather than trust a single list with no explanation or scientific evidence to back them up. The lists are best used as jumping off points and quick references if you are unsure of something. If you don't have the time to look into something, better safe than sorry."

parrots,3chpc9,jermtheherm,6,Wed Jul 8 00:11:47 2015 UTC,Cap the pictures and forward to animal control or the humane society. I always personally worry when people say they're moving and can't take their bird. Tons of birds around here get left in places and starve.
parrots,3chpc9,budgiebum,5,Wed Jul 8 00:22:40 2015 UTC,In the process of doing just that.
parrots,3chpc9,budgiebum,3,Wed Jul 8 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I hope this grey can be taken care of. $1200 is a high price for my pocket, but a breeder might try to haggle it down and take him"
parrots,3chpc9,littlebirb,6,Wed Jul 8 00:30:12 2015 UTC,"Sent an email with pictures and link to ad.  If no response by noon tomorrow I will call.  If no response to the call, I will call someone else!"
parrots,3chpc9,slowlauris,6,Wed Jul 8 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"I'm from the Pittsburgh area, I'd get him if I was in the position to take in another bird. I hope that your efforts in getting him help are successful! <3 Please keep us updated on what happens."
parrots,3chpc9,wingedmurasaki,4,Wed Jul 8 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"So, I received a reply to my email to Pittsburgh Animal Care & Control and they notified me that they would forward the information to cruelty investigations at Animal Friends animal shelter.  Hopefully it pans out with the bird being confiscated, and not those people being paid $1200 for that animal."
parrots,3chpc9,wingedmurasaki,3,Wed Jul 8 17:22:15 2015 UTC,"I live in PGH, did you try calling the pittsburgh parrot rescue?   they may need to work with animal friends for the longterm. I'm almost positive they don't rehome birds at animal friends.  also the national aviary( on the northside) might have a foster or adopting network as well."
parrots,3chpc9,chlorineTardis,4,Wed Jul 8 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"My gf is an intern at the National Aviary, I will have her talk to someone there when she goes in tomorrow."
parrots,3chpc9,Magentaluv,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that's horrible.  Though I'm not sure the significance of the water dish comment - is it bad to place bowls/plates at the bottom of a cage? I found my grey much prefers to forage her food off a flat surface so her food plate is at the bottom of her cage.  Though it is true that the metal bowls that come with the cage don't have enough weight to them to rest flat without being pushed around (I use a heavy ceramic plate for Gabbie's food)"
parrots,3chpc9,Blahblah0069,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:02:46 2015 UTC,"That specific bottom of the cage has poop piled so high that its coming through the grate at the bottom so in this case, its a little gross"
parrots,3chpc9,Blahblah0069,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, of course. I was focused on how empty the cage was."

parrots,3cgutv,oneona,7,Tue Jul 7 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"Geez, I could hardly take all the cuteness going on in this video! The birdies are beautiful and are so well-behaved, even the doggies were good, and the parronts seem very loving and dedicated but what really got me was the little cockatiel, mom says ""He likes to sing with a Kleenex on top of his head..."""
parrots,3cgutv,itimedout,5,Tue Jul 7 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"If you haven't done so, check out her other videos, very cute birds she has."
parrots,3cgutv,CockGobblin,2,Wed Jul 8 02:58:00 2015 UTC,She is really a pro.
parrots,3cgutv,BabyCat6,4,Sat Jul 11 05:14:33 2015 UTC,This left me seriously wishing for a ringneck. Everything about that little bird is so amazingly precious.
parrots,3cgutv,Ephemeral_Halcyon,3,Wed Jul 8 05:09:17 2015 UTC,Is that what type Marnie is?
parrots,3cgutv,Linux_Man85,3,Fri Jul 10 05:44:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, she looks like an Indian Ringneck parrot to me."
parrots,3cgutv,Ephemeral_Halcyon,3,Fri Jul 10 05:46:03 2015 UTC,Oo that's cool! I love how Marnie talks so much
parrots,3cgutv,Linux_Man85,2,Fri Jul 10 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"I love the little voice. Haha. It's got that super sweet tone where it's not ear piercing, and it's not just screaming."
parrots,3cgutv,Ephemeral_Halcyon,2,Fri Jul 10 05:53:02 2015 UTC,How common is it for them to talk. I have a cockatiel so I dont know much other than her specifics
parrots,3cgutv,Linux_Man85,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:57:04 2015 UTC,What a cute bird
parrots,3cfq66,cosmic_kat,20,Tue Jul 7 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"He likely was freaked out the first night and that's why initially he was so cuddly.   Does he cluck when you go close? In my experience that's actually a sort of sign of interest, but it could mean a lot.  CAG's are INSANELY territorial of their cages. Clearly he's already marked that his own. Getting him to step up on your hand from his cage probably isn't going to happen. Mine will step up for me, but if anyone else does he lunge attacks them; and from what I've read, this is pretty normal for non-socialized CAGs.  Honestly if you want the bird to be comfortable, just leave him be until you can find his rightful owner. He's in a strange place after leaving what was likely a very comfortable home, the less stress you can induce the better. What I would be more worried about is if he's eating/the color of his droppings."
parrots,3cfq66,mrprogrammer72,4,Tue Jul 7 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. He doesn't really cluck when I get close but he does make a clicking sound with his beak and tongue quite often.  He is eating, I bought him some parrot food (a bag of all kinds of seeds) and I also fed him some fruits - apples, pineapple and orange. His droppings are white and green-ish - is that normal?"
parrots,3cfq66,askolsunburcu,8,Tue Jul 7 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"Give him broccoli, squash, cucumbers, carrots, peppers, kale - basically anything rich with Vitamin A, daily. Do not under any circumstances give him avocado!"
parrots,3cfq66,mrprogrammer72,5,Tue Jul 7 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"haha, he's probably in heaven with the seeds. just make sure he's getting some fruit, seeds are generally bad for parrots but given the situation I wouldn't worry too much about it. mine LOVES broccoli."
parrots,3cfq66,Barefoot_Hippie,3,Tue Jul 7 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"Does he sound like this? If so that means he's frightened. Also, the beak clicking/grinding could be a warning that something is scaring him/her. It's usually a signal that the next thing he's going to do it bite."
parrots,3cfq66,Barefoot_Hippie,2,Tue Jul 7 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"He doesn't sound like that, a higher pitch than the one in the video, but I don't really know how to describe it."
parrots,3cfq66,sarautu,3,Tue Jul 7 18:27:48 2015 UTC,Here's another distress sound. Your guy could just be making a sound he learned too.
parrots,3cfq66,Snarknado2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"yes, white and greenish is normal."
parrots,3cfq66,nerdybirdie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"Be careful with the apples. The fruit is fine, but the seeds are poisonous. White and green droppings are normal. Good on you for taking care of this bird. Its owner is probably going crazy."
parrots,3cfq66,nerdybirdie,14,Wed Jul 8 16:34:08 2015 UTC,"Aww, poor guy. First, report the finding to Parrot Alert and 911 Parrot Alert. Then check with any avian vets in the area or even pet stores, since they may have reported their missing bird there.  Where do you live? I know of a lost CAG near my hometown."
parrots,3cfq66,nerdybirdie,7,Tue Jul 7 16:51:03 2015 UTC,I can check with local vets - but there are no avian vets here as far as I know. I live in South Africa.
parrots,3cfq66,KHanau,8,Tue Jul 7 17:08:50 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. I'm not sure what resources are available in other parts of the world, but I still think that exotic bird stores and the websites I linked are a good start.  As for making the bird comfortable, keep an eye on his body language if you decide to approach. Slicked down feathers, wide open eyes (especially if they show red) and lowered body posture can signify fear or stress. He might just want to be left alone. Partially closed eyes and fluffed feathers point to comfort and calmness. He might enjoy your company but not want to be touched.  Looks like you're feeding him seeds and fruit. Those are okay for the short term, but he'll need more if you have him for very long. Pellets usually hit most of the bases of a base diet, but if you don't want to buy those, you could offer him eggs, parrot-safe veggies, beans, etc."
parrots,3cfq66,AlexEvangelou,7,Tue Jul 7 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will post on those websites and visit some pet stores in my area. The only thing I'm kinda nervous about is that people will claim they lost a parrot, but really they just want to sell it.  Some stuff I noticed so far: sometimes when I enter the room he opens one wing and one leg; he will sit on the cage and spread and flap his wings like he's about to fly; he sometimes sits on one leg. Those are some odd stuff that I noticed - or odd to me, I don't really know much about birds body language.  Will have a look for pellets. As for safe veggies, is this list of safe foods good?"
parrots,3cfq66,vaqari,11,Tue Jul 7 18:10:53 2015 UTC,"when I enter the room he opens one wing and one leg   That's him stretching. It means he's happy to see you!   he will sit on the cage and spread and flap his wings like he's about to fly   This is normal unless it seems panicked and he pants afterwards.   he sometimes sits on one leg   Also normal. This means he is comfortable and at ease.  That looks like an excellent list of food. You're doing a great job. If someone tries to claim him as their bird, you could watch his body language to see if he recognizes them as his owner. If he seems excited to see them then it's a good chance that's the real owner. If you hear the bird make any identifiable noises or says any words, you could use that as a way to identify the actual owner."
parrots,3cfq66,budgiefacedkiller,8,Tue Jul 7 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this helps a lot! :)"
parrots,3cfq66,Tenaciousgreen,5,Tue Jul 7 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"Ask anyone who responds for identifying features, behavior and/or preferred treats and food."
parrots,3cfq66,marshmallowskies,7,Tue Jul 7 18:13:25 2015 UTC,Have you called your local animal rescue resources? If someone lost him I'm sure they'd be calling around. Do you have any avian vets in the area? You should take him there and see if they know him.
parrots,3cfq66,Barefoot_Hippie,5,Tue Jul 7 15:55:55 2015 UTC,Parrots can get quite a ways from home.  I'd call around in at least a 15-30 mile radius.  You can also post on craigslist or similar sites.  You might also have a local parrot facebook group.
parrots,3cfq66,marshmallowskies,4,Tue Jul 7 16:33:46 2015 UTC,No avian vets here (or none that I could find). But I will try phoning some animal rescue organisations.
parrots,3cfq66,MsOrangeCake,3,Tue Jul 7 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"Try the rescue organizations and in particular any bird sanctuaries that might be in the area. Additionally, look for places that might be willing to take in a homeless parrot if you aren't able to fine his owner. Considering you never signed up for the colossal undertaking that is a Grey, it may be best to get him into the hands of some professionals that can see to his proper diet, socialization, and housing."
parrots,3cfq66,Snarknado2,5,Tue Jul 7 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"I'm on my phone so I'm not sure if this has been mentioned, but he/she is a Timneh African Grey (as opposed to a Congo AG, the other larger common species).  This will be important when finding his owner, I'd keep his picture and species undisclosed so you can make sure they are the right people."
parrots,3cfq66,Audreyu,4,Tue Jul 7 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"Find the owner! They are probably missing their bird to death.  Those birds can quickly become hostile if they're afraid because they're so dang smart.  If you are considering keeping it, I'd think twice.  Getting a cage appropriately sized and a diet appropriately fitted to that bird, in combination with the amount of care and attention they take, makes this basically like adopting a child.  Not to mention that since this one flew into your house, it's clearly someone else's pet. Grey Parrots that start to miss their old owner are something else.  They scream and attack and almost always self mutilate, plucking out feathers and even quit eating.  This is deadly for them.  A rescue grey is something that takes years of prior bird ownership and self-education to appropriately handle. A lot of the time the bird ends up spending the rest of its life alone in a cage.  I don't want to assume you aren't capable of this, or even that you're wanting to keep the bird.  I just want to say it all because it's important to me to make sure you know the importance of your actions from here on out with this bird.  I feel like if I found a grey this way I'd freak out so bad.... It'd be like finding a BABY on my doorstep!  Either way, thank you for finding and caring for the bird.   I bet that it's owner is out there having a total anxiety attack looking for their baby.  If you haven't, try putting up some flyers. If the bird is banded, ask anyone who is looking for their bird what the band number is or what sounds it makes to be sure you get the right person. That bird is worth a lot of money and not everyone is as scrupulous as you are! :)  As for helping the bird in the mean time: Try to keep its cage in a well lit room and feed it PELLETS! those guys need a diet beyond seeds.  Don't ever cook with Teflon while you have the bird.  If you burn the pan, the fumes will make the birds lungs bleed internally and it will drown in its own blood. :( I'd try to just be friendly and give treats through the cage without sticking my hand in the cage or opening the door.  Also, try covering his cage at night to make him feel more secure.  Treats are good too! Try something starchy like potato or rice.  Just try to avoid salts and sugars.  Sing songs and tell him stories.  Give him toys! They love toys.    Edit: just reread your post and I missed the part about you definitely not wanting to keep the bird.  Sorry, ignore all that in the beginning! :)"
parrots,3cfq66,mitch_rezman,7,Tue Jul 7 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I will keep on looking for the owner, but if I don't find them soon I was thinking of perhaps donating him to a bird sanctuary. I haven't put flyers out yet because I am kind of nervous about someone claiming him only to sell him (he doesn't have a band) - but I think I will need to do that.  I don't have too many toys/bird toys, but I'm trying to give him random stuff to keep him occupied (like corks, newspaper, plastic bottle caps). Here he is!."
parrots,3cfq66,sbhikes,6,Tue Jul 7 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, looks like he just made himself right at home! He doesn't appear to be distressed in any of those pictures. The sanctuary is a good idea, they may have better resources for finding his owner."
parrots,3cfq66,mitch_rezman,3,Tue Jul 7 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yay! Looks happy.  On his/her behalf, and his owners, thank you.  You are awesome for helping so much and making such an effort to learn all you can.  THANK YOU!"
parrots,3cfq66,beyouorfuckyou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:37:11 2015 UTC,Awwwww he/she looks so happy :)
parrots,3cfq66,sarautu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:43:28 2015 UTC,Looks like he's pretty happy with the setup you've made for him. Nice work. Careful with your computer. My Grey has destroyed several keyboards and a monitor.
