I do need the armor / weapon parts so I do want to pick them up to dismantle them..."
DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,Scribe89,13,Tue Jul 21 12:19:52 2015 UTC,Yes. Many games have this option of automatically dismantling/breaking down items of a specific rarity(of which you can pick) for materials/currency.  It should definitely be a feature in Destiny.

Then again, they implemented a bunch of UI and QoL improvements sometime before Warlords released.

DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,westen81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:02 2015 UTC,I did a google search out of curiosity (my friends call me Whiskers because I'm curious like a cat) and didn't find any auto-disenchant option apart from an addon.  I did find this though which is pretty cool. Looks like you can disenchant stuff without being an enchanter or having to pay some random dude in a city to do it for you (and that butthole might run off with your mats).  I like that a lot.  Maybe that is what you were thinking of?
DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,ZEBRAKAKEZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:37 2015 UTC,"Can't access YT at work...but if it's showing the ""Disenchant"" option on loot rolls, that only works if there is an enchanter in the dungeon/raid/etc. etc. party. I remember at one point in time having an auto-disenchant setting in the settings menu. Could have been one of the PTR though. (I participated in MoP and WoD beta)."
DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,westen81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"IIRC you can select disenchant during the Need/Greed/Pass rolls and, if won , the item will automatically be disenchanted and put into your inventory.

DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,KnightOfTheGoddess,4,Tue Jul 21 16:12:29 2015 UTC,"Bungie has implemented that into Destiny.  WoW = $13/month (for 6 months), $156 annually  Destiny = $60 base game + $20 TDB + $20 HoW = $120/year, or $10/month  WoW is $3 a month more expensive than Destiny. But it seems like we get much, much less than a WoW subscriber gets, including:   Auto-dismantling (topic of this thread) A variety of PvP game modes including Capture the Flag, large-team battles, and arena mode Vastly better gear balancing Hosted servers (so no host-based exploits) Raid bosses that typically cannot be cheesed (Destiny's track record is 0/2 for uncheesable raid bosses)   ...and more.  Personally, I love Bungie. I played Halo since the beginning, but hated what 343 did to it. I would gladly pay $15/month for a GOOD game. But Bungie has already been charging me $10/month for a SHIT product, full of glitches on every level (in the physics engine, in the game logic, in the boss encounters, in the PvP matchmaking, in the host code...) and without key features like LFG that are standard for MMOs at this point.  And they're gearing up to start this again in the fall with Taken King. That's not even going into when ""Destiny 2"" comes out and we need to buy the game AGAIN.  Don't pretend that you're not playing an MMO with a subscription when you play destiny. If you want to pretend you aren't, delete both DLCs and see how much content you can access."

DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,PatricianCat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, personally I enjoy getting blues and going to decrypt them.

DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,Jawn_Valjorts,3,Tue Jul 21 18:52:31 2015 UTC,Green engrams are my number one source of weapon parts because I make sure to experience them before dismantling. 3-4 parts for a green is well worth the bounty XP.  Auto-dismantle would prevent me from doing that.

There are two additional columns of nodes when leveling a green. In my experience, dismantling a non-leveled green weapon gives 1-2 weapon parts, a green leveled halfway gives 2-3, and a fully leveled green gives 3-4. One green in each weapon slot, one 5000xp bounty turn-in, and ~150 glimmer per weapon gives you 9-12 weapon parts versus 3-6.  Works great."

I'm don't even think they contribute to the Reputation Rank.  I hate that if my inventory is full then the consumable is lost forever just like the Green Engrams.  Lord Saladbar only knows what kind of consumables TTK will add to the game."
DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,aBryant_86,0,Tue Jul 21 17:22:02 2015 UTC,A way they could make that work is that if you try to use the consumables yourself you could get either glimmer or nothing (or lower glimmer amounts or something) That way you could either stock up on them and trade them in at the tower or take the gamble for glimmer.
DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,eburton555,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"Well i hate it when i'm capped at 25k, i'd rather the way it is now tbh. You can choose when you get glimmer so it's a lot better."
DestinyTheGame,3e26nz,Amnsia,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:03 2015 UTC,Dismantle green engrams automatically for materials when our inventory is full. Just walk over it.   But... what if I want to see if that green contains a Xerxes-C with Focus Fire?   I wish we can toggle such an option   Oh. OK then. Fair idea. :)

DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,vote4mclovin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"Just a note, some browsers seem to cache data for it weirdly and make it not update the way it should. Using CTRL+Shift+R hard refreshes the page if you notice this happening."
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,brucethehoon,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:56 2015 UTC,This right here is the best way to refresh until i put up a button. Thanks!
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,Mintmojitolover,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:54 2015 UTC,I noticed it takes somewhere from 30 sec to 1+ min. It really depends on how quick bungie updates the data on their end.  You can try and test it on your character and see how long it takes. I usually refresh after every round and most of the time it's quick enough
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,TotalHavok,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"ahh ok good.  As long as its somewhat current, that was my only concern was that teams may change strats between games and you wouldn't know what guns they equip."

It would be good if you projected how many of each super were liable to see in a 5, 10, and 15 minute match, bonus points if you can factor in whether they're a use it or lose it player or a hoarder"
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,MyBeerBelly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"As a developer, I consider myself to be relatively inexperienced, so I'm sure I won't have much to offer. I'll look through this code base when I have a chance; it looks like a learning opportunity.  I'm fairly well-versed in ExtJS, so of course my mind immediately leaps in that direction. Every problem resembles a nail when all you have is a hammer. But as long as Bungie offers an HTTP API, ExtJS's data stores and UI-building would probably go a long way."

DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,IwanJones10,5,Tue Jul 21 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"I've been using this resource since it was first posted last week. It's quite useful! I do recommend caution, though, because sometimes the people it shows on the fireteam are slightly different from the actual team you're up against (if they just assembled a new fireteam). Always be sure to double-check!"
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,mmurray2k7,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:01 2015 UTC,Yeah we noticed this to. Sometimes it will be slightly off.
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,Kaphis,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:32 2015 UTC,I was telling everyone I played with about it this weekend.  Super helpful to have everything in front of you at once and could look at throughout the match.  Only a few hiccups that I'm not sure are preventable.  If it was a newly formed team that hadn't played a match before then the teammates weren't an option to choose.  And then if they changed weapons during the match then they obviously weren't indicated on the site.  But by far the most helpful info was just their class setup and then their k/d and win %.
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,Chop_Hard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"thanks for spreading the word!  Unfortunately, in cases where the team never played together, you would have to manually input the names. Luckily this isnt as common as playing a team with match history together.  As much as id love to add an auto refresh feature for the weapons I am trying to limit api calls to bungie. You can however refresh the page at any time to see if their loadout has been changed"

My site is more focused on giving a report and less on the individual loadout.  http://www.destinytrialsreport.net
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,Optimus_Prime_10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"I like this. I would like to point out something though that I noticed...  On your account, when you hover over the user's emblem and it gives the ""Trials of Osiris KD Ratio / Account KD Ratio"", it displays them backwards. I have a .99 KDR in trials and a 1.05 account KDR, but it displays on the emblem as ""1.05 / .99""  Also, when I hover over my account to get the stat popup, it is displaying the information for the incorrect account."
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,livingtorture,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  That should mean that the character you are seeing has a higher k/d than your overall account (ie. you are running a main).  As for the tooltip, which one are you hovering over? :)  Thanks for the feedback"
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,Optimus_Prime_10,4,Tue Jul 21 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Well in the case of me, (PSN:Chop_Hard), technically my Titan is my main, it is my oldest toon with the most hours. My most recent toon ran was my hunter. It shows the emblem and stats for my hunter, but upon hovering over, it shows my titan info.  For the tooltip, I am hovering over the emblem, but not the character name. It is quite nit-picky but it confused me at first. The emblem displays 1.05 / .99  which is my acct kd / trials kd for that specific toon. I did not know this initially, so I hovered over the emblem (not the account name) to display the tiny tool tip. It told me that it was Trials KD / Account KD which is backwards from what it actually displays.  Is that a better description?"
DestinyTheGame,3e2rne,livingtorture,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"Oh hmm! Thanks for this, I am going to take a look at this right now. Not a lot of people know their KD by heart or have them so similar that they don't bat an eye (myself included). Let me see what's going on here. Thank you for providing your gamertag!   I checked bungie.net right now and I think I know what the confusion is.   The tooltip should say ""Trials Character KD Ratio / Trials Account KD Ratio"".  The numbers are correct but the tooltip is confusing. The 1.05 is your hunter's trials K/D and the .99 is the trials K/D across all characters.  I will change the tool tip now."

If they're on a roll, then sit back and put on your try-hard pants. If they've lost 20% of 100 games, we can be more confident in our ability to rush and flank. It definitely helps with piece of mind, but there are times when it's intimidating for sure."

DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,cartman_1982,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:20 2015 UTC,What is wrong with this? I am not familiar with the argument that made it okay to take trading out of the game.
DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,extinguisher17,0,Tue Jul 21 04:28:48 2015 UTC,It was never in game and if it got put in game it would likely ruin it.  People would charge for real money for in game items.
DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,cartman_1982,3,Tue Jul 21 09:21:02 2015 UTC,So you mean exactly what is happening with Trials of Osiris? It would just have to follow the same formula of charging money for weapons resulting in a ban.
DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,tadillac_psn,5,Tue Jul 21 11:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah - those bans are working out great...  It just doesn't need to be there.  Regardless of whether it is officially against the rules or not, people will find a way around it (If you were ever a fan of Diablo 2, I'm sure you remember d2legit.com LOL).  And when people circumvent rules to bypass game mechanics, games get shit on.  When games get shit on, they stop getting real support, and it is a slippery slope from there.  Trading is unnecessary.  Just play the game.  In all honesty, once you don't have the carrot to chase anymore, some of the game loses its appeal.  This is true of all loot-based games."
DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,p2pirate,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"I'll do my favorite argument, the ""Augustus Gloop and the Chocolate River"" defense.  Remember Game Genie? Remember how fun your favorite game was for like 30 minutes? In the summer of 1990 I alone inflated the earnings of the local family video stores on my quest to become insta-god in every NES game, to the point that they became Too Big To Fail. Ultimately, as my interest in everything waned, the moms and pops couldn't sustain the overstocked inventory left in the wake of the fatigue sustained from wielding unlimited power, and they gave way to the big box chains with their unforgiving late fees and missing game manuals.  You come for the gunplay, you stay for the slot machine loot system, you remain here for eternity for the PTSD group therapy disguised as camaraderie and community."
DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,Tigerbones,4,Tue Jul 21 17:09:48 2015 UTC,Did you just akin trading to cheating?  I dont think anyone here against trading has ever played a single online game with a trading economy. Your perception of what occurs when people are allowed to exchange goods is so warped it can only be conjured up through a fantasy in ones mind of what they THINK would happen.

Step 4: Lose interest in the game. GG.  This pretty much sums it all up. Imagine how stupidly easy would be obtaining that Vex Mythoclast or even that cool Proxima Centauri II with the perfect roll.

DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,MuchStache,5,Tue Jul 21 12:42:38 2015 UTC,Started playing elder scrolls online this weekend and they do in game trading right because it's basically a guild market but there are also thousands of different things to obtain destiny doesn't have mmo type diversity it is more on the weak rpg side when it comes to gear and armor. Now if it went back to the old way (no reforging) but legendaries dropped all the time there may be some small way to do trading and maybe include factions in it.
DestinyTheGame,3e11c0,Renegade284,25,Tue Jul 21 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"But the point still remains, Destiny isn't MMO sized, and isn't an MMO.   Don't know in TESO, but usually it's crafting that adds value to equip in MMO. Entirely drop-based trading doesn't work usually and even less with Destiny variety. Not only that but the incentive to sell it's REALLY low.  Ideally it would be cool to be able to give that extra drop to your friends, but more realistically you would be just making them less enthusiast to get a drop because ""whatever, if you get it you can give it to me"".   That's what I think, at least."

At the very least, instead of being assigned drops, we should be able to roll on specific ones from within our fireteam for exotics and raid gear. I can understand that Bungie would do this to prevent squabbles between fireteams, but it's more fair than getting 2 Fatebringers after 2-manning Templar so your friend can get just one but ends up empty handed.

And make like a minimum requirements for each weapon.  Like trading someone for a Gally could include giving them a certain exotic plus some other stuff.  This is a very generalized idea but I just think trading should be allowed for the items that did not require some extensive objective in order to obtain the item."

For one thing, personally, I feel there was a little too much of the added affects. A few here and there can really add to the product, but if you ever want a montage to go bigger (say 50,000 views), you are going to be scrutinized really hard for that, because some people just dont like them. Also the fact that this was done in two months is sick, and you had some super good clips, but you also had a few clips that were kinda meh. A triple grenade isnt amazing, BUT THE TRIPLE COLLATERAL SURE FUCKING WAS ahaha. Sweet montage dude, and I hope you keep going, you definitely have some potential!"

DestinyTheGame,3e2o0t,Stridez_21,5,Tue Jul 21 14:24:42 2015 UTC,"Nice editing. You had some sweet transitions in there.  I don't have sound right now so I don't know how well everything lined up with the tunes, but (for me) the best part of a mutli-kill is watching the medals pop up on your screen. You cut them out of most of your kills, and the kill feed scrolls too fast to really count to see how many players you actually killed.  Overall, it was a great video and some great Destiny’ing!"
DestinyTheGame,3e2o0t,Jakaii,10,Tue Jul 21 14:47:42 2015 UTC,yeah i like that too but i assume youre talking about the part with the fists? that will make more sense with sound! let me know what you think after youve seen it with audio?
DestinyTheGame,3e2o0t,blackelvis,17,Tue Jul 21 14:51:03 2015 UTC,I figure it was in sync with the audio which is why they were cut out. I do hate how long they take to pop up. I kind of wish the game would wait until the last kill is achieved and then show just the final medal (but still reward you for the others). I don't remember medals taking so long to show up in the Halo games. I feel like the higher ones faded the lower ones out almost instantly if they were in the way.
DestinyTheGame,3e2o0t,mjconns,5,Tue Jul 21 15:21:33 2015 UTC,"things like streak medals ruin clips like that, its tricky to edit with because you dont want like 5 seconds tacked on to a clip it upsets the flow but i agree with ya"

DestinyTheGame,3e16tm,nopunchespulled,5,Tue Jul 21 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting that they get the Alpha Lupi one slightly wrong. Alpha Lupi is actually the name of the star, within the constellation Lupus. And Light Beyond Nemesis isn't necessarily the same reference."
DestinyTheGame,3e16tm,CookiesFTA,3,Tue Jul 21 05:35:35 2015 UTC,"The reasoning I saw further down is that the Light Beyond Nemesis is the Alpha Lupi of the Warlocks or something?  Edit: From the OP of that post   Yes. The reference is in the perks, not the name.    EDIT: See here. LBN is the Warlock version of the Alpha Lupi trio and the perk, ""Keeper of the Pack"" is identically named with the exact same function."
DestinyTheGame,3e16tm,Skreamie,4,Tue Jul 21 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"Still wrong though. LBN is for pulling a soul back from the light beyond, at the end of the tunnel, when you revive somebody.  Also, Alpha Lupi also means Aloha Wolf, or pack leader, or leader of the pack. This more likely a reference to giving up better exotic perks in favor of teamwork, reminiscent of the way a pack of wolves works together.   Alpha Lupi also appears in the grimoire cards and seems to be connected to the traveler, or may be the traveler.  To take it all further, if the traveler is Alpha Lupi it comes from there, it's interesting that the traveler's dying act was to raise an army of space zombie wizard cowboy Spartans, essentially tearing them from the light beyond."

DestinyTheGame,3e16tm,WifeOfOryx,4,Tue Jul 21 07:15:21 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that restraining orders aren't actively monitored. Who has the manpower for that? It's basically just a way to give the holder an avenue for legal recourse against a person who is harassing them but not necessarily doing anything criminal per se, as well as to put that person on notice that they better knock their shit off and they can't use ""but it's not illegal"" as a defense.   It's like the government threatening to turn this damn car around half way to Disneyland because ""I'm not touching you"" 😝  That's 100% speculation though."
DestinyTheGame,3e16tm,WifeOfOryx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:01 2015 UTC,It's also used as a workaround to disarm someone.  In many jurisdictions you can't buy guns if you've had  a RO.

DestinyTheGame,3e16tm,Rash_Octillery,9,Tue Jul 21 06:39:36 2015 UTC,"Probably chosen as feet to correlate to the unusually long range at which some ""high impact"" rifles can be used IRL.

DestinyTheGame,3e16tm,GeneralBattuta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"This one's actually a Marathon reference/easter egg, and one of several (yes, I've been here since 1994). MIDA was a Martian organization in Marathon's backstory, and they were the ones responsible for hiding weapons all over the colony ship Marathon in preparation for an insurrection that never occurred. Turns out well for the player's character when he ends up having to defend that ship once it reaches its destination and said weapons caches become solid gold. You might say MIDA saved the Marathon indirectly.  Marathon, if you don't know, was Bungie's fifth game and first major commercial success.  Other Marathon references:   The description of Super Pox VLO (reference to a Marathon Infinity computer terminal) The Outrageous Fortune ship (reference to a Marathon 2 level, itself a Hamlet reference) The Fate of All Fools' name (reference to Marathon 2's story when one of the main characters defeats the other) The fusion rifle weapon class is a direct nod to the overcharge mode of Marathon's fusion pistol The (currently unobtainable) Manus Celer Dei ship is the name of a ship in Marathon's story The Low Flying Defense Drones patrol mission bears the same name as a level in the original Marathon"

DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,ManceRaman,3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"It address two of the biggest issues in this game.  1.) lack of variety in end game play. At a certain point those strikes aren't worth the time it takes to blast through on a sparrow and blow things up using G-Horn. For most of us there's really just two raids, nightfall, weekly and PoE as endgame options. Three of those things stay the same every week with random chance of rewards being the biggest cause of tension/excitement (will I finally get my Vex Mythoclast?!?!). Some weeks the nightfall is fun, especially burn weeks, but again random rewards tend to be the most exciting part of it.  2.) progression towards a defined reward. The exotic bounties were a cool idea. I like having a do this/get that structure in the game (especially since EVERYTHING else is RNG) but there are only a handful of exotic bounties and I've completed each at least once. What if getting a G-Horn was a straight forward as completing 10 strikes in a row with the same fire team, three random modifiers, no going to orbit? At the end everyone gets a G-Horn. Maybe then everyone would have one and some of the prestige would be gone, but we'd have fewer butt-hurt (not a dig in any of you, it's not your fault you don't have one, and your anguish is justified) guardians with 1000's of hours into a game running around complaining about not having one."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,lifelongcargo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"Problem is two fold for your 2nd part.  1) 10 strikes in a row is a serious time investment and would be very difficult to keep all 3 members of your fireteam around for it and if you get the crap modifiers at the end you may just give up on the game in frustration (think Omnigul with Lightswitch, Arc Burn, and Grounded).  2) If you offered a way to get a G-Horn, you would see LFG posts lighting up with people asking to be carried through cause they really want one. Eventually everyone has the big shiny carrot at the end and then they have nothing left to hope to obtain until TTK."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,Giventofly08,5,Tue Jul 21 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"Points well-made.  I think the details may have some issues but the sentiments make sense. I would like more ""do this -> get that"" tasks. Even if those tasks required a lot of time investment being able to earn a particular item is what I'm asking for.   I guess the heart of my request is just for more of those exotic bounties... but more quest-like. Tell a story, make it tough enough that I'm choosing to go and earn the item I want.   Who cares if there's a bunch of LFG posts for G-Horn runs... there have been tons of posts for Pocket Infinity bounties (100 fusion rifle kills in Nightfall)."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,lifelongcargo,4,Tue Jul 21 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think some of the best quests they had were the exotic bounty ones that morphed throughout with different requirements."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,Giventofly08,3,Tue Jul 21 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"The fact is that PoE is not really that random, there are stabilished presets and The Revenge of Skolas (lvl 35) is always the same except for Skolas himself.  To me that is a missed opportunity, because IMO it would be pretty fun, even if extremely hard and unfair, have truly random modifiers and arenas going in."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,bebepalmito,6,Tue Jul 21 18:36:18 2015 UTC,Too good of an idea. Bungie please nerf
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,Atheonsend,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:34 2015 UTC,Matchmaking would be a pain. Everyone would leave the group it doesn't get a burn.
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,hallslys,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:14 2015 UTC,so add penalties if people leave like pretty much every multiplayer game ever...or don't have the burns as options.
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,BiNiaRiS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:21 2015 UTC,Which multiplayer games penalize the user if they leave?
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,The_Rick_14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, it seems to be mainly a PC thing. Counter strike, Dota, Heroes of the Storm, LoL. But even Smash Bros has it.  In any matchmaking activity, there should be incentive to stay. Ever done strikes and everyone leaves when Omnigul pops?  This is even more important in PvP. And it doesn't need to be too harsh. First time you quit, 15min delay until you can matchmake again. You can still do anything else, just not matchmake. Do it again within a 12 hour period? Now it's an hour timeout, etc."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,BiNiaRiS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"The ""incentive"" to stay is you get rewards at the end.  Leaving forgoes the rewards.  What your asking for is a penalty to people who leave the strike before it's finished, and to that I say that a game with such poor servers and constant disconnects due to multiple reasons does not need a penalty system in place, as too many people would get penalized for getting disconnected."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,deadpool848,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:18 2015 UTC,The penalty is for manually leaving. And rewards are not a good enough incentive. I don't wanna do omnigul? So I leave and make it harder for my teammates cause half the time it doesn't refill that spot. And its quicker for me to just requeue.  So they let you reconnect if you get disconnected. Most games have a period of time that let's you do that. And even if shit really hits the fan and you can't reconnect its a 15min temp ban. Not an issues.  I've been kicked a fair amount of times but I've got 800 hours played. Its happened maybe 10 times.
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,BiNiaRiS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"Not everyone is as fortunate as you in terms of disconnects.  And penalizing people for disconnecting is bad practice when you can't even fix the issues with the servers to begin with.  If someone leaves cause they don't want to do the strike, then you can also leave and re-queue as well.  If anything they need to make a better system of filling empty spots if someone ends up leaving at the start or 1/2 way through.  There have been many occasions where the Strike takes 30 minutes but the game simply can't put a person into it to fill the spot.  Same goes for Crucible matches that sometimes even start as 5v6 because the game can't find the last person and force starts the patch, and then never fills that empty spot.  Long story short, before implementing a penalty for leaving an activity, they should fix their matchmaking first."
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,deadpool848,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:30 2015 UTC,I think I am the vast majority. I haven't seen a thread on disconnects in a long time.  I guarantee that bungie can see when people get disconnected and the error they got...so don't apply a ban when that happens. At a minimum if you leave manually you get a ban. There's no downside to that.
DestinyTheGame,3e2hzu,BiNiaRiS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:06 2015 UTC,"In any matchmaking activity, there should be incentive to stay.   100% agree."

DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,MizterF,26,Tue Jul 21 17:16:31 2015 UTC,I'd almost rather go back to the old faction packages. At least I could trade Ascendant mats for more than 1 Mote nowadays. Getting one Mote a package is a slap in the face for the time it takes to level factions.
DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,eliasgreyjoy,9,Tue Jul 21 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"All of the materials are shrug-worthy.  It would be nice to get a guaranteed item from the weapon, armor, emblem, shader, or ship pool."
DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,HoboAndyJoe,3,Tue Jul 21 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"Motes can get you Exotic engrams and rerolls. Hardly shrug-worthy. Weapons, however, I have just about 0 use for."
DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,eliasgreyjoy,7,Tue Jul 21 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Guaranteed weapon or armor drops would be better.   Why? Because if it's a shit roll on either, you can scrap it for a mote. Ideal armor rolls can be few and far between, and not always available at vendors. It would be nice if the opportunity for one came slightly more often."
DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,FacelessGod,3,Tue Jul 21 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"I wasn't clear with my comment, the materials are boring.  Of course they serve their purpose, but I at least have more fun getting an item to examine.  Then if the item sucks it can be a mote."
DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,HoboAndyJoe,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"but I would rather get legendary gear with new stat / perk combinations that I can ascend. If I wanted to farm for motes of light, there are much better ways to do it than faction farming."

DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,SavagePope51,3,Tue Jul 21 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"I made a post months ago outlining 89 Faction Packages and have logged about 60 additional packages since then.  Once I hit rank 100 with Future War Cult (currently 91!) I'll be making another post to look at the actual results of a decent sample size.  Given all the packages I've recorded, you have about a 50% chance at a Legendary item every time.  This doesn't mean you can't get a terrible streak of luck where you get a mote or coin every package for five or six in a row.  It also doesn't discount the possibility of multiple shaders back-to-back... but over a long time period, half your packages will have Legendaries.  Do you feel 50% Legendary chance is too low?  How would you change it?  Would you guarantee a Legendary every rank?  Personal Opinion:  We need some awesome high-rank rewards that can be purchased.  Hell, at rank 100 I should have some amazing exotic FWC Cloak for my Hunter.  Let everyone see it at the vendor so they have something to chase."

DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,jomiran,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"Do both!  Hell, put some absolutely insane reward at rank 200."
DestinyTheGame,3e3ch0,ZarathustraEck,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"Rank 100 gear would be amazing (assuming it was well done), and fix the constant complaint that there is nothing to grind towards.  Selfishly, I'd vote for rank 50 gear too. I've been chasing shaders by focusing all three toons on a single faction (only missing Tyre now), so for the most part all three toons are rank 20-30 on all three factions. Tyre has been my white whale for months, so they're all highest in FWC (each rank 30-45 with Lakshmi)."

It takes some serious time, be it via bounties or some mindless Cosmodrome grinding, to rank up to the higher levels.  Reward that beyond just an additional chance.

As you make precision hits mulligan's proc rate raises by 10-15%, up to three stacks. Reward the players who are landing hits with a higher chance of getting that mulligan so they can keep on rolling."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Agueybana,5,Tue Jul 21 14:37:52 2015 UTC,"That's actually a super good idea, however I think you could lower the percent and simply put ""hits"" increase the chance of proc.

DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Reasel,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, but make the perk on IB be hits increase chance to refund ANY shot regardless of hit or miss. This way if you get rolling you can last longer. This would leave Mulligan at a perk level normal, but IB at an exotic one."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,dlauer70,7,Tue Jul 21 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"20% seems fair in light of the nerfs. Actually, I think 20% would have been fair before the nerfs."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,evilparker,10,Tue Jul 21 16:29:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I rarely flat out miss with a sniper, making Mulligan in its current form useless. I've always thought Mulligan would be way more useful if it had a 5% chance to return a round to the magazine on a non-critical hit, rather than a miss. You wouldn't get a ton of ammo back, but you'd see it proc occasionally, and would become very useful with adjustments being made to Ice Breaker and Black Hammer."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,evilparker,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting take on the perk, I'd have to say I'm in that camp as well for PvE. But in PvP we've all been know to miss a shot or two. The interesting thing I think about this perk is that you brought up a good point. Does the perk even need to do what it initially stated it does.  Perhaps the perk could work like this ""missing a shot has a chance to add it to the mag on your next reload"""
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,killbot0224,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Black Hammer and Ice Breaker are almost strictly PvE weapons, so that's what I was thinking about. And after posting, it occurred to me that Mulligan is on weapons that can't crit, like rocket launchers.  So maybe a better fix would be to leave Mulligan, or increase its proc rate slightly, and add another perk to take its place on certain snipers."

The reason I felt mulligan was integral now more than ever is that both rifles have exceeding small magazines. Running out of ammo will be a very real issue, which is I'm sure planned. But the chance to return ammo on a miss currently doesn't exist with the rifles perks in their current state."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Reasel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:22 2015 UTC,I think with the new weapon tuning they need to replace mulligan with performance bonus and both of those. Seems to proc more and encourages hits instead of rewarding poorly placed shots.

While I agree it would be interesting to see that swap, I feel a redesign of the mulligan perk would help to keep some of the exotics and legendaries with the perk unique. Rather than just homogenize them with better perks that already exist."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Kaiju_Blue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"It always procs when...  Emptying out for heavy ammo glitch.  But agree - it needs to be 20% to make up for the ridiculous nerf to Icebreaker. I don't find BH to be that nerfed, they essentially ammo limited it for bosses (although now I am going to wish chests still dropped special ammo synth)."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Kaiju_Blue,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, I hear that.  i agree I think BH won't be hit with the bat as hard as a lot of people are assuming however missing a shot with it due to a flinch or slight over correction is going to really show up now."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,j-j-j-jidders,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:19 2015 UTC,It already really did..It used to be that missing a shot lost you that clips of fired shots and a reload animation. Now you lose ammo regardless and still have the reload animation if you miss..it is just ammo capping the Damage output. With 18 shots total you will still kill most things right away if you are perfect.
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Call_me_Tom,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"while i do agree with the nerfs they got, hell yeah mulligan needs to be reworked or replaced."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Awesomesauce40,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:45 2015 UTC,I think the perfect solution would be to make it 100% proc chance with a short internal cooldown. 5 seconds or so.
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Bu11etToothBdon,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:22 2015 UTC,Almost a mini White Nail perk at that point.
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,djob13,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:11 2015 UTC,"except White Nail rewards performance, whereas this would only slightly alleviate failure."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Reasel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"If they REALLY want the regen rate on Icebreaker to be 8 seconds, then let us pick up special ammo for it. Or maybe, picking up special ammo gives you a decrease in ammo regen cooldown for a period of time. That way the 8 second ammo regen only negatively effects you if you are using Icebreaker for nefarious means."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,DramaticaUnknwn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"After the nerf was announced I put the BH away & just use my solar Spear with Double Down, Field Scout & Final Round. Both got nerfed but the Spear makes a better PvE replacement for the BH."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,EsplodingBomb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"I'll tell ya I was using my spear as well until yesterday when I rerolled it from AP rounds FR to what you have now except it has mulligan. It works very similarly to BH without the ammo brick pick up being only +4, but that mulligan perk got me really thinking how rough the IB and BH will have it going forward."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,krisbaird,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"20% chance seems fair. Snipers don't miss too often, but you would have a 1/5 chance of getting the shot back"
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,krisbaird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:49 2015 UTC,I'd seen somewhere that it was suggested it get bumped to 25% I think 15-20% is far more reasonable. Again that's purely on the basis that the perk should stay in it's current configuration.
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,xmandalore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"I don't always see mulligan proc, but when I do it's on IB.  Probably because I'm trying to get quick shots off and it kicks like a mule."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,Eicr-5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"You know, I've been thinking about icebreaker, and I have a different idea on how to handle it. I think that instead of a flat rate of recharge, they could change it to where the recharge rate is based on the amount of ammo left in the clip. If one round is fired, the recharge rate for that one round would be 5 seconds, like it currently is. For every subsequent round, 1 second is added. So if you fired 3 rounds it would be 7 seconds for the first to recharge, 6 for the next, 5 for the last. Firing a couple shots and then switching weapons would result in a minimal drop in dps, and the player would only be penalized for using all or most of the mag."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,lonely_neuron1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"Flip this cooldown scheme. The gun is designed to be fired switched from and fire your other guns to come back to later. If you have the first bullet spawn slowly then it really hurts your ammo decisions. If you fire a full clip and switch then you can get 1 bullet fast, but the second will be slower. So it will be harder to get full clip..  Or just make the regen faster when you are not holding it. So 8 seconds when it is out and 5 when stowed, but with similar things that you described."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,trolljoy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. Mulligan would be a semi valuable asset if they bump it up to 25%. Hell, I'd be happy with 15 to 20% at the very least. Legendaries and Exotics that has this would have their value go up by a margin as well.  But yeah, don't bump it up to Super Good Advices level. That'd be too OP."
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,lt08820,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I have to say at this point weapons with the mulligan perk are pretty much sharded or rerolled on site. I really doubt it was Bungies intent to create a perk that doesn't work as they had hoped.
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,infiniteinsulin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:06 2015 UTC,I am not a fan of a perk that only activates when I miss. I don't like perks that have a 5% chance of activating. I fucking hate a perk that only activates after I miss and has a 5% chance of activating!  Literally any other sniper perk would be an improvement to these weapons. Even if mulligan activated 50+% of the time I'd rather have something that rewards actually hitting my target.
DestinyTheGame,3e2mxs,infiniteinsulin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:31 2015 UTC,A fair statement and as suggested above there are quite a few ways to quickly remedy what a lot of people regard as something they dont want to do with their sniper. Miss.

When diving, as you go deeper underwater, the pressure is higher, so all the gases are more compressed. Then as you ascend, the pressure decreases. So all those same gases expand. If your lungs were full of air, they'd expand as well and literally tear apart. Like you filled a balloon with too much air.  Same for in space, what we'd consider ""normal"" air pressure is still much higher than the pressure of space, so all the gases in our lungs would want to expand to the surrounding air pressure. (You'd be fine in a spacesuit as those regulate air pressure, but if you were to lose pressure for whatever reason. Like a leak in your suit, or get ejected from your ship, or whatever)"

DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,HyFikz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:49 2015 UTC,Hand of Osiris is a toughie. The intention was to make it achievable for a select few (I've only gotten a tier five once...[sad]).

Cauldron: Conduit of Osiris  KD: 3.53 61/62 games won (98.4%) win Combat Rating: 505.1  Shouldn't that grant tier 1?  I mean shit look at Widow's Court where I also had Conduit of Osiris.  KD: 4.28 21/21 games won (100%) Combat Rating: 523.3   The only time I have Hand of Osiris is week 1 when ironically I did the worst.   KD: 3.88 57/60 games won (95.0%) Combat Rating: 306.2 (woof)  http://destinytracker.com/destiny/trials/xbox/fley%20ender
DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,Fley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:20 2015 UTC,I believe Tier 6 is better than Tier 1 based on the minimum game requirements. But I have nearly a 2 KD with a combat rating in the 400 range in Trials and I'm only Tier 3.
DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,DarkenedNight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:45 2015 UTC,my kd is above 3 and my combat rating is in 500s but still just conduit... idk the only time it shows I have Hand of Osiris is week 1 when I did worse than recent weekends.
DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,Fley,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:28 2015 UTC,"yep. the Tiering system seems overly punitive and/or heavily weighted towards games played, penalizing efficiency (effectively going 21-0), but either way, its a cool feature."

DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,autokill9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:23 2015 UTC,LFG is a rough place to find players for ToO. The vast majority are not going flawless very often.  I think this resource will improve the LFG experience for some people who are struggling to get into better groups because their overall history looks weaker. This tool will help show off recent successes and improvements in K/D or win% that get lost in the aggregate.

DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,FoxtrotOscarX_ray,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:08 2015 UTC,For amount of times being flawless you could give a rough estimate. You should be able to see win streaks since the win/loss data is there. If you see 9 in a row you can consider that flawless. It will add more complexity if you consider boons as the mercy boon will mix stuff up but maybe one of you is smart enough to figure it out

Thought I did pretty well on it (not flawless or anything, 8-2 at best), but didn't realize my cr was that high.   I really should have played more this weekend, especially seeing how effective Hopscotch Pilgrim was at combating the Thorn scourge (used it constantly after the first match, which I tanked out on).

DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,YouSeemNiceXB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:14 2015 UTC,Combat rating and this tier shit makes no sense. The ratings are based on too much arbitrary shit. 9+ kills per game and a 2.57 k+a/d and I'm only a conduit?
DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,rsdon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:53 2015 UTC,Win % and games played? Kill per game avg isnt weighed as heavily as games played and win%. It's prob calc'ed like true skill.

DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,Yu5or,0,Tue Jul 21 15:08:20 2015 UTC,How does that work exactly without private servers? Do you just keep joining Skirmishes until you're matched up against each other?

DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,Dyklone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"It does have the highest minimum, which is 28 games.  All 3 characters combined, this is a reasonable min for those who want to be Top Tier. This formula also can be tweaked if needed, and we assumed it would be needed after we got this out to the people."
DestinyTheGame,3e2i1c,sl4ck3r5,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"28 games is a more than fine minimum, but past 28 games I am not sure why someone who has 2.0 k/ds and 90% wins with 150 games played gets hand of osiris (which they should), but someone with 3.0 k/d, 95% wins with 67 games played (which is more than the minimum) doesn't get it. I don't have a problem with the minimum, but going well above and beyond the minimum shouldn't allow you to get it with worse stats than someone who was also over the minimum but didn't have time to play 150 games."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Ben826,146,Tue Jul 21 05:56:43 2015 UTC,As a member of the Vex Mythoclast fan club....i'm crying tears of joy
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Spike__Jonze,50,Tue Jul 21 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"As a member of the Plug One.1 fan club, I'm crying tears of anguish.  The most high risk, high reward weapon type in Crucible will now be even higher risk for even less reward... as if the current state of affairs hadn't already driven off all the but most proficient fusion rifle wielders. At least mine still has Send It to counteract the nerf partially.  Oh wait, they're nerfing Send It too."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,CaptFrost,2,Tue Jul 21 07:34:59 2015 UTC,How does Range actually affect a fusion rifle? I have never really understood it.   I have a Plug 1 with Range finder and perfect balance. And I would really like to learn how to actually use it before its nerfed into obscurity.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Raider1987,11,Tue Jul 21 12:27:19 2015 UTC,Range modifies how fast the bolts travel. Sort of like velocity on rocket launchers
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,GroovynBiscuits,15,Tue Jul 21 12:30:19 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why they don't just change the category to make it more relevant to the weapon type.  Stability on a rocket launcher for instance is a useless category. A much better approach would have been to split damage from blast radius, so that you could tweak those two values separately. Similarly, Fusion rifles should change their range stat, to a velocity stat."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,3,Tue Jul 21 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"Well that makes too much sense!  No, but really, that changing range into velocity is a smart idea. Be honest with the stats so regular people can play smart without the frustrations that come with hidden or counter-intuitive stats/descriptions."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Agueybana,0,Tue Jul 21 13:38:59 2015 UTC,But Fusion Rifles have damage drop off over range too so it's not like Range isn't a relevant stat to Fusion Rifles...
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,liquld,4,Tue Jul 21 14:01:39 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I heard FR don't have damage drop off over range. Their bolts just split up more so you do less damage."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,LobsterMcSnappity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"Its not exactly damage drop off, its related to the spread of the blast from fusion rifles similar to a shotgun. The blast from Fusion rifles is in the form of a cone. so lesser range will have bigger spread as the distance increases and vice versa."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,godproposes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"I believe it's Stability that effects the spread of the cone, while range effects the speed of the bolts. Do you know if that is correct?"
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,LobsterMcSnappity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, they don't. I also think that people should know what the stat actually does, it makes your bolts fly faster, allowing them to understand how their gun's handling will change with the perk."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Agueybana,0,Tue Jul 21 14:09:50 2015 UTC,"They actually don't have damage dropoff.  Each bolt hits with the same damage regardless of distance.  Bolts have a travel speed though, and that slows over distance.  As bolts slow down, their spread increases."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Bishizel,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:38 2015 UTC,"Most people on this sub agree that it doesn't, making the range value arbitrary."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,0,Tue Jul 21 14:32:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. Are there any low range fusion rifles that can roll reduced range barrels so the bolts travel really really slow? I want to be able to shoot, then dash into my own bolts and kill myself, because that's the only way I'd be getting fusion kills after this nerf."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,jonnyb8ta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but also dictates the distance at which damage begins decreasing."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,jako_01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:05 2015 UTC,From what I understand fusion rifles don't have a damage drop off making the range value pretty useless.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah there appears to be no falloff in terms of reduction, the particles just kinda stop. However range is still very important, it changes how far the particles actually go, and how wide the base cone is IIRC."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,rochford77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the cone be affected by stability instead?  Whenever I max stability on fusion rifles, my groupings are usually tighter than lower stability shots."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, the kick may ""draw a varticle line"" with the particles, but pulling down on the stick should fix this. There is a difference in recoil and stability. One is the kick, one is the guns ability to re center after the kick. But stability shouldn't change the cone toomuch so far as I know."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,rochford77,5,Tue Jul 21 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"It doesn't just affect the kick though. It groups the shots closer to each other allowing it to fire in a straight line. Without a smaller cone spread, this wouldn't be possible"
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:42 2015 UTC,Acc. Coils on Plug one turns it into a closer range death machine though. I'll probably switch back to that if range isn't working for me post 2.0
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,DunderMifflinPaper,2,Tue Jul 21 12:48:34 2015 UTC,"Its annoying though because it's not like melting people at that range (who are good at the game and constantly moving around) is easy. Of course anyone can melt someone who is standing still, that's a joke, but anyone can headshot someone standing still with a sniper too. I just don't understand Bungie."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,weglarz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"Just in case you didn't know, accelerated coils decreases the fusion rifle's damage."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,roburrito,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:51 2015 UTC,"It does slightly. I find that the tradeoff is okay on the plug one, since the impact is so high as is. I basically use acc. coils to convert from long range to short-mid range, where I would prefer to have the faster charge since I'll be landing most of the bullets at that distance anyways. At long range though acc. coils isn't great because missing a couple bolts leaves enemies with a sliver of health sometimes."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,DunderMifflinPaper,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:55 2015 UTC,"Right but most fusion riffles have high enough impact for it to not matter. fake numbers if someones health is 80, and a given fusion riffle hits at 110 before the range falloff if you hit with the full spread, and it takes a 10% reduction in impact for a 10% faster charge, then you still have a one hit kill but its a faster shot. Super useful if you have a shotgun charging you, and you blink backwards and have very little time before that party crasher +1 is within range.  Split shifter (void, coils, ramgefinder, spray and play) and plan c are my most used special weapons. And I have a party crasher with shot package and small bore."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,rochford77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"uggh, my plug 1 with send it wasn't killing anyone with full body shots just outside shotgun range! even streamed to a buddy to make sure I'm not crazy!"
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,minibudd,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"My Plug One.1 with send it kills people from stupid far distances in one blast. Perhaps you need to lead them more. Also, aim for the knees."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Himalayissis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:24 2015 UTC,"FRs seem to be really sensitive to ""micro"" lags because they take more time to hit. The real strange ones are when you hit them and it takes 1-2 seconds for them to die properly...or not at all. In that timeframe you wonder should you shoot again or focus on another target which is quite irritating."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,nisaaru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"don't even get me started on that lag shit.  launched a game, ran around a corner and saw a titan, pulled the trigger point blank on my Party Crasher aimed directly at his chest. I drop dead due to his shotgun that I never heard but he does lose all his armor and a little bit of his health. I'm so sick of it, I leave the game and immediately test my connection speed:  21ms, 94mpbs down and 12mbps up. Never seen a red bar in crucible in my life. But so many encounters end up like this thanks to so many weapons now having absurdly low TTK's and no dedicated servers. This is why the nerf has to happen and the TTK needs to come up. For the very least to compensate for lag in PvP."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,minibudd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:53 2015 UTC,"21 ping is low but I have you beat, I live practically on the exchange so typically ping is 10-14. Red bars in my games have an extraordinary advantage over me and other green bars. Pulse rifles kill with the first burst (obviously they have fired more). They are basically MLG then I check their stats after the game and their KD is like 0.7 lol.  I've added 0.2 to my KD in a month by backing out instantly if I get the one burst kill blast. You can mitigate it by playing very conservatively but it's more fun just to find another game.  CoD is even worse to be fair, the ttk is so low that much of the time I am already dead before taking damage."

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,carmachu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:07 2015 UTC,As a fan of fusion rifles like they were in alpha/beta I've been crying since they were nerfed the first time. They were beautiful weapons of mass destruction and now they kind of just sit around and gather dust.  I rolled (what I thought was) a pretty good snakebite surgeon and I got a kill with it halfway leveled. A kill. Not like back in the day when you could just clean up with a fusion rifle.  Why I can land a shot at AR/PR distance and not get a kill is beyond me

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,knockoutking,4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:34 2015 UTC,I was hoping these changes would do something positive for the Vex. It's already been gimped into oblivion over the year. Leaving it as is while great that it doesn't get worse doesn't change the fact it's basically useless in PVE (Minus Solar Burn or Special Weapons modifier) and isn't that great in PVP anymore (Still decent weapon but not like its former pre-nerf patch glory).

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,lousy_at_handles,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:57 2015 UTC,Hands down favorite weapon in the game. From the design to the bullet sound to the uniqueness when it comes being an auto fusion rifle.

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,knockoutking,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:07 2015 UTC,Funny they can tweak non exotics.   Wonder why they aren't doing that with hand cannons?
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,PAWGslayer,13,Tue Jul 21 06:44:51 2015 UTC,"Because fuck us, that's why"
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,v3ntti_,2,Tue Jul 21 07:01:30 2015 UTC,"Because they wanted to further differentiate Hand Cannons from Scout Rifles, since Hand Cannons could still challenge and win against Scouts in ranges that shouldn't really be possible, especially when they were specialized for Range.   It's also why Scout Rifles are being tuned so that they are less-effective in closer ranges, where they will be at a disadvantage against Auto Rifles and Hand Cannons.  The Devil You Know and Lord High Fixer from Vanilla Destiny, as well as the Red Hand IX among others are examples of Legendaries that could have just as much range Hawkmoon and Thorn."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Orochidude,5,Tue Jul 21 09:17:46 2015 UTC,Yes...I miss my Lord High Fixer. I wish I hadn't needed the energies.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,westen81,3,Tue Jul 21 14:39:38 2015 UTC,How are they being tuned to be less-effective in close ranges?  I missed that one.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,sirpicklesjr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:16 2015 UTC,"Reduction in hip-fire accuracy, IIRC."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,lousy_at_handles,0,Tue Jul 21 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"Legendary Handcannons could use a little dialing back. They aren't out of hand like their exotic counterparts, but definitely work beyond their intended, balanced,  scope of close to mid range by extending into long range category.  To my understanding, the primary weapon balance should fit as follows:  Auto rifles - Close to mid range (less accurate, forgiving missed shots)   Handcannons - Close to mid range (accurate, punishing missed shots)   Pulse Rifles - Mid range champions (a bit awkward up close without Hip fire perk, long range shots taking more time between shots to be accurate)   Scout Rifles - Mid to long range (Top DPS at longer distances, no need to pace shots, but bad hip fire accuracy)"
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,hurricane_eddie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:47:08 2015 UTC,"Scout rifles are good in theory, but not in practice.  While they are a top DPS at long range, the only place in crucible where they are relliable is in combined arms, and there is almost surelly a sniperfest."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,jako_01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:55 2015 UTC,I strictly use VoC and have been doing pretty well.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,grifmasta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think this is one of those ""beauty in the eye of the beholder"" things. Right now scout rifles are mediocre due to high range hand cannons (thorn). I, myself, am an avid user of MIDA and the Scholar and know that scout rifles definitely have a role to fill.   Once the weapon patch hits, scout rifles are going to be something to be reckoned with. Without the true threat of a two-shot thorn, SRs will finally have a time to shine. They are great for dispatching snipers, excellent for on the run kills, and top notch for clean up. They do falter at close range, but you can't have everything."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Galactiiiic,0,Tue Jul 21 15:00:40 2015 UTC,"Are they nerfing the range on Thorn? If not, then a simple DoT nerf isn't gonna cut it and allow Scout Rifles to shine."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,AnEmoReaper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:31 2015 UTC,Yes they are pulling down range and increased damage drop off.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Galactiiiic,59,Tue Jul 21 18:35:49 2015 UTC,I love my scout rifles in Combined Arms. Either run MIDA Multitool or High-Caliber Rounds and you'll have a pretty good chance at ruining their shots while you peck them down. I win a lot more long range battles than I should with this.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Lotoran,38,Tue Jul 21 15:23:07 2015 UTC,Auto scout rifles and the focused fire auto rifles seem to basically be the exact same gun. I feel like destiny has one too many weapon classes.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Krytan,10,Tue Jul 21 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"And a few select maps, like Shores of Time."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,400MeterOval,8,Tue Jul 21 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"This, exactly. I've been watching every streamer's opinion on the balance since announcement and it seems the general consensus is that Bungie is trying to make every weapon fill out a very particular role. It's not that they're trying to make Hand Cannons weaker than Auto Rifles or anything like that. They're trying to basically re-think Hand Cannons into being, in a way, a completely new take on the weapon class which is close to mid-range only."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,najowhit,5,Tue Jul 21 13:34:45 2015 UTC,Did they have to nerf the mag for that though?
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,TheArgonian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"Well considering its short to mid range I imagine the thinking was that you can get two kills at that range with a full mag.   We still don't know how much the nerf is taking away, too."

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Jakaii,10,Tue Jul 21 07:28:38 2015 UTC,"This is important. The exchange in regards to ""they aren't fusion rifles"" is all about sidearms, not exotic fusion rifles. They must have some other plans for exotics, but they will be affected, they are still fusion rifles."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Agueybana,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"Seems like they can selectively apply the fusion rifle changes per fusion rifle, or that exotics are purposely be excluded from the upcoming change list."

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,DestinyRealTalk,3,Tue Jul 21 16:19:59 2015 UTC,Exactly. I won't believe him until I see it.  I still don't know why fusion rifles are getting a nerf in the first place.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Miles_Prower1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:55 2015 UTC,It is most likely a preemptive nerf. With shotguns being nerfed testing probably showed fusion rifles becoming too op or something along those lines.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Mason11334,3,Tue Jul 21 10:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah he doesnt know what he's talking about, they are most definitely fusion rifles and will be hit by the nerf unless bungie specifically prevents it from happening."

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Agueybana,4,Tue Jul 21 13:45:51 2015 UTC,Great news. QBB has quickly become the most fun gun for me to use. I was hoping they didn't find a way to mess it up.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,mikel5047,5,Tue Jul 21 06:32:52 2015 UTC,Same here. It was already sort of difficult dealing with the travel time with the Bow. Glad it won't be any worse.

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,thepotatochronicles,7,Tue Jul 21 14:34:05 2015 UTC,Based on what? There is zero need to lead your shot with that thing
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Halo_cT,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"There is depending on your range and what direction the target is running. It might not be a big lead, but if they're running perpendicular to your aim, you'll definitely need a slight lead. Annoying part is it doesn't look like you do."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,exproject,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:09 2015 UTC,maybe I just havent used it at long enough range; I definitely havent noticed this.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Halo_cT,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"Lol, the exotic sidearm needs a massive buff for pve.  It's already worthless.   They need to quadruple the damage per shot.  Maybe five times.  Worthless in Poe against anything yellowbar."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Jammer321,2,Tue Jul 21 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"Lord of Wolves fires like a pulse rifle, but with the damage and range of a shotgun. Dreg's Promise fires like a pulse rifle, but with the range of a shotgun and the damage of a pulse rifle."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,roburrito,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:51 2015 UTC,Well said. Except the Lord of Wolves' range outclasses any shotgun.   It dominates in PvE and has made me shelve my Gjally for weeks.   Dreg's Promise on the other hand is probably the worst exotic in the game.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,willyspub,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:41 2015 UTC,I actually like Vestian Dynasty when I know there is going to be alot of Fallen enemies since it does bonus damage to them.  I could imagine using it in a Arc Burn Fallen strike like Devils Lair or Taniks would be fun.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,panopticon31,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:53 2015 UTC,I just dont get how u can possibly nerf fusion rifles anymore than they already are they are damn near as bad as auto rifles if u compare them to shotguns in pve or pvp
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Stooboot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:16:20 2015 UTC,"In PvE I agree they suck. But in PvP I can still one-shot Felwinter's/Party Crasher/Matador shotgun rushers from safe distance just fine. I use GIVE/Take Equation with Rangefinder and Accelerated Coils if anyone is curious. It doesn't have the highest range, but its high stability makes it fire like a laser beam.  I think a lot of people tend to ignore the stability stat for FR. They treat it like shotguns and focus purely on maxing out the range. The new nerf spread makes the stability stat even more critical than ever before. Range doesn't mean jack shit if only 1 or 2 of your beams are actually connecting with the target.  I encourage anyone who is getting ready to call it quits on FRs to try and reforge theirs with better stability (or get one with better base stability stats). You're going to see a HUGE difference in the way they perform with the latest patch changes."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,mmiski,2,Tue Jul 21 10:40:55 2015 UTC,Ohh that's what I'm rolling for. The Give/Take Equation is a beast!

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,westen81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:41 2015 UTC,take off accelerated coils and you'll do more damage. i love my praetorian foil with the stability boost.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,kansasjeremy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:43 2015 UTC,Yeah that's SGA. I know about the slight nerf but I usually use FRs when I'm close enough where that extra damage won't even matter. Either way I think Bungie needs to fix this so the stats are reflected more accurately with the perk.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,mmiski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:52 2015 UTC,oh totally. i had NO clue that accelerated coils dropped the damage until i read another thread here. getting a high impact FR with good stability and range is crazy good in crucible if used right.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,kansasjeremy,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. They need a buff in PVE atleast, not a fucking nerf. But hey, the way they keep failing, soon they need to actually do something right. By just plain RNG luck."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Pe-Te_FIN,2,Tue Jul 21 09:40:25 2015 UTC,They need to remove crits on shotguns and give fusions the ability to do crit damage instead
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"I think every gun should be able to crit. As with fusions you can stay bit longer range ( and with shotgun nerfs inc ) it shouldnt do as much damage as shotgun, but still almost the same."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Pe-Te_FIN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"I just think that crit damage on shotguns is part of the problem with the weapon type, its base damage is already extremely lethal, doubling the damage just leads to overkill , and it's not like to can aim it to be more accurate. The bullet spread is random, which means it's more of a chance game that you may of may deal enough damage with the crit multiplier to get the kill."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,3,Tue Jul 21 13:41:39 2015 UTC,"Well nerf to shotpackage etc might change that. Shotguns should be lethal in point blank range. Bungie just didnt take into account the possible perk combinations you could stack on them.  Thats why they removed perks you couldnt get to certain weapons (because of reroll possibility). And finally they are going to nerf the perks people got before they removed the perks to level the playing field a bit.  This is the problem with perk system. Do you balance everything on ""average"" perks or best possible ones ? If you choose best possible, the weapon isnt worth using unless you have best rolls. And if average, the weapon is going to be OP with certain perk combos."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Pe-Te_FIN,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:16 2015 UTC,"Alternately, they could also remove crit shots and keep the perks the same, letting shotguns keep their range but remove the chance factor of crit shots. This net damage nerf would ensure that more encounters from that shotgun range would be survivable due to removing the chance factor of crit shots netting you the kill in those instances"
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,EDGE515,4,Tue Jul 21 13:55:30 2015 UTC,Or make it so they can't crit past 5 feet.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,westen81,5,Tue Jul 21 15:04:39 2015 UTC,Fusion rifles are really only bad because there are too many shotguns with absurd ranges. It's possible that they nerfed shotguns and found that fusion rifles were too powerful. So they're nerfing both at the same time by different amounts so that everything ends up balanced. I don't know if they'll actually succeed but that's probably their thought process. M
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,cs_anon,3,Tue Jul 21 18:34:09 2015 UTC,So the Mythoclast will continue to stay mediocre instead of becoming complete garbage. Fantastic!

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,hydruxo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:52 2015 UTC,The last part doesn't fill me with confidence. The Hand Cannon in the TTK build was awful. But the shotgun was a lot more balanced at least. Or they seemed that way.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,CookiesFTA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:33 2015 UTC,"I agree so much with this. The HandCannons at E3 were pitiful. I'm hoping it was just the specific HC not the overall nerf. Otherwise, I may as well put my favourite weapon type to bed."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,JFurl0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm really worried about with this patch. Hand Cannons are fun now, but I'm not entirely confident that that will still be the case once this goes live."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,CookiesFTA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:35 2015 UTC,I am fully expecting HCs to go the way of the Auto Rifle. And that would ruin PvP for me atm.  I like some of the legendary HCs like the Jewel of Osiris and Fulcrum. I feel like they are going to get nerfed into the ground.   All that really needed to happen was Thorn needed to be pretty much taken out of the game and TLW needed a range nerf and fix the ADS 111 glitch. Maybe HCs overall could have taken a small range nerf but they don't need a huge range nerf and a magazine nerf. Completely uncalled for in my eyes.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,JFurl0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:43 2015 UTC,"Or maybe we just got used to Hand Cannons being too good. I feel as though real life isn't a bad thing to use as an example. Smaller caliber handguns are easier to control, larger caliber harder. If we're mostly running around with larger caliber, that makes sense.   I saw Datto's take on the hand cannon and it looks a lot like a combination of both. Looked like the hand cannon he had had sketchy stats and also the gun was just performing differently. Which I am ok with. This game need variety, badly. I also want to choose different guns for different maps/playstyles. Right now I only need about 2 loadouts for all maps, even Bastion and First Light."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,coasterreal,0,Tue Jul 21 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think all HCs are too good. If you see what I've replied above, you'll see what I'm saying.   Legendary HCs didn't need the magazine nerf or a huge range nerf. Just a small range nerf would have done it.  Thorn needed to be taken back to where it started and TLW only needed a small range nerf and the fix to the ADS 111 glitch.   Seems Bungie have seen fit to just destroy an entire class of guns again. BUT as always I'll wait and see. I just really enjoy HCs as a whole. Not just the overpowered ones."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,JFurl0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:34 2015 UTC,"I did read what you replied to. However, you generalized it to all hand cannons by saying    Otherwise, I may as well put my favourite weapon type to bed.   I don't think the whole class will be destroyed. We have just gotten used to them doing insane damage over huge distances with really easy to use guns. Especially a few guns just breaking the whole slot in general. Most of them did need a huge range nerf.  We compared a 300 Fatebringer against a 331 Gheleons Demise - the highest impact scout rifle at the time. From distances where you could barely make out head of the enemy, the Fatebringer - against a level 32 did almost the same damage as the 331 Gheleons. So even at a disadvantage, at ranges way too far, it was doing about 200 less per headshot than a gun designed just for that. I then replicated that with other similar hand cannons.   HC should never be doing similar damage to scout rifles. Their effectiveness should really start to die off where mid range Pulse rifles come in. Longer range Pulse Rifles should have a clear advantage over any Hand Cannon IMO. However, a HC should have a quicker TTK and thus inside those shorter ranges, should I venture there with my Pulse rifle, I should die."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,coasterreal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:43 2015 UTC,"I agree they need a range nerf. 100%. But it needs to be clever. I'm not sure exactly what Bungie are going for. They want PRs to be a 2/3 shot kill but want to bring HCs down to a 5/6 shot kill.   Doesn't this just manage to make PRs the go to weapon once TKK comes. Messenger and Red Death all over the place is what I see happening.   I think overall, I just don't want to see a single primary type meta again. Nerfing HCs will force PRs to the top. Bungie needs to be clever and bring ARs and HCs in line with it to allow a balanced over all meta."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,JFurl0,2,Tue Jul 21 14:02:11 2015 UTC,5/6 shot kill? nothing was mentioned about HCs taking an impact nerf
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Zakman--,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:38 2015 UTC,The damage drop off is now a lot closer to the player meaning you have less damage at any sort of range.
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,JFurl0,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:51 2015 UTC,which is what they intend to happen. Bungie want them to be close-mid range weapons
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Zakman--,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"I get that, but that's extreme close range. Why not run a shotgun instead?"
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,JFurl0,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"so use them as they should be used, get in close."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,itwasmeberry,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:44 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand, close is fine but the time it takes to take 5/6 won't be quick enough to kill someone before they can charge at you with a shotgun. Only TLW would be able to do that and with it's magazine nerf you'd need to hit every single shot.  'Use it as it should be used' is a pointless statement. Go use Auto Rifles as they are meant to be used and get back to me."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,JFurl0,3,Tue Jul 21 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"Current range nobody is disputing, magazine sizes I would argue because last year they were buffed damn it bungie! But accuracy nerfs are uncalled for especially since the last round of accuracy nerfs. Between game processing hand cannon headshots with white damage as a ""nerf"" and lag sometimes not processing damage at all these guns are going to become unreliable in the extreme."
DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,dregpride,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:34 2015 UTC,I agree with you on HCs vs. scout rifles.  I'm just skeptical that they can implement five nerfs on HC at one time without totally breaking them.  They have consistently shown their tendency to swing the pendulum too far and then wait until the next big patch to fix it.

I seriously can't understand this train of logic. They said they're going to tweak fusion rifles, not sidearms. How difficult is that to understand? Next thing someone will ask if is they're affected by the hand cannon nerfs."

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,alan_daniel,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:29 2015 UTC,"Past changes to fusion rifles didn't affect rocket launchers or Golden Gun (that was the hand cannon nerf) which, before sidearms were introduced, were the only non-hitscan weapons (correct me if I'm wrong).

DestinyTheGame,3e1hcg,Onslaught187,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, FR's have no drop off in the classical sense as every bolt does the same amount of damage.  However.  Range affects the distance at which the bolts will spread in such a manner that its unlikely that all, or even most of the bolts will hit the targeted area. In other words, the projectile spread.  At close distance the guns look like 1 hko because the bolts are close enough together that most, or even all of them hit.  Be hit by only a couple projectiles tho and the thing just tickles.  I'm not sure renaming the stat to velocity would be less deceptive. But it could be renamed spread, same change would make sense in SG's too."

DestinyTheGame,3e2l85,runyoudown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"I said ""about equal"" because going from level 30 to level 32 is a 31-point increase in attack (300 to 331), but going from level 32 to level 34 is a 34-point increase in attack (331 to 365).

DestinyTheGame,3e2l85,Duuzi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:57 2015 UTC,Yes. So are Monte Carlo and Hawkmoon.  A few strikes as well.

Don't worry until auto rifles get buffed monte Carlo isn't anything special. 4th horseman is okay but I prefer invective for an exotic shotgun

What can we make if we take the assumptions that:   Bell = Bell Curve Normal refers to a normal distribution.   sounds as though there is somehow skewed data. As though there were a pile of data that doesn't fit a bell curve and therefore you do not have a normal distribution. Now someone relate this to Destiny."

Ice Breaker:   Please replace these components if use causes fatal damage: HEAT SINK. MAGAZINE. OPERATOR The Ice Breaker series was a clandestine project developed by the Vanguard in conjunction with various City weapons foundries. Meant as an exploration of Golden Age weapon technology, the project was scrapped after only a single weapon reached the testing phase.  The prototypes for the project's lone weapon are considered dangerous and unfit for field duty by the Vanguard. This hasn't stopped daring Guardians from seeking out the Ice Breakers - death, after all, is an occupational hazard.   Purifier Robes:    ""Fire is the breaking of bonds. Fire is freedom.

Even though you're dead, I'll always remember you, my deer.  The other hunter cloak with a deer on it, Dead Zone Revolution says ""With each new Dead Zone charted comes a new cloak pattern from the Hunter elite.""

DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,PraiseTheVoid,15,Tue Jul 21 14:43:01 2015 UTC,I wondered the same thing. I don't think that this is ever said. Here's the Whirlwind category on Ishtar Collective.  I presumed that the 'Great Machine' leaving caused the 'Whirlwind' – the Fallen seem to want to get the Great Machine back for themselves. I don't think they would want to do that if it had intentionally ruined their atmosphere.
DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,lordbiro,7,Tue Jul 21 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think their ""Great Whirlwind"" = our ""Collapse""."

DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,PraiseTheVoid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the Traveler is not as good as we are lead to believe. It is possible that in its ""dying breath"" created the ghosts to created Guardians to defend it until it had strength enough to bail on us like it did the Eliksni."
DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,StephenAndrewK,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps the Traveler isn't sentient, just acting on protocol set up by something when it was created. That would explain why it replaced an ether atmosphere with oxygen.  Also, I don't have anywhere in the grimoire to point, this was told to me by some veteran guardians while raiding the Vault of Glass and I took them at their word. It does seem to me that combining some of Variks' cards, where he's in his tent and doesn't need his mask (implying an atmosphere of ether), the fact that the Traveler put oxygen on Mars/Venus, and the fact that the servitors are shaped like the Traveler and were created after the Whirlwind to provide ether that the Traveler ruined their homeworld and scattered them across the stars looking for it. As to why they'd be looking, well, they worshiped it as a god, and the what the gods take for whatever reason they can restore for another."

DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,Protoman12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:53 2015 UTC,Where does it even say that the fallen are from earth? They might just need the masks because they are no longer on their home world where the atmosphere was made up of ether.

DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,Thumper86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:51 2015 UTC,I think the Variks card refers to it as well.
DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,theironwall,7,Tue Jul 21 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"""Remember the age before the Whirlwind, when ether ran free, when we ruled ourselves and our futures as kings""  I don't think it's that he took away the atmosphere, rather their ether. It's in the Fallen 3 grimoire.  the second half notes: the City That Docks, which claimed for itself the Great Machine that might have saved us. Remember the City that even now sends its ghouls to murder our Primes, starve our ether, and leave our young to die gasping.  I'm going under the assumption they went to venus with sevitors to harvest ether and the traveler came in and took the ether and in part doomed their civilization as maybe venus was their only way of harvesting ether. It makes sense partly because venus has 'super hurricanes winds' running around the planet most notably one in the south pole. So maybe the traveler used this as a guise and it got paired with the planets weather and it became the 'great whirlwind'. I'm just throwing that out there, so take this with a grain of salt. takes tinfoil hat off"
DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,PsyMx,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The Fallen flourished in their own Solar system when the Traveler (great machine to them) blessed them. For some reason the ""fell"" from its grace and it left them. Leaving them vulnerable to The Dark (whatever that is) and confused, starting a Diaspora in search for new planets and survival (very much like Dead Orbit proposes), hence ""the great whirlwind"" as their once noble civilization crumbled and fell into chaos.  Now, some Houses wanted the Traveler/Great Machine back (it is even a sort of prophecy, that the Kell of Kells will win back the Traveler/Great Machine's grace back). And that led the Fallen to Earth, that led the Fallen Houses to unite in a final assault against our Last City. But as that assault failed at Twilight Gap (in part thanks to the Queen of the Reef for intercepting the House of Wolves preventing it from joining the assault, it became to them ""the City That Docks"". And that City still sends it ghouls (Us, revived, undead Guardians) to kill them.  In a way, the Traveler does take their Ether from them. Through us."
DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,theironwall,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"Feel free to disagree!  i was just taking a stab as to why.  I was merely throwing some ideas around based on the grimoire and some observations here and there, nothing serious on my end.  But you are Setting a way more accurate depiction as to why."

DestinyTheGame,3e2jik,EsplodingBomb,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"It's not just their masks the Ether is escaping from. The way I've always understood the Fallen is that Ether is basically their blood, aka their ""souls"". I mean if you shot a person's head clean off blood would be shooting out of their body.  And I'm not so sure about the whole Ether reacting to oxygen thing. I'd figure it's the sudden change in pressure and the rapidly escaping Ether that makes the sound, the pitch determined by how much Ether a Fallen had in their bodies and by how big their neck hole is. Anywhere you see a Servitor heal another Fallen it's actually releasing Ether for them to inhale, basically giving them a blood transfusion. We also see in some of Varkis's Grimore cards he pumps Ether into his little hut in the Reef."

DestinyTheGame,3e0k50,Jwillbeardman,9,Tue Jul 21 00:57:06 2015 UTC,"My working theory is that TLW is going to get dropped to 7 bullets in the mag after the patch. This is mainly from the Hawkmoon tweak in the notes saying that the Holding Aces perk will now add two bullets, suggesting that Hawkmoon is going to be affected by the blanket nerf, losing two bullets. Since this in turn suggests that exotics are getting hit by the nerf, 20% of 8 is 1.6, so either one or two bullets. Since the amount of bullets lost by Hawkmoon was rounded down, I'm assuming the same for TLW.   Or, they make it a 6-shot, because Westerns."
DestinyTheGame,3e0k50,ScholarlyKestrel,7,Tue Jul 21 02:01:21 2015 UTC,7 bullets I'm OK with. Any less would be a disaster. Please don't take TLW from us Bungie!

It was my first exotic and I opted to take VoC to 300 instead and use 3 legendaries in September just because TLW was near-useless in VoG. To me, that's good gun design.

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,BubbaOx,61,Mon Jul 20 21:49:50 2015 UTC,Think I dismantled about 40k worth of eye of sol's this weekend. Probably going to farm some more glimmer tonight too before reset. Rerolling is a helluva drug.
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,horaiyo,20,Mon Jul 20 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"So far since trials has started, I have bought 200k worth of the weapons over all of the weeks. This is the best source out there. 1hr exclusion zone = 25000 glimmer = ~115 weapon parts."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,TastyBleach,9,Tue Jul 21 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"You are better off just doing daily bounties and sinking them into green weapons. 3/4 parts per bounty per weapon (x3).  So thats ~12 per bounty. 5-10 Per toon, depending on how easy they are, if you do PvE & PvP, you can easily get ~150-300-500 weapon parts a day. And you get all that XP sunk into your Faction of choice."

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,TastyBleach,3,Tue Jul 21 04:51:13 2015 UTC,I've got exclusion zone down to 35-40 mins per 25k glimmer. It's produces 130 weapon parts. So every 50 minutes I get 130. And bounties take alot of time. Especially if your gonna do crucible.
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,IAmTheBADASS,2,Tue Jul 21 04:35:21 2015 UTC,absolutely this. I kinda lold when i read those above comments ..

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,Dragarius,3,Tue Jul 21 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"Is this sarcasm? I dont know I see people aren't keen on the bounties. Thats why I numbered it varying from 150 to 300 up to 500 parts a day.  Some days 5 PvE bounties can be completed all within the daily mission, and PvP bounties can be done in 3 matches or so.  And the whole point is you aren't mindless grinding Exclusion Zone, or Gatekeeper. You can run strikes, missions, do PvP. An hour a day and walk away with engrams, the odd time legendary armor/weapons, MoLs, Strange Coins & weapon parts.  To me that beats out grinding away a single instance of the game just to blow glimmer on break down items."

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,springfart,22,Tue Jul 21 03:19:36 2015 UTC,"Yep that's it. What I do is run through the first load of red adds, run to the right and over the bunker wall dealy. I count to 5 then run and jump towards the dropship that drops the yellow mobs. Just as the yellow mobs appear I launch nova bomb at the furthest four yellows (the left side), quickly turn in mid air and gally the right side. This normally finishes all of them, but I swap to by battle runner shotty to finish off any left overs, run around to pick up any triangles, then sprint back up top to get killed by a phalanx. I try to die as I chuck a grenade to get some extra kills, or if I got a ton of rockets I just run into the center and gally myself. takes 42-55 seconds for a good run that nets ~480 glimmer."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,TastyBleach,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:46 2015 UTC,SGA: You can squat in one of the dead cabal bodies and shoot yourself in knee. This is much faster than waiting for one of them to kill you.

Just rock shot guns, main issue is ammo and reloading but two guns can avoid this:   Universal remote, more shot shotguns Astral horizon, more ammo when you do a super   Only thing worth noting is that I use voidwalker. I go to the right, shoot 3 or 4 goblins, super the rest, back track around to the left, rocket or shoot the 4 goblins and super the remaining goblins. I use obsidian mind to get my super up asap and when i trigger the super my ammo is replenished from my astral horizon, not necessary if you have universal remote."

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,tryZEROg,7,Tue Jul 21 00:08:52 2015 UTC,"We all have a problem, and it's not having an actual source of Weapon Parts.   Bungie dismantled the first loot cave because they didn't want people shooting fish in a barrel to get through the game. What were doing here is pretty much the same thing just to have access to the new content of rerolling guns. Imo, it was better when we could trade Lord Salad Head 2 Motes of Light for a single reroll of an Iron Banner weapon <i> now we have to supply the nearly extinct Weapon Parts and Glimmer as well."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,Kamaki_kun,6,Tue Jul 21 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"Lol, totally with you. I have this problem too. I've got 3 weapons waiting to roll on, I just don't have the patience to farm, anything. I like playing the game instead of farming. If that means not rolling on things, or not getting X weapon or gear from IB, then that's my life choice. I buy what I can when I can, and I roll when I have spare parts. It's a bummer what the system has forced."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,tryZEROg,3,Tue Jul 21 01:33:22 2015 UTC,"Try listening to podcasts, music, or audiobooks while farming, it makes the whole experience a lot better"

It is there to rectify bad rolls, not to get the most OP, OMG this gun is godly, rediculous, go-to weapon ever, of all time.    Legendary guns are dropping like flies.  ANY legendary can be 365.  In vanilla destiny, you'd be lucky to get 3 or 4 legendary drops a week.  You had to deal with the roll you were dealt or buy what was provided by the quartermasters.  You'd have to do dailies and VoG to get a shit ton of ascendant materials to level it up.    I have no sympathy for someone who had 400 parts and blew them on getting good rolls.  That is the price you pay for trying to get OP weapons.  Want my suggestion?  Look around before thinking some weapon you got needs to be reforged.  VoG weapons have damn near perfect rolls each weapon type.  Vision of Confluence, Preadyths's Revenge, Found Verdict, Corrective Measure, Fatebringer, Praedyths's Timepiece, and Praetoean Foil are all amazing and can be upgraded.  Dead Orbit is selling a perfectly rolled PvP rocket launcher, Exodus Plan, with tripod AND hand grenades and horseshoes along with great base stats.  Osiris was selling the Summoner if you really wanted an amazing Auto Rifle, which I doubt, you should have played a little trials to get that amazing roll, and it didn't even need etheric light.  If you spent all those weapon parts trying to get one of the insanely stupid shotgun rolls that PvP is being flooded with, I have even less sympathy for your parts shortage."

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,Chippy569,4,Tue Jul 21 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"Or they could just remove weapon rerolling in TTK so you get excited about a weapon drop with good perks rather than: Oh, a legendary weapon, well it's not (insert best weapon in class here), dismantled.  Not remove weapon rerolling completely, it can stay for Iron Banner stuff.  Also, allow Iron Banner armor to be rolled."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,BackPropagation,2,Mon Jul 20 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but I personally really like reforging weapons. It gives us the option of rolling for builds that fit our own playstyles as well as reroll the burn if we need something specific.   I'd rather them add a bunch of new perks (which it seems like they are with TTK) so I feel like you wouldn't be forced to reforge for the ideal roll but different ones with different strengths.   That said, my disdain for non-reforgable legendaries is based mostly on the sad pre-HoW drop rates.   Now that they drop left and right, I would be more ok with removing reforging."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,mckinneymd,3,Mon Jul 20 22:12:08 2015 UTC,Reforging weapons brings a lot of variety to the game. Getting a new weapon and reforging with different perks to see how they can affect playstyles brings a breath fresh air into a rather unnecessarily grindy part of the game.
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,Saiyantai,3,Mon Jul 20 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"Reforging brings variety? Oh please, tell me how shotguns now have so much variety.   Getting a good roll on a gun before made you appreciate your weapons more. Now you can take any old gun and reforge for the best perks."

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,littlebigguy16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:13 2015 UTC,There's more to the game than just crucible. Idgaf about range on shotguns in PvE since things like full auto and army of one give far better utility.
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,IamManuelLaBor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:58 2015 UTC,"Especially when the meta changes as we're seeing happen with TTK and even back when crucible was updated to limit special ammo.   When Bungie makes changes to game rules and mechanics, it's nice to know that I can adapt if necessary versus grinding to get lucky on drops that fit the new changes."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,mckinneymd,22,Mon Jul 20 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Before re-rolling you rarely saw anything in crucible that wasn't exotic/Iron Banner. Now there's more weapons, and I think it'll be even more diverse after the 2.0 weapon balancing."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,FurTrader58,3,Tue Jul 21 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. Maybe you have time to grind out that perfect weapon engram, but I certainly do not. There is still plenty grind left to the game, and plenty of randomness still exists. Reforging was a QOL thing and it was one of the best additions to the game so far.   There's always going to be a statistically best combo of weapon/weapon perks, removing reforging just makes it so you have to be crazy lucky or you have to grind like crazy in order to get the weapon that you want. The only way removing reforging wouldn't make the game more tedious is if they made every gun equally good in every situation, in which case people would complain about homogenizing weapons."
DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,Mikeyyyc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:34 2015 UTC,that'd make more sense if weapon drops were more consistent.  But after grinding strikes for my hopscotch pilgrim i never want to do another strike again

Then just couldn't rebuild any alt's stock past 20 or 30.  Finally saw a post here last week suggesting to level greens while turning in bounties. If you run nightfalls, the buff gets almost all green weapons to xp max (don't fill in the nodes) with bounties worth 3750 xp or more. Boom. Now each bounty takes greens from 1 part to 3 PLUS The gunsmith (the Jerk taking all our parts) sells greens all the time just a few feet away from Xander for from 800-930 glimmer.   It's a little costly glimmer wise, but now most of your bounties can be worth 9 weapons parts each if you have all greens equipped.

DestinyTheGame,3dzqrr,rawrjoey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:29 2015 UTC,"I understand there are ways to farm weapon parts but its way better to just exchange them for marks. This way you don't have to go out of your way to waste glimmer on trials gear or xp on green armor/weapons and just play strikes or the pvp that we love and cap while playing the game and it doesn't fell like the second job we get paid for less than the state minimum.   Hell what are we going to do when TTK comes out? A whole new set of weapons and possible re-roll-able armor will be out even if you farm all day from now till TTK i don't think it will be enough. I cant even keep up with the sapphire wire for my hunter since exotics take 25 a pop and my old exotic weapons take too many weapon parts to ascend or level.  IMO let us exchange marks for weapon parts and/or Armor mats. From this reset till TTK we have 2,000 Vanguard & Crucible marks to farm per character. 6,000 marks for three + 1200 if you are already capped.  If they implement Weapon/Armor parts exchange 10 marks per 20 parts (like planetary materials) adding up all the amount above that should net us 14,400 weapon/armor parts or 7,200 for each.  Note: I'm bad at math if any math pro can fix any errors i'll be glad.  TLDR: Let us exchange marks for weapon parts and armor."

DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,MyJimmies,40,Tue Jul 21 11:33:33 2015 UTC,Zero orbs were created in the making of this film.
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,minibudd,3,Tue Jul 21 13:43:41 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this, but for some reason Arc Blade produces less damage per kill than any other super. If you Golden Gun an enemy and he produces 4 orbs for you, he will produce only 2 if you kill him with Arc Blade."
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,deadpool848,6,Tue Jul 21 13:45:33 2015 UTC,Bungie made it produce 1/2 the amount of orbs of other supers because the super has utility like increased maneuverability and stealth.
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,Hanes74,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:39 2015 UTC,I suppose that's a good reason for it. I've figured that you can possibly get a ton more kills than any other super because you can roam around and spend super only killing what you want to.
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,minibudd,3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:21 2015 UTC,You can do this as a sunsinger too though.
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,electronCdj,0,Tue Jul 21 18:32:26 2015 UTC,yeah. I understand. I despise bladedancers as being absurdly OP in PvP but their ability to create orbs is just super weak.
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,Cryptographic83,14,Tue Jul 21 13:50:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a PvE man so creating orbs is everything for me. And yeah, I find bladedancers in PvP kind of low skill. Just spam R1 in the direction of an enemy. I feel much better when I get those Razor's Edge doubles and triples."
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,TheSilentUnicorn,5,Tue Jul 21 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"you have obviously not bladedanced against a Ram Warlock, a well timed Felwinter's Snipers, or a team of Thorns.  There is skill in not getting shot/melee'd to death on your way in to wreck someone with a bladedance."

DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,DrNO811,3,Tue Jul 21 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"It's actually very easy to at least trade/kill a bladedancer in PVP.  Just shotgun melee as they are close and almost every time (if your shotgun is high enough impact) you'll trade. Considering you're fighting a super, a trade more than half the time actually makes arc blade kinda week in pvp. The rest of bladedancer (the subclass), QuickDraw, blink, Arcbolt nades, frontstab...all insanely strong"
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,The_Rick_14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:11 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with that. In general using Bladedance isn't that fun in PvP because of the lag. That's me being on the using end.  On the receiving end though it's always a hunter that blinks faster than our aiming speed (especially disorients me when someone uses blink against me) and flying through the air with the melee auto aim.
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,unitater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:28 2015 UTC,I think I replied to the wrong post because I think we agree on all points... ESP the lag. (ugh!) - blink shotgun when executed flawlessly is very difficult to counter if they get the jump(blink) on you. (seewhatididthere) :)

DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,unitater,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"All other supers can generate a max of 8 orbs (9 with a ""produce more orbs"" exotic armor on), but for some reason Arc Blade appears to be half which feels like a bug to me.  If you count your orbs on that video, it stops at 4."
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,meznard,13,Tue Jul 21 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Its because Bladedancer is insanely op in pvp, while the other supers rely on you activating it when the enemy is bunched together, BD (and golden gun to an extent) lets you use the super more than once per activation. Add the fact that they get a strong overshield and replenish helth it would be far to overpowerd if they produced as many orbs as other classes. To pve, it shold produce more, but Bungie seems incapable of buffing/nerfing pve or pvp separatly."
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,minibudd,4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"I don't get this. Make blade dance .5 orbs per kill, or only generate orbs for the first 3/4 of the bar. Golden gun should be one per kill. Or even just cap it at 5.  Pve just let it fly. 8 orbs is the cap anyway."
DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,TheSilentUnicorn,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"Its because its so easy to get kills with Bladedancer, if they gave you the equal amount of orbs as other supers per kill, you would have whole teams of bladedancers with constant supers."

DestinyTheGame,3e26tr,TheRealAozotorp,3,Tue Jul 21 13:39:29 2015 UTC,"From the Bladedancer Subclass:  ""Killing an enemy with Arc Blade extends its duration.""  You saw it in action, when you kill something with arc blade you get your super extended to use more.  However, with arc blade you can do two attacks. Your R1/RB button does a regular melee attack that you see spammed in Crucible. R2/RT however does a special move that you choose within the Bladedancer Subclass:  Showstopper - Press R2/RT during Arc Blade to damage Nearby Enemies. (This is what I used in the video)  Razor's Edge - Press R2/RT during Arc Blade to unleash a destructive wave of energy that travels along the ground.  Vanish - Press R2/RT during Arc Blade to disappear from sight.  Encore only works, giving you super energy, when you kill an enemy with Showstopper or Razor's Edge.  Hope this helps. Hope I gave too much help."

On Venus you will want to go to the area you spawn in for The Nexus Strike. Where there's a crashed Fallen dropship.  On Mars it's in the first area you spawn in for Patrol.

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,RyanMightBeGay,24,Tue Jul 21 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the example shown on the praetorians between the two rocket launchers is pretty telling.    The void ash factory brings the praetorian to about 65% health. Gjallarhorn brings the praetorian to about 40% health before wolfpack rounds even do damage...and that's a solar damage rocket on a void shielded enemy.    edit: apparently some of that initial damage is wolfpack rounds that have exploded early  Granted, ash factory isn't an exotic (I would've liked a comparison with Truth), but I think that still says a lot. Gjally's damage is ludicrous"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,victryros,11,Tue Jul 21 07:28:17 2015 UTC,"Gally does NOT do more damage if you don't consider wolfpack rounds. Every rocket in this game does the same amount of damage, only blast radius matters. What you are seeing there is some of the wolf pack rounds detonating before spreading out.   Just some info you might wanna know :)  Ps: This is why gally will still be the best rocket launcher in the damage compartment after the nerf, even if the wolfpack rounds did 1 damage, it would still outdamage any other rocket launcher (maybe not Dragons breath if it was actually 1 damage, but you know what I mean)"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Warlock_225,3,Tue Jul 21 07:54:42 2015 UTC,The thing about DB is that you can just move out of its damage though... I think for it to be a viable option against a Gjallarhorn it needs to deal more dmg than one. Right now DB deals approximately 80% of Gjallarhorn if all ticks of the Solar Flare hit.  Then there's the issue of DB's abysmal velocity and lack of tracking (I'm not saying to give it tracking). Any rocket without tracking (or G&H) needs to have high velocity to have a chance of hitting your target otherwise you will only ever hit immobile objects.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,WobblyBits_X,9,Tue Jul 21 11:42:39 2015 UTC,"Imagine if there was a subclass that could tie enemies into one spot, the same spot that a dragons breath flare happened to be...   JK dragons breath will probably break the bond and the enemies will still run away..."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Cryptographic83,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:33 2015 UTC,"It would be nice however if DB set its target on fire and the solar chased it around, that would actually make it useful, like the Thorn of rocket launchers.  At least Thorn doesn't leave the poison behind."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,the_obfuscated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"My thought for DB was that it should leave multiple flares, that do MASSIVE damage, since the enemies will just book it anyway.

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DrCrowwPhD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:14 2015 UTC,What if it had the cluster bombs or the mini mirvs that leave a solar flare for each of the bombs?

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Eicr-5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:59 2015 UTC,Will it outdamage hezens vengeance? That has its own sub munition rounds.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Krytan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:06 2015 UTC,"Might still be the best technically, but it does take up an exotic slot and for a heavy weapon to be your exotic it has to be significantly better than the next best legendary option .

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Fildok12,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:01 2015 UTC,"Not all launchers do the same damage depending on if you have cluster bombs, proximity detonation, or neither. Proximity just has blast damage; normal has impact and blast; and cluster has impact, blast, and a little extra from the small explosions. And then there are wolfpack rounds that tear through everything."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,thelegend2558,2,Tue Jul 21 08:38:59 2015 UTC,"Yes that is true. However, I said rocket :)  Each rocket does the same amount of damage. This damage is altered by perks of the launcher that fired said rocket."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Warlock_225,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:48:12 2015 UTC,"Don't know who the hell is downvoting but the crux of what he is saying is correct. The initial impact of a clean shot with any 365 rocket will be the same. Perks such as wolfpack, cluster and mirv can add more dmg later and blast radius can alter the damage of proximity blasts."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DontSackBrian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:15 2015 UTC,"So doesn't this mean that proximity launchers do less damage than gjallahorn, even WITHOUT the wolf pack rounds, because it explodes 'early' without the direct impact?"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Krytan,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:10 2015 UTC,"Rocket Launchers technically do damage at 2 points. A small number if the rocket hits and the blast damage number which is the same for every launcher. (This isn't including extra damage from wolf pack, clusters or mirv)  Gjallahorn has a ""hidden"" proximity perk on it regardless so even without the direct impact number, Gjallahorn will still do the same blast radius damage as every other Grenade and Horseshoe prox launcher."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,That_Black_Kid,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"2 slight things. Ghorn has some innate version of grenades and horseshoes. Never tested if it's unlocked from the beginning, with tracking or at wolfpack but my 365 one definitely has it to some degree. Also as far as I can tell the no affect from horseshoes lowering damage but am at work still so without testing can't be 100%"

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Vacross,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:47 2015 UTC,How would triple tap synergize with white nail? Would you expect it to refill your mag at the cost of two rounds instead of three?
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,NotTheVacuum,28,Tue Jul 21 18:41:26 2015 UTC,white nail would take 2 from the reserve if you hit all 3 instead of 1.  Tripple tap adds free ammo doesn't it?
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Vacross,31,Tue Jul 21 18:51:12 2015 UTC,Don't particularly think they are flexing. Just have someone who has balanced a pvp arena shooter for years not really realising that a earned gun being a little bit too strong in a few niche pve situations is actually a good thing for a loot driven game.  Edit: 'Earned' along with the rest of this post while referring to general principles of where they are heading was with the black hammer in mind. Honestly glad the ghorn is taking a nerf simply because it makes balancing the game hard when certainly  groups can easily do double the damage of others. I love the black hammers design because it is the opposite of the ghorn. Ghorn solves any problem while black hammer is situationally amazing but most of the time only slightly above average.   My first ghorn took 6 months on xbox and was while I had 2 I my inventory before I hit 30 when I made a ps4 account. I know more than most how fickle the RNG can be.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DontSackBrian,10,Tue Jul 21 11:45:16 2015 UTC,"the amount of people out there that equate RNG giving them a Gjallarhorn to ""earning their Gjallarhorn"" is staggering."

The other way to look at it though is that the problem isn't with the gun, it's that people are scared how boring and frustratingly RNG based much of the content will become again without it.

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Starscream918,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:27 2015 UTC,"Surplus could also be seeing a change, as it's purely positive.  However I think that's less likely.  Good point."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Coyoten,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"This really is the best video or explanation I've seen. Blackhammer is complete garbage without the White Nails perk and Bungie will destroy a great weapon by taking that away. Icebreaker's regeneration speed seems good where it is and adding three more seconds per bullet will also make this one trash. G-Horn needs the nerf.  All that said, I completely understand where Bungie is coming from. These weapons in particular are changing how they saw people taking on the raids and other end-game activities. BUT, it doesn't help that all the end game activities can be completed in this fashion with the weapons the way they were originally created. Maybe Bungie needs to change how boss fights happen?"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,lostfanatic6,14,Tue Jul 21 13:55:52 2015 UTC,"Black Hammer is game breaking was a post some time ago. Only the salty dudes who can't find a group to do Crota normal mode or haven't had it drop yet will say that. The rest just use it exactly like it is mentioned in the video and move on with life. It is no way game breaking, it is legendary with 1 decent perk that is useful against a small group of enemies. The same can easily be replaced by Icebreaker. People just don't do it because that takes away the option to use Ghorn or other exotic primary/heavy.  It doesn't shine in PvP (same impact as ES but not good aim assist) or against every boss in PvE either. Against Nexus or Valus, unless you've got unflincing it is really hard to land 3 crits. Useless against Omnigul.  Black Hammer shines against Spider Tank (8 legs, all crits, bad boss design), Cabal tank (4 boosters, all crit), Sepiks Prime (to some degree, giant eyeball, bad design again), Archon Priest (needs some skill, unless you sit on the rock and stun lock him), Phogoth (hard with burn on but stuns him pretty hard), Urroxx (solar burn, easiest boss), Wretched Knight (big pumpkin head, easy target). You can use the Icebreaker against all these bosses and attain same level of success.  It really shines against Kaliks Reborn but that round has the same ""Small Arms"" modifier which debuffs secondary weapons. Against Skolas, i'd much rather use a shotgun to kill those jumping captains/vandals and just primary+rockets on Skolas.  I know this opinion will get down voted but I truly feel Black Hammer shouldn't be nerfed the way it is. Atleast make Mulligan proc more often or replace it with a Tier2 perk.  Edit: It is bad design on Bungie's part, don't blame the weapon that helps you kill a bullet spongy single attack type boss from a distance. and to those saying ""BH users like to sit far off the map and snipe, well duh, it's a fucking sniper. You don't mlg no-scope or get up-close-and-personal against bosses with heavy melee attack Eg: Phogoth, Arkon, Kaliks, Spider tank"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,supandi,46,Tue Jul 21 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"You can use the Icebreaker against all these bosses and attain same level of success.   I was fine up until this part. Black Hammer is vastly superior to Ice Breaker for all of the boss fights you listed outside of maybe Phogoth. And disagree with the ""to some degree"" for Sepiks Prime, since it's the easiest non-Walker boss to effectively use Black Hammer on."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Orochidude,11,Tue Jul 21 08:46:36 2015 UTC,Give it White Nail and Triple Tap =3
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Tom450,9,Tue Jul 21 08:43:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, black hammer is completely fine the way it is. There are a handful of encounters it is useful on. All it does is make a handful of very specific bullet spongy bosses slightly less spongy. That's not game breaking in the slightest."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Krytan,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"White Nail was (is) an Exotic Tier perk. It was not ""decent"". It makes all those encounters you mentioned an absolute joke. It's still going to be great against these kinds of bosses, especially during Solar Burn, but now it won't ruin said boss encounters. I would have really liked it if Bungie had given us the option to upgrade it to an Exotic through the use of a Crux or multiple Exotic Shards (not my idea)."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,FaceAtk,4,Tue Jul 21 04:39:51 2015 UTC,Bosses in this fucking game are already GIGANTIC bullet sponges. Weapons like Black Hammer brought these ridiculously boring and pointlessly drawn out boss fights to a more manageable and sane level.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,StonewallHaxson,3,Tue Jul 21 07:52:31 2015 UTC,"And that is the main problem. The boss template in Destiny. Just bigger model of basic enemy, given huge amounts of hp, 1 hit melee ko, same damage than normal enemies and lots of ads.  The main damage factor normally isn't even the boss, it's the amount of ads."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,sorcerer86pt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:40:30 2015 UTC,"Everybody wants to jump on the ""BH is OP"" train. BH isn't overpowered. The lack of boss mechanics is the problem. As you stated, BH makes bullet sponges easier to deal with because... they just stand there. It has nothing to do with BH being OP. Everybody is overreacting on how OP BH is. Funny thing is, they only bring up targets that just stand there or, as Slayerage put it, has a huge critical spot to ""prove their point"". Which is ironic because most of the bosses these users bring up that state BH makes these bosses too easy are already easy bosses. BH just makes it a little too easy. It has nothing to do with BH, but the boss themselves."

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,AndySaturn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly this post is not true at all. Black hammer is completely viable and trivializes the following bosses: sepkis, nexus, archon, targul (cabal boss), cabal tank, spider tank, taniks, and any major that doesn't have a shield. On top of that, it does it 2 or 3 times faster than icebreaker. White nail is without a doubt an exotic tier perk.   On top of all that, the only thing the nerf is going to go is make it where you can't spam more than 18 bullets before you have to go look for ammo. That's still a ton of shots in a row."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DaddyF4tS4ck,4,Tue Jul 21 05:31:02 2015 UTC,In the video he explains that white nail is the only reason you would use black hammer without it there is no point because you can just use a sniper like efferdeet's spear with faster reload and won't need a headshot to essentially take more rounds from reserve + more in the mag.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,smoak_my_pole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:39:19 2015 UTC,"Except you would no longer have as high prolonged burst, something of which he doesn't discuss in his video. I can still put 18 headshots on a boss without pause."

In that case, yes other snipers would be better for you, but that's a person by person thing and does not ruin it's actual viability. Just because it may require skill to use it to it's best =/= being junk. The new black hammer will be primarily for bosses, not normal enemies."

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Sdwerd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:00:51 2015 UTC,"Why should you be able to use sniper against everything? You can use it on everything, it's just not logical to do so. More over, some weapons should be able to excel in certain situations, not excel in all situations. Do you also want to be able to use shotgun against everything no matter the situation? Your response explains a lot."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DaddyF4tS4ck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:50:44 2015 UTC,"You can use sniper on everything via Queen's bow. I think his point is that Black Hammer already sucks since you save the rounds for bosses that you can get the 3 headshots on repeatedly. Shotguns are actually viable for most content. When I do strikes, I can use a shotgun to one-shot any enemy. There is no shotgun that requires 3 headshots before it's actually being useful. So Black Hammer was gimped the day it was born. And now it's being gimped to the point of a 'joke' weapon like NLB or anything with shank burn."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,vampborn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:38 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of enemies that don't move much, or just peek their heads out from around corners that you can sit there and shoot if you're worried about 1 hitting things. You can still use BH to kill majors, as I've mentioned already. Shotguns barely see use outside of majors (and maybe shield minions) for PvE as it is. They see almost no use on bosses due to every boss have a near 1 hit melee. They are pretty much exclusively saved for killing majors. It's what they excel at. Sure, you could use them to kill minions, but it'd be a waste of time and ammo when you can just kill them in a shot with your primary. The same thing goes for BH. Could you use it to kill minions and be successful? Sure you could. Do you want to use the BH this way? No, it's not the best way to use it, and frankly it takes more time to do then to just use your scout rifle. So snipers are great for dealing high damage to bosses and majors from afar. BH's weakness is that you don't want to waste ammo taking out a major's shield, and you don't want to use it on majors that can't take critical damage. This is normal. There's nothing wrong with the way it's working."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DaddyF4tS4ck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"Obviously you'll save it for ranged attacks, but many yellows will take two shots and die. Well, fuck lost the white nail there. If you spend your whole fuckin' time saving those shots for a boss, I'm going out dps and out kill you every damn time. There's a reason the vast majority of the time I have a huge margin in my favor for kills vs my teammates as well as putting damage on the boss. I'll use whatever I have at my disposal to take everything down as quickly as possible. Black hammer is the only sniper that screws with that partially because when it drops ammo, it drops less, and it's got a pathetic amount to back it up.   If all you plan to do is take a long ass time getting to the boss by saving your precious ammo, then I'll be happy to never have you on any of my fireteams."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Sdwerd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"You just need to land another precision shot after killing a major to proc the ability, but the idea was that BH is a boss killer, not a major killer. A sniper does not have to be able to kill majors frequently, to be viable. People love having weapons with specific uses but don't do so well in other fields. Or if you just have 1 person on your team designated to take down majors, another for minions, other for dealing damage to boss primarily. It helps for making people excel more at one particular position."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DaddyF4tS4ck,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:18 2015 UTC,"That is true but I agree with him that landing 3 crit shots should reward you with ammo. I think it should be exotic with 3 in the mag 6 reserve or legendary with 3 + 3 reserve so you need to land those crits or no reward. With BH you are stuck with the ambush sight is the best the other two aren't worth it, mulligan doesn't work. It is your choice of sniper I would rather go with a better roll of spear with final round or other good perks than bhammer with a instant reload... and mulligan."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,smoak_my_pole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:03 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, but final round no longer is able to be rolled in snipers if I remember correctly, so that option isn't available.

About every 9 shots, a precision hit doesn't register and I reload.   But, about your point, he does discuss the high prolonged burst. He references it by showing the reload speed of Efrideet's. It has a higher fire rate, more in the magazine, and can reload super fast with the right perks. Therefore, you can drop more rounds faster than Black Hammer. The only benefit to BH is the current White Nail perk."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Bullbalz,8,Tue Jul 21 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"While White Nail does glitch, that's not a reason not to nerf it, unless it continues to glitch after nerf. Anyway, Black Hammer will still DPS ever so slightly faster, and doesn't require rezooming in back onto the target.   Also, I'm not so sure as to why everyone is only comparing to Efrideet's. You have a better chance to get Black Hammer, since IB only comes around once a month, and unless it's selling, it's complete random chance to get it. For example, I have not gotten Efrideet's on my account to this day, and I've played a ridiculous amount of IB (only missing 1 week of it, rank 5 on all 3 characters each week other then the week I missed). Meanwhile, I have 3 chances each week to get BH, more if I reroll. It's just not the same. Efrideets isn't something readily available to pick up, or just keep playing crucible/strikes until it drops."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,DaddyF4tS4ck,4,Tue Jul 21 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"What's the point in insta reloading when there are always adds everywhere to throw your aim off? Black hammer is made to be used with a shoot and cover tactic, therefore insta reloading without unlimited ammo is pointless. I rather just use an LDR with field scout+clown cartridge."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Sbrodino,0,Tue Jul 21 11:31:39 2015 UTC,"I think that Black Hammer should just be elevated to Exotic status then, that way, you HAVE to choose if you want to use it or not. On some boss fights, I know people would rather carry in their Gjallarhorn or some other heavy exotic for that massive damage boost, depending on the burn and everything of course.  Also, it can be easy to get precision shots in, but I know several people who are somehow TERRIBLE at doing it. So for them, this gun really becomes useless."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,TheMasterNoob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even if it was exotic I'd still be using it. Just get rid of necrchasm and move black hammer up."

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Arkanian410,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:01:55 2015 UTC,"Going to give my opinion of the 3 guns.   Definitely agree that the g-horn nerf was needed. It just does too much compared to every other rocket (or any gun for that matter) in the game. That means designing encounters you either account for ghorn and make bosses huge bullet sponges....or you don't (which for the most part thats what bungie does) and they die before any mechanics from groups using ghorns and then people doing lfg require others to also have it so they can burn bosses super fast.  The icebreaker nerf...I agree with his sentiment that it really didn't need a nerf and there are plenty of other guns to use instead. I haven't equipped an icebreaker in months and even then it wasn't to use it, it was to do the heavy ammo glitch. However his ""testing"" to prove its low dps is horrible. Why would you ever fire all 6 shots and then just keep icebreaker out waiting for the next shot over and over? You wouldn't. You'd swap to a primary or heavy and shoot a bit, and then by the time you swap back you don't need to reload and you have a couple sniper shots again. Thats the benefit of icebreaker and thats not changing. I feel like Bungie is doing that change to try to push people into not hiding in spots and just sniping bosses to death, but I don't think it'll change anything. The people wanting to do that will still do it, it'll just take them a bit longer.  To the black hammer nerf....I agree with his sentiment that the planned changes will ruin the gun, I disagree that it didn't need changed at all though. It will technically still be the best dps sniper, as you can still do 18 or whatever shots in a row on a boss (where dps is actually important)...but then you are left scrounging around everywhere for special ammo and as he said, all the other perks/scopes on the gun suck. However, 18 shots is still a huge chunk of damage on a boss. For a reference, Skolas when he had a burn took 3 players 22-24 bullets each plus sometimes a few rockets/lmg/primary to finish him off depending on misses. The gun needed a nerf though. It doesn't matter if its hard to hit headshots on dregs and servitors, the gun wasn't good for them anyway. Its all about boss headshots, and for most bosses this gun completely trivialized their fights. Look at his video of the servitor boss. Seriously take a look at how fast he kills the thing (even with the thing healing!) as just ONE person. Its faster than a normal group of 3 could do it if they didn't have ghorn or black hammer. He brings the boss from 50% to dead, by himself, before even needing to bother with the boss mechanic that happens at 50% health (kill the target). You can't tell me thats not OP as hell. It makes designing encounters extremely hard because you have the one group of players using ghorn, black hammer, fatebringer blowing through it and calling it too easy (usually because they burn bosses down fast enough to ignore mechanics) and you have the other group of players using whatever other guns complaining about how long it takes to kill X boss."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,grndmaster20,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:46 2015 UTC,"The way you describe IceBreaker, and it being a good strategy to switch guns while it's reloading is kind of nil. When I use IceBreaker, I want to use a sniper rifle, and shoot as many bullets as fast as I can (usually to take down bosses). I don't want to switch to my inferior primary to wait for more sniper rounds. In cases like the Shadow Theif strike with the indoors Walker robot, the faster you can take it down, the better. You're not going to want to 'wait', or switch guns. If I use my Spear instead, I'll have like 24 bullets instead of 3 or so at a time. I can use 24 bullets from Spear, then use special synth and get 24 more - 48 bullets meanwhile how many bullet will be available in IB? Not even close.  On Black Hammer, it's not like when you shoot at the boss you have noclip and invulnerability. It is faulty AI that you can stand still and fire nonstop without threat. It is the boss mechanics fault, and not the weapon's fault.  You keep mentioned 18 bullets on Black Hammer, but whenever I use that gun I have like 5-6 bullets. And you don't always get 3 headshots in a row. The synths are better off being used on Heavy for Ghallerhorn, but if I wanted a ton of sniper rounds, like I said before I'd use the Spear for 48 bullets rather than trying my ass off to get 3 shots in a row over-and-over."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,vampborn,8,Tue Jul 21 16:15:44 2015 UTC,you just described the reasons why bungie are nerfing the guns lol
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,skippedwords,5,Tue Jul 21 16:35:23 2015 UTC,if they dont take away the ability to just continuously burn down bosses they will need to redesign most of their boss encounters. Doing what they are doing is whats best for the game currently and moving forward.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,skippedwords,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"The point still stands that you would never just sit there with icebreaker out and 0 bullets. You'd switch weapons. So doing a dps comparison of 1 icebreaker round every 8s compared to a primary's dps is still ridiculous. I agree that a spear is better, thats why I haven't equipped an icebreaker in months, I'd rather use a spear or black hammer of even ldr. But this isn't about what we would use and what would be better. Its for the people that DO use icebreaker (which is still a very large number of players) and the point was that nobody just sits there out of ammo and waits for it to regen.  On black hammer the 18 was in reply directly to his video. I dunno why you only have 5-6 bullets, sounds like a user issue to me. The standard is 15 shots, the weapon tuning on it is changing it up to 18 shots. Dunno whats hard to get about it. It will actually be even more assuming you have sniper and/or special ammo perks on your armor, probably about that same 24 rounds you have from a spear.  You don't have to fire with 0 threat, look at his video. The boss moves around, he just can't get directly on top of the player. The player isn't invulnerable, he just has to move a bit or duck back into cover occasionally. And he has no problem at all just doing shot after shot into its crit spot.   You said the bosses don't move and its a boss mechanics fault and then go on to say you can't even get 3 crits in a row...if its not moving, why can't you hit it?  You say synths are better off being used on heavy (for the 1 weapon already discussed as super overpowered) and then keep going on about your 48 spear rounds. So which is it? Are you using special synth or not?  The fact remains that as it stands, black hammer can put out WAY more dps than the best rolled spear. Yes, you have to be getting headshots. Yes, headshots can sometimes be hard to do. But when you can, it just flat out does WAY more damage than they ever intended for a legendary sniper to do. Thats why its getting nerfed."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,grndmaster20,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"a nerf is fine, but they are basically killing it. I barely equipped black hammer as it was, only for 2 or 3 boss fights, and now I doubt I will ever equip it. they went overboard on the nerf. the only advantage now is a very slightly reload speed over any sniper with any generic reload perk. every other perk on the gun is worthless and the scopes are all shitty.  tldr; they went overboard on the nerf and turned it into basically a quickly reloading sniper with no other perk or advantage."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,jtrack473,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"I usually only use IceBreaker in the VOG when killing oracles. When my IB runs out I switch to Vision of Confluence.

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,mattpayne11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with everything here. I fully support everything in the upcoming weapon balancing patch, bar the baffling choices they're making with Icebreaker and Blackhammer.   Now, I understand why an infinite ammo sniper rifle is an issue, but the proposed changes Bungie wishes to make to BH will render it virtually worthless (as Slayerage said), and right now, it's the only gun which is undeniably worthwhile from Crota's End (I say undeniably because the others have good and bad qualities, but BH makes me hard).  Icebreaker is pretty baffling to me. It's not like the ammo regen is that fast as it is. I think Slayerage proposed a half-decent solution by suggesting it have a larger clip to compensate for the longer charge time. If Bungie made that change, I could still live with my Icebreaker. It'd take some tough competition, but it'd still see use.  As for Gjallarhorn, it's still gonna be the best launcher in the game, even after Wolfpack Rounds get nerfed, so whatever, bring it on.  Edit: While we're on the subject, there is one other gun I'm not too happy about. Hawkmoon. I'm an Xbone player, and I feel a little screwed that I'll never be able to appreciate this gun in all it's original majestic glory. But even beside that, the removal of the triple-proc shot seems kinda stupid to me. Once again, it's one of the main reasons people use this gun, but the difference with this is that the triple-proc shot is such a fucking rarity, people makes reddit posts devoted just to having it trigger. By all means, have Hawkmoon be affected by the upcoming changes to Handcannons, but leave it's triple-proc in tact. It's a rather apt analogy to Destiny's RNG system anyway: sometimes, really fucking rarely, you get super-lucky and the game gifts you exactly what you want, but most of the time, you don't get it and the game bends you over and fucks you."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,NorseFenrir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with your opinion on the random Hawkmoon nerf... why? It is literally approx. 1 in 2000 shots, and that shot also has to connect just right... its literally like stars aligning. I've used Hawkmoon for thousands upon thousands of Crucible kills, and seen a triple proc exactly twice.  Its one of the things that was truly unique and so incredibly rare when it occurred it always made your day, hell even week.... I would rave about it for days afterwards.  Makes me sad, a few people got salty due to incredibly rare one-off situations and now the gun is lost one the key reasons it was truly unique..."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Goose306,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:17 2015 UTC,"I think it might be to do with the reduced mag size. Each shot less increases the odds by a huge amount, depending on the harshness of the nerf."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,APhanpy,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"No Hawkmoon will be keeping approximately the same clip size post-nerf. Patch notes said it would gain a few rounds in the clip once Holding Aces is unlocked (probably from the new ""high"" of 10 back to 13) otherwise it would require rebalancing the whole gun setup as you would get procs way too often.  This, according the the dev, was all due to perception of the ability to one-shot. Again, a bullshit reason to nerf a gun with such an extremely rare ability. If they don't want one-shot primaries, da fuq is NLB? UR?"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Goose306,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"Even if the stars align, you shouldn't be getting one shotted by any primary."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,ChainedBahamut,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:45 2015 UTC,What about UR/NLB?
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Goose306,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:59 2015 UTC,The Hawkmoon is going to have its full glory. They are hardly touching it apart from triple proc (which is not why the gun is top tier in PvP) and they're keeping it's magazine size the same. It will be the hand cannon that survives this patch the best.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,SeniorOtter,2,Tue Jul 21 10:41:15 2015 UTC,"Another nerf to an exotic that I think they should take another look at s TLW. The hand cannon nerf to that gun will take it's total round count to 6 (maybe 7?). Anyone that's a TLW user knows that its only downfall is how many bullets it shoots out and the reload time, so having a lot less will ruin the gun. I mean obviously it needs the nerf heavily but at this rate it'll be the new Suros :/"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,ToBeReverenced,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"Also with Icebreaker, Invective regenerates 1 bullet every 5 seconds (actually 4 every 20) and can pick up ammo, and you don't lose all your ammo on death."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,LOrdStilton07,3,Tue Jul 21 09:43:57 2015 UTC,I've been saying for ages blackhammer should have been an exotic. The perk is so OP to stack on gally in a boss fight. The 3 points made are exactly what they need to address before dropping the 2.0.0 rebalance.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,akni23,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:37 2015 UTC,I'm afraid I agree completely
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Whisky2770,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:48 2015 UTC,They should make a new exotic called White Hammer with the infinite ammo that BH currently has  hopefully people wont assume it's a skinhead gang though

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,thefinalcure,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with him. People act like everybody is an aimbot with Black Hammer. With the exception of the Tanks (Walker and Cabal's) and huge stupid crit spot bosses, it's hard to land precision shots... BH only has it's huge impact and white nail.... aside from that, it has horrible stability, recoil and ROF. I've been lefting it aside lately, because it got old, and others like LDR and reforgable weapons are so much more fun to use and handle.  Let black hammer as it is IMO... and for the love of god, don't break the IceBreaker"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,bebepalmito,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:46 2015 UTC,this just sounds whiny in regards to blackhammer. The rest of the video seems solid though
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,lundibix,4,Tue Jul 21 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"Having been a long time MMO player I've learned to try to see the intent behind changes, not just the end effect. And I can tell you with total certainty, that the intent behind both the black hammer and icebreaker changes is the same; No more unlimited damage output.  Sniper rifles tend to have fairly small reserve ammo pools. This is on purpose, as sniper damage is high, and precise. The problem that arrises when you have weapons with effectively infinite ammo like black hammer is that it trivializes encounters. Fallen Walker? Dead in less than a minute thanks to unlimited sniper ammo. Same for Cabal tank. Same for several bosses. All due to one weapon.   Bungie has pretty clearly demonstrated as time goes on that they don't want us ignoring mechanics, cheesing fights, and generally earning rewards with little to no actual effort involved. Of course, it's ultimately their responsibility, because they gave us the tools in the first place. Which is why the change has been subtle. Prison of Elders has pretty clearly shown they're learning how to use mechanics to influence our behavior. I was much more surprised that black hammer went live with a perk that good, than I am now that it's getting nerfed.   Ultimately there should never be one answer to ""what weapon should I use in this slot"", and THAT is why these nerfs are happening."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Kaiju_Blue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:56 2015 UTC,Yes.  People are constantly forgetting that there is a new raid coming out mere weeks after 2.0 hits.  To not see these nerfs as anticipation of that raid and potential cheese-ability is just being ignorant.
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,th3groveman,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"Just watched it,makes me feel sad to see him pour his heart out so bungie doesn't nerf his favorite weapon"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Froloswaggin,3,Tue Jul 21 04:27:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem. I like this video, I do. But as a former dev, here is a small problem to consider from Bungie's end.   They have probably had weapon balancing being worked on for quite some time now. They are also working on Taken King at the same time. Which means in their test builds, they are most likely using the updated weapon balancing builds in in, keep the builds inclusive of all the changes. Which means they are probably balancing upcoming boss encounters against their current weapons.   All of this means that they probably already have made everything they needed to and this is just polishing and bug squashing stage for most of the teams at Bungie. So a very small live team is probably reading these problems the community has with the weapon balancing patch.   So do not be surprised if 2.0 launches with exactly with what the preview said. Maybe a 2.0.1 patch will address some of this, but they are getting close to launch, and when you mess with something, a while lot of other something's can break. I doubt they will risk that.   I may be wrong, Bungie may have future proofed themselves and specifically kept the build open for community feedback. But, I am just giving a fair warning,"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,knightsmarian,3,Tue Jul 21 06:18:09 2015 UTC,"just my opinion and not fact but I would stab a guess that Bungies new end game content / raid can be broken or certainly made easier with the GH/BH/IB and that is why they have chosen to nerf those weapons instead of improving the encounters & mechanics.   I mean lets face it, the community/player-base has not been complaining about any of these weapons yet Bungie are pulling them back - it must be related to the new raid.  I feel that participating/completing end game content & earning these rewards should help your guardians become stronger & better equipped for additional/follow up end game content"
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,BANDiT1210,3,Tue Jul 21 07:26:28 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you, these 3 weapons all have the same main characteristic of dealing huge damage very quickly (3 best boss killers in the game)... for all 3 of them to be getting major nerfs just prior to the TK is not a coincidence!!"

I think Bandit1210 is right on the money on this one, expect slow/non moving bullet sponge targets as bosses.  What i suggest is Bungie to go play example WoW vanilla Molten Core bosses and steal every fucking idea from there. Blizzard used quite simple mechanics back then and those could work so fucking nicely in game like Destiny. Put a BOMB on a random group memember. If he doesnt move from the party, he will kill everyone. At random intervals, make it so that people have to stand on 4 platforms or whipe.  Those are GAME MECHANICs, giving boss 8M HP isnt."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Pe-Te_FIN,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:57 2015 UTC,"I think they only problem here is their fireteam system. Teams have 3 people and a lot of people in this game expect to be able to solo strikes (cuz anti social n stuff). If you add actual mechanics then you create a minimum # of players per strike. If you make it purely solo-able then its basically still a bullet sponge. Maybe every couple minutes you have to run somewhere but essentially you're just putting a lot of bullets in a big target.  Edit: Didn't play WoW but have played other MMOs. There are some ""zones"" that were soloable but most were completely unsoloable and at minimum you needed 2 (a healer and something)."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,MrNegativity1346,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:57 2015 UTC,"I do wonder if they saw the first people taking down Skolas in 40 seconds thanks to Gjallarhorn, and they threw a fit because they  didn't expect that to happen.  This time, they're expecting that..."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,AzarinIsard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:16:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm surprised that they didn't nerf Gjallarhorn much sooner, back in Vanilla Destiny, especially after people began to see what it could do to Atheon. They've had numerous opportunities to do so since, and I think it says a lot that they've waited an entire year to do so. I kinda do think that the toxic elitism that the weapon began to produce was a major factor in the nerf.  Honestly, think they made things harder on themselves by not doing it back when many people didn't have it or didn't have such an attachment to the gun as people began to later on, and most certainly right now. There may have been some complaints, but it wouldn't have been near as much of an outrage as there was/is now."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Orochidude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:09:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, back when that world record Atheon kill in 17 seconds with 5 gjallerhorns in the first month the VoG was out?

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,minibudd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:39 2015 UTC,"Xur not having it in his inventory is just weird. Makes me wonder if they planned it to be crazy powerful, and Xur selling it early was a boon for early players. Or if they saw it was so powerful after Xur sold it, and removed it from Xur's inventory so it never turns up until after they've worked out how to fix it, in the hopes it stops the problem proliferating. Which would mean only those players stuck without a G-horn have been experiencing the game as intended."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,AzarinIsard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"Well, either nerf Gjallarhorn or buff other launchers. Personally, ever since launch I've felt rockets were lacklustre. And as Slayerage points out, a regular void launcher takes down the shield / some health of a L26 yellow bar Praetorian. Or, Gjallarhorn kills it... Considering how many yellow bars there are in some situations, there's not a huge step up from special to heavy. I guess it's intended, but I just figure that if either weapons were more powerful, or enemies were weaker, we'd have more epic battles. Putting it into entirely arbitrary numbers, I'd much rather kill 3 enemies who have 100 health, than 1 which has 300 health. It's just more fun to take on a gang.  And honestly, I thought Gjallarhorn's cult status made it impossible for Bungie to fix before the sequel, but I guessed wrong. My gut was on them working on a TTK boss which has some sort of counter measure mechanic against launchers. Make Gjallarhorn useless in a certain situation (sort of like how Black Hammer is useless against Wizards unless you're a MLG pro) without making people hate you for making their stuff worse."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,AzarinIsard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:57 2015 UTC,I can see a bunch of sandbox designers with faction tee shirts throwing a hissy fit because someone found a more efficient and quick way to best their bullet sponge boss.

Once other stuff kicked in, they considered it a wipe similar to an enrage, lol."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,AzarinIsard,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"They released skolas with solar burn and didn't expect 3-gjalla burns ? After all the 10-sec nightfall bosses burns, atheon etc ? I really hope they were wiser than that !!!"

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,knightsmarian,3,Tue Jul 21 12:11:00 2015 UTC,"think you're 100% right that they are making these nerfs because the new shit they have coming is easily broken by these old weapons.   which is a REALLY bad sign to me, it points to the fact that they still aren't designing challenging content in the right way."

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Flatline334,4,Tue Jul 21 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"today is july 21st, so i'm guessing they still have at least 3 weeks before they start cutting RTX/release builds. The TTK part is digital distro only so there's no manufacturing lead-in time necessary."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Chippy569,3,Tue Jul 21 13:49:00 2015 UTC,"Good point, but games are such huge interconnected peices that changing one thing can have negative effects. Not only that but then you have to test everything again. Change black hammer, run through all the high end content again to find instances of abuse. Decide to not nerf Gjallahorn qnd what does tgat mean for Raid encounters? Its the butterfly effect.   I have no doubt that they are still doing polish on a lot of it on an internal build, for IUO, but these builds are very different than demo ones. In the past, we pulled demo builds for events that were 3 or 4 months old that the IUO build was miles ahead. So time really means nothing once you get close enough to a release point. Especially for online distro only. The only thing you have to do is package it, set the handles and upload it to the distro servers."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,knightsmarian,3,Tue Jul 21 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"Always amazes me how many people working in games are also here in dtg :P our demos are also always pretty old (though carefully tailored for the target audience as bungies E3 demo no doubt was) but I'm guessing (hoping) by this point the waterfall effects of weapon balance have been well-identified. It'll never be no work, but by now I'd hope its predictable work.   Either way though, I'd expect by now that the rebalance notes represent something quite close to final, and that those changes have been fairly thoroughly tested - and tested against the goals for each weapon/class they described in the post."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Chippy569,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'll show you mine if you show me yours ;)   Full agreement on everything. But, yeah. I suspect the preview will be pretty much to the T of what 2.0 has to offer except they will flush out how much they are increasing and decreasing certain values."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,knightsmarian,4,Tue Jul 21 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"I like slayerage's videos and have always agreed in the past with him, and it seems throughout this weapon rebalance that remains a fact, except for the black hammer. The thing slayerage points out is that he is comparing black hammer to guns that are not widely available, let alone exist anymore. The points he makes are valid for an MLG360NOSCOPE player like him who has perfect reload canceling and every weapon with perfect roles because he knew they'd be OP before they were OP.  As it stands for the typical (even the EXCELLENT) destiny players right now, black hammer is a one trick pony. It's perk is unusable in all scenarios except for big sepiks-type bosses. Its only the best choice in that scenario, where it is the best choice because it's so mindless and OP. Now I would propose a compromise where mulligan works more often or is replaced with shoot to loot or something. The increased ammo should also bring black hammer up to 6 ammo a drop, which is decent, but could be better.  I don't see why no one else is coming to the conclusion that the icebreaker nerf is happening because people don't use icebreaker unless they need infinite ammo to cheese something (and it isn't bad in PVP). The icebreaker is taking a nerf as a scapegoat to the problem with people cheesing everything with it. Unfortunate fix, shouldn't have happened that way."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Beezneezman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with removing that one trick is that now the Black Hammer is going to be much less used. It would be much better to reduce its reserve ammo as Slayerage said, punishing missed shots more."

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,berntford,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:01:34 2015 UTC,My only thought is that they might be adding content which gets seriously broken by the IB and BH so they nerfed them into oblivion. I don't know but going to give them the benefit of the doubt for now
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,GiantFish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:31 2015 UTC,I think Bungie got pissed that people could solo everything in their game so they decided to make it significantly harder/time consuming with the Icebreaker nerf.  IB was an integral tool for soloing nightfalls (at least back in the day) and very useful for cheesing the bridge from up top during CE and I think that irked them...
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,McRon_i,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:25:09 2015 UTC,"I said the exact same thing, and I kind of stick by it. Not that I really disagree with the comments made in the video, and Im a little sad about it too, but I don't want to jump to conclusions.  The point raised in the video is a good one, myself I have a Efrideets Spear in every burn, and 2 have surplus, and another LDR in the other burn has surplus.  So a high impact sniper with surplus for every occasion. If special ammo is readily available, I will be able to out DPS IB & BH after with them.  So, the nerf appears heavy handed in this sense.  Is it to protect upcoming bosses, raid & strikes, that have far less HP and perhaps more interesting mechanics? We will see I guess.  It appears they had to castrate two of the most loved weapons to be comfortable with this new content, if thats the case."
DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Classic_Griswald,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:52 2015 UTC,"So...more bosses/enemies that just stand there and take your hits? BH and IB are awesome, but the reason why they're so awesome is because they can wreck most of the bosses in this game. Reason being? Because all their bosses are just ""shoot em up until they die"". If they had certain mechanics for certain bosses, like activating certain things, like shooting explosive environmental things, throughout the fight to do damage instead of firing at the boss directly. (somewhat bad example, but it takes away the need for Black Hammer)"

They have admitted some of the mistakes they've made in the past, plus the preview clips for TK shows some kind of mechanics previously unseen in strikes and whatnot, or different at least. Maybe thats part of why they are nerfing the higher DPS weapons.  Thats my guess. Might be totally wrong. Or maybe they have a vision for what the new meta should be PvE & PvP wise, and they don't see a couple guns in it the same way. if the game changes for the better, its not necessarily a bad thing.  At one time, if you told people they'd be using hand canons every PvP match they'd thought you loopy. But then the same would be pissed when they got the news on the HC nerfs....  Things change."

DestinyTheGame,3e0e9d,Landosystem,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"There are some shots from a strike, where different objectives need to be done while ads & the boss enter to room, or to damage them or something.  Beyond that, the comments made by the design teams in various interviews about the raids & strikes.  If the enemies behave differently, whether its ""reskinned backwards enemies"" they are still different. Not sure how they can win, if they had an entirely different enemy, it wouldn't make sense, but they have taken [pun intended] all the enemies in the game and given them reasons to be completely different.  Not sure about most games, but how many do that in the first year, or you just keep fighting more of the same stuff. I think its actually not a bad variation."

I assume that you are saying its worthwhile to just put on the ether seed and black wax to get more glimmer while running the NF for the week. The 'farm' in the title would suggest that you are saying people should go do this repeatedly which would actually be a fairly awful way to 'farm' considering the time investment for just 1K glimmer.   Otherwise, its always worthwhile to pop whatever consumable applies to the adds of the week for the NFs.

I never farm the Exclusion Zone, and I always pop a Polyphage before going into the Gatekeeper checkpoint, but never really farm it for Glimmer.   Thing is, it's quite boring to just kill the same enemies over and over again. That doesn't seem like fun to me, so I find other ways. Nightfall is one of them, since there's actually some variety. The Vanguard playlist is another, where I pop the consumables of enemies I would likely encounter. I would only use the Exclusion Zone if I was desperate for Glimmer and out of Ascendant/Radiant Shards.   Point being, there are people out there that just don't find farming fun, me being one of them. It might be efficient, but it sure as hell isn't good for my entertainment."

DestinyTheGame,3e274w,ImmortaIWombat,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:10 2015 UTC,You can get 3000 every 10 mins from the warmind farm on earth. I usually max my glimmer in an hour from doing this. Also a ton of engrams and consumables drop so u can get weapon parts and more glimmer from that stuff.

DestinyTheGame,3e33r0,Saint-15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"I would say that forshadows the darkness as an entity in one of two ways.   The traveler appears good but has a dark mirror... or a dark side. This plays into the traveler being evil and either tried to destroy humanity or was manipulating it. This theory places the warmind as the protagonist, I believe. The traveler is a great being of light that came from elsewhere but has been running from a dark being, probably from the same place of origin. This probably plays on the dichotomy of light vs. dark. This theory would likely entail us bringing the traveler back to full strength then waging a war against the dark being, that would likely show up close to the end of the ultimate story.    That's my two cents at least and definitely one of the biggest quotes Xur has, in my opinion."

DestinyTheGame,3e3cxn,krisbaird,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"I've got a ton of resupply codes/ether seeds/etc. I always use them, even if it's not for farming glimmer. Any and all green weapons get saved. When I go to turn in bounties, I equip them and level them up. That will net you 3 minimum, with a max of 5 weapon parts.  In addition to greens that have dropped, I'll buy green weapon engrams from the Cryptarch - 580 glimmer a piece, a better price than the Gunsmith at 800/930 glimmer. I try to turn in bounties when I have one green each of primary/secondary/heavy. Just doing that will net you 30-40 weapon parts a day without any farming - and that's on one character. You aren't really doing any extra ""work"" outside of playing the game like you normally would, which is nice.  Don't mess around with blues or purples. The return in weapon parts isn't worth leveling them up - when I get them, I just dismantle them right away."

DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,GameSpawn,17,Tue Jul 21 01:44:39 2015 UTC,on the back of the ice breaker there are six lights indicating the mag size. Also when zoomed in there a six lights at the top saying the mag size.
DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,mightyzombie,6,Tue Jul 21 01:47:26 2015 UTC,"It could be increased in multiples of 6 so each light is still relevant. Considering the (soon) long charge time they could up the mag/total shots to 12 (2 shots per light).  It was a stupid change as IceBreaker needed 0 nerfing. It was just fine because it had the 6 shot limit, decent charge time, and special ammo packs did nothing yet generate like mad when IceBreaker is equipped - it was already balanced with Pros and Cons (AND the recharge rate was still enough to NOT break PvP). IceBreaker is now just Cons - the only Pro (infinite ammo) is pointless because you can burn all 6 shots in seconds and have to wait minutes to get them back (for 10-15 minute Strikes this makes IceBreaker effectively useless)."
DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,StealthPimp133,4,Tue Jul 21 02:36:25 2015 UTC,"you can burn all 6 shots in seconds and have to wait minutes to get them back   6 rounds at 8 seconds each is 48 seconds.

If you have been around since CE, you should remember the endless posts about how the Crux didn't drop for anyone, husk of the pit RNG, auto rifles sucking, shotguns being awesome (for 3 seconds before they begin to dominate in pvp) how all the cheeses have been patched and people only want to camp to kill the boss, and multiple character grind to level 5 IB sucks.  If you've been around since HoW, which lets be honest is pretty new for a Destiny player, you should remember  how badly we wanted special ammo reduced, how much we wanted an auto rifle buff, how much we hated final round, how much we hated the DoT of thorn and the glitch zoom bug with TLW, the insane range of shotguns, the giant blast radius from Grenades and Horshoes, and the eliteism from LFG groups.

On a 6 round mag I end up firing about 7-8 shots before I'm really ""out"" due to the ammo regen.  Doubling the mag I can see getting  an extra 3 shots in the mag by the time you run dry.

DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,ZEBRAKAKEZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:54 2015 UTC,That would be interesting. Or maybe a duel mag where one battery recharges faster then the other. Say one at 6 seconds and one at 10 seconds? Not sure if that would work with Ice Breaker but its a good thought.

DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,JC_D3NT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt mind if they just made it similar to Invective where you can still pick up special ammo packs along with the recharging ammo. This would still force people to leave their safe spots for some more ammo, but would make the gun still a bit more viable, especially if they up the magazine a bit.  Maybe make it so that you can only recharge 6 bullets but can pick up up to 10 or 12? I think that would still accomplish what bungie is trying to do in stopping people from hiding, but still keep the gun comparable to other snipers in DPS."
DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,AndrewFlash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:22 2015 UTC,Isn't this method used for invective?  Long recharge time but you can also pick up ammo?  Should be simple enough to implement.

DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,XaTTaX,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:28:43 2015 UTC,A round straight to the magazine for each pack would be best. If there are two pack near by then thats two instant shots and the rest you wait for. If there are six near by then thats a full clip ready to go.
DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,Th3Jez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"I made a comment to similar effect last week - the Hunter already has a perk triggered off of picking up ammo (Scavenger), so that bit is already possible. The part I don't know about is whether the game currently supports dynamically setting the recharge rate; if that had to be engineered, it would cause delays because it would trigger much more extensive testing (you know, if they even decided to do this)."
DestinyTheGame,3dzxep,duality_complex_,0,Tue Jul 21 17:57:41 2015 UTC,vanguard quartermaster sells a shoot to loot sniper rifle. snipers shouldn't have to move around. the entire nerf is idiotic and a waste of time for some of us who don't have a lot of time.

I understand the time commitment the raids take, and cheesing will still be doable, but I think this has to do with the exclusion of those without it in lfg communities and they want to see different strategies arise in the raids without needing Ice Breaker."

DestinyTheGame,3e345z,Shivajichandran,6,Tue Jul 21 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"I believe that when Eris says she has become more like the speaker, she is referring not to being corrupted by the darkness but rather being cryptic in what shes says and tells other. Rather than be upfront and forthcoming."
DestinyTheGame,3e345z,Protoman12,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with this opinion. I think Ikora being so direct with Eris made Eris realize that she was probably about to drop a riddle as the answer to Ikora's question, hence the ""Heh,"" and this realization prompted the comparison to the Speaker."
DestinyTheGame,3e345z,TheSunsetYoshi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:04 2015 UTC,"Precisely. The context of the conversation, I believe, ultimately lends it self to this theory."
DestinyTheGame,3e345z,Protoman12,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"I personally don't believe the Speaker isn't as bad as everyone seems to think. True, he is supposedly somewhere at the top in who says what happens where and when, however, he seems to be more along the lines of the Priest more than anything. He offers guidance, gives the occasional speech and has a connection to the Traveler and the Ghosts. This is akin to the Servitors and the Archon Priests within the Fallen, as it really seems like Servitors were created in the likeliness of the ""Great Machine"". As usual, someone doesn't always have all the answers, which may be why his words are so cryptic. Instead of giving flat out yes and no answers, or even a bit of info to hint towards direct answers, he seems to speak with a more of a ""Search for yourself and you may find the answers you want"" although that may not always be the case.  There are many truths that won't be revealed, definitely not by the Speaker, but he probably does it to protect Guardians from knowing too much. This may stem from the falling out Osiris and he had long ago. Many of the text from Trials armor and items clearly suggest they were Master and Apprentice, and with us knowing that Osiris was hungry for answers pertaining to many things, the Speaker has to do what he must to maintain order and prevent would could be seen a mass hysteria.  In the same Grimoire you mentioned above (Osiris) it read:   Hunters chose to pursue your visions instead of protecting refugees, Titans assembled teams to chase the legendary Vault of Glass instead of striking the Fallen, and Warlocks turned away from the study of the Traveler in favor of your ultimate obsession... learning the exact nature of the Darkness.   If we had Guardians that no longer cared about the Traveler and became more interested in expanding the research of the Darkness and possibly getting lost out there in the wild during their chase for knowledge, wouldn't it bring the Tower into a sort of chaotic state? With the bigger factions (Dead Orbit, FWC, New Monarchy) trying to vie for higher standings, this would certainly prove to make the Speaker's, as well as the Vanguard's position, at jeopardy. With this, the Speaker does his best to not give answers, and in turn, provides more questions for us to ask, however, we grow tired of asking questions and not getting those answers, so we let him be. He is trying to avoid another Osiris rising up and creating a similar situation as in the past.  I don't think it has anything to do with the Speaker being corrupt, or the sort. Its just him trying to protect his role and where he stands within the Tower and The Last City. His goal is always to restore the Traveler, and to do that, he has to unite as many people as he can to that cause. Guardians fighting back against the Darkness is part of that. Allowing us to dismiss that cause and searching for other answers and chasing ideas and notions that don't pertain directly to the Traveler, are obviously not. True, everyone could benefit more from seeking those answers, but as stated, it doesn't put the Traveler first."

Maybe not directly, but ""Music of the Spheres"" was a philosophy movement around his time, and he included it in many of his poems. It had to do with movements of the planets and sun as ""music.""

Yet even a singing patch of sky can be observed, and transformed into a range of frequencies.  Can you hear it? No, not yet. It has not yet arrived. But together we can receive its call.  Imagine combining the observations of thousands across the globe on an object meandering through the heavens. The resulting array would be quite large. Quite powerful. This is your task.  Alone it will not be enough. Coordination and timing is needed. Observations must be made simultaneously.  Your window will be small. Five minutes at most. But windows may be reopened. And the distance between observer pairs will be key.  There will always be limitations in clarity, so the results must be archived for study. Highly technical observers may be required. Detailed frequency analysis is recommended.  Everything that belongs to us will be ours, but only if we create the capacity to receive it.  Think not of locations, but the spacings between, as seen from each target. While one hemisphere provides a strong center, the other must heed the call in order to bring light to the unknown."

In the very first match the third member gets booted and this guy doesn't even care. He says follow me and we proceed to steam roll the other team 5-1 going 2v3.

If the other team is using blink/shotgun to rush you need to back off like you did. Your two teammates cost you that round.

IF it was a consumer customer, of course I would try to do some retention, but you cannot please everyone.  Is not a matter on Bungie caring, is matter on ME as individual taking action, IS my money, my time, and once the consumers start seeing things this way, the companies will have to think twice.

DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,DoctorRotor,292,Mon Jul 20 12:22:18 2015 UTC,"""So I've had mine leveled up (though didn't waste energy on it yet) and I was thinking about the incoming buff after playing around with it the other day.  The gun isn't good for high level PvE content, but it's DoT is a ridiculous perk in PvP. In fact as a user of it and someone who's also been killed with it (sorta rare not many people seen to know it's good in pvp once leveled) DoT on a gun is the most broken perk in PvP. lt's effect is much greater and way less skill oriented than red death, suros etc and their health/damage perks. I'm worried that since the only major drawbacks are clip size/reload, if they buff those plus more, this gun is going to become an insane powerhouse in PvP.  This gun in PvP is a really an odd combo due to the fact it takes some skill (it's a HC) but also none to get kills.  I feel this is a legit concern and also a great reason why there needs to be separate figures for PvE and PvP.  I really hope they took PvP into major consideration when buffing Thorn, because even pre-buff it's a good weapon in PvP thanks to DoT. I could easily see post buff a lot of people dominating/using Thorn in PvP if they don't handle it perfectly (again only due to current DoT and the way PvP is handled armor/health wise).  Oh and you know they are probably going to screw this up then nerf it again. Just funny because they killed the Vex period (much better PvP guns and it's useless in PvE) but they've left Suros OP even though they acknowledged it's to OP in PvP."""

So I've had mine leveled up (though didn't waste energy on it yet) and I was thinking about the incoming buff after playing around with it the other day.  The gun isn't good for high level PvE content, but it's DoT is a ridiculous perk in PvP. In fact as a user of it and someone who's also been killed with it (sorta rare not many people seen to know it's good in pvp once leveled) DoT on a gun is the most broken perk in PvP. lt's effect is much greater and way less skill oriented than red death, suros etc and their health/damage perks. I'm worried that since the only major drawbacks are clip size/reload, if they buff those plus more, this gun is going to become an insane powerhouse in PvP.  This gun in PvP is a really an odd combo due to the fact it takes some skill (it's a HC) but also none to get kills.  I feel this is a legit concern and also a great reason why there needs to be separate figures for PvE and PvP.  I really hope they took PvP into major consideration when buffing Thorn, because even pre-buff it's a good weapon in PvP thanks to DoT. I could easily see post buff a lot of people dominating/using Thorn in PvP if they don't handle it perfectly (again only due to current DoT and the way PvP is handled armor/health wise).  Oh and you know they are probably going to screw this up then nerf it again. Just funny because they killed the Vex period (much better PvP guns and it's useless in PvE) but they've left Suros OP even though they acknowledged it's to OP in PvP.   Edit: who the fuck would downvote this? This is literally the post from the bungie forum, as the man requested."

DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,EnderFenrir,7,Mon Jul 20 16:23:16 2015 UTC,"This also brings up a good point. Why cant the pvp and pve sandboxes be different? This would make far more sense, so what if your gun behaves a little different in each, it would allow for far greater possibilities and be easier to manage. Bam you lock in the pve stats and that's what those are minus the tweaks when gamebreakers are found. Then separately you can tweak the pvp as needed. Yes it would require a lot of work up front but I think it would be easier on them in the long run and far better on us in general."

Anyways for those wondering, the point was damage over time on a hit scan gun is basically game breaking in PvP when it's the only gun with it and the gun itself is very good even without that perk.  Unlike a grenade or melee, you can trigger DOT basically non-stop with basically no skill.  Also since some seemed to have been confused, I never said Suros required more skill or wasn't OP back then (in fact I actually state it was and that Bungie even acknowledged such). I said Thorn's perk required less skill and has a greater effect than Red Death's, Suros, etc in PvP.  Thorn basically became Hawkmoon with DOT instead of two extra bonus damage bullets.  Anyways, thanks for the shout-out. I even had a few reach out to me via PM's on the Bungie forum to let me know.

The only weapon class that is somewhat balanced between both is Shotguns which are getting nerfed in PvE after just getting buffed.  I don't know how much the testers play the game but they should release the updated weapon buffs and nerfs to select people that have over a month of gameplay and have them test it in game.  It always baffles me how the people that made the game only find out about glitches after the player base begins to exploit it."

Considering the nightmarish (at the time) ordeal you had to complete to acquire it, the weapon was a steaming pile in PvE. Tiny mag size, ages to reload, inaccurate, less impact than pretty much every legendary HC available at the time. Nothing about it justified it as an exotic weapon."

DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,BronocchioLyingBro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:49:00 2015 UTC,i got so many exotic bounty's in the first weeks. was crazy now i dont get them mostly because i dont do the pve bounty's.
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,DarthTelly,2,Mon Jul 20 15:19:30 2015 UTC,Wait was it always a 2shot kill? Or was impact boosted too? If it was always a 2shot kill idk how they managed to buff it so much in pvp.
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,HOW_Info,3,Mon Jul 20 15:17:45 2015 UTC,It has always been a 2 shot kill.
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,BronocchioLyingBro,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:19 2015 UTC,That is a good question I never used aggressive ballistics I always used to max the stability (cause originally the base stability was shit). I think it might have been a two headshot kill but because the stability was so low on the original it made it very difficult to do it consistently. It really encouraged you to play a peek-a-boo style of play and be really accurate with your headshots. If you missed too much you were faced with that god awful reload time
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,HOW_Info,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:41 2015 UTC,That sounds balanced lol. Shoulda just left it alone and given it 2X damage in PVE or something. (or replace 2X with whatever would be more balanced)
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,Sharkhug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:25 2015 UTC,That is the argument a lot of us were having at the time. It was completely balanced  in pvp but really crap in pve. The issue was that people who were general pve players but liked to collect exotics were disappointed with it. Bungie just wanted to make people happy so they buffed it and we got the OP Thorn.
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,BronocchioLyingBro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"It was always a 2 shot kill. It had slower rate of fire, 6 round mag, and horrendous reload speed.

Then they improved it's reload, rate of fire, and mag to 9 for no reason at all and it became the beast we know in crucible today."

DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,Scubawookie,7,Mon Jul 20 15:20:03 2015 UTC,"Im with the above guy I had Thorn since first week in October and it was good and took skill. My problem has been they buffed the target acquisition and handling so now, currently, everyone can use it. Bungie essentially made an exotic gun a common gun because of it. Sure, its July almost year 2 we should expect at least all the launch players to have Thorn by now, but you would've never legit guess it'd be used so atrociously.  -avid Thorn and HC user"
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,HOW_Info,3,Mon Jul 20 13:48:45 2015 UTC,Its been badass from the beginning. I also got it week two and its been my go to gun. I adore it! I am interested to see this stacking burn though... It may be better. Haha no. It wont be. There’s nothing better than taking your time. Two headshots and done.
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,small_law,2,Mon Jul 20 12:40:44 2015 UTC,You had to carefully pace your shots because the stability was bad but when you got used to it you could take people out easily. I agree the reload speed was so bad it made me move on to other weapons. It wasn't nearly as easy to use as Suros.
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,jonnythejew,2,Mon Jul 20 12:45:30 2015 UTC,"Thorn is still more effective if you pace your shots and try to aim for the head rather than spam it for body shots. That's the whole trick to it, treat it like Hawkmoon."
DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,Sevencron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"That was the point. I got Thorn maybe the 4th week of playing and I loved it. I mean, it shoots massive fucking thorns, I think it made sense that the range, reload, stability, and mag size were lower. Besides, it made the gun require a little more planning and skill, as you had to plan your shots and reloads well or else you'd be stuck reloading for five minutes in the middle of battle. OG Thorn was slow but deadly, and honestly that's just the way I think it should be. If the weapon has no downfalls then there is only reward in using it, no risk."

DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,memtiger,8,Mon Jul 20 14:06:30 2015 UTC,My problem has always been Hand Cannons can out snipe Scout Rifles.    A pistol you would think be short-medium range like an Auto Rifle but with bigger hit per bullet.

DestinyTheGame,3dxnvr,autokill9,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"Thorn ought to remain a beast, for the work someone has to do in order to earn Thorn.  It's really easy for ultra-vets with lots and lots of time on their hands to not appreciate the amount of time it takes for the majority of gamers, who are in their late-20s/mid-30s and therefore (hopefully) have plenty of other things to do (full-time job, wife, kids) to earn Thorn without a very specific set of conditions.  Like pursuing the bounty with a Voidwalker, and Void damage across primary, secondary and heavy. I wasn't able to get Thorn until I had Word of Crota, and the bounty on my Warlock. And I ran the Thorn bounty during IB because I'm max level and rock people in IB, so it was easier to get the points I needed with Void kills.  I'm not going to win Trials, but I'm usually second on the leaderboard in non-IB Crucible. I have three max-level toons, all three classes. I got Destiny skills. But trying to earn Thorn on a Hunter or Titan, and without Void primary?  laughs  Thorn is a beast because it deserves to be. And I hope the feeling of finally having a fully-leveled Thorn in IB, after getting killed by this freaking gun for months and hating it, turns to joy and evil laughter as you are finally the one owning people with Thorn.  It's a beast, but it's not OP. I usually keep Thorn holstered until and unless I see other people using it. MIDA still rocks people in anything other than pure CQB maps with crappy sight lines. :)"

DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Kurosaki_Jono,75,Tue Jul 21 06:57:45 2015 UTC,Yup. I don't really get the point of PS exclusives if there's literally no way to entice Xbox users to switch to the PS platform without starting over
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,daitenshe,11,Tue Jul 21 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the exclusives are meant to pull Xbox Destiny players to PlayStation, but rather are for newcomers who have yet to play it all by offering more content for the same price.   Seems obvious to me; someone has both a PS4 and Xbone, or has neither and wants to start playing Destiny, then the PS-exclusive content is there to sway then towards Sony's machines."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,vkbrian,5,Tue Jul 21 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"The only problem with that is those who are joining this late in the game probably have no clue that there are specific console items. If they were super excited they probably would've bought the game long ago. I think the most important target, by far, would be those coming from 360 or PS3 to a current gen console. The only one who wouldn't benefit would be Xbox so I'm sure they're the ones holding out on making cross platform transfers possible."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,daitenshe,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:59 2015 UTC,"Im buying and xbox one simply because of better exclusives IMO halo 5,forza 6,fallout 4, and star wars battlefront all look sweet (i know star wars isnt an exclusive but still)  On the PS the games that half interest me are bloodborne and rocket league"

DestinyTheGame,3e010q,LamborghiniJones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:49:16 2015 UTC,"Fallout is all system, the PC is the big one to get due to mods but otherwise it's specific to nothing. Forza is exclusive though, as the counter to Gran Turismo I believe.   PS gets the Destiny exclusives mainly due to Bungie breaking from Microsoft in the first place. Nothing more really, though I'm sure Sony put in a nice down payment."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,bassem68,3,Tue Jul 21 11:06:20 2015 UTC,Xbox One is getting mods as well

They talk of 'Destiny Update 2.0' which will be a forced update like all previous updates. It will increase the version number to 2.0. At the same time (or close to it) The Taken King expansion will become available to those who purchase it.  Are you thinking that ""Destiny 2"" will be a different thing to Destiny 2.0?"
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,sec713,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. I don't think the new disc releases will be sequels, but big expansions that could be played by themselves if someone didn't buy the earlier stuff."

DestinyTheGame,3e010q,UnknownQTY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:36 2015 UTC,"There should be cross platform PLAY, not just transfer. Outside of exclusives the work is minimal to have the character and save tables transfer, since Destiny doesn't use either Sony or MS's cloud save systems."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,AnalSlutFrog,7,Tue Jul 21 00:21:25 2015 UTC,Microsoft and Sony will never allow it because they're fucking dicks.
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,trevxor,4,Tue Jul 21 05:16:13 2015 UTC,"TBH, it's probably more Microsoft than Sony. FFXIV is cross-platform on PC/Mac, PS3 & PS4, but not Xbox because Microsoft specifically disallowed (at the time) cross platform play.   Now that they're doing cross-platform with PC, it's possible they would allow it, but not probable."

DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Zabalba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:09:43 2015 UTC,Do you think you can dig up that source? I'm always interested in hearing about how all of this fell into place with the exclusivity and lack of dedicated servers.
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,MonsterMashie79,6,Tue Jul 21 03:20:32 2015 UTC,"DON'T DO IT!!!  Every person who switches over just adds fuels the fire.  The only reason these company's (PS/Xbox) pay for timed exclusives is to get YOU to switch... that's how they get back their money (and some) that they paid to have the exclusives in the first place.  When people switch all it does is show that this system works, this is bad for ALL gamers, as it just means that both company's will continue to do timed exclusive deals on Destiny and many other games.  The only people that loose are ALL (both Xbox & PS) gamers as we will ALL miss out on more and more content through timed exclusives and will also be paying more for it all."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,hurricane_eddie,13,Tue Jul 21 15:09:43 2015 UTC,"This point doesn't really make sense because most people don't want to switch for exclusives. They are switching due to different social circles playing on different consoles. I have both consoles and would love to use my PS4 characters on my XB1 to play with my brother and some friends.  A bit off topic, but I would be livid if a certain Rocket Launcher dropped while playing my alternate console."

So in this case, OP's friends probably chose PS4 for the exclusives, and now he follows because of that decision."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,TheMasterNoob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:27 2015 UTC,"Basically. They all chose PS4 mostly for its exclusives (and because of its shitty reveal) while I went with Xbox One for its exclusives. I wanted both from the start for this reason, but I'm not rich. And I started playing Destiny back when I only had a 360 and none of us had current-gen consoles, so staying with Xbox only felt right."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,MonsterMashie79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:28:04 2015 UTC,"I chose PS4...because I have a PS4. I didn't choose PS4 because of the exclusives and I'm sure a lot of the people did the same. Now of course, console exclusive GAMES are terrible and I find those to be stupid, unless it limits our gameplay if they release across all platforms."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,hurricane_eddie,0,Tue Jul 21 12:08:35 2015 UTC,Why do you think they pay the BIG$$$ to have exclusive titles or timed exclusive content then?
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,HubbaMaBubba,2,Tue Jul 21 06:12:59 2015 UTC,"It's a money making business after all. If Sony threw in more money towards Bungie's development cost, Bungie is going to throw them the exclusive bone or two to attract more customers to their console. This is much better than the game simply not releasing (as in not developed) on one console or the other, which is what we used to experience with third-party titles all of the time."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,BLAQKROXSTAR,2,Tue Jul 21 08:27:17 2015 UTC,Microsoft and Sony have contracts making it impossible for Bungie to implement this.

DestinyTheGame,3e010q,AssassinReign,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:27 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, Diablo came out on PC more than a full year before the console versions.

I can always use more motes or heavy since the game starts you with 0 lol  tl;dr IMO Start fresh, it's the best part of the game. Especially since you have friends waiting to help you get back up, trust me, they're probably starving for something to do!"
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,LustHawk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:49 2015 UTC,"I switched to Xbox One from PS4 and found the same thing to be true. Except wow! You really like the PS4 controller? It is the worst input device ever developed. I switched for my friends, but I am excited about the Xbox Elite Controller. Any my hands no longer cramp up after an hour from using the worlds worst controller."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Howabout2009,3,Tue Jul 21 05:36:13 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I hear a lot of people saying the exact opposite. I personally think the one controller is to bulky and it makes my hands cramp up just like the ps3 controller did. No such problems with the ps4 controllers and I even hear this from friends that came from xbox 360/one."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Wmsi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:41 2015 UTC,100% agree. Started a character on XB1 last week to play with a friend and the controller is killing me. I feel like it's really awkward to hit the shoulder buttons with your hands on the triggers
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,theMADelf13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:42:59 2015 UTC,As owner of both PS4 and XB1 can confirm. atheon fight didnt go so well because of LB button feeling wierd.

I read somewhere that cross platform multiplayer would be feasible for certain games.  It's the sony v micro war that keeps stuff like this from ever happening."

After playing the beta on the PS4 (and before that too, but we won't get into that)  I have 3 34s. One of each class. every. single. exotic (except those new hunter boots) Almost all armor was fully leveled [Missed probably 2 for each character] One last gun to level (NO LAND BEYOND!!) Then I switched to PS4 during the last Iron Banner week. Between the Red Bull codes, and the Iron Banner armor. I was 32 within the week. And 34 VERY soon after.  But I miss my Titan. I miss my Voidfang/Light Beyond Nemesis combo in trials. I miss my Gally. I miss my flawless raider, and my flawless raider.  I know it's only a matter of time for me to get most of that back, and I'm treating my stay on Playstation far more casual this time around. But yea.... I would have hopped ship probably 1-3 months earlier if I could have done so in a happy fashion."

I really miss my PS3 char, but am already up to 28 on Xbox One. I really hope that one day there is a way to revive my PS3 char, dinklebot-style."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,mashpott,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:48:34 2015 UTC,I have both systems and have the game for both....I stopped playing on ps4...think my one guy is lvl 16 or something but I have 3 34s on xbox one. The thought of doing grinds again makes me cringe. I wish characters were shared between the two systems with exception to the exotic weapons.
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,daedalus1982,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:30:33 2015 UTC,I feel ya. Just moved form xbox 360 to ps4 this week and not having my 3 34s sucks. I personally dont think I'll be doing the grindfest all over again on ps4 however so ill probably stick with just 2 characters.
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Burnmybridge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:25 2015 UTC,"Question for PS4 users, is PS4 also plagued with disconnection errors? I have amazing internet, but for some reason when I play Destiny specifically on Xbox One I get disconnected at least once every hour or two."
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Gek_Lhar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:59:36 2015 UTC,I don't have disconnection problems on my Xbox. My roommates do sometimes on their PS4s though. So I couldn't tell you for sure.

DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Seien,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:24 2015 UTC,I think you can go from 360 to one. or ps3 to ps4. Cross-platform would be microsoft to sony.
DestinyTheGame,3e010q,Awesomesauce40,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"Only thing about cross platform it opens up a lot of holes for data being lost, duplicated, or just messed up all together. You never know if your gally or hawkmoon will just turn into a green rocket or a white pistol. Crossing platforms is something that would be awesome and cool, but it would take a whole s**t ton (and I'm talking a metric ton here) of coding and time and bug fixes that no one really wants to go through."

There is no reason that the full game should be locked for a year just because you play on Xbox instead of play station. If the exclusive content was gone, it would make cross platform play, or at least transferring, a hell of a lot easier to do"

I was never going to use them and I needed them out of the loot table. Sony has the worst customer service department in the world, with the DMV coming a distant second.

DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,The_Beagle,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:45 2015 UTC,I hope he said something too but that failure to say it is no excuse for those guys
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,MidWaveFlo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:58 2015 UTC,"He probably was ranting about a final rounder because isn't that the only way to get sniper kills? /s so his teamamte thinks the guy is reloading, tries to catch him pants down and gets domed."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,fimbleinastar,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"Nah everyone wants to be the hero, in trials/tunnel vision. I'm sure someone said something and they just run in thinking I'm going to put this epic come back on reddit...   Yeah that come back sure is on reddit."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,SomeRandomProducer,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:24 2015 UTC,literally all they needed to do was jump through the door/round that corner and they make the snipers job A LOT harder.
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,The_Beagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:42 2015 UTC,Exactly. Throw a nade if they have and make the sniper leave the area for the revive.
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,SomeRandomProducer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"That's a solid point... they were probably more focused on remembering to record their ""clutch moment"""
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,killy666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:59 2015 UTC,Even if they didn't. They should know the enemy is somewhere near their team mate since he just died. They should also hit just casually walk through a door like that.
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,Sbrodino,4,Tue Jul 21 00:35:20 2015 UTC,"Feels like a panic rez, much like as a titan we often panic smash. The dudes just rez and ran like headless chicken towards TC.  Great vid, great skillz."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,coasterreal,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"They self ressed together, I doubt there was much communication going on among these guys."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,schne867,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"If they would have jumped into the room together, thrown 2 firebolts each - he is super dead. Now, I bet they still lose the match but rezzing together isn't a bad idea 2v1 if you really want the win.  I just don't understand running in one at a time. Come in, two at a time, guns/nades blazing."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,k6plays,6,Mon Jul 20 19:16:48 2015 UTC,They were out of LOS one just had to rez and he could get the other.
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,enjaydee,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:02 2015 UTC,Remember there's a period of 2-3 seconds after death where you can not rotate your PoV. This all happened faster than the dead guy could probably process and communicate it.
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,3kleo,2,Mon Jul 20 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"Actually OP was heading for the special ammo crate and only turned around when they self rezzed. That being said they walked out of that door single file. The second warlock should've seen that coming, but the first had no chance."

I guess most people reset it when they lose flawless?  Not related but I like bragging: I was the last one standing on Widow's Court with three enemies chasing me. Managed to kill all three with Thorn. Bet they were salty."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,SomeRandomProducer,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:55 2015 UTC,i guess some folks just try to go as far as possible to maybe get to 8 wins and that gold package

DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,SomeRandomProducer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:44 2015 UTC,Some people that we came close to beating last night got their flawless against us. We were up 4-3 at one point and I was kind of glad to see it happen even though we lost. We were a decent team but no where good enough for 9-0
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,corysagaming,10,Mon Jul 20 19:18:49 2015 UTC,"Three massive fails made by the opposing team that round:   Titan goes Leeroy and chases you down instead of reviving teammates Enemy team could have easily guarded your teammates' bodies until overtime and capped the flag. Enemy Warlocks used self-res to make the same mistake the Titan made and go Leeroy instead of playing defensively and waiting for overtime.   They could have easily won that round, but threw all their advantages away. They deserved to lose, and you deserved that win."

DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,westen81,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's the Her Benevolence sniper.  With the right roll it's a beast.  Even with a bad roll it'd still hold it's own :P
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,granger744,3,Mon Jul 20 17:05:08 2015 UTC,Whats your roll on it?

DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,granger744,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:02 2015 UTC,Same roll only with shortgaze and snapshot
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,westen81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"Shortgaze and Snapshot are a brutal combination - makes me feel like I've got my Ballista or USR back, but with a slightly faster RoF."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,Lije93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:44 2015 UTC,LongView + Snapshot will give you fast scopes too but a lot more AA
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,gOt_LaX_03,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:41 2015 UTC,"but also more zoom. I prefer the lesser zoom, which is why I run ACOG on most snipers in CoD. (Except the Atlas 20mm, it's not an option)."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,insufficient_funds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:13 2015 UTC,You're right but if you look at side by side pictures of both the difference is negligible
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,gOt_LaX_03,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well...maybe I'm just more used to the lesser AA - weapons with more agressive AA tend to throw me off some."

Ideally you want to get that first snipe/headshot before they have a chance to react.  It's just a nice safety net to fall back on at those times you are under fire.  I wouldn't say it's a perk that's absolutely necessary to have, but if you have mats, etc to spare then try it out.  As for handlaid vs injection I think either will do!"

It just looks...different. I'm not going to say OP is definitely doing this but their gameplay looks similar, especially the quick zoom in/out to peek radar and the sights readjustment right when the video starts. I'm saying yes. Sweet snipes either way."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,cbeastwood,4,Mon Jul 20 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"The movements of the aiming reticule are too small for a controller to make with the inherent dead space in the center of the controller ""zero,"" unless he's playing on the lowest controller sensitivity, which, based on the turn to the right at :08, he is not."

They'll change direction, but the vector is almost always straight.  Mouse reticules go all over the place, and they are way twitchier.  Here, I uploaded a video of what it looks like playing on a mouse.  Pay attention to the reticule movement; especially when I'm OUT of combat  https://youtu.be/YqqduoX_oVc"

I didn't see a lot of twitching in the OP's video so that kind of setup would be ideal.  I think the twitching from your XIM mouse video would give me motion sickness."
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,whybother292,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"It is kinda hard to watch from a recorded video, I agree, but when you're the one controlling it, it's totally natural.  Kinda like driving in a car vs riding in a car; when you're controlling the motions, it doesn't bother you.  The reticule is sort of an extension of your eyes; the mouse is moving the cursor where you want to look.  Anyway back to the OP; the motions that he makes (sweep sniping left to right) are almost impossible to do smoothly with a mouse.  With a gamepad, the stability of the right analog stick and the acceleration built into the controller software smooths the sweep motion perfectly, but when you try to do that with a mouse, it doesn't work.  Its like, have you ever tried to draw a straight line in photoshop or MS paint or whatever using a mouse?  Very difficult.  But with a controller, it would be no problem."

Just watched one of the ""mouse"" streams from Dr. Lupo that someone mentioned earlier in this post: http://www.twitch.tv/drlupo/c/6957389  I assume the quick in/out of the sniper zoom in that Dr. Lupo video and the OP video is helped by the mouse setup bc you are just pressing a button to zoom instead of requiring the full analog left trigger pull that a controller requires."

Yeah click-zoom is probably a good idea.  I don't do that though.  I actually use the Xbox One controller in my left hand, so zoom is still left trigger.

Learned how to snipe and make slow, slight adjustments at that sensitivity.  You can imagine how slowly you'd need to move the reticle for those tiny adjustments. Only recently had I made the switch to a sensitivity of 7 in order to fine tune the snipes.  Did so since most of my kills had been coming from sniping anyways.  I feel like I've found that ""sweet spot"" at this sensitivity, for sniping at least."

DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,Yuenku,3,Mon Jul 20 17:09:11 2015 UTC,It's god mode against other players who don't have a mouse and keyboard.   I used to play CoD with a guy who had a xim. His k/d was an average of 4.5.   It's an unreal advantage against console players.
DestinyTheGame,3dy82o,KidAstronaut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"That doesn't apply so much to games with longer TTK.  COD has full auto guns and near insta-kill weapons.  Mouse users will destroy gamepad users.  But Destiny has longer TTK's coupled with REALLY heavy aim-assist, plus deadly far reaching grenades, rockets, and supers; all of which squanders a lot of the mouse users' advantage.  Don't get me wrong, its still a decent advantage, but its not going to turn a 1.0KD player into a 3.0KD player.  You might go from 1.2KD to like 1.5KD with practice"

DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,CronusThrowsPunches,6,Tue Jul 21 02:40:24 2015 UTC,So whats the best stats to go with for PvP and PvE? I usually go with the highest armor and recovery I can get.
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,delta8369,7,Tue Jul 21 04:44:19 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you want out of it and your play style. I personally wouldn't say that there is a best set up. Most people say go with agility and recovery. This is what I was doing for a while after seeing videos like the one from DattoDoesDestiny. However, now it depends. I may try to get just enough armor to survive some of the examples given and put the rest into agility and recovery. A huge point I'm trying to make here is that CaptainChaozZz did the research to allow us to see how much damage one can take.   I will say this though, I always have some amount in recovery in crucible. For me, it's important in crucible to know when to run, hide, and recover your health. If you are able to recover faster, you don't have to hide as long and may be the difference between engaging in a firefight with max health again.  As for PVE, personally, it depends on what content I'm playing. I feel that PVE is more forgiving with the choice you make in terms of armor, recovery, and agility. Enemies aren't as relentless as in PVP. I will say, in a qualitative sense, I feel much more like a tank with max armor on my titan in PVE than with minimum armor on my hunter/warlock."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,delta8369,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:50 2015 UTC,Oh I see what you're saying. I think I'll take a look at all those videos and decide what the best setup is.

DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,S0rrowS0ng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on class and playstyle. It is hard to go wrong with high Recovery, and I would say either Armor or Agility depending on playstyle.  Armor increases survivability by enabling you to take more damage. Agility increases walking speed, strafing speed and jump height of your initial jump (not jump skill).   Do you want to strafe faster or take a few more hits?"
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,tarallodactyl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:56:33 2015 UTC,Definitely armor and recovery. The benefits you get from maxing out those two stats far outweigh the minor boost in walking/running speed and jump height. Datto's breakdown does a good job of showing just how little improvement you get from boosting agility.
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,mynameissuperderp,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:10 2015 UTC,"But the difference between a minimum agility to max agility build is massive, it seems like my bladedancer will blink twice as far as my minimum speed warlock"

DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,b1tters,3,Tue Jul 21 06:18:37 2015 UTC,"I finally got around to playing my Warlock this week in PvP to level up. I have a hunter and a Titan maxed, and I have never, ever felt so cheesy as when I played my Warlock. Between the insane amount of armor, the versatility of the class abilities, and the frankly ridiculous range and perks from melee I can only assume Luke Smith secretly runs a Warlock. At least in basic crucible, that class is a hair above ""balanced"".  Edit: Also Titans need something PvP melee wise. Hunters get Blink strike and throwing knives, Warlocks get the shotgun palm. Maybe if Titans got something like a sudden charge that wasn't shoulder charge?  Edit 2: also shouldn't hunters be the most flexible? From a lore standpoint?"
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,Cosmic-Jew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:22:00 2015 UTC,Warlocks get the shotgun palm   Is this the OP melee Warlocks have or something else? I've just finished leveling up my Warlock and I've not heard that reference before.
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,SpectralFlame5,0,Tue Jul 21 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"Warlocks are flexibility incarnate. Don't look at it as warlocks alone as they are some what restricted in other areas. Do you blame a radiant skin flame shield warlock for having a high armor rating? It's only that high when all points are put into armor.   Ram warlocks have more defense, and less grenades. Base nova bombs, etc etc. And when people talk about their armor like everything is supposed to be set in stone, they're mostly bewildered I feel from a pvp perspective with w slight hint of that not fair. I'm not blaming you per se but think of it this way. Now warlock can go in hard. A pve option that was not even possible, and if very fun to experience as it is way different that how said titans do it."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,b1tters,9,Tue Jul 21 06:49:59 2015 UTC,"If Warlocks should be a ""jack of all trades"" class not restricted or tied down, if I understand what you're saying correctly, then their wide ranged skillset shouldn't outweigh that of another class. Instead, it should be a little worse."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,Kowaxmeup0,6,Tue Jul 21 07:07:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Jack of all trades, master of none. Currently it's Jack of all trades, master of most."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,b1tters,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:03:48 2015 UTC,"And prior to the ram? Remember when titans would rock an  armor bubble in PvP and people thought lemme just walk in and disrespect. That changed up with saint 14 dropping more and more and then being sold. People adapted their game play styles, rather unfornately to the point where they'd rather just nova bomb the whole bubble, but effectively.   I honestly think in time people will adapt to fighting that type of warlock, a ram voidwalker. Seeing as how the life steal doesn't proc on every hit and has a cool down, yes there are things they can survive, but they've given up their prime skill if they decide to spec all armor, highest recovery in the game. The ram is essentially saying kill me at a distance. The ram is the excuse for the current shot gun meta. I personally don't think its the master of most because I think the community makes snap judgements rather quickly constantly searching for ""the best"" and I don't hold that against them. Technically what's better than a sniper rifle in a game that is all about killing enemies quickly at a same distance. The ram won't help out with a headshot, most nothing will. But higher agility?  That's just my opinion. I'd be willing to read and consider a list of the warlocks ""master of most"""
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,Cosmic-Jew,3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:31 2015 UTC,"Well the ram can survive sniper headshots from the lowest impact class. That i know for a fact. Not to mention shoulder charge, magnetic sticks, tanking golden gun in normal radiance without radiant skin etc etc. it really is a bit too much."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,b1tters,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"Space magic. Its not just the ram, its full armor + the ram. That is a big difference. Yes it makes sense to max out your armor when wearing it for the biggest buff in that regard, but putting it simply its trading kill potential for survivability. There are other exotics out there that boost agility and armor, no? Radiant dance machines, I know mida, lord of wolves. This let's people play custom play styles with different loadouts they might have wanted to try but simply couldn't. And as there are always more exotics coming out it will be dethroned as well. Remember when everyone thought hotpf was the end all be all? Or the beginning of HoW when people thought purifier robes were clutch? The meta evolves and changes.   In PvP where all you do is die, it makes sense. Instead if running around solo, people should fallout and team shot ram warlocks and try to stick in twos. There's simply more bullets in numbers."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,SpectralFlame5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"There are no other items in the game that permanently raise the Armor stat in the same way the Ram does. You are missing the point here. Why is a Warlock able to outclass a Titan in Armor when Titans are supposed to be the heaviest armored class in the game? Warlocks should be more like glass cannons, but right now they aren't. They make better tanks than Titans."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,MeowzaForceGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"Im not missing the point. I'm saying nothing is set in stone as evidenced by the very existence of the ram. Its existence is literal proof that preconceived ideas that this game is based on are subject to change. Is a titan the heaviest armored class in the game if you put all of emphasis on speed and recovery? No. Do titans have an entire subclass designated to being armored? Yes.   There is also a team vs solo perspective to think of. Who is more helpful to a team of players a song of flame hopf sunsingers or a ram woidwalker? Which is more optimal.   A ram warlock is a bad warlock by the initial definition of a warlock. Giving up so much of what makes warlock special  for selfish gains helping himself. In a team based game a tank is tanking for self and team at the same time. Defender does that, warlock is just a little harder to kill. Yes the stat is higher but overall no. Simply no"
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,angershark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"The more optimal is a Radiance Ram Warlock. Because I can promise most Ram wearers you see are Sunsingers, not Voidwalkers."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,dregpride,0,Tue Jul 21 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Do you play a warlock? Our jump is incredibly slow on sunsinger and definietly makes us die and is a liability. Warlocks in general move slower than hunters due to less agility. We had more recovery was our only thing we had better. 0 reocevery takes 6.5 seconds to regen full hp and full reocery takes like 5.1 seconds. Us having am extra 2 points of recoevery only gave us like .3 seconds faster recovery so its not really good for the most part.  Hunter is the meta. In the higher levels of gameplay hunters wreck all the time. Golden gun to kill 4 people is hands down better in almost every situation. Self rez warlocks die all the time before they can even do anything. Everyone reacts to you self rezzing and downs you and you didnt do anything. I dont run self res anymore because it doesnt surprise almost anyone anymore. Its a liability for sure. Maybe at the lower levels of gameplay it seems better buts its not. Its hard to get kills when it takes you 4 seconds to hit one person with twonfirebolt nades, while a hunter could have golden gunned 4 people in less time it takes a sunsinger to kill one.  Im ranked top 6% in kd on one warlock and top 11%  in overall skill. The people the game matches me upnagainst routinely outplay and destroy me with their supers. Golden gun beats firebolt nade almost everytime. Arc blade does. Titan smash does. Ibuave shotgunned titans and they panic smash and they dont die. Shotgunned them BEFORE they are in any smash animation mind you.."
DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,Kowaxmeup0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're comparing supers to grenades here. If the hunter used his super to kill the warlock in the first place, the scenario is entirely different.

DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,jagerx9,2,Tue Jul 21 10:01:08 2015 UTC,"Might be decimal points difference, like 199.6. They will show the damage as 200 when it actual fact there is a literal sliver of health left."

DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,AntFaace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, you have to minimize the number of factors which affect the damage output (like shots, DoT ticks etc.) to reduce the impact of the rounded numbers.   In the example above I count 14 of those factors (1 grenade, 10 ticks & 3 shots). Additional, the displayed damage from one Necrochasm shot is 11 with both Accurized & Aggressive Ballistics - but you'll deal more damage with AggBal than with AccBal."

DestinyTheGame,3e0wru,mjconns,2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:37 2015 UTC,"Right, so to clarify, all classes have the same base health+shield at +0 armor. Hunters start off with +0 armor, +0 recovery, and +4 agility. Titan's base health+shield is technically +4 armor. In any case, to figure out how many units of armor/recovery/agility you are adding, I linked a planet destiny article. It can be seen here, just scroll down a bit. There are also hidden bonuses which you are probably well aware of. You probably want to get +6 armor to get ~194 total hp. Hunters can actually get up to +8 armor, which is one less than what Titan's can get."

DestinyTheGame,3dzmoi,csreid,10,Tue Jul 21 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"That's not because of clever foreshadowing. That's because the missions were part of the original story, just removed to sell. Everything about them fits into the original story and the existing areas."

That's why there's so many references to them and why so many of the locations and objects were already in the game, they already had plans for them. I think it will be the same for TTK, they will have a lot of references to the next 2 packs of DLC because it's easier to have as much of them built now and then add the finishing touches on later"

Seriously...if Destiny had launched with TDB and HoW, it would've been near perfect. Story could still use some work, but at least now there's content. If TK brings a good amount of content (and it looks like it will; I'm cautiously optimistic) and a better narrative approach, then it'll be well worth it in my books."

But there are many different views to take in this unstable world.  The Vex seem to be attempting to rewrite the code of reality itself, making them an integral part of it. Becoming a universal constant is about contiguous to god-hood. Why not take the chance and be forever.  Plus I've always liked Skynet/Prometheus/The Geth."

It's just a lot of teams aren't smart enough to exploit it.  The high spawns only advantage is the ability to take middle as a counter, and play for OT, but nobody seems to be able to do it"

I guess my point is while flipping spawn points wouldn't be a terrible idea during a trials run you DO switch points and you have to win from both sides to go flawless.  Good teams find a way.

I use completely different weapons depending on which spawn I get and it'd be a pain in the ass to swap every round. :P I love the current design. Spawning outside on Cauldron means we can rush into B and hold it down for as long as possible. If the other team gets pokey, we can take one out and rush them before they can prepare a revive strategy. Otherwise it's totally fine to wait out the timer and capture the point. But when we spawn inside, it's a breaching game where we encircle the entrances to B, flood it with grenades and find an opportunity to break in and raise hell. I love that the spawns dictate how we're going to play each game. Lastnight we set ourselves a new record by going 9-0 on Cauldron in 41 minutes.  :D"

I don't agree with switching sides each round, but there should be some sort of half time every 3 rounds where you get about 30 seconds to change loadout in the middle of the match during which you switch sides.

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,FiniteReign,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:08:59 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree.  One side of the map has an inherent advantage.  All things being equal in a round of trials, the team that spawns on the ""best side"" controls the map and the zone.  Spawn flipping would alleviate this for asymmetrical maps.  When things aren't equal, spawning on the ""bad"" side can be overcome with superior tactics / aim / skill etc.  But the point here is to make the setting EQUAL to allow for skill from BOTH teams to be the determining factor."

If your team winning or losing depends on where you spawn then you shouldn't be playing trials, period. Bungie user research's data backs that up"

Widows Court isn't too bad either since both teams can snipe effectively from their spawns. Upper spawn as a slight advantage, but low spawn has its good sniping spots too.  The cauldron is the worst. It is a sort of symetrical map, but one team has a clear advantage in getting to the middle room first.

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,PSN-McNutCase,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:26 2015 UTC,Widows court is balanced IMO. If you don't sprint straight for the sniper lanes the other side will beat you there no matter which spawn you get. Going to the stair lane? Bottom spawn can get there a fraction of a second before top spawn. Going up the middle lane? Top spawn can beat bottom spawn there by a fraction of a second. Those are the two most popular sniper lanes and you can beat out people camping them without too much trouble from either side.
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,JWiLL552,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"My group never had much trouble spawning low.  Typically the other team goes to snipe near the walkway close to A flag and scope down near the church. I didn't really find either team had a big advantage sniping there, when we were low it was easy to see their heads peeking out and take 1-2 out before rushing. We had more real estate to move around down below and maintain our sights on the walkway, so it could work to the low team's advantage.   More often though we'd push around towards the B flag and flank them from the side.   Spawning up top was a bit better but it wasn't a huge difference. Just depends how you approach it."

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,AReditByAnyOtherName,2,Mon Jul 20 20:16:36 2015 UTC,Except I went 9-0 in trials  this past weekend on Cauldron and prayed for the A cap point spawn on the stairs because its easier to snipe from.  And it also only has three flank doors whereas if you have control of the throne room there are 5.
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,ace2459,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:40 2015 UTC,None of that negates the fact the the final cap point spawns in that room. You can only snipe from the stairs if they leave that room. It's completely viable to hold it the entire game and it forces an attack/defend game where the defenders win by default. The extra entries are only a minor nuisance because there are only 3 opponents anyway.

All you posted was the heat maps for locations of where people went to most. What you really need is win rates for each spawn on each map.  At the end of the day, I think they put most of their more balanced maps in Trials because they had to account for over-time. You don't see maps like Blind Watch in Trials (although I do love that map) because OT flag placement would be incredibly one sided.  You take a look at one of the most successful games for PvP shooters (CS) and their competitive doesn't switch sides for a full 15 rounds."

DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,corrizzle,6,Tue Jul 21 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"Presumably the people complaining about this have actually used a fusion rifle.  I suspect they use them often.  It's somewhat of a mystery why they have not read the numbers that appear after every shot.  I guess they stack up because the shots are so close n succession, but, if you are using one for even a few minutes at least a few shots should be legible.  The complaint is common enough.  Bungie has taught us that yellow = crit, so I think they should follow through and make the FR crits yellow too."
DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,Obfuscasious,11,Tue Jul 21 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"That's because both of you are wrong and this is actually because you're hitting an enemy in a weakspot. Test this out: go to a dreg with a simple gun, like Word of Crota (turn off explosive rounds for a second). Hit it in the body and then in the face. Notice how the damage is three times higher? That's because after the 1.5x modifier for headshots that hand cannons have (test it out in the crucible if you don't believe me), there was a 2x multiplier making it a 3x multiplier in total because you hit the dreg in their weakspot.   Test it out with a fusion rifle. You'll do more damage with the headshot. That's because you hit their weakspot. Now take your guns to an enemy with a yellow healthbar. You will literally do half the damage in their faces. Hand cannons will do the expected 1.5x here and Fusion Rifles will do regular damage. Body shots will do the same damage on these enemies as on red bar enemies. Their weakspot has simply been removed.  Fusion Rifles and such just don't get critical damage."
DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,El_Giganto,4,Tue Jul 21 06:14:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing this up. Looked into it and found this thread among many, which had more info on what you were saying.   this is why Fusion Rifle ""headshots"" do double damage, but damage numbers show up as white. It's because Fusion Rifles do NOT have a precision multiplier, but when you hit a Dreg or Vandal in the head they have 50% armor reduction in that area, so it seems like a Fusion Rifle is doing ""precision"" damage when its multiplier is in fact 1.0x (ie nothing). -/u/ssnomar"

They're in a perfect spot right now after the last nerf where they're high risk, high reward... they can't challenge shotguns up close or sniper rifles at range, but they can be beastly somewhere in between as long as the player is proficient at using them. They have such a high skill gate though that most people are tossing them for either a shotgun or a sniper rifle, both of which are far easier to employ effectively. How is making this situation worse going to help them?  Quick-charging low impact fusions could use a buff as a shotgun counter and I'm glad they're doing that. But nerfing slow charging high impact, which are good at mid-range and the far edges of close range and are very risky due to the long charge time is exceptionally foolish."

With an unleveled fusion rifle in the crucible (and I don't even know what perks to reforge for yet), they are extremely potent.

Once the perk nerfs hit, shotguns threat range will decrease a hell of a lot, and fusion rifles will continue to be insanely powerful.  In PvE they are practically useless. They don't hit through cabal shields or hobgoblin immunities right? If they hit through those things, they would be perfect in PvE. Otherwise, bleh.

DestinyTheGame,3e141q,Memnenth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"So what? They still counted to the weekly cap and it's a horrible exchange rate if you're doing it purely for that. I'm drowning in mats just from doing Wolves events, Judgement and Queens Wrath packages and have nothing to upgrade (literally every single exotic maxed out except the 2 I don't have yet).  I think it was 5 marks for 20 material? And currently we can get 20 material for 10 marks. That means if somebody were to trade all their weekly cap for the other kind, they can only gain 50 more total for the kind they were buying.  400 material for 100 marks which count to the weekly cap is no issue at all."

Blink, Increased Control, Double Jump, Triple Jump, and Catapult are all better, faster, easier to correct jumps. Glide is slow and cumbersome. If you like it, great. But when you play good players using better jumps you have to compensate for your shitty, slow maneuverability, and this is all I care about.  edit 2 - Guys. I know how to use a Warlock. I'm not the greatest player alive, but I know how to bunny hop with Focused Burst. It's just a shit jump."

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,entropy512,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:10 2015 UTC,Where's the benefit of using the Ram w/ Sunsinger? Isn't the signature perk Void melees? Seriously interested as I passed on it for LBN last night...
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,4,Mon Jul 20 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"Because the Toughness bonus applies to either Voidwalker or Sunsinger. When you're running a full Toughness + Recovery build on any Warlock and you're wearing The Ram, you become the toughest build in the game. You can tank 2 head shots from Thorn without dying, you can tank 2 body shots from Praedyth's Revenge, and you can even tank Shoulder Charge.   When you use Radiance, even if you're using Fireborn instead of Radiant Skin, your toughness goes up even more. So much so that while Radiant you can tank a single Golden Gun hit. If you self-res and you immediately melee someone for Flame Shield, your toughness is just pure absurdity.   So yes, you sacrifice the Life Steal perk, but your all around survivability drastically increases."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"By toughness, do you mean armor? Am I correct in understanding that this toughness is not visually measured anywhere when changing armor pieces? I already run the highest armor/recovery build that has little agility. I don't recall the bars moving when changing any armor let alone the Ram"
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"Toughness is a stat that is affected by your skill tree choices, not your actual gear (with the exception of the Ram). With the Ram the bars won't change but the toughness very definitely goes up. A lot of people around here refer to Toughness as ""Armor"" but for obvious reasons that can become confusing, so I refer to it as Toughness, which is what the skill tree calls it.  In the skill tree itself as a Sunsinger you'd want to use Arcane Spirit (or Arcane Force) + Divine Order for a max Toughness build. When coupled with the Ram, this is where you'll see that difference."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"How is it confusing? In the perk tree, the 3 stats are in fact Armor, Recovery, and Agility. I'm only confused about whether this ""toughness"" is really armor or some other magical stat not measured... I simply read the perk on the Ram as a Voidwalker stat, so assumed the benefit came when using Voidwalker. I've never heard of an armor piece having any hidden benefits not explicitly stated in the perks."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"Hover over the perk on the tree itself and it in fact refers to it as ""toughness."" Look at it however you want; I'm not here for an argument. And if you don't believe me about the boost in toughness, read the posts I listed."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"Im not arguing either, just asking clarifying questions how this benefit is measured as I've never heard of a hidden perk on an exotic armor piece, ask assumed if I wasn't using Void, I wouldn't receive whatever damage resistance was included that everybody raved about.  Toughness made it all the more confusing. Is this what you were looking for? http://imgur.com/cbWJ21x"
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Yes, it's referred to as Armor in that bar. The same stat is referred to as Toughness in the actual perk tree when you hover over a perk. I refer to it as Toughness instead of Armor simply because some people get confused about the Armor stat being affected by the armor they're wearing, which is never the case... except for with the Ram. I can see the confusion, though; sorry to have caused any difficulty."

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,Phunky_Phan,8,Mon Jul 20 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"should be 34 soon as Variks sells boots   Hit up ToO. You only need 6 wins to get an Etheric Light. If you purchase the 3 consumables, win your first game to get you to 3 wins. Then you only need 3 more wins and have 3 losses of grace to get those last 3 wins.  You could be 34 today if you did that."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,ZEBRAKAKEZ,4,Mon Jul 20 16:44:25 2015 UTC,Running 3 of the same class seems like a huge waste to me.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,robstak,3,Mon Jul 20 17:30:52 2015 UTC,A lot of people made same-class alts when everyone was grinding the VoG for a full set of gear. More characters of the same class meant more chances to finally get that helmet (or whatever). Bungie has pretty much alleviated this with the PoE by adding armor cores instead.
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,StarfighterProx,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, I only really started light leveling right before TDB release."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,Macc14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:46 2015 UTC,I have 2 hunters and a lock. Started with one hunter and got tired of not being able to buy xur things so I got another to 20 thru crucible and then just swap the gear. Lock is l33 so now I can do 2 without it. Just waiting for the time when I will be able to dedicate a couple hours to a titan so I can delete the second hunter. May as well run NF and weekly. I should do VoG and CE while I'm at it. Crap it's Monday again. May as well wait until after the reset and get more SC. Rinse repeat.
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,usmc2009,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"It was for power leveling and to get Raid sets faster. The Raids were setup to reward you with gear for the class you were playing. If you have 3 Titans (or Hunters or Warlocks) you can roll each raid 2 times a week per character (total of 6 rolls) for gear and weapons. If you get lucky you can have all the raid gear for your class in one week (if not lucky 2-3 weeks).  The downside is that engrams (Legendary and Exotic) have a 1/3 chance of decrypting for your class (2/3 for NOT your class). This is fine if you are playing all three classes because you have a 100% chance of decrypting something for a class you play - it may be a duplicate, but at least you can still shard and use the class material gained (if you shard an item not for your class it still shards out the associated class material; Warlock item > Warlock Class material, Hunter item > Hunter Class material, Titan item > Titan class material).  TL;DR - Play with mules and you may get boned on 2/3's of your gear."

When Xur sold icebreaker the first time and I missed out because I didn't have enough coins I said enough is enough. I made a second Hunter and leveled him up. When that was done I made a titan he's currently 32, last week I did my nightfalls and got a Ram on the first and Purifier Robes on the second. The next morning I carefully cleared everything off of 34 Hunter #2 and deleted him (with something like 600 spirit bloom in tow. Thanks ether chests!) I made a shiny new warlock and yesterday hit 30 with him. There is no one best class they are still fantastic and fun as hell in their own ways."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,macanudo14,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:06 2015 UTC,I also missed out on Icebreaker due to lack of coins and was so gutted (still waiting ;_; ). Quit for a while and just came back a few weeks ago. Just made char No. 2 (a titan) and was happy to be getting a few extra coins each week (actually the first week I've managed to get the 6). Didn't even occur to me until literally this thread to just make another hunter and move over all the gear for an easy extra 9 coins. ¬_¬

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,MeanKareem,9,Mon Jul 20 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"I think having your main as a hunter makes it easier to play the other classes, but doesn't work as well the other way.

Titans, well, I just never got around to it. My Titan is level 14 and I hate it."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FlyByNightt,4,Mon Jul 20 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Titan is the best overall class imo.

Titans can support a team best, but warlocks can self-res and generate nearly unlimited orbs in the abyss (with Obsidian Mind + Nova Bomb).

Ive got him lvl 26 now but still need to max out his Gunslinger class.  Ivde noticed that with a Hunter that its a completely different playing style.  With my Titan I could kind of rush in and run / gun / charge.  But with the Hunter you need to plan your attack more and jump placements. Cant wait to get the Bladedancer leveled.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,DestinyReddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:48 2015 UTC,I had three titans because I was forever 29 until TDB dropped. I have been hording warlock and hunter exotics and finally got around to starting the other two classes. I should have done this since the beginning. Playing all these classes helps me enjoy the repetition of the game it also helps me narrow down what guns to keep. I store all exotic weapons in the vault and have purple weapons specific to their class. (high recoil weapons= Hunter because of gunslingers trance for example)

I made the mistake of creating and part-levelling all 3 classes within the first couple of weeks of release and I think I missed out on some of the magic of becoming seriously good with one, and then trying my hand at another. I was used to all 3 classes before I'd hit level 20 with one and I feel like I missed out slightly :/  Wont be making that mistake with the new sub-classes!"
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,DonCriddik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more.  I played this game with two titans and a warlock until this past weekend.  I deleted the warlock and built a hunter (with intent to eventually delete a titan and remake the warlock).  It's so awesome blade-dancing/golden-gunning!  Also, enjoy delving into the Striker sub-class.  Hardly anything in this game is as satisfying as shoulder-charging (especially in PvP)."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,mayhem74,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"I have two hunters and a warlock, ive been on the fence about making a titan for literally 3 months now without committing.  I guess my biggest hesitancy is the lack of long range melee, and not leveling my hunter as fast with a new raid."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,Obersword,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Ages ago (5 months), I was having the worst luck in the world with my Warlock running Crota, and could not get the boots to drop, so I was a forever 31 for the longest time. HM Crota was quickly approaching and with how overly concerned LFG can be with being max light, I was like 2 or 3 weeks away from the release so I created a 2nd Warlock... and then a 3rd. I must have run Crota close to 10 times before FINALLY getting the boots to drop. After months of playing with only Warlocks (x3), I deleted 2 and made 1 of each other class and those next couple of weeks were some of the most enjoyable experiences that I had with this game."

The things that are messing with my head: the differences in jumps and the drastically different melee ranges.  I went straight to crucible (after doing the mission that unlocks the sparrow/cosmo patrol), so like level 2 with my psi umbra and calcutta sniper. Pretty funny getting 2-3rd place on the team without even having a heavy or super!"

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,Goose306,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:39 2015 UTC,I had one of each for awhile. Deleted the warlock and re leveled a Titan. The warlock just wasn't fun to me.
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,OtterJethro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with this wholeheartedly, as I've been maintaining three different guardians since around the time of TDB release. While Warlock is still my main, simply because I enjoy it the most, I find switching between classes very gratifying, if for no other reason than I can relate to teammates who are playing either of the other two.   Imagine a Destiny where you could only have one character: the community would split up into groups based on their chosen class, and no one would have any real way to relate to the other groups. Having the ability to play all three is, IMO, one reason why this community is so overall friendly and wonderful. Sometimes it doesn't seem like it, but Bungie really knows what they're doing when it comes to subtle intricacies of gaming.

I now have a 34 Titan, 34 hunter and 33 Warlock. It really refreshes the game having 3 different classes."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,krisbaird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"Best part of playing all three classes is understanding each classes strengths/weaknesses in PvP.   I started with a titan and would complain about how OP hunters and warlocks were in PvP. Then after rolling one of each, and throwing a nova bomb into a wall or get sniped after popping golden gun, you learn to respect each class.  I've gone flawless with each class and really feel like the only part of a class that could be consider OP in PvP is the warlock's melee range and shield-on-hit with flame shield.   Other than that, the game (from a class perspective) feels pretty balanced. Well, I guess Warlock firebolt with viking funeral and burn is pretty gross too. Oh and the Ram, lol."

They unanimously said to pick whichever I liked the most and not to worry because I would eventually start the other two. So from the start I kind of had it in my mind that I was eventually going to have all three. I got my main to 31 (during TDB era) and then started my first alt. When HoW came out I got both to 32, then started my last one and leveled all three to 34 in the first month. Then I started leveling specific load outs (PVP, Crota, VOG, etc).   I was worried that it was going to be a chore, but to be honest the only drag was having to go though the story two more times. Now I just pick and choose which content I want to do each week with each character. I don't worry much about bounties unless they are to level a new armor piece or weapon. It really isn't much more work after they are max level. Nightfall x3 is 45 mins-1 hour and you don't NEED to do all the raids on each character. I just armor hunt or help buddies for fun."

I actually think i'm having a better destiny experience in the missions and patrol this time around instead of my warlock! And definitely dying a lot less than before."

Have since leveled a hunter to 34 just before HoW dropped and am currently sitting with a Level 16 Warlock.  I have purple boots, a number of exotics, and two armor cores saved for Variks as soon as we reach 20 (later this week).  It gives you a fresh feel for the game that's for sure.

Sadly I tend to do everything on the Titan as it was my first and favourite character. I also don't get to do raids often as none of my RL friends play Destiny. I need to make new Destiny buddies! For me it's always pick up groups via r/fireteams which are usually 1 hit experiences. I've yet to do the higher level PoE for any of the 3 of them.  My Titan is bae though, I just can't stop playing him all the time. Exo for life. <3    Would recommend having all 3 classes to anyone reading this. The only issue I had for ages is choosing the race/sex combo for them all. Would like to change the facepaint on the Titan (Exo Male) and the face/hair of the hunter (Human Female).

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,CarpathianUK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:03 2015 UTC,I'm on the opposite end here. I've had three hunters since launch and never really wanted to play another class. I recently deleted my third hunter and leveled a voidwalker warlock up to 29 and maxed that tree. I hated how slow he was and glide is just unbearable. The special is nice though. I decided to start on sunslinger and halfway through I still wasn't feeling it so I deleted him and recreated my third hunter again. At least this way I won't be stuck in mud and I have my double jump back. I would have probably kept him longer if he had double jump. I may try Titan at some point.
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,konnerbllb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:08 2015 UTC,Hunter was my first class and I also absolutely hate the warlock jump.  Titan has a much better feel though than warlock if you feel like giving it a shot.  In fact the Titans jump is amazing

That was cool for a while, until about 2 weeks before HoW, and I killed 2 hunters to roll a brand new titan and warlock, leveled them, and reached 34 on all 3 characters not long after the release of HoW.

That just means everything up to that point gets rolled into a single release.  It's neither new nor novel to Destiny, I remember picking up GoTY editions of games a decade ago.  The 3rd subclass thing was there from the start, every class starts with 3 spots although we only have two right now.  The rumor then was that Bungie had planned a 3rd class but ""couldn't do it and didn't remove the code"" or some other excuse, which was about as believeable as the Tooth Fairy."

DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,gnikeltrut,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"not having room doesn't make something broken, it creates a necessity to free up space.  Which is why I think if we have all 4 we should be able to forge it into an all in one piece for the PoE."

DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,Bu11etToothBdon,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you meant - you clarified it very well in the original post.  That's not how the system works right now, though. My suggestion works within the system and allows you to save vault space and still get all the benefits.   Since the armor all looks the same for each class, no matter whether it has Vex/Hive/Fallen/or Cabal bonuses, having just one of each is optimal.   The great thing about the game is, though, that if you think this suggestion is bogus and want to wait for a feature that might never be implemented, you can (if you have the space for the armor).   Enjoy the game the way you want to."
DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,Bu11etToothBdon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:28 2015 UTC,I re-read and understand a little better now. They need to do something to limit how much armor we are having to carry around.  I have most of the exotics sitting in the vault because of armor that will become irrelevant come september.
DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,J_Dubya01,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"No worries.   Here's something to consider, though - Bungie leaves a great part of the choice in the game (which armor to use, which weapons to equip, etc.) up to the players. Granted, balancing weapons can take some of the fun out of the things we choose, but by and large, they're trying to make the game playable long term, not short term.   Keeping things in the vault because they might be irrelevant 'someday' overlooks the fact that they could be used, with complete relevance, today.   Why keep and not use something for two months because you've heard it will be worthless? No one has yet seen any proof HOW worthless the weapons may be after the changes. We might even like the changes. No one can say right now unless they test the game for Bungie.  What's the point of waiting in fear of changes based on hints we've been given? (I say hints because I couldn't tell you the in-game difference between a 1 and a 3% nerf or boost to any weapon's damage percentages.)  I say: enjoy what you have, today."
DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,dregpride,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"I was talking more about being relevant for year 2 of destiny, not the nerf.  I dont see destiny letting us ascend old material from year 1 to year 2.  I think its going to be a kind of fresh start reset.  They could suprise everyone thought and let us bring weapons and armor over.  But if thats the case the game will never change, PvE will still be fatebringer/Vision, and ghally."

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,iggy_91,10,Mon Jul 20 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"I finally came back to this after months of using The Last Word.  I just felt like a skill-less asshole all the time.  I absolutely refuse to use the Thorn and I was tired of being outranged and postmortem killed by Thorn DoT at close range.  Mida and the strafe machines allow me to feel like I have actual skill again and gives me endless satisfaction watching those no-skill Thorn using assholes miss shot after shot.  I also refuse to use shotguns.  Exiles Curse, Peruns Fire, and Praedyth's Revenge for large maps are the only specials I let myself use in PvP.  Is this your bladedancer setup?  Arcbolt  Better Control  Razor's Edge  Fast Twitch  Quickdraw  Hungering Blade  Maxed agility and recovery"
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Xaukael,5,Mon Jul 20 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah after playing with MIDA and RDM everything else seems so slow!  And yeah that is it almost exactly, except sometimes I sub in blink on smaller maps just so I can have a better chance of getting away from shotgun rushers that get the jump on me, and I tend to spec more for armor than recovery so I can survive trip mines and the like, But other wise that is my exact setup!"
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,iggy_91,5,Mon Jul 20 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"I found the MIDA / RDM combo about two weeks ago and it totally breathed new life into PvP for me too. I love beating Thorn users!   One thing I found is that Vestian Dynasty works great for taking out shotgun rushers if you see them in time. Plus a max agility Bladedancer feels like it can back peddle faster then a Titan can sprint, so that helps!"
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Buzzy243,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah the pure speed is phenomenal! And haven't really tried out the VD in PvP but I might give it a shot.

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,iggy_91,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:03 2015 UTC,Whats the benefit of fast twitch over backstab in your opinion?
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,FOX_DADDY_SUPREME,4,Mon Jul 20 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"I run 100% strength with fast twitch with increased melee attack speed.  Hunter melee range sucks without blink strike.  The warlock melee has range, but they are in the same place after they do it.  Blink strike is confusing to other players.  You disappear and hit them, then smack them again before they can respond.  OR you can put two shots from the Mida in and strike them to restore your health with  hungering blade (this is my preferred method because people rarely expect a rush in a scout rifle engagement).  The advantage is the ability to close the distance quickly.  This allows you to always get the first punch and usually get the second hit killing blow before they can ready their shotgun and find you.  This of course does not work well if they always have the shotgun at the ready, but that is something you have to watch for.  Mida and dance machines should be used in that instance because you can walk backward aiming and firing faster than they can sprint at you and stop and aim.  Backstab has limited utility because you have to catch the enemy unaware and it has to be charged.  I prefer to be 100% sure that I have a blink strike ready when going into an encounter as it is an essential part of my increased mobility build."
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Xaukael,9,Mon Jul 20 15:47:07 2015 UTC,Blink strike recharges in a few seconds even without max strength.
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,BishopCorrigan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:11 2015 UTC,"Your build is essentially the same as mine. I like using the Vestian Dynasty and blink to deal with rushing shotgunners, though.  My k/d really improved because I stopped trading stupid shotgun kills. Plus it's just more fun to hang back a little and maneuver to win gunfights instead of constantly dying and then sprinting back to die again.  The only downside: I feel like I'm running in slow motion when I switch classes.  I'd be willing to bet that the MIDA is going to be the next Thorn when 2.0.0 drops."
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Buzzy243,2,Mon Jul 20 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"I have recently started using MIDA in pvp and have been fairly successful, i will have to try this setup as i haven't really nailed down a secondary to use with it."

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Symbolic-DeTH,61,Mon Jul 20 14:05:05 2015 UTC,RD is in the trinity because of its health regen perk. It counters thorn pretty well. it kills decently quick too if land all headshots.

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,parallel_process,5,Mon Jul 20 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, but aggressive ballistics keeps the recoil in a very manageable vertical line."
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,justnotdoingmywork,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:30 2015 UTC,exactly the recoil and the consistency of not getting all headshots is why the messenger is better. headshots for days. on paper the TTK for RD might be better but messenger will outperform 9/10 times
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,MorbidDesire,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:03 2015 UTC,Yep. much easier to get 2-burst kills with the messenger than red death. Half the time aiming at the head with Red Death still gives all bodyshots for some reason.
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Pwadigy,27,Mon Jul 20 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"As a competitive player, Red Death doesn't counter Thorn. A good player will still be able to double Thorn headshot you while being hit by a pulse rifle. They'll also grab cover between shots, whereas red death has to be exposed longer to finish each burst.  Theoretically the regen saves you from Thorn DoT, but in actuality, you just get the peekaboo treatment, killing you before your opponent is exposed long enough to get the damage in.  TLW kinda works in CQC with its fast, 3 shot that can hit the body. TLW is more of a counter to the shotgun that Thorn users run, however.  The real counter is camping harder, and occasionally making aggressive snipes. The other counter is your own Thorn, or a shotgun (which is undeniably simpler)  Hence our meta, and the /r/crucibleplaybook's advice of ""TLW+sniper"" or ""Thorn+Shotgun."" I believe that statistically, 75% of the better players pick Thorn+Shotgun.The other 25% run TLW+Sniper."

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Overcooked_Cabbage,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. Got it after only dozen strikes or so and almost sharded it not realising how rare and good it is.
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Alucitary,2,Mon Jul 20 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty much because it counters the Thorn burn. It can be effective at all ranges if you practice with it a lot. Most of my lighthouse runs have been done using RD exclusively. But you're right I got my Hopscotch two weeks ago, and haven't looked back."
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Overcooked_Cabbage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"It's probably great in the right hands but speaking for myself, there's no way I can reliably 2-burst people with those stats so I'll take better stability and range over the healing perk any day."

Sometimes I can waste snipers with my scout rifle.  The Crucible is more fun and challenging this way.  Edit: I actually like the fact that almost everyone uses shotguns. I can shoot them with my fusion rifle from a safe distance while they run at me. Sometimes it works, sometimes... it doesn't."
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,iggy_91,7,Mon Jul 20 14:01:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah as a fellow fusion rifle user I feel your pain. i think the biggest issue is the prevalence of lag coupled with the travel time of the bolts. if there is even a little lag your shots just wont register like they should. In a good connection game though, ohhhhh baby the master blaster is happening!"
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,vkbrian,11,Mon Jul 20 14:15:16 2015 UTC,I found Vestian Dynasty to be a pretty solid anti-shotgunner option. The absolute edge of its effective range seems to be just outside of stuff like Felwinter's. I used it on Anomaly the other day and don't think I got Blink-shotgunned once.
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Sir_E_Badger,4,Mon Jul 20 14:22:14 2015 UTC,I got Perun's Fire (quick charge) and Give/Take Equation (good impact).
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,UniversalFist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:51 2015 UTC,This. Although it should be noted that the ABSOLUTE edge of the Dynasty's range is actually pushing legit mid-range. It's just very difficult to consistently hit shots on a moving target at this range. It can be done though. Nothing is better for taking out shotgunners camping behind corners and doorways than rushing them with a VD in hand.
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,leif777,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:13 2015 UTC,Sometimes I can waste snipers with my scout rifle.   I must have taken out 10-15 snipers last night the same way. I lost a few duels but I'm pretty sure I came out on top.

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,coreyisafox,5,Tue Jul 21 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm in the Trials or Iron Bananana, I almost exclusively use random weapons I need to level up, weirdly effective low-level stuff like the Stranger's Rifle, or any random weapon to pursue a bounty (aka, Kill 15 Guardians with a Fusion Rifle).  Stranger's Rifle is still great in vanilla Crucible and a lot of fun to use. But I think it presents a cool new challenge to try out new weapons. Destiny can be a pretty hardcore game in a lot of ways with the end-game content. I think vanilla Crucible is the place to just mess around and have fun. Same thing with running patrol missions or Wanted bounties.   So if I run vanilla Crucible I always try to level up armor and weapons that need it.   Like just last night I played a few rounds of Skirmish. I've had a Three Little Words with a pretty good roll just sitting because I haven't taken the time to level it up. It's a pretty unique weapon in that the impact is CRAZY for the Pulse Rifle (a weapon type I don't use much of to begin with)."

That said, I'm a firm believer that a good pvp player can outplay anyone who relies on any gun in particular. I'm not said good player, but I certainly aspire to be haha so not getting tied to any particular crutch/weapon I feel is important for improving and being able to handle shifting metas better."

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,Fildok12,3,Mon Jul 20 15:08:21 2015 UTC,"It's a progression for me. When a new meta comes out in a competitive game I try it out, make sure I understand it well and play it until I consistently perform well using it. Then I move on to using other strategies because I either want to challenge myself or want a fresh playstyle because the meta stuff gets really old really quick.   I just got back into the game a week ago and have been pretty much exclusively using thorn in pvp, but that's mainly because I love the weapon as a package - aesthetic, perk, and lore all come together to actually make me feel like using it is a unique and empowering experience. I used to love using it in vanilla days when it really wasn't much to write home about - I never thought it was underpowered, but you weren't going to outduel anyone using a SUROS that's for sure - so I'll enjoy the month or so I have left to use it at its peak efficacy. And honestly I'll probably keep using it just as much after it gets nerfed. I'm really sad to see it's become so hated in the community - I understand why, but I really think it's one of the coolest pieces of gear in the entire game from a design and lore standpoint."

Playing with Thorn is no longer satisfying to me, because its in nearly every match for ToO or IB, and I've become exhausted by its presence in my hands or anyone else's.  I love my MIDA to death. Got my first and only unbroken with it, and it's fun to strafe against players, and watch their aim just disappear. I've also had some luck with Praedyth's timepiece, 3 little words, the Bow and the Red Hand IX. Using the same weapon, game after game does become boring."

DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,RotorDust,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:54 2015 UTC,I just want to say thanks for this post.  I put TLW and Thorn in the vault and started running with MIDA.  Brought a little more fun back into the Crucible.
DestinyTheGame,3dy2hl,PauLWaFFleZ,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:42 2015 UTC,"Well my thing is that I've been running absolutely nothing but Scout RIfles for the longest. I've been a long range guy ever since playing Halo 2. Battle Rifle and Sniping were my absolutely favorite things to do in Halo 2. I remember when they added Team Snipers to the playlist for matchmaking I lived in it. So that mentality has carried over to Destiny and I found my perfect weapons in Scouts. I personally feel like the reforge system definitely helps close the gap on exotics. For example, I would have to say that right now my absolute favorite weapon in the game is my Zero Point LOTP. I got a very nice roll on it; Luck in the Chamber, Hand Laid Stock and Outlaw. Basically, my Zero Point IS the Vision of Confluence, but better. I got my 2 favorite scopes on it (Red Dot ORES & Ranged Lens RLR5) and it has a good mag size of 17. The stability might as well be 100, just like Vision. Not a lot of people know this, but Luck In The Chamber should be the default Perk 1 that you should go for on the 3 new medium impact Scouts (Zero Point, Hygeia, NA3D1). The LITC shot does 81 damage crit. If you're able to score the LITC in the head along with two other headshots your opponent will drop. I have never once not killed anybody in PvP when I've hit 3 headshots in a row with an LITC hit included, at least whwen they're on their normal health. And then Outlaw is a neat perk too. I've really enjoyed what the reforge system has given me on my other Scouts as well. I can't wait to see how its going to be in TTK. From what I've seen the new weapons will have TWO optional perks.

You'll be pleasantly surprised: that thing handles well, kills very quickly with headshots, and isn't bad at closer ranges than the Pilgrim/Messenger are comfortable with. The downside is that the weapon model is quite large and the sights have almost no zoom, so it can be difficult to figure out where you're supposed to point the gun."

I use Auto Rifles or Pulse Rifles, depending on the close quarters/range needed.  I prefer perks that allow bonus damage and rapid reload. For shotguns, rate of fire is #1 need for me. If I miss, I want to get the next shot off first.  It's really fun killing those damned blink-jumping, thorn/TLW-totting hunters and warlocks with a generic Vanguard pulse/auto rifle; and also with a shotgun that isn't the Matador or Dry Rot, but The Comedian!

Just being away from the mainstream use of the big three.   -MIDA has a good rof, has third eye, and boosts movement speed which is helpful when doing the first part of CE.   -VoC is a primary with elemental dmg  that is full atuo and sacrifices a little of how fast it shoots for impact on each shot.   -NL Shadow is a monster when given with full auto.  -Zero Point Loop offers fairly good stats all around and is not bad to pick up  -One of my favorite heavy weapons comes from TDB which is Against All Odds. Very fun to use it has almost as much imapct as thunderlord. My only drawbacks is that it has poor stability, each mag holds 26, and the total amount of heavy ammo you can hold is I think 48 or so without having armor that increases heavy ammo capacity."

So we started coming up with challenges for ourselves by using notoriously ""bad"" guns and it was some of the most fun I've had in Destiny.  First round was Pocket Infinity. Primaries weren't allowed, as you can imagine, we all ran out of ammo fast and had to hide while waiting for special ammo to spawn. I couldn't believe that thing used to be overpowered, I could barely kill anything with it...still managed to win somehow.  Then was Lord of Wolves. It's not a bad gun at all but limited ammo and limited range are tough to work with when you can't use primaries.  Then Invective, same deal but even less range and two of us didn't have the ammo regen unlocked.  Then Hard Light...it actually worked surprisingly well in PvP. I'm looking forward to its buff, infinite range, low recoil and over penetrating ricochet rounds could make it a top contender.  Last one was Necrochasm. Hilariously bad for PvP but at least its stability is really good. Luckily the other team was trash and allowed us to stand directly in front of them, peppering them with BBs until dead.  I want to get those guys together and have another night of bad weapons, such fun."

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Mastershroom,2,Tue Jul 21 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"Am I missing something about the Vanquisher? When I heard it was going to be removed in HoW, I had read a lot of praise about it, so I ground out Crucible marks and New Monarchy rep to buy one literally the day before HoW dropped.  TBH I've found it very underwhelming, and not just in the sense that all auto rifles are at the moment. It's decently stable for a high impact AR, but only has 22 rounds in the magazine, which is by far the lowest I've seen."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,jonnablaze,3,Tue Jul 21 09:28:28 2015 UTC,It was a powerhouse before the AR nerf.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Clem80,3,Tue Jul 21 11:40:01 2015 UTC,"The V8 was a beast in vanilla, but with a decent roll.  The vendor version in the Dark Below was decent (the one you bought), but to be honest Field Scout (42 in the mag) was almost required, and something like Persistence, or Crowd Control, to make it even better.  But you had to be lucky with a random drop..."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Mastershroom,3,Tue Jul 21 14:01:21 2015 UTC,"42 rounds, wow. Yeah, that would have made it a completely different gun. Thinking about sharding my vendor model now."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,XxCanu_Dig_ItxX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:24 2015 UTC,The Vanilla version has twice the range as the TDB version.  Back then range really mattered on a AR.  It soon will again it seems .
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Saemika,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"The first V8 was great. Max stability and outlaw make it a headshot machine. Just reload after ever kill, and you can shoot anything you see with a great impact."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,DarkSunRider,0,Tue Jul 21 15:41:25 2015 UTC,"The good (and unique) thing about Vanquisher is that even though it has a very small 22-round clip, you also have Spray and Play, which speeds up reload when the mag is empty. You pretty much keep shooting until the clip is empty and the reload is so fast that you can almost keep aiming down the sights to keep dishing out the damage. Used correctly, it's almost like having an auto rifle version of Bad Juju because there's only a slight delay in dishing out the hurt."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Mastershroom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:24:02 2015 UTC,Spray & Play isn't unique though; you can do that with literally any gun that has it. And having a small magazine doesn't make it better; reload speed (for the same gun) is the same regardless of mag size.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,DarkSunRider,0,Tue Jul 21 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"Spray and Play isn't unique in and of itself of course, but having it paired with an auto rifle with such a small magazine is a big boon that compensates for it. I'm used to reloading after every kill, but if I don't use up over half the clip in getting a kill, I'll not reload until my next encounter because the reload speed is such that there is only a split second between the barrage of bullets I'm shooting.  To take advantage of the gun's perks (and to compensate for the small clip), you have to change the way you're used to using your weapons, and that is unique."

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,fifty1point2,17,Tue Jul 21 02:03:16 2015 UTC,"Isn't it technically Pest Control Matrixes here though, since ""Pest Contol Matrix"" is a proper noun? You don't have more than one matrix, you have more than one Pest Control Matrix. You're pluralizing the entire proper noun and not just the ""matrix.""

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,LustHawk,5,Tue Jul 21 03:53:03 2015 UTC,"""30 He-Mans"" sounds seriously wrong.  As a writing major I would just avoid the problem by writing ""I have 30 He-Man figures"""

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,TravisBewley,4,Tue Jul 21 00:11:08 2015 UTC,High impact auto rifles were always originally better I thought compared to the auto rifles with a tick mark of impact and maxed rof bar.

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,SovereignPaladin,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"The Nerf originally didn't effect low impact ARs much. I think this sounds less like reverting the nerfs but rather an even buff, which would have high impacts with the lowest dps still as it should be because they are so easy to use"
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,TravisBewley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:50 2015 UTC,I was reading the weekly update from bungie and they didn't give a percentage number of how much auto rifles are getting buffed but if it's percentage based at all that alone would make high impact auto rifles automatically better since they would get a larger damage increase due to how percentages work.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,SovereignPaladin,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"No, because rate of fire is factored in. Percentage won't favor any type. The results are mearly proportional"
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Beezneezman,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"?  the whole reason low impact autos werent affected much by the nerf was because the damage was reduced by a percentage so vice versa would be true as well for a buff.  If a 100 damage auto rifle gets a 10% buff that would  put it at 110 damage but then the 10 damage auto rifle would only do 11. Now look which got the bigger increase, or in the case of a nerf which would get a bigger reduction.  Unless you are saying fire rate is getting changed too."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,WormholeMage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:01 2015 UTC,"You can say one wasn't affected as much but before I got a vex mythoclast I used atheons epilogue and that thing shredded people. It turned into garbage. So let's just say all auto rifles got hurt, because ""barely affected"" doesn't quite describe a top tier weapon turning into complete garbage."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,TravisBewley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:56 2015 UTC,If a 100 damage auto rifle gets a 10% buff that would put it at 110 damage but then the 10 damage auto rifle would only do 11.   But dps of both rifles increased by the same 10%.

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,BluBlue4,5,Tue Jul 21 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"I don't get why everyone's bent on not getting a year 2 ""ascension."" Bungie will probably introduce some sort of ascension method otherwise the 250+ legendary/exotic weapons currently in the game would be rendered obsolete which would be a huge mistake. With current knowledge TK will only bring in 50 or so new weapons and that's not nearly enough. The game will become mundane and boring because of the lack of weapon choice. Also, think about this: What's the point of giving xbox players the ps exclusives if they're going to be underpowered?

DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,JatkaPrkl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"Well, within its ""effective range"" its going to be very good. Little problem with stability with its buff, huge amount of AA and higher damage than other guns in its class due to Aggressive Ballistics. It appeals to CQB/Close Quarters design. It won't be a nerf for those who use it like that. Just make up for its shorter overall effective range with a Sniper Rifle.  Edit: Its generally how I use it. And in a closed environment-its double bounce projectiles will be amazingly dangerous. Really puts me in the mindset of ""Tactical Spaces"" referenced in its flavor text.  2nd Edit: Also, it may be inconsistent-but its a exotic. Does it HAVE to fit into the mold whatsoever? Would make the gun more unique actually."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,evilparker,3,Tue Jul 21 14:20:47 2015 UTC,How i read it is just that the AR range nerf wont affect the Hard Light
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,deeleed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, that probably only ricocheted projectiles will be exempt from damage falloff... But it's worded in such a way that it could mean all projectiles.  I don't think Hard Light would be OP at sniper range with no damage falloff though. Have you tried to hit something far away with any consistency using a high RoF auto rifle? Good luck."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,mat_b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's ambiguous. Bungie seems to be good at ambiguous, despite authoring excellent lore. Plus they just sometimes completely leave out certain things, like Khepri's Sting DoT on invis-melees, Thunderlord's version of Firefly, and so on.  So we'll have to wait and see to REALLY know, but what caught me is that it mentions ""projectiles"" when first talking about ricochet rounds.  And yeah it wouldn't be OP if I'm wrong, but it would be the best AR in the game pretty much. I don't see why we'd use Suros over it. Granted the new Nechrochasm would be good too, but still. If it didn't have infinite range for ALL shots, the other ARs would still have a point."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,killzy707,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:33 2015 UTC,"Full damage of a single Hard Light projectile is not that high, it will still remain visibly unstable. It is still the low impact/high RoF profile"
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,wileykyoto,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:36 2015 UTC,"How I read it is that it will have a max range, but the damage will always be 100% and not gradually reduce the further you are from the target"
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,Thomasedv,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"You're focusing so much on the wording but the only reason they say projectiles is because it doesn't fire rounds like most guns. It's ionized polymer according to the grimoire. Replace ""projectiles"" with ""bullets"" and it's pretty clear that all rounds will be unaffected by damage dropoff, not just bounced ones."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,Riskbreaker42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but I'm 50/50 on it."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,Tower_Guardian,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what they meant by it and what they intend to do, their wording absolutely implies all projectiles, not just bounced ones, will not be affected by damage falloff.  ""Increase bounce count for Hard Light projectiles"" Here, bounce count implies bounce percentage, in which case this sentence reads: ""Increase bounce percentage for Hard Light Projectiles"" So the number of bullets bounced is equal to the percentage (in decimal form) multiplied by the number of bullets shot. Where bullets shot are referred to as projectiles. Therefore, the sentence ""Hard Light projectiles are not affected by Damage Falloff"" is referring to all projectiles.  Any other interpretation, by bungie, is a willful misinterpretation. As you've pointed out, it wouldn't be the first time this has happened, but I think it's pretty clear what those points imply."
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,Ninja--Panda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:23 2015 UTC,Also rare drop in nightfall and u can purchase one at rank 3/5 of IB Yes Her benevolence is a good pvp sniper. Her mercy is also a good pvp and pve handcannon if you dont have a tier 1 primary. Matador and Party Crasher are both tier 1 shotguns that drop in crucible. Shot package and range boosters. Not in my opinion. Too low of a drop. Queen faction isnt that great. You get one guaranteed a week.
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,tswafford95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"1) PoE 34/35 as well as Night Fall  2) You can use EL whenever to get a quick boost on armor. No reason to wait until it's fully upgraded.  3) Queens weapons are, meh. They are definitely not great when compared to many PvP weapons or raid weapons. ToO weapons, aside from Messenger, are close to garbage. Some can be re-rolled to something semi-decent but there's many other better solutions  4) Depends on your play style but there are many guns the vendors sell that when re-rolled, are very effective. Shotguns mainly stick to Matador or Party Crasher +1 if you don't have a Felwinter's Lie.  5) The chest is really only worth it THE FIRST TIME you open it per character. Beyond that, just need a key for the PoE 35 chest as you get ship and emblem from it. Also needed for completing the Exotic Bounty quest line.  6) Make some friends, be a friendly guardian. Become legend."
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,haynick31,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"1 - No, it drops on POE 34 and 35.  TOO higher packages.  Random from nightfall as a reward.  Possibly iron banner?  2 - You would think this would be the case but Variks sells a 34 armor piece every week.  You can easily be 34 very quickly.  I would personally do weapons first and just grab the variks armor with an armor core from 32 but that is me.  3 - Queens weapons, imo, are not that good.  4 - I don't reroll so I can't help you here.  Hopscotch pilgrim is the hot weapon atm though.  5 - You are almost guaranteed an exotic for the first big chest you open with a character.  After that it is rng.  You get 1 key per week per account for the first queens bounty you turn in so farming is up to you.  I would not waste too much time on it personally.  6 - POE 32 for the armor cores to get your characters to 34"
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,phatoriginal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"1: Nightfalls and some ToO rewards, IDK which.  2: Yes. Level before weapons.  3: There are a few good ones, like Wolves Leash, but yes overall, ToO is generally better.  4: Hopscotch Pilgrim, Party Crasher, Matador, and Ash Factory come to mind.  All drop from Crucible except Hopscotch, which can drop from Dragon strikes.  5: Not really.  First for the character for the exotic, but you should really only use it on 35 otherwise.  Just always have a few in case."
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,Renegade284,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"By all means:  1) Not quite, you can also get it in Iron Banner, Nightfall Strikes and Trials of Osiris.  2) Generally yes, as the level & defence stat gains are worth more than the attack rating gains on weapons. Obviously once you have one toon at 34, you might like to give them a couple of 365 weapons for higher level work before you start leveling your other characters.  3) I would disagree ever so slightly (although it depends on what else you have). Certainly ToO weapons (particularly the Adept ones) are excellent, but they are hard to get, so you might want to work your way up. For instance, Her Benevolence (Queens Sniper) is an excellent little weapon for PvP work and has been very prevalent in Trials so is worth a look (even if it is a ghastly pink colour...), plus the Vestian Dynasty is just a lot of fun, so get that if only to play with (its basically a Star Trek Phase Pistol, I mean, - come on...!).  4) To re-roll...likely a decent Rocket Launcher. I like Radegasts Fury re-rolled (or dropped) with Tripod, Javelin & Grenades & Horseshoes/TRacking. Good sniper (see Her Benevolence above) re-rolled with something like Hidden Hand, Quickdraw and Unflinching would be helpful, or a nice shotgun with range and impact boost perks.  5) Well...if you do a Queens bounty you are guaranteed one key per week, and you sometimes get extras. After a few runs of PoE you will find you have a bunch of Queens weapons, & your initial guaranteed (ish) Exotic weapons and after a few patrols you will have a bunch of keys (they won't stack beyond 5) so you might decide it isn't worth farming for...  6) Cookies are awesome, you should eat more cookies.   (Sorry, long day....;-))"
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,Denaius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"1) EL has a 100% drop chance from a Level 34 or 35 PoE completion. It also has a chance to drop from nightfalls and you can buy 2 EL for 5000 glimmer each once you hit ranks 3 and 5 of Iron Banner (that's 1 at R3 and another at R5)  2) I would probably agree with this, however it is sort of preference. I couldn't help upgrading fatebringer as soon as I got the chance.  3) ToO weapons are the best from the HoW expansion. Previous raid weapons from VoG and CE are far superior to the PoE weapons in literally all cases (I never run PoE L32 anymore its pointless)  4) There are some re-rolls worth getting on certain weapons, you may choose these over raid weapons in certain circumstances. E.g. a Radegast's Fury with Tripod + G&H is a far better PvP RL than Hunger of Crota (Radegast's Fury with the above roll is the best RL in the game besides Ghallarhorn, HoC is way overrated)  5) A treasure key gives you the chance to open the big chest at the end of a PoE, giving you a chance at an Exotic, queens weapons and other stuff. There is the same exotic drop chance from the big chest whether you complete L28 or L35 PoE. So, yes they are useful for an easy chance at an exotic, but they aren't particularly worth farming anymore.  6) Are you on PS4? feel free to add me and drop me a message if so,"

DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,weasel-king68,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:46 2015 UTC,"Do a search on headseeker. Another redditor did the math and found it wasn't worth the slot. Basic summary is that Messenger and Hopscotch have such a tight recoil pattern and with perks awesome stability, you're doing yourself a disservice trying to hit the body and climb your shots to the head to activate Headseeker. You're better off just aiming to get all three rounds from your burst to hit the head from the start and Hidden hand will help you do that.  I never really gave the 55AllFate a go because I was lucky enough to get a Messenger, but I'm looking to re-roll one now since I can't reroll the Messenger perks. I'm not sure if 55AllFate can 2 burst kill though."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,starkyiron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:52 2015 UTC,I believe the ALLFATE can be a 2BK depending on how armoured the guardian you're fighting is although I might be wrong. What roll of perks would you suggest then since Headseeker is a wasted slot?
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,starkyiron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like there's a misconception around headseeker. The point isn't to try to proc it, because it results in less damage. It's more of an insurance policy, because on a high impact pulse rifle, headseeker will save the 2 burst kill if you get five headshots instead of six. On an allfate though, it isn't worth it since it will usually be a 3 burst kill."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,starkyiron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:56 2015 UTC,"I'm some situations yeah, although both are good"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,starkyiron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"For me, my aim for critical shots is less than stellar for pulse rifles, so the Headseeker helps a little. For that second tier, Rodeo or Third Eye.  But everyone will have different opinions.  By the way, here are the options, in case you didn't have the Armory info: https://www.bungie.net/en/Armory/Detail?type=item&item=4265265106&itemname=55A-allFATE"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,LastNewtStandin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:13:42 2015 UTC,Thanks. Didn't know you could check the perk options in the armory?
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,Dok_Industrial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:38:27 2015 UTC,"I have Third Eye, Braced Frame and Secret Round. Your aim does not move. At all. Secret Round makes up for the mag hit you take from Braced Frame (27 to 21). I don't know why I don't use it more but it's a PvP nightmare of a weapon."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,Dok_Industrial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:29 2015 UTC,"That roll sounds pretty strong, how long roughly did it take you to get it? How does it fare in PvE?"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,Dok_Industrial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:14 2015 UTC,"I bought it from the Vanguard and it turned into that on the very first roll. RNG is unfathomable.  It's actually pretty good in PvE due to it's good range, secret round and laser stability. It's just as home pumping lead into a yellow bar as it is clearing trash."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,Dok_Industrial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, I like your description! How do you feel about Hidden Hand in replacement of Secret Round? The only issue I feel with this is you potentially lose 2 bursts with no way of recovering them. Alternatively, Hand-Laid Stock+Rangefinder?"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,3,Tue Jul 21 12:48:06 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about Secret Round: with 27 rounds and no Secret Round you get 9 bursts. If you have 21 (due to Braced Frame) and you don't miss (which you shouldn't, because Braced Frame) you actually get 10.5 bursts. Pulse Rifles always get either Truesight IS or Sureshot IS which both increase aim assist quite a bit, so for a mid-impact gun like Allfate I would shy away from Hidden Hand.   In PvP it's a sometimes 2 burst kill (which is about to get harder after the balance patch) but a guaranteed 3 burst, as long as 1 or 2 bullets (not bursts, single bullets) are headshots. A gun like Hopscotch Pilgrim, which has a larger mag and guaranteed 2 burst potential, should favor Hidden Hand to double down on the the 2 burst potential. Something like Allfate is a bit more of a run and gun style weapon due to the fact you can't guarantee a 2 burst kill. Secret Round will help keep you in the fight longer without having to reload.  Hand Laid Stock and Rangefinder means you're trying to use it like a marksman rifle, which you can totally do, but the fact that it's likely to be a 3 burst at those ranges means your time to kill will be lower anyway. I think Allfate is more comfy at the mid-range and slightly beyond - think just outside Red Death range. Just far enough away that they can't reliably 2 burst you but you can laser beam their heads. Something like Hand Laid and Rangefinder would be nightmarish on Hopscotch but I'd still take Braced Frame and Hidden Hand for it.  Sorry, that was long"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:07 2015 UTC,No this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for so don't apologise! I like your reasoning behind each decision so thank you for providing the information. I really appreciate it :)
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:02 2015 UTC,No problem man
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:49 2015 UTC,"Nice breakdown, Helped me out for sure :)"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'm rolling Feeding Frenzy, Reactive Reload, and Smallbore, and I have nothing but good to say about it--you're getting the quick kill from a significant range, which then leads to a high speed reload and higher damage (which leads to quicker kills, and keeps the cycle running).   This setup is pretty much ""perfect"" for ANY of the current pulse rifles people are chasing to reroll.  If you're looking for similar setups, here are the perk substitutions you can implement:   Feeding Frenzy can be subbed with Outlaw (faster reload, but you MUST get the headshot kill...RR allows you a margin of error which I'm not afraid of saying I prefer)  Headseeker can be subbed for Reactive Reload (the damage bonus is always available, but again...entirely reliant on the headshot)  Braced Frame can be subbed for Smallbore (your Stability goes through the roof, but you're looking at a 6 bullet reduction in your magazine, which may not be feasible for some of the guns)."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,winguardianleveyosa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:22 2015 UTC,This is the sort of thing I was looking for with my ALL-FATE so I may try and roll this. Do you have any idea how long it took you to get this roll? It sounds pretty strong.
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:00 2015 UTC,"I think I got this roll fairly quickly, but that was pure luck.  Having the alternate options for perks as I listed makes it a lot easier, but I'd make sure you still have plenty of weapon parts & motes on hand if RNGesus decides to be fickle."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"Well it took me like 40 rerolls just to get a Shot Package Matador. On the other hand I got a Dragons Breath on my first Nightfall, and I got Fatebringer+Found Verdict in my first VoG hard mode, so we'll see which side of the coin RNGesus decides to land on this time haha."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:18 2015 UTC,Also how do you feel about replacing Reactive Reload with Secret Round? Is that plausible?
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"Secret Round isn't a one-for-one swap for Reactive Reload; you won't be accomplishing the same thing.  SR saves you a round if/when you land a full burst; RR increases damage after a kill.    SR is absolutely workable.  However, If you're looking to push damage potential I'd suggest reroll."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,YoWutupthischris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:09 2015 UTC,What do you mean by 'I'd suggest reroll'? I'm going to have to reroll the weapon to get the best perks anyway right? Or am I missing something?
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,YoWutupthischris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:17 2015 UTC,"Well, not everyone may want to incessantly reroll a weapon just because someone else tells them.  Some people prefer Full Auto on a shotgun over Shot Package; others may find a Hidden Hand/Icarus hand cannon to be preferable to the Final Round/Luck In The Chamber ""mini Hawkmoon"" people say is the ""best"".   I'm simply allowing for playstyle and personal preference."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"I see, that makes sense. (For the record has anyone ever considered Icarus to be a tier 1 perk? Lol)"

DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,mrellenburg,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:10 2015 UTC,Hello again friend from another thread haha. Someone else suggested something very similar (with Smallbore instead of Braced Frame) so I'm thinking of rolling something very similar.
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,mrellenburg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Smallbore as of the moment due to it taking mah ammo. But with the base increase to ammo coming up for PR's, it is also a great choice. XD"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,mrellenburg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:33 2015 UTC,Braced Frame also takes away ammunition though doesn't it?

Hopefully it'll be a top pick in the future.

DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Anedim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:56 2015 UTC,All I've ever heard is that they come in engrams. If you can actually get them as just endscreen rewards that's amazing. But the drop rate needs to be increased a little. At least to level 28 strike level.
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,knockoutking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:24:46 2015 UTC,Are you sure it was from a tiger strike? because Planetdestiny confirmed you can only get armor engrams from a tiget strike now and I've personally done about 100+ of them in the last couple weeks without a single weapon engram.

I needed shards so as I got VoG armour I dismantled the corresponding armour piece for the final upgrade.   I would definitely like to get it back but farming the engrams is just so inconsistent. If they simply added tdb and vanilla armour and gear to the old strike loot tables I'd be beyond happy."

You CAN get  vanilla legendary armor from the Tiger strikes, but it would take approximately 10,000 games to get the exact piece of armor you want.  They would need to MASSIVELY increase the drop rate."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,ruisranne,2,Mon Jul 20 12:21:25 2015 UTC,hows the drop rate in general?
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,APhanpy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"Not great. Nowhere near as good as the current 28 strikes  I've played about 20 or so 24 strikes recently and I've no vanilla drops, other than blues"

DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Wendys_frys,23,Tue Jul 21 12:09:22 2015 UTC,"See, this has been requested before to have the old vanguard armor back in some way, but I like this suggestion probably the best. Just having a vendor selling them cheapens it, but if you'd have to run these strikes, then those who really do want the old look and have a motivation to grind for them, they can do so.  A lot of these kind of suggestions here just ask for an easy way to get old stuff (or any stuff in general, having a vendor), but like everything else in this game, you should need to play to get them.  As for weapons, that is trickier, and a part of me hopes that at least our current legendary gear would become irrelevant as year 2 goes on, so no more ascending. Because as of now, we look at the weapon buffs/nerfs with the knowledge of those weapons and the perks of the weapons we currently have, but we know next to nothing what the new weapons will be like and how these buffs and nerfs are going to affect them."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,foursy,8,Mon Jul 20 10:07:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, weapons would be tricky. If it was up to me, I'd put them on the loot table, but I'd make them have a lower drop rate than armor.   And yes, it's going to be tough going into TTK blind, while trying to figure out the game plan for something like this.

If you want evidence of which strategy is better for the community, compare TDB to HoW reception.  Both were tried, and the results were quite clear.  Fortunately it looks like Bungie is taking that to heart, the balance priorities for all weapons, including the originals, is an admission they're staying relevant."

DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Ospov,6,Mon Jul 20 18:54:31 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand? Vanilla Engrams and TDB Engrams are already available in the four vanilla strike playlists and the Roc Playlist.
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,kovensky,2,Mon Jul 20 15:12:51 2015 UTC,They are blue engrams. The chance it turns to purple is 1 in 1000
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Seeker80,0,Mon Jul 20 15:45:09 2015 UTC,I'm sure it's not 1 in 1000 as I have at least 6 blues turn purple a week and I don't turn in nowhere near 1000 engrams a week let alone 6000.
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,1dayImmaGitGud,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:55 2015 UTC,How many do you turn in?  I probably turn in 50-100 per week and it's a rare week that I a purple from just ONE of them.

I am unable to do bounties and doing them will be a grindfest. Mix that with unobtainable items from vendors and missing queen's Guard armor, marks, bonds, and cloaks from Petra and know we have unobtainable year 1 items, a glass of regret, and the most limiting vault space ever. Bad move Bungie, bad move, now explain yourself."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Needless_Hatred,2,Mon Jul 20 13:29:14 2015 UTC,You can still do the Blades of Crota bounty by playing the Fist of Crota mission. Just hop on your sparrow and drive past the whole first encounter until you see 3 acolytes summoning a blade of crota. Kill him and restart the mission. It takes less than 2 minutes per kill. Some other bounties take longer than that.  I do totally agree though that the blades should spawn like wolves though. I miss that.
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Needless_Hatred,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely did not enjoy Wolves as a low level player though. They really like spawning near story mission objectives...

DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,TotalHavok,3,Tue Jul 21 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"Putting the appropriate legendaries into the strike playlists would be great. To take this a step further, it would be very good to have the Tiger and Roc playlists get the increased chance of legendary gear that the Dragon strikes have. I’m not exactly sure what you have to do to get a legendary in Dragon, but it almost looks as if the player with the most kills usually gets it. If that is applied to the Tiger and Roc playlists that drop vanilla and TDB gear respectively, then those playlists would serve as a great way to ‘earn’ some of the old gear, instead of having a vendor.  And just to put it out there, since it’s been asked for a couple times just this weekend, a higher-level playlist with a random modifier. This would become the ‘Heroic Playlist,’ and be an early endgame feature, like the Weekly Heroic and Weekly Nightfall strikes. Just like the weekly strikes, the Heroic Playlist would increase in level with each expansion. It could start out at level 30 now, and go up from there. For rewards, slightly increased chances of legendaries & exotics from what the Dragon playlist offers, more XP & Vanguard rep/marks and a bit of what the weekly strikes have, such as a few strange coins or motes(more than the one coin/mote that is currently awarded).  The normal playlists are a step up to endgame content, so changing Dragon to have modifiers takes away from that. Let players keep working their way up with the normal playlists, and then the Heroic Playlist can give endgame players more to do."

Hopefully these manufacturers will rotate stock too.  How I see it work is that the faction vendors will sell a token for a chest piece, for example, and then you will go to whatever manufacturer you want and buy a chest piece from them via the token.  Each manufacturer will have unique perks/traits so you'll be able to customize your load out better.  So factions will become just a means to get the tokens and stuff like shaders/ships and emblems rather than ""you have to roll dead orbit because they sell the best shotgun"" like it is now."

I suppose unique ships are kind of cool too.  Do weapons from previous stock drop from these?   EX: ROC strike can give you a different roll on LDR 5001  I've heard people say those weapons drop, and others who said they don't. I choose to put my time into running Nightfall -> Raid -> Trials/PvP over grinding strikes to find out due to having a limited amount of time available to play.  I've looked up loot tables for ROC, but mostly only get videos, or posts about what people got in the form of engrams -> ships -> coins -> motes etc. etc. Not what the actual item itself is."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,uidsea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"The way it works, to my knowledge, is that you do the strike, and get rewarded the engrams, then those engrams can decrypt as the old weapons, which can be different rolls of each.  The weapons and armor are not in the post-strike reward pool, but they're possible drops from engrams.  Bungie hasn't released official loot pool lists."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,UnknownQTY,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. Upon further investigation of videos, I have noticed the ""I"" on the engrams dropped from those strikes.

People don't grasp 'correlation doesn't always imply causation' and will think that just because the one time they didn't grab that stupid chest and someone got an exotic, that somehow that is in fact correlation and causation. Even day 1 players would argue tooth and nail and tell me I was wrong.   Anecdotal speaking, I have seen as many exotics drop from when grabbing the spirit chest vs not grabbing it. If there is a legitimate correlation between the 2, I have not seen it beyond anecdotal rumors. If someone wants to say there might be a correlation, fine, I have no proof other wise, but to say it as fact without proof is rubbish."

Given, if someone like that called me an idiot for opening the chest, I'd definitely let them have it.  But my point was with you playing Destiny police and making final judgment as to how all new players HAVE to experience the game. You're comparing someone who has spent all of their life not knowing that Santa Claus isn't real with someone who has owned Destiny for a few weeks. It's not our job to decide how they are going to receive the game. If they ask about the chest, surely tell them. If you are going to make it your mission to verbally berate everyone who hasn't owned this game as long as you and try and regulate their experience, you're just a dick."

His DestinyDB profile said he's ran vog about a dozen times, so I apologise that that to me is a young rising guardian.  You started with the Santa comparison. I merely rebutted.  I also did not verbally berate this guy, read my OP. formally educated.  I messaged him saying Im the idiot who took the chest, now watch someone get an exotic.  I did not claim to be the destiny police, but going back to the Santa comparison, I'm not going to keep my mouth shut and continue to let people carry on believing something especially when they are adamant that it's factual."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,SamFletch7,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:50 2015 UTC,"I started with the Santa comparison, but you misinterpreted what I meant by it. What I was saying was that if someone has had the game for only a few weeks, is playing VoG for the 2nd time, and mentions that someone in his previous group said something about not getting the chest, you're post advocates belittling him and calling him a noob for spreading rumors. Again, it's one thing to stand up to a dumbass who is going to be adamant about you being wrong about the chest - It's another thing to berate some guy who is just genuinely clueless who is trying to have a conversation about it. Sorry, your post just comes off as holier-than-thou to me. When I started playing and doing raids, I was fortunate enough to find myself in pugs with helpful, patient people who didn't try to belittle me for not being as experienced in raids as them. I see posts on here all the time about how intimidated people are to even join a raid for their first time because they're expecting to be joined into a group of elitists who are going to point out and make light of every single mistake they make instead of trying to help them. Maybe you weren't the same way and maybe you have played a lot of other games like this before, but I know that if my first couple of Raid experiences involved having to listen to ""stfu noob,"" I'd probably be done."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,ForestFireX,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I am in no way a holier than thou kind of guy. I'm not even smug about how experienced I consider myself.  I also did not mean to sound like that as I posted this. I just get fed up at times with the actual smug know it alls that need to just be put in their place. If you're running your second vog attempt and are inquisitive, I'd be happy to inform, no need to be intimidated.

Let the players just avoid the idiots with low scores. This would really only affect someone when playing with ransoms. Your friends would know how you play and show you act and still play with you, right? If not, then the ratings are telling them anything they don't already know about you. Plus, I think this would just strengthen the already strong social  (in spite of awkward/difficult social tool functions in Destiny) side of this game.   Personally, if I end up in a strike I hate, or didn't cancel out of in time, then I play through to the end. It's common courtesy. I've only ditched mid-strike a couple times due to time constraints, and once by accident when I went to orbit when I really wanted to summon my sparrow. Lol."

Because the indoor space is tighter, it concentrates the time spent into fewer grid squares than the outdoor space.  Overall win rates for Burning shrine are 49.7% to 50.3%, so it's a super balanced map even though it's asymmetrical."

I really don't see why this sub still needs to have this conversation. It's been talked about endlessly and I've seen that tweet and other info/official word from Bungie employees about it being balanced."
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,genericsn,4,Tue Jul 21 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"They aren't using only trials data. They are also using data from control, clash, skirmish games, where the starting spawn can be swapped. Eg on Blind Watch, the team spawning by 'A' can still win by capping 'C' and flipping the spawns, even though they start at A. If BUngie showed the results for trials ONLY, these stats would actually mean something."
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,LOrdStilton07,9,Tue Jul 21 09:50:37 2015 UTC,"What are the win rates for the other maps? Similar I'm guessing? Is there a map that you've found that, after trials, is much more imbalanced then you thought? It'd be cool to see all the stats you see for all the maps."
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,tys022,3,Mon Jul 20 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"A problem is that imbalance only shows in provably well matched teams.    Take this week's example, cauldron.  The ""low"" spawn (c I think) has incredibly powerful tactics available, such as rushing one high and one low outside, which wins most 2v2s, all 2v1s,   and provides very safe reset chance otherwise.  It's just a lot of teams aren't smart enough to exploit it.  The high spawns only advantage is the ability to take middle as a counter, and play for OT, but nobody seems to be able to do it"
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,achegarv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:39 2015 UTC,"We actually did better starting on A side this week. Push lower door to set up in the middle, unless we were shotgun rushed then just move up the steps to a and cover the inside heavy spawn angle and the b door angles. If held on this outside we could bait a kill then move in and win. Teamshoot with 3v2 hurts bad.   Starting on C made us have to rotate all the way around the map to pull this strat off. Could be us being ""comfortable"" in that room or what ever though."

In either case, they each have plenty of counters as long as the team you're playing against understands how to switch up strats.  One match against blink shotgunners, we quit going to middle room because we were getting shredded by people just appearing in the room above us..

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,El_Giganto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, keeping the same spawn allows you to either change tactics or go at things the same way after a round. If the spawn flips, you are forced to do something else. I much prefer being given that choice."
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,ryanv1978,3,Tue Jul 21 06:07:57 2015 UTC,I went flawless 3 times this week.  and 3 times last week.  You would think I had the same spawn for all my matches; but I didn't.  I guess my point is while flipping spawn points wouldn't be a terrible idea during a trials run you DO switch points and you have to win from both sides to go flawless.  Good teams find a way.

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,Dox_au,5,Tue Jul 21 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"I actually really like that we need to learn different styles and methods for each spawn. I use completely different weapons depending on which spawn I get and it'd be a pain in the ass to swap every round. :P I love the current design. Spawning outside on Cauldron means we can rush into B and hold it down for as long as possible. If the other team gets pokey, we can take one out and rush them before they can prepare a revive strategy. Otherwise it's totally fine to wait out the timer and capture the point. But when we spawn inside, it's a breaching game where we encircle the entrances to B, flood it with grenades and find an opportunity to break in and raise hell. I love that the spawns dictate how we're going to play each game. Lastnight we set ourselves a new record by going 9-0 on Cauldron in 41 minutes.  :D"
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,CaptainGerrard,5,Mon Jul 20 22:35:59 2015 UTC,I completely agree. The only thing I could see happening is people complaining that the other team got the good spawn more times but it's better than getting the bad spawn every time I guess.

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,Seterath,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:55:11 2015 UTC,This I agree with. Different side off different movements and different play styles play into or against those. But a good team or player is very versatile and adapt to this.
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,Sethifer,6,Tue Jul 21 03:01:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree with OP. Certain spawns may feel better for certain builds.

All things being equal in a round of trials, the team that spawns on the ""best side"" controls the map and the zone.  Spawn flipping would alleviate this for asymmetrical maps.  When things aren't equal, spawning on the ""bad"" side can be overcome with superior tactics / aim / skill etc.  But the point here is to make the setting EQUAL to allow for skill from BOTH teams to be the determining factor."

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,PSN-McNutCase,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:26 2015 UTC,Widows court is balanced IMO. If you don't sprint straight for the sniper lanes the other side will beat you there no matter which spawn you get. Going to the stair lane? Bottom spawn can get there a fraction of a second before top spawn. Going up the middle lane? Top spawn can beat bottom spawn there by a fraction of a second. Those are the two most popular sniper lanes and you can beat out people camping them without too much trouble from either side.
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,JWiLL552,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"My group never had much trouble spawning low.  Typically the other team goes to snipe near the walkway close to A flag and scope down near the church. I didn't really find either team had a big advantage sniping there, when we were low it was easy to see their heads peeking out and take 1-2 out before rushing. We had more real estate to move around down below and maintain our sights on the walkway, so it could work to the low team's advantage.   More often though we'd push around towards the B flag and flank them from the side.   Spawning up top was a bit better but it wasn't a huge difference. Just depends how you approach it."

DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,AReditByAnyOtherName,2,Mon Jul 20 20:16:36 2015 UTC,Except I went 9-0 in trials  this past weekend on Cauldron and prayed for the A cap point spawn on the stairs because its easier to snipe from.  And it also only has three flank doors whereas if you have control of the throne room there are 5.
DestinyTheGame,3dz57y,ace2459,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:40 2015 UTC,None of that negates the fact the the final cap point spawns in that room. You can only snipe from the stairs if they leave that room. It's completely viable to hold it the entire game and it forces an attack/defend game where the defenders win by default. The extra entries are only a minor nuisance because there are only 3 opponents anyway.

All you posted was the heat maps for locations of where people went to most. What you really need is win rates for each spawn on each map.  At the end of the day, I think they put most of their more balanced maps in Trials because they had to account for over-time. You don't see maps like Blind Watch in Trials (although I do love that map) because OT flag placement would be incredibly one sided.  You take a look at one of the most successful games for PvP shooters (CS) and their competitive doesn't switch sides for a full 15 rounds."

DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,corrizzle,6,Tue Jul 21 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"Presumably the people complaining about this have actually used a fusion rifle.  I suspect they use them often.  It's somewhat of a mystery why they have not read the numbers that appear after every shot.  I guess they stack up because the shots are so close n succession, but, if you are using one for even a few minutes at least a few shots should be legible.  The complaint is common enough.  Bungie has taught us that yellow = crit, so I think they should follow through and make the FR crits yellow too."
DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,Obfuscasious,11,Tue Jul 21 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"That's because both of you are wrong and this is actually because you're hitting an enemy in a weakspot. Test this out: go to a dreg with a simple gun, like Word of Crota (turn off explosive rounds for a second). Hit it in the body and then in the face. Notice how the damage is three times higher? That's because after the 1.5x modifier for headshots that hand cannons have (test it out in the crucible if you don't believe me), there was a 2x multiplier making it a 3x multiplier in total because you hit the dreg in their weakspot.   Test it out with a fusion rifle. You'll do more damage with the headshot. That's because you hit their weakspot. Now take your guns to an enemy with a yellow healthbar. You will literally do half the damage in their faces. Hand cannons will do the expected 1.5x here and Fusion Rifles will do regular damage. Body shots will do the same damage on these enemies as on red bar enemies. Their weakspot has simply been removed.  Fusion Rifles and such just don't get critical damage."
DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,El_Giganto,4,Tue Jul 21 06:14:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing this up. Looked into it and found this thread among many, which had more info on what you were saying.   this is why Fusion Rifle ""headshots"" do double damage, but damage numbers show up as white. It's because Fusion Rifles do NOT have a precision multiplier, but when you hit a Dreg or Vandal in the head they have 50% armor reduction in that area, so it seems like a Fusion Rifle is doing ""precision"" damage when its multiplier is in fact 1.0x (ie nothing). -/u/ssnomar"

They're in a perfect spot right now after the last nerf where they're high risk, high reward... they can't challenge shotguns up close or sniper rifles at range, but they can be beastly somewhere in between as long as the player is proficient at using them. They have such a high skill gate though that most people are tossing them for either a shotgun or a sniper rifle, both of which are far easier to employ effectively. How is making this situation worse going to help them?  Quick-charging low impact fusions could use a buff as a shotgun counter and I'm glad they're doing that. But nerfing slow charging high impact, which are good at mid-range and the far edges of close range and are very risky due to the long charge time is exceptionally foolish."

With an unleveled fusion rifle in the crucible (and I don't even know what perks to reforge for yet), they are extremely potent. Shotguns outclass them now because they reach so far and don't require a charge up. Once the perk nerfs hit, shotguns threat range will decrease a hell of a lot, and fusion rifles will continue to be insanely powerful.  In PvE they are practically useless. They don't hit through cabal shields or hobgoblin immunities right? If they hit through those things, they would be perfect in PvE. Otherwise, bleh.

DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,Zenki_Dori,2,Tue Jul 21 00:00:59 2015 UTC,Fusion rifles need more range than shotguns otherwise they're just a shotgun that you need to precharge which makes them 200% obsolete.
DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,defnot_hedonismbot,-5,Tue Jul 21 00:11:55 2015 UTC,You are SO right good sir. By the time I've charged my fusion rifle the enemy has closed the gap & shotty'd me from my fusion rifles max range anyway :S
DestinyTheGame,3e0b1w,Th3Jez,5,Tue Jul 21 05:24:35 2015 UTC,"The only reason fusion rifles aren't being used currently is because shotguns are just so much better. Once they're balanced, fusion rifles will be very powerful."

DestinyTheGame,3e141q,Memnenth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"So what? They still counted to the weekly cap and it's a horrible exchange rate if you're doing it purely for that. I'm drowning in mats just from doing Wolves events, Judgement and Queens Wrath packages and have nothing to upgrade (literally every single exotic maxed out except the 2 I don't have yet).  I think it was 5 marks for 20 material? And currently we can get 20 material for 10 marks. That means if somebody were to trade all their weekly cap for the other kind, they can only gain 50 more total for the kind they were buying.  400 material for 100 marks which count to the weekly cap is no issue at all."

Blink, Increased Control, Double Jump, Triple Jump, and Catapult are all better, faster, easier to correct jumps. Glide is slow and cumbersome. If you like it, great. But when you play good players using better jumps you have to compensate for your shitty, slow maneuverability, and this is all I care about.  edit 2 - Guys. I know how to use a Warlock.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,csreid,6,Mon Jul 20 16:04:22 2015 UTC,I know that feel. Also switching from Gunslinger to Bladedancer is rough. Go to jump across an open space and time your second jump as if you were expecting to have one more... only to find you're gonna fall short of the ledge and there's nothing you can do about it.
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:22 2015 UTC,Bones exotic boots will help fix that problem for you really quick.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:41 2015 UTC,One day you'll get them. They are fun if nothing more than to abuse the extra jump to explore places you could never get to before.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,entropy512,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:10 2015 UTC,Where's the benefit of using the Ram w/ Sunsinger? Isn't the signature perk Void melees? Seriously interested as I passed on it for LBN last night...
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,4,Mon Jul 20 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"Because the Toughness bonus applies to either Voidwalker or Sunsinger. When you're running a full Toughness + Recovery build on any Warlock and you're wearing The Ram, you become the toughest build in the game. You can tank 2 head shots from Thorn without dying, you can tank 2 body shots from Praedyth's Revenge, and you can even tank Shoulder Charge.   When you use Radiance, even if you're using Fireborn instead of Radiant Skin, your toughness goes up even more. So much so that while Radiant you can tank a single Golden Gun hit. If you self-res and you immediately melee someone for Flame Shield, your toughness is just pure absurdity.   So yes, you sacrifice the Life Steal perk, but your all around survivability drastically increases."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"By toughness, do you mean armor? Am I correct in understanding that this toughness is not visually measured anywhere when changing armor pieces? I already run the highest armor/recovery build that has little agility. I don't recall the bars moving when changing any armor let alone the Ram"
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"Toughness is a stat that is affected by your skill tree choices, not your actual gear (with the exception of the Ram). With the Ram the bars won't change but the toughness very definitely goes up. A lot of people around here refer to Toughness as ""Armor"" but for obvious reasons that can become confusing, so I refer to it as Toughness, which is what the skill tree calls it.  In the skill tree itself as a Sunsinger you'd want to use Arcane Spirit (or Arcane Force) + Divine Order for a max Toughness build. When coupled with the Ram, this is where you'll see that difference."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"How is it confusing? In the perk tree, the 3 stats are in fact Armor, Recovery, and Agility. I'm only confused about whether this ""toughness"" is really armor or some other magical stat not measured... I simply read the perk on the Ram as a Voidwalker stat, so assumed the benefit came when using Voidwalker. I've never heard of an armor piece having any hidden benefits not explicitly stated in the perks."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"Hover over the perk on the tree itself and it in fact refers to it as ""toughness."" Look at it however you want; I'm not here for an argument. And if you don't believe me about the boost in toughness, read the posts I listed."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,FacelessGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"Im not arguing either, just asking clarifying questions how this benefit is measured as I've never heard of a hidden perk on an exotic armor piece, ask assumed if I wasn't using Void, I wouldn't receive whatever damage resistance was included that everybody raved about.  Toughness made it all the more confusing. Is this what you were looking for? http://imgur.com/cbWJ21x"
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,juniorvarsity33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Yes, it's referred to as Armor in that bar. The same stat is referred to as Toughness in the actual perk tree when you hover over a perk. I refer to it as Toughness instead of Armor simply because some people get confused about the Armor stat being affected by the armor they're wearing, which is never the case... except for with the Ram. I can see the confusion, though; sorry to have caused any difficulty."

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,sev7enty7,3,Mon Jul 20 16:58:10 2015 UTC,I started playing late (November) and in order to catch up to my group of friends I rolled a second warlock to gear up faster.

It's a pain in the ass."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,CitizenErased18,24,Mon Jul 20 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Waited 700 hours to create a second class. Mind blowing in retrospective. It really brought fresh life into the game for a while, when I desperately needed it."

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,Phunky_Phan,8,Mon Jul 20 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"should be 34 soon as Variks sells boots   Hit up ToO. You only need 6 wins to get an Etheric Light. If you purchase the 3 consumables, win your first game to get you to 3 wins. Then you only need 3 more wins and have 3 losses of grace to get those last 3 wins.  You could be 34 today if you did that."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,ZEBRAKAKEZ,4,Mon Jul 20 16:44:25 2015 UTC,Running 3 of the same class seems like a huge waste to me.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,robstak,3,Mon Jul 20 17:30:52 2015 UTC,A lot of people made same-class alts when everyone was grinding the VoG for a full set of gear. More characters of the same class meant more chances to finally get that helmet (or whatever). Bungie has pretty much alleviated this with the PoE by adding armor cores instead.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,Macc14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:46 2015 UTC,I have 2 hunters and a lock. Started with one hunter and got tired of not being able to buy xur things so I got another to 20 thru crucible and then just swap the gear. Lock is l33 so now I can do 2 without it. Just waiting for the time when I will be able to dedicate a couple hours to a titan so I can delete the second hunter. May as well run NF and weekly. I should do VoG and CE while I'm at it. Crap it's Monday again. May as well wait until after the reset and get more SC. Rinse repeat.
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,usmc2009,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"It was for power leveling and to get Raid sets faster. The Raids were setup to reward you with gear for the class you were playing. If you have 3 Titans (or Hunters or Warlocks) you can roll each raid 2 times a week per character (total of 6 rolls) for gear and weapons. If you get lucky you can have all the raid gear for your class in one week (if not lucky 2-3 weeks).  The downside is that engrams (Legendary and Exotic) have a 1/3 chance of decrypting for your class (2/3 for NOT your class). This is fine if you are playing all three classes because you have a 100% chance of decrypting something for a class you play - it may be a duplicate, but at least you can still shard and use the class material gained (if you shard an item not for your class it still shards out the associated class material; Warlock item > Warlock Class material, Hunter item > Hunter Class material, Titan item > Titan class material).  TL;DR - Play with mules and you may get boned on 2/3's of your gear."

When Xur sold icebreaker the first time and I missed out because I didn't have enough coins I said enough is enough. I made a second Hunter and leveled him up. When that was done I made a titan he's currently 32, last week I did my nightfalls and got a Ram on the first and Purifier Robes on the second. The next morning I carefully cleared everything off of 34 Hunter #2 and deleted him (with something like 600 spirit bloom in tow. Thanks ether chests!) I made a shiny new warlock and yesterday hit 30 with him. There is no one best class they are still fantastic and fun as hell in their own ways."
DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,macanudo14,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:06 2015 UTC,I also missed out on Icebreaker due to lack of coins and was so gutted (still waiting ;_; ). Quit for a while and just came back a few weeks ago. Just made char No. 2 (a titan) and was happy to be getting a few extra coins each week (actually the first week I've managed to get the 6). Didn't even occur to me until literally this thread to just make another hunter and move over all the gear for an easy extra 9 coins. ¬_¬

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,MeanKareem,9,Mon Jul 20 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"I think having your main as a hunter makes it easier to play the other classes, but doesn't work as well the other way.

Titans can support a team best, but warlocks can self-res and generate nearly unlimited orbs in the abyss (with Obsidian Mind + Nova Bomb).

Ive got him lvl 26 now but still need to max out his Gunslinger class.  Ivde noticed that with a Hunter that its a completely different playing style.  With my Titan I could kind of rush in and run / gun / charge.  But with the Hunter you need to plan your attack more and jump placements. Cant wait to get the Bladedancer leveled.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,DestinyReddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:48 2015 UTC,I had three titans because I was forever 29 until TDB dropped. I have been hording warlock and hunter exotics and finally got around to starting the other two classes. I should have done this since the beginning. Playing all these classes helps me enjoy the repetition of the game it also helps me narrow down what guns to keep. I store all exotic weapons in the vault and have purple weapons specific to their class. (high recoil weapons= Hunter because of gunslingers trance for example)

I have since deleted two and rolled a hunter and a titan and it was the best decision I ever made. All three are so unique from each other, especially in PvP. Most importantly though our raid group now has more options when we need to build out the team with specific skills. Being the guy with 3 warlocks wasn't helpful when you need a titan."

I made the mistake of creating and part-levelling all 3 classes within the first couple of weeks of release and I think I missed out on some of the magic of becoming seriously good with one, and then trying my hand at another. I was used to all 3 classes before I'd hit level 20 with one and I feel like I missed out slightly :/  Wont be making that mistake with the new sub-classes!"

I deleted the warlock and built a hunter (with intent to eventually delete a titan and remake the warlock).  It's so awesome blade-dancing/golden-gunning!  Also, enjoy delving into the Striker sub-class.  Hardly anything in this game is as satisfying as shoulder-charging (especially in PvP)."

Ages ago (5 months), I was having the worst luck in the world with my Warlock running Crota, and could not get the boots to drop, so I was a forever 31 for the longest time. HM Crota was quickly approaching and with how overly concerned LFG can be with being max light, I was like 2 or 3 weeks away from the release so I created a 2nd Warlock... and then a 3rd. I must have run Crota close to 10 times before FINALLY getting the boots to drop. After months of playing with only Warlocks (x3), I deleted 2 and made 1 of each other class and those next couple of weeks were some of the most enjoyable experiences that I had with this game."

The things that are messing with my head: the differences in jumps and the drastically different melee ranges.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,OtterJethro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with this wholeheartedly, as I've been maintaining three different guardians since around the time of TDB release. While Warlock is still my main, simply because I enjoy it the most, I find switching between classes very gratifying, if for no other reason than I can relate to teammates who are playing either of the other two.   Imagine a Destiny where you could only have one character: the community would split up into groups based on their chosen class, and no one would have any real way to relate to the other groups. Having the ability to play all three is, IMO, one reason why this community is so overall friendly and wonderful. Sometimes it doesn't seem like it, but Bungie really knows what they're doing when it comes to subtle intricacies of gaming.

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,krisbaird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"Best part of playing all three classes is understanding each classes strengths/weaknesses in PvP.   I started with a titan and would complain about how OP hunters and warlocks were in PvP. Then after rolling one of each, and throwing a nova bomb into a wall or get sniped after popping golden gun, you learn to respect each class.  I've gone flawless with each class and really feel like the only part of a class that could be consider OP in PvP is the warlock's melee range and shield-on-hit with flame shield.   Other than that, the game (from a class perspective) feels pretty balanced. Well, I guess Warlock firebolt with viking funeral and burn is pretty gross too. Oh and the Ram, lol."

They unanimously said to pick whichever I liked the most and not to worry because I would eventually start the other two. So from the start I kind of had it in my mind that I was eventually going to have all three. I got my main to 31 (during TDB era) and then started my first alt. When HoW came out I got both to 32, then started my last one and leveled all three to 34 in the first month. Then I started leveling specific load outs (PVP, Crota, VOG, etc).   I was worried that it was going to be a chore, but to be honest the only drag was having to go though the story two more times. Now I just pick and choose which content I want to do each week with each character. I don't worry much about bounties unless they are to level a new armor piece or weapon. It really isn't much more work after they are max level. Nightfall x3 is 45 mins-1 hour and you don't NEED to do all the raids on each character. I just armor hunt or help buddies for fun."

I have purple boots, a number of exotics, and two armor cores saved for Variks as soon as we reach 20 (later this week).  It gives you a fresh feel for the game that's for sure.

For me it's always pick up groups via r/fireteams which are usually 1 hit experiences. I've yet to do the higher level PoE for any of the 3 of them.  My Titan is bae though, I just can't stop playing him all the time. Exo for life. <3    Would recommend having all 3 classes to anyone reading this. The only issue I had for ages is choosing the race/sex combo for them all. Would like to change the facepaint on the Titan (Exo Male) and the face/hair of the hunter (Human Female).

DestinyTheGame,3dxzvf,CarpathianUK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:03 2015 UTC,I'm on the opposite end here. I've had three hunters since launch and never really wanted to play another class. I recently deleted my third hunter and leveled a voidwalker warlock up to 29 and maxed that tree. I hated how slow he was and glide is just unbearable. The special is nice though. I decided to start on sunslinger and halfway through I still wasn't feeling it so I deleted him and recreated my third hunter again. At least this way I won't be stuck in mud and I have my double jump back. I would have probably kept him longer if he had double jump. I may try Titan at some point.

That was cool for a while, until about 2 weeks before HoW, and I killed 2 hunters to roll a brand new titan and warlock, leveled them, and reached 34 on all 3 characters not long after the release of HoW.

DestinyTheGame,3e2vze,haynick31,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"With thorn I would assume that each shot applies its own dot, and you can have up to 5 dots running at once. Not so much that each shot makes the dot do more, its that multiple dots can do damage at the same time"
DestinyTheGame,3e2vze,xXDeadmiceXx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"It's all speculation so far since the patch has not been released yet, but personally I think that hardlight's round will suffer from damage drop off but once they have bounced they no longer count distance traveled and therefore don't loose anymore damage. As far as thorn, I believe it means that 2 shots will have the dot tick for 2x damage, 3 times will do 3x damage and so on up to five shots."

That just means everything up to that point gets rolled into a single release.  It's neither new nor novel to Destiny, I remember picking up GoTY editions of games a decade ago.  The 3rd subclass thing was there from the start, every class starts with 3 spots although we only have two right now.  The rumor then was that Bungie had planned a 3rd class but ""couldn't do it and didn't remove the code"" or some other excuse, which was about as believeable as the Tooth Fairy."

DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,gnikeltrut,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"not having room doesn't make something broken, it creates a necessity to free up space.  Which is why I think if we have all 4 we should be able to forge it into an all in one piece for the PoE."

DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,PotatoBomb69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:05 2015 UTC,"But its not broken, broken would be if the armor gives you an agility boost and you do not get that, broken would be how the thorn is right now or the sniper shotguns.

That's not how the system works right now, though. My suggestion works within the system and allows you to save vault space and still get all the benefits.   Since the armor all looks the same for each class, no matter whether it has Vex/Hive/Fallen/or Cabal bonuses, having just one of each is optimal.   The great thing about the game is, though, that if you think this suggestion is bogus and want to wait for a feature that might never be implemented, you can (if you have the space for the armor).   Enjoy the game the way you want to."
DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,Bu11etToothBdon,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:28 2015 UTC,I re-read and understand a little better now. They need to do something to limit how much armor we are having to carry around.  I have most of the exotics sitting in the vault because of armor that will become irrelevant come september.
DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,J_Dubya01,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"No worries.   Here's something to consider, though - Bungie leaves a great part of the choice in the game (which armor to use, which weapons to equip, etc.) up to the players. Granted, balancing weapons can take some of the fun out of the things we choose, but by and large, they're trying to make the game playable long term, not short term.   Keeping things in the vault because they might be irrelevant 'someday' overlooks the fact that they could be used, with complete relevance, today.   Why keep and not use something for two months because you've heard it will be worthless? No one has yet seen any proof HOW worthless the weapons may be after the changes. We might even like the changes. No one can say right now unless they test the game for Bungie.  What's the point of waiting in fear of changes based on hints we've been given? (I say hints because I couldn't tell you the in-game difference between a 1 and a 3% nerf or boost to any weapon's damage percentages.)  I say: enjoy what you have, today."
DestinyTheGame,3e37dn,dregpride,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"I was talking more about being relevant for year 2 of destiny, not the nerf.  I dont see destiny letting us ascend old material from year 1 to year 2.  I think its going to be a kind of fresh start reset.  They could suprise everyone thought and let us bring weapons and armor over.  But if thats the case the game will never change, PvE will still be fatebringer/Vision, and ghally."

When I heard it was going to be removed in HoW, I had read a lot of praise about it, so I ground out Crucible marks and New Monarchy rep to buy one literally the day before HoW dropped.  TBH I've found it very underwhelming, and not just in the sense that all auto rifles are at the moment. It's decently stable for a high impact AR, but only has 22 rounds in the magazine, which is by far the lowest I've seen."

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Saemika,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"The first V8 was great. Max stability and outlaw make it a headshot machine. Just reload after ever kill, and you can shoot anything you see with a great impact."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,DarkSunRider,0,Tue Jul 21 15:41:25 2015 UTC,"The good (and unique) thing about Vanquisher is that even though it has a very small 22-round clip, you also have Spray and Play, which speeds up reload when the mag is empty. You pretty much keep shooting until the clip is empty and the reload is so fast that you can almost keep aiming down the sights to keep dishing out the damage. Used correctly, it's almost like having an auto rifle version of Bad Juju because there's only a slight delay in dishing out the hurt."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Mastershroom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:24:02 2015 UTC,Spray & Play isn't unique though; you can do that with literally any gun that has it. And having a small magazine doesn't make it better; reload speed (for the same gun) is the same regardless of mag size.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,DarkSunRider,0,Tue Jul 21 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"Spray and Play isn't unique in and of itself of course, but having it paired with an auto rifle with such a small magazine is a big boon that compensates for it. I'm used to reloading after every kill, but if I don't use up over half the clip in getting a kill, I'll not reload until my next encounter because the reload speed is such that there is only a split second between the barrage of bullets I'm shooting.  To take advantage of the gun's perks (and to compensate for the small clip), you have to change the way you're used to using your weapons, and that is unique."

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,yolostrat,7,Tue Jul 21 01:48:56 2015 UTC,Haha. I like your correct plural use here :)
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,fifty1point2,17,Tue Jul 21 02:03:16 2015 UTC,"Isn't it technically Pest Control Matrixes here though, since ""Pest Contol Matrix"" is a proper noun? You don't have more than one matrix, you have more than one Pest Control Matrix. You're pluralizing the entire proper noun and not just the ""matrix."" (Sort of like if I had 30 He-Man action figures, I wouldn't say, ""I have 30 He-Men,"" I would say, ""I have 30 He-Mans."")  Could be wrong, of course, but I don't think that's how the pluralization works in this instance."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,LustHawk,5,Tue Jul 21 03:53:03 2015 UTC,"""30 He-Mans"" sounds seriously wrong.  As a writing major I would just avoid the problem by writing ""I have 30 He-Man figures"""

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,SovereignPaladin,7,Tue Jul 21 07:01:05 2015 UTC,If it's an even buff High impact will still be inferior to the 88 RoF ARs like Low Down P-XIV.  I would shy away from high impact ARs unless you have 0 skill at controlling recoil
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,TravisBewley,4,Tue Jul 21 00:11:08 2015 UTC,High impact auto rifles were always originally better I thought compared to the auto rifles with a tick mark of impact and maxed rof bar.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,SovereignPaladin,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"But post patch they are far below in TTK and DPS, as they should because they require 0 skill"
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,pm_me_ur_weird_pms,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:22 2015 UTC,But they are being buffed again so I would think they are going back to best because the buff looks bigger than the nerf they originally received in terms of pure damage.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,SovereignPaladin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:13 2015 UTC,"People keep referring to ""the"" AR nerf. There were two, and a third that hit Suros only."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,fizzguy47,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:26 2015 UTC,Ya...I know but wasn't one purely for range and the other for damage or am I mistaken? It was so long ago now.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,TravisBewley,2,Tue Jul 21 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"Man, SUROS with FF used to crit for 60 damage. That was seriously OP."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,SovereignPaladin,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"The Nerf originally didn't effect low impact ARs much. I think this sounds less like reverting the nerfs but rather an even buff, which would have high impacts with the lowest dps still as it should be because they are so easy to use"
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,TravisBewley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:50 2015 UTC,I was reading the weekly update from bungie and they didn't give a percentage number of how much auto rifles are getting buffed but if it's percentage based at all that alone would make high impact auto rifles automatically better since they would get a larger damage increase due to how percentages work.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,SovereignPaladin,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"No, because rate of fire is factored in. Percentage won't favor any type. The results are mearly proportional"
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,Beezneezman,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"?  the whole reason low impact autos werent affected much by the nerf was because the damage was reduced by a percentage so vice versa would be true as well for a buff.  If a 100 damage auto rifle gets a 10% buff that would  put it at 110 damage but then the 10 damage auto rifle would only do 11. Now look which got the bigger increase, or in the case of a nerf which would get a bigger reduction.  Unless you are saying fire rate is getting changed too."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,WormholeMage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:01 2015 UTC,"You can say one wasn't affected as much but before I got a vex mythoclast I used atheons epilogue and that thing shredded people. It turned into garbage. So let's just say all auto rifles got hurt, because ""barely affected"" doesn't quite describe a top tier weapon turning into complete garbage."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,TravisBewley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:56 2015 UTC,If a 100 damage auto rifle gets a 10% buff that would put it at 110 damage but then the 10 damage auto rifle would only do 11.   But dps of both rifles increased by the same 10%.
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,ConnorWolf121,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:40:32 2015 UTC,"The Nerf was mainly with high impact ARs, low impacts where hardly touched. Befor the nerfs high impacts had better dps after the nerf high RoF have better dps."

DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,BluBlue4,5,Tue Jul 21 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"I don't get why everyone's bent on not getting a year 2 ""ascension."" Bungie will probably introduce some sort of ascension method otherwise the 250+ legendary/exotic weapons currently in the game would be rendered obsolete which would be a huge mistake. With current knowledge TK will only bring in 50 or so new weapons and that's not nearly enough. The game will become mundane and boring because of the lack of weapon choice. Also, think about this: What's the point of giving xbox players the ps exclusives if they're going to be underpowered? Calm down, your gjallarhorns and thorns will still be around for the next year or so."
DestinyTheGame,3e08xr,StarfighterProx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:28 2015 UTC,Very few doubt that exotics won't be ascended it's that legendary items might not be. You couldn't ascend them in HoW.

I remember that when I ADSed on Sepiks I did full damage when he was at the back of the room. When I didn't ADS it did much less.

Little problem with stability with its buff, huge amount of AA and higher damage than other guns in its class due to Aggressive Ballistics. It appeals to CQB/Close Quarters design. It won't be a nerf for those who use it like that. Just make up for its shorter overall effective range with a Sniper Rifle.  Edit: Its generally how I use it. And in a closed environment-its double bounce projectiles will be amazingly dangerous. Really puts me in the mindset of ""Tactical Spaces"" referenced in its flavor text.  2nd Edit: Also, it may be inconsistent-but its a exotic. Does it HAVE to fit into the mold whatsoever? Would make the gun more unique actually."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,evilparker,3,Tue Jul 21 14:20:47 2015 UTC,How i read it is just that the AR range nerf wont affect the Hard Light
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,deeleed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, that probably only ricocheted projectiles will be exempt from damage falloff... But it's worded in such a way that it could mean all projectiles.  I don't think Hard Light would be OP at sniper range with no damage falloff though. Have you tried to hit something far away with any consistency using a high RoF auto rifle? Good luck."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,mat_b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's ambiguous. Bungie seems to be good at ambiguous, despite authoring excellent lore. Plus they just sometimes completely leave out certain things, like Khepri's Sting DoT on invis-melees, Thunderlord's version of Firefly, and so on.  So we'll have to wait and see to REALLY know, but what caught me is that it mentions ""projectiles"" when first talking about ricochet rounds.  And yeah it wouldn't be OP if I'm wrong, but it would be the best AR in the game pretty much. I don't see why we'd use Suros over it. Granted the new Nechrochasm would be good too, but still. If it didn't have infinite range for ALL shots, the other ARs would still have a point."
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,killzy707,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:33 2015 UTC,"Full damage of a single Hard Light projectile is not that high, it will still remain visibly unstable. It is still the low impact/high RoF profile"
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,wileykyoto,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:36 2015 UTC,"How I read it is that it will have a max range, but the damage will always be 100% and not gradually reduce the further you are from the target"
DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,Thomasedv,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"You're focusing so much on the wording but the only reason they say projectiles is because it doesn't fire rounds like most guns. It's ionized polymer according to the grimoire. Replace ""projectiles"" with ""bullets"" and it's pretty clear that all rounds will be unaffected by damage dropoff, not just bounced ones."

DestinyTheGame,3e2l4r,Tower_Guardian,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what they meant by it and what they intend to do, their wording absolutely implies all projectiles, not just bounced ones, will not be affected by damage falloff.  ""Increase bounce count for Hard Light projectiles"" Here, bounce count implies bounce percentage, in which case this sentence reads: ""Increase bounce percentage for Hard Light Projectiles"" So the number of bullets bounced is equal to the percentage (in decimal form) multiplied by the number of bullets shot. Where bullets shot are referred to as projectiles. Therefore, the sentence ""Hard Light projectiles are not affected by Damage Falloff"" is referring to all projectiles.  Any other interpretation, by bungie, is a willful misinterpretation. As you've pointed out, it wouldn't be the first time this has happened, but I think it's pretty clear what those points imply."
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,Ninja--Panda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:23 2015 UTC,Also rare drop in nightfall and u can purchase one at rank 3/5 of IB Yes Her benevolence is a good pvp sniper. Her mercy is also a good pvp and pve handcannon if you dont have a tier 1 primary. Matador and Party Crasher are both tier 1 shotguns that drop in crucible. Shot package and range boosters. Not in my opinion. Too low of a drop. Queen faction isnt that great. You get one guaranteed a week.
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,tswafford95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"1) PoE 34/35 as well as Night Fall  2) You can use EL whenever to get a quick boost on armor. No reason to wait until it's fully upgraded.  3) Queens weapons are, meh. They are definitely not great when compared to many PvP weapons or raid weapons. ToO weapons, aside from Messenger, are close to garbage. Some can be re-rolled to something semi-decent but there's many other better solutions  4) Depends on your play style but there are many guns the vendors sell that when re-rolled, are very effective. Shotguns mainly stick to Matador or Party Crasher +1 if you don't have a Felwinter's Lie.  5) The chest is really only worth it THE FIRST TIME you open it per character. Beyond that, just need a key for the PoE 35 chest as you get ship and emblem from it. Also needed for completing the Exotic Bounty quest line.  6) Make some friends, be a friendly guardian. Become legend."
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,haynick31,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"1 - No, it drops on POE 34 and 35.  TOO higher packages.  Random from nightfall as a reward.  Possibly iron banner?  2 - You would think this would be the case but Variks sells a 34 armor piece every week.  You can easily be 34 very quickly.  I would personally do weapons first and just grab the variks armor with an armor core from 32 but that is me.  3 - Queens weapons, imo, are not that good.  4 - I don't reroll so I can't help you here.  Hopscotch pilgrim is the hot weapon atm though.  5 - You are almost guaranteed an exotic for the first big chest you open with a character.  After that it is rng.  You get 1 key per week per account for the first queens bounty you turn in so farming is up to you.  I would not waste too much time on it personally.  6 - POE 32 for the armor cores to get your characters to 34"
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,phatoriginal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"1: Nightfalls and some ToO rewards, IDK which.  2: Yes. Level before weapons.  3: There are a few good ones, like Wolves Leash, but yes overall, ToO is generally better.  4: Hopscotch Pilgrim, Party Crasher, Matador, and Ash Factory come to mind.  All drop from Crucible except Hopscotch, which can drop from Dragon strikes.  5: Not really.  First for the character for the exotic, but you should really only use it on 35 otherwise.  Just always have a few in case."
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,Renegade284,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"By all means:  1) Not quite, you can also get it in Iron Banner, Nightfall Strikes and Trials of Osiris.  2) Generally yes, as the level & defence stat gains are worth more than the attack rating gains on weapons. Obviously once you have one toon at 34, you might like to give them a couple of 365 weapons for higher level work before you start leveling your other characters.  3) I would disagree ever so slightly (although it depends on what else you have). Certainly ToO weapons (particularly the Adept ones) are excellent, but they are hard to get, so you might want to work your way up. For instance, Her Benevolence (Queens Sniper) is an excellent little weapon for PvP work and has been very prevalent in Trials so is worth a look (even if it is a ghastly pink colour...), plus the Vestian Dynasty is just a lot of fun, so get that if only to play with (its basically a Star Trek Phase Pistol, I mean, - come on...!).  4) To re-roll...likely a decent Rocket Launcher. I like Radegasts Fury re-rolled (or dropped) with Tripod, Javelin & Grenades & Horseshoes/TRacking. Good sniper (see Her Benevolence above) re-rolled with something like Hidden Hand, Quickdraw and Unflinching would be helpful, or a nice shotgun with range and impact boost perks.  5) Well...if you do a Queens bounty you are guaranteed one key per week, and you sometimes get extras. After a few runs of PoE you will find you have a bunch of Queens weapons, & your initial guaranteed (ish) Exotic weapons and after a few patrols you will have a bunch of keys (they won't stack beyond 5) so you might decide it isn't worth farming for...  6) Cookies are awesome, you should eat more cookies.   (Sorry, long day....;-))"
DestinyTheGame,3e320n,Denaius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"1) EL has a 100% drop chance from a Level 34 or 35 PoE completion. It also has a chance to drop from nightfalls and you can buy 2 EL for 5000 glimmer each once you hit ranks 3 and 5 of Iron Banner (that's 1 at R3 and another at R5)  2) I would probably agree with this, however it is sort of preference. I couldn't help upgrading fatebringer as soon as I got the chance.  3) ToO weapons are the best from the HoW expansion. Previous raid weapons from VoG and CE are far superior to the PoE weapons in literally all cases (I never run PoE L32 anymore its pointless)  4) There are some re-rolls worth getting on certain weapons, you may choose these over raid weapons in certain circumstances. E.g. a Radegast's Fury with Tripod + G&H is a far better PvP RL than Hunger of Crota (Radegast's Fury with the above roll is the best RL in the game besides Ghallarhorn, HoC is way overrated)  5) A treasure key gives you the chance to open the big chest at the end of a PoE, giving you a chance at an Exotic, queens weapons and other stuff. There is the same exotic drop chance from the big chest whether you complete L28 or L35 PoE. So, yes they are useful for an easy chance at an exotic, but they aren't particularly worth farming anymore.  6) Are you on PS4? feel free to add me and drop me a message if so,"

DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,weasel-king68,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:46 2015 UTC,"Do a search on headseeker. Another redditor did the math and found it wasn't worth the slot. Basic summary is that Messenger and Hopscotch have such a tight recoil pattern and with perks awesome stability, you're doing yourself a disservice trying to hit the body and climb your shots to the head to activate Headseeker. You're better off just aiming to get all three rounds from your burst to hit the head from the start and Hidden hand will help you do that.  I never really gave the 55AllFate a go because I was lucky enough to get a Messenger, but I'm looking to re-roll one now since I can't reroll the Messenger perks. I'm not sure if 55AllFate can 2 burst kill though."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,starkyiron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:52 2015 UTC,I believe the ALLFATE can be a 2BK depending on how armoured the guardian you're fighting is although I might be wrong. What roll of perks would you suggest then since Headseeker is a wasted slot?
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,starkyiron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like there's a misconception around headseeker. The point isn't to try to proc it, because it results in less damage. It's more of an insurance policy, because on a high impact pulse rifle, headseeker will save the 2 burst kill if you get five headshots instead of six. On an allfate though, it isn't worth it since it will usually be a 3 burst kill."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,starkyiron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:56 2015 UTC,"I'm some situations yeah, although both are good"

Secret Round makes up for the mag hit you take from Braced Frame (27 to 21). I don't know why I don't use it more but it's a PvP nightmare of a weapon."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,Dok_Industrial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:29 2015 UTC,"That roll sounds pretty strong, how long roughly did it take you to get it? How does it fare in PvE?"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,Dok_Industrial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:14 2015 UTC,"I bought it from the Vanguard and it turned into that on the very first roll. RNG is unfathomable.  It's actually pretty good in PvE due to it's good range, secret round and laser stability. It's just as home pumping lead into a yellow bar as it is clearing trash."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,Dok_Industrial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, I like your description! How do you feel about Hidden Hand in replacement of Secret Round? The only issue I feel with this is you potentially lose 2 bursts with no way of recovering them. Alternatively, Hand-Laid Stock+Rangefinder?"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,3,Tue Jul 21 12:48:06 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about Secret Round: with 27 rounds and no Secret Round you get 9 bursts. If you have 21 (due to Braced Frame) and you don't miss (which you shouldn't, because Braced Frame) you actually get 10.5 bursts. Pulse Rifles always get either Truesight IS or Sureshot IS which both increase aim assist quite a bit, so for a mid-impact gun like Allfate I would shy away from Hidden Hand.   In PvP it's a sometimes 2 burst kill (which is about to get harder after the balance patch) but a guaranteed 3 burst, as long as 1 or 2 bullets (not bursts, single bullets) are headshots. A gun like Hopscotch Pilgrim, which has a larger mag and guaranteed 2 burst potential, should favor Hidden Hand to double down on the the 2 burst potential. Something like Allfate is a bit more of a run and gun style weapon due to the fact you can't guarantee a 2 burst kill. Secret Round will help keep you in the fight longer without having to reload.  Hand Laid Stock and Rangefinder means you're trying to use it like a marksman rifle, which you can totally do, but the fact that it's likely to be a 3 burst at those ranges means your time to kill will be lower anyway. I think Allfate is more comfy at the mid-range and slightly beyond - think just outside Red Death range. Just far enough away that they can't reliably 2 burst you but you can laser beam their heads. Something like Hand Laid and Rangefinder would be nightmarish on Hopscotch but I'd still take Braced Frame and Hidden Hand for it.  Sorry, that was long"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:07 2015 UTC,No this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for so don't apologise! I like your reasoning behind each decision so thank you for providing the information. I really appreciate it :)
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:02 2015 UTC,No problem man
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:49 2015 UTC,"Nice breakdown, Helped me out for sure :)"
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,PitFighterPlus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'm rolling Feeding Frenzy, Reactive Reload, and Smallbore, and I have nothing but good to say about it--you're getting the quick kill from a significant range, which then leads to a high speed reload and higher damage (which leads to quicker kills, and keeps the cycle running).   This setup is pretty much ""perfect"" for ANY of the current pulse rifles people are chasing to reroll.  If you're looking for similar setups, here are the perk substitutions you can implement:   Feeding Frenzy can be subbed with Outlaw (faster reload, but you MUST get the headshot kill...RR allows you a margin of error which I'm not afraid of saying I prefer)  Headseeker can be subbed for Reactive Reload (the damage bonus is always available, but again...entirely reliant on the headshot)  Braced Frame can be subbed for Smallbore (your Stability goes through the roof, but you're looking at a 6 bullet reduction in your magazine, which may not be feasible for some of the guns)."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,winguardianleveyosa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:22 2015 UTC,This is the sort of thing I was looking for with my ALL-FATE so I may try and roll this. Do you have any idea how long it took you to get this roll? It sounds pretty strong.
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:00 2015 UTC,"I think I got this roll fairly quickly, but that was pure luck.  Having the alternate options for perks as I listed makes it a lot easier, but I'd make sure you still have plenty of weapon parts & motes on hand if RNGesus decides to be fickle."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"Well it took me like 40 rerolls just to get a Shot Package Matador. On the other hand I got a Dragons Breath on my first Nightfall, and I got Fatebringer+Found Verdict in my first VoG hard mode, so we'll see which side of the coin RNGesus decides to land on this time haha."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:18 2015 UTC,Also how do you feel about replacing Reactive Reload with Secret Round? Is that plausible?
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,bigga29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"Secret Round isn't a one-for-one swap for Reactive Reload; you won't be accomplishing the same thing.  SR saves you a round if/when you land a full burst; RR increases damage after a kill.    SR is absolutely workable.  However, If you're looking to push damage potential I'd suggest reroll."
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,YoWutupthischris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:09 2015 UTC,What do you mean by 'I'd suggest reroll'? I'm going to have to reroll the weapon to get the best perks anyway right? Or am I missing something?
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,YoWutupthischris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:17 2015 UTC,"Well, not everyone may want to incessantly reroll a weapon just because someone else tells them.  Some people prefer Full Auto on a shotgun over Shot Package; others may find a Hidden Hand/Icarus hand cannon to be preferable to the Final Round/Luck In The Chamber ""mini Hawkmoon"" people say is the ""best"".   I'm simply allowing for playstyle and personal preference."

DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,mrellenburg,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:10 2015 UTC,Hello again friend from another thread haha. Someone else suggested something very similar (with Smallbore instead of Braced Frame) so I'm thinking of rolling something very similar.
DestinyTheGame,3e29jt,mrellenburg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Smallbore as of the moment due to it taking mah ammo. But with the base increase to ammo coming up for PR's, it is also a great choice. XD"

Hopefully it'll be a top pick in the future.

DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Anedim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:56 2015 UTC,All I've ever heard is that they come in engrams. If you can actually get them as just endscreen rewards that's amazing. But the drop rate needs to be increased a little. At least to level 28 strike level.
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,knockoutking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:24:46 2015 UTC,Are you sure it was from a tiger strike? because Planetdestiny confirmed you can only get armor engrams from a tiget strike now and I've personally done about 100+ of them in the last couple weeks without a single weapon engram.

I needed shards so as I got VoG armour I dismantled the corresponding armour piece for the final upgrade.   I would definitely like to get it back but farming the engrams is just so inconsistent. If they simply added tdb and vanilla armour and gear to the old strike loot tables I'd be beyond happy."

DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,ruisranne,26,Tue Jul 21 04:55:11 2015 UTC,"Someone did the maths just this week I think. You CAN get  vanilla legendary armor from the Tiger strikes, but it would take approximately 10,000 games to get the exact piece of armor you want.  They would need to MASSIVELY increase the drop rate."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,ruisranne,2,Mon Jul 20 12:21:25 2015 UTC,hows the drop rate in general?
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,APhanpy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"Not great. Nowhere near as good as the current 28 strikes  I've played about 20 or so 24 strikes recently and I've no vanilla drops, other than blues"
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Wendys_frys,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"600+ vanguard marks worth of runs (2 weeks, 3x characters max vanguard marks each week) and zero reward screen legendary drops."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Wendys_frys,23,Tue Jul 21 12:09:22 2015 UTC,"See, this has been requested before to have the old vanguard armor back in some way, but I like this suggestion probably the best. Just having a vendor selling them cheapens it, but if you'd have to run these strikes, then those who really do want the old look and have a motivation to grind for them, they can do so.  A lot of these kind of suggestions here just ask for an easy way to get old stuff (or any stuff in general, having a vendor), but like everything else in this game, you should need to play to get them.  As for weapons, that is trickier, and a part of me hopes that at least our current legendary gear would become irrelevant as year 2 goes on, so no more ascending. Because as of now, we look at the weapon buffs/nerfs with the knowledge of those weapons and the perks of the weapons we currently have, but we know next to nothing what the new weapons will be like and how these buffs and nerfs are going to affect them."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,foursy,8,Mon Jul 20 10:07:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, weapons would be tricky. If it was up to me, I'd put them on the loot table, but I'd make them have a lower drop rate than armor.   And yes, it's going to be tough going into TTK blind, while trying to figure out the game plan for something like this.   What I wouldn't give to use a Shadow Price or The Devil You Know again though..."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,QBNR,2,Mon Jul 20 10:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, I really do miss my Shadow Price, I truly felt a sting in my heart when I dismantled it way back when.

We will need to leave them behind at some point anyway.  There are other games out there if you don't want a yearly reset. (Such a great argument btw.)

If you want evidence of which strategy is better for the community, compare TDB to HoW reception.  Both were tried, and the results were quite clear.  Fortunately it looks like Bungie is taking that to heart, the balance priorities for all weapons, including the originals, is an admission they're staying relevant."

DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,BlueNinja5,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"I've complained about this numerous times on forums yet always got downvoted. Heck Blades of Crota should be a thing also. I am unable to do bounties and doing them will be a grindfest. Mix that with unobtainable items from vendors and missing queen's Guard armor, marks, bonds, and cloaks from Petra and know we have unobtainable year 1 items, a glass of regret, and the most limiting vault space ever. Bad move Bungie, bad move, now explain yourself."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Needless_Hatred,2,Mon Jul 20 13:29:14 2015 UTC,You can still do the Blades of Crota bounty by playing the Fist of Crota mission. Just hop on your sparrow and drive past the whole first encounter until you see 3 acolytes summoning a blade of crota. Kill him and restart the mission. It takes less than 2 minutes per kill. Some other bounties take longer than that.  I do totally agree though that the blades should spawn like wolves though. I miss that.
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,Needless_Hatred,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely did not enjoy Wolves as a low level player though. They really like spawning near story mission objectives...  But it does feel nice being finally able to fight them, even if I do terrible damage because I'm 3 levels under ._."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,TotalHavok,3,Tue Jul 21 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"Putting the appropriate legendaries into the strike playlists would be great. To take this a step further, it would be very good to have the Tiger and Roc playlists get the increased chance of legendary gear that the Dragon strikes have. I’m not exactly sure what you have to do to get a legendary in Dragon, but it almost looks as if the player with the most kills usually gets it. If that is applied to the Tiger and Roc playlists that drop vanilla and TDB gear respectively, then those playlists would serve as a great way to ‘earn’ some of the old gear, instead of having a vendor.  And just to put it out there, since it’s been asked for a couple times just this weekend, a higher-level playlist with a random modifier. This would become the ‘Heroic Playlist,’ and be an early endgame feature, like the Weekly Heroic and Weekly Nightfall strikes. Just like the weekly strikes, the Heroic Playlist would increase in level with each expansion. It could start out at level 30 now, and go up from there. For rewards, slightly increased chances of legendaries & exotics from what the Dragon playlist offers, more XP & Vanguard rep/marks and a bit of what the weekly strikes have, such as a few strange coins or motes(more than the one coin/mote that is currently awarded).  The normal playlists are a step up to endgame content, so changing Dragon to have modifiers takes away from that. Let players keep working their way up with the normal playlists, and then the Heroic Playlist can give endgame players more to do."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,VitalNormal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:44:00 2015 UTC,"it almost looks as if the player with the most kills usually gets it   Really? Because I was playing fast and loose yesterday while dying quite a bit and definitely not getting the most kills and it almost seems as if the person who does the worst gets it. I dropped several legendary engrams and a few legendary weapons drops while I watched my teammates get nothing but blues. I think it's safe to say it's just RNG man, there is no rhyme or reason."

Hopefully these manufacturers will rotate stock too.  How I see it work is that the faction vendors will sell a token for a chest piece, for example, and then you will go to whatever manufacturer you want and buy a chest piece from them via the token.  Each manufacturer will have unique perks/traits so you'll be able to customize your load out better.  So factions will become just a means to get the tokens and stuff like shaders/ships and emblems rather than ""you have to roll dead orbit because they sell the best shotgun"" like it is now."

I suppose unique ships are kind of cool too.  Do weapons from previous stock drop from these?   EX: ROC strike can give you a different roll on LDR 5001  I've heard people say those weapons drop, and others who said they don't. I choose to put my time into running Nightfall -> Raid -> Trials/PvP over grinding strikes to find out due to having a limited amount of time available to play.  I've looked up loot tables for ROC, but mostly only get videos, or posts about what people got in the form of engrams -> ships -> coins -> motes etc. etc. Not what the actual item itself is."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,uidsea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"The way it works, to my knowledge, is that you do the strike, and get rewarded the engrams, then those engrams can decrypt as the old weapons, which can be different rolls of each.  The weapons and armor are not in the post-strike reward pool, but they're possible drops from engrams.  Bungie hasn't released official loot pool lists."
DestinyTheGame,3dx8kt,UnknownQTY,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. Upon further investigation of videos, I have noticed the ""I"" on the engrams dropped from those strikes. LDR 5001 + Longbow Synthesis are some of the best snipers for PvP due to their stability and enough impact to headshot on revive shield.

DestinyTheGame,3e044u,bkzeroxp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:53 2015 UTC,I think all of the superstitions and urban legends surrounding the game are interesting. Someone on here made a thread collecting all of them.
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,7strikes,3,Tue Jul 21 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"What about the rumor where you had to spin and shoot the Gorgon chest to get a for sure G-horn. I thought it was ludicrous right away, but I think there were a few people who tried it."

DestinyTheGame,3e044u,Kukulcan915,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:21 2015 UTC,That's hilarious and awesome.
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,crestboot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:28 2015 UTC,Right so i think it needs rather to be clarified that the sb chest was a timer for the templar chest ( beating him no teleports) and not for the exotic.  I was never really sure if it was true for that chest but thats the rumor that i had heard way back as a forever 29.
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,Kukulcan915,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:06:28 2015 UTC,The spirit bloom chest affects absolutely nothing. There is no timer.

I kept my mic off for the rest of that, and I got my first vex mythoclast at the end. Thank you rng"
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,TantrumDC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"Now, with no teleports, did you wipe if he did? Or did you just keel going? Cause I've never gotten no ports,  even after trying every time because we don't mind if we miss a few ascendant energies"
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,Kovitlac,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:34 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly we did it in one or two wipes. It was pretty fun to just go at it with all the minotaurs around. We used the tactic where you stay at the back right (or left depending where your perspective is) and cleanse for any missed oracles.
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,Warlock_225,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:48 2015 UTC,"My team has relic stay near the caves (back right when entering the are) with two others, and has two bubble titan go to the other teleport, with one roamer to help with oracles, normally our fuckup is a missed oracle and we need to move to cleanse, or a bubble won't recharge quick enough"
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,Kukulcan915,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I finally heard that rumor myself, the other day. I mean, I knew players have been spreading that stupid legend since, well, forever ago. But I had never actually been told during a raid, ""Hey, don't take that chest!"". I tried to set him straight, but he insisted. I didn't take it, just because I didn't want to get kicked from the group. Probably for the best in the end, since no exotics fell from the chest."

I think it's funny that so many people are getting so worked up over this - I don't know how many Day 1 ppl are here, but this was actually a real thing last year.

Played this game on both xbox and ps4 way too much and thats never happened before i was like oh... ok.. lol
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,TantrumDC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"It has the same RNG as a normal chest. That being said, my friend got a legendary engram from a normal chest once... Weird"
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,TantrumDC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"I tried to convince people in the past, but alas, people will believe what they want to believe. People don't grasp 'correlation doesn't always imply causation' and will think that just because the one time they didn't grab that stupid chest and someone got an exotic, that somehow that is in fact correlation and causation. Even day 1 players would argue tooth and nail and tell me I was wrong.   Anecdotal speaking, I have seen as many exotics drop from when grabbing the spirit chest vs not grabbing it. If there is a legitimate correlation between the 2, I have not seen it beyond anecdotal rumors. If someone wants to say there might be a correlation, fine, I have no proof other wise, but to say it as fact without proof is rubbish."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,Reasel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"This game was a lot more fun when these conversations actually did take place and there was uncertainty about that chest - When we had no idea if we had discovered everything in the vault. I feel sorry for people who are just starting to run the Vault for the first time now whose first experience involves OP telling them ""stfu you noob that's a stupid rumor and you're stupid too.""  You feel that ""it's your duty?"" Chill out. I'm sure you weren't a know-it-all the first time you ran the vault. Does it irritate you that 4 year-olds believe in Santa too?"

Does it irritate you that 4 year-olds believe in Santa too?   This kid wasn't a first timer he'd been running VoG quite a few times and has all 34s.   It doesn't irritate me that 4 year olds believe in Santa, but how would you feel growing up being told he is real, and soon you're a grown ass man and harping on anyone who says he's a myth? I'd be pretty pissed noone piped up at one point in my youth and told me straight. So somebody has to or eventually you're gonna look pretty foolish earnestly defending something that just isn't true."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,SamFletch7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"Your OP mentions nothing about how ""experienced"" this player was, and you called him a ""young rising guardian."" Given, if someone like that called me an idiot for opening the chest, I'd definitely let them have it.  But my point was with you playing Destiny police and making final judgment as to how all new players HAVE to experience the game. You're comparing someone who has spent all of their life not knowing that Santa Claus isn't real with someone who has owned Destiny for a few weeks. It's not our job to decide how they are going to receive the game. If they ask about the chest, surely tell them. If you are going to make it your mission to verbally berate everyone who hasn't owned this game as long as you and try and regulate their experience, you're just a dick."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,Edg4rAllanBro,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"You're right. I didn't go into detail about how experienced he is. His DestinyDB profile said he's ran vog about a dozen times, so I apologise that that to me is a young rising guardian.  You started with the Santa comparison. I merely rebutted.  I also did not verbally berate this guy, read my OP. formally educated.  I messaged him saying Im the idiot who took the chest, now watch someone get an exotic.  I did not claim to be the destiny police, but going back to the Santa comparison, I'm not going to keep my mouth shut and continue to let people carry on believing something especially when they are adamant that it's factual."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,SamFletch7,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:50 2015 UTC,"I started with the Santa comparison, but you misinterpreted what I meant by it. What I was saying was that if someone has had the game for only a few weeks, is playing VoG for the 2nd time, and mentions that someone in his previous group said something about not getting the chest, you're post advocates belittling him and calling him a noob for spreading rumors. Again, it's one thing to stand up to a dumbass who is going to be adamant about you being wrong about the chest - It's another thing to berate some guy who is just genuinely clueless who is trying to have a conversation about it. Sorry, your post just comes off as holier-than-thou to me. When I started playing and doing raids, I was fortunate enough to find myself in pugs with helpful, patient people who didn't try to belittle me for not being as experienced in raids as them. I see posts on here all the time about how intimidated people are to even join a raid for their first time because they're expecting to be joined into a group of elitists who are going to point out and make light of every single mistake they make instead of trying to help them. Maybe you weren't the same way and maybe you have played a lot of other games like this before, but I know that if my first couple of Raid experiences involved having to listen to ""stfu noob,"" I'd probably be done."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,ForestFireX,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I am in no way a holier than thou kind of guy. I'm not even smug about how experienced I consider myself.  I also did not mean to sound like that as I posted this. I just get fed up at times with the actual smug know it alls that need to just be put in their place. If you're running your second vog attempt and are inquisitive, I'd be happy to inform, no need to be intimidated. But if you're running your second raid and blather on about things you know nothing about but make it sound like you do, I will private message you and put you in your place."
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,debugman18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:48 2015 UTC,I know what you mean - I think your OP just kind of threw me off the message you were really trying to get across.
DestinyTheGame,3e044u,SamFletch7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:08 2015 UTC,I think the issue is that once someone thinks something silly like this the only way to prove them wrong is to have someone get an exotic from the gorgon chest....and when that doesn't happen it strengthens their belief.

You made a post entirely because you are being told to do something you don't want to do, and it's affecting your raiding experience.  It goes both ways is all I'm saying.

DestinyTheGame,3e0xv3,hrafnbrand,2,Tue Jul 21 10:45:37 2015 UTC,That was actually his inspiration for making this! We toyed with the concept a few months ago and then yesterday he tells me about this over the mic and we just took it from there.

DestinyTheGame,3e0xv3,hrafnbrand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:28 2015 UTC,I always envisioned it as a top down game a la Sword of Mana rather than a sidescroller
DestinyTheGame,3e0xv3,30SecondsToFail,2,Tue Jul 21 13:50:19 2015 UTC,Sidescroller is just inherently better for a shooter. 30 years of arcades can't be wrong.
DestinyTheGame,3e0xv3,hrafnbrand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:11 2015 UTC,I never played arcade games much. Maybe I'll change my mind about the sidescroller if I play it
DestinyTheGame,3e0xv3,30SecondsToFail,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:28 2015 UTC,Surely you must have heard of Metal Slug though? It essentially defined the olden shooter as much as Halo or Goldeneye the FPS

DestinyTheGame,3e185i,Lamela_7,9,Tue Jul 21 04:21:39 2015 UTC,I use the safe spot but still participate. If he's doing nothing then report. If he's being more cautious that you choose to be then he'll probably get a shit reward.
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,wadles68,4,Tue Jul 21 04:26:50 2015 UTC,How do you check up on what action has been taken? They don't immediately ban them whilst they are still in your fireteam?
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,himseelf,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:55 2015 UTC,"I think they have to investigate it beforehand before banning them. Seems unfair if someone was out doing something quickly, they come back and suddenly BAM!! banned"
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,30SecondsToFail,10,Tue Jul 21 10:17:46 2015 UTC,Wait...you are playing the Heroic right now? But you are posting on Reddit about guys not participating in strikes. Haha
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,Ari3Bombari3,5,Tue Jul 21 11:10:08 2015 UTC,"Hiding in safe spot may not AFKing, you can still doing pot shots.  I get into the safe spot all the time only jump out if Taurus is away."
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,honsan8,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"It would be great if a player had some kind of score attached to their GT, and that score was pulled from how they've been ""rated"" by fellow players in game. Kind of like the seller ratings on eBay.   Tie the reporting to that ""score"" and now reporting players for both positive & negative behaviors has a direct result. Then all Bungie needs to do is group the most negatively scored players together when matchmaking."
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,BHE65,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:46 2015 UTC,"What happens when little kids report you for being better than them on crucible? You come top of a team and get messages like 'hacker' as it is. Give those children a chance to further punish you for being good and they will take it. Then these good players have a bad rep for being good at the game, and they get paired with all these useless AFKers."
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,_ashmaley,2,Tue Jul 21 04:53:57 2015 UTC,"That was a thought in my head when I wrote that. Then don't automatically do the matchmaking stuff I guess. Let the players just avoid the idiots with low scores. This would really only affect someone when playing with ransoms. Your friends would know how you play and show you act and still play with you, right? If not, then the ratings are telling them anything they don't already know about you. Plus, I think this would just strengthen the already strong social  (in spite of awkward/difficult social tool functions in Destiny) side of this game.   Personally, if I end up in a strike I hate, or didn't cancel out of in time, then I play through to the end. It's common courtesy. I've only ditched mid-strike a couple times due to time constraints, and once by accident when I went to orbit when I really wanted to summon my sparrow. Lol."
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,BHE65,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:51:50 2015 UTC,"I hide quite often but still get shots off.

If they did put a system like that then I'd be screwed because, quite frankly, I'm not very good."
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,Waffles2208,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm very much an ""overwatch/support"" player and get even more cautious when I've got a ""don't die"" bounty running. Personally, I think having a mic and talking to your fellow Guardians whether they have mics or not, is helpful. Maybe I've been lucky and met very few selfish idiots... or maybe because I do it the way I do it helps keep potential idiots from going full retard, and everyone know you should NEVER go full retard! :)"
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,BHE65,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:12 2015 UTC,"People do have a tendancy to complain faster than they compliment. You're idea is good and would provide a quick and easy way of judgeing another players viability for any given task but shouldn't, I feel be tied to game generated playlists like PvP or Raids. It should be for players discretion, because _ashmaley is right and we are naturally a competitive species that wants to shit on the percieved opposition when ever possible. Besides, player rep is one (or two, maybe three) menu screen(s) away on your dashboard."
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,Th3R3alEp1cB3ard,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:39 2015 UTC,bungie cant change people from being dicks so just report and move on
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,dropbearr94,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:11 2015 UTC,"WTF Is this garbage Bungie why is it soo hard for you guys to ban AFK'ers ruining the game and DDOS'ers online??   Because it is hard to accurately identify both of these, and it's too risky to blanket ban accounts without reporting. So the best thing you can do is file reports."
DestinyTheGame,3e185i,himseelf,2,Tue Jul 21 12:20:41 2015 UTC,"Gotta say I have to go afk sometimes, with a 3 year old daughter and a wife that has panic attacks it just needs to happen. I try to let people know (without a Mic) by waiving and sitting down so they know it's intentional but I feel terrible, as bad as I feel though I don't want to get banned for it. I don't have the game time anymore to quit and start over either (although that does happen too)"

DestinyTheGame,3e185i,toxicxc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:16:45 2015 UTC,"It is real annoying. Every four or five strikes I get a team mate that doesn't actually participate. Sometimes they just stay at the beginning and don't even come, sometimes they are even more annoying and will tag along but not actually fight anything.   I had one guy that would find a safe spot, sit down, and just wait. At one point we died and he came out and revived me and then just went to another spot and sat down.  I ended up leaving. I feel bad for the other guy, but I wasn't going to carry that dude through the whole weekly heroic strike.  If you aren't going to play the game, then don't play the game. If you just want mindless gratification go play cookie clicker or something."

DestinyTheGame,3e185i,Waffles2208,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:06:30 2015 UTC,Was doing a level 28 PoE and and for 4 out of the 5 rounds one person decided to stand in place spinning in circles. This caused numerous other randoms to join and leave  after seeing what this person was doing. I reported him and  sent him a not so kind message. Couple days later I'm hit with a week long communication ban from Xbox.
