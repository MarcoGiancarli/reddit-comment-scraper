InstrumentPorn,3dr2c0,TitanGodKing,8,Sat Jul 18 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"You'd probably have more luck getting an answer over at /r/violinist; you could also ask at /r/violinmaking, though this is a bit off-topic and the sub isn't very active.  Best thing would be to bring it into a luthier who specialises in bowed strings. They might be able to take a quick look for free (if it's fake, poor workmanship might possibly be obvious), or evaluate it and its value for a fee."
InstrumentPorn,3dr2c0,Laogeodritt,4,Sat Jul 18 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"It's my dads and he would like to know if it's legit or not.  There is mispelling on the label but I'm told that's common, it says 'Georg Kloz in Mitten vvald an der Her 1779' On the back it says Klotz.  Sorry for the poor quality. Is it even possible to say if it's real or not online from these photos?   http://imgur.com/a/HDvXA"
InstrumentPorn,3dr2c0,LOLtheism,3,Sat Jul 18 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, I doubt it's authenticity. You should take it to a luther to be certain.  If you remove the chin rest (make sure you know what you're doing, if you don't, leave it in place) and look for places the varnish has worn.  What size is the violin?"
InstrumentPorn,3dr2c0,mxpower,3,Sat Jul 18 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"One of the tell tail signs is how the label is printed, the fact that it's blue is a pretty good sign of a copy. I'm about 95% it's a fake but a Luthier can tell pretty quickly."

InstrumentPorn,3dr2c0,cloudmerchant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:13:02 2015 UTC,Unlikely but worth bringing it to a luthier for fun if nothing else.  If it is real which is perfectly possible forums say 8k to 25k.

InstrumentPorn,3byu3b,FXtion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:52:39 2015 UTC,"The sound is alot more even, the B string can now go much deeper and still keep a good tension and good tone.. same around with the G string, it has a tiny bit less tension making it sound a bit less sharp and more clean. Also playing solos is alot easier because of the lower fret-distance around the 12th fret on the G-string. Dont have experience with true temperament frets so cant say much, but fanned frets doesn't ruin intonation at all."

Usually come with a hefty price tag, but you really are paying for the cream of the crop - I've never played a Warwick that has been 'meh', blown away every time.  I really can't take a liking to this however. I know people out there would really be blown away by this kind of thing, and for that I can see where this may earn some merits. It's just however not for me,  and I really don't agree with the colour scheme.  Gotta give points for fretless, not applicable from every style of play - however I've seen some funk bassists absolutely take control of the fretless bass."

InstrumentPorn,38z2ei,evening_raga,2,Mon Jun 8 01:30:16 2015 UTC,"When playing the Pipa, it seems like you're able to be quite expressive with it. How does it feel to rest your fingers on individual portions of the neck/body?   The Oud is also a beautiful instrument. Yours actually looks better than the expensive model I watched a video for, but that's just assuming you didn't sink a small fortune into buying one. It's also an interesting instrument, however, I enjoyed the Pipa's sound a bit more."
InstrumentPorn,38z2ei,kinggutter,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"Which videos did you watch? Ouds can greatly vary and many styles exist. I got this from a reseller in Cairo, it's fantastic. It's the style the most accomplished musicians like Munir Bashir, Nasser Shamma, Mohamad Abozekry, Marcel Khalif use. They can be very ornate with inlay and rosettes over the holes but I went with simple. It was 375 Usd  The pipa is very expressive, it has a tremendous range of sounds with each hand. There are many ways to strike the strings, picks are taped on all 5 nails to play, allowing long sustained notes. There is also access to the double high octave, which is still pretty hard to reach given the wider shape toward the bottom. All harmonics are present and easy to hit, like guqin. There are also many ways to press the strings . Microtones are important to the music and lots of ways to use them. My favorite players are Liu Fang, Liu Dehai, and Liu Puiyuan- his Plum Blossom is jaw dropping.   It is held upright do the thumb must also balance the instrument, which took some getting used to since it's quite heavy. The oud is much lighter since it's hollow, the pipa is a solid slab of rosewood. I also play sitar, which has high raised frets and they feel similar. Pipa gets progressively harder to play the higher up the string you go, same for oud too because of the shape."
InstrumentPorn,38z2ei,kinggutter,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:36:22 2015 UTC,"I watched this one on the Pipa, and this one on the Oud. I realized that I had previously viewed the second video, someone else must have posted an Oud for me to think ""Hmm, I gotta know how that sounds.""  If the Pipa is made out of solid Rosewood, I believe you when you say that it's heavy for sure. But I am jealous that you play/own a Sitar considering I find it to be one of the most beautifully expressive instruments ever created.

InstrumentPorn,37r8p5,TheChurchofHelix,1 point,Sat May 30 02:15:53 2015 UTC,"You know, you can get a Lindberg for around $100 these days. I got a 5 for my tenor and I just absolutely love it. Mouthpiece Express is the website I got for them   My tenor (the Eastman-Shires bridge horn, before the companies merged) has a gold brass bell, but when I have the money I'm gonna get a rose brass one. I use to play a rose brass Holton bass bone and I love the rich Euphonium-like sound it gets. My one problem with the Holton was the bell was far too thick, so I couldn't overblow it if I wanted to, and I like being able to get those harsh tones when a composer asks for it.   My current bass has a yellow brass bell which is just a little too bright for me, but it isn't detachable so I am stuck with that. That one's a Getzen."

InstrumentPorn,37a7a6,brokenoreo,2,Tue May 26 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"Not really, its the song title of one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands 'The Gaslight Anthem' and the singer plays a white on white similar to this one so I thought it was rather fitting."

InstrumentPorn,373lrc,Sgroh87,3,Sun May 24 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"So about those higher frets... they're definitely not semitones like regular frets. The spacing between semitones decreases the further up the neck you go, and that's true of this guitar's frets until you get to that inlay in the middle of the pickguard area. That fret has a HUGE gap, and the rest are pretty massive as well. What do you think those frets are? Maybe whole tones, and you have to bend to get the in-between semitones?"
InstrumentPorn,373lrc,asad137,6,Sun May 24 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"Good eye. Here's what Wikipedia says:   To be able to emulate the high notes of a violin, all of the Sky Guitars contain extra frets. The first Sky Guitar (used on the album Beyond the Astral Skies) has 30 frets. Later versions of the Sky Guitar overcame the problem of the higher register frets becoming too narrow by widening the frets by whole steps for the highest notes. In an April 2001 Guitar Player magazine interview, Roth reports that the guitars are either fretless above the 30th fret or have whole step fret spacing above the 27th fret, with 35 effective (half step) frets."
InstrumentPorn,373lrc,Karma_Gardener,2,Sun May 24 21:49:41 2015 UTC,By the looks of it the frets 30-35 break the standard temperament of the guitar and skip semitones to accommodate playability.  Brilliant design.
InstrumentPorn,373lrc,UncreativeTeam,3,Sun May 24 22:31:29 2015 UTC,...that you can't play sitting down
InstrumentPorn,373lrc,asad137,5,Sun May 24 20:10:03 2015 UTC,Sure you can. Either you play it classical style (with the bottom bout in between your legs) or you just put a short strap on it and sit down ;)

InstrumentPorn,354rom,Ferniff,1 point,Thu May 7 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Does that require a special neck? I have a fretted bass that was made fretless. I've been thinking about re-fretting it, and now I'm wondering if fanned frets is an option."
InstrumentPorn,354rom,Ferniff,1 point,Thu May 7 16:30:17 2015 UTC,Fanned frets do not require a special neck per say. But if you look at most fanned fretted basses (dingwald in particular) you'll notice the pickups are also at an angle. Not too sure how this would effect overall tone or if it even matters. That being said is your old bass neck a bolt on?
InstrumentPorn,354rom,goranistan,1 point,Thu May 7 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"I imagine as long as the strings are are still perpendicular the pickups should be fine. It's not a bolt on, glued on I guess (Guild Starfire)"
InstrumentPorn,354rom,azendel,1 point,Thu May 7 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"You seem to be very keen on fanned frets there haha, I mean no offense. Like I said I have used a few fretted basses. I like them but to me you can get just as much of an ergonomic feel if you just pay close attention to the scale and radius of your neck compared to you hand size. For me I have medium size hands and a 35 scale neck with a 12 radius is just on the cusp of that comfort zone for my hands."
InstrumentPorn,354rom,JasonDinAlt,2,Thu May 7 17:05:03 2015 UTC,Not really actually.  I never even used one. I'm constantly modding  this bass and always looking for more ways to make it weird. I may actually stick with it being fretless.

InstrumentPorn,2wnha8,Karma_Gardener,3,Sat Feb 21 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"This made it elite: http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/reimer//elite.htm  (Weird trivia: I created that HTML page in 1996, this Reimer guy ripped it from my site without my permission and is still hosting it. This is the oldest trace of me in the depths of Internet.)  The most obvious change was the active electronics. Some of those changes were for better, some for worse. The pickups sounded really good IMO.  But there were flaws, too - for example, the Freeflyte tremolo system was horrible. You couldn't adjust it properly, so the bridge started slightly buzzing when bending. I couldn't adjust it to be tighter, so I took it to a guitar tech and he said that neither can he.  Also, the pickup switching system was really cumbersome when changing pickups mid-song. Those three toggles were on-off toggles for each pickup.  The frets were worn and the switches started crackling. I decided a couple of years ago that I should either get it refretted and fixed or just sell it off to somebody who values the collectibility. I chose the latter, because I needed a workhorse guitar rather than a quirky collector's piece.  I put an ad up and a couple of days later a guy came to pick it up at my asking price of 975 EUR. He knew exactly what he was buying and had seen only one of those in the wild earlier on - his bandmate had owned one. I had never seen another one live, so they are pretty rare."

InstrumentPorn,2whvse,VoodoChild5,3,Fri Feb 20 12:53:40 2015 UTC,"The finish is 10 times prettier in real life. It plays really well imo. If you want to change tunings a lot then get a fixed bridge, if you're staying in one tuning mainly then you can consider getting the Floyd or Kahler Tremolo. I might not be used to 8 string guitars(this is my first one :P), but it puts a lot of strain on your neck/shoulder after a few hours of playing. I would HIGHLY recommend getting a padded strap, as that will help reduce the strain. The cepheus passive pickups are 6.5/10 overall (from the limited experience I've had with pickups), I've noticed that the highs and the lows become a bit muddy when strumming a large chord. They are also decently articulate, although I would prefer a little more. I would recommend getting a model with EMGs. Save yourself the trouble of upgrading to EMGs yourself, as that is probably what I'm going to do anyways haha. Construction is solid, no dings or knicks anywhere and good hardware. Guitar overall 7.5/10, would recommend."

InstrumentPorn,2w2yth,chamiidzhar,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"That was more of a Leo Fender thing. I guess he didn't like how naked pickups looked and covers were made in the early days for strats, teles, p-bass, j-bass etc. They were a newer concept back then and were hidden, when they could be. The covers are cumbersome at times and people got used to the idea of having pickups in plain sight, making them moot.   People still get them because they feel it makes the guitar more classy which I never understood because Fender made guitars with purpose in mind and not classiness. I find them to be a little clashing with that but to each his own."

InstrumentPorn,2v9czq,noturtles,3,Mon Feb 9 04:10:14 2015 UTC,How does the wood grain affect the sound?
InstrumentPorn,2v9czq,FUCKITIMPOSTING,1 point,Mon Feb 9 10:10:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say the wood would give it a less high end sound as apposed to being made of aluminium or other kinds of metal/ceramic. Wood generally tends to lend itself to a warmer and more organic sort of sound.   Of course it depends on what you use to strike it. I""m sure Mallets and other softer instruments would sound great. Drumsticks or harder implements would, naturally, still have a quicker attack and more high end, but probably less compared to a metal vibraphone."
InstrumentPorn,2v9czq,Shanbo88,5,Mon Feb 9 10:27:26 2015 UTC,"The bars are aluminum, actually, but they've been wrapped to make them appear as if they're made of wood. Bar wrap is Majestic's specialty, and they've shown models in the past with ""carbon fiber"" wrapped keys as well as ""piano"" style black and white keys. (The Academy was the first drum corps to sign on to the Quantum sponsorship, which is why we get the cream of the crop when it comes to gear from Majestic.) As for tone, these bars sound quite good when new, but deteriorated rapidly over the summer. They had already been used for the 2013 season and so were a little janky at first, but we got them re-tuned and they sounded pretty good after that. They have a decently dark sound, and I would compare them to the bars on a yamaha keyboard, but Adams, Musser, and Deagan (especially older Deagan) have a much superior sound. They do look pretty dope though, especially because they match our marimba keys, which always confuses people as to why we're marching four xylophones that don't really sound like xylophones."

InstrumentPorn,2qhdkq,rationalparty,3,Sat Dec 27 12:27:41 2014 UTC,"In most organs the bulk of the pipes are behind the display pipes (if any) as an organ grows, if architecture allows, other rooms are sometimes created to contain them. You can't put them just anywhere, the sound needs to get into the room well, so shallow spaces are best, with large openings. Lots of organs in gothic cathedrals are piled up in the triforia. The bulk of this organ is behind the display pipes, though I seem to recall there are some other chambers here and there. Organs pack more efficiently than you might think, 13.5K pipes is a lot, but most of them are closer in size to a pencil than a phone poll. Organ pipes halve in length every twelve notes, and in diameter every 17 (typically) as you ascend the musical scale."

Main problem is the way the framing was done. A significant fraction of the instrument is cut off, and not in a meaningful way. Did you try doing close abstract crops as well?  The inclusion of your hand (apparently) playing the instrument is good. I say apparently because of the way the mouthpiece and bell have been excluded.  Overall, some good fundamentals, but much room for improvement."

Once you play a compensating horn, you never want to go back (but you certainly don't want to break out the thousands of dollars to get one, at least if you're broke like me)."
InstrumentPorn,2lzy14,ScubaSteeeve,2,Tue Nov 11 22:24:42 2014 UTC,"What does the ""compensating"" part mean? I play euph but have only ever had access to low end ones unfortunately."
InstrumentPorn,2lzy14,Yiolut,6,Wed Nov 12 05:05:48 2014 UTC,"If you look closely, you may see that this instrument has a lot more tubing than the lower end models you've played. From wikipedia, ""In the Compensation system, each of the first two (or three) valves has an additional set of tubing extending from the back of the valve. When the third (or fourth) valve is depressed in combination with another one, the air is routed through both the usual set of tubing plus the extra one, so that the pitch is lowered by an appropriate amount. This allows compensating instruments to play with accurate intonation in the octave below their open second partial, which is critical for tubas and euphoniums in much of their repertoire.""Here's a cool flash animation and Here's an article about it."
InstrumentPorn,2lzy14,Yiolut,1 point,Wed Nov 12 05:37:58 2014 UTC,"Wow, very interesting. I've been on the lookout for a good euphonium too...definitely going to consider a compensating one now."
InstrumentPorn,2lzy14,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Thu Nov 13 06:12:27 2014 UTC,"Compensation is what sets professional horns apart from student horns. Great models are made by Wilson, Yamaha, and Besson."
InstrumentPorn,2lzy14,bergstenmusicrentals,3,Thu Nov 13 07:00:07 2014 UTC,"Normally, the fourth valve on a euphonium is essentially a shortcut for the first and third valves. It makes playing certain passages easier, but also allows you access to the lower range.  The problem is, the more valves you have down, the more out of tune the instrument becomes due to the design. The lengths of tubing are approximations designed to make the instrument relatively in tune, but when you add the fourth valve, it actually becomes really difficult to play anything beyond 1+4 in tune (for instance, if you tried to play a low B-natural below bass clef on a non-compensating euphonium - that's 1+2+3+4 - it would actually come out much closer to a C).  What the compensating euphonium does is add an additional length of tubing for each valve that only gets used when the fourth valve is depressed. This helps considerably with intonation."

InstrumentPorn,2lv4v9,Chieftallwood,2,Mon Nov 10 16:18:31 2014 UTC,I just used an inflation calculator from the year 1953
InstrumentPorn,2lv4v9,Chieftallwood,1 point,Mon Nov 10 16:21:09 2014 UTC,"Ah gotcha, I figured it was something like that. I was just on Ebay looking at 1950's silvertone guitars and one nearly identical to this one was going for $850. I have found inflation is only one factor to the price increasing when it comes to vintage instruments. There are all sorts of reasons why something as simple as a guitar could skyrocket in price- and most is motivated by nostalgic manufacturing techniques etc. Perhaps a pickup you can't get anymore, down to the way the wood is treated etc etc.  My point is I don't think i could ever see this guitar being sold at $112, but i don't necessarily see it for $850 either haha"

InstrumentPorn,2lm45p,WhaleMetal,3,Sat Nov 8 15:32:05 2014 UTC,What you've read is correct. Before picking up on the mandolin I played guitar for maybe six or seven years and most of what I'd already learned on guitar could be carried over and applied to the mando

Can't really say it's difficult or not, I play most of the string instruments (guitar, violin, would play cello but my Dad broke the cello). The only thing is the bridges on most inexpensive Asian mandolins need work, or are simply unusable (and $100+ to get a good one made), go to a strings dealer that actually understands them, play a bunch before you buy one, make sure the bridge is positioned correctly, matches the fingerboard radius, etc.  and get light gauge strings (.010 E, i think), learn how to chop on LH chords.  /r/mandolin is really helpful"

InstrumentPorn,2je2nb,Karma_Gardener,2,Thu Oct 16 09:47:18 2014 UTC,They're a bit of a gimmick. Almost no repair shop will work with them and if they do it'll be super expensive and they won't be happy about it.   No other stringed instrument has issues with intonation within the frets.

InstrumentPorn,2fqe0l,MCFiskars,3,Sun Sep 7 19:24:53 2014 UTC,"Are you sure? Have you double checked on that? Though it could very well be an odd tuning. Just because it's usually in F and C, doesn't mean instrument makers can't make it in different tunings."

InstrumentPorn,2fqe0l,allthefoxes,4,Sun Sep 7 19:54:53 2014 UTC,"Just to clarify here, the tuning of a recorder is based on what the lowest note is (all holes covered). A recorder in F will play a slightly sharp G when none of the holes are covered.  If you've taken that in to consideration, it would probably be a non-standard size then (likely a step above alto, although it's hard to tell the scale of the picture)"

InstrumentPorn,2fp273,Cabbageys,2,Sun Sep 7 09:59:11 2014 UTC,Does the carbon fibre body affect sound?
InstrumentPorn,2fp273,Cabbageys,5,Sun Sep 7 10:37:34 2014 UTC,"With soundpost-based instruments, the body is the sound. I've personally never come across one that wasn't the classic maple/spruce. That's why these are so interesting, their sound is comparable to a well-made wooden instrument, but they also boast all the properties of carbon fiber parts. I got a chance to handle one a while back and it sounded fantastic. Very clear and loud."
InstrumentPorn,2fp273,Laogeodritt,2,Sun Sep 7 13:16:04 2014 UTC,"Oh nice, thanks for the info"
InstrumentPorn,2fp273,jz88k,2,Sun Sep 7 17:14:08 2014 UTC,"As Cyclosis said, the body is the sound. I did some research on it a while ago (for a humanities/tech class, just because it aligned with my personal interests as a topic). Wanted to try a respected carbon fibre cello for a long time but I can't find one locally.   From what I know, the resin used to harden the carbon fibre fabric is controlled to give it specific resonant properties. The first prototypes (e.g. The first attempt Luis Leguia, who designed the Luis and Clark one, made) were pretty crappy and dead sounding.   The sound is generally more powerful and carries further than a wood cello. It apparently is less directional, filling more space even with poor room acoustics (between those two points and insensitivity to humidity, it's great for outdoor performances). It has a very strong bass response; some opinions I've encountered say the upper register sounds thinner and less warm.   There is a lot of traditionalism when it comes to the violin family and a lot of dissent. Some of the negative opinions I've found is that it sounds flat, uninteresting, too even, or lacking complexity of tonal character. On the other hand, one person mentioned that he likens the general quality/competence of the sound of the Luis and Clark to that of up to a $20k professional wood cello. (Luis and Clark cellos cost about USD 8k).  I would cite that properly but I don't have the paper with me... I can look them up if you really want."

InstrumentPorn,2fal4f,jaker1013,2,Wed Sep 3 00:28:49 2014 UTC,"All the cajons you've been posting lately look amazing.  I'm sure they play unbelievably.  One bit of constructive criticism, and I certainly hope you don't take offense:  the logo you have on the face of these things, just looks terrible.  Not the concept, the idea is cool, but it just looks like it was scribbled on there with a marker by your kid or something.  Maybe consider having a graphic designer turn it into a cleaned up image file that you can use on all your instruments.  I work in the music retail industry and I think some folks would have a hangup over the logo ruining the otherwise amazing look.  I know it's a stupid thing to judge an instrument on, but from a business and marketing standpoint, something to consider."

InstrumentPorn,2dlx3e,moonbeanie,1 point,Fri Aug 15 05:36:06 2014 UTC,"While the mystique value carries through the older classic instruments, not all of them play or sound great.  Old Gibson and Fender are notorious for quality control issues, while Gretch and Rickenbacher are famous for unoriginal and inferior replacement parts.  These instruments have been through many years, and changed hands sometimes more than once and they are often not worth the premium price paid in my experience opinion.  Nostalgia and mystique aside, most of the time a $10k relic doesn't touch a modern $2k guitar.  This may be well known to other experienced players, but for anyone new and looking to step up their guitar collection, don't always assume that older or classic guitars are worth what the market seems to bare."
InstrumentPorn,2dlx3e,Karma_Gardener,2,Fri Aug 15 18:23:33 2014 UTC,"Hey there, Thought I'd send you a return comment.  I've been playing for 35 years and used to live with a vintage guitar dealer in the Bay area so I've played some pretty amazing guitars and have a large experience base.  I agree that, especially during the '70's quality control was horrible at pretty much all instrument manufacturers, and I played '70s strats when they were new and hanging on the wall, but I find these old pre-historics to be a bit different and I've probably played a dozen or so. I think they're Gibson's attempt at doing their best during a time when they were pretty much floundering.  One of the best LPs I ever played was a mid-eighties Pre at a used instrument shop in Sacramento.  I guess my point is, I agree with you up to a point, but if you know what you're doing and have been around the block a few times you can find some pretty cool old Gibsons in the pre-historic pile.  Oh, BTW, my first Les Paul was a '74 tobacco burst and it was an absolute piece of crap.  You couldn't give me that guitar back now, it would just hinder my playing.  A three hundred dollar Ibanez would kick its but."
InstrumentPorn,2dlx3e,moonbeanie,1 point,Sat Aug 16 18:54:54 2014 UTC,The very best Les Paul i ever played was an epiphone that was modded like Jimmy Page's with the coil taps and stuff.  He was an engineer so i think he basically Plek'd it himself.
InstrumentPorn,2dlx3e,Karma_Gardener,2,Sat Aug 16 19:54:56 2014 UTC,"I'm an engineer too and I have a physics degree as well.  The physics degree is great because it really helps me understand vibrations and wave phenomena which in turn enables me to have a really solid understanding of the signal path.  BTW the best LP I ever played was a nearly mint condition '57 gold top w/PAFs and a stop tailpiece.  The second best was a '58 black three pickup custom that was slightly hammered but awesome.  And both were real deal vintage ones and not re-issues and they both absolutely stormed. All that said, right now my main working guitar is a Japanese (CIJ) '54 Strat reissue I rewired. Killer guitar, cost me $400 plus shipping out of Tokyo.  The one thing about old electric guitars that's severely annoying is their electronics get really crabby when they get old.  Thanks for the conversation, have a great day."

I didnt really find either transition bad, it's just that experiencing the 8 feels weird to be because of how thin the stock strings are (The wound strings are literately too thin for even standard tuning!)  If you were to get an ERG, I would recommend finding some songs that are played on ERGs and learn them, as that would probably make you feel more at home.  (And, if all you do is chug the lowest string, dont feel bad, many people do that, and if you want to do that it's fine.  So many people hate on people that only use one string on a song like ""omg u fegit 1 string nerd get a djentstick"")"

InstrumentPorn,2acdey,Cloudwolf12341,3,Thu Jul 10 20:38:12 2014 UTC,"Yes, the lute and the oud share a common ancestor. There are thousands of 'lutes' some of which are fretless and have doubled strings. 'Lute' is actually a family of instruments including guitar, oud, sitar, pipa, and many others. I assume you mean the 'renaissance lute' commonly used in western music. The main difference there is the lack of frets on the oud, giving it the ability to employ semitones and glissando. Also the strings are doubled giving it the characteristic 'buzz' sound. The oud has fewer strings than the renaissance lute as well. They do have the same body shape and both have the tuning pegs pointing toward the player."
InstrumentPorn,2acdey,Calico_Dick_Fringe,3,Thu Jul 10 21:08:30 2014 UTC,"Doubled strings (courses) tuned in unison don't create a buzz.  Their main effect is increased volume.  A buzz such as found with a sitar would be caused by a curved bridge where strings aren't resting on a well defined point.  Source: I play lutes and similar instruments, including a cumbush ('joombush' - a Turkish oud-banjo thing)."
InstrumentPorn,2acdey,Calico_Dick_Fringe,3,Thu Jul 10 23:09:15 2014 UTC,"Joombush   That's really cool, I love finding out about new instruments. Is it a pretty recent creation?   The sitar is actually my main instrument, heres my baby. I've done a lot of work shaping the bridges (jawari) over the years, which can be a very intricate process. Heres a close up of my latest one, showing what you are mentioning about the strings not resting on a well defined point. The slight angle makes the strings bounce on the tapered edge, as opposed to other instruments that set the string free right out of the bridge.   The thick courses on my oud do create a buzz sound when they are played because they slightly hit each other when they vibrate, or perhaps they are vibrating against the fretboard. The nylon sets and the single bass string don't. It's not so much a 'buzz' as the sitar but it is something noticeable. I've heard other oud players (Munir Bashir and Naseer Shamma namely) create this same sound. I like it, it adds to the character and uniqueness of the instruments distinctive sound."
InstrumentPorn,2acdey,IFUCKINGLOVEMUSIC,1 point,Fri Jul 11 01:36:37 2014 UTC,"Is it a pretty recent creation?    It's almost a hundred years old, so a fairly recent creation in Turkey.  It's tuned like a Turkish oud, but you can do whatever you like with it.  I've had both nylon oud strings and metal strings on it.  I kinda prefer the nylon.  Here's an example by a traditional player.   The thick courses on my oud do create a buzz sound when they are played    That sounds like you've got low string tension, or some strings are too close together within courses.  When I first pick/pluck a note, there's a woody thunk and a hint of a buzz on ouds and similar instruments, but if it continues beyond the note attack (like a sitar or with loud 'rattling'), then I find it annoying and look to correct it.  I prefer mostly pure woody tone like this.   His low strings buzz or rattle together a little when played aggressively, but not like a bray pin on a medieval harp or a sitar.  Maybe you're referring to the raspy/velvety effect of thick nylon strings played without frets?"

InstrumentPorn,2acdey,MikeOxmaul,1 point,Fri Jul 11 00:53:53 2014 UTC,"Yep.  An oud has a narrower neck and different shaped pegbox, no frets, and is played with a plectrum.  Also, the construction will be a little heavier than a renaissance lute.  Traditionally, it is more common to play single note lines, rather than chords with an oud.  Oud playing example.  Typical smooth shape for oud back.  A renaissance lute will tend to have the same or more courses of strings (6 - 8 course is common - more strings/courses were added later to extend the range), a flat wide fingerboard for playing chords, tied gut frets, a VERY thin soundboard (barely 1mm) for increased volume when playing with fingertips, and the shape of the bowl will tend to have flats/steps in it rather than be sanded smooth and round like an oud is.  Note that a medieval lute would have been closer in design and playing style to the oud, considering the common ancestor.  Medieval lutes often look like 5-course ouds of the time that were brought back to Europe, and sometimes they had frets tied onto them, sometimes not, but it's often difficult to tell from the iconography.  Some photos from a lute maker's website - notice the shape of the back compared to the oud, and the much wider fingerboard.  Examples of renaissance lute playing:  Nigel North  Edin Karamazov  Ronn McFarlane w/ Annalisa Pappano on treble viol.  All of those lutenists are fantastic.  I highly recommend Ronn McFarlane's album The Renaissance Lute."

InstrumentPorn,2abgq2,AndrewT81,3,Thu Jul 10 15:48:48 2014 UTC,"I'm not a brass player, but have been learning a bit. Care to explain why they have 6 valves? That seems a bit excessive to me."
InstrumentPorn,2abgq2,Sumizone,3,Fri Jul 11 02:17:47 2014 UTC,"Virtually the only instruments that have five or six valves are tubas*. On most modern C tubas, starting around 1980 or so, there's a fifth valve, sometimes operated by the left hand, but increasingly becoming more common to operate with the thumb of the right hand. (The 2145 has a thumb operated valve, I'll post pics tomorrow.)  The reason that these exist on tubas is for intonation in the extreme (usually low) registers. On C, the fifth valve lowers the pitch by a whole step plus a quarter tone. So if you're playing an open C and press the fifth valve down, you end up with a very flat Bb. Why have this you ask? Because it's very easy to go really sharp in the lower registers. Anything below an E2 runs really sharp for almost every player. The fifth valve offers alternate fingers that give much better intonation because of that extra 5/4 step to bring it back down. Intonation in this register is especially important as 1) more people are realizing what the tuba is capable of and writing solo/ensemble parts down there and 2) everybody listens down to the tuba, so if you're out of tune, the whole ensemble is.  I'll be totally frank and say that I don't understand the sixth valve on an F tuba just yet. I've been playing F less than a year and just got this one. The one I had before only had five valves so it was the same concept as the C tuba. As I understand it on this tuba, the fifth valve (the lower one) is just a regular fifth valve, while the sixth valve (upper one) lowers the pitch by a little bit more than what the fifth does. I'm still trying to figure out all the correct fingerings for it.  source: lessons, Tuba Source Book  *I haven't seen any other brass instrument with more than four, however I'm willing to be corrected."
InstrumentPorn,2abgq2,Sumizone,3,Fri Jul 11 06:05:55 2014 UTC,"There are some rare examples of five-valve euphoniums out there (not counting double-bell euphoniums, where the fifth valve was to move to the second bell).  Also, from the tiny amount of Googling I've done, it seems the fifth valve is supposed to be a flat whole step and the sixth valve is supposed to be a flat half step (although this could easily be the opposite on yours, that the fifth is the flat half step and the sixth is the flat whole step)."
InstrumentPorn,2abgq2,AndrewT81,3,Fri Jul 11 07:45:18 2014 UTC,"Yes, you are right; fifth valve is a flat whole step. My bad  I shouldn't play Xbox and reddit at the same time."

It has a flat top, no f-holes, no spines or cornices, no purfling, and no pegs. I feel it's noteworthy given how rare usable deviations from the classical design are."
InstrumentPorn,2a28bw,zadtheinhaler,4,Mon Jul 7 19:29:42 2014 UTC,"eh, i've seen some minimalistic violin designs that work...but hey, i'm a drummer, what do i know? thanks for clearing it up!"
InstrumentPorn,2a28bw,vampyrita,4,Mon Jul 7 19:32:59 2014 UTC,As you can see it has an O shaped soundhole rather than f-holes. You can't see inside so I don't know for sure but it looks like it might be braced like a guitar. Also the flat top.
InstrumentPorn,2a28bw,AveragePurpleWizard,1 point,Mon Jul 7 19:31:06 2014 UTC,"Calling it an ""O""-shaped hole is interesting - I think this would be something Django Reinhart(sic) would play."

InstrumentPorn,2a05il,TruthWithoutTact,7,Sun Jul 6 23:29:54 2014 UTC,can we see the front?
InstrumentPorn,2a05il,PastaOfMuppets,7,Mon Jul 7 00:34:03 2014 UTC,"imgur album of the front  More pics on their website here  My cousin is the only employee/owner/head luthier at Zoov.  I'm helping him by spreading the word so tell your friends or give him a like on facebook if you feel like it  Here's a podcast we did recently about his passion for guitars.  Skip to around 11:50 to hear him talking about why he builds guitars, etc."
InstrumentPorn,2a05il,SexistButterfly,5,Mon Jul 7 01:30:52 2014 UTC,Tell him to try a 5 string banjo. There is a lot less woodwork to be done(compared to an acoustic guitar) and banjo players have no problem paying top dollar for good looks and craftsmanship. It is a great way to make some extra money.
InstrumentPorn,2a05il,satyagraaha,2,Mon Jul 7 02:21:43 2014 UTC,I was getting a 7 string commissioned by him but I ran into money troubles. I was so excited and now he doesn't do custom jobs!
InstrumentPorn,2a05il,Chieftallwood,3,Mon Jul 7 04:19:41 2014 UTC,"He still does customs.  He just doesn't do them for cheaper than it costs to build them anymore.  He wanted so badly to make it as a luthier that he was quoting out instruments that required 100 hours of hand work for $2,000.  With $700 in components/wood, shop costs, etc. that comes down to less than minimum wage to build a world class instrument, which obviously isn't sustainable.  I'm trying really hard to get people to understand that this guy is the real deal.  I don't get paid or anything I just help him out because he's my cousin and one of my best friends.  Back to custom orders -- he said in a recent podcast we did, ""I'd rather build the guitar of my dreams than the guitar of yours, because I've been thinking about building them every day since I was 14.""  Hard to argue with that...  Look at the design work on this thing:  link"
InstrumentPorn,2a05il,Grimsrasatoas,2,Mon Jul 7 13:33:26 2014 UTC,"isn't that the back of the 7 he made for Keith Merrow?  I follow Zoov guitars work, I found his stuff on /r/guitar a while ago and I've been following him since. I would totally buy one of his guitars of I could afford it."
InstrumentPorn,2a05il,some_random_kaluna,2,Mon Jul 7 14:55:18 2014 UTC,"Correct.  This guitar was originally intended as a gift to Keith Merrow but Keith signed a deal with Schecter and it ended up being sold to someone else.  PS -- I think it's really cool that you knew this.  He's obviously doing something right to have people like you that follow him and recognize not only his guitar but who it was intended for!  Do you mind me asking how you ""follow his work"" exactly?  Do you visit the webpage?  Do you just see his posts on facebook?  I'm asking because I'm obviously interested in increasing his visibility.  Thanks!"
InstrumentPorn,2a05il,some_random_kaluna,2,Mon Jul 7 15:12:00 2014 UTC,"If you want to reach out to the guitar community, go to Sevenstring.org if you aren't already registered there. The guy who bought that guitar was a member and posted the NGD thread for it (See here), which is how I knew about it. I also followed Keith's posts about the guitar. I found Zoov maybe 1.5-2 years ago on /r/guitar (or whenever it was before it went to self posts only), and I saw his work on Sevenstring.org also.   I'm a guitar enthusiast, builders of his skill level usually don't slip under my/our collective radar.  The man has a unique style, and appears to have super tight attention to detail. Those two things are always big winners."

InstrumentPorn,29yuzq,referencenumber,2,Sun Jul 6 17:22:41 2014 UTC,"I like Periphery as people and as individual musicians, don't get me wrong, but to me it seems like they (as a band and their following) are way more fixated on their gear and their setup rather than actually playing. I'm just not a fan of their music or their songwriting process, and it seems to me that they win people over with their $8000+ rigs. I see kiddos these days that can't play worth shit but are lugging around expensive guitars and huge amps like they're automatically going to sound better with a more expensive setup.  /old man rant"

I also got a rumble 150 for 100dollars off, the bass distortion pedal and USB interface were 30 off each, and I had a coupon for the rest lol. The salesman was loving me lol.   Edit: Oh and thank you! She is SO SHINY, and at first I didn't like the faux marble scratch plate, but the more I see it the more regal it looks. Plays like a dream too."
InstrumentPorn,26mgrk,natethelion,1 point,Tue May 27 19:09:24 2014 UTC,How's the mxr? I've been looking at that one
InstrumentPorn,26mgrk,natethelion,1 point,Tue May 27 20:42:05 2014 UTC,"Dude, I love this thing. All I was looking for was a distortion pedal, but this thing is so much more. It has a direct output for PA systems, and it has a EQ pedal in addition to the distortion. The two effects don't work at the same time, but the EQ has a ""color"" mode and I swear it makes my bass punch like rocky balboa. There's also a gate and a blend mode for restricting and blending the gain with the clean thump. So freakin cool. This pedal alone makes my bass make a LOT of different sounds. I think it was $130 and worth every penny imo.   I'm also a pedal and effects newb, so take it with a grain of salt :) If I do a recording I'll reply with it so you can hear the effect."

That'd be like me bragging I'd changed my socks this morning.   Change/make a scratch plate, clean those mankey screws, re-orientate the bridge pickup correctly and it might start to look okay to me.

InstrumentPorn,24pq84,SentrySappinMahSpy,1 point,Mon May 5 11:39:22 2014 UTC,Does brass have the eternal good tone v bad tone debate that stringed instruments do? I would ask a brass player but all the ones I know are usually too drunk to speak or too dangerous to approach without supervision.
InstrumentPorn,24pq84,Funkyapplesauce,2,Mon May 5 13:45:50 2014 UTC,"What debate do you mean specifically? Yes, brass players want the best tone we can get. We're probably not as interested in ""vintage"" instruments as viol family players are. But modern valved brass instruments are less than 200 years old. Vintage for us might be 40 years old. And as sheeves said below, the build quality has improved so much in the last 100 years that vintage horns don't really have a chance at sounding as good as a well built modern horn. Doesn't mean they don't sound good, though."

InstrumentPorn,21inao,SexistButterfly,1 point,Fri Mar 28 13:24:39 2014 UTC,"While you're lecturing about proper technique, make sure that your grip isn't too good (read: tight). It should be really loose and relaxed, especially with a heavy pick (do people really use anything else? lol). You should be able to reach over and slide the pick out of your fingers easily, just barely held there. Anything to reduce tension in zee-hands."

InstrumentPorn,20zegt,bassduck,2,Fri Mar 21 09:27:57 2014 UTC,"Nowadays it's more used as a handrest and aesthetical reasons.  Even though the majority of people take it off when playing fingerstyle.  The cover was essential on the 4001 (predecessor of the 4003) espc. with the horseshoe pickups and was used as a kind of shielding for the pickup.  also it looks quite badass  But I'm no Rickenbacker expert nor an electrician, so I don't know if that is was just a marketing thing or reality..."

InstrumentPorn,20yrf5,AveragePurpleWizard,1 point,Fri Mar 21 15:50:24 2014 UTC,My music teacher told me once that French horns are weird. She claimed that they did strange things and that the note you thought you played often came out as something completely different at the other end. Is there any truth to this? I would ask my daughter but she is a flautist so she wont talk to brass players just incase someone sees her and assumes she is a drunken lout :)
InstrumentPorn,20yrf5,BlackNotesIII,1 point,Fri Mar 21 05:57:38 2014 UTC,Either you're music teacher was messing with you or you're messing with us because that isn't true in the slightest sense haha.
InstrumentPorn,20yrf5,Funkyapplesauce,1 point,Fri Mar 21 12:16:24 2014 UTC,"It's partially true. The hornist uses his/her hand to do alter tone and pitch in the bell. Also, some stop mutes require transposing by a half-step. Also many F horn players get stuck with Eb parts and just get used to transposing by a full step. Also, since the horn is so long compared to it's effective range the partials are particularly close together, which for an inexperienced horn player makes all kinds of strange things happen."
InstrumentPorn,20yrf5,BlackNotesIII,1 point,Tue Mar 25 01:47:56 2014 UTC,Maybe for a beginner these are problems but an experienced horn player is going to know these things and know what pitch comes out. He failed to specify if his teacher was talking about a beginning student or not. You could infer that a beginning student of any instrument would have a lot of trouble.

I picked up a translucent red one instead, and instantly felt like jamming.  I don't normally like red."
InstrumentPorn,1zkaj4,DariusL,1 point,Wed Mar 5 04:18:32 2014 UTC,Dat finish. I'd want that same exact finish on a Les Paul.

InstrumentPorn,1zkaj4,Asaroki,3,Tue Mar 4 21:29:15 2014 UTC,How are they a shitty company?
InstrumentPorn,1zkaj4,JonnySniper,2,Tue Mar 4 23:33:38 2014 UTC,"Huge lack of quality control; even basses produced in the same month are different in neck size, sound, setup and finish.  Having a hard time accepting criticism; They took years to accept the fact that their bridge had a problem until finally adding two extra screws (google ""rickenbacker tail lift""). Aftermarket is rarely an option, because:  RIC employs a bunch of fulltime lawyers who sue everything they can find (e.g. Basses that simply look similar to theirs).  You also need to pre-order your new bass because RIC can't keep the production up. Pre-ordering is dangerous, because of earlier mentioned lack of QC so you'll never know if the bass you get is crappy or good.  A weak output of the E string is fairly common, too.  Never buy an unplayed RIC!"

InstrumentPorn,1yvbaq,kinggutter,1 point,Tue Feb 25 20:42:02 2014 UTC,"Sort of, the big difference before the sitar and taus other than the bowing is the vibrato. The sitar pulls the string side to side where the taus vibrates up and down the string to vibrate the sound."
InstrumentPorn,1yvbaq,kinggutter,1 point,Wed Feb 26 08:53:05 2014 UTC,"You're right. I hadn't noticed that he wasn't bending the strings in the video, rather using vibrato. I was too enamored with the sound it was making and trying to figure out how much of a boss guitarist that guy would be."

The bow, unsure if it's the original has lost it's ability to play as the horse hairs are quite loose. The current own is a museum, unfortunately not much information is on it. You can read a bit more about this particular taus here  A bit of info. The taus was created by Guru Hargobind Saheb Ji (the 6th Sikh Guru) Back in the 1600's. The taus is a persian word meaning peacock. Here's what it sounds like The taus has a younger brother called Dilruba which is a smaller version of it but doesn't resonant as much and is smaller. They made it smaller cause the taus used to break a lot as the Sikhs used to get into battles a lot so the dilruba is less fragile."

InstrumentPorn,1yghaq,ndseier,2,Thu Feb 20 18:34:52 2014 UTC,"It gets compared to the Mk VI a lot. The ergonomics leave something to be desired, but the aesthetic is very vintage and the sound has that darker quality reminiscent of Rollins and Hawkins. Some people say that it doesn't have the personality of those older horns, though I think that comes with playing the horn and giving it time to settle in to the player's style. Mechanically though it's very in tune throughout the entire range of the horn and I've been looking at buying one myself for the past year or so. I just can't find one close enough to play test, especially since WWBW closed their showroom in South Bend a few years ago."

InstrumentPorn,1xi6lx,ICMB94,2,Mon Feb 10 07:56:33 2014 UTC,I wonder if this would be a good way to measure drumming precision.  This is awesome by the way.
InstrumentPorn,1xi6lx,Knups,6,Mon Feb 10 09:12:06 2014 UTC,"i'm sure the concept would work, but for this we just tied fairy lights on his hands and they were a bit loose:P, but with the colour version of it you can see more or less"

InstrumentPorn,1xb932,bloodyclueless,2,Sat Feb 8 17:43:08 2014 UTC,"It was picked up at Guitar Center and after I talked my buddies down in price walked out paying $300 flat. The key to getting a good one is to ask to see what they have in stock and pick the best looking one, just like I did."
InstrumentPorn,1xb932,Mikko_goes_reddit,1 point,Sat Feb 8 20:22:42 2014 UTC,That really looks a bit painful. I own the 4-string version and luckily the finish on it looks just lovely

InstrumentPorn,1x968k,magolmaethor,2,Fri Feb 7 06:39:14 2014 UTC,"As a brass repair tech, working on clockwork  springs sucks. But how does it play?"
InstrumentPorn,1x968k,squad51,1 point,Fri Feb 7 14:51:40 2014 UTC,"For being what it is, it plays really quite well.  The low registers are pretty sorry, just not enough length there to round out those overtones.    It's quite small, if you look in the gallery you can see a hand (sorry no Banana) for scale.  It is pitched in Bb so that's handy, it has a taper for a trumpet/flugel mouthpiece rather than a cornet mouthpiece.  Being that I bought this from Goodwill, its condition is extraordinary.    The clockwork valves are amazingly smooth, but there is a lot of tolerance built in. Everything just sort of slides together.  And with all that space everything makes clicks when the keys are depressed/released and the play has to be taken up."
InstrumentPorn,1x968k,asad137,2,Fri Feb 7 20:02:50 2014 UTC,Keep the brass coming.   Nothing better than a fat buttery flugel.
InstrumentPorn,1x968k,asad137,1 point,Fri Feb 7 15:42:50 2014 UTC,Very cool! Thanks! I've only ever seen rotary valves on a tuba.
InstrumentPorn,1x968k,lusterwill,2,Fri Feb 7 17:02:38 2014 UTC,"Clockwork rotary are quite a bit more rare though.  A bit of a hallmark for an old European instrument.  Where modern rotary valves, the return spring is external to the key, these are wound like the coil spring of a clock.  There is a flat steel spring wrapped around a central non-moving square peg.  The key housing is attached to the other end of the spring, and the whole bit wound up to provide the tension, the linkage provides the stops preventing it all from coming unraveled.  They don't survive well, as they are always under tension, and if any water gets into the casing, it is nearly impossible to dry it out.  The spring then rusts away."
InstrumentPorn,1x5czv,jordannoret,3,Thu Feb 6 03:36:37 2014 UTC,Impressive.

InstrumentPorn,1x4jpc,davecg,2,Wed Feb 5 22:53:41 2014 UTC,Do want!!! Probably one of the only 6 strings I'd get. Save a warwick or spector.
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,sigurbodi91,5,Thu Jan 30 23:16:49 2014 UTC,I'm off to re-string my Dilruba; see you in a week or so....
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,Bikewer,3,Fri Jan 31 03:34:52 2014 UTC,"I remember the first time I tried restringing my dad's sitar, that took me 2 days to get right   That was also the last time I tried"
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,HankSpard,1 point,Fri Jan 31 05:24:10 2014 UTC,"I restring mine, not as long as you think, it takes me I'd say 5 mins to restring each wire. there are about 26 strings, depending on the make. So altogether probably 2.5 hours. But remember, it's the love of the instrument that makes you want to care for it, therefore it isn't a hassle."
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,NoobSingh,3,Sat Feb 22 08:53:30 2014 UTC,And it sounds like this
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,ososkokaror,2,Fri Jan 31 09:12:11 2014 UTC,Thats so awesome. Its also teeny tiny compared to a sitar.
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,EdwardOnly,3,Fri Jan 31 11:42:37 2014 UTC,"If you're anything like me your thinking ""What is up with all those fucking strings?""  Well, apparently most of those are just sympathetic strings that aren't used directly, but rather only resonant when certain notes on the 4 main playing strings are at certain frequencies.  Here's a helpful diagram for visualizing where all those strings go and what the knobs on the side correspond to."
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,TheeSweeney,2,Fri Jan 31 18:00:11 2014 UTC,"Correct, when I tune my string to the correct raag that I'm playing, it sounds godly, compared to if it isn't tuned, there isn't much resonance to it.  Also only the first two are played on the left side. The first left mainly and the second left to those that are experts in the instrument and raag."
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,NoobSingh,2,Sat Feb 22 08:55:24 2014 UTC,If only my sitar had tuning pegs like that... and I knew how to tune it.... and play it.
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,EdwardOnly,2,Fri Jan 31 11:40:50 2014 UTC,"It looks similar to Sarangi, right?"
InstrumentPorn,1wlkj5,creesteeeena,1 point,Thu Feb 6 01:18:47 2014 UTC,Actually the dilruba is exactly the cross between sarangi and sitar. Sarangi body with sitar neck; that is the origin!
