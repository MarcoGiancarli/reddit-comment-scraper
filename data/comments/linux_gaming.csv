linux_gaming,3e34qm,Aspyr_Blair,37,Tue Jul 21 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"HIGHLY recommend playing 1 first.  You dont HAVE to, but it helps.  I'd actually recommend our mobile version of 1 on a tablet.  IMHO its the best way to play it"
linux_gaming,3e34qm,Future_Suture,12,Tue Jul 21 17:13:22 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I really and truly appreciate that Aspyr doesn't just focus on new titles and puts effort into bringing older titles to Linux as well. Perhaps games that you have already brought to Mac OS will follow?  Secondly, is the first game coming to Linux as well at some point thanks to you guys? I would gladly buy a few copies for Linux using friends if that is the case. Having the sequel in a series but not the game that started it is somewhat disconcerting. In addition, will there be Steam Trading Cards available for the second game (and the first game when you eventually release it on Linux)?   Thirdly, I'll add this release to my wishlist as a reminder to get it off GameAgent at some point after the sale is over. Once again, thank you!"
linux_gaming,3e34qm,onelostuser,3,Tue Jul 21 18:51:15 2015 UTC,I hope the day comes when you will be able to recommend both the mobile and the SteamOS versions of KOTOR.  wink-wink nudge-nudge  Congrats and thanks for this port guys :)

linux_gaming,3e34qm,Uradamus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"This has been a bitter sweet victory for Linux users. While I absolutely love this game and am so glad that your team were able to get it out to us, it just sucks that the even better first game didn't get to us first.  I agree that the first game should be played first. There are just enough references to the first game in the second to probably spoil a lot of stuff for a newcomer. I don't have any mobile devices, otherwise I would probably pick up that version, but the Windows version in Steam has worked well in Wine for me in the past.  I really hope this port does really well and you guys could convince Bioware it would be worth the cost and effort to expand the first KotOR's system coverage to Linux and Mac."

linux_gaming,3e2l5x,totallyblasted,3,Tue Jul 21 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"They state that it's to protect their own intellectual property. A lot of mods copy and alter original Paradox code, so a modder cannot possibly claim copyright over that.  In the case of my tool, there is absolutely no Paradox code at all. But they apparently want to use a blanket rule for something so nuanced as copyright.  There are more instances where the rules are draconic. There are some music mods that don't contain code or Paradox intellectual property at all. It's not unreasonable to expect to keep copyright over the music upon uploading it, but that doesn't appear to be the case either.  I wrote those concerns and more in this post to the Paradox subreddit."
linux_gaming,3e2l5x,falsemyrm,0,Tue Jul 21 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"Rule 4 is typical CLA, nothing strange there. Try pushing something to Canonical and you get the same response. Note that there are different kinds of CLAs, some more friendly, some not and I won't judge on this point.  Reasoning behind companies requiring CLA is simple (even in OSS solutions):   Project simply cannot afford to include any code where they don't have control over it. If they decided on relicensing it, every copyright owner must agree for his parts of code What if there was a person who would say free and then later change his mind and started demanding backlog payment? Probably wouldn't fly in court, but it would sure be annoying   There are also shitload of reasonings why CLA is bad in users case. But, that is another story and is not connected why Paradox requires them"
linux_gaming,3e2l5x,ObsidianOps,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"But posting a third-party work is not in any way, shape or form a contribution to Paradox's work. It's an add-on at best. A CLA (Contributor License Agreement) simply doesn't fly here, because there is no contribution in the first place. Unless Paradox intends to allow people to contribute code to their games or include people's works into their own (neither of which are the case), you cannot speak of a CLA at all.  The ""credits"" exception is hilarious, too, because it means absolutely nothing.  The modders themselves have resorted to ""you must have permission from me to use my mod in your own mod"", which Paradox doesn't appear to oppose, which is pretty much the definition of copyright.  It's all sorts of messy, and Paradox hasn't demonstrated any proper knowledge of copyright in the forum threads surrounding this mess."

They have experience with the code base, having ported KotOR 1 to a bunch of platforms, so they can probably port KotOR 2 in a short amount of time.   We don't know how they operate. Old games are probably low priority jobs, something to work on when there's a lull in other, more important projects. Or training for interns. Or passion projects devs undertake on their own time.

Around the same time, Aspyr started working on a new title, a title that also happends to be ""one of my favorite games of all time"".   It could still be anything, doh the wording seems to hint at an older, well known game, like HW or KOTOR. What gives HW the speculation edge is the Gearbox-connection, the fact that they started to work on Mystery Game immediatly after the sucessful windows release of HW, and (this is very flimsy, but still) that Blair talked about both working on, and HW beeing one of his most favourite games."

linux_gaming,3dzgq7,FreakyCheeseMan,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:46 2015 UTC,"That would be interesting. I did hear complaints about it, though - they brought both the old and new fleets to the same ""balance point"", and a lot of people felt that they dumbed down the HW1 strategy to do so."
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,argh523,4,Tue Jul 21 01:52:11 2015 UTC,"They basically rebuild HW1 in the new engine, and it makes sense to rebalance to make the combined multiplayer work, which is a fine idea because it gives you all the maps and all factions in one game, and doesn't split the community.  But if the new balance is a problem, you can still go back to the old game! The collection is actually four games: the two remastered versions, and the two classic versions, eg the original games with minimal changes to make them work on modern systems. Of course, that doesn't help in multiplayer, but still."
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,FreakyCheeseMan,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, I wasn't sure how it worked.  What I mostly heard was that they got rid of a lot of the hard counters, and turned into into much more of a ""Add together the strength of all the units involved, person with the bigger number wins"" sort of deal, as opposed to the first one where you could often win with a pitifully weaker force if you used it right.  Happy to hear they brought the original version along for the ride, though."

It makes it all the more special that some companies still think it's important to invest the time, the effort and the financial resources into serving our gaming needs on our very modular platform as best they can.    It's for that reason that, even if my interest in a game is only passing; even if it's not my ""genre"" and I'll probably only play it once or twice before letting it rust in my steam queue, I'll still find a way to buy most games that some special amazing company finds their way to bring to my platform of choice.

I'm not ideologically against wrappers if they give me a solid experience with performance on par with the original Windows version.  Because let's not kid ourselves: there have been native ports that have had abysmal performance coughcoughDyingLightcoughcough and there are wrapper ports that work wonderfully. Native does not necessarily mean better."
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,ExoticCarMan,2,Tue Jul 21 05:20:05 2015 UTC,"I had heard that CDP are doing TW3 in house, so it's unclear whether it will be a wrapper or native port anyway.

The comment ""Of course I will not be giving it away (wild speculation is too much fun), but lets just say its a game that has been asked for literally thousands of times. It's also personally one of my favorite games of all time.""   This sounds it is a Fahrenheit like classic cult game  All these facts almost scream Kotor 2 to me. It is not on Mac and it is cult game (though, they did a lot of SW franchise... so, not really by my claim). Not to mention you can't see any post where people wouldn't be asking Aspyr developers for it   If it is, then hats of to Aspyr and their choice of best games of all time.

Sad thing is that expecting them to realize that less consoles and more games sold would mean more money... nah, not gonna happen"
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,1338h4x,3,Tue Jul 21 01:00:57 2015 UTC,"Consoles are about more than gaming these days, and without customers investing directly into their brand of consoles, they will have a harder time pushing their media services which make them lots of money. With those, as well as PlayStation Plus' mandatory subscription fees for online gaming and other perks, I suspect they're more than recouping their losses.  Plus, the hardware will likely break even or become profitable much sooner than PS3 did, since it's already old nowadays, and the price hasn't dropped at all. They're also pushing downloaded games harder now, and that eliminates the overhead of physical media, which increases profits, too.  I think they're doing well enough that although they might sell more games on other platforms, the might not make as much money, and they would lose the name recognition and branding, to a degree. In any case, now is not the time to even consider it, as they're basically on top again now, having already moved more PS4s than Xone and WiiU combined.  If PS4 was a flop like PS3's early days (and if PS3 hadn't caught up to X360), then we might be having a different discussion right now."
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,madhi19,3,Tue Jul 21 01:14:38 2015 UTC,"That is one hard claim (do not confuse this with me not agreeing with your points, this is just counter viewpoint on them). This gen lifetime will be much shorter than previous one for all the reasons you named.   They started with mediocre hw unlike previous gen (makes this gen shorter due to competition) Previous gen had optimization advantage. This time PC starts with Vulkan and DX12 which are more or less the same thing as console APIs or at least there is no significant gain (This gen won't be saved for few additional years by optimizing, which makes lifetime even shorter) One of advantages, just works and simple gaming interface is not there anymore. Console interfaces have gotten as bloated as usual PC. And PC actually gets simple gaming interface Add to this no more free net services. All the more reason to move somewhere else 4K is just around the corner and both consoles have problems handling 1080p@60Hz (even shorter lifetime) People used to buy consoles for cheaper gaming, this is again turning around. Games on PC are cheaper and gaming PC doesn't cost fortune anymore (with every year gap in price-performance will be bigger and this again creates console lifetime even shorter)   Whole Console-PC thing has turned upside down this gen and I really wouldn't put my balls where it is even remotely dangerous to back my or your view ;)"
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,Swiftpaw22,3,Tue Jul 21 01:28:51 2015 UTC,"Some excellent points, really. If done right, Steam Machines could be coming out at just the right time to really disrupt things. The power of PC gaming with the convenience of consoles, and a unique controller that actually facilitates genres typically not present or heavily watered-down on consoles. Plus no game library resetting every few years... Console guys say backwards compatibility doesn't matter, but really it does. Microsoft knows that too, hence why they announced it for Xone at E3 this year.  At worst, Steam Machines are unknowns at this point, but so are things like PlayStation Now, which - in theory at least - could actually eliminate the need for a future generation of console by simply making gamers stream games, which could run on much more powerful systems at the server farms. Basically like OnLive, but with a large installed base and trusted brand name. I don't know if that's where Sony wants to go, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.  It's certainly an exciting time, but for me particularly, as a long-time Linux user (I switched exclusively in 2002, but went to consoles for my gaming fix due to Loki's demise and LGP's slowness [still waiting on that Disciples 2 port...]). I even put my PS4 plans on indefinite hiatus once Valve announced SteamOS/Machines. I may still have to get one for the new NIER game, though... Expensive game that would make it, but the original is my 2nd favorite game of all time and I must play it (maybe I could borrow someone's PS4...). Anyhow, I went a little off-topic there."
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,blackout24,3,Tue Jul 21 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"Main problem is that as much as my points are right, so are yours. They are just counter views for the same thing. Hence... no way I'm putting my balls on that claim ;)  I wouldn't bet on streaming. For some light game or predictable like strategies, yes. On fast paced game... nope. If you looked at NVidia Grid presentation, that was total lagfest. Not to mention people don't have google fiber as minimal internet option like NVidia had it there.  Maybe it is just me, but even on my PS3 (now R.I.P.) I was bothered with 100ms lag when I used controller over blutooth. It drove me crazy until I finally switched to USB cable. The NVidia Grid lag... nah, I couldn't game like that for 5min  My console experience is completely different. I switched exclusively to Linux in '95 and used consoles for whole that time due to my distaste for Windows and Mac and lack of games on Linux. But, as a gamer from PS1 era, last gen was total disaster at least for me. Unlike PS1/PS2 where games worked flawless, PS3 was complete fiasco and there is 0 chance on even thinking about PS4. Also, unlike PS1/PS2 where gaming was not disturbed, PS3 was more of a fiasco than most PC computers my friends used. In terms of problems, it was even worse. And I doubt PS4 will be any better just by looking at the interface clutter they stucked inside"
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,onemorereddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:10 2015 UTC,"I know this is OT, so my apologies first. Feel free to mod it down for being OT  After a good sleep, I somehow find my NVidia Grid lacking facts and the fact alone that NVidia is NVidia and Sony is Sony.  So, here is the look based on facts related to Sony and why their streaming probably couldn't ever work.  History first:   PSN is probably single worst service in the world. In my history if any game used PSN for online, bad experience was too good to be said about it. (and if you can't do one server for your game without immense lag, forget you'll ever do something like streaming) Sony couldn't even set up online shops for 2/3 of countries where their products were sold. In case of our country, you only got ""Sorry..."" and we were required to ask friends from other countries to buy something. (setting up online shop is much cheaper than setting up regional supercomputers and Sony was too cheap even for those) When PSN got hacked, whole lot of sad truths came out. Like running unpatched servers, disabled firewalls... and so on. (If some network service is your money, you'd invest in admins not marketing, Sony did opposite) Sony is driven by profit, not quality. PS4 is pure example of that. Unlike previous gen where they invested in design much more than in marketing. PS4 was thrown together from random (cheap) PC parts while majority of money went into marketing Also, PS3 fiasco int GetRandomNumber() { return(4); }  proves that   Now the other side   Network bandwidth is far from quality game streaming. Network bandwidth only defines how much you can send, not how fast data reaches destination (there are physical limitations to it) Still, bandwidth speed and transfer speed again mean shit. Big part of lag is latency in time where server needs to respond to client. (Just looking at Sony history, their supercomputers will probably be powered by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS5O9C72O18 ) Again, the client-server latency is conditioned by how many clients request at the same time. More clients = more latency (Sarcastic here. According to Sony history one 386 will drive millions of users) And there is a fact where I need to return to transfer speed. If you live too far from that computer farm... lag. That would mean Sony would have to set up regional farms (Sigh, if they can't do online shops... do I need to continue?)   Update: There was one game that was exception to that rule (Far from best online experience ever, but by far best one I had on PS3). Demon's souls. But, it was not by design, it was by fluke. After seeing final product Sony pulled the game and decided on releasing in Asia only, so they set up (and hardcoded) local servers. Game went viral and was published in US next where they set up their own servers since game was not compatible with asian release. This was followed by EU release and since game was again incompatible, they set up EU servers. Now, lets fast forward the history and look at Dark Souls... compared to Demon's souls online was dang terrible and main reason there was, was the fact that they expected to sell it everywhere and took cheapest possible approach to work like that"

I honestly can see the Playstation and Xbox becoming a ""premium"" Steam Machine or something similar, with Sony's own marketplace on-board too. As it is with the XBO and PS4, the only difference comes down to the custom APUs and software, install Linux on the x86 CPU (ie. Not hardware support holding them back) and you've pretty much made it a Steam Machine.  Wouldn't be the first time they've worked together with Steam, too."

But I was thinking, if it's even remotely similar to the Mass Effect games, I might like it nowadays, after having played 2 and 3 on PS3. But I know really very little about the KOTOR games."
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,paradin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"I generally don't like Bioware games (Mass Effect being the exception). I find them structurally crude (so much transparent backtracking), narratively poor and lacking any real roleplaying to make up for those faults. I can never find the much-vaunted moral ambiguity/tough decisions in these games. Most choices seem to be moral binaries - do you want to pet the kitten or torture it? And the narrative choices (branching conversational choices usually, never emergent or experimental) never seem to satisfy a position I would want to take. Do you want to become a Jedi because you love everything about the Jedi and will follow them without question or do you hate the Jedi and want to kill them all? Well... neither (I realise I can take a sort of 'neither' position later, but that's not the point). The available options rarely come close to satisfying me. I'm not being a picky asshole (or I may be, but that's a side issue) - I'm perfectly prepared to go for the one that vaguely goes in the direction I was thinking/feeling but often there just simply isn't an option that represents even a vague direction I'm willing to go in.  With Bioware games in general and Kotor games in particular (they're the worst for it, in my experience) I feel like I'm living someone else's story rather than making my own or even playing a role within that story. Which is fine if it's a good story, but they're not. Their games, to my mind, have far more in common with point and click adventure games than with RPGs. They just happen to have stats.  That's the big stuff for me. If the story were less sophomoric I could forgive a lot. But everything else is clunky too. The combat is dreadful (it's different between 1 and 2 and I forget which is which) - what should be this tense, action-packed, fluid encounter is instead this jarring semi-paused mess of hideous, confusing interfaces and fiddly buttons which destroys any sense of immersion you'd managed to muster and feels like a completely separate, context-less experience. Exploring is dull in the minimally-interactive (but fucking massive - they want you to spend a long time walking (slowly) back and forth between (empty) places) populated with cut-and-pasted non-interactive scenery, cut-and-pasted non-interactive dead-eyed NPC mannequins and the odd NPC side-quest giver who babbles unconvincingly about whether you want to help his family or murder them.  For me Mass Effect worked. The story was the same story Bioware tell every time but it was dressed up nicely. The conversational choices were vaguer (which was a smart move) better-enabling them to fit to what the player intended. The combat and exploration were fun (still loads of backtracking of course) and some of the environments were genuinely impressive (loved the Citadel in ME1). There was the usual Biowarey stuff like finding out that you committed genocide between 1 and 2 somehow despite not playing the DLC. But overall they got more right than wrong (1 in particular).  And... I did love Star Wars. It was pretty much the entirety of my childhood. The prequels killed all that, of course, but when I first played KoToR I still had enough romance for the setting that I very much wanted to like it.  And I have many friends who insist that the Kotors are masterpieces. And every time it comes up they convince me, again, to give it a chance. If I'd only get to this bit then I'd see the magnificence of it. Oh I got to that bit? Then you have to get to this bit, you'll definitely see it there. Yeah yeah I know you have to backtrack between here and the other 5 places you've been to 250 times before you can do that but it's worth it. Trust me, I mean it this time.  I like Morrowind.  (To be honest, if Kotor 2 is the game that gets announced I'll be disappointed but probably buy it, if only to throw some support Aspyr's way. And I'll give it yet another go to see if I can find the amazing game that everyone else is convinced is in there. Maybe this time I'll finally get it.)"
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,liamdawe,2,Tue Jul 21 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"KOTOR2 was actually by Obsidian if I recall, though I don't know if that's a good thing. They also did Fallout New Vegas, which didn't hold my attention like Fallout 3 did - not that FONV was bad, but I could NOT get into Alpha Protocol, which they also were responsible for and I think was a closer game, style-wise, to Mass Effect and KOTOR.  I haven't played a ton of Morrowind because I only had it on Xbox and hated the gamepad at the time. I did just buy it recently to grab the data with SteamCMD for use with OpenMW, though the UI is too small to play on my TV right now (they're adding scaling options, I heard!). I would LOVE if we'd get Oblivion on Linux. That'd be like a dream come true for me, but it's simply not likely to ever happen. Maybe after OpenMW, in the distant future... I can hope, anyhow! Skyrim, which I really loved (even got the Platinum Trophy) I found was too... hmm... focused, perhaps. Kinda like you said about BioWare's games, I felt like I was playing a character - the Dragonborn - and the world and sidequests felt more confined and smaller or something. I dunno. I played over 80 hours of Oblivion without even touching the storyline quest. It felt like I was actually exploring a world and playing how I wanted to play."
linux_gaming,3dzgq7,dryadofelysium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kinda lump Bioware, Obsidian and Black Isle all together. They essentially (in my view) make the same kinda things. Having said that I did recently enjoy Pillars of Eternity and found Alpha Protocol to be interesting. Deeply deeply flawed but really the first time anyone'd tried to do something Deus Exish since Deus Ex.  Could never get into New Vegas. It was clearly better than FO3 in some ways but, as usual, I just couldn't get over their heavy-handed, rigid approach to narrative. FO3 was far from perfect but I did get lost in it (and felt free doing so) for a long time.  Morrowind is, jointly with Deus Ex, my favourite game of all time. It is, again, hugely flawed but its flaws grow from its ambition, which I'm always forgiving of. And its sheer scope, depth (both in terms of narrative/law/culture/philosophy and also emergent mechanical systems) make up for a lot. No game has felt more like a living world to me.  The way Skyrim feels in relation to Oblivion for you is kinda how Oblivion feels in relation to Morrowind for me. It's a great game but it's... pale, compared to Morrowind. I'm not sure one can go back though. By which I mean playing Morrowind now might feel as clunky to you as playing Daggerfall feels to me. Morrowind is also punishing at the start.  Does sound like you could potentially love Morrowind though so if you ever have the inclination I'd give it a(nother) go. If you can get through the first 5-20 hours (which is essentially your characters birth - up to that point you decide who and what you are. You can't actually be it until you're ready) it opens up enormously.  (I wrote this quick guide to not being fucked by rats for the first 20 hours the other day)."

It doesn't challenge anything, it doesn't argue for anything, it's just there so that one group of stupid people will point at it and say ""That's what video games are like, and that's why they're bad"" and another group of stupid people will say ""Those assholes are attacking our freedom of speech, we'll celebrate it by buying this"". (Also, a group of eleven year olds will buy it because they hope it will piss off their parents, or because they think it's aimed at people with severe issues and having severe issues sounds way cooler than being eleven.)

linux_gaming,3dyolq,PandaHammer,3,Mon Jul 20 18:58:15 2015 UTC,"Fully agreed.  We needed to get to this point, too, because if everyone always said ""yes"" to games, the shitty Linux releases and ports would only get worse.  To be honest though we all hit our limits a long time ago.  I've only donated to ~250 out of ~1400 Steam games.  I feel a lot of the gems have already been unearthed, that there was a rush to get lots of the best games on Linux, and now we're in this rut waiting on more actual good games to come down the pipe.  Not that there aren't still a lot of gems that could come, but sadly their developers don't seem to be interested."

It isn't a game I would play much, but when I'm in the right mood and looking to vent off some steam, it would make for an entertaining couple of hours. I love Postal 2, and the only reason I didn't care much for the first Postal was the crappy controls and poor aiming."
linux_gaming,3dyolq,Uradamus,3,Mon Jul 20 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"I have Postal on Steam and on disc from back in the day... Never got into it either. I'll have to give Postal 2 a shot. I've had it in my library for a long time, but only barely tried it out - enough to say ""it runs"" and that's about it. I'd have to read some reviews before I bought Hatred - or it would have to be super cheap or in a bundle."
linux_gaming,3dyolq,FreakyCheeseMan,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:03 2015 UTC,"I'll likely wait to get it pretty cheap as well. This was a decent review by Mack from Worth A Buy on YouTube: https://youtu.be/qsOwwQT3hJw  Postal 2 is way better than the first, they aren't even all that similar. The first was a 2D top down shooter game that was focused on a guy's downward spiral into paranoia, insanity and self-destruction. It was a pretty dark game as far as the story goes.  The second however is a 3D FPS that doesn't even remotely take itself serious. There is a lot of humor and the town the game takes place in seems normal at first glance but quickly shows its true colors as you run into all the crazies. The game is very dated and clunky at this point, but still a lot of fun if you are into that sort of game. The latest update has improved the game and opened up the achievements and workshop. Though I am still waiting for the Paradise Lost DLC port to be released which looks pretty fun as well."

linux_gaming,3dxcnu,ProfessorKaos64,13,Mon Jul 20 13:55:46 2015 UTC,"My full opinion on the 60FPS thing:  I don't particularly care about 60FPS. I've always been behind the curve hardware-wise, so I'm used to playing games with lowered details and/or worse framerate. I'm pretty happy with 30. 60 is better, but I see 60FPS vs 30FPS as similar to HDTV vs SDTV - yes, the former is better, but the latter is still okay for most things. I don't need to see the news anchor's nose hair to really fully experience the news.  Regarding totalbiscuit's steam curator and this list and such... I'm okay with it. I don't think it ""shames"" anyone or ""strongarms"" anyone. It's a list of facts, do with it what you will. If you do something stupid, I'll think it's stupid."
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,hirnbrot,15,Mon Jul 20 11:42:31 2015 UTC,"that's right but people that have better specs than low should be able to get most of their hardware out and get the experience they desire and paid for. i have a low-end gaming pc with a GT 730 OC and FX-4300 but still i prefer to set the resolution and details down to get at least over 40-50 fps stable, tried to play BL2 with the 30fps cap but it felt weird as shit."

linux_gaming,3dxcnu,Rubykuby,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"What's terrible about it?  It covers the arguments for and against the list, what else are you looking for?"
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,robertcrowther,13,Mon Jul 20 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, here goes.   The title is clickbait. PC Gamers KILLING GAMES????????? No they're not. It acts on the false presumption that a subjective opinion cannot encourage objective discourse. I'm vegetarian. I can make a list of all restaurants that have vegetarian dishes. That is an objective list that is useful to vegetarians. Why can't someone who likes 60 FPS games also not create a list of games that do/do not lock FPS? It's binomially distributed, so it doesn't really matter which of the two lists they make. The shortest list is the easiest to make, so they chose to create a list of locked titles. It thinks that this list is a blacklist and punishes developers. This is just insane. Does a list of non-vegetarian restaurants punish those restaurants? Of course not. They wouldn't have got those sales in the first place, but now it's easier for vegetarians to find out where and where not to go. Likewise, people who don't like FPS locks wouldn't have bought the game either. This list has only made it easier for them to access that information. Consumer advocacy is not a bad thing, and this video would have it otherwise. As a gamer, it is in your interest that games aren't locked at 30 FPS. Advocating against FPS locks is not a bad thing; it's a way of showing companies what the audience wants. Companies tend to listen to their consumers, because they want to make money. ""The list is too comprehensive"" is a serious quote from that video. It's a list, for fuck's sake. The list covers every game that is locked at 30 FPS. Were you expecting anything else? It is up to the consumer to make a judgement about whether or not they want to buy the game. The list itself does not make any judgements of value. ""It's effectively telling consumers to not buy a game based on framerate"" is a fucking lie. It's an objective list. It's not telling you to do anything. The consumer can make up their own mind about wanting to buy an FPS-locked game. This list only provides a service to them in making it easier to figure out whether an FPS lock exists. ""There are development realities that maybe prevent 60 FPS from ever happening"" is a fucking lie. Incompetence is not an excuse. There is no reason at all why a game can't run at high framerates, or why it must be locked. Maybe modern hardware isn't fast enough, and that's fine, but that doesn't mean the framerate has to be locked. This list informs consumers. Informed consumers is always a good thing. The morons from this video think otherwise.   If an audience wants something, and the seller is not providing that, then they are not getting sales. Supply and demand. This is economy 101."
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,Rubykuby,-3,Mon Jul 20 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"You seem to have watched a different video to me where they said nothing positive at all about the list (though, to be clear, they're actually discussing the Steam curator page that was created as a predecessor to this list).   Having watched several of these guy's videos I think the title was intentionally ironic, though I agree the end result is clickbaity A quote from the video: ""we can appreciate the function behind this list even if the reasons for creating it were a little duplicitous"" See 2 Following on from the above quote: ""anything which provides more information to the consumer is a good thing"" Personally I agree that Baldurs Gate does not need to run at 60FPS even if you don't find the phrasing to your liking, and a quote from the video: ""be informed, inform yourself more than anything, and make your own decision"" Another quote: ""it's a good reminder that this sort of information should be available on Steam store pages by default"" They're discussing a reddit post, allegedly from a game developer, should they have misrepresented it? Here's a quote from the video: ""there's a group which does care about this stuff and they'll use this, which is good"""
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,robertcrowther,3,Mon Jul 20 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"Sure, they said positive things about the list.  That doesn't absolve them of being blatently wrong about there being any negative aspects to it.  This very much reminds me of the teach the controversy campain - arguing for both sides doesn't absolve you of making a coherent argument.  To be specific, I am appaled at the claim that the list was created with some ""darker issue"" involved with making the list, and saying that it is ""a little duplicitious"", to use the same quote as you.  There is no darker issue, no duplicity, and you won't find any shred of evidence to back up those claims."

linux_gaming,3dxcnu,Rubykuby,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"So they see a list (a curator page is still a list) that informs consumers, and they make up all sorts of reasons why that could be bad to create a storm in a teacup.  I haven't seen a single good argument (that is pro-consumer) against the existence a list that informs consumers on the technical details of a game. That makes the entire video just a bunch of clickbait."

linux_gaming,3dxcnu,YAOMTC,-11,Tue Jul 21 03:13:27 2015 UTC,Actually wasting resources on drawing more frames than necessary is a sign of poor programming. 60FPS is towards the upper end of human perception already. All those people who circlejerked about having 200 vs. 300FPS in older games are the real idiots.
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,Taladar,17,Mon Jul 20 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"Just so you understand why you're being downvoted -  This is wrong for multiple reasons. Input in games is often locked to framerate which can make an action-oriented game seem much more smooth at higher framerates beyond the vertical refresh rate.  Secondly, 60FPS is chosen because 99% of the monitors on the market have a 60hz refresh rate. Some monitors have 144hz refresh rates, but they often cost a lot more. It has nothing to do with human perception.  On the actual topic of 60FPS being a ""threshold"" of human perception - research shows that airforce pilots can detect changes at 220FPS, so 60FPS is definitely not the upper end of human perception, albeit these are highly trained professionals(...but so are many people who play esports?,) and some young adults can detect changes at temporal gaps of 2 milliseconds(or, 500 FPS)  To put it bluntly, to not notice the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS you'd probably have to be a senior that never had good temporal awareness to begin with."
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,nan0A,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:27:13 2015 UTC,"I never said 60FPS was not justified, I just said that much more than that is a waste, particularly running as fast as possible up to any frame rate. I agree that locking input to frame rate is bad programming but also increasingly rare.  The study you linked has the absolute outer edge of the one standard deviation error bar at 2ms, the average is at 20ms. This means there is about a 5% chance that there exists some person somewhere on earth who can perceive a 2ms change in whatever method they used for testing (most likely something like a whole screen flashing, not a minor difference in a stream of almost identical images. This does not mean that this person would notice any difference between a 450FPS and a 500FPS game."
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,Taladar,4,Mon Jul 20 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"I just said that much more than that is a waste, particularly running as fast as possible up to any frame rate.   A waste of what? Clock cycles? What do you suppose those ""wasted"" clock cycles should do instead? Be used to output better graphics? What if the graphics are already set to max?  You want a game to use all available resources. If you don't want a game to use all available resources, there is - in well-programmed games - an option to artificially limit the framerate.  There is literally no waste. If I have a 144 Hz monitor and I want my stuff to run at 144+ FPS, then the game developer is a fucking retard if they artificially limit my ability to do what I want to do with my hardware.  There is a noticeable difference between 30 and 60 FPS. And there is a similar difference between 60 and 144 Hz. The problem is that a lot of people deny this existence because they've never seen a 144 Hz monitor before.  And all that it takes to allow those people to have their framerates? Being a half-decent programmer and not tying your game logic to framerate."
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,Rubykuby,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:53:40 2015 UTC,A waste of what?   Power. Hardware lifetime due to running at higher temperatures if used 100% constantly. CPU cycles you could use on other applications running on your system at the time.
linux_gaming,3dxcnu,Taladar,4,Tue Jul 21 06:18:33 2015 UTC,You're not wasting resources... You're just using the resources that are available. A lot of good games offer a way to limit the framecount if you want to use less processor cycles

Have you tried monitoring GPU temperatures while you're playing?  The nvidia-settings application shows that information.  Do you get crashes or lock-ups with other graphic-intensive programs?  Try running as many instances of gputest as you have processor cores and see if you have issues with that as well -- this could rule out CS as being the culprit.  Is this happening only in online games?  Or also in offline games with bots?  I can play for hours offline with bots with no issues, but I'll almost always crash or lock up during my first online competitive match -- I've just resorted to booting into Windows to play competitive CS, unfortunately.  I can't find a fix for it and I've been looking for months.  I've ONLY found CS to have this issue.  I used to have the same GPU as you, but it actually failed earlier this year, which started causing crashes in other applications in both Linux and Windows.  So I'd exercise that GPU thoroughly to make sure you're not having GPU issues in general.  Please post back if you get further with this issue.  I'd love to have a fix so I can quit booting into Windows for just CS...  Also, if you find a relevant issue on the github page, you should create a post there too.  EDIT: Check out (and/or cross-post to) /r/GlobalOffensiveLinux/ as well."

It shows up as a Linux game in my library and the install button is there, but it won't install anything yet.  Not too fussed though, I bought the bundle mostly for a few of the music albums included (Smokey Bastard and Ye Banished Privateers), the games were mostly just a bonus/afterthought.

EDIT:Anyone care to Explain why I was wrong before downvoting me? I mean it's not like I use wine solely for gaming I also play native games.

linux_gaming,3dwyz2,RadicalizedAtheist,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:11 2015 UTC,The thing is Wine on a whole is not the problem even though this sub hates it for no reason.I mean even some developers use Wine to test whether Linux is a viable market for their games and release it later as a native port if it outperforms their tiny expectations.What is the problem is developers using that lame excuse of Wine for not doing native ports and you believing what they are saying is true.

linux_gaming,3dxoa4,devel_watcher,7,Mon Jul 20 12:57:19 2015 UTC,"To start discussing a switch, you need a very real objective reason. Real-life example of the reason of such strength can be: ""I'll need a week fulltime to set up a build/debug environment for you on Windows."".  The ""Linux Question"" in gaming area is about compatibility, tolerance and equality.  People that use Windows should treat the fact that some games are not running for you on Linux as a problem of the developers. Because the developers are not respecting compatibility, tolerance and equality.  So, any player have a reason to pay attention to the ""Linux Question"", because these values are very popular in the countries we live in."
linux_gaming,3dxoa4,brianinthered,2,Mon Jul 20 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"Good point, sometimes the only way to convince someone is by them using Linux.  You can talk and talk but until they experience it first-hand, they won't fully understand. There is so much freedom with Linux and being able to choose your own desktop environment, windows manager, package manager, etc. Those are the kind of elements in Windows you are stuck with.  Most Windows gamers don't know or care about customizing how your Operating System runs.  They just want their games to run. With Linux there is an ability to make games run faster just by configuring your own system.  Hardware and drivers are a HUGE part of that, but you still get to choose what happens in the background and the foreground."
linux_gaming,3dxoa4,Adderbox76,10,Mon Jul 20 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a linux user.  I gave up my Windows partitions a long long time ago.  But I can sort of agree with your co-host.  You want to concentrate on Linux gaming.  Okay.  What is a Linux game?  There are games that are Windows only.  There are games that are available on Windows AND Linux.  But there aren't very many well known games that are Linux only.  So having a channel devoted to ""Linux Gaming"" seems kind of pointless.  He doesn't need to be a ""Linux Gamer"" because there are simply no games you can suggest to him that he would NEED to have Linux in order to play.  He can play any game you can.  You can't do the same.  That's just the truth.  The best you can do, and what you should do, is instead start to focus the stream on games that are accessible on BOTH platforms.  He can do his Windows thing, and you can do the Linux thing.  Eventually you'll come across games that run waaaaaay better on Linux than on Windows (It happens a lot...cough cough...KSP 32 bit Windows version...Ha Ha).  Once he sees games that are available for both platforms he MIGHT come around, but even if he doesn't, who cares, there are no games he's missing out on by not using Linux, the same can't be said vice versa.    At least doing it this way, you're not pressuring him, and you're adding value to your Linux viewers at the same time."

Inkscape   Same remark as for Photoshop, though the goals of the two projects are less different. But for actual work, you can't avoid Illustrator as people are going to ask you .ai files.   Microsoft Office with Libre Office   Yes, this could work in most case, but if it's for an advanced use of Spreadsheets and Presentations in a professional environment, you really can't ditch Excel at the moment.   Windows Media Player with VideoLan Player   Free bonus points... :)   WinRar with 7zip   Same as with the previous item.

I know in the professional/business world those open source projects aren't going to replace the Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk products, but some people are able to use them at home just fine. Some of them even work in PlayOnLinux/Wine as well. I have been using SketchUp 2015 in PlayOnLinux and it works perfectly except the Ruby plugins aren't functional yet.  But the vanilla release has no problems and runs smoothly on my GeForce 550 Ti.  All that is required is someone who is willing to take extra steps with trial-n-error and research to get something working in Linux. Not every Windows program will run and not ever open-source option will replace Windows programs.  It really depends on what you do with your computer. But its still a good point, if someone is hung up on one program and yet most of their games run in Linux, then they might as well give it a try. In the business world its not going to happen.  Most businesses are stuck with Microsoft, Adobe and Autodesk products."

There is no point in buying a game to play it with wine where the developer does not support it. I would rather the devs to use a wrapper (wine or not) where they would have to do the support.  Also I play most of my game on Steam, I don't fancy to have to start one on linux and one for wine.  It's a shame. I loved The Walking Dead Season 1, played on PS3, but decided to switch to PC for convenience and I am using Linux only (again for convenience). I am fed up to have to look for CDs an stuff for the PS3. It sound like SteamOS have been made for me :)"
linux_gaming,3dwz25,poopyfartclocks,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"I would generally agree, except that I continue to support games that have no foreseeable Linux port, because I enjoy the games and I can't really blame the developers for not caring. TWD is a good example, and Life Is Strange as well. Great series and they play very well on WINE. Sure, the framerate isn't perfect, and you have to jump through some hoops.

linux_gaming,3dwz25,liamdawe,4,Mon Jul 20 07:30:32 2015 UTC,Your comment sounds very naive. You know how this ends: Linux users dual boot. Do you prefer that?
linux_gaming,3dwz25,liamdawe,14,Mon Jul 20 07:32:49 2015 UTC,"Conversely, what incentive is there too produce Linux-supported games if Linux users are content buying Widows versions and running them through Wine.  The idea isn't necessarily a native port, but something supported. A situation where the developer acknowledges us for what we are, and actively makes an effort... Rather than Telltale's ""we can't be arsed because you're not worth it"" line."
linux_gaming,3dwz25,uoou,7,Mon Jul 20 08:38:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly the point I'm trying to make, buying the Windows version will just keep showing the Windows market, not ours."

linux_gaming,3dwz25,uoou,6,Mon Jul 20 11:26:51 2015 UTC,"No, my comment comes from understanding how it all works. You clearly don't actually care to progress Linux gaming if you're advocating using Wine. Buying a Windows game supports Windows, is that seriously that hard to grasp?"
linux_gaming,3dwz25,robertcrowther,3,Mon Jul 20 08:01:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you but /u/YanderMan's point is fair too.  If Linux doesn't have the capacity to play these games then it's another reason not to use Linux (for some).  Put another way: While we'd all rather that people only play supported Linux games, given that people are going to play Windows games, would you prefer that they do so under Wine on Linux or under Windows?  You're right, of course, that dickhole devs can point to Wine as a reason not to bother with Linux. But /u/YanderMan is right that playing Windows games under Linux (and therefore actually using Linux) is better (for Linux) than using Windows.  It's complicated."
linux_gaming,3dwz25,adolson,4,Mon Jul 20 08:52:04 2015 UTC,"Complicated yes, and not a totally black and white issue. It's good that Wine exists, but for old games. Imagine the amount of people that try games like this in Wine/POL/Whatever and see lots of issues like much worse performance, bugs etc: They will blame Linux, we've seen it enough times. So, a lot of the time, it's actually worse than using Windows, as they will talk about how crap Linux is for gaming, because it was a Windows game in Wine."
linux_gaming,3dwz25,liamdawe,5,Mon Jul 20 08:54:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry to add more but I also want to say (not because I think you had anything wrong, just because I think this stuff needs discussing)...  I think your argument about Wine putting people off Linux due to being fiddly and flaky (while absolutely correct) muddies your position.  (I'm sure you think similarly, I'm just throwing this in as part of the discussion...) Even if Wine were perfect. Like even if it ran any Windows game or application with absolutely no configuration, hassle or performance loss whatsoever and would continue to do so in perpetuity, regardless of what new frameworks MS invented... it would still, ultimately, be a bad thing. Because game makers would still be locked into the whole MS/DX/walled garden way of working and a big part of all this is escaping from that."

I like the HoMM I/II-like appearance of OpenTTD very much.  I'm not saying this project is without merit, but OpenTTD's current graphics don't deserve such a low grade. They are good in their own way. Not to mention that there are hundreds of extra NewGRFs to expand the game, all matching the old-school theme."
linux_gaming,3dv1mx,h-v-smacker,16,Sun Jul 19 20:37:24 2015 UTC,"I think they are confusing graphics resolution with quality. It's true, (open)TTD has a rather low resolution, but the artists did a fantastic job working in the medium; if you look closely, you see that almost all pixels suggest details, there are no fillers or squandered spaces. So it gives a very detailed and bustling impression.   However, the pineapple models don't really add any detail. The additional space is mostly filled with simple gradients or repetitive patterns, giving an overall bland and blob-like look. What's the point of cranking up the resolution if you're not going to make any use of it?  Though what's even more important, IMO, is that it breaks with the old aesthetics. I have always thought that (open)TTD looked like a model railway set. You just want to pick the trains up and play with them. The pineapple models on the other hands have the feel of an uninspired tablet game. I think that, e.g. Gold Rush, even though it aims for a completely different theme, stays much closer to the aesthetics of OpenTDD."

I have tons of ideas for VCMI and several unfinished patches, but I can't work on them because I'm busy making money to live. :-(  Also even if there is few hobbyist programmers there just no chance that VCMI may get actual free assets without appropriate funding because 3D models and texturing is costly. So it's would be great to see if guys from OTTD community can get funding as this huge help for any developer/artist.  PS: To make it more clear what I wanna say is that money could boost development or assets creation a lot and there is nothing wrong to crowdfund something when person already did work on same kind of project. A lot of open source projects include games already benefit from Google Summer of Code for example.   So it's only good thing if eventually community start to support developers that brave enough to start crowdfunding. Because for infrastructure projects there is Google, Red Hat, SUSE and others fund lead developers, but for FOSS games no one doing that and no one will except community."

linux_gaming,3dtq8b,teren9,11,Sun Jul 19 10:59:23 2015 UTC,"I'd get a Nvidia card. GPU passthrough would require a lot of specific hardware and an extra GPU. Vulkan won't make a huge difference and it won't be commonplace for a long time.  I'm using a GTX 760 which isn't the most powerful but it has managed everything I've tried on high settings on a single 1080p screen, so depending on what you want to spend I'd recommend that or above (watch out with the brand new cards, might need some driver faffing on some distros)."
linux_gaming,3dtq8b,Manypopes,3,Sun Jul 19 11:33:34 2015 UTC,"Very true, GTX760 here and its been a champ on a single 1080p. I never really worry if anything is going to run well on it :)  (( apart from ARK , what the hell is up with that abomination ? ))"
linux_gaming,3dtq8b,meggerman,6,Sun Jul 19 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"I know the Linux drivers for Intel..... are much better   nice one  If you're serious about going linux for gaming then getting an nvidia gpu is your best option.  gpu passthrough won't get you much further from dual-booting and I wouldn't ever consider buying kvm capable components so as to run games on windows rather than buying an nvidia card.  Vulkan will take time to mature and get included in games, will not guarantee you a complete amd change of heart when it comes to linux support (though it should be easier for them to catch up should they feel like doing so) and even then it won't make your current and soon to be released games perform any better since they're probably never going to get an alternative vulkan renderer anyway.  most blizzard games run nicely on wine (except the buggy bnet versions) though heroes of the storm isn't the best example. I'm using a gtx970 and tested hots (32bit) some 1.5 month+ ago. The game seems to be a bit ressource intensive though I could get it to run at great performance in high settings (above 40 with most settings set to high or max). I have to admit I hated that game, expected more from blizzard, thus I didn't play for more than an hour, yet performance seemed reasonable.  I truly believe getting an nvidia gpu is the best possible choice for performance gains right now."
linux_gaming,3dtq8b,kon14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the fast reply :D When I've said I'd wait for Vulkan I meant that I'd stick with Windows and wait, say, a year or so before making the move. In the meantime I could enjoy another accessory(such as a new screen for instance) as my GPU still performs pretty well on Windows.    I see most of the replies say I should pick an nVidia card, but will it  run, say, wine games (HoTS) as good as my current AMD card on Windows? Or at least comparable? (I'm sure native games will work just fine. What scares me are non-native games)   Edit: when I'm talking about wine, I come from a position of one who doesn't mind messing with it until it works. also I don't mind paying for cedega if necessary. Their work should be reworded and as long as it gets things done and it works, I'm all for it."
linux_gaming,3dtq8b,weeble42,4,Sun Jul 19 14:45:43 2015 UTC,"With Wine, you generally don't get the same frame rates as in native Linux... sometimes (particularly with older games) though, you oddly get much better overall performance.  With HoTS... it works OK in Wine, but not ""amazing"".  Your frame rates will suffer slightly.  Overall... AMD just plain sucks for gaming on Linux.  It works, but Nvidia is FAR better if you're using the proprietary drivers.  Will Nvidia run games better in Wine than AMD... from experience... yes.  IF... IF a game works, it will usually work on both AMD and Nvidia, but will work considerably better on Nvidia (with proprietary drivers).    The AMD open source drivers are improving, but they still have a long way to go.  The AMD Catalyst (proprietary) drivers are awful.  Wine... PlayOnLinux... Crossover... all work, each in their own way, some better than others for different games.  I prefer Crossver for most games, and I find Crossover works VERY well for Blizzard games.  Oh, and by the way Cedega doesn't exist anymore... hasn't been around for years now (I was a long time beta tester and contributor for Cedega). :-("
linux_gaming,3dtq8b,weeble42,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:41 2015 UTC,"Weird I was sure the guys from crossover are the same guys of Cedega. I meant to mention crossover in my previous comment (The guys that develop and main Wine).  I think this is the time I for me to run through various youtube videos of different cards that are in my budget and see them run select games with wine. What I get from this thread is either I find an Nvidia card that is a big enough change form what I already have to justify the upgrade, or I buy something else and maybe upgrade in a year or so, when prices drop and the change is more significant (and also, the state of gaming in Linux will hopefully only improve)"
linux_gaming,3dtq8b,kon14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"The Cedega guys are Transgaming.  They did ""some"" contributions back into the Wine project, but... not as much as the community felt they should have.  Crossover on the other hand are HUGE contributors to Wine.  Also... with Crossover, you can apply to be an ""advocate"", and assuming you're active, you get to contribute (bug reports, bets testing etc.) and in return they provide you with a complementary Crossover license.  They are reasonably interactive with the community.  Although... the price they ask is reasonably low... and funds more development... so.. ponying up and buying a subscription helps out as well.  For Nvidia cards.. anything ""recent"" will do.  I'm running on a GTX660Ti (which are cheaper than dirt in most places) and it's keeping up just fine - I play primarily Linux native games through Steam and Desura now (there's over 1000 games on Steam now...), and for the few Wineo games I still play (WoW on a Vanilla 1.12 server), Hearthstone, DiabloIII etc, it works perfectly.  I don't play HoTS... so can't comment on that one.  I did try it on my 660 once, and it seemed to play pretty fluidly for the 10 or 15 minutes of game play that I put it through.  I suppose if you're playing ranked games or something where millisecond twitchiness is important, it might let you down, but that'd be a WIne issue, not a video card issue."

I could retest hots for you so as to give some precise numbers, I'll just have to install it first.  Any other non-blizzard games you might be interested in wine tests? PoE is native and league used to be kinda running but for the riot store in the client if I remember correctly, not a fan of the game, quite the contrary so I can't really speak for it, especially after the latest changes in the game and the way they should work with wine."

That's how bad AMD drivers tend to be. It's not rare for AMD's top cards to perform similar to a GTX960. I'd definitely suggest buying an Nvidia GPU for your Linux installation.    If you want to try GPU pass through, I'd suggest you keep your AMD and buy an additional Nvidia (assuming your setup has two fast enough PCI Express slots). You can dedicate the AMD card to the Windows VM while making the most out of your Linux through Nvidia. Nvidia can't be passed through very well (it used to be impossible, and while it's possible now it's still messy), but AMD cards should work fine, and you need to dedicate a card to it anyway.   It's still tricky. Not every motherboard works (most CPUs do, with some exceptions such as most members of Intel's K series). But it might be worthwhile."

linux_gaming,3dr62f,totallyblasted,7,Sat Jul 18 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"Although a CLI method means you can make a script or jut a single really long command that does the whole thing for someone, and then share that.

linux_gaming,3dr62f,BURN_SHIT_NOW,4,Sun Jul 19 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"Problem with copy/paste scripts is that newbie won't know what he copy/pasted.

It is better if newbies learn trough GUI to understand what it needs to be done and then follow scripted process which at least more understandable then.  Yes, CLI rocks as hard as it gets and it is one of great Linux advantages, but if you don't know what you do and you do it as root... it is even worse than Windows users downloading software from random sites.

Is this doable?"
linux_gaming,3dr62f,Hideaki02,3,Sat Jul 18 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"Switching a GPU between operating systems usually requires resetting the GPU before handing off to a different OS.

The arch wiki has a kinda intro on how to turn off GPUs, however turning them back on has its own issues...  However now that amdgpu driver is in, hopefully soon-ish kernel control of newer gen AMD cards will make those ones a lot nicer to use for both switchable graphics and for GPU pass-through. (I can dream right?)  PS: you have the exact same hope as I do for the next time I play around with gpu pass-through!

It's will work just fine without any issues, but when it's come to device hotplug within same loaded kernel driver it's where problems start to appear and it's clearly fault of drivers themself.

Then even X server has all functionality needed for GPU hot plug.   Is the same true for USB devices or can you pass them back to the host OS when the VM is shut down?   USB devices can be dynamically passed into VM in runtime and you can also back them to host also in runtime with ""usb_add"" and ""usb_del"" commands in QEMU console.

There is several things that may boost performance to those 95%. Though it's depend on where your bottleneck was, but usually it's CPU.  So if you want try it with following options:  -vga none \ -device qxl \   QXL when used do affect CPU performance. Using those options will still keep mouse/keyboard pass working, but video device in VM won't work and won't waste resources.  -usb \ -device usb-kbd \ -device usb-mouse \   By default QEMU use virtual PS2 devices which not perfect or at least Windows can't work with them effective. It's caused lags for me in PlanetSide 2, but there was related problem in Wine so I think it's may be something wrong with game.  -no-hpet \   This just disable HPET that may make Windows guests slow. Though I didn't make any real measurement, but it's din't have any negative impact for sure.  -cpu host,hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff,hv_time,hv_vapic \   This enable Hyper-V add-ons that increase CPU performance a lot, make huge difference in games. Not going to work with crippled Nvidia drivers.  -smp 8,sockets=1,cores=4,threads=2 \   This is just right way to share CPU cores of Intel CPU to VM. E.g if you for some reason set ""8 cores with 1 thread"" this will decrease performance a lot. Many people include me failed on that point.  Also make sure that ""if=virtio"" used for drive devices. This of course require special drivers for Windows (virtio-win-0.1-XX.iso that can be found in some qemu package), but improve IO a lot."

Nvidia don't want to let you use passthrough if you have consumer (non-workstation) GPU. If Windows driver detects that OS running under KVM (or have Hyper-V features) it's won't load.  For KVM there is workaround (kvm=off) that hide hypervisor signature, but for Hyper-V add-ons there is none as far as I aware. So you likely won't be able to use some or any of them."

Sorry, but I think calling them ""add-ons"" wasn't right term really. Microsoft themself call them ""Enlightenments"" and it's basically their alternative to KVM paravirtualization features that help to increase performance.  It's nothing like software running in guest, but just some optimizations/settings that host expose to VM. So basically guest OS know it's running into virtualized environment and it's don't need to make some checks, or may use some virtualization environment features instead of emulated by virtual environment (which way more expensive).  All of those things are really low level, but they're heavily affect overall CPU performance and latency. Without those I had like 30% FPS loss in PlanetSide 2 (mainly one game I play in VM, heavily CPU-bound) and with them I get almost the same performance as when Windows running on bare metal."

The headset should work fine unless it's got some super weird/fancy features. Most of them show up as USB audio devices to my knowledge and Linux shouldn't have any issues with them.  Mouse, I'm still waiting to figure out the perfect one. Linux support, RGB lighting, decent quality/performance AND left handed versions available is a very tall order.

Maybe your problem is that because the mouse sliders are made of teflon, they tend to wear out very quickly on any surface and is even a tiny bit not a perfectly smooth one.

I have both my Razer Mamba and my Roccat Kone XTD plugged in to my machine, and side by side the difference in static friction is striking. I thought there was something wrong with me when I started with the Roccat as I couldn't click on anything precisely and it felt like I was drunk.  Edit: Naga -> Mamba"

linux_gaming,3dovw2,ancientGouda,0,Sat Jul 18 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"It's not because the driver is small; in Vulkan, you have to explicitly say what your engine name is, so they will still be employing per-benchmark or per-game hacks, that's for sure.

linux_gaming,3dovw2,DarkeoX,2,Sat Jul 18 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"because game developers aren't properly following the driver documentation or something.   Really, there are many reasons. Neither party is completely out of the blame here. From faulty and inconsistent hardware vendors GL implementations to devs that do indeed write out of spec or inefficient (in regard to vendor doc) code.   And yes, Mesa is basically the typical advantage of what an Open Source (even ignoring the Libre side) driver can provide: the code is there so no more excuses from Software vendors to say they don't understand why their code that they claim is written against the spec won't run as it should. Plus every bug a software vendor uncovers make the whole driver better for everyone.   In an ideal future, major actors in the gaming graphics engineering like Epic, Unity, DICE, Cryteck, as well console software vendors that are now considering the PC market again such as Square Enix, CC2, Capcom, SEGA would be regularly submitting features and patches for Mesa, with their engines running with excellent performance on it."

However, the later is often not true and drivers can mess up their API implementations or other unrelated things.

linux_gaming,3dmur7,dhantana,2,Sat Jul 18 08:31:19 2015 UTC,What is an in-engine trailer?
linux_gaming,3dmur7,schplat,5,Fri Jul 17 19:48:54 2015 UTC,Means the trailer is rendered completely in the game's engine and not done in a pre-rendered cinematic fashion (which may give false impressions of in-game graphics)  It's not as big of a deal now as it used to be when the quality between in-game and pre-rendered cinematic was huge.  In-game engines are getting very robust
linux_gaming,3dmur7,DarkeoX,3,Fri Jul 17 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"which may give false impressions of in-game graphics   Not contesting what you said, but seriously, we've been dealing with CG and known that it wasn't in-game footage for dozens  of years now. IMO It was hardly ever CG that gave false impressions over final game quality but rather,  extremely well scripted and heavily optimized scenes running with insane parameters on undisclosed hardware."
linux_gaming,3dmur7,schplat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"We do, yes.  But there's a segment of the market that doesn't know.  And it was more pervasive in the late 90's early 00's as we moved from 2D to 2.5D to 3D, as they hooked in new gamers who may not have known better.  But it's still good to know what is in-game engine vs pre-rendered CG.  Even if the engine is highly optimized and scripted, we know the game is capable of those graphics in game, it just may take a few generations of hardware to get there (see Skyrim/GTA4, as these are now playable under some beefy ENBs with just a single current gen nVidia card)."

linux_gaming,3dn0lm,Swiftpaw22,2,Sat Jul 18 07:17:26 2015 UTC,"I hope so, trully the more games you port the easier it gets. Most of the difficulty of porting is converting DirectX to OpenGL, sometimes some library won't be a available and a replacement one would have to be wrapped around the same names. Then there are the assumptions programmers sometimes make about the system (such as hardcoding a path, or assuming file is the same as File).  The more you do it, more examples you have on how to solve a given problem, or even have the library already ported. So I wouldn't be surprised if each release was quicker than the previous one."

That could be part of the problem. I also remember having errors involving those dependencies on occasion back when I still used a PPA for my NVIDIA propietary driver, so if you even have an NVIDIA card, you could also try installing the latest driver from their website.

Like a chroot jail if you are familiar with those things. The container they are describing in the article is using techniques closer to virtual machines in that it isolates the whole process tree from the host operating system, making the container potentially OS independent and easy to migrate. The advantages of these containers over virtual machines is low computational overhead."
linux_gaming,3dmova,Baggypants12000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"Baggypants12000 gets it right here. A Linux container is like a lightweight VM, only without the overhead of virtualization. It operates at near bare metal speeds and can access host resources like storage, video, audio etc.   A container gives you a lightweight Linux OS in which you can install apps etc. So you could be running a Debian host with multiple Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS containers. And its supported by the Linux kernel.  We have tons of apps that you can deploy in minutes at flockport without needing to install them, via containers. Mainly servers apps like Wordpress, Drupal, Discourse etc, Wine is an exception mainly to show how you can use GUI apps in containers. We have plenty of guides and tutorials on containers here for those who are interested.  Bottles are more Wine nomenclature for have an environment for specific applications and games as different apps and games may need different settings if I am not mistaken. It's in someways similar.  Here we are putting the entire Wine application in a container, so all your apps and games are in the container.  We are using the Hosts GUI and audio for accelerated video, you can't do things like this in a VM. The advantage is Wine and its apps are in a container so you host is not touched. You can delete, clone, backup, and move this container across systems. You can run multiple versions of Wine on the same host, all in their own containers."

linux_gaming,3dm31e,SxxxX,3,Fri Jul 17 12:23:40 2015 UTC,"0 A.D. has always looked like a nice project, though it just isn't the sort of game I really get into much these days. It's been a while since I've been able to get into a classic RTS game. So I doubt I would be able to stay dedicated to working on it for any worthwhile length of time.  Helping out with open source games isn't a bad idea, though I haven't really come across any projects that have really captured my attention yet. I'm still leaning a bit more towards the modding side of things though, at least at first. If I make a crappy mod, it isn't a big deal, no one has to download it or play it to enjoy the base game. The same can't be said if I am working on assets for the base game."

The same can't be said if I am working on assets for the base game.   Seriously man a lot of open source games need any contributions especially when it's come to art. Some of them do have enough high skilled programmers so they may not accept patch if it's badly written, but there is just no artists around, at all.  So many will be happy to to accept assets of any quality especially if they can be improved in future. E.g if you can't do texturing properly somebody else can do that later on.

I'd just rather cut my teeth on some mods before committing to a more serious project.  I'd just like to have more to bring to the table first and I feel that can best be achieved by doing some work on mods first. Part of this is because I can learn a lot more from studying and manipulating the work of more experienced artists than I can working on wholly original works to fill in holes on an unfinished/unrefined game.

Something like:  ldd cp output libs > game dir echo 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./game' > /gamedir/gamelauncher.sh   I know, that's super simple, better would be one that is more intelligent and fixes games that don't work due to missing dependencies by also trying to install them or simply download them from somewhere before copying them to the game's folder.

I assume you have steam installed? Else why install the runtime instead of the libs separately anyway.  There are different ways to go about this. You could for instance choose to append the steam runtime paths to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH prior to executing the game from terminal or from a single line launch script like so:  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH_TO_A_STEAM_RUNTIME_DIR:ANOTHER_RUNTIME_DIR /home/foo/this/is/the/path/to/the/game   or you might as well be interested in using the steam runtime libs as system ones (kind of), you'd just have to append the same dirs to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH var in a startup script. The ""best"" way to do this is in most distros is just edit the .bash_profile file, though I think ubuntu (for instance) in /etd/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.conf.d/make_a_file depending on your preferences.  There might be other ways though, would you like this to be a one fit all solution or customize it depending on the game? The second solution might be a bit more troublesome if you use a rolling release (blending old steam runtime libs with bleeding edge ones isn't always the brightest of ideas)."

linux_gaming,3diiet,ZandalarZandali,-5,Thu Jul 16 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"Please fix what you have.  Priorities, priorities, priorities.  EDIT: If you down vote, at least, say why.  I have used KDE for a long long time.  I've lived through the KDE 4 release.  I'm sure you know that even the KDE Devs consider that as a problem.  Plasma 5 is an improvement over KDE 4.  But it does have a lot of problems.  Every day I have issues with it.  Yesterday, on a machine that has onboard video/nvidia graphics I did the Kubuntu 15.04 update and the results were disastrous.  It loads the OS but won't load the video.  It worked fine on 14.04 and 14.10.  All I have now is a black screen with 15.04.    My buddy also had issues with something very similar to the black screen (multiple and different graphics issues).  He also had issues with the sound.    When I first started with Plasma 5 only one machine could be upgraded.  The problems (after Kubuntu 15.04 launched) resulted in all but one machine that had to be backed up, erased, and restarted.  All of the problems at the time centered on the black screen with the mouse cursor.  An elderly friend brought their computer to me because he had done the release upgrade and couldn't get his computer to work with 15.04.  I had to back up his data, wipe it, and reinstall 14.10.  Other times I was able to overcome some problems only to have them crop up again, repeatedly.  That's what caused me to wipe and start over in some cases.    Even today after all the work resolving issues with these boxes, on the one box that was successfully upgraded  it only takes a a simple command ""sudo bash"" to cause it to do something similar.  Executing ""sudo bash"" caused terminal spam, and then it marked a file (ksycoca5) in the .cache folder as owned by root:root.  This isn't ""sudo dolphin"".

Some of these are important to me and to see them move ahead with something (android apps on KDE (that's frankly not part of the KDE experience)) is a bit dismaying.  So, why is it a bad thing for me to say that they should fix what they have and make those a priority?  Why should I be down voted for saying that that is what's important to me?

I agree with the sentiment of some others, in that KDE should not forget some of the more pressing technical issues over fancy features.   as an aside Looking across to subs like /unixporn  there are less and less people actually using it now as their main DE too, which is a shame because it is a great DE when setup right.

linux_gaming,3difxt,Swiftpaw22,3,Fri Jul 17 00:32:05 2015 UTC,The issue was because the new nvidia drivers with the 900 series cards had so many gl extensions that it created a buffer overflow when trying to read them.

linux_gaming,3djfej,Corruptmagician,4,Fri Jul 17 08:29:19 2015 UTC,"Well... not really.  You are supposed to anticipate your captain's decisions, which requires a fair amount of situational awareness. The same works both ways; as a captain you need to know what your crew can and can't do. So no matter which class you play, you're expected to do it as part of a single team. If anything, it can get overwhelming pretty fast.  Also, repetitive? I wouldn't call it that, not any more than any FPS where you ""just walk and shoot"". Then you have the constant split-second timing and team coordination on top of that, and people come up with lots of different strategies, with different skill levels.  As for lagging, it depends on where you connect from (if you're from Europe, some lag is expected on the Oceania servers), and your graphic card; namely, you probably should not set it at the highest possible quality settings, as effects tend to accumulate pretty fast when the game pace rises."

linux_gaming,3dho9i,TouchMyBox,6,Thu Jul 16 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"Technically not, since Wayland doesn't depend on anything. It's just that current Wayland compositors are built to use KMS. You could use any other modesetting API, but the nvidia driver doesn't even really expose one."
linux_gaming,3dho9i,blackout24,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:32 2015 UTC,Wonder how long it'll be until we have DSR and new antialiasing etc available in the nvidia drivers...
linux_gaming,3dho9i,DryEagle,2,Thu Jul 16 11:16:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know where exactly in the graphics pipeline things such as resolution are handled but I believe it's more an xrandr and the way programs query for current display mode (reports about scaling working desktop wide but games still launching at  1080p). If it's not, then it may be a Xorg thing and my opinion NVIDIA and any sane vendor will rather do the work once on Wayland rather than making Xorg even more messy."
linux_gaming,3dho9i,DarkeoX,2,Thu Jul 16 13:51:15 2015 UTC,"DSR isn't regular downsampling. It's downsampling as a post-processing effect. It's far less intrusive and far more compatible with more games which otherwise wouldn't interact well with downsampling, and plus, it doesn't affect things like UI scaling in most cases. It's also far less impactful on performance. You can read up more about it but that's the general gist. So, xrandr (if that's what you use, I don't, I just use the nvidia driver for that) shouldn't have any bearing on it.  This especially applies to new types of antialiasing etc. It's technologies which exist in the driver but just aren't exposed to the user to make use of... which is very annoying when you've just spent a bunch of money on a high end graphics card..."
linux_gaming,3dho9i,DryEagle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"I don't, I just use the nvidia driver for that   Thanks for explaining. I didn't know you could use the NVIDIA driver for arbitrarily setting new resolutions on Linux. As far as I could tell, the display modes of the newer versions of the driver are basically an interface to xrandr and any display mode you don't find in xrandr, you won't be able to set it up in the control panel.  But indeed, if it's only a matter of post-processing, then things like xrandr shouldn't be too concerned. Though DSR itself isn't enough. For it to be really worth it, we need things like SMAA or TXAA or more advanced FXAA implementation than NVIDIA's."
linux_gaming,3dho9i,DarkeoX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"(I'm on Arch, your mileage may vary) if you look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d you'll find a 20-nvidia.conf - if you don't, you move the xorg.conf from the previous folder there and rename it. nvidia-xconfig will create defaults, and then you can tweak them as needed. for example my 20-nvidia.conf looks like http://fpaste.org/245402/71446361/ (the force composition pipeline stops tearing on certain cards including my 970) and you can find further info at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Configuring"
linux_gaming,3dho9i,DryEagle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but that's not really different from creating modes with xrandr is it? The way you said it, I thought you could create and select custom resolutions with the GUI alone, just like on Windows."

On another note, xrandr is the native tool for this, it's supposed to work on the top of the drivers, so as to provide an unified way across different hardware and drivers to query and switch between available display modes. Kind of the way you don't need to know if you run NVIDIA, ATI or INTEL on Windows: you just right click the desktop and you can go to a nice screen that helps you set your display mode in a quite reliable way.   Since I assumed you couldn't set new display modes (resolutions & stuff) using nvidia-settings GUI, using xrandr appears simpler than mess with Xorg conf files syntax."
linux_gaming,3dho9i,DarkeoX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"As you say, xrandr is good if you're the kind of person who doesn't know if they have nvidia or ati hardware. Personally I do, so I don't see the point of adding another software layer on top of the drivers, when the drivers already handle this perfectly.  http://i.imgur.com/4h0hG2D.jpg is nvidia-settings gui. As you can see there are boxes where you can type any kind of custom resolution, and then write it to the X config file I mentioned prior. Click advanced at the bottom of this tab if you don't see those settings."

Anyway there are some examples like:    Datastar Progenitor (io/wisp cosmetic demo with new particles from workshop, terrain either doesn't exist or doesn't show up, source2 particles seem to be buggy on opengl still at least for this one and wisp is full of particles) Warlock Brawl (hosted a match where nobody could see the terrain, only lava everywhere :S) Stick Arena (quits lobby on map load) Tusk Arena (not sure, think same applies ^ ) Rubick Wards OR Grang Magus (same ^ )   Biggest problem so far has been potato pc users hosting games accidentally.

Remember Tux Games polling us to ask of we wanted Wine-wrapped games, and us voting ""no"" by like 80%?  This place was how I learned about BioWare's claim to start working on a native port of Neverwinter Nights, and it was how I stayed informed about it's progress (or lack thereof...) until BioWare engaged with us in the forums (including Feargus Urquhart, today's founder/president of Obsidian Entertainment). It remains one of my favorites, despite the many glitches in the port and expansions.  Remember Lantinga releasing SDL, and watching it grow and blossom?

Kicker is that you used to be able to login to steam accounts through the standalone, but they changed it at some point and that was no longer possible.

linux_gaming,3dg5ox,acegiak,7,Thu Jul 16 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"Congrats! What engine or tech did you use? How does the gamepad support work - it says partial support, so do I need to use a mouse/keyboard beyond an initial gamepad setup, or no? Is there any demo planned?"
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,adolson,7,Thu Jul 16 01:45:05 2015 UTC,We're using LibGDX and Box2d for physics. As far as gamepad support once you've got the button mappings set up you only need the escape button on your keyboard to pause it because my controller handling code has no way of knowing which is the pause button on any given gamepad.
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,TiZ_EX1,6,Thu Jul 16 03:21:27 2015 UTC,You're not using the SDL2 GameController system and its bindings? Because that system always defines a Start button.
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,adolson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:07:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. Wouldn't pause just be the same as the other button mappings? Typically it'd be Start or Select/Back, but maybe someone wants it somewhere else."
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,phre4k,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:10:06 2015 UTC,"The current system theoretically works with any controller but the flip-side is that I don't have specific mappings for specific layouts.  If you DO start mapping out the layouts of specific controllers like the xbox controller you can start saying ""oh hey I know that on this controller the start button is button 39 so when I get button 39 I know to pause""   The reason I haven't gone down that route is because I have 3 other games in my Steam library that have ""full xbox controller on linux support"" but the mappings aren't right and can't be remapped so I'd rather it be universally configurable and just have the exception be the escape key."
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,Ralkkai,3,Thu Jul 16 09:10:53 2015 UTC,"so, if remap is possible, it should just work to map the controller button to pause. I don't get the initial problem :D"
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,adolson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:55:12 2015 UTC,"Is there any way you could go the Antimicro route and just keybind the pause button to ESC?  I do this personally for games like Binding of Isaac that never got the restart key bound on controller because they ""ran out of buttons."" So now I just restart with the Xbox button."
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,Swiftpaw22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:17:20 2015 UTC,"I fully understand what you're saying about the gamepad layouts being different - my SUTjoystick project is intended to solve this problem, one gamepad at a time, for Godot Engine programmers. I have not used libgdx and haven't touched Java in many years. I am not really understanding what the problem is... Can't you leave the Escape key hard-coded as pause, but also allow it to be mapped to an additional key or button on a gamepad? So gamepad users could map it to whatever their Start button happens to be, but Escape on a keyboard still works as a fallback."
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,adolson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:20:08 2015 UTC,How does SUT compare to libinput and SDL2's method?  I know I'm comparing apples to oranges a bit but the point is it'd be great to see some very solid Linux standard evolve to put an end to any issues that exist for input devices on Linux.  I thought that standard was going to be libinput but I read too much Phoronix.
linux_gaming,3dg5ox,Swiftpaw22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"Short answer: It's a GDScript module for Godot Engine. It's not useful for anything else...  Longer answer: Godot doesn't use SDL2, and currently has no support for built-in mappings on any OS. You get the raw numbered buttons and axes just like you'd get in a program like jstest-gtk, and it's up to the programmer to handle all the non-standard things, like triggers as axes vs buttons, which axes are which, inversion, d-pad as axes vs buttons, and so forth... My module frees up the programmer to code for meaningful input labels (""action_x"" vs button #3 or #4 or #8 or whatever happens to be for the given gamepad...). Basically the same thing as what SDL2 does with the GameController API, and what InControl does for the Unity3D engine, which also doesn't (or didn't? Not sure about v5) use SDL2 (used by games such as FRONTIERS, Gravity Ghost, Hand of Fate, etc). There are plans and some initial work to support SDL2-style database syntax, and possibly read the environment variables set by things like Steam Big Picture, which will render my module less useful (I'll still maintain it for features I want in my games that aren't built-in to the Engine itself), but currently it's only available as a pull request for testing on Windows. Someone needs to convert Godot's Linux joystick handling from the old Joystick API to the eventdev API (what SDL2 uses) before we can use SDL2's mappings. Joystick API is different, lacks things like hats and whatnot... But anyhow, none of this matters to you really unless you're a game developer using Godot."

I get some of them building on Windows first(even as much as it annoys me). Instead of stretching themselves too thinly, they build it for one, get it in a working state, then simply port to the other platforms while still in alpha/beta. Which is exactly what Ark is doing(has done?), and now they just need to worry about performance improvements between the platforms instead of trying to find which bug where is causing the game to utterly shit itself on one platform vs another."

linux_gaming,3debvl,RadicalizedAtheist,7,Wed Jul 15 17:04:01 2015 UTC,In case you follow my advice I'll suggest you a way to reduce the amount of dependencies needed to install Kwin.I suggest you add the variable --no-install-recommends  For example: sudo apt-get install kde-window-manager --no-install-recommends   After  that you need to start Kwin in order to do that type: kwin --replace  After that you should see the KDE window decoration.To change it right click on the bar of your window and click More Actions>Window Manager Settings and go to the Window Decorations tab.In it you install anything you want from Get New Decorations.I personally recommend the Ember window decoration as it integrates kwin better into XFCE.After that you need to change your fonts as it's now handled by system settings of kde.To install that type:sudo apt-get install systemsettings .After it is installled just type systemsettings in the terminal and you can now change the fonts back to Droid Sans. In case you do follow my advice then enjoy your glorious Kwin cube as you earned it.

I am hoping they eventually push LXQt as one of their officially supported DE options as I really like what I've seen of that so far while trying it out, but it is a bit more involved to get it setup than the other options available.

Theses 3 also have large community and thus a somewhat solid and up to date documentation.  If you are willing to have a less stable/bit more complex system debian could be your pick (sid or testing, stable gets outdated too quickly for gaming I would think).

May seem scary at first until you see the wiki, which holds your hand through 99% of it.

linux_gaming,3db2p3,Nathan173AB,3,Wed Jul 15 05:13:46 2015 UTC,You are totally correct. But this gives hope that you can replace Catalyst drivers one day by better performing Open Source drivers once the time comes.
linux_gaming,3db2p3,YanderMan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:15:03 2015 UTC,I really wish they'd start work on crossfire support for radeonsi.  I got a second 290X recently and haven't booted Linux for gaming since.  Windows CF performance is pretty good but catalyst on Linux is the only way to use it and sucks.  If radeonsi had CF support that would be amazing.  If AMD wants gamers to use the open source drivers they will absolutely need CF support.

TBH, the thought of taking someone elses code, disentangling the strands of .net everywhere through it then refactoring to work with non windows gui... urg. that's the stuff of nightmares. Even with the .net linux compat being released, it'd be a nasty job. maybe the dev could be convinced to release on more than windows?"

It does not look like anything essential, so I just removed anything in this method.  Then you need to fix the paths in DlgProfile.cs, Settings.cs and Properties/Resources.resx.  After that the generated file Properties/Resources.Designer.cs was not generated in the same way as the original file and I needed to change ""Depressurizer"" to ""Depressurizer.Properties"".  After that it looks like it works.  The program look in the register for Steam location and that will fail so you'll need to enter the path manually (a rewrite of DlgSteamPath:GetSteamPath would fix that).

linux_gaming,3dcxfc,saturnoyo,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"Currently, I'd say this has more downsides than upsides (Bumblebee is not quite as fast as using the card natively; using the primusrun command can get tiresome; configuration issues, especially vsync/tearing; PRIME already switching between either but not both...)  There could be an advantage when Vulkan becomes a thing, since now you have two graphics units that game could be using. But other than that, I'd say it's simpler to just use a single dedicated GPU."
linux_gaming,3dcxfc,n30p1r4t3,2,Wed Jul 15 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"If you are building a laptop, I would use the IGP for normal use and the discrete card only for gaming. The laptop will overheat less, it won't be as noisy and it will consume less power. That's what I do and it works great.  If you are building a tower I wouldn't think about the IGP at all. You can have enough fans to keep it cool so the graphic card won't be noisy, the power is not a problem and the noise of the fans won't be as close to you so you won't hear it that much.  Have fun."

linux_gaming,3dcxfc,farsaver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:52:59 2015 UTC,"For a laptop, I would choose the Optimus over only a discrete Nvidia any day. The discrete card uses up the battery at about three times the speed, and the IGP is good enough for most desktop environments, even with all the bells and whistles. In fact, it's even good for some 3D games, specifically the free and open ones like xonotic that have options to 'scale down' graphics.  For a desktop... I don't have enough data to make a judgement, but you might still see some of reduction in your power bill if you keep the nvidia card off when not using it."
linux_gaming,3dcxfc,Robsteady,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:51:56 2015 UTC,"I'm using optimus on my laptop since the day I bought it and can recommend it to every laptop user. Integrated graphics are well enough for your video playback and desktop needs. Core temperature is significantly lower about 10C-15C when not playing games.

linux_gaming,3dcxfc,Robsteady,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:18:53 2015 UTC,"I thought Optimus support was laptop only. How would you switch from the intel GPU to Nvidia without physically changing where the display was plugged in to? On a desktop, just run the nvidia card full time, there's absolutely no reason not to.  Desktop computers have had integrated graphics and support for PCI/AGP/PCIe graphics cards for quite a while. There's just not really a reason to switch which one is being used on a desktop like there is for a laptop. If you're that concerned about the power usage difference than you probably shouldn't be running a desktop at all."

linux_gaming,3dao4i,filwit,7,Wed Jul 15 05:27:29 2015 UTC,"So I have an original Steam Prototype controller, and have played around with it quite a bit (mostly in Counter Strike and some platformers like Meatboy). IMO, it's gold. A definite improvement over gamepads, though not as good as M/K for twitch shooters like CS:GO (granted games like COD would much better with Aim-Down-Sight and Aim-Assist).. but in general games I've tried don't really take advantage of it right now (which makes sense cause they don't directly target it yet).  For instance, one major problem with playing CS:GO with both thumbpads is that they feel the same to your fingers but function in fundamentally different ways. On the right pad you ""swipe"" (press-n-drag) to aim (eg, just pressing any part of the pad will not invoke any movement until your finger ""swipes"" in a given direction) whereas the left pad you press any part (except the exact center) and you instantly begin moving in that direction.  That may sound easy enough to learn, but it's not. In intense situations your brain breaks down and wants to treat both pads the same.. eg, often I'll want to ""dogde left"" but because ""aiming left"" means touching the right side of the aiming(right)-pad then swiping left (you touch the right side first, instinctively, to give your finger space to swipe) my brain automatically attempts to perform the same gesture with the movement(left)-pad.. the problem is that as soon as your finger touches the right side of that pad (again, instinctively, to give your finger space to swipe left) your character instantly begins to move right instead of left.. which is the exact opposite motion you intended.  This is obviously why they added the joystick, but IMO the pads are much better, even for movement. My [theoretical] solution to this problem would be to make the left pad work almost identical to the right.. eg, just touching the left pad would not invoke any movement until you swipe in a given direction.. the only difference would be it ""holds"" that movement (so you don't have to constantly swipe to walk, etc). Of course, that doesn't map to the keyboard, which is why I think no one has tried it yet.  The main benefit of using a pad over a joystick for movement is that it's so much more sensitive and you can perform swiping gestures quickly unlike joysticks. For instance, double tapping a joystick is a pain, but quickly swiping a pad twice is very quick and natural.. which means using a pad to, say, ""dodge/roll right"" (via double swipe) would be very easy on a pad, and wouldn't require any extra buttons to be held (unlike a joystick)... now add on the fact that you can input ""L shaped"" gestures and you have a much more efficient way to convey advanced game movements. Personally I think this is a big win for many games, including genres like fighting games (something I think Steam Controller will excel at eventually, even though that's one of people's biggest concerns).  I understand why they added a Joystick and even agree with that decision (it's very familiar to people so the learning curve for both gamers and developers is small).. but I think over time the pads will replace it once game devs start to explore the possibilities more."

If gog, you need download special language version from your game lib. You found it after change language version in game lib and next you can download it.  On steam I have default polish voice (because I use steam in polish language) so Steam opt default this language in game. If you have manuall opt polish, go to witcher launcher and change in options voice from en to pl. Also here you can change text.  If you have version from non europe, you problabe don't have polish language in steam version.

linux_gaming,3d9djh,BurningFox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:27 2015 UTC,Following something similar.  The part where that guide shows to echo the ID to the pci_stub I would be echoing 10de 1080 which is the same for both cards.

You need to use their workstation cards to make it work.  I do remember reading there are ways around it with firmware.  Thats why AMD cards are used as they dont block this feature.

Morrowind was exciting for its time, but the scaling was crazy (by which I mean that I could be wandering along a path into a new area and suddenly a mental-hard dwemor-dude would run up with a two-handed-sword and one-shot me instantly) and put me off playing more than about 10 or 15 hours.

linux_gaming,3d7hrr,uoou,3,Tue Jul 14 18:08:26 2015 UTC,"Well there was no scaling in Morrowind. Stuff was statically levelled. And it was great. But also meant that you could become crazy overpowered which is either a good or bad thing depending on what you like.  This post from years ago sums up really well why Morrowind is better. Which is why I saved it.  I'd add to that: Morrowind just has more stuff. There are 15 joinable factions in Morrowind, each with extensive quest lines. There are powerful and flexible spells, any of which you can enchant onto any piece of clothing/weaponry. Want a robe that does permanent life-steal on everyone in 10 metres? No problem (I did this once, didn't realise what a terrible idea it was until I went to town). Want a hat that gives you 150m of telekinesis? Fine (again, turned out to be a stupid idea. I was accidentally opening doors in the next town).   Morrowind is a hostile, culturally diverse and consistent world in which you struggle to make your way. Relationships with NPCs feel far fuller and more meaningful as you struggle to prove your worth. But as you get stronger it becomes a playground. A place for experimenting with complex emergent systems, plugging things together to find the coolest or most ridiculous way to kill things or charm people or steal everything not nailed down.  (Of course, I'm intentionally being a bit of a dick by stating it as starkly as X is better than Y. Some people prefer Skyrim or Oblivion for perfectly valid reasons)"

linux_gaming,3dacks,flaming_m0e,7,Tue Jul 14 20:15:42 2015 UTC,Only very few people have two graphics cards so I dont think it matter that much also with the new Vulkan API I think you don't need sli or crossfire anymore cause it already supports multiple graphics cards.
linux_gaming,3dacks,Tanren,3,Tue Jul 14 19:21:33 2015 UTC,"I assume that this is what you're referring to. At this point it's just a rumor to get folks excited to migrate to Windows 10. Although, if PC Gamer's predictions are correct and AMD and Nvidia attempt to block mixed GPU setups, then there'll probably be some hacky way to circumvent it in Vulkan considering its open nature."
linux_gaming,3dacks,PyGuy,4,Tue Jul 14 22:18:00 2015 UTC,"It is basically the responsibility of the GPU makers. Nvidia and AMD. I seriously doubt they will ever come though. SLI and Crossfire are, in a basic sense, game specific drivers that are very labor intensive to produce. Nvidia and AMD will analyze a game, and figure out what sorts of API calls they can split up between the cards. This is why you need profiles and have to wait for driver updates for new games before they have a performance increase. The only platform that has a large enough userbase to justify that expense is Windows.  That all said, the need for it should be going away with the new APIs: Mantle, DX12 and Vulkan. With the new APIs, it becomes the game developer/engine developers responsibility to split the game between GPUs in the same manner as OpenCL/CUDA."
linux_gaming,3dacks,PinkyThePig,2,Tue Jul 14 20:54:50 2015 UTC,SLI more often than not doesn't really work on Windows either. On Linux even less games have SLI profiles. I hope Vulkan sorts this mess out where Multi GPU handling and resource management is all up to the application developers.

The closed source drivers are only marginally better, I have no problem playing TF2 with the open source drivers. So considering how much better the open source drivers are for everything else other than gaming, I choose the OSS"
linux_gaming,3d49al,foobar5678,7,Tue Jul 14 10:35:12 2015 UTC,"Here are a few thoughts on the subject from my viewpoint:   Using OpenGL 4 instead of 3 will not necessarily gain performance. OpenGL 4 would be so much faster is a great meme but not always true, as with all things it depends on the game and what it's doing. The open source drivers on Linux don't really support OpenGL 4.x yet. Intel drivers are open source only but are quite popular so targeting OpenGL 4.x only would remove these cards from the supported list.  It can make more sense to use OpenGL 3.x at times. It means you can support all the open source driver users (as some people don't like proprietary drivers) including Intel cards. Increasing your potential audience base could make a difference to your sales figures. Also offering wider support isn't a bad thing if possible without effecting the rest of the game experience. Contrary to some often repeated comments Apple do have OpenGL 4.1 support on all vendors including Intel, this is one area where Apple have better parity than Linux. OpenGL 4.1 support on OS X has been about for a while now. I am not saying the drivers are bug free etc ;) but the features are officially supported. They don't however have OpenGL 4.2 or later on any vendor. There are some major features in OpenGL 4.3 or later, compute shader support being a key feature for modern titles. As more games that require these kind of features are brought to Linux then I expect more and more OpenGL 4.x titles being released."
linux_gaming,3d49al,edddeduck_feral,2,Tue Jul 14 07:47:44 2015 UTC,"Couldn't you just use the OpenGL Compatiblity Profile to target all OpenGL versions so when a driver says that things are available you use them, and if they aren't, then you don't.  This is what the Dolphin emulator does. They support all drivers and the emulator works on all drivers, but if OpenGL 4 features are available they will be used, other wise not.  Wouldn't it be better to use a compatiblity profile anyways? https://developer.nvidia.com/opengl-driver   NVIDIA recommends that developers always create a Compatibility profile context, to ensure full backwards compatibility of existing OpenGL code."
linux_gaming,3d49al,edddeduck_feral,3,Tue Jul 14 08:04:43 2015 UTC,"That sounds great in theory, in practise it usually means more work as you need to get the game to work fully on OpenGL 3 and again with OpenGL 4. Also you have to optimise the different paths to get the best experience so it's not as simple as turning on a switch for compatibility.  However if the game only uses OpenGL 4 for advanced effects it's totally possible, in fact we have done this before for a number of games on OS X where you can only access the higher end graphics if you have OpenGL 4 support.   It does however increase the amount of work and time on a project. More importantly in some cases it's just not possible as the core engine requires OpenGL 4 in these cases you just have to drop OpenGL 3.x and go for 4.x as the min spec."

linux_gaming,3d49al,t_hunger,7,Mon Jul 13 13:44:17 2015 UTC,I've asked already for opengl4 support on a steam chat and one of the developers (TheRightHand) said to me that they will add it later. He couldn't give me a time frame though.

linux_gaming,3d40nh,CAT_TONGUE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:05:59 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking you'll need at least gcc, make and binutils. If you're on Debian/Ubuntu or a derivative, the basic tools for compiling software are bundled in a package called build-essential. In the case of BlastEm, you will also need to install the libraries it depends on, namely SDL2 and GLEW. Under Debian/Ubuntu the packages are called libsdl2-dev and libglew-dev respectively. To get a copy of the latest source, you might want to install Mercurial (a version control system) To install all four of those packages, run the following command as root:  apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libglew-dev mercurial   You'll also need OpenGL dev packages, but I believe GLEW has those as a dependency so you shouldn't need to install those explicitly. Once you have those installed you can build BlastEm with the following commands.  hg clone http://rhope.retrodev.com/repos/blastem cd blastem make blastem   In place of the last command, you can just type 'make' without a target which will build some other small utilities, but I'm not always good about making sure those other utilities will build at any given time so 'make blastem' is more reliable."

linux_gaming,3d40nh,mikevaughn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:32:50 2015 UTC,"It's 2015. No, it's not difficult to compile from source most of the time, but the times that it ends up being a pain in the ass (unlisted dependencies, etc.), and how easy it is to get proper packages built via PPAs/OBS, mean it's something end-users shouldn't have to bother with."
linux_gaming,3d40nh,YanderMan,0,Mon Jul 13 11:44:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's not bothering at all. You can get the latest software this way by compiling stuff directly from the latest git sources-  i would even say its something that makes Linux way superior - package management is all good and well but being able to compile stuff is still the basis for Linux as a whole OS: you can reproduce the build by yourself, and this has NOTHING to do with the year being 2015. But maybe you come from a different background and you dont mind binaries."
linux_gaming,3d40nh,WienerWuerstel,4,Mon Jul 13 11:57:40 2015 UTC,"the times that it ends up being a pain in the ass (unlisted dependencies, etc.), and how easy it is to get proper packages built via PPAs/OBS   You didn't address those gripes.  And yes, it being 2015 is very relevant. When I first started using Linux (nearly 10 years ago), compiling from source was required fairly often if I wanted the latest version of a given program. The frequency of that being the case has steadily decreased over the past decade, thanks to the aforementioned automated build systems which target the most popular distros. These days, if I can't get the latest version of your program in a binary package, it's because you were too lazy to spend an hour or two figuring out how to use PPAs/OBS. And if you didn't even have the decency to list all the dependencies I need to install prior to attempting to build from source, well, I'll just find another program developed by someone who realizes 99.999% of end-users don't have the time/patience to spend half an hour on something that should take less than a minute (installing a piece of software)."
linux_gaming,3d40nh,PopeSeanV,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:19:44 2015 UTC,"those are not grippes, this is how linux works and how it is built in the first place. Using packages is nice, but compiling software gives you a whole different level of understanding on how stuff actually works and how everything is intertwined with each other.  I agree with you that people who don't list dependencies are annoying, but you should be able to find where the issue lies when compiling the software anyway by looking at the errors it throws, most of the time.   On top of that, compiling from source offers many advantages:   you get the latest features you get better performance (you can build with more recent and better performing versions of GCC while most packages are still built with 4.6 or something and probably not with the best compilation flags either) you can access stuff that is not even available on repos (either very new software or very old one as well)   And most of the time compiling from source is very efficient on modern processors. Except for Firefox or libreoffice which are very time consuming - but then again you don't build them every single day."

Some black flickering in the blurred background. When playing as guest, winning one tutorial, logging out, making account and logging as regular user I see that I have 1 winning game record (probably from the guest account), not sure if intentional or not.

linux_gaming,3d0eta,cod3r__,4,Sun Jul 12 13:15:25 2015 UTC,"I'm still waiting for proper graphics acceleration in KVM (I mean Linux kernel virtual machines). That Spice driver seems to be moving with a snail pace.  VirtualBox unfortunately still has closed blobs for USB support, but graphics acceleration is a killer feature which stops me from switching to KVM so far.  Anyway, I mostly use VirtualBox for work, not for gaming (usually running Linux guest on another Linux host)."
linux_gaming,3d0eta,shmerl,4,Sun Jul 12 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"If you have a spare GPU, you can set up PCI passthrough so that the guest OS can use the second card directly. There's very little slowdown and it works great for gaming."

Development on QEMU/KVM is much more lively than VirtualBox anyway, and it supports USB without blobs.   Yep, USB support is a major plus.

Optimizing the setup (mainly cpu and scheduling related issues) so it won't stutter has been much harder and is still a work in progress.  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162768 and http://vfio.blogspot.com are good resources."

linux_gaming,3d0eta,impulse_255,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:35:10 2015 UTC,It's doesn't matter for gaming because VirtualBox support for Direct3D is very limited and and compatible with a lot less games than Wine. And if you have 2nd GPU you can already setup VM with it using QEMU.
linux_gaming,3d0eta,SxxxX,2,Sun Jul 12 14:26:56 2015 UTC,I thought that exact lack of support for Direct3D is why they've introduced this KVM model?
linux_gaming,3d0eta,scaine,2,Sun Jul 12 15:47:41 2015 UTC,Not at all. KVM usage just give better performance for IO and CPU.  It's doesn't help with graphics performance at all.
linux_gaming,3d0eta,SxxxX,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're correct, that instead of ""emulating"" it, it directly utilizes your GPU.  In other words the distance between the, say, guest Windows Direct3D code, and your host's graphics driver becomes very thin."
linux_gaming,3d0eta,Swiftpaw22,2,Sun Jul 12 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're correct, that instead of ""emulating"" it, it directly utilizes your GPU.   It's always directly used GPU on host anyway, but in VM virtual device is used no matter if you're running it with KVM or not.  On host is only OpenGL available to basically in VM there is used low-level D3D implementation istead of appropriate AMD/Nvidia/Intel Windows driver.  KVM doesn't change anything there because GPU currently can only be used by one driver. Intel does have special project called XenGT / KVMGT (GTV-g marketing name) that allow use same iGPU on both host and guest, but of course that only for Intel and require changes in Windows drivers."
linux_gaming,3d0eta,SxxxX,2,Mon Jul 13 00:18:05 2015 UTC,Do you need a second monitor for a VM in QEMU for the 2nd GPU?  That's probably a stupid question :-) but I figure it's worth asking.
linux_gaming,3d0eta,DarthFrog,3,Sun Jul 12 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"No, so long as your monitor has multiple inputs you can use those and switch between them."

linux_gaming,3d0eta,DarthFrog,2,Mon Jul 13 04:51:53 2015 UTC,Though keep in mind that in order to streaming work nicely for all games you need both hardware encode on guest and hardware decode on host (any Intel iGPU can do decode/encode). Otherwise latency will be 25ms+ which going to make FPS games unplayable.

It sucks, we dont get bezel comp, eyefinity, nvsurround, sweetfx, DSR, overclocking tools etc...   its all possible but there are hoops and pitfalls. Hopefully the feature sets will become more equal as time progresses.  That said. ..  A lot of Linux games run borderless fullscreen or support windowed mode so there is a good chance you can stretch the game across the screens. Many games actually auto aspect-ratio compensate. KDE even provides a way to make any game that is full screen only run in windowed at custom windowed resolutions.  (which reminds me, windows users have Wide Screen gaming fixer for awkward non multimonitor aware games  that adjusts or fixes aspect ratios better)   its just trial and error im afraid."

I think xorg.conf allows for offsetting some monitor pixels or something, but can't recall the specifics (might be useful for bezel comp).  But basically, I just need a way for XOrg to combine the screens and report the wide resolution. Software at that point should then just be able to use it (whether or not it would work correctly though is another story)."

linux_gaming,3cy8sd,xpressrazor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"If you like Turn Based SRPG's (like Disgaea op mentioned), Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions is a classic and afaik the psp version is the best version.   I haven't tried emulating a psp yet, but supposedly there is a patch for FFT:WotL that fixes the slowdown. Which I suppose that would  make emulation on PC the 'best version'.   If you like old school Castlevania games, Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles is pretty good. You can unlock Castlevania: Symphony of the Night from within it and that is an excellent game as well.  I really enjoyed God of War: Chains of Olympus and it's sequel.  There's also some good Metal Gear games for the PSP."

Racing games usually require more GPU, there fore they might not work for all. Fighting games like tekken run really well. PSP games are smaller in size compared to their desktop counterpart. These games are usually quite different(lacking some features) than the desktop versions. However, they are still a great way to play games, that may not have a Linux port."

Tried a different monitor?  In any case if you're not going for an nvidia and you can possibly wait some before you make your new purchase (you have an older gpu to use or the issue is not getting you crazy about it) and get one of those new amd cards (amdgpu), they're currently no better than the old ones, though they're pretty much the only ones with room for improvement and sadly catalyst being perfect is far from the reason why it will never get much better...  If you end up purchasing a recent amd gpu (not supporting the amdgpu driver) you're going to be stuck with catalyst since mesa takes time to catch up when it comes to ""latest"" hardware releases (though it totally makes up for it when you have a gpu that's starting to get little bit dusty).  With all that being said I'd sum up saying you'd be better off getting a gtx960/970 or a new amd supporting amdgpu (for the fans of anticipation). If you opengl performance is important for you (you want to consider yourself a heavy player) then pick up an nvidia, yet if you love mesa and don't mind waiting for performance then the latter choice might be worth it for you.  Hope you end up making the right choice whatever that might be."

I didn't notice Linux users being burnt more than others. Rate of failures in general didn't really change from the past. Some projects did fail, but from what I can see - most are successful.   I hope everyone doesn't fund this project because of a promise of Linux   Those who don't back shouldn't expect anything, because without backers such projects aren't made to begin with. It's a pipe dream to say ""I won't back it but will buy it when it will come out"". In this particular case at least it's already funded, but in any other case what I said above applies.  Also, your attitude will discourage crowdfunded projects from including Linux support. I.e. if you don't back, then blame yourself for lack of Linux support, because you demonstrated to developers that you aren't interested, so why should they bother making the Linux version?"
linux_gaming,3czdo5,d10sfan,5,Sun Jul 12 07:33:23 2015 UTC,"There's been some projects that have been released with no Linux version in sight, or very very delayed. Or the version is subpar, rushed out to fulfill their obligations and nothing more. Should we be encouraging developers to do that?  I would instead hope, per your last statement, that Linux support was already planned and well thought out before the kickstarter was even started, along with a demo, which could help increase the chances of backing.   Devs should realize that not all the potential customers are going to back as early as kickstarter, and shouldn't affect their interest or not in Linux.   We can choose not to back a game and still follow its progress (or lack thereof if that's the case) and expect a product in the future, especially if it's already been funded."
linux_gaming,3czdo5,d10sfan,0,Sun Jul 12 08:05:35 2015 UTC,"Devs should realize that not all the potential customers are going to back as early as kickstarter, and shouldn't affect their interest or not in Linux.

linux_gaming,3czdo5,d10sfan,2,Sun Jul 12 08:10:14 2015 UTC,"They should also take into account that not everyone interested in the game is going to back it anyways, regardless of platform.

They can of course expect sales, but their primary concern should be for backers who enable the project. And I think it's fair. If you don't back it, don't complain later that it's not going to come out on your platform.  Early access is a pretty weird practice to begin with. Normal games shouldn't engage in such stuff. People should be paid for testing games, not the other way around. Or at the very least testing should be done for free - it benefits developers. I.e. if they want, they can run a limited beta testing program for some selected amount of beta testers. But making a profit from it is simply wrong."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,YanderMan,22,Sat Jul 11 13:01:16 2015 UTC,"MR: Interestingly, I generally find the same opinions amongst other devs. Ie. It’s not really commercially viable, but we like to do it for more personal reasons.   This confirms my suspicion that we shouldn't focus on the profit incentive when asking for Linux port (the ""No Tux no Bucks"" argument). Instead it's more effective to appeal to the underdog and open source aspects.  Not only because it's more effective, but because it's closer to truth and doesn't raise unreasonable expectations. If developer ports their game to Linux in hope of making big profit, but fall far from the target, they won't be supporting Linux with their next game."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,santsi,9,Sat Jul 11 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"""No Tux, No Bucks"" is not meant as a way to say ""port to Linux, you'll get so rich!"", but instead a way to say, ""I want to play your game, but I won't buy it until it's on Linux.""  I don't think anyone actually believes there's a big pot of gold at the end of the Linux rainbow. And if they do, and they're disappointed when they find out the truth, it's not because someone said ""No Tux, No Bucks"" to them, but instead because they didn't do any kind of market research whatsoever. Even searching on GoL for sales stats, or asking fellow devs, or maybe even Valve, about the situation.  For some devs, Linux does pay off, when we make up more than our fair share of sales compared to our market share. Our numbers would be even better if Linux users would stop buying Windows games and actually voted with their wallets."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,adolson,8,Sun Jul 12 01:40:05 2015 UTC,Was a great read. Liked it.
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,Glog78,4,Sat Jul 11 13:14:31 2015 UTC,"Note, in this article they released actual figures (instead of share %) of units sold for their games on all platforms."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,arendjr,9,Sat Jul 11 13:05:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, but note this quote:   You can derive the following: Windows’ share is about 92% of the Steam market, and Mac and Linux are at respectively 5.9% and 1.3%. That’s quite small indeed for a developer that has been Linux friendly for a very long time. Note that they also sell their own games via their own website as well, but it is safe to assume a large majority of their sales are happening via Steam nowadays.   The numbers they released are all time. Now, how long is Steam for Linux available? 2.5 years, right? Compare that to Mac which was released over 5 years ago. And Windows has been released almost 12 years ago. So, I think the 1.3% they mention for Linux is really a lower-bound, and should be adjusted to take the age of the platform into account (though of course it isn't as simple as multiplying Linux by 2 to compare to Mac, because there is probably a bias towards later years already as both this dev's catalogue and the Steam userbase are growing)."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,doliorules,2,Sat Jul 11 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"there is probably a bias towards later years already as both this dev's catalogue and the Steam userbase are growing).   Yes, but at the same time consider this: Their most popular title ever has been Prison Architect, and you should also assume the sales of that game by itself account for about 80% of those sales - and the game was available for Linux for a very long time (I don't remember if there was a gap following the Windows version of not) so that should reduce the time-induced gap you mention in the first place."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,the_s_d,7,Sat Jul 11 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"I own all their games, but I didn't buy any from Steam, including Prison Architect. In fact, I buy pretty much nothing on Steam proper if it can be gotten on Humble Store instead, for instance. Do those purchases still go in the Steam statistics, or do they just disappear?"
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,doliorules,2,Sat Jul 11 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"Do those purchases still go in the Steam statistics, or do they just disappear?   My guess is that bundles games activated through Steam go back to statistics. I'm not 100% sure."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,the_s_d,3,Sat Jul 11 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"They do. Your Steam partner report gives you sales data, in CSV format, on the source of the key activation (Humble, GMG, GamersGate, Groupees, etc) as well as platform of activation, each row a daily summary per geographic region. For example, you could see, for todays date, a row for all Linux activations on Humble (which all count as US, IIRC), or all Windows activations in Portugal, etc.  You might be able to choose the columns for export, I can't remember.  Oh, and, of course, the platform activation lies, based on the ""platform with most minutes played within seven days"" rule.  I think that, contrary to popular sentiment, the platform does shift each 7-day window, but our current advice for supporting the porting engineers is still valid because a platform flip to Linux after their payment window is still too late."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,doliorules,2,Sat Jul 11 16:32:55 2015 UTC,"Oh. So, if I got steam keys of all their games from a humble bundle, but never installed/played any of them except Prison Architect, because I'd already bought and played then on Linux like 10 years ago, how are they counted? Probably Windows?"
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,the_s_d,2,Sat Jul 11 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"I can't tell the date of purchase from the activation date. My guess is that any porting house would have been paid (or not) based on their deal with the reseller, if any, with purchases reverting to Windows. However, the partner report should display the platform of activation, even a decade on from purchase, since it is set within the first week of play. So, I would say that this would have the desired effect for in-house ports years on, in terms of tracking and statistics, because there was no porting contractor to compensate.  Humble is a little different as it appears that they report platform selection directly to Steam (I assume there's an API for resellers which I'm unfamiliar with). However, these reports obviously had no utility before Linux Steam in 2013 (except OS X)."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,mordocai058,2,Sat Jul 11 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"No, I mean I got Steam keys via Humble perhaps a year ago, and redeemed them, but never used Steam to install them. And I was wondering how that shows up in Steam's statistics. Does my purchasing them from Humble on Linux carry over to them counting as a Linux purchase on Steam? I guess it's probably certain to now, since there's no automatic key redemption anymore, and it probably counts whatever platform you're running the Steam client on when redeeming the key.  The 10 year old figure was buying the games direct from Introversion way back. I have a CD copy of Uplink for Linux somewhere, for instance."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,Jonuz,2,Sat Jul 11 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the year-old Humble keys were likely reported by Humble as the platform set up in the Humble account responsible for the purchase (I know this platform reporting was working at least in early summer / late spring of last year).  I think that the key activation is also reported with the platform, but appears with zero revenue (as the sale already happened), but I'll have to go check my data to be certain.  I'm pretty sure that Humble's platform reporting didn't happen until some point in time, but I don't know when for sure because the project I worked on was released after this was already working."
linux_gaming,3cwqeb,CptCmdrAwesome,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately my purchases probably count as windows even though I now use linux exclusively. I just removed my windows partition recently, and I imagine many are in the same boat. While I doubt it would make an order of magnitude of difference, I wouldn't be surprised if adding the number of people who dual-boot/wish they were using linux and the people who have switched to linux after buying the game would double the linux numbers.   Of course, the first is impossible to measure and the second is only possible if the person plays the game after switching (and I haven't played any of my introversion games since switching)."

Plus, pray tell, how does one make money talk in this situation? I've heard ""use linux to buy the game on steam so they know it was a linux buy,"" but then I've also heard, ""but you have to actually play it on linux to be counted."" Which means one has to dual boot a lot if one still has Windows-only games one wants to play. Which is fine but a hassle.  I'm partly just venting, but there shouldn't be anything wrong with talking to game devs. Screw ""money talks."""

If you buy on Windows then don't play, or buy on Linux, then play on Windows, the money says you're a Windows user.

The fact Reddit has community-based valuation and anti-spam measures like voting, but also still uses very authoritarian measures as well, makes it at first seem more open until you find out about those authoritarian measures.  It all makes me not like this model and want to move to a p2p/darknet/web-o-trust platform but sadly we still don't have options for that which seem good enough."

If they started spamming (either themselves or because they got hacked)? If they trusted a spammer?  In e.g. pgp, the idea is that you actually meet people in real life, and you also only need to testify that they are who they say they are, not that they're good (at picking funny cat videos or linux gaming links etc). That's just not the case with reddit. I don't care who you are, I only care about the stuff you post.  Really, the thing to do here would be to abolish the self-promotion rule and let low-quality content be downvoted and ""blogspam"" (i.e. links that are nothing more than a step to the original content) be reported and removed.

I don't intend to make it more of a hole. I don't have any ads on BoilingSteam in the first place because I hate ads myself. That has to be the worst thing ever on the web, and I run anti-ads measures as much as I can. I have no interest in pushing articles up just by pouring money at it, even if I wanted to. Articles should be upvoted for their quality, not simply appearing at the top for other reasons.

One part I liked is how you have different ways of completing a mission. Also, one character has the ability to see how the power flows between different systems (a bit like in Gunpoint), which makes it possible to, eg, disconnect alarms, etc.  Atmosphere-wise, they really nailed the cyberpunk feel in a way no game has done before (IMHO)."

We have the Fury and Fury X currently in office for testing and, even though we don't focus on Linux, I do run the tests myself. Even going so far as to run the full suite of Phoronix tests.  The Fury X, with FGLRX 15.7,  runs almost on par with a GTX 960 with the 352.21 drivers. That's a $600 MSRP card running on par with a $200 one. So no, not even close."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,GenderNeutralPronoun,5,Sat Jul 11 21:47:47 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be closer than that, that's really sad.  AMD's closed OpenGL stack is still miles behind then.  If this continues the open source driver may end up replacing it (which would be nice anyway!).  That's some good info though, thanks! :D"
linux_gaming,3cy11a,GenderNeutralPronoun,4,Sat Jul 11 22:13:14 2015 UTC,I really do want to see Gallium overtake FGLRX in OpenGL performance. I might even buy an AMD GPU at that point.
linux_gaming,3cy11a,GenderNeutralPronoun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:15:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, the biggest question is how long is it going to take for a well-performing OpenGL stack to materialize for AMD.  That's ultimately what we all care about.  Gallium's architecture has the benefit of re-usability, but how much further does it need to go until it catches up to nVidia for the newest AMD cards.  It's gotta be 1-2 years at least but that's pretty optimistic I think."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,KarKraKr,5,Sat Jul 11 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"Considering AMD's past financial reports, I honestly do think they'll go bankrupt before that ever happens.  NVidia may be a shitty company, with outright anti-consumer practices (eg.: Bump-gate and the 3.5G GTX 970) but their software support puts everyone else to shame. Linux, Windows, drivers and even general functionality. They know what they're doing. AMD, on the hand, doesn't seem to and while I had hoped Dr. Lisa Su would bring some beneficial changes, it hasn't happened yet. If we focus entirely on Linux, then AMD has literally stagnated and that's not good for both them and us. Competition is healthy and nowadays AMD is not even in the race."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,KarKraKr,2,Sat Jul 11 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, the existing system seems really horrid for graphics advancements.  My guess as to what is going on is duopoly control, patents, and general corruption/greed/capitalism.  I really am wanting an open source computer hardware revolution to start up and destroy this existing bloated inefficient wealth-stealing system, but we all know that probably won't happen for 50 years or so barring major revolution. :P"

linux_gaming,3cy11a,bat_country,2,Sun Jul 12 00:41:11 2015 UTC,"Since Vulkan is AMD's baby, I have no doubt Vulkan support will be great.  But will they ever catch up on their OpenGL support and bring it up to par with nVidia's?  At this point I'm betting ""no"".  I think Vulkan will be AMD's savior."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,Mr_s3rius,2,Sun Jul 12 06:45:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. A stellar OpenGL performance just won’t be necessary any more, Mesa will be good enough™ for existing games soon-ish. I’m optimistic. The time of optimized closed blobs is almost over, now OpenGL can be truly open, either via Mesa or on top of Vulkan. (Or both?)"
linux_gaming,3cy11a,bat_country,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the future will be open for all of them.  I think that is especially possible given Vulkan being so much slimmer as a driver.  Less code to write, so why not have it be open?  But we'll see..."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,Mr_s3rius,2,Sun Jul 12 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of games will still run on OpenGL (or, erm, DirectX). Vulkan will not replace OGL."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,KarKraKr,3,Sun Jul 12 11:35:01 2015 UTC,"In a few years OpenGL is going to be a userland C library that makes vulkan calls, not unlike unreal or unity.

linux_gaming,3cy11a,Mr_s3rius,2,Sun Jul 12 20:01:42 2015 UTC,That's a good remark - and it'll probably happen like that.   We'll see what kind of performance these libraries will bring considering that emulating OpenGL's behavior will likely bring along lots of its performance deficiencies but I can see that undertaking being a success.
linux_gaming,3cy11a,KarKraKr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"Also consider if you're running a 2015 game on a 2020 GPU, no one will care if the GL-Vulkan layer is eating some performance, just like we don't care about dosbox.  There will be a couple of years where people will clamor for good native OpenGL drivers, but that era will be shorter than the time it will take to fix opengl's native drivers."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,Mr_s3rius,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"Well, look at the Steam suvey data. People are running 2015 games on 2010 GPUs (or earlier). The average Steam user's hardware is actually very outdated."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,Amanoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"Of course it will. AAA titles are dying to get their hands on dx12 on Windows, where DX11 exists and is widely functional across vendors (as opposed to OpenGL being varying degrees of non-functional on anything that isn’t nvidia). To a point that the technical director at EA said he’d love to require a DX12/Win10 minspec as early as 2016. There’s absolutely no doubt that DX12/Vulkan will replace DX11 on Windows. If AMD delivers a good Vulkan driver, there’s no reason whatsoever for anything graphically demanding to use OpenGL."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,NorthStarZero,3,Sun Jul 12 12:12:52 2015 UTC,"Even the Khronos group themselves state that Vulkan will not replace OpenGL as you can read in their press release (among other places)   Vulkan expands the family of Khronos 3D APIs, and complements OpenGL and OpenGL ES   What EA says is of little importance to the entirety of the games industry. If they are quick to adopt DX12, good (although that is of no consequence to Linux and Vulkan). But do you honestly believe that every dev will jump ship so quickly? Especially devs that do not produce AAA-titles?  But let's assume that every single game after Vulkan's proper release will use that API instead of OpenGL. In that scenario, the vast majority of games will still run on OpenGL for many years to come - just not the new releases.  Having good OpenGL drivers will continue to be of paramount importance to Linux gamers."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,adolson,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:31:13 2015 UTC,"Well of course there will still be areas of application for simple OpenGL. CAD software stuck in 1999 or graphically not very demanding games would come to my mind. (Although a good chunk of those is probably going to use an engine like Unity and hence have Vulkan support anyway, good for mobile ports) If you’re just writing a few hundred lines of code, you probably don’t want to add 500+ for a Vulkan renderer on top of that, so OpenGL it is. It has however little place in the triple A industry where code gets optimized to hell and back.   And no one cares about old games, especially not hardware vendors. But not even consumers due to the fact that processing power constantly increases. Mesa will run anything that’s currently released just fine in 2-3 years, probably earlier.    What EA says is of little importance to the entirety of the games industry.   What EA says shows what the developers of one of the biggest engines there are (Frostbite) think. You can bet that the minds behind the other big engines don’t think too differently."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,NorthStarZero,4,Sun Jul 12 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"And no one cares about old games, especially not hardware vendors. But not even consumers due to the fact that processing power constantly increases. Mesa will run anything that’s currently released just fine in 2-3 years, probably earlier.    First of all, it's not old games. It's all games prior to Vulkan. Let's say Vulkan is ready-to-use tomorrow. What does ARK run on? Or Dying Light? Civ 5, XCom, CS:GO, Cities, Pillars?  And realistically, most games currently in production will likely not switch to Vulkan in the middle of development. At least those in the end stage of production. DirectX 9.0c is over 10 years old and there are still new games coming out for it.  Look at Steam's HW stats. Most people run old hardware. Tons of low-mid end discrete graphics. Processing power may constantly improve but that doesn't say much if most consumers stick with their hardware for years. Not to speak of laptop users who have to keep an eye on energy consumption. This won't drastically change within the next few years.  And even if you do buy new hardware: enthusiasts already enjoy running games at >1080p and either downscale it (as a form of AA) or show it on their 1440p/4k displays which become more affordable every year.  But even ignoring this: if it takes 2-3 years until Mesa/AMDGPU will be fine that's still 2-3 more years of sub-par gaming experience on AMD systems.  If OpenGL implementations don't actually become efficient they'll keep lagging behind.   What EA says   Companies say a lot of things when the day is long. They can't even keep their release dates. We'll have to see what actually happens.  The tech director you've been quoting said his ambitions are ""likely a bit aggressive"". And to make this clear: this comes from a twitter post. This isn't EA's official mission statement.  The article continues to state that ""it’s unlikely EA will take his advice at this earlier hour"" - but that's the author's opinon.   one of the biggest engines   Well, that doesn't exactly translate into a lot of games though."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,NorthStarZero,2,Sun Jul 12 13:33:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have one of the latest AMD cards and am aware that that AMD has made a few promises, but AMD is known for bad drivers, especially when it comes to OpenGL. It's not an exception if a high end AMD has a performance similar to a mid range Nvidia.   Basically, as of yet, Nvidia's proprietary drivers are far better than AMD's. However, the open source Nvidia drivers are worse than both the proprietary and open source AMD drivers.   It would surprise me if this status quo changed much with the new AMD cards."
linux_gaming,3cy11a,FlukyS,2,Sat Jul 11 20:46:13 2015 UTC,Yeah in another few years hopefully AMD's open source driver will catch up or surpass their closed one.  I hope they focus on the open one once it is close to catching up to their closed one.
linux_gaming,3cy11a,FlukyS,3,Sat Jul 11 22:14:51 2015 UTC,"This is overly simplistic.  I have a 7870, and I have seen performance improvements - measurable improvements, not just impressions - with every single Catalyst release. The latest release improved Unique Valley by 1.08x, for example.  More importantly, the performance delta between Linux and Windows is getting pretty small. A few driver versions ago, a GTX 750Ti on Windows was a pretty fair match for a 7870 on Linux. That is no longer the case. And based on teasing information out of openbenchmarking.org (man, I wish they'd fix the search function on that site) it looks like there's a delta on the nVidia side as well, so a 7870 on Linux is just whomping the hell out of a 750Ti on Linux.  Similarly, it looks like the same improvements have been happening to the 79xx cards - a 7970 looks like a very strong card on Linux right now.  But by the same token, I'm having a conversation right now in another thread with a dude who has a very similar system as mine, except he has an R9 290. And we are getting about the same performance (I'm even a little ahead of him).  So what this tells me is that it takes longer for Linux improvements to make it into the fglrx drivers. Whatever weird harolds - or new optimizations - exist in newer hardware, it takes longer for those to be rolled into the Linux drivers. And that makes perfect sense, considering how small AMD's Linux programming team must certainly be.  With that being the case, I totally expect Fury performance in Linux to be somewhat lackluster, initially. All the stuff that works the same (at the driver level) in a 7870 and a Fury will work, but any hardware features and optimizations in the Fury that need driver support to be realized won't be there yet. And with Fury (apparently?) being a fairly radical revamp, it is reasonable to expect that it will take a while before those optimizations make it into Linux.  AMD hardware works great on Linux, if you stay away from the bleeding edge. Or conversely, you can have the experience I did - be somewhat underwhelmed by your initial purchase, then get a nice little surprise with each driver release as the thing gets a little bit faster each time."

I know for the open source drivers AMD performs okay on older cards, but fglrx has always had a lackluster OpenGL stack in comparison to nVidia's I thought.  I don't think we'll see performance close to nVidia's offerings on newer cards until AMD's open source driver side really takes off with their AMDGPU drivers and Vulkan.  That's all hopefully in the future though.  I was just talking about now for those wanting to play the most intensive games out for Linux right now."
linux_gaming,3cwov7,uoou,20,Sat Jul 11 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words, everyone! Please, spread the word about our game. We really need publicity right now and every little bit helps."
linux_gaming,3cwov7,blizzardb,3,Sat Jul 11 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"If you really are one of the devs, I just gotta day, holy shit, its a great game.  The only complaint I have is the 30fps lock in the hub. I haven't tried the recent updates so I don't know if that got fixed.  But, after playing a lot of hack n slash games, victor vran is done right. Difficulty seems more based on the difficulty of the enemies and not just an increased number  of them like many other hack n slash games cough torchlight 2 cough. The item drops aren't as plentiful as other games, which is how it should be. I always hated going to a new map and not even half way through my inventory is filled up.  Please, what ever you all are doing, keep doing it. You all really know your shit and I look forward to whatever else is in the pipes for your next title."

linux_gaming,3cwov7,itwurx4me,7,Sun Jul 12 09:34:55 2015 UTC,"Victor Vran is a beautiful game.  Not only in how it looks, but in how it plays.  It hits that all-too-uncommon sweet-spot of video-games: remaining challenging enough to be rewarding, but not so difficult as to be discouraging.  It is a lovingly realized, flawlessly crafted, deeply immersive experience.   I bought this game a while back, and even deeper in EA it was mesmerizing and engaging.  Now, this close to release, it is straightforward, addictive fun.  Yesterday, I played like 12 hours non-stop, sometimes advancing the story, sometimes just trying to beat the (occasionally insane) challenges available for each dungeon or location.  Everything about the character of Victor Vran is customizable.  The game has taken a fresh approach to skills, allowing the player to shape Victor's fighting style through the nuanced interplay of perks, powers, weapons and potions.  I've personally settled on a handful of favorite weapons I rotate through, depending upon the situation.  But I'm forever tweaking and re-working my perks and powers, ever refining and improving them.  Weapons (and everything else) and their powers are upgradeable through the process called transmutation, so that a favorite  weapon has grown with me.  As I've been able to, I've upgraded my favorite sword from it's original green (uncommon) state, through a gold (rare) state, to its present purple (legendary) state.  And I feel an affinity for this and my other favorite weapons.  We've grown and developed together.  Comparisons to Kingdoms of Amalur: The Reckoning are spot on, though I found KoA less challenging than Victor Vran.  And if the player wants to make VV more challenging, there are so-called Hexes to make the game more challenging still.   Each Hex is optional and adds a buff to the monsters or a debuff to Victor.  Each Hex also increases the amount of XP earned, so the more Hexes turned on, the more XP earned --- up to 50% extra!  The devs are productive, responsive, and communicative.  This is a rare gem in the ever expanding realm of Linux games and should not be missed."
linux_gaming,3cwov7,notrox,2,Sat Jul 11 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"The challenges are superb. I love that they are optional and that they're actually often challenging. Some absurdly so (in a good way). They're interesting ways to make the game more difficult without just ramping up the enemy health or increasing their numbers.  My friend and I are trying to 5-star each area as we go.  And yeah, I agree that comparisons to Amalur only go so far. The combat is similarly fluid and kinetic but that's pretty much as far as it goes."
linux_gaming,3cwov7,psycho_driver,2,Sat Jul 11 18:26:53 2015 UTC,I bought it during the sale.  I'm trying not to play it until it's out of early access. I think the 25th they said.
linux_gaming,3cwov7,blizzardb,5,Sat Jul 11 12:52:22 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell (both playing the game and looking at their roadmap) it's basically finished. Pretty much the only thing left is translations.  The devs seem to add stuff pretty regularly based on feedback though and they've said they intend to keep doing this after release.  I've not finished it yet but I already want more of this game. For once, I hope they do DLCs."
linux_gaming,3cwov7,Not83,4,Sat Jul 11 12:56:13 2015 UTC,"A patch in early July deemed the game ""feature complete"".  However, they released some more stuff a couple of days ago including a lot more items and of course tweaks to existing stuff.  The game really is well executed.  Take a mature 3d engine (the one used in Tropico 5), tweak it to look like an old school isometric engine, add in dodging, jumping, wall-jumping etc. and they've really upped the action part of action-rpg.  Very promising game though I haven't played it much myself yet.  I like to wait for games to get fully baked before playing.  This was only the second early access title I purchased, behind Fight the Dragon.  No regrets about supporting either project."
linux_gaming,3cwov7,blizzardb,2,Sat Jul 11 14:52:00 2015 UTC,"You can start playing it. Pretty much everything is there, we are fixing minor issues and polishing some of the latest features.

I think I've seen the UI sort of mess up(frames got replaced with numbers) twice after a load screen, but loading into another area fixed that.

My current workaround is to disable unredirection, you can do so while running gnome by firing up the promp with Alt+F2, then typing lg and hitting enter to fire up looking glass.  Then in the lg prompt input Meta.disable_unredirect_for_screen (global.screen) and hit enter, then esc to collapse lg.  Keep in mind that while this does fix any tearing problems that you may have it does carry a performance penalty.  At any rate, the clutter equivalent to what you are asking seems to be setting CLUTTER_PAINT=continuous-redraw:  https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/729908/linux/-gt-334-21-redrawing-problems-in-gnome-3-10-3-12-gtx-580/post/4572127/#4572127  This didn't quite work for me, unity3d based games still teared, you may have better luck."

In some builds of Gnome3 this works perfectly, in Ubuntu's Unity it's mostly solved (but there are still some issues regarding performance). 2D only window managers usually don't have problems with this.  Regarding programming from the game developers side, this is a solved problem. You call glXSwapBuffers(), and it's then up to your drivers to decide if vsync is used or not."

linux_gaming,3cxcj5,Crinton,10,Sat Jul 11 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"The nvidia driver that comes with latest Ubuntu (nvidia-340) doesn't support GTX 970, you have to either:   Add xorg-edgers ppa. With this you can install the latest nvidia driver using the package manager and its kept up to date with system updates. This is usually the preferred method. The downside is that some packages might be incompatible with the ppa (not usually a problem) and you should remember to remove the ppa before upgrading to 15.10. Install nvidia driver manually, first downloading it from http://nvidia.com. The downside is that you have to manually update the driver every time new version arrives. Also kernel updates can break compatibility.   To install nvidia drivers with xorg-edgers, open up terminal and write this:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install nvidia-352   edit: If all you get is black screen when booting, try pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1 to get to terminal or if that doesn't work, you can boot with this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/38780/how-do-i-set-nomodeset-after-ive-already-installed-ubuntu"

Any issues you have can be quickly rectified with Arch Linux's wiki which is very well done or the forums are also pretty usefull too. Being a bleeding edge distro you won't have a problem with your gtx970.  Edit: my gf who has only ever known windows is now a Linux convert thanks to anteregos.

linux_gaming,3cxcj5,waxtats,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:37:04 2015 UTC,"I think Ubuntu should be fine. You will want to install proprietary drivers. Perhaps you should first add the xorg-edgers repository. They've got somewhat newer driver versions.   BTW, I've been having some issues with KMS not automatically being disabled. Not sure if it's just me, because I thought the proprietary drover was supposed to do that automatically. If you use the proprietary driver and KMS isn't disabled, you won't be able to boot. I had to manually disable it, which is actually very easy. You just need to add the word ""nomodeset"" to a grub file.   For instructions, just Google ""nomodeset grub"" and ""xorg-edgers PPA"". From that point on, it's a matter of simple copy-paste of a few commands."

Edit: Though, since you're just switching to Linux, you probably don't want to install Arch. Ubuntu should be fine, just make sure to install the proprietary drivers through Ubuntu's Additional Drivers menu. Remember that Ubuntu ships, by default, with the open source driver for Nvidia cards (""Nouveau"") which is not suitable for gaming. You will need the proprietary drivers. Your version should be fine, just install the drivers through the aforementioned settings pane. (I might be wrong about that, though, but, seeing as how the drivers have been out for almost a year, I would seriously doubt that they wouldn't be available for Ubuntu systems)  Edit 2: My god, after reading all the replies here... please, just stick with whatever distribution you enjoy.

If you go back to Fedora, ensure that the drivers are 343 (preferably 346 since I can attest those work) or newer and that the nouveau driver is blacklisted.

I remember being able to build a deb or an rpm.   If any of that, or the thought or reading through documentation and using the terminal only (cannot be running X to install) makes you uncomfortable, you might want to use a different distro with a more liberal stance on including up-to-date proprietary packages. It seems that Fedora's proprietary drivers are community only so it's up to them to make those packages, not the Fedora team.  Edit: I did some extra searching, the 346 drivers do seem to be available from the RPMfusion people but I don't know how to ensure the right ones get installed.

linux_gaming,3csixf,fablehere,2,Fri Jul 10 15:32:42 2015 UTC,It's possibly less cpu-bound on Linux than Windows?
linux_gaming,3csixf,tstarboy,3,Fri Jul 10 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"My experience with the few games that have been specifically tailored to run native on both linux and windows has been that the linux version runs less ""choppy"" and seems to behave in a more streamlined fashion.  Taking Left 4 Dead 2 as my main example: loads and runs generally slightly faster (FPS) running Linux Mint 17.2 Cinnamon 64bit than it does on Windows 7 64 bit - (I am dual booting.)  I hypothesize that the lack of ""choppiness"" on linux is due to the filesystem I'm currently using.  On windows the hard drive makes a lot more noise and is far more active, on linux it's not nearly so.  This is likely due to how ext4 operates as opposed to NTFS.  Keep in mind this is on a 2TB western digital hard drive, NOT an SSD.  I imagine on an SSD it would be indistinguishable.  (both partitions are on same drive)  Another thing I've noticed is that whenever I get another application pop-up, like a Skype message while I'm playing a game, is crystal clear and seamless; on windows 7 it flashes and is choppy even though my desktop resolution and game resolution are the same.  It's little things like that and more that have made me decide on Mint 17.2 as my main OS.  I hardly ever boot into windows any more.  Everything on the linux side just works.  The UI is very responsive (Cinnamon).  As for your question, that's entirely possible.  What I know for certain is that the linux kernel uses far less resource over-head than the windows kernel.  This is an advantage that Valve Software is exploiting with their Steam OS and SteamMachine initiative (happening later this year, should be quite exciting.)  Looking forward I see the advent of linux breaking into gaming as a good thing for both Microsoft and all things linux.  You know what they say about competition.  And I hear Windows 10 is going to be a game changer.  So in the end it's going to be a great thing for the rest of us.  Hope this helps."

linux_gaming,3crqcb,instantiatedObject,17,Sat Jul 11 05:56:40 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with this.  Linux has a very well-evolved model for dealing with the third-party-makes-open-source-software, distros-take-it-and-build-it, and users-have-flexibility-in-what-to-set-up.  None of that works very well when people try distributing binary software: there aren't hard guarantees or books describing The Right Thing To Do.  A few caveats, though:  I don't agree on the ""use proprietary drivers bit"", but I'm also not going to go yell at someone if they require some feature that isn't present in my drivers.  I think that the concern about ""radicals who just want free software"" is misplaced.  Sure, I'd like open source packages sometimes, and I admit that sometimes it's a little embarrassing when some guy starts agitating for something to be open-sourced, but I really don't think that it's caused problems for any authors.  I think that Steam is a great step.  It's unfortunate, in that I don't really like the Steam front end very much, but it finally provided a fairly-stable, cross-distro set of libraries and OS abstraction that someone can code against, even if it's a small set.  Steam is moving towards being a platform that works well for binaries: Linux has not (and perhaps Linux is better-off not doing so...hard to say).  I kind of wish that there was a better way to ""crowdsource"" some of the effort, to make it play better with the ""distros do the effort of making things run on themselves"" -- for example, it'd be interesting to have a standard (open-source?) Linux package for saying ""this game didn't work on my system"", and a backend that can infer from a number of automated reports that it doesn't work with a particular driver or video card or on a particular distro or controller.  I very much prefer open-source software, and I do contribute to open-source software (and games), but I've made my peace with the fact that to date, nobody has found an open-source mechanism for making competitive games with the closed source world -- this stands in contrast to, say, making a compiler or a code editor or a web server.  Until someone does, I'll enjoy my open-source games where I can get them, but I'm not going to try to avoid closed-source games on Linux.  On a non-Linux note, while the ""free to play"" explosion has created some interesting things, I kind of regret the nickle-and-diming.  I'd rather just pay for something up-front, and while there's certainly room in the world for free-to-play, I wish that piracy wasn't as much of a concern for the ""pay up front"" model."

linux_gaming,3crqcb,BURN_SHIT_NOW,9,Sat Jul 11 07:27:44 2015 UTC,"The thing this ""Game Developer"" (whomever he really is) and lots of other Linux critics tend to ignore is the relationship between the popularity of an OS and PC Gaming.  If you are like me, a life long PC gamer (that only recently got into Linux), you have a network on friends and family (and in-laws) that rely on you for any and all PC assistance. Over the past few decades all these people decided that a PC was a good investment and getting on the Internet was something they wanted to do.  And they needed our help to do it. And what did we do? Well we installed the OS that we ourselves use on all their computers, because that's the OS we are comfortable with. And that OS is whatever OS we use to play games with. Which of course for a long time has been only windows.  That is really significant, much more so then people give it credit for, and Microsoft have certainly been aware of this relationship. Games for windows, a strong competitive exclusive DirectX focus, all things done to ensure their OS remains the OS for gamers. And so becomes the OS for all the gamers families and friends, in short, most of the market.  Looking at historical Linux sales numbers is really not going to help much, and this article commits another mistake in trying to do so. Releasing a game on Linux 3, 6 or even 12 months after its Windows release is NEVER going to net you much profit, thinking it will is folly. Even now as most of us are holding our collective breath waiting for Batman and the The Witcher to get their Linux releases out, we know every week that goes by more and more Linux users break and buy the game for their Windows partition.  My point is Linux SHOULD be the OS of gamers, it really should. Games are incredibly hardware demanding by their very nature, specially triple A's, why then is the most bloated OS the one used most for gaming? You can talk about proprietary software and binary releases all you want, but the fact is there is nothing inherent in Linux to stop games from running on the platform, and there us nothing wrong with allowing games to be built natively, it would require a binary installer program thats all, and ultimately the games would run better.  The proof is in the pudding, once Valve got into it they found that Left 4 Dead runs faster on Linux then any other OS. That's not a coincidence. All Linux needs is a good chance, and some kind of landing OS for Gamers/beginner Linuxers, and we can start shooting for the stars."

That's not a coincidence. All Linux needs is a good chance, and some kind of landing OS for Gamers/beginner Linuxers, and we can start shooting for the stars.   Unfortunately this is the exception, not the rule. The amount of games that run poorly compared to their windows port far outweighs the few games Valve publishes. And even the ones that do run awesome, like say Borderlands, still are missing features (like PhysX).   Performance might be a benefit in the future, but the current state it's not so awesome; just ask anybody with Dying Light."

The general consensus in porting games to Linux has been ""lets see if it works"".   I maintain that a game made with Linux in mind, or properly ported, will run faster on Linux then any other platform.   Simply because PC outperforms Console on hardware and Linux outperforms Windows and Mac on software. This is why Linux has always seemed like a natural fit for gamers in my opinion."

Still, if they don't strongly adhere to FOSS philosophy, I think the opinion given here makes a good point at demonstrating that there's little incentive to go FOSS, even from a long term perspective PoV.   I believe Linux Gaming as it is right now has gathered most of the people that were willing to try and fuel the experience in spite of the hiccups and worse performance. Now, everyone including Valve is basically waiting for the massive influx to start happening, and that expectation solely rely on how the Steam Machines will sell.  Whomever is at fault that the situation is like this, we can't forget that we're basically saying people to come to Linux with very little gain for those of them who don't believe in FOSS. The performance will be worse, they will have to retrain, all their mods and ENB and reshade/sweetfx injectors won't work natively.

As I already explained, the situation as it is today is as you say, but that is due to a lack of commercial interest, and money. And the same can fix each and every one of the issues you mention.  But that's beside the point, as I already said, the important point here is the relationship between OS choice and Gaming platform in the market. Obviously no one is expecting Linux to suddenly be the biggest platform in a year or two, but no one can deny that the potential has always been there to be an attractive platform for gamers."
linux_gaming,3crqcb,Exodus111,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:27:14 2015 UTC,"Neither I nor them deny that there's potential. But you need resources to realize potential.  You point out yourself that the lack of commercial interest and money makes the situation what it is today: basically a chicken and egg problem.  I understand that. Most devs I believe understand that too. Most devs I believe, understand they could do something about that if they started releasing games on Linux, and create a snowball effect.   The thing is that in other to do something that's worth it, invest the resources needed to port something that wouldn't be an inferior product compared to a Windows or console version, they could jeopardize their whole business. Hence why even the most wealthy of them -except Valve that's a special case and Techland to a certain degree- are aiming at the less costly solutions, aka ""good enough to run, can't warrant anything about performance"" wrappers. That's a policy some of them (Warner Bros I'm looking at you) have already adopted for Windows ports. Can you realize how low and far stretched Linux are in their priorities?   The entire bet about investing in Linux as a gaming platform for those businesses is completely based on a bunch of ""if"", that are all unlikely to happen because MS understands too well that ISVs, which includes game editors and devs are the meat of Windows.  What makes an OS is what you can run on it. If the editors and devs were so eager to free themselves from MS control, they would have started by relying as less as possible on D3D, and pressured Khronos en masse to make OpenGL their thing.  Instead, they've been very happy with D3D iterations and the API even got such a traction that many console games engines are designed around it.  They just don't see the incentive to do that. It's not like Windows as a gaming platform is on the verge of death. The convergence in both user experience and development APIs that MS is trying to build with W10 an XBOX ONE will further reinforce their position.  There's no sense of urgency to push them to take the bet of investing in Linux Gaming as seriously as we would like them to. So, I'm not saying that Linux gaming has to rise this year or it'll be doomed, rather, the platform isn't that appealing right now, and I'm wondering how more appealing it would be even with the Steam Machines out. When the claims of worse performance on SteamOS will come out, exaggerate and blown out of proportions but very true nonetheless, whomever may be responsible for it, how much do you think the SteamOS brand will prevent the blame from falling to Linux?  It's like someone wanting you to spend more money on a good because it was made with better ethics in mind than most others. Sure in principle it's great, and of course for your own future and the one of the kids you may have in the future, a fairer world is the best option. This is the most reasonable and carefully thought choice.   Humans aren't like that most of the time. They will estimate the immediate and mid-term profit and just decide against it, because in the end it's too expensive for them."

And that is really the only solution, but it is also a complete solution. Money solves everything.  So yes its a chicken and egg, more games will come to Linux when more people start using Linux. More people will start using Linux when more games come to linux.  It SOUNDS like stalemate, until Valve.  They are going for it, they are taking their time, but they are going for it. The next step for Valve to do, is the same as any other Console, make exclusive titles. Playstation does it, Xbox does it, no reason why Steam wouldn't do it also, its how they make.... money.  Everything valve has done so far has been an exponential explosion for Linux, and Linux gaming in particular. But NOTHING will have the impact of Linux exclusive titles."
linux_gaming,3crqcb,Exodus111,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly. You might realise that now, but the writer of the article OBVIOUSLY does not.   It's not because I didn't use that particular expression that I wasn't getting it. But this has been stated so many times that saying that just doesn't help understanding the situation.   We need to start  understanding and underlining more about the specifics of the why it doesn't happen instead of instantly blaming devs for ""not understanding"". My opinion is, that is what this article does. Such lines for example -   Demands for the Linux version of a game can be sometimes quite vocal, but its actual release does not seem to bring much, if any, profit. This is not because Linux users are not willing to pay in general; rather, it means that targeting the platform is more expensive than the price that can be reasonably charged for a single copy. Other platforms are helped by the economies of scale, but this is not the case for Linux.  All in all, it seems that releasing the game on Linux now is done mostly due to developers’ enthusiasm about the platform, goodwill or - rarely - “long term” investment in making their tech cross-platform in case SteamOS turns out to be popular (there’s no immediate value in being cross-platform - developers may fix some bugs while porting, but if those bugs never mattered for their best selling platform, this is still a waste of time).   ... are very revealing about what we're discussing here rather than the overstated ""chicken and egg"" thing, that just grossly sums up the problem like it was self explanatory, never actually breaking down the details. It all caters to money as you said, but nonetheless, it's still too vague. I liked how the author phrased it, with concrete examples.   Once more people start using Linux, more games will make money on Linux.   The thing here is : why would they do that? Why switch to Linux, what does it bring to gamers? Control? What kind of control do they need they don't already have on Windows? Gamers aren't power users. They're close, but they're not to the point were they would fall for Linux with the empowering argument. You provide an answer latter to this question, I'll address it in order.   It SOUNDS like stalemate, until Valve.   Eh? It WAS a stalemate until Valve. That's exactly what it was, and IMO, we're reaching a new stalemate.   The next step for Valve to do, is the same as any other Console, make exclusive titles   I agree that the relevance of a platform in gaming lies in its gaming library, and its uniqueness. However this is still commercial suicide, most people aren't going to do that, Valve the least of them. SteamOS is being marketed in part as a way to break out of platform locking. Valve themselves are very careful about their PR and how the gamers see them as their saviour. See how they backed from selling mods?  And you want that company to then proceed to make SteamOS a vendor locking platform itself? They don't release that much games to begin with, and you want them to lock like +90% of their users base out of a new release?  The backslash if such a policy were to be adopted would first come from the core of the Linux gaming community. After all, what was so great about SteamOS if it's going to become another less performing and less mature Windows?"
linux_gaming,3crqcb,DarkeoX,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"this is still commercial suicide,    Maybe at this moment in the market. But what they are discussing in those Bellevue offices right now is HOW to do this RIGHT.   What is REALLY stopping them from doing this. The benefit of gamers moving to Linux is self explanatory. Gamers will shell out hundreds of dollars for expensive Graphic cards, and spend hours of their lives carefully building custom PCs. Windows is NOT a natural platform for someone that cares that much about framerates and high resolution.  Based on that the Steambox alone might seem like a strange choice, but this is the importance of commercial success first, or this stalemate is not getting resolved. As I said earlier the Linux community absolutely needs a Landing OS for Gamers moving to the platform who wouldn't know what SUDO is if their lives depended on it. Something that functions as quick and simply as it possible can. That's the SteamOS.  Valve then decided they wanted to merge this project with their idea of a Valve Console. Think about that. They wanted a Valve console, a totally proprietary closed system, just like the Xbox and the Playstation.  Under THAT scheme making exclusive titles seem perfectly fine, I don't think anyone would doubt that they would go that route, because they need Box sales MORE then individual game sales.  But they decided to make this part of Linux because... well they probably had a lot of reason, not the least of which is the goodwill their support of the platform would garner from the community.   See it from their point of view: Here is this platform, that's been around for years, has a dedicated following, is in many ways the frontrunner in OS innovation. And yet is used by less then 2% of the market. Once you see that for what it is, its simply a massive opportunity.  Valve has one big gun in their gaming arsenal, that they are still holding back, and they have enough money to make any impact on the market they want. You think Valve doesn't want the Steambox to be up there in sales with the Xbox and the Playstation? You think Valve doesn't want money?  Then you are as lost as the moron who wrote this article."
linux_gaming,3crqcb,Exodus111,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"Windows is NOT a natural platform for someone that cares that much about framerates and high resolution   Hmm why not? Just one thing that comes up right to my mind about this specific domain is userspace GPU fan management, which is important to avoid the GPU downclocking itself, thus loosing performance. On Windows, you install MSI Afterburner and you can start working your profiles. How does regular user do that on Linux regardless of their GPU brand? We know where the blame lies but it doesn't matter for most end users. How are they going to consider Linux the ""natural"" platform for extracting the maximum performance from their hardware with such things lacking a mature UI?  Besides, you seem to miss my entire point :   Based on that the Steambox alone might seem like a strange choice, but this is the importance of commercial success first, or this stalemate is not getting resolved. As I said earlier the Linux community absolutely needs a Landing OS for Gamers moving to the platform who wouldn't know what SUDO is if their lives depended on it. Something that functions as quick and simply as it possible can. That's the SteamOS.   I agree with that, I never said SteamOS is a bad thing, just that I understand and agree with the arguments the author of the article exposed about the whys most devs aren't really interested in SteamOS in the first place. And then I further extrapolate about how of course that will impact what SteamOS will have to offer both at launch and mid-term after launch.   Under THAT scheme making exclusive titles seem perfectly fine, I don't think anyone would doubt that they would go that route, because they need Box sales MORE then individual game sales. You think Valve doesn't want the Steambox to be up there in sales with the Xbox and the Playstation? You think Valve doesn't want money?   Of course Valve wants the money. Which is why they won't be dumb and make a move that is likely to be extremely unpopular such as an exclusive locked to SteamOS. SteamOS right now is being pushed mainly by enthusiast devs that like Linux and can justify their commercially super-risky move by underlining that developing multi-platform is planning future economy of scale and independence. If SteamOS takes the Windows vendor lock-in path, there will  be someone to take advantage of the momentum and the public outcry that shakes Valve. That and the fact that Valve themselves are very sensitive to public outcry, especially if it loses them money.   Sun crashed. Kodak is but the shadow of what it was. Geocities is gone. AOL almost reduced to bare bones before being bought this year.  I think you fail to realize how it is careful long term planning that brought up SteamOS, and that Valve isn't going to risk sabotaging all those efforts with some rash ""exclusive"" scheme that could earn them more problems that profit.    EDIT: Look, another dev team supporting Linux:   MR: I understand why they chose Linux as the basis for Steam OS, [...] It’s one of these chicken and egg issues – [...] I think Steam boxes will be an ultimate success, but I think it will be a slow burn over time rather than a big bang success story."
linux_gaming,3crqcb,DarkeoX,12,Sat Jul 11 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"Wierd question... It already is a viable gaming platform, if it wasn't I doubt we'd have over 1000 new titles out for linux on steam just in a few years."
linux_gaming,3crqcb,uff0,2,Fri Jul 10 10:52:28 2015 UTC,"I think it is more of a gamble now. We getting all these ports because, the devs betting on the success of the Steam Machines. Should the Steam Machines becoming a total failure (worst case) you can bet your monthly paycheck, that the Linux support will decrease."
linux_gaming,3crqcb,Leerdeck,0,Fri Jul 10 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"But few thinks it will be a total failure. Which says Valve will drop their initiative and no steam machines for you and I.   On the other hand:  There is a chance for total success within years. That is Linux and Steam Machines will dominate the gaming scene like Android does on phones/tablets. Then games will be published for Linux first.  Very likely we will see a moderate success where many people want a steam machine for their livingroom gaming and entertainment and a few desktop tasks. Then companies will profit on their linux release and most will support linux for better economical margins.  Even with a moderate initial failure this ball will probably not stop. Good part of the gaming/graphics industry have already invested a lot in Linux and cross platform technologies which will not vanish. Steamos, better drivers, Vulkan, GOG Galaxy, all the released and in development linux games, etc, will be benefitial for Linux gaming no matter what. Also the imperative to stay free from Microsoft and Sony remains true.  My feel says this can not go too bad. Even with less initial success the situation is improving for bigger success at a later time."

linux_gaming,3crqcb,Swiftpaw22,4,Sat Jul 11 04:19:09 2015 UTC,Right now the best thing you can do for Linux gaming is switching to SteamOS for your gaming purposes (Ubuntu is reasonably close).   ?  No... Buy a Steam Machine or run your desktop on Ubuntu. Don't suggest people install SteamOS as a gaming operating system for the desktop...
linux_gaming,3crqcb,waxtats,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:25:22 2015 UTC,Exactly- installed Steam OS for a few days after needing to do a complete OS reinstall (Ubuntu failed). Was an awful experience. Terrible with keyboard and mouse and missing key features (no ability to change resolution?). Obviously it's still a beta but it needs some massive improvements if it is to be used as anything but OS for streaming devices (even then i'd opt for something more open that has tre capability of media/non-steam game streaming)
linux_gaming,3crqcb,Sicmay,2,Sat Jul 11 01:02:08 2015 UTC,If you mean users installing Linux to play games then NO.  The ONLY way it can be a viable gaming platform if a company ships it as a console and brand it (like Steam Machine). Until then it would be a great achievement if Linux gamers surpass 2% of the market. Latest steam figures puts Linux users at less than 1%.
linux_gaming,3crqcb,knro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:28:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd say that it ""can"" be.  Rather I'd say ""it is"" already.  There are over 1,200 titles on Steam that are Linux games.  That's considerable.  The only thing that I think a developer would need is to find out if they can sell enough to cover porting costs.    On Jupiterbroadcasting.com's Linux Action Show recently (IIRC) they covered how many games most developers would need to sell to break even on the average porting costs (which are minuscule compared to development costs of creating a new game from scratch).  I think the number was somewhere around 1,600 sales of the game to break even.  All other sales are gravy.  AND...All game sales drop.  Some sooner than later.  Most due to being played out or that the product just isn't up to par.  For that reason alone a developer needs to spend a few months of sleepless nights fighting for a presence on every platform they can.  The culture clash comment is a red herring.  Don't even consider it.  Just move on.  People don't think that way when it comes to games.  Provide all and any games and you'll have a loyal audience."

The first is about a very early prototype, made with a different engine, and the second is about Aurora one. (See especially #2 from 3:35 about the author of TexturePaint).

I have not played it in a few weeks but I might even put a texture mod in and see how my 970/4690K combo handles it.
linux_gaming,3cosi0,CaptSkunk,2,Fri Jul 10 08:26:14 2015 UTC,"When it came out I was sporting a Phenom II x4 855 CPU with a R9 270x 2GB Card. The game ran like butter on day one and was easily my favourite game of the past few years. Didn't have to guts to jump back in and play it on hard though, it was pretty long.  Now I've upgraded to a 4790k and 970s in SLI. The amount of frames I get now via DSR (making the game render at a higher res and outputing at your monitor res, EG, 4k to 1080p) is uncanny. It never has drops or stutters and looks beautiful and plays beautiful. If anything I think it's a graphics engine everyone needs to take points from. I've never seen such optimisations."

I get a constant 60 FPS (have Vsync on, so it's limited to that by my monitor) and it just looks gorgeous. The cut-scenes are just absolutely amazing. I was really just in awe, during the first few hours.   Now, if I can bring myself to continue. Those dang androids get on my nerves and I've got to sneak around a bunch of them, on the communications deck. I'm still early into the game."

I almost feel a little bad that I never gave their Total War series a go and I was raised on Age of Empires, feels just to take a look see.  The game is a perfect embodiment of what Alien is all about. Nerves, uncertain and facing off against something much stronger than you. Don't fret about the Androids, I think they are the weakest link in the game and you can easily run around them. However if you are playing on a harder mode.. Well let me tell you this.. What I thought was a 'scripted' intro for the Alien no matter what, isn't. After finishing it on normal and recently playing the opening I was sure the Alien 'couldn't ' appear until you reached.. cough not saying when cough, so I ran around the first few levels like an idiot, thinking 'I know this games mechanics now.. Until I heard the hiss and the pounding of its feet as it ran at me.. Man I screamed.. I let my whole guard down because I was so sure. The AI in.. AI is seriously remarkably smart. Its the best I've seen to date and every other hide and sneak game is beat compared."

linux_gaming,3crwv7,ForAFewShekelsMore__,15,Fri Jul 10 07:36:13 2015 UTC,"I tried to dig around in the source code. Having it compile wasn't too easy, there were a bunch of include errors (SDL on my system is in /usr/include/SDL/SDL.h, not /usr/include/SDL.h), as well as a few other issues.  To compile you need to do the following:   cd /path/to/Maelstrom/ ./configure   here you'll get an output which will most likely tell you you're missing such or such library. Install it with  sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev for example, replacing with the proper library. Packages names often look like ""libXXX-dev"" for the library needed. Repeat the last step until it works fine, then  make -j $(($(nproc) + 1))   In my case that wasn't enough because of that SDL location issue; I had to do something like  find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i ""s/include \""SDL/include \""SDL\/SDL/""    to add the SDL/ prefix for each SDL lib inclusion. Be careful though because SDL_FrameBuffer.h is also included in a bunch of places but it's a local lib, not something located in /usr/include/SDL/. I corrected my mistake with:  find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i ""s/include \""SDL\/SDL_FrameBuf/include \""SDL_FrameBuf/""    (which is kinda meh but well). If I remember well I had a bunch of inclusion errors, not sure why. I linked the files in the proper directories with   ln -s /path/to/missing/file/from/directory /path/to/missing/file/in/directory   (for example let's say test.h is missing from ./a/b/c/ but is located in ./a/b/e/f/, you'd do ""ln -s ../e/f/test.h ./a/b/c/test.h"" from ""."")  I'm not too sure about that one, but I believe I also had errors about some conversion which wasn't persmissive enough. I solved it by adding CXXFLAGS='-fpermissive' to the make line, like so:  make -j 9 CXXFLAGS='-fpermissive'  When all that is done, running make -j numberOfCoresOnYourProcessor should land you a nice ./Maelstrom which is executable.  Now to modify it to suite your needs.I can't say I've been successful here because I'm not sure exactly of the rules of the game nor of the goal you're trying to achieve. That being said, I found, in ./netlogic/game.cpp, a few interesting bits. Namely:  NextWave(void): a bunch of stuff looking like:    /* See about the Multiplier */     if ( FastRandom(2) )             gMultiplierShown = ((FastRandom(30) * 60)/FRAME_DELAY);     else             gMultiplierShown = 0;      /* See about the Prize */     if ( FastRandom(2) )             gPrizeShown = ((FastRandom(30) * 60)/FRAME_DELAY);     else             gPrizeShown = 0;      /* See about the Bonus */     if ( FastRandom(2) )             gBonusShown = ((FastRandom(30) * 60)/FRAME_DELAY);     else             gBonusShown = 0;   My understanding is that it gives for each ... object? a 50% chance to spawn for each wave, and it will spawn at a random time (between 0 and 30seconds because FRAME_DELAY is expressed in 60th of seconds according to Maelstrom.h).   The actual object spawning is done in the ""housekeeping"" section, which I assume is run at each frame. gPrizeShown, for example, is decreased, and if equal to 0, the prize spawns.  I'm not sure from there on what you're trying to achieve. To guarantee a prize drop at each wave, just remove the if(FastRandom(2) and the else associated (and the line below it) so that gPrizeShown is always initialized. (it doesn't work if it's 0 because the housekeeping function checks if it's positive, and if substracting one is equal to 0, basically doing the checking and updating in one go.)  Apart from that, having multiple prizes dropping at each wave, from my understanding, would be a bit more involved.  EDIT: thought about it a tad bit more, and I think you might be able to do something about it in ""static void DoHouseKeeping()"" in game.cpp. You have a bunch of those:       /* -- Maybe throw a prize(!) up on the screen */     if (gPrizeShown && (--gPrizeShown == 0) )             MakePrize();   Which as I said before spawns the chosen object if gPrizeShown is equal to 1, and decrease it.  What you could do is reset it to another value as well to have one spawn soon afterwards. It might do the trick. Something like:           if (gBonusShown && (--gBonusShown == 0 && (gBonusShown = (10*60/FRAME_DELAY))) )   the part after the ""&&"" will only be executed if all the leftward conditions are true, and when you assign 10 it'll return that, which counts as ""true"". You might want to try that out and report back.  Also, you can tweak what gets dropped by taking a look at the ""MakePrize"" function. It chooses between 8 outcomes depending when it is called, some of which aren't very nice if I understand the code well.  Hope that helps !"

You can have a 100% ""Modern UI"" tablet-like PC, or you can have a 0% ""Modern UI"" Desktop-like PC, or you can fine-tune to any percentage in between.

Well, Linux in general is both; in fact, among the mature operating systems it's the only serious and direct competitor for MS products. BSDs don't enjoy the same level of support as Linux, and Apple products come with hefty cost of replacing the hardware. Then, SteamOS can be tinkered into a desktop replacement. And it definitely is a competitor of windows (and MS consoles) in the gaming niche ""for those who just play games"". Obviously, for those who need AutoCAD SteamOS won't be a lucrative option.  The problem with ""windows replacement"" is that people don't mean it as a ""functional replacement"", but as a verbatim replacement.

In terms of market, most people play consoles because its cheap, easy to setup and lots of games with no need to put up with heaps of specs or upgrading your system/hardware all the time. SO the SM will obviously not get anyone from the playstation or xbox crowd, what other customers are out there? - PC people. Whether its linux or windows, these people already have an established home systems, why move, why spend the extra money? Specs. If there are going to be a range of 'cheaper' to expensive steamboxes like the ones we are currently seeing, then we get something like what we have with android phones today - JUST like pcs and laptops. Each steam machine will be different, some will have certain limits to what kind of games it can play and others like samsung will be superpowerful and overexpensive - which totally defeats the purpose of having an all-in-one convenient system. Assuming this does shoot off - gamedevs all hop on the steam boat and start churning out heaps of games, and suddenly thousands of people sell their consoles for the steambox/steam machine whatever, and the steam box has heaps of sales - this could flop just like the wii did - why? Because its too niche - XBOX and PS consoles have huge dedicated communities, and social aspects and all games are made to work for EVERYONE with that console - PC has a crowd only because its multipurpose and has its own large range of games.    What advantage would a steam box have that could somehow top all of these? Probably nothing, it will just become known as the non-upgrade-able PC, that tried to be a console but failed - all with a Valve label slapped on top of it.  The truth is that the steambox could easily flop trying to be somewhere halfway between PC and console. Unless the steambox or whatever starts to market itself as more than just a pc trying to sneak its way into your living room its not going to shoot off - and the only games that are going to be available for it will be a few cheap indie games."

Cheap - Nope. Only the initial cost for the console. The games are MUCH more expensive, online fees, etc.  Easy to setup - Well, the SM is designed to be this as well.  A lots of games - PC Gaming (incl. Linux if you know the ""tricks"") has ALOT more games than all consoles together. If you only count ""current"" gen (maybe +last gen) games, Linux should be at least equal. (I don't have numbers right now.) With the success of Vulcan, the SM would be always on top of usual consoles.  The only reason why console gaming is (still) this popular is because people are uneducated and misled by the marketing.   The truth is that the steambox could easily flop trying to be somewhere halfway between PC and console.   That's where I have to agree.. Not especially because SM is too niche, but mainly because valve does not have the massive marketing budget of MS and Sony. Also, people like to stick to their known stuff, so it'll be hard to introduce a new ""console"".  I guess time will tell.

Most average PC users and people on steam already, probably don't have much reason to move over.   The other thing is whether this will really even make a difference in pushing the consoles market - and I don't think many console gamer's would buy, if at all at the least switch over to regularly playing on a steam machine where they have to  A) Set everything up B) Deal with / Worry about specs, 'software' updates/upgrades with different SM's. C) If they wanted to play PC games on the big screen they can just as easily hookup their laptop to stream live to their TV. D) Steam-OS operating system will need some out-of-house games and developers jumping on board - what I mean is look at Steam on PS3, there are less than a hundred games - the only game on PS3 I played on steam was portal. And that was just because it was cheaper than buying it from the store.  If this whole SM thing is going to take off its got to either suddenly convince game companies around the world to jump on board and port over their windows, xbox and playstation games over to their platform or have a new group of people to develop on their platform, which won't be many except for a few indie games.   The only way I can see this making it is if the few games on the steambox drop to under a dollar and hundreds of people jump on board just for the cheap games - just like how steam originally came about. There's no other way to spin this - EA and other big company names with their armies of loyal fans and other casual gamers (the whole of the EA origin) won't drop their PCs and consoles just for this steam box thing.

Also the fact that the last time I saw the Wii U at somebody's garage sale rather than at the store games shows its mucked up.  My point is that for Steam to go in this direction AND SUCCEED to actually pull and lock those people into their STEAM BOX/machine they need to make it something special - and so far there’s no reason for anyone to buy into Valve’s steam os platform right now. Console gamers might as well stick with their consoles while PC gamers are better off just building a Windows machine so they can take advantage of everything the already established Steam for windows has to offer."

Console owners know the downsides. That said, the steambox/SM is fighting against two of the biggest and ONLY markets out their for at-home gaming, PCs and consoles all at once.  Here's the thing, just look at how consoles came about and took a large portion of what was originally PC gamers - they gave not only buyers but game producers something that everybody wanted - a standard platform with the same specs, software and hardware for EVERY device. When you want to throw something out there TOTALLY NEW and sell something such as a console - there's got to be a good reason for it to exist and for people to use it - and right now SM doesn't have much to back it up.   Look at Wii, even the Wii had something going for it - namely being family friendly and having a motion sensor remote thing and it STILL flopped."

They are using PC's to fight consoles, and microsoft.   Anyway, I get your points, but I simply disagree that the steambox doesn't have a selling point. I think the huge back catalog of games is a major selling point on its own.   You say the console users you know have a console because they can't/don't have to upgrade it, the console gamers I know all wish they could upgrade theirs... Instead of having to buy a completele new console whenever the next generation comes out.   Also, easy out of the box, steamboxes will do this. And huge game library? You realize SteamOS has more games than PS4 or Xbone already right?"
linux_gaming,3cmzjl,ChaosDent,3,Fri Jul 10 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"If Steam Machines sell Wii, or even Wii U level numbers the project will be a massive success for Valve. All the popular middleware engines are Linux compatible now, so a large portion of game developers are in a position to sell to an audience that size. They don't need to sell that much to be woth continued investment, they just need to sell enough to be a viable alternative.  Third party support dried up for Nintendo's platforms because the systems were different enough from their competitors and the audience at large wasn't very interested in their games. That won't be the case for Steam OS, given that it runs on the same hardware as Windows and people will buy Steam Machines for these kinds of games (PC exclusive, Indie and some console-style AAA).  I think your half-way between PC and Console point is the most relevant here.  They are like PC in that they are:   A diverse line of products from various OEMs. Some upgradeable, some not. Some incompatibilities will slip by QA because of this. Hackable - You can install third party software or operating systems, but that lets you mess things up pretty badly. Capable of running full PC style games with mouse input (Civ V, Cities Skylines, Kerbal Space Program etc). You'll be able to upgrade components or the whole system at some point, and all your old games won't just work, they will probably run better.   They are like consoles in that they are:   Simple plug & play boxes for TV gaming. Self-updating and low maintenance. Launching without a rolling 10 years of backwards compatible games (plus another 5-10 years of hackable compatibility and 30 years of emulated compatibility).   It's that last console point that I always hear from doubters. If it's a console, why no EA/Activision/Ubisoft support, if it's a PC, why not Windows? It's a good question, and if you are a heavy game consumer who alreay has a PS4 and a Windows gaming PC, then you probably don't need a Steam Machine."

My guess is nothing much except for an over-hyped, expensive, console/pc for indie gamers, and indie game developers - which could still flop considering how the vast majority of devs, coders and all have learned their trade ON and FOR the PC."

But by then you will have second hand consoles on ebay quite cheaply.  As a PC person I would like to be able to play games on the sofa not on my chair.

On the specs side of things the lowest end SM will out perform or match today's consoles. The flip to this is 4 years from now I can upgrade my SM while console owners are stuck with their specs.  As for whether it could flop, yeah it totally could. Personally I feel it's a lot less likely to flop vs ending up going Windows for the SteamOS instead of Linux.

Very true. Though the big difference is that on PC/Steambox, you can adjust graphical settings to make the game run better. So yes, I do think getting a low end PC is favorable over getting a traditional console.

The problem with the Steam PC micro console things is the parts you'd really want to upgrade to get more power later are soldered into the board.  As far as graphics settings, I can see that being a good option, but I will say that for my part, I hate having to use them. I install a game, crank it up to max and play it. If my PC isn't capable of that, I generally don't bother until I can make that the case. That's also probably why I don't mind consoles and their issues. I don't have to fiddle with anything, and it runs more or less like the developer intended for that platform. I would LOVE for these things to all be available on one platform, and I'm hopeful with DX12 and Vulkan that the PC experience will become more consistent.  As for aiming Steam PCs at console gamers, that seems like a bad idea. They're already raging about them costing more than the other consoles, and these are the same bunch that argue amongst each other about resolution and framerate without having the sense to just invest in a PC if that's what they care about. Giving them a low voltage laptop PC that runs about the same as their current console for more money doesn't sound like good marketing.  What we need is someone to pull a Microsoft and take a fat loss up front to gain market penetration. Make a Steam PC that just utterly annihilates the primary consoles (maybe something with a 970m in it) for around that $500, and I bet they would leave MS and Sony at a total standstill."

They do not need to make profit on the machines. Maybe loose a bit even. I don't know their marketing model, but it's not uncommon to make a loss on the initial sale and then make profit on the refills or whatever. Printer companies for example often loose or at least not make profit on printers but there are huge margins on the ink. Steam could do the same with their consoles and games.  Also, to make sure steamOS gets successful, steam can choose to offer the consoles for very cheap initially to make people buy them, and making them more expensive later on when people want to buy them anyway."
linux_gaming,3cmzjl,g1i1ch,7,Thu Jul 9 09:10:06 2015 UTC,"Except that Valve is not doing the hardware for the steam machine, I don't think Alienware & Co would be happy to not make any profit."
linux_gaming,3cmzjl,dxkillr,2,Thu Jul 9 10:23:56 2015 UTC,Good point. But Valve could pay them to make the steamboxes cheap.
linux_gaming,3cmzjl,shmerl,2,Thu Jul 9 13:11:10 2015 UTC,"Valve's ""hands-off"" approach to everything they do, whether it be Steam machine hardware, early access and steam games in general is quite annoying.  I can appreciate that they want to allow developer freedom and encourage PC OEMs to build Steam Machines etc. But it leaves too much room for utter crap to be presented and sold to consumers. They really need to be hands on and police this stuff in my opinion."

linux_gaming,3cmzjl,LongBowNL,3,Thu Jul 9 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"Well said. I've been defending Steam Machines from the very start. It's obvious some people don't understand it when it's very simple. Valve is making a console, not a general use pc.   The biggest argument I see is people claiming they can just build their own pc with windows. Which is more an argument against consoles in general than against Steam Machines.   Some people seem genuinely mad at me for being excited. Saying things like, why don't you get a really long hdmi cord, or wireless hdmi from my computer to my tv. That completely ignores the ease of use of a console. I can just imagine with that set up, I'm playing a game and suddenly a java update window appears. I'd have to get up and run all the way up to my computer to close it and then run all the way back, probably while my character is dying. Rinse and repeat.  I'm really excited for steam machines. I have a PC for gaming and a console. I like playing on both. But it would be amazing to have a shared library between them."

linux_gaming,3cmzjl,LordCurlyFry,2,Thu Jul 9 13:52:54 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that they aren't trying to push the console market. That's exactly what they are trying, but they are careful to frame it as if they don't, because they face the current unhealthy situation when poor competition caused a common perception that console must be cheap. That's not going to fly with Steam Machines. Fixing that will take time, (competition is exactly what will eventually fix it), that's why they aren't openly claiming they want to compete. They want to gradually change the perception first."
linux_gaming,3cmzjl,MissValeska,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"I still think it's definitely a double movement for A) getting some sort of foot hold in the console market, and B) Pushing gaming on Linux.

linux_gaming,3cmzjl,hardolaf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"They aren't going to destroy it, but they can cause MS and Sony to start updating hardware more frequently because of competition as well as eroding perception that consoles must be always low end and cheap. I bet they took mobile situation as a model to some degree, and there strong competition causes the whole spectrum of devices to be available (from low to high end), and users choose what they want. That's where they aim with consoles too eventually."

If you want Catalyst in Fedora(and take this with a grain of salt as I haven't done this for a while), you have to make sure that you are NOT running Gnome, then got to AMD's site and pick up the Linux x86_64 .run file to install.

linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,4,Thu Jul 9 04:03:39 2015 UTC,Interesting point:   Vulkan will replace all uses of OpenGL over time – potentially quite a long time – and for those developers that do not need all the flexibility that Vulkan provides – there will be libraries and engines that layer over the low-level API.   So we'll see Wayland using Vulkan I hope? And what will happen to EGL? There will be EVulkan or something?
linux_gaming,3cjvry,FlukyS,2,Wed Jul 8 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really need to handle anything special for Vulkan support really. Its just another graphics API. SDL2 handles both Wayland and Mir, it will send it to the correct output for rendering to the screen as long as the GPU driver is there and supports Vulkan. There shouldn't be any question both Wayland and Mir will handle Vulkan just fine."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,ancientGouda,2,Wed Jul 8 23:45:16 2015 UTC,Wayland cannot use Vulkan because it doesn't know anything about graphics APIs.
linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,0,Thu Jul 9 00:41:02 2015 UTC,"Wayland uses EGL which is tied to OpenGL. So it uses OpenGL indirectly because of that. That's what I'm talking about. If someone will make an EGL alternative that would use Vulkan, I guess Wayland can use that instead."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,ancientGouda,2,Thu Jul 9 00:59:11 2015 UTC,It seems you are confused about this.. Wayland doesn't use EGL or OpenGL. It's just a protocol for a compositor to exchange buffers and messages with a client via a unix socket. The Wayland libraries have no dependencies on anything but standard C libraries.
linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,0,Thu Jul 9 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"To draw those buffers through something, no? It's not happening in the vacuum.  I clearly see EGL and GLES here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/The_Linux_Graphics_Stack_and_glamor.svg  My point is to see a similar scheme for Vulkan."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,Astrognome,3,Thu Jul 9 02:33:36 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, all rendering is up to the compositor, graphically, Wayland mostly does modesetting and writing of the framebuffer. I could be wrong though."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,Crespyl,2,Thu Jul 9 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"This.  So, for example, kwin might use a Vulkan based API to handle accelerated rendering/compositing, and use Wayland to talk to the clients."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,ancientGouda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:44:46 2015 UTC,"In that diagram, the Wayland communication is marked by the yellow W icon (connections 2 and 3). As you can see, they are separate from any rendering API.  A scheme for a Wayland client and compositor exchanging Vulkan buffers would be an implementation detail of the WSI extension exposed by the Vulkan driver AFAIK."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:54:58 2015 UTC,"So why is EGL then listed in the diagram if Wayland is completely separate from how communication with actual hardware happens? It's just a common way of making compositors and Wayland clients, or Wayland dictates it in some way?   A scheme for a Wayland client and compositor exchanging Vulkan buffers would be an implementation detail of the WSI extension exposed by the Vulkan driver AFAIK.   So WSI is already being worked on? Do you know if some Wayland compositors already started working on it too, or it's too early for that?"
linux_gaming,3cjvry,ancientGouda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"Because the client uses EGL to setup a GL/GLES context to draw into a buffer. It then uses the Wayland protocol to send this buffer to the compositor*. But neither compositor nor the Wayland stack ever knew any of this drawing took place; they don't really care because that's an implementation detail of the client.  * This is a bit inaccurate, what happens is the client calls eglSwapBuffers(), and then EGL, via its Wayland platform implementation, takes care of sending the buffer to the compositor. So instead of saying ""Wayland uses EGL"", I think it's actually more accurate to say ""EGL uses Wayland""."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:15:43 2015 UTC,I see. So someone will have to write a similar functionality for WSI I guess.
linux_gaming,3cjvry,ancientGouda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, someone will have to write a Vulkan extension that will do the Wayland specific stuff for you. From the few screenshots we've had, it looks like the internal Intel Vulkan driver that Valve and co are working with has an X11 specific WSI (and Mantle had a Windows specific one), but the wording that Khronos used during their GDC presentation(p31) hinted at platform-independent WSI's (which will instead be specific to the buffer allocation scheme, ie. compositor or client allocated buffers, which is also a difference between Wayland and Mir), so client code will likely not even know its running on a Wayland platform."

linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:30:14 2015 UTC,"What I meant is mostly drivers and EGL. Even if major DEs like Gnome and KDE will wrap up Wayland support soon, Nvidia is still behind with Wayland / EGL integration. With something like Vulkan being supported uniformly, EVulkan can be simply supported across all drivers as a single codebase, which means much easier way of enabling Wayland everywhere."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,Linux_PCMR,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:52:10 2015 UTC,far as i know EGL is not going away also it's just Vulkan API will be used for App's Etc i don't see why you can't run EGL and Vulkan at the same time and the big delay with the Nvidia Wayland GPU drivers was Xwayland Nvidia did not work with the community on the drivers and the Xwayland developers changed how Xwayland was was going to work so who knows when the Nvidia drivers will come around lets hope they release with Fedora 23 as it will be running a Wayland desktop
linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,0,Wed Jul 8 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"EGL is dependent on OpenGL now (or more properly GLES), and probably has some design decisions catered for that. So I'd expect some Vulkan geared alternative to show up, and it would make sense for Wayland to switch to it. I'm not familiar with it however, may be it's trivial to simply switch EGL to use Vulkan underneath, then Wayland won't need any changes whatsoever. But as I said, now there is no single EGL implementation for Wayland (i.e. there are different for different drivers), which is the reason for delays."

People griping about having to write lower level code crack me up. Most people will just use an existing engine like UE4/unity and not have to worry about anything changing, and the UE4/unity devs will have a lot more power to make things work better.  Anyone who deals with OpenGL directly basically wants this, and anyone who doesn't deal with OpenGL doesnt have room to complain."

linux_gaming,3cjvry,bufke,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:21:29 2015 UTC,Will Vulkan mean I can play opengl 4.x games with intel GPU on Linux? I don't really understand what is vulkan vs opengl vs mesa.
linux_gaming,3cjvry,dasiffy,4,Wed Jul 8 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"vulkan is new, made by the same group as opengl(cl) but it's based off mantle i think. (EDIT: Vulkan is derived from and built upon components of AMD's Mantle) I don't believe there will be ""backwards compatibilty"" with openXX because it's new from the ground up.  mesa is just a bunch of libraries which openGL use."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,pfannkuchen_gesicht,2,Wed Jul 8 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"You're mixing up a few things here. OpenGL and Vulkan are API specifications for drawing with the help of dedicated hardware. Mesa is one implementation of the OpenGL specification. So in a really bad analogy: OpenGL(or Vulkan) is like a blueprint for an oven, which makes it easier to control fire/heat with an interface(knobs and dials). Mesa is the oven that's been built from the blueprints. Now that makes it far easier to cook, since you don't have to mess around with the fire itself but you have a interface now which controls it precisely for you.  Now existing games won't benefit from Vulkan, because they would need to be ported to Vulkan first. To continue the analogy: Your cook currently works with an oven that only has one cooking plate and one knob, which is also kinda imprecise. So you have to cook one thing at the time and hope the temperature is exactly what you wanted. Now with the new oven(Vulkan) you have 4 cooking plates and a dial for each, so you need to use these 4 knobs now to really benefit from it and also the knobs work differently(more precisely), so you can't simply use the same techniques as before, but the new ones are far more efficient."

I hope to be wrong, but I cant see why they would put their engineers to develop software for an API that is competing against their own implementation."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,OneElkCrew,6,Wed Jul 8 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"competition for directx is good.  from what i remember, vulkan will use all of the system together - vram stacking, different gpus together, etc."

linux_gaming,3cjvry,pnpbios,-2,Wed Jul 8 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"These tools and first drivers are expected to be available for Vulkan developers during 2015.   Wow, that helped.  2015 is half way over."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,3,Wed Jul 8 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"That's what Neil Trevett said in the interview as well:   There is a lot of energy and effort going into defining Vulkan – it is not a normal, multi-year, standardization effort – it will be completed much faster than that… <...> Vulkan is still on schedule to have specs and implementations before the end of the year."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,pnpbios,-7,Wed Jul 8 17:02:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and AMD, NVidia, and Intel have to write the implementation. As far as anybody knows, only AMD is actually bothering with it, because they already have a partial implementation via mantle's existing code base.   “NVIDIA is a strong supporter of OpenGL and we are actively engaged in the development of Vulkan,” said Barthold Lichtenbelt, senior director of Tegra graphics software at NVIDIA.    From NVidia, that means dick."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,totallyblasted,8,Wed Jul 8 17:07:32 2015 UTC,"And if you actually read before posting nonsense or at least look out of your arse, you'd know NVidia already presented working Vulkan driver and its benefits at GDC in march"
linux_gaming,3cjvry,pnpbios,-3,Wed Jul 8 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"So where can you download it?  Surprised how everybody is falling for this, especially from nvidia, a known bullshitter.  Marketing promises are not to be taken at face value."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,DaVince,8,Wed Jul 8 17:33:28 2015 UTC,"So where can you download it?   Vulkan itself isn't even ready, why would you want an incomplete driver based on an incomplete spec?  The driver is developed as the spec is developed, so the ideas can be tested.   Marketing promises are not to be taken at face value.   Yeah, maybe if this was a new thing from one company. It's not. It's a spec developed by Khronos, a standards committee backed by AMD, NVIDIA and Intel as well as many other companies invested in computer graphics (like Valve and Epic). I was skeptical about Mantle because it was just AMD doing a thing, but Vulkan is honest-to-goodness being supported and developed by a group of people - not just a group of people who know what they're talking about, but a group that is a standards committee with quite a portfolio of released specs that are in use.  So no one is ""falling for it"". Considering all the news everyone is simply taking for granted that Vulkan will be a thing. AMD's Mantle was the first push."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,totallyblasted,5,Wed Jul 8 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"I know that you're just unsuccessful troll (and bad one at that), but I will indulge you  NVidia has much to gain from Vulkan. Mainly cheaper drivers (something like independent OpenGL layer on top of Vulkan would make it even more so profitable in the long run with providing zero cost long term support for old apps, but this won't be interesting until NVidia sees the low margin of profit with OGL). And not even mentioning that them not supporting next gen api equals to partial suicide. It is not NVidia that guarantees this, it is pure and simple greed that makes it unavoidable truth. And guess what NVidia is based on primarily... greed for more and easier money"
linux_gaming,3cjvry,shmerl,4,Wed Jul 8 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"Initial Intel implementation was already donated by Valve and LunarG. I expect Nvidia to be ready at release time, same as they are with OpenGL."

linux_gaming,3cjvry,pnpbios,-5,Wed Jul 8 17:20:34 2015 UTC,"What news? There hasn't been any news other than a beta program for one single game, DOTA2.  There are a grand total of 12 games that run mantle, 8 of them on the frostbite engine. All of which only run on windows.  Vulkan is just another abandoned valve project.  You can stick in the same shed as half life 3, Prospero, Stars of Blood, Return to Ravenholm, the Crossing, Pipeline, the JJ Abrams collaboration, and Power Play.  Everything on Khronos's forum is speculative fiction.  https://www.khronos.org/message_boards/forumdisplay.php/114-Vulkan-High-Efficiency-GPU-Graphics-and-Compute  It's not going to happen. It's slated for release for late 2015, right?  I can't find any information on it on AMD's site, on Intel's site, and the only thing for nvidia's site is a gfx demo for the fx 5900."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,DaVince,7,Wed Jul 8 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Before going on, be sure to watch this video in its entirety, and notice all the names of the companies involved.  Vulkan's a spec that is in development and planned to be supported by all the major GPU developers as well as at least a few game developers, including Valve, and it's seeing support from a bunch of other major studios like Epic.  Many game developers have been finicking with and working around OpenGL's quirks, which is the reason why people working with these things are looking forward to it. It's very likely going to see a lot of support and usage once it's out, since many devs will have their hands on it. So of course it's going to happen.  About Mantle: that's what Vulkan is based on, which is the very reason that Mantle is now being deprecated. Mantle served its purpose: it has made people start thinking about writing a better, more efficient API, and it is the basis for Vulkan itself (Vulkan is basically a cross-vendor supported Mantle 2.0). Considering that Vulkan is a collaborative effort between the major GPU vendors and even some game developers, and not just AMD, it wouldn't be wise to dismiss it off-hand like that.  As for information on AMD/Intel/NVIDIA's sites:   AMD mentions the Vulkan name in their new line of GPUs: AMD 1, AMD 2. NVIDIA had a news article and now refers you to the Khronos site because that is where development is happening. Intel demonstrated a Vulkan demo at GDC.   Also, don't forget the fact that Intel already has a Vulkan driver. It gets developed alongside the spec to see how their ideas on paper work out in reality. It's developed by LunarG.  There are a lot of people behind the development of this spec. It's far beyond a single company's pipe dream, and the result of many big issues that people were having while using OpenGL. Basically, it's been a long time coming, and I'm surprised it didn't happen earlier.  Finally, I suggest you check out /r/vulkan if you want to stay up-to-date. There won't be all that much news until the spec is actually out, but you can ask questions and get answers for as far as possible right now. Lots of good info."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,pnpbios,-3,Wed Jul 8 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I want Vulkan to be a success. It just won't. I watched that video on my phone over my lunch break when it first came out.  It's not coming out in 2015, at least not in a way that indie developers are going to be able to use. Valve gets first dibs on it because they helped create it, but we all know what happens with valve projects."
linux_gaming,3cjvry,DaVince,6,Wed Jul 8 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not getting you wrong, you're just giving off the impression that you didn't have all the pieces of the puzzle. Which is why I provided as much info as I could.  Unless Khronos as a whole screws the spec up royally, Vulkan is likely going to be a success. And I don't think they will screw up because this is the first graphics spec Khronos develops as they collaborate with actual game devs (meaning they get real-world testing of the spec). And again, a lot more companies are invested in it this time. It's not purely a Valve effort.  Whether or not it comes out in 2015 I'll leave up in the air."

To enable it, right click on The Talos Principle in your Steam Library, then click on Properties / Set Launch Options, and add the following parameter: +vr 1 - Added support for the newest ATI GPUs.  Gameplay/visual improvements: - Improved behavior of wide plasma walls: players will no longer be pushed to the original point of entry, and touch effects should sound more natural. - Improved the appearance of soft shadows on vegetation. - Added support for viewer-facing cloud particles, which should look more natural. - Deliberate glitching will no longer occur while player is using a terminal.  Bug fixes: - Fixed several cases where connectors would lose their connections when using time recorder. - Fixed SSAO artifacts on certain resolutions and buffer scales. - Fixed an issue causing some crumbs to be rendered black (e.g. black grass). - Fixed artifacts along object edges lit by fast lights when using MSAA. - Shader caching and texture loading progress screen will now render correctly on triple screen setups.  Optimizations: - Major overhaul of crumbs rendering. There should be a noticable increase in performance on lower-end PCs. - Optimized visibility system for distant lights, which improves performance on lower-end CPUs. - Improved performance of plasma wall rendering on ATI cards.    http://steamcommunity.com/app/257510/discussions/0/537402115072603830/  Edit:  /u/haagch where are you?

linux_gaming,3cigx2,shmerl,41,Wed Jul 8 04:06:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with Linus and I still think what Valve is doing is awesome. It's not about turning Linux into the The New Gaming Platform™, it's about establishing it as a play-able platform at all. If Valve were to go all in and try to turn Linux into the primary gaming platform there's a good chance they'd fail. And that would be a real problem because it would discourage anybody from trying to support Linux at all.  Taking this slow and steady approach seems much more healthy. And I can totally see why Valve would want to counterbalance Microsoft, especially with their recent quest to make Windows 10 the next big OS on and for everything.  All that being said one should not oversee that this also means that Valve's commitment to Linux may not be a permanent thing. They could probably still afford to drop Linux support from one day to the next (albeit the shitstorm would be glorious). I think the Linux community really has to do their part in making this whole thing worth it in the long run."

I'm using Ubuntu Gnome because I love the workflow and how customizable Linux is. I'm not using Linux because I'm 100% FOSS (but I prefer open source in important components like my OS). So I wish that some commercial programs will be ported to Linux, or that they at least get a official wine port. The Snappy format suits this purpose much better than the shared library system. Said this in /r/linux and got this answer. Sometimes I have the feeling that we need a other subreddit for Linux user who aren't devs or IT guys."

I fit in the ""devs or IT guys"" label you mentioned and I do complicated stuff with my systems but I understand your point: Linux is about choice, wether you like a straightforward effortless interface, a custom tailored gentoo build or anything in between. I think it's wrong to hate Ubuntu because it makes using Linux easy, but most people hate it because of the controversial feature like the search-bar-sends-stuff-online problems which are real, scary problems."

linux_gaming,3cigx2,gandalfx,17,Wed Jul 8 12:18:51 2015 UTC,"No hate here, but I think you need to put yourself in the other guy's position as well. He has a very valid point when he says that one of the reasons why Linux is currently far superior to Windows when it comes to security and stability is because of shared libraries.  Using Linux has traditionally required more technical insight and as a result, users tended to favour tools that may be a little more complicated for the benefit of more security and stability. You cannot blame them for that, it's the reason why Linux is so good. It is also the one and only reason why Linux is so customizable, which you seem to consider an advantage. Ubuntu has been slowly chipping away at these advantages and mindset and the traditional Linux user obviously doesn't agree with that.  Turning Linux into something that is both beginner friendly as well as stable & secure is a difficult process, it may not even be possible. Attempting to do so involves both technical challenges and ideology changes. I think this process is already well under way, as evidenced by the growing gap between “simple” distros like Ubuntu and “hardcore” distros like Arch Linux.  You may have noticed I write “beginner” instead of “normal”, because I too have the mindset of an IT guy. I share the opinion of many traditional Linux users, that you never just are a normal user, but rather somebody who just hasn't learned much yet. There is no blame in that! It just indicates that we tend to (often falsely) assume people will want learn and find their way deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. There are distros for pretty much every skill level and I feel it's quite natural to start at the easiest and then make your way along at whatever speed you want and however far you think makes sense for you.  Ubuntu is currently on it's way to becoming as beginner friendly as possible. In the eyes of an advanced user that makes it inferior, and rightly so. If you already have the abilities to use advanced features and thus get superior results, why wouldn't you want to use them? Taking those away means that advanced users lose what they value most and currently that means they have to move on to different distros. Don't expect them to leave their /home without a sneer and some cussing.  And now I have written a whole lot of words that have barely anything to do with the original topic of this thread."

If you guys are interested I write later a detailed explanation why I think that the shared library system has its flaws and why I responded to this guy, in that way. For now I have some housework to do and I'm browsing in reddit already for too long :P"
linux_gaming,3cigx2,Leerdeck,9,Wed Jul 8 12:27:23 2015 UTC,"the shared library system has many flaws, but the new containerized system (which I never saw applied to desktop applications for now) popularized by Docker also has many flaws, I think the ideal is a package manager with a decent build system and a good shared library system which supports multiple versions of libraries but also creating and running containers, so you can have the best of both worlds."

You want a keyboard and mouse for shooters, I'm continuously stunned at how awful shooters are with any other controller setup [1], and at how widespread shooters are on consoles despite the controller utterly sucking for that genre.  I'd say for around 80% of gaming keyboard and mouse is clearly the optimum control setup so far.  But fighting games really do work vastly better with a controller.  Likewise many games engineered with a controller in mind.  You can play the original Zelda using a keyboard on your emulator, but you'll be happier with a controller.  Most platformers also like controllers more than keyboard.

linux_gaming,3cmvka,itwurx4me,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"I have a dedicated Windows box I stream from sitting in my living room, sitting beside my Ubuntu box.  It runs win7, and I keep the steam client open and running.  Both boxes connect to my receiver via HDMI, thence the flatscreen TV.  HDMI 1 is my Ubuntu box, HDMI 2 is Windows.  I switch between the two with the receiver's remote control as needed.  Both boxes are connected to the house router.  Each Steam client finds the other one automatically.  I use Steam on my Linux box, but the games on both boxes are listed and available in my Library.  When I want to play a game stored on my Windows box, I merely select the Stream option presented for that game where normally I would press Play; Steam does the rest.  The game starts on the Windows box and streams to my Linux box.  When I quit the game, it quits on the Windows box.  It's not always perfect.  There are usually some graphical adjustments to make in the case of more graphically demanding games, and in at least one game (Gas Guzzlers Extreme) a controller connected to the Linux box isn't detected by the streamed game.  Sometimes the thing just crashes.  Hope that answers your question."

Put a shortcut to it in the startup folder Once steam is installed, steam streaming will launch the games for you RDP into it occasionally and install updates"

linux_gaming,3cmvka,gandolffan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:11:50 2015 UTC,"For WoL, you could add a non-steam ""game"" which is actually a script to send the magic packet. If the Windows game server is left logged into Steam, it should reconnect.  For auto-sleep, I'd look for an external process run by Steam to facilitate the streaming. Not sure if it works like that, but otherwise you wouldn't be able to reliably do it. You could monitor system load or network traffic, but that could be unreliable.  If that fails, it'd be back to the non-steam ""game"" to command the Windows machine to sleep. For a home-use version of Windows, this would require some small server program, but I don't know of anything that currently exists to control a system remotely like that."

linux_gaming,3ci6n5,FlukyS,7,Wed Jul 8 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand what exactly AMDGPU is. Obviously it's a new driver core (emphasis on core, as I believe it doesn't support the catalyst GUI?) but why is it part of the Linux kernel?"
linux_gaming,3ci6n5,58592825866,30,Wed Jul 8 05:18:54 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand what exactly AMDGPU is.   Ok I'll try to explain it a bit in ELI5 manner.  First of all AMDGPU is common name for all parts of new open source driver stack: kernel driver, XServer DDX driver as well as LLVM shader compiler backend. In this article they talk about kernel driver only so don't be confused.  Where that driver come from?  Basically AMDGPU kernel driver is reworked and improved of Radeon kernel driver that supported all ATI / AMD GPUs in past. It's going to support all new hardware, e.g: R9 285, R9 380 (based off 285), R9 Fury.  What is this driver doing?  All basic things needed to make your GPU any useful: initialize device, load firmware, handle power management / hibernation, also manage memory allocations. It's also needed to make sure that userspace can't do anything nasty with GPU so 3D application can become security risk that cause privilege escalation.  Why it's have to be new driver?  Linux kernel interfaces to user space have to be stable, this is strict rule. It's mean that once some feature accessible from userspace programs (everything outside of kernel) implemented in kernel it's cannot break, ever. This give guarantee that even extremely old executable won't be broken by newer kernel.  Year ago AMD announced plans to change how their proprietary drivers work. In past all components of the driver was proprietary: kernel driver, XServer DDX driver (user space) and OpenGL/CL/etc implementation. With new strategy they want to only leave OpenGL/CL/etc implementation proprietary.  Of course there is already open source driver called Radeon, but it's was only designed to work with open source graphics stack and likely there was many small things developers may want to change. So they needed new kernel driver that will suit new hardware and both user space implementations better.  At this point you need to know that Linux kernel have strict policies on what going to be merged into mainline kernel. Basically any code that included in mainline kernel must have open source user space implementations that using it. So GPU vendor like AMD can't just create some kernel driver that will only support blob OpenGL/CL in userspace as it's will never be merged. You can read more on that in Dave Airlie blog post.  So they created AMDGPU that currently can only be used with open source stack, but in future you'll able to use proprietary components on top of that driver."
linux_gaming,3ci6n5,SxxxX,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:32:09 2015 UTC,good question. I too want to know why. from article it seems it is mostly header files. perhaps it's for low level access to registers that AMD drivers both open and closed can access.
linux_gaming,3ci6n5,choikwa,3,Wed Jul 8 05:24:08 2015 UTC,If you want to understand how Linux GPU driver subsystem work start with this paper:  http://people.freedesktop.org/~marcheu/linuxgraphicsdrivers.pdf  Also simplified charts:   http://blogs.igalia.com/itoral/2014/07/29/a-brief-introduction-to-the-linux-graphics-stack/

linux_gaming,3ci6n5,choikwa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:50:51 2015 UTC,Because you need the kernel to be able to communicate with the hardware. this has nothing to do with the drivers in the userspace.
linux_gaming,3ci6n5,gandolffan,-5,Wed Jul 8 06:29:39 2015 UTC,Then who cares at this point? No sense getting a bunch of gamers excited about this when it means positively nothing right now. Wake us up when we can actually game on an AMD GPU.
linux_gaming,3ci6n5,DaVince,6,Wed Jul 8 06:44:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it nothing. This makes the entire stack more reliable. From here on out:   There will be no more GPUs where support is suddenly dropped. There will be no more new kernels that the driver isn't supported on yet. (This has to do with their old kernel driver using DKMS, which means that it could only be supported in the kernel versions that AMD supported. This made GPU support for newer kernels lag, or sometimes even dropped.) The code is also out in the open, so it can be improved by any skilled enough developer. Not just that, but now we don't have two groups working on separate kernel drivers - we got these two groups working on the same code, unifying their efforts. That leaves extra time to work on other things, like better/faster graphics drivers on top of this."
linux_gaming,3ci6n5,gandolffan,2,Wed Jul 8 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, then. Would have been nice if any of this was articulated by the OP or the article. Thank you for explaining it. Hopefully AMD will be a viable option for GPUs in the future, if not the better option due to this."

We should be happy we got one company turning around and making an open source implementation (people running catalyst will no longer need to wait for amd to issue another update for the kernel or xorg version).  AMD has also stated that for desktop use they want to push the radeonsi driver (open source driver) and leave the workstation  cards to catalyst (they're probably doing this because I'm assuming radeon and firepro cards just like Nvidia are very similar hardware wise and the software is what does the work). We are going to see improvements (hopefully) with Mesa."

First they created a Windows app. Next some people got it running under Wine. Then they changed the app to work better under Wine and officially supported using their app under Wine. Now the next version of the app is being re-written using Unity and will be a native port for Linux as well as Windows."

linux_gaming,3ci8ec,SxxxX,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:50:39 2015 UTC,SteamOS users aren't locked down to using the controller.

linux_gaming,3cfiss,YanderMan,11,Tue Jul 7 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"Biggest problem with playing PC games on a TV is not the controller, but the UI. Squinting at my TV to read small text is not great when you are in a multiplayer online game and there is vital information onscreen. However, with the amount of console games getting ported to the PC and PC games being designed to be ported, this issue was not frequent.   It definitely is the biggest problem with the ten-foot experience Valve is trying to embrace. I disagree about frequency; I run into this constantly, even with games that have full controllers support built in already, and it's super annoying. Sometimes it can be fixed by lowering the resolution, but that's a price we shouldn't have to pay. I hope Valve can convince devs that it's important to be able to read the text and see the UI elements, because without that, Steam Machines will be forever handicapped compared to the console competition."
linux_gaming,3cfiss,adolson,4,Tue Jul 7 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ideally Valve would push for a global (steam integrated) option for UI size. As it is now, I fear devs might in the future make the UI bigger for the Linux version in general, but that doesn’t go too well with normal Desktop use.   Generally curious how many “console-isms”, good or bad, are going to make their way to Linux once the majority of Linux users sits in the living room."
linux_gaming,3cfiss,KarKraKr,6,Tue Jul 7 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Devs have already needed to take UI size into account when making games 4K-compatible.  The best games I've seen have sliders for UI size, which is great.  If that size heeds some global OS UI size setting, that'd be even better.  Freedesktop.org UI size standards should be a thing!"
linux_gaming,3cfiss,Swiftpaw22,4,Tue Jul 7 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"That last part is something I'm worried about. Say steam OS does really well, and then the next elder scrolls gets released on steam OS, and doesn't have mod support. Then the windows version would and Linux version wouldn't. Of course if steam os takes off and gets a bunch of games on Linux and a bunch of pc gamers move to Linux then Bethesda would probably allow mod support but it's still something to be wary of."
linux_gaming,3cfiss,ImDerrickTheCat,8,Tue Jul 7 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"That specifically isn’t something you have to be worried about. Mods aren’t on consoles not because console users don’t want them but because the owners of those locked down platforms don’t want you to execute random code. Bethesda even managed to get mods onto the xboner (or rather microsoft allowed it) and modding gets easier and easier with things like steam workshop, that’s certainly something steam OS users in the living room will want to have. Things like split screen gaming might sometimes even make it into the Linux versions but not into the Windows versions, to name something positive.  I can however see many devs not giving a fuck about multiple desktops/monitors, alt tabbing, keyboard/mouse input, said UI size with no way to configure it and so on, things you don’t really need on a console."

One recent example for me: the text in NEON STRUCT was basically right on the borderline - small, but I made it through the game.  What I do is post on the Steam forums or send the devs a tweet or email with a request for scalable UI or at least a second option for tenfoot experience.

The new keyboard is a standard qwerty layout. You can see it in the Steam controller marketing video, it looks like they are taking advantage of the trackpads to let you control 2 cursors over the keyboard. It's possible that the author didn't have this update and the pinwheel keyboard wasn't ready for the controller yet."

linux_gaming,3cfiss,curtis_galaxy,3,Tue Jul 7 18:57:26 2015 UTC,I believe to map the controls you need to be running Steam in big picture mode. I don't see the problem with adding your gog game to the your steam library and configuring it from there.

linux_gaming,3cfiss,flaxknuckles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"In addition, Valve has allowed for hybridization of controller and keyboard setups. So if you want to play Borderlands 2 with the ease of a controller but the precision of a mouse, you can do that. Or say you were playing a game like Batman: Arkham Knight, and you like how it plays with a controller but want to assign a certain gadget item to a button not on an Xbox controller: you can do that, and the game will retain the UI and ease of using it like an Xbox controller.   How does this work? Does it literally act as a keyboard+mouse+controller all at once? Because loads of games lock to either/or, or at the very least if you use one device all the on-screen icons change over to the device you're using, so you'd constantly have flashing keyboard/mouse and controller icons."

DE:HR is probably a rare exception in this way, but ideally new games will start to support the Steam controller directly anyway.

There's a good chance that its price/performance ratio isn't very good. You might want to consider spending a bit more on a 960. That's my thoughts on the card anyway. Not that it's a bad card, but it might not be the most cost-effective option.   Nvidia is generally a safe bet on Linux. They're well-known for their adequate proprietary drivers. Though I believe the open source drivers are considered even worse than both AMD open source and proprietary drivers, and AMD drivers are already renowned for their bad OpenGL support. But as long as you go with proprietary drivers and don't want to mess with things like GPU pass through (which is really complex and rarely used), Nvidia is generally fine."

AFAIK there's nothing preventing OpenGL drivers from being at least as performant as Direct3D drivers. From what we hear, nvidia's implementation has particularly good performance:  http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/   That the Linux version runs faster than the Windows version (270.6) seems a little counter-intuitive, given the greater amount of time we have spent on the Windows version. However, it does speak to the underlying efficiency of the kernel and OpenGL."
linux_gaming,3cf53s,haagch,7,Tue Jul 7 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that they likely don't have the in-house engineering to make a proper GL renderer (they already had a lot of trouble with the development of their in-house engines -FFXIV is completely on-topic in this regard-) and they likely tried their native test version against one of the most underperforming GL implementation on the market, that is Apple's.   Which is why I believe the problem isn't OpenGL itself like Yoshida stated, rather, OpenGL used by console/D3D centric devs on Mac."
linux_gaming,3cf53s,DarkeoX,2,Tue Jul 7 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, drivers that are on Mac are developed by Apple, they are not vendor provided AFAIK"
linux_gaming,3cf53s,totallyblasted,6,Tue Jul 7 15:34:49 2015 UTC,This isn't particularly true. OpenGL implementation on OS X is somehow like Microsoft Direct3D on Windows. E.g only Apple determine what OpenGL features exposed and they provide some layers between application and vendor driver as well as do conformance testing.  Though under the hood there is proprietary Nvidia / AMD and Intel drivers. So they have about the same shader compiler and libraries as for any other OS. Unfortunately some optimizations are impossible to implement because of it.
linux_gaming,3cf53s,SxxxX,2,Tue Jul 7 13:55:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarification, although if what you say is true, this gets me wondering why they would be stuck at 4.1 (or is it 2?)  Not Mac person my self."

They stuck because it's still only Apple can decide what APIs to expose. I think reason of that slow adoption is conformance testing they do on their own. On OS X drivers are built-in so end-user can't update them. So basically drivers only updated with new OS X version release. And because of that there is reason to do in-home conformance testing.  On Windows and Linux when Nvidia or AMD release drivers with latest GL support (especially Nvidia with their same-day support) it's usually more like marketing bullshit rather than real support. Reason for this is fact that early extension implementation is full of bugs that sometimes cause graphical glitches or application crashes. On Windows and Linux those just fixed with driver updates once some developer find and report them, but on OS X it's impossible. So Apple have their own reason to go this way."
linux_gaming,3cf53s,SxxxX,5,Tue Jul 7 14:22:38 2015 UTC,Does OpenGL really have worse performance than DirectX?    OpenGL really have worse performance on OS X and anyone can check it using Unigine benchmarks. Just run it on Windows and OS X on same hardware.  PS: In case of AMD or Nvidia proprietary drivers there won't be real OpenGL performance difference between Windows and Linux.
linux_gaming,3cf53s,SxxxX,5,Tue Jul 7 14:38:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, but that's not really an OpenGL problem then, is it? You're changing more than one variable and then just deciding all by yourself which change is causing the problem. That doesn't make sense. Run OpenGL on Windows or Linux on the same hardware, and you won't get those performance losses. Therefore the problem is clearly OSX."

Do developers and publishers over there really only look at how much money they can make locally and then apply that to the rest of the world?   As I said, SE must have conducted a worldwide study, it wouldn't make any sense for them to extrapolate Japan numbers since they perfectly know Japan gaming landscape doesn't reflect the rest of the world and significantly differs sometime.

By buying every single available game regardless of genre, and in multiple copies at once? The situation with Linux games already showed us that petitions and other non-monetary means of voicing one's opinion aren't being taken seriously, only voting with the dollar does. In light of this, counting the demand by existing financial statistic is a vicious circle: people don't buy a lot of games for Mac because there are but a few, and there are but a few because people don't buy a lot."

linux_gaming,3cetgo,uoou,5,Tue Jul 7 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"Since you're a decent/experienced player, I have a question about CS which is nothing to do with your post. Hope that's ok...?  I'm pretty new to CS:GO (used to play 1.x back in the day but that was a long time ago). I'm played a fair bit of casual and I'm ok at it.  But if I go into competitive, it's basically a whole different game in that it's 5v5 and, while knowing the maps and just knowing how to shoot etc. are helpful, it's much more about reading the situation, knowing what the enemy is up to and knowing what your team expects you to do in a given situation.  So when I join a competitive game I'm... pretty shit. And end up just ruining my team's game because I don't really know what I'm doing. Some people are ok with noobs joining and will be helpful and tell you what to do and why but most just get pissed off (somewhat understandably).  So... how are you supposed to transition from casual to competitive? I can't learn how to play competitive without playing competitive."
linux_gaming,3cetgo,uoou,7,Tue Jul 7 11:05:13 2015 UTC,"how I approached this problem: I simply didn't care about people getting pissed off at me for being a noob, I have as much right to playing the game as they have. Just do a shitload of competitives (without caring about rank, too). Eventually though, when you get good better, turn the favor back and help noobs ;)   EDIT: also sometimes I played on faceit.com - being a silver this gave me opportunity to play with players much better than me. I don't do it alot (because I get rekt), but sometimes its very useful to step up your game... at least you see how you should play the game, game sense, team work etc., which is stuff you don't see at all in silver"

Casual just teaches you bad habits, I suggest playing first valve dm, and when you feel you have decent aim (like when you are  DMG or you are MG ranks) you should move on too community FFA.  You can only get better in two ways, play a lot of comp and DM alot.   it's much more about reading the situation, knowing what the enemy is up to and knowing what your team expects you to do in a given situation.   Your team is going to flame you for no reason at all. Most of the times you should just mute them. Do you have a mic? You need to have a mic in order to communicate with your team and call out everything.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCK6zZBbtdI  Do as friberg did to practice his spray control.

linux_gaming,3cetgo,Manypopes,4,Tue Jul 7 11:17:56 2015 UTC,Most of the times in comp its mostly about who has the best position or aim.

The solution to this is just start thinking more.

linux_gaming,3cega6,Iksf,3,Tue Jul 7 11:16:56 2015 UTC,"Probably worth mentioning what you play more specifically. Steam has loads of good linux games. Most of the Blizzard stuff works flawlessly under wine bar a performance hit.  As you mentioned PlayOnLinux I shall recycle and compress my usual rant about it: PlayOnLinux is just wine with premade profiles. These profiles are often out of date and particularly call out of date versions of wine. Equally a lot of the decisions people made for their POL profiles may be relevant to different software or hardware to what you have. For these reasons I prefer to just use wine proper and actually play with the settings, I get the latest wine version and get to actually get the maximum performance  / absence of bugs. PlayOnLinux wins on ease of use and being quick to setup but if you really want to get the best experience with some particular application set it up yourself.  The ultimate answer to this is pci passthrough with KVM. That lets you run a copy of windows in virtualisation and the pci passthrough allows windows full use of the GPU. This allows you to mix linux and windows applications on the screen both running at full functionality (this method with KVM is often considered over 98% of native performance). Unfortunately this requires 2 GPU's and vt-d support in the CPU and motherboard (the motherboard support specifically is scarce on consumer motherboards, ASRock FTW). Also it's pretty technical to set up.   Another point is desktop environment and window manager. This is subject to personal experiences but KWin benchmarks better performance on games than the other composited window managers as I remember. Also KDE has the least issues with things like tabbing in and out in my experience (note I use GNOME so this isnt rabid KDE fanboyism just objective observations). Non-composited XFCE and the *box's are nice for gaming. Last I tried with MATE it had loads of issues with tabbing in and out. /shrug, this stuff changes too often to keep up with.   Also worth mentioning that even if a game has issues with alt-tab sometimes it will work fine if you put it on a virtual desktop then switch to that desktop through hotkeys. An alternate solution which guarentees maximum performance and ensures you can switch in and out of the game is running it on another X server session to your main desktop. Again getting more complicated there tho."

So I have checked out steamDB and the majority of games I am activity playing at the moment seem to be support (in some fashion) for linux which a bonus.  Im currently play Cities Skylines, Wildstar (which the subbreddit there has a good fix with wine) and a few others.  I cant see GTA V and I am unsure on FIFA and Battlefield 4 but maybe, as you said about wine, tweaking it until it performs decently.  I never thought about Visualization and KVM seems like a good alternative if a game cannot run on wine but I only have 1 GPU so maybe something to look out for the future.  I guess keeping a dual boot of windows and Linux (still unsure what flavor I want :/) might be the way forward until more games are support by linux / wine."

In my case, I decided to  dual boot Linux Mint with Windows 8.1 (the 90-day trial, which can be extended to 270 days). Whenever any game I'm interested in becomes supported on Linux (either natively or via Wine/POL), I install it on my Linux partition. At this point, only 2 games keep my Windows partition alive (Dragon Age: Inquisition and Witcher 3). My other favourite games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, DA:2, Portal 1&2, Witcher 1&2, Dishonored, plenty of indie games) work just fine in Linux.

linux_gaming,3cega6,ramrunner800,2,Tue Jul 7 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"Hi  I think the switch depends on your preferences. I have a Steam Library with 175 Games, but only 76 have a Linux port. But the think is many of this games are old and I wouldn't play them anymore. As example I have Deus Ex: HR but I finished it twice years ago. If you are not sure which of your games have Linux port you could use SteamDB. Connect it with your steam account and check ""show owned games""  Then there is the Wine Layer. There are, windows only games (Hearthstone + HotS) that I absolutely love and wine works most of the time. You may have a little bit lesser performance because of the real time translation from directX to openGL, but many games are playable. For Video Games I wouldn't use Vanilla Wine, instead you should use a wineprefix manager like PlayonLinux or Crossover. PlayonLinux is more ""hacking"" and tweaking for every game. People often install each game in it's own Wineprefix. The downfall of that is that you have to install steam for every game. (New Wineprefix = new fake C:/ drive)  Crossover is a commercial product that does the same job but does some things a little bit different. I prefer it because I have customer support and the GUI is much simpler. Installing Games is much more a no-brainer than it is under PoL. (my opinion) And I can install all my windows only games in my one single steam wineprefix. I'm lazy ;-) The downfall from Crossover is that they have a older wine version, but this version is pretty stable. PoL is using most of the time wine versions of the developer branch. So sometimes thinks can break but you can get a performance boost too.  Both things are better than just simple Vanilla wine, at least for a beginner. I would test both. You can try Crossover for 15 days. One year support with access to the newest versions costs 40$, I think. Test both and look what suits you best."
linux_gaming,3cega6,SxxxX,2,Tue Jul 7 09:33:06 2015 UTC,"CS major here. I started using Linux during my Sophomore year in college for coding as I found GCC more comfortable. I started with just my school laptop, now Linux is my main OS on all my systems.  However I am a game nut. Currently I have a dual boot setup on my system, so I can switch between Linux and Windows. I also have a second computer, like a file-server, that runs Linux that mirrors my home directory, so I can still work on a personally setup Linux machine (through ssh, or remote X) when in Windows.  I absolutely hate this setup. Once I am out of school and can afford it, I will have a dedicated Windows gaming system, and a dedicated work system. But what I did find my temporary setup better than; I've been up and down Wine and PlayOnLinux... all I can really say is expect an exponential amount of setup time getting your games running on Wine in linux.  I suppose it all depends on your dedication and tolerance, and your curiosity towards getting things working. But honestly, as long as I have games that I want to play that won't work in Linux somehow, I am always going to want a Windows installation somewhere.  If ever a time comes where there are no games I want to play in Windows, I'll do away with it. I hope that happens. But I have over 500+ games in my Steam library alone, less than 10% are Linux Native. I don't really see it happening at all."

Technically there is really small overhead on CPU performance so you get like 95-98% and GPU don't have any overhead at all. Unfortunately virtualization for Windows in particular isn't perfect at least in older QEMU versions that available by default in Ubuntu 14.04 and such.  Anyway I play quite a lot of games including new titles and there was only one game affected by VM which is PlanetSide 2 (and which I play the most). I basically had two problems with it:   First of all I had to use USB mouse emulation because with default QEMU's PS/2 mouse and keyboard game start lagging like hell. This is funny one because there was some input issue in PlanetSide 2 when running in Wine too.  -device usb-kbd -device usb-mouse Then I had quite huge CPU-bottleneck due to QEMU (Like 30-40% FPS loss). End up fixing it by using Hyper-V additions that only supported on Windows guests and improve some CPU-related quirks:  -cpu host,hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff,hv_time,hv_vapic   Though as I said no other games suffer from VM at all."

I don't have such a setup myself, so I can't speak from experience. A VM without hardware pass through (such as your average VMware or VirtualBox setup) will only work for a select few (mostly older) games.   A proper hardware pass through setup with something like Qemu or Xen seems tricky. You need the right hardware (Intel's K series of CPUs don't support it, but non-K CPUs do), and regular Nvidia graphics cards don't support them either (meaning you need to either buy AMD, a Quadro or other Nvidia professional card, or modify a regular Nvidia, after which it will more or less think it's a professional card). I believe you need two GPUs. One for the host, and one for the guest. And even then I'm not sure if it's guaranteed to work.

Often the game takes ~3 minutes to raise the main menu's framerate above 5 fps. Occasional stuttering. But ultimately it's playable, with those few hitches. Native ports are much better, but if this is how I can enjoy older AAA titles on Linux, I'm happy with it."

Single action button for everything from taking cover to scratching your ass, but never the action you want right at the moment you hit the action key? Check. Forced cutscenes played for the umpteenth time after you failed some broken fight sequence? Check.  And a bonus, now on Linux: stutters every time something new loads due to running in a wrapper? Check."
linux_gaming,3cbjww,stqn1,11,Mon Jul 6 20:52:07 2015 UTC,"There was a good series of videos on Extra Credits discussing the game's appeal, but in short: even people who like the game agree that it's not exactly ""fun.""  Spec Ops: The Line is a deconstruction of games like Call of Duty and Medal of Honor. The fact that the combat is bland and repetitive is very much intentional -- it ultimately supports the story and the game's (very, very harsh) critique of the genre it's in. I know how that sounds, but I swear: I played this game to the end and came away totally satisfied. They knew exactly what they were doing.  I'm not saying that you'd necessarily enjoy the game if you played it through. There are a lot of people who just don't like this kind of game, which is totally fine. For those of us that are into it, though, it was very exciting to see a game like this with AAA production values -- for obvious reasons, games like Spec Ops are very hard to market, so you usually don't see them except as low-budget indie titles."

linux_gaming,3cey4c,Blaxar,5,Tue Jul 7 11:33:28 2015 UTC,I've never been asked to do a Steam Survey on Linux. Used to get them all the time when I used Windows for gaming.  The day Steam was first released for Linux I stopped using Windows. My computers are exclusively Linux. Not. One. Single. Survey. On. Linux since I switched.

No one knows !"
linux_gaming,3cey4c,byperoux,3,Tue Jul 7 11:59:29 2015 UTC,"Steam appears to prompt you with a survey with a higher probability if you change your system, say, if you switch from Windows to Linux or vice versa. However, the only evidence for this is anecdotal."
linux_gaming,3cey4c,alkazar82,2,Tue Jul 7 12:19:54 2015 UTC,"This reasoning makes sense, I was thinking the same thing, but this would imply being prompted for a survey once you switch back to Linux, which sadly isn't the case.  Funny enough, trying to run the Windows version of Steam with Wine often prompts the survey if I recall correctly."
linux_gaming,3cey4c,alkazar82,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've seen the survey several times when running steam in wine after a long hiatus. I also saw the survey when switching from Ubuntu to Arch. The length of time passed since the last survey prompt also has to be a factor."
linux_gaming,3cey4c,scaine,2,Tue Jul 7 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"p.s. bad idea to a) buy a game that isn't available on Linux and b) later install Windows to play it - your money has now supported Windows as a gaming platform, not Linux.

linux_gaming,3cey4c,Uradamus,4,Tue Jul 7 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"I get it about once a year through the Linux client. I also get it a few times a year through the Windows client in Wine.  Without the stats giving an overall number of users surveyed per month, the percentages mean very little. Valve obviously have more info than they share making those numbers useful to them, but not so much for us.  The number of Linux users each month could be growing at a perfectly healthy rate, but if Windows and/or Mac are growing even faster, then that would cause Linux to look like it was shrinking instead of growing since the values are relative.  Steam had just over 100 million active accounts with at least one purchased game back in September, that number jumped to over 125 million in February, at this point they are probably nearing or above 150 million. With that kind of insane growth there is no way that Linux could possibly be staying even close to the same general percentage of the Steam user pool month after month without growing proportionally to the Steam community in general."

I'm experimenting to see if doing the survey in windows now, rather than closing it off, will get it to offer me in Linux too.

A lot of games even today could probably play just fine on 1-2 Mbps download connections. I still remember playing games like EQ on dial-up just a bit over a decade ago, was able to raid just fine.

linux_gaming,3cey4c,Winsaucerer,2,Tue Jul 7 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"Only if my memory recall is quite poor.  That is, you think I have had the survey in Linux one or more times in the last 12 months, and just forget about it.  I deny that I have forgotten.  My experience has been as follows: months of using steam in Linux, gaming in Linux, and no survey.  Load up windows and boom, survey pops straight up.  Despite having had steam in Linux open just an hour earlier.  Repeat.  I have held this opinion, and it has since been confirmed through repeated instances.  Another explanation is pure luck.  If it's random whether or not you get the survey, and which operating system it's in, then there's bound to be some exceptionally rare people who get it always and only when they boot up windows, despite being in Linux most of the time (gaming).  This second hypothesis is significantly weakened when you get enough people claiming the same experience."

linux_gaming,3cacg9,Raymi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:29:37 2015 UTC,"2 reasons:  1: there are many levels in this game (60+) and quite a lot of music (5 layers of about 2min x 13) at a faily high audio quality. This takes up a lot of data  2: With download speeds what they are these days I didn't feel the to compress beyond 300mb as this slows loading time in game (brutally compressed pngs take longer to load it seems)  The delux edition (available on steam when greenlit and free to those who buy it now on itch) will be submitted to an compression/efficiency overhaul. But as there will be many more levels, co-op vs modes and music i doubt it will ever be a smaller file.  Thank you for your feedback, its a very valuable thing to a new indie-dev."
linux_gaming,3cacg9,lsbe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:58:48 2015 UTC,"I wonder how you store your levels. Even 60 levels shouldn't occupy more than a megabyte per level. It's not that your graphics are hard to compress either. I'm also not sure how you store your music but 26 minutes of music compressed with a reasonable codec shouldn't be more than a few megabytes. After all, games like Super Mario 64 (which contains way more content than your game) were shipped on 8 MB cartridges. I just can't wrap my mind around how you need such an incredible amount of memory for this."

linux_gaming,3cb98v,Mneumonicxx,8,Tue Jul 7 07:13:01 2015 UTC,I used to have an Asus Radeon R9 280X. I used the open source drivers from the OIBAF repo for roughly a year. My primary game is Dota 2 and I couldn't get above 40 FPS on average (1920x1200 even with some graphics options turned down). Catalyst was faster but it would crash. I really like open source so I waited a long time to make it work but it never go me the 60 FPS I desired so I got an EVGA Geforce 960 GTX SC the same week they came out. I'm using Nvidia proprietary drivers and the performance is amazing (1920x1200 everything maxed out including AA). I forget that I am using Linux now when I am playing Dota 2. Its a little sad because the R9 280X is a faster card than the 960 GTX.  I do plan to switch back to Radeon once the open source drivers can give me the performance I require. I do not regret my purchase at all.
linux_gaming,3cb98v,psycho_driver,8,Mon Jul 6 16:08:38 2015 UTC,I have been using a GTX 960 for a few months.  You have to use NVIDIA 346 or newer driver and it runs beautifully.  I play a lot of games and have not had a single issue with a game working with the GTX 960.

Any performance disparities or glitches were down to the actual game itself; stuff like Bioshock Infinite ran equally well under both conditions!  In short, you'll be totally fine if you opt for a GTX960 on Linux (although you may want to spring for a 4GB version and avoid making the same mistake that I did when I got the 2GB version)."
linux_gaming,3cb98v,TuffActinTinactin,3,Mon Jul 6 18:32:49 2015 UTC,I could only afford the 2GB version unfortunately. As far as I know there are only a few windows games like GTA V that could easily go above 2GB VRAM usage.
linux_gaming,3cb98v,Fiftybottles,2,Mon Jul 6 20:17:37 2015 UTC,"I wanted something a bit more future-proof but I totally understand! Generally speaking if the game is optimized well it shouldn't be an issue; Witcher 3 has some of the most impressive textures I've seen, it's an open world game, and not even it needs more than 2GB.

linux_gaming,3cb98v,TuffActinTinactin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"Out of interest why would the 4GB version be a mistake? My understanding was that 2GB was plenty if you were gaming at 1080p. It's only if you were gaming at say, 1440p or higher that the 4GB capacity might get used, and even then the 960 GPU would give you a fairly poor fps at those resolutions anyway."
linux_gaming,3cb98v,Sound-Sama,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"There are a few games that have been coming out this year that have been going over the 2GB rendering budget and into 3GB territory (GTA5, Shadow of Mordor, Titanfall, etc.), however mostly that can probably be chalked up to poor texture streaming issues.  People with 2GB cards have reported very little stuttering in all these games with the settings maxed, and I can attest to this being the case, however given that we're already seeing games make significant use of 3GB and greater cards it's more for future-proofing things; since consoles have pooled memory they can theoretically get better texturing than someone with a 2GB card down the road, and it would be disappointing to be beaten out by a PS4 when you're already investing in a PC."
linux_gaming,3cb98v,DryEagle,3,Tue Jul 7 03:33:17 2015 UTC,the GTX 960 performs a smidgin above a GTX 760 but uses less power (only requires a 400 watt power supply) & is newer so it will probably be supported for longer.  Legend of Grimrock has a bug that probably won't be fixed that makes it unplayable on the 900 series cards so be warned about that one game.  Looks like they fixed it

You just need to enable it, which you can do following the instructions provided on the Arch wiki. You will have a ChromeOS warning screen when you start up, but it will be easy for the system to recover if you mess something up your first time around.  You also don't have to use Arch, that link just gets you to SeaBIOS, where you can boot up any live disk of your distribution of choice. Most people go with Ubuntu, however the C720P base model comes with only 2GB of RAM, I would personally go with the Ubuntu GNOME instead.   It has good touchscreen support since version 3.14 and you'd probably have the best luck with it on that device. Since you already installed, oh well, if you feel like trying it out that's my suggestion. That laptop has been tried and tested a lot on Linux so there's plenty of places to check for bug fixes, performance bumps, but everything just works with recent packages and kernel versions."

linux_gaming,3ca4l2,koolsup,18,Mon Jul 6 08:09:26 2015 UTC,"To be honest, PS2 emulation is kinda crappy full stop. The PCSX2 emulator took the same path as most other 3D emulators at the time, to abstract most complex stuff like graphics rendering into plugins. So, with an already small team of emu developers fragmented into even smaller plugin developers, it's no surprise that the OpenGL plugin fell to the wayside. Compare this to the Gamecube/Wii emulator Dolphin, that focused on a single implementation and adapted the code to multiple backends.  From what I've seen, the GSDX plugin for PCSX2 has been slowly picking up steam, but I estimate we're still a ways off from Windows parity."

You might instead try the latest Windows version of PCSX2 (maybe even git version) run under a recent version of Wine. It probably won't help with the graphical issues, but it might be quicker on the CPU side, which was supposedly true in the past at least. I can confirm that it works, but haven't benchmarked the two versions. You'll want to run GDSX OGL there too, as we don't have D3D10/11 support just yet.  My main issue with the Linux version of PCSX2 is that it's a pain to maintain.

Last time I looked (tbh that was 5 years ago) PS2 emulation sucked in general and was slow as crap due to the architechture of a PS2 which is very different from an x86 PC.  What you're describing might not necessarily be the renderer, it can also be the shader. OpenGL is very complicated so I wouldn't blame them if sth with their emulation layer is slightly broken. It's already hard enough to write an OpenGL programm which renders just the stuff you wrote. Now imagine writing an OpenGL program that renders stuff someone else did for a totally different platform.  Probably nobody understands the code used for that and therefore it can't be fixed.

Most OpenGL implementations (except Nvidia's) are painfully buggy (see: Linux devs/porters often complaining about these), and most people still use Windows for gaming -> less testing and discovering driver bugs tripped by new emulator features."

The situation with Wine right now has me confused. To wit :  I really like World of Tanks. I have a couple of Windows systems I can play it on, but I'd rather play it on the Linux system, because of some physical constraints associated with the Windows systems.   So I grabbed the Play on Linux front end, and that works great as a way to install and abstract away Wine (aside from stepping on Catalyst over OpenCL, but that's not germane to this discussion). It handles the install of the game, and easily allows reconfiguration of Wine.  Awesome possum.   And WOT works!  But now I want to tweak it and get the best performance possible - and it turns out that the ideal version of Wine is .22-CS with a certain registry key activated. I see ~30 FPS on this setup, which is playable.   But POL lets me try other Wine versions. You've think that the latest would be the best (.45 I think? ) but it only starts the game 33% of the time, and performance is much worse; slower and with occasional rendering glitches.   Now I'm no Wine expert; I just want to play my game. I don't understand how an older version is better than newer versions. That makes no sense to me. It's confusing as an end user.  If I could, I'd bring a Catalyst developer and a Wine developer to my house for a weekend, and have them debug / profile the game so they could identify problems and areas for improvement in each of their domains. I'd get a better gaming experience, and those improved versions of Wine and Catalyst would surely improve other programs that share code paths.

linux_gaming,3c7hfb,Wartz,3,Sun Jul 5 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"Why We Want Native Ports Only   Let me talk as ""we"" but I will remain anonymous, because, you know...    have noticed a very scary drift towards accepting wrapper based ports.   Scary for who ? For consumers who get more games than before?    Working as a developer and also a long term Linux user   Nice, appeal to authority right at the beginning. So, other people who are not developers are clueless? thanks!   I can only believe that it is due to misunderstanding of the processes, restrictions, and licenses that go into porting a game.    How about being actually pragmatic and simply enjoying the games no matter through what technology they come from, as long as they work as expected? Seems like a very reasonable explanation to me that has nothing to do with what you mention at all.    With every port that is not native there can be a damaging effect on OpenGL.   Really, like where? All native engines are using OpenGL anyway. Unity, Unreal Engine, etc. OpenGL is not going to dissappear from the roadmap as long as all the major engine makers support it in the first place. That does not make any sense.    we begin to accept wrappers, translation layers and compatibly layers then developers will only target DirectX and give up on OpenGL support   Really, like in which universe ? We are getting more wrapped games AND more native games at the same time. So I fail to see the scary trend that you are worrying so much about (and that I don't find scary in the first place)   They may find that the game has been re-ported and they no longer “own” the game and have to re-buy the new in-house port.   Wait, what?? Then native porting is actually damaging to consumers! Is this really where you want to go ? :)   As with any non natively ported game. It may even be that the game developer is no longer allowed to sell the game after the license agreement with the translation layer or wrapper company has ran out. This leaves Linux gamers high and dry because they would no longer be able to buy the game. Current gamers may even be denied access to online gaming with other platforms due to the builds becoming out of sync. The developer would have to re-port the game from scratch with a new company.   oh you mean, like out of sync just like Civ5 was out of sync for online multiplayer for a while ? Yet it's a native game. That makes no sense whatsoever. And let's not forget Geometry Wars 3, which did not have an online mode for almost a year or something, while it's a native port. Yet the online mode was implemented finally at a very late stage, but too bad no one is playing the game online anymore. Yeah for native ports, they surely seem to be the answer for EVERYTHING! Seriously, the only point you can make for native port is POTENTIAL higher performance (and not even always the case anyway), POTENTIAL bug fixes (that's if anyone actually cares), the rest is just wild speculation driven by the support of the developers and the porters.   Just let the developers judge for themselves what work best in their own case, instead of forcing your views on everyone else. That's actually what GNU/Linux stands for, Freedom in the first place."

Unity, Unreal Engine, etc. OpenGL is not going to dissappear from the roadmap as long as all the major engine makers support it in the first place.    I think you misunderstand how many game engines do not have OpenGL support and only console and DirectX. Unreal and Unity are not used by many of the AAA companies, GTAV uses RAGE for example. And even those that do have OpenGL support may edit the renderer api so much that the OpenGL code will no longer works.  If there is an easy path that gamers accept such as wrapping ports and it is cheaper than maintaining an OpenGL renderer then financially it makes since to drop OpenGL support. Which is not good for Linux gaming."

Diablo II 1.09 and 1.10 (needed by some mods), and Fallout 1 & 2 for instance.   gta v, alien isolation, hitman: absolution.   I am not interested in  those games. Couldn't care less.   which most of them are indies?   It's irrelevant what or who the games are made by. Only 15 year olds think that ""AAA"" (rofl) games are the end all and be all. Personally, 99% of them are garbage.   AMD drivers are shit   AMD drivers are crap all round, even on Windows. I find the Nvidia drivers to be superior on Linux (my specs below).

Here's my thinking: I'm not going to buy a PS4 to play PS-exclusive titles, I'm not going to buy a XBox for XBox-exclusive titles, and I'm not going to run Windows for Windows-exclusive titles.  I don't get hyped up over any particular title, because I consider Linux availability as a key factor. I don't give a shit about any one particular title or series, and although I do understand the mentality of putting game over platform - I just don't have it. If I can't run a game on my platform of choice, I don't give a shit about that game. Period.   Fortunately, there are -- right now, today -- more Linux titles for me to enjoy that I possibly can get to. I have 195 Linux titles in Steam (just checked), and have probably played slightly over 10% of them. PlayOnLinux works just fine for the one non-native title I like (Hearthstone), and if I can't get it native or in Wine, I just move on to another of the hundreds of games that look interesting to me. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by not playing Halo 6 or Call of Duty 19 or whatever."

Such as Final Fantasy, Hitman, and Resident Evil just to name a few.  I'm not saying Linux doesn't have any games. I'm just saying many if not most of the games  I like are not available on it yet.  Not to mention troubleshooting is much easier on Windows because there are so many people gaming on it.  Which is very important for the average joe.  You could argue Wine and how you could run Windows games and such, but it's not perfect.  There are still bugs and various little thungs to configure which is not a huge deal for me but a game breaker for the average gamer.  Edit: to add to that. I'm not talking about one less.

Amazon EC2 hosts GPU heavy (1500 shader cores) virtual machines in a few data centers in the US already, I can spin one up and install my own operating system in an hour. The only thing really keeping it from being viable is that it's hosted too far away, and the cost isn't quite there yet for personal use.  Once we get latency under about 15 ms, which are believable ping times for something in your same city, I think a lot of applications can be moved to the cloud with no perceivable loss in fidelity, and an overall reduced cost."

I have the impression that the same goes for other people. I'm actually skipping games because they're Windows only and not an absolute must play.

There is a vocal minority of Linux enthusiasts who seems to react pretty thin-skinned at every form of criticism and attack people on Twitter. Angry Comments in the public, aren't very helpful. Many vocal Linux user are power user and haven't the average joe in mind. ""Oh the terminal is super simple."", ""Who needs a GUI for that?"", ""You should use -""insert favorite distro""- instead of Ubuntu ( because he/she doesn't like Ubuntu ). It is much better.""  People aren't using their PCs only for Games. If their favorite tools don't work on Linux, they will not switch. And sometimes there are FOSS smart-asses, who know absolutely nothing about the user and his/her work-flow but regardless they know that he doesn't need this program: ""You don't need ""insert program"", use ""insert FOSS program"" instead!"" I hope for the start that we could get some wine ports. When the devs see that there is a market, they will eventually make a native port.    For me only the *buntus are really beginner friendly. I tried Fedora 22 and couldn't install non free software without fusion. The packet-manager was really slow. Mint hasn't a software-center (1) if I remember things right. Synaptic is for the most ""average joe's"" too complex at the beginning. And Arch..... nope.   One positive effect is. With SteamOS we will have a reference OS now. Developers will port with SteamOS in mind and it's the job of the other distros and desktop environment devs to maintain compatibility. When they don't care, is this not the fault of the game developer. I think we all can agree with that, can we? :)  (1) If I'm wrong say it please."

Here's how I see this going down:   Build Win10-MC to a playable state using only Win10 tech. Since they don't have to worry about platform compatibility that'll go pretty smoothly. Of course they will keep their own other platforms in mind. Edit: Turns out Win10-MC is actually the pocket edition, so this step is already done. Slowly start migrating / replacing Mojang employees until Win10-MC has a faster development pace then original Minecraft. Basically they will make sure that Win10-MC will eventually overtake original Minecraft in development speed and features, at which point large chunks of the community will switch before you can say the word “loyal”. Microsoft will announce that “new” Minecraft now also awesomely supports even more platforms, namely anything owned my Microsoft (i.e. XBox and whatever mobile devices they are selling by then). At that point “new” Minecraft will probably surpass “original” Minecraft in total user numbers.   The point of this? Well, they did promise they weren't going to break compatibility of Minecraft with other Platforms. And technically they didn't. “Old” Minecraft will be just as it ever was, just slowly going stale…  This may sound pessimistic, but I think it's a really smart business move. Honestly I can't see why they shouldn't be doing this. You know, apart from the moral part. Winding their way out of a promise based on a technicality.

Guess why. Maybe Mojang's shady dealings with Bukkit and generally lacking community support (where's the modding API?) have something to do with it. Maybe Linux not even being in the list of OS in your blog post plays a role. Maybe it's you being owned by Microsoft now. Maybe it's this new version's name. Or maybe we're just assholes, slashess."

linux_gaming,3c3hbl,devel_watcher,0,Sat Jul 4 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"At that point “new” Minecraft will probably surpass “original” Minecraft in total user numbers.   I was initially pessimistic about this, but I've now seen a silver lining.  I very much doubt that Microsoft will actively destroy/cancel the Java version of Minecraft; at most, they'll probably just stop developing it and let it stagnate.  I could see a couple of outcomes as a result of that.    The Java port becomes non-mainstream, and its' user numbers fall back to around Alpha levels or lower.   This could be a great thing.  I've believed for a while now that being mainstream has been as detrimental for Minecraft as it usually is for anything else.  We could see a return to much smaller scale, simpler modding.  With luck, the Forge crowd might even be persuaded to move to the C++ port, and leave the Java port entirely.  That would give us the freedom to replace Forge with a much smaller/simpler/less excessive modding API.    The party moves to Minetest, at least to a degree.   I could see Minetest's user numbers receiving an uptick as a result of this announcement; it's probably already happening.  From memory Minetest is written in C, although modding was anticipated from the start, and so it is fully supported rather than being an artificial afterthought.    The Java port remains officially stagnant, but informally forks in practice.   Given that I doubt Microsoft are going to want to spend development money on the Java port, I feel confident in assuming that 1.7 probably represents its' last major version.  I can't see Microsoft killing the Java port entirely, or beginning to legally chase people who mod it; it would generate bad PR for them, with no real return that I can see.  So that implies the possibility of one or more informal forks of the Java port coming into existence; or at least possible competing mod APIs.  This could be a great thing.  Minecraft's codebase is legendary for being a mess; we could see a major refactor or cleanup, as well as the realisation of such old holy grails as the y axis limit being removed, etc.  So I think there's still a lot of cause for hope, here.  We're going to see a proverbial breaking of the fellowship, yes; but that doesn't necessarily mean the end of the game.  If water starts running uphill and Microsoft actually realise the benefits of listening to their customer base, they might even eventually be convinced to do a backport of some of the best stuff from the C++ codebase, to the Java.  Anything is possible.  Even if Microsoft do decide to step on the Java port, as Terraria demonstrated, Minecraft has become a hydra at this point.  There are voxel-based games all over the place now, and the concept has spread enough that we can keep it alive, even if we have to formally name it something else.  So whatever happens, I think things will be fine."
linux_gaming,3c3hbl,petrus4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:20:11 2015 UTC,Overall good post no argument. Except for the bit about water uphill and listening to the customers. Microsoft recently has been excellent about using feedback to improve. I was apart of testing windows 10 from the beginning and they genuinely made the changes others and myself had suggested. Most of my quibbles were UI related and every one of my rage messages seemed to have gotten through. I'm even testing the mobile version now and agian the changes I keep suggesting are being made.  Doesn't mean it will happen like that for Minecraft but its not as unlikely as you think compared to recent actions. As in the past year or two. Past decade oh yeah I agree they were terrible.

linux_gaming,3c3hbl,rdvl97,10,Sat Jul 4 15:48:50 2015 UTC,I see they will use DirectX and not OpenGL or Vulkan because of this reason

linux_gaming,3c3hbl,rdvl97,30,Sat Jul 4 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"That's only because they already lost their exclusive control over it. For example the very popular unity engine was using .net, but in the form of mono, so their usual vendor lock-in strategy didn't work with it anymore, so they might as well make a PR move with it.  Just ask yourself the question: Why does DirectX12 exist? Vulkan is an open API that is designed in collaboration with almost all major industry players. Why does microsoft need an API that does exactly the same? Only one reason: It's proprietary and exclusive to windows. Convince game developers to only support DirectX12 instead of Vulkan and you get windows exclusive games. AGAIN. What do you think   “take advantage of the advanced technology and gaming platform provided by Windows 10.”   means? It very likely means DirectX12.  edit: Huh, guess not. https://twitter.com/_tomcc/status/617464527593021440. https://np.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3c3zvc/first_look_at_minecraft_for_windows_10/cssanyy.

I like to view Valve in a fantastic light but...I'll straight out say Valve and Linux is entirely monetarily driven.  Why do I believe that? I'm glad you asked! Microsoft is following Apple with the app store for Windows and pretty much that's exactly what Steam is but with games. Now, in the short term this won't hurt Valve. However over time people might be tempted to buy a game or two from the built-in stores in Windows because it literally exists and they don't need to download Steam. I think that's a serious risk to Valve and with Linux you don't have that problem. If you can start a whole new market, such as Steam Machines with Big Picture Mode, Steam Link, etc soon enough you'll have compelling reasons to use Steam and more than ""it's where my games are"".  Bravo to Valve for evolving and making the effort. I think the Linux ecosystem got lucky that the stars aligned and it was a good business direction.  Microsoft will absolutely be trying to lock people into Windows so that they can monetize Windows 10 especially now that the pricing plan is being shaken up."

Last year when MS started open-sourcing parts of their .NET Framework, released a better free (as in beer) version of Visual Studio, and bought Mojang many people wanted to see a connection between these things and hoped that MS would bring us an easily moddable version of Minecraft (which is something Mojang still hasn't been able to deliver after all these years)."

Good luck hoping that it will start to work on other Windows versions or any other OS. Also most likely existing MC will be killed off right after MC10 version starts selling nicely.

If you’re one of the 20 million(!) players who have the PC edition of Minecraft (referred to by techy people as the Java version) you’ll be able to download Windows 10 Edition Beta from the Windows 10 store for free. Other players can get it for the paltry price of $10 during the beta period (the length of which is still being decided).   This sounds like the complete technical overhaul people have demanded for a long time now. The original (Java) version is fun and all but never performed well. On the other hand: Remember when Notch didn't want to put the game on Steam? And now this is going to be a Windows 10 Store exclusive, presumably. Great. They are probably going to work on the original version even less now (and probably haven't for the last year or so because of this) and are looking to make users of that migrate to their reimplementation that's bound to one version of one PC OS only...   Minecraft is available on Windows, Mac, Windows Phone, iOS, Android, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 and PS Vita, and now, Windows 10.   There's a platform missing: Linux. I thought Microsoft got over their whole war on Open Source attitude. So not only are they, if my predictions are right, planning to fuck over Mac and Linux users, they don't even acknowledge the existence of the Linux version. What does this mean for dedicated servers then, if those will even be a thing going forward?

Movies look great on it too, skin tones looks natural (it's not just for watching porn, here, but this is still important even for your plain old Hollywood stuff). Compton makes sure you don't have any tearing with video either, neither on the Intel nor on the Nvidia card.  When using the Intel card it runs very quiet, sometimes the fans run so slowly that you'd think it's passively cooled. Using the Nvidia card is a different story, they do get loud but not unpleasantly so, they're large enough to produce a low noise instead of a high-pitched one. Still, like with any gaming laptop you might have to use closed-back headphones if you're really serious about spending a lot of gaming time there.   Edit: The built-in speakers (4 of them) sound surprisingly competent and have some oomph, especially voices sound clear and present. You won't be listening to much music (unless you're one of those people who don't mind listening to music on your mobile's built in speaker), but in a pinch this is much better than on the Clevo and HP I've owned. Also, there is no crazy DSP or sound shaping software involved, the speakers just sound OK on their own in their vanilla shape, which means they sound the same on Windows as on the GNU.  The machine tries to straddle the line between portable and gaming, it's quite wide but rasonably thin and light, and the power supply isn't like one of those Clevo monsters that weigh 2 kg, it's reasonably compact instead and runs cool. I have one of those Dakine backpacks that are taller than most, it fits in that one's laptop compartment just fine but probably wouldn't fit a ""normal"" height backpack.   Edit: The 3 USB slots are all on the right side, near your mouse hand, so if you put anything long or bulky in there, perhaps you want to get 90 degree angled USB cables and run them behind the lappy instead so they don't interfere with mousing.  Despite all this Acer fanboyism, my main gaming machine is still my near-silent desktop, though :D"

I was co-owner of a business selling laptops without Windows (you could pick between flavors of GNU/Linux or a blank hard drive) and we sold exactly the Clevo rebrands that other people in this thread are mentioning, so that's a solution there. Maybe it's telling, though, that I'm not using the machines I used to sell :(  Clevo is hit and miss, some models are great, others are really bad, like the 17"" gaming monster with the loud fans and the heavy blue tint that I had before. They are working on some thinner, lighter and still powerful machines nowadays. I'd say the Acer still has the edge with portability and screen, so while I hated to pay for something I won't be using, I'm really enjoying the hardware.  Edit: It looks like Clevo are using the LG Phillips LP156WF4-SPB1 in some of their machines now, this might also be the good IPS display that's in the Acer."

I feel the exact same way about OSX, I've thought many times about learning how to do software on it but it just seems very confusing. There doesn't seem to be a standardized procedure for generating universal binaries with autotools based projects (why did nobody think of just making a small gcc proxy that transparently outputs them?), and I have no idea what the deal with ""SDK versions is"". Like, can I just compile something and it will work anywhere? Will it work on 10.5 systems regardless? What special compiler switches do I need for that? How do I know how far the compatibility goes? On Linux, I just look at the linked glibc version of my binary and that's it, that's the minimum requirement right there.  Also the hardware cost is pretty prohibitive; I'm not really willing to pay a thousand bucks just to play around and learn the platform for fun, so I have to do with borrowing a friend's machine.  Sometimes I wish there was something as convenient as mingw-w64 that's familiar and produces binaries that just work, for OSX. I don't even have to compile anything on Windows, how cool is that."

linux_gaming,3c2h4a,k2trf,6,Sat Jul 4 06:21:31 2015 UTC,"Why not? Is this considered cheating from your point of view? You can use Wine differently. First you can try to run software yourself or a company can use it to run their software for you. So whats Wine? Wine is ""just"" (sry to be that imprecise and derogatory) a wrapper on system provided functions. For a simple example it just maps every Windows function to a Linux function (certainly its way more complex). Take the Windows function to open a file OpenFile(StringTypeWin filename, ...) you ""just"" implement this with the Linux equivalent open(StringTypeLin filename, ....)  FileHandleTypeWin OpenFile(StringTypeWin filename, ...)  {     paramStruct param = winToLinParamTransForm(filename, ...);      return linToWinRetTransform(open(param.filename, ...); }   https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365430(v=vs.85).aspx  http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html  So you just get a simple Wrapper around the Win API. Thats a very common design pattern in software engineering and there is no bad thing about it. It is so common, that nearly EVERY software uses it. And to be honest OpenGl, DirectX  are such wrappers. They wrap the API of graphic cards to a ""common"" API every one can use, so that the game programmers had not to write a special version of their game for every singe graphic card out there. Wine is not a bad thing, but its not the best thing. Sure, its better to avoid those extra function calls but that's not the mayor performance issue (those extra function calls are nearly impossible to measure i would guess) more important is how good are these wrapper function implemented. One could easily imagine that not every function is that simple like the one i showed and more often one had to implement functionality that is not there in the first place due the fact that Linux and Windows do not operate the same way.  So there are multiple ways for a developer to ""port"" a program/game. The ""best"" solution is to consider the port in the first place and use platform independent librarys. But there is not really i big difference regarding wine. Lets say your platform independent library has function openFile_independent(StringType filename, ...) All this function is doing is figure out which platform it is running on, transform the input parameter types uses the platform open file function, transform the return type. Exactly like wine does.  FileHandleTypeInd openFile_independent(StringTypeInd filename, ...)  {     if(isRunningWindows())     {         paramStructWin param = indToWinParamTransform(filename, ...);          return winToIndRetTransform(OpenFile(param.filename, ...));     }      if(isRunningLinux())      {         paramStructLin param = indToLinParamTransform(filename, ...);          return linToIndRetTransform(open(param.filename, ...));     } }   Another way would be to implement an independent codepath along your program to handle different platforms. But, at least for me, i could pretty much run into trouble with this decision cuz the maintainability suffers enormous.  #ifdef _windows_  HFILE hFile = OpenFile(""E:\\config.ini"", _buffer, OF_READ); //Do File Stuff here CloseHandle(hFile); #elif _linux_ int file_handle = open (""/home/peter/config.ini"", O_RDONLY); //Do File Stuff here close(file_handle); #endif   Yes you could get better performance but it was always better – at least for me – to write a wrapper that could have multiple compilation code paths (ifdefs so to speak in c/c++ terms) Image what you have to do if you decide to change whats done in //Do File Stuff here ...  FileHandleTypeInd openFile_independent(StringTypeInd filename, ...)  {     #ifdef _windows_      paramStructWin param = indToWinParamTransform(filename, ...);                 return winToIndRetTransform(OpenFile(param.filename, ...));     #elif _linux_     paramStructLin param = indToLinParamTransform(filename, ...);                 return linToIndRetTransform(open(param.filename, ...));     #endif }   Another way is to exchange (if possible) the platform dependent librarys and function. So you  digg not into every single function of your program to change it. At best you organized your program to modules that way that there are interchangeable. But this isn't always the case and for big software solutions and games often you see their're using so called ""middleware"". Thats ""ready to run"" interchangeable software modules that you can use as building blocks in your software. And its often advisable to do so. This is time and money saving. But if your software depends on that middleware and that middle ware is not available on the other platform you have a problem at this stage.   The last way is to wrap you hole program so it thinks it is on the first targeted platform. Every function call you make is handled by that wrapper to the native function on the newly targeted platform.   All thee parts i described above are a very very short description of whats possible and of course there are many more finer grained differences for all three of them and a software company has not to stick to one but can interchange between them for different modules/parts of their software. But the cost in time to port a software already finished gets less from top to bottom of my list. If your program is production ready you simply do NOT choose the first option its like writing you software again from scratch. Even if you considered porting at the first place it could be less expensive to go with option 2 or 3. If you have a stack of programmers specialized at writing Win/DX games you simple not just say ""make it Linux"". You better plan to use libs or middleware that is interchangeable and hire guys like Feral / Aspir etc. to make that interchange. Or go the even cheaper way and ask Codeweavers to wrap the hole thing.   So to be clear porting is often ""just"" wrapping. It all depends at which level you are starting to wrap. Wine wraps at the highest possible level – the system level. Every other solution just wraps further down. Application level, middleware level, module level, class level, function level .. you name it. Your advantage on every single level down the line is that you, as a developer, can easily intervene and tune for performance.   There is no ""way of porting"" and you cannot draw a line and say ""this is native, this is not"". Software is a complex topic. And where native begins or ends just depends on definitions. Is Java native? Is a game written in C# /.NET native? Is a game written with Unity or Unreal native? This is all Software/Libs/Frameworks heavily depending of wrapping things to make the life of the software developers more easy. And so is wine."
linux_gaming,3c2h4a,Takios,0,Sat Jul 4 08:07:32 2015 UTC,"According with your logic all software is a wrapper and for this reason is the same choose make a native game than use wine, because for you all software is a kind of wrapper.  Your logic is the kind of ""humans and dogs are animals, ergo humans and dogs are the same, I'm going to hire a dog developer because is cheaper"", lol. Obviously is a wrong logic.  For you even use a virtualbox to execute a windows game it doesn't have differents between make a game with sdl2 because in the end all is a wrapper.  Wine is a binary wrapper and it's very different design and develop a program with native libs, crossplatform middelware than develop a program designed for windows and later take the windows binary and try to execute properly with wine in a linux system. It doesn't have the same level of quality, is more dificcult to mantain, and generally have worse performance. Each option have differents implications in the quality, performance, and in the complexity to patch and solve bugs.  Nobody that wants to create a linux program would choose make the program in windows and wrap with wine. Because it is a bad design that will create a lot of problems. For the same reason if you are going to create a crossplatform program or game is not the same use for example a sdl2 than use wine. And for this reason there are more games using sdl2 for the linux version than using wine. Because using wine is a lot of worse.  If the game is very old, you can use dosbox or wine, because probably you don't have the source code, the company behind the develop of the game doesn't exists anymore and the impact in the performace is not noticiable because the current hardware have 100 more power than the original system requirements. In the case is the most efficient design to make the ""port"". For the same reason we play old videoconsole games in emulators, because it doen't have sense  a true native port in these cases. But for a new game you will have worse port with a worse quality and linux user will not pay the same money if the game is a truly native port than using wine, emulator or if the game need a virtualization solution.  Because your program or your game use the wrapper pattern doesn't convert your application in the same that use application with wine. And you are mixing these concepts because use the same word. I wrote  applications using many design pattern include the wrapper pattern and it's very different than application executed by wine."
linux_gaming,3c2h4a,Leerdeck,0,Sat Jul 4 10:15:19 2015 UTC,"Is this considered cheating from your point of view?   From my point of view, this absolutely is (unless the game is F2P); I no longer buy games on the principal of ""oh it should work in wine"". If the publishers don't care enough to make a proper port (or pay a company known for good ports to do it), then I don't care enough to buy their game.  Of course this was prior to Steam allowing refunds, but the principal still stands as I have nothing against getting games off of GOG, Desura, Humble, etc. in addition to Steam."

Finally, I have to say, all Valve games should exist under Linux (Looking at you Left 4 Dead) and fully support controllers natively (Looking at basically every game in the Valve Complete pack here, none of their menus seem to work well with a controller, once you're in a game they're pretty good however, also, some games (Like Half-Life) just flat out don't support controller, which is a huge issue).

There's a very real possibility that Valve gets swamped with returns during launch week, because you can't play WoW, LoL or whatever three-letter shitfest-MMO kids are wasting their parents money on these days (#ultima4eva).

linux_gaming,3bz7rg,oliw,4,Fri Jul 3 14:10:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know why your're being downvoted. I agree that we should encourage educated behaviours but what you described is just the plain truth. The gaming community as a whole is constantly being riddled with whining and outrage, legitimate or not, and almost always out of proportions.  The kind of display in the shop we see there will confuse people, because just like in other domains, many gamers believe they know thing and won't properly inform themselves.   That's why I support articles like the PCGAMER ones. Granted they are imperfect and could be a lot better,  people need to understand that gaming on a Steam machine will cut you from a possibly substantial part of your Steam library, and possibly your favourite games among that.  There's no point in not saying this clearly and shut down attempts to spread that word.  Sign/product positioning  on shelves is a science, and putting those leaflets the way they are will have the potential customer associate the games below with the upcoming Steam Machine hardware. Coming afterwards to say ""well in fact, this isn't going to happen exactly that way"" tones down the enthusiasm and interest of the potential customer. It should be made clear from the beginning, so that the customer knows what to expect. This will greatly reduce the number of bad experience/press from people who had expectations and quickly realised they just can't play their favourite game with their friends.   Sadly, in a business as large and popular as gaming, a number of negative claims even if not true will quickly gather attention and fuel suspicion and distrust towards a business (hell it even happens within the Linux community, where you'd expect the level of tech literacy implies developed critical thinking and systematic facts double-checking), even if the information necessary to avoid the bad experience was available and easily understandable.

That and easy userspace CPU and GPU overclocking, light screen capture software that doesn't sink performance etc.   This is also where their narrowmindedness come into play: Every of those cool things happens in large part because Windows, as closed source and proprietary it is, is already a more open platform than most consoles' system software. Linux being even more open is a real opportunity for gaming. But then they start claiming it will make things easier for hackers... sigh  Their extreme sensitiveness towards performance also does not present Linux in a favourable light to them, even though they are a crowd who knows about drivers involvement in performance (again, another contradiction), and should then blame IHVs for it and not the system itself.

In fact, outside of the PS2 and the original Wii, the other post 64bit consoles never even had those many games during their entire life-time. The XBOne and the PS4 have less than 1000 games COMBINED!   VALVe already has the convenience going for it. Just about everyone, even console gamers, have a Steam account and if they don't they can make one and play online Free-To-Play games without having to pay for PSPlus or whatever Xbox's current one is called.  About the FUD being spread, did you ever get the chance to use Steam in 2003-2005? It was horrible! It was the single biggest piece of bloatware bullshit of its time.

linux_gaming,3byo6d,lukeimyomama,3,Fri Jul 3 08:32:08 2015 UTC,"Federated Reddit with blockchain based democracy at each subreddit (mods would have terms and voting would happen through blockchain for transparency - voting age for an account could be something like half a year and X amount of posts, so fresh accounts would not mess up the votes).  I like that."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,gutigen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"How would you stop brigading, though? I guess you could allow moderators to disregard content from nonsubscribers in case of brigading but that would definitely lead to a different overall community. Interesting though."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,lukeimyomama,2,Fri Jul 3 10:02:35 2015 UTC,"Well, brigading would be partially mitigated by your account (which can't be a fresh one) being linked to specific blockchain address you cannot change. What I mean is that conspiracy theorists (and I'm not calling them here in negative way, quite opposite) would have a field day if anyone even tried brigading.  Obviously it can't be 100% avoided, but it's much better than what Reddit offers atm (too much power in too few hands).  Key is transparency and blockchain is just perfect for that purpose.  EDIT:  I know that at first glance privacy would be a bit in vain here, since your specific account would be much more valuable to you - that's why the limits for account (in case of voting) can't be too restrictive, but just enough to make democracy work."

Edit:   Something else that just popped into my mind: The bitcoin network distributes influence according to processing power and people provide this power because they generate/earn money that way.

Identity might be interesting, PGP keys can handle authentication easily, but registering human-readable names might be a problem.  If there were a continuous blockchain you could register names like Namecoin does, but it doesn't have that.  A possible solution is Freenet's Web of Trust model, which randomly generates names based on the pubkey, if I understand correctly.  This gives human-readable names securely tied to a key without the registration problem."

linux_gaming,3byo6d,fabreeze,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"Federation isn't really a solution, go p2p. There's more than one reason, but the actual death nail I'd say is that it still doesn't decentralise things for the masses.  And as I already linked to secushare: The gnunet/secushare people are the ones to watch out for, and help, in this instance. If you're asking ""were's the releases suitable for end-users"" then the answer is ""there are none, for crypto is hard and ought to be done right before rollout"".  They're currently planning to do a social network thingie, but technically speaking that's very close to reddit, especially with gnunet as underlying platform so things like persistent storage are only API calls away.  You might want to pay someone to provide persistent storage for your user profile or subreddit if p2p isn't reliable enough for your tastes, but, that, would again just be another node: The way say diaspora, XMPP etc. are working is that you have an identity with some federated server, and that server is speaking a different language to its federation partners than to you, as a client. Once you're in, you can't change providers while keeping identity. It's been that way since email, and that's the thing that needs to fall.  There's also cryptographic challenges federated systems generally don't address. In particular, you generally have to trust the server."

linux_gaming,3byo6d,AngryElPresidente,2,Sun Jul 5 11:10:24 2015 UTC,I'm not really interested in moving from one walled garden run by a private for-profit company to (essentially) another. I think the problems we're seeing the beginnings of here are inherent to that model.  For me the ideal would be a somewhat-democratic non-profit foundation along the lines of Wikimedia. I think there's a lot of value in its being web-based and centralised (obviously decentralisation has big upsides too but I think there's too much overhead in creating something like that for now).
linux_gaming,3byo6d,uoou,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:24:33 2015 UTC,What you need for reddit-like communications is just eventual consistency. It shouldn't be a problem to make it work in a somewhat freenet-like manner.

linux_gaming,3byo6d,the_s_d,2,Fri Jul 3 08:59:22 2015 UTC,Isn't that almost what the Ubuntu group did to one of the Kubuntu leaders last month?
linux_gaming,3byo6d,nolanknoll,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"No there was a big shitstorm but nobody knows really all the facts. But that's OK for the most People, because Ubuntu is always the big evil guy who is to blame and the victim is always the other party. I'm not a Canonical fan, but they can do what they want, it is always the wrong thing."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,uoou,3,Fri Jul 3 15:41:03 2015 UTC,"They said they decide who will be recognized as leaders of their subcommunities. Basically, they own Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, and if they don't like how they're doing things they will refuse to work with that person.   The guy gave some lip because of real issues that Canonical was ignoring for a long time and they told him to fuck off and he's no recognized as a Kubuntu leader. A bit harsh for a guy just frustrated in good intentions for the project that directly impacts his own."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,devel_watcher,2,Fri Jul 3 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"It was not Canonical as company it was the ubuntu community council. The reason for this was that the Ubuntu council said he was disrespect- and hateful. I have no Idea if this is right but I see the general tone in the FOSS world and it's often awful. And yes they own Ubuntu. All the official *buntus have access to their resources and can get a cut from the general donations, if they want. I spoke today with some of the Ubuntu Gnome devs about donations. It is not nice but that is the business world. If they don't want to work with Ubuntu anymore they can go to other projects. Some did this, some not. There is not black and white. Maybe the guy just crossed the red line with a angry comment. I believe the Community Council has some rules how do you address people. But here is the perfect example, you even didn't know that it was a non employed community council, no you heard somewhere that Canonical was shutting some brave guy down, because we all know this company is the total evil. I have not enough facts to say which side is right but I'm not biased, because I don't care. For many FOSS people is Ubuntu a red towel."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,uoou,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:07:09 2015 UTC,"Pardon my ignorance of a cultural reference, but what is a red towel? I'm sure there is an equivalent phrasing in the U.S., but I'm not familiar, and I'd prefer to be informed. Perhaps a bull-fighting reference?"
linux_gaming,3byo6d,mykro76,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:49:58 2015 UTC,"Ah sorry I probably misspelled that. Yep you are right with the bull-fighting, I used automatically a German idiom. Maybe I should use rag instead of towel? Like ""It's like a red rag to a bull"".   In my defense: I speak English actively only for 2 - 3 months now. So it's a little bit rusty.  ;)"
linux_gaming,3byo6d,nbates80,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:06:13 2015 UTC,"Ha, I got it though!  Don't worry too much about it for two reasons... firstly, you spelled each word correctly, and secondly, I promise you that your English (in addition to being quite understandable) is far superior to my German  ;-)  Typically the English idiom would be to ""see red"", implied to be through the eyes of a bull which the subject of your claim is to personify temporarily.  Example above... ""For many in the FOSS community, anything to do with Ubuntu makes them see red.""  Aside from this, and to your point originally, I agree that the tone attitude of many online communities, of recent years, has become discouragingly toxic. FOSS communities are some examples of this, but they are not alone (just look at the world of video gaming and gender politics, in addition to this current Reddit drama).  I share your assertion that we haven't enough information to be so quick to judge, not that I care enough to judge (in either the Reddit employee's case, or the Kubuntu project leader position).  In another thread, someone replied with rumors from ""Reddit insiders"" that the employee was refusing to run IAmA in a more commercialized/monetized way, and was dismissed from employment for that purpose; a claim which of course wasn't sourced (anonymous employees, fearing for their jobs!) and which feeds into the protesters' narrative, conveniently."

linux_gaming,3byo6d,AliasGram,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"I don't believe this is slacktivism this time. Look at the amount of publicity this is getting. Sure, we don't really have to do anything but make the communities not commute anymore. But even that small of a gesture is making waves through the press. This will have an impact on Reddit overall. Reddit as we know it will change. How? I cannot say."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,waxtats,4,Fri Jul 3 17:18:21 2015 UTC,"It is slacktivism as it really doesn't require any real effort from the people doing this. Just post/comment/upvote some funny memes on /r/pics.  My take is reddit will do something to calm the masses and then start gradually rolling changes so that nobody can get their traffic hostage in situations like this.  I personally wasn't affected at all by this debacle as the subreddits I am subscribed to didn't care. But again, my investment on reddit as a symbol of anything is non existing. Something similar happened with Steam, and I said something like this: people like to put people/sites on pedestals and get too invested on them. They throw money at Reddit or Steam out of hype, and spend time building/moderating/promoting those platforms. Then, when they realize things are not what they thought, they feel betrayed and outraged as they realized they been helping to create something they do not own or control. And it is then when this drama comes in.  In a sense, this is why open source is important and free as in beer is not the same as free as in speech. I hope in the future we start seeing more open platforms. Something like reddit but descentralized but interconnected. Maybe even using reddit's source code but forking it so that hosting and control is not centralized on a single owner. Anyways, life goes on."

linux_gaming,3byo6d,Smaloki,3,Fri Jul 3 07:51:16 2015 UTC,"My personal thoughts on gol aside, but monopolizing your news source is never a good idea. That's why reddit seemed like such a natural fit, different sources, community moderation etc."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,Leerdeck,4,Fri Jul 3 10:03:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, more is better to keep pushing Linux gaming."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,the_s_d,4,Fri Jul 3 10:19:13 2015 UTC,"Reddit is good as news source, or let's say better as rumor source. Theirs is no control or something, so the news can be right or complete bullshit. People don't bother to double check.   But community moderation? The Karma system is not democratic. There is a reason why you have minority rights in a good democracy. If you have a different opinion, then the majority of a subreddit can downvote you. The quality of your post is meaningless, they just want to silence you, because they don't agree with you. But if you have no good Karma anymore, you can't post. So you just stop to debate in the particular subreddit. That is self censoring. Look at my last posts in my profile. I posted a PC World Article in /r/games and had a ""debate"" with Windows Master Race guys. If you read my response, you see that I didn't attacked anybody. I lost more then half (160) of my whole Karma because of that. Yes you can use a different subreddit but fleeing in a protected bubble is not the right thing to do. /r/games is mostly a echo chamber for Windows Gamer now regardless the fact that it is for all gamers."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,liamdawe,2,Fri Jul 3 10:22:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, but at least it takes few people to downvote you, not just one guy who owns the site."
linux_gaming,3byo6d,tayshady,6,Fri Jul 3 10:41:18 2015 UTC,"that's right, my point was that reddit isn't the perfect system as some people always say. I have just the basic knowledge about the Victoria Tayler situation and not enough information. I think there is no perfect system. I think we need someone who has great power. Moderator of a harassment subreddit will not stop the harassment as example. And I don't want to know how it is to be the victim of a hate campaign. It isn't something you can just ignore. Whit that said, we should have a vote system. Is the leader bad, we can vote for a better candidate. But that is just wishful thinking, because reddit is business and not a democracy, at least for its owners."

Did you have an ISO of the Sims and it's still pointing at that maybe?  Is the GTA disc mounted on Linux and can you browse the files from your normal file manager (or command line)?
linux_gaming,3c1k4m,DeeBoFour20,2,Sat Jul 4 06:22:34 2015 UTC,"Wine/PoL created a virtual drive in which I installed The Sims 3. I've attempted removing it (to no avail), as well as creating a new one. When I go to file manager, the GTA disc is there, but it's still listed under ""Sims3"" and I can't access it. I'm scared to remove the virtual drive as I play/installed Sims via disc and don't want to remove progress in the case that I lose it and can't remember how to install it again. I can't really open the GTA disc (same case with Sims), but installing Sims was a breeze when I finally clicked the correct sequence of buttons. I've used PoL to install GTA and everything flows correctly - until I have to choose a drive. I've attempted choosing the ""Sims3"" drive (which is where the on-board file directory says it is) and it continues to give me the ""Can't find disk"" error. I think my directory to the disc itself is incorrect, but even then, I'm not sure how to manifest the correct directory as it says that it simply isn't there which I know is not true because my OS reads it and understands that there is, in fact, a GTA 4 disc present."

What do you mean there?  You say you can't access it but later you say the OS sees it.  What exactly do you see in your file manager (take a screenshot if you can)  What I think is happening is PoL tries to isolate each game from one another by putting each one in its own ""Wine Bottle"" and it sounds like you're trying to install GTA into the Sim's bottle instead of making a new one.  The CD thing should be a separate issue though.  You may simply not have the GTA CD mounted which is why I'm asking if you can browse the CD in your file manager.  Nothing PoL does should prevent you from doing that much."
