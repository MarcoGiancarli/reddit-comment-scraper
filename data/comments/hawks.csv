Unlike other players on the roster (let alone a rookie) who were part of the team but didn't get any points or much play time, Teuvo deserved it.

Even at the opening ceremony I heard the people around me comment that he wasn't even faking a smile.   The few people I chatted with who met him said he barely looked up and didn't say much.  One girl said he looked completely checked out and was just going through the motions that the organization wanted him too.   Maybe the amount of people there made him nervous or something but everyone seemed pretty disappointed with how he was handling himself.

hawks,3e0946,Cartortus,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:07 2015 UTC,"Where does he fit though, line wise?  Bickell - Toews - Hossa  Panarin - Anisimov - Kane  Versteeg - Teuvo - Dano  Desjardins - Kruger - Shaw  Garbutt - McNeill - Hartman - Baun - Tikhonov as scratches or call ups at some point and if we move Bickell, I'd see Dano or Panarin jumping up to his spot, and tikhonov replacing whoever moves up."
hawks,3e0946,Coop3,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:46 2015 UTC,Dano - Toews - Hossa  Panarin - Anisimov - Kane  Morin - Teuvo - Versteeg  Desjardins - Kruger - Shaw  Versteeg can play both wings.  Bickell should be gone with any luck.
hawks,3e0946,badseedjr,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:58 2015 UTC,I don't think Bickell deserves a top line spot.
hawks,3e0946,thorofasgard,9,Tue Jul 21 06:25:38 2015 UTC,"Our line pairings arent always the traditional ""he's a top line player""  We have so much talent Q often spreads it around between all the lines to balance scoring.  If it was just about who is the best players itd probably always be Kane - Toews- Hossa, but you don't want to have all your great players stacked against the other team's first line."
hawks,3e0946,goalieman392,3,Tue Jul 21 08:00:50 2015 UTC,I think that whoever gets plugged into that spot with Toews and Hossa will produce. Even Bickell.

hawks,3e0946,Cartortus,4,Tue Jul 21 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with it as well. To me, it's always seemed like Q gets these hate-boners for some players (like Morin), and will bench them for the slightest mistake (even if the player makes up for it later in their shift). I can definitely see how that would lead to frustration.  Hopefully that doesn't happen this time around, I think Morin could be a solid LW on this team. Him making the roster could also give some of the younger European guys a chance to get acclimated to the North American game before getting thrown to the wolves."
hawks,3e0946,jmajewski,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with him being a possible LW for the Hawks. I always liked the way he played. He was essentially our next Saad before we knew we had Saad.  I never knew he had such great Corsi numbers while playing with the Hawks as Powers alludes to in that article.  I think it came down to him wanting to play for himself more than playing for the team. That was something I always felt when it came to the Morin situation. If he is true in accepting a role on this team, he has a definite chance to make the NHL roster."

He reminds me of how sad it can be to make it to the NHL but miss out on a few opportunities to solidify a starting position, and then be always faced with chasing that opportunity again. Then again, I wouldn't mind being in his skates right now with yet another shot at proving myself capable to fly with the Hawks.     #FlyMorin"

I attempted to get in after it started (I had a photo session that interfered), and we couldn't go in because it was at capacity. I waited outside for about half an hour before I could go in, and when I was waiting, I saw a group of four people walk up to the doors. I was going to tell them, ""No, we have to stay here,"" but then I realized that one was Christina! She was greeted at the door, and a woman said, ""We're gonna go listen to the panel with Toews and Dejardins!"" They let her in, and I just knew they would so something to recognize her during #WhatsYourGoal. When they brought her onstage, she was sobbing and hugging Troy Murray, and then she was inseparable from Bickell, who shared his seat with her.

He had a good physical play and a great shot. I feel like I stand alone with having him be a favorite of mine cause not many remember his time is Chicago."

He was stranded in snow and well below zero temperatures walking at 3AM and knocked on some strangers door ... He and stranger ended up sitting and talking hockey all night and morning.  I think he has to be my favorite of all time.  Emptied his tank out there on every shift.  Full of so much piss and vinegar ... Guy would throw his body at everything.  Including D. Hatcher.

hawks,3ds7qm,maximumrocker,21,Sat Jul 18 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that Kruger is an RFA and did not file for arbitration. This gives the Hawks an enormous amount of leverage, because if he doesn't sign with them, he's not playing next year. While he can try to negotiate with other teams, he doesn't have much bargaining power because a) the Hawks will match any offer below 1.8M (the 3rd round cut off) and other teams don't want to do the Hawks negotiating for them and b) any offer above $1.8M will result in a ""let him walk"" deal. Gotta think the Hawks would rather have the second round pick than pay him 2M AAV.   My prediction: Kruger gets a 1 or 2 year bridge deal for 1.6AAV (he's currently 1.3). 1.5 is likely the absolute lowest Kruger would take and 1.75 is the highest the Hawks will likely offer."

He isn't that bad!   He led the team in hits, by A LOT.  He has had to play the tough guy role when the opponents come calling, which he is not.  He has great hands for a power forward, and isn't a terrible skater. And I know a lot of you argue with me that we don't need one: but if the Hawks had a genuine tough guy, (not a pure goon, but someone that can fight a heavyweight and play decent hockey (think Derek Engelland, or McQuaid, or yuck Lucic)) Bickells game and confidence (go hand in hand) would improve tenfold.   There is so much potential with Bickell, I'm not upset he's still on the roster. I'm upset he is overpaid."
hawks,3dr1ri,MK667,9,Sat Jul 18 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah same here. I like Bickell enough when he's on his game, ever since that 13 cup run he's been having down seasons. I'd love to see him get back to where he was 2 years ago. I'd also love to see Kruger back as well."

hawks,3dr1ri,Patrick_Kane,0,Mon Jul 20 21:34:48 2015 UTC,Ok. Fine. But who do we sell to make room for Kruger? And become compliant.

Honestly I don't see a way we keep Krueger. :/  And he's so under-rated, it's going to hurt."
hawks,3dr1ri,Patrick_Kane,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:43:47 2015 UTC,Versteeg gets up compliant but not enough room to sign Kruger. Bickell is the only way to do both.

Send his @ss to Rockford."
hawks,3dr1ri,discometalstu,3,Mon Jul 20 14:18:56 2015 UTC,"To Bick's credit, he's a big guy who doesn't skate like a big guy and he's got a killer wrister that he hasn't used in a year. Part of the problem is that the team made improvements and he got bumped out of the top six. Nobody's saying he's not a good player, it's just that he's not worth the contract anymore (percentage of cap space vs minutes/points) and, in a way, doesn't fit quite as well as he used to. We'll see where this goes, but I feel like he's going to get moved in the pre-season shuffle."
hawks,3dr1ri,2tidesaday,2,Sat Jul 18 20:06:48 2015 UTC,But he's gotta be moved in order to sign Krugs

I got in the TVR wristband line at 11:25 and was able to get one.   The Darling one was another story... That was a mess. The ushers had people lined up in two different spots and when security took us over to join the main line, they nearly hit the line limit. They said they would hand out wristbands early to clear people out and I figured I was SOL since I had a TVR wristband. I left my friends to go to TVR at 12:45 and when I was done, they still had done anything. People are me started drama by calling out line jumpers and I'm pretty sure everyone still ended up getting wristbands anyway. Didn't really expect to spend about 6 hours waiting for Darling.

hawks,3dmzoj,HaveYouSeenMyTaco,40,Fri Jul 17 16:16:39 2015 UTC,If the youngsters pan out I say we improved
hawks,3dmzoj,haf12,12,Fri Jul 17 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, if Teräväinen, Dano and Panarin have breakthrough seasons we might not end up missing Sharp and Saad too much"
hawks,3dmzoj,jmajewski,10,Fri Jul 17 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"I think we've improved.  Anisimov is a tall and big bodied centerman that plays strong in both zones. We've never really had that.  Let's say Dano plays on the top line with Toews and Hossa, if he can produce 45 points this year, I'd say the 5 mil reduction between he and Saad is totally worth it.  If Versteeg remains on the roster, he could play the wing alongside Anisimov-Kane and they could play like the Versteeg-Richards-Kane line before Versteeg was injured. That line was awesome.  Tikhonov can make the roster and I hope he does. Depending on Q's line juggling, he could end up finding a spot next to Panarin and Teravainen. Panarin and Tikhonov were one of the most dynamic duos in all of the KHL last year. His numbers don't really say much because of all the off ice issues he was dealing with because of family, but the guy could be a steal at his price tag. He is a former first round talent that never really got his chance to play in the NHL.  Garbutt brings much needed grit to the team to protect everyone else, and I think he and Daley will accept their roles well and play a more levelheaded style of hockey for Quenneville.  Teuvo will finally get his first full year at the NHL level, and I only expect his numbers to rise as he gets more consistent experience and time on the powerplay.  I still see Kruger as a must sign going forward. He'd make the fourth line a clear staple for the Blackhawks' success, and I think they'll find a way to move enough cap space to get him re-signed.   And don't forget, we still have basically all of the ""core"" intact: Keith, Seabrook, Toews, Kane, Hjalmarsson, Hossa. And Shaw"
hawks,3dmzoj,malcontented,8,Fri Jul 17 21:06:34 2015 UTC,And Crawford.  Two time SC champ.  He's proved himself to me.  Also a full season of Darling as backup so we'll get to see what he can do
hawks,3dmzoj,ClintEastwood41,12,Fri Jul 17 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"Richards is being replaced by Anisimov, Vermette is being replaced by Teuvo.  Chances are Tikhonov doesn't even make the team on opening day barring a huge training camp.    Overall I think the Hawks will be just as good as they were last year after a month or two of getting the right combos and starting to get familiar with each other."
hawks,3dmzoj,rpgreenmachine4,12,Fri Jul 17 16:24:32 2015 UTC,"Oh Tikhonov has a spot. Dude took like a 2 million dollar cut to come over here and he played with Panarin on the top line. I feel like Garrbutt, Tropp and Morin might be the odd men out..."
hawks,3dmzoj,Jaydubzsc2,6,Fri Jul 17 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Garbutt can play and he defends his teammates, he brings grit. He produced decent amount of points with a shitty line in Dallas, I predict he makes the team. He defends his teammates no matter what doesn't matter if its chara, he + andrew will be good to have on lines defending our players."
hawks,3dmzoj,jmajewski,2,Fri Jul 17 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and I hope that happens because I've only heard wonderful things about his game in the KHL, especially when paired with Panarin.  I think Garbutt will make the team out of camp based on experience alone, but Tikhonov will be among the first call-ups from Rockford."

hawks,3dmzoj,ohmylantern20,4,Fri Jul 17 16:23:26 2015 UTC,It may just be me but I say anisimov has his best year yet. Losing Sharp and Saad was devastating but if tuevo continues to play like he did in the playoffs and panarin lives up to his potential and Dano continues his production like the end of the regular season we will be better than last year. Just my opinion
hawks,3dmzoj,BearFan34,2,Fri Jul 17 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"It bothers me more to lose a young star like Saad than a more seasoned veteran player like Sharp.  The guys left on the team aren't getting any younger.  Seeing a young Saad develop into the type of player he was gave me great hope of the Hawks building around him in the future.   Having said that, bring on next year. Let's get it sorted out."

The only reason this is relevant to anything is because some irrelevant moron pulled the whole Sharp affair bullshit out of his ass.   I wish the best for Duncs, we all know he deserves it."
hawks,3dl1nj,bamacowboy6,33,Fri Jul 17 06:00:48 2015 UTC,"Back in Canada after winning the Conn Smythe trophy and a third Stanley Cup, the indefatigable Duncan Keith finally felt his resistance wear down when he succumbed to a force that exposed a hidden weakness.  Blame a culprit whose name you won't find on an NHL roster but is well-known in hockey country.  ""For a while I think all I had was Tim Hortons and ice cappuccinos and chocolate glazed doughnuts so I'm not going to sit here and pretend I eat healthy every day,'' Keith told the Tribune in a phone interview from his home in British Columbia, where the restaurant chain thrives. ""You need to be able to relax and have that break physically and mentally. It recharges you to get into the gym and go hard and carry that into the year.''  Nobody on the Hawks deserved to give himself a break more than Keith, the defenseman who logged more than 700 minutes in a postseason that cemented his legacy. While the hockey world marveled at the future Hall of Famer's endurance, Keith mostly shrugged. He figured this was why he became a slave to nutrition and meticulously monitored his diet and exercise. He never looked as tired as everyone felt watching him.  Besides, since last summer, skating always has been the easy part for Keith no matter how many minutes he played as he found refuge in the rink. Any physical challenges paled in comparison with the emotional struggles Keith has endured since the separation from his wife, Kelly-Rae, a year ago. Intensely private, Keith decided to broach the personal issue publicly only now to help explain his absence from this weekend's Blackhawks Convention. In short, dad duty called and Keith answered, opting to spend the weekend in Canada with 2-year-old son, Colton, who takes after his father in the energy department based on Keith's proud description.  ""Obviously, I'd really like to be there at the convention because I always enjoy meeting new fans and seeing old ones, so that's a little frustrating not being able to celebrate with all of them,'' Keith said. ""But in my own situation, I am going through a divorce. I've been separated for over a year now. I think right now my time needs to be spent with my son and I'm doing everything I can to spend as much time with him and dealing with a lot going on right now. I hope everybody can respect that and our privacy. Kelly and I are doing our best to co-parent Colton and raise him in a loving environment whether he's with her or with me. This is part of that.''  Part of being a Chicago sports celebrity of Keith's ilk these days means the more the public loves him, the more fans want to know. The more they want to know, the less privacy Keith enjoys. That reality of the social-media age hit Keith hard at times last season, such as when salacious, unfounded rumors about his personal life and that of former teammate Patrick Sharp found their way onto gossip websites and talk-radio shows.  ""I'm not going to lie: It has been a long year and extremely difficult,'' Keith said. ""I know there was a lot of talk throughout the year regarding Sharpie and that was all a complete fabrication as well. My divorce had nothing to do with anything except what was between me and Kelly-Rae, and that's where I'd like to keep it.  ""Hopefully people can respect that and give us our privacy to move forward and co-parent our son. … It's obviously not the way I wanted things to be or drew them up. At the same time, you have to find a way to focus. For me, it usually was getting to the rink and turning the switch to hockey.''  Turning to hockey, Keith sighed when asked about all the changes since he and his Hawks teammates hoisted the silver chalice. Keith occupied the locker next to Brandon Saad's in the dressing room the last three years. Fellow defenseman Johnny Oduya always sat across from Keith on team flights. Sharp, in Keith's words, ""is along with Seabs (Brent Seabrook) one of my two best friends in hockey.'' All three players became former Hawks thanks to the salary cap, an NHL reality Keith understands more than he accepts.  ""Anytime you play with someone for a long time you're going to develop chemistry, a bond and a friendship and I was really close with those three guys,'' Keith said. ""Sharpie, I played with for 10 years. It's tough to say goodbye. They're all difficult. As hockey players, we've been through this before when we know it's part of the business. But at the same time, it sucks. There's no other way to put it.''  Lamenting the loss of old teammates in no way reflects Keith's excitement over his new ones. Like a sportscaster reporting the trade, Keith pointed out defenseman Trevor Daley scored 16 goals for the Stars last season. He called forward Ryan Garbutt, who came with Daley in the Sharp deal, ""the hardest guy to play against when we played Dallas.''  ""He really is a pain so we're happy to have him on our side now,'' Keith said. ""Our goal is to win a Stanley Cup every year, and we're looking forward to bringing the new guys into the fold. Some of the new players we acquired are really going to help.''  The eagerness Keith spoke with belied a 10-year veteran who celebrated his 32nd birthday Thursday. If Keith has drawn closer to the end of his career than the beginning, nobody can tell by the tone of his voice or approach to his work. When reporters asked Keith during the playoffs about making the Hall of Fame or being compared to Bobby Orr, he deflected the praise like so many poke-checks. Keith calls such talk humbling, a byproduct of being ""fortunate to be on good teams with great players.'' Greatness seldom stops to savor the ride.  ""I have worked hard for my success but don't really look back and rest on my laurels because as soon as you do that, you get passed by,'' Keith said. ""Time goes by fast. I don't know if I have a lot of hockey left in me, a lot of good years. You see young guys coming in and it seems like a blink of the eye (ago), I was the young guy. More than anything, it makes you not want to take anything for granted.''  That sentiment applied to the people of Fort Frances, Ontario, who were there when Keith started his journey to hockey immortality. Keith first wore a sweater in 1990 for the Times Tigers in the Fort Frances Minor Hockey Association and lived in the town of 7,952 until he was 14 before his family moved to Penticton, British Columbia. Triumphantly, Keith will bring the Cup to his original hometown for the first time Aug. 1 and renew bonds that still exist from his days playing youth hockey.  ""Now when I see those guys it's just like yesterday we were out in the street playing street hockey or the outdoor rink scoring goals,'' Keith said. ""That's what is cool about hockey and the friendships you develop. They last forever.''  The NHL's leader in stamina knows something about that."

At the same time, you have to find a way to focus. For me, it usually was getting to the rink and turning the switch to hockey.''  cComments Divorce sucks and sorry Sharpie needlessly got dragged through the mud, but it sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders, Duncs. We're looking forward to another parade or 2 (or more) before you hang up your skates for good.  Turning to hockey, Keith sighed when asked about all the changes since he and his Hawks teammates hoisted the silver chalice. Keith occupied the locker next to Brandon Saad's in the dressing room the last three years. Fellow defenseman Johnny Oduya always sat across from Keith on team flights. Sharp, in Keith's words, ""is along with Seabs (Brent Seabrook) one of my two best friends in hockey.'' All three players became former Hawks thanks to the salary cap, an NHL reality Keith understands more than he accepts.  ""Anytime you play with someone for a long time you're going to develop chemistry, a bond and a friendship and I was really close with those three guys,'' Keith said. ""Sharpie, I played with for 10 years. It's tough to say goodbye. They're all difficult. As hockey players, we've been through this before when we know it's part of the business. But at the same time, it sucks. There's no other way to put it.''  Lamenting the loss of old teammates in no way reflects Keith's excitement over his new ones. Like a sportscaster reporting the trade, Keith pointed out defenseman Trevor Daley scored 16 goals for the Stars last season. He called forward Ryan Garbutt, who came with Daley in the Sharp deal, ""the hardest guy to play against when we played Dallas.''  ""He really is a pain so we're happy to have him on our side now,'' Keith said. ""Our goal is to win a Stanley Cup every year, and we're looking forward to bringing the new guys into the fold. Some of the new players we acquired are really going to help.''  The eagerness Keith spoke with belied a 10-year veteran who celebrated his 32nd birthday Thursday. If Keith has drawn closer to the end of his career than the beginning, nobody can tell by the tone of his voice or approach to his work. When reporters asked Keith during the playoffs about making the Hall of Fame or being compared to Bobby Orr, he deflected the praise like so many poke-checks. Keith calls such talk humbling, a byproduct of being ""fortunate to be on good teams with great players.'' Greatness seldom stops to savor the ride.  ""I have worked hard for my success but don't really look back and rest on my laurels because as soon as you do that, you get passed by,'' Keith said. ""Time goes by fast. I don't know if I have a lot of hockey left in me, a lot of good years. You see young guys coming in and it seems like a blink of the eye (ago), I was the young guy. More than anything, it makes you not want to take anything for granted.''  That sentiment applied to the people of Fort Frances, Ontario, who were there when Keith started his journey to hockey immortality. Keith first wore a sweater in 1990 for the Times Tigers in the Fort Frances Minor Hockey Association and lived in the town of 7,952 until he was 14 before his family moved to Penticton, British Columbia. Triumphantly, Keith will bring the Cup to his original hometown for the first time Aug. 1 and renew bonds that still exist from his days playing youth hockey.  ""Now when I see those guys it's just like yesterday we were out in the street playing street hockey or the outdoor rink scoring goals,'' Keith said. ""That's what is cool about hockey and the friendships you develop. They last forever.''  The NHL's leader in stamina knows something about that.  Sorry if I missed some random crap thrown in there. I thought it was really well written and a good read."

He had to pick his kid up from the babysitters, so that's all we got to attend.  It was pretty awesome for my first time experience.    When we showed up I could see a couple of prospects and legacy guys just mingling in the crowd. Talked to Jammer for a minute while waiting in line for some drinks at the bar.  Finally got to see the cup, which was an amazing experience for me.  Dano and Daley were there, and to be honest, I probably wouldn't have recognized any of the other new faces.  Got a chance to talk to Daley for about 5 minutes, and he sounded incredibly excited to be up in Chicago playing for the Hawks.   Eventually we noticed a bit of a fan commotion in one of the corners so we went to check it out, and Toews had popped in and was signing stuff and taking pictures.  He had a handler with him who kept nicely reminding him that he had 5 more minutes, but Toews just kept signing for everyone.    By the time we left we also ended up seeing Espesito, Q, Darling, Bickell, and Versteeg.  Got my shirt signed by Toews and Versteeg, so I left in a great mood.   tl;dr - Got to attend the pre-opening ceremonies corporate party, and it was a blast!"

This is a short offseason, and a lot more of the guys have young families now. Duncs only gets so much time with son. Seabs and his wife have a newborn. Hjammer takes enough of a beating during the season that he probably just needs some peace and quiet (and I think his sister is getting married this weekend or the next).

hawks,3dku9d,kalish96,4,Fri Jul 17 02:12:52 2015 UTC,"I actually volunteered at the convention last year and I will be again this weekend. So here's how it goes:   When you get your packet you should have RFID check-in(last year it was paper badges/wristbands. Each check-in received scratch offs that had a color coordinated to a special,secret signing. You hand that to the clerk and get a pass to go to a guaranteed signing. Who that is can be difficult to determine unless you know the colors beforehand....I am not privy to that.   They are correct they:be prepared for long lines, lots of people and expensive food. Chipotle, potbellys, even the wing place a street or two over is a great choice and a hidden gem.   Be ready to sit on the floor as lines will be jam packed and be patient/friendly with the staff because they all volunteered to help make this event happen.  Also, bring some cash if you can. Last year some issues with the Internet prevented the use of cards for a few vendors. If you want to see some obscure memorabilia, check out the auctions(silent and live) and the vendors downstairs. Sometimes people will be willing to trade their autograph tickets for others so keep an open ear and eyes.   Remember to have fun, breathe and treat the players like human beings as well as your fellow convention-goers. Also, if you're interested they are selling $5 tickets to the Pre-season scrimmage that occurs in September between the entire Blackhawks team and you get to sit anywhere in the United Center, literally center ice up against the glass if you're early enough. They will sell these online but there's a ticketing few so it's best to snag a walking-rep(they will be all over the hotel, myself included) as they will have the tickets in hand to sell. This game always sells out so keep your eyes peeled if you really want to go to the game. Have a great time and maybe I'll see you there! Have a great time!"

Bring what you want signed, they don't provide anything.    When the doors open if not before.    Also, either bring food or eat offsite (like the Chipotle down the street), the food at the hotel is crazy expensive."

hawks,3dgx6y,Pepsuber188,-17,Thu Jul 16 04:41:00 2015 UTC,"I fucking love toews and he's definitely up there, but really? Best in the whole league? Definitely not"
hawks,3dgx6y,Kglee54,5,Thu Jul 16 05:06:09 2015 UTC,"Why, because he's not a contestant for the Hart, or should I say Stat trophy every year?  He's the best two way forward in the league, his leadership/work ethic is untouchable, his clutch score on NHL16 should be a 98, and he's a primary reason for 3 Cup wins.  The only tangible way to gauge best player in the league, is if there were an expansion team, who would you want as your foundation. Crosby? We've seen how that little whiny bitch has worked out over the last 5 years. OV?  Yeah, he shoots and then his back check consists of skating with the speed of my 3 year old. Stamkos?  As demonstrated, Tazer pimp slapped him back into his place a month ago.  Not sure where your logic lies, but whatever.  I wouldn't trade Toews for anybody."
hawks,3dgx6y,king_of_pancakes,8,Thu Jul 16 12:13:50 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I was with you right up to the point you started slagging other players. Crosby hasn't whined or cried about anything in years, Ovi is not near as bad as that, and Stamkos is absolutely incredible. No question.   Toews is just better in more intangible ways. Toews is called the best player by other players, GMs and coaches. That should be argument enough. The people that best know the game and the players call him the best, so thats enough for me. Why we feel the need to degrade Toews' competition to justify his worth is beyond me. He is the best in the company of excellence, not good in a sea of mediocre."
hawks,3dgx6y,Kglee54,4,Thu Jul 16 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe I was a little tough on Crosby, but he does whine, and it gets annoying. I'm displaced in DC so I see tons of Caps games, and Yes, OV's back check is that bad. All the Caps fans know it out here. I don't care how good of a goal scorer you are; if you don't play D your cutting out 50% of the game. And Stamkos is awesome. I should have been more articulate than just slagging him. The difference between Stamkos and Tazer is in game 6, when your team is down in the series, Toews scores on Crawford on that breakaway."
hawks,3dgx6y,JasonEAltMTG,2,Thu Jul 16 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"Off topic, is there anyone you would trade Kane for?"
hawks,3dgx6y,chocolate_chip_kelly,5,Thu Jul 16 13:25:58 2015 UTC,Nope.
hawks,3dgx6y,chocolate_chip_kelly,2,Thu Jul 16 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"Don't call Crosby a whiny bitch man,  he's not anymore.  I don't like him,  but it's because he's the only rival of our center man who could be considered better."
hawks,3dgx6y,Pepsuber188,2,Thu Jul 16 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"I would never trade toews for anyone either, however i think crosby is a better overall player than toews. He is much more skilled offensively, a much better scorer and playmaker than toews. I also think that while toews has the advantage, crosby is much better defensively than many people think. Ovechkin is close, i go back and forth on that one but I'd say toews because what I've seen of ovi's defense is pretty bad, and i think toews is better than stamkos. Who i think really should have won it, since it's a yearly award, is price."
hawks,3dgx6y,yorozuyajin-chan,3,Thu Jul 16 17:45:25 2015 UTC,"Because its ESPN and the nominees are literally the Hart nominees, the Con Smyth winner and captain of cup winning team. I doubt they did much research."
hawks,3dgx6y,computer_monk,3,Thu Jul 16 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"How and why?.. Toews isn't the most skilled in the league for sure, but as an overall hockey player and leader he is the best. If you don't think that, or just think the best player should be the most skilled player, then you know nothing about hockey."
hawks,3dgx6y,Pepsuber188,3,Thu Jul 16 14:25:09 2015 UTC,I don't think having a different opinion on what makes a player the best warrants knowing nothing about hockey. He is an incredible leader and a great player but i believe there are other players that are better at hockey.

I would have him top 4 with doughty, Keith, and pk being better."

hawks,3di20g,TrailGrazer,20,Thu Jul 16 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"It's hard to judge Tikhonov on his last season statistics.  Apparently his dad died mid-season in 2013, and then his grandpa died mid-season in 2014. My guess both events really rattled him; and ultimately probably led to his departure from the KHL. His grandpa was the great Russia coach from the late 70's and 80's and probably had a great deal to do with his development.   Here's an example of how good he can be: In July 2013 he was named to the preliminary 35-man roster for the Russian 2014 Olympic team. He later won a gold medal in the 2014 IIHF World Championship with Russia and led the tournament in scoring.  That year he put up 16 pts in 10 games in the World Championship.    This year he took a step back, but that is probably indicative of the talent that he has when he is focused.  His floor is probably a Kris Versteeg type player for the Blackhawks.  I think he's going to come in very very focused.  He's on a make it or break it 1 year deal & he took a massive pay cut to come and play in the NHL.  I think he was making $3.5M last year and now is coming to the Hawks on a $1M 1-year deal."
hawks,3di20g,DatWhiff,8,Thu Jul 16 13:51:07 2015 UTC,"My guess is he will get some playtime with the Hawks 4th line.  I think he is hungry, motivated and because of the pay cut, cheap which we need."
hawks,3di20g,BwrightRSNA,9,Thu Jul 16 15:58:33 2015 UTC,He will most likely play on Panarin's line to keep their chemistry rolling.  Panarin will most likely slot into the 3rd line as LW.
hawks,3di20g,DatWhiff,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:53 2015 UTC,If we move Panarin to be with Tikhonov who would play LW with kane?
hawks,3di20g,BwrightRSNA,3,Fri Jul 17 16:22:55 2015 UTC,Probably Ryan Garbutt to start the season.  We also still have Bickell lying around as well.
hawks,3di20g,DatWhiff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:55 2015 UTC,Do you really think ether of them are 2nd line material?
hawks,3di20g,BwrightRSNA,3,Fri Jul 17 19:12:04 2015 UTC,Not particularly.  But Panarin probably isn't 2nd line material yet either.  Plus Quenneville loves to make the rookies earn their spot in the lineup and subsequently work their way up.
hawks,3di20g,DatWhiff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"Kane is used to carrying dead weight on his lines. Garbutt puts up decent goal numbers despite playing without decent linemates. I don't know that he is the answer but he can be a stopgap until Dano, Panarin, Tikhonov, Danault, McNeill, or Baun step up into that position. I went overboard with the list but we have quality players that are waiting for an opportunity and depending on the player all they need to do is sit in front of the net and let Kane do what he does."

As well as Jack O'Callahan."
hawks,3di20g,BeagleIL,3,Thu Jul 16 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"I think a part of it has to do with how he has played hockey in the states, most notably with the Yote's. So they bring him into camp and give him a legitimate shot to make the team as the complement to Panarin. He'll be able to help Panarin transition to life in the USA and bring out the best in him. Make up a third line of these 2 with Teuvo at center and that could be pretty potent."

hawks,3div1v,drewskyh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:56:05 2015 UTC,How are the prices?
hawks,3div1v,ChicagoIce,2,Fri Jul 17 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty reasonable. Obviously top tier guys like Toews, Kane, Hossa, etc will be up there in price, but even then you can sometimes find stuff cheaper than what it'd cost to go to a paid signing. That's not to say some stuff isn't overpriced, but definitely shop around the vendor hall. Last year I remember seeing signed Raanta and Smith pictures for 10 bucks. Also, guys who've departed over the past few years can often be had for $5-$10."

As for clothing, wearing jerseys is great and I've had conversations because of them, but any clothes should be fine."
hawks,3div1v,jenguish87,2,Fri Jul 17 00:20:42 2015 UTC,"I actually volunteered at the convention last year and I will be again this weekend. So here's how it goes:   When you get your packet you should have RFID check-in(last year it was paper badges/wristbands. Each check-in received scratch offs that had a color coordinated to a special,secret signing. You hand that to the clerk and get a pass to go to a guaranteed signing. Who that is can be difficult to determine unless you know the colors beforehand....I am not privy to that.   They are correct they:be prepared for long lines, lots of people and expensive food. Chipotle, potbellys, even the wing place a street or two over is a great choice and a hidden gem.   Be ready to sit on the floor as lines will be jam packed and be patient/friendly with the staff because they all volunteered to help make this event happen.  Also, bring some cash if you can. Last year some issues with the Internet prevented the use of cards for a few vendors. If you want to see some obscure memorabilia, check out the auctions(silent and live) and the vendors downstairs. Sometimes people will be willing to trade their autograph tickets for others so keep an open ear and eyes.   Remember to have fun, breathe and treat the players like human beings as well as your fellow convention-goers. Also, if you're interested they are selling $5 tickets to the Pre-season scrimmage that occurs in September between the entire Blackhawks team and you get to sit anywhere in the United Center, literally center ice up against the glass if you're early enough. They will sell these online but there's a ticketing few so it's best to snag a walking-rep(they will be all over the hotel, myself included) as they will have the tickets in hand to sell. This game always sells out so keep your eyes peeled if you really want to go to the game. Have a great time and maybe I'll see you there! Have a great time!"

I missed out on getting my Toews Winter Classic jersey signed by Toews himself like that last year, because I didn't bring a sharpie with me on day one. :/ You'll probably see players do that a good bit throughout the 3 days, especially for kids. I remember Crawford stayed onstage after the last event of the convention for over 5 minutes, signing as much as he could before a handler forced him to leave. Everyone else left the stage as soon as the panel ended, but yeah he stayed as long as he could, really felt his appreciation for the fans in that moment.  Anyway, have fun!!

I'm not falling asleep on the KHL players either.   As long as Toews is in charge we'll be a perennial cup contender.   I look forward to hearing more of Crawford's public speech cusses."

Of those guys;   Ladd had 38 pts Buff had 34 pts Brouwer had 40 pts Madden had 23 pts and was a solid at the dot with %53 Niemi had a 2.55 GAA   2015   Saad had 52 pts  Sharp had 43 pts Oduya had 10 pts with a plus 5 and 20 minutes of avg ice time Vermette played 19 games and had 6 pts with an additional 7 pts in the playoffs Richards had 37 pts and was %48 at the dot   So I would say they lost significantly more that offseason than this one, with arguably less immediate return. The outlook was far more bleak back then, so when I see everyone freaking out now, I both laugh and get incredibly annoyed  Edit - added what they lost this year - and added Vermette and Richards.

In 2010 we shuttled a bunch of players for cap reasons, used the kids from Rockford to fill most of the spaces, and then brought in small roleplaying guys.  Thats why we stayed successful.  This year Bowman sold out prospects and picks at the deadline, is trading away prospects to clear cap, and is getting 30year old marginal players in return.  Its not the same situation at all."
hawks,3ddz5a,philhartmonic,9,Wed Jul 15 15:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 2010 process kept us right at the top. Snuck into the playoffs on the final day of the season in 2011 and then ended up a 6 seed in 2012. Both first-round exits and neither team had any chance of a deep run.   If the Hawks repeated that process right now, they'd waste 2 years of Kane and Toews' primes. Do you want to have a chance at a cup next year, or are you happy waiting until 2018? The reason they're bringing in supposedly ""marginal"" players (i.e. established NHL players with experience) is because they can't afford to piss away two years waiting for Rockford guys to learn how to play in the NHL."
hawks,3ddz5a,odd_orange,7,Wed Jul 15 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"Isn't that what we are doing right now? Shuttling people for cap reasons...? The only difference between the two scenarios is that this is a buyer's market, not a seller's. And people aren't as willing to help out cap-strained teams."
hawks,3ddz5a,bullsfan4life,4,Wed Jul 15 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"For real.  This is why there's a salary cap, so that teams as good as the Blackhawks get broken up to maintain competitive balance.  Sure, we'd prefer it if we could keep every amazing player the Hawks develop, but that's not how the league is designed.  They made a choice to lock down Kane and Toews for the long haul, that's 28% of the salary cap on two dudes.  Crawford Hossa, Seabrook, Keith, and Hjalmarsson and you've got 64% of the cap on 7 dudes.  Throw in Bickell's fucked to death contract and you're running out of wiggle room.    It'd be great if Bowman could move Bickell, but that's 1 shit contract.  The rest of those dudes, who do you want to move so the Hawks can keep Sharp and Oduya?  Keep those 2 guys and you've got 75% of the cap on 9 players, meaning you've got $17mm to fill the other 14 roster spots.  After Bickell, you have $13mm for the other 13, and after Anisimov you have $10 for the other 12.    You'd think after 2 cups (giving Talon credit for the first) Bowman would get more of the benefit of the doubt than this."

hawks,3ddz5a,alkalinebydesign,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:47 2015 UTC,Not quite... But the cap ramifications of the Sharp trade no doubt played a role in our ability to make a run at re-signing Oduya.  We freed up very little space and we took on a couple of average-at-best players with a combined cap hit of over $4M. If we had to package our top defensive prospect with Sharp to get the trade done it sure would have been nice to clear a bit more cap space and be able to make a stronger play to retain some of our guys.

hawks,3ddz5a,ViagraAndSweatpants,2,Wed Jul 15 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"Fucking A, I try to trust Stanbo but this Dallas trade went from questionable to horrendous in my book. It breaks down to:  We traded a top 6 winger, an NHL-ready young Dman, and a solid 2nd pairing Dman  FOR  A 3rd pairing Dman and a 3rd/4th line forward who can't stay out of the penalty box. And virtually no cap relief to boot.  Fuck."
hawks,3ddz5a,Chorrbs,2,Wed Jul 15 15:23:09 2015 UTC,Why do people continue to say that we got no cap relief? If you are considering Oduya as theoretically part of that trade its  sharp (5.9AAV) + Oduya (3.75) + Johns (925K) for Daley (3.3K) + Garbutt (1.8 plus Stars retain half)  So essentially we gain around 5mil cap relief no?
hawks,3ddz5a,ISetzer,2,Wed Jul 15 15:44:20 2015 UTC,Oduya's contract was done so his didn't count in the cap.
hawks,3ddz5a,Chorrbs,8,Wed Jul 15 15:53:27 2015 UTC,By this logic you can't say that we traded him to Dallas then.
hawks,3ddz5a,rockyrococo999,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"I looked at the Daley/Oduya swap in the reverse way - instead of including Daley in the original deal, just get back a draft pick, and then we'd have the room to re-sign Oduya. Exchanging Daley for Oduya is minimal cap improvement, especially given the seeming downgrade in player quality (granted this is debatable). So in my ideal world, the trade would have been:  Sharp + Johns for Garbutt and 2016 or 2017 1st (too much? 2nd then), use resulting ~6M cap space to sign Oduya and Kruger (possibly having to make another trade or two to do this).  But I am not paid to do this for a living, so I trust the Hawks management. This just overall seemed to be unquestionably bad  in how it played out."
hawks,3ddz5a,TweetPoster,4,Wed Jul 15 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"God the f'n fantasy world people live in.  Well I would have ideally traded Sharp for Weber and had Nashville keep all but minimum salary.  Creating 5 mil in cap space.    Except the other GMs  A) Don't want to help the Hawks in any way B) are trying to get rid of their own players on bad contracts (Daley).  None of this is ideal, but acting like Stan never thought of draft picks is just idiotic."
hawks,3ddz5a,joshguy1425,0,Wed Jul 15 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"Obviously Stanbo considered all deals, so this must have been the best he could get. I didn't suggest Stanbo was all ""Wait I can ask for draft picks in return? I don't have to take players neither of us want?"" You say, and I agree, that other GMs are trying not to help the Hawks and want to unload players, and you specifically mention Daley as a contract to unload. Also, everyone generally agrees that Garbutt is not worth much. So then where did we gain in this trade? We give Sharp (not on a bad contract given term and quality of player) + Johns (NHL-ready young D prospect), and got back Daley (helps Dallas) and Garbutt (helps Dallas). Just feels like a bad return to me, especially since it was inter-division.  Also, I say 1st or 2nd rounder, and you translate that to Weber and Preds retain salary? lol. I said Sharp + Johns for Garbutt and a single 1st or 2nd round pick.  I don't think it's ridiculous to think we could have gotten a 2nd pick, or a mediocre prospect instead, and thus been able to keep Oduya."
hawks,3ddz5a,Gorphax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"The point of Weber is that this is all fantasy.  Hyperbole to prove the point.  Bowman was trying to get picks pre-draft.  Didn't happen.    This trade shows me other GMs would only take Sharp by also dropping another contract they don't want.  Specifically because they want the Hawks to continue with cap issues.  Bowman had to choose which player he'd get back and saw the most upside with Daley.  A different argument, but I think Q/Bowman didn't like Johns as much as others.  He's been the next supposed Dman for the past couple years, but TVR takes the job out of training camp last year."
hawks,3ddz5a,rockyrococo999,0,Wed Jul 15 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you think Oduya is this almighty great defensive man. He's a good 2nd pairing that is weak in the corners, doesn't want to hit, and gives up the puck in the defensive end. He looked good because the players around him made him that good. If he doesn't play on the same line as Hjammer then he is an average defenseman. Daley seems like the same type of player to me but with more offensive upside and is 2 years younger along with being 500K cheaper."
hawks,3ddz5a,rockyrococo999,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:14:37 2015 UTC,"I think Oduya is more reliable in his own end than Daley, which in my opinion, would help out this season more so that guys like Dano, Panarin, etc... can focus more on offense at first and not have to worry about pinching Dmen (Daley) causing odd man rushes the other way.  But overall you are probably right, Daley vs Oduya is a wash. My problem is if you cancel them out in the greater move here, then it's like we traded Sharp (and had to package a solid prospect in Johns) to get back Garbutt and cap space. Just seems like we could have gotten something better, but apparently that's wishful thinking."
hawks,3ddz5a,HawksNation91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:24:29 2015 UTC,Yeah that's the way it looks but you have no idea where Oduya was going to go at that time so you really can't think of him as part of it. You more or less have to think about it as that we were losing Oduya no matter what and trading Sharp helped basically keep him indirectly.

Daley is a significant drop off from Oduya; he's better on offense, but his possession numbers are god-awful.   The good news is that Anisimov should be better playing with Kane, and Dano will hopefully regress less playing with Toews/Hossa or Teuvo/Whoever plays 3RW. You'd also hope that playing with Keith or Hjammer will cause Daley to be a little better, but I'm not optimistic (and his ""highlights"" that people have posted on this sub of him are not inspiring confidence)."
hawks,3dgixe,TrailGrazer,0,Thu Jul 16 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"I too am worried about Daley's defense, but I admit I've only heard what Stars fans have been telling me. I always thought that Hammer covered up a lot of defensive liabilities that Oduya presented from time to time, and am hoping that may be able to continue with Daley."

hawks,3dgmxe,GENERIC_VULGARITY,23,Thu Jul 16 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"I love my Hawks and this may not be a popular opinion but I think our women deserved to win this award.  I'm not a soccer historian but what they did in this year's Cup run, from a defensive standpoint, was downright filthy - only giving up 3 goals the entire time (one of them an own-goal/unlucky deflection) while shutting out an offensive juggernaut in Germany and not just beating, but destroying Japan in the Finals rematch from 2011."
hawks,3dgmxe,TheGarreth,7,Thu Jul 16 04:53:39 2015 UTC,"Toews did win for Best NHL player, however. Not much more than a pretty doorstop, but still, the recognition is nice, I guess..."
hawks,3dgmxe,greeny74,11,Thu Jul 16 03:24:06 2015 UTC,And the 2nd top post in the /r/hockey thread was bitching about Carey Price not winning it.  And another guy called Toews the third best player on the Blackhawks (behind Kane and Keith)
hawks,3dgmxe,Blackhawk7,3,Thu Jul 16 04:35:05 2015 UTC,Yeah people seem convinced that Keith is better than Toews now. I mean I guess you could debate the top three on our team but I think it's funny because just one year ago everyone was complaining that he took the Norris over Weber.

hawks,3dhoy1,ClintEastwood41,3,Thu Jul 16 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"Growing up in Kansas city I didn't get a chance to watch hockey that much. Specifically because I hated everything St Louis and refused to watch the Blues. I moved to Chicago in 2004 and shortly after became a huge hockey fan once games started getting televised.   For me, the only sport was football and I had my chiefs to watch. To this day, I am still a die hard chief's fan.  However, the Hawks put hockey on my sport radar and quickly replaced football in my most loved/watched sport.  I've been to a couple games at the UC when I was able to save enough money to get standing room only tickets. The games were the funnest sporting events I have ever been to. The atmosphere was electric and the crowds were amazing. Watching the team from 2006 to now and watching the whole organization grow into what is today has been a real treat. I don't know if any organization in any other sport can pull of what the hawks have in the last 9 years.  I've never had the chance to meet any players IRL, and it would be such an amazing honor to do so. At the very least OP, thanks for reading my post."

Went last year and it was such a fun and memorable experience, bound to be amped up even more this year with the appearance of Lord Stanley. Love the hawks because it's hockey and Chicago, seeing Hull Toews Kane Magnuson Esposito Hossa Keith jerseys at the UC and every bar in the city even during the regular season, Jim Cornelison and our national anthem, Pat Foley and James Wiedeman, our amazing front office and everything they've done for the team and by extension the city since 2007, and ofc, the players. The pride they take in putting on the Indian head, playing for it and each other. Moments like this past December, broken hearted but playing for each other and for Clint, and getting that shutout...moments when they collectively decide that they just will not be beat and buckle down and get it done. I could go on forever on specifics and individual players and all so I'll just put a pin in it here: I just really love hockey and our team."

hawks,3de39e,slothtastic24,6,Wed Jul 15 22:33:25 2015 UTC,Every other team has Chicago by the balls this offseason. Everyone knows they have cap trouble and aren't just going to take on big contract players for free.

hawks,3de39e,CondorAvenue,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"Bickell is a very unpopular player around here who everyone is really disappointed in, so you will hard pressed to get a straight answer. He is just a shitty fit for our team. We paid him what we did because he was great at grinding, getting in front of the net, setting screens and hitting. Thing is, its almost like he thinks hes a sniper now, and doesn't produce anything we need. He has made some idiotic plays, but he just isn't strong in the areas we need our guys to be to be valid contributors.   Bickell has value in a more physical, albeit slower moving team. He would do well with Boston, the Blues, The Ducks, or even Buffalo or Edmonton could use that some of his experience in prepping a pretty new team. But at this point, because we need him gone, I think a 4th or 5th round pick would be the best deal we could expect, or bottom pairing Dman if we carry some salary.   Just my thoughts."

I would say a decent energy 3rd liner would be fair trade, or a 3rd round pick.  If he goes to a team with some muscle, I imagine Bickell will play his style a lot more comfortably and better."
hawks,3de39e,ChristopherT,3,Wed Jul 15 18:03:42 2015 UTC,3rd round draft pick? with that contract? I wish.   We may have to give up him and a third rounder to get a 6th at this rate.

hawks,3de39e,yorozuyajin-chan,12,Thu Jul 16 00:28:19 2015 UTC,Shaw should be untouchable unless the trade return is ridiculous.
hawks,3de39e,Badgerisbest,25,Wed Jul 15 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"There's no way Shaw is ""untouchable."" Him being packaged w/ Versteeg or Bickell would definitely hurt the Hawks winger depth, but to think that his name hasn't been floated in trade possibilities is laughable."
hawks,3de39e,tdjm,3,Wed Jul 15 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"Untouchable is a strong word but I see him as an important player that doesn't grow on trees. If his contract and money wants become ridiculous then Ya ship him off. In a game now where big thugs are becoming too slow and obsolete, I think a player with the Shaw/Marchand combo with toughness, pest, and scoring skill (so he's not a liability) are a great asset. The Hawks are never going to be a bruiser team but it's nice to have somebody.   The Hawks are a fast team and token one or two toughness guys have to keep up.   Would we be OK just getting rid of every big guy like top season form Bick and never finding a replacement? Idk.   His net presence is also unreal as far as deflections. Don't have any stats to back that up.  That's my Armchair Gm analysis."

He's a low skill energy guy.  Great to have on your team, but you dont pay them...and if someone gives you more value back, you take that deal."
hawks,3de39e,money_tester,7,Wed Jul 15 21:03:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see them getting rid of the one spark plug this team has, on top of his net presence during the pp.  He is literally the only player that isn't afraid of getting in front of the net, and caused a ton of important goals last season and playoffs.  Shaw better be untouchable."
hawks,3de39e,ChristopherT,9,Wed Jul 15 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"There are a few guys who can all ""do"" Shaw's ($2M) job at a much cheaper cost: Garbutt ($900k), Desjardins ($800k), and Hartman ($863k).   I'll throw this question out there: who would you rather have... Kruger or Shaw?   Yes, Shaw is a sparkplug, and does well to cause problems for the other team, especially in front of the net (looking at you, Bickell). But, for as tight as the Hawks are up against the cap, every little bit helps. Clearing $2M off the books gives this team more options, if that's what needs to happen."
hawks,3de39e,tdjm,8,Wed Jul 15 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Kruger. I view Shaw as being far more replaceable than Kruger.  Shaw might be good at his job, but $2M is a lot when there are so many guys within the system that can do a similar job. No one within the system (to my knowledge) is like Kruger."
hawks,3de39e,jmajewski,8,Wed Jul 15 23:41:03 2015 UTC,No question about who I would rather have.  Shaw.

hawks,3de39e,jacksonvstheworld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:24:55 2015 UTC,"I am, too. But, after laying out the cost of Shaw's contract, and them still saying they'd rather have him over several serviceable replacements at a cheaper cost, I wasn't about to go die on that hill."
hawks,3de39e,tdjm,2,Thu Jul 16 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"With you there. I would rather have Shaw as well. There is exceptional chemistry on our 4th line though, so I don't want to choose either."

hawks,3de39e,Love_Freckles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:22:15 2015 UTC,Who would actually take Bickell without the Hawks retaining salary though?  I don't know much about how other teams are stacking up in regards to the salary cap is there actually a team that would take on his contract at all anywhere in the league?
hawks,3de39e,Tenilius,8,Thu Jul 16 02:35:25 2015 UTC,"I'm think how it works is: He's RFA so he'd need to be offer sheeted. At his new salary level, which should be between 2-3M, compensation would be a 1st round pick + something. It is unlikely a team would give up a 1st round for a 4C. So Hawks will probably be able to sign him. But I think he can elect for arbitration at any time during the summer, which he is currently opting out of because he wants to sign for the long term. If arbitration fails then he becomes UFA and we're pretty much screwed.   Someone correct me if I'm wrong, this stuff is confusing as hell..."
hawks,3de39e,yorozuyajin-chan,9,Wed Jul 15 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"Kruger can't elect for arbitration. That deadline passed, on July 5th, at which point he made the statement, to which you alluded, about avoiding arbitration and wanting to stay long term."
hawks,3de39e,tempestatic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:03 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Thought they can elect arbitration anytime during negotiation. Yay. So he's going to stay unless an offer sheet comes in right? Just terms of the contract to hash out. THAT is a sign of relief...
hawks,3de39e,yorozuyajin-chan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"Well, there's always the possibilty that Krugs goes back to Europe if we can't free enough money for him.  But we would still have his rights, so of/when he'd come back, it'd have to be to Chicago."
hawks,3de39e,DwayneSmith,5,Thu Jul 16 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"This all actually makes me feel a lot better. Okay boys, this season we could see some magic (Dano, TT, Panarin line?) And our top priority next off season...signing Seabrook, so he can retire as a Hawk."
hawks,3de39e,ChristopherT,5,Wed Jul 15 17:20:29 2015 UTC,I hope that is what they are planning with Seabs.

hawks,3de39e,CondorAvenue,2,Wed Jul 15 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no way it goes over 3.65 so probably a 2nd round. Think anybody would go for it? Unless somebody is willing to overpay, reasonably Kruger should be around 2.5-2.75M, hard to believe Hawks won't match that for him."

hawks,3de39e,CondorAvenue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:20 2015 UTC,I think we have $2.7m
hawks,3de39e,MidgetLovingMaxx,2,Wed Jul 15 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"nope, way less.  and this doesnt include the 750k in cap penalties or Panarin's contract"
hawks,3de39e,CondorAvenue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that number does include Morin, so you can basically make the one-for-one trade between him and Panarin."
hawks,3de39e,tdjm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"True but there are still 2 roster spots to be filled - if you assume Kruger is one, there is still one roster spot to fill.  Bring up Gustafsson as our 7th D and we would have -450k in space and Kruger to sign.  Or if we could ship out a third or fourth to trade bickell, we'd have just enough space to bring Kruger back"
hawks,3de39e,CondorAvenue,0,Wed Jul 15 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"$981,540 in cap space. The Hawks need to get Kruger re-signed, and probably w/ a raise. Kruger made $1.4M last season, and $1.2M the season before that.   They technically need at least 21, and no more than 23. Right now, they're at 21. Add Kruger, and it's 22. Dano and Teuvo are the only two on the Hawks roster w/ 2-way contracts. So, if they want to bring someone up from the AHL, they'll need to send one of those two guys down (won't happen). Or, they'll have to get someone like Morin through waivers (probably likely)."
hawks,3de39e,tdjm,3,Thu Jul 16 15:19:36 2015 UTC,981 in cap space before the 750k in penalties.  And Panarin needs to be up or he can go back to russia and he's now one of our best wingers
hawks,3de39e,CondorAvenue,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, the penalties. I think I pulled a Bowman and forgot about those.   Ninja edit: Adios Morin. It's been real."

hawks,3de6vv,stancehunters,2,Wed Jul 15 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"He played 68 games in Rockford last year, so he's close. And only 21.  He was introduced at the rally this year as part of the ""future"" (if that means anything) so he's definitely still relevant and should expect his time at the NHL to be sooner than later."
hawks,3de6vv,jmajewski,2,Wed Jul 15 23:46:48 2015 UTC,"While interesting, some of this is because they were on entry level contracts and moved on to big boy contracts.  Another interesting comparison would have been what's the average AAV jump of a player from entry level to first big contract, and do Hawks players traded or signed to other clubs end up getting a bigger AAV jump because they came from a perennial winner, and how much?"
hawks,3de6vv,scrumtralecent,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, no doubt the jump from entry level to first big payday skews the scale. Just thought this was worth a look. But guys liek Byfuglien, Laad, Versteeg, Frolik, Bolland, and Leddy are past that entry level deal. And Niemi and Saad certainly benefitted in getting the first big contract a little higher by having Stanley Cup Champion in front of their name.  It would certainly be interesting to compare to other teams, but also a lot more research, ha."
hawks,3de6vv,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:37 2015 UTC,There is also the chance that some of their play is elevated due to being surrounded by a fuck ton of talent....or we're just better at developing players haha

There was a group of guys pointing at the Hawks sweater I was wearing, but they weren't speaking English. Then one of them spoke up and asked if I was going to the game the next day. I told them I was, and asked if they were going as well. They said yes. I started talking to them, they told me they were from Sweden - really nice, friendly guys. Turns out, the reason they were going to the game was because they were close friends of Oduya's and that they were headed to meet up with him for dinner. He had flown them out, along with some other friends and family. They told me I should come meet up with them after they were done with dinner, and while it was a tempting offer to get to meet a current Hawk, I felt like I would have been intruding on him just catching up with his friends. While I didn't meet him personally, it still was cool to meet people that Oduya surrounded himself with, and he just seemed like a really cool guy both on and off the ice. He will be missed."

And go figure it's just as the new salary cap comes into being and we lose so many of these familiar faces.  Over the years these guys have become regulars in my life, almost like friends, and to see them disappearing or heading off to different places is pretty tough to digest.  I know there will be others.  I know we'll fill those gaps and I'll get to know the next group of players Bowman and crew see fit to welcome into the family, but damn, this kind of sucks right now."

If that happens they basically raped us."
hawks,3dabqk,MidgetLovingMaxx,3,Tue Jul 14 19:10:04 2015 UTC,But wouldn't you still take this hawks team over Dallas every time?
hawks,3dabqk,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,7,Tue Jul 14 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"Id take the forward core over last years team even.  Defensive depth proved a huge liability in the post season, and weve gotten far worse in that regard."
hawks,3dabqk,MidgetLovingMaxx,4,Tue Jul 14 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"With so many young, unproven guys on this team. I don't know.  Dallas essentially has:  1) A top 6 winger to compliment Benn and Seguin (That line would be filthy)  2) A defenseman who could anchor their young and inexperience defense  3) A defensive prospect who could turn out to be a stud (Our top prospect Stephen Johns)  4) Another goalie to compliment Lehtonen. Essentially a 1A 1B goalie.  Lehntonen's biggest problem was that he couldn't handle many starts. You could see him faltering off. With Niemi there, it would be a good duo.  We could be looking up on Dallas come next season."
hawks,3dabqk,GuyOnTheLake,7,Tue Jul 14 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think Oduya is going to anchor a young and inexperienced defense. He lived off of Hammer covering for his mistakes. If he's the guy in charge, I don't think he will shine as well."

hawks,3dabqk,needsmorepepper,2,Tue Jul 14 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but you'd really need to include what Oduya signs for if you want a fair comparison. Also, we got 2.5m in cap space, not 1.7m (Dallas retained 50% of Garbutt's cap hit).   All in all, the trade would be Sharp, Johns, and Oduya for Daley, Garbutt, and around 7.5m in cap space."
hawks,3dabqk,kmallon12,10,Tue Jul 14 21:33:57 2015 UTC,Not surprised. Now re-sign Kurger and trade Bickell

hawks,3dabqk,STLL217,47,Tue Jul 14 19:44:58 2015 UTC,we don't need to overpay for a 33 year old aging one dimensional dman. This is fine guys. Now we can resign Kruger. 5 mil a year for Oduya is way way way too much.
hawks,3dabqk,djb2287,7,Tue Jul 14 19:28:30 2015 UTC,But did we really need Garbutt and Daley on our team? They still cost us the cap. Cap that we could have easily give to Kruger and Oduya.
hawks,3dabqk,GuyOnTheLake,26,Tue Jul 14 19:44:51 2015 UTC,"I wish we'd actually give Daley a chance to impress us. I'm not impressed by Butts but Daley could have the offensive talent to move the puck way better than Johnny ever could. He's three years younger and takes less cap space.  I know he sucked with the Stars last year, but pairing him up with someone who can carry him such as Hammer (like he did with Oduya) and we might actually see Daley flourish in our system. I'm not saying it was a great trade, but at least one of the assets we received has the chance to shine."
hawks,3dabqk,chocolate_chip_kelly,3,Tue Jul 14 19:52:40 2015 UTC,"Seriously. We have so much talent and a great coaching staff that players can thrive under limited roles. It's not just coincidence that we can put together a good team every year. Comparing Oduya before he was a hawk and Daley now is a much more interesting comparison, IMO"
hawks,3dabqk,Dr_imfullofshit,3,Tue Jul 14 21:23:30 2015 UTC,"Did we need them? Probably not.  Could have used that money elsewhere.  But was Dallas going to make the Sharp trade without having us take something from them?  Highly doubtful.  They weren't going to just say, ""Oh, you're the defending Stanley Cup champions, and your fans want you to resign your team better? Here, let me help you do that, and I'll eat more of my own cap space in the process.""    Each team is jockeying for the best position they can to bring the most talent to their own teams."
hawks,3dabqk,ShanktimusPrime,-5,Tue Jul 14 22:36:14 2015 UTC,Well we still have to pay someone to play defense and since Stan traded away the majority of the prospect pool options arent looking really great.
hawks,3dabqk,MidgetLovingMaxx,11,Tue Jul 14 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"Pokka, TVR, Svedberg, Forsling are all quality D prospects, man. I assume it was hyperbole, but he has not traded a majority of our prospect pool. Oduya was a solid D man in the playoffs but had a weak year. His price is driven up by the cup, as is his perceived value. He is not worth 5 to us, because we are cap strapped, don't need his veteran experience cause we have lots of that, and have enough top talent to cover mistakes by less experienced people.   Everyone is judging Cuminsky, Rundblad and TVR by their performance in the playoffs. Prospects and rookies should not be evaluated by how they performed when they went from the AHL to the deep rounds of the playoffs. Give them some time this season to acclimate to the big show."
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,2,Tue Jul 14 19:45:21 2015 UTC,TVR is no longer a prospect
hawks,3dabqk,bud1316,3,Tue Jul 14 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"How do you define a prospect? I have gone with the following:  A player will be considered a prospect until he meets the following criteria:  If a prospect is a skater (forward, defenseman) and has played in 65 NHL games or more before the completion of the season of his 24th birthday; or, if a goaltender has played in 45 NHL games before the completion of the season of his 24th birthday, that player will be considered graduated to the NHL. Conversely, if a player completes the season of his 24th birthday without passing those milestones, then that player will no longer be considered a prospect by Hockey’s Future, regardless of the player’s status with his NHL club.  Seems a fair way to distinguish."
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,3,Tue Jul 14 20:12:07 2015 UTC,He's not at prospect camp?
hawks,3dabqk,yorozuyajin-chan,2,Tue Jul 14 21:23:31 2015 UTC,But Dano is. Do you consider him prospect? What about Pokka? He wasn't there either...
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:33:52 2015 UTC,"Dano probably, since Hawks coaching team still have to check him out and see how he fits into the Hawks system.   Somehow I missed the fact that Pokka isn't at prospects camp. Any reason why he wouldn't be there? Definitely confused."

hawks,3dabqk,bud1316,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but seems silly to debate a thing when we define it in different terms.   I personally consider them prospects until they make the roster for sure next year. I agree they likely will, but until they do, they are our top prospects that are just transitioning to their rookie seasons.   Beyond the definition of the term, I feel the prospect pool for defence has been used to keep us cup ready now via trade. We needed to bundle quality to sweeten the deals we have pulled off. I know many of them are contentious, but I like our pickups and realize that the price we paid is part of being cap stretched champions. NHL ready prospect is a different beast than promising defensive prospect.   I guess in the end, I trust the entire Blackhawks organization to properly assess our players and ensure they are mitigating the necessary loss that comes with maintaining a championship ready team."
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,0,Tue Jul 14 20:52:32 2015 UTC,"TVR is a roster player.  Cumiskey is 28.  Rundblad wasnt thrown in to the post season, he played over half of the regular season.  Svedberg isnt a quality prospect.  Bowman traded the majority of NHL-ready defenseman.  Johns Dahlbeck and Paliotta all could have filled roles this year or next.  Pokka and Forsling are several years away.  Gustavsson is probably closest to ready right now."
hawks,3dabqk,MidgetLovingMaxx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:12:37 2015 UTC,"TVR is almost assuredly on the roster, but no one knows yet. I don't care how old Cumiskey is, and Rundblad didn't play half the season, although he did have a lot of NHL experience. They weren't part of our regular lineup, and they had not seen playoffs that deep before.   It seems so widely accepted by fans, media and the rest of the hockey world that we do so well in the playoffs because we have all this experience, yet everyone gets up in arms when we trade away prospects. There is a wide spectrum of experience on our team, and this season our top pairing will be two 3 time champs, second pairing looks like Daley and Hjarm, and the third will be TVR and Rundblad/Cumiskey. Say what you want about Daley, I personally would rather have an experienced NHL defensemen than a prospect, and Oduya wasn't worth his cap hit this season."
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:06:20 2015 UTC,I feel calling Svedberg quality is a stretch.
hawks,3dabqk,The_Poochinski,2,Tue Jul 14 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"Why? He's not terrible, showing improvement is massive with decent mobility for his size. Decent +/-. Not saying hes ready for the show, just that we don't have an empty pool of prospects."
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:28:07 2015 UTC,I'd be happier if he used his size more. The man is a giant but 80% of the time plays soft. He has potential but not enough to get excited about.

Further, I think teams are learning how to tie us up and the solution Bowman seems to be pursuing is greater physicality. Johnny isn't much help there. All in all, I don't feel Oduya is that great a defenseman and I'm really kind of excited to see how Daley pairs with Hjammer."

The bottom two, we have an entire season to see what we have in our young guys.  We didn't have cap to give Oduya what he's worth. We'll be fine.   We just won a cup with 4 dmen, lets get to camp before we all start freaking out. 3 in 6....our staff knows what they are doing. Relax people."

hawks,3dabqk,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,2,Tue Jul 14 19:22:14 2015 UTC,Daley + Hammer? I think they could complement each other well and be a productive pairing. At least that's what I'm telling myself.
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,2,Tue Jul 14 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"I see that myself, and I think it could be a great. Maybe I am just being overly optimistic, but I felt Oduya lost a step this year, and Daley could fill that role very nicely.   The more days go by, and the more I have read and spoke with educated fans, I have come to believe this is a great move. Q is a better coach with a better system, there is less pressure on Daley, Crow is a better netminder, and the rest of the team plays defensively as is.   Daley may be a liability in the mind of many a hawks fan, but I am super excited and think we got a ton better with him."
hawks,3dabqk,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for agreeing and having faith! If you want a coach who will maximize a player's potential, I truly believe Q has been the man. Sure he makes questionable lineup decisions sometimes, but he has the hardware to back it up. I'm really bummed to see Sharp, Saad, Richards, Vermy and Oduya leave, but I'm also really exited for our young, revamped team with key pieces intact. I'm confident that in our system Dano, Panarin, Tikhonov, Anisimov and Daley can shine alongside our core players. Personally, I think our team has gotten younger, bigger and probably better. Can't wait to see this team on the ice."
hawks,3dabqk,GENERIC_VULGARITY,3,Tue Jul 14 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I get the apprehension, but in the end I love they players who play for the hawks. I wish we could keep everyone. But we have a cap, and we have to pick only the best at our disposal. Johnny O was great for us, but hes on the decline. Sharp is awesome, but we had to move him to fill other needs. No matter how great a player is, Blackhawks > any one player.   I appreciate what Oduya, Saad and especially Sharp did. Great players that helped us get to where we are. Vermette was a rental and Richards scored a cup so I feel those were fair exchanges.   We will be better next year, and have the pieces in place to be the first back to back champs since the cap became a factor."

hawks,3decow,wickerwacker,9,Wed Jul 15 16:42:25 2015 UTC,Just watch as Daley flourishes while playing with Hjalmarsson (or whomever). Oduya wasn't highly regarded before he was a hawk either.
hawks,3decow,colony26,3,Wed Jul 15 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"He was something like a minus 20 for his career in Winnipeg/Atlanta, and then started to play well next to one of the elite cover defensemen in the game, and I really think the same will happen for Daley, except he has more offensive upside."
hawks,3decow,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,7,Wed Jul 15 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"I think Schilling's more or less failed to crack the Caps roster 3 years running and played on their AHL team the whole time.   Don't know much about Pokka except that he's still really young and short of a big performance in camp, I'd guess he'd be better off back in Rockford.  I suppose either of them could be a 7th d man, if you wanted Schilling to fill Cumiskey's spot, or if you wanted to try and develop Pokka at the NHL level.  I think cautious is the feeling I'm having with both TVR, still rebounding from injuries and Rundblad, for whom the word ""inconsistent"" keeps coming to mind. Of course, I'm a fan, so cautiously optimistic is probably a more accurate feeling, hoping that Rundblad can develop consistency with more experience and that TVR and fully recover."

hawks,3decow,ohmylantern20,2,Wed Jul 15 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"About Pokka, I can say he has already played like 2 full mature seasons in Finland's Elite League (Liiga) before moving to AHL. His hands and game IQ are damn good and according to reports the switch to small rink has felt good and hasn't affected his game negatively. The 2013-2014 with Kärpät in Finland was just awesome, he played like an experienced #1 D and eventually they won the championship that year! He was the best D in playoffs and posted 2+9=11points in 16 matches.  He certainly looked to be ready-to-go casual top D in the big rink and maybe a year in AHL and + good (hard) summer will make him physically capable of playing in the NHL. Then there's Q, who isn't known for bringing rookies in from the beginning of the season. No idea why he isn't in prospect camp right now but I bet he'll be there when the main roster gathers to a camp.  I'd bet for Pokka's start in AHL and to get first NHL games November-December and then perhaps a longer or permanent visit in spring.  Greetings from Finland! Btw I kind of know Teuvo and been following his career for long so you bet I've been watching every single game he played live (mostly 3-4am here). And at last, I'm going to see the Stanley Cup as we're going to attend to Kimmo Timonen SC party in his hometown Kuopio!  Go Hawks!!!"

Hammer is easily top 5 DFD in the league, if anyone would be on a line with someone as aggressive as Daley, it would be him. Plus he's our best at defending 2 on 1s (he has that ""slide across the ice so you can block the passing lane and the shooting lane at the same time"" thing down to a science) and from what I hear from Dallas fans, Daley's antics result in a lot of 2 on 1s the other way"

It's hard to explain to someone who has a certain perspective why it's ""acceptable"" to fight teammates. I've fought plenty of teammates in training camps and during the season. It's personal, it's competitive, it's like anything. Imagine a person in your work place who annoys the fuck out of you. Your reaction may be to work circles around them..... You're a goal scorer. Your reaction is to go tell the boss..... You're probably a captain, or an alternate. Or you want to confront them.... In the office people do it with words; on the rink, we did it with fists. Words suck because then you develop a reputation of being ""difficult/emotional/weird"" etc.... With fists.... Well, fewer problems crop up throughout the day.   Does this help?"

hawks,3d9ojw,Patrick_Kane,3,Tue Jul 14 16:21:28 2015 UTC,"I got drunk with Dino at a wedding last summer and talked hockey for about an hour. Funny how having a few beers with a guy that you hated growing up calms the waters.   Here's a good article on our old Norris division rivalry.   Al Secord, Dino Ciccarelli — when a hockey rivalry had some real bad blood  Get ready for a war.  Well, not really.  A fight? Probably not.  Wakey-wakey? Don’t count on it.  The Blackhawks’ second-round playoff series with the Minnesota Wild is a rivalry devoid of bad blood — which some old-schoolers might say doesn’t make it much of a rivalry at all. The Hawks and Wild have played 23 times in the past three seasons — including the playoffs in 2013 and 2014 — yet the familiarity has bred only respect. For those who anticipated a series of knock-down drag-out games with the Blues, this second-round matchup is a disappointment. It’s all about hockey.  “Sometimes it’s like that,” Hawks captain Jonathan Toews said. “It comes down to not only respect, but just playing hockey. It’s about both teams doing what they have to to win.”  The days of villainous playoff hockey seem to be dwindling by the year. The Hawks’ own Andrew Shaw tried to spice up the Nashville series. But his 32 minutes of penalties ignited nothing and elicited nary a word of ill feelings between the teams. The days of Dave Bolland goading the Canucks into undermining themselves with undisciplined hockey seem like part of a bygone era.  Neither the Hawks nor the Wild are built for that kind of thing. Shaw’s team-leading 67 penalty minutes were tied for 67th in the NHL this season. The Wild’s Marco Scandella was tied for 83rd with 56 (though former Blues forward Chris Stewart could be a wild-card). When the Hawks and Wild played in the second-round last season, the teams combined for 31 penalties in six games.  “Some teams, it’s their tactic to try and take guys off their game with big hits and stuff after the whistle and antagonizing and that sort of thing,” Toews said. “Some teams, you don’t have that. It doesn’t mean that there’s not hatred and not some type of rivalry there — those are the things you notice and make you really hate other teams, especially when you’ve been through a playoff series against them. We know we’ve got to be ready for this one, because it’s going to be a really tough challenge for us.”  It wasn’t always this way. As pre-Kane/Toews era Hawks fans remember, the Hawks had a rivalry with the Minnesota North Stars in the 1980s and early 90s that was not only filled with hatred, but fueled by it. Here’s how different of an era it was: the two classic villains of arguably the most heated rivalry in the game — the Hawks’ Al Secord and the North Stars’ Dino Ciccarelli — both were 50-goal scorers in the NHL. Hawks’ Hall of Fame center Denis Savard once was given a gross misconduct penalty against the North Stars … for pulling hair. Two years earlier, Savard was ejected from a game against Minnesota for waving his stick in the face of North Stars coach Glen Sonmor.  “It was nasty,” said Eddie Olczyk, who played for the Hawks during the heart of the classic Hawks-North Stars rivalry from 1984-87. “It was intense. It was for keeps. Back in the day, you were going to be in for a physical verbal and old-fashioned [battle]. If you were going to beat us on the scoreboard, we were going to beat you by intimidating and dropping our gloves.”  “You learned quickly,” said Troy Murray, who played parts of 12 seasons for the Hawks from 1982-1994. “I had no hatred for the North Stars when I came in. But you quickly found out that you hated the North Stars. You just hated the North Stars.”  And that hatred was cherished, and preserved. It was that important to dislike the North Stars.  “I remember Al Secord one time when we were out downtown,” Murray said, “we heard walking in [to a bar] that there were some Minnesota players there. And Al Secord would not go into the bar, because he didn’t want to become friends with any of their players. He didn’t want to get to know them personally. So we wouldn’t go in there.”  The Hawks played the North Stars in four consecutive playoffs from 1982-95 and six times in 10 years from 1982-91. The intensity of the rivalry led to some huge upsets. In 1982, the North Stars won the Norris Division and were 22 points better than the fourth-place Blackhawks. But the Hawks won a brutal playoff series 3-1. In 1990-91, the Hawks won the President’s Trophy with 106 points, but infamously lost to the North Stars in the first round, 4-2. The North  Stars, who had finished fourth in the Norris with 68 points, parlayed that upset into a berth in the Stanley Cup Final, where they lost to the Penguins.  “The rivalry and the way the game was played back then,” Murray said, “physical intimidation was a huge part of whether you beat a team in a series or not.”  Long-time Hawks fans are intimately familiar with the Hawks-North Stars rivalry because they literally were a part of it. In Game 3 of the 1982 playoff series, fights in the stands at Chicago Stadium marred an already brutal game on the ice. It took police to help security to help Andy Frain ushers to restore order. Fans threw debris on the ice — mostly pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. And Darryl Sutter tripped over a coin, slammed into the boards and suffered a dislocated shoulder.  It wouldn’t be the last time the fans became a real part of the rivalry with the North Stars.  “I remember a game where a fight broke out in the stands — and it was Minnesota fans [fighting Hawks fans,” Murray said. “And they stopped the game. We stopped and we were sitting on our sticks on the ice watching the fight in the stands. Not only was the rivalry on the ice. The hatred was in the stands.”  The Hawks-North Stars rivalry is littered with unflattering moments. In the opener of the 1982 playoff series, the teams combined for 125 minutes of penalties — in the first period. A 1984 brawl lasted 49 minutes. In Game of the 1985 playoffs, the North Stars’ Harold Snepsts mugged Olczyk 28 seconds into the game. (""I remember that,"" Olczyk said. ""And I remember Curt Fraser jumping in there and grabbing Snepsts."") Murray recalled a game where there was a full-scale brawl before the opening puck drop. The North Stars’ Ron Friest once was given a game misconduct for head-butting Steve Larmer. “I guess I went a little psycho,” Friest explained.  That typified the Hawks-North Stars rivalry. It turned the competitors into combatants. The 6-1, 195-pound Murray, a non-fighter, remembered a game against the North Stars in which he got into a fight with 6-5, 225-pound Dave Richter just seven seconds after he took the opening faceoff. Richter drilled Murray with two hard lefts that opened huge cuts around both eyes, and without one of his contact lenses. The next morning, both of Murray’s eyes were so swollen that he couldn’t see.  “It was because of the atmosphere in the building. It was crazy,” Murray said. “It was so intense, you could cut it with a knife. I got so caught up in the moment that here I am fighting a 6-foot-5, 225-pound guy that I have no business fighting.  “But that’s what it was all about. It was crazy. In those series there were more villains than heroes. Now there are more heroes than villains.”  But it wasn't all blood and guts. There was some great hockey and memorable moments for the Hawks. They beat the North Stars in 1982 (3-1), when 38-year-old Tony Esposito started in Game 4 and won the clincher 4-2; they won again in the 1983 division finals (4-1), with Rich Preston scoring an overtime winner in a 4-3 victory in Game 4 at the Met Center that gave the Hawks a 3-1 series lead; they won a memorable 1985 division final in six games, when the final three games were decided in overtime: Darryl Sutter scored on a rebound of a Tom Lysiak shot in double-overtime to win Game 4 (7-6); the North Stars' Dennis Maruk won Game 6 (5-4); and  Sutter became the first Hawk with two overtime game-winners in the same series when he scored off a nifty pass from Lysiak and beat a block attempt by Snepsts and goalie Don Beupre at 15:41 of overtime for a 6-5 victory that clinched the series.  Troy Murray's goal with 4:57 left in regulation — coming out of the penalty box, of course — sent it to overtime.  Now, that was a war.  ""They had size and toughness,"" Olczyk said. ""Going into those games, you had to put the hard-hat on and [know that] intimidation was going to be a part of it. That Darryl Sutter goal in overtime — Tom Lysiak dropped it … across the blue line … I remember Pat Foley’s call was ‘Darryl Sutter does it again,’ because that was his second overtime winner in the series.”  In all, the Hawks won four of the six playoff series with the North Stars during that brutal, wonderful era when animosity was the name of the game. The won a first-round series in seven games in 1990 en route to the conference final against the Oilers (where they lost). The North Stars won a first-round series with the big upset in 1991 that catapulted them to the Cup Final against the Penguins.  “The toughness. The rivalry. It was incredible,” Murray said. “As soon as you stepped into the Blackhawks locker room, and the first time you played Minnesota, you knew it was something special. We played Minnesota one year in the playoffs and had a 5-on-5 fight in the series. Back in the day, you could still smoke in the old [Chicago] Stadium. There was a cloud of smoke at the top of the building.  And the building would shake.  “It was good. I loved the hockey. It really was a game where you had to compete.”"

Carcillo I can see him coming back because he is well liked in the locker room (the reason he was signed last year) but I think it is very possible he retires. Considering his concussion history and how his relationship with Steve Montador has effected him, it would not surprise me if he hung them up. That being said, I hadn't heard anything about wether he was not playing in the playoffs as a Coach Q hockey decision or a medical one."
hawks,3dbz1d,sonicscrewdriveher,3,Wed Jul 15 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"Am I alone in thinking Pokka could be our 6th? I just really am not a fan of Runblad or Cumisky. Im still pissed that we traded Johns. Now Pokka is really our closest D to make the jump. I can see Hammer and Seabs taking Pokka under their wings. Start having the vets showing the new guys (TVR, Pokka) the ropes. And absolutely not thrilled about Daley."
hawks,3db1vs,PROFANITY_IS_BAD,4,Tue Jul 14 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"It all depends on salary cap, whose contracts are up for renegotiation, and what the front office feels the team needs to continue being successful. This year was bloody because the Hawks were pretty much already against the salary cap when off season began, and here's a breakdown of the reason behind major changes:   Saad's contract was up for renegotiation and his performance the last few seasons meant he was now worth more than what we could pay him in our current salary cap situation (and he evidently didn't want to take a discount like he'd hinted shortly after they won the cup).    -Sharp had to go because he's taking up almost $6 mil in cap space (which is a lot for us) and I think it's safe to say he just hasn't been as productive lately.   -Oduya was also up for renegotiation and ultimately chose to not resign because again our cap space is such that we can't pay him what he feels he's worth.   -Hopefully we also see Bickell leave this post season, because he's got another big money contract and just isn't contributing in a way that reflects that. Unfortunately these are exactly the reasons we'll have a hard time getting rid of him. Don't be surprised if you see him go for next to nothing.   Basically, the long and short of it is, cap space ultimately controls who the team can afford to sign and resign. Toews and Kane have huge contracts that eat a lot of cap space, but that's the cost of having that kind of talent. We may see another nasty offseason next year as we have some other big names up for renegotiation. We have a lot of prospects though, and our organization seems to be good at growing young guys into what we need to be continually successful. As long as our core is in tact, I think we'll continue to be competitive at the cup level.   Sorry for the long answer, hope that helps!"
hawks,3db1vs,sonicscrewdriveher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:08:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! Are other teams going through similar stuff? It sounds like it's time to review the cap and raise it a bit.
hawks,3db1vs,ebenz87,3,Wed Jul 15 11:41:09 2015 UTC,It all depends on the Canadian dollar.
hawks,3db1vs,TheSignPost,2,Wed Jul 15 12:17:51 2015 UTC,"You add up all of the money for ticket sales for all of the teams, divide by a magic number that was agreed to by the NHL and the players association, and that's the cap number. There's also a ""floor"" number, which the team needs to spend a minimum. This year was interesting, because of the fluctuation of the Canadian currency, the value of the Canadian teams' ticket sales were less. Each team has its own financial concerns."
hawks,3db1vs,sonicscrewdriveher,2,Wed Jul 15 12:31:23 2015 UTC,"Some teams are, some aren't. It was actually raised this year a bit. It's up to the NHLPA, I think, I'm not 100% sure how that part works. But remember, Toews and Kane have two of the largest contracts in the league, other teams aren't necessarily carrying a cap weight like that, and certainly not for two players. That makes a big difference for us. So many teams are struggling far less with cap than we are, but we've won three cups since 2010, so there's the tradeoff."
hawks,3db1vs,ClintEastwood41,3,Wed Jul 15 13:43:09 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the Hawks family, and no it doesn't.  Our problem is that we have done such an amazing job at drafting and finding hidden gems in the prospect pool they are all becoming stars and we just don't have the cap to sign them all so 3 cups later we are just having to rebuild our depth basically.  In all honesty we are still pretty deep in Rockford and I think some people will be surprised what Hartman, McNeil, Pokka, and others will do if given the chance."
hawks,3db1vs,helpful_shawn_,4,Wed Jul 15 14:22:15 2015 UTC,Right. Isn't Stan Bowman the fucking worst?!?!?  This indicates sarcasm
hawks,3db1vs,cubbiblue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"No. We had cap issues, expiring contracts that needed to be resigned and players we wouldn't be able to resign based on their value vs current contract.   If you look at most teams that win a championship, they try to keep the core but will lose role players or guys who outperform their contract. If you win it all, there are going to be several players who deserve pay days!  It's weird to think about it, but we were actually the ""old team"" in the Cup this year."
hawks,3db1vs,curious_Jo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:45:20 2015 UTC,"We lost 7 players in 2010 after the Cup win and we manage to rebuild and win two more in 2013 and 2015. So expect 2-3 years of mediocracy(first round exits bearly make the playoffs). But we will be back stronger than ever.  In Teows and Kane we trust, literally with our cap space."

hawks,3d9rzk,breadbeard,7,Tue Jul 14 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"Shaw and Versteeg are different beasts.  Shaw is a 200k less cap-hit, yes.  But the future of their contracts makes Shaw worth more to the Hawks.  Next year Shaw is an RFA and is currently only making $2m.  Next year Versteeg is a UFA and while he's only a $2.2m cap hit, he's actually making $4.4m because FLA is still retaining some of his salary.    I'd pull the trigger on Steeg in a minute.  Prior to the last few months, wouldn't have considered Shaw, but since Stan traded away 3 d-prospects in 4 months he'd definitely be in play."
hawks,3d9rzk,MidgetLovingMaxx,3,Tue Jul 14 17:13:03 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said plus we have skilled Right wingers to fill his shoes like Hartman (who is described as being like Shaw) and McNeil who is a very skilled 1st round pick.
hawks,3d9rzk,ClintEastwood41,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would trade Versteeg as well for sure, I'm just thinking that in this scenario that can't get the deal done. Or I would assume that because I would think Bowman has already tried this package and isn't seeing a possible deal with anyone. For the exact reasons you give as to why Shaw is who you would rather keep if you're the Hawks is why he is a more interesting to the trading partner in this hypothetical deal."
hawks,3d9rzk,jecs,6,Tue Jul 14 17:30:42 2015 UTC,Without hesitation. People forget how valuable top 4 dmen are because we've been spoiled. Oduya and hammer can play the shut down role as well as many 1/2 pairs
hawks,3d9rzk,badseedjr,6,Tue Jul 14 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"Not Shaw.  I like Oduya, but he was much improved by the Hawks system.  No reason Daley can't see similar improvement.  Garbutt can go instead though :)."
hawks,3d9rzk,jmr33090,3,Tue Jul 14 16:47:18 2015 UTC,Oh totally agreed that Oduya improved due to the system. I'm thinking how solid the blue line would be with both Oduya and Daley on it and how important Kruger is to the success of the entire 4th line.
hawks,3d9rzk,jakenstein1331,2,Tue Jul 14 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. I would miss Shaw, but he is replaceable, especially with our forward depth. Defense is our weak link at the moment, but if Oduya comes back, we could have one of the strongest blue lines in the league top to bottom."

At least we know he can add to our already dominate offense. If he can learn to play defense too, then he'll be fine."

hawks,3d569a,OG-buddha,29,Tue Jul 14 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"In order:   Kruger is easily the most important piece missing. Would prevent us from having to play Morin, Tropp, or Garbutt and gives us some room in case players like Panarin or Tikhonov don't work out. Those have to be some ridiculous strings to sign Oduya. We're going to be over the cap after the Kruger signing, and I have no idea how much Oduya is going to want. He's 33, so you'd assume this is his last pay day. I'd say the team has the potential to be better than when they won the cup. Anisimov is an upgrade over Richards, but other than that, everyone is up in the air. Tikhonov and Teuvo are probably not as good as Vermette at center just yet. Saad and Sharp were proven top-line players; who's playing with Toews and Hossa next year? The unproven Dano? Panarin, who will likely suffer through some growing pains? Bickell or Versteeg, assuming one of them stays? To say they're better now assumes that Dano can step into the top-LW role, Panarin's transition goes smoothly, and Teuvo can pick up the 3C role easily.  People were broken up over trading Sharp because of the history he's had with us; the loss of talent hurts, but it's mainly the memories. The real problem wasn't losing Sharp, it was losing the NHL-ready Stephen Johns and getting garbage in return. Losing Johns makes us really weak on defense if we can't re-sign Odouya. We still need to move Bickell and/or Versteeg (depending on if we re-sign Odouya). We had to include a top prospect to move Sharp, a top-line winger who's won 3 cups and put up 50+ points since 09-10 and 25+ goals since 08-09 before this year (excluding the lockout). What do we need to include to move Bickell, who was so bad this year and in the playoffs he was healthy scratched. Pokka? Hartman? Danault? Multiple picks, including a first rounder? Or heaven forbid, Teravainen? This is why people are nervous; we still have a lot of cap to dump and very few buyers."

hawks,3d569a,badlions,3,Tue Jul 14 11:28:44 2015 UTC,"I think I'm in the minority, but why the incredible need to keep Kruger? Don't get me wrong, I think he is an above average 4th line center (13m/game TOI), but I'd rather have a reliable 4th dman like Oduya (23m/game TOI) than a 4th line center. Kruger is great on the PK, but he can't score, can't pass, and isn't good on the dot. I have a hard time believing they can't find a vet to come play for a cup for the vets minimum?  Clearly they should just sign Ditka, then clone Ditka, and have a 4th line of Ditkas.  p.s. Regarding the cap, can't they just demote Bickell or Versteeg to Rockford before the start of the year? Then they wouldn't count against the cap. I believe, they did something similar with Huet years ago. Maybe?"
hawks,3d569a,enderzgame,17,Mon Jul 13 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"Behind Toews and Hossa, Kruger is our best penalty killer (and as a center, I'd argue more important than Hossa on the PK). Losing Saad and Kruger would demolish our special teams. He's also a great two-way center and a big reason why Q was matching our fourth line against other teams' top lines during the playoffs.   Sending Bickell and Versteeg to Rockford wouldn't work. Under the new CBA, the cap savings from demoting a player on a one-way contract is the league minimum salary + $375k. So, for example, when the Kings sent Mike Richard's down in January and he cleared, rather than clear his full $5.75M cap hit, it only cleared $925k. The remaining $4.8M stayed on the books as a dead space."
hawks,3d569a,DrHampants,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying regarding PK time, but people were saying the same thing when they lost Frolik. I'm hesitant to give anyone not named Kane or Toews multi-million dollar contracts over several years. That is a good way to end up in salary cap hell (i.e. Bickell, Versteeg, etc.). You have limited room to make mistakes for the next few years if you want any flexibility to make moves.  Keep in mind you'll have to pay Teuvo, Dano, Panarin in the near future. So the more guys we keep signing to long term expensive deals, the less likely it is we can keep those guys plus Seabrook, Hjal, etc."
hawks,3d569a,enderzgame,8,Mon Jul 13 21:19:46 2015 UTC,"The people talking about Frolik were correct; without him our PK dropped from 87.2% in 12-13 to 81.5% in 12-14. It was a little better this year, but still far from when we had Frolik. There's a reason he's making $4.3M AAV.  I'm not saying give Kruger $4.3M or even $2.33M, which is what I think Frolik was making when he was with us. But $1.75M AAV over two years would be reasonable for the Hawks, and if he doesn't sign with us, it wouldn't surprise me if some team gave him $2.25M AAV for four years."
hawks,3d569a,DrHampants,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"You are just proving my point. We can all agree Frolik was and is significantly better than Kruger. If Frolik was replaceable, and he absolutely was, why don't you think they could replace Kruger?   You have a fixed amount of money to build a team. Bowman has to split up the pie in the most effective manner. IMO spending a large chunk of that pie on a part-time PKer is a mistake. You know how shitty their PK will be if Oduya is gone? Isn't a 4th dman or cap flexibility for a trade deadline deal more valuable?  Also, I get downvoted as a Hawks fan in a Hawks forum for having an opinion. I guess this forum is just about the circlejerk. That is super sad. Time to go somewhere else to talk hockey."
hawks,3d569a,enderzgame,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:52 2015 UTC,Naw man i think you may have a point but if Bowman can swing keeping Kruger and Oduya that would be great. I don't think we can swing it with out gutting our prospect pool in order to free up cap space.  My guess is one or the other not both. plus TVR bc he should be cheap and we need cheap.
hawks,3d569a,badlions,3,Tue Jul 14 01:42:50 2015 UTC,The problem is Kruger is a center. There is a greater defensive responsibility as a center. I'm convinced Danault could step in and take his spot on the PK but I think the % would see greater variation than with Frolik leaving.  Also don't bitch about Internet points and circle jerks. Just talk normally and you will get responses. Fuck the haters.

But Keith, Seabrook, Daley, and Oduya if he signs are all 30 or older, and Hammer is already 28. I would rather have had to deal with early season hiccups of developing young players early next season in exchange for being more sure of the roster talent ~4 years down the line (this is assuming we got picks for Sharp and didn't give up Johns)."
hawks,3d569a,tempestatic,2,Mon Jul 13 18:35:34 2015 UTC,We are a better team but in different ways. Our defense has improved and our C depth has improved. We do have a couple of untested rookie wingers that are gonna be interesting to watch
hawks,3d569a,Cartortus,7,Mon Jul 13 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"We might look better on paper but in my opinion we are a completely new look Hawks team. The strength of our team was that we were faster than everybody else in the west. The Lightning matched our speed but we pulled it out because our guys stepped up. Saad and sharp were two of our fastest players. It's going to be fascinating to watch this team adapt and find its identity next season.  All of our moves signaled a reload (were chasing the cup right away...vets who are ready to win now) rather than a retool (younger nhl ready players who will grow into their primes with Kaner and Tazer) or a rebuild (prospects to give us long term flexibility and a great team to compete for multiple cups late in the primes of Toews and Kane and past the primes of Keith, Seabrooks, and Hossa but sacrificing who we are now).  Our culture maximizes the talent of forwards, especially the guys who play with Kane+Toews (who in my opinion is the best captain in the NHL (leadership, motivator, we're not losing this game over my bloody dead body, keeps all players accountable) and in Chicago Sports History.  It's a good move to lockup top 6 guys to play in our culture (Anisimov, what they tried to do with Bickell) before they play with our guys.   Signing Anisimov to a long term deal is even more interesting because he is Russian. I'm no xenophobe, but I think it allows us to pursue Russian prospects and have them play on our team. When was the last time we had a solid Russian player in Chicago? Having a guy who speaks the language allows us to pursue younger Russians because they now have a translator on the team who can help with their transition.  In Stan I trust."
hawks,3d569a,bullsfan4life,4,Mon Jul 13 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"My friend, the 2014/2015 Hawks were not a speed team. Finesse, but not speed. Sharp is def not a burner anymore. In fact, he'd often look extremely slow esp late in the season. The only guys with plus speed on the Hawks were really Hossa, Saad, Keith, and Toews. The rest of the team is pretty average (the only slow player being Rosival).  The moves being made right now are to keep us competitive in the now and over the next 10 years. Don't quite jump out the window yet. I think they will have upgraded in several key areas now (assuming they can somehow squeeze Oduya in). In a salary cap sport, the roster will always be churning like this. You will have a couple key players you pay the big bucks, but the rest of the team will turn over from year to year. Not everyone can make $6m+/yr. They have to continually work to retool the roster and bring on young, cheap talent (i.e. Tuevo, Dano, TVR, etc.)."
hawks,3d569a,enderzgame,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:37 2015 UTC,"Anyone else question the strategy? Saad I'm ok with but we should have dropped Sharp quickly for pennies, set the market low.

But we have to keep capitalizing on the core we have while we have it, and that's bringing in as many guys at the height of their primes as we can. I think our key guys became more capable by bringing in these additions."

He must know of the displeasure and desire to trade him, right? And nobody wanting him? That must be some kind of motivation. Or is it too late? Is he just not good enough?

Dano could play first line time, so could Kane or even Teuvo. I could also see Versteeg going and Garbutt or Shaw on the 3rd line. Just what I'm feeling but I think it would be something along these lines."
hawks,3d5fnb,Chorrbs,3,Mon Jul 13 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"I really think bowman is looking to move versteeg and Bickell to sign Oduya. And I'm hoping the idea with Dano is that he will be a replacement for Saad. The kid is young with a ton of upside. I see him playing with Hossa just so he has someone he looks up to and can talk to in his native tongue. I wouldn't be shocked to see Hossa playing the third line with Dano sort of like Sharp did, just to keep the lines more balanced."
hawks,3d5fnb,Chorrbs,0,Mon Jul 13 18:09:31 2015 UTC,I don't really see a spot for Oduya left on the team. He is 33 and isn't really needed. Bowman has been high on Rundbland ever since he got him and I think if the kid can get a full season of NHl play under his belt he'll do fine in the playoffs. At some point you need to start developing your young guys because you really can't 4 30 year olds on the blue line and expect to do well in 3 years. I would love to Dano play with Hossa and think it's a huge possibility. I just don't think Hossa could drop to the 3rd line. We just don't have the depth we did last year and he'll be needed to put up points and be great on the defensive side. Just my 2 cents. I could be 100% wrong.
hawks,3d5fnb,STLL217,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"Haha well now I'm confused. ""Rundbland"" and ""he will be fine"" ""he'll do fine"". Do you like him or not?  Edit: Misquoted a bit."

I'm assuming the following: Kruger re-signs for $2M AAV, Bickell is traded, Versteeg is kept, and Oduya goes elsewhere. For defense, I'm assuming that Q runs the lines the same way he did last year, splitting up Keith and Seabs to pair the weaker players with the stronger players.  Dano - Toews - Hossa  Versteeg - Anisimov - Kane  Panarin - Teuvo - Tikhonov  Desjardins - Kruger - Shaw  Keith - TVR  Daley - Seabrook  Hjalmarsson - Rundblad  Crawford   Darling  Final Three: Garbutt, Morin, Pokka (7th defender).

hawks,3d5fnb,ClintEastwood41,2,Mon Jul 13 20:04:29 2015 UTC,I think we end up keeping Bickell until the trade deadline.  I also think we keep Versteeg.  I also think people are overselling Baun and Tikhonov and then putting Dano in positions he wont play for us.  Bickell - Toews - Hossa  Panarin - Anisimov - Kane  Versteeg - Teuvo - Dano  Desjardins - Kruger - Shaw  Garbutt - McNeill - Hartman - Baun - Tikhonov all see the big time at some point.  Keith - Seabrook  Hammer - Daley  TVR - Runblad/Pokka
hawks,3d5fnb,Chorrbs,2,Mon Jul 13 19:02:23 2015 UTC,Just so you know these lines are physically impossible with the cap. Without adding up the last foward and Kruger the cap is 70.25M. If you want Kruger Versteeg or Bickell have to go to even make it viable.
hawks,3d5fnb,ClintEastwood41,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"You're probably right.  Let me take another shot in the dark since this is all guessing.  Let's say they trade Bickell, Versteeg and Shaw soon.  Panarin - Toews - Hossa  Teuvo - Anisimov - Kane  Desjardins - Kruger - Dano  Garbutt - Danault - Tikhonov/Hartman/McNeill/Baun  Keith - Seabrook  Hammer - Oduya  TVR - Daley"
hawks,3d5fnb,Chorrbs,2,Mon Jul 13 20:13:58 2015 UTC,Very possible. I see a Shaw and Versteeg trade happening more than a Bickell trade although. And I hate that. But who knows maybe if Bickell stays all this trade talk and being scratched in the playoffs will kick him in the ass and he will play like he did to earn that $4M.

hawks,3d38xs,Sharobob,5,Mon Jul 13 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"Keith was able to sign a 13 year contract before the new CBA. So the average number is relatively low, because he gets paid a lot now, and less every year for his actual salary.  http://www.generalfanager.com/players/499"
hawks,3d38xs,limac333,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"This really cements something I've been thinking since last year- Kane & Toews are paid way too much.   Not saying they aren't worth it, but their chunks are too big to keep a team together. I know Bowman was expecting the cap to go up, and it did the max increase this year. It might again next year, too. It just doesn't seem right that TWO players are getting THIRTY PERCENT of the team's payout. Again, they're worth $10.5M on any team, but it's almost like they didn't even consider the salary cap implications when they came to that number."
hawks,3d38xs,discometalstu,6,Mon Jul 13 16:26:10 2015 UTC,They are worth MUCH more than $10.5M. If either one hit the open market they could have easily gotten offers of $14M. They both took a pretty big discount. Just wait to see what Stamkos gets in Tampa. I'm expecting at least $12M.
hawks,3d38xs,Chorrbs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"This makes it seem improbable to get both Kruger and Oduya back.   My first thought was to package Bickell and Daley in a trade which would free up 10.2%. If Oduya and Kruger both received the same percentage as last year, that would amount to 6.7%, leaving 3.5% for whoever we'd receive for Daley and Bickell. But Kruger for sure should be getting more than 1.9% leaving even less room on the receiving end of the trade.   But would it be worth it since we could maybe resign both Kruger and Oduya?"

hawks,3d4tua,shinyjolteon1,12,Mon Jul 13 15:10:29 2015 UTC,We have a lot of good potential dmen prospects but most aren't ripe and the few that get closer are seemingly traded.  We lose too much defensive depth by trading Seabrook. I really doubt it happens. IIRC Seabrook has 2 years left on his contract so if they were to trade him it would be next offseason but I just dont think its a move we make any time soon.  Stanbo far more likely to be looking for Bicks/Steeg to go.
hawks,3d4tua,Stillflying,3,Mon Jul 13 15:22:36 2015 UTC,Seabrook has 1 year left.  He's UFA next summer.
hawks,3d4tua,badseedjr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:58:29 2015 UTC,Welp I guess I didn't recall right.
hawks,3d4tua,Stillflying,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:00:58 2015 UTC,How much will Kruger cost to resign. I don't think anyone will pick Bickel up for his cap hit but would Versteeg's cap hit (about 2 million) cover his nw contract. I can see why you guys don't want to trade Seabrook since losing Destryachuk ruined us this year.
hawks,3d4tua,Stillflying,4,Mon Jul 13 15:31:09 2015 UTC,Oh and as for Kruger... 3 years 6mil 2AAV would be nice but maybe I'm dreamin
hawks,3d4tua,Stillflying,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:42 2015 UTC,I dont think for a second stanbo hasnt gotten a single offer for steeg and or bicks its just going to be about managing expectations.  Regardless. This is not the defense you are searching for.  waves hand
hawks,3d4tua,pager356,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:33:45 2015 UTC,"Bbbbuuuuut whhy? How long does Bickel have left on his contract, if it is only a year or two left you could package a draft pick to get rid of him, if he has like five years left your kinda screwed."
hawks,3d4tua,sharptoes,4,Mon Jul 13 17:45:20 2015 UTC,"I say this with homer glasses on, but Seabrook is not a ""solid #2"" as you say. He his the #2 defenseman on the hawks only because he plays with arguably the best in the game and a future hall of famer in Keith. He is a #1 in most NHL teams.  The hawks would want as much and probably more than hamilton got for the bruins. As Seabrook is an established defensemen in his prime. So a trade ain't happening"
hawks,3d4tua,badseedjr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"Hamilton is a 22 year old that is getting his payday right before the cap goes up that has improved in one year from a solid second pairing guy to the 15th place Norris defenseman. In a few years he will be top 5 with Keith, Subban, Doughty, and Ekblad (maybe Pieranglo). Seabrook is in his prime and will be soon getting on the downturn of his career. The Hawks might get more for Seabrook if theey trade him at some point, but there is no way in hell they should get more than what the Bruins got for Hamilton. But there is also the Sweeney factor. (B's fans wanted to trade Hamilton only if we had 3-4 1st rounders or the equivelence in picks and prospects in return)"
hawks,3d4tua,yorozuyajin-chan,6,Mon Jul 13 18:50:05 2015 UTC,We're not trading Seabrook.
hawks,3d4tua,Stillflying,3,Mon Jul 13 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"Would we trade Seabrook?  Maybe, if it came down to him not taking an extension, but I don't see it happening until next deadline so they have negotiating time.  He's UFA next season, so he could be a rental if he's demanding too much.  Should we?  I don't think so.  He's a huge leader in the Locker room and as solid as they come.  If I'm Stan, I do everything I can to sign him to around a 4-5 year at 6-7 per.  If they did have to, Your return probably isn't bad  An established bottom end D man, a prospect or 2, and a pick. Sets them up well for the future."
hawks,3d4tua,Cartortus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"Mcquaid would work well with the d-man you git from Dallas as he is more of an offensive defenseman right? When our team was intact he worked ridicolously well with Krug, one guy who snipes in the offensive zone, the other makes sure your end is well defended. Miller is hyped up from LA and is NHL ready and Morrow got time up and looked good when the injuries hit last year. Bruins don't have a good group of prospects though. I agree that a deadline deal is probably the best hope as it shows how well either Miller or Morrow can play (at least one will make our bottom pairing) and the Blackhawks know whether or not they will be cup contenders or if they need more depth."

hawks,3d2zzl,Pepsuber188,3,Mon Jul 13 04:48:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best person to explain this, but in case no one else answers I'll explain what i know.   So the few extremely good prospects like kaner, crosby, mcdavid, etc. go straight to the nhl because they need less development time and their skills are nhl ready. The vast majority go to a variety of different places.   Players drafted while in college often stay and play at their college and develop there until they want to play professionally (example of this would be vince hinostroza, who we drafted a few years ago an has played for Notre dame since).   Young players drafted while in juniors are sometimes kept on the juniors team if they are young or need more development (i think saad did this for a while? Can't think of any current prospects currently doing this).   The rest of the prospects who are close to the nhl level, or the ones who finished college and signed with the team, go to the AHL affiliate of the NHL team. They have a pro contract and do their best to fine time the prospect, and also give them lots of game experience at a level and play style that is closer to the NHL. Players for us doing this now include Villa Pokka, Mark McNeil, Phillip danealt, and ryan Hartman.   Last way i can think of is European leagues. Drafted foreign players will play in their current league for a bit of time before coming to play for the AHL or NHL team. Teavo Teravainen is the best example of this method."
hawks,3d2zzl,rancor58,2,Mon Jul 13 05:21:12 2015 UTC,with current players of major jr. a player would be like Max Domi or Leon Draisaitl. they are probably close to NHL ready now though

The Stars are a great team, its a business and you know it going in. But good god, I feel for Patrick Sharp. Everyone knew it had to be this way, but there is something intrinsically sad about uprooting your family and home, moving away to have a first day again when you're a veteran, and losing your team when you have been such an impactful player and been involved in so much.   I hate that this has to happen, and feel bad for Patrick Sharp as a human being. I hope he comes back in a couple of years.

hawks,3d2zxb,borkborkbork99,3,Mon Jul 13 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"On my way out of the United Center last month two hours after the Blackhawks won their third Stanley Cup in six seasons, Patrick Sharp emerged from a euphoric dressing room full of teammates to hug some friends and family members in the hallway.  Sharp caught my quick glance and came over to stop me for a word. In this business, one braces himself any time a pro athlete he has critiqued over time asks for an audience. But the relaxed, reflective look on Sharp's face suggested this was not one of those encounters.  ""Thanks for being fair during all that crap this year — and thanks for everything all the years I was here,"" Sharp said, extending his hand. ""It was a great ride.''  He knew. Everybody knew. The most challenging season of Sharp's Hawks career — the one sullied by over-the-top gossip about his personal life and trade rumors he alluded to — also would be his last. His classy, long goodbye began within minutes of saying hello to his last championship in a red sweater. When the inevitable news arrived Friday night that Sharp had been traded to the Stars for salary-cap purposes, it was less of a shock than younger ex-teammate Brandon Saad's departure — but no less significant.  Chicago should be the one stopping to thank Sharp on his way out for being the professional he was for 10 years representing the Hawks. When was the last time one of our city's athletes left town for another team after starring in such a historic decade here? Frank Thomas? Mark Buehrle? Scottie Pippen? Michael Jordan? That's good company.  Individually, of course, Sharp still ranks a tier below those icons, but three Cups and an Olympic gold medal for Team Canada make the 33-year-old one of the most decorated players of his generation to wear another uniform after enjoying one of Chicago's rare championship parades.  This Hawks salary dump included franchise history too. This wasn't the Bears dealing wide receiver Brandon Marshall and big numbers that were the equivalent of empty calories. This was the first trade since they started counting Cups to shake the Hawks to their core, which always included Sharp.  You can't measure what the Hawks lost by saying they can easily replace the 16 goals and 27 assists in what was a down year for the winger. It goes beyond finding ways to compensate for the absence of the team's active leader in power-play goals (65) and short-handed goals (16) who leaves with 38 game-winners — three more than Patrick Kane. An organization that has relied on class and character as much as speed and skill to rebuild itself in the Joel Quenneville Era faces a void requiring more than just a sniper on a top line. It faces the loss of a quiet example of professionalism and leadership often overlooked on a team full of bigger stars — but not unappreciated.  Contrary to the ballyhooed Mr. Handsome reputation, Sharp was more than just a pretty face; he could be a grinder when needed on both ends with a nasty streak that belied his Hollywood good looks. He also understood and embraced accountability. When he committed costly back-to-back penalties in third period of Game 2 against the Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final, Sharp was awaiting reporters at his locker postgame to own it. When he sensed his silence over the Internet rumormongering increased the distraction, Sharp initiated the tough conversation in March to shift the focus back to hockey. When a situation called for responsibility, Sharp answered.  As much as any sport, hockey relies on intangibles and team chemistry, resolve and resilience, especially on the ice. The Hawks might not realize how much they miss Sharp's role in making those strengths on their championship teams until he's gone.  In terms of sheer talent, age and potential, yes, the Hawks ultimately might regret trading 23-year-old defenseman Stephen Johns more than Sharp, whose unwieldy $5.9 million cap hit forced GM Stan Bowman's hand. It tells you how badly Bowman needed to shed Sharp's salary that the Stars coerced him into including a promising young D-man off a Hawks team lacking depth on the blue line.  Veteran defenseman Trevor Daley, one of two players the Hawks received, offers insurance if no money remains for free-agent Johnny Oduya. Forward Ryan Garbutt becomes the latest NHL agitator Bowman adds to a collection that already includes Andrew Shaw, Andrew Desjardins and Daniel Carcillo. As a ""good, old-fashioned hockey trade,'' the way Bowman described it, the deal can be defended as benefiting both teams. On a list of 2016 Cup contenders, the Hawks still can be included as long as Kane, Jonathan Toews and Duncan Keith stay healthy.  But player introductions Friday at the Hawks Convention will carry more curiosity than most years. Anisimov. Dano. Panarin. Tikhonov. Daley. Garbutt … The positive vibe and optimism will feel similar. But without Sharp, the Hawks just won't be the same."

hawks,3d1hso,ClintEastwood41,4,Mon Jul 13 15:37:17 2015 UTC,I believe the buyout deadline was June 30th.
hawks,3d1hso,DasSnaus,2,Sun Jul 12 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, we missed the buyout deadline. He would have needed to be placed on unconditional waivers on or before June 30th (or within 48 hours of the end of the Stanley Cup Final, whichever is later).  One thing that is still an option though is sending him down to Rockford. He would need to clear waivers, and then we'd get about half of his salary off the books (if I remember correctly) a quarter of his salary off the books. Even then, I doubt he'd clear waivers, as he's certainly NHL worthy, if a bit expensive; but the claiming team wouldn't have to give up anything to take him. And yes, we can do this with his NTC; it would only be a problem if he had a NMC, which he doesn't."
hawks,3d1hso,mikewitt,2,Mon Jul 13 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"Incorrect,  the wavier rule is league minimum (575,000) plus 375,000. So the Hawks would get 950,000 in relief. Anything  over goes against  the cap"
hawks,3d1hso,jmblumenshine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"With the cap hit for 2 additional years after his contract expires, this probably was never an option. This year, and the last couple the Hawks have been right up at the cap ceiling with just rostered players. Paying one to not be there (to the tune of $1.5 million) makes no sense, particularly with the way this team has spent on retaining players."
hawks,3d4y5i,ClintEastwood41,7,Mon Jul 13 15:43:24 2015 UTC,Why? They're both on contract for at least 1 more year...we have more pressing concerns.
hawks,3d4y5i,LTComedy,2,Mon Jul 13 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"exactly 1 more year, it doesn't cost us anything right now to add extensions onto their deals and get them as long term Hawks.  I really just don't want to lose anymore young talent."
hawks,3d4y5i,Cartortus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"I like the idea but we need Cap space. You're right it would be better to get them now then when thy are begging for more. But to sign Kruger, Dano and Turbo it would probably take north of 6 mil a year for all three. Kruger should get 3ish average and Dano and Turbo could get an extension for 2 mil average each. So it's a good idea but trying to trade others and sign others it's also a good idea to wait and see so we don't fuck ourselves deeper into Salary Cap Hell"

hawks,3d4y5i,Cartortus,2,Mon Jul 13 20:38:31 2015 UTC,The new contract's cap hit wouldn't take effect til the current contract ends.

hawks,3d4y5i,Cartortus,2,Mon Jul 13 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's extremely unrealistic. Their agents would be crazy to negotiate new contracts now knowing they could have huge breakout seasons this year or next. These guys are studs and their agents know it."

hawks,3d4y5i,Stool_Gizmoto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:38 2015 UTC,Easy there champ. What money do you suggest we use to extend them with? Just because some of Sharpie's cap hit is gone doesn't mean we can start throwing money around. Turbo Toasteroven was great yes but even great players have sophomore slumps we have all year to extend them. Nothing about their situation says ASAP.
hawks,3d4y5i,47Ronin,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"Extensions don't kick in right now, they kick in at the end of their current deals"
hawks,3d4y5i,Stool_Gizmoto,2,Mon Jul 13 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are correct. So again I ask, with our current cap situation as unpredictable as it is why would we extend two players that are essentially question marks. Let them play a little of the season and if they fit extend them. Look at the Luongo situation as an example of extending someone before you know why they can offer."
hawks,3d4y5i,Stool_Gizmoto,2,Mon Jul 13 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"Your point is well taken, but do you really think Taco is still a question mark?"
hawks,3d4y5i,Stool_Gizmoto,2,Mon Jul 13 18:47:33 2015 UTC,He had an amazing breakout year but yes this is only his sophomore season. We as Hawks fans should be all too familiar with players over performing (Bickell) do I honestly think Tuba will be bad? Absolutely not the guy is a stud. But you certainly have to acknowledge how new he is.
hawks,3d4y5i,yorozuyajin-chan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:47 2015 UTC,My only reasoning to doing it now is to hopefully sign them before they possibly have Saad type years and then we end up not having the $ for them later
hawks,3d4y5i,MoistKumquat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:20:45 2015 UTC,So you'd rather use that $ now? Either way they are going to get $. If you wait though it will be less of a gamble. Also if you wait you might have a more stable cap. Saad's situation came around because he didn't communicate with his agent and his agent tried to play hardball.
hawks,3d4y5i,MoistKumquat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"what don't you understand?  If we spend it now, it should hopefully be a lower # now than if they take off this season.  That money will not count against us this season since it's an extension.  Either way they are going to get the money, I would rather get it done now and for a lower # than in a year or 2 from now when we might have to either end up adding an extra million or 2 to their deals OR possibly lose them like we did Saad.  I understand what your saying as you don't want to give it to them now and have them ending up having a bad year and so on but everything points to them only getting better from here so that is why I say let's just do it now and hope for the best."

I'm so glad too.   Soupy and Keith looked like they had lead skates in the first. And Huet and Niemi both looked drunk in the first. I can remember hating Calgary so much during those years. Too bad that never blossomed into a full blown rivalry.
hawks,3d0104,Patrick_Kane,2,Sun Jul 12 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"This was a few months after Detroit knocked us out of the WCF. We'd been having a pretty rough start to the season. I think we were 5-4-2 at the time, or something just hovering around .500. Sometime shortly after the 5-4 goal, I told the friend I was watching with ""We're gonna win this game. They're gonna find a way. Look at these passes. They're in a zone. They're gonna tie this game and they're gonna win it. This is a different team than the one that started. This is our year. We're going to the finals.""   A few weeks later was the circus trip and a record win streak. Niemi took over as the starter. We went on to 51 or 52 wins and took home The Cup. That game was the turning point. I know it's available on iTunes because it's the only video I have bought there. I think it's under tv shows and something like ""Greatest NHL games"" or something like that."

hawks,3d1vu7,GENERIC_VULGARITY,15,Sun Jul 12 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"We lost a guy who helped us win 2 cups and another guy who basically started the resurgence of the team, excuse some people for feeling a little fucking down.  I think the Saad trade was a good one to give us depth without hamstringing us financially.  I don't think the Sharp trade was good at all. Daley is a one way defenseman (the wrong way) and Garbutt is known to take a bunch of penalties. We also lost one of our best prospects and gained very little cap space in the process. Not really gonna help us sign Kruger and Oduya.   There's nothing wrong with disliking the trades made, whether it be for realistic hockey reasons or because of emotional attachment."
hawks,3d1vu7,NotJayCutler,2,Sun Jul 12 21:44:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, but Daley is coming off a bad year but every Stars fan says that prior he was great, and he was being played like a first pairing when he should have been a second. Can't blame a guy for being used wrong. On the flip side, Garbutt is apparently showing much better this year. Everyone was all freaked out the same way when we signed Carcillo and he turned out to be a great addition for the price.   I will miss Sharp too, but I think everyone is being a bit alarmist when it comes to the trade analysis."
hawks,3d1vu7,NotJayCutler,2,Sun Jul 12 22:25:37 2015 UTC,"Carcillo was a good addition until he started getting back to his old tricks. Then he was benched for the rest of the year. Daley could see some success as a third pair guy, but otherwise he'd probably have to be bailed out a lot by his other D partner"

Edit I hate deleted comments, but that was a comment about my credibility going down the tubes because I saw value in Carcillo. A downvote and a deleted comment."
hawks,3d1vu7,lizard_king_rebirth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"In addition, the Daley acquisition, even if he gets better, is still 3.3 mil for a sixth Dman when we can use that for Oduya, or extending Seabs and Shaw, Dano, and Teuvo"
hawks,3d1vu7,PublickStews,5,Mon Jul 13 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm not thrilled with the return on either trade. Not right now. Not on paper. I liked Saad enough that he was going to be my next jersey. As fans we should be attached to players. We should expect success. And, dare I say it out loud, every trade should be in our favor.  But life doesn't work that way. So being upset is fine. Come December, or maybe June, my mind may change about the trades. But on paper I see us getting garbage for Leddy, Sharp and Saad. I don't have to like it now. The hope is we all love it next June as we watch our boys lift another Cup. That is the desired outcome and that is what will make it all OK."
hawks,3d1vu7,Aperture-Employee,4,Mon Jul 13 05:44:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much all you said. The moves made, while not popular, were necessary. Daley will prove to be a better defenseman than people think, and long-term I would wager that the Saad deal will look way better than what Toronto got for Phil Kessel, an established star in the league. I am confident Bowman will figure out a way to sign Oduya and Kruger, though if we lose them at least we are in a better position to fill those roles now than we were at the beginning of the off-season."
hawks,3d1vu7,Aperture-Employee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Nice to know I am not alone. Every move is a gamble, and that's just reality. I don't know that each of these moves are good, but maybe the idea is calculated replacement of pieces we can't keep, or avoiding overvaluing pieces.   I don't like these moves either, but I know that its really hard to say goodbye to pieces that helped us win the cup. Of course they were valuable, and that builds attachment to them. But there is no doubt in my mind that having bigger, tougher players can mitigate some of the threats and damage we faced from the Ducks. I saw them as the biggest challenge, and I imagine that is a lot of what Bowman is looking at, as well as looking at what our division rivals are shaping up to be. I trust in Bowman, ultimately, and feel he knows this team, and other teams better than I do. I know that it wasn't him who assembled our core, but he has maintained that talent around it with no more mistakes than is normal."
hawks,3d1vu7,CommitToTheIndian,4,Mon Jul 13 05:38:21 2015 UTC,This is typical though. This forum was ready to pack it in after the Hawks went down 2-1 to the Lightning and gnashed their teeth about how the Hawks were getting outplayed so badly. Now they all know better than Stan Bowman and the Hawks' analytics guys. Do you seriously think that Bowman doesn't know Daley has a terrible Corsi?
hawks,3d1vu7,Patrick_Kane,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"I guess. It is weird though, because its such an amicable group most of the time, but I am seeing such pessimism and questioning of a man who has rebuilt the talent around our core twice over. The Crow contract and the Bickell contract were not the best of deals perhaps, but how about the talent that has been, from Shaw, Kruger, to Panarin and Saad? Whats more, so many players have said this organization is the best in the league and anyone would want to play here. That is the organization that Bowman built, and is the reason why we have gotten some of the hometown discounts we have gotten from great players."
hawks,3d1vu7,yorozuyajin-chan,9,Mon Jul 13 05:44:21 2015 UTC,"For our highly touted defensive prospect and Patrick Sharp we got one of the worst defensive defenseman in the league and a guy whose best move is to act like a prick. Shaw does that too, only he can actually contribute elsewhere."
hawks,3d1vu7,GuyOnTheLake,6,Mon Jul 13 19:20:09 2015 UTC,That being said the Saad trade still looks decent to me I just wish Paliotta hadn't gone as well. We trade away d-man prospects like fucking candy on Halloween
hawks,3d1vu7,Patrick_Kane,6,Sun Jul 12 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of Hawks fans fail to realize that Stan winning 3 cups (with an incredible core assembled by Dale Tallon) does not mean he is some omniscient HOF GM who is incapable of making bad moves. The Leddy trade and Bickell's contract are the main things that come to mind.  Hawks fans and this sub have every right to question the Sharp trade, as it was a horseshit deal. We failed to gain a lot of cap flexibility while also trading away our top defensive prospect.   Keep in mind, Stan has dished out countless D prospects in the past couple years alone. Don't put blinders on just because of these 3 cups. There have been some questionable moves made this offseason and the Hawks have an uphill battle back to the Cup next year."
hawks,3d1vu7,GuyOnTheLake,5,Sun Jul 12 21:58:18 2015 UTC,...and traded within the division.   Agree with everything. Here come the apologists.

hawks,3d1vu7,RaveOn1958,2,Sun Jul 12 23:21:43 2015 UTC,2 2nds for Kimmo was idiotic too. 2 high picks for a locker room presence? Joke show.
hawks,3d1vu7,GuyOnTheLake,5,Sun Jul 12 23:29:18 2015 UTC,I would have preferred we got nothing from the trade. It's not going to help us cap-wise.  Kruger and Oduya are patiently waiting and we STILL don't have enough cap for both of them.  I do not want a defensive liability and a penalty liability on our team.

hawks,3d1vu7,yorozuyajin-chan,5,Sun Jul 12 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"Like fuck Daley can't play defense. Just because he is coming off a bad year doesn't mean he can't play defense. Where are you all coming up with this? Because the Stars fans celebrated when they lost him? The ones I spoke with said he had a rough year but that he is a great Dman, but was used poorly this year, forced into a role he doesn't fit. Obviously hes an offensive man, so the fact he has 28 more points last season than Oduya doesn't factor in to the defensive argument, so we look at this past season when he was a -13 and panic? What about the year prior when he was +10? In fact, last year was the only year he finished in the negatives. So why is it he can't play defense? Because he has had poor metrics with the Stars? Everyone has poor defensive metrics with the stars.  There is no reason to believe a Dman from a team that puts very little emphasis on D is incapable of adjusting the way he plays."
hawks,3d1vu7,peskysens,4,Sun Jul 12 22:31:46 2015 UTC,"Daley's Corsi  Rozsi's Corsi  Before anyone says Rozi's Corsi was padded during his tenure with the Hawks, look at his Corsi with the other teams he played for.  Rozsi's corsi is MUCH better than Daley's. Think about that"
hawks,3d1vu7,ItsReallyOregano,2,Sun Jul 12 22:50:26 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, your link for Daley is for PP stats."
hawks,3d1vu7,peskysens,2,Sun Jul 12 23:25:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! I change it!
hawks,3d1vu7,ItsReallyOregano,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"Fair, but the main criticism of Corsi numbers are that they are skewed when playing with a bad team. From Wikipedia:  ""While Corsi may provide a more accurate evaluation of players contributions to a winning effort than plus-minus (giving a plus to players who are on the ice when a goal is scored and a minus to players who are on the ice when a goal is scored on their own net), it does have its owns criticisms. For example, a player is on the ice for 30 shots on net and 20 shots against. This player is a defensive defenseman, and in this situation he only helped create 5 shots on net but his mistakes led to 15 shots against. This tells us his real impact on the game is -10 Corsi, but on the game sheet at the end of the game his Corsi number will be +10.[4] This is because he was playing with better players around him and that boosted his Corsi number. Essentially, a good player playing consistently with bad players will get hammered by Corsi, while a good player playing with great players will get a boost. In this sense, Corsi is not the greatest tool for determining a player’s usefulness to his team and his impact on the game.""  It seems most Stars fans concede that he was used poorly, playing top pairing and being pushed to play offensively. That was the approach. I feel you have to factor in the +/- and when you look at it, he doesn't seem so bad. Not to me, anyway."
hawks,3d1vu7,STLL217,3,Mon Jul 13 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"You should probably look at his stats for what Stars fans say was a ""great"" year.  Daley hasn't posted a positive number in either Corsi or Fenwick in his ENTIRE NHL career.  ENTIRE CAREER.  You keep saying it was Dallas, Dallas was 10th overall last season in CF, and 8th overall in FF.    It's not the team.  Daley.  Sucks.  At.  Defense.   Edit:  You are exactly correct though that he is being used incorrectly.  He is, at best, a 6, maybe 5 guy.  Unfortunately, the contract the Hawks took on make him more of a 3/4 guy pay wise, and he is nowhere near that worth."
hawks,3d1vu7,yorozuyajin-chan,4,Mon Jul 13 21:57:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, we'll see what happens. But people will be wishing for Oduya over him when he pinches down and gives up a breakaway in the opener."
hawks,3d1vu7,Twelve2375,2,Mon Jul 13 01:57:32 2015 UTC,"There is a article from a Stars analyst someone posted about Daley's stats. It's not just the +/-, almost every stat is pretty much telling us he is liability on the D. Even if we only compare him to his fellow D on the Stars. he is still bottom of the pack.   And Q runs a much tighter ship. Daley's not going to see time on the ice if he can't be responsible defensively. If he's on the bench he isn't going to be contributing offensively."
hawks,3d1vu7,tempestatic,2,Sun Jul 12 22:53:00 2015 UTC,"Daley had one bad season and was easily the top D man in Dallas for the previous 3 years. Yes he can play D, he can play it well actually. He also can skate fast as fuck and can carry/move the puck."

hawks,3d1vu7,PaddyKane,6,Sun Jul 12 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"Garbutt: might turn out alright but I'm not thrilled about him. Reading that he dives and plays dirty doesn't make me happy. I would rather have Hartman on the team.  Daley: expensive and old(er) version of Rundblad as I understand it. And now we can't afford Oduya. I would've preferred to re-sign Oduya and have Rundy as the offensive Dman and PP quarterback.  We don't know yet how things will work out, but I don't like this Sharp trade as of now. I would have liked either something better in return or more cap space.  Edit: the Saad trade hurt initially but that retun was good so I'm fine with that trade now"
hawks,3d1vu7,lizard_king_rebirth,4,Mon Jul 13 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know why we'd give the roster spot to Garbutt when Hartman is right THERE and ready to go. Why can't management just give our rookies a shot? They developed them right, so why don't they have any confidence in them?"
hawks,3d1vu7,PaddyKane,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:44:34 2015 UTC,Hartman is right there.  Johns WAS right there.  That's my biggest issue with this trade.  We had some great prospects ready (we've been going on and on about our log jam of prospects who deserve a chance) and we go out and get more over priced vets.  I wish I knew what was going on with Svedberg.  A huge lefty was exactly what we needed to bring up.  He could have been had on the cheap too.
hawks,3d1vu7,ChicagoRunner,2,Sun Jul 12 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say there's hate for the Saad trade, just people bummed but understanding of his demands and the return we got. Nor are people hating on Sharp himself being gone, since most people acknowledged his salary just didn't fit.  As for the execution of the Sharp trade, however, people aren't being myopic. The point of the trade was to a) shed salary and b) return youth in the form of picks or prospects.The first problem is that that amount of salary dumped was hardly optimal, even with Dallas covering half of Garbutt's salary. The bigger problem is that not only did the trade yield two middle aged players offering little to no further development, but the Hawks also gave up one of their top prospects.  Teams don't maintain high level performance year to year by staying in a holding pattern -- young talent has to supplement the declining skills of aging players. Without even getting into whether we have enough space to sign Kruger or Oduya, maybe this core does fine this upcoming season -- Daley and Garbutt are decent. But for the long term, it would have been better to get, say, a 2nd+3rd, a 2nd+4th, or something similar, while the Hawks dealt with the risk/reward of inconsistency/development of giving a young player like Johns a shot."
hawks,3d1vu7,ChicagoRunner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that assessment. I think Bowmans goal has been to rake in the cups while we have the talent to do so. Exactly why we gave up what we did for Vermette. Its not time to start the rebuild process yet, but rather capitalize on our assets. We are making cup runs now, so you want to surround the key players with experience and talent. I would say that when we begin to see the decline of our top talent is when we start stockpiling prospects and rookies. Stan showed he is going to go all in while Kane and Toews are in their prime, and I trust that he knows what he is doing. I believe the goal is extending our golden age as long as possible."
hawks,3d1vu7,ChicagoRunner,2,Sun Jul 12 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that the goal is to extend the championship window as long as possible. I disagree that this window has to end when Toews and Kane hit the twilight of their careers, which is why I'm suggesting more of a reload than a rebuild. The best comparison is the Spurs in the NBA and the Patriots in the NFL (the two other capped major sports), who have been successful for well over a decade. I'm going to generalize a bit, but they've pulled it off with fiscal responsibility and replenishing with youth while their stars age. The Hawks have already pulled off an unprecedented run in the salary cap era. Wouldn't it be better if they were contenders year in, year out for the next decade? It'd suck if the team sank in 5 years or so because the blue line fell off a cliff.  Let's compare the current situation, assuming we sign Kruger and Oduya, and a different situation where Sharp was traded for 2 picks, and we also signed Kruger+Oduya. Would our hypothetical 5th-7th d men of TVR-Johns-Rundblad be much weaker than Daley-TVR-Rundblad? I don't think so. Similarly, the bottom 6 would be fine without Garbutt. The difference is that in the case that didn't happen, Johns could have been groomed to play top 4 minutes in a few years."
hawks,3d1vu7,ChicagoRunner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"A solid argument. I don't disagree with your logic, though I do think Daley is better than Johns right now. Or rather, I should say I trust that the Blackhawks organization knows that better than I, so I trust in the decision that way. I have felt that the Hawks are going to start reloading right at the onset of decline in our better players, while they still have value. I could be wrong, or even if I am right, it could be the wrong way to do it. But I really trust Bowman.  Having said that, I have to thank you for your comment. Its nice to have a discussion about something where both parties remain respectful of each other despite a shared passion accompanied by a different view on things. Nice to not be called an idiot and downvoted for having an alternative opinion."

Bickell has certainly not played to his potential. It's not a great deal, but the consensus was that he had to retain either Bickell or Bolland after 2013. This was certainly the better option.   •Crow gets paid 6 mil a year. Don't get me wrong, I love crow, but he's worth 4 or 5 mil, not 6. That's just unnecessary money eating up cap space.   He's a top 10 goalie getting top 10 money. 4 or 5 million? Where are you getting these numbers? Look what $4 million gets you.   •He gave Michael Rozsival a no trade clause, which largely contributed to losing Leddy.   Again, Leddy had to be let go because the Hawks have too much talent and can't pay for everyone. The horror.   •He clearly over played his hand on Sharp, forcing us into a bad deal. It wasn't even a salary dump. What will we do with Ryan Garbutt?   Mind you, Dallas is retaining salary and Bowman got a return of a starting D man while unloading a huge contract for an older player whose best years are behind him.   •The Toews/Kane deals feel a but too pricy for me. I think he could have done a little bit less.   What does that even mean? It's just pissy I-wish-ism's. Since that deal was signed, these two players have spearheaded three Stanley Cup title runs. They deserve every penny they got.   •He traded away way too much for Kimmo and Vermette. Giving up two 2nds and a first is simply ridiculous.   Vermette was instrumental in the cup run. The Kimmo deal was bad, but they were thin at D.   •Adding to the Vermette deal, he traded Dahlbeck over Raanta. Raanta was just a 3rd string goalie, where as Dahlbeck could have been a very cheap Oduya replacement.   Dahlbeck is hardly a lock. Meanwhile, Vermette gave tangible value to the team. I understand building towards the future, but what good are prospects and potential when you can be aggressive and try to win now, which they did?   •He traded away both Paliotta and Johns. I feel like if we just did a straight up Saad and Broadhurst for Dano and Anisimov trade rather than including Morin and Tropp in the deal we could have kept Paliotta.   What guarantee is there that your trade gets accepted? Everyone knows the Hawks' cap situation and it really weakens Bowman's leverage. I think he got a solid deal considering.   •Most of his Draft picks haven't turned into anything. Most of our success is from Tallon.   It's not like Tallon drafting Toews and Kane was some stroke of genius. They were in great draft position because Tallon's teams were shitty at the NHL level. So you decry the trading of Johns and Saad, while also decrying Bowman's poor drafting?

hawks,3d1eu8,headmutt65,10,Tue Jul 14 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"If you focus on the negatives then you can make anyone look bad. People make mistakes. The fact that we have 3 cups in 6 years is not a mistake. Stan is a huge part of that. We are one of the few teams in any sport that has an office that is both competent and that meshes well with its personnel. Stop looking for problems that aren't there trying to get people to light their torches. I can assure you, you are the minority."
hawks,3d1eu8,Stool_Gizmoto,3,Mon Jul 13 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"Tallon signed Campbell to that ridiculous contract and over paid on a couple guys as well.  It was easy for Tallon to build a good core when he had top picks all over form us sucking.  Stan has brought the cup back 2 times, even after jettisoning a bunch of guys after 2010.  He's doing fine.  His return on Saad was really good for an RFA demanding more money.  You can't hit home runs every time."
hawks,3d1eu8,badseedjr,6,Mon Jul 13 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"actually a lot of people re Crow have looked at his stats compared to what other goalies are earning as say its right on par. I'm on mobile but tomorrow I can maybe look this up for you from past rhockey threads. jury is still out on the sharp trade. I think Stanbo likely did the best he could, every team knows we're in cap hell.   -Toews/Kane you pay what you must. These are franchise players that lead the hawks through the dark. You have to lock them up. As with most contracts right now it hurts. In a few years probably less so.   I dislike trading our prospects but hes trading for now players while we have players in their prime. While Tallon built a decent amount of the framework you are really underselling a lot of what Stanbo has done as well.   I think you need to stop, take a step back, a few deep breaths and wait for regular season to start. A lot of these points sound an  awful lot like hot takes."
hawks,3d1eu8,Stillflying,2,Mon Jul 13 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"I'll focus on only the last three years, as this is where all of these complaints are stemming from. Take yourself away from where we sit right at this moment. Right now, it is hard losing players we love and not being sure if we will be winning a cup again in the coming few years.   BUT, go ask someone from any other fan base if they would be willing to lose talent, players they love, and put themselves in a hard position to keep continued success in exchange for 2 Cups, 43 playoff wins in 3 years, and Toews Kane and Keith through 2023, and I think anyone would take it. We aren't dead and the moves that Bowman has made have helped us a ton along the way. Focus on the good. We just won a cup a month ago and almost all the core pieces we still be here when the puck drops in October."

But there was a point that I thought I would never see the Hawks win a Cup in my lifetime. So three cups in six years? Fuck it, even if we're done I have lived through the darkest and brightest of timelines for my favorite team. As much as I hated losing those guys (and Bolland*, Ladd, Byfuglien) I like winning more."

hawks,3cv6qq,PrisonedMuffin,19,Sat Jul 11 01:28:28 2015 UTC,He was very good and could've played as a black ace in the Stanley Cup Final had he not gotten hurt in the playoffs.
hawks,3cv6qq,ThatDriftingPixel,28,Sat Jul 11 01:30:35 2015 UTC,In Bowman I trust - He knows something we don't so hopefully this isn't a bitter pill to swallow and we get Kruger and Oduya resigned.
hawks,3cv6qq,yorozuyajin-chan,14,Sat Jul 11 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about Oduya now, Daley is another D on the roster and taking up cap space that could have gone to Oduya. It'd be pretty shitty to not sign the guy after he's waited for this."
hawks,3cv6qq,QEDomelets,11,Sat Jul 11 01:58:32 2015 UTC,Perhaps we might make a U-turn and deal Daley somewhere packaged with Bickell (?) so we can clear up more space for Kruger and respect Oduya's loyalty for waiting this out.
hawks,3cv6qq,yorozuyajin-chan,16,Sat Jul 11 02:21:06 2015 UTC,I'm REALLY hoping that's the plan. I'll take Oduya over Daley. And I'm so tired of having to pair guys with baby Hawks for trades.

hawks,3cv6qq,doctor_crazy,8,Sat Jul 11 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty excited for Daley though; he had 16 goals last year. Seems like a bit of a gamble, but he can do this from time to time."
hawks,3cv6qq,ThatDriftingPixel,3,Sat Jul 11 02:05:36 2015 UTC,Maybe a trade after a trade? I can not see any sense being made in NOT signing Oduya. The man was lights out on a thin d.
hawks,3cv6qq,yorozuyajin-chan,9,Sat Jul 11 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"Keeping my fingers crossed. Beacon of hope, Q absolutely hates D that gets caught out of position, I can't see him being a big fan of Daley."
hawks,3cv6qq,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Sat Jul 11 03:34:56 2015 UTC,Yeah we saw in the playoffs how quick he was to give everyone more time on the ice in favor of throwing some fresh Dmen on the ice because of getting caught with their pants down too often.  Im hopeful - especially since Van Riemsdyk is healthy again.
hawks,3cv6qq,Patrick_Kane,47,Sat Jul 11 04:15:48 2015 UTC,"Really bugs me how half of the comments you see on Facebook are ""that's what happens when you bang your teammates wife.""  Sharp needs to sue Bernstein for defamation."
hawks,3cv6qq,wewd,12,Sat Jul 11 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"Sharp needs to sue Bernstein for defamation.   He has a case, too. Defamation requires proof that your reputation has been harmed, and you can find that all over the place."
hawks,3cv6qq,Patrick_Kane,12,Sat Jul 11 05:47:05 2015 UTC,It's really fucked up. I've not seen this kind of unsubstantiated rumour stick to a player before. Even guys who have been caught cheating have taken less shit.
hawks,3cv6qq,splintersmaster,4,Sat Jul 11 06:04:29 2015 UTC,"Bernstein never broke that story, It was jay glazer who blew the top off the story. Bernstein for a long time said there were bad rumors about how sharp is viewed in the locker room, and never mentioned anything about fucking wives until glazer put it out there."
hawks,3cv6qq,Patrick_Kane,2,Sat Jul 11 12:42:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but it would seem that Bernstein was patient zero here starting the rumor.
hawks,3cv6qq,splintersmaster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:27:30 2015 UTC,No. Saying patrick sharp is not thought of highly in the locker room does not mean the same thing as he's fucking teammates wives.  lots of guys are talked about as poor teammates without someone possibly exaggerating the story into something as disgusting as what sharp allegedly did.
hawks,3cv6qq,Patrick_Kane,2,Sat Jul 11 16:34:32 2015 UTC,He jumped right on that when it came out. And the former football player that initially tweeted it is his buddy.
hawks,3cv6qq,splintersmaster,0,Sat Jul 11 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"You said sharp should sue bernstein, bernstein did not break the possibly fake story.  If anything the guy who broke the story would be the guilty party. Not to mention every media outlet repeated or went along with the story so why single out bernstein?"
hawks,3cv6qq,Patrick_Kane,2,Sat Jul 11 16:42:35 2015 UTC,And I'm saying that Bernstein fed it to his lackey and then jumped all over it with the see I told yous. Kinda like he did with the BMarsh trade. Except true.   Also he's a massive piece of shit. Fuck that guy.
hawks,3cv6qq,splintersmaster,0,Sat Jul 11 16:44:19 2015 UTC,That's fine that you don't like him. I'm only arguing bernstein should not get sued and is no more guilty of anything than many local and national reports involved in this story.
hawks,3cv6qq,Patrick_Kane,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember your arguemnet the other day in chibears. You love the guy.   He's also behind the bullshit rumors about Wilson being gay, Rose and Jimmy hating each other. And he was definitely the driver behind this story. You don't need to be the first to be sued for slander. He is a journalist. He has the responsibility to check his sources before reporting. I'm sorry you like a scumbag so much."
hawks,3cv6qq,splintersmaster,0,Sat Jul 11 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"It's not about liking or disliking anyone. It's about trying to stay responsible against dumb arguments. You only singled out bernstein because you don't like him, that's irresponsible and unfair. The Wilson story is a non story as it was very Clearly a joke, any regular listener will tell you that. He is Not a journalist, he is a columnist and a damn good one at that, they have the highest rated sports show in the city and are recognized as one of the best in the country. How can you say he's the driver behind a story that he didn't break and didn't even talk about in those details until the national media picked it up?  Like I said before, hate him and don't listen all you want. Theres plenty of reason to do so, but let's just be fair otherwise you're being as bad as you claim him to be."
hawks,3cv6qq,KnightsoftheNi,18,Sat Jul 11 17:27:08 2015 UTC,I feel like this was a desperation trade. Didn't even come close to the original asking price because everyone knew it was too damned high.

It just sucks that the cap is over and we need to cut ties this way - he was definitely a franchise-like player in my eyes.  In his honor ill be keeping the flair till season start."
hawks,3cv6qq,Heavenisatree,69,Sat Jul 11 01:22:39 2015 UTC,"Worst trade I've seen us do. Johns was looking solid and sharp is still a top 6 winger. We traded them to a divisional rival.   We traded him for Daley, who has upwards of 3 mil cap hit.  And is complete shit. Basically stalberg.2 And garbutt, who is garbutt. Never want to see that man in a hawks uni.  I hope sharp gets his name lifted in the banners. No one ever agrees with me, but the man has been with us since the dark days. Has been the alternate captain and a huge part of our three cups. Completely deserves it."

hawks,3cv6qq,vultuream,26,Sat Jul 11 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you. We traded a top prospect defenseman and Sharp for player who suck at defense (like he gets caught out of position bad) and is exactly like Stalberg, fast as fuck but can't do anything with it  This sucks, our return for Sharp is the worse. Worse than Leddy since we got Pokka from the Isles.  And Fuck, Garbutt. That's even worse. He has 105 PIM in 75 Games in 2013-14 and 55 PIM in 67 games in 2014-15   The Hawks are one of the least penalized teams in the League. We've always been good at that. Grabutt is going to blow our PIM out of the water"
hawks,3cv6qq,Mikeydoes,11,Sat Jul 11 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"But, from what I've seen in the last 6 seasons, we are much, much more effective on the PK than that PP.  Maybe this is a long-con to keep us constantly short-handed to get those Hossa-Shortie goals."
hawks,3cv6qq,twentynineotters,2,Sat Jul 11 04:27:54 2015 UTC,"Ha, that is funny. From what I've been reading on just comments alone from Reddit. These guys are very good at what they do-- 1 is a scoring defensemen, and one is more the enforcer type that we don't have. Meaning, hopefully they will be used in roles and used more effectively than the Stars-- or 1 or both can be traded. I think Sharp is/was overvalued and everyone knew it. I certainly was hoping someone was stupid enough to take him for a ridiculous return."
hawks,3cv6qq,JodyChel,2,Sat Jul 11 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"While digging up links to back up claims made in a post on /r/hockey I thought I'd come share them here as well and reading through the replies it looks as though you all might like to see them.   Garbutt has the potential to be an integral part of future Hawks success. He's always been one step away. His discipline as you've noted is the issue. He has explosive speed and sees the ice extremely well. If Q can get him to buy into the disciplined style the Hawks play you're going to love Garbutt.   Likewise, hopefully the Hawks management understand what they're getting in Daley. If you utilize him on the PP unit and as a bottom pairing to shelter his 5v5 minutes he's going to be a stud. Daley has an incredibly quick and accurate shot for a d-man with wicked hands in tight to boot.   Sources for Garbutt: Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here.   Sources for Daley: Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here.  Best of luck to you all, I promise us Dallas Fans will take care of Sharp. We're all as equally sad to see Daley go. I had really hoped he'd retire after a career with the Stars, but I also wish him the best with you all. Dallas never could get him a cup, hopefully he can earn one with you all."

I remember watching him dominate the Wolves in the 2005 Calder Cup finals next to a young Mike Richards & Jeff Carter, and a reprehensible parasite named Jon Sim.   Then, I remember seeing a short blurb in the back of the Sun Times' sports section saying that the Hawks traded Matt Ellison for Patrick Sharp. Exciting news for a Hawks fan who was chomping at the bit to see the next wave of ""stars"" like Tony Salmelainen and Pavel Vorobiev.   Then, many years later in 2011 or 2012, my future wife and I were walking through her neighborhood of North Center, and spotted a very nice yet old fashioned couch in an alley behind a monstrosity of a new home. We decided to take the couch back to her place. I learned shortly later that Sharp had just moved into that house. Soon, the ""alley couch"" became the ""Patrick Sharp couch.""

When teams know You're in a tough spot, all power at the negotiating table goes to them. Thats really what has made bowman so special, despite being on the wrong side of negotiating power, he has still managed to pull off very solid deals (Saad for example, we got excellent return considering the circumstance).  Sharp was always going to be almost impossible though. Older player, high cap hit, debate-ably declining play, and everyone knew we had to dump him.  ALl that said, I do have to say i'm STILL dissapointed though, since we gave up a young prospect and only saved like 2M in space."

One of them being a very unintentional high sticking call and it seemed nothing was going his way. He went into the box and it looked like he was going to blow his lid. Seabs actually went out of the way and skated to the box, tapped him on his head and probably said something along the lines of ""we need you"" or something. Vid They turned it around after that and won in game 7."

Everyone knows we are in cap hell and NEED to shed salary so they bent us over a barrel and rejected any reasonable trades. Why Johns was added into this trade is beyond me when Sharp alone is more valuable than Daley and Garbutt. The cap it freed probably isn't even enough to sign one of Kruger and Oduya, let alone both. If we can dump Bickell for a late round pick then sign Kruger and Oduya I will feel better."

How does Top 6 winger + promising NHL ready young D = penalty liability (putting it nicely) and D who can't play D? On top of it all we didn't even clear much cap space which was the whole purpose of the trade!   Probably most angry about that. We all knew Sharpy had to go so we can have space  for guys like Kruger, we accepted it had to happen. Why do it if it wasn't going to clear enough room for anybody?!

This is price the Hawks had to pay for the cup run last year. It sucks.   Nobody likes the deal....but there was never going to be a deal that you could like. Stan was over a barrel. I'm not saying he couldn't have done a bit better (maybe you prefer draft picks) but honestly....I don't think there was much to get.

But I really think people underestimated how handicapped the Hawks were on this deal. This was like a moving sale.....you know they can't take it with them, so you can lowball the crap out of them because something is better than nothing.  Stan did probably wait too long. I just don't know if it made as much of a difference as so many seem sure of."

hawks,3cxshl,odd_orange,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"You have very little reason to be worried. For one point, they're not going to win the cup every single year. For another thing, I think this team is about as rounded and complete as they've had since 2010. Sharp is replaceable and Saad was more surprising than anything. Even with Saad they got a top prospect who's 20 and will be probably matching his production in a year or two, along with a solid 2 way 2nd line center they've been in need of. It'll be fine."
hawks,3cv5ja,tomBARCIK,44,Sat Jul 11 01:05:55 2015 UTC,WHY DID WE GIVE UP STEPHEN JOHNS?

hawks,3cv5ja,ChristopherT,30,Sat Jul 11 02:28:24 2015 UTC,The fact that Johns is in the deal suggests that Stan knows he can get Oduya at a price that works.  Not sure if that's just purely optimistic thinking.

hawks,3cv5ja,ItsMEMusic,2,Sat Jul 11 01:23:43 2015 UTC,And Oduya! Krugs and Oduya for less than 2 mil.
hawks,3cv5ja,sonicscrewdriveher,65,Sat Jul 11 01:47:41 2015 UTC,Dallas fans seem way too happy to get rid of garbutt and Daley. That's a bad sign. I think we got fucked on this one. Johns was promising.
hawks,3cv5ja,TheFitz023,75,Sat Jul 11 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"Stars fan here, and I can explan why my people are glad to get rid of him. First off, Daley was only bad last year. Before that, he was arguable our best defensman for the past...3 years or so I'd say?  Anyway Stars fans who are glad to see him go don't understand WHY he was bad. Here's what Trevor Daley is: a good, fast-skating number 4 defensman. However with the Stars, he was asked to be something he simply isn't: a number 1 defensman. To put it simple: Trevor Daley was a Trevor Daley who was asked to be a Duncan Keith. Needless to say, that set him up for failure.   90% of Dallas fans don't get this because they don't understand that people who AREN'T Sergei Zubov CAN'T be Sergei Zubov. It wasn't Daley's fault. But now that Daley won't asked to be THE guy on defense, he'll be much better. He's going to thrive for you guys on the 3rd pairing, assuming you hang on to Oduya. Even if you don't, he'll still be good on the 2nd pairing.   Furthermore, this takes pressure off of Keith. He'll still lead you in minutes, but he doesn't have to be superhuman.  Above all, Daley is the type of player coaches talk about when they use the phrase ""play the game the right way."" Go back and watch him during last year's WCQF against Anaheim. He played every second of every shift of every game like it was his last.   As for Garbutt, here's what he was in Dallas: a gritty 3rd line guy who plays his ass off, has a surprisingly good set of wheels, but takes a lot of stupid penalties. Dallas fans are glad to see him go because of the stupid penalties, but what many forget is he really cleaned up his act after getting suspended for a couple of games for slew footing someone, I forget who. He makes you deeper among your forwards.  I know it hurts losing Sharpie, so being okay with this trade for you isn't easy right now. But trust me, this makes you deeper especially on defense. Hope this gives piece of mind. Sincerely: one of the few non-Hawk haters."
hawks,3cv5ja,GS_Slut,13,Sat Jul 11 01:14:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the different perspective on things! I know Sharpie is in good hands with you guys! Take good care of Mr. gorgeous!!
hawks,3cv5ja,ManWithASquareHead,8,Sat Jul 11 04:19:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a perspective that isn't ""haha blackhawks!""  Good luck with Sharp, I'm going to miss him.  He saw the flaming dumpster, at the portable toilet depo, that the Hawks once were.  I'm sure if any of your young guys bitch, he will set them right."
hawks,3cv5ja,cgludko,3,Sat Jul 11 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"That's reassuring, thank you."
hawks,3cv5ja,Stillflying,3,Sat Jul 11 06:49:22 2015 UTC,Thank you thank you thank you. I recently moved to Texas and I'm trying out having the stars as a number two team. I've gotten really down about the sheer amount of hawks hate I've seen though. It's truly impressive how much some of you guys despise us. And then seeing all the jubilation among stars fans about this trade made it all worse. So thank you for the perspective.
hawks,3cv5ja,bearlytame,2,Sat Jul 11 09:55:12 2015 UTC,"It's truly impressive how much some of you guys despise us.   It's more hate directed at the bandwagoners who pick teams based on what's ""hot"" or trendy.  Chicago's picked up a lot of them over the years, and they have a tendency to show up at Stars home games against various opponents wearing the Chicago sweater they bought because Kane or Toews are widely-known names even among casuals.  They tend to come across as probably the more assholish ""fans"" as they tend to know nothing or little about the game, but damned if they're not the ultimate authority in their own minds."
hawks,3cv5ja,YankeeBravo,2,Sat Jul 11 12:29:23 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. This is an okay trade.
hawks,3cv5ja,raygun2thehead,2,Sat Jul 11 15:29:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your insight. I'm not as upset about Sharp as I am losing another prospect. Scotty is trading them like he doesn't realize they are eventually going to make up our team.   Gives some interesting perspective on where we are headed, although it make and nervous to be honest. With Q saying tivo is moving to center, anisimov coming in, I don't get what's going on. Toews, anisimov, tivo, then... Kruger, I thought. Where does garbutt fit? This makes me nervous we bounce Kruger, which would be awful. Chemistry matters, and we are losing a lot of pieces..."
hawks,3cv5ja,king_of_pancakes,11,Sat Jul 11 05:41:57 2015 UTC,"Daley's a good player, maybe it takes playing in a better team to bring it out of him? (Remember how much better Oduya looked after a full season with the Hawks)  I'm upset that Johns was packaged in, though. He was the most NHL ready of our D prospects. Hawks need to keep Oduya now. Upset about Sharp but that was always coming."
hawks,3cv5ja,the_rah_monster,11,Sat Jul 11 14:31:23 2015 UTC,Probably should have given Morin instead of Johns?
hawks,3cv5ja,Cartortus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:39:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe. Dallas probably wanted a top prospect, though."
hawks,3cv5ja,the_rah_monster,2,Sat Jul 11 03:45:17 2015 UTC,You think so? I would have said TVR>Pokka>johns
hawks,3cv5ja,king_of_pancakes,3,Sat Jul 11 07:58:47 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really counting TVR since he played a bunch of games and Q seems to like him but I guess he does still count as a rookie. But yeah, I did feel that Johns was more NHL ready than Pokka, but I feel Pokka has a higher ceiling (offensive ability), whereas Johns would've been more of a shutdown guy."
hawks,3cv5ja,the_rah_monster,2,Sat Jul 11 14:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is probably a fair assessment. I don't follow the icehogs as closely as I would like most of the time truth be told, but just going from what I have seen, Pokka, outside of TVR, is the one I will go apeshit to lose. He has been described as a kid with crazy potential, and I would have to agree based on the little I have seen."
hawks,3cv5ja,king_of_pancakes,2,Sat Jul 11 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"I don't follow the Hogs much either, honestly. But I've heard the same things. With the young defenseman the Hawks have traded this off-season (Paliotta as well), I'm hoping Pokka doesn't get packaged into a potential Bickell deal."
hawks,3cv5ja,the_rah_monster,2,Sat Jul 11 16:59:58 2015 UTC,You bite your tongue!!!
hawks,3cv5ja,king_of_pancakes,2,Sun Jul 12 00:58:26 2015 UTC,"It's ok, now that I said it it's jinxed :P"
hawks,3cv5ja,the_rah_monster,2,Sun Jul 12 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"Good lord, I hope you did. Tvr bundled with versteeg, pokka with bickell, tivo traded for future considerations..."
hawks,3cv5ja,king_of_pancakes,2,Sun Jul 12 01:23:02 2015 UTC,Bowman would be driven out of town!
hawks,3cv5ja,the_rah_monster,21,Sun Jul 12 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"God damn where did the negative nannies come from? Does anyone remember playing Dallas? Those guys will either change or be shipped out under Q. And even then they'll be playing with fucking rockstars. Count the posts Dallas, sharpie hits them a lot."
hawks,3cv5ja,Gobyinmypants,2,Sun Jul 12 01:33:50 2015 UTC,"Y'all are in a win now mindset, Dallas isn't. Think about this. Would Dallas trade our best prospect? It really wouldn't matter for who, but no GM is going to leverage against the future for the present if you're running the Stars. To the opposite end of the spectrum, the Blackhawks aren't going to leverage against the present for the future. Daley is a strong to great supporting/complimentary/role player. When the spotlight was on Daley to be THE defenseman, with no supporting/complimentary/role players of his own, you get frustrated. And that's not to say he was bad as THE defenseman, he was great at times over the last 4 seasons, it just wasn't good enough to carry the team defensively. He plays smart and ferocious. He will be GREAT for the Blackhawks.  Super excited about Johns."
hawks,3cv5ja,telefawx,2,Sat Jul 11 01:37:50 2015 UTC,I like Daley. They're probably just happy to be getting Sharp. Also Daley is coming off the best year of his career point-wise.
hawks,3cv5ja,tgross25,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"I love Daley. He's a Vet who's still fast and I wouldn't underestimate his presence in the locker room. A nicer guy off the ice is hard to find too. That said, I do think he's way past his prime, but he will work his ass off for you guys. Garbutt on the other hand. I am not sad to see him go."
hawks,3cv5ja,theywillnotsing,95,Sat Jul 11 01:41:36 2015 UTC,Our best prospect along w/ Sharp for that? I'm disappointed..
hawks,3cv5ja,JodyChel,37,Sat Jul 11 03:32:02 2015 UTC,And it doesnt solve our cap issues at all.  Still not gonna sign Kruger with this.  And Johns was going to likely be a solution to what D we use this season.  I'm finding it hard to see any silver lining here.
hawks,3cv5ja,Stillflying,9,Sat Jul 11 01:08:09 2015 UTC,50% retained on Garbage and Daley has a decent contract even though he sucks at defense.
hawks,3cv5ja,Patrick_Kane,11,Sat Jul 11 01:21:25 2015 UTC,Sharp's 6.  1/2 of garbutt is 900k and daley is 3.3 so we only shed less than 2 million on this deal.
hawks,3cv5ja,Mentalseppuku,10,Sat Jul 11 01:42:15 2015 UTC,Yeah. Not good. Not good at all.   I'm starting to think that Scotty was calling the shots for a while and stopped last summer.
hawks,3cv5ja,Patrick_Kane,46,Sat Jul 11 02:12:51 2015 UTC,This is the worst part in my opinion
hawks,3cv5ja,Cavetroll771,21,Sat Jul 11 02:15:09 2015 UTC,"I loved that fact that we had a Notre Dame guy, let alone Stephen Johns. This one hurts."
hawks,3cv5ja,martykelly18,10,Sat Jul 11 01:10:35 2015 UTC,Yeah. Losing Johns really hurts. I was really excited to see his NHL play this year based on his AHL season last year.
hawks,3cv5ja,mongoos3,13,Sat Jul 11 01:37:04 2015 UTC,Best prospect?
hawks,3cv5ja,computer_monk,24,Sat Jul 11 01:39:42 2015 UTC,Maybe not best but Johns was solid and considered NHL ready. We've a few promising D prospects but few of them aren't ripe yet (and we keep trading them away?)
hawks,3cv5ja,Stillflying,5,Sat Jul 11 01:21:18 2015 UTC,It does seem like we've been dishing away a lot of prospects this offseason. I trust that they know what they're doing tho
hawks,3cv5ja,computer_monk,4,Sat Jul 11 01:23:21 2015 UTC,So we've 2.5 mil in space. That's enough to keep kruger. Oduya goes goodbye though. I'd like to think stan has a plan for defense...
hawks,3cv5ja,Stillflying,3,Sat Jul 11 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"We don't have anywhere near 2.5m in space.  This move cleared only 1.7m, and we were already 800k or so over."
hawks,3cv5ja,MidgetLovingMaxx,2,Sat Jul 11 01:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I read a tweet just after the trade saying that's how much space we had, might have been premature / miscalculation on their part."
hawks,3cv5ja,Stillflying,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:57:34 2015 UTC,Yeah apparently we've been looking at  Ehrhoff so we'll see how that plays out
hawks,3cv5ja,computer_monk,6,Sat Jul 11 04:00:05 2015 UTC,Prospects come and go - Stanley Cups are forever.  We'll be ok.
hawks,3cv5ja,theduderman,4,Sat Jul 11 01:33:37 2015 UTC,That was deeper than the cap hole we've dug ourselves this summer.
hawks,3cv5ja,JToews19,7,Sat Jul 11 03:12:03 2015 UTC,Hes not our best prospect
hawks,3cv5ja,djb2287,2,Sat Jul 11 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"right? we have dano, panarin, denault, tikhonov, and TVR all who have a pretty good chance at cracking the squad. sure we could use D but we have keith, hammer, and seabs locked up for the next couple years. yes next year will be painful but theres time to build the D."
hawks,3cv5ja,ddengel,7,Sat Jul 11 01:22:43 2015 UTC,Seabrook will be UFA next year.
hawks,3cv5ja,shitsngiggles22,3,Sat Jul 11 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"This. Dear god Bowmam better have plans on resigning Seabs.   My guess is near the trade deadline he will trade Seabs, McNeil and a draft pick for Johnny Oduya."
hawks,3cv5ja,ChristopherT,3,Sat Jul 11 06:47:06 2015 UTC,Sharp needed to go in order to resign Kruger and Oduya...both of which are more valuable than Sharp.  Its not about what we get in the trade but what we can do with the cap space.   We still need to mive some pieces to resign both of thise guys tho.  I think kruger is the most underrated player on the team.
hawks,3cv5ja,Panaran,12,Sat Jul 11 14:27:57 2015 UTC,Except this trade even with the 50% retained doesnt create a lot of cap space.  And Kruger isn't underrated. We all know what he's worth.
hawks,3cv5ja,Stillflying,16,Sat Jul 11 01:40:56 2015 UTC,I'm gonna miss Sharp so much... The hawks just won't be the same without his beautiful face gracing the locker room

hawks,3cv5ja,DomCaboose,3,Sat Jul 11 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"If you thought that, you were a little optimistic.  Everyone knows what Sharp is recently and his salary is not worth it.  He cost too much for the production he was giving.  He was still solid, but not the great guy he used to be.  Age and contract hurts a lot of the trade value for Sharp."
hawks,3cv5ja,SpechalEd,38,Sat Jul 11 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"Daley and garbutt have 5.1 mill combined in salary. So if no salary is retained, Hawks just got 700k in room. That would fix no problems"

On the plus side, Trevor Daley is a solid scoring D-man who can easily be slotted with either Hjammer or even a young guy like TVR or Rundblad. At 31, he's got some experience. Garbutt will likely be slotted at 3rd or 4th line center. I know Oduya is waiting to see if he can sign cheaper, but picking up a veteran D-man makes me wonder if Stan is politely saying thanks but no thanks. Essentially, we took one man's cap space, turned it into two men, and gave up a top prospect for that privilege.   Don't like it, but don't hate it. Still trusting that young Bowman knows hockey better than me.  Edit: point taken, no one cares where this orginated"

hawks,3cv5ja,rockyrococo999,7,Sat Jul 11 01:51:06 2015 UTC,Oh come on. It's not like the other league GMs are going to do the Hawks a favor.  Stanbo got what he could and saved a few bucks on this trade. It's not going to be the last trade and I wouldn't be surprised if one of these two get flipped in the next 72 hours.
hawks,3cv5ja,19Hawks,2,Sat Jul 11 01:55:12 2015 UTC,"No, we just helped fill the roster with role players and freed up the space to sign Kruger. Daley will get some decent ice time, and I'm pretty sure he's replacing Oduya. He actually is a very similar player to Oduya, and averaged more TOI than 27. His -13 was terrible, however it is very out of character looking at his lifetime stats, an anomaly it seems, especially considering that it was a career year for him points wise. Seems the negative has at least something to do with pairing. Everyone is acting like Johns was a roster lock, and he was hardly that. We've had some major changes, but that's life in the salary cap era. I'll take the Cups and losing some fan favorites over the reverse. One last thing. Obviously our PP will look different next year with the subtraction of Sharp. Considering he was often on as a fourth forward, I think Daley fills his PP time. Oduya did not spend a lot of time on the PK, about 1:30. Daley spent twice that on the PK for DAL. So I think part of the attraction for Stan was Daley's flexibility. It will be interesting to see who he's paired with."

I really hate the addition of Daley and Garbut though. Daley is worse than Oduya, and from my perspective thats what he was brought in for. Garbut is a 4th line center, and thats what Kruger is.

hawks,3cw0n4,mikeypat15,2,Sat Jul 11 13:47:35 2015 UTC,"The Hawks will lose some offensive production this season.  Losing Saad and Sharp will be a dent.  Panarin, Dano, Ansimov will hopefully fill that hole, but may need a year or two to build in the system.  So what do you do if your offensive production may drop a bit, you strengthen the D.  With that said, if the Hawks can trade Bickell, they most likely can then sign Kruger and Oduya.  That would give us.  Duncan-Seabrook Hammer-Oduya TVR-Daley  Runblad our 7th.    That is a pretty incredible D core.  Yes Johns was ready to make the jump, but who is most likely more NHL ready come October 7th, Daley or Johns.  I think that is what Stan was looking for when he pulled the trigger on last night's trade."

Whether it's him admitting he's called out guys for not scoring in pressers or his epic penalty box moment with Toews...it's clear he doesn't feel like he needs the letter on his chest to lead.  I am sure it will be discussed with him, and he could easily say ""no, kane's our big money guy and needs to step up and lead now...give it to him"".  And he could keep being him.  He may feel more comfortable not having it."

He's got no defensive skills anyways, might as well just be a winger and we can use him on the PP. If Buff can do it, it's with a shot right? He can take over Bickell's spot on the left side. We move Bickell out of town, couple him with Morin or something.  With that we'll have enough cap space to keep Oduya in the D!   Of course that's probably a fantasy my mind has concocted to make something out of this nightmare... I'll probably wake up tomorrow and somehow Stan lost both Kruger and Oduya or worse."

Many of you were flipping out at the thought of Desjardins replacing Ben Smith, and we all seem to be fine with that now. Garbutt possesses more offensive upside than Desi or Smith.   I predict we'll get about 12-14 goals out of him this season, and while he'll make trips to the penalty box, he and Shaw will be earning us a number of power plays."

Not a huge deal, just sucks that we have to lose the pick. Probably Bickell + Morin + 5th to ARI for a 7th. Something like that.  Versteeg is movable. Easily.  Nothing new to see here, folks."

Bickell will go somewhere that looks to be getting bigger, but we'll keep salary. Versteeg may not move at all, but I don't know if we need him to. Next year is another year, and will worry about that when it gets here. Theres always more moves to be made, and the cap may very well go up. Still not gonna panic.

Gotta get it all off my chest here.   Someone take Bickell off our hands please! Any offer that takes him off our hands without retaining salary is a gift. We've GOT to be able to package him with someone so that we don't retain anything right? Out of curiosity, what's the rule about placing him on waivers?   Kruger is a must re-sign in my opinion. He's the glue keeps the bottom 6 together. A big reason I'm excited Desi coming back is to see that 4th line again. By the hockey gods Stanbo if you lose Krugs I will have to do something drastic.  The rest I'm pretty ambivalent about. Sharp would be the easiest to trade and at least get SOMETHING back, but we are short a top 6 winger without Saad. If Stanbo can somehow wing it so that he stays, at least til the trade deadline, I'd be grateful. It would raise his value since top line minutes will give him a stats boost and it'd give time to slide someone (Dano maybe?) into the spot. But if he goes I understand (will still extremely emotional about it though, there will be much tears)  Oduya would be nice to have. It'd be great to keep the top 4 D intact. And I know it's a business but the fact he's willing to wait and maybe take a discount means a lot to me. And I have a horrible feeling if Oduya doesn't come back, Q might push for another veteran D and we'd be in the Rozsival situation all over again.  Versteeg.. One moment I want him gone and the next I love him. But there's a lot of guys down in Rockford who I'd love to see given a shot on the Hawks, clearing out roster spots would be good.   Rant done."
hawks,3cr4cz,yorozuyajin-chan,6,Fri Jul 10 03:32:00 2015 UTC,"Move sharp and Bicks, keep the rest"
hawks,3cr4cz,Coop3,5,Fri Jul 10 03:08:25 2015 UTC,"Trade off Sharpy. Sad, but necessary.  Find a way to keep Oduya, quite a noble act to hold off negotiations by him. Sign Kruger immediately, he's essential to our game and future. Somehow, somehow unload Bickell's contract only retaining bare minimum. Steel can stay or go, preferably stay though. He's kinda like comic relief in tense situations, I.e. http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2015/06/face_meet_post_watch_kris_vers.html"
hawks,3cr4cz,rctrickysnappss,5,Fri Jul 10 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"Kruger is priority number #1. If we can sign him to a 4 or 5 year deal at 2.125 we have four centers locked up for the next few seasons. He's also the anchor to our PK unit.  Oduya is more valuable than some think, I believe. He would be a top-3 defenseman on most teams, even considering his poor play early last season. If we can lock him at 3 years x 4M AAV, I think it will benefit us in the long run, particularly considering what I'm going to say later.  Versteeg is a no-brainer. At 2.2M he's worth keeping. He's a viable Top-6 winger still, and has good chemistry with much of the team.  Sharp is expendable in my mind, but should only be traded if the return is decent. There are other ways to shed salary bloat, and if we can't get a first or 2nd plus a strong prospect, I'd rather hold Sharp and move him at the deadline.  Bickell's contract is awful. If we need the cap space, I'm comfortable buying him out or trading him + a pick to a floor team. Maybe Bickell + Morin + 5th to ARI for a 7th?  Now, the controversial opinion. Seabrook. He's one of our best players, and part of the core of our team. HOWEVER, there's no question Bowman has had at least preliminary discussions with his agent about what Seabrook really wants after this year. Judging by rumors (and logic) I wouldn't be surprised if Seabrook wants to get paid, as he should. I don't believe locking Seabrook up until he's 39 at 7M+ will benefit the Hawks in the long run. In fact, I believe Seabrook's future is probably a less bright version of Letang. An anchor contract for a player whose play will continue to decline. If we can move Seabrook to a team like Dallas for Esa Lindell, a first, and another prospect/player/pick, I would be inclined to do it. But that's me."

hawks,3col4f,Skweres88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:13:12 2015 UTC,"Really?  Size doesn't mean much.  The hawks play a possession game and if you're the one hitting guys it means you don't have possession.      That's the problem with wanting a big guy to park in front of the net, it takes that guy out of the cycle and hurts possession."
hawks,3col4f,Mentalseppuku,2,Fri Jul 10 01:31:54 2015 UTC,The hawks do well right now because we have speed. Speed fades. And as it fades we need people like Hossa who can take a hit and stay on their skates.
hawks,3col4f,Skweres88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"The team isn't that fast individually (less so after trading Saad), they break out quickly.  Possession is this team's game, picking up guys simply for their size and not their ability isn't going to help, it's going to impede the team's ability to play it's possession game."

hawks,3col4f,Mentalseppuku,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:13:06 2015 UTC,Yea but sometimes you need big guys who are tough to knock off the puck in order to keep possession. You can't always rely on skill.
hawks,3col4f,LouChainz88,3,Fri Jul 10 06:09:58 2015 UTC,We didn't have any of those who were contributing this year and we did just fine.  Kane is tiny and he's extremely hard to knock off the puck.  Size doesn't mean anything.
hawks,3col4f,Mentalseppuku,2,Fri Jul 10 11:14:15 2015 UTC,And yet he took one really weak push and broke his collarbone. Size can be the difference between people staying on their skates and we happen to have issues with people staying standing when playing larger teams.
hawks,3col4f,Skweres88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:06:50 2015 UTC,"And yet he took one really weak push and broke his collarbone.    He lost an edge and went awkwardly into the boards.  We have no issue playing larger teams, and it's been pretty blatantly obvious that the ""hit chicago until they're not good"" game plan doesn't work.  We've had at most one big body in each of our cup wins and despite having some good performances in '10 and '13 those were mainly due to sitting in front of the net and having the actual skill guys drive possession.    This idea that you need big strong hitting players is why teams end up getting bogged done and playing like shit.  Look at the last few winning teams.  Boston was the only one that was physical, and they had a ton of skill.  Teams that add size simply for the sake of adding size are the ones in the lottery draft, not the ones competing for the cup."
hawks,3col4f,Mentalseppuku,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:17:07 2015 UTC,"We've had at most one big body in each of our cup wins and despite having some good performances in '10 and '13 those were mainly due to sitting in front of the net and having the actual skill guys drive possession.    I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you. But right now we have speed. And when our skill players start to slow down we will need some size to keep them on their skates.   Boston was the only one that was physical, and they had a ton of skill   What about the Kings? They are a very skilled and fairly large team with two cups. In my eyes we are the outlier. We are skilled and really fast which has given us 3 cups in 6 years. The other three went to skilled physical teams. Did we win more, absolutely, but speed fades faster than strength does."
hawks,3col4f,Skweres88,0,Fri Jul 10 14:23:54 2015 UTC,"And when our skill players start to slow down we will need some size to keep them on their skates.   This is absurd.  So when Patrick Kane slows down we need some big guy...to keep Patrick Kane on his skates.  How exactly do you envision that working?  The idea that we're just going to hit the wall and all these talented players are suddenly going to move like molasses is absurd.  Hossa isn't fast and he's doing pretty damn well for himself.  In fact, most of the Hawks aren't all that fast.   What about the Kings?   They aren't an overly physical 'size for size's sake' team.  They're a possession team.  They win by skill not by checking the other team into submission."
hawks,3col4f,Mentalseppuku,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"So when Patrick Kane slows down we need some big guy...to keep Patrick Kane on his skates   Having enforcers will keep Kane on his skates. And I'm also talking about the future, when we lose some of these skilled players we can replace them with players who can stay on their skates.    Hossa isn't fast and he's doing pretty damn well for himself   Hossa is the exact type of player I'm talking about. We are adding players that have skill but can't be pushed around easily. This helps in front of the net.   They aren't an overly physical 'size for size's sake' team. They're a possession team. They win by skill not by checking the other team into submission.   They do use their size to help them maintain possession though, its a lot easier to maintain possession when you aren't being pushed around. And we may win, but we get pushed around a lot, and there's always room for improvement. I never said I'm looking at them to start a team to just check the other teams. Having some larger but equally skilled forwards will help us maintain possession and disrupt the defenders in front of their net. Hossa is a perfect example, he's not a goon, but he's large enough that he can't be pushed around.   Obviously we don't see eye to eye, and that's fine. I completely see where you are coming from and I don't want a team of goons either."
hawks,3col4f,Skweres88,2,Fri Jul 10 14:44:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you need a team full of big goons to check players into the boards to gain submission. I'm saying you need a combination of size and skill on your team if you wanna win. You need small skilled players like Kane and you need big physical players who can skate like Seabrook. I said nothing about checking players into submission, but when you're a big guy who can skate you're hard to knock off the puck. To say size doesn't mean anything in hockey is so ridiculous"

Plus, Shawzie goes for the sloppy seconds on goals, even if the goalie gives up a small rebound right in front of his pads. If Shaw is on the ice, he'll usually be here digging at the puck.

hawks,3ctdxg,ohmylantern20,2,Fri Jul 10 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"Just this past season, where I'll admit Sharp was pretty useless and injured, he had 14 power play points while Shaw had only 6.  So from a numbers standpoint, his impact on the powerplay isn't evident.  Granted 14 PPP isn't the greatest but this was definitely a down year for him.  I'm not saying to get rid of him but that statement is a little over the top."
hawks,3ctdxg,hchux,0,Fri Jul 10 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"If it got a deal done where you packaged him with bickell or sharp I'd do it.  I know he's a fan favorite but if you look at him objectively as a player and what he brings to the team, its not a whole lot.  Certainly replaceable.  If its just him then his contract isn't worth it, I'd keep him but if he can get a deal done with a big contract then I would for sure dump him."
hawks,3ctdxg,ohmylantern20,3,Fri Jul 10 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be rude, but you really don't know much about what he does off and on the ice, nor how hockey works in the greasy areas. Andrew Shaw SUCKS to play against. That's great for us, we're not a big, checking team."
hawks,3ctdxg,hchux,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:53:07 2015 UTC,I know exactly what he does in the crease and in the locker room.  I'm not saying his role isn't needed but if it gets a deal done with a larger contract that is well worth it imo.  A lot of people let their like for him as a personality cloud his true value as a player.  He's not irreplaceable.  But he is relatively cheap so I wouldn't trade him unless it was to sweeten a deal with a larger contract.

hawks,3cngmh,hchux,7,Thu Jul 9 12:46:05 2015 UTC,I just got called this year for season tickets for SRO and I passed and said I'd wait for real seats. I put my name on the waiting list after  the 2009 season before the first cup season. That should give you some clue on how long it takes.
hawks,3cngmh,vballallstr4life,3,Thu Jul 9 15:54:42 2015 UTC,The people that purchased season tickets for SRO just jumped over everyone in line for getting seats.  The Hawks offer season ticket holders the chance to move (which rarely happens) and then any openings go to the wait list.  Last 5 years has been a 99% return rate of season ticket holders.

hawks,3ck2tg,Tornsys,2,Wed Jul 8 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"Nowhere near garbage, sure, but it's escaping those former Hawks that is going to make them a better team. They finally get away from the Campbell contract after this season - sure they may re-sign him, but it will be much more cap friendly this time around. Bolland has an awful contract (highest paid forward) and Pirri shouldn't sniff top 6 minutes above their other centers.  What's promising about the Panthers is the loads of young talent both on the roster and coming up in the next few years. They've got a killer 1-2 punch in Bjustad & Barkov, with guys like Rocco Grimaldi & Kyle Rau, Vince Trochek on the way there. Wingers like Huberdeau & Reilly Smith round out some solid top forwards.  Ekblad, Kulikov, & Gudbranson are going to be the core of a stellar D core that improved a ton over the course of last season."
hawks,3ck2tg,crashthenet,2,Wed Jul 8 15:47:35 2015 UTC,Very true. I bring up the former hawks usually because the names stand out to hawks fans who wouldn't otherwise give other teams the time of day.  Especially a team like Florida who really hasn't done much.   Very true about Bolland I don't understand why they sought after them and I really wish Hayes was still on the team.  Very excited to hear that Jager stayed and will love to see him help shape these young guys the have coming.

hawks,3cbeg3,PrisonedMuffin,67,Mon Jul 6 16:25:03 2015 UTC,YES THANN FUCKING CHRIST!!!! He is being smart and waitin for cap space!!!  THANK GOD
hawks,3cbeg3,Cartortus,7,Mon Jul 6 16:46:16 2015 UTC,Can someone ELI5?
hawks,3cbeg3,redditin_at_work,38,Mon Jul 6 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Can only operate at a certain percentage over the cap. My guess is we'll either see Oduya or Kruger sign before a big trade, and then a quick signing after the trade. I honestly think we'll keep both of those players, and if we do, this team is LOADED with talent for next year.   Probably not an ELI5 answer, but thats just my take on it."
hawks,3cbeg3,chocolate_chip_kelly,8,Mon Jul 6 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Kruger isn't going to take us 10% over, I wish Stanbo would just sign him, and let us all sleep better at night. Being over cap is honestly less scary then Kruger floating around out there...  Last year he basically signed Brad out of the gate not giving a damn, we were over all summer and didn't figured out the salary cap til the last minute with the Leddy trade."
hawks,3cbeg3,yorozuyajin-chan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well, last year there were fewer moving parts, that glaring hole at 2C and an obvious fit in Richards. The drama was if Leddy or Sharp would go and how the Toews and Kane extensions would shape up, and that stuff did drag on though the offseason. So Bowman is working at the same pace so far."
hawks,3cbeg3,ChrisPummer,2,Tue Jul 7 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, and I'm guessing his contract or the NHLPA gives him the option to go to arbitration after a certain period of time?"
hawks,3cbeg3,redditin_at_work,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:43:05 2015 UTC,I think they can opt for it at any time they're negotiating? But kruger has only ever been a 4th liner so his exact contract value may be convoluted.
hawks,3cbeg3,chocolate_chip_kelly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"Last I heard, people were talking about Oduya being ""as good as gone"". Has something changed?"
hawks,3cbeg3,peaksix,7,Mon Jul 6 21:58:38 2015 UTC,Stan said that he was hoping to bring him back.  Guessing Saad leaving fixed shit.
hawks,3cbeg3,chocolate_chip_kelly,8,Mon Jul 6 22:17:40 2015 UTC,yeah he freed up a lot of potential cap that was sidelined for the saadfathers contract.   i hate to say it but quickly peeling a bandaid this way does open up a lot of other interesting options.

hawks,3cbeg3,Gobyinmypants,26,Mon Jul 6 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"No, this is a great thing! Basically it means that Kruger isn't trying to break the bank and is willing to wait on the Blackhawks to clear cap space so he can sign a contract."

hawks,3cbeg3,injun_head,14,Mon Jul 6 19:12:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would rather sign him for 2. If/when the cap goes up, these players giving discounts should get fucking paid. They are accepting less now to keep us together, we best pay them when we can."
hawks,3cbeg3,king_of_pancakes,13,Mon Jul 6 19:55:54 2015 UTC,"In theory I really wish that were a good option, but it's impossible to have contract negotioations that revolve around ""we'll pay you more around what we wish we could pay you in a couple years.""  Between injuries, performance, team cap issues and whatnot it's super hard for a player to go along with the idea of being paid ""later."""
hawks,3cbeg3,Tornsys,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure. It can't be. However, in a few years, when these guys come up again, if they are still performing, I hope we pay them what they're worth. If we do, there's incentive to give home town discounts. There's still the risk, but a better possible reward. Maybe even pay a bit more than what other teams might."
hawks,3cbeg3,king_of_pancakes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:34:25 2015 UTC,Cleary did it for the Wings and the fans fucking hate him.
hawks,3cbeg3,BlueLineMenace,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"Ok....the point was not whether or not players have ever decided to bank on getting paid later versus being paid what they are worth now, but I can appreciate your contribution to the discussion.  The point was that it's a difficult thing to ask of a player, that's all."
hawks,3cbeg3,Tornsys,7,Tue Jul 7 01:14:39 2015 UTC,And the point of my comment was to illustrate how fans can turn on a player even when they do something like that for a team. The WIngs begged Cleary to not sign with Pittsburgh at one point and that they'd take care of him. So he did it. But now he is half the player he used to be so Wings fans have turned on him because of what is now a higher than it should be contract. I'd hate to see that happen in our case here.
hawks,3cbeg3,BlueLineMenace,3,Tue Jul 7 01:21:07 2015 UTC,I missed your point and I appreciate your response. Muuuch better friend!
hawks,3cbeg3,Tornsys,7,Tue Jul 7 01:22:05 2015 UTC,kruger is worth 2-3.5M
hawks,3cbeg3,Konker101,10,Mon Jul 6 17:57:27 2015 UTC,2.5 is a fair price IMO. We simply can't afford paying much more for a 4th liner regardless of how good he is
hawks,3cbeg3,pascal21,15,Mon Jul 6 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"Starting PK center tho, which is a huge deal."
hawks,3cbeg3,HollowImage,9,Mon Jul 6 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"this is a big deal. we're so often so manly that we get called for too much man, having a solid, dependable guy to work that PK is clutch af. krugs is right there."
hawks,3cbeg3,JohnnysRoadHouse,4,Mon Jul 6 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"I hope he get's around 4yrs 3.5 to 4, because the only reason he's a fourth liner is because Q trusts him in that role, and he accepts the challenge.  I can easily see him as 3rd line center, maybe 2nd depending on the team, but he sacrifices his offensive game for us.  I think he was a top 6 center for sweden in the olympics"
hawks,3cbeg3,livinlifeman,6,Mon Jul 6 23:07:06 2015 UTC,For the love of God give him a solid deal! We NEED Krugs!!!! He's a beast is so many aspects of the game.

hawks,3cbj9y,Cartortus,19,Mon Jul 6 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"Its odd, because I would have had more empathy towards Desi leaving than Saad. The difference between 1.5 over two years and 2 million is pretty substantial, especially when you are a more senior player. On the flip side, I can't help but feel a bit burned by someone taking 6 X 6 over our 5X5.   I get it, though. Don't do anyone any favours, its a short window, its a business, get as much as you can, etc. I get all the arguments. I see that I am in the minority. I just personally feel that its greedy. I know everyone hates that opinion, but I can't help it. I feel you are leaving the fans who love you, the club who invested in you, the city, all of that. It just seems that when you are going to make 25 million, you could afford to leave some possible raise on the table out of loyalty.   I don't hate the guy, wish him luck and all of that. Its just my opinion. And it isn't just for sports or hockey, or anything. I personally feel that when you are making in excess of 20 million, I can't see the desire for more. Obviously market value drives up costs and salaries and all that. It just hurts a bit to see that."
hawks,3cbj9y,king_of_pancakes,4,Mon Jul 6 19:53:45 2015 UTC,I'm just happy he didn't get traded to an immediate cup threat.
hawks,3cbj9y,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,2,Tue Jul 7 21:19:12 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely! Perfectly phrased
hawks,3cbj9y,Patrick_Kane,15,Tue Jul 7 00:14:02 2015 UTC,He's also a good egg. With this team we could make a big fucking quiche.

hawks,3cbj9y,AndrewD1022,3,Mon Jul 6 18:55:03 2015 UTC,I think after he took that penalty late in Game 6 vs Tampa was when it kind of clicked for him. Hawks killed the penalty and he skated over to the bench with I think a little over a minute left in the game. Instead of getting reamed Quenneville put him right back on the ice to close out the game and showed a shitload of confidence in him. Coming from the situation in San Jose to being on ice to close out a Final game had to have helped that. I'm glad he's sticking around because that's a ridiculous 4th line.
hawks,3cbj9y,chocolate_chip_kelly,3,Tue Jul 7 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"What was he offered elsewhere? Or, do we have an idea what his actual worth is?"
hawks,3cbj9y,Coop3,7,Mon Jul 6 19:12:59 2015 UTC,Probably 1.75-2mil. That's what I would offer him. He'd be a third liner on another team. He's a tough dude. But he knows he's going to play on the 4th line here and he doesn't care. He must really love playing with Shaw and Kruger.
hawks,3cajlw,mylifebelike5,62,Mon Jul 6 11:48:40 2015 UTC,i assume trading bickell is the plan and keeping sharp at this point as we have a 50 pt deficit to make up with the loss of #20...theres a sentence i never thought i would of typed a month ago

hawks,3cajlw,foofighters92,24,Mon Jul 6 15:05:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Arty could be pushing 50 this season by himself. After Sochi he went back to the BJs and lit it up after playing with Ovi and seeing what it takes to be a star. Then last season he played on a team that was half career AHLers."
hawks,3cajlw,Alternative_Reality,28,Mon Jul 6 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"Part of me is still heartbroken over Saad, and the other part of me is so fucking excited to see what havoc the Hawks can create with Ani, Dano and Panarin in the line up! And special shout out to Desi, I am really happy we resigned him, he seems to love it here with us and he looked great on that fourth line with Kruger (still need to sign) and shaw (who I think we should resign next year along with Seabs)"
hawks,3cajlw,foofighters92,-10,Mon Jul 6 15:32:25 2015 UTC,Kruger signed.  Don't forget we have Tevu Turducken for a full year to put up some points.

hawks,3cajlw,Squabbles123,4,Mon Jul 6 17:42:55 2015 UTC,"He was traded.  He didn't ditch.  The trade was forced by the hawks salary cap situation, not by him.  If they hadn't overpaid paid a couple other players he'd possibly still be here.  Players can't and shouldn't adjust their negotiations based on the teams financial needs.  Unless you want a bob pulford era again.  It's been a week, quit crying."

hawks,3cajlw,Squabbles123,2,Mon Jul 6 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"i mean, its 6 more million dollars over the life of the contract. thats not really a small amount when you made 875k last year. he wants to go be the main player somewhere else, and he's going to learn its way harder than playing next to toews. plus he wanted a long term deal, and we didn't want to give it to him."
hawks,3cajlw,chocolate_chip_kelly,7,Mon Jul 6 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Am I sad he left? Yes I am. Do I still respect him, You bet your sweet ass I do"
hawks,3cajlw,Cartortus,-13,Mon Jul 6 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"So do I, have him on a fantasy league roster, he's a great player…doesn't mean he shouldn't be Boo'ed for chasing dollar signs and leaving a team that fucking trained him how to win."
hawks,3cajlw,Squabbles123,2,Mon Jul 6 17:44:36 2015 UTC,Why? Because a kid with talent wants to be as much as possible?
hawks,3cajlw,Cavetroll771,3,Mon Jul 6 20:50:04 2015 UTC,Panarin was already acquired so he wouldn't be in the equation...and i hope the other 2 can but who knows. I was banking on 10-12 goals from bickell this post season too
hawks,3cajlw,bud1316,2,Mon Jul 6 15:28:07 2015 UTC,That's a big if. It's not that easy to transition to the big boy's game.
hawks,3cajlw,Patrick_Kane,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"There wasn't an if in that sentence, Patty.  You're losing your edge in the off-season, son."
hawks,3cajlw,I_am_Rude,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:59:08 2015 UTC,I'm saying it is an if. No promises that they make the team or can put up numbers right away.
hawks,3cajlw,Patrick_Kane,9,Mon Jul 6 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"Toews and Hossa made Bickell a $4mil AAV player and they just helped Saad get $6mil AAV. Not saying Saad isn't a really good player, but that's the product of putting a LW that knows where to be and when, with two other forwards of 19/81's caliber. Anisimov may break his career high in points if he plays with Kane all season, and he already has chemistry with Dano so I'm feeling pretty positive about the trade. Best of luck Saader."
hawks,3cajlw,xnatehatex,2,Mon Jul 6 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"Getting 2 players that could be productive members of your team for the next five years is better than one player. Hawks did well, all things considered.  Still curious to see if Saad is an emerging superstar or just an above average winger that happens to play with 19/81"
hawks,3cajlw,jmajewski,-11,Tue Jul 7 07:30:12 2015 UTC,Trade Bickell?!!! My heart...
hawks,3cajlw,zumacroom,27,Mon Jul 6 16:19:10 2015 UTC,should be filled with joy when we dump his atrocious salary and useless skills for the hawks
hawks,3cajlw,bud1316,3,Mon Jul 6 16:25:47 2015 UTC,i agree.  he had one good playoffs. i like the guy but he's not worth his salary
hawks,3cajlw,courteous_coitus,-2,Mon Jul 6 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"I think he's a good role player and I like him, though I did curse his non-presence last season. He is just paid way too fucking much."
hawks,3cajlw,iprobablyneedahobby,3,Mon Jul 6 19:52:13 2015 UTC,he has no role the way the hawks are set up anymore
hawks,3cajlw,bud1316,2,Mon Jul 6 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"He would if he could effectively create traffic in front of the net and create screens but he doesn't, so yeah, I agree we should try to trade him."
hawks,3cajlw,iprobablyneedahobby,15,Mon Jul 6 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"Saw an update from Facebook for the BHL Trade Rumors page so this could mean nothing but, Stars offered Nichushkin and a 2nd round for 2016, that was declined. Panthers and Habs are still interested. Again this was from Faceboom NHL Trade Rumors with no confirmed sources. This has been all I have heard over the past 3 or 4 days though"
hawks,3cajlw,Cartortus,19,Mon Jul 6 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"That seems like a great deal from the Stars. I know Nichushkin has had his injury issues, but he is still a world class player. Hopefully that isn't true"
hawks,3cajlw,ClintEastwood41,7,Mon Jul 6 12:21:34 2015 UTC,"I agree a top 10 draft pick and a 2nd rounder, I think I would have pulled the trigger on that."
hawks,3cajlw,Cartortus,2,Mon Jul 6 14:05:24 2015 UTC,Yea he is a young winger with loads of talent. I was surprised they didn't take it. We maybe looking for a Dman instead of a winger?
hawks,3cajlw,PatMcRotch210,15,Mon Jul 6 12:33:21 2015 UTC,"Ran the zamboni for the stars last off season, watched a LOT of what they were doing, Nichushkin was out there everyday giving 100% to get better. Great hard working individual and we would have definitely been lucky to have him."
hawks,3cajlw,ClintEastwood41,3,Mon Jul 6 13:20:25 2015 UTC,That's awesome man
hawks,3cajlw,DoctorRavioli,7,Mon Jul 6 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's a rumour, let's not assume this was something Bowman actually declined."
hawks,3cajlw,Chorrbs,2,Mon Jul 6 14:44:14 2015 UTC,I don't believe Bowman wanted Sharp to stay in the conference let alone the division.
hawks,3cajlw,Argocap,9,Mon Jul 6 14:46:50 2015 UTC,"This line of thinking is very overplayed, managers should be looking to strengthen their own team regardless of who is on the other end."
hawks,3cajlw,Tornsys,10,Mon Jul 6 15:06:13 2015 UTC,Part of me has to doubt that Nichushkin was in play.  I personally would do Sharp for Nichushkin straight up for the salary dump and a good young NHL talent.  Perhaps Stan is still shopping for prospects they've been targeting.
hawks,3cajlw,badseedjr,11,Mon Jul 6 16:00:46 2015 UTC,A different rumor had Roussell in the trade.  Gross.
hawks,3cajlw,Tornsys,2,Mon Jul 6 16:44:14 2015 UTC,Might've thrown up a little in my mouth.  Too close to lunch still.
hawks,3cajlw,SilkyJohnson72,8,Mon Jul 6 20:22:51 2015 UTC,Really? I would love Nichushkin on the team. Not sure why StanBo didn't pull the trigger on that one (if it's true). He's another great young player we could have added to the roster
hawks,3cajlw,badseedjr,4,Mon Jul 6 14:21:05 2015 UTC,Same division.
hawks,3cajlw,Skweres88,11,Mon Jul 6 16:43:44 2015 UTC,The same division thing is worse for the stars than us though. Sharp and Nichushkin are similar and we would be getting the younger one. I doubt this trade was ever proposed.
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,9,Mon Jul 6 18:19:56 2015 UTC,"I would be pretty excited if he went to the Habs, then I could have Sharp jerseys from my two favorite teams."
hawks,3cajlw,orionus,9,Mon Jul 6 13:25:32 2015 UTC,I think the Habs is still our best bet. A 2nd and Tinordi would do it for me. Wish Bergevin would get his cap under control.
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,2,Mon Jul 6 15:44:18 2015 UTC,I think if it's the Habs we should start at a 1st and Fucale or Lehkonnen. We've done well with Finns and Fucale is a great hold/trade piece down the line.
hawks,3cajlw,jmajewski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"I like Fucale a lot as a back up, but his value seems to be in free fall lately. I thought about Lehkonen too, and I agree that he'd be a great pick, though I highly doubt that the Habs would surrender him and a first. I went with Tinordi though. We need the depth on D, and he's far along enough in his development to start with the big club, and as a 6'6 227 lb monster, his effect would be very noticeable. His price is also cheap right now because the Habs prefer Beaulieu to him, and dont have the roster space for both."
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:29:03 2015 UTC,I don't think they want to part with Tinordi. They seem to see him as a possible long term partner with Subban.
hawks,3cajlw,TheHydroImpulse,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:32:38 2015 UTC,"That hf analysis of him is out of date from before they acquired Petry and Beaulieu is ahead of him on the depth chart. They won't give him away for nothing, but he has been shipped before"
hawks,3cajlw,Cartortus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:19:06 2015 UTC,Beaulieu has taken that position now.
hawks,3cajlw,BlueLineMenace,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:30:23 2015 UTC,Yea it would depend on for who though
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:32:53 2015 UTC,Ummm....yes?
hawks,3cajlw,Tornsys,13,Mon Jul 6 12:37:12 2015 UTC,Trading Saad actually gave us a lot of flexibility. We can ice a team that's better than last years while being nearly 3m under the cap if we  trade Bickell and Versteeg.
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,4,Mon Jul 6 15:41:24 2015 UTC,I've also had this thought.  Was in Chicago for a Cubs game yesterday (Iowa boy) and had to pass over some conversation I overheard about it from a couple meatheats and it was clear that they didn't give a fuck about who we got in return.
hawks,3cajlw,joel_of_the_jungle,11,Mon Jul 6 16:05:31 2015 UTC,We can run this roster and still be 2.8m under the cap. That is a crazy nice roster.
hawks,3cajlw,rblumenfeld76,3,Mon Jul 6 17:00:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add another D-man to that rpster, but otherwise, it looks pretty great."
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,2,Mon Jul 6 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"No, no, no, no, no.  The Russians are playing together.  I don't care."
hawks,3cajlw,rblumenfeld76,5,Mon Jul 6 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"I'd like that, but Panarin and Tikonov both shoot right. Unless you want Anisimov playing right wing, it's not going to happen :("
hawks,3cajlw,cmac1988,2,Mon Jul 6 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"I don't care!  All Russian, all the time.  We can call it the Yeltsin line."
hawks,3cajlw,Tornsys,3,Mon Jul 6 19:27:48 2015 UTC,Definitely prefer the Party line better.
hawks,3cajlw,bobbo_5,2,Tue Jul 7 00:20:33 2015 UTC,"I like your style good sir, well played.  And yeah.  Comparing to previous teams (last year after trade deadline being the exception), the rest of the league might just lose their shit considering how much everyone is playing up the Hawks taking a big step back."
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:21:51 2015 UTC,Oduya > Johns and yes
hawks,3cajlw,ItsMEMusic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, but this is based on a pessimistic scenario. I'm also starting to worry about the sheer amount of talent that is log-jammed between rockford and the hawks."
hawks,3cajlw,Phridgey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:38:59 2015 UTC,As in lack of NHL experience and development?
hawks,3cajlw,DoctorRavioli,2,Tue Jul 7 22:56:40 2015 UTC,As in potential to be lost because they're being wasted in the AHL
hawks,3cajlw,Godfarber,10,Tue Jul 7 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"The rumours seem to suggest that the Habs, Islanders, and Panthers are the teams talking to the Hawks about Sharp.   The problem is that the Habs have cap issues themselves, so I'd be kind of surprised if he went to Montreal."
hawks,3cajlw,mmmmbeer,9,Mon Jul 6 14:42:37 2015 UTC,"Tallon said we had no interest in Sharp. Not sure if that's true or not, though. I think we could use him, and we have the cap space"
hawks,3cajlw,Godfarber,-5,Mon Jul 6 15:53:09 2015 UTC,Except the Hawks don't have the cap space. They're currently over the cap and that's with open roster spots left to fill and Stan still wanting to re-sign Kruger and Oduya.
hawks,3cajlw,NothingSacred,10,Mon Jul 6 16:39:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm a Panthers fan. Probably should've made that more clear."
hawks,3cajlw,Cartortus,4,Mon Jul 6 17:26:58 2015 UTC,Pretty sure OP is a Panthers fan.
hawks,3cajlw,iprobablyneedahobby,2,Mon Jul 6 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Panthers is the best bet, decent team, Cap space, young team, I'd be okay seeing him with the Panthers"
hawks,3cajlw,chocolate_chip_kelly,7,Mon Jul 6 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"I realize that lots of people would disagree but I would like to see us try to get a 1st and 2nd for him or something, rather than taking on some cap for a lesser player. Ideally we could clear some space and resign him though but such is life"
hawks,3cajlw,iprobablyneedahobby,2,Mon Jul 6 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"He's probably one of our most defensively sound forwards, and we can lock him in for between 2.5-3 million. That's a steal, considering we'd keep that 4th line that was destroying top lines in the playoffs together now."
hawks,3cajlw,courteous_coitus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:14:28 2015 UTC,That'd be awesome if we could resign him
hawks,3cajlw,iprobablyneedahobby,3,Mon Jul 6 18:27:09 2015 UTC,no way we'd get 1st and 2nd.  2nd and 3rd maybe
hawks,3cajlw,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,2,Mon Jul 6 18:23:45 2015 UTC,I know they couldnt get a lot after his last season but he is an awesome player and I like him on the team. I just hate the idea of basically giving him away
hawks,3cajlw,alove189,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:25:22 2015 UTC,Well we might not have any other choice so get used to the sound of it
hawks,3cajlw,LA_Galaxy741,3,Tue Jul 7 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"I think its unlikely Sharp stays here. If Stan thought we could keep a player making 6 Million (5.9) on the roster, Saad would still be here, right?"
hawks,3cajlw,bud1316,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:17:13 2015 UTC,I heard he's either going to Florida or the Habs
hawks,3c9jca,king_of_pancakes,21,Mon Jul 6 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"You guys are seriously going to love having Dano. He's such an exciting, young player with boatloads of potential. I'm glad he ended up with you guys, because I will feel no guilt rooting for him and the Hawks in the West. I think I'm even going to get a Dano Hawks shirt once he picks a number."
hawks,3c9jca,jpsquill,8,Mon Jul 6 14:17:41 2015 UTC,Yeah out of everything in that trade he's what excites me the most.  He's so good and his style matches up perfectly with a major weakness for the Hawks in grinding in front of the net.  It's like if you give stitched Teuvo's hands onto Andrew Shaw.
hawks,3c9jca,brianskuhar,5,Mon Jul 6 14:42:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this and I sincerely promise you that you guys will love Saad. He's incredibly gifted with still room to grow and he will hopefully be the anchor of a great decade of hockey for you guys. And like you, the Blue Jackets have now become my team in the East and I'll likely be buying a Saad CBJ shirt. I'll even hopefully catch a few games since my girlfriend is going to school in Columbus in the fall and her new apartment is walking distance from the arena."
hawks,3c9jca,RunningJokes,3,Mon Jul 6 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"I was going to ask you guys how he plays best. I will be honest, I am bitter about losing Saad. I have to keep reminding myself how excited I was when you guys made the playoffs, and how hard I rooted for you guys. If I had to pick teams to take Saad, you guys would have been at the top of my list, but I didn't want to lose him at all. You guys have an incredible player in Saad, and I would not be surprised if he ends up as your franchise player. Everytime there is a huge, clutch play, he will be on the ice. He is so young, but plays like a veteran.   I am pretty excited see how Dano plays with us, and what he contributes, entertaining the idea that maybe with our camp and supporting cast, he could be as good as Saad. Just so glad you guys are in the East"
hawks,3c9jca,redbluegreenyellow,3,Mon Jul 6 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"If Saad HAD to go, I'm really glad he went to you guys. It's basically impossible to hate your team with Foligno and Bobrovsky and the hug and the cannon and your goal song and Johansen.   The only time I root against you is when we play each other, which makes me glad we only play twice a season!"
hawks,3c9jca,Coop3,3,Mon Jul 6 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"I love how there's a mutual love for the Hawks and jackets.  I feel the same, glad Saad went there, than another team."
hawks,3c9jca,Pepsuber188,20,Mon Jul 6 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"We really need more guys who get the rebound goals and hang around the net the way that he does. With how many shots this team takes, he is going to have a lot of opportunities to put those away and that should be where he thrives"
hawks,3c9jca,QEDomelets,6,Mon Jul 6 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"He could become what Bickell looked like might, except with much, much faster hands and some incredible puck handling."
hawks,3c9jca,northernpace,7,Mon Jul 6 14:15:38 2015 UTC,He seems to handle an unstable puck very confidently. That hand-eye coordination will score him many rebound goals with the Hawks.
hawks,3c9jca,KingPikablu,3,Mon Jul 6 07:04:45 2015 UTC,Every goal except one of those was scored from below the hash marks! Exciting!
hawks,3c9jca,jangerhofer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:31:26 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for Dano purely for this, we really needed someone to slap rebounds into the net."
hawks,3c9jca,jerry200890,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"Imagine the potential on a line with Shaw.  I know Panarin is likely to play on the other wing with Anisimov, but I could see a Dano-Anisimov-Shaw line being a very effective at grinding down low."
hawks,3c9jca,HybridSamurai,-2,Mon Jul 6 20:35:08 2015 UTC,"Hossa, Toews, Shaw, Saad, Kruger, Smith etc.  They had at least one guy like that on just about every line the last couple years."
hawks,3c9jca,CAKEDONTLIE,40,Mon Jul 6 17:54:33 2015 UTC,Good we've needed a one leg up fist pump celly guy ever since Buff left.
hawks,3c9jca,isthisit-,25,Mon Jul 6 04:43:08 2015 UTC,The real reason for the trade.
hawks,3c9jca,jazzcigarettes,9,Mon Jul 6 14:35:04 2015 UTC,Kid's so good he crossed over Micha(e)l Jordan.
hawks,3c9jca,SamPayton,9,Mon Jul 6 04:40:51 2015 UTC,Those highlights with him and anisimov :)
hawks,3c9jca,badseedjr,2,Mon Jul 6 15:52:17 2015 UTC,I know! Great agility for such a big dude.
hawks,3c9jca,Coop3,2,Mon Jul 6 17:15:56 2015 UTC,Yea they look like they have good chemistry
hawks,3c9jca,coinblock,6,Mon Jul 6 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"Kid has a nose for the net.  Not a bad lineup on those first 4 goals... Lundqvist x 2, Price, and Schneider.  Pretty exciting."
hawks,3c9jca,ClintEastwood41,3,Mon Jul 6 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"I was stoked he managed to get lift on such quick, reactionary shots on a bouncing puck. That's exciting."
hawks,3c9jca,aspwriter85,10,Mon Jul 6 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"So, can we agree on calling him Marko dangle?"
hawks,3c9jca,ChristopherT,5,Mon Jul 6 11:06:59 2015 UTC,I fully support this.
hawks,3c9jca,docblue,3,Mon Jul 6 14:21:10 2015 UTC,Hopefully that ACL tear at the world championships doesn't hold him back too much.
hawks,3c9jca,pchin14,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:58:13 2015 UTC,Hadn't even heard about that. I imagine our management would have looked at that though.
hawks,3c9jca,Bambam005,5,Mon Jul 6 17:21:04 2015 UTC,I wish Bowman would tack on an extension for him right now incase his value gets toooo high for us.  Same thing with Teuvo
hawks,3c9jca,Bambam005,3,Mon Jul 6 14:13:28 2015 UTC,wowza! That's fancy! Thank you for sharing.
hawks,3c9jca,Nikola_Mirotic,5,Mon Jul 6 04:23:57 2015 UTC,"Right? I was surprised. I'd heard good things, but I am so impressed with him. He plays almost like Shaw, getting into the dirty areas, but has a crazy quick shot and handles the puck really well. He fits out style of play so well!"

The thing that bothers me about it is that the people that talk about him that way about him on either reddit or hfboards, usually don't watch the Hawks play so they don't know what he's all about or people just don't what they are talking about (Like saying he plays on the same line as Kane)"
hawks,3c94a7,Captain_019,30,Mon Jul 6 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wonder of these people looked at anything other than stats and actually watched him play.  We call him Captain Clutch for a reason, multiple last second goals to tie/win games? check. 2 goals to take a home crowd out of an away game 7? check. opening goal at the gold medal Olympic game? check, both 2010 and 2014. Not a coincidence people."
hawks,3c94a7,yorozuyajin-chan,23,Mon Jul 6 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"He really has scored so many clutch goals...the 2 goals in game 5 against Anaheim to take it to OT, the short handed goal to tie with a couple minutes left in game 7 against Vancouver, the first goal in game 6 against Boston (not to mention the primary assist to Bickell for the game tying goal in Game 6) He's a clutch dude and an excellent 2 way player, offense included."

In retrospect, it was one of the more amazing accomplishments of this Blackhawks core, the least talented team of the Q era, only getting into the playoffs due to a Wild win on the last day of the season, falling behind 0-3 against the President's Trophy winners and a team that was chomping at the bit to destroy us, coming back to tie the series and take Game 7 into OT in a hostile environment.  Who knows how the rest of those playoffs would have gone if Sharpie could have found the empty net early in OT?"

I don't care what you rate him, I couldn't imagine a better captain. You can play dirty and he isn't shaken. You can run him into the glass and he stays focused on the game. Toews is like a laser-guided missile with the supreme goal of winning.  Look at whatever stats you want. Toews is the embodiment of fair competition, the pinnacle of the phrase team player, and he is the definition of captain.  He doesn't need to smack talk, he doesn't need to play dirty, and he doesn't get involved in off-the-ice antics. He's the perfect role model for new talent, and if you think he wouldn't succeed on another team you are dead wrong.  How do you overrate someone that plays the game like this? He's basically the best parts of hockey without all the bullshit. He elevates everyone on his team, and keeps them focused on the real goal."

hawks,3c94a7,Pripiit,7,Mon Jul 6 01:44:43 2015 UTC,If we had lost to Tampa or Anaheim I dont think Toews wouldve even been brought up in the thread. If Tampa won the cup guess people would be calling Stamkos overrated or something. Its just that some people are tired of seeing us win every couple years and Toews just happens to be our captain so he gets a lot of flak. I know I loved bashing every player on the Kings after 2014...
hawks,3c94a7,HTWC,12,Mon Jul 6 11:11:16 2015 UTC,"How can anyone be called overrated more than Crosby? The exchange he had with Toews at the outdoor game just a couple of weeks after the Olympics sums him up perfectly: after Sid flopped to try and draw a penalty like a damned soccer player, Toews yells at him to ""Stay on your damned feet!"" Sid looks at him blankly for several seconds as those rusty wheels slowly start to turn in his head and he finally manages to stammer out a thin, ""guh...get over it!"", admitting that despite all that speed and skill he's also a dirty fraud, and needs to buffer his game with gross theatrics like a damned 4th liner. Fuck Sid the Kid. Toews is my captain and I will place him #1 for reasons I need not get into here, but I'm not being irrationally biased against Sid, since I take no offense to suggestions that Ovie is the best in the game, even if I have reasons to prefer the play of the captain."

Anyone who actually watches him play knows the offensive ability he has and how he could easily be a ppg guy if he wanted to.  He's smarter than that and we need him for other stuff though.  Besides, if he was so overrated, he wouldn't have commanded $12 mil on the open market this year and we wouldn't have to be paying him $10.5 mil."

I was curious how people thought he was overrated, but then when you think about it, they don't watch him play as much as we do. They compare him to other centers, other players, look at his stats. By those metrics, he is overrated. What justifies all the praise is him showing up every time he is needed. When you watch the Daniel Carcillo Players tribune and see it was Johnny Toews who helped him along. Its the way he brought his team with him to take the conference title. He inspires his team, makes them better, takes responsibility when we fail and is humble when he carries us.   Jonathan Toews is one of, if not the best players in the NHL, and 90% of what he does is immeasurable. Few will see that because they only watch him when he plays."

hawks,3c025h,Kglee54,24,Fri Jul 3 16:44:33 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Easily could've gotten 1-1.5 AAV on the islanders or a similar team.
hawks,3c025h,DrHampants,7,Fri Jul 3 17:11:14 2015 UTC,He could have gotten 1.5 easily on a team like BUF or BOS.

hawks,3c025h,DrHampants,-15,Fri Jul 3 15:59:08 2015 UTC,I thought that too right up to the point they traded Saad. Bowman must really be getting nothing in return for those guys.

I might not have a couple days ago, but the more I read and the more I look at it, I think we just may be a deeper team, albeit with a less dominant single line. Panarin Anisimov and Kane is a very exciting possibility. Desi/Kruger and Shaw remains one of the best 4th lines in the NHL in my very biased opinion.   Very exciting times have come from a very dark period for me. 96 days till we get to see it unfold."

hawks,3c025h,JosePajamas,12,Sat Jul 4 02:42:37 2015 UTC,I agree but only if we can resign oduya or get another d-man that can play big minutes as the 4th man in the playoffs
hawks,3c025h,popo1324,9,Fri Jul 3 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think we really need that. We have every reason to believe with 82 games under their belts that two of Johns/TVR/Pokka/Rundblad can do what Oduya did this year. Oduya was still the weakest of our 4D this year, and I think it's a fillable hole. I'd still like him back, but we'll see."
hawks,3c025h,orionus,9,Fri Jul 3 19:06:01 2015 UTC,Weakest of our top 4 is saying almost nothing though.  Any of the other 3 are #1 defensemen on almost any other team.
hawks,3c025h,thenuge26,2,Sat Jul 4 01:35:03 2015 UTC,Offensively I think we've improved.   D is still the question.   We have 3 guys where we know what we have... pretty confident we know what we have in TVR at either the fourth or fifth.   Sixth is the question mark.

hawks,3c025h,yorozuyajin-chan,12,Fri Jul 3 15:52:18 2015 UTC,This guy was so good for us in the playoffs. Great signing.
hawks,3c025h,SilkyJohnson72,9,Fri Jul 3 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"Great news. I can't say I was terribly impressed with him in San Jose (I follow the Sharks a bit because my friends do), but he played super solid for us, particularly in the playoffs."
hawks,3c025h,Disgustoid,7,Fri Jul 3 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"He's not the guy that will go out and win multiple games for a team, but he plays consistent and makes few mistakes. Perfect guy for the bottom 2 lines."
hawks,3c025h,ChaplnGrillSgt,8,Fri Jul 3 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"Love the signing, Desjardins played well throughout the playoffs and at this price is a steal."
hawks,3c025h,cubshound,8,Fri Jul 3 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"I loved that 4th line in the playoffs, and love that he's staying with us!    ""Took far less to stay,” Desjardins' agent, Todd Reynolds, told reporter Mark Lazerus. ""Loves it there.""  Goddamn right he loves it there.  And we love us some Dejardins.

hawks,3c025h,Greatpileofleaves,24,Fri Jul 3 19:01:31 2015 UTC,So our forward lines look like this now  Sharp-Toews-Hossa  Panarin-Taco-Kane  Bickell-Anisimov-Versteeg  Desi-(TBA)-Shaw  We have a good amount of defensive forwards and an aging first line though :(
hawks,3c025h,azadle,34,Fri Jul 3 15:30:12 2015 UTC,And an aging first line.    Well you don't have Dano in the line up. And sharp will probably be gone. I see Dano on the first line in his place.
hawks,3c025h,PhilDunphy_,38,Fri Jul 3 15:36:41 2015 UTC,And I wouldnt say aging...19 and 88 still have years of production out of them and 81 still plays like he is 25.

hawks,3c025h,foofighters92,16,Sat Jul 4 00:51:22 2015 UTC,Dano should start in third line. He's played like half a season in NHL. Luckily Q can rotate lines so we'll see who'll fit with Toews and Hossa
hawks,3c025h,HaveYouSeenMyTaco,4,Fri Jul 3 15:53:32 2015 UTC,I know but it's my prediction that Dano ends up fitting in best with them.
hawks,3c025h,PhilDunphy_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:55:08 2015 UTC,Any reason why you think so?
hawks,3c025h,Lord__Business,6,Fri Jul 3 16:00:11 2015 UTC,Young kid with a lot of upside. But I thought he had played long we than 35 games. That's my bad. So maybe third line like was previously said.
hawks,3c025h,PhilDunphy_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:03:39 2015 UTC,Stanbo made mention of his 2 way play as something to look forward to.  That ..might.. give him a shot at filling a spot on line 1
hawks,3c025h,rideh,4,Sat Jul 4 13:40:37 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, most of Saad's rookie year was spent on the first line with Toews and Hossa, and he was a Calder finalist.  If the kid can play reliable D, I think Q would give him a shot there."
hawks,3c025h,Blckhawks8819,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"Saad also got those minutes due to injury. Sharp and Carcillo were both out, which took away most of our LW depth. His only competition was Bickell, Stalberg, Bollig, and Morin (and this was 12-13 before Bicks had his big playoff run)  I think in an ideal world, Dano does not play his first full season with top 6 minutes"
hawks,3c025h,loscornballs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:01:17 2015 UTC,Q rarely stays with one lineup combo for too long anyway. He prefers to mix and match according to the ebbs and flows of the season.
hawks,3c025h,dawidowmaka,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:12:51 2015 UTC,"Luckily Q can rotate lines so we'll see who'll fit with Toews and Hossa     Yeah, I'm aware of that"
hawks,3c025h,HaveYouSeenMyTaco,5,Sat Jul 4 07:08:10 2015 UTC,"Dano's played 35 nhl games. I dont think he'll play first line.   And id put versteeg 2nd, to get:  Sharp-toews-hossa  Kane-taco-versteeg  Panarin-anisimov-tikhinov  Desi-tbd-shaw  And dano in there somewhere at some point  Russian connection ftw"
hawks,3c025h,no_YOURE_sexy,4,Fri Jul 3 15:56:49 2015 UTC,Yeah but Sharp will most likely be gone. So who do we put in the first line in you opinion?
hawks,3c025h,PhilDunphy_,3,Fri Jul 3 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"Kane or versteeg or panarin. Id take panarin up there being older and at least with khl experience over dano. Also on the fourth line, what about shaw centering desi and haggerty?"
hawks,3c025h,no_YOURE_sexy,3,Fri Jul 3 16:38:45 2015 UTC,KAne and Hossa both play RW so if you put Kane up there you move hossa down. And you're still left with a spot open on the first line.
hawks,3c025h,buddhabash,2,Fri Jul 3 16:54:09 2015 UTC,I fully expect us to re-sign Kruger so I think he will be on the 3rd or 4th line.
hawks,3c025h,PhilDunphy_,2,Fri Jul 3 16:46:09 2015 UTC,I think shaw is wasted in the middle. He's much more effective getting in deep and winning the luck on the boards. I'd take Dano over Haggerty too. Panerin would be awesome on the first line with toews n lord Hossa but English could be a problem
hawks,3c025h,betty_swollocks9,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:13:22 2015 UTC,Bickell Toews Hossa  Kane Tuevo Panarin  Tikhinov/McNeil? Anisimov Dano  Desi Krueger Shaw  I don't see anyone taking Bickell. Would this line up even be possible with the cap?
hawks,3c025h,ChristopherT,4,Fri Jul 3 18:07:04 2015 UTC,God I hope not. I want Bickell traded without a doubt.
hawks,3c025h,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:33:08 2015 UTC,I don't know that you can consider Toews as aging...

hawks,3c025h,ItsMEMusic,3,Sat Jul 4 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"Bickell, and Versteeg are still probably on their way out, and Sharp will likely still be traded as we're really thin on defense and right at the cap. Kruger will be re-signed. I'd think our lines would be:  Dano-Toews-Hossa  Panarin -Anisimov-Kane  Tikhonov - Teuvo - Hartman/Baun  Desi - Kruger - Shaw"
hawks,3c025h,DrHampants,3,Fri Jul 3 15:47:25 2015 UTC,There is still a possibility that Panarin doesn't pan out in the NHL level though same with Tikhonov
hawks,3c025h,azadle,8,Fri Jul 3 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"Then it is next man up, Hartman, Danult, Baun, Nordstrom, Morin, Kerro, McNeil. The hawks are not hurting for cheap replacements and some of these guys are NHL ready (at least on the 4th line)."

At one time, Saad was just one of the next guys up from Rockford.  It will be tougher this upconing year, no doubt - but the long term future is bright. I mean, just look at our backup goalie"
hawks,3c025h,ShrewyLouie,2,Fri Jul 3 18:09:03 2015 UTC,Don't forget Dano and Tikhonov. Panarin and Tikhonov should play together and Dano will be on the first line once we trade sharp. Bickell will go and Versteeg should go at some point
hawks,3c025h,Cartortus,7,Fri Jul 3 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point in trading Versteeg, he has a pretty small cap hit 2.2 million and trading him would spread our winger depth too thin IMO, only if Sharpie is traded first though."
hawks,3c025h,azadle,3,Fri Jul 3 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"Because we're still right at the cap and going into the season with only 200k in space is really problematic. Besides, we can get more or less the same production for much cheaper."
hawks,3c025h,DrHampants,7,Fri Jul 3 15:49:08 2015 UTC,He's not worth 2.2 million.
hawks,3c025h,Mentalseppuku,2,Fri Jul 3 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"We also have some decent kids on Rockford that are looking to break into the NHL next season.  I could see Bicks, Sharp and Steeger gone because of that.  Cap space is needed, and StanBo hates having no wiggle room in case their is a need come trade deadline."

hawks,3c025h,Cartortus,0,Fri Jul 3 15:43:15 2015 UTC,Trading Versteeg weakens our forward depth but trading Sharp doesn't?
hawks,3c025h,Aperture-Employee,2,Fri Jul 3 15:44:54 2015 UTC,"Trading them both, yes we lose depth. Sharpie will be on the block all off season and probably will go. Versteeg is 50/50 trading either one weakens us"

hawks,3c0y8t,LouChainz88,31,Fri Jul 3 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's fine, but he literally said he'd take a discount because money wasn't important, the team was."
hawks,3c0y8t,redbluegreenyellow,45,Fri Jul 3 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"He's 22 and had just won a Stanley Cup.  Let's not crucify this guy...excuse me...this kid for saying the wrong thing in the heat of the moment.    It's a business, afterall.  And I'll never fault a guy for wanting to get paid when he has the chance.    Are you willing to take a paycut at work so your company could have more disposable income to hire more/better employees? Why should he do the same?"
hawks,3c0y8t,lockman21,18,Fri Jul 3 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"Of course he has every right to take the money - I absolutely don't begrudge him! Just don't pretend that you're going to take a discount if you're really not. It's just one of my pet peeves, not standing by your word. I still wish him the best."
hawks,3c0y8t,redbluegreenyellow,8,Fri Jul 3 20:26:42 2015 UTC,He didn't necessarily pretend.  He gave a typical political answer when asked if he'd take a discount and reporters took that phrase and ran with it to suit their own narrative.

hawks,3c0y8t,jerry200890,12,Fri Jul 3 20:23:04 2015 UTC,I'd decline 6 for 5 to stay with the team I won two. cups with already. Not like he's declining 6 for nothing

hawks,3c0y8t,jerry200890,9,Fri Jul 3 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"A bigger role? How much bigger a role than on the 1st or 2nd line, playing 17 minutes a night for the Stanley Cup champions is he going to get?   I have no issues with what he did and I wish him the best but I don't see his role being any greater there than it was here."
hawks,3c0y8t,haf12,7,Sat Jul 4 05:56:36 2015 UTC,He's not behind a Kane or a Toews or a Hossa on that team. It's going to be basically him along with Johansen leading the way there. He'll be more of a main cog right now there then he would've if he stayed in Chicago. Some players want that.
hawks,3c0y8t,jerry200890,4,Sat Jul 4 06:02:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Here he was a bright, up and coming youth. There he may be one of the faces of the franchise in a couple years."
hawks,3c0y8t,mongoos3,2,Sat Jul 4 06:26:01 2015 UTC,I'd say he is right now along with Johansen and I guess Foligno (Columbus fans are gonna be in for a rude awakening with him though when he regresses).
hawks,3c0y8t,diesel321,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:41:49 2015 UTC,It's not like Columbus won't be a contender. They would've been a threat in the East last year had they not have been so plauged with injuries. And now they're better with Saad.
hawks,3c0y8t,MidgetLovingMaxx,2,Fri Jul 3 23:15:48 2015 UTC,He never said he would take a discount. He said it had crossed his mind. There is no commitment to less money in that statement.
hawks,3c0y8t,danburke,6,Sat Jul 4 20:11:09 2015 UTC,You'd think endorsement deals from playing in Chicago versus Columbus would have more than offset that $1m difference...
hawks,3c0y8t,Cartortus,5,Sat Jul 4 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"If they really were only off terms by $1m and Bowman came out and said he never felt they were anywhere near a deal, Saad's agent hosed him and hosed him good.  17% isn't that big of a variance to where Bowman should have thought there was no reasonable chance at a deal unless Saads agent was playing overly aggressive trying to cash in."
hawks,3c0y8t,vrahney,4,Fri Jul 3 20:40:48 2015 UTC,"$6 million is where Columbus and Saad settled.  I doubt the negotiations went:  CBJ: We'll give you 6/6  Saad: Deal!  I'm sure they started at 6.5 and worked down when there weren't any offer sheets given.  The offer sheets were Saad's biggest ally, and without them they didn't have any leverage."
hawks,3c0y8t,Cartortus,3,Fri Jul 3 22:50:24 2015 UTC,"It might not have been the money but the length of the contract? That was in the news I believe, they could have offered 5 AAV but for 2 or 3 years? I'd be surprised if that was the reason why he left."
hawks,3c0y8t,Patrick_Kane,2,Sun Jul 5 17:04:44 2015 UTC,It was for 5 years
hawks,3c0y8t,burner46,2,Sun Jul 5 18:06:14 2015 UTC,Well now I'm sad
hawks,3c0y8t,royalhawk345,5,Sun Jul 5 18:09:01 2015 UTC,What I don't understand is why his agent was asking for $6.5 from us when he took $6 from Columbus. If we were willing to go to 5 there is likely some middle ground between 5 and 6 that we could have made work.   Whatever it's done.
hawks,3c0y8t,letmeaddnumbers,4,Sat Jul 4 00:44:08 2015 UTC,I read that Stan was only trying to get him to sign for 2 years and Saad wanted a longer term deal.
hawks,3c0y8t,ItsNot1972,6,Sat Jul 4 03:00:29 2015 UTC,"But it wouldn't have been a ""we don't want to commit"" two years, it would have been a ""we'll actually have cap space and you'll get a raise then"" two years."
hawks,3c0y8t,remz07twos,3,Sat Jul 4 08:21:41 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the reason.  However, injury seems to always be an issue when it comes to contract talks and players like the longer contract for protection."

hawks,3c0u57,GuyOnTheLake,8,Fri Jul 3 19:05:02 2015 UTC,Definitely agree. I was really wondering why StanBo did the trade at first but now I understand
hawks,3c0u57,Captain_019,6,Fri Jul 3 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like he either thinks he's not that good, or he's an idiot.  6 years of his prime at only 6 million when he could conceivably develop into a Kane or Toews sounds shortsighted.  Whatever, he got his money now like he wanted."
hawks,3c0u57,Televisions_Frank,6,Fri Jul 3 20:40:30 2015 UTC,You can't pay a player more than 6 million just because he MIGHT turn into a Toews or Kane.
hawks,3c0u57,Bambam005,2,Sat Jul 4 05:22:12 2015 UTC,"And to be fair, prime for a forward is 27-30."
hawks,3c0u57,haf12,11,Sat Jul 4 06:31:27 2015 UTC,"How much more? 6 million per is a lot for a player that, though he's clearly really good and durable, hasn't put up the mega numbers you expect to draw that salary.  He hasn't put up over 23 goals in a season. Clearly goals aren't everything, but still, that's a lot of cheese for him."
hawks,3c0u57,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,3,Fri Jul 3 19:03:57 2015 UTC,Agree... The playoffs this year totally inflated his worth.  And his output for the Blackhawks may not be the output he has in Columbus in a totally different system.  I am happy for Saad he deserves what he can get.
hawks,3c0u57,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,2,Fri Jul 3 19:53:23 2015 UTC,"I think by the end of the deal he'll seem like a steal (based off just his salary, anyways. They did give up some good players to get him.) but just compare him to other 6 million dollar players.  And he wasn't unrestricted, so you can't say a bidding war inflated the amount.   The highest number I heard floated for him was $6.5 mill AAV so I don't think 6 is way less than he's worth.   It'll probably work out like the Toews/Kaner deals from the 'Hawks perspective. A lot up front, but as the deal goes on, hopefully the cap goes up and it becomes a deal."
hawks,3c0u57,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:21:56 2015 UTC,I should have said his performance inflated his value.  He was a monster in the playoffs and that performance increased his value.  I mis-stated that the first time.
hawks,3c0u57,CubsWin98,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:54:22 2015 UTC,I think you stated that pretty clearly in your first sentence.   I think he would've gotten paid regardless. 22 year old power forwards that play both ways well get that money....Though being one of the best players on a cup run never ever hurts.

hawks,3c0uqp,quaduce,13,Sat Jul 4 14:57:57 2015 UTC,If Sharp stays (I think the lines will be like this)  Sharp - Toews - Hossa  Panarin - Anisimov - Kane  Dano - TT - Tikhonov/Hartman/Baun?  Desi - Kruger - Shaw  If Sharp leaves  Dano - Toews - Hossa  Panarin - Anisimov - Kane  Hartman - Taco - Tikhonov  Desi - Kruger - Shaw  I feel like Bickell and Versteeg will be sure so I didn't put them in
hawks,3c0uqp,Captain_019,9,Fri Jul 3 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"If sharp goes I think Steeg will stay. But bickell HAS to go, that is most important"
hawks,3c0uqp,Captain_019,12,Fri Jul 3 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"If Bickell doesn't go, I will be pissed off"
hawks,3c0uqp,haf12,3,Fri Jul 3 21:11:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. He was worth 1mil in the playoffs for what he did. Not 4 freaking mil for a team as can strapped as we are. Hoping we can drop him and maybe get Oduya back to stabilize our D core.
hawks,3c0uqp,jacksonvstheworld,3,Sat Jul 4 06:35:16 2015 UTC,I love what Anisimov does to that second line. It was going to be way too one-dimensional with Taco out there.
hawks,3c0uqp,Go_Cubs_Go_13,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:08:10 2015 UTC,Is Panarin going to be in the NHL at the beginning if the year?
hawks,3c0uqp,Captain_019,16,Fri Jul 3 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"If he's not, he's going back to the KHL."
hawks,3c0uqp,rpgreenmachine4,10,Fri Jul 3 19:35:50 2015 UTC,"He has an odd contract/clause that if he does not make the Hawks opening day roster, he can go back to the KHL and I believe is former team and terminate his NHL contract. So it thought he will make the Hawks, he is damn talented and arguably took less money to sign with the Hawks."
hawks,3c0uqp,TrailGrazer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:54:07 2015 UTC,Sharp definitely goes. With all the talented young forwards we have it makes no sense to let Saad walk and pay Sharp.   Huge fan of Baun - can't wait to see him get more time next season. Wouldn't be surprised if Shaw moves up to the third line
hawks,3c0uqp,Cartortus,-1,Thu Jul 9 11:14:59 2015 UTC,If Sharp leaves  Dano - Toews - Hossa Morin/Baun - Turbo - Kane Tikhonov - Anisimov - Panarin  Desi - Kruger (hopefully) - Shaw  Sharp Stays  Sharp - Toews - Hossa Dano - Turbo - Kane Tikhonov - Anisimov - Panarin Desi - Kruger - Shaw   Defense  7-57 4-26  2-5  Schillings/Pokka/Johns - Schillings/Pokka/Johns

hawks,3bxw22,MooseHeadFeed,29,Fri Jul 3 01:41:50 2015 UTC,Mid 90s. Lots of teams had similar style jerseys.  Inline hockey was booming. The NHL was gaining huge popularity at the time. There was a push for a lot of third jerseys that were cartoonish for lack of a better description.

Koko had it for a long time .... Reebok agreement through '16.  Rumor has it Adidas is looking to take over licensing after that.  Edit:  just did some more digging.  NHL Street League jerseys manufactured by Nike mid to late 90's.  Few on eBay asking North of $350 ... That said ... I'll give you $20 and a bag of pucks for it :) It's actually a nice grab  ..

hawks,3bvy3p,saintpauli,10,Fri Jul 3 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"I have a strong feeling that Bowman won't move Sharp until someone agrees to take Bickell as well. Sharps contract isn't in the state of being an albatross and he's the quintessential experienced vet who ""knows how to win"". I think he's asking for what he believes Sharp alone can get, but other managers are wary of taking on Bicks contract as well, which has made them more reserved with what they're offering back. Either that, or Stan is really waiting off until the player market dries up to try to sell at the highest point he can."
hawks,3bvy3p,odd_orange,19,Thu Jul 2 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"The perception over on r/hockey* seems to be that 1) the Hawks are still desperate and 2) Sharp is in some kind of steep decline.   Since 1 isn't necessarily true after the Saad deal, I'm beginning to think the Hawks might be better off hanging on to Sharp until the deadline or next offseason. I'm sure some time in his usual role and back on the top line with Toews and Hossa will pump up his value again.    -- not that the opinions on r/hockey represent the view of NHL front offices."
hawks,3bvy3p,ChrisPummer,20,Thu Jul 2 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"I stopped going to /r/hockey because their perception of the team just annoys me.  I don't understand why people think Sharp is on some sort of steep decline or not worth his contract. He's not as young as he was (hockey players age, who knew?) but he was still in our top 5 in points during the playoffs. It's not like he got three cups by just existing in the background. Plus he was a huge influence on Toews and Kane's development and a big locker room presence. Put him back on the top line and the points will flow again.   Since we've got some breathing room now that we don't have Saad's salary to shoulder (god that still hurts to think about) so I wouldn't mind seeing him back there next season. I don't think we have another top 6 winger that could slot in there? Better to keep him around until we get the trade we're looking for."
hawks,3bvy3p,yorozuyajin-chan,8,Fri Jul 3 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"there was a blog that actually analyzed why sharps point production went down and its not because of lack of skill or speed: but because Q changed his role. he used to have a role similar to tht of kane, a finisher, the guy to fire that shot. but recently his role changed into a workhorse, the guy whose job it is to get the puck across the blue line. this frequently puts him out of position to have best shots.   sharpie still has everything, he was just used in a way that prevented him from scoring as much, but allowed the team to win the cup."
hawks,3bvy3p,HollowImage,5,Fri Jul 3 16:32:26 2015 UTC,"You missed the unpopular opinions thread then.  Basically everybody on the Blackhawks is overrated, and they only produce because they play alongside great players, who happen to be overrated as well."
hawks,3bvy3p,Jruff1984,4,Fri Jul 3 16:28:41 2015 UTC,Except we signed the rusky so we're still over cap I believe.
hawks,3bvy3p,Gobyinmypants,4,Thu Jul 2 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"Right now they are barely over. They should still be able to offload at least half of Bickell's contract, and as an administrative trick with the cap move some guys to Rockford to start the year.  They could also wait until the season to sign Kruger, when someone might be moved to LTIR or traded during training camp. That would involve gambling nobody signs him to an offer sheet, but it would postpone having to count him against the cap -- sort of like what Boston did with Torey Krug and Reilly Smith a couple years ago before moving Marc Savard to LTIR.  It would also mean beginning the year with a younger crew of defensemen.   So don't get me wrong, it wouldn't be comfortable playing around in the margins with the cap. But there's enough wiggle room to make it happen if that's where the Hawks think they get the best value from their assets.  If they do find a taker for Sharp at their price point and can add a defenseman to make the roster better overall? Do it. No real upgrade out there on the blue line but other salary can be cleared out? Ok, keep Sharp around.  I'm not dead set on any outcome, and I don't think the Hawks are. Nor do they have to be."
hawks,3bvy3p,ChrisPummer,5,Thu Jul 2 22:18:49 2015 UTC,maybe if we had his asking price we could compare it to other trades.
hawks,3bvy3p,Konker101,6,Thu Jul 2 20:07:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is, as more wingers fall through trades and free agency, Sharp's value will only increase. There are a lot of teams that want a top line winger, and not a lot of those players available. Someone is going to pounce eventually, which is why Bowman is being patient.  At least that's how I see it, which may be 100% wrong."
hawks,3bvy3p,DiggerNicks13,14,Fri Jul 3 01:41:59 2015 UTC,"I say keep him and ship out Bickell. Then roll out the young D guys next season, TVR, Johns, Rundblad and maybe Gusstofsen instead of trying to trade Sharp. But if we trade Bickell, we can try and keep Oduya or another D vet."

Sounds like he's giving them the benefit of waiting for a Sharp/Bickell move, so I guess it could happen.  I do think they have some pieces in place that make it possible for them to be stronger next year.  Guys like Dano and Panarin make for some potentially exciting 3rd and 4th line offense.  Just gotta worry about shoring up the d.  Getting Oduya back would go a long long way if it's even possible."
hawks,3c1il7,brianskuhar,8,Mon Jul 6 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"It may. He's been a part of the team for a couple years and getting that chemistry back doesn't always happen immediately. The counterpoint is that we also won the year he was a rookie.   The bad thing is that we lost a promising young player who's been pretty consistently awesome.   The good thing is that we replaced him with a couple new promising young players for something near the same cost it would have been to keep him.   I don't think it hurts our chances to repeat, but it stings a bit due to personal attachment. My expectations had him exceeding 70 points next season from playing a bigger role in the top 6. Sure I'm still sadd about Saad, but it helps that I've become more excited about the Russian Revolution. Can it be October yet?"

hawks,3bxmtd,dungpile,11,Fri Jul 3 00:17:39 2015 UTC,"A no trade clause basically gives the player the ability to veto any trade involving them if they don't agree. There are full and partial no trade clauses, the partial usually giving the player the ability to submit a list of teams they will/won't accept trades to. Players will have to agree to waive their clause to be traded if they have one.   No movement clauses are effectively the same, but also prevent being sent to the minors or loaned internationally to other hockey clubs.  As to why they would, some might be tired of their current team, coaching staff, etc. Some might be under personal pressures to move, some might just be willing to sacrifice for a club that gave them a lot.  In this situation, I would hope that both Sharp and Bickell would be understanding and grateful enough to accept trades. This organization has given them both plenty of money and multiple championships. They'll still be paid regardless of where they wind up. Nobody WANTS to leave a championship caliber team, but sometimes players will accept they aren't helping things and gracefully accept the move."

hawks,3bsm29,brbauer2,35,Wed Jul 1 20:47:47 2015 UTC,Yea all of these Russian acquisitions along with Dano have got me excited for next season.
hawks,3bsm29,lunatyck,11,Wed Jul 1 20:53:05 2015 UTC,Fun fact. Dano is from the same town as hossa apparently.
hawks,3bsm29,P33KAJ3W,12,Thu Jul 2 12:00:14 2015 UTC,Fun Fact. Hossa is our Lord and Saviour.
hawks,3bsm29,lunatyck,6,Thu Jul 2 14:37:43 2015 UTC,Blessed be his name
hawks,3bsm29,Siggy778,3,Thu Jul 2 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"I like the way they've been pairing the young guys with other players from their country.  You've got Hossa to mentor Dano and you've got Anisimov, Tikhonov and Panarin.  Tikhonov and Panarin played on the same KHL team."
hawks,3bsm29,lunatyck,3,Thu Jul 2 13:22:33 2015 UTC,Ya the mentor thing seems to be paying dividends. Much like TT being mentored by Kimmo. Plus I like Anisimov so I'm happy. Obviously I'd love to have keeped Saad but 'tis the business of the game
hawks,3bsm29,Siggy778,3,Thu Jul 2 13:30:09 2015 UTC,I loved hearing Bowman say that he'd been chasing Anisimov for years.  Hopefully he's everything they say he is.  And Dano will probably get the Tuevo treatment where he's on the 4th line until he gets comfortable.    We have so many young guys that will be competing next year.  It's like a new era.
hawks,3bsm29,lunatyck,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:33:38 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Panarin lives up to his hype
hawks,3bsm29,irock613,11,Thu Jul 2 13:37:33 2015 UTC,What's the latest on Sharp? Have we made enough room to keep him or he's still a for sure trade?

hawks,3bsm29,Siggy778,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:42:46 2015 UTC,I think we have a slow first half as the new and young guys get acclimated.  We'll be a stronger 2nd half team and finish 3rd just like this year.  I'm fine with that.
hawks,3bsm29,matter1317,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:20:36 2015 UTC,Wait we're keeping sharp?!
hawks,3bsm29,Chief_Doppleganger,2,Thu Jul 2 13:30:50 2015 UTC,"Nobody has officially said that we are keeping him but it could be looking more and more that way if we aren't going to get the type of return we want. Plus we've lost Saad while richards, and vermette weren't expected back and have signed with other teams now. I personally feel like we should try to keep him especially if we can dump Bicks or Steeg. I wouldn't want to lose 6 of our top 9"
hawks,3bsm29,matter1317,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:02:57 2015 UTC,Wait wait wait. We lost brad Richards? And vermy?
hawks,3bsm29,Chief_Doppleganger,4,Thu Jul 2 15:07:45 2015 UTC,Vermette signed back with Arizona and Richards is now in Detroit.
hawks,3bsm29,matter1317,-1,Thu Jul 2 15:11:28 2015 UTC,I can't even.
hawks,3bsm29,brbauer2,2,Thu Jul 2 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"Both were UFR. Vermette went back to the Coyotes, Richards to the Red Wings."
hawks,3bsm29,faceshitter,0,Thu Jul 2 15:11:40 2015 UTC,Sharp (or Bickell/Versteeg) still need to go. Hawks have 12 forwards and 4 defensemen and they're already at 71.08 million dollars.

hawks,3bsm29,PrisonedMuffin,21,Wed Jul 1 22:34:33 2015 UTC,I don't think you know how good Johansen and Foligno are. They both outscored Kane and Toews (though Kane would have had more had he not gotten injured). Those are damn good linemates.
hawks,3bsm29,MyNeckHurts,6,Thu Jul 2 01:08:09 2015 UTC,Toews also plays a completely different game. I'd love to see the Quality of competition and Zone starts of Johansen and Toews. Also keep in mind Foligno seems to be a product of Johansen.  Saad will do well with Johansen. But it won't be no Kane and Toews.
hawks,3bsm29,Squabbles123,2,Thu Jul 2 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Foligno is a fine hockey player, but I don't think he's going to repeat that scoring performance."
hawks,3bsm29,xMeski,0,Thu Jul 2 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"Johansen is going to be a force but I truly believe foligno is super overrated. Don't get me wrong - he's good, but he's not as good as people make him out to be imo. I think he's a benefitiary of a bit of a circlejerk off the start of the season and he rode the hype into a captaincy. Johansen is going to be awesome to watch though."
hawks,3bsm29,MutinyofClowns,17,Thu Jul 2 05:03:52 2015 UTC,"If had a gun, with two bullets, and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden and Saad's piece of shit agent, I would shoot the agent twice."

We have absolutely not use for him now that we acquired Anisimov, unless we played him as a 3rd line center which I believe Turbo is slated to take.

Then we'll have to let Oduya walk, get rid of Bickell and Versteeg without retaining any salary, and at this point we'd have a little less than 2 million left over which I don't think will be enough to sign Kruger.

If the agent threw out the 6.5 number, he had to have known that it would be rejected due to the cap and that Saad would either get offer sheeted for just as much or traded like he did.  If Saad told the agent he wanted 6.5, why wouldn't the agent say ""Yea I talked to them and they said they can't retain you for 6.5. If you want to stay it has to be x amount of dollars"""

hawks,3br251,puck342,88,Thu Jul 2 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"TL;DR  Saad wants to come back to win cups, says he'll take discount (said during cup hangover, yes)  Bowman says Saad is #1 priority  Both sides clearly want to work this out  Hawks have cap space troubles and everyone in the hockey world knows it  Saad (or someone representing him) asks for 6.5 mil  Hawks obviously can't absorb that cap hit at the moment, even for as good of a player as he is  Saad devastated when square peg can't fit round hole  Where is break in communication in all of this?  I have this feeling we will hear more about this story in the next few days. Just look at what's happened. Saad said (albeit in the honeymoon afterglow of a cup) that money isn't everything when championships are on the line and that he'd love to keep playing here. Bowman said (and I have no reason to doubt it even after the trade) that signing Saad was a major priority.   Now I never expect an athlete to take a home town discount, but Saad did express interest (again, cup drunk I know). It's a pretty bold move to say that to the fan base and then go back on it when he could have just said nothing (not blaming him just saying that he didn't have to throw the idea out there).   I'm just wondering who threw the 6.5 mil figure out there and what was said behind closed doors between Saad to Agent, Agent to Bowman, Bowman to Saad (is that even allowed?) because I'm sure you could get some pretty twisted words if the agent wanted to. After all a 4 million bridge contract vs a 6.5 million multi-year deal is not as harsh looking to a player as it might be to an agent. Especially when Saad knows he's in a good situation, sees what happened with Kane and Toews deals, and realizes the cap situation.  It seems that both Saad and the front office wanted to work out a deal and then suddenly, BAM! 6.5 million appears out of nowhere. I mean Saad is 22 and probably doesn't have a PHD in finance, but he had to have known that throwing 6.5 as his offer wouldn't fly with the cap space the Hawks have. I'm not saying he shouldn't get paid or that he should take a discount or anything, but it was really shocking to see that number appear when everything else seemed to the contrary."
hawks,3br251,ObscuredBy,29,Thu Jul 2 02:04:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was a number the Agent pulled, without consent from Saad."
hawks,3br251,kelus,17,Wed Jul 1 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"I've also heard that Bowman wanted to offer Saad a 2 year/$3.5 mill bridge contract with the promise that he would reward him after the contract was up.  If that's the case, I don't feel too sorry for Saad.  If he was willing to take a discount, there was his opportunity.  And I think everyone can agree, you cannot be frustrated with a guy for going after the money when it is there for the taking.  Side note: he could be talking about being frustrated to save face with our fan base after what he said post-Stanley Cup win.  This is my speculation and in no way am I a reliable source."
hawks,3br251,adamatik,5,Wed Jul 1 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"If he was taken advantage of by his agent, I feel bad, but if not I can't. A short term decent contract would have been a bridge to a better contract after older players hang up their skates. I know no one wants to think about it but Hossa is 36, its gonna come sooner than later and I was really hoping we could keep Saad until that point."
hawks,3br251,Skweres88,2,Wed Jul 1 16:01:18 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm not trying to drum up a conspiracy here, but you have to think that given a bridge deal of like 4/4.5 for 2 years, Saad would end up getting a big payday once Hossa came off the books. It's a weird situation for sure, and I agree with your sentiment of if the agent did it fuck him but if Saad did this then I don't feel too sorry."
hawks,3br251,ObscuredBy,2,Wed Jul 1 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"I like to think that wasn't Stanbos beat offer though, Id be surprised if they didn't offer him a 4.5 mil average at some point,"

hawks,3br251,amdrummer90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:15:05 2015 UTC,Professional hockey is a dangerous sport. His performance could decline due to concussions or other injuries. I can assure you that Bowman would drop him asap and all he would have was a measly bridge offer. I don't see that as advantageous to him.  There is also the professional ego to consider. Would you accept a deal far lower than your worth and far less than your coworkers who were not performing to you level?
hawks,3br251,ClutchBender,5,Wed Jul 1 20:58:25 2015 UTC,"And I think everyone can agree, you cannot be frustrated with a guy for going after the money when it is there for the taking."
hawks,3br251,adamatik,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"I still feel betrayed, but I don't know by who"
hawks,3br251,vampyweeks,8,Wed Jul 1 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Saad never said he would take a hometown discount. He just said the thought had crossed his mind. Really non-committal imo."
hawks,3br251,mongoos3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. The point still stands though that if he did want to remain on the team, asking for 6.5 mil per year at this point in time was a sure fire way to most likely not be on the team. It's unfortunate for everyone: fans, organization, and apparently Saad. It looks like they were willing to shell out 4.5 at least since that's what they signed Anisimov for, although that could be due to him being a center"
hawks,3br251,ObscuredBy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:36:28 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. His statement that the money will come and go and championships are more important sounds pretty hollow after the negotiation stalls and high asking price.  Shame it couldn't get done with the Hawks, but there's a chance he makes it back after a few years in CBJ. I'll be cheering next year when he takes his first step back on the UC ice, regardless."
hawks,3br251,mongoos3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:54:59 2015 UTC,"There's been a bit of mudslinging, but I listened to that conference call and he said that he was a ""bit shocked"" at the trade. Of course it could be a PR act but I don't think so--I think there was miscommunication somewhere with his agent. Maybe a price was communicated, Saad says ok, leaves it all to the agent, agent tries to deal with StanBo but they're hard against the cap so StanBo rightfully thinks that it's better to get some returns in trade than to let another team offersheet him.  I'm Saad."

hawks,3br251,Stef41,39,Wed Jul 1 16:40:10 2015 UTC,Who is Saad's soon to be former agent?
hawks,3br251,bwohlgemuth,31,Wed Jul 1 17:29:05 2015 UTC,That's the only way I'll believe this is if he does fire his agent.
hawks,3br251,idoubledareya,27,Wed Jul 1 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely needs to fire his agent.  Guy represents a bunch of nobodies and Brooks Orpik, Torey Krug, Martin St. Louis and Brandon Saad.  Really needs to go to Pat Brisson (J. Toews, P. Kane, S. Crosby, J. Tavares, N. MacKinnon,C. Giroux, m Duchene, list goes on and on).  That's an agent who knows what he's doing."
hawks,3br251,Twelve2375,5,Wed Jul 1 14:06:23 2015 UTC,Yeah really seems like his agent is trying to milk a few high quality players (two of which are on the wrong side of 30 in Orpik (34) and St. Louis who just hit 40) for big paydays.  Not exactly what you want in an agent. I get that not everyone can have the best agent but I'd be wary of a guy who doesn't have a lot of upcoming talent on his client list.
hawks,3br251,Bison66,3,Wed Jul 1 14:48:12 2015 UTC,He has the record for highest amount a player has won in arbitration. That's worth something.

hawks,3br251,ChiefmoBaggins,5,Wed Jul 1 16:19:12 2015 UTC,He just has a skeezball look about him
hawks,3br251,DancingNancy4136,6,Wed Jul 1 14:14:21 2015 UTC,"Combine that with the fact that his last name is ""Gross"". The guy is like a writer's construction of the stereotypical sports agent."

hawks,3br251,thetreat,30,Wed Jul 1 14:07:42 2015 UTC,"No idea if this is true or not, but I had a suspicion this might be the case. Agents are greedy fuckers -- it wouldn't surprise me in the least if his agent demanded more money just to get himself a higher payday. :("
hawks,3br251,soundlife,8,Wed Jul 1 13:52:49 2015 UTC,"I don't like it either, but to be fair the agent's job is literally to be a greedy fucker."
hawks,3br251,thenuge26,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"For the player he represents, yes. I wouldn't be surprised if the agent wanted more money for Saad BECAUSE it meant HE himself would get more money."
hawks,3br251,soundlife,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"I would argue that its the agents job to acquire the most amount of money possible for a the player while protecting their career and interests. If Saad really wanted to stay in Chicago, it was his agents job to get every possible dime out of the Hawks. If all of this is true and Gross overplayed his clients worth, he failed. I'm skeptical myself that this is that one sided. I personally believe Saad refused the bridge and pushed for long term. Gross acting in Saads interest pushed for what would be a fair payday in the later years of the contract, which exceeded the boundaries of the Hawks cap situation.   The truly sad part will come when Saad inevitably looks much more human without the NHL elite on either side of him, and a lesser support structure surrounding him. He is a great player, but I personally feel the hawks are a synergy, and while we are weaker without Saad, he is absolutely weaker without us. I don't think his agent tried to fuck him over at all, but I also don't think this is what is best for his career. If its about money, I think the bridge contract was meant to lock him up for a couple of years until we could have cleared some cap room, after which we would have paid him well. I could be way off, but I think hard years with CBJ could lower his value when contract renewal time comes up. It just seems like an unfortunate miscommunication to me, and a myopic move by his agent.   Just my uneducated, groundless hypothesis. However, I think the agent tried to play hardball with Bowman and lost, never imagining the Hawks would let him go. In the end, I'm sad to see him go. But if cups and dynasties are the topic of discussion, Saad needed the Hawks more than we needed him."
hawks,3br251,king_of_pancakes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"I find that hard to believe with how competitive the sports agent market is.  He certainly could have done this behind closed doors, but that could destroy his career."
hawks,3br251,RocketRyne,6,Wed Jul 1 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"not too devistated according to his interview with CBJ.   Did you leave the negotiating entirely up to your agent? How involved were you in the process? Yes. As a player, I try to stay out of it as much as possible. You just try to play the game and have fun. As for the business part, you try to take the emotion out of it. I let my agent do that and he keeps me informed and talks to me about things that are going on, but for the most part I let him do the work. He knows the business more than I do.>"
hawks,3br251,wsando,4,Thu Jul 2 03:48:24 2015 UTC,"also this gem...   Knowing the Blackhawks' cap situation, did the idea of taking a hometown discount to stay in Chicago ever come up between you and your agent? That is something that crosses your mind but at the same time with the Blackhawks and how close they are to the cap, you knew something was going to happen with me or someone else and this time it was my time to go."

hawks,3br251,lezajskpl,13,Wed Jul 1 18:37:56 2015 UTC,"Regardless of who said/did what, Brandon will sign the next contract he gets.  If it's in Columbus, I don't see him being very happy after the first season there.  They're a great team, but you put those rosters side by side and Brandon is going to QUICKLY find out the different between playing for a team that's won 3 in 6 and a team who's trying to get there for the first time.  I've got a feeling they'll lock him up long term and Saad will be out of there in a 2-3 years, probably wanting to come back to Chicago and hopefully with a new agent and a better sense of how the business side of the NHL actually works.  I feel for him if he was taken advantage of, but if he was, this will be one hell of a learning experience and wake up call for him."
hawks,3br251,theduderman,26,Wed Jul 1 18:39:06 2015 UTC,I wish I made forty million dollars from my learning experiences :(

hawks,3br251,ClutchBender,7,Wed Jul 1 13:47:57 2015 UTC,This whole situation is fucked. I'm not sure if I want to rationalize the trade because of the contract he was looking for or be upset because his agent fucked him over
hawks,3br251,j_dirty,21,Wed Jul 1 14:38:24 2015 UTC,Rationalize it in that we have a secured second line center finally and a potential star in Dano.
hawks,3br251,idoubledareya,9,Wed Jul 1 15:46:04 2015 UTC,That's pretty much what I'm doing. Anisimov abd Dano are solid additions
hawks,3br251,j_dirty,5,Wed Jul 1 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"This hurts so much more than yesterday if this is true. In time it will pass, but this feels like a 22 year old kid got taken advantage of by his snake agent and fucked him out of what was potentially a dream situation for money that Saad may not have been demanding."
hawks,3br251,thetreat,6,Wed Jul 1 13:55:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe an AMA is due for Saads agent Lewis Gross @ SPM.  Give you skeptical folks an opportunity to clear things up, and closure."

hawks,3br251,jconley4297,3,Wed Jul 1 16:53:09 2015 UTC,Like we'd ever get an honest answer out of him... And Saad is too professional to come out publicly and say anything. Only way we know is if Saad fires his agent soon after signing with CBJ.
hawks,3br251,thetreat,3,Wed Jul 1 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"I think upper management deserves the support of the fans after giving us 3 cups.  And really there isn't an anti-uppermanagement attitude in the air I am just emphasizing that as a fan of this team I am going to support any moves they make.  Sad to see Saad go I agree.  Can't help but be reminded of when the White Sox traded my favorite player Carlos Lee to the brewers for Scott Podsednik in the 2004 offseason, I hated the move, it felt like cost cutting and rebuilding, didn't seem like a fair deal.  But looking back it was for the greater good."
hawks,3br251,niudropout,2,Wed Jul 1 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"I don't honestly think him leaving will make or break our season, the Blackhawks are still far too attractive to good talent to be slowed down by this.  It only sucks so bad because he came up through our system, which is something to be proud of as an organization. Most of them won't be franchise players, good ones will get away sometimes, but at the end of the day Stanbo is going to put a great team on the ice, Q will work his magic, and our leadership core will make sure the new arrivals know how we play hockey in Chicago."
hawks,3br251,Pineapple_Parade,6,Wed Jul 1 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"IF this is true and IF Saad's agent didn't properly communicate with Saad or the Blackhawks, then I'm pissed. Because as an agent, that player is your client and you need to do everything in your power to make him happy. If that means a slightly below market deal for a shorter time period than what is wanted then you get that deal done. I think if Saad fires him it suggests the agent went into business for himself and wanted to cash in on Saad's run.   Basically what I said in /r/hockey. His agent may have taken what Saad said ""I'd like 6.5mm but I'd take 4mm"" and his agent went to Stan and said ""Brandon isn't taking less than 6.5mm."""
hawks,3br251,Bison66,4,Wed Jul 1 16:34:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not buying it, I think this is a way to ensure he's not looked at as the bad guy for wanting too much money.  Pro Sports are a buisness. Everyone knows that."
hawks,3br251,RustyDarkstar76,4,Wed Jul 1 19:37:04 2015 UTC,"Don't know if it has been mentioned, but Versteeg left and came back. Morin had left, and is now back. In theory all these organizational grown players have came back?   Edit: However, I fear he will enjoy it a lot in Columbus and will fit right in with Johansen."
hawks,3br251,MorningWoodWorker,8,Wed Jul 1 23:56:42 2015 UTC,I don't know if Morin wanted to come back (problems with coach Q). But there is a lot of organizational grown players that left (Byfuglien and Bolland come to mind). I don't see Saad coming back because he will simply be too expensive in the upcoming years.
hawks,3br251,Jmckay03,4,Wed Jul 1 15:21:21 2015 UTC,Lost Bolland cause we had to make cap space for Bollig.  Depressing.
hawks,3br251,Televisions_Frank,5,Wed Jul 1 20:43:34 2015 UTC,Bickell
hawks,3br251,PublickStews,2,Wed Jul 1 14:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a solid point.  It's possible that his $6.5M is under his value in 2 or 3 years.  It's also possible that he doesn't shine on his own like he does sharing a line with Toews and Hossa and it becomes possible to trade for him and have Columbus retain some of his salary.  I'm actually not too upset with the deal on the whole though, and I think he'll learn to like his $39 million dollars or whatever he ends up with."
hawks,3br251,brianskuhar,5,Wed Jul 1 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"IF this is true...this just goes to show A. How truly greedy and not FOR the player an agent really is besides money and B. The agents have way too much power in these situations and ruin deals/teams/players. But i can't see this being the full story. I don't think Saad wanted the pay that was offered. I really think he thought he was up there with the Sharp's, Keiths etc in pay and we just can't offer that. Sucks but honestly i'm really excited about getting Anisimov and Dano along with Morin again."
hawks,3br251,livinlifeman,2,Wed Jul 1 15:56:38 2015 UTC,Maybe the agent screwed up.  Or maybe Saad thought he could have it all and that Bowman was bluffing.
hawks,3br251,wjbc,2,Wed Jul 1 16:34:56 2015 UTC,This makes sense to me. I was mad at Saad for not getting resigned but it was the agent that was handling it. Fire the agent and have the Hawks send an offer sheet for him to come back
hawks,3br251,Cartortus,2,Wed Jul 1 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"If this is true, then can we not expect Saad to sign a short term contract and attempt to come back to Chicago in a few years after we're rid of our poisonous contracts? He's still a FA... only his rights were acquired. He still has a lot of power.   Oh, and FUCK HIS SCUM BAG AGENT"
hawks,3br251,KWD0103,2,Wed Jul 1 14:33:31 2015 UTC,If he wanted to be here he would be here.
hawks,3br251,tomseymour12,2,Wed Jul 1 15:00:18 2015 UTC,This is even worse than his being traded away.  Bring him back!
hawks,3br251,PageSide84,2,Wed Jul 1 16:59:40 2015 UTC,This could be a big PR play by Saad.   Or it can be true and he will take a short deal in CBJ then come back to Chicago when we can afford him.
hawks,3br251,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Wed Jul 1 17:43:20 2015 UTC,I wish I could give Saad a big hug right now.  This hurts.
hawks,3br251,Trakis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:00:14 2015 UTC,Well he is going to have an extra few million to wipe his tears with.
hawks,3br251,chihawks,0,Wed Jul 1 16:09:56 2015 UTC,Take this with a lot of salt. Same guy reported Saad wanted 4+ and hawks were offering 2.8

hawks,3br251,frenchhornhero,-16,Wed Jul 1 17:25:48 2015 UTC,Its been said already but I'll say it again.  Saad isn't crushed about getting traded.  The guy laughed at 4.5/yr.  He's crushed about being traded to Columbus.
hawks,3br251,I_am_Rude,3,Wed Jul 1 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"His agent might have laughed at 4.5, I doubt Saad did."
hawks,3br251,jmr33090,5,Wed Jul 1 15:42:05 2015 UTC,Laughed at 4.5? I hadn't heard that.
hawks,3br251,TheSignPost,-1,Wed Jul 1 20:03:33 2015 UTC,Is there no way to reverse this? If the player doesn't want is he still forced to do it?

hawks,3brtni,KnightsoftheNi,34,Wed Jul 1 17:10:13 2015 UTC,Looks like this was the Q&A Mark was tweeting quotes from  Honestly the tone of the interview sounds like Saad is a bit sad but he doesn't sound like he feels his agent did him wrong. He dodged questions about the hometown discount and what kind of contract he was going for. I feel it could go either way but this interview doesn't lead me to believe his agent did anything that he would have done for himself.
hawks,3brtni,Sharobob,34,Wed Jul 1 17:46:53 2015 UTC,He's letting his agent be bad cop. It is what it is.
hawks,3brtni,MeowFood,5,Wed Jul 1 18:41:33 2015 UTC,And he's probably wise to.  He got a great deal (whenever he signs it) and he couldn't have gotten such a good one here.  Let the agent be the bad guy so the internet can hate him and keep on loving their man child.  Good for Saad I say.
hawks,3brtni,brianskuhar,3,Wed Jul 1 20:53:49 2015 UTC,i agree with your assessment
hawks,3brtni,sanbazhang,44,Wed Jul 1 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"Really looks like it's all coming back on the agent. Saad ""devastated"" saad not expecting a trade. Salads comment about winning being more important. Looks like his agent had other plans."

hawks,3brtni,GodIsTheSun,42,Wed Jul 1 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one here who can't give a fuck about him being devastated? He/His agents were pushing the hawks into a corner by being greedy. If you look at the extension for Anisimov, that was Saad's money, he could had that! We now have 3 Russians and a another young prospect and I for one am very excited about this coming season! Hope this sends a message to others. He just go sentenced to never winning a cup again. I would put money on Toronto winning a cup before the blue jackets."

hawks,3brtni,Thatsalotbruh,6,Thu Jul 2 00:22:31 2015 UTC,Right there with you. I feel no pity for Saad. The fact that he let his agent deal with 100% of the work almost shows he didn't care. Not buying the 'young and dumb' excuse most people are using.
hawks,3brtni,The_Poochinski,20,Wed Jul 1 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"Why not buying the""young and dumb"" thing? He's 22 and never dealt with a contract negotiation before, is it that unbelievable that he would just leave it to his agent who knows about this stuff?"
hawks,3brtni,gundersons,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"Letting your agent deal with the whole thing is letting someone else plan your life. Not having any say in that isn't 'young and dumb.' If you don't care enough to at least have 1% of say about your future, you simply don't care.  If he was really 110% hellbent on staying he would have hounded his agent the whole way."
hawks,3brtni,The_Poochinski,14,Wed Jul 1 21:08:55 2015 UTC,"Or maybe he trusted his agent enough to do what was best for him. There's a thousand and one things that we don't and probably won't ever know about this situation, but Saad's whole attitude since he arrived makes me hesitant to believe that he just doesn't give a shit."
hawks,3brtni,gundersons,2,Wed Jul 1 21:16:29 2015 UTC,If his agent fucked him that bad he would have fired him by now. There's plenty of agents that would love to have him as a client.
hawks,3brtni,jecs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:49:58 2015 UTC,"Finally someone. He was like 2 cups, probably won't win another, time to make some money. What a moron. Should have taken the bridge, but who cares! We have some awesome players and Stanbo is bringing in some class! Happy human again!"
hawks,3brtni,_Berns,3,Wed Jul 1 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was thinking the bridge deal was probably the ticket to the bigger career earnings number, but hearing that he's going to sign north of 6, I'm not sure that's true.  Especially when you factor in the risk of playing 2 more years before the big payday."
hawks,3brtni,brianskuhar,2,Wed Jul 1 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure Stan would have communicated to him, maybe include a signing bonus or just like a 1 year bridge deal or whatever. Like he just got sent to prison basically haha. I read a Chicago tribune article where it was basically the theme of the article that Saad got punished for being greedy. He'll have the payday, for sure, but will he have the cup again? Nope"
hawks,3brtni,_Berns,2,Thu Jul 2 05:11:10 2015 UTC,Yep! Excited to see some young guys come up. Hawks love to build from the Icehogs and there is quite a bit of talent in Rockford.
hawks,3brtni,The_Poochinski,2,Wed Jul 1 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"I am expecting us to get another experienced d-man, because having 2,4 and 7 run around after 3 rookies will be something else haha.

It will be interesting to see if Saad can have the same season playing with Line-mates who are not the Toews, Hossa and insert blackhawks player name here of the world and see what he's really capable of."

hawks,3brtni,augiemarched,21,Wed Jul 1 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"And now I feel really bad....but I'm still skeptical. I think he was drunk on the cup, said he would stay, and then realized he was more valuable but didn't want to go back on his word. There's a good chance he's throwing the agent under the bus, but he's an agent he'll be ok."
hawks,3brtni,Skweres88,13,Wed Jul 1 18:14:37 2015 UTC,He'll probably be able to sleep on his mounds of money he gets from having a job that is basically being a cold motherfucker and demanding as much money as possible so the player doesn't have to look greedy.
hawks,3brtni,Sharobob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:18:05 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not like a person with a soul they have to worry about.  He's an agent.
hawks,3brtni,brianskuhar,2,Wed Jul 1 20:58:43 2015 UTC,The agent doesn't care because he got paid. Looks like Saad should get a new agent.
hawks,3brtni,rdldr1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"That's his fault then. Career is too important to leave it up to an agent. Agents are greedy and are all about the money. If he was willing to stay for less, that was never going to be known. Just chalk it up to being young and naive I guess."
hawks,3brtni,KyleByFire,-1,Thu Jul 2 15:30:32 2015 UTC,Time to fire your agent and get a new one ASAP! He still has time to get an offer sheet from chicago

hawks,3brtwg,Siggy778,2,Thu Jul 2 17:06:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is much you can regret. Even if Saad goes on to be a first-ballot HoF player, there is no way that keeping him at his asking price would've been better for the team for the next several years. Paying him would've crippled the depth that has been a critical component in their multiple Stanley Cup wins. Hopefully there will be enough cap space when he is a FA to get him back."

hawks,3bscei,Weesc0,2,Wed Jul 1 19:40:18 2015 UTC,The sharp trade is going to hurt me; he's been on almost every Blackhawks team I've seen.
hawks,3bscei,charleybear8181,-3,Thu Jul 2 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the Hawks should have found a way to package Sharp or* Bickell with Saad. It's going to be a little tougher to move them now for sure."
hawks,3bscei,ACSimeon,15,Wed Jul 1 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"Trying to package a 5.9, 4 mil and now saad with 5.5 in a trade is going to be hard to do. Nearly 16 million in a trade, it's going to be hard to come out ahead without taking similar cap space back, just because CBJ still has to worry about their cap too."
hawks,3bscei,Coop3,5,Wed Jul 1 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"True, maybe just either Sharp or Bickell would have been nice. Now we're in the unenviable position of trying to move both without Saad to sweeten the deal."
hawks,3bscei,ACSimeon,5,Wed Jul 1 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"Packaging Bickell with him would have been smart, sharp should be able to fetch something of worth on his own.   But we got more than just a 2nd center and Dano in the saad trade. We can hopefully package mourin (sp?) and Bickell to move somewhere together."

hawks,3bspcc,CAKEDONTLIE,5,Wed Jul 1 21:33:27 2015 UTC,Have you looked at General Fanager or any other Capgeek replacement?    We have to trade someone (say Sharp/Bickell/Versteeg) before possibly re-signing Oduya/Krüger.
hawks,3bspcc,hockeyandquidditch,5,Wed Jul 1 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"We could sign both of them right now without going over the cap + 10%, but then we'd have to trade at least two of them after that. It's not necessary for the trades to happen first."
hawks,3bspcc,jmr33090,5,Wed Jul 1 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"Kept trying to get this through people's heads in the wake of Saad's trade.  No, the reason we didn't sign him wasn't because we haven't moved Sharp or Bickell yet, but because he wanted too much."

hawks,3bso5z,JasonEAltMTG,-16,Thu Jul 2 00:34:54 2015 UTC,I still think the trade is dogshit. I think we got fleeced and I think we could have gotten a better return for a great player. A lot of people do. I don't love Anisimov. I never have. He gets hit and injured a lot but watching other clips of him today he has grown on me. I never said Dano was terrible. I said the return for Saad was.

hawks,3bso5z,codz007,5,Thu Jul 2 03:45:07 2015 UTC,I can't fucking wait for Dano and Anisimov to have a great season so you can sit there with your arms folded and a frown on your face and pretend you weren't wrong about the trade.

And you think you're gonna call me a hypocrite and a liar and a coward and I'm gonna treat you with a ounce of respect. Get fucked.   I'm not pouting but if I want to, I will, you fucking douche."

hawks,3bso5z,JasonEAltMTG,2,Thu Jul 2 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"Why are you furious over the trade ?  We couldn't sign saad. It wasn't gonna happen for that price.   We needed a center and a Russian and Anisimov fits that perfectly. I say that hating anisimov. I've disliked hin for years. He's always watching the puck and gets destroyed. He also never uses his size. But we absolutely needed a Russian for Panarin to transition.   Dano was an excellent addition as he has good upside.  If bowman didn't make the trade we'd be offer sheeted. A 1st, 2nd and 3rd wouldn't help us at all.   We're a win now team and all three of those picks could end up useless.   We know anisimov and Dano will help now.   The fact that this trade was made right before the deadline is amaxing and I think it's one of the best moves we've made. We weren't keeping saad. We had no room to negotiate. I think we did well."
hawks,3bso5z,Heavenisatree,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:09:12 2015 UTC,Last second yes this is a phenomenal return. It shouldn't have been last second though. If it was obvious all year that he couldnt be signed they should've been planning for this and had trades set up rather than have to take the first one they could right at the deadline. They had all year to figure out how far apart they were and Stan put it off. The 4th could've been a first and Morin and Stropp are zeros.   I don't like Anisimov either and I don't like that we've signed him long term before we've even seen how he meshes with this team. I'm furious because I believe this was mismanaged. It clearly was when you hear Saads comments. And I think those fuck ups on Stan's side and Saad's side cost us a future HHOFer.   Dano looks good but it's too soon to tell where his ceiling will be. It's not too soon to guess where Saad's is.
hawks,3bso5z,Patrick_Kane,3,Fri Jul 3 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I know Kessel is a good player but he's kinda glorified baggage now, and Toronto was looking to unload big time. These two guys I think while not Saad (though with Dano still too young to know but I hear promising things) do give us what we need, especially Anisimov as a 2C (think how many times we whine about lack of 2C/3C versus lack of forwards?)"

hawks,3bso5z,Patrick_Kane,5,Wed Jul 1 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say if a team doesn't want Kessel without some cash retained, Toronto was more than happy to rid of him for a reason. Kessel produces but is he worth his contract? Probably not, but we'll see. It's a new team and new scenery, but he is over-rated."

hawks,3btgo9,Cartortus,29,Thu Jul 2 00:38:20 2015 UTC,We only have 18 players signed and have $1.5 mil in cap space left. It's out best choice to move him.  The return for him will only get worse.
hawks,3btgo9,Cammi_Granato,6,Thu Jul 2 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, we need the space to round out the roster. Sharp's money can go a long way to signing Kruger and a couple other solid depth guys."
hawks,3btgo9,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:36:21 2015 UTC,Do you know if we're aiming for a full roster at 23 or just scrape in at the minimum 20? I'm new to this so don't really know the best way to do it.
hawks,3btgo9,Daisyducks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"I don't believe ""the return for him will only get worse"" at all.   I'd say right now,  the return for him is as worse as possible."
hawks,3btgo9,Heavenisatree,12,Fri Jul 3 09:59:02 2015 UTC,"Cap space in general, and he's more than likely going to decrease in value. We need to turn around our older players for young guns to keep at this level."
hawks,3btgo9,Coop3,9,Thu Jul 2 00:39:36 2015 UTC,Based on current roster construction and salaries I think Oduya is more important to this team than Sharp. Getting 10s contract off the books allows us more options in other areas.
hawks,3btgo9,Captain_Serious19,5,Thu Jul 2 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"Probably still need more space, although we might be able to just scrape by if we don't retain any salary for Bickell?

hawks,3btgo9,ClintEastwood41,5,Thu Jul 2 02:46:39 2015 UTC,"Rumors are Oduya is still a possibility.  And I may be the only one, but I'd like to retain Desi next year.  Guy provided a lot on energy and can be an enforcer if needed.  We can probably get him for pennies."
hawks,3btgo9,1point-21-jigowatz,12,Thu Jul 2 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"I hated Smith for Desi when it happened but ate my words almost immediately and he was fantastic the rest of the way. He's a good, cheap guy. I doubt it would take more than $1.5mill to re-sign him so I wouldn't mind a good long look at bringing him back if we can."
hawks,3btgo9,Twelve2375,6,Thu Jul 2 01:50:25 2015 UTC,This exactly. Having Desi back would be huge for us. I want more of the Shaw-Desi-Kruger line pls
hawks,3btgo9,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:31:06 2015 UTC,"It's possible to keep him, but that means having Baun, Hartman, Danault, Johns, Dano,  and Panarin all on the roster. Q doesn't like young guys that much, so I'm not sure how that'll work out. Then, we'd have to retain no salary from Bickell & Versteeg trades, let Oduya walk, and re-sign Kruger for an AAV of 2 mil. Is it impossible? No, is it highly improbable? Yes."
hawks,3btgo9,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:44:00 2015 UTC,We need to move him unless the Blackhawks can play a season with 5 less players than the required opening day minimum.
hawks,3btgo9,WonAndDone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:50:06 2015 UTC,"Not only because you're not ever going to get a better return for him from this point on and simply because they need cap space, but because if they keep him then the  trading of Saad looks even worse. Even if they could keep him, it'd still be bad. Essentially they will have moved Saad at the expense of keeping Sharp. Not good. Not good at all."
hawks,3btgo9,jerry200890,4,Thu Jul 2 12:52:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's fair logic at all. Moving Saad had nothing to do with Sharp whether they traded Sharp or not. If they traded Sharp, they still weren't going to sign Saad for close to 6.5 mil AAV or else they would've already done it knowing they'll trade Sharp sometime this offseason."

hawks,3bs1rk,ChaplnGrillSgt,8,Wed Jul 1 23:05:24 2015 UTC,yeah if we pick up one winger in free agency (or leave versteeg) i think it'll look like this (its not going to but I'd love to keep the russians together)  Hossa - Toews - Kane (i know we like to keep them apart but..)  Panarin - Ansimov - Tikhonev  Danos - Taco - Shaw  Versteeg/???? - Kruger - ????
hawks,3bs1rk,djb2287,19,Wed Jul 1 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"I like Shaw with Kruger more. Shaw will sometimes put himself out of position, but Kruger always seems to be in the right place."
hawks,3bs1rk,chocolate_chip_kelly,7,Wed Jul 1 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"Still got guys ready that were down in Rockford. McNeil or Hartman I could see making the team. Also the possibility we keep Sharp and deal Versteeg. I think they'll keep Kane on the 2nd line, Shaw on 4th, but Idk who will play with Toews and Hossa."

hawks,3bqy10,thebeefy_T,0,Wed Jul 1 17:36:11 2015 UTC,Well yeah but I'd rather him stay on the ice to celebrate another one afterward.  I'd like to see a lot of him doing some league-sanctioned goal celebrations for the next 6 years.

hawks,3bqy10,HazeGrey,0,Thu Jul 2 01:06:20 2015 UTC,He did.
hawks,3bqy10,HazeGrey,40,Thu Jul 2 01:05:31 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are this: Bowman is very high on him because he's a larger Centerman that can draw the larger D-men. If he's going to be our 2C that means he's taking the Victor Hedmans away from Kane. This could give Kane some more space in the offensive zone.   I live in Columbus and have seen Arty play a lot the past couple years. He's big and strong and a little more offensive minded than a Vermette or Richards which could really help Kane score. Although, I think Q will turn him into more of a 2-way player.   If somehow we end up getting Semin, I think we could even throw out a line with all Russians (the iron curtain line): Semin - Anisimov - Panarin"
hawks,3bqy10,TheRiot530,9,Wed Jul 1 13:47:45 2015 UTC,Iron Curtain Line.  Oh yes.  This now needs to be a thing.

hawks,3bqy10,HISTORYBLAST,-3,Wed Jul 1 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"Why do people always say things like ""a Vermette""?  I understand saying ""the Hedmans"" because that's referring to a group of players who fill that similar role on different teams throughout the league, but with Vermette you're specifically referring to him.  Who's fault is this?  Did it come from ESPN?  I hear this throughout sports coverage and it's just a stupid."
hawks,3bqy10,mikeypat15,16,Wed Jul 1 15:16:11 2015 UTC,Remember this is an extension and his hit next season is still roughly 3.2 million.

hawks,3bqy10,DrHampants,10,Wed Jul 1 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"For a 2c in his prime, this is fine, and the extension doesn't kick in until next year.   It doesn't help our cap situation right now, true, but we're still probably going to trade Bickell and Versteeg. We might be able to keep Sharp, though, which would be great."

On a Blackhawks team with cap problems. Insane! Four point five five. And we're stuck with this decision for six years. Unreal.
hawks,3bqy10,thelifeofbob,2,Wed Jul 1 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"It's a good move. We got a huge, young Russian center to keep mafks off Kane. That alone is worth 4mil. He's going to score more goals this year playing with Kane for sure."
hawks,3bqy10,brianskuhar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:36:25 2015 UTC,Artem takes up room in front of the net and keeps Kaner's collarbones where they should be. Bummed to infinity over losing Saad but in StanBo we trust!
hawks,3bqy10,Bison66,0,Wed Jul 1 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"He also hasn't been playing on a team with other players who need the attention the Chicago forwards do.  If he's the 2C, you can guarantee Kane will attract enough attention to open up some lanes for him.  You can't look at his stats alone if you're looking at his numbers on a team that's cracked 90 points once in the last 5 years and project it onto a team with the depth Chicago has.  It's still possible that he's not worth the money they signed him for, but it's just as easily possible that it's a bargain.  Also keep in mind that in 6 years when this thing expires, the cap will have increased at least a couple of times.  He'll seem really cheap then if he's even a little above average."
hawks,3bqy10,ViagraAndSweatpants,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"I mean right now, if Anisimov is the 2C we're looking at lines of   Sharp-Toews-Hossa  Teuvo-Arty-Kane  Shaw-Kruger-Paranin  4th line escapes me at the moment, but I'm pretty happy about those three lines.  Yeah I could down with a top six like that."
hawks,3bqy10,pjakubo86,11,Wed Jul 1 17:38:34 2015 UTC,Tuevo is a center and should be playing next year as 3C.  Kruger remaining on 4C in checking line with Shaw
hawks,3bqy10,P33KAJ3W,4,Wed Jul 1 15:35:54 2015 UTC,"Assuming Bickell, Desi, and Versteeg go, I think the lines might look something like this:  Sharp-Toews-Hossa  Kane-Arty-SIGNING  Dano-Teuvo-Panarin  Shaw-Kruger-Nordstrom  Or maybe we trade for a 3C and Teuvo moves up to the second line as a winger."

hawks,3boja5,ChipSchafer,6,Wed Jul 1 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I said. The kid has two cups already, is constantly getting better and better, and he sees the long shadows that Hossa, Kane, and Toews cast.  He'll be a superstar in Columbus, no doubt. I see this as him taking a larger role to further his career. He'll get even more minutes there. Hometown discount sounds nice and all, but Saad doesn't owe Chicago anything at this point. He more than earned his development and got us a center. Honestly, it's half Chicago's fault because of the Bickell and Sharp contracts. I knew that'd cause problems with a younger player re-signing later on. Here it is."

Saad will either ask to be traded or get moved at the deadline in 2-3 years, and the Jackets won't make the playoffs once in that time.  Mark my words."

So the more eager CLB players beat them to more loose pucks.   No no, I'm sure every team gave exactly the same effort against a basement team they didn't have to worry about in a month.

Professional athletes have to make nearly every dollar they will ever need prior to the age of 40. Sure, they make a lot of money but can you imagine the skill and discipline it takes to budget the rest of your life when you quit working at 40 (likely earlier)? Most of us can't look at our bank account and budget through the end of the month. These guys, upon retirement, have to look at their bank accounts and make it match their lifestyle until death.  Meanwhile, they are getting every stupid business plan that their friend, cousin, ""business manager"" comes at them with. And face it, these guys aren't I-bankers. They are jocks.   There is a reason so many professional sports players are disgraced as bankrupt has-beens. They thrive on emotions and forget to fully comprehend that this is their business.  Saad will always love the Hawks. When he is retired, he will probably still root for them. Today though, he has to think about himself. Who are we to blame the guy?"

Yeah he said he wants to win but he may not have expected teams to offer him that large of a contract. Plus we still don't know who was planning on signing him to an offer sheet. It's possible he saw a good team offering him big money and realized he shouldn't sell himself short with a bridge deal with Chicago. Sucks to lose another great young player because of the cap but this is the nature of the beast. Best of luck to Saad, and I'm glad I'll be in Columbus another year to see you in some games!"

His leaving isn't up to him. Saad had the option to stay here for ~$5 and he bailed for $6.5. What was all this talk about a discount and a winning culture? Thanks for a solid few years, Saad, but it's hard to respect this decision. Have fun in Ohio. Hope you know what your doing. Ugh, this picture makes me want to cry. SO MANY MIXED EMOTIONS  Dano: You got some big fucking skates to fill, kid. People seem to think you have it in you. Hope they're right.  Morin: Fuck you. You better be fucking great to make up for being so whiny and demanding a trade cause Q doesn't trust you. You better prove that you're worth what you think you are."

We get more talent per $ with what we received than we would have if we kept Saad. As much as I love him, $6.5 is too high for now. He may be worth it in the future, but a salary cap troubled team can't take that gamble and Saad should've known that. Dano and Artem combined may be better for our lineup than Saad alone. And at half the price..."

And if they trade Versteeg/Sharp they need to get a LW back, because they're losing depth quickly. de la Rose from MTL would be a good fit in a Sharp trade, plus we'd have room for a small signing or two."
hawks,3boja5,KWD0103,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:21 2015 UTC,"Now that we don't need to re-sign Saad, we may be able to keep Sharp this season... Or trade Sharp and offer Oduya some $.

hawks,3boja5,Panaran,0,Wed Jul 1 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"I love all the people ripping him for taking the money.  He was a key player in 2 Stanley cup wins and played as hard as anyone, and he did it for relatively dogshit money.  He doesn't owe the Blackhawks anything at this point.  Yeah, home town discount for the team that gave him his first chance to shine sounds all great and noble, but he contributed more than his fair share to the Blackhawks during his tenure.  It amazes me that people really expect Saad to just give up ~$12million over the next 6 years.  It's debatable whether or not he's worth $6.5 million a year, but I think he is.  He was a top line quality talent on a hockey dynasty with multiple FHOF players, and he's only 22..he hasn't even reached his final form.  I'll take a player that can pass, shoot, skate, puckhandle, forcheck, defend, and come up big in crucial spots like Saad can anyday, and he's only getting better.  Keep in mind that we have been paying Patrick ""worthless dogshit for the past 2 years"" Sharp the same money, and Saad is better now than Sharp ever was."
hawks,3boja5,teachzim,-2,Wed Jul 1 02:53:16 2015 UTC,"Um...Am I missing something? Cause Everyone keeps saying ""Saad left"" for the money... As far as I know he's still a RFA and hasn't signed anything. Meaning CBJ just have his rights now... and they still have to come up with a contract for Saad- One that he would sign. Hear me out: Is it NOW possible that Saad sees he's nowhere near winning the Cup again- even if he signs a big money 6 year deal. And instead he elects to take that smaller bridge deal so he could become a UFA sooner?  Saad was quickly becoming one of my favorite players and the name puns and memes will be missed. The Saadfather and Kneel before Saad are no longer. :( Thanks Saader!"

hawks,3boja5,teachzim,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is this: Saad wanted a long term deal w/ the Hawks thinking that w/Kane,Toews he would be in the hunt for a cup each year... (and he didn't want to wait for his cash) Now that he's in a spot that doesn't have that Cup possibility...at least in the next year or two... He could sign for 2 years @ $5M per.  become a FA sooner and pick his own destination- like his hometown Pit or back to Chicago?"

If the rumors are true that he could get 6.5 x 6 years that's gonna be too hard to pass up. If he was willing to take that smaller deal he would have done it with the Hawks. Unless his agent was so incompetent that he tried to bluff that Hawks by saying he wouldn't sign for less years, there is no way he's passing up a long-term deal."

hawks,3bw6la,wickerwacker,6,Thu Jul 2 20:23:15 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that he regrets asking for a lot of money.   EDIT: He left because Stan and him/his agent were off by like 1 mil (long term wise) and Saad didn't seem to want to do a bridge deal. Because of that he is now going from a team that has gone to 2 Stanley Cup Finals which they won both times and also went to a conference final to a team that is contending to just make the playoffs.   Article wasn't good...
hawks,3bw6la,Captain_019,6,Thu Jul 2 17:58:07 2015 UTC,I've seen more research done in articles from The Onion.
hawks,3bw6la,Stool_Gizmoto,5,Thu Jul 2 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"OK, I think we can all agree with piece is shit and does a horrible job of representing our fanbase. I won't be party to a smear campaign out of a pout that a player chose money.   Having said that, it may be unpopular in this sub, but I am disappointed with Saad. I know he can chase money, but I guess I am the sort of person who believes that going for 6.5 million over 5 years (32.5 million) is greedy when you can stay a Hawk, be part of a dynasties future, and ""only"" bring in 5 million for 5 years (25 million) or if he took a bridge, made 4 for 2, then signed a bigger contract when the cap went up.   Don't get me wrong, I get it. You only have a few years to make your money. But I feel when you have 25 million dollars in our account, whats an extra 7.5? What is that worth to you? I know this is an unpopular opinion, and I have been getting shit for it everytime I state it. I am just of the opinion that cashing in when you are part of a historical team/group, its greedy.   I wish Saad all the success in the world and hold absolutely no ill will. I know he owes nothing to the owners, coaches, or the fans. He has to do what's best for him. I just prioritize differently than Brandon Saad does."

I don't see the need to rip a guy for getting what he can in free agency when it would not be possible here... Which is what this article has set out to do: rip Saad for being greedy. We are all free to have our opinions and I don't agree with the one in this article or blog.
hawks,3bw6la,leakfrei,4,Thu Jul 2 17:54:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  And just because the Hawks can't afford him doesn't mean he doesn't deserve that money.  Hell, I can't afford a Ferrari, so I have a Honda."

hawks,3bw6la,Epogen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:00:11 2015 UTC,I think the pay cut was just too big. He would of taken 1 mil less but not 3. He still hasn't signed a new deal so we'll see what the numbers were
hawks,3bw6la,joosonloose,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, but Leak hit it on the head.  Brandon Saad didn't owe us anything other than to play hard while he was here for the money we were paying him.  The guy emptied his tank every shift and for that we should thank him and move on."

No you say you love it here and want to return  Don't be bitter. Its a business and dude took the money. In a sport where the next hit could be career ending you take the money
hawks,3bw6la,redbluegreenyellow,8,Thu Jul 2 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"You could say ""we'll see what the future holds"" not ""i'll take a discount to stay with the hawks, money doesn't mean everything, I want to stay with the team"""
hawks,3bw6la,KCchemist,2,Thu Jul 2 19:07:24 2015 UTC,We'll never know for sure what went down.  He could have easily said he'd take less if needed and his agent played too much hardball on his behalf and he got traded.  There are indications that he was completely surprised by the trade.  It's not like he had offers from the Hawks and CBJ and took a higher offer from CBJ.  He was traded on speculation and negotiation by his agent.  Not to say he's automatically innocent though.  He very well could have said 6 years 6.5mil or I'm out.  Just that we don't know the facts and shouldn't call him an asshole just yet when he seems less than thrilled to be with CBJ.

hawks,3bw6la,redbluegreenyellow,4,Thu Jul 2 17:55:48 2015 UTC,CBJs 1st line is nothing to scoff at. They'll be a contending team this year and I still believe he'll put up solid numbers

They may not have as much depth forward wise as some other teams, but they have a lot of young guys who only played short seasons who will be coming up. When it comes to the playoffs they will have to deal with a bloated metro division which may get in their way, but they'll at least be contenders until the end"

hawks,3bw6la,discometalstu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:58:11 2015 UTC,I wanna clarify I'm not one of those fans. I want to see him succeed but I do think that later on when he retires he will say this was a mistake in his career
hawks,3btint,Verrique,6,Thu Jul 2 00:50:57 2015 UTC,Yes most likely. Better to keep defense at this stage and try to move sharp or bicks.

Wonder if we can get that done this summer.."
hawks,3btint,yorozuyajin-chan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"I see Seabrook's extension being a lower AAV than Green. He'll be 2 years older than Green is now and I believe Green is a better defenseman overall, not by a lot tho. I think it's very possible Seabrook's cap hit will actually be less with his new extension than it is now. I'm hoping it'll be around 5 mil AAV for about 5 years."
hawks,3btint,jmr33090,6,Thu Jul 2 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"Not a chance.  Seabrook is a much better defenseman than Green is.  All the things I've seen have Seabs taking about 7 mil AAV on his next extension.  All green is better at is offense, and that's even marginal.  His work in his own zone is a dumpster fire."
hawks,3btint,badseedjr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's not like Seabrook is elite in his own zone, better than Green for sure, but Green has improved far beyond what I'd call a dumpster fire in his own zone.  Either way though, 7 mil is Subban/Doughty money and I don't see any way Seabrook gets that pay at age 31, that's crazy. Very possible he could get 7 mil in the first year of a long contract, something like 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, which would come out to 5 AAV, but no way does he get an AAV of 7."
hawks,3btint,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"You have to remember, that's Subban/Doughty money from the years past.  Look at what guys like Petry and Sekera are getting.  Those guys aren't even on the same level as Seabs, and they all got 5+ per year.  7 for Seabs is going to be close."
hawks,3btint,badseedjr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"Petry is 27 and Sekara is 29. Their contracts start in their prime and Petry will be in his prime for the majority of his contract. I just don't see the Blackhawks giving Seabrook a contract through age 36 with AAV of 7, that just seems crazy.  And yes, the numbers I quoted are from years past, but given the slow increase in the salary cap lately, I can't imagine contract prices skyrocketing for non elite players."
hawks,3btint,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"While those guys are 27 and 29, They aren't nor will be, as good as he is.  31 isn't exactly old for a D-man.  I'm not sure he'd get 7 AAV, but I've seen it more than once in speculation.  I don't see 5 as even reasonable though.  I could maybe see a compromise at 6-6.5 per, with the actual salary front loaded and trailing off as he's older."
hawks,3btint,badseedjr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:18:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, AAV of 5 is me being hopeful he takes a discount and I know it's not that likely, I still don't see it being over 6 though. Realistically, I'm expecting somewhere between 5.5 and his current hit of 5.8. If they give him a 6th year though, they could probably bring the hit down to between 5 & 5.5. I'd be surprised if they went over 5 years tho."
hawks,3btint,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, term is something I'm not sure on.  6 seems like a lot. I could see a 4 year 25-26 million though."
hawks,3btint,badseedjr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:38:36 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for 5 instead of 4 just to reduce the cap hit mainly.
hawks,3btint,jmr33090,3,Thu Jul 2 16:47:28 2015 UTC,He's got a year left and he's one of the best defensive players in the league. He'll be on the team
hawks,3btint,odd_orange,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"I like Seabrook, but he doesn't cut it as one of the best defenseman in the league imo."
hawks,3btint,Mad_Hatter_Bot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:09:33 2015 UTC,I don't know how people can say this after seeing his post-season production and cluth goals.
hawks,3btint,Night-watcher,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"Because he's 3rd best defensmen on his team, and had some visible lapses in production during games that the other 2 guys didn't have.  If Oduya had ANY offensive game, he maybe the worst of the big 4.  He's good, don't get me wrong...but his ""clutch"" is not like Toews/Kane who find another gear late in series.  Seabrook takes the same shots he always takes.  He's not aiming any better.  They just happen to go in.  (this also means that he misses quite often in ""clutch"" situations...and we just don't remember it)"

hawks,3br0sb,TheFuckingEagles,14,Wed Jul 1 13:24:58 2015 UTC,I'd like to see him back but if he just wants a payday I can live with him leaving
hawks,3br0sb,hlainelarkinmk2,3,Wed Jul 1 14:06:16 2015 UTC,"I like Desi, but he is an expendable depth player IMO. He will be looking to get paid way above what he should and someone will pay him. We can replace him."

I mean damn, i get the whole payday thing but cmon...they're all already flooded with cash, who wouldn't take a discount for more Cups? (not that they're guaranteed) but the more guys we lose that played vital parts (Desi,Richards, Vermette, Saad) the more difficult it will become when it shouldn't have to."
hawks,3br0sb,livinlifeman,22,Wed Jul 1 14:55:22 2015 UTC,Dude... Desi is a 4th liner.  Those guys don't have many chances to stay in the league let alone a chance to make a better contract coming off a Cup team.  He proved he is worth more than his current contract and I hope he gets a good pay day.
hawks,3br0sb,ViagraAndSweatpants,-1,Wed Jul 1 15:51:01 2015 UTC,Krugs is a 4th liner too...they have value especially on the hawks. I don't understand what point you're trying to make...basically you're saying he barelt has a chance of staying in the league being a 4th liner...so he wouldn't get a pay day and what I'm trying to say is then why wouldn't he take the pay he can get from the hawks and stay on a guaranteed deep playoff team.
hawks,3br0sb,livinlifeman,5,Wed Jul 1 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple really - he can make more money at a different team.  His value may be at its absolute highest right now.  There is very little job security for those guys and he needs to get the most he can while its there.  It's crazy how easy it is for some fans to say, ""Oh, he's a rich athlete, he should just leave $500,000 on the table so he can be on a better team.""  You and I both know you wouldn't leave that money and its idiotic to assume an athlete would too.  Yes there are some exceptions that get made due to comfort level, family, etc, but for the most part, these guys have a small window of opportunity to make good money and they shouldn't waste it."

hawks,3br0sb,helpful_shawn_,-2,Wed Jul 1 16:31:57 2015 UTC,Serious that 4th liners have a lot of value on our team? Yes...do you watch blackhawk hockey? Would you stay on a cup team when you're already making 750k when there's a CHANCE you could make maybe 1mil on a non contender? I know i would...what can you not do with 750k a yr?
hawks,3br0sb,livinlifeman,8,Wed Jul 1 16:49:15 2015 UTC,Will ANY hawk take a discount?   I was taking about that. Fuck that. They're playing a violent game and their career can end in an instant with no warning. They don't owe the Hawks anything and they don't have to apologize to you for getting paid.
hawks,3br0sb,helpful_shawn_,-3,Wed Jul 1 16:51:03 2015 UTC,Did i ever say they did? And when did i say they have to apologize. Holy shit calm down there warrior...an entry level contract makes any player a rich man as do their endorsements etc. Cup contender > money but i guess that's just me.

hawks,3br0sb,helpful_shawn_,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"Kane and Toews are a big reason why we're always in this cap issue. While i think they really are the best dynamic duo in the league, no player should garnish 10.5 mil but that's the nature of the beast. Some other team would have paid that easily. I'm not new here.

hawks,3bommi,MartindalexC,92,Tue Jun 30 22:02:54 2015 UTC,"I've put this in the other post but I feel it should be here also.  Bare with me here but reddit on mobile is pretty bad for submitting shit. Here's my thoughts:  Losing Saad is a massive loss, no one can even begin to refute that, however there should be cases made that given the conditions Saad was placed under, anyone could succeed the way he did.  He very often played with Toews and Hossa who by all accounts are pretty 'decent' players, so much so that even if you placed a 4th liner there he'd probably excel based on the fact the opposing team just can't cover all the spaces. Now I'm not saying Saad is a 4th liner, far from it, however perspective is key with trades imo.  So we lose a guy who had a huge influence on the recent cup win so ofc we're going to be biased towards a guy who we have become to love so dearly, but remember that he scored 52pts this past season and 11pts in the postseason, dropping 6.5mil (Reported amount) on production like that alone is pretty 'Bickell-ish'.   Now who do we gain in the trade? Outside of prospects (Who admitted I know nothing about) the main piece is Anisimov, who seems like a solid 2/3 centre for next season. Now Anisimov is Russian, something that could prove extremely valuable when Panarin arrives next season as it gives him someone to talk to and someone to help him find his own in Chicago, who knows how much this kind of influence helped Teuvo when he came up (With regards to Timonen)?   Furthermore this actually gives the Hawks cap stability in the future imo. In 4 years if Saad stayed, he would most likely begin to command something in excess of 7mil. Proving to be very restricting on the cap with the T/K contracts well in force, however with Saad gone, Anisimov would not be looking for any major cap increase close to what Saad would most likely command, giving room for other players, specifically depth players.  Now another thing to factor in is that Semin is also now an FA. With a minimum of two Russian players on the team now does Chicago become his first choice destination? Imagine a line of Panarin - Anisimov - Semin. The cap for this expenditure could (And tbh most likely) be freed up by trading away Bickell.   Potential lineup for next year with the Saad trade:   Sharp - Toews - Hossa Panarin - Teuvo - Kane Versteeg - Anisimov - Shaw   Vs   Saad - Toews - Hossa Panarin - Teuvo - Kane Versteeg - ? - Shaw  Sure the lineups are close but if Bowman is able to snag Semin and such, the trade becomes very good.   TLDR: Saad gone is an absolute bummer, but the more I think about it, the more I can understand why Bowman has done what he has done."
hawks,3bommi,Blaze6181,31,Tue Jun 30 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"First, you should start a blog if you don't have one already.  Second, I love your analysis. I think most of this can be summarized by saying that the Hawks are a team that is greater than the sum of its parts. Though it's easy to say that Saad is a big loss, we have freed up space for Stan and the FO to work their magic, and we can get three players for the price of Saad.   That has always been our bread and butter. Those new players could be our next Ben Smith, or Shaw, Kruger, Bolland, Madden, Frolik, etc. They all helped bring us there as a team. And I think the FO is betting that it happens again with this new crop of players."

hawks,3bommi,odd_orange,13,Wed Jul 1 02:10:57 2015 UTC,"I was shocked when I saw the news, but when I saw what the Hawks got back, I didn't mind the trade much. I'm going to piggyback your post with some numbers  Brandon Saad    Has 2 complete seasons so far.  He has put up 47 and 52 points respectively.  He is 22 years old and will presumably get a contract worth 6.5 mil.  He was 3rd in goals last year for the Hawks and was 4th in overall points.    Artem Anisimov    Played on 52 games last year totaling 27 points. His faceoff percentage was a career low %44.5.  The season before (his last full season) he put up 39 points with a faceoff percentage of %49.  He is 27 years old and played mostly on the 2nd/3rd line in Columbus.    For perspective...   Brad Richards put up 37 points last year  He averaged 2 minutes less ice time. His faceoff percentage was %48.4 He's 35 years old   Marco Dano Here's a quick rundown   20 years old, regarded as a top prospect for CBJ Had 21 points in 35 games in the NHL last season.  Had 19 points in 39 games in the AHL Even if you doubled the points, and he had 42 over an 82 game season, it would put him on par with Sharp on the list of leading scorers for the Hawks.    For those unfamiliar with the forward who will be gracing the Hawks next year as well....  Artemy Panarin He's been lighting up the KHL   23 years old Put up 40 points in 13-14 then 62 last year in the KHL Should easily be in the top 6 for the Hawks   Sharp will still most likely be gone and I can see Kane and Arty Pans swapping between the 1st and 2nd line. We also have Morin for depth and the possbility of Ryan Haggerty making his NHL debut season at 22 (acquired from the Raanta deal).   I'll be interested to see what they get for Sharp, since they could continue to add some young depth, or just unload his salary for a pick or two. While it sucks Saad is gone, this is a decent return for him. Keep in mind Seabrook's deal is up next year as well as Shaw's. What's most important is that they still have Kane and Toews for years to come, so I'm not too worried with who Stan is able to put beside them since he's been able to do it the past couple years."
hawks,3bommi,Blaze6181,6,Wed Jul 1 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"This is a great write-up. Thanks! This makes me excited for the future Dano, Artem & Artemy crew to show us what they've got.  In your opinion, is Anisimov as underwhelming as his stats show, or was he, for instance, just having a down year?"
hawks,3bommi,odd_orange,6,Wed Jul 1 01:29:59 2015 UTC,"He's an interesting player. He had a lot of upside coming up with the Rangers and I feel like injuries deterred his development. He then got sent over to Columbus and while he played with some talent, I feel like it will be a welcome change of scenery. People can forget how much a winning environment and established stars can positively affect a player's mentality. While I don't see him exploding, he can at least have solid production on par with Vermette or Richards."
hawks,3bommi,Blaze6181,2,Wed Jul 1 02:00:46 2015 UTC,"On par with Vermette or Richards is exactly what I needed to hear. I was so excited to hear that Vermie was traded to us, and it's nice to see we might be able to make it through all this cap trouble with a player of that quality."
hawks,3bommi,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,3,Wed Jul 1 02:06:49 2015 UTC,Although Vermy seems to have him soundly beat in the FO%. I really hope we use Artem as part of a trade to sweeten the Bickell deal? And then hopefully resign Vermy and Desi. But I might just be dreaming

hawks,3bommi,PrisonedMuffin,12,Tue Jun 30 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"They do have Ryan Johansen and Nick Foligno, though. Ryan Johansen could keep Saad being very good."
hawks,3bommi,HardKnockRiffe,6,Tue Jun 30 22:11:26 2015 UTC,"Foligno is a LW, so they probably won't play on the same line together."
hawks,3bommi,PrisonedMuffin,8,Tue Jun 30 22:23:08 2015 UTC,"Still though, Saad is in a very good situation with your team. This is a team, when healthy, is a serious contender. I could definitely see a Columbus vs Tampa Bay ECF next year."

If the Hawks aren't on, I specifically choose to watch the Blue Jackets because I love the way they play. Plus, you now have Saad.  If you ask me, you should let yourself be optimistic!"
hawks,3bommi,HardKnockRiffe,2,Wed Jul 1 01:39:00 2015 UTC,Optimistic that we have a chance at winning it all if we're healthy? I definitely am. Optimistic that we'll stay healthy? Meh...

hawks,3bommi,loaferbro,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:56:01 2015 UTC,"To me is like the concept of the harks sweaters after they win. Prices rose from 170 to over 200. Same sweaters, just price hiked because they were champs.  Apply this to players, and Saad sees it as ""I probed myself to earn what I made this year. This is what I want for you guys to keep me, and I will prove myself to be worth that next year."" He's not worth 6.5, but I feel like him asking for that price is his way of saying by the end of the season he will be worth it, and that salary is his incentive to play at that level.  It seems, astronomical to us, but it's still his job. Would you get paid minimum wage if you ran a law office?"
hawks,3bommi,Cartortus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:38:46 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you say you are correct but I just don't like being lied to. He said he was gonna get it done with a discount and we didn't get it done with any discount

hawks,3bommi,HelloNeumann29,7,Wed Jul 1 04:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'll play devils advocate: he ultimately has an ego (I do feel like hockey players in general have less ego than the other pro sports) that wanted to get what he thought he was worth. So maybe he had one number in his head when he talked ""discount"" and our offer caught him way off guard. Its hard for us to think that way given that I don't think many in this sub are making 7 figures (or even the low end of the pro salaries in the mid/high 6 figure range) - so we're like ""you're a greedy pro athlete"" - I dunno, I'm stoned and I don't think he should be demonized for what happened. I think if we had the flexibility to pay closer to what he wanted, we would have - and I'm happy he's going to what seems to be a good/improving team in Columbus. Hopefully he does well and if we meet the Jackets in the SCF next year, we whoop their ass and make him realize you don't know what you had until its gone."

hawks,3bommi,lizard_king_rebirth,12,Tue Jun 30 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"I imagine they did explore all other options and that this made the most sense. It's three solid forwards who can all at the very least play on the bottom 6, one young forward with potential and a pick. That is likely way more than we could have gotten for Bickell or Sharp. And plus, if Saad really wanted a 6 year contract at 6.5 per year the 'Hawks weren't going to be able to pay it anyway. I really don't think this deal is bad. and I love Saad."

hawks,3bommi,Axios319,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:39:12 2015 UTC,Lord people.  I didn't intend to say CBJ should be playing in the AHL next season or anything like that. Just a off-color joke about their historically irrelevant teams. Whoops.
hawks,3bommi,Kglee54,4,Wed Jul 1 01:47:41 2015 UTC,Do you think this means Sharpie stays in Chicago?
hawks,3bommi,Broseff_Stalin,8,Wed Jul 1 02:09:36 2015 UTC,Or Vermette?
hawks,3bommi,OleLabby88,7,Thu Jul 2 17:20:16 2015 UTC,It would be awesome to have Vermette back for a full season.
hawks,3bommi,Sarclown,4,Tue Jun 30 22:28:39 2015 UTC,Anisimov just became our 3C
hawks,3bommi,cornyb,3,Tue Jun 30 22:46:21 2015 UTC,"Don't think so, Anisimov will probably be 2C and TT 3C. We're gonna be paying Anisimov $3M+ so no way Vermette fits in."

hawks,3bommi,Bhawks2,2,Wed Jul 1 02:01:17 2015 UTC,I hope so. That would be such a fun line to watch. He would learn well from Hossa!
hawks,3bommi,maximumrocker,2,Wed Jul 1 00:42:49 2015 UTC,He's gonna learn a lot from all the name players in the Hawks. Should develop to be another Saad like player

PS - I'm in the bargaining phase of my grief and now I fully expect all of this to be a move to acquire garbage to package with Sharp and Bickell so we can turn around and re-sign Saad tomorrow.  I will believe that until told otherwise, or until I ingest an acceptable amount of alcohol that my brain forgets we traded Saader in the first place."

Anisimov is a solid 3C/4C (EDIT: In Columbus where they have a lot of centers so here where we have Toews and Kruger as bookends and a rotation in the middle I would say he's more of a 2C/3C solution), really similar to Kruger.

I think I'm going to trust the general manager that navigated through some serious cap fallout in 2010 and has a franchise in the middle of a third Stanley Cup celebration."

hawks,3bofbq,Stillflying,5,Tue Jun 30 21:43:58 2015 UTC,This trade could turn out to be brilliant. The rumor was Pittsburgh was going to offer sheet Saad. But now that is much less likely and they're still looking for a top 6 winger. Kessell is likely staying in Toronto so who does that leave Pittsburgh to go after? Patrick Sharp. Two birds with one stone. If that's what goes down like I think Stan was going for it was a really smart move.

That deal would be underpaying him a year or two into it for fuck's sake.  You don't sign him to a bridge deal. Fuck. He's not someone that the team needs to ""learn more about"" we know what he is, he's proven himself on the biggest stage in the NHL in the playoffs two years in a row now, what else more do you need?

FTA:   “We’ve seen great strides in his game,” coach Todd Richards said. “Just great strides. The power. The physical play. Maybe that’s what opens your eyes with him. But then there’s some skill there, too. A lot of skill. And what I like is the way he’s getting into games and really focusing and digging into them. It means a lot to him.”   “What I like about the kid (Dano) is how he works,” Hartnell said. “He’s not shy. He gets in on guys with no hesitation. He’s making the most of the opportunity, and you can just see his confidence swelling. He looks like a pretty special young man to me. I’m excited to see where this goes.”   This is a tough trade to swallow but there isn't any reason to not trust Bowman recently."

We have to give Bowman the benefit of the doubt. The guy has been at the helm for 3 Stanley Cups.

You've already won two Cups (more than most will ever see), so you can kinda cross that off your bucket list. But you also know every game could bring a season- or career-ending injury. And you also-also know you've got about 15 years in this league before it's time to hang it up. The first two or three of those years you haven't been making superstar kind of money. Now you have a chance to really rack up some dough for the next decade-ish, provided you stay healthy and keep playing well (neither of which is in any way guaranteed). A couple extra million a year add up when you consider how many athletes go bankrupt when their pro careers are over.   In short, in his position, I think many of us would take the extra money if we were really honest about it. It's our beloved team but it's his life/career. If I were offered either 5 million extra monies or a chance to be a slightly more significant part of a dynasty I was already a significant part of ... I'd probably take the money."

Almost certainly what happened is this:  Saad's agent to Bowman: We absolutely will not go lower than X for Y years for Saad. We will have offer sheets from many teams, so if you want my client it is here and now for this price...or you gamble on matching an offer. Bowman: Well, we are already going to be cap/cash strapped next season as it is and while we probably could find some way to afford your client, our safer bet is to trade his rights for players/picks/prospects rather than gamble on being able to match an offer at a price we like or watch Saad walk and get nothing for him. Thanks for your time, we'll miss your client in Chicago, we really wanted him here.  Saad is not a Chicago/Illinois/Blackhawks-fan native and he's been paid (relative to those around him at his level of play) peanuts to play fair large roles in two titles here. Maybe he sees himself as a top-line forward in the next year or two and doesn't want to be stuck behind Kane-Toews. Maybe he simply doesn't care as much about Cups now and just wants to get paid. Remember, if he gets a career-ending injury next season, he has only made about $4 Mil...not a whole lot considering he's got two titles and worked his ass off.  Shame to see him go but bowman knows and knew the value of Saad and clearly he or his agent overvalued him so Bowman instead got what he could. Big bummer, but the offseason is early and this is likely a move Bowman made simply because he had to, not because he wanted to."

The sky's the limit for him.   Chicago got great value for a guy they couldn't afford to resign (Saad). Stan Bowman made out like a 5-star bandit from this trade.

hawks,3bofbq,TheGreenFedora,3,Tue Jun 30 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. That deal was too much to ask for a team paying two guys 10mil/yr (and they're worth it don't forget). Saad has 2 cups, he's now going to a small market team that will pay him the big bucks. Maybe he's happier wiping his ass with c-notes, but I bet he'll look back some day remembering those 2 unforgettable cup winning season and think, ""maybe that extra 2mil/yr wasn't worth it."" So I assume we keep Sharpie? Play him on the first or second line again where he belongs and watch the revival of the Sharp Shooter!"

Now that I've looked at it, I can see some good sides in this. We got Marko Dano who is actually a nice piece to have, might even develop into a similar player what Saader is. And then we got Anisimov, who is a decent pick-up to deepen our forward core, and maybe he can show the ropes to Panarin. Other than that, I'm not too excited.  I would've loved to keep Saader and not take this risk, but this might actually work, too. If everything goes well, we might even end up winning this trade in the long run.

The player decides to sign the offer sheet, then his team is given the option to match the contract and retain their services. If they don't match, the offering team has to give up a selection of their own draft picks (the specific picks depending on the AAV of the contract.)  Also, that's a raw deal on Saad. Great player, but you gotta think StanBo knows what he's doing by this point. At least Dano looks good."

hawks,3bulh8,KCchemist,-1,Thu Jul 2 14:16:06 2015 UTC,Ask any team in desperate need of scoring if getting rid of Saad was a good idea. Everything is relative. I only brought it up for discussion bc I think a raanta darling combo is completely capable. Apparently /r/Hawks fans don't even want to entertain the idea or maybe I'm beating a dead horse. I don't go to this sub often so I apologize if it has been discussed.
hawks,3bulh8,KCchemist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"Hawks will still have plenty of offense after losing Saad.  There are goal scorers all over the league.  There's 30 starting goaltenders, so if you an elite one, you don't let it go."
hawks,3bulh8,KCchemist,3,Thu Jul 2 18:06:20 2015 UTC,I think crow is very good but he's not elite. He's an above avg goalie on an amazing team. He's not putting up elite numbers with arguably the best top 4 defensive pairings in the league. I'm a fan of crow but he's not irreplaceable. I think we're really gonna be kicking ourselves if Saad is the next Seguin

hawks,3bulh8,badseedjr,-10,Thu Jul 2 15:50:55 2015 UTC,"Oh sweet Jesus.  You are aware of what you've just done by even mentioning dumping Crow and his 6 million.  Chelsea Crow Fanboys radar just went off in and around Chicago and they've dropped everything they're doing to come argue and downvote.  Yes.  The answer to your question is yes.  It would have been easier to Trade away Crows 6 million dollar anchor of a contract and rolled with Darling/Raanta(signed at $650k and $575k against the cap next year)and Possibilty of a Leighton next year.  You had 3 teams well below the cap (Edmonton, SJ, and Dallas) who were looking for starting goalies.   The debate over the last couple of months leading  to the Free Agency trainwreck has been ... And I quote all Chelsea Crow Fanboys here ""all we need to do is dump Sharp, Big Dick Bic, and Versteeg and all our cap problems will be solved .... We'll prolly get 3 or 4 1st round picks ... Maybe like 9 second round picks ... For those guys"".  Fast forward to now ... We've lost who I think might be a top 5 to 10 player in this league in a couple of years .... That said, I do like what we have and what we've picked up ... So I'm fine and have moved away from the ledge.  But yes, the answer to your question is yes ... We would have had a better chance at retaining Saad'r if we would have gotten as far away from that 6million dollar contract at the goalie position as possible.  Not a Crow hater ... I don't care which of our would have been 3 goalies at the time were in that 6 million dollar contract ... I would have been fine with the other 2 coming into the role."
hawks,3bulh8,1point-21-jigowatz,6,Thu Jul 2 14:32:33 2015 UTC,"I see you're up to your old ""I'm not a Crow hater, but let me bash him all the time."" narrative.  The answer is not yes, it's ""maybe.""  You're overvauling Saad as much as anyone has ever overvalued Crawford.  Saad had some great parts of his game, but he also had some downfalls, like his passing vision.  Guy never was a setup guy, he jsut hit the blueline and drove hard.  That's great when you're playing with Hossa and Toews, but what about some less skilled guys?  I'm not saying Saad is bad, because he's not, but he's not 6.5 million good like he was rumored to be asking for.  Raanta and Darling had a combined 48 starts in the NHL.  The benefit or loss to losing Crawford and keeping Saad is probably worse than losing Saad, keeping Crawford, and gaining Anisimov and Dano.  Dano was on fire last year and has the same PPG rate as Saad, plus he has way better vision in the offensive zone.  If he keeps up his production as he ended it last year, the kid wall make most fans forget about losing Saad in a year or 2."
hawks,3bulh8,1point-21-jigowatz,0,Thu Jul 2 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"thank you for being somewhat civil in your response.  And we've argued before.  I assure you I do not hate Crow.  I think he makes some amazing saves where other goalies would not and the fella is ALWAYS square to the puck which is important with the butterfly style that was adopted many years ago.  That said, I think Crow is a below average goalie playing the puck and his footwork is sometimes messy(pipe to pipe push offs).  Again, my only negative critique of the guy.  I tossed it out there awhile ago that I don't care who is in that 6 million dollar contract(Raanta, Darling, or Crow) ... I would want to dump it knowing what we have signed at 575 and 650k would more than Be sufficient based on paying for players in front of the goalie.  In regards to Saad'r ... I agree on him not being the best distributor of the puck, but we have to remember he's 22 ... To be as good of a 2 way forward as he is at this age assuming his ceiling is a few years away ... Again, we're assuming he hasn't hit his ceiling ... Lastly, I'm not as freaked out as I was Tuesday afternoon ... I think gaining Asi, Dano, and Tiki on top of Pani is really going to put us in a position offensively to just shake off the loss of Saad'r ... I still think Saad'r is going to be an elite 2 way player in a handful of years."
hawks,3bulh8,badseedjr,2,Thu Jul 2 15:28:17 2015 UTC,I don't really get why you're getting down voted to hell. Crawford has proved his worth. Doesn't necessarily mean it's what the Hawks need or that he's not expendable  though. Niemi proved his worth too and we moved on. Some people saying we'd move on with two inexperienced goalies yet it's what we did going with Crawford after 2010. I like the pieces we got for Saad but I still would rather have Saad. I'm also confused on the immediate extension we gave anisimov at that much money. I would have been content getting a decent prospect and a 2nd rounder for Sharp. Going off an unproductive year and turning 34 I think bowman really overvalued him. Hossa has 2-3 years of really good production left and Saad would have been a great replacement for years to come. What's done is done I guess so we will see.
hawks,3bulh8,jerry200890,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"It's the expected result when commenting on /r/hawks about Crow.  Something tells me if you mentioned trading away Crow and in return we got Gretzky,  Lemieux, roy Bourque, Hull, Messier, Orr, Howe,   Lidstrom, Sakic, Lafleur, Brodeur and Beliveu all in their prime all within the cap and a conditional 2nd round pick ... I think Crow fanboys would still want to veto the trade ... because you know ... Crow won 2 Cups and was robbed of a Con Smyth in '13."
hawks,3bulh8,badseedjr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually opposed to moving Crow for the money save also, but I wouldn't do it just to keep Saad and plug in some very inexperienced guys in the net for a full season load.  There was a rumor of him actually going to WPG for Hutchinson and another D prospect which I think would be fantastic for the money.  I also freaked out at the Saad trade (you can look at my comment history as I first said I'd rather have the picks form an offer sheet, which is silly, so I can understand a reactionary comment.  I know Hutch isn't super experienced, but he got half a seasons load, and freeing up that money, getting a D prospect,and having money to get Oduya back is good enough to cover up Darling and his inexperience.  It is also, unfortunately, as big of a gamble as keeping Saad for Crow."
hawks,3bulh8,jerry200890,0,Thu Jul 2 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"Hah, yeah problems with his vision:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVzVGhlocOI  Saad is really good in every area of the game that is crucial to how the Hawks play, he can play in any situation. And he's just going to get better as time goes on. You can say that the trade might end up being good pending on how Dano pans out and if Anisimov can actually stay healthy for a season, but don't make shit up about so called weaknesses of Saad's game.   Funny how people suddenly have to make up revisionist history in order to make an argument."
hawks,3bulh8,badseedjr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"You showed 1 play.  There are countless plays where he drives in, head down, straight to the net.  I've watched nearly every game since he's been playing.  Just because he can make that pass, doesn't mean he looks for it every time.  Don't imply I'm making shit up when I actually know what I'm talking about.  Saad in no way has the vision of guys like Toews, Kane, or Hossa."
hawks,3bulh8,jerry200890,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah you know so much of what you're talking about you just essentially said that because Saad, 2 and half seasons into his pro career, doesn't yet have the vision of three likely Hall of Famers (of which hardly anyone around the league has, and in the case of Kane, IMO, no one), then it's a weakness for him. Good job."
hawks,3bulh8,badseedjr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"I should know by the username not to indulge, but seriously, I said it's one of his weaknesses.  All players have weaknesses.  I'm not the only one to say Saad has a bit of tunnel vision in his game.  I did, however, forget that your opinion is the only one that matters and you are the end all be all on hockey.  I shouldn't have even replied because I know you will just reply with some snarkey bullshit and continue thinking you know it all."
hawks,3bulh8,jerry200890,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"Dude, because you're not the only who thinks that doesn't mean anything. There were (and still are) plenty of people that think Bollig is a viable NHLer. You could say the same thing for basically anything ever said in making the argument of ""Well I'm not the only one.."".  It's weak.    Fact of the matter is when you say a player doesn't have the vision of Patrick Fucking Kane, and because he doesn't then it's a weakness in his game, you have to start bringing yourself back down to Earth. You're fucking orbiting Mars with hockey thoughts like that. You're waay the fuck out there."

hawks,3bn7rh,thorofasgard,4,Tue Jun 30 17:21:58 2015 UTC,"True, but Stan might be trying to cover his butt just to be safe. But yeah Saad looks legit as they come, aka Future American Hossa."
hawks,3bn7rh,rpgreenmachine4,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:27:30 2015 UTC,I understand your point but Saad is an entirely different play style and what they ask Bickell to do nowadays is much more different than in 2013..
hawks,3bn7rh,MrJonHammersticks,6,Tue Jun 30 18:42:41 2015 UTC,Quibbling over this with Saad just seems stupid to me. Just give him the long deal he wants at a modest AAV before some other team offers him the long deal he wants at likely a higher AAV than what the Hawks would have to pony up if the ink dries today.
hawks,3bn7rh,ChrisPummer,5,Tue Jun 30 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"If I was Saad, I wouldn't take much less than we were paying Sharp the past few years."

hawks,3bn7rh,Vorrigan,3,Tue Jun 30 17:55:09 2015 UTC,"Rumors floating that Saad's deal is basically done, they are just hammering out term.  They are just rumors, but a number of them line up."

hawks,3bn7rh,salparadisimo,2,Wed Jul 1 00:24:03 2015 UTC,What's a bridge deal?
hawks,3bn7rh,SimpleChiGuy,10,Tue Jun 30 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"Ignore me. Should have googled it    A bridge contract is one that is generally short in term, wherein the team pays a player less in his restricted years of free agency, with the idea that the players’ big “pay day” will come in his next contract."
hawks,3bn7rh,SimpleChiGuy,3,Tue Jun 30 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"A short term contract for a smaller amount of money that is suppose to ""bridge"" a player from an entry level contract to his big one. Usually around 2 years. This way a player can get more money if they continue to produce at a level but if they don't then it doesn't really hurt the team."

My first jersey was his. but its just a number that couldn't be done. and unlike everyone who is looking at this through watery eyes, you can see that he was getting offer sheeted first thing tomorrow, and players today when you are in a cap crunch are better than picks next year."
hawks,3bohst,cornyb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:53:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think this was the only thing we could have done. I'm just sad to see him leave. He's a great player and I've loved watching him these past few years. Him and his beard will always have a special place in my heart.
hawks,3bohst,cornyb,2,Tue Jun 30 21:54:44 2015 UTC,exactly. we had no other choices.
hawks,3bohst,_Hamburger_,13,Tue Jun 30 21:55:32 2015 UTC,big jump from 4-5mil. Now i see why stanbo made a trade instead of ending up with an offer sheet

hawks,3bohst,soundlife,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:34:53 2015 UTC,"my bad, 3 and a pick. and I feel JMo will get packaged with bickell maybe. but hey we got kimmo to deal with tivo and look at how much he improved, dano hopefully can do the same for panarin. while there wasn't much we can do, I'd still take it over the picks in 2015.   6 of one half dozen of another, but neither is 12."

hawks,3bohst,Argocap,6,Tue Jun 30 22:08:06 2015 UTC,Because they have a very short career that in most cases needs to support them for the rest of their lives and it can end instantaneously with nothing they can do about it

You stay cozy to the side you're on, but if someone comes up and offers you $6m more than you made last year, you put the money in the bank and run."

hawks,3bohst,drumman44,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He didn't need to say that. He could have said, ""We're going to work hard to get something set, and we hope it can be done,"" and I wouldn't be as bitter about this."
hawks,3bohst,tpschi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:49:20 2015 UTC,Home town discount =\= free compared to what he was offered by someone else.
hawks,3bohst,tpschi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:15:18 2015 UTC,"But he WASN'T offered anything by anyone else at the time -- it't not allowed. I mean, it's clear he WOULD get offered more, but he hadn't received an offer yet. From what it sounds, we lowballed him a bit and he really highballed us. It seems like Stanbo was eagerly willing to negotiate but Saad's agent was not."
hawks,3bohst,_Berns,4,Wed Jul 1 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"Also some team was going to offer him a shit load of money, had to get what we could for him."
hawks,3bohst,_Berns,3,Tue Jun 30 21:32:59 2015 UTC,"I may be heartbroken, but at least Saad is going to a team I really like and respect. That Foligno guy is just great, and Ryan Johanssen is a star. Saad will fit in well there.  It seems my eyes are making water. Somebody call California."

hawks,3bohst,chocolate_chip_kelly,2,Tue Jun 30 22:20:43 2015 UTC,That's the best part of this. I think I'd have literally thrown up if he somehow wound up with Anaheim or some other West team that the Blackhawks play frequently.
hawks,3bohst,djb2287,3,Wed Jul 1 02:49:20 2015 UTC,Then it makes more sense. It still hurts like a bitch tho.
hawks,3bohst,RaveOn1958,5,Tue Jun 30 21:31:45 2015 UTC,At least his greed means that he'll have to play for Columbus.
hawks,3bp394,wjbc,4,Wed Jul 1 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"TL;DR:    The prizes are obviously Artem Anisimov and Marko Dano. In acquiring the two, the Hawks likely solve their second and third line center vacancies that had come into existence with the likely departures of Antoine Vermette and Brad Richards. They get younger down the middle as a result, and bring in a pair of players with arguably more upside."
hawks,3bp394,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Wed Jul 1 00:19:00 2015 UTC,Let me grieve for at least a day!
hawks,3bqzt9,LordPeePerz,5,Wed Jul 1 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"No room for Richards, look at our centers  Toews - Anisimov - kruger - dano - teuvo"
hawks,3bqzt9,ClintEastwood41,2,Wed Jul 1 14:40:02 2015 UTC,Dani and Teuvo don't have to play C though. Or Center core would be better with Richards. I prefer seeing Teuvo at LW but he could make the transition
hawks,3bqzt9,Cartortus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"Isn't Richards a UFA? With Anisimov on board long term, it seems like Richards is gone unless he's willing to play for next to nothing. Still plenty of salary to shed. I don't know how Bowman unloads Bickell and gets anything of value. This is the price of having such a talented team."
hawks,3bqzt9,helpful_shawn_,2,Wed Jul 1 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"I believe Richards is a UFA, but I'm pretty sure hes willing to take a discount to stay with the hawks. How much though is going to be a key.  I guess what I'm really curious about is what we are going to do with Bicks and Sharpy. Those 2 really determine what we can go after in the upcoming days."
hawks,3bqzt9,helpful_shawn_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"It's not going to be easy. The Hawks have no leverage since everyone knows they need to shed salary. I was hoping the Yotes would be a good trading partner since they're shy of the floor, but that Pronger trade was a stroke of genius. I just hope the asking price for Bickell or Sharp isn't so steep that they have to retain them and shed salary elsewhere. I'd hate to see anyone else go."
hawks,3bpsld,leakfrei,4,Wed Jul 1 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"I know this is an older draft profile... But I found it to be an interesting summary on Marko Dano.  Besides this, I like what they are saying about him as the key to this trade on the NHL network.  Let's hope Panarin is also what they say he is... Then the D needs some serious work, as we all expect Oduya to be on the way to the next stop in his career.  I wad thinking that Saad would somehow be part of the main core of this team for the next few years.  But his playoff performance, almost alone, elevated his status to a level too high to be able to afford for the Hawks.  This is the league nowadays... Have to accept it and look forward to the next chapter... Speaking for myself."
hawks,3bpsld,Cavetroll771,5,Wed Jul 1 04:28:24 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more with that last bit. Now that the shock has worn off, I can see the value in this. Im not pleased about losing Saad in the least, but things aren't nearly as bad as they seem. We just gotta trust Stan and move on."
hawks,3bpsld,Coop3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:45:28 2015 UTC,Can we agree on his sub nickname being Marko Dangle?
hawks,3bpsld,Bison66,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping that for maybe a stretch he and Kane play on the same line and Kane sets him up with a picture perfect pass and Dano Scores and Kane just starts screaming ""BOOK EM DANOOOOOOOOOO"""

hawks,3bn8lx,RunningJokes,12,Tue Jun 30 22:52:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'd go any higher in salary retention than the cost of buying out his contract. In that scenario, Boston would have to be providing a good pick/combo of picks or a decent prospect/maybe 4th line player. I just don't want to see us paying him $2 million a year to play in Boston just so we could get rid of him."
hawks,3bn8lx,DrHampants,6,Tue Jun 30 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"Buyout would be $1M in cap space for the next two years and $1.5M in cap space for the two years after that. We'd get nothing in return, however.   If we keep, say $2M but also get picks/prospects in return, that's a better deal."
hawks,3bn8lx,Chorrbs,3,Tue Jun 30 19:02:43 2015 UTC,Plus that $2m only hits us for 2 years instead of 4.
hawks,3bn8lx,rpgreenmachine4,5,Tue Jun 30 20:25:55 2015 UTC,I kind of figured this...I bet they are gonna take the deal that requires the least about of retaining his salary. I am sort of surprised we have yet to do a deal with the Panthers. I feel like Bicks go there.

hawks,3bn8lx,turbo86,2,Tue Jun 30 20:33:58 2015 UTC,I believe that they get to place more against the cap with Pronger's contract than they are actually paying. That's why they made that move.

hawks,3boioh,WikiReddit,18,Tue Jun 30 21:33:53 2015 UTC,Does this also open a possibility to keep Vermette?
hawks,3boioh,STLL217,17,Tue Jun 30 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Anisimov should mean Vermette doesn't get resigned. It looks like Toews, Teuvo, Anisimov, Kruger/Danault."

hawks,3boioh,Cartortus,11,Tue Jun 30 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"Any sort of re-signing of Richards or Vermette is going to come after trading someone, because all things point to there not being a ton of room.  And frankly, I don't care to re-sign them. With the inclusion of Anisimov, we have plenty of options for Center. We dont need Teuvo at he wing; he's defensively good enough for center."
hawks,3boioh,MyNeckHurts,12,Tue Jun 30 21:58:13 2015 UTC,I wanna see Richards at least signed cuz him and Kaner killed. Richards would be cheap and a player who is experienced but still plays well. Seeing a Turbo Richards Kane line would be killer IMO
hawks,3boioh,Cartortus,-10,Tue Jun 30 22:10:36 2015 UTC,"Richards is old and sucked ass half the season. He is cheap though and wouldn't mind retaining him, but wouldn't be sad at all if he left"

hawks,3boioh,djb2287,2,Tue Jun 30 22:18:17 2015 UTC,"No, probably not. Oduya gets an easy 3-4 million with the demand for a good defenseman and a shitty market. And all belief of a hometown discount just got fucking obliterated."

hawks,3boioh,Whatsgoodx,6,Tue Jun 30 22:22:48 2015 UTC,"Agree but I don't think any of those were as big of a surprise when it happened. I don't remember reading any reports saying ""buff/Laad/Niemi/ are our first priority this season. Saad was also younger and developed by us which hurts even more."
hawks,3boioh,djb2287,5,Tue Jun 30 22:38:31 2015 UTC,Niemi was kind of a surprise. I think most thought he would stay but then SJ offered Hammer a big deal and we had to decide on keeping Niemi or Hammer and we went with Hammer.

Anisimov is most likely a 3C, so maybe they'll move dano to wing on the third line with anisimov and shaw, and then maybe versteeg in the top 6 again if we keep him"

hawks,3boioh,Philosopher_King,3,Wed Jul 1 02:22:22 2015 UTC,"Saad was such an important player in our system. He crashed the boards well, played a two way game, and had a deceptively great and quick wrist shot. He played bigger than what he was and was a playoff  performer with us all at the age of 22.   This one hurts us a lot. Don't see who can replace what he did well on our current roster.  Thats not to say we can't fit in a different player and make it work (Pararin) but will be hard to match everything that he brought to the table."
hawks,3boioh,DiggerNicks13,5,Tue Jun 30 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"Re-sign Kruger to a friendly deal. Hopefully less than $3MM AAV. Deal Versteeg and Bickell with no salary retained. Let the other UFAs walk. Keep Sharp!   I haven't ran the numbers since the Saad deal went through, but these steps will work. We maybe able to keep Versteeg after this and do the above, but I'm not sure."
hawks,3boioh,JasonEAltMTG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what I'm hoping for. That will still be a real good lineup. Might even sneak in Richards or by some stroke of luck, Oduya."

His contract is rough, but when you look at the guys who are getting bought out they either have ridiculous cap hits. (ie. Semin at 7m/6yrs) or they player is completely useless and can't be moved because of ability. (ie. Stalberg).  There's a LOT of time before the Hawks have to be cap-compliant, they can and will get something in return even if it's basically a meaningless draft pick."

hawks,3bqzve,IlliniXC,16,Wed Jul 1 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"For me, it was just shocking.    I expected Saader to be with us long term, and when he was gone before Sharp or Bickell it just hit me like a ton of bricks.  I spent the last 3 years completely swooning over him, his speed, his two way play, his intangibles and the fact he's a good Pittsburgh kid (I lived there for 7 years when I was a kid).  But now that I've had 12+ hours to marinate on this (and a few ounces of bourbon helped, of course) I'm seeing this as a positive moving forward.  The team is in a better place financially than they would have been with him signed long term - and who's to say Saader hasn't peaked?  Maybe what we saw last year was it... if it is, he's still a great player, but we can find speed and scoring for less money.    I'll certainly miss him and Hossa on the PK, but hopefully we shore up the defense this year and it's no longer an issue.  I woke up this morning feeling much better about it, and honestly, who says he's not back in the Indian Head 4 or 5 years from now?  Who knows.   Stan is a magician, I'm trusting in his vision.  As far as what the CBJ are up to?  I can't hear them over the sound of 3 cups in 6 years."

hawks,3bqzve,Bickdag,7,Wed Jul 1 13:34:58 2015 UTC,"What else have Blue Jackets fans had to be happy about? We've got three cups in six years and still have a very real chance at more. They don't have much of anything in their franchise's history.  Plus we're probably the most hated team in the NHL now. Success breeds contempt. Let them be, they still have to live in Ohio, isn't that punishment enough?"
hawks,3bqzve,NicCage420,4,Wed Jul 1 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"They got a 22 year old that is an amazing 2 way player. He has been getting better every year. Plus, you have the extra experience of a player being in 2 SCF.   If Dano live up to the hype and Anisimov can do what he has been doing or better. Then we should come out better on this deal. Next season is only going to allow us to answer this question."
hawks,3bqzve,maximumrocker,7,Wed Jul 1 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"Oh well.  I'm sad he's leaving but its not the end of the world.  They probably think it is.  But then, they aren't looking at next season in the reflection of the Stanley Cup."

Chicago is packed with big stars like Kane and Toews, and Saad is exactly what a team like CBJ needed.  He's going to be a big name in the NHL for years to come.  I am bitter about losing him, but I am glad to see that they appreciate what they just got.  I hope he can be the guy to CBJ like what Kane/Toews is to us.    Honestly Columbus is probably one of the best places he could have ended up in my mind if not Chicago."

Saad is an amazing player but his stats might have been inflated playing with Toews and Hossa and I think we made out pretty well. We get a 2/3 center that we desperately need and a promising prospect. I honestly am excited for next season. I always loved watching Anisimov play when he was with the Rangers and CBJ. Joke will be on them when Saad isn't worth that 6.5...but I hope he is for all he did with the Hawks."

hawks,3bixcv,bud1316,4,Mon Jun 29 23:04:16 2015 UTC,I don't think we re-sign him unless we get a discount deal because he wants to stay. I'm fine with slightly overpaying relative to our cap as well for center depth.
hawks,3bixcv,saber1001,2,Mon Jun 29 19:43:50 2015 UTC,"Well, like last year, I guess I'm fine with whatever depending on the cost. Lots of people here were unhappy with the Richards addition because they wanted the Hawks to aim higher, but what did they want for $2 million? And it worked out great.   I just don't want an overpay because not only does it keep the team from adding other depth pieces, if Richards goes full Handzus and falls from solid contributing piece to holding back the second or third line, we might be stuck with that."
hawks,3bixcv,ChrisPummer,9,Mon Jun 29 22:09:23 2015 UTC,"How did the hawks hang onto Zeus for to long? Traded for him at deadline during the 12-13 season, played for them 13-14 season then he was released."
hawks,3bixcv,Ricky___Spanish,4,Mon Jun 29 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"And what NHL team signed him in 2014? Handzus was playing poorly in San Jose, that's why they sent him to Chicago for a 4th rounder. He found another gear and stepped up for the playoffs and that was awesome, but there was no reason to believe he could replicate that level of play for an entire 82 game season plus playoffs.   That became painfully clear in 2013-14 where he was Kane's anchor on the second line. I think Kane finally scored a goal with Handzus on his line, but there was a point in January where he went over 200 minutes on the ice with Handzus without scoring a goal. That's why they hung onto Handzus too long."

The closest city with an NHL team is Montreal, but since that's in Canada and since the Habs are basically the Yankees of the NHL there is no way I am rooting for them. After Montreal, the closest NHL city is more or less a toss up between Buffalo, Boston, and NYC.

hawks,3bkakx,TakesJonToKnowJuan,3,Tue Jun 30 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"This is stressful and I am stressed, but I am sure Bowman will do whatever it takes to get him resigned. I was hoping we'd let Bickell and Sharp go in the draft for some picks, but that didn't happen, but  don't think that's how Stan does business. Saad is an important piece and everyone knows that, but still. STRESS!"
hawks,3bkakx,_Berns,3,Tue Jun 30 05:19:12 2015 UTC,"Coming off a 23-goal, 52-point season, Saad may be pricing himself out of town, another source said, and the threat of an offer sheet is very real. If the Blackhawks feel like they can’t get a deal done, they could try to trade Saad’s rights for a bigger return of NHL players. When asked to put a percentage on Saad being traded or re-signed, the source said “50-50.”   All of these sources are just using Zawaski for press leverage against Saad's agent.  Up to this point it has just been Bowman saying he will sign Saad, making him seem desperate and to take any deal.  Now its out there that the Blackhawks are willing to move him if he asks too much.  Nothing to see here, just typical press manuevers on both sides trying to get some public leverage."
hawks,3bkakx,ViagraAndSweatpants,2,Tue Jun 30 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"I doubt we actually wanna sign him to a bridge deal, he's proven what he can do, but then again if Subban signs a bridge deal then it's possible for any young talent to sign one as well. But at the end of the article he says ""From conversations I’ve had, I’m confident Saad will be back with the Blackhawks. It’s just a matter of how much and for how long."""
hawks,3bkakx,LouChainz88,4,Mon Jun 29 23:24:35 2015 UTC,The biggest reason to sign him to a bridge deal is to reduce the cap hit for a couple years. It has nothing to do with proving himself.

hawks,3bkakx,mikerhoa,3,Tue Jun 30 02:46:36 2015 UTC,"Is like the Hawks to gamble and offer Saad a longer deal. By adding more years and front-loading it so he gets more present-day value, they can lock him up through his prime at a very low cap hit."

hawks,3bkakx,Gobyinmypants,2,Tue Jun 30 00:48:20 2015 UTC,"Not only that I don't think we could afford a heavily front loaded deal anyway with the shape our cap is in, especially if it's gonna pay out over $20 mil total..."
hawks,3bkakx,mikerhoa,2,Tue Jun 30 02:34:42 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if the deal is front loaded or end loaded, the cap hit is the average annual value for each year of the contract."

I remember them saying something like they were losing money in spite of the success and it was going to affect the player payroll. I'll have to dig around for the article(s)...  EDIT: Maybe not, the only articles I'm locating don't quite say that. Only this one mentions the money troubles, but it doesn't explicitly say that it would affect the payroll.

Stan probably wants to give him $4M for two years, but Brandon is probably seeking something more like $4.5-5M for four years. I doubt money is the big issue. It's more likely that length and his agent are a factor. I hope they meet in the middle."

hawks,3biqmd,BlueLineMenace,5,Mon Jun 29 16:22:10 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, yes. That being said, they still haven't gotten him a qo yet, and I believe he'll become a ufa after 5:00 if they don't, which would mean someone else could sign him and we wouldn't even get the compensation. Not good."
hawks,3biqmd,djb2287,3,Mon Jun 29 17:12:50 2015 UTC,Correct. Saad doesn't have to sign it.

hawks,3biqmd,nofx1510,0,Mon Jun 29 20:26:36 2015 UTC,No cuz if we drop them to waivers we take the cap hit. The biggest reason for trading them is to free up cap space so we can keep guys like Saad.
hawks,3biqmd,LouChainz88,5,Mon Jun 29 21:21:46 2015 UTC,We have 7.1 million free right now plus we can go 10 percent over the total cap (another 7ish million) during the offseason. We don't have to dump anyone right now. Just have to be under the cap by the start of the season.

hawks,3bk5nb,electrictaters,3,Mon Jun 29 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"Sure.  So, when a player first enters the league, they are given an ELC. From the time they start until they're 27 or after their 7th season, they are considered restricted free agents. This means that if another team wants to sign those players, they would have to compensate the other team with picks.  To make sure they keep this status, however, teams must submit qualifying offers- where the players are given one year deals based on what they previously earned. If the team doesn't submit these offers before the deadline, then the player is considered an unrestricted free agent and allowed to sign with anyone, and the player's previous team isn't given any compensation."

I'm not sure exactly how they did the whole line thing though, since I skipped the parade and walked up to a line coming out of the gym (you took some nice pics at the parade btw).  At the time I walked by, I didn't even see a line extending to the field by the porta-poties so I must have come after they dispersed everyone.  They didn't have anyone by the back of the line turning anyone away either.  Or anyone asking to see tickets before entering.  And inside wasn't any better with the lines.  Once all the pleasantries with Darling was done (street naming, congratulations, etc), the lines inside were a mess.  Tbh, I don't even think I was supposed to be in the line I ended up in (vip)...  I am very greatful that I got a signed poster and pic with the cup, but I definitely felt bad for those they left out because of how unorganized the lines were inside and out of the gym."

He was a finalist for the Hobey Baker award his last season there when it seemed like he had a goal a game.  He has a lethal slapshot (at least on the college level) and was one of our few bright spots on the power play.  He can skate well and has a mean streak (started a whole bunch of fights and even got suspended by the NCAA for a game because of it.  That being said, he isn't a great defender.

Wicked shot, especially through traffic.  Did a great job during the preseason, but got stuck in the AHL because of our winger depth. Did a good job there, but not a monster job. Still probably a year or two out from seeing NHL depending on development and your depth.  But he has a huge potential, so mold him with care. I can see middle 6, maybe top 6. Needs a bit more muscle.  EDIT: here's a highlight reel from his senior year at RPI"
hawks,3bbvpi,irishguy42,8,Sat Jun 27 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"Would be tough to break into the top six for the Hawks with how much depth they've got, but that's exactly how Q seems to like to play things. Spread the talent out and make the match-ups turn in your favor."

hawks,3bbvpi,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,11,Sun Jun 28 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Undrafted guy that really turned it on in college.  Winger that shows a lot of goal scoring potential. However, his ceiling seems to be 3rd line per the reports I've read. He's by no means a sure thing to break the NHL, but I see this as a depth move on offensive prospects. Haggerty is only 22 so he can be added to the group of Baun, Panerin, Hartman, McNeil, and others, which should grab a couple spots on the roster as Versteeg, Sharp, and Bickell are probably gone."
hawks,3bbvpi,DiggerNicks13,6,Sat Jun 27 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Not every guy can be a top line talent, but even getting a talent that can score on a 3rd line is fine with me.

I don't really see you guys going for him anymore though. It seems you are rebuilding, and I don't see Sharp as being that relevant by the time you guys are set for another cup run. I think the idea for Sharp will be to give some contender a 30 goal scorer for the next couple of years.   I could be way off though."

hawks,3bby39,HTWC,0,Sat Jun 27 20:08:17 2015 UTC,To actually answer your question sharpie can probably be had very cheaply. Couple prospects or maybe a future pick or two. We need to offload that contract soon.
hawks,3bby39,jazzcigarettes,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:11:58 2015 UTC,That was roughly what I was thinking.  You guys need to move his contract.  It's high and he's on the decline at the back end of his career.
hawks,3bby39,ClintEastwood41,4,Sat Jun 27 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"I think last year was a fluke. He was old Sharp-shooter until he got hurt and then just never really got back on track. With an offseason to heal and prepare and a new team/city to impress, expect 2013 numbers. He's younger than Hoss and Hoss is still relevant. Rumors of Sharp's demise are greatly exaggerated."
hawks,3bby39,ChrisPummer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:58:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I can't imagine we'll be asking much. I think Stanbo went into the draft figuring if he can sell high on sharpie fine but if he didn't get a great offer wait and see what you can get rather than make a panic trade.
hawks,3bby39,orionus,3,Sun Jun 28 02:35:03 2015 UTC,"I think the Hawks are going to have to settle for a young winger and a future draft pick, nobody is desperate for Sharp and they know we HAVE to trade him so we don't have any advantage in negotiations."
hawks,3bby39,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,4,Sat Jun 27 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"The Hawks have to trade him, and if only one team wanted Sharp, they could conceivably wait until the Hawks give him away for nothing. But more than one team likely wants him. So the team that wants him most will have to pay more than the other teams.   Will that ultimately be less than Bowman and Hawks fans would like? Maybe. Just because it didn't happen at the draft doesn't mean there's not a market.   I think whatever team wants him would be smart to move on it before a lot breaks loose in free agency. Teams probably aren't valuing draft picks in next year's draft as highly as the picks this weekend, both because of the assumed depth this year and the sting of giving up that asset being much farther in the future. And any team that can't otherwise find a scorer on the FA market or in trade might join the fray and drive demand up.  I still maintain Sharp should be very appealing because despite his age, he's still good, he's relatively cheap and only signed for two years. That's got to be worth something to not have to swallow a bigger contract with much more money and many more years."

hawks,3bbyvn,jacksonvstheworld,9,Sat Jun 27 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"Ehh... it goes both ways.  I've been a long time lurker of reddit before I decided to join a couple of years ago and I realize that the bandwagon has really increased, specially this year. (Which I have no problem with. The more the merrier)  The problem with that is that a lot of Hawks fans tend to downvote stuff critical of the Hawks.  We pretty much take over reddit hockey when we want to. Sometimes,  I see  things that should be discussed in /r/hawks spills over to /r/hockey and I just shake my head.  I don't condone the people in /r/hockey downvoting us but man, sometimes we do look like dumbasses on that sub.  Hell... sometimes people post things here that has no content or discussion and I'm always tempted to delete them because it's on the sub rules.   But I don't... since it's summer and I don't want an angry mob thinking this sub as a dictatorship"

hawks,3bbyvn,atikatothesea,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Put yourself in their shoes. I don't blame them for wanting to see another team win the cup. It has to be annoying/ boring to see us or the Kings in the final.   I know every teams subreddit will be a bit of a circlejerk, but I believe we sometimes take it too far. Especially with the new NHL 16 cover. Guys, that cover blows. They could have taken the time to  make it look pleasing to the eye, or at least give another hawks player a chance.    I never had a bad time or felt harrased on /r/hockey. Chirping another team is all in good fun and should never be taken personally."

hawks,3bb3fn,LTComedy,10,Sat Jun 27 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"Worst case scenario.  Double offer sheets to Kruger and Saad. We let them go because we can't dump salary. Next year's bottom 6 is all ELC rookies. Oduya signs elsewhere so its Keith, Seabrook,  Hjammer, TvR and a prayer on defense."

hawks,3bb3fn,chocolate_chip_kelly,15,Sat Jun 27 17:29:57 2015 UTC,Rookies are rookies. While we may be high on the kids in Rockford history shows Q usually isn't.  You get too many at once and you can't exactly protect them.
hawks,3bb3fn,BlueLineMenace,0,Sat Jun 27 17:51:12 2015 UTC,TVR was a rookie last year too
hawks,3bb3fn,ClintEastwood41,2,Sat Jun 27 18:33:57 2015 UTC,Everyone was a rookie once. Doesn't mean it's a good idea to have them all playing at the same time. The question was worst case scenario.  That is it IMO.
hawks,3bb3fn,BlueLineMenace,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:38:26 2015 UTC,TVR earlier in the year was routinely paired with a veteran. This next year it's very possible they'll need to pair two rookies together.
hawks,3bb3fn,jmr33090,9,Mon Jun 29 14:16:02 2015 UTC,"Kruger and Saad both hit FA. Saad gets offer sheeted but I guess by then Stan would have completely unloaded Bicks and Sharp for free.   I'm not sure whether Kruger is an RFA anymore, unfortunately I don't think he is so if he hits FA I highly doubt he comes back but who knows?"
hawks,3bb3fn,MartindalexC,5,Sat Jun 27 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"Kruger is an RFA.  Worst case scenario is that guys start getting unloaded for next to nothing, meaning very low round picks next year, or junk prospects in return.  There's still some hope with Sharpie as the Forward FA market that opens Wednesday is horrible.  If teams aren't getting the signings they want there may be some urgency by them then to make a move.  Bickell and Steeg are likely guaranteed to be dumps if/when they move (they pretty much always were though)."
hawks,3bb3fn,MidgetLovingMaxx,3,Sat Jun 27 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"Oh thank god. I would really be sad if I had to see Kruger be forced to walk away from the team.   But yea, that's probably what's going to happen if Sharp can't be moved today / tomorrow. Bowman qualifies both Saad and Kruger and then has a fire sale with Sharp / Bickell / Versteeg once FA begins."
hawks,3bb3fn,MartindalexC,9,Sat Jun 27 15:13:05 2015 UTC,"Kruger concerns me honestly long-term.  He's the type of player that so many fans say is a dime a dozen and no big deal if they don't manage to re-sign, but he's huge in terms of possession play and in having Q's trust.  Then you look at the market right now, and you see someone who was just like that years ago in Frolik, who went to an offensively-challenged team, broke out as a versatile forward, and is about to get somewhere in the $4-5mm/yr range on the FA market."
hawks,3bb3fn,MidgetLovingMaxx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:21:56 2015 UTC,Well I don't think Kruger has the offensive flair that Frolik has. Sure Kruger can pop up now and then with a goal but he's a fantastic penalty killer and at best a 3rd liner. On the other hand Frolik has been able to put up very decent numbers while playing on the 1st/2nd lines of Winnipeg. (Personally I don't know what the lines are in Winnipeg and how he slots in throughout their entire lineup)
hawks,3bb3fn,MartindalexC,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:12 2015 UTC,"5 seasons ago, I don't think many would have said much else about Frolik either.  He was dabbled into the 1/2 lines for the Hawks at times and looked un-spectacular.  For the Hawks he had: 9 points in 2011 15 points in 2012 10 points in 2013  He moved to the Jets and scored 42 in each of the last two seasons.  Opportunity to go out and play (regularly, not blendered-in) with solid talent with more minutes shows things you don't see when you're slotted into a roleplayer position.  I'm not saying Kruger is a top line guy on most teams, but he's potentially top 6 on more than a few."
hawks,3bb3fn,MidgetLovingMaxx,3,Sat Jun 27 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"And he was a 20 goal scorer on the panthers playing on the 1/2 line. Difference being Q threw him into a 3/4 defensive checking role, and his offensive abilities were not put to good use. If you were surprised he excelled in the 1/2 slot with with WPG you weren't paying attention."
hawks,3bb3fn,myslavename,2,Sat Jun 27 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"The Hawks won't have to let go of Saad or Kuger. They have until the beginning of the season to be cap compliant. The worst case is they don't get the haul they wanted for any of those guys, but somebody will want Sharp for something, and someone else will probably decide they can use Bickell or Versteeg for just taking the contract.   All of these guys will be more attractive next week when free agent musical chairs begins and the thin market drives prices up."
hawks,3bb3fn,ChrisPummer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"If I'm not entirely wrong, we can only go 10 % over the cap in the summer. So trading Sharp would be great before signing Saad and Krugs."
hawks,3bb3fn,DwayneSmith,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:40:03 2015 UTC,Great but not necessary. It would help to know how much they have to work with for veteran free agent roster fillers and be able to pull the trigger on those minor deals.

It was my first season, was home sick (I'm in Australia) and my friend from chicago wasn't paying attention to me because ""the lockout is finally over, be quiet woman!"".  So I said ""fine give me a link to this stupid hockey.""  and was hooked.  First season, seemed like an absolute fairy tale season.  I was naive enough to think that good guys always win so even when we were down 3-1 to Detroit I was still talking about how the hawks were gonna take the series.  It was an absolutely amazing season to have as your first.  Not sure they can ever top it."

hawks,3b9n0k,rctrickysnappss,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:59:12 2015 UTC,I started watching game 5 of that series. Was playing a hockey game with a friend and asked how the hawks were doing( i played them in nhlpa93 and knew of roenick and belfour) and hes like oh theyre about to be eliminated. So i had to start watching. Thank you streaming sites
hawks,3b9n0k,ChrisAshtear,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't miss a single game that season. That team was so much fun to watch. They were virtually unstoppable. It's funny. I got super negative when we went down 3-0 to Vancouver in 2011. I wrote them off. Then they forced a game 7. I knew after that that I could never question this team's resiliency. So, fast forward to late May '13, we go down 3-1 to Detroit. And I knew that we weren't done. Then, I poured over game results from the lockout shortened season. I don't know if people know this or not, but that season, there was never one time that we lost four of seven in any given stretch of games. Not once. I never doubted that team; that team was the juggernaut. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be '13."

The roller coaster of emotions in that game were so much that thinking about it gives me the chills.   From thinking its going to game 7 in the last 2 minutes to scoring a goal to tie it up, another to take the lead.. Then raising the cup. Can't beat that in my book.   All of them are amazing tho. We have a great team."
hawks,3b9n0k,Chicagoiscool,2,Sat Jun 27 04:19:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you. In 2010 the Hawks had the lead with 4:30 left in the game, then gave up a goal. They went from winning the cup to the possibility of a game 7. Then Kane nets the Stanley Cup winner for the Hawks, which hadn't happened in a lot of people's lifetimes. I agree that 17 seconds was absolutely incredible to see. It was great. However, no emotion comes close to the first time.  I'll also say that this last time, as awesome as it was, did feel a little bit less amazing. Winning it at home has got to feel great for the players, though."
hawks,3b9n0k,_Caltoru_,4,Sat Jun 27 08:07:01 2015 UTC,"2013 was the most emotional for me.  Going down 3-1 to Detroit, coming all the way back, that Hjalmarsson disallowed goal tore me apart. Thank God for Seabrook.   Then I was really worried about that Boston team, I feared them much more than the Flyers in '10 and the Bolts this year. So many ups and downs. If we don't steal game 1 at home in that series we go down 3-0. If we don't have that miraculous 6-5 OT road win in game 4, we go down 3-1. Then 17 seconds happened, and for me that was the topper of it all.   This year was amazing too, but I think we all knew deep down that THIS TEAM wasn't going to lose the cup final. Even after going down 2-1 I had no doubts. As much adversity as we've overcome through the years, I knew these players were simply way too good to let that opportunity slip away."
hawks,3b9n0k,SilkyJohnson72,2,Sat Jun 27 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, 2013 for me too. The thing that sticks most was Seabrook going into the box to talk to the captain in the Detroit series. I thought it turned the series. Then Seabrook later with the rocket from the point after the disallowed goal. Then Boston and 17 seconds, lots of emotion in that run."
hawks,3b9n0k,atikatothesea,0,Sun Jun 28 06:59:12 2015 UTC,That is the greatest point in the last 6 years for me. Why Keith has the A over seabs is beyond me. Hope he gets the Sharpie A. The locker room says the only one that's looked up to more than seabs is captain serious.

I committed to watching every game I could.  I streamed every game that wasn't on nbc/nbcsn.  It was shitty quality, but I was there, watching every game like it was the playoffs.  My first son was born in September, so I had a little hockey buddy to hang out with (he's totally a fan).  I was in grad school, and gave so much of my free (and not free) time to that team.  I ordered  my first jersey moments after Kaners hat trick. I didn't jump on at the playoffs like the first cup, I was there from day 1.  When they won, I knew I had earned the celebration, the pure joy of the moment.    I couldn't watch the team as often as I would have liked this season.  Living out of market, new job, a kid, it gets hard.  But, I swear to god, that win was better than my first born son being born.  I had never been that over come with emotion, with pure joy.  I was laughing, I was crying, I was shotgunning beers.  I was watching alone, but I felt like, in that moment, I was celebrating with every Blackhawks fan.  I love my family, but I honestly don't know if anything can top that feeling  TLDR: #3 was the best"
hawks,3b9n0k,ThrillHouse85,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:02:34 2015 UTC,The second was the greatest for me. The first I only watched maybe half of the regular season. 2013 was just so intense.

Every team not named the Blackhawks got on a conference call before the draft and made a pact not to trade for Sharp so we are forced to keep him.

Pretty much a lock to go to Notre Dame.  Guess Bowman liked what he saw the few times I spotted him at The Edge.  edit: regarding Gilbert getting caught occasionally being a de facto fourth forward, the Steel did fire their coach mid-season, and I didn't really notice those issues much after that, so that might have been a contributing factor."

hawks,3b94vy,baileath,5,Fri Jun 26 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"So I went today on a whim, thoughts below.  People are fucking insane, both those shopping and those pricing.  Blank jerseys were right around $150-250, not terrible. But all the named jerseys were $300 and up, with Tuevo, Darling, and Raanta all $600+. Essentially if they got called up once, you were paying a pretty penny.   There was a small cart with gloves and helmets, managed to snag some broken in 15"" reebok gloves for $45.  Sticks were kind of a mess, They had 3 bins, certain players in each bin, including new and used. Tuevo, Cuminskey were $150/stick new/used. Dahlbeck was $100, and misc unnammd used/new sticks in the $75 bin.  Managed to get a game used Tuevo Stick, ""Dahlbeck"" Reebok Ribcor, and 15"" gloves all for $270.  As for the experience, unless I am one of the first 5 people in, I probably would just avoid it. People just grabbed 2, 3, 4 of everything then huddle in corners. Most stuff ended up on EBAY before people even checked out. People would over spend and have to put stuff back and stuff would constantly just reappear randomly. We stayed for about 2 hours total, almost left because I wasn't about to spend $500 on a Tuevo practice jersey, that was not signed."
hawks,3b94vy,nickedagain,2,Sat Jun 27 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"I went too, and your experience was very similar to mine. I was farther back in line, and in the swarm for the jerseys you almost had to quickly flip through and grab one that you would be willing to buy, so you didn't get shut out of anything that interested you. My mother wanted a jersey (and ended up with a game warn Svedberg alternate) but we split up to go through all the racks quicker. I almost bought a jersey myself, but I couldn't justify dropping $550-$700.   I think things would be a lot better if they published the prices of the jerseys ahead of time (and what they had), and maybe limit number of jerseys per customer so they all don't end up on eBay. Hopefully that would mean less of a scramble once the doors opened.   I did buy a couple of pucks (only $2) and a scarf that was normally $25 for $10, but I got out of there by 11:30."

But I'm not sure why they don't keep Hamilton under those circumstances unless they just didn't think they'd be able to work out a long-term deal there."

But it is the way of the world so to speak and nothing is forever. I think a lot of people are looking at this as the start of our downfall. Well, just remember, teams are built on draft picks as well. Before any trades go down we have more picks this year than Minnesota, Dallas, St Louis and Colorado. Nashville is tied with us and only Winnipeg has more picks (1) than us this year. With a little luck, some proper asset management and continued development of our own players like TvR and TT we are in pretty good shape and have every reason to be optimistic. So if Sharp leaves us, let us never ""boo"" him but continue to enjoy our success."

Craw is at an all-time sell high considering his playoff performance and goalie market this offseason. Considering the Hawks have arguably the best backup goalie situation in the league, backs against the cap wall, and roster spots to fill...Crawford needs to go. The drop off (if any) from Craw to our backups doesn't even come close to justifying the 5+ million in added cap hit"

hawks,3b750h,redbluegreenyellow,8,Fri Jun 26 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"Most Hawks fans? I would hope that most Hawks fans can understand the wisdom of paying a goalie with two Cups a salary that (surprise!) is a pretty much spot-on match for his stats and performance level and will be a steal in a couple of years instead of cutting him loose and praying that one of our two wonderful and talented but untested backups will prove to have the same kind of resilience and reliability over the course of a full season and Cup run that we'd throw out the window with a Crawford trade.  And if they prove to be that level of goalie, what kind of shitty cheapo contract do you think the team is going to be able to retain them for when their time to re-sign comes (very soon), and for how long will we get them at that bargain basement rate? Or do we just cut them loose too once they have some succeess with us and keep playing goalie roulette for eternity?"
hawks,3b750h,viiixiii,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:50:45 2015 UTC,The only way I see the Hawks trading Crow is if we are desperate to resign Seabrook which isn't for another 1 or 2 seasons

hawks,3b750h,ClintEastwood41,6,Fri Jun 26 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"I do not want Raanta to get traded. I honestly think he's better than Darling, and should be considered Chicago's Goalie of the Future. Yes, Darling played better this year. However, when Raanta had to come in when Crawford was injured last year, he was fantastic. He played his nuts off when he was starting every game in a, what, one-month period? His play only dropped off when he was getting one start every 3 weeks. He needs to play consistently to be good, and I think that's a pretty good thing for a goalie.  I like Darling, I do, but I think he gives up way too many rebounds, which Raanta has much less of a problem with."
hawks,3b750h,ThirdTimesAnAlt,3,Fri Jun 26 20:41:02 2015 UTC,Unless someone really overpays for Scott Darling the only one I can see moving is Antti Raanta.  I don't see that happening though.
hawks,3b750h,rblumenfeld76,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Crawford has a NTC, we definitely don't want to get rid of Darling, and we need Raanta for the Ice Hogs and as a possible backup.  Given that we're trying to shed weight instead of pick it up right now, I'm not really sure what anyone could offer us that would be worth it except for a full iron-clad defensive line made entirely of prospects that would be happy making the league minimum for a few years.  EDIT:  Also, I just saw that both Lehner and Legwand went to BUF for pick #21...is that really a great return?"
hawks,3b750h,ChronicBitRot,3,Fri Jun 26 15:34:02 2015 UTC,Buffalo fans seem to think they got burned.
hawks,3b750h,Weesc0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:44:49 2015 UTC,Depends on which goalie and the offer really....it isn't something I think the Hawks should pursue unless they're trading the right goalie for the right return.
hawks,3b750h,KCchemist,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"Bowman already stated without a doubt Crawford is going nowhere.    Darling just got a new contract recently, so he'll stick around, especially after his work against the preds.  That is, unless that upped his trade value?  Raanta, eh, maybe.  Won't get much for him."
hawks,3b750h,LeagueMinimum,0,Fri Jun 26 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"The hawks have no goalies in the pipeline, so I'm not sure it makes sense to trade one at this point."
hawks,3b750h,ClintEastwood41,2,Fri Jun 26 15:21:37 2015 UTC,We have:  Crawford  Darling  Raanta  Leighton
hawks,3b750h,mikewitt,3,Fri Jun 26 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"Leighton will be UFA on July 1st. I also don't see him ever making it (back) up to the NHL. He's a great AHL goalie, but I don't think he can cut it in the NHL, except maybe on one of the bottom-dwelling teams--he's just too old to improve at this point.  Personally, I'm hopeful Rockford gives him a contract, but only time will tell what happens."
hawks,3b750h,helpful_shawn_,-3,Fri Jun 26 16:27:30 2015 UTC,"If no one is biting on the other contracts that need to be unloaded, I don't think it's unreasonable to float Crawford for cap relief as a last-ditch effort. That's pretty much not going to happen, though."
hawks,3b750h,1point-21-jigowatz,4,Fri Jun 26 15:37:26 2015 UTC,Oh sweet Jesus.  The trade Crow radar just went off for many fanboys.  They've dropped everything and are b-lining it to your post to downvote you.  Oh the humanity!  Move along fanboys.  There is nothing to see here.  Move along.
hawks,3b750h,helpful_shawn_,5,Fri Jun 26 19:12:56 2015 UTC,These are probably the same meatheads that think teams are going to be knocking down Stan Bowman's door to give a high pick/top prospect to take on Bryan Bickell's contract.
hawks,3b9csa,Gobyinmypants,17,Sat Jun 27 01:15:47 2015 UTC,It could be a first for next year..........
hawks,3b9csa,Tornsys,2,Sat Jun 27 02:07:20 2015 UTC,"Woke up this morning and realized that Stan rarely trades for picks instead of prospects. Only one that comes to mind was the Hawks trading up to pick Nick Schmaltz before the Blues did seeing as St  Louis has the older Schmaltz in their organization. (That's not to say he has not traded players for picks)  Prospects traded for (off the top of my head) Victor Stalberg, Nick Leddy, Jeremy Morin, Jimmy Hayes, Ville Pokka,"
hawks,3b9csa,Tornsys,9,Sat Jun 27 12:39:21 2015 UTC,really worried that we might trade him for basically nothing now
hawks,3b9csa,ClintEastwood41,5,Sat Jun 27 02:12:18 2015 UTC,That's probably what is going to happen. There is no incentive for any teams to help us. It's going to be like the Leddy trade again
hawks,3b9csa,GuyOnTheLake,7,Sat Jun 27 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the return isn't the important part. It's only there to sweeten the deal. The Hawks desperately need to clear cap space."
hawks,3b9csa,MyNeckHurts,2,Sat Jun 27 02:18:59 2015 UTC,"Like how Leddy did. Teams know they can wait us out. We need to sell, and fast. Otherwise, the value just keeps going down"
hawks,3b9csa,amdrummer90,0,Sat Jun 27 02:15:55 2015 UTC,I was thinking Boston moving their cap space for him but nope
hawks,3b9csa,nomad_mali,6,Sat Jun 27 12:08:02 2015 UTC,I don't see it happening. Pretty disappointed we haven't been able to get any deals done yet but I trust in Stan
hawks,3b9csa,LifeUhhhFindsAWay,3,Sat Jun 27 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think he will fetch a first because:  -he's aging  -he seems to be on the decline  I would love a 1st, but I think that asking price is a bit too high for teams that are interested in him. I think he gets traded tomorrow for another 2nd round pick."

hawks,3b0puk,wazoo3,2,Thu Jun 25 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"There is no way that THIS is the actual cover.  I have been playing EA games for 15+ years.  They will put them both on the cover, but it will be incredibly touched up.  Look at the two covers they were already on:  http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/kotaku/2009/06/eacover_nhl10.jpg  https://hockeysfinest.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/nhl_11_frontcover_large_ttcijuiosxreis81.jpg"
hawks,3b0puk,Siggy778,2,Thu Jun 25 05:01:50 2015 UTC,Well it's not like they released a beta cover or something. That's what they said will be the cover. If it was a mockup then they wouldn't have announced it as the cover.
hawks,3b0puk,_TroyMcClure,11,Thu Jun 25 08:16:19 2015 UTC,Agh. Beat me to it. I JUST WISH THE NHL GAMES WERE AVAILABLE ON PC.

hawks,3b0puk,teddyp89,4,Thu Jun 25 01:13:09 2015 UTC,"Let's keep it real here, it's a shitty cover.  If they wanted to put the Hawks on there, put a shot of Duncs on there.  Loving the hate on /r/hockey though."

hawks,3b0puk,RouseHouse1013,2,Thu Jun 25 12:39:14 2015 UTC,I was really hoping they'd but Keith on the cover.
hawks,3b0puk,AndrewActionJackson,2,Thu Jun 25 14:09:29 2015 UTC,Looks like they took a picture of kane and toews holding the cup by themselves then just cut off their arm and smashed them together
hawks,3b0puk,Spawner105,2,Thu Jun 25 15:02:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe they were just announcing the athletes? I love the Blackhawks and really stoked we got the cover again, but could they at least make it not look like shit?

hawks,3b0puk,warhawkguy,2,Thu Jun 25 15:57:09 2015 UTC,I mean I understand why people would be upset about this but with what this team has done in recent years these two really should be on the cover.
hawks,3b0puk,Love_Freckles,2,Thu Jun 25 04:51:33 2015 UTC,Go Hawks

hawks,3b0puk,ethanolin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:32:49 2015 UTC,i agree. it looks like they rushed the cover which gives me little hope for the game itself.
hawks,3b0puk,friendrix1,-1,Fri Jun 26 00:39:11 2015 UTC,Just when I stopped caring about the cover of this game they pull me right back in
hawks,3b3rg8,GuyOnTheLake,5,Thu Jun 25 18:54:23 2015 UTC,So that leaves the Caps and who else?
hawks,3b3rg8,Cartortus,7,Thu Jun 25 19:13:57 2015 UTC,The Penguins were said to be pretty interested
hawks,3b3rg8,cornyb,3,Thu Jun 25 19:48:34 2015 UTC,Hockey at noon talked about the oilers. These two teams out makes me think the asking price ( not that bs one) is too much. Maybe the oilers are willing to give up the 16th overall for him.   Just a theory.
hawks,3b3rg8,OG-buddha,3,Thu Jun 25 21:13:52 2015 UTC,16th would be great! is it just a straight trade 16th for Sharp or do they want Sharp and a prospect or are we gonna get a prospect
hawks,3b3rg8,Cartortus,5,Thu Jun 25 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"They were just talking how it would be a great fit for them. Having a proven winger that has hella playoff experience will help these young guys/mcdavid.  It depends on who's available for them I guess. They need a good defensemen, would they rather draft and wait, or get a proven free agent."
hawks,3b3rg8,OG-buddha,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:52:01 2015 UTC,"Not so sure. Trade terms are negotiable after all. It just depends where the teams see their chief needs. I see him more going to Edmonton, Calgary or any other low playoff berth team or team on verge of breaking out. Dallas needs more D than O. Florida needs a bit of everything and were contenders but they need more youth not experience"
hawks,3b3rg8,nameless22,4,Thu Jun 25 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"Just going off their discussion. They're not insiders either, just talk, like this."
hawks,3b3rg8,OG-buddha,2,Thu Jun 25 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, the more this crap comes out the harder it will get for us to get a good return for Sharp.  I hope we don't end up with something like a 4th round pick for him."
hawks,3b3rg8,ClintEastwood41,2,Fri Jun 26 00:49:17 2015 UTC,"Man I was hoping the Sens would be interested, I thought they were looking for another top 6 forward and I'd be able to go see Sharp a few hours away. This waiting is excruciating... just pull the trigger already Stanbo"
hawks,3b3rg8,yorozuyajin-chan,-13,Thu Jun 25 23:55:19 2015 UTC,Kinda glad the Panthers are out.  I'd hate for Sharpie to go suffer on that shit team.
hawks,3b3rg8,KCchemist,17,Fri Jun 26 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"They were a pretty decent team this past year, I wouldn't be surprised to see them in the playoffs this year"
hawks,3b3rg8,Aperture-Employee,15,Thu Jun 25 18:56:22 2015 UTC,They were fighting for a playoff spot until the very last month. They're going to be very good soon.
hawks,3b3rg8,OG-buddha,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"It was the last two weeks that decided it for em. They lost to the sens twice and bruins once.. Put their season to rest but still look good, and young!"
hawks,3b3rg8,Athilda,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:59:36 2015 UTC,The Panthers hurt Kane. Fuck them.
hawks,3b3rg8,Aperture-Employee,4,Thu Jun 25 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"It was a freak accident, basically the least intentional injury possible."
hawks,3b3rg8,Athilda,0,Fri Jun 26 01:50:19 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I am still upset about it."
hawks,3b3rg8,shrederick,3,Fri Jun 26 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why? Kane getting injured allowed StanBo to get Vermette and Timonen at the deadline. In a way, his injury played a decent role in this recent Cup win. Obviously you don't want star players injured like that, but I don't think it could've worked out much better."
hawks,3b3rg8,Athilda,0,Fri Jun 26 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"It's helpful to look back and see the results like this, of course.  Still.  I don' recollect it being a freak hit, either. So, maybe I'm just warped."
hawks,3b3rg8,_kill-fx_,14,Fri Jun 26 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"Pirri, Hayes, Bolland, Campbell, and Kopecky. so many former hawks on that team.  plus they have luongo and jagr.  they have a real good team that could easily contend."
hawks,3b3rg8,Queen_LaQueefah,4,Fri Jun 26 14:03:10 2015 UTC,You could really see a difference in their play when Jagr got there. He must have done something to liven them up but they definitely had a little spring in their step at the end of the season. I don't think it'll be long before they annually contend for the playoffs
hawks,3b2ows,kcbwya77,8,Thu Jun 25 14:10:06 2015 UTC,I can't believe that we will have to wait until march to play the red wings.  I miss having them in our division and playing 4 or 5 times a year.  Also there are 6 times where we play a team either home and home or twice in 3 games.

This season it was the day before Thanksgiving, two days after Christmas, and the last day of the season.  This year it's on New Years Eve, and then a random Tuesday in February (thank god).  BLAH I say."
hawks,3b2ows,djb2287,2,Thu Jun 25 14:45:17 2015 UTC,When are tickets on sale?   Also wow this schedule worked out great. Supposed to be in phoenix on the 29th of December. Hawks play there on the 29th pending their location. Please stay in Arizona coyotes..

hawks,3b3jgo,1point-21-jigowatz,3,Thu Jun 25 19:08:00 2015 UTC,I just e-mailed my ticket guy to see if he does groups and what the rate would be. I got the pack because I know I can sell Montreal and NY and will likely make it to a few more games to make it worth my while. Pretty sure we can just get a group and buy just the single game.
hawks,3b3jgo,ClutchBender,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"Here's the info: << Lower End Zone is $49, Goal Zone-Sky Club (All inclusive food, beer, wine and soda) is $49,  Goal Zone is $15.

hawks,3b3jgo,Chicagoiscool,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"So it's 50 bucks for the all inclusive seats? How can they pull that off? I'm interested, maybe drive the family truckster down and have a little vacation"
hawks,3b3jgo,JosePajamas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"They created an upstairs ""club sky"" all inclusive club. I think its $60-80 normally so $50 is a steal. I looked at going to the hawks game last year and they had a 2 for $99 club seats including 2 beers. I ended up just going to the games vs Buffalo and Tampa. Had uppers vs Tampa. this is where I moved down to"
hawks,3b3jgo,egotripping,3,Fri Jun 26 04:46:29 2015 UTC,I want in on this
hawks,3b3jgo,Cartortus,3,Thu Jun 25 19:14:23 2015 UTC,I'm all about that Lightning game since I live relatively close to Tampa. Plus wearing the championship hats and patches is almost a must.
hawks,3b3jgo,sleepdepriveddev,2,Thu Jun 25 20:22:41 2015 UTC,Yep I'm trying to organize a group with my friends to take a trip for the panthers game in january.  Not sure what a single ticket is but airfare right now is about $200 roundtrip if you're willing to brave spirit.  Not bad.
hawks,3b3jgo,sirwcotton,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"I messaged the mods to see if they want to do a r/hawks trip. The group rate is $15 for goal zone upper corners, $49 for upper corner all inclusive club (food, beer, wine soda) or $49 for lowers. It's $200 to lock in seats/price now as they have dynamic pricing and this game will surely go up as the season progresses. Spirit sucks but if you're on top of your game (being at gate no less than 60 minutes prior to departure, printing out ticket, bringing only backpack and not paying for carry on) you can make it work."

hawks,3b0h4s,hawks198810,13,Thu Jun 25 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna assume because only Mark Messier chooses the winner, rather than the Pro Hockey Writers Association"
hawks,3b0h4s,jacksonvstheworld,7,Thu Jun 25 00:15:21 2015 UTC,Because he's a troll and he doesn't say anything positive in this sub.
hawks,3b0h4s,Stillflying,10,Thu Jun 25 01:26:16 2015 UTC,"He is a troll. He has stupid arguments often backed up only with anecdotal evidence and its better to ignore him, but the broken clock is right for once. Messier picks the awards himself and often bases it on either who won the cup or whatever media hype was centering on.  I'm kinda curious who players would vote for as the best leader (on the condition they can't vote for their own teammates). Granted they can't see into the lockerooms for other teams but they're down there on the ice theyd have the best idea youd think."
hawks,3b0h4s,jacksonvstheworld,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:34:08 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I also wonder what other players would vote. I think they'd get a decent idea from how they see that player act on the ice though. I don't think Backes gets any votes from other teams :)

hawks,3b0h4s,shadywabbit,6,Thu Jun 25 01:40:13 2015 UTC,I'll give you that. It's pretty arbitrary
hawks,3b0h4s,jerry200890,-9,Thu Jun 25 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"Well first of all just the basis of an award like that, judging leadership, is incredibly stupid. There's no way of going about it. It's not something that can be measured. Even if the players themselves voted on it or the writers, it would still be pointless and mean nothing. But that fucking Mark Messier, pretty much completely removed from any organization, not knowing anything in depth about any of them or their locker rooms, decides who the best leader is? It's a joke. Again, if it would be a player vote it would still be a joke, but that he decides? I don't know how people can take it seriously."

hawks,3b13ox,Coop3,14,Thu Jun 25 03:32:49 2015 UTC,"I think saying people (read me) were posting and commenting on the cover sort of 'against' the Hawks wasn't for karma, but for a few reasons.   They took a really cool picture, added shitty filters and flares to it, and slapped it on the cover. (This was the main reason for me, they made a picture of a great moment look like a middle school media arts project).   Kane and Toews are some generational talent, and HOFers for sure, they helped bring this team back from what it was, and deserve all the accolades and awards they've been given. But they've already been on the cover in 10 and 11, I get that that shouldn't automatically disqualify them from being on this cover, but it could have just as easily gone to another player who hasn't graced the cover yet, but is still the same caliber as our boys. Guys like Benn, Tavares, Johnson, karlson, or Stammerhell price would make a lot of sense after the year he's had.   Because we're talking about giving others a chance doesn't make us any less of Hawks fans, there are a lot of great players in this league who aren't on the Blackhawks, and granted there are a lot who are on our team. But if you can't appreciate talent regardless of which team the player is on, I think there's something wrong. I hate the blues just like all of us, but tarasenko has some filthy hands, the preds suck, but forsberg had a hell of a year, fuck the Kings, but doughty is a solid D man, I'm not Montreal fan but Price is a wicked goalie. Perry is kind of a dick, but he's a great power forward. There are great players all over the place, not just on our Hawks.   I'm not in anyway complaining about 19 and 88 being on the cover, but I understand why so many are upset. I guess you can't please everyone anyways. All I'm saying is that supporting the idea of giving someone else a chance to be on some game cover doesn't make you any less of a Hawks fan.  But EA is gonna EA, realistically this was done for the money. EA knows there are a lot of people on the Blackhawks hype train, and they're cashing in by putting our boys on front. As much as its a privilege to be on the cover, they're using them to push the game. EA is trying to run a business and sell a product after all."

hawks,3ay964,Lindkvist15,25,Wed Jun 24 13:45:25 2015 UTC,"For the sake of this discussion, here are the 2015/2016 goalie salary cap hits:  Lundqvist - 8.5 m  Bobrovsky - 7.425 m  Rask - 7 m  Rinne - 7 m  Price - 6.5 m  Ward - 6.3 m  Ryan Miller - 6 m  Crawford - 6 m  Schneider - 6 m  Bishop - 5.95  Varlamov - 5.9  Lehtonen - 5.9  Quick - 5.8  Fleury - 5.75  Smith - 5.66  Howard - 5.29  Luongo - 4.533  Halak - 4.5  Hiller - 4.5  Craig Anderson - 4.2  Mason - 4.1  Pavelec - 3.9  Backstrom - 3.4  Elliott - 2.5  Reimer - 2.3  Scrivens - 2.3  Khubodin - 2.25  Lehner - 2.225  Stalock - 1.6  Berra - 1.45  Talbot - 1.45  Hammond - 1.35  Johnson - 1.3  Kuemper - 1.25  Frederik Andersen - 1.15  Lack - 1.15  Vasilevsky - .925  To me, it looks like Crawford is paid exactly right.    Now, if a good enough trade offer comes along, then I'm okay with a trade, but it better be good.  I like Darling, but the sample size is small.  As much as you want to say Crawford is inconsistent... well just look at the Blues goaltending to see what real inconsistency is and how it can hurt a team.  Edit: Added down to 1 million as requested."
hawks,3ay964,ViagraAndSweatpants,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"Out of the guys above and around Crow, I'm only taking Lundqvist, Price, and maybe Rinne above Crow.  maybe Rask, but he didn't really carry his team this season and may be a mild upgrade over Crow.  I like Bob, but he wasn't superman again and looked kind of bad in International this year."
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:32:59 2015 UTC,I don't think 6.5/7m is unreasonable for Crawford...also King Henry is underpaid.
hawks,3ay964,grimm22,0,Wed Jun 24 21:53:47 2015 UTC,Think you should take this all the way down to the million dollar level.  Lots of big saves in that 1 to 2 million range.
hawks,3ay964,1point-21-jigowatz,2,Wed Jun 24 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"Added.  Not sure who you would want there.  The ones that have some decent upside like Lack, Andersen, Vasilevsky, Hammond, are all on entry level, prove it contracts."

hawks,3ay964,1point-21-jigowatz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:18:21 2015 UTC,2nd contract from what they had coming up from the AHL.  Basically first contract as a full time starter.  Likely they get a significant bump at next contract (2-3 years) and I wouldn't be surprised if they get more than 6 million if they improve in the next couple years.  Basically what the going price of a competant goalie will be at the time.

hawks,3ay964,1point-21-jigowatz,2,Wed Jun 24 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but those guys won't be paid that little for very long."
hawks,3ay964,ChrisPummer,43,Wed Jun 24 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"Here's my abridged thoughts from another thread:  Consider this, Raanta takes over after dumping Crawford. His cap hit is 750K, but he's only signed for one year. One of three things happen, 1) Blackhawks make the playoffs, Raanta doesn't play at a good level, Blackhawks get eliminated. 2) Blackhawks make playoffs, Raanta plays well, but Blackhawks get eliminated anyways. 3) Raanta plays excellent, Blackhawks win the cup again. The same situation could play out for Darling, but two years from now, instead of 1.   Now, this brings us into a UFA year for Raanta who either 1) Will not be wanted back due to poor performance and a missed opportunity if they had Crawford. 2) He'll sign for a pretty hefty, though not Crawford level contract, probably somewhere in the 4.5 million range, which makes me wonder if 1.5 million more for a proven Crawford is really that big of a deal. 3) He'll demand cup winning money and get paid at least 6 million, thus starting this whole damn debate over again.   I'd rather have the proven one with a long term contract that will look good in 2-3 years, than have a goalie who can't win or one we'll have to sign for 6.5-7 million in one or two years. Cup winning goaltender prices go up each year.   He might leave some space up high, but he's one of the best goalies in the league on point-blank opportunities and breakaways/shootouts. Also, he's fantastic on shots high blocker side and nobody should even try to score on him 5 hole. He's not as strong post to post as Darling or Raanta, but he makes up for it with his positioning. Raanta's positioning is downright ugly sometimes and I haven't seen enough of Darling to say one way or another on his.  Edit: And just to add on, the defense is not what it used to be. They gave up the ninth most shots against per game this year. Don't get me wrong, I love the top 4 d men, but the bottom pairing has hindered them. Especially when Q mixes it up and puts a bottom guy with a top 4 guy. They got away with it in the playoffs by essentially not playing the bottom pairing, but they can't keep that up for a whole season. Let's hope TVR proves to be as good as he showed at the beginning of this season."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,37,Wed Jun 24 14:41:58 2015 UTC,To go even further; 6M for a proven goalie today will be 7-9M in 3 years. Whereas Crow will be 6M for another 5 years. The cap won't be that bad if we move sharp and bickell so you cannot trade crow unless the offer is too good to refuse.
hawks,3ay964,DiggerNicks13,10,Wed Jun 24 16:38:30 2015 UTC,Exactly.
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,2,Wed Jun 24 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered how cheap this could be considered in the future, pending that the price for proven goalies keeps going up and his skills maintain. That being said it would be advantageous in the long run, but it may just be hard to work with that salary in the next year or two. And I thought Bickell had a no trade in his contract, just like crow. If this is true it would be easier to move a player that played well because he may get an offer he couldn't refuse and would be ok with going. Right now no one is going to pay that much for Bickell to be willing to leave."
hawks,3ay964,Skweres88,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"4M over 2 years isn't that bad. A team under the salary floor would be a good landing spot. Hell, Bickell might even crack the top 6 somewhere. He can list 10 teams to go to per his no trade so that shouldn't be an issue."
hawks,3ay964,DiggerNicks13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, so a no trade isn't a no trade anywhere, its just I don't want to go to (insert 10 teams here)?"
hawks,3ay964,Skweres88,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was a little vague. He can list 10 teams that he would allow per his no trade. I honestly don't think it matters at all as I seriously doubt he would go against Stanbo after 2 cups. Bickell understands the business side.  EDIT: My memory was off. There is a list of 8 teams he can be traded to without permission. However, as I stated above, I'm sure he will permit any trade that Stanbo creates."
hawks,3ay964,DiggerNicks13,-1,Wed Jun 24 21:39:51 2015 UTC,I'll believe that when I see it.
hawks,3ay964,jerry200890,3,Wed Jun 24 20:10:39 2015 UTC,Raanta? He's our 3rd string goalie - what about Darling?
hawks,3ay964,ShrewyLouie,2,Wed Jun 24 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"You can see I said in the very first paragraph that the same situation is relevant to Darling in 2 years.  Darling was 2nd string this year, but I'm not at all convinced he'll be second string for too long. I believe that they wanted Raanta to get regular playing time in the AHL to develop him, as he has a higher ceiling than Darling does. I could be wrong, but either way, like I already mentioned, I did include Darling in the above scenario."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,3,Wed Jun 24 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yea that doesn't make sense when you consider that Darling got playoff starts. Are you forgetting the ""goalie controversy"" that happened merely 3 weeks ago?  I don't doubt that Raanta is seen as a developmental asset, but do you really think he would start over Darling if Crawford was gone? I don't..."
hawks,3ay964,ShrewyLouie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"Right now, no, Darling is better because of his size and strength, as those are things that don't need to be developed. 1-2 years from now, I do believe Raanta will be the better goalie. I never said Raanta is better right now, I just believe he'll be better with more development, especially considering how much he'll be able to improve his positioning.  My point still stands tho, the same contract situation could play out with Darling in 2 years. He could demand 6.5-7 mil or more if they win a cup with him, whereas Crawford would still have 3 years left at 6 mil/year at that point."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,2,Wed Jun 24 16:47:04 2015 UTC,I feel very alone on this sub in viewing Darling as just an okay backup.  It seems like every year every team has some scrub come in and play well for a few games here or there.  I don't feel confident watching him play against sustained pressure though.  I've felt better about other backups in recent years (Crawford and Raanta included).  Darling's career path seems to support my layman's assessment as well.
hawks,3ay964,brianskuhar,2,Wed Jun 24 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in that I don't see Darling as a long term guy, and I don't believe he could keep up his play over a full season, especially as teams get to know him more. At the same time, I can't complain about his results thus far."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:37:13 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely.  I'm fine with him as the backup.  Cheap as dirt and serviceable.  If Crawford were to go down for any extended amount of time I most likely wouldn't be so happy with him though.
hawks,3ay964,brianskuhar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:48:31 2015 UTC,There's your answer. It's nice to have (had) 3 competent goalies.
hawks,3ay964,ShrewyLouie,2,Sat Jun 27 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"In a couple years, any goalie winning a cup during or right before a contract year will pull in $6M AAV"
hawks,3ay964,TattyMold,9,Wed Jun 24 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"At least. And there are already quite a few contracts out there that I'd say are much worse than Crawford. For example, Luongo is getting 6.7, Ward 6.6, Ryan Miller & Kari Lehtonen are each getting 6.25, and I'd take Crawford over any of these goalies currently. And I'd take Crawford at 6 over Marc Andre Fleury at 5.75 and Jimmy Howard at 5.5.  Edit: Just realized Luongo's cap hit is 5.25 mil, but that could make his contract even worse because if he retires before the end of his contract there will be recapture penalties."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,13,Wed Jun 24 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"Truth. Crawford has the eighth best save percentage among goalies to play more than 2000 minutes in both the regular season and playoffs since 05-06, and he's got the seventh largest cap hit among goalies. I'd say that's just about right on the money."
hawks,3ay964,TattyMold,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:02:06 2015 UTC,Many people also fail to consider that seabrook will not be in a hawks sweater much longer. His contract will be up soon and there's absolutely no way the hawks can afford to retain him after him winning 3 cups.
hawks,3ay964,ddengel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"Why are you so convinced of this? His cap hit currently is 5.8 million, but he's only getting paid 5 million. Do you honestly think he's gonna get a huge raise on his next contract? He's on the wrong side of 30 now, so I don't see it happening. If he signs for an AAV of 5.5 mil (which might be overpaying), then they will actually save 300K on the cap."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,9,Fri Jun 26 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"Seems like a similar situation as Niemi ye? ""I think Crawford is a goalie than can play games on an elite level but I just don't believe he does it often enough to be considered an elite goalie."" I think that sums it up perfectly.   However, if we're consistently able to make the playoffs/ECF/SCF with ""non-elite"" goaltending, do we really need elite play from teh position during the reg. season when Crow was able to do in the Post what Price and Lundqvist weren't able to do.   I know this year's cap situation doesn't make this so black and white, just food for thought."
hawks,3ay964,needsmorepepper,-3,Wed Jun 24 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need an elite goalie to win, but in that case we shouldn't pay for an elite goalie."
hawks,3ay964,BottleRocketCaptain,8,Wed Jun 24 14:32:27 2015 UTC,When there aren't many elite goalies in the league teams will pay to keep a moderately above average away from other teams.
hawks,3ay964,needsmorepepper,6,Wed Jun 24 14:49:39 2015 UTC,Especially when they come up big in the playoffs like Crow does
hawks,3ay964,BottleRocketCaptain,6,Wed Jun 24 15:06:21 2015 UTC,Exactly. Even just to have a goaltender with playoff experience at all is something that most teams can only dream of.
hawks,3ay964,injun_head,36,Wed Jun 24 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"You fail to mention how Crawford has been rewarded for being a team guy.  He came up through the Hawks system.  He waited his turn.  He is by all accounts a good locker room guy, unlike many goalies who are cancerous if talked to before a game.  He never blames his teammates when they turn the puck over in the D zone and he always take the losses on his shoulders.  He stabilizes the back end so the D can be so active.  And most importantly, he wins.  He is the winning-est goal tender in Hawks history.  That didn't happen by mistake and he has not been carried by superior teammates for four seasons to have the stats he has.  He is not perfect, nobody is.  If he isn't elite, who give a fuck.  How many of those elite goaltenders have helped to bring two cups home, or even one cup in the tenure?  Crawford gets paid well because he does his job well and that job is to win!  Note: Animosity is not towards OP, his comments are valid, just commenting towards the general hate aimed at Crow."
hawks,3ay964,Argocap,0,Wed Jun 24 14:54:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you mean by winningest goaltender in Hawks history, but you can't throw that out there without clarifying it. Perhaps you mean by number of Cups, but that's not winningest. Actually it's quite well sorted because the top four on goalie wins are already ordered in terms of best in franchise history. Esposito, Hall, Belfour, Crawford."
hawks,3ay964,Bnavis,3,Wed Jun 24 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"I mean, to be in the same conversation as any of those players proves that Crow is solid."
hawks,3ay964,Argocap,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:50:16 2015 UTC,"Time will tell, but right now he's our Osgood. Which isn't bad."
hawks,3ay964,ScienceOwnsYourFace,2,Wed Jun 24 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, Crow surpassed them all in post-season games won. I'm not sure about total wins, but he is, depending on how you define it, the winningest goalie the Hawks have ever had. And, there is no hard and fast rule to that. I'll take the playoff/cup version of the definition.  Likewise, as said above, his stats are like 8th(SV% >2k minutes TOI) in the league, while his cap hit is 7th. We have not over payed him."
hawks,3ay964,Argocap,2,Wed Jun 24 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"You can't use the word without defining it, because with total wins he is very far behind Esposito and that defeats the meaning of ""winningest"". He's won the most Stanley Cups, which is very good. But he's also our fourth best goalie, not best."
hawks,3ay964,ScienceOwnsYourFace,-3,Wed Jun 24 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"edit Thanks for the down votes, non-contributors. Glad to be speaking with adults.  So most playoff wins doesn't count? You're literally saying that your definition is the only correct one. Do you realize that? I have a feeling you didn't really take in my entire message."
hawks,3ay964,Argocap,2,Wed Jun 24 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"He has the same number of playoff wins as Esposito playing in an era with many more playoff games and on a much better team. He'll probably pass it which is cool, but he is not the winningest goalie right now. Most Stanley Cups yes."
hawks,3ay964,injun_head,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:42:51 2015 UTC,I meant post-season winning-est tender.  His regular season stats are adding up pretty nicely.

hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,13,Wed Jun 24 15:24:03 2015 UTC,Not this season.  We were 8th is shots given up this season.  Crow's stats didn't change.  He's also in the tops in high quality scoring chances stopped.
hawks,3ay964,zerokyuu,7,Wed Jun 24 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"This. The Hawks defense this year was not what it was in 2013 and 2013-2014. Especially down the stretch. After this year, I'm not going to go around saying Crawford is the best or argue that he's in the top 5, but I'd have trouble saying he's not a top 10 goalie. Sure he has a bad game every once in a while, but I feel like he's stepped up and dragged this team along when they needed it."
hawks,3ay964,injun_head,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:29:02 2015 UTC,"The team is good, no doubt, but I believe he is a big part of why the team is good.  He does his part."

hawks,3ay964,BottleRocketCaptain,5,Wed Jun 24 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"i think it's more the curent state of the league that lends itself to these goalies getting bigger contracts than what they're worth, even though they are still great goalies who can play incredibly. Crawford and Marc Andre-Fleury are good examples. Both have huge contracts that seem a little high for their numbers. The thing is though that these are goalies that can play at an elite level at times and the other times they are playing average to above average. When we look around at other teams we see a lot of goaltending inconsistencies. A lot of teams would kill to have a goaiie like Crawford who can play at at least an average level consistently. Teams like the Hawks and the Pens know that even though they don't have super elite goaltenders they have consistency and a guarantee of consistent play so they pay these guys so they'll stay around because it's better to have consistent averageness (with some amazing play thrown in) than either below average or inconsistent goaltending."
hawks,3ay964,wjbc,6,Wed Jun 24 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"With this said, I'm not sure that the solution is to trade him and play Darling and Raanta, to pretty inexperienced goalies.   This is a key point.  The Blackhawks overpaid to keep Crawford because they wanted to win now and didn't have a great alternative.  They don't plan to trade him for the same reason.  He's not the best goalie in the league, maybe not even top five, but he's better than any likely alternative.    Those who argue we should trade him assume Darling and Raanta can take over for him the way Crawford took over for Niemi.  Maybe that's true, maybe not, but it's an unnecessary gamble.  The Blackhawks wouldn't have traded Niemi if they could have figured out a way to keep him.  Long story short, there are better ways to deal with the cap than trading Crawford.  That being said, I agree the backlash against those who questioned Crawford has been pretty ridiculous, as backlash often is on reddit."

hawks,3ay964,Templescio,2,Wed Jun 24 15:41:10 2015 UTC,I'm not denying that. But there's also some truth to the fact that he's done it in this era's Blackhawks.
hawks,3ay964,Templescio,5,Wed Jun 24 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"Crawford is easily elite in shootout/breakaway style shots which happen often due to our style of play (also thanks for the extra practice rozy <3) and is also a great team player. How many times have we slammed a shot or screamed ""fucking right"" after Crawdaddy beats some asshat that got feisty in front of his net with HIS players.

If you want to play the salary and numbers game, lets do that because you skipped over the salary comparison pretty quickly Crawford - 6.0 mil - 9.24 SV %, 2.27 GAA  Lundquist - 8.5 mil - 9.22 SV%, 2.36 GAA  Bobrovsky - 7.4 mil - 918 SV %, 2.69 GAA  Cam Ward - 6.3 mil - .910 SV %, 2.40 GAA  Schneider - 6.0 mil - .925 SV %, 2.26 GAA  Quick - 5.8 mil - .918 SV %, 2.24 GAA  Mike Smith - 5.6 mil - .904 SV %, 3.16 GAA  Jimmy Howard - 5.2 mil - .910 SV %, 2.44 GAA  Seymon Varlamov - 5.9 mil - 9.21 SV %, 2.56 GAA  This is not considering playoffs performance, which everyone can agree that Crawford is a big game goalie.  Please tell me how Crawford isn't worth his contract if all these other guys are.   A lot of fans are tired of hearing about goalies.  Ever since Eddie Belfour went to Dallas, Chicago fans have not liked any of their goalies and it's just getting old to listen to when we've won 2 cups now with a guy that can't get respect."
hawks,3ay964,Tornsys,3,Wed Jun 24 16:05:53 2015 UTC,"And in the Central Division, too."
hawks,3ay964,Tornsys,0,Wed Jun 24 18:21:33 2015 UTC,You left out Price and one season isn't good enough when it comes to the future.
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,5,Wed Jun 24 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"I left out a lot of people, but I figured a few examples would do.    Also, his career numbers while with the club is .917 SV % and 2.34 GAA which is still comfortably in the range of very good but not great.  He earns his money and it's hard to deny it."
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,0,Wed Jun 24 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"Also, his career numbers while with the club is .917 SV % and 2.34 GAA which is still comfortably in the range of very good but not great. He earns his money and it's hard to deny it.   The question is whether those numbers are inflated because of playing behind a great team. Would a cheaper goalie put up the same numbers as he does? Would Crawford play as well on a different team?"
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,2,Wed Jun 24 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"I hear that same thing being said all the time.  You can certainly try and attribute goals against average to a good defensive team, but less so for save %.  I feel like you're really reaching here.  If there isn't something you can definitely point to as tangible proof that he isn't worth what his contemporaries are making, then I'm not sure you have a leg to stand on.    Also, you can make the same team defense argument against Raanta and Darling who you seem confident enough in to take the risk with."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,3,Wed Jun 24 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"One Season?  Crow has two cups and 5 seasons under his belt.  This year was his best SV% since the lockout cup win where the entire team was lights out.  This year, there were struggles and he stepped up big time.  His sophomore season was his only season with a SV% below a .917.  Also, Price's numbers this year were:  Carey Price - 6.5 m - .933 SV %, 1.96 GAA  Price is inhuman."
hawks,3ay964,arbutus1440,2,Wed Jun 24 18:42:19 2015 UTC,What I meant is that one season of stats between goalies isn't good enough to prove which goalies are the best.   I don't know why you keep putting out TWO cups because those are team stats. Would he have two cups on a different team? Would he have the same stats on a different team? Probably not.
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"There's that word ""probably.""  It's speculation.  He might very well have the same stats on another team.  It's not like the D this year was even close to that of the past years, yet he still raised his SV% and lowered his GAA from last year."
hawks,3ay964,TheMagicalDonkey,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:09:58 2015 UTC,Of course it's speculation...
hawks,3ay964,1point-21-jigowatz,15,Wed Jun 24 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"You have stated that every goalie above him is better and ""elite.""  What's your basis for that besides that they look like they make acrobatic saves?  Is it stats?  Crows are right up there at the top with those guys.  Is it ability to bounce back after a bad goal or loss?  Look what he did in round 2... and the years before.  You said his positioning is bad, but that's kind of the exact opposite of true.  He has some nuances like on the post as you said, but he's more often than not in great position so he doesn't have to make those acrobatic saves.  That's where he excels - positioning.  I'm not going to downvote you as these are just personal observations, but I am getting tired of people saying he's not elite.  What exactly makes him not elite?  Sure he has bad games, but so does Lundqvist, Quick, Rask, etc.  Look what happened to Rask this year.  He looked very pedestrian as far as goalies go, but people say he's elite.  Rinne have some obvious skill, but when it comes down to it, he can be solved in the playoffs.  Is Crow the best?  No (Carey Price is in my opinion), but he's, by all definitions, elite.  He deserves his pay."
hawks,3ay964,jmr33090,5,Wed Jun 24 14:25:00 2015 UTC,"You're right about Crawford's positioning and most people agree. His positioning is one of his best assets. Idk what coaches this guy is talking to, but I have a feeling the conversation starts with negative comments about Crawford and goes from there because seriously, everything I can find lists his positioning as a positive asset."

hawks,3ay964,Stillflying,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"Couldn't play the vid, but I'm interested in this point. Is it possible they were talking about how he sometimes gets caught out of position? Because that does happen. He's relatively sluggish moving post to post, and that affects his ""position"" as a play unfolds if the puck is moved across the ice quickly. But for most shot attempts that aren't the result of quick lateral passing, Crawford seems to me like he's right where he needs to be."
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,0,Wed Jun 24 21:51:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm sure they are qualified, but there are a lot of people that disagree with them."
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,4,Thu Jun 25 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"I like how all of the ""elite"" goalies got knocked out this year. I have an irrational dislike of Bishop (I think his size is just ridiculous) but he outlasted Price and King Lundqvist. Same for Crow vs. Dubnyk, and is Anderson ""elite""?"
hawks,3ay964,Aperture-Employee,7,Wed Jun 24 15:01:22 2015 UTC,New to the sport ... Is hockey played with two goaltenders at opposite ends of the ice shooting pucks at each other? Or ... Are there other players involved?
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,9,Wed Jun 24 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"I just find it interesting that you think this way. Every goalie coach I've talked to and listen to has expressed concern about Crawford's positioning. What makes you claim a different opinion on the matter?  And the elite thing is of course subjective but watching Crawford play and watching goalies like Lundqvist and Price play, you see a real difference, not only in style (which doesn't matter) but in skill. I just disagree with you assessment that he's elite. That's my opinion.    but he's more often than not in great position so he doesn't have to make those acrobatic saves.   More often than not is not saying much. It's like saying he makes more saves than he lets in goals."
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,4,Wed Jun 24 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"Kari Lehtonen & Ryan Miller are getting paid more than Crawford, as well as Cam Ward who you already mentioned. These guys are not elite. Miller was at one point, but right now, I'm taking Crawford over any of them."
hawks,3ay964,wjbc,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"So do I. But to be clear, Lehtonen's cap hit is 5.9 and Miller's the same as Crawford."
hawks,3ay964,rezthepinnacle,2,Wed Jun 24 17:24:10 2015 UTC,So worse goaltenders are getting paid the same as Crawford? And that means that Crawford is...overpaid? I don't understand.
hawks,3ay964,brianskuhar,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:24 2015 UTC,People dont think hes overpaid. People think his cap is too much for a starved hawks team when there are other potential goalie options. Personally I'd rather keep Crow. But if there is a discussion to be had about trading him I'd want a further season with Darling/Raanta showing us what they have first. playing a good few games as a backup is what theyre supposed to do. Its not the same as starting though.
hawks,3ay964,honestbleeps,11,Thu Jun 25 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"How many goalies are you talking to?  Are they NHL caliber goalies?  Take a look at the Hawks shot suppression numbers from this year and last.  They gave up more this year, yet Crow's save percentage is still up top.  ""More often than not"" is just an expression that i use, it's not an actual measure of amounts.  It just means he's in position most of the time so he doesn't have to make those desperation saves.   watching Crawford play and watching goalies like Lundqvist and Price play, you see a real difference, not only in style (which doesn't matter) but in skill.   This, again, is just an opinion.  I've watched all the elite goalies and I don't see more skill (except Price, who played his junior about 2 hours form my town).  If you want to bring opinions of hockey players in to it - I'm a player, my brother plays and refs, and my dad used to play and is a ref.  Most of my team agrees Crawford is a good goalie, even my own goalie.  We are not NHL caliber players, but we know the game.  I don't put any stock in it as I'm not an NHL scout, player, or coach, but it holds as much weight as the ""Other goalies just look better when I watch them"" argument.

hawks,3ay964,lazy_skeptic,2,Wed Jun 24 15:13:18 2015 UTC,Jonathan Quick is the most overrated player in the NHL imo.
hawks,3ay964,ViagraAndSweatpants,5,Wed Jun 24 17:02:42 2015 UTC,It's hard to see him getting so much more praise that Crawford when they are very similar in ability and stats.
hawks,3ay964,BlueLineMenace,0,Wed Jun 24 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"Quick being an elite goalie is of course up to debate as well. And your stats that you bring up are team stats, not individual.   And as you said earlier    Look what happened to Rask this year. He looked very pedestrian as far as goalies go, but people say he's elite.   His SV% was only .02 lower than Crawford playing on a team that didn't go to playoffs. Stats are sometimes victims of a team game, which means you have to have different aspects on how you evaluate a goalie. Both stats and how they play.   As I said in the post, I'm not a Crow hater and this discussion is mainly about him being elite or not. It would be interesting to hear which goalies you consider elite."
hawks,3ay964,ChrisPummer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"I guess I was going off what I've heard others consider elite.  If your asking for who I think is elite, and I define elite as a game changer: a guy who behind almost any competent NHL team can consistently win, steal some games for them and keep their GAA and SV% in the tops, I really only thinks there are 2, maybe 3-4 in the league.  Price, Lundqvist, then it's kind of a toss up from year to year.  Quick, Rinne, Crawford, sometimes Rask, and after this year, Holtby.  It's hard to discount Steve Mason's 2.25 GAA and .928 SV% behind a shitty Philly team."

hawks,3ay964,ChrisPummer,3,Wed Jun 24 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"I think you make some excellent points. I consider Crawford to be above average, though he does seem to step up his game when it matters most. I think the key piece is how much he's making. Looking at some of the other names we're likely going to part with this off-season, it only makes sense."
hawks,3ay964,BlueLineMenace,9,Wed Jun 24 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with this.  He's not an elite goalie by default, but he is an elite goalie when the team needs an elite goalie.  Games 4, 5, and 6 in the SCF.  I rest my case.  I think his $6M cap hit benefits the Hawks in their pursuit of cups more than Sharp's $5.9M does.  If you're forced to shed only one of those contracts, it's clear why Sharp is the first choice for Bowman.  All that being said, I also wouldn't mind shedding both contracts if there were a suitable option to step in.  This argument is being framed as cutting the $6M down to $500K though, and I'm not comfortable heading into the playoffs with Raanta or Darling between the pipes."

They say untouchable for the specific reason of increasing trade value.  I have no doubt that if an amazing deal got presented to Bowman for Crow, he would take it.  Untouchable means you better bring an A+ offer.    The team has a cap crunch.  Trades need to happen, youngsters need to be signed, and there are precisely 3 contracts that will help the situation:  Sharp, Bickell, Crow.  Crow is the only one that we know Bowman values, but also has a promising rookie waiting.  It's the least likely, but most controversial trade, hence conversation."
hawks,3ay964,Stillflying,5,Wed Jun 24 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"Ideally his stats don't match his salary.  But his track record does. Price, Lunqvist, Rinne... none of them have a cup. Crawford has 2. Your goalie needs to give you a chance to win. That is what Corey does almost every night. In the end the only real issue is his cap hit. If we didn't overpay everyone after our Cup wins the cap wouldn't be an issue.  If the cap wasn't an issue Crow wouldn't be an issue."
hawks,3ay964,Brian707,6,Wed Jun 24 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"I just disagree that his stats don't match his salary. All of the ""elite"" guys make more than $6 million -- Lundqvist, Bobrovsky, Rask, Rinne, Price. Crawford is in the class of guys making between $5-6 million that includes Fleury, Quick, Howard, Lehtonen, Miller, Bishop, Schneider, Mike Smith, Luongo (on his super long contract).  Has anyone looked at the guys the next step down? Halak, Hiller, Craig Anderson, Mason, Pavelec all make about $4 million or more, and obviously some other guys like Niemi, Bernier and Dubnyk will probably join this group with free agent paydays or extensions.   Even if Crawford isn't elite, I'm pretty comfortable with his ranking among guys in that next tier of salary."
hawks,3ay964,1point-21-jigowatz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:48:14 2015 UTC,That may be fair.  I think $6m/yr is significant.  I'm fine with Crow but I also think 5.0 to 5.5 would be more accurate.  Admittedly I may be improperly influenced by our cap situation.  But that's where I satnd today.
hawks,3ay964,BottleRocketCaptain,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"Well, to say a guy is overpaid by half a million, that's a small quibble. Keep in mind, too, when the Hawks gave him that contract there was the expectation that the cap would be growing faster. And it probably would have if low oil prices hadn't hurt the Canadian dollar this year, and the NHLPA hadn't asked for a lower figure last year to keep lower escrow payments.   That's still a consequence the Hawks have to deal with, but not the kind of thing that backs them in a corner with the cap."

Anyone who thinks we could do better than Crow for the money they're spending is out of their mind.  Anyone who thinks we could get a better return on those funds with a lesser goalie is not just loopy, but completely deranged."
hawks,3ay964,1point-21-jigowatz,7,Wed Jun 24 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"I love the fact that a good portion of Hawks fans want to hand over the job to a goalie who was has played 10 NHL regular season games and played in the hockey hotbed of Baton Rouge Louisiana, one of about 15 places he has played in during his career. Or Raanta. Is Crawford overpaid? Yes right now he is, but is he an above average goalie that has provided stability? Yes he has and that's why you pay him and keep him over a soon to be 34 year old forward. Also forward depth on the Hawks is one of the strongest in the league. If you trade Crawford and get it wrong and think you can just plug in some journeyman goalie in, this team will never sniff a Cup again. Careful what you wish for, and that is why so many people get down voted, because they don't understand the risks of trading Crawford far far outweigh the possible upside"
hawks,3ay964,Hard58Core,2,Wed Jun 24 14:50:50 2015 UTC,So you have absolutly no confidence in our scouting team?  I don't think it's fair to look at Darlings path to the NHL as a measuring stick of his quality of play.  I think you can read through a lot of goalie coaches scouting of him to understand what you have in Darling.  Hopefully maturity and fire to play in the NHL has quieted those critics that say ... He was playing in a beer league in Cincinnati because he sucks.  That's not the case at all.
hawks,3ay964,bud1316,3,Wed Jun 24 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's saying that at all.  how many goalies are scouted well, but don't make it big?  A ton.  His point remains that we have Crow with years of experience, 2 cups, 2 Jennings, and great stats, or we have 2 guys who have played less than a seasons worth of games combined, and a D core that has given up a ton more shots this season than before and Crow has remained consistent.  We don't know that about the other guys as they have played very few games."

hawks,3ay964,bud1316,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone jumped on the Darling bandwagon and a lot of fans suddenly think he's some amazing goaltender and better than both Crawford and Raanta, albeit these people don't tend to know hockey.   When you look at the numbers Raanta and Darling it's actually pretty similar. Both played 14 regular season games and had 4 losses. Both had a .936 SV% and Raanta had a 1.89 GAA while darling was close with 1.94. Both are 26.   Taking Darlings small playoff run into consideration he had the same save percentage as the regular season and one can assume that any backup put into a situation like that is going to play his heart out to keep his spot on the team.   The confidence is with Crawford who is a proven playoff goalie on a team that can get him there."
hawks,3ay964,matunascraft,0,Wed Jun 24 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"Not on a Darling bandwagon.  That's the biggest disconnect with this whole conversation.  I'm looking at the team as a whole ... Knowing we have to pay for guys in front of the goalie and looking at who is under what contract and for how much.  I think we can win with another goalie being paid 1/12th what our current goalie is being paid ... Thus having more money to spend on other players in front of the goalie.  That said ... Everybody here is stuck on the names that are attached to this conversation.  Let's do this.   Let's switch the names and contracts and number of cups and Jennings Trophies and Baton Rouge hotbed of hockey for a moment.  If Darling was in the pipes and making 6 million a year, and won two cups, and two Jennings and we were in the cap hell predicament we're in ... And Crow was in the wings waiting making $550k a year for the next two years... Playing his way through the hockey hotbed of Baton Rouge ... I would be calling for us to dump Darling immediately and put Crow in.  Freeing up money to pay for players in front of the Goalie ...."
hawks,3ay964,loaferbro,2,Thu Jun 25 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"I think his overall play has gotten ridiculously better over the years. If you take out the rough stretch after his injury this year he was an elite goalie with crazy stats.  It took him a bit long to get back to that form, but was crazy good before and eventually after. If he keeps up his play he's worth keeping at that pay. While we may not need that good to make the playoffs, we need proven playoff nerves. He never lost his calm or stepped down play even after some goals he should have had.  He plays his glove hand a bit different due to his style of play but that hand is fast enough to make up for it.  The Kessler goal though has no excuse. Just think how much easier it will be to win more cups with a lights out goalie. If he's just as good next year he will prove his status as an elite goalie.  While we haven't needed an elite goalie to fully win us a cup, we just may in the next few years as defense gets older and these rookies start becoming everything we hope they will be. He may be the difference during our defensive transition over the years!!!  I originally was a somewhat Crow fan but have grown to really really respect what he's done and how he just keeps getting better.  I feel like we haven't seen his ceiling yet and God Damn it may be glorious!!"
hawks,3ay964,1point-21-jigowatz,3,Wed Jun 24 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"In every hockey game, when you're down, it's easy to blame the goalie. They're the last line of defense, right? Sure maybe a few goals this postseason got through Crow that shouldn't have, but there's also a lot that goes into it, just like every goal we scored on Rinne, Dubnyk, Anderson,  and Bishop weren't completely their fault.  Sometimes the puck takes a lucky bounce. One of the goals the Ducks took against us did. The puck was on edge and bounced right onto the player's stick. He didn't shoot it, he merely deflected what was already moving in an odd pattern. It's almost like trying to chase down a bouncing football. And there's hundreds of examples of goals like these 10x worse on youtube.  Another factor is the defensive line, and in some cases, when the puck is in your zone the forwards are your defenseman as well. If the defense isn't tight enough, it quickly becomes a 5v4 or 3 or 2 or 1, or as we've seen plenty this postseason, 5 v Crow. Even when faced with breakaways, he manages to save most of them, especially in the lightning series.  Plus, our goal scoring against the Preds especially was not good. When the other team scores, you have to answer. If we don't answer we lose.  And when we lose, the goaltender is the first to come up for people who watched only replays or checked the score.  There are plenty more bandwagon fans than there are real hawks fans, and they don't know how hockey works. They don't see what should have happened on the ice, they just see what did. And it's those people with the loudest voices.  Truth is, for a goaltender, 6mil is a lot. But is he doing his job? You ask the cup. Plus we can't just dump him. He's on a contract and a union. If his contract were to be bought out, that would mean over 20mil just to buy the end of his contract. Most teams with that money or mindset already have goalies.   Crow isn't the #1 or 2 or 3 goalie in the league. I didn't even think so in 2013, Rask was far better, and it wasn't our defense that won that cup, just like this year's defense didn't either. He's top 10, but under 5. He's a great goalie, but he doesn't put up the numbers like he should.  We've got a collective almost million dollars of 2 goalies, which means 7 million dollars put into 3 amazing goaltenders, who could switch in and out and the outcome of the game would still be a win.   TL;DR : Don't fix it if it ain't broke."
hawks,3ay964,WonAndDone,4,Wed Jun 24 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"There is a contingent of Hawks fans that will not let any other Hawks fans look at their team with a critical eye.  Well said in regards to Crawford.  I don't know one Hawks fan that hates Crow.  He plays well enough on this team ... With this team in front of him.  That said, as we look at our current situation and where money is being spent on what players ... and 6 million dollars wrapped up in that position seems to be a logical move to make to free space ... Knowing what we have in waiting @ 500k and 600k already signed and accounted for against the cap."
hawks,3ay964,aeternitatisdaedalus,6,Wed Jun 24 14:19:30 2015 UTC,"With this team in front of him   You keep saying this like it has meant something lately.  Team defense has been wildly inconsistent the last two seasons.  That combined with having the worst offensive season of the Rocky era, I think having stable goaltending might have been the main reason we made the playoffs this year."

hawks,3ay964,HobbitLass,2,Wed Jun 24 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"No doubt, it definitely takes a whole team effort.  Everyone has a bad game now and then.  Just like when one of those 600k goalies had one in the first round themselves and our 6M guy was able to come back in and pitch a shutout in relief.  Didn't look back after that."

It helps, but it's not necessary, especially with the guys we consistently put in front of ours.  If someone is willing to take the money, you absolutely trade him and move on. And if Darling, Raanta ends up becoming the same, you dump them and move on too. There's no reason to commit to a long-term netminder on that kind of money with this team."
hawks,3ay964,computer_monk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:20:17 2015 UTC,Thank you for this very concise look. I don't hate crow nor think that he is terrible. But I'm not crazy about him either. All the points you make are the ones I've been saying for the last couple years. I love him as a person. He is a great team player. But i think one if his biggest down falls is that he is so much in his head. He constantly tears himself down. I personally think it holds him back and causes his inconsistencies. *shrugs * I don't have nearly the background that most people on here have as I'm not a player. But i have been watching hockey my entire life. Again I like him a lot but I don't think saying he is the sole winner of the cup is accurate at all! I'll get down voted for this... But eh.
hawks,3ay964,badseedjr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"My opinion on Crawford has never changed, I've always thought that he was a very good goalie, but that 6mil was too much. I think 3.5-4mil is probably a better number."
hawks,3ay964,cubicle_jockey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:20:59 2015 UTC,"Not to mention his puck handling is among the worst I've ever seen, truly. Behind the net he's terrifying."
hawks,3ay964,titsforhits,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing to me is that the Blackhawks are no longer a regular season minded team. They assume they'll get to the playoffs, probably in a solid seeding, and they are focused on tuning up and being ready to play their best in the postseason. Now, with that in mind, look at these numbers:  Crow's Regular Season career numbers: http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/c/crawfco01.html#stats_basic_nhl::none  Crow's Postseason career numbers: http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/c/crawfco01.html#stats_playoffs_nhl::none  The key numbers here:  Win Percentage: RS~58%, PS~60% not much difference here, but a solid win rate in either case  Save Percentage: RS~.917, PS~.921 again, small difference, but once again better in the playoffs and both are well above 'serviceable'  Those may not be ""elite"" numbers, but the Hawks have played progressively shakier and shakier D since the fourth Cup in 2010 and Crawford has weathered that storm for years while still putting up extremely strong numbers. The real key is win percentage. Crawford just keeps winning. His regular season win rate would account for an average of 47-48 wins per season. I'll pay $6.5 mil/yr for that when it isn't only an average, but looking at each season you see he has consistently won 30+ games, and started just shy of 60 every season but one since becoming the starter.  Also, over a 7 game series, 60% win rate 'predicts' winning 4.2 games per 7...for whatever that's worth. To me, it's worth two Cups in three years, and that, in front of this slowly crumbling D, is priceless to me.  Either way, great writeup and don't waste too much effort on bandwagoners of any kind, whether they be Hawks or Crow-hater bandwagoners."

hawks,3ay964,cubicle_jockey,-1,Wed Jun 24 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"Amen.   I think what makes makes Crawford not elite is the lack of shutouts. He'll either start the game slowly and give up a weak goal early on or he'll look fine then give up a goal late in the game or late in the period. A guy like Rinne, Rask and Lindquist will pull through for that shutout. An honest assessment of Crawford should make you realize he's a perfectly functional goalie for the hawks but wonder if he is worth 6 million a year? Is his contract worth potentially losing Seabrook, Saad or Hjalmarsson?"

hawks,3aud9d,gthank,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"Man, getting Richards back next year would be sweet. Just imagine something like Panarin-Toews-Kane, Saad-TT-Hossa, McNeil/Danault/???-Richards-Shaw,Desjardins-Kruger-Nordstrom.  NOTE: I'm not actually a Nordstrom fan, but Q is, and his complete lack of offensive game won't really kill you when you're running him out there on the Sacrificial Kruger line anyway."
hawks,3aud9d,ClintEastwood41,18,Tue Jun 23 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"Panarin on the first line?  Not on a coach Q tea, I expect him to bounce around the 2nd and 3rd line."
hawks,3aud9d,gthank,3,Tue Jun 23 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"I'd normally agree with you about the ""no newbie on the 1st line"" thing, but I don't see Q being a big fan of rolling out multiple new guys on the same line, either, especially not when there are probably going to be so many new pieces on the blue line behind them. I also considered swapping Saad and Panarin.  Actually, the part that makes me doubt those lines the most is that I know Q likes to split up Kane and Toews, and he's ALSO shown an aversion to playing Kane w/ Teuvo. If that plays out, we could see something more like: Panarin-Toews-Hossa, Saad-Richards-Kane, McNeil/Danault-TT-Shaw for the first three lines. Unless McNeil/Danault show me some unexpected offensive prowess, though, that seems like a waste of Teuvo's skill set just for the idea of splitting up Toews and Kane."
hawks,3aud9d,ClintEastwood41,8,Tue Jun 23 17:22:18 2015 UTC,The idea of Panarin - Kruger - Shaw excites me.  All 3 guys are gritty as hell and when they mesh will be a big time scoring line.

Good players, especially over 30, will readily take a pay cut to play on this team (a la #91). I'm so ok with this."

hawks,3av4mn,Uncle_Hoss,6,Wed Jun 24 04:40:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought he was pretty brutal in that series.   I agree with you that 'hockey ain't all about goals' but the importance of those hits are often exaggerated and he refused to get to the front of the net. When he took shots, they were seemingly always blocked out of play. He was a very ineffective player and it's not a coincidence that Kane struggled in that series with Bickell on his line.   I've always been a Bickell apologist in that I didn't care if he was ineffective in the regular season, because the way he would play in the post season, getting to the front of the net (and staying there), making big hits to generate TOs and create space, his body wouldn't hold up for 82 games plus post season, but he didnt play that way this year.   Maybe it was the vertigo, but he was a highly ineffective player this post season. And he loves his wrist shot a bit too much for my liking."
hawks,3av4mn,IlliniXC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 99%. I think the St. Louis, Anaheim, LA, big physical punishing style of hockey is way over rated. This game is about possession and that's why you had a Chi-Tampa final. I'm just saying that during that Anaheim series when the Hawks were getting smashed shift after shift, it was good to know that Bickell was making them pay a price too. Can we get that out of Baun or Kero? Most likely, but Bryan did his thing and we went to the final."
hawks,3av4mn,Uncle_Hoss,3,Wed Jun 24 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"It's kind of funny because Arizona (particularly Maricopa County) is full of Chicago transplants, and Bickell would, in a way, become one.  Source: lived and went to school in Arizona for a year, frequently go there to visit family"

hawks,3av4mn,DannyTannersFlow,3,Wed Jun 24 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"He was put on the third line when he came back from injury because versteeg and kane have some sort of weird telepathic connection and they had to choose between keeping Saad or Sharp in the top 6. Pretty easy choice when considering that Saad is the future of our team.  Every loss you can blame on somebody, so whatever. You can blame a couple losses on Crawford, but man, he stepped up when it mattered. Just like Sharp scored some big goals in other games. 15 points in 23 playoff games is pretty damn good."

hawks,3av4mn,IlliniXC,7,Tue Jun 23 20:06:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd go quite as far as to say 'lit it up' but I agree that he was solid. Not sure if it's age or puck luck or recency bias, but he just doesn't seem to get some of the goals he once did.   I felt like I saw him miss a lot of breakaways this year and that continued on to the post season. And there were a few other instances where I remember thinking, ""two or three years ago, Sharp puts that in.""   I'm gonna miss the guy a ton, but just think 'lit it up' is a bit much. Obviously, his stats have a lot to do with being asked to play a different role for sure. And the off ice nonsense this season didn't help either. Hope he goes somewhere and can flourish again."

hawks,3aui8u,drumman44,2,Tue Jun 23 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"What about picks? Cam Talbot apparently is worth more than two 2nd round picks to the Rangers, so I'd be curious to see what kind of draft picks we could get."
hawks,3aui8u,Coop3,5,Tue Jun 23 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"Talbot started for 2 months while king Henry was out after taking a puck to the throat.   He did really well for himself, and was a big player in their presidents trophy this year. The rangers have pretty solid D, so take that as you will.  Raanta doesn't have nearly as many starts, and is still young. Talbot is soon to be 28, and has proven himself a starter this year, raanta not so much.  I'd see him in a package deal, he wouldn't fetch nearly what talbot would."
hawks,3aui8u,Coop3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"I still think two 2nds is too much for Talbot, as we don't know how he'll be as a full time starting goaltender. And he's an UFA next year so if he isn't what a team hoped to be and the team lets him walk, they've wasted picks in a very deep draft class.  Look at Ben Scrivens. He was a damn good backup for Jonathan Quick in 2013-14 when he was out with an injury. After Martin Jones takes over the backup job, Scrivens gets traded to Edmonton. Scrivens becomes one of the league's worst starters, especially since Edmonton has basically no defensemen, unlike LA, who's loaded with good d-men."

They have a similar play style, idk if it would compliment each other or if it would be better to split them up"
hawks,3auj3x,Cartortus,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:46 2015 UTC,In pretty sure TT is a center naturally. Could be wrong though

If he doesn't make the team he's likely to head back to the KHL and not AHL but I doubt the brass would want to see a new toy spend time in the K.  That and after watching him at Worlds, I can't imagine him not making the team."
hawks,3auj3x,Tornsys,3,Tue Jun 23 21:26:37 2015 UTC,I think its in his contract that if he's not on the opening day roster he can go back to the KHL with no penalty.

hawks,3as29e,Stommped,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:22:12 2015 UTC,The thing that confused me was the 7001 number and also +500 being right next to MLB
hawks,3as29e,Symphonize,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"7001 was just the number for that particular bet. It's like ordering fastfood, it is easier for both parties invoked to say I want a #1 meal than to say a Big Mac meal. So you just go up and say I want to bet $10 on #7001 or whatever the number is.   The +500 MLB (Moneyline Bet) are the odds. +500 means a $100 bet wins $500 (so would pay you $500 plus the $100 you bet). If it was -500, that would mean a $500 bet wins $100."
hawks,3as29e,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,7,Tue Jun 23 19:11:30 2015 UTC,I turned $5 before the year into $32.50 with the Hawks win. That'll pay for my hat!
hawks,3as29e,DFuhbree,6,Tue Jun 23 04:17:18 2015 UTC,+500 is terrible for a preseason bet in a 30 team league. I got in at +900 during a slump in February.

hawks,3aur6e,PrisonedMuffin,11,Tue Jun 23 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"I think that there's 4 players on our team that I would personally put in the top 5 at their respected positions.   Keith is the best defenseman Kane is the 2nd best RW Hossa is the 5th best RW Toews is the 3rd best C   Now these are all arguable points, and our boys are damn good hockey players. It's not about where they stack up as individuals but how well they play as a team. That's all they care about."
hawks,3aur6e,NotJayCutler,3,Tue Jun 23 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"I love Hoss (and have his jersey) But I dont see him ranking above Kane, Perry, Kessel, Tarasenko, or Voracek. I'd give him a tie for 6th with Rick Nash."
hawks,3aur6e,Phridgey,2,Tue Jun 23 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"The one thing I've noticed with RW and C is that it's increasingly difficult to put together a top 5 that doesn't seem like you're snubbing somebody. Center especially, there's probably 10 guys who could be arguably top 5."
hawks,3aur6e,NotJayCutler,2,Tue Jun 23 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"This is true. My list also leaves out Ovi, even though he played RW for a good long while. There's just too many variables and too much ""team-fit-variable"" to meaningfully rank just about any player in any position."
hawks,3aur6e,Phridgey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"I put Ovi at LW, that's where he's mostly been."
hawks,3aur6e,NotJayCutler,2,Tue Jun 23 18:41:16 2015 UTC,perhaps list who is in front of these guys?  I say Toews has proved to be the all around best Center in the game.
hawks,3aur6e,ClintEastwood41,4,Tue Jun 23 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"Toews definitely makes a case for best all-around, but Bergeron and Kopitar do as well.  I have Crosby and Malkin ahead of Toews, Perry ahead of Kane, and Nash and Tarasenko ahead of Hossa."
hawks,3aur6e,NotJayCutler,2,Tue Jun 23 18:34:01 2015 UTC,I still think when it counts Toews has the cups and Crosby usually blows up when the pressure is on
hawks,3aur6e,ClintEastwood41,3,Tue Jun 23 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Cups are a team accomplishment. It's no secret that Toews has had significantly better pieces around him. Crosby on the Blackhawks and you'd probably get the same amount, if not more, of cups."
hawks,3aur6e,NotJayCutler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"So many factors to weigh. You mention Keith top at his position ... I agree in all three zones he' amazing.  Its hard to look at the other positions objectively.  I see Ovi and Kaners name being tossed around, but let's be honest with ourselves their role is strictly in the oh-fensive zone.  Same with the center position .. Speaking to the o zone specifically I'd take Sid ... Taking all three zones into consideration ... I'd take Toews."
hawks,3aur6e,1point-21-jigowatz,5,Wed Jun 24 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"In my opinion   Toews is the 2nd best center behind Crosby.  Kane is the 2nd best wing behind Ovi  Hossa is somewhere in the top 8-10 wingers.  Keith right now is the best D-man, but it's close between him and both Doughty and Weber.  I'd put Crawford in the top 10-15 goaltenders"
hawks,3aur6e,cubs2107,0,Wed Jun 24 00:40:01 2015 UTC,Crow in the 10 - 15 goaltender range?  My God there is hope for this sub!  Come'on you 50heads.  Post-it!  I know you're out there wanting to put Crow 1 or 2 .... Post it God Damnit!
hawks,3aur6e,1point-21-jigowatz,3,Wed Jun 24 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"I mean I love Crawford to death, he always seems to show up in the playoffs (other than Nashville this year) and can steal a game or make a big save when we need him to, and I will always argue that he should've won the Conn Smythe in 2013, but for the most part he's just an above average goalie. I do agree that he's getting overpaid though"
hawks,3aur6e,cubs2107,2,Wed Jun 24 15:22:38 2015 UTC,I totally agree he should've won the Con Smythe in 13. If Thomas and Quick wouldn't of one two years in a row it would've been his.

Sure, performance may decline because the new tires will be cold, but eventually they'll heat up and the car will be just as good as it was.

hawks,3aqlyf,theduderman,2,Tue Jun 23 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"I realized that, but they're also the easiest component to change.

hawks,3aqlyf,shiigent,8,Mon Jun 22 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"As a team that's struggled with center depth for a little bit, I'm gonna say that keeping Richards for 1 or 2 hundred K more than he's worth might be a solid investment, especially if we can swing 3+ years out of it. Locking in a solid 2C with experience and a Conn Smythe to his name isn't a bad investment to the core."

hawks,3aqlyf,foofighters92,5,Mon Jun 22 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"Based on what I saw from the Rockford games I went to last season, Pokka is a defensive liability right now. He shoots lasers, and all that... and it's all very sexy. But he's wearing Versteegs old skates (he falls a lot), and he regularly tries to do too much defending a rush, and gets turnstyled hard.  Edit : But he does show flashes here and there. He just needs time. But that's just to my untrained eye... Anyhow, I think more people should be excited about Johns anyway. He looks like an NHLer. Plays physically, and fairly smart from what I saw of him... and if his playoff performance is any indication, he might have a little more offensive ability than we initially thought."

All of them got some great experience this past playoff run.  Even though Runblad and Cumisky had some pretty bad mistakes early on when they got their chances, they both started to settle in and look better the more ice-time they got.  I think all three will get some nice development time during the season next year and will be ready to be full-time contributors during the playoffs."
hawks,3aqlyf,DwayneSmith,5,Tue Jun 23 13:14:46 2015 UTC,I'm personally completely done with Runblad and hope he's gone.  He has the single worst aspect a D man can have.  He won't take a hit to make a play.

hawks,3aqlyf,Patrick_Kane,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:03 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you have to have 22-23 players in roster, and ditching those two means just two players with same kind of cap hit. It doesn't really give any more money to sign anybody else.  That being said, of everything goes perfectly, I can see us being a better team next season. We have a plethora of young dmen who could be NHL ready (Pokka, Johns, TVR etc.) and we got Panarin and we have other young forwards waiting like Hartman. So, as I said, if everything goes perfectly and every single one of those can play a good season, we already have a better team than what we had this year, if we of course presume we can sign Saad, Krüger, Richards and Oduya, which isn't impossible if we trade Sharp and Bickell without any retained salaries or contracts coming our way."

At 5.9M, he's an expensive player on the decline. Plus every team in the NHL knows that the Hawks need to dump salary. If Bowman can get more than a late 2nd round pick for him, I'll be impressed."

hawks,3aq2qx,windycityexpat,11,Mon Jun 22 18:35:44 2015 UTC,What about Sharp to the Rangers for Yandle? It frees up over 3 million in cap space for us and gives us a pretty decent defender.  Rangers get a proven scorer to replace St. Louis who they probably will not re-sign.

Kruger for 2.3 million. Trade Sharp for first rounder and mid level prospect. Trade Bickell for second rounder., Trade Versteeg for third rounder and mid level prospect.  Rundblad traded for fourth rounder. Cuminsky resigns for near minimum as 7th dman. Roszival, Oduya, vermette leave. Our team is still good."

hawks,3arobv,LegendaryWarriorPoet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:41:27 2015 UTC,Rundblad and Bollig didn't have really overpriced contracts attached to them. I think Bickell's contract only gets them a third round pick in return.
hawks,3arobv,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"Fair point. But Bickells also a much much better player. He's a pretty decent third liner. 4 mil a year is high, but not ridiculous for a huge third liner with a good shot and physical part of his game. We'll see. Third rounder wouldn't be so bad if we don't keep any money back in the deal"
hawks,3arobv,LegendaryWarriorPoet,2,Thu Jun 25 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the team he goes to. If the team isn't worried about the cap space or needs to take on money to reach the cap floor (e.g. Arizona), they might be willing to give up a bit more since the cap hit won't be as much of an issue for them."

To make an offer sheet, another team has to possess their ""natural"" draft picks. Meaning if I want to offer a C-level guy an offer sheet, I have to have my own 1st and 3rd rounders for the following draft in my possession. I CANNOT have traded away my first but acquired someone else's. This is my understanding, and it makes the stupid Penguin rumors impossible, because from what I remember, they don't have the picks to even be allowed to do an offer sheet."

hawks,3an0yj,theblackswanson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:05:12 2015 UTC,GravyWagon has ruined the integrity of this subreddit! Away with your sarcasm!!
hawks,3an0yj,newcirclejerkmod,2,Mon Jun 22 13:21:01 2015 UTC,Well now I can upvote it twice.
hawks,3aq6c3,Stommped,4,Mon Jun 22 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"Kyle Baun was not eligible for the playoff roster because he was singed as a Free Agent after the trade deadline.   Unrestricted free agents signed after the trade deadline, including those from the NCAA ranks, are not eligible to play in the NHL playoffs because they were not on the team's 90-man reserve list on the day of the trade deadline. Example: Christian Folin with the Minnesota Wild in 2013-14.   edit: And as far as rings go I'm sure they'll give one to anyone that played a game for the Hawks this year. Clendening only played a few games before being traded so I don't know if they'll give one to him, but they might send one to Smith since he was a deadline deal. I know teams in the past, in hockey and baseball, have given rings to players traded at the deadline."
hawks,3aq6c3,ItsNot1972,3,Mon Jun 22 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"There's no rule about rings, it depends on the owner.  They don't even have to give rings to the players, although of course they do.  But the price of each ring and total number ordered vary quite a bit.  There can also be grades of rings, with some fancier than others (and the less fancy ones given non-players)."
hawks,3aq6c3,wjbc,3,Mon Jun 22 18:13:37 2015 UTC,A friend of the family worked as an unpaid intern for the team in 2013 and even he got a ring. Pretty much was just a coffee fetcher so I'd imagine just about everyone gets a ring.
hawks,3aq6c3,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Mon Jun 22 18:39:04 2015 UTC,"But not the top grade one given to the players, right?"
hawks,3aq6c3,wjbc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't get to see any of the players' rings in person, but the ring he got looked similar... So unless they used different stones or something it was the same."

hawks,3aq6c3,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:07:31 2015 UTC,Have a friend who works in season. Ticket sales and has the same ring as the players for 2013. Its usually less but Rocky really took care of them at least on 13.
hawks,3aq6c3,trapper2530,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:22:35 2015 UTC,"Teams definitely get ring happy. I remember in 2005 after the Sox won they gave rings to staff members on the AAA, AA and A minor league teams. My best friend's neighbor was the batboy that season and got the same ring as the players. A 15 year-old with a WS ring, had to clean up in high school."

hawks,3aq3n8,Daltonkb,3,Mon Jun 22 16:32:04 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the sense in Seabrook. Not that he's not a good leader, but Captains and Alternates are in charge of talking to the referee, and when he's always paired with another Alternate what's the point? Regardless the locker room is stacked with leadership whether they literally wear it on their sleeve or not."
hawks,3aq3n8,MorningWoodWorker,5,Mon Jun 22 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"Seabrook and Keith are only even paired together about 50% of the time at this point, if even that."
hawks,3aq3n8,buddhabash,3,Mon Jun 22 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but then you have two D men as alternate captains. And I can't think of any other team that does that, let alone as a semi-common pairing. It just seems weird is all, but that's just me.  Edit: Couple teams do have two D men as alternate captains, but that is because they elect to have three alternates with no captain."
hawks,3aq3n8,MorningWoodWorker,6,Mon Jun 22 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"I definitely can understand the logic in your post. I simply see that whenever an ""A"" is needed when someone doesnt dress, he is the one  that always gets it."

hawks,3aq3n8,ChicagoIce,7,Mon Jun 22 17:04:32 2015 UTC,Seabs  Hoss  Hammer  Kaner  In that order.
hawks,3aq3n8,ChaplnGrillSgt,21,Mon Jun 22 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"Alternate, not assistant. Not a big deal, but we might as well call it what it is.  At this point, I would guess Seabrook. If not him, then either Hossa or Saad."

hawks,3aq3n8,computer_monk,11,Mon Jun 22 16:53:30 2015 UTC,No it's not your bad. I've been playing hockey all my life and both are completely acceptable ways to say it. People get picky when they think they're big hockey fans.
hawks,3aq3n8,jmr33090,0,Tue Jun 23 04:06:30 2015 UTC,"No worries, this is I think the third thread for this discussion that said ""assistant"" instead of ""alternate."""

hawks,3aq3n8,Chi_Sox_Hawks,4,Mon Jun 22 16:33:25 2015 UTC,Hossa. Seabrook's future in Chicago isn't known.   Honorable mention to Saad.
hawks,3aq3n8,M_is_for_Mancy,4,Mon Jun 22 18:16:33 2015 UTC,Why not Saad? If he is willing to take a cut to stay with us and we obviously understand how important he is to us staying on the level we are currently at. I feel like with his age and current attitude we could give it to him now and use it to mold him into the next Hossa. Rather then give it to Hossa on the tail end of his career give it to baby Hossa so he knows early and often what they think he can be. #VoteForManChild
hawks,3aq3n8,Hard58Core,3,Tue Jun 23 06:32:43 2015 UTC,"Seabrook, probably.  This is assuming we're able to hold on to him."
hawks,3aq3n8,hchux,3,Mon Jun 22 17:19:30 2015 UTC,I'm surprised this is still being asked...  Seabrook - 93%  Hossa - 5%  The field - 2%

hawks,3aq3n8,Templescio,0,Thu Jun 25 21:06:10 2015 UTC,I would assume Kane.
hawks,3aq3n8,Sparx7,11,Mon Jun 22 16:32:33 2015 UTC,He doesn't seem like the leadership type. Seabrook imo
hawks,3aq3n8,LTComedy,-7,Mon Jun 22 16:51:31 2015 UTC,Kaner doesn't deserve the A sadly

hawks,3aq3n8,LTComedy,-2,Tue Jun 23 06:56:28 2015 UTC,He's obviously a leader of this team.
hawks,3aq3n8,computer_monk,5,Mon Jun 22 20:27:45 2015 UTC,I'm not disputing that at all dude. He has said in the past he didn't want it. That's all I'm saying.
hawks,3aq3n8,scrivenerserror,0,Mon Jun 22 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Kane is a leader, and shows it immensely in his game. Every time Johnny is asked about Kane he says he leads by example on the ice."
hawks,3aq3n8,computer_monk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:10:59 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean he wants the role, though."
hawks,3aq3n8,scrivenerserror,0,Tue Jun 23 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"What he does on the ice has nothing to do with whether he wants it or not. /r/mbetter said he's an obvious leader of this team, and got downvoted.. When you think about the face of the hawks, you think of kane and toews."
hawks,3aq3n8,hlainelarkinmk2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"That's not what I said though -- I just said it doesn't mean he wants it. I assume players are allowed to turn this down if they don't want it? Or at least their feelings may have already been expressed before the decision is made.   I completely agree -- he is a leader of the team in a lot of ways and I definitely think of him and Toews first, but none of this means he wants the specific role and the duties that come with it when it's ""official""."
hawks,3aq3n8,patlikesjuice,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:45:36 2015 UTC,Depends on who re signs with the team. I think possibly Vermette could if he stays

hawks,3anfth,LifeUhhhFindsAWay,23,Sun Jun 21 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"Q spoke very highly of him and Baun on a Sportsnet radio show the other day, he said he is excited to have them next year, I heard Scotty Bowman on a TSN show saying Panarin will probably be a top 6 or top 9 next year on the Hawks, so it looks like the Hawks management are banking on him making the roster next year, let's just hope he can transfer his talent into the NHL"
hawks,3anfth,LouChainz88,7,Sun Jun 21 23:04:55 2015 UTC,If Scotty says it then I believe it!
hawks,3anfth,ClintEastwood41,4,Sun Jun 21 23:23:13 2015 UTC,Scotty Scotty I believe
hawks,3anfth,Mad_Hatter_Bot,14,Mon Jun 22 05:18:04 2015 UTC,With his contract he either makes the team or goes back to Russia so I'll be amazed if he isn't in the lineup.
hawks,3anfth,Purx,7,Sun Jun 21 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"Panarin AND Baun in the lineup next year, lets hope they fit in and have some chemistry with the guys. Anyone know what kind of forward Baun is?"
hawks,3anfth,foofighters92,4,Sun Jun 21 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"He played a bit later on in the season. Only reason he didn't play in the playoffs was due to being signed after the trade deadline.  Big body, seemed to have a decent offensive side. i'd imagine a Bickell lite (or better bickell considering he costs about 3 million less.)"
hawks,3anfth,MyNeckHurts,6,Mon Jun 22 02:31:17 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping that he turns into Tarasenko. Can you imagine Panarin-Tuevo-Kane on the same line?   Panarin is a LW, Tuevo's natural position is Center and Kane of course is a RW.  Tuevo needs to bulk up a little bit to be an effective center, but if that happens, that second line would be deadly."
hawks,3anfth,GuyOnTheLake,8,Mon Jun 22 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"Panarin's greatest strength is his incredibly fast one timer. With how good Kane and TT are at setting up incredible plays, he's gonna be filthy."
hawks,3anfth,Phridgey,6,Mon Jun 22 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"I was watching some highlights today, a video I found showcasing both Teuvo and Panarin, and you're 100% right.  Their puck moving skills, and his ability to find a spot and completely murder the puck when it comes to him will be absolutely filthy. His handles and skating aren't anything to scoff at either, just not at the level of 88 and 86."
hawks,3anfth,Coop3,2,Mon Jun 22 04:52:04 2015 UTC,I have been saying since the moment we signed him that is our second line next year. It will be a filthy line.
hawks,3anfth,Djarum,2,Mon Jun 22 05:28:39 2015 UTC,Is Baun playing C or Wing?
hawks,3anfth,Cartortus,4,Mon Jun 22 00:08:27 2015 UTC,RW according to eliteprospects
hawks,3anfth,STLL217,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:01:05 2015 UTC,LW - Panarin  C - Hartman RW - Baun  Line? Thoughts?
hawks,3anfth,Cartortus,6,Mon Jun 22 01:09:55 2015 UTC,"Very inexperienced. The future looks bright but I think I personally would spread out the new guys a bit, at least in the beginning, so they could play with some more experienced guys. Like Q did with the D in the regular season by splitting Keith and Seabs.  Edit: I think Panarin is a LW btw. And I read that as Panarin-TT-Baun. So after reading it again, yeah that could work, but I don't know so much about Baun so maybe someone else should answer that question."
hawks,3anfth,STLL217,2,Mon Jun 22 08:45:59 2015 UTC,"It would be an interesting line, but we'd be more likely to see a LW Panarin C Versteeg RW Baun and the Tuevo playing LW with Richards and Kane. Then Hartman would probably be a heathy scratch or playing with Desi and Shaw if we cannot resign Kruger"
hawks,3anfth,Cartortus,3,Mon Jun 22 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's plausible. I hope we see some Hartman tho, I liked him from what I saw this season. As for Krüger, nope we're re-signing Krüger! If anyone is saying anything different I can't hear you LALALALALA  Edit: Words"
hawks,3anfth,STLL217,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:26:59 2015 UTC,Hartman is not a center
hawks,3anfth,ClintEastwood41,0,Mon Jun 22 14:14:51 2015 UTC,Shaw can play center and the Hartman on RW
hawks,3anfth,Cartortus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:48:36 2015 UTC,Did he cover Richards for a bit when he was out though?
hawks,3anfth,Coop3,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't have a good enough memory to recall that.."
hawks,3anfth,STLL217,2,Mon Jun 22 08:40:35 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked if he didn't make the team. Could stand to put on some muscle but is very skilled. Was around a ppg in iihf this year iirc.   Plus he has that ot gwg thing goin already   http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cZJtJRWAqkU

hawks,3anfth,nbozich,0,Tue Jun 23 21:51:19 2015 UTC,His contract states that if he doesn't make the roster he gets sent back to the KHL so he can keep playing. I'm sure they'll at least play him to see how he does before giving up on him and sending him back home.

hawks,3akrzd,Rabid_Llama8,58,Sun Jun 21 09:38:00 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works. They let you touch it at the Hockey Hall of Fame and bring it to many charity events where kids put their hands all over it.   The tradition is more along the lines of, if you're a professional hockey player you shouldn't touch it before winning it and no matter who you are you're not supposed to hoist it over your head without winning it."
hawks,3akrzd,taz20075,17,Sun Jun 21 13:03:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that makes sense then. Thanks for clearing that up :-)"
hawks,3akrzd,TheMagicalDonkey,-11,Sun Jun 21 13:04:36 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, I saw it at the HOF and I refused to touch it.  Touching it just didn't feel right."

hawks,3akrzd,discometalstu,5,Sun Jun 21 13:04:34 2015 UTC,No it's if you play hockey and hope to win it one day you don't touch it. But if you're washed up like me and the dream is dead you can touch the hell out of it.
hawks,3akrzd,jrdnism,3,Sun Jun 21 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"As said elsewhere, it's different in hockey. However, out of personal respect for the guys that DID win it, I won't freaking touch it.

hawks,3akrzd,DancingNancy4136,-9,Sun Jun 21 11:28:31 2015 UTC,"I would love to have the chance to touch Lord Stanley's Cup, but I've also come to terms with the fact that I never will.  To me it is disrespectful to the guys that worked their asses off for their own chances.  I've heard that if someone that did win it gives you permission to touch it then you can, but I haven't heard that from a hockey player."
hawks,3akrzd,HIGHHAMMER,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:43:43 2015 UTC,"They literally take the cup everywhere for people to touch and take pictures with. If it were taboo, they wouldn't do that. You can touch it all you want, the honor of HOISTING it is what is reserved for winners only."
hawks,3akrzd,IAm_Raptor_Jesus_AMA,-1,Tue Jun 23 13:19:03 2015 UTC,Heard once that it's bad luck to touch it if you you didn't earn it. Somethin along the lines of no one in your family will ever win it. But who knows. Maybe I was drunk.

hawks,3akrzd,thorofasgard,-7,Sun Jun 21 15:37:44 2015 UTC,Far too many bodily fluids have been in that cup for me to ever drink from it.

hawks,3akrzd,Cockatiel,10,Sun Jun 21 14:05:49 2015 UTC,There's a lot of things that have been cleaned that I'm still not drinking out of.

hawks,3akrzd,asundevil,20,Sun Jun 21 16:30:04 2015 UTC,"its a superstition more than anything else, and it really only applies to players who have the ability to win it."
hawks,3akrzd,sonicscrewdriveher,26,Sun Jun 21 04:46:28 2015 UTC,If you don't earn it you're not supposed to hoist it. If you're a hockey player or want to be one or your parents think you might be then you don't touch it.
hawks,3akrzd,Bears54,-6,Sun Jun 21 05:14:59 2015 UTC,Maybe that's why some of these guys never win it. They touched the cup as a small child and never knew or something!

hawks,3akrzd,Cockatiel,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, thanks for clarifying that for me. I had the understanding that only the champions were suppose to drink from the cup. I was not aware that they could give permissions to others to drink from it as well. I always thought that was a cool hockey ritual. Is this the same for hoisting the cup? Are non-champions allowed to hoist the cup with the players permission?  How much is this tradition honored? If someone did it without the champions permission would they be scolded or worse?   Pretty new to hockey, been watching 3 years now. Thanks!"

hawks,3aifsb,monkeymatt1836,48,Sat Jun 20 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"Site is going up and down from our reddit hug.  here is the article JIC.  On Dec. 5, 2005, a trade was consummated that didn’t make much of a dent on the NHL radar.  As Tim Panaccio wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer, “[the] Flyers and Blackhawks surprisingly swapped part of their futures last night as center Patrick Sharp was sent to Chicago for rookie right winger Matt Ellison.”  The story goes on to quote then-Flyers GM Bob Clarke on the deal.  “We felt that with all the injuries we have had that Matt would bring more versatility to our lineup,” said Bob Clarke, the Flyers’ general manager. “He can play center and wing. We always felt that Patrick was a better center. We have lots of centers, even though we have some injuries right now. We just felt that Matt was a better fit for our team, although we realize that we gave up a good young player.”  Buried by Ken Hitchcock, Sharp was unceremoniously dumped by the center-heavy Flyers in an effort to bring in a wing that, in the eyes of the Philly media and front office, had a chance to make a more immediate impact.  Ellison would go on to play seven more games in his NHL career.  Sharp would lead the resurrection of the Chicago Blackhawks.  Sharp COL  And I do mean it when I use the word “lead.” Sharp joined a 2005-06 Blackhawks roster that was highlighted by the Arnason-Bell-Calder line, and featured talented players including Rene Bourque and Radim Vrbata.  That roster also included a 31-year-old Martin Lapointe, a 32-year-old Matthew Barnaby and saw four goaltenders see action in the Indian Head. (Note: two of those goaltenders were Craig Anderson and Corey Crawford, both of whom are still in the NHL today.)  Three players on that 2005-06 Hawks team surpassed the 40-point plateau. That’s 40 points… not goals or assists. Points. In a full, 82-game NHL season. Calder’s 59 points led the team, as did his 26 goals. Only two Blackhawks players (Calder and Bell) reached the 20-goal benchmark that season as well.  Sharp, then just 23, scored nine goals and added 14 assists in 50 games to begin his Hawks career. And lots of people wondered who the kid was wearing Tony Amonte’s number.  Chicago owned the third overall pick in the 2006 NHL Draft, and used it on a center. Sharp was supposedly expendable because Philadelphia had too many centers, so the refrain must have felt all too familiar in his second NHL city. But this kid, was headed back to North Dakota for at least one more season, so Sharp wouldn’t have to compete for ice time with Jonathan Toews quite yet.  The other big news in the summer of 2006 was Hawks GM Dale Tallon somehow getting a decent free agent to consider Chicago. Marty Havlat joined the team and helped elevate the offense with Sharp. They scored 25 and 20 goals, respectively, in a 2006-07 season that saw Trent Yawney get the axe and Hall of Famer Denis Savard called upon to coach the team he once led.  But the Hawks were still bottom dwellers, and as such would make the first overall pick in the NHL Draft for the first time in team history during the summer of 2007.  That pick, a curly haired kid from Buffalo who also happened to be named Patrick, would come straight to Chicago and bring the previous summer’s top pick with him.  Kane and Toews joined Sharp for the 2007-08 season, and the renaissance began. Sharp led the team that year with 36 goals and they somehow, miraculously, won 40 games.  More wheeling and dealing during that season added names like Ladd and Eager, and other homegrown youngsters like a 22-year-old Brent Seabrook and 24-year-old Duncan Keith were starting to come into their own.  Two years after 59 points led the team, Kane (72) and Sharp (62) led a suddenly interesting Blackhawks team. Four players reached the 20-goal plateau that season, and eight – including three defensemen – had at least 30 points.  The 2008-09 season brought another change behind the bench, as Savard gave way to Joel Quenneville. Sharp was limited to 61 games but still scored 26 goals and the Blackhawks did the unthinkable: they qualified for the playoffs.  And not only did they get into the postseason party, but the Hawks ran all the way to the Western Conference Final – where they ran into a powerhouse defending champion from Detroit which had a superstar named Marian Hossa. The Wings were – as always – too much for the baby-faced Blackhawks, but the first playoff run in a decade put a no-longer-vacant United Center on display.  patrick sharp  Of course the following season was one for the history books, and the following five seasons have been historic as the Blackhawks have become an in-progress dynasty.  And one of the few constants, from the blowout losses in front of 5,000 fans to the three Stanley Cup parades, has been Sharp.  Unfortunately, the NHL’s salary cap has not risen as quickly as the talent in the Blackhawks organization, and Sharp will be the highest profile cap casualty to date.  Sharp finished the 2014-15 season with 511 points as a member of the Blackhawks, which currently ranks 15th in the history of the franchise. His 239 regular season goals rank 11th, only four behind Pit Martin to qualify for the organization’s all-time top ten. Sharp’s 38 game-winning goals are eighth in team history and his 16 short-handed goals rank sixth in the history of the Chicago Blackhawks.  When he arrived, postseason production from any Hawks player was only a dream. But with Sharp in the core, this team has surpassed any of our wildest hopes for the franchise.  Sharpie will leave tied with Doug Wilson for seventh in team history with 80 postseason points. His 42 playoff goals are sixth in team history, and his five postseason game-winning goals in the Indian head are as many as Bobby or Dennis Hull, Jim Pappin and Darryl Sutter produced here.  He won three Stanley Cups here, and was named an All-Star Game MVP. He also won a gold medal for Canada.  The Blackhawks – and their fans – have failed when sending away iconic players in the history of the franchise like Steve Larmer, Doug Wilson and Jeremy Roenick. In 2010, many of the players who departed were still young and developing into the NHL stars some of them have become today. And after 2013, the exodus was much smaller.  Now, we have an opportunity to act appropriately as one of the best leaves us.  In the future, fans will ask “who is this Amonte guy wearing Sharpie’s number?” And, someday, someone else will probably receive the number. But what we cannot forget is that Patrick Sharp is one of the finest to ever represent the Chicago Blackhawks."

He's just been such a huge part of this team and their identity the last decade; he's going to be leaving a huge hole behind. I really hope this is a temporary two year move and he signs a reasonable contract back here once this contract is over and the salary cap hopefully goes up the way it should have the last few years.

hawks,3aifsb,HTWC,5,Sat Jun 20 14:57:59 2015 UTC,"I know he's most likely going to be gone. But could he stay in Chicago if he really wanted to/Hawks really wanted to keep him?  I was shocked to learn the other day, that unlike in the NFL for example, a player can't redo his contract & take less or something if he really wanted to stay with the team/they wanted him as well."
hawks,3aifsb,sonicscrewdriveher,2,Sat Jun 20 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"Only way to keep Sharp would be to to move Crawford, which, despite how unbelievably clutch he was at times, is the right move to me. Raanta and Darling are both high quality and cost next to nothing while Crawford is getting 6 million. I think it'd be easier to move Crow and that they'd get more for him if they did, but I'm gonna trust the front office. I know a lot about hockey, but they know a lot more."
hawks,3aifsb,HTWC,3,Sun Jun 21 00:22:33 2015 UTC,It feels like a real risk/reward thing to me. If they got rid of Crawford and Darling/Raanta step up then it would pay off huge but I think it's equally possible that neither of those guys will end up being a great replacement. Getting rid of Sharp instead is a less risky route to take.
hawks,3aifsb,thesch,-1,Sun Jun 21 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"Remember that 42 shot shutout Darling had in 3 periods of playoff hockey? You can't teach ""big"" and at 6'6"" Darling has that. I like what I've seen from both. Scoring has been a problem at times for the Hawks and Sharp can help with that. I think he tried to come back too soon from his injury and that explains his loss of production and third line demotion. He's also the 3rd shooter on the shoutout and I don't think Saad will fare better than Sharp has. You're right that it's the cautious move, but I prefer the high risk/reward model.   Edit: Don't downvote me here; argue with me! I'm making decent points and not being irrelevant, so refute me with reason instead of downvoting!"

hawks,3aifsb,sharptoes,4,Sat Jun 20 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Patrick Sharp makes a lot of money, and from my understanding there is only one or two years left on his contract, and his contract is bottom heavy which I guess means that he gets paid more in the last two years than he did the rest of the contract. The salary cap is the limit for the Hawks to pay players, and they have a lot of players that are expensive, and while these guys are certainly worth the money, somebody has to go. And in rankings of who is most important to the Hawks in terms of shooting for another Stanley Cup, and what the team needs, sharp is unfortunately not toward the top of the list, and the organization could get more bang for buck elsewhere. I don't want the guys to go, I wish we could keep the exact lineup we had this year sans Rozsival and Bickell, and obviously was a replacement for Timmonen, but the salary cap is just an unfortunate part of the chess match that is a hockey organization. Also, someone should totally correct me if any of this is wrong, I am not super knowledgeable about how contracts work and such."

hawks,3aifsb,HTWC,4,Sun Jun 21 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"obviously Oduya   I dunno about that, we have a lot of D prospects. I think Kruger is more of a must sign that 27."

I don't think you know what you are taking about, especially since Shaw can center that 4th line and play hard-nosed forward defense the way Kruger has.  Runblad was terrible, Van Reims was too and Cumisky was a problem as well. WE WON THE CUP DESPITE TIMMO, NOT BECAUSE. How many games did we see that 6'7"" Swede play? Defense is obviously our biggest weakness and Oduya is vastly more important than Kruger, not the least of which because he plays so well with his countryman Hammer."
hawks,3aifsb,HTWC,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:45:04 2015 UTC,"Oduya makes 3.375m this year, and he's going to want more. We simply can't afford it when we have cheaper prospects waiting in the wings, and we need to resign Saad, maybe Richards, maybe Desjardins, and depth. Rundblad is an RFA, so we might re-sign him, TvR is staying, not sure on Cumiskey.  2-7  4-57  Rundblad, Cumiskey, Pokka, Johns, Paliotta, Svedberg, maybe a cheap veteran FA are gonna have to fill the last two spots because I don't see any way keep Oduya and stay under the cap."
hawks,3aifsb,jerry200890,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:33:21 2015 UTC,"We need to resign Saad, but Richards is slow and doesn't win faceoffs like Vermette, so Vermy is clearly the one we need to sign. Let Desjardin walk.  You just can't have TvR as an untested 2nd pairing, especially after how clutch Oduya's been for us. So signing Oduya is a must, because he works with Hammer so well, and allows room for that vital Keith/Biscuit pairing. With TvR, you'd have to break that pair up a lot and we lose something in the process. I respect your takes, I just disagree wildly. I think if we move Crow at the apex of his perceived value, we can comfortably afford 27, 20 & 80."

""I remember each of us players got a bunch of business cards,"" he recalls. ""You know, 'Patrick Sharp, Chicago Blackhawks.' We were supposed to hand them out wherever we went. Restaurants, car wash, whatever. On the back, there was a place where people could contact for two free tickets to selected games.""   This stuff actually happened. Blackhawks players would hand them out to random people and have to introduce themselves as Blackhawks players because people didn't know who the heck they were."
hawks,3aeldk,honestbleeps,15,Fri Jun 19 18:05:45 2015 UTC,A good read as to why....
hawks,3aeldk,_Guinness,20,Fri Jun 19 19:36:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone gets so defensive when people point out how irrelevant the Hawks were to Chicago a decade ago. Yes, there were good reasons why, but I think we're all still ashamed. The important thing is that that never happens again, especially when this golden age ends"
hawks,3aeldk,CurlyNippleHairs,9,Fri Jun 19 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"I started going to games in 07. Not because things changed. But because I had just moved to the city, and it was something great to do in the winter.  But I don't fault anyone for not knowing the hawks before all the changes went down. They weren't even on TV! How do you even care about a team when you cant watch them?   People don't use radio anymore. So you have a whole generation who never was exposed to hockey or the hawks. This is the first rule of recruiting: There are three types of recruits  1) Someone who doesn't know about the greater industry(in this case, NHL) you reside in, and they aren't sure if they want to be a part of said industry  2) Someone who is aware of the greater industry (NHL) and wants to be a part of it. But they aren't specifically sold on being a part of your individual slice(in this case, team) of said industry.  3) Someone who knows the industry(NHL) and knows what specific slice (team) they want to be a part of.  You can't have a fanbase when everyone is a level 1 ""recruit"" or worse. You have to sell hockey before you can sell yourselves. And having a TV deal solved that problem."

hawks,3aeldk,LegacyLemur,3,Fri Jun 19 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"It wasn't all that long ago that getting free Hawks tickets was relatively easy. I remember going to two games for free back when the likes of Wisnewski were on the team because my mom won a couple radio giveaways for them. U.C. was empty. If you weren't there then you truly can't appreciate how irrelevant the team was.  I don't remember it word for word, but the Wolves used to have a marketing slogan of something like ""We play hockey a different way: We win"" because of how little Chicago thought of the Hawks.  Fuck the Wolves."

Johnny isn't a great leader because he makes Herb Brooks' speeches. It's becuase he works hard every shift and prepres hard every day. Kane does too.   Hossa has what 8 more years on his contract? If anyone in the league is capable of playing that late it's Jagr, Keith and Hossa."
hawks,3aeldk,Patrick_Kane,11,Fri Jun 19 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"As per usual, I completely agree with you. We watched wild child Kane join this team all those years ago. He was still raw talent in 2010, by 2013 you could already tell he had grown so much as a team player, still ""Showtime"" but he spent way more time raising up the people around him. The whole team looks better for having Kane around and no doubt he has developed the maturity to wear the A full time."

That said, he is in no way close to a two way player.  Your flair has clouded your opinion on his back and fore checking.  As I mentioned before  .. You want your C and A's to be leaders... Especially by example.  Kaner comes up to me wearing an A and tells me I need to work harder in the fore and back check ... I'm going to laugh in his face.  Tazer comes up to me and tells mei need to work harder in the fore and back check ... I'm going to piss down my leg and go out and play harder in the fore and back check.  Again, don't take what many people in the league as a knock on Kaner ... It's not his role.  His roles to get puck and make offensive play.  That's all."
hawks,3aeldk,1point-21-jigowatz,3,Sat Jun 20 03:38:49 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't Kane want the A?   And I'm sure Kane is more a leader than some of the super young kids who are given Cs or As very early in their careers (~20 years old)

If this was 2010 and they had just won the first cup in a generation (or 2) I'd be freaking out, but as it is, Stan has shown that the Hawks can replace key members with young new guys and remain competitive.

hawks,3aeldk,Quotered,5,Fri Jun 19 16:41:46 2015 UTC,A low first and a mid-tier prospect if I had to guess.

But there is no better time for him to be traded. His stats have been dramatically decreasing the past 2 seasons. Im bummed as fuck about it, but the hawks' trading always excites me considering the past few seasons. Cant wait to see who we get to bring aboard the dynasty!  You'll be missed Sharpie."
hawks,3aeldk,Need_Febreze,2,Fri Jun 19 19:17:21 2015 UTC,Gonna miss that dude so much. I'm happy that he got to raise the cup a third time as a Blackhawk. I will never forget that motherfucker and his beautiful face. I hope he knows how much we all love and appreciate him.

hawks,3aeldk,discometalstu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I don't think he'll come to Toronto. I love Sharpie but he's getting older. Toronto almost always picked up the older, former great players.  For once our management might be smart."
hawks,3aeldk,Bambam005,3,Fri Jun 19 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"I think Sharpie is the last player you guys wanna trade for considering Stan is asking for young prospects/ a pick, and you guys are trying to look for those not trade them away"

I mean he isn't worth much value because of the year he had but Sharpy can defiantly perform. I think there was a lot on Sharp and the team in general this year. You could tell after the passing of Clint. Just saying. People were saying pretty rough things about the guy."
hawks,3aeldk,xburkex219,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:27:23 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with his value and play. it's the fact that he is due 6.5M next year and there are other up and coming guys that need contracts

hawks,3ah1jm,jacksonvstheworld,3,Sat Jun 20 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about Panarin but Kaner's really evolved on the defensive side of things. Obviously, he's not Hossa but he's not a liability out there anymore. Teuvo is... alright out there too. I'm sure he'll get better defensively as he gets older. The line might benefit a little more next year from Saad playing on the second line and maybe moving Panarin or Steeg to the first line."
hawks,3ah1jm,CAKEDONTLIE,5,Sat Jun 20 17:51:50 2015 UTC,If Richards comes back he'll probably be with kaner and that line becomes a lot more 2-way

hawks,3ah1jm,MoistKumquat,2,Sat Jun 20 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming the cap goes up to the projected $71 million it's supposed to, then keeping Oduya is a possibility if he signs for about $3.75 million. This way the defense corps isn't so young and inexperienced.  I may have made a spreadsheet about the hawks cap situation for this upcoming year, lol."
hawks,3ah1jm,1point-21-jigowatz,5,Sun Jun 21 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"It would be a Christmas miracle to sign Vermy.  He was 1/2 scoring for the Yotes past few years.  You see his f/o ability.  He had a slow start but really a nice playoff run.  Just read a story about Sabermetrics in hockey and how teams are using face off winning percentages and guys on ice during a face offmwin as a key metric in building teams.   Needless to say would love a Vermy sign, but I highly doubt it.  Desi on the other hand I think would be a nice one to chase.  He really meshed with that fourth line and emptied his tank out there.  He came late in the season and there is little fighting in playoff hockey ... But he will and does drop the gloves as needed.  Could be a role Car Bomb had last year ... Only Desi is a better skater ... More hockey talent .... Is in control of his play ... And he isn't an absolute idiot like Car Bomb.  I think this would be a nice re-sign."
hawks,3ah1jm,bowhunter2995,4,Sat Jun 20 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"I would love to keep Vermette on the team, he absolutely killed it for us in the playoffs and had insane faceoff stats in the series against the Ducks and Lighting. The only way he will stay on the team is if he takes a lot less money than other teams are going to offer him."
hawks,3ah1jm,B1995,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:12:50 2015 UTC,"With all vermettes gwg I really want to keep him. He was instrumental in the playoff run. Desi has great heart and a physical presence as well, would like to keep him."

hawks,3acq89,Moose_Dookie,18,Fri Jun 19 01:19:40 2015 UTC,He was going crazy during the parade. Fist pumping and getting the crowd to scream louder. He was having himself an amazing time and I'm SO happy for him. We roared so loud for him when his bus passed.
hawks,3acq89,HawkeytownShelby,15,Fri Jun 19 04:47:38 2015 UTC,Thank you from a Flyers fan on getting this guy a cup! The classiest and most down to earth player in hockey and deserved this! He was amazing to watch while he was in Philly and could not be happier he was able to skate off the ice a champion... Also kudos to Toews who gave the cup to Kimmo right away and then told him to skate it around.  Could not be happier for him! Once again thanks Hawks!
hawks,3acq89,Goldendome88,24,Fri Jun 19 09:17:52 2015 UTC,"I wish we had him for some years during his prime, he seems like a really cool dude."
hawks,3acq89,demafrost,27,Fri Jun 19 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"For the short time he's been here, the fans sure like him. Crowd went crazy at the rally when he was announced."
hawks,3acq89,myjunksonfire,17,Fri Jun 19 02:16:39 2015 UTC,do those bad moments matter anymore?
hawks,3acq89,hurrikaner,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"No tougher than any of the other options. And atleast his are due to being old, not being straight up terrible."
hawks,3acq89,Templescio,-1,Fri Jun 19 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"Who are you referring to? Who on our team was ""straight up terrible""?"
hawks,3acq89,JGolden32,4,Fri Jun 19 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"Runbad. Was far and away a worse choice. Kimmo didn't make stupid plays, he just wasn't fast enough to make great ones."
hawks,3acq89,Templescio,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"And regardless of his play this season, his body of work as an NHL and international hockey player over 20+ years is top notch.  There's a reason why this guy was still in the league at 40, and why he was given a shot on a Stanley Cup contender.  He earned the right to get the benefit of the doubt on a few poor plays that ultimately didn't cost the team anything."
hawks,3acq89,icanhazpbr,12,Fri Jun 19 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I know it was easy to goad on him for performance issues (though as it stood he was better than the other options we had), but we understood what he went through. Hell he's kinda risking his life by playing now. Just glad we gave him something to take with him in retirement. But yeah I looked more into him, he seems really cool and Philly fans really adore him (no past tense there)."
hawks,3acq89,nameless22,2,Sat Jun 20 08:12:28 2015 UTC,"He is a really good dude, and was a phenomenal player too. Watching him in his prime was a treat as a Flyers fan. Guy is the best teammate and player you could ask for."
hawks,3acq89,lion27,9,Fri Jun 19 05:57:40 2015 UTC,You can just feel his happiness and joy.. :)
hawks,3acq89,teaghlach61,8,Fri Jun 19 15:15:01 2015 UTC,"I think he had the team sign his jersey, on the back in the numbers, I swore I saw black ink."
hawks,3acq89,Squabbles123,10,Fri Jun 19 04:32:52 2015 UTC,Yep! A buncha the players signed each others jerseys according to the Hawks twitter
hawks,3acq89,masterofstuff328,5,Fri Jun 19 05:31:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I can confirm that I somehow got pretty close and it was noticeable.
hawks,3acq89,14xman1996,4,Fri Jun 19 05:40:02 2015 UTC,Yup! They did it in 2013 as well. It's a good way to remember the team you won with. If one of those hit he market it would fetch a pretty penny.
hawks,3acq89,remz07twos,3,Fri Jun 19 07:20:20 2015 UTC,He looks so happy he's about to explode in every picture since the game ended.  Is there a player on that team that this meant more too? I doubt it.
hawks,3acq89,materhern,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:08:49 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they get him to come back for the convention. I'm sure he'd have a blast there.

hawks,3aeor8,Lystrodom,6,Fri Jun 19 21:21:20 2015 UTC,A team staff member came through the VIP section of yesterday's rally and allowed people to try on his 2013 Stanley Cup ring. I feel like the look on my face is pure joy!
hawks,3aeor8,remz07twos,5,Fri Jun 19 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"Nice! I did some work with the Wirtz company around the 2013 cup and the home opener after that. In the executive bar during one of the intermissions, a coworker of mine just kind of grabbed the 2010 ring from one of the Wirtzs and put it on. He was showing it off (wearing the 2013 ring) but not exactly offering it.  She may have been kind of drunk, what with the free booze in the bar. (But man was the tip jar full of $20s)"

hawks,3aetyd,ClintEastwood41,4,Fri Jun 19 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"I made this a while ago. Assume we manage to get a late-first or early-second round picks, I really like what I've heard/seen from these guys.    Jordan Greenway - LW (18, 6’5’’, 225 lbs)  Dennis Yan – LW (18, 6’2’’, 192 lbs)  Alexander Dergachev – C (19, 6’4’’, 200 lbs)  Jeremey Roy – D (18, 6’0’’, 186 lbs)  Christian Fischer – RW (18, 6’1’’, 212 lbs)   Nicolas Meloche – D (18, 6’2’’, 192 lbs)  Jonas Siegenthaler – D (18, 6’2’’, 220 lbs)  Thomas Novak – C (18, 6’1’’, 181 lbs)  Daniel Sprong – RW (18, 6’0’’, 191 lbs) Thomas Chabot – D (18, 6’2’’, 180 lbs)   I feel like, especially if we are in fact moving Bickell, we need to draft someone with some serious size and ability to take the body. Players like Bickell, while often unsung, are quite valuable come playoff time, and seems to be the one area in our prospect pipeline that we lack many options.  All of these guys have high upside, can take and/or dish out hits, and most of them have a decent offensive upside (Primarily the forwards).  The defensemen I chose are all known for their puck moving abilities, the type of player that would be ideal to develop especially if Oduya is not re-signed. Chabot especially is a guy to keep your eye on in this regard.  Some of these guys have been projected to go in the mid to late first round, which could be a bit of a stretch. However, we of all fanbases should realize that almost any prospect can fall far enough come draft day (Looking at you Saader and Taco)."
hawks,3aetyd,screamineagle411,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, and I want to point out that we have Mashinter in Rockford, big guy who can move the puck and can agitate. Also Hartman delivering some hits. Those two with Shaw just getting under people's skin should be awesome to witness. So of those forwards any of them effective two way forwards?"
hawks,3aetyd,screamineagle411,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of them are as of right now more known for their offense. However, Novak already shows a lot of acumen in all three zones. He will need some development and refinement to his game, but he has a very large upside and plays a very complete game."
hawks,3aetyd,ClintEastwood41,3,Sat Jun 20 02:57:46 2015 UTC,We already have a 2nd
hawks,3aetyd,A2Aegis,15,Fri Jun 19 16:02:27 2015 UTC,You know what's better than a second round pick? Two second round picks.
hawks,3aetyd,Cavetroll771,6,Fri Jun 19 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"Ask Philly, they have 2 of ours."
hawks,3aetyd,tferg8280,2,Fri Jun 19 19:14:21 2015 UTC,I must be missing something. How so?
hawks,3aetyd,ClintEastwood41,2,Sat Jun 20 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"Kimmo trade, I think they got a 2015 first round pick and a conditional pick in 2016 if we made it to the finals."
hawks,3aetyd,Vorrigan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:16:36 2015 UTC,Yep The Kimmo trade gave Philly 2 2nd round picks BUT thanks to Kevin Hayes we got a 2nd back.

hawks,3af6i0,Dimo919,11,Fri Jun 19 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"The market for goal scoring forwards is weak this year on the free agent side. I'm betting they at least get a first, or a second and a prospect."
hawks,3af6i0,jmr33090,2,Fri Jun 19 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with that, didn't know that scoring forwards were weak this year, I know defenders are weak this year as well. But any way, it's just one down year it shouldn't effect his stock that much"
hawks,3af6i0,Cartortus,11,Fri Jun 19 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, shouldn't affect it too much. But rumor has it the Capitals are interested, and they could be looking to go all in next season. They are only one or two pieces away, so they could afford to sweeten the deal a bit in hopes of lifting the cup."
hawks,3af6i0,jmr33090,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:51:07 2015 UTC,What two pieces do they need
hawks,3af6i0,Cartortus,5,Fri Jun 19 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"Another top 6 scoring forward, for sure. This is the biggest piece of the puzzle that they are missing. They have great talent on the top line, obviously, but not a ton of depth.  Outside of that, they don't have any huge needs, but I'd be looking for a couple really solid penalty kill guys for their bottom 6 if I were them. Their PK was league average and was relatively their weakest part of the game all season."
hawks,3af6i0,jmr33090,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:05:45 2015 UTC,Where are these rumours coming from?
hawks,3af6i0,hawks198810,2,Fri Jun 19 19:56:03 2015 UTC,"Well it's known that they discussed the possibility of this trade back in February. The Blackhawks likely would've pulled the trigger if they didn't feel confident in making a cup run. That report came from the Chicago Tribune. It's hard to imagine they've lost interest between then and now given the weak scoring available via free agency. And quite a few articles have been written saying it's the best fit. Granted, the trade talks have just started for the summer, so there isn't any inside information leaking yet."
hawks,3af6i0,jmr33090,4,Fri Jun 19 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"I imagine similar to what we gave up for Vermette, give or take."
hawks,3af6i0,nameless22,6,Fri Jun 19 19:20:05 2015 UTC,We'll be lucky to get a first rounder
hawks,3af6i0,JohnChiBulls,3,Fri Jun 19 17:35:32 2015 UTC,Maybe a second round pick?
hawks,3af6i0,PrisonedMuffin,8,Fri Jun 19 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"We gave up a second rounder for David rundblad, and two for timonen. Bollig got a high third rounder. Aim higher"
hawks,3af6i0,LegendaryWarriorPoet,2,Fri Jun 19 22:13:22 2015 UTC,Sharp's age and his down year might cause teams to not want to pay a high price.
hawks,3af6i0,PrisonedMuffin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:16:45 2015 UTC,"Fair, but again, much inferior players get second rounders. Plus it's not a great free agent market. I don't think we could get a top-10 pick or anything for him, but something along the lines of 15-25 would be doable. Half of second rounders never play in the nhl. So if that's what we get, I'd want at least another good prospect to go with"
hawks,3af6i0,LegendaryWarriorPoet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:17:32 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty much guessing a 2nd
hawks,3af6i0,ClintEastwood41,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:33:00 2015 UTC,Vermette got a 1st and a good prospect. Even if we have no leverage at least a 1st id say

hawks,3acybp,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,15,Fri Jun 19 05:29:53 2015 UTC,It's all about the angle.
hawks,3acybp,remz07twos,11,Fri Jun 19 16:21:15 2015 UTC,The tickets sold out so... minus the scalpers and the few people who got tickets and didn't go i'd say it's safe to say there wasn't enough tickets given out to fill the field for regulations and safety reasons.
hawks,3acybp,Psykoala,17,Fri Jun 19 06:36:02 2015 UTC,"I agree.  However, GA floor always looks bad from directly above.  There are issues with the number of people that venues are willing to put on the floor in GA.  The people are supposed to have a certain amount of space around them, per regulations.  However, people always push to the front, and make the place look empty.  That said, it looks like there are plenty of people missing.  But if it were just because of scalpers, there would be large empty spots int he stands, too."
hawks,3acybp,PageSide84,8,Fri Jun 19 06:21:15 2015 UTC,In a nut shell: fire code.

hawks,3acybp,brianskuhar,3,Fri Jun 19 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"The stands look packed to the max. There were also still people coming in when everyone was on stage talking. I would think it filled up more, but I was already on the ground by then."
hawks,3acybp,dudecoolhat,6,Fri Jun 19 20:09:14 2015 UTC,It's because of the scalpers
hawks,3acybp,XxTRIPLSHTxX,8,Fri Jun 19 06:15:32 2015 UTC,"I was there and this makes it look really bad, it was actually decently full. Between the scalpers and those who bought tickets just to make money and weren't able to sell them, there was a lot of extra space for sure; the place where everyone was at was the parade because of the stupid ticket situation. If it wasn't for the tickets, we probably could've filled soldier field at least twice. It really pisses me off that i know for a fact a lot of die-hards couldn't go because jackass bandwagoners bought tickets and either didn't participate/celebrate or tried to sell the tickets for crazy amounts. Really hope next time (fingers crossed) we do this, it can be back in Grant Park. Damn you, flooding."
hawks,3acybp,titsforhits,4,Fri Jun 19 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, no one amongst my close friends and family was able to get tickets and we had all gone to the last two parades and rallies. I saw at least two people on my Facebook feed on Wednesday trying to sell rally tickets for $50+ and I know one of those people didn't even attend the rally yesterday. It pissed me off so much because I knew those people had no interest in going. We went to the parade and then went home."
hawks,3acybp,XxTRIPLSHTxX,5,Fri Jun 19 14:14:27 2015 UTC,That's the unfair part. Real fans like you didn't get the opportunity to go and enjoy the result of constant loyalty to the team and countless heart attacks during the playoffs. If the real fans were allowed to get tickets the stadium would've been overflowing
hawks,3acybp,DrakeShadow,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"I ended up getting two extra tickets emailed to me last min, I sent went to the staff and said who can I email this to so someone who doesn't have tickets can get in? They just said, open the email, they scanned it right off my phone and they let two people in who were waiting outside, felt very very happy to do that. This was myself and my friend in the GA section with her"

hawks,3ac0a6,Athilda,2,Fri Jun 19 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"It wasn't full. It was maybe 85-90% full. But even when the rally began, it wasn't even 80% full."
hawks,3ac0a6,WienerCircle,2,Fri Jun 19 02:19:33 2015 UTC,The field may not have been full but the seating area was over flowed people on the stairs and in aisles.

hawks,3ac0a6,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Fri Jun 19 09:58:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure a lot of people with seats ran down to the floor, because there was nobody to stop you. Plus, they only sold 10k tickets for the floor, and I'm sure there was well over 10k down there. They couldn't fully pack the field, because that would violate all kinds of codes."

hawks,3aa94e,Graphitetshirt,8,Thu Jun 18 23:10:48 2015 UTC,Because Bickell and Crow took discounts?
hawks,3aa94e,JasonEAltMTG,11,Thu Jun 18 15:12:44 2015 UTC,Bickell knew he was shit. And 4m for what we were promised isn't really too bad. 4m for what he gave is.
hawks,3aa94e,Templescio,6,Thu Jun 18 16:19:04 2015 UTC,Don't care won a cup
hawks,3aa94e,hansfriedee,12,Thu Jun 18 19:39:20 2015 UTC,I think this underestimates the financial impact giving up a few million dollars a year is worth. Saad should be paid. No one else is taking massive discounts in the prime of their career. Saad should not be asked to do that. Bowman is matching any offer sheet and figuring out the cap space - but there is no reason Saad should be forced to earn less than his market value when everyone else on the team is paid accordingly.
hawks,3aa94e,jdr393,13,Fri Jun 19 08:38:00 2015 UTC,"Saad has the opportunity for some serious endorsement deals in the Chicago area.  You think he'd get that money in a market like Edmonton, Calgary, Columbus, or any of a half dozen other smaller markets?  Milking the Hawks and pushing out other talent due to salary cap issues is being penny wise and pound foolish."
hawks,3aa94e,EventualCyborg,13,Thu Jun 18 17:57:02 2015 UTC,Again - I think people drastically over rate the impact of local endorsement deals. Saad is not getting Toews/Kane level endorsement deals. He is not going to recoup $2 million dollars lost per year by doing Hawk Ford commercials. It's not about milking the Hawks - its about getting paid fair market value for your services. Athletes have a smaller window of their lives to get paid than most normal individuals. Can he find a career after hockey? Sure. Giving up $10 million over 5 years is being a complete moron. He is never recouping that. It makes no economic sense. Give up $2-3 million over 5 years? Sure. That could work out for a home team discount.
hawks,3aa94e,jdr393,10,Thu Jun 18 18:37:18 2015 UTC,People don't realize this with the rose tinted glasses they are wearing right now. Saad deserves to get paid what he is worth. The only player that will probably take a big discount is Richards because he is still getting paid from his buyout and with that money he can afford to do that. Saad cannot and although it would be nice if he did no one should expect him to.
hawks,3aa94e,alkalinebydesign,2,Thu Jun 18 18:46:15 2015 UTC,"Agree. Also - Bowman is matching any offer out there. That is just a fact. He will get paid, I just get annoyed by this narrative of ""Saad should give up millions to keep us fans happy."" Because if he ends up somewhere else, people will turn on him for being greedy. When in reality it is the construct the NHL hard cap."
hawks,3aa94e,jdr393,4,Thu Jun 18 20:31:13 2015 UTC,"There will be no offer sheets, he will be signed before that"
hawks,3aa94e,Vorrigan,3,Thu Jun 18 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think that anybody is questioning whether or not Saad should be paid but rather raising the question of whether he's willing to give us a discount - not only to stay here but to help bolster the team's ability to build a complete team around him.  If the cap weren't an issue, I don't think anybody would be arguing against busting out the checkbook & giving him his market worth."
hawks,3aa94e,TheGarreth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Uh, he's not being forced. He WANTS to stay in Chicago."
hawks,3aa94e,scrag45,5,Thu Jun 18 21:21:17 2015 UTC,Not what I am saying. He wants to stay in Chicago**  **If we can work out the contract details. If the Hawks said the only way we can keep you is by paying you $10 million less over 5 years - no way he gives that up. I want to be on the blackhawks. Doesn't mean I am signing a contract tomorrow.

hawks,3aa94e,Tea_pot_dome,11,Thu Jun 18 14:46:41 2015 UTC,I thought the salary cap hit calculation was Total Salary/Total Years so that a team can't game their salary cap like that?  Or maybe I just dreamed that up.
hawks,3aa94e,thanson1990,9,Fri Jun 19 04:41:18 2015 UTC,You're absolutely correct.  Cap hit is the average salary over the total contract.
hawks,3aa94e,Zandroid69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:33:48 2015 UTC,Could they do a low 2 year contract then sign a bigger one after?
hawks,3aa94e,Phridgey,5,Thu Jun 18 14:41:22 2015 UTC,"Commonly referred to as a bridge deal. Usually results in the bigger one being more/year than it would have been otherwise...If the player pays off. At this point, we're pretty confident about Saad's ongoing development so it's in our best interests to sign him for 6+ years at around 5m."
hawks,3aa94e,burner46,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:48:28 2015 UTC,Of course. But then you have the risk of somebody else trying to outbid the Hawks at the end of that contract. And who knows how everything will look in 2 years. Saad is on a high right now because we just won. What if we miss the playoffs the next 2 years or he gets injured?
hawks,3aa94e,thanson1990,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"He'd still be restricted at that point, so they'd still be in the same situation.  I think that they want to get a long term deal done, he's an important part of this team and a superstar in the making."
hawks,3aa94e,cornyb,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"That would be a bridge deal, which some people think might happen. It leaves Saad open to more risk though."

hawks,3aal23,JohnnieBoah,4,Thu Jun 18 18:04:40 2015 UTC,Ya I was wondering how a Chicago show with them would go. I loved them for a while but one song people are the worst at concerts.

hawks,3aal23,da4,8,Thu Jun 18 15:48:22 2015 UTC,I can't believe they blocked an entire section off like they do with a concert... I figured they'd let people sit wherever they wanted - just stick another screen behind the main one and everyone behind the stage can see.  Interesting planning decisions here.
hawks,3aal23,LegacyLemur,5,Thu Jun 18 15:51:28 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they had it blocked because they are replacing the jumbo tron. They had lots of scaffolding up there so it was probably a safety concern.

hawks,3abtyk,DancingNancy4136,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:29:26 2015 UTC,"Native Americans are very proud people who hold their traditions, symbols, and imagery very sacred to them. The Hawks organization works closely with the American Indian Center to educate and avoid racial/cultural appropriation such as this. Chief Blackhawk was of the Sauk and Fox Tribe who did not wear headdresses like this.   Metaphorically, it would be having a Chinese team and people running around dressed like ancient Japanese warriors.  The most simple definition of cultural appropriation is that it occurs when members of a dominant culture borrow from the cultures of minority groups without their input. Typically those doing the “borrowing,” or exploiting, lack a contextual understanding of what makes the cultural symbols, art forms and modes of expression significant. Despite their ignorance of the ethnic groups from which they borrow, members of the majority culture have frequently profited from cultural exploitation.  Info on the partnership with AIC: http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/m_page.htm?id=74904  Older article but I think it does a good job of explaining it: http://espn.go.com/chicago/nhl/story/_/id/11110679/chicago-blackhawks-logo-requires-continued-conversation-team-identity-versus-appropriation"

Yes they may be 'douchy', but they are simply dressing up as the mascot of their favorite team that won the cup. I think calling them racist for that is pretty ridiculous. Maybe I'm just sick of hearing why everything is offensive."
hawks,3abtyk,MommyDrinks,0,Sat Jun 20 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Your response indicates that you don't ""get"" all that at all. Our mascot doesn't wear a headdress and body paint and fuzzy leg warmers. These guys were there to exploit and get attention. Plain and simple. I witnessed them in action.   As a loyal Hawks fan and also a human with Native American heritage, we must respect the culture we're borrowing these images from or we won't get to use them much longer (see Chief Illiniwek)."

I believe that the van Riemsdyk's had to drive through the rain because their flight got cancelled. Kane's family also had their flight cancelled and had to get a charter to Chicago. They got there right before the first goal and the van Riemsdyk's got there with like 8 minutes left in the game or something. The bad weather could've possibly grounded his plane I guess.

hawks,3a888d,HollowImage,2,Thu Jun 18 15:56:48 2015 UTC,I think his name will be on there:   To have one's name engraved on the Stanley Cup certain requirements must be met.

Kane walked in - wasted - and was like ""let's turn this fuckin' music up!!"". He was straight up ripping shots with his buddies the whole time. Phil Pritchard said he was drunk before the Cubs game.  I quickly realized anything I ordered from the bar was getting charged to the Hawks (we were some of the only non-Hawks there), so I ordered ten shots of Fireball. I brought about five over to a table of Toews, Saad, Richards, and some other guys. Toews grabbed one and everyone was giving him shit, because apparently that's pretty out of character. Someone else stepped up and wanted to take one, so he gave his up. Little did he know I had five more on the table behind me. I handed Toews another. The same thing happened about two more times, before we finally all got to take a group shot. Apparently Tazer likes Fireball. There's a pic of it on my Twitter - I can post an Imgur later. We also did shots with Crow which was awesome, but no pics.  There's a few more stories - but I gotta head into the office! More later!"
hawks,3a87k3,Cannelle,21,Thu Jun 18 12:10:58 2015 UTC,"I'll try to do this in tidbits so that I have a shot at accomplishing something at work today.... Here's the original picstitch I posted to Twitter/Insta/etc: Out with the Hawks You'll see my boyfriend in the bottom middle picture, he's Indian. I got a picture of him with Oduya, and told him it was ""from one brown guy to another"". He got a kick out of that, since the rest of the bar was all white people.   Also when they were trying to round up everyone to get going Oduya stayed behind to take pics with some kids that had showed up, and Toews was shouting in the resto ""JOHNNY O! LEGGO!!!"" which was endearing.   I'll save my favorite Kane story for next :P"
hawks,3a87k3,BuffyTheUmpireSlayer,9,Thu Jun 18 13:19:05 2015 UTC,Toews is a captain both on the ice and in the bars.

hawks,3a6i8y,Fixner_Blount,20,Wed Jun 17 18:11:17 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're getting downvoted lol.  Crow has dropped 3 F bombs on live television.  You can get away with that when you're the cup champs.
hawks,3a6i8y,Siggy778,8,Wed Jun 17 18:41:28 2015 UTC,"Didn't realize I was getting downvoted, but thanks haha. I wasn't trying to shame Corey, I think it's hilarious."

hawks,3a6i8y,Vortilex,2,Thu Jun 18 03:19:58 2015 UTC,He's pretty out there now. Not sure what he was like then. He goes on a lot of tangents and everything goes back to some random sporting events in the 60s.  He's got a very loyal following from small number of fans but says some dumb stuff. Mully and Hanley the AM show host usually sign off with grobber saying something dumb or weird.
hawks,3a70q5,geophys42,63,Wed Jun 17 18:54:13 2015 UTC,I was there in 2013 and hope his foul mouth makes a return

hawks,3a70q5,Druphistopheles,24,Wed Jun 17 23:09:05 2015 UTC,Everyone standing next to me were saying did crow really just say the f word.  I really think that should become a tradition along with drunk kane. I would also like to see Taco give a speech.
hawks,3a70q5,ebenz87,23,Wed Jun 17 23:18:49 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for Taco. He's a young guy without a lot of experience dealing with the media or speaking in front of giant crowds AND he's speaking in a foreign tongue.   That said, he has a Cup to his name at age 20 so that might provide a little consolation."
hawks,3a70q5,Disgustoid,7,Wed Jun 17 23:43:40 2015 UTC,That stat about him being the second youngest rookie behind Jagr to have a multipoint SCF game is also pretty impressive.

hawks,3a70q5,jmr33090,27,Wed Jun 17 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard the brass were extremely pissed off at him for that in 2013. Great blue collar Chicago moment, but executives definitely don't want a repeat."
hawks,3a70q5,DasSnaus,19,Wed Jun 17 22:52:14 2015 UTC,He dropped an f bomb while giving and interview after their win. I think we will hear another one.

hawks,3a7rra,rblumenfeld76,15,Wed Jun 17 22:15:09 2015 UTC,That is the WWE Belt from Vince McMahon... for some reason. Not the Hawks Game Belt. That will be given out at the Parade I'm sure.
hawks,3a7rra,bud1316,5,Wed Jun 17 22:25:31 2015 UTC,Really?  Vinny Mac lent them the belt?  Or did he steal it from the Architect too...?

Last time the Hawks won CM Punk told him to send it to Crow I think....Vince said he wasn't going to because 'no one watches hockey'.   Proved him wrong, and he ate his words."

In all seriousness, I am going to the parade. It has been my dream ever since I watched the Stanley Cup Finals all the way from Slovakia in 2010. I'm going super early to get a good spot. I might even bring my Slovak gear (Goral hat) and find other Hossa fanatics.  Quick question, did TV censor the rally last time? I'm debating going to Soldier Field (outside) or a bar. I'll probably go to a bar sometime tomorrow anyway."

I'll be driving in from Iowa early tomorrow morning by myself, parking in the suburbs and taking the CTA downtown.  After the parade and rally, though, does anyone want to get together in the afternoon?  I'm not super familiar with Chicago, so I don't know where a good place to go would be, but it shouldn't be that hard to find.  Maybe we can have a /r/Hawks get-together somewhere?"

hawks,3a7bj4,BGW17,7,Wed Jun 17 20:51:48 2015 UTC,They'll probably use the screens outside Solider Field

hawks,3a7bj4,_kill-fx_,14,Thu Jun 18 01:00:05 2015 UTC,I can't understand how they allow lollapalooza here yet we can't have a parade here.
hawks,3a7bj4,vampyweeks,27,Wed Jun 17 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Lollapalooza paid around $250,000 for the park to be restored after being damaged last year.  Riot Fest paid for Humboldt Park to be restored after being damaged post-rain last year.  They needed to fix the park after the last Stanley Cup event, and it   hadn't rained.   Do you want the city paying at least $250,000 for fixing it up between now and Lolla?"
hawks,3a7bj4,DasSnaus,10,Wed Jun 17 21:08:22 2015 UTC,Good point!
hawks,3a7bj4,breadbeard,9,Wed Jun 17 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"takes a seat  Very true, I didn't take that into consideration. Thanks!"
hawks,3a7bj4,ShanktimusPrime,12,Wed Jun 17 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's literally less than a single penny to everyone who would want to go to this. The space is there for events like this and it's not being used for the public good, instead being sold out to corporations instead with no benefit to the public."
hawks,3a7bj4,Cougah,3,Wed Jun 17 23:02:05 2015 UTC,Ya a five dollar donation goes a long way.
hawks,3a7bj4,ShanktimusPrime,2,Wed Jun 17 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"Well, actually, it IS being used for the public good.  There are free events already scheduled in Grant Park this week as well.  Damaging the park could affect those as well."
hawks,3a7bj4,breadbeard,3,Thu Jun 18 13:46:54 2015 UTC,"how about do it at Grant Park and then ask fans for donations to fix the field after the event explaining that the other option would be to host it at Soldier Field for only 80,000 fans and not ask for a donation? I think surely that MORE than enough people would donate. $1 from a quarter of a million people is all it would take. some people would donate more, because it's the BLACKHAWKS, and respect. seriously."
hawks,3a7bj4,Mr_Abe_Froman,3,Thu Jun 18 14:03:44 2015 UTC,"Because they also have other events at the park over the next couple of weeks, and then you have the park damaged during those events, because it will take time to repair, even if they foot the bill ahead of time.  It's not just grass, you need to pay overtime for the police and fire department to have people on hand for possible emergencies and crowd control.  Lolla already covers that with their large ticket prices and schedules that stuff in advance."
hawks,3a7bj4,breadbeard,8,Thu Jun 18 14:14:35 2015 UTC,It seems almost impossible to see the parade then get to Soldier in time. Anyone considering attempting a sprint?
hawks,3a7bj4,Mr_Abe_Froman,4,Wed Jun 17 23:29:10 2015 UTC,I am. I'm going to bring some good shoes.
hawks,3a7bj4,breadbeard,3,Thu Jun 18 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Where are you going to go parade-wise? I'm considering south side of the street, east side of the river, like Franklin or wells, so the parade will go past then I can get moving while it finishes. Sounds stupid but why not"
hawks,3a7bj4,Mr_Abe_Froman,3,Thu Jun 18 02:46:36 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about the same,  but honestly I have no idea.   Franklin sounds awesome  (Sears tower background ) but ten thousand people probably have the same idea. Shit, I have a lot of memories in that building. I think I'll go for it.   Edit : I'm an idiot. Sears Tower is South of the parade. Wrong side of the street."
hawks,3a7bj4,breadbeard,5,Thu Jun 18 04:49:37 2015 UTC,"I think winning tomorrow will be a matter of finesse and improvisation, not unlike a certain darkbird frozen water team, who shall remain nameless at this time"

hawks,3a7bj4,nolimitz4me,3,Wed Jun 17 23:35:37 2015 UTC,So you're just going to the stadium and waiting?  I guess they'd show the parade on screens inside the arena
hawks,3a7bj4,Gexthelizardwizard,4,Wed Jun 17 23:43:48 2015 UTC,I believe that's our plan. Otherwise you're making a mile walk between the very end and Soldier Field at the minimum if you stand at Michigan/Monroe.
hawks,3a7bj4,nolimitz4me,3,Wed Jun 17 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"Right, and that would be catching the end of the parade - that would be cool, if they slow down and bask in their own glory. But if someone's pushing a timetable they might high tail it"
hawks,3a7bj4,Gexthelizardwizard,3,Thu Jun 18 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"They would need to do a five minute mile to ensure getting there on time from Michigan/Monroe.  Yeah, we're only going to the rally."
hawks,3a7bj4,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Thu Jun 18 02:14:33 2015 UTC,Kind of funny to call it a rally actually. They're done at this point. A rally should have happened before during or after that damn Ducks series

I went on at 12:01 and my friend went on right when the countdown hit zero and neither of us got tickets. The greatest thing about the Stanley Cup and what sets it apart from other major trophies is how it's shared with the fans but the way the parade and rally are set up this year does not do the Cup or this Blackhawks team justice. Rahm and the city really dropped the ball here.

hawks,3a6sv9,TheGarreth,-1,Wed Jun 17 22:18:50 2015 UTC,"Gotta be honest - I'm not getting all the faux outrage over people marking up these tickets for a profit.  I know that anytime I fly back home and want to catch a Hawks game, I'm likely having to pay a huge mark-up over the face value that the Hawks INTENDED the ticket to be sold for originally, just as the tickets for tomorrow were INTENDED to be free.  If this gets enough people mad enough that the system is changed and that kind of fuckery & the potential for it are eliminated from the system, then that's definitely a good thing but being that so many people, until just a few days ago, couldn't even think of going to a Hawks playoff/SCF because the original ticket holders - season ticket holders in some cases - had marked them up hundreds or thousands of dollars over face value, I'm having a pretty hard time buying that NOW, people are suddenly up in arms."

They are hosting it somewhere that already has maintenance facilities in place.  You need to limit the number of people going into the stadium, or you run the risk of stampedes and people being crushed trying to get into the stadium.  It's a safety risk if they didn't make it a ticketed event."
hawks,3a5wzi,datassremainsthesame,6,Wed Jun 17 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"TM says these tickets are non-transferable.  How do they plan on enforcing this?  If I am amble to transfer them, I will go ahead and try to grab some.  I'm not planning on going (I'll just watch the parade), but I'd be more than willing to grab some to give to others from this sub, in order to keep them out of the hands of scalpers.  If they are truly non-transferable, I'd rather just not try (so that someone who can actually go will get them . . no scalping non-transferable tickets, anyway).  EDIT:  Removed some of my stupidity from the comment. EDIT part deux:  Shut out.  Sorry, guys."

EDIT: So I have the tickets verified in my account with a confirmed order number, but I cannot view the tickets because I get a Ticketmaster error page (Meaning their system is way overloaded).   I did it on Internet Explorer, Chrome, and FF. IE was the only one that got through, and it had a countdown timer telling me my wait time. Chrome and FF didn't have that, but just had the ""searching for verified"" thing. My theory is on Chrom & FF, tons of people probably refreshed thinking that that was a good strategy and kept getting bumped to the end of the line. On IE, I knew I was in and just had to wait, so I did."

hawks,3a6m1w,DjHanzelsSunglasses,36,Wed Jun 17 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"I have to go with 2013.  That season was just an amazing season. I'm sure we'll never see another season where a team was that dominant. To start the season out 21-0-3, to just roll through the playoffs, except against Detroit, where we had an amazing come back in the Series to topple our biggest rivals for the last time they're in our conference. Having Hammer score that goal, get taken away then seabs ends it in a game 7 ot.   I don't think any season will ever live up to 2013 for me. Plus, I was going through some hard times at that moment, and really, watching the team was the only thing I enjoyed."
hawks,3a6m1w,Heavenisatree,7,Wed Jun 17 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"Same for me. The Detroit series was burned into my memory for all time, Down 3 games to 1. Seabrook coming over to Toews into the box, Disallowed goal, then Seabrook with that rocket from the point. Then Bickell tieing it with Crawford pulled in game 6 in Boston and Bolland 17 seconds later. Shivers just thinking of that run."

hawks,3a6m1w,eskEMO_iwl,15,Wed Jun 17 17:20:49 2015 UTC,"They've all been absolutely amazing, but with everything that's happened, Clint, Steve, Stan's dementia, Kimmo's last chance, this one was pretty emotional."
hawks,3a6m1w,eskEMO_iwl,9,Wed Jun 17 17:29:23 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound a little off mark, but other than Clint Reif's death, the others are non-factors.  Steve Montador played half a season three years ago.   Stan Mikita is ailing, but still alive.  Kimmo Timonen played 1/5 of a regular season with the Hawks.   Other than some sensationalism from the media, the team is likely pretty well insulated from all of that."
hawks,3a6m1w,BudBill18,2,Wed Jun 17 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"True to some extent. Carcillo is still dealing with it. Toews, and Seabs, made it pretty clear that Kimmo living in the moment of the celebration was pretty important to them. Maybe Mikita, and Monty, weren't huge factors to a lot of the guys, but it's still there.  EDIT: Upvoted you because I enjoy the discussion, not sure why the downvotes are there."
hawks,3a6m1w,thepatman,11,Wed Jun 17 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"2015-mostly because the Hawks overcame so much to win it. Kane's injury, inconsistent play in the regular season, losing Rozy and operating with barely 4 defensemen for the final two series were obstacles only this amazing team could handle. They did not have home ice advantage in 3 of the 4 series, and they often were outplayed. But, as champions do, they found a way to emerge victorious when it mattered most. Not to mention Clint Reif, Kimmo, the rise of Teuvo, and news of Stan's dementia.  -The first title felt like destiny, and it was awesome to win the first cup since 1961, but the Hawks were the better team in every playoff series that year. Winning the 1st one was very special, and I'm not discounting that at all.  -The second title was incredibly fun, but it wasn't a huge surprise that the best team in the NHL won the title. Overcoming the 3-1 deficit vs Detroit was incredible, though.   It's hard to pick a favorite, but I think this one is the sweetest for the reasons mentioned above."
hawks,3a6m1w,DikembeMunjumbo,11,Wed Jun 17 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"No other choice: 2010.    I'm a Detroit transplant.  When I moved here(2004), I lived not far from the UC.  Back then I could walk up to the box office five minutes before puck drop and get decent seats for a good price.  I went all the time.  I saw my hometown Red Wings in their most recent championship season, and at some point all of the Original Six play live.  In the beginning I used the Hawks as a cheap way to see pro hockey.  Nothing more.  But the more I watched them, the more I got to like them.  They were a team that was struggling to maintain viability in a town that didn't seem to care much about them.  They were an Original Six team that couldn't fill a stadium.  They were a team that wanted something but didn't have the backing to do it.  Even Bill Wirtz sometimes seemed to dislike his own team.  When things started to change after Bill's passing, it was a slow process.  That first year saw a pickup in things.  You saw sweaters around town more.  The increase in TV packaging meant you could go to the bar and watch a Hawks game.  There was a sense among my hockey fans that something big was going to happen.  2010 was a stunner of a season.  Six years earlier, the Hawks had been named the worst franchise in all of sports.  Seriously.  The worst of the worst.  Suddenly, we finish the regular season second in the Western Conference, and we're going to the playoffs!  Wow.  What a season, guys, congrats.  The playoffs.  Then we beat the Predators, which was not wholly unexpected.  But then Vancouver fell, and this team started to really look like something.  When we sweep the Sharks, and it looked like the Cup might actually come to Chicago for the first time in 47 years, things changed.    Yeah, we got bandwagon fans.  I don't care.  Bandwagon fans still watch hockey, and it was amazing to see people out in sweaters everywhere.  People that couldn't identify ice in a glass talked Kane, Toews and Hossa.  This, in a city that is used to long championship droughts and last-second snatches of defeat from the jaws of victory.  Still, even then, most of us thought that second place was the best we were going to do.  We win two.  They win two.  We sweat.  We take back one.  Now it's 3-2, with one single win separating us and the Cup.    And we watched.  And watched.  And watched, as the game never seemed to end.  We score.  They score.  They score.  We score twice.  They score again, to end the game at 3-3.  Suddenly, it's looking like a game 7 might be in the mix.  And then Campbell sets up Kane.  And Kane jukes around Kimmo Timonen, denying him his chance to win the Cup, and takes that weird-ass shot.  The city went dead silent.  Sharp and Kane are celebrating, and no one else knows what the fuck is going on.  Then, the announcers, the crowd, and the city realize that it's a goal.  One unbelievable, crazy, shot-in-the dark goal, and the Hawks break the drought and bring Lord Stanley home.  In 2013 and 2015 we knew we could.  2010 was a stunner, a surprise to all.  Never forget that one."

What they did that season when hockey was at it's lowest point is so significant I don't think it's appreciated enough.  Also, Crawford backstopping them to a Cup was huge as he answered and silenced (temporarily) his critics.  Plus they were just dominant.  The best team from start to finish.  And they beat Boston, which really irked the national media."

hawks,3a6m1w,Gobyinmypants,3,Wed Jun 17 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"For me it was 2010.   My dad was a big Hawks fan, so I grew up around it. Listening to games on the radio at the kitchen table with my dad, or him flipping it on my boombox for me to listen to as I fell asleep.   I can't at all claim I continued to watch almost every game during the dark days, but I attended some when I wasn't down at school, and continued to follow how the team was doing in the standings, and it was bad. The days of Chelios winning cups in Detroit, Alexei Zhamnov as captain, Eric Daze being the next big thing, Kyle Beach being the nexter bigger thing, etc.   In 2009, I moved back to the city and started going to games as much as I could, when I could grab 300 level tickets off craigslist for $25. Despite the team at least making things difficult on Detroit in the WCF the year before, people still had a casual interest at best, which was fine for a kid trying to buy tickets. Even the first round of the playoffs the bars were often empty on game nets against the Preds. That 2009-2010 team was just so damn fun to watch. Fast as hell.   When they won in 2010, the first cup of mine and many here's lifetimes, man, it all just felt worth it. I had friends who were super interested in hockey for the first time in their lives and going out for the games, and when I said I needed to call it a night bc of work the next day at like 11pm, a friend said 'nope. how long have you waited for this? no work tomorrow.' And it was the right call.   2013 and 2015 have been fantastic, but the first cup of my lifetime? You just can't duplicate that."
hawks,3a6m1w,nameless22,3,Wed Jun 17 18:09:58 2015 UTC,2013 and 2010. I wasn't as excited this time around because I just expected it. And I am going to keep expecting it.
hawks,3a6m1w,hawksfire,3,Wed Jun 17 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think the raw emotion of 2010 was probably the best one. There was a sense of wonderment in winning that first one after all that time. On top of that, I was a product of the early 90s, however, I don't remember much of the Jordan era and those championships, so this was the first hometown championship I was really able to enjoy.   2013 actually happened on my birthday, which was incredibly memorable too.  Hell, I can't pick, they're all my favorite and I can't wait for the next one."
hawks,3a6m1w,jerry200890,3,Wed Jun 17 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"They're all special to me.

hawks,3a6m1w,ChrisPummer,2,Wed Jun 17 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"2010 has to be the favorite. The stress of knowing that the team would be dismantled, so this might be our ONLY shot, was huge for me. Breaking the drought makes it the most important. 2013 was the most fun. There was less stress, but the series winning moments were the most memorable. Seabrook vs. Det in game 7, Kane in double OT vs. LA, 17 seconds vs. Boston. 2015 was stressful in its own way, because it was the first time I ever felt like we had a right to the cup and I had confidence. The stress of 2015 was trying to live up to expectations. They did."
hawks,3a6m1w,wazoo3,2,Wed Jun 17 20:25:55 2015 UTC,"0:17 is really close.  But 2010, because of the playoff run and just the release of ending the drought in OT.  Plus I'm friends with some Flyer fans, so it provides endless opportunities to text them pictures of the banner.  The only thing they have is the missing puck. :( But they're all so awesome and memorable in different ways."

I'd been going throuh a tough time with depression starting in late 2012, and when the lockout ended, my best friend introduced me to hockey and the Blackhawks. Having something to root for helped me to overcome the struggles I was going through, and it helped me to realize how much I truly adore Chicago.

And it's the Stanley Cup; the toughest trophy to win in all of sport. You don't do so with an average Goalie, and Crow's won it twice."

Bet that bowl of Stanley Cup Clinching Shutout tastes real good with his haterade.   Two Cups and 1.7 Conn Smythe snubs later, Crow has proven to be both elite, and above all else, a winner."
hawks,3a2kwf,DoomHawk,32,Tue Jun 16 21:20:45 2015 UTC,Wanting to dump Crawford for salary cap reasons =/= being a hater  Nobody thinks Sharp is bad (well unless you believe those wife fucking rumors) but it's just the salary cap era and you have to make sacrifices somewhere.

I assure you they cannot, and you can take that to the bank faster than Crow and Bickell get their bloated game checks there. You know how many goals Stamkos had that Final series? How about that whole ""Triplets line"". The Hawks never played anything resembling ""lock down defense"" but we have the Cup, won in a shutout, because Crow once again got on the big stage and stood on his head.  2. There are two-time cup-winning goaltenders (who mind you, had a legitimate bid for the Conn Smythe both times) who you can go get (as free agents or trades) who you can pay less than 6 mil, much less one you can pay a significant enough less to be worth the hassle and risk of throwing out the guy who beautifully netminded his team's journey to two cups in three years.   I'm not saying Crow is untouchable, nor should he be, and he is expensive... But he just won you two Damn cups. Kane and Towes make a collective $21 mil and they together gave you a nice solid 1 goal during the final. How many epic, sure-goal miracle saves did Crow give you just in game 6 alone?"

There aren't enough Cup-caliber netminders around the league as it is... Don't give up one who has twice already proven to be a winner."

Sharp is gone so is bickell. Never said steeg is a need he's a roster fill and fla pays half his salary. Don't come in here spewing bullshit cause you completely twisted everything i said. No I'm not a crow lover and he played fantastic last night. But 6 mil for a 6-11 tier goalie is a huge cap hit when we have pieces that we need to lock up.

Has told me multiple times he hates Crow and B: picked Tampa to win and U.S. Being out in the second round to the Blues on his bracket (which was printed and hung from his desk until some point during the Anaheim series).  FUCK YEAH CHICAGO!!!"

hawks,3a2kwf,T-888,16,Tue Jun 16 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Asked so many of these haters throughout the season, ""Do you even watch, bro?!? The defense leaves him out to dry at least twice a game!""  And now they've got nothing to say because, hot damn, did he stand tall when he needed to"

hawks,3a2kwf,DancingNancy4136,9,Wed Jun 17 00:14:06 2015 UTC,She's right. Real goalies never let a single goal in over their entire career. They're very rare through.

Even if you want to save some money against the cap because you think another guy can't be that much worse without getting as expensive, how much worse can you get in those margins?"
hawks,3a2kwf,ChrisPummer,2,Wed Jun 17 01:57:27 2015 UTC,"He is on our team, he is our goalie which means back him up. They get the flak first, they take it the most personal. I've noticed Crow takes games very seriously he is extremely passionate about it, that's a good thing. He may not be Roy Patrick, but he sure as hell isn't Osgood that is insulting as hell to a goalie. He fits this team and it's obvious. When I'm at a game and I hear Darling this and that, there isn't enough data yet to make that claim. Trust me I've seen Darling with the Admirals many many times, I love him. Crow is still a better fit right now for them overall the rest of the team is comfortable around him. Enjoy the whole team's accomplishment, Hockey gods are fickle remember that always."
hawks,3a2kwf,Singuris,2,Wed Jun 17 11:22:46 2015 UTC,What I've learned in this thread -- Apparently because I don't love Corey Crawford or recognize him as an elite  goaltender I am a bandwagon fan. Alright.
hawks,3a2kwf,circusbear,5,Wed Jun 17 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"We should dump Crawford this season if we can, it's not that he's bad, it's that he's on too much $$."
hawks,3a2kwf,DasSnaus,5,Wed Jun 17 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"Trust me, people who call an average goaltender playing behind guys like Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook and is good for a soft goal or two most games ""elite"" is just annoying to me as me being a ""hater"" is to you. I don't think he's a shitty goaltender, but when you people call him elite and I disagree, I am treated to a bunch of smug posts after the cup saying ""where are the haters now?""   ""Did you even watch the games, bro?"" Yeah, sure did. Did you watch the series against Nashville?"
hawks,3a2kwf,JasonEAltMTG,3,Wed Jun 17 00:18:38 2015 UTC,Is Rinne elite? Most people would say yes and he did not look so hot in that series either

hawks,3a2kwf,ChaplnGrillSgt,0,Wed Jun 17 01:40:27 2015 UTC,He doesn't have keith seabrook hammer and Oduya either
hawks,3a2kwf,bud1316,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"The Blackhawks gave up the 9th most shots against this year. Please keep telling me how the defense is the only reason Crawford looks good...  In reality, the defense was not up to par at all this season, and Crawford faced far more 2 on 1 and breakaway opportunities than any season I can remember. And if there is one goalie I want in net during a breakaway, or a shootout, it's Crawford. No doubt."
hawks,3a2kwf,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:14:03 2015 UTC,"hes also in the bottom tier of shutouts, he needs 3-4 goals usually and great d in front of him.  can he stand on his head? yes of course and he has proven it.  im not saying i wanted him gone, but 6 mil for not being able to steal games is a steep hit when we have pieces we need to lock up."
hawks,3a2kwf,bud1316,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"He doesn't get shutouts often, but he doesn't usually need 3-4 goals per game to win. His quality start percentage proves that. At .696, he is giving his team a very good chance to win nearly 7 out of 10 games, and that percentage is second best in the NHL.  When he gives up a bad goal, you see him go into a different mode the rest of the game and he's great. He DOES NOT have a great D in front of him. Idk how many times I have to say that. They gave up the 9th most shots on goal in the league this year. The defense is not what it used to be, unfortunately.  As for pieces we need to lock up. Sharp is gonna go whether Crawford does or not. I don't want Bickell back, and I like Versteeg, but we can bring up someone to fill his role easily. Richards and Vermette were rentals anyways and everyone knows it, they aren't coming back unless it's a one year deal because if Crawford left, they'll have to pay Raanta starting money after this next season or Darling the season after that. And if either of them leads the Hawks to another cup, they're gonna get a contract in the 6.5 - 7 mil range, starting this whole debate over. If they don't get a cup, we'll be asking ""what if we kept Crawford, who does routinely steal games in the playoffs""?   Edit: either way, let's just hope Saad takes a friendly 2 year bridge deal with a promise of a big pay day as he gets closer to his prime and the cap is higher. That's the number one thing we can all hope for right now and it's not that unlikely."
hawks,3a2kwf,jmr33090,0,Wed Jun 17 15:26:34 2015 UTC,"the people we need to lock up are krueger, saad and seabrook. sharp is 5.9 mil, crow is 6, bickell is 4.  versteeg isnt going anywhere as he fills a roster spot and FLA pays half his salary. youre completely wrong about the defense and crow does not steal games.  yes he has hardware but not in the class of elite goalies in the NHL, take off the homer glasses for 2 seconds."
hawks,3a2kwf,bud1316,2,Wed Jun 17 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"""You're completely wrong about the defense."" No, you are. And this should be as far as I take it since you're not backing yourself up at all. Why have the shots on goal per game been trending up to the point they are in the bottom third of the league? Why have I seen so damn many breakaways and 2 on 1 opportunities this year? Seriously, that's been alarming. And all the failed clearances, which I'll admit, got way less frequent toward end of season, but holy shit was it frustrating until mid March.  Crawford stole games from STL last year in the playoffs, and I'd argue that you have to give him huge credit for the SCF this year. Their four wins were 2-1, 2-1, 2-1 & 2-0. And he stole plenty in 2013 and the Conn Smythe was stolen from him. Kane said so himself that Crawford deserved that award and the announcers were shocked when it was announced for Kane.  Take off the hater glasses for 2 seconds. We could be in much worse situations (Jimmy Howard, Cam Ward, Luongo, Fleury). The situation I dread is having to lock up Raanta or Darling for 5 million, because they will get paid that much if they are starting, and losing out on a proven winner we could have kept for only 1 million more. We'll lock up Saad and Kruger, Seabrook isn't til next year and we'll have a bit more flexibility when that time comes, also, I don't see him getting a large raise, so his cap situation is being way overblown. I should clarify that I don't want Versteeg gone this offseason, but that he doesn't need to come back after next season."
hawks,3a2kwf,jmr33090,2,Wed Jun 17 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Did you stop watching after Nashville? Did you realize that Keith and Seabrook lead the defense which gave up the 9th most shots on goal this year? Seriously, the D is not what it used to be, and they are not the reason behind Crawford's good performances.   And as for your Nashville argument, Carey Price gave up 5 goals & 6 goals in games this playoffs, and 4 goals on 28 shots in their elimination game. Man, he sure does suck. Lundqvist gave up 6 goals in consecutive games against the Lightning, I bet Rangers fans would love to trade him. Rinne gave up 6 goals on 35 shots, and 5 goals on 29 shots against the Blackhawks. Boy, how did we ever get past that stud with our shit tier goaltending?"
hawks,3a2kwf,jmr33090,3,Wed Jun 17 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"A couple of bad games does not a shitty goalie make. Not everyone can be 100% all the time. The important thing about Crow is that he always bounces back. Ok, so you were watching when he had that bad game in Nashville. Did you stop watching then? We tamed the Predators. We ate the Ducks, and we withstood the Lightning. We wouldn't be where we are now if Crawford was just a shitty goalie."
hawks,3a2kwf,sink_your_teeth,5,Wed Jun 17 00:30:30 2015 UTC,We also won a cup with Niemi in goal. Did he get shitty all of a sudden or is his production down because he no longer plays for the best team in the NHL? I wonder.
hawks,3a2kwf,JasonEAltMTG,3,Wed Jun 17 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"If you don't like Crow , please do all the real, lifelong BLACKHAWKS fans a favor and root for Price or Lundquist or one of those other ""elite"" goalies with no rings on their fingers. It's still a team sport last I checked and the team is only as strong as the weakest link. If he's that link then we're in pretty damn good shape. I wonder if the tears Crow cries when he reads all the comments dissing him could fill Lord Stanley's Cup. Twice."

He is this generation's Chris Osgood. No matter what he does it'll never be enough.  He will retire with 300 wins and not a single one of those will be his. They'll all belong to the team in front of him. Fuck that. Brodeur has 3 cups, played in the clutch and grab era and he's arguably GOAT. But Crawford with his 2 cups... he sucks."
hawks,3a2kwf,BlueLineMenace,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:44:11 2015 UTC,The only game I went to this year was when we got beat by Boston 7-2.  Crow got pulled and everyone cheered when that happened.  Hardly any of the goals were even his fault that day.  But people are dumb.
hawks,3a2kwf,Siggy778,8,Wed Jun 17 01:29:23 2015 UTC,Very rarely are the goals entirely the goalies fault.  Part of being a professional goalie though is stopping the puck even when your team makes mistakes.  That's what crawford did this entire SCF.  He stopped the ones you don't expect him to stop and that's what made all the difference.
hawks,3a2kwf,Duese,-4,Wed Jun 17 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"Not a hater, but yes officer .. I would like to do everything possible to dump crow and his 6 million dollar contract because I believe we have to pay the folks in front of the goalie.  We also have two gentlemen waiting in the wings that are signed for 500k and 600k that are more than capable of holding the fort down.  Officer ... I think the real crime was giving 6 million dollars to a goalie that is one of the worst at playing the puck in the league.  I also think it was a crime to give a goalie 6 million dollars when he's in the butterfly a 1/2 hour too early on just about every shot attempt leaving the upper 1/3rd of the net wide open.  Lastly officer ... Why would anybody give a goalie who's footwork is so sloppy and his pipe to pipe push is nonexistent ... Need proof? Game 3 GWG ... 6 million dollar goalie folks."
hawks,3a2kwf,1point-21-jigowatz,2,Wed Jun 17 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"Consider this, Raanta takes over after dumping Crawford. His cap hit is actually 750K, but that's mostly irrelevant cuz it's still a lot less. But, he's only signed for one year. One of three things happen, 1) Blackhawks make the playoffs, Raanta doesn't play at a good level, Blackhawks get eliminated. 2) Blackhawks make playoffs, Raanta plays well, but Blackhawks get eliminated anyways. 3) Raanta plays excellent, Blackhawks win the cup again. The same situation could play out for Darling, but two years from now, instead of 1.   Now, this brings us into a UFA year for Raanta who either 1) Will not be wanted back due to poor performance and a missed opportunity if they had Crawford. 2) He'll sign for a pretty hefty, though not Crawford level contract, probably somewhere in the 4.5 million range, which makes me wonder if 1.5 million more for Crawford is really that big of a deal. 3) He'll demand cup winning money and get paid at least 6 million, thus starting this whole damn debate over again.   I'd rather have the proven one with a long term contract that will look good in 2-3 years, than have a goalie who can't win or one we'll have to sign for 6.5-7 million in one or two years. Cup winning goaltender prices go up each year.   He might leave some space up high, but he's one of the best goalies in the league on point-blank opportunities and breakaways/shootouts. Also, he's fantastic on shots high blocker side and nobody should even try to score on him 5 hole. He's not as strong post to post as Darling or Raanta, but he makes up for it with his positioning. Raanta's positioning is downright ugly sometimes and I haven't seen enough of Darling to say one way or another on his."
hawks,3a2kwf,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:46:29 2015 UTC,Crow is good but not great with his 6 mil and the level of talent behind him make him a valuable piece to move. If Crow can be packaged with Bickell and we move Sharpie also and that allows us to resign Sadd and Oduya and add depth I'm cool with that. I would love to see them extend Seabs also
hawks,3a2kwf,Zanios74,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"It's very possible they can sign Saad and Oduya easily with just Sharp and Bickell gone if Saad will take a friendly two year bridge deal. He has a pretty good incentive to take that deal as well, as he'll become a UFA again right in his prime, and if done right, the Blackhawks will have an extension in place for him well in advance to pay him big money when the cap is a bit higher. Seabrook's situation is overblown, his cap hit is already 5.8 mil and I don't seem him getting a large raise on a long term contract at all, so that'll come out as a wash."
hawks,3a2kwf,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:44:58 2015 UTC,Yeah moving Bickell will help out the problem is getting a team to take that contract. Seabs is a cornerstone of the dynasty and if he hits the open market teams will pay out the nose for him.
hawks,3a2kwf,Zanios74,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think Bickell's gonna be easier to move than people think. Sure, we're not gonna get much in return, but just him being gone will be huge for us. Any team near the cap floor in need of a little grit will be interested. Plus, he really won't be that bad on a team that can give him some second line time as a net front scoring option."
hawks,3a2kwf,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:26:22 2015 UTC,Why are you getting down-voted? In all honesty Crow is at best a decent goalie.  He made 25 saves for the shut and had an incredible defense blocking shots saving his ass.  Why does everybody consider him elite?  Let's put Crow in front of a different defense and see how many saves he can make...
hawks,3a27zw,Daltonkb,43,Tue Jun 16 17:33:20 2015 UTC,I believe in most sports you need stars and grinders. Shaw is one of our grinders. The Hawks need players like him just as much as they need Kane and Toews.
hawks,3a27zw,Zanios74,32,Tue Jun 16 19:30:12 2015 UTC,That's what makes the Hawks so successful- the role players know and understand their role and stick to it all season long
hawks,3a27zw,Queen_LaQueefah,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:06:16 2015 UTC,"The part that sucks is when the role players forget their role.  They see Kane an Toews making huge plays and they want to be a part of it.  Either that, or they get out on a line with Kane and he feeds them a beauty for a wide open net.  Then they start to think they can be one of those finesse players too.  Then the team play starts to suffer because they are missing parts of their team.  The best example I can think of right now is when Bickle simply stopped hitting people.  He had a streak of playing well on the Kane line (cause Kane makes everybody play well) and suddenly he thought he was a finesse guy.  And his play (and the teams) suffered."
hawks,3a27zw,ButtKyler,16,Wed Jun 17 11:30:04 2015 UTC,"I already loved Shaw, but his performance in these playoffs made him one of my favourites. Never stopped on every single play and did anything he could to score, Hawks need a bit more of that."

If we want to send him to rockford, we would have to place him on waivers which means that any team can sign him and take his contract off our books. If no one wants to claim him off waivers and he does go down to Rockford, we are still on the hook for his salary cap hit."

hawks,3a2ik8,RaveOn1958,45,Tue Jun 16 19:25:49 2015 UTC,"3 Cups, a Conn Smythe, and playing here for 15 years while being a top defenseman in the league for a majority of it? I say he gets it."

hawks,3a2ik8,LudwigWittJr,31,Tue Jun 16 20:53:23 2015 UTC,So far
hawks,3a2ik8,ThunderNathan,17,Tue Jun 16 21:56:04 2015 UTC,Not to mention one of only four players to play more than 700 minutes in one playoff run.
hawks,3a2ik8,SleepWouldBeNice,16,Tue Jun 16 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"Half this damn team will have their numbers retired. 19, 88, 2 are the givens."
hawks,3a2ik8,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Wed Jun 17 04:33:28 2015 UTC,You don't think big Hoss? The man will die before his contract is up and he was the runner up for mvp in my opinion. Other than Hedman I suppose
hawks,3a2ik8,Templescio,2,Wed Jun 17 17:40:21 2015 UTC,Him too. I say the other 3 because they've been Hawks since the beginning.
hawks,3a2ik8,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:00:50 2015 UTC,Its time already to seriously discuss if he's the greatest Blackhawk of all time.
hawks,3a2ik8,BigMorgan,39,Wed Jun 17 15:59:42 2015 UTC,Saad will be in there and I suspect Teuvo as well
hawks,3a2ik8,ClintEastwood41,31,Tue Jun 16 19:24:50 2015 UTC,Saad should be the first resign
hawks,3a2ik8,schultzy60,2,Tue Jun 16 21:57:23 2015 UTC,Tip priority for sure. I think he will take a discount (although still make bank)
hawks,3a2ik8,ChaplnGrillSgt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:34:22 2015 UTC,"Can't really say that. He already won a SC, couldn't really blame him for trying to cash in."
hawks,3a2ik8,meandyouandyouandme,3,Wed Jun 17 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"He's a young guy getting top line minutes on the best team in the NHL and a team now being called a dynasty. He seems to genuinely enjoy playing with Toews and Kane and Coach Q. I think as long as the Hawks offer is reasonable, he will stay. He won't be cheap, but won't take as much as he could get on the market, similar to Toews and Kane. While they still will be making bank, they could probably have gotten more if they left the Hawks. Hopefully he realizes his opportunity to become a hockey legend if he stays with the Hawks."
hawks,3a2ik8,ChaplnGrillSgt,0,Wed Jun 17 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"true, but if he takes a salary cut that means the team could deal with the cap and keep talent, leading to wins. he could get endorsement deals to balance it out"
hawks,3a2ik8,breadbeard,16,Wed Jun 17 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Saad stays, Tuevo and Panarin develop into Kane 2.0 and 3.0."

hawks,3a2ik8,NorthSideCrusader,7,Tue Jun 16 22:41:59 2015 UTC,I feel like they might trade him this off season. Get some cap space. Darling and raanta are both good for a lot less.
hawks,3a2ik8,trapper2530,9,Wed Jun 17 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're getting downvotes, I feel the same way. We've got about 5 million to spend on 10 spots: moving Crawford would really help with that. I love Sharp very much despite this lackluster season from him, but I suspect we've seen his last game as a Hawk, since he's getting close to 6 million."
hawks,3a2ik8,HTWC,0,Wed Jun 17 06:21:15 2015 UTC,It's because word on the streets (twitter) is that Crow is nearly untouchable.
hawks,3a2ik8,PageSide84,2,Wed Jun 17 13:00:12 2015 UTC,"Which I can understand, he was the goalie we expected him to be in the Finals, but this is clearly the time to maximize his trade value."
hawks,3a2ik8,jetlife_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:25:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. Would I love to keep him? Of course. Would I be surprised if they trade him while his value is high? Not at all.

hawks,3a2ik8,ChaplnGrillSgt,14,Wed Jun 17 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Richards - yes.  Vermette and Desjardins came over in a trade, though. I could believe Kimmo had a strong say in the matter of his landing spot, however."
hawks,3a2ik8,madcow256,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:36:23 2015 UTC,"I'm just confused why we game up a second rounder for Kimmo. By all accounts he was going to retire if he wasn't trade, why give up such a high pick for what was essentially, 15 games of play? The Flyers weren't going to allow him to play, so no clue why his asking price was so high."
hawks,3a2ik8,jetlife_,4,Wed Jun 17 13:29:23 2015 UTC,We needed him for Teuvo.
hawks,3a2ik8,Athilda,2,Wed Jun 17 14:04:33 2015 UTC,The growth of Teuvo post the Kimmo trade was unreal.
hawks,3a2ik8,Templescio,13,Wed Jun 17 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"Keith in particular has an awesome cap-friendly contract. Hossa, too, if he either plays decently throughout or goes off into retirement on LTIR without incurring cap recapture penalties."
hawks,3a2ik8,ChrisPummer,11,Wed Jun 17 02:04:01 2015 UTC,"salary cap hell with three cups under our hat in a short period of time, and 5 solid players locked up for probably their entire career with great young talent being farmed as well.  We are fine and are already predicted as a 13:1 odds favorite to win the cup next year.  All we have to do is get to the playoffs (which is possible with our core) and anything can happen."
hawks,3a2ik8,Nefarious-,3,Wed Jun 17 02:37:42 2015 UTC,Odds are 6:1

hawks,3a2ik8,HTWC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as much as I like Kane and Toews, 10.5m/year for each of them is crippling. If they took 9m/year instead, it'd open up a bit of room for some flexibility. Those numbers just hurt. The only hope is that the cap goes up $5m or so."
hawks,3a2ik8,Wood_Ape,-13,Wed Jun 17 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"Hate to be a downer, but having someone under contract is different than being able to keep them."

Not to take anything away from any of the other guys on the team, but it all started with these two. In 20 years, they'll put statues of these two outside the UC similar to the Hull/Mikita statues."

hawks,3a1b54,hawks198810,28,Tue Jun 16 15:07:00 2015 UTC,These type of antics are the reason I love them so much. Kane would probably also ask to make his statue taller.

hawks,3a1b54,PCarparelli,12,Tue Jun 16 16:28:52 2015 UTC,Hawks probably have 4 hall of fame players plus a coach for sure. Toews Kane hossa Keith and Q.

hawks,3a1b54,fellybacca,3,Tue Jun 16 20:12:34 2015 UTC,He definitely has. But no individual hardware and I don't think he has had a good enough career for the cups to put him over the top. I think he'll be in that Steve larmer level of blackhawks lore. Just below the HOF guys.
hawks,3a1b54,Lord_ThunderCunt,13,Tue Jun 16 20:21:54 2015 UTC,I decided to buy a sweater of the last person to score a goal before we won the cup. Drunkinly bought a Kane sweater. God damn I hope it fits. It's about time I get one of these things.

I just can't get into this era of basketball, the game is significantly less interesting compared to the game that was played in the 90s.  It seems like the player have very little invested in the game, other than getting paid.  Look at Ben Bishop, playing goalie with a torn groin muscles.  I would tear my groin just attempting to do what he did.  Guys playing on both teams, with broken bones.  To compete in the Stanley Cup finals, the teams need to be stocked with a bunch of nail spitting, dedicated hard-asses.  I just can't see the same thing in the NBA finals now."
hawks,3a4k20,hchux,3,Wed Jun 17 04:41:38 2015 UTC,"This is the reason I love hockey above any other major sport.  It is the difference between playing as a team vs playing as individuals.  Ben Bishop would not be out there if he was playing to get paid.  He was there because he did didn't want to let his team down.  Same reason Oduya was our there playing with a single arm for the last 2 games.  It's the reason they gave the cup to Timmo after the captain took it.  Going back 2 years, remember Seabrook coming to talk Toews off the ledge in the penalty box during the detroit series?  What other sport do you see teammates making that sort of effort to lift their guys up?  These guys play for each other and they truly are a team."

Toews goes into the box beyond pissed.  It was frustration that was building for a while, he was in the midst of a huge scoring drought and it boiled over when he took 3 consecutive penalties.  Seabrook, seeing that Toews is rattled, skates over and goes into the penalty box to talk with the captain.  He knew if toews unravelled the team would follow.  So he skates over and gives him some sage advice and ultimately the team turns around the series and goes into win.  I think that was a vital turning point and went to show the depth of leadership on the team."

If you just try searching for one, or two, you can slip through the hordes trying to gobble up large sets up tickets.  If you try going for four and it says none are available, then you have to waste time trying to refresh, selecting less tickets, and hunting again.  By that time it might sell out.  There will be such demand on the site that everything will get claimed and you won't have room to get four tickets, but if you only shoot for one or two on your first try you might get through.  This is how I got 10th row at the Auditorium Theater when Radiohead played there in 2006.  It sold out instantly, but I slipped by with a single."

I literally have dreamed about this happening since going to games when I was 5 years old and I cannot believe that it actually did. Never would have thought this team would be where it is after being voted the worst organization in sports not even 10 years ago. Enjoy it boys!

I remember being thrilled when they took the crown two years ago having been with them for the ups and downs of that season.  I remember last year growing closer to them than ever, when, in the midst of the roughest stretch of my life, they were often the only thing I would look forward to most days.  They were sometimes the only reason I had to smile or get excited, and those players were the closest thing I had to friends.  And now tonight, after they were with me for my ups and downs, I'm beyond ecstatic for them, crowned champions of the NHL.  Someday I'll thank them in person, but for tonight, I'll celebrate by myself and with all of you on here.  THE BLACKHAWKS HAVE WON THE STANLEY CUP!"

I listened to the games on the radio in high school when all of the games were pay-per-view, and we couldn't afford to watch them. On the weekends, I'd hang outside the dive bar down the street to watch whatever I could through the window before I got chased away by the bartender or shooed by the cops.  This. Feels. Good.

I didn't pay much attention to the NHL until this season, where I attended a game at UC in December against the Flames when I was on holiday.   I loved the experience and the game so much I bought Game pass when I got back home to Australia and tuned into every Hawks game since. I'm currently in the drivers seat driving this bandwagon but I don't care. My favourite team in Australia (Aussie rules) hasn't won the competition since 1980, which is longer than I've been alive. I am promising myself to get back to your great city and watch the hawks.   Enjoy it. Savour it. I know we've now won 3 in 6. But as you know things don't last forever. Enjoy the highs, ride the lows and it makes it to much better.  Edit: forgot to mention I also bought a hawks flag which has proudly hung on my bedroom wall since January."

hawks,3a2gf3,meandyouandyouandme,7,Tue Jun 16 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"for me it was Kane finally netting a goal in the SCF and getting that safety net goal. I was able to relax when he finally nailed it and the stadium erupted with 5 minutes left. Was I worried that tampa might get a goal? Yes. But I knew that if they did, Crow and the boys wouldn't let a second through. You could tell how frustrated Kane was with not getting passed Bishop and he finally did it in the biggest game. No way was this series going to end with Kane not getting a goal."

The last time we won the cup, I was playing minecraft with a couple friends, my dad was watching the game and he was happy when we won. I was like.. 60% happy. Fast forward a year later. My dad takes me to some awesome seats, sky box seats, and seats three rows from the ice. This is where I started to love hockey. When the 2014 playoffs began, i watched every single game only to have my dreams crushed by the LA kings. I eagerly awaited pre season and the actual season to begin. When it began, i must have watched 80-90% of all of the games. And I loved it. I loved every game. during the season, i acquired two new jersies and i wore them the entire day when we played a game. I also met Patrick Kane and Bryan Bickell, and it was awesome. Fast forward to the post season, i watched all the playoffs games and never gave up. That was worth it. Because this year, I actually got to watch our boys raise the cup above their heads and I had tears in my eyes. I love chicago, i love all of you, i love the blackhawks.  TL:DR My dad is the main reason that I love hockey as much as I do now."

hawks,3a2gf3,CreatureMike94,29,Tue Jun 16 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"I wish people who endlessly rag on Blackhawks fans for being bandwagon fans would read more stories like this.  I always say, what's the difference between a team having a lot of bandwagon fans and having the city rally around the team? If you get a lot of fans, they get called bandwagoners, if you don't, people complain that the city didn't rally around the team.  For me there is one time and one time only that it's acceptable to rag on a bandwagon fan, and that's if they try to act like they aren't one. If they pretend that they have been a fan for a long time, or will get into heated debates because they think they know more than long term fans, that's when it's a problem. But if someone accepts that they are a new fan and don't try to pretend like they are something they aren't, they're all good in my book."

I played hockey with my friends as a kid, was the only one brave enough to get between the pipes, remembered Eddie the Eagle when I was growing up in IL and I'd always pretend to be him or Patrick Roy, but a move to South FL when I was 8 (and of course Bill Wirtz) made the Blackhawks drift outta my mind. I'd check to see every now and then how they were doing, but the Bears and Cubs/Sox were my sports life for most of it.  But then came 2008. Rocky took over. I'll never forget coming home from my first college class while in my hs senior year at 8:45pm, and my Dad telling me, ""Hey, the Hawks are on Center Ice now! I bought the season package!""  And I've watched as many games as is humanly possible since the 08-09 season, and finally moved back up to IL last year while my Dad is still down in Boynton.  The Blackhawks have been my life, my love, and my religion (Thanks Be to Hoss) and my Dad was the reason it happened too  TL;DR My dad who's still in FL is the reason I love the Hawks as much as I do too"

Didn't the last rally have hundreds of thousands?  I can only imagine this is because Grant Park is not in a condition to hold the parade due to the weather yesterday, but I don't know this is much better. This is apparently ticketed too. Free, but ticketed.  There's gonna be a lot of pissed off fans."

There were hundreds of thousands at Grant Park.  I have no clue why they think that putting this at Soldier Field is a good idea.  Yes, Grant Park is water-logged.  Why can't they just do what they did in 2010, and have the rally on Michigan?  The images of that are incredible.    I can understand moving from Washington St. due to BRT construction.  But Monroe?  Why not just shift down to Madison?  This seems like it's going to be a pretty weak celebration.  There is more excitement around this Cup than there was for either of the previous two.  I'm not sure why they'd shift to a smaller capacity area and an inferior parade route."

I watched the game at work and when I got off work at 1am I drove straight to Chicago and started sniffing out the cup. I got a glimpse of the cup around 4:15am outside the UC. Kane loaded it into a van and off he went. Shortly after Shaw gave us few fans there (probably 10 or so people lined up across the street) a wave as he walked to his car and drove off. We got word that they we heading to The Mid so we made our way there. Saw coach Q leave a couple hours later, and then got to get a great close up look at the cup! Also got a big high five from a stumbling drunken Bickell, and saw a very wasted Crawford walk past us to his car. Saw a handful of others as well. Was a great night.   Cup- https://vid.me/qoo5  Bickell- https://vid.me/x3ZL  Poor Crow- https://vid.me/FQFF"

hawks,3a2gf3,Mr_Abe_Froman,6,Tue Jun 16 18:39:57 2015 UTC,I will be in Chicago for the parade for the first time. Where is a good place to go (beginning or end)? Is it better to skip the parade and go right to the rally? I really want to see the cup.
hawks,3a2gf3,fumbagrumph,4,Tue Jun 16 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"You will have to have a ticket for the rally this year (at Soldier).  Based on the number of fans from previous years and the capacity of Soldier, I wouldn't count on being able to get to the rally.  Many people seem to enjoy the portion of the parade on Michigan Ave.  I'd recommend going over there, if you are OK dealing with the crowd.  I watched from LaSalle (outside of work) last time.  It was less crowded than other areas."
hawks,3a2gf3,oojpatchoo,2,Tue Jun 16 22:26:12 2015 UTC,I don't mind the crowd. Do you know any bars that might be streaming the rally?

I blacked out and don't even remember writing most of it, but that's no excuse. So, I'm sorry, congratulations on your 3rd Cup in 6 years.

hawks,3a2gf3,Chordata1,2,Tue Jun 16 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's always been on a weekday, usually two days after the final game as I recall. No idea why it's not on the weekend but I'm guessing it has to do with crowd control considering two million people showed up ON A WEEKDAY."
hawks,3a2gf3,Lord_ThunderCunt,5,Tue Jun 16 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"Watched the game on my phone in Iceland while on vacation. This is the last time I'm booking a trip in June.

I felt like we were just sitting around the living room on a bunch of recliners talking up a storm while watching the game.  I can't tell you how much I look forward to reading your posts everyday.  While I'm bummed the season is over I'm thrilled to have found this place and look forward to next season when we can do it all over again!  Thanks everyone for an amazing playoff run.  Oh and one more thing........Hey Ryan Kesler, what was that you said again?  ""No human can withstand that many hits.""  LOL.  I hope he was watching last night.....what a tool."
hawks,3a2gf3,loaferbro,6,Tue Jun 16 20:35:58 2015 UTC,I'm a mess today. No work getting done.
hawks,3a2gf3,PageSide84,2,Tue Jun 16 23:44:57 2015 UTC,Work is stupid. LET'S GO HAWKS!
hawks,3a2gf3,loaferbro,3,Tue Jun 16 21:43:02 2015 UTC,"God damn was that a fitting end to this season. Stanbo's trade deadline deals really paid off in a major way. I was a huge critic of the trade for Vermette, but his play won me over as the season progressed and turned me into as big a Vermy fan as any. Desi proved to be everything Smitty was and more on the ice, and our Godly defensive core was able to carry Kimmo to the cup. On top of that, Crawford outplayed the supposedly superior goalie for the third series this playoffs. It was a fantastic year keeping track of our Hawks with you bunch of beauties, and let's have a fun offseason!"
hawks,3a2gf3,PageSide84,5,Tue Jun 16 22:27:23 2015 UTC,Questions for the parade!  What time should I arrive to get a decent spot on the route? Especially if it starts at 10.  Best place to park if driving?  When will tickets become available?  How will Soldier field hold hundreds of thousands?
hawks,3a2gf3,loaferbro,3,Tue Jun 16 19:00:17 2015 UTC,"Arrive Early.  AT THE LATEST, get to the route at 9.  That's just for the parade, though.    Park and Metra in.  No clue.  Hasn't been announced.   It won't.  That's why it's so stupid to have this event there."
hawks,3a2gf3,PageSide84,2,Tue Jun 16 19:10:20 2015 UTC,But trains will be so backed up. Really a better idea to take the trains? Will they modify the schedule to accommodate? I waited 2 hours at Union 2013 and that was leaving early. I figured id just drive this year.
hawks,3a2gf3,amanaboutahorse,3,Tue Jun 16 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"Lots will be full downtown.  You can try the CTA . . or walk from the West Loop, I guess.  Regardless, it will be a huge pain to get downtown.  Getting to Soldier Field, itself will be a nightmare.  I have no idea why they decided on that location."
hawks,3a2gf3,Patrick_Kane,4,Tue Jun 16 22:15:05 2015 UTC,7:31 train it is!
hawks,3a2gf3,goofynarwhal,4,Tue Jun 16 22:22:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I came down from Bucktown last time (for work, but the parade was right outside my building, so it's not much different) and it was a nightmare trying to get downtown.  It took forever to get downtown from only 2 miles out . . I can't imagine getting in from the 'burbs (making an assumption based on the driving comment)."

hawks,3a2gf3,TheGarreth,3,Tue Jun 16 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"i don't know how the Hockey Hall of Fame works but if it's anything like Baseball or Football let's just think about this team for a second. Almost Guaranteed   Toews Kane Keith  Seabrook Hossa Sharp Hammer Richards Kimmo   Probably   Crow Saad Oduya   That's 12(13 if you count Q) probably Hall of Famers. 4 Conn Smythe Winners. Gold, Silver and Bronze Olympic medal winners. A host of individual season awards AND 30 rings! This without a doubt has to be the most decorated team in the history of the NHL...."
hawks,3a2gf3,wazoo3,8,Wed Jun 17 03:40:27 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  I think Kane, Toews, Keith & Hossa go but that'll be it.  Seabs could be on the bubble but I don't see any of the rest of that bunch getting in.  Saad could very well put together a HOF-worthy resume if his career continues as this pace.  I love Crow but no.  He's not going to the HOF.  Ever.  He's just not.  All that said, simply winning championships does not get you into the HOF.  You need to have a pretty damn strong resume top to bottom with the numbers to match to make the HOF and the rest of those guys you mentioned are fantastic players but I just don't see how they're HOF-caliber.  Just being honest."
hawks,3a2gf3,Sarclown,2,Tue Jun 16 18:34:51 2015 UTC,"like i said i don't know how the Hockey Hall of Fame works. Just from a fan, sport lover perspective that's my opinion. Why the strong no on Crow? thanks for the input!  Edit: it always helps to get educated"
hawks,3a2gf3,StonewallFantana,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"He just doesn't have the regular season numbers to put him in the echelon of great goalies.  He puts up some pretty good playoff numbers but I wouldn't call them GREAT numbers nor do the numbers support him being a shutdown goalie and whether it's fair or not, he's going to be held to a higher standard because of the quality of the defense he plays behind.  Numbers aside, I think Crow slots in as a top 10 goalie (among current players) in the 6-10 range - if he's not even one of the best two or three tenders of his day, he has no chance of making the Hall."
hawks,3a2gf3,ChiefmoBaggins,2,Tue Jun 16 20:03:42 2015 UTC,understandable. Man Hockey sure is a tough sport on AND off the ice haha.

hawks,3a2gf3,loaferbro,3,Tue Jun 16 20:52:39 2015 UTC,Depends on how hot it is. There's no way I'm wearing a sweater above 80 degrees outside. Plenty of Hawks T-shirts that will work.

hawks,3a378x,jeric13xd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:25:31 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they might allow fans to congregate on the field like Spring Awakening did as well as fill up the stadium.

hawks,3a378x,QEDomelets,3,Wed Jun 17 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"There were NOT a few hundred thousand in grant park.  Not even close.  Think about lollapalooza.  every year the entire lolla grounds holds no more than 100k.  I'd say maybe 40% of the south field was full for the hawks in 2013.  So maybe 45k were there.    Again.  2 million showed up to watch the parade from the UC to Grant Park, plus the rally."
hawks,3a378x,Trakis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:53:38 2015 UTC,I think you're completely underestimating the amount of people that crammed into Grant Park. It was way more than Lolla has.

I dont know about that.  this looks like much more then ""few hundred thousand""  that said, I think 2M estimate was really high.  I would be curious to know grant park's capacity"
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,12,Wed Jun 17 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"There's VERY little chance this turns out favorable for Chicago.  Just because Soldier Field holds 70k doesn't mean only 70k will show up... They're going to end up with 2+ mil again and nowhere to put them.  Great planning, Rahm and Co."
hawks,3a378x,theduderman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:27:47 2015 UTC,They will hopefully open up the field for standing room. That'll hold a shit ton.
hawks,3a378x,QEDomelets,8,Wed Jun 17 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"Not as many as you'd think, maybe 10k more?  Plus consider crowd control - remember last year?  There was about a 50' buffer between the stage and the crowd, and then the first 50' was just players families.  Soldier Field is a LOT smaller than you think it is, and a football field is NOT that big."
hawks,3a378x,theduderman,3,Wed Jun 17 00:55:03 2015 UTC,"They said even with letting people on the field, the capacity will likely be capped at about 65-70k."
hawks,3a378x,titsforhits,0,Wed Jun 17 01:32:16 2015 UTC,Well shit.
hawks,3a378x,QEDomelets,7,Wed Jun 17 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yea. I feel like an asshole complaining about my third cup parade in six years, but 2013's parade/rally went so well that I feel like this one is gonna be a big letdown."
hawks,3a378x,titsforhits,2,Wed Jun 17 01:41:01 2015 UTC,I entirely agree...
hawks,3a378x,QEDomelets,0,Wed Jun 17 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"but at least we'll save the grass from being trampled in grant park, right guys?!  ;)"
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:18:10 2015 UTC,The field is standing room. IIRC they aren't  utilizing the stadium seats
hawks,3a378x,loaferbro,14,Wed Jun 17 13:10:27 2015 UTC,Maybe Grant Park is in bad shape from the rain? I much prefer the sea of red in the park. Soldier Field seems like a private event to me.
hawks,3a378x,Chi_jL,6,Tue Jun 16 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"Saw in a tribune article, that rain was a big factor."
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,12,Tue Jun 16 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"rain? really?  we are talking about people walking around for a few hours tops.  Lolla goes on for days rain or shine.    2 Million people got to enjoy this in 2013.  This year maybe 70/80k will get to enjoy it in a closed event.  I dunno, I think that sucks."
hawks,3a378x,fromantis,10,Tue Jun 16 21:56:12 2015 UTC,"I think they meant the rain that happened yesterday. I saw an article earlier that parts of Grant Park were still covered in water, leading to the uncertainty of where to hold the rally."
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"yea I get it, but we still have 2 full days for it to dry out and there is no rain in the forecast today or tomorrow.  I havent seen grant park today but I dont think its a lake.  I'm sure it would dry up enough in 3 days to hold a short event."
hawks,3a378x,LettuceC,9,Tue Jun 16 22:11:15 2015 UTC,"Except it's going to rain tomorrow and Thursday. This sucks, but I really think it's the best they can do."
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,-9,Tue Jun 16 22:14:12 2015 UTC,"weather.com says no rain tomorrow and ""scattered storms"" on thursday.  this is not even close to the best we can do.  edit: I refreshed weather.com and now it says ""am showers"" tomorrow.  all city residents are advised to stay home.  might trek mud in the streets, or something."

hawks,3a378x,IlliniXC,3,Wed Jun 17 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"I see rain in the forecast for both tomorrow and Thursday.   With Lollapalooza, those dates and location are locked in long in advance and doesn't the festival have the obligation to fix the grounds?   I get the frustration and join you in it, but I can see where the city would be coming from here."
hawks,3a378x,cosmonaut_koala,3,Tue Jun 16 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, Lolla is responsible for paying to have the park fixed up. If we have it at Grant Park again and the ground gets all fucked up, the city and the tax-payers will be footing the bill."
hawks,3a378x,IlliniXC,2,Wed Jun 17 04:05:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, I get that people are disappointed that it won't be at grant park and less people can attend, but unfortunately, and logically, Grant Park isn't much of an option.   It's currently raining (though lightly) and there was major flooding on Tuesday with more rain on the way. I've been to Lolla when it rained. The grounds were a disaster. Moving it from Grant Park is the right decision."
hawks,3a378x,DancingNancy4136,2,Wed Jun 17 13:35:27 2015 UTC,"It's more about what thousands of people stomping through soggy mud and grass will do to the park. The grounds would be absolutely ruined. You can't just ""fix"" dead grass... it would all have to be reseeded and then taped off to allow regrowth."
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,-10,Tue Jun 16 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  its a 1 or 3 hours max of people walking and mostly standing in one place. (not dancing, moving around to other stages, or bathroom lines at lolla for example).  for fucks sake, its a public park with grass not the botanical gardens.  if some grass gets trampled at the expense of the city celebrating with the stanley cup, so be it."
hawks,3a378x,meatyfingers,2,Tue Jun 16 23:09:25 2015 UTC,Your disagreement is moot. Lolla has a deal with the city to PAY A SHITLOAD OF MONEY toward the repair of the park post festival. This is a free event that taxpayers alone would end up paying for since it is a city-sponsored event. So I'm sorry but your disagreement means shit.
hawks,3a378x,Chordata1,5,Wed Jun 17 03:42:09 2015 UTC,I think the issue is also Lolla destroys that field even with 1 day of rain and then they pay A LOT to fix it. There are probably events scheduled in that field within the next few weeks so if the field is destroyed all those events can't go on. Lolla rained last year and it wasn't nearly as bad as the rain yesterday and that south field was destroyed. In addition the street was full of mud after from peoples shoes and that was with 100k people not 1-2 mil.   I agree the cut in the number of people who will get to enjoy it sucks.
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,-3,Tue Jun 16 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"There are probably events scheduled in that field within the next few weeks so if the field is destroyed all those events can't go on.    thats a fair point but I really dont think the park would get ""destroyed"" from this rally.  and if it did, the city and the hawks should pay to fix it.  the expense is justified IMO.  but whatever, good luck getting tickets, I'm sure those inside will have a great time."
hawks,3a378x,Chi_jL,4,Tue Jun 16 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, it's a little disappointing, it's going to be interesting to see how they handle tickets."
hawks,3a378x,titsforhits,3,Tue Jun 16 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"I fear it'll end up with a few gaming the system and a bunch of tickets to this ""free"" event will end up on resale sites. I'll probably just avoid the rally all together this time around."
hawks,3a378x,loaferbro,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:26:29 2015 UTC,"They said they didn't want to trash the field because they have upcoming concerts,  namely lolla."
hawks,3a378x,martinimike82,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:06:38 2015 UTC,I think there's a huge skateboarding event happening this weekend in Grant Park which is why I'm guessing they had to move it.
hawks,3a378x,DonCherrysSuitAMA,6,Tue Jun 16 21:46:44 2015 UTC,Will it be televised?
hawks,3a378x,QEDomelets,2,Tue Jun 16 22:33:19 2015 UTC,Probably a good portion of it. And there will be streams available online. Probably by WGN
hawks,3a378x,djb2287,5,Tue Jun 16 23:59:40 2015 UTC,Really wanted to go this year but to many circumstances preventing me. Wish it could have been like 2013s and on a friday. Oh well. To the next one i will go
hawks,3a378x,squirrelwatch,6,Wed Jun 17 00:14:27 2015 UTC,"This is pretty disappointing, don't think we're gonna even try to get tickets. But whatever, I'll just stake out a spot on the parade route, which seems pretty short this year. There's gonna be 2 million people milling around downtown regardless, the city better figure out what to do with them."
hawks,3a378x,titsforhits,5,Wed Jun 17 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"The parade in 2013 was about two miles long and this years is just a bit under a mile. Half the distance, less room along Monroe, and limited seating for the rally. I feel like an asshole bitching about my third championship parade in 6 years, but the whole event went so well in 2013 that I feel like this one will be a mess in comparison."
hawks,3a378x,treehugger312,6,Wed Jun 17 01:30:09 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad about complaining. I've had to miss the last two parades, but knew how epic they were. This will be my first one, and knowing that it's a pale fraction of what it should be is pretty disappointing."
hawks,3a378x,titsforhits,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:23:48 2015 UTC,2010 was kind of a mess but at the time I had never been to a championship parade and I was so in shock from winning the first cup that I didn't care. 2013 was amazingly well planned a laid out so that everyone had the chance to comfortably see the team. I think the limitations on this one might even be a step back from 2010.

hawks,3a378x,_Enerless_,3,Wed Jun 17 05:20:55 2015 UTC,I hope that you don't have to pick up the tickets in Chicago. I'm in Iowa so that would probably screw me over pretty badly. Either way I can' t be disappointed in what will happen on Thursday. Just being in the city for the third time will be epic.
hawks,3a378x,KE0BVT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'm in Iowa, too, and I'm wondering what the best way to do this will be.  I'd love to make a day trip out of it, but I've never been to a victory parade, nor do I really know where I should go/where I should be for a good experience.  And I'm probably super late to the party for getting inside Soldier Field."
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,-4,Tue Jun 16 23:41:57 2015 UTC,Just being in the city for the third time will be epic.   this is my frustration.  I dont think its going to be epic at all except for those inside the stadium.  parade basically goes down one street.  BFD.

I hope you find a way to enjoy yourself, because I will be... regardless of where I'm watching it from I'll be surrounded by fans. We're all there for the same reason. The city will be electric on Thursday."
hawks,3a378x,_Enerless_,3,Tue Jun 16 23:23:06 2015 UTC,"No, the rally won't be as epic as I would like, but I think that the atmosphere of the city will be a pretty cool thing to see again. In 2013, the Rally was the best thing, but it was more the moments after and before than just being there. If you just went and then left and didn't do anything with the people around the city, then you probably didn't have as good of a time as other people."

Such an injustice, I was looking forward to a Grant Park rally. Awful planning Rahm."
hawks,3a378x,jlew24asu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I looked up the cost of the 2010 and 2013 rallies. 2010 cost north of $250,000 to the city, that they got partially offset by sponsors. 2013 was more, depending on which source you read.  Other stuff I found:   ""In 2010, the final stopping point of the parade was Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive, which proved to be a dangerous intersection for such a celebration."" (Doesn't say WHY it was dangerous, but I think any of us who know that intersection don't have to strain ourselves to believe the statement.) Major cost for any rally is the extra police OT. Rallies in some other cities have cost upwards of $1 million."

hawks,3a1cqx,OnceAteABurgerAMA,10,Tue Jun 16 15:40:03 2015 UTC,It's like the cup. They get their name engraved on it after the summer and give it back to the NHL
hawks,3a1cqx,IDquad8819,7,Tue Jun 16 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"The NHL is a bit unique compared to the other major american sports leagues where in the NHL the trophies are engraved with the winners. Here is a list of all the NHL awards/trophies. As you can see nearly all of them are ""loaned"" to the winner along with their name engraved.  But for instance with the NBA and the NFL a new championship trophy is created every year. Here is Joe Gibbs in front of the 3 trophies he won for Washington. And here are the Spurs' 4 NBA Championship trophies."
hawks,3a1cqx,Greensauce,2,Tue Jun 16 19:27:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great info! I knew the Cup was obviously a ""loaned"" trophy, but that's interesting that nearly all of the NHL ones are similar to that.  I feel like that gives a totally different meaning to the trophy. Like when it's not loaned, the players are hoping to receive the honor of the award, and the trophy they receive is a good memento to show that they won it. But when it's loaned, the trophy plays a bigger significance, since it's the same exact trophy that everyone is trying to get every year, so when you get to hold that trophy, it's more historical in a sense I guess. I guess I think of it as a player can obtain The Conn Smythe trophy compared to an NBA player having their NBA Finals MVP trophy."

hawks,3a2y3z,jacobsever,22,Tue Jun 16 20:38:33 2015 UTC,Desi was GREAT he plays with so much heart each shift. He didn't put up big numbers but man do his job well. I've immediately grown to love him and love the trade the caused it.
hawks,3a2y3z,Gobyinmypants,9,Tue Jun 16 21:26:26 2015 UTC,"Loved watching Desi play, he got shafted on a trip in the final game and had two-three huge chances to score or get an assist, he's a great addition to our third line"
hawks,3a2y3z,Cartortus,4,Wed Jun 17 00:20:29 2015 UTC,He was far and away the best acquisition at the trade deadline up until Vermette started producing GWGs.  I hope we manage to retain both of them through some stroke of luck.
hawks,3a2y3z,boomer_kuwanger,4,Wed Jun 17 02:49:18 2015 UTC,I miss Ben Smith but shit man Desi and Shaw had to be aggravating as fuck to play against.  Then you escape them and Kruger is doing his thing. Such an incredible line in that role.

hawks,3a4guc,dontstopworking,8,Wed Jun 17 03:56:41 2015 UTC,"Darling is on automatically as a backup goalie who dressed during the Final. Rozsival is on automatically for playing 41+ games in the regular season.  The only ones they'll have to petition for who (IMO) deserve it are Carcillo, Nordstrom, and possibly Raanta."
hawks,3a4guc,QuebecZulu,2,Wed Jun 17 04:07:18 2015 UTC,Does this mean Ben Smith's (61 regular season games with the Hawks) name gets on the Cup too?
hawks,3a4guc,the_rah_monster,8,Wed Jun 17 04:15:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's an actual rule or just a practice, but generally you have to be with the team after the trade deadline.  Jack Johnson was traded from the Kings at the deadline in 2012 for Jeff Carter, he's not on the cup. The Rangers shipped us Tony Amonte at the deadline in 94 before going on to win.  Again, don't know if it's a rule, but it feels as though you need to finish the season with the team, and it's ultimately the team who has the final say, as they submit the list. They're free to leave off whoever they want, the rules only provide who is automatically eligible and who would require a petition; no one is ""guaranteed"" to get their name on there.  They might give him a ring, but I don't think his name will make the list."

I'm pretty sure Tracy or Laz tweeted out that whoever wins the cup will have three goalies engraved so I'm pretty sure Raanta will be on there since he dressed as a backup and that's the minimum requirement for a goalie to get on the cup.
hawks,3a4guc,Chief_Doppleganger,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:46:08 2015 UTC,"I don't recall seeing Raanta dressed as a backup during the Final, but I guess I wasn't really looking closely. I know when Vasilevskiy started, Bishop didn't dress so Tampa for sure would have had 3 goalies."
hawks,3a4guc,QuebecZulu,2,Wed Jun 17 07:46:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Gudlevskis dressed as the backup so if TBL had have won, they'd all have got their names on it."

hawks,3a4guc,pfeff,2,Wed Jun 17 13:39:34 2015 UTC,"So were Carcillo, Rundblad, Bickell, etc. The guys who don't dress for the game throw their gear on right at the end so they can join for the on ice celebrations. You're only allowed to dress two goalies, so if Raanta was ever dressed in the Final it means Darling was not."
hawks,3a4guc,QuebecZulu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:20:20 2015 UTC,Curious: What do those guys do during the game? Do they just watch from the locker room? Is there a green room back there?
hawks,3a4guc,pfeff,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"Not positive, but my guess is they're up in a box watching in suits for most of the game, then as it gets closer to the end (say, when Patrick Kane scores a lovely goal to make the result a little more certain) they make their way to the locker room to get ready."
hawks,3a4guc,QuebecZulu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"It looked like he just had a sweater, no pads.  Or his sweater is way too big."
hawks,3a4guc,KCchemist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:07:25 2015 UTC,"All the healthy scratches were dressed for the possible clincher.  Bickell and Carcillo were out there too, and so was giant Svedberg."

hawks,3a4guc,Chief_Doppleganger,2,Wed Jun 17 17:39:01 2015 UTC,Petition for Carbomb! He deserves it so much. He's had a tough year but he's been hugely important in starting the discussion on concussions.

hawks,3a3xmk,EeyoreSmore,17,Wed Jun 17 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"The whole fourth line honestly. They were arguably the most consistent line start to finish. Good defensively, and seemed to always have numerous great grinding shirts every game allowing the other lines to rest and sometimes scoring."
hawks,3a3xmk,damurphster,15,Wed Jun 17 03:13:41 2015 UTC,"Vermette, dude was an absolute beast on the face offs and those gwg goals!  Our 4th line, they forced turnovers, were physical, and kept plays alive."

I also wanted to point out Kruger in particular. Never stopped working, unafraid to go into the dirty areas and never missed a beat after getting hit. Also pitched in with a couple of important goals, especially that overtime winner vs Anaheim"
hawks,3a3xmk,the_rah_monster,4,Wed Jun 17 03:12:00 2015 UTC,Kruger is just so damn consistent. Probably the most underrated Hawk since he joined the team.

Bail out his team when the D is banged up? Done.  Bounce back from injuries and tough losses?  Done.  Stand tall in the post season?  Done.

But I have to confess that I've doubted him at times (and by that I mean a couple of times a year). That beautiful goob' has risen to the challenge on every single occasion. Intangibles and heart of a champ."
hawks,3a1suz,e39,5,Tue Jun 16 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"The entire team has a switch. The Hawks get through the season and turn it on for the playoffs. It's like an unspoken thing. Even Richards and Vermette did it when they were nowhere to be found at times during the regular season.    We all remember Crow hurting his ankle at the House of Blues this year. He didn't look good for weeks. When it counted the most, he puts on one of the greatest goal tending performances we've ever seen."
hawks,3a1suz,e39,16,Tue Jun 16 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"One of the speculated ways to get out of salary cap hell was to move Crow and Sharpie. With Crawford's massive Finals series, he's not going anywhere. He's an elite goal tender, no questions about it."
hawks,3a1suz,mikeypat15,12,Tue Jun 16 15:51:27 2015 UTC,"I want Crow to stay.  But I'm sure it will be tough for Stan this summer, he will no doubt most likely get some calls for Crow in exchange for some high draft picks/highly touted prospects.  2 Cups in 3 years, pass over for Conn Smythe (2013).  Every player has a bad game, and sadly it gets noticed more when it's a goaltender.  Crow though has shown time and time again then he can turn in a clutch game in the most important games."

With what we have waiting in the wings at $500k and $600k(which is already on the books) .... I say Corey ... Thanks for the great years you've done a nice job.  Good luck in your future endeavors. Elite goaltender?  ......no.
hawks,3a1suz,jmr33090,2,Tue Jun 16 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"Elite? Debatable, but tell me 5 goaltenders you'd rather have than Crawford.  Sure, every year he seems to get a weird injury, and then struggle his first month back. But when healthy, he's great. In the playoffs, even better. He has an incredible ability to bounce back from bad games. Some goalies let 1 bad game turn into 5, that does not happen with Crawford."
hawks,3a1suz,Calvinb27,2,Tue Jun 16 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"Lundqvist, Price, Rask, Bobrovsky, Schneider.   I think Crawford is a very, very talented goaltender, who is also inconsistent. When he's hot, like this year, he can complement and improve what is already a formidable team. I think when you're putting 6 million into your goaltending, that needs to be a strength of your team, and no matter how happy we all are now with the Hawks and with Crawford, you have to acknowledge that good pieces have to go. Who knows if the Hawks could have won in six, or even at all, without his stellar play in games 5 and 6, but then they might have won in in 5 if not for his poor play in games 2 and 3. Would you rather have Sharp or Crawford? Probably Crawford. But if it's a matter of keeping Sharp, Vermette, and Richards? and you can get amazing return and, in all likelihood, a good goaltender? That's the kind of scenario where it gets tempting for me, as an armchair GM, to pull the trigger on Crow."
hawks,3a1suz,jmr33090,5,Tue Jun 16 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"This year, Crawford's quality start percentage was better than every goalie you listed. In fact, it was the second best in the entire league. And this was a season that many people think was somewhat of a letdown for him. His save % was better than Rask and significantly better than Bobrovsky, and 0.001 behind Schneider.  Lundqvist and Price I'm not gonna argue on, however. Personally, I'd put Price, Lundqvist and probably Rinne above him. Others are debatable, but maybe Quick and Schneider. I'm not taking Rask. And I'm definitely not buying the Bobrovsky arguments at all at this point.  And this is where everyone likes to criticize me for the stats I chose saying ""of course Crawford has great stats because of the defense in front of him."" This year, the Blackhawks allowed the fewest goals in the league, while allowing the 9th most shots on goal per game. Again, this was considered somewhat of a letdown year for Crawford. The defense is not what it used to be at all, unfortunately, but Crawford stepped up.  Also, just wait, his contract is gonna look awesome in a couple years. That's the beauty of a long term contract, it's gonna hurt at first, but as time goes on, salary cap increases, and other goalies will get paid way more."
hawks,3a1suz,Calvinb27,0,Tue Jun 16 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"Statistics are very easy to skew one way or another. I would guess any goalie in the central had a disproportionate number of quality starts because the central was stacked. I don't think his contract will look good in a few years when the cap is only up 2-3 million and the hawks are without sharp, versteeg, bickell, Richards, vermette, oduya, maybe seabs... I mean I know some quality players will have to go, just after the breakdowns that have led to their losses in the playoffs to LA and some of the inconsistencies, I'm more comfortable losing crow than I am losing 15-20% of the team around him."
hawks,3a1suz,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"So, you actually want to keep bickell and his contract? Alright. Whatever man. Also, the central being stacked would make it harder to get quality starts. Facing better teams more often would lead to worse performances from a goalie... I mean, really what are you trying to say here? You're helping my point."
hawks,3a1suz,Calvinb27,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"Don't really wanna keep bickell, just making a point. And misinterpreted that as quality of opponents. Quality starts is a stat that favors you for how good you are at your best. Crawford has always been great at his best. I'm not saying he's not good, just saying he's more easily lost than any other four or five players on the hawks with decent sized contracts. And you can whip out whatever stats you want, the fact is he has cost the hawks games at times. Has he won them games? Certainly. But you don't want your goalie hot and cold, you want him steady. His hot moments have led to some of the greatest hawks playoff triumphs, but his cold ones have led to some gut-wrenching eliminations. I think there are other goalies out there who could serve his function at a similar level. That's all."
hawks,3a1suz,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"Quality start percentage is actually a measure of consistency, not a measure of how you are at your best. Idk where you pulled that bs from. If you alternate between .960 and .900 each game, that's a goalie who is great at his best, but is only gonna have a quality start percentage of 50%. Whereas if 7 out of 10 games you have a save percentage of .935, and the other three games are .900, you're actually gonna have a lower save percentage than the first scenario, but a quality start percentage of 70%. The point of this stat is to show which goalies are ""hot and cold"" as you say and which ones are more consistent. You have to be consistent to have a good quality start percentage, and Crawford's is the second best in the league.   I HATE the argument that Crawford is inconsistent. It is bullshit. At a .696 quality start percentage, Crawford is giving his team a really high chance of winning just about 7 out of 10 times on the ice. Rinne was number one, with .721, which is really great. And I bet if you took out the month after Crawford came back from injury, he'd be close to Rinne's number. I'll admit, he is really rusty when he comes back from injury, but as long as he doesn't come back right before the playoffs, I have full faith in him. This stat is becoming one of the more used metrics by front office guys, and for good reason, in my opinion."
hawks,3a1suz,1point-21-jigowatz,-2,Wed Jun 17 04:53:51 2015 UTC,"Regardless, I don't envy Stan next Monday morning when some really difficult decisions need to made.  Goin back to 2010 I thought the Hawks handled it perfect.  Dougy Wilson in San Jose knew our position and jumped all over it.  One quote stuck with me after all the drama when Nemo wanted 2.75 and the Hawks were offering 2.1 ... They said they would rather pay for the guys in front of the goalie than pay the goalie.  I thought that was an amazing stance.  One we should get back to.  You've tossed out a lot of stats ... And there are Lot of ways to slice data ... I do it for a living.  Guess which goaltender was third on the team in both Save percentage and GAA.  I think we can work with whats in the wings at $500k and $600k(which is already accounted for) and use that 6 million in a lot of other important places."
hawks,3a1suz,jmr33090,2,Tue Jun 16 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna take the small sample size of Darling and Raanta's stats as significant, then I have no idea how you have a job working with data for a living. Also, that would mean that you think Darling and Raanta are the best goaltenders in the league, as their stats were better than every other goalie, not just Crawford. This argument is a joke.  Edit: Also, the Blackhawks allowed almost five shots less per game when Raanta or Darling compared to their season average. It's almost like the defense took it upon themselves to limit chances and force poorer shot attempts when Crawford wasn't starting."
hawks,3a1suz,1point-21-jigowatz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"You're quick to throw out GAA and save percentages ... wanted to make make sure the narrative included those goalies on the same team with lower gaa's and sa%.  Whether they played 1 game or 82 games.   500k and 600k. That's already accounted for which would leave us 6 million right there. For a 6 foot 7 goalie that moves like he does ... and signed for two years at 500k ... my god. Why wouldn't we try to dump crow?  Look,  I don't hate the guy,  but I see that money spent better elsewhere."
hawks,3a1suz,jmr33090,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"I don't care how big or how fast he is, all I know is that when Crawford is on, he is almost unbeatable. And when he's off, he bounces back faster than anybody. I don't want to risk a good team having unproven goaltenders in the playoffs when they could have a guy who plays big in the biggest games. Both in 2013 and this year, it's very possible the Hawks don't win the cup without Crawford. He was robbed of the Conn Smythe in 2013."

I think he's done a wonderful job.  I also think the team in front of him is the reason he did a formidable job.  6 million dollars is a lot of money to be paying a Goaltender ... Decisions are going to be made over the next few weeks ... Hard decisions ... Unpopular decisions, but they're made for the good of this team.  IMO ... With what we have waiting in the wings @ $500k and $600k already on the books ... I can see Crows 6 million being spent better elsewhere on players that play in front of the goalie."

hawks,39zuiq,Bison66,43,Tue Jun 16 04:58:08 2015 UTC,Easily the least controversial of the Conn Symthe wins for the Hawks. Guy was Mr. Everything for the Hawks
hawks,39zuiq,theduderman,37,Tue Jun 16 03:44:43 2015 UTC,"Not only won it, but it was unanimous.  9th defenseman in the history of the NHL to win it.  Pretty rare company, there."
hawks,39zuiq,Hawkeye_Dad,33,Tue Jun 16 03:52:54 2015 UTC,"For the last 5 years it's been ""Toews and Kane""...  Blackhawks fans have known it, but hopefully now the rest of the world now recognizes, its ""Toews, Kane, and Keith""."
hawks,39zuiq,Lord__Business,13,Tue Jun 16 03:47:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. And if anything it's more symbolic. Keith was obviously a stud, but we wouldn't have won without a concerted effort from everyone on this roster.   The Conn Smythe trophy goes to Keith. The Stanley Cup goes to everyone."
hawks,39zuiq,Vendredi8,5,Tue Jun 16 04:44:05 2015 UTC,Almost every time we had a crucial goal and they go back to the replay there is Keith keeping the puck in play and setting it all up or even scoring the damn thing himself!  I love this guy on our team so god damn much

hawks,39zuiq,Gobyinmypants,34,Tue Jun 16 04:10:26 2015 UTC,They said no human could survive that many hits...
hawks,39zuiq,Hard58Core,19,Tue Jun 16 04:46:52 2015 UTC,They said the triplets couldn't be contained.
hawks,39zuiq,Gadzookie2,6,Tue Jun 16 06:38:25 2015 UTC,I don't  think that I have ever heard a player hyped so much coming into a series and then never mentioned by the end of a series like Tyler Johnson was. He was so hyped and was completely shutdown.
hawks,39zuiq,BigMorgan,5,Tue Jun 16 14:32:30 2015 UTC,He was playing with a broken wrist.
hawks,39zuiq,egotripping,3,Tue Jun 16 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think you can really discount that. TyJo's a great player, we got lucky that we didn't face him at his best."
hawks,39zuiq,Sparx7,9,Tue Jun 16 16:19:55 2015 UTC,Lol this guy thinks Keith is human
hawks,39zuiq,LunarPrime,15,Tue Jun 16 12:37:14 2015 UTC,Told myself if they won this year I'd pony up for an authentic jersey. Keith made the choice easy for me.
hawks,39zuiq,TheKevinShow,6,Tue Jun 16 04:18:00 2015 UTC,Contact the Jersey Baron on eBay. Get yourself the real deal Canadian-made 2.0 authentic. It will be worth every penny.

hawks,39zuiq,Disgustoid,7,Tue Jun 16 03:37:39 2015 UTC,"Was there any question? Without his iron man play in the playoffs, no way the Blackhawks get far let alone win the Cup with their depleted defense."
hawks,39zuiq,mattwrobel,6,Tue Jun 16 03:40:34 2015 UTC,Easy pick. He's been fantastic.
hawks,39zuiq,ClayBagel,6,Tue Jun 16 03:08:34 2015 UTC,No doubt about that. His goal tonight sealed the deal. Absolutely phenomenal playoffs for him.

hawks,39zuiq,Gandalf_Radagast,3,Tue Jun 16 04:00:23 2015 UTC,3 time champs!!!!! So since the beginning of the season I told myself that I would get myself a Duncan Jersey if they won the cup ( Already have Toews and Kane) What's the best place to order online?
hawks,39zuiq,TheKevinShow,3,Tue Jun 16 04:07:36 2015 UTC,Jersey Baron on eBay. Get an authentic.
hawks,39zuiq,Gandalf_Radagast,2,Tue Jun 16 05:00:39 2015 UTC,Thanks!
hawks,39zuiq,TheKevinShow,2,Tue Jun 16 05:10:58 2015 UTC,Just a word of warning: the Edge 2.0 authentics that the Baron sells are top-of-the-line (much better than the Indonesia-made authentics from NHL.com) and are quite pricey. They are well worth every penny though.
hawks,39zuiq,Gandalf_Radagast,2,Tue Jun 16 05:14:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, also I'm having a difficult time figuring out the size. I'm about 6'2 and wear a large. Any idea what number fits best for a large?"

hawks,39zuiq,acollierr17,3,Tue Jun 16 03:32:54 2015 UTC,Keith is hands down one of the best defensemen in the league. I laugh when someone says Keith isn't good. I have the urge to slap them all the way to the UC so they can see the banners hanging and the picture of Keith with the Conn Smythe Trophy.

hawks,39zuiq,LegacyLemur,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:03:57 2015 UTC,Can we take a moment to appreciate how ridiculous that all three of our cups have had three different Conn Smythe winners? Especially considering Crow probably deserved it in 2013
hawks,39zuiq,jmr33090,0,Tue Jun 16 06:15:53 2015 UTC,Crow definitely deserved it in 2013... of course they picked the guy with a big name tho.
hawks,39zuiq,Vorrigan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:23:15 2015 UTC,Chicago runs on Duncan.......Keith
hawks,39zuiq,Cartortus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:28:19 2015 UTC,Him and Crow both put up a great Conn Smyth campaign. Crow was able to shut them out in their last game and Keith had the GWG and played about 30 minutes a game

hawks,3a0lr9,RainbowTrain,12,Tue Jun 16 10:37:34 2015 UTC,The captain looking at Kimo does it for me!
hawks,3a0lr9,Whiiteyman,16,Tue Jun 16 11:48:35 2015 UTC,It honestly seemed like Toews and Seabrook were more concerned about Kimmo having a great time and really enjoying the Cup than they were about themselves. Fucking class acts and just amazing leaders!  I cried when Toews told Kimmo to skate the Cup. Toews picked up the Cup and IMMEDIATELY went to Kimmo. So unselfish!
hawks,3a0lr9,ChaplnGrillSgt,12,Tue Jun 16 13:19:31 2015 UTC,Finally a championship pic at the UC.  Celebrating on another teams ice is great but it's even better to do it in front of the fans that have supported them all season.

hawks,3a3o7a,cstuekey87,6,Wed Jun 17 00:23:57 2015 UTC,I wouldn't pay to park at ohare. Park at a cta stop or in a close suburb for free.

hawks,3a3o7a,cstuekey87,4,Wed Jun 17 01:51:22 2015 UTC,There's some free parking at the top of this little gem garage at roughly 1610 west adams...   Source... I live in this building and my gf (and friends from Waterloo) park here all the time.   You're welcome from a fellow former Iowan.
hawks,3a3o7a,the_koob,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"1610 puts me by the Mexican consulate, Epiphany Church and a Salvation Army :\  There's a parking garage I see south of the medical center, but I imagine that's for patient parking.

hawks,3a3o7a,the_koob,2,Wed Jun 17 03:22:13 2015 UTC,it is indeed right by the mexican consulate.   If you see where this maroon car is pulling out - thats where you go up and to the left and at the top of that garage there is always some spots.
hawks,3a3o7a,McD00gle,2,Wed Jun 17 11:51:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. Try the noble square area. Bear the United center and ample parking. Honestly most of West town is decent.

hawks,3a0lu8,Jdeguzman,3,Tue Jun 16 12:42:52 2015 UTC,The best part was he didn't even know what to do with it. Toews had to tell him to take a lap. Kimmo was just so damn happy he was probably delirious.
hawks,3a0lu8,Fixner_Blount,2,Tue Jun 16 20:58:08 2015 UTC,So happy for him.  He gets to go out on top.

Dude comes back, plays on the biggest stage in the world, and gives it his all for all the time he's out there.  If that wasn't the most liberating feeling lifting that cup after the career he's led, I don't know what is."

hawks,39ztdo,gloink,6,Tue Jun 16 07:39:33 2015 UTC,"I went to my friend and was like, ""Wow he's really skating tonight!"" Seeing him go to hit a guy over 6 inches taller than him was icing on the cake :) GOOD STUFF!"
hawks,39ztdo,Jain_Farstrider,16,Tue Jun 16 14:27:14 2015 UTC,"Woah now, you guys did him great and all, but he's gonna forever be a Flyer :)"
hawks,39ztdo,lion27,23,Tue Jun 16 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"Well he can retire a Blackhawk, but live on forever in the hearts and minds of Flyers fans as a Flyer?  Fair enough?"
hawks,39ztdo,Gewehr98,4,Tue Jun 16 04:48:39 2015 UTC,Flyers might take him back for one of those 1 day contracts lol
hawks,39ztdo,GoCubsGo2015,5,Tue Jun 16 06:00:45 2015 UTC,"This better happen. He is a Flyer in everyone's heart. Glad we had him for the cup run, glad he bonded with Teuvo, but he is a Flyer forever."
hawks,39ztdo,Sarclown,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:00:42 2015 UTC,"I hope they do, he deserves to retire with HIS team"
hawks,39ztdo,GoCubsGo2015,10,Thu Jun 18 03:40:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see that happening. Hockey tends to stay away from those gimmicks, and it would be a pretty big slap in the face to the team who just carried you (deservedly so) to your only championship."
hawks,39ztdo,DoomHawk,4,Tue Jun 16 13:16:46 2015 UTC,With Toews handing him the cup like that. I don't think he would sign on out of respect even if they offered.
hawks,39ztdo,ScaresCrows,3,Tue Jun 16 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"He already said he is gonna call Hexy to work in the front office. I can see him getting a one day contract.  Also it happens in hockey. Alfie signed one with Ott, Madano signed one with Dallas."
hawks,39ztdo,Blinsin,27,Tue Jun 16 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Kimmo, Clint, Monty, Stan...the onions were strong this year."
hawks,39ztdo,Hard58Core,12,Tue Jun 16 04:17:12 2015 UTC,I wonder if they petition to get Monty on the Cup this year
hawks,39ztdo,Gewehr98,7,Tue Jun 16 04:49:16 2015 UTC,"I can't see that.  I know it's weird because of his passing, but we buried him during our last cup run and bought out his contract after that season ."
hawks,39ztdo,Hard58Core,3,Tue Jun 16 05:51:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's very true. Maybe they can have him get on as a ""in loving memory"" thing with CR? I dunno"
hawks,39ztdo,Gewehr98,6,Tue Jun 16 05:54:13 2015 UTC,they could put his number on the back of the rings they get and give one to his family.
hawks,39ztdo,beegeepee,50,Tue Jun 16 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"Seeing him, Vermette, and Richards all hoist the cup was a fantastic sight!  Edit: spelling because I'm a dipshit."
hawks,39ztdo,ClayBagel,14,Tue Jun 16 03:41:40 2015 UTC,it doesn't matter how those trades looked.  When you win the cup they were all worth it.  I'll be sad to see these guys go.  Richards was awesome in the playoffs and Vermette got better with every series.  He won 73% of his faceoffs.  That's incredible!  And that's why we traded for him.
hawks,39ztdo,Siggy778,2,Tue Jun 16 12:59:15 2015 UTC,You think Vermette is gone?
hawks,39ztdo,jacobsever,6,Tue Jun 16 15:18:17 2015 UTC,Unfortunately yes. I don't think they can afford him. And I'm not sure how he or his agent will feel about the multiple times he was scratched from the lineup.   I think the Hawks are going to have to rely heavily on their farm system to fill spots next year.
hawks,39ztdo,Siggy778,2,Tue Jun 16 15:56:08 2015 UTC,hoisting the cup eases all bad feelings.
hawks,39ztdo,Risky_Clicks_NSFW,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"The phrase ""money or cups"" should be mentioned. Imagine changing the shorty outlook on cap space bc guys are signing small contracts just for the chance at another cup. It will never happen, but I can dream!"
hawks,39ztdo,Gobyinmypants,22,Wed Jun 17 02:19:30 2015 UTC,My best friend is a Flyers fan and they have always been my number two team. Kimmo gave me a feels trip I wasn't prepared for.
hawks,39ztdo,Mr_Abe_Froman,48,Tue Jun 16 03:44:40 2015 UTC,It's almost storybook that he gets to skate off the ice after his final game as a Stanley Cup winner.
hawks,39ztdo,Broseff_Stalin,39,Tue Jun 16 03:49:32 2015 UTC,"Unreal honestly. He has lost in some of the biggest hockey playoffs in his career, guarded Kane for the last shot in 2010, only to get finally get it.  A 30 for 30 career I hope."
hawks,39ztdo,black-ra1n54,18,Tue Jun 16 04:04:56 2015 UTC,He won the battle for his life.  The cup was easy after that.
hawks,39ztdo,theBIGspread,4,Tue Jun 16 05:57:07 2015 UTC,I can hear the 30 for 30 voice.
hawks,39ztdo,bigben929,18,Tue Jun 16 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"I cussed him so many time in the few minutes he played... but when he hoisted the cup, it lets loose the water works for me"
hawks,39ztdo,sg88,3,Tue Jun 16 03:42:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he was slow, but his play was great.  I wish we had had Kimo in the regular season more so that he could have watched the skilled play that he had to offer.  The post-season wasn't the right time for him, but he kicked ass tonight (in the game), and held the cup strong."
hawks,39ztdo,mip10110100,2,Tue Jun 16 05:36:13 2015 UTC,He had legs last night man! I was watching him make plays and he honestly didn't play like he did the rest of the playoffs. It was pretty cool to watch such an older player come out strong with that hype.
hawks,39ztdo,Jain_Farstrider,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:30:14 2015 UTC,but his play was great sufficient.    FTFY.
hawks,39ztdo,beegeepee,12,Tue Jun 16 14:04:00 2015 UTC,He was a welcome addition. I'm glad we helped him get a story ending.
hawks,39ztdo,ThiefofNobility,3,Tue Jun 16 04:02:03 2015 UTC,Big believer that having a guy like that on the team was huge for the guys who have already had so much success early in their careers. These guys are professionals and know what winning the cup means but it couldn't have hurt to see and have a guy who played 15+ years who was desperate to just get his name on the cup. A great reminder to the team that you never know when your last chance might be
hawks,39ztdo,hungrylikawolf,5,Tue Jun 16 19:02:41 2015 UTC,That shout was beautiful
hawks,39ztdo,akay47smalls,5,Tue Jun 16 04:31:41 2015 UTC,"What a great send off for Kimmo.  Congrats to him on his hard work, determination and his big heart for mentoring young Teuvo."
hawks,39ztdo,ffats,4,Tue Jun 16 08:48:05 2015 UTC,We're proud to have him.  Job and career well done Kimmo.
hawks,39ztdo,sarcastroll,3,Tue Jun 16 05:06:07 2015 UTC,"The best part of Kimmo was you could tell he gave it everything he had the past few games.  He was scratched, rightfully so, due to just looking lost on the ice from that extended period of time.  In the 3 to 5 minutes he gave the Hawks the past few games he was active, he gave it everything he had and looked surprisingly quick compared to what he did prior to this series."
hawks,39ztdo,yab21,3,Tue Jun 16 19:16:13 2015 UTC,it's a little annoying to see how much he is costing us in draft picks honestly. but to be fair he does deserve this after all his years.
hawks,39ztdo,cheeseburgerwaffles,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:01 2015 UTC,He deserved it. It's nice to see a happy ending for him.
hawks,39ztdo,progmetal,2,Tue Jun 16 04:36:12 2015 UTC,I'm glad we could finally get him the Cup he deserves. Go Hawks!

hawks,3a23wg,egotripping,3,Tue Jun 16 18:47:19 2015 UTC,"Kruger, Saad, Shaw.  I have a feeling we'll only be able to keep 2.  I think Kruger and Saad are more critical than Shaw."
hawks,3a23wg,IlliniXC,3,Tue Jun 16 21:24:42 2015 UTC,"Saad's clearly the most critical of that group by a large margin, and I'd agree that Kruger is number two there largely due to the fact that he's a center and a very strong guy on the PK and defensively in general.   Hoping we can keep all 3, but obviously concerned."
hawks,3a23wg,ClutchBender,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"See, those are the sneaky losses that are difficult to accept. I can see Sharp, Carbomb, and even guys like Crowe and Oduya due to cap hits, but Shaw or Kruger would be an unpleasant surprise. ,"

hawks,39zy8d,Badgerisbest,5,Tue Jun 16 13:20:34 2015 UTC,What a peaceful excited crowd on Clark. Craziest thing i saw was plenty of women flashing the crowd and people were going crazy over it !! What a game!
hawks,39zy8d,jean-claude_vandamme,6,Tue Jun 16 06:09:42 2015 UTC,I was in that mess in 2013. Kinda wish I walked out there tonight.
hawks,39zy8d,xjimbojonesx,3,Tue Jun 16 04:26:15 2015 UTC,Those huge crowds can be a real rush.  I guess I just think I'm too old or something.  Party looks to be a really good time.  I just watched the fireworks being set off by people in/around my neighborhood.  Bucktown/Logan Sq. loves fireworks.
hawks,39zy8d,PageSide84,2,Tue Jun 16 05:38:33 2015 UTC,I was there for about an hour and it was an incredible rush

hawks,39zy8d,breadbeard,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:58:29 2015 UTC,DAMNIT! I spent the entire weekend in stupid large crowds at Spring Awakening and needed to rest yesterday. I watched it at my girlfriend's place in Jefferson Park then came out on the balcony to see the myriad of fireworks going off all over Chicago though :D

hawks,39zvj9,mikeypat15,-7,Tue Jun 16 06:12:29 2015 UTC,So does this make up for the Hawks beating you in 2010?
hawks,39zvj9,allancaesar,31,Tue Jun 16 10:43:43 2015 UTC,It was a fucking honor to have Kimmo end his career as a Hawk and a Stanley Cup Champion! Truly an amazing man and amazing player!
hawks,39zvj9,ChaplnGrillSgt,14,Tue Jun 16 03:24:14 2015 UTC,It was great to watch him hoist it just if you are a fan of the game.
hawks,39zvj9,smbr,11,Tue Jun 16 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"It was surreal going from that series in 2010 to tonight, watching Toews lift the cup and screaming at the TV, ""Give it to Kimmo!"" Watching a player like that hoist the cup for the first time in the last moments of his storied career transcends any team affiliation. It's just a beautiful moment for hockey."
hawks,39zvj9,Marenum,19,Tue Jun 16 05:23:48 2015 UTC,I would be OK if he had a Flyers t-shirt on underneath the jersey.
hawks,39zvj9,Quotered,5,Tue Jun 16 04:01:53 2015 UTC,I immediately was reminded of Sakic handing the Cup off to Ray Borque.  A grand gesture by Captain Serious and great to see Timonen haul Lord Stanley around the ice.
hawks,39zvj9,Shampoozled,10,Tue Jun 16 06:00:11 2015 UTC,"That was seriously one of the happiest moments of my life. I teared up just as Timo did. He earned it, and I loved celebrating with him."

hawks,39zvj9,Mauledbyaseal,2,Tue Jun 16 06:27:19 2015 UTC,I shed many tears of joy seeing that. Kimmo finally got the big one.

Let us not forget Darlings sacrifice that saved us from Predators near-salvation, or Smith and Richards when Kane was out for the regular season. Let us not forget the OT record setting. Do not forget Toews from behind the fucking goal line even though we lost it. Nor forget the fact our defense totally shaped up in mere months.

What a run from TB though, of all teams, you guys proved that you got the fight, and you brought it to the finals. Crazy close series, mad respect and probably see you soon too."

Idk what was up with Stamkos all these playoff games. He was a great goal scorer in the regular season. And Johnson just fizzled out after the first two series.

hawks,39zvo7,2tidesaday,2,Tue Jun 16 16:29:35 2015 UTC,Those guys DID  show up. Stamkos was soooo close to scoring so many times. Kane was getting assists and setting up plays all series. Oh yeah and he did get the clinching goal. Sometimes great stars just neutralize each other
hawks,39zvo7,ChaplnGrillSgt,6,Tue Jun 16 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"There was no one to hate on the Bolts as well. Classy team that went out with nothing to be ashamed of. The Ducks, on the other hand, were just street-punks looking for notches in their belts..."
hawks,39zvo7,LocalMexican,3,Tue Jun 16 05:36:33 2015 UTC,It certainly didn't help that you guys were sooo banged up.  If it makes you feel any better I never felt more nervous for each game in a series.
hawks,39zvo7,rdldr1,3,Tue Jun 16 05:15:22 2015 UTC,"I've always kinda liked Tampa, but after this series I think the Bolts have officially become my East team to root for. God damn is that a good, young team. Like Seabrook said, Tampa Bay can do in the next 6 years what the Hawks have done in the last 6."

hawks,39zxx2,ChicagoIce,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:15:06 2015 UTC,"I'm an Islanders fan whose had the Hawks as my west team since I was a kid. I put up a Facebook status about this being a dynasty and there is nothing but ""WHERE'S FOUR IN A ROW?""  It's like, you don't have to be the best dynasty to be one. People don't get it. No one is saying you all won four in a row, but it's insane to say 3/6 cups isn't a dynasty.  I also think it's hard to argue you guys don't have one of the most impressive rosters in any sport. Nick Leddy was a liability to your team yet was better than any of our defensemen. Hjarlmasson starts on half the teams in the league. Sharp would be the best player on a solid third of them."
hawks,39zxx2,Jellooooo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:20:14 2015 UTC,Leddy wasn't a liability in my eyes. He was paired with rosival and put behind a 3rd and 4th liners like Bryan fucking Bickel in his last years. I would do anything to have him back.

hawks,39zxx2,allancaesar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:14:08 2015 UTC,I feel like dynasty goes hand in hand with decade.  Give it three more years and see how we look.  Definitely on pace.

Very very very close, but no.  2010-2011, 2011-2012 were downright non dominant years, which makes it tough for me to get on the dynasty bandwagon.  Dynasty teams are just always dominant.  To the contrary though, sit back and look at how close we could have been to a 3-peat.  If that fluky goal had not gone in for LA in Game 7 last year, we'd likely be celebrating 4 in 6."

And as far as im concern, you guys have a much bigger rivalry with them now than the Red Wings or Blues because you are both going back and forth for it.  As a Hawks fan that must drive you nuts, but as a fan in general I think its really awesome.  Reminds me of when Detroit and Colorado would slug it out for that Stanley Cup from 1996 to 2002.   I mean serious, Wings win it in 97, 98, 2002, Avs win it in 96 and 2001, and the only little break in between them was Dallas in 99 and New Jersey in 2000.  And in your case, the only team in between you guys since 2010 was the Bruins in 2011.  2009 was my favorite Stanley Cup Finals of all time though. :D"
hawks,39zxx2,turbo86,2,Tue Jun 16 11:54:09 2015 UTC,"We all have a rivalry. FUCK THE KINGS. (Wait.. I think that's now fuck the hawks)  But seriously, most of my friendfans are King furious, so you are correct. Daughty is apparently literally Satan. We were ""robbed"" in a sense, but we owned up to our lackluster defense and Crawford breaking from that pressure on him. That series was fucking awful for me. Thiese last few series we brought the defense heat, and after our first series crawford became a beast. I truly feel we earned that. I never had the same fear playing the ducks in the conference finals.  As for your comparison, I was born in 1990. I was 6 to 12 years old for the Wings vs. Avs. It was ""sports"" to me. Jordan was on the bulls at that time so that is all I heard.  I did see the Bruins victory, but it's faint and that is just when I got into hockey so I hardly knew what the hell was going on.  2009 is a year before I truly got into it and it became my love, and not another sports event. Now I must watch 2009 on my vault. Thanks :)"
hawks,39zxx2,SamPayton,2,Tue Jun 16 12:09:15 2015 UTC,You should also watch the Conference Finals of 1996 and 97 and 20002 (Western that is) between Detroit and Colorado.  Holy crap that was amazing.  And also 1994's Eastern Conference Finals between the Rangers and Devils is considered one of the top 10 greatest series of all time.

If the 3-peat did happen or if they manage to do it again next year then I could see them being a Dynasty.

Look at the numbers and his performance in Rounds 1-3.  My biggest point to you, is Kane had a goal this series, Steven Stamkos did not.

hawks,3a2b3e,aaronm7191,2,Tue Jun 16 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"Very true. Things looked grim in the 2 months leading up to the playoffs. We couldn't keep the puck out of our net, we were relaxing and letting teams come back from 1 and 2 goal deficits and there was an overall lack of immediacy from the defense. Things did not look good leading into the Wild series.  It totally turned around in the Wild series. Guys woke up and began to defend their goalie because now Crow was having confidence issues. But then Crow turned it around after seeing Darling succeed.   By the time Anaheim showed up we were ready for some elite Hockey and it showed with great skating, goaltending and Bicksy running guys into the boards.   The team stepped up big this year after not looking great in the regular season. One goal is the epitome for this season. They always had a chance and when the other team left the door open the Hawks would come in and take over. Great season! GO HAWKS!"
hawks,3a2b3e,Kuze421,2,Tue Jun 16 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"You mean game 6? :P  That's the things that's so amazing about our boys. We are so well known for having one of the greatest offenses, if not the absolute greatest offenses in the 21st century, however what makes us such a force to be reckoned with is that our top 4 D, if put on any other team would be considered ""icon"" status.  Nobody was more deserving of the Conn Smythe than Duncan Keith.  Crawford also gets all the credit in the world. His haters can fuck off. His performance last night was legendary."
hawks,3a2b3e,JBreezyyNY,3,Tue Jun 16 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"I can't believe people still give Crawford so much shit. Outside of a couple bad stretches in the playoffs, he's been fantastic in net for us, giving us a chance to win every game, if he's not stealing the victory himself. Sure there are times where he can get in a rut, like the WCF last year against the Kings, but we still took them to OT in game 7!  Hats off to Crow."
hawks,3a2b3e,Kuze421,3,Tue Jun 16 18:43:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying that. Some people seem to forget that Crow was a large part of the reason that we even got into the playoffs. His regular season play was the best of his career methinks. And he came up big when we needed him to.

The games weren't even on TV! Of course you're going to get NEW fans when it's more available. I emphasize ""new"" because there is a difference in new and bandwagon - everyone starts somewhere. As long as you educate yourself on the game and the team, and stick with it when things get rough, anyone who cries bandwagon can piss off."

hawks,3a2acg,JBreezyyNY,5,Tue Jun 16 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"If big hoss sticks around for the duration of his contract, I can definitely see his retired too.  As of now, I'd agree, the only sure fire retires are 2, 19, and 88. But depending on what 4, 7, 50, and 81 do in the rest of their careers, and contracts that they have with us, they could see it too.   Sharpie has done a lot, and has been around since before the team turned itself around, and lead the team in points, he's done a hell of a lot, but is it enough to retire the number, as he's probably being offloaded before next season."
hawks,3a2acg,Coop3,3,Tue Jun 16 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no questions asked that Sharpie is one of the key reasons we were able to turn around in the manner in which we have. I think he'll be someone who deserves it, but doesn't get it. The only concern I have about Hoss is that he's getting pretty old, and I fear that over his next few seasons, I fear he may start to decline more rapidly. That being said, Hoss playing at 50% is better than most playing at 100% so we'll see.  We also have a lot of newer guys with serious ""franchise"" potential... Looking forward to seeing Teuvo grow as a player, and TVR play next season without injury. REALLY excited to watch Artemi Panarin next season.  I think the length of time we can keep this ""dynasty"" going is what will likely determine the number of players who earn number retirement. If Crow had been our starter in 2010, or if he wins another cup, I would put him into the ""sure fire"" category without a doubt."
hawks,3a2acg,Coop3,3,Tue Jun 16 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"On the franchise potential, I'd say Saad is Worthy of mentioning too, he's young, and has 2 cups already, and hopefully will be around for a long time.

hawks,3a2r5f,BoomNasty,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:36:29 2015 UTC,I think that's fair to an extent.  What if Cooper just kept him out there as a decoy to possibly try to free up space for Flip and Stamkos? Maybe that was the thought process?

hawks,3a2r5f,BoomNasty,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:32:27 2015 UTC,In any series teams typically have a focus on shutting down one specific line more than the others. My point is maybe Cooper knew the Hawks would hold that line down anyways and counted on it.  This allows his more veteran line room. I think it is a possibility that was Cooper's angle.

He's a solid second line C, and when he QB'd the play sending Kane behind him to score with something like 2.4 seconds left in one of the Minnesota games really opened my eyes to his leadership. He put up a lot of points for us this cup run, and played his nuts off. He's one of those seasoned vets that could see an A in my eyes, if he's on our roster next year that is."
hawks,3a2ms5,TheKevinShow,6,Tue Jun 16 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"If you're really getting an authentic jersey to commemorate this SC victory --  you need to go with the person that had the greatest impact on the result. I would say either Keith or Crawford.  I hope in 5 years Teravainen meets the expectations of his trajectory -- but it's still way too early. Timonen, cheers on a great career, but I mean, I have a hard time considering him a jersey-worthy Blackhawk.  If you're going buck the trendsetter style, I would consider Saad or Kruger. Two mission critical pieces that probably don't have jersey sales like the Toews, Kanes, Keiths."
hawks,3a2ms5,hchux,2,Tue Jun 16 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"This is what I'd suggest too.  I'd add in terms of color, the only time I'd go for a white jersey is if you were getting an older player that played when home jerseys were white, I wouldn't get a current player in a white jersey."

hawks,39wwsp,zjp_716,36,Mon Jun 15 23:23:46 2015 UTC,"Here is the text of the article  For Stan Mikita, all the Blackhawks memories are gone  By Chris Kuc - Chicago Tribune  Walk through the main floor of Jill and Stan Mikita's home in the western suburbs and you will see very little evidence that the man who owns it was one of the greatest players the sport of hockey ever has known.  Other than a portrait of the Blackhawks legend and an autographed photo of Mikita and lifelong friend Bobby Hull on the family room wall, there are few mementos indicating that it is the home of someone whose statue stands outside the United Center.  ""Stan always said he didn't need things on the wall or plaques on the shelves because he had his memories,"" Jill Mikita says.  Now, those memories are gone.  Stan Mikita has been diagnosed with suspected dementia with Lewy body, a brain disorder that can strip those with it of memory, cause hallucinations, sleep disorders and often, though not in Mikita's case, Parkinson's disease. His decline has been steep and sudden.  While the Hawks battle the Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final, a man who has been associated with the team for 59 years and still is employed as an ambassador, is unaware it is happening. Since January, Mikita has spent his days and nights in a Chicago-area facility, walking up to five miles a day and eating up a storm. At 75, his body is sound. His brain is not.  ""His mind is completely gone,"" Jill, Stan's wife of 52 years, says while sitting on the sun porch as one of her grandsons fishes in the pond out back. ""I don't like to use that term but there's no other way to describe it.""  So while other legendary Hawks players and ambassadors, including Denis Savard, Bobby Hull and Tony Esposito, have been on hand to witness the Hawks' third Stanley Cup Final series in six seasons, Mikita has not experienced the same joy. ""You know what? He doesn't know he's missing out, he has no idea,"" Jill Mikita says. ""If he was terminally ill and his mind was intact then I think I would be heartbroken. But right now, he has no idea.""  Stan Mikita spent all of his 22 years in the NHL with the Hawks and is the franchise's all-time leading scorer with 1,467 points and is second to Hull in goals with 541. The native of Sokolce, Czechoslovakia, won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player in 1967 and 1968, the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer in 1964, 1965, 1967 and 1968 and also captured the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play in 1967 and 1968, making him the only player in league history to win the Triple Crown of awards in the same season — and he did it twice. The center was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983. There were signs in recent years that something was amiss. Mikita would forget where he left his car keys or cell phone. He once got lost driving home from Medinah Country Club, a trek he had made many times. But it was in September of last year when Jill Mikita and daughter Jane said the forgetfulness increased.  ""The hardest thing was in the beginning,"" Jill says. ""You saw him slipping away. Every day you would see him and there would be less and less in his eyes. They were just going dead.""  Stan attended and skated at the Hawks' annual Christmas party Dec. 17 and a week later he was with Jill at their winter home in Florida when she ""noticed a pretty sharp decline.""  Jane traveled to Florida and the three of them came back to Chicago. On Jan. 15, he had a cat scan and later after a dinner of cabbage rolls, Stan stood up, put his hat and coat on ""and that's when it hit,"" Jill says. ""It was just bang, that was the end, the absolute end. And he never has come back from it."" It would be easy to point the finger at Mikita's years in the NHL when he played with both grace and grittiness as the cause of the dementia. The league has been hit with lawsuits from former players and the estates of deceased players alleging it didn't inform them of the dangers of repeated concussions and the possibility they would cause CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  But the Mikita family said they won't make that leap considering other factors could have been involved, including a brain aneurysm Mikita suffered in 1999 and radiation treatments in 2010 to treat tongue cancer.  ""There is no proof of anything,"" Jill Mikita says. ""We have no intentions to sue, none whatsoever. I don't think there's anybody to blame. It's just the way it is.""  Then she pauses and says quietly, ""if I could change places with him I'd do it in a heartbeat.""  A few years back, Stan Mikita let it be known that upon his death he wanted his brain donated for research and the family will abide by that. Whatever the results, including whether or not it's discovered he had CTE, the family doesn't plan to change its mind about any litigation. ""If he does have CTE, who cares? It's not going to change anything,"" Jane Mikita says. ""He played a sport and a game that he loved and that provided us as a family with a wonderful upbringing. Hockey was good to Stan and Stan was good to hockey. There is no finger to be pointed. He knew what he was doing lacing up those skates every time he got on the ice.""  Mikita was among the first players in the NHL to wear a helmet, first donning one after nearly having his right ear torn off by a shot off the stick of teammate Doug Mohns during a game against the Penguins in 1968.  The next game, Mikita took the ice with a protective cup stuffed with foam rubber taped to the ear and wearing a helmet.  ""After that, we sat down and we were talking and he said, 'Why do we put a helmet on after we get an injury? Why don't we wear it before we get the injury?,'"" Jill Mikita says. ""And that's when he started working on designing his own helmet. And he wore a helmet from that time on.""  It is those types of memories that Stan Mikita never again will have himself. He is unable to dress himself and often has to have help eating, but by all accounts is happy and physically healthy.  ""Whatever world he is in, he's content,"" Jane Mikita says.  Stan is visited every day by his wife and family and frequently by friends, including Savard, Hull, Esposito and others. Former teammates and opponents call often. Among those are former Hawks defenseman and current Sharks general manager Doug Wilson, former teammate Ab McDonald and longtime Rangers and Penguins player Vic Hadfield.  The visits aren't easy because other than rare and fleeting moments of recognition, he is not close to the same exuberant Stan Mikita who used to light up a room just by walking into it.  ""It was really hard to see him that way,"" Savard says. ""Knowing Stan all these years and just to see him the way he is now is really heartbreaking. When I see him, I don't see him unhappy because I don't think he knows what's going on and that way it kind of comforts me somewhat.""  It is hardest on the family as they see their husband, father and grandfather as a man now devoid of memories, experiencing hallucinations and sleepless nights. Basically, nothing like the man he used to be. The Mikitas wanted their story told because, ""people should know it's OK to ask us about it,"" Jane says. ""It's not like it's some big taboo subject. We're not the only ones going through this. And if we're able to give a description of what he's going through and there is someone else out there who needs help, that's how my dad was. He always wanted to help someone else.""  At the same time, seeing Stan in his current state is the most difficult thing they could have imagined.  ""We've been mourning him so when he actually goes, which could be six months or it could be 10 years, we're more ready,"" Jane says. ""I'm not going to lie to you, I pray every day that he goes because this is no quality of life. There is no dignity. And I don't say that lightly. Knowing my dad, he never would have wanted this.""  With sadness in her eyes, perhaps Jill describes it best.  ""The Stan we knew is gone,"" she says. ""Completely gone.""  ckuc@tribpub.com"

hawks,39zuyd,ricker182,6,Tue Jun 16 05:16:10 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree. Being surrounded by that amount of people totally amps you up. The atmosphere is great and it'll be a blast.

hawks,3a4bci,hockeyandquidditch,-5,Wed Jun 17 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"I understand Grant Park isn't an option, but there are still better choices than a private stadium that will fit 100k at most when 2m went in 2013. Why not close a Michigan Ave for a couple hours? They had to do that last time when it was at Grant Park anyways  EDIT: downvoted but no one can tell me how Soldier Field is better than Michigan Ave like in 2010"

hawks,3a4bci,TuckerFits,-1,Wed Jun 17 03:15:47 2015 UTC,Grant Park didn't have bathrooms for 2m people in 2013. And Soldier Field's surrounding area doesn't either
hawks,3a4bci,KikiFlowers,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:30:02 2015 UTC,Doesn't Soldier Field belong to the Chicago park district?
hawks,3a4bci,Tuilere,4,Wed Jun 17 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"It's been raining a lot in Chicago, so the usual place will still be soaked."
hawks,3a4bci,Clavis_Apocalypticae,4,Wed Jun 17 03:58:53 2015 UTC,Rallies like this cost more than people spend. Don't underestimate the public servant OT.
hawks,3a4bci,lundah,-4,Wed Jun 17 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"That's true, but it's not like it'll be a huge cost considering tourism it'll bring. Plus whether there are 500k people or 1m people on Thursday or Friday the costs will likely be similar. Having the rally definitely has a fair chunk of costs associated with it, but the incremental cost of having 1m people versus 500k is not very high.   But a city is supposed to maximize satisfaction of constituents. This decision limits people and is not in the best interest of the people of Chicago. Limiting people to this is just fucking stupid and terrible planning"
hawks,3a4bci,hchux,6,Wed Jun 17 03:19:04 2015 UTC,You've got some interesting ideas about economics and about the function of governments. You should write a book.
hawks,3a4bci,Tuilere,-4,Wed Jun 17 04:22:13 2015 UTC,How? What's crazy about understanding incremental costs or that thinking a city shouldn't try to actively limit people attending a public rally by having it during the week in a shitty location?   No one has told me how doing it in a street wouldn't be better than Soldier Field. They did it in the street in 2010. Why not this year if Grant is a swamp?

hawks,39xixb,ClutchBender,17,Mon Jun 15 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"for my son to go, I would keep the tickets. Otherwise, I would sell them: that covers braces for 2 kids, private tuition and hockey lessons. There is no YOLO when you have kids :-)"

hawks,39xixb,ChaplnGrillSgt,5,Mon Jun 15 19:01:29 2015 UTC,I tried to win tickets and was honestly struggling with whether I'd sell them or not. They were 100 level tickets worth 12k a pop... 24k pays off a large chunk of my student loans....
hawks,39xixb,ScaresCrows,12,Mon Jun 15 18:51:06 2015 UTC,You pay off those loans. You'll have fun at a bar with friends.   I would pay my mortgage. I would only have about $50k to go then. Beautiful. It's crazy what these tickets are worth.
hawks,39xixb,matdwyer,3,Mon Jun 15 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"We got tickets for 2500/each, and we were talking to a guy outside of a bar who offered us 8000 each for them thinking we were bluffing. I immediately said yes and he looked like a fucking tool to all the people in his group...   but lets be real here, you can make $11,000 in two days and buy standing room tix to still see the game. No brainer"

hawks,39xixb,saintpauli,5,Mon Jun 15 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"I was at game 4 sro. I didn't have to pay, but decided that I would never pay for sro unless I grew a foot taller.  Great to be in the building but had to rely on the televisions to watch most of the action."
hawks,39xixb,DangerousTides,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:58:38 2015 UTC,"I couldn't do SRO. Ten years of skateboarding and seven years in the military destroyed my knees and right hip. If I had the cash, I'd gladly drop it on a seat. But I couldn't stand for three-ish hours and have a mediocre view.   But-free tickets are free tickets."
hawks,39xixb,pkfc9,9,Mon Jun 15 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"this topic arose last year in New York when someone put up a 15th row seat for a million dollars, basically what happens on these sights is someone with a lot of tickets for one area will set one of their prices abnormally high to boost the average ticket price for that section, which allows them to sell their other tickets for higher than before. Then after those sell they put that ticket back down to something around that average and make sure they sell it. Should it be illegal? yes. is it illegal? hell if I know"
hawks,39xixb,HawksInSix,2,Mon Jun 15 17:55:13 2015 UTC,Yup that's exactly what he probably has in mind. Brokers do that all the time. I was scalping section 111 tix and not a single ticket was sold until a few days ago. The demand is completely artificial.
hawks,39xixb,Patrick_Kane,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"There's a very easy market solution for this: If there's an asking price that's that's a significant deviation from the average asking, an email is sent to every ticket purchaser for that game to review that price, kinda like Yelp.  Of course, not everyone will respond, but all you need is two or three ticketholders to call out the asking price as something that's completely retarded to make the point that it shouldn't be purchased."
hawks,39xixb,Badgerisbest,5,Mon Jun 15 19:03:15 2015 UTC,I want to go so bad but it's not worth standing and I can't justify 2k for a terrible seat.

hawks,39xixb,Walaument,4,Mon Jun 15 19:33:08 2015 UTC,"That's true. I have rare moments when my friends are in town though so I won't pass up the social options, I watched way too many games alone this winter. The problem is sometimes I look up and 4 minutes is gone compared to me having 110% attention on the TV at home."
hawks,39xixb,ChaplnGrillSgt,6,Mon Jun 15 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"as a someone who lives in Arizona and is a Yotes fan as well, holy FUCK tickets are expensive."
hawks,39xixb,Badgerisbest,4,Mon Jun 15 19:00:38 2015 UTC,Question: how does scalping outside the stadium work for a game like this? No way is someone carry $1000 cash and no way is someone accepting a check for that ticket.
hawks,39xixb,ItsNot1972,4,Mon Jun 15 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"Stub hub, online bank account transfer."
hawks,39xixb,Might_as_well_joinem,2,Mon Jun 15 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"Credit card swiper for your phone, costs about $20."
hawks,39xixb,matdwyer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:01:00 2015 UTC,There are plenty of people waking around with that amount to get into games like this. There is ticket booths down there and in bars. And if you find a guy selling one and he's gonna walk in with you 1000 might do it and cash talks.
hawks,39xixb,slicebishybosh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:01:26 2015 UTC,"The people that are buying the tickets for a couple thousand dollars would absolutely have that much cash on them, you wouldn't really know. I suppose the scalpers might need some extra security"
hawks,39xixb,Sparx7,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"If I had a seat for the game, I'd sell it for whatever I could get, then go buy the cheapest SRO ticket and get there about right now and grab the best spot and never move until it was over.   I make money, I still see the game. Years from now I won't care where I was in the stadium, just that I was there."

hawks,3a20sm,crustyruffles,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:39:21 2015 UTC,I thought they just had to be dressed as the backup during SCF to get engraved. That's the goalie eligibility?

hawks,3a0gec,mikeypat15,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:11:01 2015 UTC,"Agree with the choice of Toews, but I submit that the smaller NHL made for tougher competition.  Imagine this: Take the top 5 players from each current team and make 6 teams, then the top 6 starting goalies... everybody's lineup is going to be world-class."
hawks,3a0gec,Jaydubyaess,2,Tue Jun 16 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.  I was thinking of from a purely even odds standpoint 1 in 6 and 1 in 12 compared to 1 in 30.  That's only if all teams were neutral, which they weren't.  Damn you Montreal!  Edit:  Added the 1967 expansion."
hawks,3a0gec,mikeypat15,7,Tue Jun 16 18:51:18 2015 UTC,How many cups did Hull and Mikita lead us to while wearing the 'C'? It's his thrown. I'm in love
hawks,3a0gec,RCnottheCola,5,Tue Jun 16 07:10:56 2015 UTC,This is coming from a bolts fan. I would have to say toews. I love toews and would kill for him to be on my team. He may not be the best points person but he is for sure dominant. (Point in being the last couple games of the ANA series) Although Mikita and Hull were dominant the NHL is a lot harder these days and 3 cups in 8 years with only 7 core guys is remarkable. But on another note big shout out to bowman. Toews is great but being a bolts fan i hope we beat yall next year. #TAMPA2K16

They really should look at that day instead of Friday... the logistics of getting 2 million+ people into and out of the city with the weather we've had the flooding we've seen already this spring is going to be a nightmare and probably a serious public safety concern.

Also, as much as I hate to think of this: but maybe Seabrook is gone too? He will be getting a fat raise next off-season, and if Saad is resigned, that is a lot of money in a very small amount of players.  Hopefully the cap room will go up a little bit."

hawks,3a0a52,Zutx,0,Tue Jun 16 12:39:00 2015 UTC,No one is dumb enough to take on bickell's salary. He's a fine player but he's getting paid like a top 6 forward which he isnt. Perhaps on the right team he might be but it's a long shot.   More likely they'll be a lower seed next year just like 2011 while they regroup and get the young guys experience. As long as Keith doesn't succumb to age within let's say 5 years (because of the immensely heavy minute load) and the Canadian dollar situation doesn't fuck the team into having to deal a seabs or other top 7 type guy they'll easily have a chance to double their cup total before the core gets too old.   Hossa scares me though. His cap number is starting to not match production. He's still great but for how much longer.
hawks,3a0a52,splintersmaster,2,Tue Jun 16 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"Someone will take Bickell. It won't be a good return, and might actually cost us a pick, but some Carolina or Calgary will take him. They're also not trading a defenseman."

hawks,39ubq0,Konker101,4,Mon Jun 15 06:26:07 2015 UTC,This is the right answer - At his peak he was the solid D man who had some offensive upside. Was never one to have the big flashy stats but you always wanted him out there in the big moments against the other team's top guys.

Knew how to play the position and had some oh-fensive potential.  I think he was in a couple of Norris' conversations(top 5) and a bunch of all star appearances which tells you he was a well respected dMan in this league.  Not a highlight of his career, but you can see him here as he's chasing Kaner when he slid the puck through the 5 hole from the red line"

Don't view Facebook, Twitter, don't talk to any friends that are hockey fans and don't visit /r/hawks or /r/hockey. Try and stay away from the internet as a whole until you've finished work.  Then grab a link to the game, watch it and enjoy. I'm PM'ing you a link in a sec that lets you watch back high quality games without spoiling the score."

I went up to him after and he was pretty upset, but he goes ""it's just one game, we'll take this series"".  Plus he was talking to this group of girls I was with, all of which were gorgeous, and taking shots with them (wouldn't let us take pics of that for obvious reasons), but I felt that he was really enjoying being a fan and doing whatever it is we do."

Get a life with this ""he thought the fans were too loud"". At no point did he make a statement that the ""fans were too loud"". All he said was ""it loud on the ice, you can't hear much"". At no point did he even hint at complaining about it. Grow up Hawks fans."

You don't blame the conditions on the ice for a stupid mistake. You don't blame your own home crowd. You own that mistake. You don't make excuses. It was a lousy decision and he should own up to it. That is the point of this article.  GTFO of here with that ""grow up"" bullshit."

Here's what I wrote below:  I think he was big on Kane, but it was hard to tell with his dementia. He loved the Cubbies the most of all Chicago teams, but never saw them win a World Series. :("

hawks,39uai5,Harbinger147,20,Sun Jun 14 23:11:22 2015 UTC,this is Chicago. We'd be cool for no other reason than to show the Canucks up in more ways than one.

hawks,39uai5,FlexingtonIV,11,Mon Jun 15 01:20:44 2015 UTC,I would guess no the parking situation is so limited already.
hawks,39uai5,Might_as_well_joinem,10,Mon Jun 15 03:15:04 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt they will. They never have before that I'm aware of and they'd be publicizing it if they were going to do that, I'd think."
hawks,39uai5,honestbleeps,5,Mon Jun 15 02:31:49 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to, and my friend is endorsing the idea, sit outside the UC somewhere and just stream the game on my phone. If I can't be inside, might as well be close."
hawks,39uai5,miscalainaeous,5,Mon Jun 15 01:08:29 2015 UTC,"My dad (who's sadly in Florida) thinks the best option is to hang out at the bars on Madison street, cuz if we win it'll all spill out toward the UC anyway."

I will say I checked the weather and it's supposed to rain all evening tomorrow, so that could be a setback. Still trying to find somewhere in Chicago to go watch with my friend."
hawks,39uai5,sonicscrewdriveher,2,Sun Jun 14 23:29:00 2015 UTC,"It would be nice, but highly doubtful. I'm assuming the Hawks don't just spontaneously do things like this ... They'd announce it somewhere/somehow.  As for trying to find somewhere to watch the game in Chicago night?  I think all you need to do is take a left and walk in the door and you'll be there.  Have an amazing and safe time."
hawks,39uai5,1point-21-jigowatz,4,Mon Jun 15 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"UCs parking is shit, and the police/emts are probably gonna be stretched out as it is. It doesn't seem likely."
hawks,39uai5,raj96,3,Mon Jun 15 06:21:42 2015 UTC,"Would be nice but i dont think its gonna happen, a couple of reasons being there really isnt a space for everyone to watch safely, they would have to either put up a projector or play the game on those bar videoscreens on the outside of the united center and those arent really ideal for watching anything, and lastly i dont think the UC wants a crowd of people outside the arena for security and parking reasons. Having said that, i fully expect some people to still flock there. If I would be anywhere for the game tomorrow it'd definitely be wrigley, went there for the last 2 ships and it was a crazy sheer celebration riot."
hawks,39uai5,Wshark23,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:04:05 2015 UTC,Where around Wrigley do you normally go? And how early do you have to go to get there before it's fully packed?
hawks,39uai5,RunningJokes,2,Mon Jun 15 13:18:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, anywhere is going to be beyond packed, and the bars will start spilling into one another. So get there... now?  But just saying, if there's one place I could be in 12 hours, it would be there. Go and hope for the first night of a championship summer."
hawks,39uai5,kolton---,3,Mon Jun 15 15:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'd check the forecast. Very high chance of rain.   That, plus the other reasons mentions leads me to believe it won't happen."

hawks,39uai5,bud1316,0,Mon Jun 15 06:22:08 2015 UTC,also not likely as standing room was 650 and now up too 1000

hawks,39uwzc,LazyHumour,5,Mon Jun 15 12:26:23 2015 UTC,I think I remember someone else saying in an earlier thread that with AMEX you can take up to 2 guests in with you
hawks,39uwzc,PsychedelicExpansion,3,Mon Jun 15 14:00:51 2015 UTC,If so I'm still willing to buddy up. I'm not 21 so I can't drink but will watch spots for beer/bathroom runs.

hawks,39uwzc,ChaplnGrillSgt,3,Mon Jun 15 04:01:20 2015 UTC,I thought 500 was high for games 3 and 4 but figured it would be worth it for game 6...then I saw the prices and decided I'd be watching from my couch.
hawks,39uwzc,tobyj3,2,Mon Jun 15 11:12:33 2015 UTC,Tried to get tickets for game 6. Even just SRO but they sold out so damn fast. Resale prices were crazy.

hawks,39vgj3,PhilDunphy_,6,Mon Jun 15 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"They have stamkos completely surrounded, practically moated. Kane is having terrible luck. He's missing by mere inches and while they have him guarded, it's more so a case of him not getting the top shelf shot he wants or the screen he's looking for. It's fine Bc other guys are stepping up but they're locking Kane up really well, which sucks still."
hawks,39vgj3,JosePajamas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:30:14 2015 UTC,"Man, if Kane was lighting it up as usual, these games wouldn't be so nerve-racking!"
hawks,39vgj3,Nightmare_Nikki,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:56:39 2015 UTC,Yea seriously. Let Kane get a few feet of space and he will hat trick in no time.
hawks,39vgj3,JosePajamas,2,Mon Jun 15 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"Plus/minus wouldn't really show you how one player is doing individually, Corsi for% is a good stat that shows you how he's doing offensively in terms of how many shot attempts the Hawks get when he's on the ice, it shows you if he's doing well offensively but having terrible luck, or if he's just not doing well offensively at all. He has been doing well and getting/creating chances, the finish is just not there unfortunately"
hawks,39vgj3,LouChainz88,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:32:24 2015 UTC,"Advanced Stats are much better to determine how much a certain player is ""pushing the play."" In regards to Corsi, I think that both Stamkos and Toews are positive.   Everything gives given enough time. Expect tonight to be a 6-5 game, though I couldn't tell you who's going to come out on top."

hawks,39um1k,PrisonedMuffin,9,Sun Jun 14 22:36:38 2015 UTC,I trust nothing this guy says. I'm fairly confident that Kucherov is out.
hawks,39um1k,RaveOn1958,6,Sun Jun 14 23:45:35 2015 UTC,"If Kane broke his collarbone on the play he did, there is no way Kucherov didn't suffer a similar or worse fate."
hawks,39um1k,turbo86,2,Sun Jun 14 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"He'll play if he can. Regardless of how much it might hurt. Hockey players play through some crazy injuries during the playoffs, especially in the finals."
hawks,39um1k,AcousticArmor,2,Mon Jun 15 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"Kucherov would have to be superhuman to be in significantly better shape than he was 24 hours earlier when he sat out due to whatever injury he has. If the injury was something he could rebound from that quickly, no chance he's out for most of Game 5."

hawks,39rr44,materhern,49,Sun Jun 14 03:03:18 2015 UTC,Quite possibly the worst move I've ever seen by a goalie...but Hooray!
hawks,39rr44,matunascraft,7,Sun Jun 14 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"While I agree Bishop shouldn't have come out and played that, could that not be also blamed on 77?  I mean when your goalie comes out to play the puck you let him play it, you don't tackle the fuck out of him."
hawks,39rr44,Sharobob,23,Sun Jun 14 07:28:01 2015 UTC,He never saw him coming. You can see him looking back to Sharp a couple of times. Also you never expect a goalie to be that far outside of his Zone.
hawks,39rr44,meandyouandyouandme,6,Sun Jun 14 11:11:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this. Everyone is calling this Bishop's fault. I'm not a Bishop hater. Goalies are aggressive sometimes and come out to limit a player's angles, but that was a mistake. Sometimes people just mess up, and we took advantage."
hawks,39rr44,matunascraft,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:35:19 2015 UTC,Except Marty Turco.
hawks,39rr44,fire815,6,Sun Jun 14 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"Hedman is the Bolt's best defenseman, you definitely let him play the puck and stay in your net. Sharp was pressuring but was not really a threat. Like another comment said too, Hedman didn't see him until too late..."

hawks,39rr44,ThaBomb,32,Sun Jun 14 22:55:47 2015 UTC,Bishop clearly wanted to out do Crow's fuck up.

hawks,39rr44,ebenz87,15,Sun Jun 14 03:56:06 2015 UTC,This made me so happy. Wtf was bishop thinking?
hawks,39rr44,nashsmash,8,Sun Jun 14 04:14:25 2015 UTC,I don't know but he has to be in so much pain out there. I hope it is nothing serious and he comes back healthy next year. That collision can't have felt good for his lower body injury.
hawks,39rr44,JasonEAltMTG,3,Sun Jun 14 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looked like his right leg folded funny during the fall. Hopefully he's not too badly hurt."
hawks,39rr44,distortedsignal,29,Sun Jun 14 05:40:41 2015 UTC,"Usually I don't like fluke goals, but in this series i'm okay with it! Gotta take what we can get"
hawks,39rr44,rocking2rush10,6,Sun Jun 14 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't see this one as a fluke myself. It wasn't a weird bounce, it wasn't contentious, nor was it a success when Tampa did everything right. It was capitalizing on a HUGE misstep by a goaltender who I believe let the pressure affect his decision. He saw the race, got excited and wanted to disrupt the play. It was a stupid mistake, but the pressure and excitement of playing in a pivotal game in the NHL finals for the first time will generate those sort of mistakes if its your first time."
hawks,39rr44,king_of_pancakes,7,Sun Jun 14 14:00:31 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a recording of WFLA (Lightning radio) from this?

hawks,39rr44,Georgie56,13,Sun Jun 14 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"If we go on to win the cup, I would imagine this would be the mistake that haunts bishop for the rest of his career/life. That's one of those mistakes that makes you physically cringe when you think about it, even years later. Like when I was 7 and tried impressing girls on the monkey bars at the beach. Totally fell off, my bathing suit catching an exposed bolt head. I fell to the sand naked and hurt, after calling for the girls there to pay attention to me immediately prior.   Was a bad day."
hawks,39rr44,king_of_pancakes,3,Sun Jun 14 14:04:21 2015 UTC,Still not as embarrassing as Bishop's thing
hawks,39rr44,dieyoubastards,8,Sun Jun 14 23:17:09 2015 UTC,"This is the experience that I feel like the Hawks have. I think many players would have shot it the minute they had it on their stick. I think the excitement of the opportunity would undermine most, but Sharp had the presence of mind to be patient, take it right to the net and make 100% sure he buried it. No chances for miss or recovery."
hawks,39rr44,king_of_pancakes,13,Sun Jun 14 13:51:54 2015 UTC,That's most likely Sharp's last goal as a Blackhawk :(
hawks,39rr44,MartindalexC,45,Sun Jun 14 03:09:13 2015 UTC,They're is still at least one more game.
hawks,39rr44,DonCherrysSuitAMA,13,Sun Jun 14 03:09:45 2015 UTC,ONLY one more game.

hawks,39rr44,Athilda,3,Sun Jun 14 15:05:25 2015 UTC,What a goal to go out on if that's the case
hawks,39rr44,monkeymatt1836,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:21:44 2015 UTC,What makes you think he'll be traded?
hawks,39rr44,OnYourLeft1128,11,Sun Jun 14 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"Cap space for next year means some players will go. He's a veteran whose best years are behind him and has a good-sized contract, so he's a highly likely trade candidate (frankly I think he'd bring a lot to the right team who needs that little something from a vet, so hopefully he goes to a team that is in a high-hopes rebuilding like Edmonton who should be a good contender in a couple of years...the sentiment goes for anyone we end up trading)"
hawks,39rr44,nameless22,5,Sun Jun 14 05:37:54 2015 UTC,Can they not re-negotiate the contract?   I honestly wonder if i would play for less money if i knew i was on a winning team. Shit an endorsement deal could help cover the gap
hawks,39rr44,breadbeard,4,Sun Jun 14 06:38:53 2015 UTC,Per the CBA contracts cannot be re-negotiated while under effect.
hawks,39rr44,Aperture-Employee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:46:39 2015 UTC,"Ah that makes sense, thanks for the info"
hawks,39rr44,breadbeard,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"So to revive this old thread, could the Unrestricted Free Agent guys not take super cheap contracts?   I mean I understand why they would want to get the highest pay possible on the market, but couldn't they make up for the salary by being StanleyCupWinning Blackhawks and doing endorsements?"
hawks,39rr44,breadbeard,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"I pictured the leafs as a likely candidate, actually. Rebuilding and from the sounds of it, going to be losing their sniper."

hawks,39rqly,breadbeard,164,Sun Jun 14 03:28:58 2015 UTC,"I really feel like Crawford is being overlooked and under appreciated by the majority of non-Hawks hockey fans and media. He should be getting talked about as much as Hedman, how tall Bishop is and Kane being frustrated. In Crow We Trust!"
hawks,39rqly,vNatural,43,Sun Jun 14 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"Crow has been brilliant these past two games! Mabye its the flair, I switched to it before game 4."
hawks,39rqly,JohnChiBulls,29,Sun Jun 14 03:08:50 2015 UTC,CBC did do a piece about how great he has playing at one point in the third.

hawks,39rqly,Calhalen,14,Sun Jun 14 03:16:01 2015 UTC,Crawford always gets over looked. It sucks because he should get way more press than he does. Oh well I'm sure he knows that all Hawks fans think he's the best in the NHL.
hawks,39rqly,bowhunter2995,14,Sun Jun 14 03:24:33 2015 UTC,See. Here is the thing. We also have fans that are ready to crucify him after one bad game. I can't help but shake my head and laugh.
hawks,39rqly,chinkan5,7,Sun Jun 14 03:33:25 2015 UTC,true. but i'm encouraged by the knowledge that he will be well taken care of any time one of us spots him at a bar around town

hawks,39rqly,bowhunter2995,7,Sun Jun 14 03:28:55 2015 UTC,Amen to that.  Give him an offseason to actually gel with the team and it'd be amazing. He fulfills a huge need and can be the #2 center.  Love me some Vermette.
hawks,39rqly,boomer_kuwanger,10,Sun Jun 14 05:43:16 2015 UTC,I really hope he gets re-signed.  That would be great.  Desjardins as well.
hawks,39rqly,PTPM_Leroy,117,Sun Jun 14 03:44:34 2015 UTC,Steeger was playing safe and smart in the defensive zone and put the pedal to the metal while on offense. Real complete game from him.

But a lot of credit needs to go to crow with some amazing stops on some A+ chances by Tampon Bay.  Vermette and Desi are really proving to be some smart trade deadline additions by Stan Bo.  One goal. One team. One win away from lord stanley making Chicago his home again.  Let's finish them off at home.  LET'S GO HAWKS!!!*

hawks,39rwji,maximumrocker,41,Sun Jun 14 14:20:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what rules we have on tweets but I had to post it because it was the most adorable thing I've heard all week.
hawks,39rwji,tempestatic,16,Sun Jun 14 04:00:47 2015 UTC,"IIRC they're not forbidden by any means, though they're discouraged, particularly for a news story as the lowest common denominator, i.e. link to a story over a tweet if possible. In this case, IMO, it's not enough for a story, not to mention it might well be a Finnish source beyond our reach, so the tweet is fine."
hawks,39rwji,Tuilere,11,Sun Jun 14 05:59:20 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'd never link a story via a tweet.  I know people like Lazarus get their money based on clicks, and often enough people would open a tweet but not click the actual story."
hawks,39rwji,HobbitLass,8,Sun Jun 14 06:07:56 2015 UTC,All good on this front! /u/tempestatic hit the nail on the head.
hawks,39rwji,demafrost,39,Sun Jun 14 12:29:56 2015 UTC,"When we signed Kimmo, we knew he didn't have much left. But we also knew he spoke Finnish, wouldn't be a cap burden past this season, and is an experienced hockey player.  Teuvo's development this season has been great. I feel like we have to credit some of that to providing him a Finnish mentor to help bring him up and transition. And that's where Kimmo's real value has been. While we have plenty of great players, and more than one great leader, we didn't have anyone who could do it in Finnish."
hawks,39rwji,Uncle_Hoss,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:11:22 2015 UTC,"This all of this. I think it's wise for teams to have an older veteran around, even if they aren't so hot anymore. I think it can be great for the team to have that!"
hawks,39rwji,Pepsuber188,37,Tue Jun 16 06:42:50 2015 UTC,I love it. Kimmo has obviously not been the player we wanted him to be but ill be thrilled if we can cap his career with his first and only cup.   Also you can tell the players all really like him.
hawks,39rwji,eskEMO_iwl,23,Sun Jun 14 05:16:25 2015 UTC,"I thought he looked good in game 4 and 5, playing 5 mins is tough. Your not into the rhythm of the game. Hats off to him and TVR for doing their thing."
hawks,39rwji,badseedjr,25,Sun Jun 14 07:25:54 2015 UTC,"Both of them played great tonight. Timmo made zero mistakes (that i saw) which is everything we're asking of our last 2 defensemen right now, and TVR made a great play swatting a puck out of midair to prevent a quality scoring chance off a rebound"
hawks,39rwji,Uncle_Hoss,19,Sun Jun 14 07:59:34 2015 UTC,I'm so happy that Kimmo has redeemed himself after getting manhandled by Anaheim. Both for us and for his own mental state.
hawks,39rwji,TheFitz023,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:35:51 2015 UTC,"Anaheim was all over him.  They hit him on pretty much every forecheck.  Wore him down pretty effectively.  Tampa doesn't have the bodies to do that, so he's doing just fine."
hawks,39rwji,Snewell,16,Mon Jun 15 14:54:07 2015 UTC,The future is bright for TVR. Very good to see him out there after that god awful knee shattering injury. Some never skate again after that one.
hawks,39rwji,badseedjr,2,Sun Jun 14 08:02:18 2015 UTC,"He's made good decisions, but the issue still remains that he's going to be beat to the puck by the Bolts' speedy forwards, even if he's traveling half the distance they are. That's the only time I get frustrated with him. I guess it's still preferable to the younger guys like Cumiskey who are fast, but do dumb shit"
hawks,39rwji,eawgoalie,9,Sun Jun 14 12:31:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly and I think that's been a small although large difference in regards to those little spats they play. Kimmo may be slow, but Q knows exactly what he's going to get out of him. I think he's been great for what he has left in the tank this series."
hawks,39rwji,God_Ganner,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:51:06 2015 UTC,"I think he knows he'd get beat by speed, so he hasn't put himself out of position to make up for that.  When he's in their way, they aren't getting by him."
hawks,39rwji,toughands,6,Mon Jun 15 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that Kimmo/TVR is the best option for our bottom two. They both had some bad shifts in these playoffs, but they both seemed to have relaxed and found some stride."
hawks,39rwji,Aperture-Employee,3,Sun Jun 14 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I actually thought Rundblad was starting to look pretty confident, but TVR is just flat out better even coming off the injuries. Kimmo (thankfully) played much better and actually helped start the first goal's sequence with a nice puck separation play. Cumiskey is just unplayable right now though."

hawks,39so4a,tbones999,7,Sun Jun 14 12:23:25 2015 UTC,I cannot believe (i mean i definitely can) that we held off Tampa THAT LONG. I thought they were going to score and then we would score late and win. BACK TO BACK games we've held of a Desperate Lightning strike. CROW is at that CROW level and the defense had been incredible back to back games. They can smell the Cup and they wants it....the wants it bad.

As soon as I saw him heading towards the empty net I immediately though ""he's going to hit the f'ing post, isn't he?""  Such an awesome game.  As far as I'm concerned Crawford earned the Conn Smythe last night (that he SHOULD have had in 2013).  Keith has been great, but every win this series has been a ""goalie win"" when you really think about it."

Not cheap, but not as absurd as what StubHub is at right now.  My other brother sprung for his ticket on his own because it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to (hopefully) see the cup won at home. His ticket wasn't cheap, but he's super frugal and it's a once in a lifetime shot.  We're not rich. We're just all adults who've saved up and waited our whole lives for this."

Last cup they went to Harry Carays and Pony but they got back from Boston really late like 4 in the morning or something so who knows what they will do with a win at home.
hawks,39t3e6,rougass,3,Sun Jun 14 17:38:51 2015 UTC,I was at the Rockit Bar and Grille for NYE 2014. A bunch of the Hawks players showed up near the end of the night.

hawks,39rv61,JackleBee,4,Sun Jun 14 04:15:55 2015 UTC,"Based on how Q talks about him in the press conferences, he is most definitely in. Q adores the guy."
hawks,39rv61,nameless22,7,Sun Jun 14 13:47:46 2015 UTC,Q is looking to the future and knows that he needs to start grooming his next stars now. I don't think it's too ridiculous to envision a day where Teuvo has a captain's patch on his sweater.
hawks,39rv61,WP4114,5,Sun Jun 14 04:56:37 2015 UTC,":-( but that would mean Toews is gone. Though you never know, he may get at least an A somewhere. Either way, he's going to be another hell of a gem draft pick like Saad. Those guys excite me more than Toews/Kane do now (no disrespect, just that those two are growing up while T/K are already established guys so we know what we're gonna get)."
hawks,39rv61,teddyp89,3,Sun Jun 14 05:32:07 2015 UTC,Toews is 7 years older than Teuvo. Is it that hard to imagine a 31 year old Teuvo taking over the C from a 37 year old Toews?
hawks,39rv61,HollowImage,17,Sun Jun 14 05:39:14 2015 UTC,"If Toews is still on the team, yes it is hard to imagine."

He blossomed even more like a lot of us all thought he could. Q not having trust in Leddy is on Q. Not Leddy. He was misused here, similar to how Campbell was misused when he was here."

hawks,39rv61,bamzo,-1,Sun Jun 14 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"Versteeg. And then after this year, they could (and still should) trade Crawford and Bickell. That should've pulled them out of the hole, you'd have your top 4 d-men set, if you absolutely had to you could still trade Sharp,  Rozi and Oduya are both off the books and won't be coming back, same with Vermette and Richards. They'd be in a much better spot salary cap wise."
hawks,39rv61,jerry200890,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:43:02 2015 UTC,Because this team could win these 1-goal games down the stretch without Crawford...
hawks,39rv61,_Enerless_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:35:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah. There are still a whole bunch of hockey fans that get hung up on the idea of needing an ""established"" goalie. Sooner or later people have to realize, the team in front of the goalie is more important.   As far as goaltending goes in the NHL/AHL, there are a very select few goalies who, year in year out, are at the top and a whoooolllllle bunch of guys who more or less go as their team goes and have cold and hot streaks. That's why you see things like a Michael Leighton backstopped Philly team making the Final, or in this series a kid like Vasilevsky coming in and playing indistinguishable from a veteran who's had years under his belt instead of just 20 games for his entire pro career. The difference between most goalies at the NHL/AHL level is simply opportunity and the lack thereof. There are only ever 30 starting spots in the league.   Hell we've seen it here with Darling in the 1st round against Nashville, they won a Cup with Niemi. When you have a team like this, you don't need 6 million tied up in net just because you can't get over the idea that a goalie who isn't ""established"" is going to be a weak spot. I don't understand how as Hawks fans we've all seen it happen to the contrary, to the point of winning the Cup, and a lot of us still can't grasp that it really doesn't matter nearly as much as people say it does."
hawks,39rv61,badseedjr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:12:12 2015 UTC,Crawford is the reason we are up in this final. We should have gotten swept if he wasn't playing well. We had our moments but Tampa bay was the far better team for the majority of games 1-4.
hawks,39rv61,jerry200890,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"What games are you watching?  Games 1-2 were totally even, game 3 was all Hawks but they lost, Game 4 was all Tampa but they lost.  Game 5 was a better game by the Hawks; not by a ton, but they were the better team."
hawks,39rv61,leakfrei,0,Mon Jun 15 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"By far? If anything the games have been split right down the middle. There have been times, especially in Game 4, where the Hawks just completely shut down their offense. Just completely shut them down. In that game after Saad scored his goal (which would end up being the game winner) the Hawks didn't allow another shot on goal for a span of 15 or 16 minutes.   Crawford's been playing well, and he played well at the end of that Game 4 (albeit with a HUGE assist from Seabrook deflecting Stamkos'  should-have-been game tying goal which Craw was horribly out of position for) but to say he's the only reason, that's fucking insane. This series hasn't been nearly as tilted as you say it has, I'm not sure what you're watching."

hawks,39rvwi,joey_slugs,21,Sun Jun 14 03:52:38 2015 UTC,"The Blackhawks will need to play their best of the playoffs imo, the Lightning are a very good road team, have not lost three in a row in the regular season or playoffs, and are very confident in their game 7."
hawks,39rvwi,Joemoe1389,8,Sun Jun 14 04:10:29 2015 UTC,"After watching the Rangers series, I thought this would be a cakewalk. This is a very different team than that series. They want it, they're good, their coaching staff is good. Let's see if the Hawks want it more and Q and friends want it more."
hawks,39rvwi,Goliathus123,3,Sun Jun 14 09:05:01 2015 UTC,"The Hawks are also very confident in their Game 7's. With more reason to be than Tampa, really. If we play our full 60 minutes I think we'll clinch it on Monday but regardless the boys need to bring the fire."
hawks,39rvwi,Stef41,31,Sun Jun 14 15:46:19 2015 UTC,Amen!  The Blackhawks have accomplished nothing yet. Let's hold on on the celebrations and whatnot.  There is still a game left.
hawks,39rvwi,GuyOnTheLake,5,Sun Jun 14 04:00:56 2015 UTC,What i like is the guys themselves are the first to recognize that their goals are not yet reached
hawks,39rvwi,breadbeard,5,Sun Jun 14 06:50:40 2015 UTC,The sign of good leadership. The attitudes of the players just goes to show how well Toews captains this team
hawks,39rvwi,ejbraceface,5,Sun Jun 14 07:00:37 2015 UTC,"In terms of keeping emotions and adrenaline in check, I agree with you.   In place of ego, overconfidence and swagger, I'm enjoying the sense that the Hawks have learned a few things, adapted play a bit and seem much more in control of the puck and the clock.   Yes the Lightning bolts will throw lots of firepower, lots of odd maneuvers etc. But that feeling tonight, for me, was seeing a team that had a lot of trust in each other. Q has his machinery humming and the boys are finally starting to do the things I scream at them through the TV."
hawks,39rvwi,breadbeard,9,Sun Jun 14 06:49:22 2015 UTC,Thaaaaank you.  Lets not count our chickens before they hatch.  The Lighting are going to come in and play hard and dirty.
hawks,39rvwi,gonzo1158,2,Sun Jun 14 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"Hopefully our experience in SCF games, both at the coaching level and player level will make a difference. With Q getting the final matchups at home, I'd sure like to see make sure Kaner doesn't have to put up with Hedman. He hasn't had a whole of chances at putting on a show. But then again, I think I'd enjoy seeing Teuvo score a game winning goal just as much..."
hawks,39rvwi,BeagleIL,5,Sun Jun 14 13:28:32 2015 UTC,"The Hawks will win. I just don't believe that this team, while they still have Toews, Kane, Seabrook and Keith, will LOSE a Stanley Cup Final after having made  it all the way there. People can call that overconfidence, I don't really care. I'd ask those people if they've been watching the same team as I have the last 7 or 8 years. They aren't just any other good team in the playoffs."
hawks,39rvwi,jerry200890,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:39:02 2015 UTC,Some people on this sub are very touchy about confidence. I feel the same way you do and have no problems expressing it. If the Hawks lose I'll be surprised and disappointed but why does that matter so much to some people? They get so worried that you might not be giving Tampa credit. There's nothing wrong with being fully confident in your team. It's not a crime to predict victory!
hawks,39rvwi,Stef41,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. The Cup will be in the house and Tampa will try everything that has worked again and again and again.  Our boys will need to be as good if not better than they were in game 5. And they were good. Lots of blocked shots and sticks in the lane. A more aggresive forecheck.  It will be tense and hard but, it is doable."

hawks,39v8i0,Aperture-Employee,2,Mon Jun 15 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"Not directly, but it can be a bit of a factor. A player who wins a cup becomes more valuable, so everyone's price jumps a touch. However, that makes trades a bit more valuable too. Our cap remains the same though, win or lose."

hawks,39ppuu,Siggy778,20,Sat Jun 13 15:49:15 2015 UTC,NHL 15 felt like a demo. It was bare bones. I heard it was because EA moved a bunch of its producers over to the MMA game.
hawks,39ppuu,TheKevinShow,17,Sat Jun 13 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"No, it's because EA does that every time they move consoles. Because they make the games one year at a time, they're unable to update a full game in time for the new consoles so they have to put out a barebones game for the first game on the new consoles.  Or at least that's the official story."

hawks,39ppuu,ChrisAshtear,3,Sat Jun 13 18:50:02 2015 UTC,Because then they couldnt cheap out. People would release roster/jersey updates for it and then theyd have to actually add features instead of doing a crappy update

hawks,39ppuu,Optical_Endevor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that, I think they know PC players can mod their games and update the rosters mod the models and textures and they know they can't shit out the same game with a half assed mechanic on the PC market. To be honest I don't know how they get away with it on consoles."

I haven't been huge on sports video games since about the mid 90s. I played NBA Jam, Madden 64, and some MLB game I don't remember the name of for Sega Game Gear. I've never actually played a hockey video game partially because I only got into hockey in the last few years and I play a lot fewer games than I used to, and because I figured individual player control would be weird."

hawks,39ppuu,soloincarbonite,2,Sat Jun 13 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"I think it was the year after because I have these distinct memories of hearing different goal songs for different players. I know that Patrick Kane's was ""rock you like a hurricane"". Toews was "" Johnny be good"" and I'm pretty sure that Sharps was ""sharp dressed man""."
hawks,39s1ri,PrisonedMuffin,36,Sun Jun 14 05:03:47 2015 UTC,"Nowhere near the cap space for him  And not to toot our horns, but I'm sure a lot of players would like to play here."
hawks,39s1ri,Coop3,8,Sun Jun 14 05:05:25 2015 UTC,Oh I know that. And his contract is way too long. I just thought it was interesting.
hawks,39s1ri,JasonEAltMTG,14,Sun Jun 14 05:07:06 2015 UTC,I think he likely put teams he knew couldn't afford him so he can't be traded without his consent. Either that or he's desperate to go to Boston.
hawks,39s1ri,Djarum,8,Sun Jun 14 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"That is totally it. The dude wants to control his own future and I do not blame him. Probably the only team that could afford him that I could possibly seem him going to is Florida. The Panthers are probably 2 seasons away from being a real contender, they have all the talent in the world just about ready to pop. As a plus the South Florida media wouldn't hound him at all, he wouldn't be asked to ""be the man"" there like he is at times in Toronto and honestly who wouldn't like getting paid millions of dollars to play the game you love with little pressure in South Florida."
hawks,39s1ri,Coop3,4,Sun Jun 14 07:14:33 2015 UTC,"Buffalo could probably afford him too, not sure if they'd want him though. And he said he doesn't want to go to a rebuilding team."
hawks,39s1ri,Jonathan-Crane,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:22:59 2015 UTC,New Jersey is a possibility too
hawks,39s1ri,Djarum,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:19:03 2015 UTC,The Devils are still missing a couple of pieces though. Florida is just about there. I think with whoever they get in the draft and a big splash in Free Agency this summer they are going to be a force next year.
hawks,39s1ri,JasonEAltMTG,0,Sun Jun 14 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"I bet if he spent a week with Luongo, he'd want to stay in Miami"
hawks,39s1ri,king_of_pancakes,10,Sun Jun 14 08:39:37 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an interview with Brad Richards just after the trade where he'd said if you asked any player in the NHL where the'd like to play they would say the Hawks. That's one of the things our organization is doing well, is fostering an environment that attracts people. Makes hometown discounts and courting free agents easier.   As for Kessel, I have a great winger who is very good at hitting people who has a cup that we may bey able to part with, but they will have to keep 4 million of Kessels salary...  Seems fair, no?"
hawks,39s1ri,jigsawkane,5,Sun Jun 14 12:40:29 2015 UTC,"It's crazy, but if we could swing something involving Bicks and a bunch of prospects and picks for a 50% retained Phil, I'd be all over it."
hawks,39s1ri,king_of_pancakes,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think I would be, to be honest. As good as Kessel is, I feel like this series above all others have shown just how much depth is a necessary ingredient in success. Imagine where we would be if we didn't have our 4th line? Look how much a difference it has been losing Roszy. Big players make big differences, but aren't game changers, IMO.   I would do a straight up trade for Bickell for Kessel though. But only if they take 50% of his salary.   I doubt they'd be down though LOL"
hawks,39s1ri,bamacowboy6,6,Sun Jun 14 16:10:52 2015 UTC,It would be hilarious to see him play for the Habs.
hawks,39s1ri,theaanggang,3,Sun Jun 14 05:13:23 2015 UTC,He would be killed by the Montreal media if he didn't perform.
hawks,39s1ri,king_of_pancakes,3,Sun Jun 14 05:33:26 2015 UTC,"He's used to it, plus they need a scorer"
hawks,39s1ri,discometalstu,2,Sun Jun 14 05:50:11 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right, but it surprises me so much. I had thought that although he is used to it, he would want to get away from it. I would have assumed that he would want to get away from an aggressive media. Like, its gotta weigh on you you'd think, constantly criticized no matter what you do."
hawks,39s1ri,Hard58Core,3,Sun Jun 14 12:45:08 2015 UTC,"Speaking of old guys hitting the market, I was thinking Jackman might be a viable acquisition. I get the feeling we'll be looking for a veteran D-man to bring to camp this September and I think he's got another 2-3 decent years in him. Could be a good fit. What say you?"

If we traded Sharpie for him that would be close to fair, the Leafs would want more but I wouldn't give it, e would have to trade him away next year or in two years because of salary cap problems im sure. He would be a great addition and some depth"

hawks,39s3b5,slipperypooh,6,Sun Jun 14 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"I noticed Kimmo was a step slow on one puck in the defensive zone (maybe 2nd period?), but he wasn't bad. He wasn't Keith, but he wasn't bad. If that's all we get from him for the rest of the season (please one more game, please one more game please), I think that he's done all we could ask of him."
hawks,39s3b5,distortedsignal,5,Sun Jun 14 05:56:34 2015 UTC,"I think I know the exact play that you're talking about, because I got worried too. Was it when it was dumped to Crows right and he almost got beat to it?  I was just happy that he didn't get beat, while one of our faster guys would've won the race, he still made it there with the Lightning to stop an open play."
hawks,39s3b5,eskEMO_iwl,2,Sun Jun 14 11:51:15 2015 UTC,"I remember the same play. It was kind of an ""uh-oh"" moment, when Kimmo looked like he was stuck in mud."
hawks,39s3b5,13_PG_13,2,Sun Jun 14 13:51:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that was the play.  But like I said, that's really all we need from him. We don't NEED Keith, or Hjammer, or Headman (though any of these would be NICE), what we NEED is a safe, responsible, 5-10 minutes of TOI so that our main guys can take a breather. If that's all Kimmo gives us, then he's done his job. Just keep things boring, slow down the play, and keep the puck in front of Crow."
hawks,39s3b5,distortedsignal,2,Sun Jun 14 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"I was very pleased with both of them tonight. I was especially focusing on TVR, as he's the future. No complaints."
hawks,39s3b5,jmr33090,2,Sun Jun 14 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"Kimmo started to make some moves to get to the puck, there was one play along the boards where he was chasing after the puck up the boards to the Blue line in the Hawk zone. He new he was gonna get hit from behind and he did a little side step to avoid the hit and was able to poke check the puck up the boards I believe. At first I was nervous about that play but it seemed to work fine"

hawks,39lrkn,igothitbyacar,19,Fri Jun 12 17:12:36 2015 UTC,Kane & Saad have always looked good together. Kane & Richards work well too. Q just never leaves the trio together for any amount of time to get some momentum
hawks,39lrkn,smackfrog,19,Fri Jun 12 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"not only that, the 10-19-81 line was money back in the 2010 run.  I'm really happy seeing that line reunited.    Saad definitely belongs in the top 6, and putting him with Richards and Kane is perfect.  A really good fit.  I'm a tad worried it weakens the 3rd line a little bit... but I'm sure 80 and 86 will still be doing work."
hawks,39lrkn,I_only_post_here,5,Fri Jun 12 17:29:50 2015 UTC,Steeger's heart earns him that 3rd line and I think his grit will pay off in tomorrow nights game...may not be on the score sheet with a goal but I could see him being a pest with a steal or a nice A.  Edit: phone autocorrect
hawks,39lrkn,tmdean19,3,Fri Jun 12 18:23:12 2015 UTC,10-19-81 was money on Wednesday too.  Glad he's not overthinking it.

hawks,39lrkn,Flibbens,19,Fri Jun 12 22:36:30 2015 UTC,Happy to see Versteeg still in. He's been great recently.
hawks,39lrkn,SpottyRasang,11,Fri Jun 12 17:07:18 2015 UTC,I feel bad for him. He was having such a good season before his injury. He had 22 points in the first 21 games.  Now he's kaputt and constantly scrutinized. :(
hawks,39lrkn,brianskuhar,2,Fri Jun 12 18:33:26 2015 UTC,I thought he looked great in games 1 and 4 though.  Looked like his early season self.  Game 2 and the rest of the playoffs?  Not so much.
hawks,39lrkn,Lord__Business,20,Fri Jun 12 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"While I'm not sure what to make of this, I feel getting lines right is possibly the most crucial piece of the puzzle we have to figure out if we're going to win. We have been out of sync on offense a lot this series, and finding the chemistry is going to be the key to everything else.   Good thing we have the best man to do exactly that. In Q we trust."
hawks,39lrkn,taintedblu,20,Fri Jun 12 17:03:09 2015 UTC,Sharp playing with Toews and Hossa makes a lot of sense. Q has gotta get Sharpie to the net which seemed impossible on the Vermette/Taco line. Hopefully he'll have more success on net being able to rely on Hossa and Toews to enter the zone.
hawks,39lrkn,Mentalseppuku,12,Fri Jun 12 17:17:28 2015 UTC,I've seen Taco and Vermette make plays together but Sharp has been so invisible with those two I didn't even know he was on the same line.
hawks,39lrkn,taintedblu,6,Fri Jun 12 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"Yep. They'll do great with Steeger, assuming his legs hold up. I would expect to see their line with a lot of success in game 5.   The other thing I think we'll see is the return of Kane, who is under threat of Toews knocking him out of the team playoff point leader slot, but won't in good conscience let that happen for long. Good to have competitive players like that--they're the winners."
hawks,39lrkn,Chicagoiscool,2,Fri Jun 12 17:30:57 2015 UTC,I just know Sharp as being that left wing right in the circle and getting a clean pass for the one timer or wrist shot.. That's literally what I think of when I think Sharp.   Hasn't happened for a long time sadly..
hawks,39lrkn,Alliknowisnothing,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he's a monster from the circle if you can get it there. Even the blocked or missed shots are boot shakers for goalies."
hawks,39lrkn,1point-21-jigowatz,-4,Fri Jun 12 19:46:42 2015 UTC,Trusting in Q to find the right chemistry and consistency in a line is like trusting Hitler to be in charge of seating at the Goldstein/Smith wedding.  The Q blender is known to over coach at times.   I wish Q had it in him to create a line and stick with it for more than 2 games ... guys actually might know where everybody is on the ice and their tendencies.    God forbid the Sedin twinks ever play for Q.
hawks,39lrkn,smackfrog,-6,Fri Jun 12 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"By sheer odds, you'd think Q's dice rolling of the lines would hit at least once. The guy has no rhyme or reason for his shuffles...just knee jerk reactions. How can you focus when you can't get into any sort of rhythm and have to constantly worry about when you're on and who's on your line? Chemistry never has a chance to form."
hawks,39lrkn,Stef41,3,Fri Jun 12 17:47:48 2015 UTC,"Chemistry never has a chance to form.   Yet somehow it has? This could be our third Cup in 5 years. Do I think Q's blender always works? No. Most of the time though, I'm just fine with it, and I'd wager the players generally are as well. I think what you're seeing as acts of frustration by Q, or knee jerk reactions, actually stem from a ton of confidence. He has a team he can flip around and run test drives with, and he takes advantage of that."

hawks,39lrkn,FlameSama1,6,Fri Jun 12 17:32:41 2015 UTC,The other night they had Teuvo and Kane in the 4 on 4.  They were running circles around Tampa Bay.  They got the skill and the instincts to be the best line in hockey.  Why spread out when you can blitzkrieg your way to the championship?
hawks,39lrkn,STLL217,3,Fri Jun 12 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"Because there's the tradeoff that makes other lines slower. With a fast team like Tampa, it leaves you open to be exploited in the back end."

hawks,39lrkn,Flibbens,5,Fri Jun 12 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"This is a great setup I think, probably our best. If there's a downside it's that Toews and Hossa together means our two best defensive forwards are all on one line. But they've looked better offensively together so it's a good tradeoff. We have a great center setup for faceoffs, of which we've dominated pretty much the whole playoffs."

Sharp looks great when he's with Toews, and Saad is so good at possession/entrances/board-battles that I think Kane and Richards will have more good scoring opportunities   Also, what a damn shame that Bickell has been so terrible this post-season. Just imagine how much the 2013/2014 Bickell would add to these lines. It would just be unfair"
hawks,39lrkn,STLL217,3,Fri Jun 12 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"I am glad that the 4th line is back to normal.  That line has been crazy good for us throughout the playoffs, and it made little sense as to why it was mixed around during the first period last game."
hawks,39lrkn,ChristopherT,3,Fri Jun 12 18:55:11 2015 UTC,Hope this stays. I like having 86 off the 4th line. I really like having 2 burners like 23 and 86 playing together.
hawks,39lrkn,badseedjr,3,Fri Jun 12 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"I personally would like to see Shaw and Kane on the same line. Shaw's willingness to get dirty and play on the boards opens up a lot of room for Kane, which may be able to get him going."

hawks,39lrkn,shrederick,5,Fri Jun 12 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. He had no place being on the ice against a big physical team like the Ducks and was regularly targeted and thrown around like a rag doll, but he was more than serviceable on Wednesday and is a much better matchup against TB."
hawks,39lrkn,lazy_skeptic,2,Fri Jun 12 19:31:47 2015 UTC,Totally.  He got flat out exposed by the Ducks.  They went to work on him.  Tampa doesn't have those giant sized forwards to crush him like they did.
hawks,39lrkn,badseedjr,2,Fri Jun 12 19:34:05 2015 UTC,I agree he was fine.  For being 40 years old and not playing 3/4 of the season he is doing fine.  Yes he is kind of slow out there but once he is in position he is as solid as anyone in our top 4.

hawks,39mam9,Flibbens,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:40:01 2015 UTC,I really dont get Richards on the point on the top line.  It leaves no right-shot and completely throws rotation for one timers off.  Same for the 2nd line that has two right shots.  Either flip Sharp and Richards or Seabs and Dunc.
hawks,39mam9,MidgetLovingMaxx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:52:45 2015 UTC,I was thinking switch Shaw and Saad. Shaw at the net for the Seabrook shot.
hawks,39mam9,BlueLineMenace,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:30:48 2015 UTC,"Been saying this for years.  Odd thing is, even when Sharp was on the first unit, he and Dunc would play their ""correct"" sides again allowing no one-timers."
hawks,39rwpb,death54321,23,Sun Jun 14 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, Sharp will almost certainly be gone next year. So this is kind of a dumb question. Second, Sharp has played an extremely different role this year than in years past, so don't act like he just sucks now. He's still a very solid player and does things the right way. I'll be extremely sad to see him wearing a different jersey next year.  That being said, the A goes to either Saad, Seabrook or Hossa next year. Not Teuvo. Not even close. I love Teuvo, but since when is he a locker room leader?"
hawks,39rwpb,jmr33090,17,Sun Jun 14 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"I totally misread that he thought Sharp should have his A revoked and assumed the question was because Sharp is most likely going to be traded.  I kind of hate the Sharp hate starting to spread throughout the ranks.  Maybe it's because it's easier to let go of him by piling the hate on now and convincing ourselves it's a move that has to be made because of his performance but he deserves so much more than that.  He's been a member of our core and a great performer for so long, the first time we play him in a different jersey he deserves a 10 minute standing ovation and then some."
hawks,39rwpb,Stillflying,5,Sun Jun 14 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this too and it's really annoying. Sharp is very good, but his injuries pushed him into a third line role this year. People seem to be really upset with him that he's not scoring. Well, no shit, he's on the third line. He's not getting nearly the opportunities that he used to. Like I said before, it's gonna be really sad to see him in another jersey. He'll be great for any other team where he'll be first or second line."
hawks,39rwpb,jmr33090,3,Sun Jun 14 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I'd like to see Hossa get it. Saad will have his time. Tuevo hasn't even played half a regular season and is not a team leader in any way, shape, or form."
hawks,39rwpb,19Hawks,-5,Sun Jun 14 04:23:28 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying and I can definitely agree with it, from what I was thinking being given the A it would in a way force that person to start developing leadership qualities that people like Hossa probably already have. To force those qualities on a young potential player is creating a great asset that will have value for years to come.  Maybe I just don't get how the game works."
hawks,39rwpb,jmr33090,4,Sun Jun 14 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"You're either a leader or you're not. You get that A by proving you are a leader, not by others hoping you will be one at some point."
hawks,39rwpb,jmr33090,-5,Sun Jun 14 04:46:47 2015 UTC,Toews got C in 2008.  Did they know for sure he was a great leader at that point?  Maybe they did I don't know.  It seemed a very early promotion though.
hawks,39rwpb,jmr33090,5,Sun Jun 14 04:52:47 2015 UTC,"He'd been a leader at every stage of his amateur and pro career up to that point and they'd already seen him take on some impressive responsibility in the NHL. Toews has an incredible leadership ability, completely incomparable to just about anybody else active. Yes, they knew he was a leader at that point, no doubt.

hawks,39rwpb,jmr33090,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:29:05 2015 UTC,He definitely has turned out to be great for the Hawks.  I really want to see him lead the Hawks to victory once again.  He knows it's a team effort too and I can only respect him in every way possible.
hawks,39rwpb,14xman1996,3,Sun Jun 14 05:53:57 2015 UTC,Very possible he will go down as the greatest player in Blackhawk's history. It's incredible to be able to think about that when he's only 27 years old. We are somewhat spoiled...

hawks,39rwpb,14xman1996,-9,Sun Jun 14 07:31:18 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I just thought that Teuvo has a lot of potential that he himself doesn't realize.  Saad Seabrook and Hossa know they are good.  Toews is the one that has to take the main leader role.  I don't know it was just an idea."
hawks,39rwpb,rockyrococo999,12,Sun Jun 14 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"You're wondering about the ""A' for next season?  Sweet mother of god we can win the cup at home for the 1st time since Hitler was in his planning stage! WTF?"

hawks,39lhq8,bandhead3,28,Fri Jun 12 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"If its Vasilevski again, the Hawks have got to find a way to get more shots on net. No, he's not a scrub. He's one of the top goalie prospects in the world, but he's also REALLY young (20?), and this is the biggest stage in the sport. 2 SOG through the first period and only 5 in the 3rd is inexcusable. If the Hawks can steal another one in Tampa, I think they will finally give the home crowd a cup-clinching win.  EDIT: This should be the strategy regardless of who is in net, so in retrospect my comment sounds dumb. Thanks for the upvotes anyway ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
hawks,39lhq8,meatyfingers,13,Fri Jun 12 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"The worst part about the 2 shots on goal in the first period was that on both shots, Vasilevski gave up long rebounds.  He looked fairly uncomfortable."
hawks,39lhq8,yab21,11,Fri Jun 12 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"We're not talking about the game, we're talking about practice.  Game's not until tomorrow. If you're hurt, resting helps. Maybe he gets enough rest to heal up to 80% or something and can go out there. Don't know how effective he'd be, but if he looks decent on Saturday before the game, he could play. At this point, I don't think it matters. Learning a goalies quirks isn't too difficult for a player to do."
hawks,39lhq8,Wood_Ape,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"IIRC it was the lightning coach that said they knew Bishop would be getting a 3 day break. After game 4. So thru Saturday.  Plus with him not being at practice, chances are he's watching from the press box. And the Stanley Cup Final isn't something you risk your health on. Yeah it's a great career point, but it could also end your career"
hawks,39lhq8,loaferbro,5,Sat Jun 13 09:07:50 2015 UTC,"I think the switching between goalies is tough on both sides, it's hard to solve a goalie the less you see of him and on the other side you have to play tighter D if you have a rookie in goal no matter how good, just look at the Hawk's play when Darling was in net against the Preds."
hawks,39lhq8,tem13,8,Fri Jun 12 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"I think is Vaselevsky plays tomorrow and hawks beat him, they will force Bishop back into game 6 and he'll be out of sync and Hawks win the cup at home."

hawks,39g8kd,DoomHawk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"Darlings no Crow but he's proven himself. Much better than Raanta,  which is why he's our #2. Yeah it's be another issue of defense wed need to fix, but we wouldn't be S.O.L."
hawks,39g8kd,loaferbro,3,Sat Jun 13 09:12:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but you're kidding yourself if you think we could win another cup with Darling as the starter or he and Raanta splitting.  However it is easy to consider winning another cup without Sharp. I think he's a fantastic player and exemplifies what it means to be a Blackhawk. But he's this generation's Tony Amonte and it is time to let go because we couldn't back then but now we can do better (for the price)."
hawks,39g8kd,DoomHawk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:17:19 2015 UTC,"Darlings not ready obviously but he's shown promise. We may not get one for a couple years but it's not like wed have no chance at all.  IMO we should dump Raanta and Sharp, along with Rozi, Runblad, and Bickell. It'll free up plenty of room to keep Saad and lock down Teuvo long-term. Plus we will hopefully have enough to keep Richards. He's on his way out but you can tell he likes it here and it'd be a shame seeing another seasoned guy leave with these prospects coming in."
hawks,39g8kd,loaferbro,0,Sat Jun 13 15:24:02 2015 UTC,So a 30 goal scorer is easier to part ways with then a 6-11 rank goalie who is drastically over paid? Sure...makes a ton of sense.
hawks,39g8kd,bud1316,3,Sat Jun 13 13:15:34 2015 UTC,"He scored 30 2 out of the last 4 seasons, not including this season, and while he was a big factor in the last two cups, he's been pretty quiet every other playoffs including this one.  Look, I like Sharp. A LOT. But we have to be realistic because there's a salary cap and while I won't disagree that Crow is expensive, we have to keep him because there's no one even as good as him to go get and Raanta/Darling won't cut it if we want to win another cup.  Don't forget that he should've won the Conn Smythe in 2013, even Kaner knew that. Giving up Crow would be the prime example of ""don't know what you've got 'till it's gone"". How were those years after they let Niemi walk? Any recollection of the two straight disappointments and calls for Q's firing before Crawford stepped in and brought us another cup with one of the finest goaltending displays in SC Playoffs history? Sorry, but he's not as middle-of-the-road as you seem to think."

hawks,39g8kd,honestbleeps,21,Thu Jun 11 18:37:26 2015 UTC,Crow is the Eli Manning of the NHL. Consistently high performance player at a premier position that is constantly shit on.

hawks,39g8kd,unklemonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"That isn't really that close of a comparison.     Eli Manning isn't that consistent.  He is argueably really streaky.  The first year they won the super bowl they were a wild card team at 9-7.  The last 2 years Eli's numbers have been awful (not all his fault, their whole offense is bad).  Eli is more similar to Joe Flacco.  Probably not a guy who will consistently win games in the regular season, but given the right environment, have the ability to make all the plays necessary to win at the highest level.   Crawford doesn't really get shit on.  People realize Crawford is fully capable of competing at the highest level, but people also wonder how much of his success is based off the team surrounding him.  Also, Crawford has had some off the ice issues which leads people to wonder if his talent is worth the headache."
hawks,39g8kd,beegeepee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:18:23 2015 UTC,"I think Eli's better than you give him credit. Neither of they guys are necessarily elite, but certainly top ten. They both have wonderful athletic tools but tend to let them beat themselves at times. Both are inconsistent enough that their fans have short memories of their good and bad games. Most importantly, they both are proven to show up when it matters most."
hawks,39g8kd,AlbinoSnowman,2,Fri Jun 12 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"""I think Eli's better than you give him credit""  Perhaps.  I would say he is probably a top 10-15 QB most years, with the ability to perform at a Top 5 (Super Bowl Winning) level.    He doesn't consistently raise the talent of his team or routinely win a lot of games in the regular season such as Brady, P. Manning, Rodgers, or Luck/Wilson (not enough time).    He is more similar to the Rothlisberger, Flacco, Rivers, Romo, Cutler type QB's.  Puts up decent numbers, but usually not the most efficient.  Needs a pretty specific set of guys to be a division winner.  Maybe, I am just blind to the amount of hate he or Craw gets.  However, I think a lot of the criticisms about both Craw and Eli are reasonable.  They are both strong players, with some flaws, and a sort of large contract."
hawks,39g8kd,beegeepee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I work 2 jobs, so most of my games are done on the WGN app. But most of my issue with Crawford is that I feel we are paying elite goalie salary for him, when he's not consistent enough to be an elite goalie IMO. He's great, but maybe not great enough for what we are paying"
hawks,39g8kd,Skweres88,-10,Fri Jun 12 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"And the serving up soft serve game 3 wasn't the first time he's been absolutely terrible.  Crow is overrated. The guy is an above average goalie who people act like is elite-level because he stands on his head in certain big moments. I don't think we should dump him, but just realize he's not untouchable."
hawks,39g8kd,OTMuttButt,20,Fri Jun 12 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"And the serving up soft serve game 2 wasn't the first time he's been absolutely terrible.   Ohhh, you're one of those guys. Okay. I'll get to that in a minute.   Crow is overrated. The guy is an above average goalie who people act like is elite-level because he stands on his head in certain big moments. I don't think we should dump him, but just realize he's not untouchable.   Who on earth is saying he's elite? Nobody in the press, barely anyone here on reddit or out in the comments sections of facebook/twitter etc.. if anything he shoulders the blame every damn time the Blackhawks lose whether he deserves it or not.  So it's been a while since I've done one of my ""analyze each goal and the goaltending on it"" posts... Let's do it.  Goal #1: Here's Crawford's view of the puck at the point of release.  There's no way he can see through all that traffic and it's a well placed shot. There's very little more that Crawford can be expected to do here besides be clairvoyant. Watch him in the lead-up to the goal, he's trying to lean around 3 guys and find a way to see where the puck is. Nobody in their right mind can blame him for this goal. This is the D's fault for doing nothing to clear a lane or challenge the shooter.  Goal #2: Here, Crawford is screened by his own player (Hjalmarsson) at the time the shot-pass is released, and Kucherov just perfectly places a great deflection. You can almost never blame a goaltender for letting in a deflection like this. He's trying to see around a screen, he's out on top of his crease like he should be with the puck at the point, and there's just very little he can do short of being psychic to save this puck.  This is a combination of the D's fault for obstructing Crawford's view, and mostly just a great play by the Lightning.  Goal #3: Here we can criticize Crawford a bit. However, he's cheating off the post for a reason and had he made the save he anticipated, we'd be calling it a heroic save.  there's a clear passing lane to a guy in the slot - the best place you can shoot from in hockey, so Crawford's cheating off the post here so he can center himself to where he thinks the shot is coming from. Wrong decision? Obviously, in hindsight yes.  Should he have played it differently if he could see this play 100 more times?  Hard to say. Most times, you don't expect a guy to just skate toward your net and poke it in from the side like that, ESPECIALLY with Brent Seabrook standing right there. Want to make a guess as to why Seabrook doesn't come down low to stop that ridiculously-angled shot?  It's because he sees the same damn thing Crawford does.  Ultimately, Seabrook should never have let Johnson get a second tap/poke at that puck.  We'll blame this one on both Crawford and Seabrook. Maybe 60% Crawford, 40% Seabrook, but I'd still cut Crawford a little slack given the juicy slot pass that was inexplicably not made by Johnson.  Goal #4: On this one, Garrison's shot goes off of Andrew Desjardins' stick and knuckles in. Desjardins is arguably screening Crawford's view a bit, and inadvertently causes the puck to change trajectory - another instance where you can almost never fault a goaltender. It's not like he's wrongly or poorly positioned here. He's right where he ought to be considering where the puck is shot from.   So the only goal that in my mind is even debatably Crawford's fault here is the 3rd one.  Let's just give it to you and say it was a total gaffe by Crawford.  TL;DR: Suggesting Crawford ""served up soft serve"" in game 2 is a ridiculously uninformed statement."
hawks,39g8kd,honestbleeps,-6,Thu Jun 11 23:14:08 2015 UTC,"How? That would be the smart way to go about it. Bickell and Versteeg should both be gone anyway. I'll lose Crawford before I would want to lose Sharp. Nothing personal, just they can handle his loss  better than than they can Sharp's."
hawks,39g8kd,jerry200890,19,Thu Jun 11 23:49:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with wanting to see Bickell and Versteeg gone, but I don't know about retaining Sharp over Crawford. Sharp is starting to show his age and I think is firmly past his prime. Crawford is still far and away the best goalie option we have when it comes to the playoffs. Considering goalies play well later into their careers than forwards, I think we still have quite a few good years left with Crow.  Having said that, I will not complain if he goes. We have two talented goalies behind him, it would free up cap space, and we'd get something in return for him instead of letting his contract run out and walking away to another team."
hawks,39g8kd,RunningJokes,7,Thu Jun 11 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"He just led the team in scoring the year before. How is he ""firmly"" past his prime?. People were saying that the year before that season happened as well. He was hurt that season as he was this season. That shit happens. And as we all know, with Q's line blender, it can be tough to get consistent linemates or minutes at all once he goes fucking nuts. He's still a great player.   With the way they play, goalie isn't as big a concern as it would be to other teams.  You can't have that much cap space being locked up in net. Not anymore."
hawks,39g8kd,jerry200890,4,Thu Jun 11 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I forgot how well he played last year since my mind is so rooted in this season and the playoffs right now. My mistake. I still would argue that his play this season and the frequency of injuries combined with the cap situation means it's time to strike while the iron is hot. He's only got two years left on his contract and it'd be better to recoup some of the draft picks we gave away at the deadline than seeing him walk away in two years for nothing.  On top of that, I believe Crawford has an NTC. I don't know how willing he'd be to waive that just so we can retain Sharp."
hawks,39g8kd,RunningJokes,4,Thu Jun 11 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"Sharp has one too, as does Bickell. If in two years he walks away for nothing but is just as instrumental to the Hawks' success both in the playoffs and regular season as he has been for his entire career, I'll take that. Every day. He doesn't suffer from debilitating injuries or anything, he just had bad luck this season."
hawks,39g8kd,jerry200890,3,Thu Jun 11 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Every sports writer ""in the know"" seems to be pretty sure Sharp is the one being traded this offseason, so I wouldn't get your hopes up. But at the very least, you do make a good point that it can be done."
hawks,39g8kd,RunningJokes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"I've never argued it wasn't going to happen, just that it shouldn't happen. Unfortunately Stan fell into the ""big money, long term contract goalie"" trap and he's probably stuck with it even if he sees that position differently now. It was a mistake."
hawks,39g8kd,jerry200890,2,Thu Jun 11 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"Last year he was also on a much better line with Hossa and Kruger. I don't think its so much that he's past his prime, but that he's just on a line that expects more production out of him as an individual than in combination with Hossa."
hawks,39g8kd,Skweres88,2,Thu Jun 11 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I like Crow, he does a great job and there are times where he steals games but locking up that much money for a goalie isn't something you can really do unless you have a top 5 goalie in the league. I personally would prefer Sharpie to stay over Crawford I sadly don't think that's very likely though."

hawks,39g8kd,alaughinmoose,4,Thu Jun 11 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"the only benefit would be cap relief, but even as non crow lover...i dont want to see this happen either."
hawks,39g8kd,bud1316,2,Thu Jun 11 23:23:42 2015 UTC,I'm fine with Darling as a starter.  I think he will amount to a better goaltender than Crow.  I don't see the big deal with Crawford.  I think he's average at best.
hawks,39g8kd,maters77,4,Thu Jun 11 18:20:58 2015 UTC,hes in the 6-11 ranking and wont always steal you a game but hes still a good goaltender just not great.  ive beat him up a fair share enough on this sub but darling still is unproven as much as i enjoyed watching him play.
hawks,39g8kd,bud1316,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:32:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. That's my point put perfectly.
hawks,39g8kd,aeternitatisdaedalus,59,Thu Jun 11 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"He has 17 years playing professionally (first game in NHL wasn't until 02 though), an Olympic gold medal, a World Cup silver medal,a Calder Cup, and soon to be 3 Stanley Cups. Man's had a great career. I know he'll probably go to another team, but it would be nice to see him retire a Blackhawk."
hawks,39g8kd,dvaunr,13,Fri Jun 12 13:18:21 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point. He will be turning 34 this year. Maybe 2-3 more seasons at best? He still has some speed and scoring instincts. I'd love to see the Hawks sign him for couple year deal with the anticipation that he would retire at the end. The risk is though, if he starts slowing down then moving him down to Rockford or trading him would put a blemish on his career in Chicago."
hawks,39g8kd,ironlungz,8,Thu Jun 11 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"If I were him and Q said ""we're moving you down to Rockford because you just can't play at NHL level anymore"" I would honestly take that as a sign to retire right then and there."
hawks,39g8kd,Awken,4,Thu Jun 11 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"True, although some guys don't want to hang up the skates. I remember going to a wolves game and being utterly surprised to see Chelios out there. I agree with George Costanza, go out on a high note!"
hawks,39g8kd,ironlungz,2,Thu Jun 11 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say he'd be lucky to get 3 more years in. Like others have said, I highly doubt he'll be around next year. He takes up too much cap space and doesn't produce enough consistently to justify it. It's sad, but he's either going to be with another team or retiring after the next couple of games. But I'm more than willing to be wrong on that."
hawks,39g8kd,dvaunr,142,Fri Jun 12 02:14:29 2015 UTC,"This gets my upvote, I've always loved Sharpie, it will be sad to part ways with him, no doubt about it."
hawks,39g8kd,RareErr,35,Thu Jun 11 17:47:53 2015 UTC,It's easy to look at what little he's done this year and forget all that he's done for our franchise.  He was there when we were a dormant franchise and was a part of our revival and a huge part of our success.    He will always be welcome in Chicago.

hawks,39g8kd,TheBigSweat,3,Thu Jun 11 22:00:09 2015 UTC,I feel like a ton of this is mob mentality in the GDT's. Someone always gets crucified because they fucked up at a crucial time. But Sharpie is...Sharpie. :( It won't be the same without him next year if he goes.

hawks,39g8kd,eskEMO_iwl,23,Fri Jun 12 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"This is why I love this sub and you guys as fans. I love that this is recognized. Sharp should be recognized for his work and his achievement. No hes not worth the cap hit anymore, but that just because we suffer an embarrassment of riches and can't afford to keep them all. As hard as it is to remember sometimes, these guys are human and deserve to be recognized for what they have done for our whole organization. Carcillo was a huge example of this for me this year after viewing the players tibute video he did, as well as the intense sympathy I felt for Rozsy when he went down. I even feel it for Kimmo, considering how hard we have been on him while flyers fans have pledged grief at trading him.  Big upvote here, and respect for recognizing Sharp. I am all for moving him, but will always appreciate what he did for us while he was here."
hawks,39g8kd,king_of_pancakes,5,Fri Jun 12 17:50:13 2015 UTC,"I think he is definitely still worth his cap hit.  Just can't afford that cap hit anymore, but he's definitely worth it."
hawks,39g8kd,Heavenisatree,22,Thu Jun 11 16:46:25 2015 UTC,It will be a hard trade as we will always love Sharp BUT in reality now is the time to let him go.

hawks,39g8kd,HollowImage,11,Thu Jun 11 16:16:19 2015 UTC,Yep Life is still looking up for Hawks Nation.  Here is my projected starting day lineups for Hawks/Hogs:  Blackhawks:  Saad - Toews - Hossa  Versteeg - Teuvo - Kane  Desjardins - Krueger - Shaw  Panarin - Danault - Hartman  IceHogs:  Ross - Rasmussen - McNeil  Abbott - Broadhurst - Baun  Mashinter - Kero - Labrie  Carey - LeBlanc - Bass

hawks,39g8kd,HollowImage,7,Thu Jun 11 16:44:18 2015 UTC,Richards was just a 1 year contract in Chicago. I doubt he'll stay here.
hawks,39g8kd,EventualCyborg,7,Thu Jun 11 16:48:08 2015 UTC,"Just a 1 year contract, but didn't the Rangers buy him out?  I think he's getting like 20 million over the next 10 years from the Rangers.  That's motivation enough to settle for peanuts in a good hockey situation."
hawks,39g8kd,1point-21-jigowatz,2,Thu Jun 11 17:15:55 2015 UTC,"I just don't think they'll have the cash for him, remember now would be a great time to lockdown Teuvo longterm as well before he gets ungodly expensive"
hawks,39g8kd,ClintEastwood41,2,Thu Jun 11 18:47:02 2015 UTC,Richards is already here on the cheap. Gonna be hard to get him to take even less I think.
hawks,39g8kd,thorofasgard,3,Thu Jun 11 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"Panarin is getting top 6 minutes, I see Steeg gone.    I expect Saad and Krugs to be resigned before July 1st, and hoping DJ and Vermy somehow stay"
hawks,39g8kd,Vorrigan,5,Thu Jun 11 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"I don't see it, especially on a coach Q team.  Panarin will start out as a 3rd/4th liner until he proves himself."
hawks,39g8kd,ClintEastwood41,3,Thu Jun 11 17:40:17 2015 UTC,Probably right. Only sure thing is the kid will get NHL minutes next year. At least that's the desire and will of Stanbo.

I know he has a GW, but this guy has led the Yotes in goals the last 3 years ... I was expecting more Oh-fence from Vermi.  I'm sure it was a rough transition coming to a team with ALL the weapons we have.  Maybe a fresh season where he's here from the beginning will do wonders."
hawks,39g8kd,1point-21-jigowatz,2,Thu Jun 11 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say almost 100% for sure. Top in face offs, he can get s good offer somewhere."
hawks,39g8kd,Jake0oo0,2,Thu Jun 11 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, 100%.  He is just too expensive for the Hawks."
hawks,39g8kd,ClintEastwood41,0,Thu Jun 11 19:14:48 2015 UTC,Kruger is 50/50 to stay at best. He's gonna get an offer sheet the Hawks can't match. I'd be surprised if he'd take a bridge deal with 4 years 16 million or something like that on the table. Desjardins will probably get some good money somewhere else too. He's been fantastic for the Hawks this year.
hawks,39g8kd,faceshitter,3,Thu Jun 11 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think Desjardins is going to get any huge money offers, you gotta remember with the restricted FA period, if Bowman get's it done quick they won't have to worry about and offer sheets."
hawks,39g8kd,ClintEastwood41,2,Thu Jun 11 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"I think Desi has been my favorite of the pickups we made.  He's settled into that 4th line role nicely.  His been apart of some huge goals whether he was awarded a point or just created havoc on the forecheck.  We didn't get a chance to see it because he rolled in here just before playoff time, but he'll drop the gloves with just about anybody and can act as that semi enforcer with skill.  Car Bomb was an absolute train wreck this year with ALL the stupid penalties."
hawks,39g8kd,1point-21-jigowatz,3,Thu Jun 11 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"Why on earth would someone pay Marcus Kruger $4mil a year. I mean, he's an excellent 3C, but compare him to Frolik, who got 3.3 wtih much more offensive upside."
hawks,39g8kd,orionus,19,Thu Jun 11 18:58:05 2015 UTC,Loved Q reuniting the Sharp Hossa Toews lineup. Hopefully this gets Sharpy going. He's done a lot for this organization and it would be great if he could end on a high note.
hawks,39g8kd,gunners84,13,Thu Jun 11 21:22:32 2015 UTC,Seeing that 10-19-81 line made me so giddy. I didn't realize how much I had missed it.

hawks,39g8kd,HaveYouSeenMyTaco,13,Thu Jun 11 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"It will be sad to see him go.  But yeah, with the cap situation, its almost a certainty he's one of the ones to go."
hawks,39g8kd,materhern,5,Thu Jun 11 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, to be honest, I'll be upset if someone promising gets cut in order to retain Sharp. Yes, he's a sniper. A scorer. A risk-taker. But, his age and diminishing awareness of what to do with/without the puck when not in a shooting zone irks me to no end and... he's gotta go."
hawks,39g8kd,heypal121,33,Thu Jun 11 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"This. It really set in for me when he hit the post on the breakaway. I hope he scores a (the?) crucial goal in this series, he deserves it after all he's done."

But your point about him being the last holdover from the pre-Wonder Twins days is well made. His contributions to the team are an important note in team history, and he will not be forgotten.  Also, he did this last night, which warms my dadheart immeasurably :)"

Even though he didn’t get any in, he had some quality chances at goal. He was all over the place. I think Coach Q throwing him in with the same line that won in 2013 ignited his play. I predict he scores in game 5 or 6. MARK MY WORDS!"
hawks,39g8kd,the_rah_monster,13,Fri Jun 12 15:32:10 2015 UTC,Wore my Sharp jersey to the only time I've been to the UC (back in 2011). He's one of my favourite players and I'm sure no one will forget his contribution to the 2010 and 2013 Cup wins. It was nice to see him skate with the Top 6 again in Game 4.

There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said, but I love Sharpie and seeing him go with be the hardest departure since the last great #10 (one of my all-time favorites).  He was in Chicago during the Dark Ages and was a huge part of the Renaissance and I won't ever forget him.  I just hope he goes to a team I can root for.  Also, if we go on to win our 3rd cup with this team you can just go ahead and throw his number into the rafters, if it were up to me.  This actually goes for all seven guys that were here during our (hopefully) 3-cup run.  Barring catastrophe, 19, 88 and 2 are likely to be up there anyway, but if we do the unthinkable I say throw 4, 7, 10 and 81 up there too.  This won't happen, I know, but it would if it were up to me.  Furthermore, I do realize there is a certain #28 that should already be up there first."

hawks,39g8kd,Jake0oo0,3,Thu Jun 11 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I could probably see Kane being an alternate. I would have NEVER said that 3-4 years ago, but he has really matured since his earlier years. I'd much rather see Seabs or hossa first in line though."
hawks,39g8kd,orionus,3,Thu Jun 11 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"Seabrook is most likely, I imagine."
hawks,39g8kd,TheKevinShow,5,Thu Jun 11 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"If not Seabs, probably Kane."
hawks,39g8kd,Nightmare_Nikki,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:23:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's got to be Seabrook. The thing is that captain patches aren't given as a result of playing quality, it's for leadership and also they serve the purpose of communicating with the officials. So I absolutely think Seabrook should get it for that alone. If it was for playing talent, it would be given to Kaner, which I wouldn't complain about, he would be well-deserved to wear it and has earned the honor."
hawks,39g8kd,maters77,5,Thu Jun 11 17:03:35 2015 UTC,I wish there was a way to keep Sharp.  I don't think he wants to leave us.  If he would take a huge pay cut to stay where he loves to play then that would be wonderful.
hawks,39g8kd,Twelve2375,2,Fri Jun 12 12:13:43 2015 UTC,I don't think NHL players are able to renegotiate their contracts like the NFL and if I'm correct he's got a year or more left on his current so even if he wanted to stay I don't think anything could be done about it.
hawks,39g8kd,ssor21,2,Thu Jun 11 21:32:55 2015 UTC,I think he'll come up big for us again before it's all said and done. I'd love to see him leave on a high note.

I was thinking Toronto, Florida, or the Isles. Even Edmonton might be a nice fit if they get some better defense and a top notch goalie."
hawks,39g8kd,thanson1990,3,Thu Jun 11 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"Wherever the Hawks can get the biggest return.......but I do expect Montreal to be interested.  They could use a goal scoring winger, even though Sharpie may not be that anymore..."

Sharps a Canadian boy and might want to head there for his last few years. He can provide a lot of leadership and teaching to those teams and their young forwards.   There's also teams like buffalo, Florida, and the ducks that have cap out the wazoo, who also would like a seasoned vet for a leadership role."

He goes into corners and fights and battles and comes out with the puck as much as anyone. He has a rough, tough edge to his game, as well as being highly skilled. I hope he stays. But I know who must go in his stead. Tough choice... but not to me."

I'm still holding out hope that they'll find a way to keep him. At the very least I want him to sign a small contract with the Hawks for the last year or two of his career because he needs to retire as a Blackhawk.

On the other hand, as other's hinted at, sometimes the old players have to leave to make room for the new ones. With guys like TT, Panarin, Saad, and anyone else that may come up, we got a good future. And he'll at least go leaving a large mark on the city in a good way."

It'll be sad to see him go but my close friend is a rangers fan and he said they've been eyeing him so that'd be a good fit for sharpie.

hawks,39g8kd,Spagoo,2,Fri Jun 12 01:38:08 2015 UTC,"Guarantee it is Seabrook. He wears the A when someone is out, multiple articles show Hawks players saying that although Toews is the Captain, Seabs is the heart.  There's no doubt in my mind that Seabs gets it."
hawks,39g8kd,Twelve2375,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:44:02 2015 UTC,"Its really frustrating watching this scoring drought. I was surprised to hear he has 14 points - more than Saad's 10.  Who do you guys think is more valuable, disregarding age/potential and contract status favoring Saad?"
hawks,39g8kd,Spagoo,2,Sat Jun 13 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"Nothing against you but that's a ridiculous question. To ask a comparison with the limitation that we disregard all of Saads advantages and all of Sharp's weaknesses you're really asking a loaded question. To equalize it, you have to also have to disregard Sharp's experience. All things equal for a single season no cap run for the cup, I'd say it's damn near impossible to get the answer wrong. Both would be great. But this isn't a vacuum. Sharp's contract is bigger but he's got a ton more experience. Saad has a much cap friendly contract but is still young with his best years ahead of him."
hawks,39g8kd,short_handed_goal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm trying to freeze them in time where they both are now, next year is the year. Only pick one, I would take Saad but maybe I'm wrong.  Seems like Sharp isn't as physically threatening or capable. He's not having his way, getting scoring opportunities. He has a great shot and works well with the system. I think Saad provides more goal scoring and Sharp spaces well and makes plays. They can both be put to use. I don't want to rain on a Sharp appreciation thread but it revolves around him either being a lower priority player and/or a contract they can't handle. I'm wondering if they even try to make it work."
hawks,39g8kd,rmoviesok,-1,Fri Jun 12 01:34:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think their gonna move Sharp. The guy put up 78 points in 13'-14' season, and got hurt and has had a little bit of an off season this year.  I'm betting they will move Bickell and Crawford to clear 10 million in cap space, and let Sharpie retire as a hawk."
hawks,39g8kd,short_handed_goal,17,Fri Jun 12 02:04:57 2015 UTC,"They need to move Bickell because after re-signing he has been nothing but a waste of money so far. Crawford has been earning his paycheck in the playoffs, they can't get rid of him."
hawks,39g8kd,Panaran,3,Thu Jun 11 16:21:17 2015 UTC,Numbers show Crawford is average. The Hawks have plenty of guys in their system who are average or better goaltenders. He'll be moved.
hawks,39g8kd,short_handed_goal,5,Thu Jun 11 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"Average regular season stats, I'm ok with that.  His ""when push comes to shove"" play is where he earns his pay.  Down the stretch of the regular season, the Hawks as a team were pitiful, he kept them in the mix and he's the biggest reason why they weren't a wildcard team going into the playoffs.  He's also one of the main reasons they've made it this far in the playoffs.  He has a few poo-poo games here and there, but they don't beat the Ducks without him.  He comes to play in the playoffs and that's invaluable."
hawks,39g8kd,Panaran,2,Thu Jun 11 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"All true. Back to my point, though.  Darling could be that next guy, and there is only one way to find out."

He's a good player with a big hit who they can conceivably move for something in return. He won't be back unfortunately.

I know Toews and Kane are rarely together, and when they are they seem to have quite the chemistry, but Sharp and Kane do special things.

I sometimes forget the one-timer is a thing with this team."
hawks,39ix1t,Hard58Core,3,Fri Jun 12 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"That may be why they put Teravainen on his line as well (before Game 4). Rarely are there players with high level stick-handling that they can afford to hang onto the puck that few seconds longer in the offensive zone to find a seam that Sharp can exploit. Kaner and (to a lesser extent) Teuvo seem to have that.

I still think Shaw should skate on line 4, where he's been super productive with the 11-16-65. So does Q keep these lines going forward, because the ice-time for line 3 was pretty low from what I saw in game 4."

hawks,39ix1t,ScienceOwnsYourFace,6,Fri Jun 12 03:48:39 2015 UTC,"weird, sorry, here you go:   Hockey analytics show Patrick Sharp's scoring dropped as role changed  trick Sharp is known as a finisher. But this season, his struggles to score have led to speculation as to the cause, ranging from the mundane to the ridiculous.  Many have suggested Sharp, 33, is aging and just doesn't have ""it"" anymore. This explanation fails to hit the target because aging in the NHL usually leads to a gradual decline in production and performance over time, not the sudden, precipitous dive Sharp experienced this season.  So what it is? What is going on with Sharp?  chart  After poring over Sharp's numbers, the data would seem to indicate he has been affected adversely playing with a different line construction and some really bad luck. His shot-generation rate is as high as ever, but his shooting percentage is the lowest of his career.  Darryl Belfry, an NHL skills coach who counts Patrick Kane among his clients, explained that when Sharp was returning from injury, his timing was off, as is often the case with professional athletes. Being shuffled around different lines further hindered that timing.  In Wednesday night's 2-1 Game 4 victory over the Lightning that evened the Stanley Cup Final, Sharp was moved to a line with Jonathan Toews and Marian Hossa and got a couple of excellent scoring chances and an assist — but still no goals.  Sportsnet writer and shot-quality researcher Chris Boyle reviewed Sharp's play over the season and found that he was being forced to take shots from outside of the slot far more often than in the past.  Essentially, based on these statistical windows into Sharp's performance, the conclusion is that while he has been generating shots, his efforts to regain his timing and his ability to play the game that best fit his skill set were impeded at every turn this season.  Sharp will have new line mates next season as the Hawks likely won't be able to swallow his nearly $6 million per year contract.  Many hockey fans, when asked to think about Sharp's goals before this season, will remember his finding a soft spot in the defensive coverage and one-timing a pass into the net. While Sharp has scored plenty of goals off of breakaways, his real strengths emerge when the team is cycling the puck. He always has been skilled at reading the coverage and sneaking in behind a distracted defenseman on the backside of the play to put a one-timer past the goalie. This is no easy feat and a necessary skill to make a puck possession team like the Blackhawks successful.  This season has been a different story. Sharp's responsibilities on his many line combinations were changed from finisher duties to workhorse duties. Sharp has been tasked with finding a way to get the puck out of the defensive zone and into the offensive zone while his new linemates have learned the ropes of the Hawks' system. Those linemates, mostly Antoine Vermette and Teuvo Teravainen, both joined the team as full-time additions late in the season. Both obviously are skilled, particularly the unbelievably crafty Teravainen, but it takes time to find a rhythm together.  When people think of Sharp this season, they most often will picture him trying to carry the puck into the zone or chipping it behind the defense and then getting a shot from outside of the faceoff dot. Working off of the carry never has been the most effective part of Sharp's game, so it is easy to see why his timing has not found its way back yet.  With more time to find their cycle game, this line could allow Sharp to get back to a finisher role; however, there likely isn't enough time left for that to happen this season."
hawks,39ix1t,QEDomelets,4,Fri Jun 12 04:14:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks.   I kind of figured this was why. Bad luck, bad timing, and being more of a workhorse now opposed to just ""dropping off"" because I know that doesn't explain it."

But here’s the thing: I’ve asked a few people in the hockey world about Hossa, and whenever I do, their eyes light up. They gush about him. The level of respect for his game may be as high as any active player I can think of.   Time after time, on (admittedly) biased home broadcasts or narrative-fueled gushing national broadcasts, you hear ""Watch Hossa do this little nuanced defensive thing"" or ""If you want to be a good all-around hockey player, learn how Hossa does this other thing."" If, as McIndoe suggests, this type of respect for his game is prevalent all around in the hockey world, I see him getting in."

I remember in Game 3 he straight up dangled someone so much so that I thought it was Kane. Then in Game 4 prior to the goal by Toews he creates a turnover then goes full afterburner to get it back, does so, and 30 seconds later Chelsea Dagger is playing. His hard work and effort is inspiring to say the least."

hawks,39dz0b,Dynamixx,15,Thu Jun 11 03:30:45 2015 UTC,The way he was holding himself in a few shots I actually think he might have a hernia. Technically that is an intestinal issue.

""damnit roszival"" is like my favorite thing to say, wether hes even dressed or not. but hes not a terrible player, and as much as i rage about him, hes was doing well comparitively to cumiskey or tvr or timmonen (not to detract from how well timmonen has done tonight) ya know?"

Was he even watching"" when I only see the games, and even then, only what is broadcast. Such is the life of any sports fan, I know, but I am humbled. Thinking back, you gotta wonder if he knew how much a toll the ducks were on us and he benched those guys knowing they would be needed for this series (which they have been)? Its like he thinks 4 games ahead, and I challenge that regularly.   And I was right there with you for Roszy. He was the absolute fucking worst player I would do anything to get back LOL!

They sent a clear signal at the players for what isn't allowed and they called every play that crossed the line very consistently.  I'm not saying I'm a fan of that kind of strict reffing (I'd want zero tolerance for all the interference penalties and stick penalties) but at least they were consistent.  But then they fucked that up and didn't keep the same rules they brought to the first, which is the worst crime a referee can do. Inconsistent reffing is fucking bullshit."

I switched into my Blackhawks jersey as soon as the WWC game was over. Today, I had my Blackhawks jersey on from the start because the WNT wasn't playing.  Ergo, I take full responsibility for the game 3 loss and apologize.  Also, can we just hurry up and win this in six? My mustache is starting to annoy the shit out of me but I can't trim it."

hawks,39eqsg,Hard58Core,5,Thu Jun 11 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"The win is great, and keeps us in this for now, but I really don't understand why nobody is talking about how not-great the hawks played in their own zone. I mean, some absolutely abysmal plays that honestly should have led to goals for them(thankfully, the odds weren't with them).  I mean, holy shit can we not keep hanging out in our zone? Letting their forecheck hold us down when we should have never been in our zone to begin with? It's insane, and I worry that it's unsustainable play. I need to look at numbers (I'm way too busy preparing for a professional exam right this moment) but I felt like we played 80% of the game in our own end."
hawks,39eqsg,ScienceOwnsYourFace,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:54:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Tampa has a young buck in at goalie. Gotta take advantage"

hawks,39eqsg,kremdelakrem,39,Thu Jun 11 06:37:52 2015 UTC,Don't think Crow will get it seeing what happened in the 1st round. Keith for me if we get up.
hawks,39eqsg,king_of_pancakes,17,Thu Jun 11 08:14:21 2015 UTC,"against the preds, plus he has let in some super soft goals this series even. He was incredible last night, for sure. We owe him last nights win, but Duncan Keith has kept us in every game, stolen games for us, saved goals even that got past Crawford, set up incredible plays, and doing it all with the most minutes on our team. There is absolutely no way he doesn't get Conn Smthye in my opinion. He has been our best player by a massive margin."
hawks,39eqsg,brianskuhar,2,Thu Jun 11 14:02:08 2015 UTC,"He even saved Crawford on that stuff attempt on Wednesday.  Crawford was about 6 inches off the post when the puck got there, but Keith dropped his stick right against it to keep it out."
hawks,39eqsg,eskEMO_iwl,2,Fri Jun 12 14:57:29 2015 UTC,I flipped when I saw that! No one else I was watching with saw it and I was flipping my shit about how good Keith is!
hawks,39eqsg,kremdelakrem,3,Fri Jun 12 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"That's true, if not him Keith for sure for the sake of consistency.  But you gotta say crow is winning these ass clenching games for us deep in these playoffs. I love this team."

hawks,39eqsg,iApple103003,11,Thu Jun 11 20:05:41 2015 UTC,Good point. The Hawks gotta find a way to beat Tampas insane forecheck. I think that is what caused so many turnovers; either that or our consistency to attempt cross-ice passes
hawks,39eqsg,TheFuckingEagles,6,Thu Jun 11 06:44:33 2015 UTC,"Their forecheck was incredible, active sticks throughout the game. We need to continue to work on our offensive zone entries and eliminate the sloppy passes. And if Crow can replicate this performance than he we are in good hands."
hawks,39eqsg,cubicle_jockey,3,Thu Jun 11 12:14:47 2015 UTC,"they're kicking the shit out of Oduya. Kind of ridiculous. Killorn's fucking penalty on Timmonen was bullshit. they're trying to beat them into submission. You can see the hawks are starting to get tired. so glad they got out of there yesterday with a W, they really need a couple days off."

hawks,39eqsg,the_rah_monster,15,Thu Jun 11 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, early Recap Thread.  I have to admit I was kinda worried about Kimmo playing tonight seeing as how Tampa's speed is one of it's great strengths but I thought he held himself well today.  This was a great win but it could've gone either way. But for the wood on Seabrook's stick this series could be 3-1 heading to Tampa. Hawks need to come out hungry for Game 5!"
hawks,39eqsg,mongoos3,12,Thu Jun 11 06:27:10 2015 UTC,And he pinged the cross bar with what could have been the game-winner. So close.
hawks,39eqsg,EventualCyborg,17,Thu Jun 11 13:11:25 2015 UTC,Kimmo really was the right call against this Tampa team.  Let's all praise Hossa for the great insight of Coach Q.
hawks,39eqsg,taintedblu,2,Thu Jun 11 12:31:48 2015 UTC,"His holiness Q truly is a saintly bishop of our savior, Hossa.  Check out this sweet video of Q leading the other disciples of Hossa in joyous prayer after service! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjLEeeRxuFI&app=desktop"

hawks,39eqsg,badseedjr,8,Thu Jun 11 12:40:48 2015 UTC,"With as much flack as he's gotten, a goal from him really would have been something special. He may be old and slow, but dude's got heart."
hawks,39eqsg,ViagraAndSweatpants,2,Thu Jun 11 13:55:50 2015 UTC,"With the 2 missed open nets in game 3 and the 4 freaking posts last night, It could also be 3-1 the other way very easily.  It's an insanely close series."
hawks,39eqsg,jazzcigarettes,14,Thu Jun 11 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"Got to give credit to Tampa.  Their defensive system is causing havoc.  Crazy how well they take away the boards for the D zone exits.  I feel like the Hawks should get be getting more odd man rushes if they can complete some mid-ice stretch passes, but those are risky if not executed to perfection.    I'd like to see Sharp stay with Toews/Hossa.  That was the best he's looked in a month.  Maybe 20-91-88, 23-80-86, 65-16-11  Inexcusable to limit Tuevo's ice time when the Hawks need some creativity and scoring."
hawks,39eqsg,mazerrackham,3,Thu Jun 11 13:37:06 2015 UTC,I really liked seeing sharpie out there with toews and hoss and I have a feeling saad with kane is gonna cause some mayhem. We talked when Q split toews and kane up about making Tampa choose who they defend and I think putting saad with kane and Richie instead of Bickell or steeg makes that choice much more difficult.
hawks,39eqsg,cubicle_jockey,3,Thu Jun 11 14:00:44 2015 UTC,"The Hawks have been trying to counter their forecheck by having 2 forwards circling the zone for pressure release, but then they wind up having to either pass to the lone remaining forward in the NZ who now has to go against 2 defenders (how many times have you seen our forwards button-hook high in the offensive zone because they were alone and outnumbered), or they need to skate it out of the defensive zone and Tampa can collapse at the blue line and create havoc.   They need to adjust their breakouts so when they do have a forward in the d-zone get a pass they either have enough speed to immediately fly the zone past the 3 TB forecheckers, or they have the other forwards available with enough speed to get through the neutral zone. Oh, and this all assumes that the passes are tape-to-tape. Hard to practice and perfect that shit this late in the playoffs, but they have done it before.   Once they crack the TB defensive system you'll see Tampa starting to back off and that will give the Hawks room to exercise their normal breakouts and enter the TB zone with speed and numbers."
hawks,39eqsg,brianskuhar,2,Thu Jun 11 16:55:56 2015 UTC,And its funny because you can see them analyzing it when they're holding the puck behind the net. They'll get it. Their collective hockey intelligence is the best.
hawks,39eqsg,hchux,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah how many times have you seen Keith looking over Crawford's shoulders for 5 seconds before making a move?  He's going ""Now wtf is this?  This isn't what happened before..."""
hawks,39eqsg,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,2,Fri Jun 12 15:11:23 2015 UTC,This is exactly it.  Their forecheck is really good and they are protecting the boards on outlet passes.  Both if these are our main issues causing us all sorts of fits.  I really hope we can solve this soon.
hawks,39eqsg,iApple103003,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:59:20 2015 UTC,Especially considering he was huge in the game 1 win
hawks,39eqsg,mazerrackham,13,Thu Jun 11 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"The last few minutes of the game really scared me. The Hawks looked like they simply parked the bus on Tampa once Saad scored, and it looked like they were playing not to lose, instead of to win. Sure it worked this time, but they were just a few inches away from tying the game up (Thanks to Seabrook and his clutch stick). I just don't want several heart attacks in such a short period of time. But a wins a win. Go Hawks!"
hawks,39eqsg,Neutral_Milk_Brotel,11,Thu Jun 11 06:43:05 2015 UTC,"A stat I like from Second City Hockey:  Since 2009, the Hawks are 9-0 in the playoffs when a series is tied 2-2, and are 18-1 in those games."
hawks,39eqsg,mongoos3,3,Thu Jun 11 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"And I was present at the only one they lost, lol"
hawks,39eqsg,Stef41,11,Fri Jun 12 10:25:02 2015 UTC,If this team can win on the back of that performance. Imagine what they would do if things actually started to click.
hawks,39eqsg,smackfrog,9,Thu Jun 11 13:05:48 2015 UTC,That's what's so maddening about it to me. Tampa is playing pretty well but I'd be interested to see what a game would look like if the Hawks found that extra gear we know and love.
hawks,39eqsg,king_of_pancakes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:11:25 2015 UTC,The extra gear isn't even required. 3rd gear would be enough. The boys are up and down in first gear only...never able to maintain any type of pressure or flow. Tampa is always a half step ahead and we're scrambling to catch up
hawks,39eqsg,goalieman392,2,Thu Jun 11 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"I really don't want to take anything away from Tampa, meaning no disrespect with the following, but they look terrible to me. The only reason they aren't winning is because we look a bit worse. They are a far easier team to beat than the Ducks, or even the Predators. We are looking incredible to get chances, then squandering those chances on sloppy play. If the Hawks return to form, this is over in 6, though truthfully, I think if we had come the way we usually do, this series would have been over in 5.   I don't feel they are beating us, I just feel like we are losing.   To clarify though, its not that I think they are bad, but I think they aren't playing to their potential either. Bishop hurt, Cooper making some poor line choices, too much faith in TJ, not enough in Stamkos, and on the reverse, Stamkos choking when he does get chances. They aren't playing with depth, but it isn't due to fatigue. Its just straight up inexperience and lack of confidence in all aspects of their game.   Just my $.02"
hawks,39eqsg,king_of_pancakes,13,Thu Jun 11 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, two good teams can make each other look terrible. We are two evenly matched speedy teams and I think in some aspects we cancel each other out nicely. With that being said, fuck tampa, go hawks!"
hawks,39eqsg,goalieman392,3,Thu Jun 11 14:18:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that's true. It has just seemed to me as a pretty uneducated fan that tampa is not smothering or crushing us the ways that our previous opponents had."
hawks,39eqsg,king_of_pancakes,8,Thu Jun 11 14:33:54 2015 UTC,Their forecheck is absolutely smothering and it was hard for us to even gain the zone at times.
hawks,39eqsg,TIEtemp1138,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"I saw that, and while many times I felt it was pressure and active sticks in passing lanes, I felt many times it was careless play and less accurate passing by the hawks. Again, I don't mean disrespect to tampa and don't hold myself as an authority, kit just seemed that way to me. It could also be that I see the hawks with rose colored glasses"
hawks,39eqsg,king_of_pancakes,2,Thu Jun 11 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"This!!!! I think you are spot on here. It seemed like every one our takeaways was due to a lazy or weak pass while trying to cut through Tampa's forecheck. Heck even Seabrook gave them a few chances because he was watching the puck go by instead of chasing it. It was like a nightmare watching us weave through a few Lightning forecheckers just to screw up a leading pass into the goal.  Call it a lack of focus, call it tired, but we were daydreaming for the first 2 periods coming through the neutral zone."
hawks,39eqsg,leakfrei,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you see where I'm coming from. I think they killed a few chances with some great stickwork and interruptions to the passing lanes but it just seems that our boys aren't reading their forecheck, the situations, nor are they adapting the way they have shown they can. I have every confidence that they will, but right now we look like our road here took a lot out of us."
hawks,39eqsg,daslobo,2,Thu Jun 11 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"I have never seen a team get as many sticks in the way as Tampa has been able to.  It is so, SO frequent that I have written some of it off to luck... Then  - towards the end of the game - We started seeing the Hawks be more disruptive in that way..and Seabrook's stick at the end to avoid the empty net Tie goal was a glimmer of hope to me that the tide was turning in that regard.     All this goes to your premise.  The team with the most goals wins! No points for style.  Yesterday - the hawks were finding their way for much of the game (running into each other, passes in feet, passes that missed completely or resulted in ugly turnovers) and still found a way to win.  Most goals win!  ZERO points for style and grace.  Have fun - Hawks in 6!!!"
hawks,39eqsg,mikeypat15,2,Thu Jun 11 21:56:40 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  The Hawks could/should have at least 5 more goals in this series.  It's just strange to see them miss those opportunities so often.  Those used to be sure thing goals.  They have half a roster full of finishers who aren't finishing.  I don't see that lasting for an entire series.
hawks,39eqsg,amanaboutahorse,9,Thu Jun 11 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"Before the Minnesota series I mentioned the Hawks needed to find their 5th gear, and quickly.  They found it, but now they need to find their 6th and put it into overdrive, and it needed to be done yesterday.    For most of us on this subreddit it doesn't need to be said, for many of Hawks fans though, Tampa Bay is a Stanley Cup caliber team, just because you haven't heard a lot about them doesn't make them a subpar hockey organization.  I've said it to a lot of people over the last couple days, the Hawks are looking at a younger version of themselves in the mirror. A 2010 version, with players having their coming out parties, and an ability to always seem to win games.    The Hawks need to look deep into that mirror and remember what made them a Championship caliber team over the last 6 seasons. Puck possession, minimal turnovers/giveaways, solid D from both D and forwards, production from the core, and goal scoring.  The Hawks have this in them, but it needs to happen now, or Tampa Bay is never going to take their foot off the gas."

hawks,39eqsg,amanaboutahorse,6,Thu Jun 11 16:59:12 2015 UTC,"Those last minutes had me gripping the sofa on each puck near the goal, willing it to bounce to us for a clearance. We came out winners in a game we didn't have great possession. Sharp had some moments playing with Toews. Kane is shooting potatoes at the moment, but Showtime isn't but a slick shot away.

Look at it.  Crawford lost track of the puck that was right in front of him for the only goal against us.    We had 3 or 4 pucks hit the post that really should have gone in.  Last night could very easily have been 4 or 5  to 1 instead of 2-1.  I think thats a good sign for us.  I really want to win this in Chicago and not on the road.  We'd have to have 3 straight wins, but if we keep playing like this, we can do it."

hawks,39dtjv,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:06:59 2015 UTC,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy:       Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a form of encephalopathy that is a progressive degenerative disease, which can currently only be definitively diagnosed postmortem, in individuals with a history of multiple concussions and other forms of head injury. In March 2014, researchers announced the discovery of an exosome particle created by the brain which has been shown to contain trace proteins indicating the presence of the disease,  however, a test is not yet available. The disease was previously called dementia pugilistica (DP), i.e. ""punch-drunk"", as it was initially found in those with a history of boxing. CTE has been most commonly found in professional athletes participating in American football, ice hockey, professional wrestling and other contact sports who have experienced repetitive brain trauma. It has also been found in soldiers exposed to a blast or a concussive injury,  in both cases resulting in characteristic degeneration of brain tissue and the accumulation of tau protein. Individuals with CTE may show symptoms of dementia, such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression, which generally appear years or many decades after the trauma.

He's always been a positive person despite knowing that the league wants to absolve itself from players similar to himself. When he was let go (by the Rangers?) I was hoping someone would give him a job because he just has this ""every-man"" quality to his personality. Although I don't know if that qualifies him to continue being an NHL player.   Then the Hawks brought him back and my friends would always here me saying,""...come on Danny. Let's get a good shift!"" And more times than not he would fight hard on the boards and put a few guys on their asses. Is it weird that I care just as much for Danny as I do Toews or Kane? I hope he pulls through despite his hard year and comes back punching sunshine and checking rainbows soon. If not hockey then I hope his future is filled with the happiness that a wife and child can bring. To Danny Carcillo! Cheers!"

He's done that multiple times just in his short stints here alone, the rest of his career is full of it as well. I can't believe people are still giving him the benefit of the doubt.

No effort was made to find out if Roy's views are in any way representative of Natives as a whole.  Or even as a particular group.  We are a lot of diverse people, and I'm sure I can find a single Native somewhere with any number of opinions.  Doesn't make that person representative of all of us.

Anyone who currently lives in Madison or to the West of it (up to the Mississippi) lives where his band of Sauk people made their last attempt to flee the American onslaught. Near present-day Sauk City, he was able to hold off the much more powerful and well-equipped American Army long enough to secure safe passage for most Sauk civilians across the very fast-flowing and wide Wisconsin River in rafts. He famously ordered his men to stand their ground and ""never yield it to the enemy"" despite the seemingly hopeless situation. Of course, like most of these wars, it ended with defeat, surrender and massacre, but Black Hawk himself survived as a prisoner. The reason so much shit (especially here in Wisconsin) is named after him is because he's so goddamn well respected.  Here's a little Wikipedia article about the battle"

hawks,39gwoc,-TheToad-,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"There is zero chance the logo or name changes, other than adding the space between black and hawk as a throwback to the early days."
hawks,39gwoc,RustyDarkstar76,0,Thu Jun 11 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time developing an opinion here, on one hand, the Hawks cherish and respect the image of chief Blackhawk and show out reach in the Native American community, and it is well different than the Redskins name and the Indians old logo. On the other hand, we really don't know how chief Blackhawk wanted to be represented and maybe he wouldn't agree with this? I agree with both sides and maybe it should be changed but again it's very different than the other cases that are going around. Is there a case for the Florida State Seminoles to change their logo, I know college football greatly televises and choreographs entrances that can be seen as racist to some."
hawks,39gwoc,Cartortus,-13,Fri Jun 12 05:36:06 2015 UTC,"The logo has always been my least favorite part about being a Hawks fan. I love the name, I love their colors, but the Indian head has always put me off slightly. Obviously not that much, as I own two shirts and a jersey with it, but I really wouldn't be that upset if they ditched it.  It's not as bad as the Redskins, but it's still pretty fucked up considering we killed an entire race of people and now use a cartoon version of them as a sports logo.   Keep the name, change the logo. It will still be represented in the 5 (6?) banners in the rafters. That should be enough."
hawks,39gwoc,wabray17,6,Thu Jun 11 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"but it's still pretty fucked up considering we killed an entire race of people and now use a cartoon version of them as a sports logo.   That's the thing it's not a cartoon logo.  And we didn't kill them off we killed some, they killed some white men too and moved the others out west.  As is how war goes.  If anything the logo is a testement to Chief Blackhawk for being such a good opponent to the USA, there's a reason why the original owners army squad was named after the guy.  Chief Blackhawk was a fighter a respected opponent."
hawks,39gwoc,RustyDarkstar76,3,Thu Jun 11 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"Except Black Hawk wasn't a chief, so that undermines some of that."
hawks,39gwoc,proximacentauri77,2,Thu Jun 11 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"It's not a cartoon in the way that the Cleveland Indians logo is a cartoon, that's true. I can understand that the name comes from a place of respect, but how many people know that history?   What is it about the logo that would make changing it that big a deal? The history with the team? Your own personal memories of it? I'm actually curious, not trying to start a flame war..."
hawks,39gwoc,wabray17,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"but how many people know that history?   That's how we learn history, or at least I did.  I asked my mom she told me & gave me books on it.  There's no need to change the logo, there's nothing offensive about it.  It's just a generic face that looks cool."
hawks,39gwoc,RustyDarkstar76,2,Thu Jun 11 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"Much like the Minnesota Vikings logo. The Vikings logo is a WHITE guy with blonde hair & blue eyes,  wearing a cultural symbol on his head. With no sign of caricature or derogatory intent.  Is that racist? Is it disrespectful to Scandinavians or the descendents of Vikings? I think the Blackhawks and the large majority of their fans are respectful and the fact that the team uses the name of a historically significant person rather than a racially charged word like Redskins should be enough to let them continue to use this name."
hawks,39gwoc,jeepster5802,0,Thu Jun 11 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"Except, many more Native Americans died. Basically turning into a genocide. It would be like a German hockey team having a jewish logo of some sort. Now that would obviously cause a bad taste in a person's mouth. Is it not the same?"
hawks,39gwoc,JoeBro2495,0,Thu Jun 11 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"That's way, way different.   The what the Germans did was a systematic elimination of a people, we fought a war against a people.  Totally different.  ""Basically turning into a genocide"" is not a genocide on the scale of Nazi Germany, just 'cuz lots died.  Technically one can call it a genocide however the intent of the word isn't on par.  Otherwise using the deffinition one can say the Indians commited a genocide against the white man too, or a war....."
hawks,39gwoc,RustyDarkstar76,0,Thu Jun 11 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"You can't hold Nazi Germany as the only example of genocide. That's like saying some bombs aren't that bad because they're not nukes. They still hurt/kill.  Whites still drove Native Americans from their lands in brutal ways, in case the Trail of Tears escaped your radar. This was far after fair means of warfare was done. They were still treated like objects, not people. The goal was to eliminate the undesirable, or if you watch Pocahontas then ""kill the savages"". This is also what Nazism taught/teaches.  I'd be okay with using Tommy Hawk as a mascot, matches the colloquial nickname better anyways."
hawks,39gwoc,proximacentauri77,0,Thu Jun 11 19:57:46 2015 UTC,"You can't hold Nazi Germany as the only example of genocide   I didn't, the definition of genocide would be any form of war.  What I'm saying is that the two are way different, the comparison to the Nazis is nothing more than attempt to out shock someone, when ever someone wants to make a point they go to the Nazi comparisons.  Beacuse they are the extreme case in modern history.  What the Nazis did to the Jews was torture and a systematic attempt to eliminate a entire race of people, there was no war between the Jews and Nazis.  There was a war between the Indians and the Americans.  The two are not even close, the Trail of Tears is nothing like a internment camp.  ""kill the savages"" is nothing like gas chambers."
hawks,39gwoc,RustyDarkstar76,4,Thu Jun 11 20:32:40 2015 UTC,It's not that we're using them as a logo to shame them though. Think of the Patriots or the 49ers. Patriots and 49ers are both very big pieces of American history. Professional sports teams adopt mascots to pay respect not to shame.
hawks,39gwoc,wabray17,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think it's used to shame them. But that doesn't mean it isn't fucked up. Patriots and 49ers are parts of our history that we're proud of. It would be hard to find someone who is proud of mass genocide.   That's the whole thing, really. It doesn't matter how we feel about using the logo - none of us are Sauk descendants (that I know of)."
hawks,39gwoc,RustyDarkstar76,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"It would be hard to find someone who is proud of mass genocide.   Although technically a ""mass genocide"" it was a war.  The use of ""genocide"" can apply to both the withes and the Indians as it was war.    Your trying to use genocide here as trigger word for your objections to a war and it really doesn't fit the context of what happened."

hawks,39gi5x,Fitzelli,12,Thu Jun 11 15:48:52 2015 UTC,"Basically trust,  the rookies are inexperienced and Timmo is slow against a fast Lightning team"
hawks,39gi5x,Vorrigan,10,Thu Jun 11 15:50:22 2015 UTC,"Our top 4 have been playing together for a while and are our main workhorses.  We had a 5th with Michael Roszival but he broke his ankle in game 4 vs MN.   Behind them you have Kimmo, Rundblad, and Cumiskey.  VanRyeimsdyk was out with injury for months basically.  Kimmo has had a rough playoffs, getting burned on several occasions.  Rundblad had been the primary 6th guy but he has been average in the regular season and had poor decision issues in the post season. So Q tried out Cumiskey, again, little post season experience, has left his assignments open on several occasions.  Basically him and Rundblad have been put in just to eat a few minutes to keep the top guys as fresh as we can hope.  TVR came back from injury this round, so with Cumisky and Rundblad not always making the smart plays, and Kimmo just being slower than TB, Q tried TVR out.  He's been better (imo) than both Cumiskey and Rundblad but not great either.    So basically we have 4 guys, all with issues that you need to shelter, and even more so in the SCF, so for the few minutes that any of them are on the ice you usually see them paired up with Keith or somebody to help cover for them.    In terms of physically tolling, I know the media loves to talk about this but it doesn't seem to have phased them and to be honest, that is how they've been playing most of the season already (a bit more with Rozi out) but this isn't a huge change for us so I think thats just a talking point but it means little."
hawks,39gi5x,hchux,5,Thu Jun 11 16:04:59 2015 UTC,The third pairing since Roszy went down has mostly been a stream of turnovers and goals going the other way.  They keep the third pairing split so the other guy in the tandem can hopefully pick up the slack so it isnt catastrophic.  As for taking its toll..  The Hawks top 4 dont look any more tired than anyone else who just played 8 months of hockey let alone after making deep runs 3 years in a row.
hawks,39gi5x,MidgetLovingMaxx,6,Thu Jun 11 15:59:22 2015 UTC,"Basically the Timonen you remember losing is not the Timonen we got.  The months of being sidelined and his age have made him a lot slower, and the opposing teams almost always target him against the boards.  Even the Lightning who don't really hit are clobbering him.    He's still really smart within his own zone though, and he's got the same heart he's always had.  I thought he was actually pretty good last night as well."

hawks,39aihd,SamPayton,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:54:36 2015 UTC,"I hate all the crawford hate.  People constantly blame him and it's created a rivalry with my girlfriend and i. Granted she is right when he is being inconsistent, but some goals are luck, some are the D's fault. Like the TB goal with confusion behind the net,  he only had limited awareness and unless someone was telling him where the puck was,  which obviously didn't happen because nobody knew,  he sees all 3 hawks and 2 bolts skating to his right, that's where he's going,  unaware of the guy in front.  Only so much to do in a 5 on him."
hawks,39aihd,loaferbro,6,Thu Jun 11 07:32:45 2015 UTC,So my humble opinion... You can't say we weren't the better team... The score board says we were and at the end of the game that's the only thing that matters. Were mistakes made... absolutely but in the end we are up 1 and tied up the series. So yes we ARE the best team tonight!
hawks,39aihd,bitchinbasic,7,Thu Jun 11 02:53:47 2015 UTC,Yea but that third period was the best we've seen the Hawks play since the Anaheim series. Hope is restored.

hawks,39aihd,squirrelwatch,2,Thu Jun 11 02:48:49 2015 UTC,Down vote me all you want but the Lightning have been the better team in every game this series. This was not a good game at all for the Hawks.
hawks,39aihd,meatyfingers,3,Thu Jun 11 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you are getting down voted when you are giving an honest critique of our team. I agree, especially tonight. Tampa was all over the place. We have to get our shit together"

hawks,39exkf,_Hamburger_,12,Thu Jun 11 07:13:52 2015 UTC,I think the time off did him well.  He was solid last night. Wished he would have scored that one off the pipe.  I saw a bad stretch pass that went for icing... Other than that he was not noticed... So no news is good news in a situation like that.
hawks,39exkf,leakfrei,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:22:48 2015 UTC,That stretch pass barely missed though. Would've been a great play if he would've just put a bit less on it. Possible goal.
hawks,39exkf,OTMuttButt,5,Thu Jun 11 23:21:26 2015 UTC,WinItForKimmo2015
hawks,39exkf,BeerInTheBabySeat,6,Thu Jun 11 13:27:27 2015 UTC,I wanted Kimmo to get that slap shot in so bad.  I would have laughed so hard.  I think the bench would have erupted and body surfed him for a good minute just for the hell of it.  Everyone on our team knows what Kimmo is capable of at 100%.
hawks,39exkf,BakaNonGrata,4,Thu Jun 11 14:52:47 2015 UTC,I think he looked fine. Hes more suited to play against tampa rather than anaheims physical presence.
hawks,39exkf,Weesc0,2,Thu Jun 11 12:43:57 2015 UTC,Besides the penalty and the icing I didn't think he played poorly. Maybe Q gives him another chance on Saturday.
hawks,39exkf,OCity,3,Thu Jun 11 13:21:04 2015 UTC,His penalty was fine considering he got us a power play right after that. Would have loved if he had scored.
hawks,39exkf,scrivenerserror,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:19:23 2015 UTC,"He was okay. He nearly scored the GWG, but it went off the post."
hawks,39exkf,PrisonedMuffin,-4,Thu Jun 11 15:18:40 2015 UTC,Better suited to have d-men in Cumiskey or Rundblad who can skate out there. Instincts don't really count for shit if you can't skate at the NHL level anymore. Which unfortunately he just can't. He's done.  He can be the smartest guy on the ice but it won't make much a difference if he can't keep up with the play.
hawks,39exkf,jerry200890,4,Thu Jun 11 10:05:02 2015 UTC,Explain game 3 and cumiskey trying to stick lift rather than lay down or actually stop the puck from going in the net. That's where some experience and hockey senses come into play that's why kimmo is out there
hawks,39exkf,Zutx,0,Thu Jun 11 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"Neither of those players are without their flaws or are even good. But they both can skate and that's something Kimmo can't do. Once you've lost that ability, you're done  at the NHL level. Just finished. It makes you even more of a liability in EVERY situation, no matter how smart you might be. Especially against a fast team like Tampa."
hawks,39exkf,jerry200890,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:11:48 2015 UTC,I agree on the speed but I'd rather have someone who can stop a great offensive chance than a fast skater. I do like cumiskey not much of rundblad but they just need some more regular season experience. I know kimmo can't skate that fast but you've got him paired with someone who has some speed and suddenly not a terrible line. He looked decent last night and nearly scored so just roll with that and keep in mind this is his last year so you won't have to worry about him later.
hawks,39exkf,Zutx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:36:21 2015 UTC,"It's no good having the ability to stop a ""great offensive chance"" when you can't catch up to the play most times. Rundblad/Cumiskey aren't much better options but they are better options. Dress your best team. Dressing a guy just because it'll be his last few games but is more of a detriment to the team than others in the Stanley Cup Final is terrible, terrible logic. Q made that mistake last year with Versteeg and Bollig and Handzus in the WCF.  Just dress the best team you can, everything is on the line."
hawks,39exkf,jerry200890,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"I understand but do you not see how cumiskey and rundblad are afraid to touch the damn puck? They either are afraid or take a stupid fancy chance that makes a turnover. Just not smart enough plays to keep on the ice. Look at jvr he's fast and good too but he doesn't get played much cause of his laziness last night. If you think the only problem with this team is the 3rd d line then you are sorely mistaken. Q will most likely play kimmo again and hey if it blows up then oh well but as of now, he's the better option in Q's eyes."
hawks,39exkf,Zutx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"...Where am I saying that's the only problem with the team? Christ. Q has been wrong in this EXACT way before. Same exact type situation, it wasn't that long ago dude."
hawks,39exkf,jerry200890,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:58:41 2015 UTC,I know but look how we turned out... And I'm not saying you are but your main complaint is kimmo. He's not the sole reason this team is playing without a spark. He's a good defenseman and he's gonna play weather you like it or not.
hawks,39exkf,Zutx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"Look how we turned out? That had nothing to do with bringing in Kimmo. Look, whoever they dress as the 5th and 6th d-men at this point aren't going to be too good. All I ask is they dress the best available personnel for that. And Kimmo isn't that, especially against a team like Tampa."
hawks,39exkf,jerry200890,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:13:39 2015 UTC,Look how we turned out... Coming back to the Stanley cup finals for the third time in six years. He is the better choice. Q would rather take a smart player than a young gun who doesn't play with his brain. Plain and simple as that
hawks,39exkf,Zutx,0,Thu Jun 11 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"He did just fine.  He is good enough at positioning to not get burned.  He's not going to get you good pinches in the offensive zone, but he's only out there for 5 minutes, so that doesn't really matter.  I wanted that clapper to go in for him though."
hawks,39exkf,badseedjr,0,Thu Jun 11 14:01:31 2015 UTC,He takes that one same penalty every game he plays in. You think he would learn by now?
hawks,39exkf,iBears,2,Thu Jun 11 18:16:01 2015 UTC,That garbage penalty that made no sense to call?

hawks,396xvw,mongoos3,15,Tue Jun 9 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"I understand that thinking but people need to understand this is not the NBA. NHL playoffs are such a different beast. It's very streaky and in order to win the cup you more than likely have to come back from being down 3-1. Just look at us against DET in 2013, and the LA Kings were down 3-1 in not one but TWO playoff series last year. I think 2012 was the only year a team didn't come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the Cup in the last 5 years."

There will be a solid amount that JUST started following the Hawks and will maybe from here on out. Labeling them as ""no pride"" is just kind of stupid. People have emotions and get angry. Saying a team sucks is how they vent i guess. I know i've heard my brother say ""fuck the hawks etc"" but that was just his crazy anger. He's just as much of a diehard as me. That'd be like me labeling you dick who labels from one comment. Pretty irrational right? yeah."

These guys are amazing at what they do and they have done it before and can do it again. I'm not guaranteeing that the Hawks hoist the cup but I have never been given any reason to doubt these guys."
hawks,396xvw,New_Slurm,16,Tue Jun 9 18:51:23 2015 UTC,"I am disappointed with the play of Toews and Kane this series.  However, I know they are the kind of players that can take over the entire series in the blink of an eye.  Yesterday stings, but this team is good enough (especially Kane and Toews) to come back and win the Cup, as they demonstrated last time around."
hawks,396xvw,jazzcigarettes,9,Tue Jun 9 18:58:27 2015 UTC,I've posted this a couple times the past few days but through three games in the finals in 2013 toews had 0 points and kane had 1 from an assist.   Plenty of hockey to be played.
hawks,396xvw,Captain_019,5,Tue Jun 9 20:18:11 2015 UTC,We were just down 2-1 in the last series. I'll start worrying about the Hawks if we lose Game 4.
hawks,396xvw,QEDomelets,10,Tue Jun 9 23:50:01 2015 UTC,"People complaining about Toews not showing up this series so far is jumping the gun. Look what he does late in series' and late in games. Remember when we were down two goals to the Ducks and Toews scored twice to force OT? (Disregard what happened after that). Remember what happened game 7 vs the Ducks? Toews took the reigns and scored twice to lead us to victory. He will show up when we need him most. Same with Kane. Not sure about Sharp, he's been underwhelming the whole playoffs it seems like. But we have plenty of great depth."
hawks,396xvw,RaveOn1958,17,Tue Jun 9 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"Toews was a possession monster in this last game, and I don't know why people think he's playing poorly. Kane is the one I'd be more concerned about, but I think he'll find a way to contribute at some point, maybe on the power play. Sharp's done in my opinion though. He hasn't shown me a reason to believe in him in quite a while."
hawks,396xvw,Rerichael,6,Tue Jun 9 20:14:18 2015 UTC,Its because people only tend to care about the scoreboard.   They don't see the things that aren't points on the board.
hawks,396xvw,QEDomelets,3,Tue Jun 9 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think that everyone is disappointed that Toews hasn't been putting the puck in the net.  I completely agree with your comment about his possession game.  He was also a real safety valve when it looked like the Bolts were going to go on a break.  He always seemed to get his stick in the right place.  I think that people are just hoping that he plays at the superstar level they are used to seeing him play at, and not just at ""way better than most NHL players.""   Kane, on the other hand, has looked off.  I know he'll come around soon (he's still a phenomenal player), but he needs to stop trying to carry the puck into the zone against 2 defenders.  The Bolts are putting a quick stop to his wizardry, and he needs to find another way to get the puck into the zone.  Here's hoping he blows us away in Game 4."
hawks,396xvw,Argocap,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I can agree with that. He turned it over more than his usual self would allow. Usually if he's not scoring, he impresses me with his defense or his possession time, but I wasn't really impressed at all yesterday. I do strongly believe he'll pull it all together in these coming games though."
hawks,396xvw,IDoDash,7,Tue Jun 9 20:38:11 2015 UTC,"Losing game three is fine, it just makes game four a must-win."

hawks,396xvw,ricker182,9,Tue Jun 9 23:44:59 2015 UTC,"I have to say that I felt a LOT more negative about that series after 3 games than this one.  They pretty much dominated the first 3 games, and that 3rd game was a pure stomping.  This series has been fairly even so far IMO, or actually based on Corsi numbers, the Hawks have been the better team.  Game 1: Corsi For (CF): 53.6% Corsi Against (CA): 46.4%  Game 2: CF: 50.5% CA: 49.5%  Game 3: CF: 56.8%  CA: 43.2%"
hawks,396xvw,pfeff,3,Tue Jun 9 19:51:56 2015 UTC,Yup. We were dominated against BOS and the Ducks. But hockey is weird. We got a little lucky in those series and we're going to need some luck in this series.
hawks,396xvw,materhern,3,Tue Jun 9 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That, and remember how we looked against the Ducks? They were absolutely running all over us. We got this shit."

hawks,396xvw,death54321,4,Wed Jun 10 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this helps me feel better."
hawks,396xvw,irish711,2,Tue Jun 9 19:23:42 2015 UTC,I definitely believe that the Hawks will be able to pull this off.  Two bad games in a row do not represent how the Hawks have played. Honestly I don't think the Hawks played bad at all.  There  was some goals that should have been in if it weren't for some very good luck for the lightning.  I don't wanna scapegoat the guys who took penalties. They know who they are and I think they want to make up for it.  I'm just not sure what is keeping Kane and Toews from getting their goals in.
hawks,396xvw,Tappen_Zee,2,Wed Jun 10 03:42:32 2015 UTC,"I love the positivity of the comments here, but a few things scream out at me: The team to lose at home in game three to go down 1-2 in the Final has never won the Stanley Cup. This was the first time this playoff the Hawks lost back-to-back. The Lightning are much better on the road than home.   I haven't given up hope, but I won't be devastated if we lose. Three games is, and I have yet to see the Hawks out perform Tampa. This series could easily be 3-0 to Tampa."

hawks,396xvw,pfeff,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"Tampa is too dangerous when they can skate and pass, so Hawks will be fine only if they can contain the speed of Tampa and make more organized offenses actually pose threats with their star powers, both of which they haven't really done a very good job so far.   Not being negative, just being rational. If they lose again tomorrow, we can be 99% sure this series is over. No matter how I look at it, there is little chance the Hawks can come back in 3 wins against a team like Tampa right now."

I guarantee that LeBrun's ""source"" is Saad's agent, skillfully aiming his return volley.  For the next few weeks, both sides will continue to prosecute this PR war.

hawks,394cd6,RunningJokes,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:14:53 2015 UTC,"I want to defend him so much because he gave the world Star Wars but I also hate him so much for what he did to Star Wars. If he could just have admitted before the prequel trilogy that he's more of a 'big picture' kinda guy and needs his work to be heavily edited, we might have had 6 good flicks in that franchise. I should know better by now, but the fact that he just handed in the treatments for the new trilogy and stepped away from the franchise when he sold it to Disney has my expectations impossibly high for Episode VII."
hawks,394cd6,bamacowboy6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:14:33 2015 UTC,I've already forgiven him. Handing over the franchise to Kathleen Kennedy was the best apology he could have given. Whether or not the new movies are good is no longer on him.

hawks,396wyo,BlueLineMenace,17,Wed Jun 10 03:59:09 2015 UTC,Hjalmarsson.  I've even found myself emulating his stride on occasion.  Or Seabrook since I play more like him without that scary slapper though.

hawks,396wyo,Fixner_Blount,14,Tue Jun 9 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"Hjalmarsson because he just lays it all out there every single game. You can almost count on him getting drilled in the knee while blocking a shot, then being back on the ice for his next shift.  Also, you spelled Teuvo's name wrong, OP. Bad form."
hawks,396wyo,yogi_br,2,Tue Jun 9 20:41:57 2015 UTC,But he got the accents right....kinda funny. Haha
hawks,396wyo,Cammi_Granato,11,Wed Jun 10 20:50:18 2015 UTC,Marcus Kruger. The guy plays his heart out and barely gets any recognition for it. Every time he gets  laid out he gets right back up and finishes his shift. Kruger is also one of the best faceoff guys on the team and is one of the best PK guys in the league.
hawks,396wyo,kitsunerex,4,Tue Jun 9 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"And, I'm pretty sure he thinks he's an enforcer too. Anytime there is any kind of a scrum on his shift, you will find him in the middle of it.  Screw Carbomb and Bickell, Freddy Kruger is all you need."
hawks,396wyo,the_rah_monster,11,Wed Jun 10 02:31:20 2015 UTC,"I know he's got a lot of detractors but my favourite player is Crawford. Ever since he came onto the NHL scene in 2011 and played amazing in that Vancouver playoff series. His 2012 playoffs weren't great and he drew a lot of flak from his ""shakiness"" but he responded in 2013 to show that he had really grown mentally and wasn't prone to collapse. I know he needs to play better right now but I believe he has the mental fortitude (and we all know he has the talent) to step up and be solid. I believe he can."
hawks,396wyo,king_of_pancakes,7,Wed Jun 10 00:12:51 2015 UTC,"He's mine too. I will always feel Crawford was the reason we were able to take game 6 with the Bruins to take the cup in 2013. What's more, I've always respected courage and tenacity, from the way he'll shut down reporters asking rude or stupid questions to how quickly he'll throw down on ice. His was my first jersey and he'll always be one of my favourite players.   Having said all that, he's also a player I get the most frustrated with. He routinely plays far below his capabilities, and not just from game to game. Sometimes from play to play even. I will never not love him and maintain that I felt he should have won con smythe in 2013."

I wasn't really in to hockey until my tennis teacher told me that I should watch the Blackhawks, since I'm from Chicago and Hossa plays for them. He only spoke Slovak so I payed attention to his favorite Slovak player to have more to talk to him about. This happened to be in 2010 when Hossa scored a goal against Russia in the Olympics (a game which they won). They may not have gone far, but they beat Russia. I'd stay up until the early hours of the morning or get up at 5 to see late-night games from Slovakia. Hossa's speed and ability to find an open teammate amazed me back then as it does now.   Marian Hossa is worth the hype. He's the best."

Game 5 loss against the ducks after TWO succesful 6-attacker attempts without a goalie in period 3 with less than two minutes only for an OT loss was the most disappointing loss by far.

Great 4th line, but honestly at this point you gotta move Shaw up with Toews and Saad.  Kane's either re-injured himself or isn't seeing the ice well and Hossa's not finishing the great plays he seems to start.  Crawford's letting in softies that utterly negate the highlight reel saves, and even the mighty Duncan Keith isn't leaving a dent.    Tonight was a totally winnable game against a blatantly injured goalie, but the Blackhawks are fading away.  The next game is the series, and I wonder if the guys in that locker room even believe they're capable of it at this point.    It took all my restraint not to go full irrational hate-driven meatball in this post.  Had to settle for about 40% effort, which is about on par with the Blackhawks performance tonight."

hawks,3943ox,beegeepee,2,Tue Jun 9 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"Lol, I was really suprised at how negative this thread is.  Normally Hawks fans are fairly rational.  I think it largely comes from all the past success of the Hawks.  No other Chicago sports team has repeatedly come through in the clutch then these Hawks have over the last decade.  If any Chicago sports team can overcome a 2-1 deficit without home ice advantage it is these Hawks.  I agree with a lot of people in that depth may be hurting the Hawks defense and wearing them down.  However, it's not like we got blown out.    In fact, I would say we looked worse through the first three games of the Nashville series as well as the Anaheim series this year.  I mean, we went to our backup goalie the first game of the playoffs.  Obviously being down 2-1 isn't ideal.  However, we could have won every game.  We SHOULD have won last night.  Maybe the Hawks got over confident after winning the first one.  I know Toews said they may have been a little too relaxed when the Anaheim series started.    All I know is if you think this series is even close to over, I think you are a fool.  You don't win Stanley Cups and Olympic Gold medals without fighting though adversity.  That's all these Hawks know how to do."

hawks,3943ox,bromar14,14,Tue Jun 9 03:01:52 2015 UTC,"Why are we passing the puck for a good 10 seconds with only :20 to go? Hit a rocket at Bishop and force him to make a save. If it deflects off someone, retrieve the puck and repeat. One of those lasers will end up in the back eventually.  Crawford kinda showed up today, but the game-winner was his fault. He was all the way out to one side. Am I watching the Blackhawks or am I watching the AHL right now?"
hawks,3943ox,paulrulez742,4,Tue Jun 9 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"Crow didn't really show up, but our defense didn't do him any favors.   It's unfair to put it all on Crow, but I don't believe the best Crow showed up either.   There are many aspects of our game that we need to adjust to take this series from TB, but our defense is the most glaring of those issues."
hawks,3943ox,Aperture-Employee,5,Tue Jun 9 04:15:40 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Keith and Seabrook were playing catch and it almost hopped out of the zone because of it. So Seabs shot it along the boards and then that's where the puck stayed for the next 25 seconds."
hawks,3943ox,PublickStews,20,Tue Jun 9 03:12:15 2015 UTC,"You guys are crazy with the negativity. I'm the most pessimistic sports fan I've ever known. I'll declare any of my other teams dead in the water at the slightest sense of trouble but THIS team is the exception. Since 2010, they've played 16 playoff series (not counting this one). They've been down 2-1 in 7 of those series, yet they've won 5 of them (2010 Nashville, 2013 Detroit, 2013 Boston, 2014 St. Louis, 2015 Anaheim). The only time they've lost when down 2-1 was 2012 Phoenix and 2014 Kings.   I'm disappointed, but I honestly don't think they got outplayed that badly, if at all, and I'm certainly not panicking."
hawks,3943ox,Jmckay03,7,Tue Jun 9 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Everything this guy has said is spot on. The negativity is ridiculous on this sub, the Hawks will figure out a way like they always do. They get better as the series goes along and I have full faith in them to start stepping it up."

You can't expect to win a series if you've only held the lead for literally 6:19 out of literally 180 minutes. That is an abysmal 3.5%. The Hawks need to wake the fuck up if they want to make it past 5 games at this rate. They have the fucking talent, but they being way too damn sloppy."

We were in this position last series, and if any team can turn it around, it's this team."

hawks,3943ox,SpottyRasang,3,Tue Jun 9 03:00:33 2015 UTC,I remember arguing with a fellow hawk fan that Seabrook vs Sharp if one was to be traded. Can you imagine our D any worse? That girl was mostly basing her analysis on Sharps hotness (she's a pretty rational and knowledgeable fan in all non sharp areas) No argument now.
hawks,3943ox,meatyfingers,4,Tue Jun 9 03:57:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah Seabrook is huge for us, especially in the playoffs. Of course, no argument from me about Sharp's hotness. That is one gorgeous motherfucker."

hawks,3943ox,_Berns,2,Tue Jun 9 04:10:21 2015 UTC,I was just about to post that. We need to start getting the first goal against these guys. We can't always be playing from behind.
hawks,3943ox,BearFan34,3,Tue Jun 9 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Those open net chances we missed by Hossa and Teuvo... If you don't take your chances and squander a lead 13 seconds after scoring, you cannot and will not win a cup. We were good for about 10 minutes in the first, second period was a stalemate but we had some luck. Our passing has been awful. I am trying to stay positive, but sitting at work at 6:20 am on a Tuesday has me cynical at best! I haven't seen enough from our big players. Just very frustrating and embarrassing when a bunch of boys are showing men how to play hockey."
hawks,3943ox,yorozuyajin-chan,3,Tue Jun 9 04:21:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I got to attend last night.  At face value, no less!  I'm still hoarse.  By the end of the second period my throat hurt from screaming during the late period penalty kill.  That was so damned intense.  The crowd noise was deafening.  At the end of the first, I was very confident.  I was thinking in terms of the 1st game, we were going to come back and win.  The Hawks had weathered their early pressure then dominated the latter half of the first period.  The Hawks should have been up 2-1.  Should have been.  The Bolts had the edge in the second.  I had hoped the PK would have created momentum for the third.  But it didn't.  Tampa's speed is disruptive.  It became difficult to maintain possession without their sticks getting to the puck, affecting passing especially.  I think their speed is the single biggest reason why the Hawks can't generate offense.  It isn't like the Hawks are that much 'slower' but Tampa wins on team speed.  It is a problem.  I never really noticed it as much while watching the tight shots on TV. But from the cheap seats at the UC, it was apparent.    After the game I just sat in my seat and watched the UC empty.  I didn't want to leave.  Very deflated.  I also know I might never get to experience this again.  I had better, but nothing is guaranteed.    Go Hawks."

hawks,3943ox,SpottyRasang,7,Tue Jun 9 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"Can we finally cut the big bad hawks act folks, I blame this on our fan bases over confidence that we will whoop them. We got cocky and now our boys are not performing. We can win if we focus and play a better D, but that means our youngins gotta learn quick on what to do from our top 4. We had them on the ropes towards the end of the first and played well during the second but shit the bed in the third. P.s. WHERE ARE YOU SHARPIE THAT I ONCE KNEW, WE NEED YOUR DRIVE AND SHOT!"
hawks,3943ox,WheyDaBusAt,4,Tue Jun 9 04:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well, our overconfidence doesn't really affect the play on the ice. What matters is whether or not the players underestimated the Lightning.

If TB was going to keep him in, the Blackhawks needed to take advantage of that as much as humanly possible and play like they did in the first period, not give him an easy go of it.  I'm confident they'll tie up the series on Wednesday but they really needed to play with more energy in this one and not completely snooze through tonight's game."
hawks,3943ox,LettuceC,5,Tue Jun 9 03:18:14 2015 UTC,"I basically said as much in a post on /r/hockey - there is plenty to be mad about from that performance but what I think it all boils down to is that Kane & Toews have been missing to this point, offensively, and either they find a way to get going and we win.  Or they don't.  I think it's that simple."

Bishop is hurting all game and our pressure was moderate at best. The total domination we had after TB's goal in the first was nowhere to be found in the rest of the game. Once again we couldn't enter the zone, and paid the price. Kaner and Toews need to step up, because they are nowhere to be found in this series so far."

hawks,3943ox,DrkGhst87,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"The Hawks need to NOT get so excited every time they score and then allow an easy Lightning goal seconds after.  That was terrible.  It's a struggle for them to finish the game and hold a lead.  A lot of mistakes were made this game.  Our stars need to start showing up.  We've had plenty of time to observe the team and we need to start capitalizing on their weaknesses.    But most important of all, STAY FOCUSED.  You've got this!  Let's go Hawks!!"

hawks,3943ox,Swoosh_312,3,Tue Jun 9 03:11:59 2015 UTC,I'm not giving up but man was that disappointing. They seemed so surprised Tampa would come out strong after the 2nd goal...just upsetting.
hawks,3943ox,squirrelwatch,3,Tue Jun 9 03:17:06 2015 UTC,Hopefully this lights a fire under them for the rest of this series. Missed opportunities cost us along with some bad defensive lapses. We played great and they had some garbage goals tonight. Crow kept us in the game. We need to be better and help him more. Game 4 is a must win. Period. Go Hawks!
hawks,3943ox,yorozuyajin-chan,3,Tue Jun 9 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have no doubt that Anaheim would be up on Tampa right now had we lost to them in the WCF. We're better than they are. We're better than Tampa. We just need to get our asses in gear."
hawks,3943ox,BudBill18,2,Tue Jun 9 04:09:00 2015 UTC,God I'm still pissed off and I can't even find a Tampa player to take it out on. The closest one I can think of is Paquette and I can't remember that his face looks like. Where is Perry and Kesler when you need them..

hawks,3943ox,bowhunter2995,2,Tue Jun 9 03:09:10 2015 UTC,This is the most underrated comment ever.  Hawks in 6!
hawks,3943ox,tgross25,3,Tue Jun 9 03:45:20 2015 UTC,Loss should hang on Seabrooks and Cumiskeys shoulders. Both had a chance to step up and make a defensive play and neither did shit. Absolutely piss poor effort by the two. Seabrook could have laid out to block the pass and Cumiskey could have went to a knee or laid out and the shot would have been blocked. I still think think the Hawks will bounce back but they are making it unnecessarily hard on themselves. Fuck I hate losses when it comes down to players not giving 100% every play.  I went back and watched the replay of the last goal and Sharp also had every opportunity to make a play on Paquette and he did nothing. Sharp was behind Paquette before the pass to him and was just standing around. If Sharp put his stick on Paquettes stick he could have changed the angle of the shot. Hell he could have crosschecked Paquette in the back to clear him out and take a penalty and that may have stopped the goal. Fucking ticks me off when the loss can be avoided by players giving 100% and not expecting someone else to make a play.

hawks,392s7h,Anomalyzero,0,Mon Jun 8 21:01:39 2015 UTC,Now if we could justify all the decoration with consistent play it might be worth it.
hawks,395xgw,SavageEatsBabies,11,Tue Jun 9 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"I think he did okay. No real screw ups. which is sort of all you can ask of a young guy in his first playoff appearance. I'm still pissed about Bicks back in for Versteeg. One was working, the other was not....why do we choose to go with ""not"" ? I get it we pay The Not a lot of 'effing money and expect him to show up during playoffs, but he simply isn't...I wish Q would just bite the bullet and keep chancing Steeg.   I realize that's not what cost us the game but who knows what additional chances and looks we could've had if Steeg had been out there hustling like he has been. Grr. Sorry for this rant on your TVR post :/"
hawks,395xgw,Stef41,3,Tue Jun 9 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"I'm betting Q wanted someone who could slow down the Lightning with some hits. Versteeg has a history of turning the puck over after trying his best Kane impersonations. Sure, he looked pretty solid in Game 2, but he didn't really perform very much either. Meanwhile Bickell needed a game off to recover. Bickell was pretty solid in the 2nd half of the Ducks series with his hitting and passing (not so much with the shooting *tears*)."
hawks,395xgw,c0ld--,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:19:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you're right about Q's reasoning. I guess my thought (for all that's worth lol) is that with Bishop not playing at 100%, we need to just pepper that net with shots. From all over. And I think, however marginally, Steeg is more likely to aid in that process.   But at the same time, I get the importance that hits can have. I don't think either choice is fabulous, I just see Steegs as the lesser of two evils at this point. Maybe it's just my resentment of Bicks this season that's clouding my judgement lol"
hawks,395xgw,Stef41,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"Steeg is more likely to aid in that process   You are 100% correct there. I haven't seen Bickell shoot very much. I'm sure there's a reason for that though as Q might be placing more importance on zone entry and forechecking for Bickell, rather than his shot attempts.  In short, I think Bickell is doing a good job and clearing space for other shooters."
hawks,395xgw,c0ld--,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"I think Bickell is doing a pretty brutal job. I was fine with seeing him back in the lineup for the reasons you provided. I hoped maybe he'd open up some space for Kane along the way, and find his way to the net to create some traffic.   He was brutal and Q barely had him on the ice in the third period. I don't think Kane's troubles are entirely a result of Bickell, obviously as he missed a couple games, but he certainly didn't seem to do much to help. I'd rather see someone else on that second line, maybe Sharp to hope that they can get him going too.   As far as his shooting, that wrist shot of his is seemingly constantly getting blocked and ending up out of play. It's been frustrating to see and he's not getting to the net enough to create traffic, deflections, rebound chances, etc.   I'll be curious to see if Bickell stays in the lineup in game 4. I get the value he adds with being physical and forechecking, but clearly Q was not pleased last night."
hawks,395xgw,IlliniXC,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"The thing is... bicks hits. He's no big buff but the guy hits. In the series against anaheim he led in hits against one of the most physical teams out there.  Now on they lightning where there's no his because we adjusted to their feat play, he isn't needed.  Or is he?  The bolts are like last year's rangers.  They're a quick team with a solid enough D. There's two ways to fight this: first is with more offense, like versteeg. Problem is that our defense is what needs help, not our offense. The second is hitting hard to slow them down. That's what bicks is for."
hawks,395xgw,loaferbro,8,Wed Jun 10 16:11:57 2015 UTC,"He wasn't great, but he did well. I think he was better than both Cuminsky and Runblad have been."
hawks,395xgw,prisonstrength,4,Tue Jun 9 14:55:59 2015 UTC,Cuminsky made a mistake that resulted in a goal so yeah.
hawks,395xgw,New_Slurm,0,Tue Jun 9 16:46:56 2015 UTC,Didn't he have a turnover in game 2 too that ended up costing us a goal?  Edit: Game 2 not 1
hawks,395xgw,STLL217,5,Tue Jun 9 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was any better or worse than either of those guys.  He has a couple bad turnovers to start when he didn't clear it up the boards hard enough, but settled in after that.  They all really haven't gotten enough minutes to judge."
hawks,395xgw,badseedjr,7,Tue Jun 9 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"All I remember is a really bad attempted up-the-boards clear, right to a waiting Tampa forward. He was facing the guy and it seemed to me that he had time and options. That. Can't. Happen.  (That said, he's not the only offender here. When they get hemmed into their own end for uncomfortable lengths of time, it's usually due to repeated, failed up-the-boards clears.)"
hawks,395xgw,Cobaltate,3,Tue Jun 9 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"Other than the turnover behind the net I think he played as well as I had hoped.  I think he made some smart offensive plays, good passing, and even had a couple of shots if I recall.  It took me most of the first period to figure out what number he was because I didn't know going into this game.   Honestly, I've really enjoyed watching TT play and was excited to get another rookie out there.  I think with those two and a couple of our other signings/prospects, we've got some extremely talented individuals working their way up. TVR getting experience playing at this level of the NHL is going to be so beneficial down the road so even if he was a little shaky or whatever, the experience of playing under the pressure and excitement of the cup finals is invaluable."
hawks,395xgw,AcousticArmor,4,Tue Jun 9 16:05:33 2015 UTC,At least he didn't get posterized like Cumiskey on that 4th Tampa goal. cringe
hawks,395xgw,TheFitz023,2,Tue Jun 9 19:40:55 2015 UTC,He looked fast out there. Hope to see him back out for game 4 since he should have shaken that rust off..  But Bickell on the other hand.. needs to go. Versteeg has looked better.
hawks,395xgw,djb2287,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:38:39 2015 UTC,I think he did ok. He made some smart plays and I never really saw him get burned.
hawks,395xgw,Gobyinmypants,0,Tue Jun 9 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"TVR played better than expected. Plus this is his first nhl playoff game so lots of pressure. But whenever he was on the ice, the lightning targeted him and reved up their offense. He got some nice shots on bishop. Hopefully he will learn from this, not mentioning that turnover behind the net."

hawks,391nxa,Stef41,18,Mon Jun 8 17:59:32 2015 UTC,Best VR.
hawks,391nxa,Pripiit,17,Mon Jun 8 16:53:30 2015 UTC,Talk about getting tossed right into the fire. Get 'em TVR.
hawks,391nxa,e39,15,Mon Jun 8 16:47:33 2015 UTC,TVR gets an Ovetch-trick in 3 of the next 4 games and we win in 6 at home. After 22 NHL games he wins the Conn Smythe.
hawks,391nxa,Aperture-Employee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:54:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I think this is pretty obvious.
hawks,391nxa,DildoGiftcard,12,Mon Jun 8 23:32:12 2015 UTC,We need some goddamn optimism up in here so I'm gonna say that TVR will rock the shit out of the Lightning tonight.
hawks,391nxa,TheFitz023,9,Mon Jun 8 17:07:34 2015 UTC,This would be a great time for him to get his first NHL goal!
hawks,391nxa,Queen_LaQueefah,8,Mon Jun 8 17:34:55 2015 UTC,LOL I just said the same thing! Plus Versteeg won't be there to steal it!
hawks,391nxa,yorozuyajin-chan,10,Mon Jun 8 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"Looks like Versteeg is out tonight , tonight is the night to regain your first NHL goal!"
hawks,391nxa,yorozuyajin-chan,17,Mon Jun 8 17:34:17 2015 UTC,Not happy about this. Versteeg has been totally fine in the first two games. I have no faith in Bickell anymore.
hawks,391nxa,RaveOn1958,3,Mon Jun 8 17:47:38 2015 UTC,Where'd you hear that?
hawks,391nxa,SouthsideHyde,2,Mon Jun 8 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"There's a post on the front page of /r/hawks. Bickell in, Steeger out."

hawks,391nxa,tgross25,4,Mon Jun 8 16:48:51 2015 UTC,"Well, with the sheltering he can get at home with last change, I doubt he could possibly be much worse than Rundblad, and given that Rundblad's had his sample size without showing much, I'll take the unknown (upside, I hope) that TVR has to offer."
hawks,391nxa,tempestatic,4,Mon Jun 8 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"Seems like a risky move, but fuck it: in Q I trust"
hawks,391nxa,Flibbens,3,Mon Jun 8 20:09:18 2015 UTC,@ESPNChiPowers:   2015-06-08 16:14:54 UTC  Looks like Trevor van Riemsdyk will replace David Rundblad in tonight’s lineup.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
hawks,391nxa,TweetPoster,4,Mon Jun 8 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't like Rundlbad, this makes me nervous."
hawks,391nxa,mattinthecrown,10,Mon Jun 8 19:39:24 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly.  I'm worried TVR will make me feel about Rundblad like Rundblad made me feel about Rozsival.
hawks,391nxa,brianskuhar,2,Mon Jun 8 20:29:21 2015 UTC,I'm so happy. He must be really prepared to play because I highly doubt Q would put in a rookie with 18 nhl games into a SCF if he isn't fully healed or ready to play.
hawks,391nxa,Captain_019,2,Mon Jun 8 20:32:19 2015 UTC,He better get more than just five minutes of ice time regardless of whether the top guys can go 30+.  Icing a guy for 5-6 shifts just takes them out of the game and nobody's ready to go after sitting the majority of the period.
hawks,391nxa,PaddyKane,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"Well, shit just got real. Really real"

hawks,391nxa,ChicagoIce,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:14:46 2015 UTC,Seems kinda risky.  Hope it works out
hawks,391nxa,LouChainz88,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for this, Yea TVR is a rookie and doesn't have much experience but he can't really be any worse than Rundblad"

hawks,390s0p,StonedSquare,-1,Sun Jun 14 00:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what in the rules allows players to have an opponent riding their bodies trapping both sticks against them to take the puck away.   Did I miss a rule somewhere?  Hossa had a break a way stopped because of the Tampa Bay coat on him. Saad as well. I understand it being a physical game,but if you are going to allow that why not just let them fucking tackle already?"
hawks,390s0p,automaticsystemhabit,-4,Tue Jun 9 05:10:05 2015 UTC,"Refs suck. Hoss trip was damn near a penalty shot, and goaltender interference on saad was horseshit. Clear evaluation is needed"
hawks,390s0p,loaferbro,-6,Tue Jun 9 03:08:15 2015 UTC,Evaluation? No. An investigation rather. These refs are being paid the fuck off.
hawks,390s0p,livinlifeman,0,Tue Jun 9 03:19:32 2015 UTC,It's Bettman trying to grow smaller markets. Watch it go to 6.
hawks,390s0p,ItsMEMusic,-9,Tue Jun 9 03:22:35 2015 UTC,6? Nah definite 7. Think of the revenue the nhl loses not going 7 games. Its utter bullshit. Oh what's up shitty bolt fans?? Bring them downvotes haha
hawks,390s0p,livinlifeman,5,Tue Jun 9 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"I don't want to wait until Wednesday. If we're just going to crash and burn, get it the fuck over with."
hawks,390s0p,TheFitz023,4,Tue Jun 9 03:06:23 2015 UTC,Toews and Kane need to start producing offensively.
hawks,390s0p,Captain_019,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:06:11 2015 UTC,Hedman and Strallman are the new nbc Crosby's apparently.
hawks,390s0p,livinlifeman,3,Tue Jun 9 03:06:07 2015 UTC,And Perry.
hawks,390s0p,ItsMEMusic,-3,Tue Jun 9 03:07:05 2015 UTC,"He's an after thought at this point. Don't fret, soon hedman will be golfing shanking a putt remembering how they lost in 7."
hawks,390s0p,livinlifeman,5,Tue Jun 9 03:10:39 2015 UTC,Let's go Hawks! Looking forward to a hard fought game 4!

hawks,390s0p,eskEMO_iwl,4,Tue Jun 9 03:04:55 2015 UTC,We sidnt much show up after the 1st but god bless it the officiating has been the worst I've ever seen.
hawks,390s0p,livinlifeman,4,Tue Jun 9 03:04:54 2015 UTC,I don't want to wait a day for revenge
hawks,390s0p,Cartortus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:04:43 2015 UTC,I feel like I did in Anaheim. I don't like this feeling. Can anybody teach me apathy? I care too much and it sucks so hard.
hawks,390s0p,ItsMEMusic,-3,Tue Jun 9 03:04:30 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day man....we don't get paid ungodly amounts to care. Kane still has that 10.5 mil to blow when not showing up to work. We don't get paid if we don't show up. Thats how i see it. Im a diehard but at the same time, I'm not gonna let it affect my life."

hawks,390s0p,meatyfingers,-6,Tue Jun 9 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"It's not as much that he hasn't been playing well, it's the fact that he seems to be the favorite topic of NBC now... Endless cheers and support for Tampa, little to none for us."
hawks,390s0p,Warhawk5681,10,Tue Jun 9 03:10:45 2015 UTC,Words cannot describe the fucking anger I feel right now. What a disappointing fucking ending.
hawks,390s0p,JBreezyyNY,3,Tue Jun 9 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"Is it weird that I don't even feel angry? I just feel sad.  Now I'm not the one out there skating and sweating everything out so I don't know everything that's going on, but I know the Blackhawks could've played so much better than that."
hawks,390s0p,MrTambourineDan,2,Tue Jun 9 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"Not over yet, folks. As a Cubbie, I am used to heartbreak. We gotta regroup and win another one on the road which he have already have done. Not a great game, I agree. But, we are faithful.   Have a good Tuesday, and we will all see each other on Wednesday."

hawks,390s0p,meatyfingers,3,Tue Jun 9 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. Not the end of the world, brother. See ya Wednesday night!"
hawks,390s0p,JCardCubs,5,Tue Jun 9 03:16:02 2015 UTC,The fuck? Are you high? Have you not seen how the cubbies have been playing? For a team with basically a rookie roster we've been shit hot.
hawks,390s0p,livinlifeman,0,Tue Jun 9 03:09:27 2015 UTC,"Comparing apples to oranges, literally no contribution"
hawks,390s0p,Captain_019,7,Tue Jun 9 03:07:14 2015 UTC,Such a disappointing loss...
hawks,390s0p,crustyruffles,3,Tue Jun 9 03:03:41 2015 UTC,"When our only options for defencemen come from Rockford's second and third line, bad things can happen. Especially in the Cup.  That being said, let's hope Oduya can get back on the ice and the depth doesn't shrink anymore. I have faith in Q and Tazer to get this turned around.   And just remember: It's only a matter of time before Kane goes off.  See you wonderful folks on Wednesday."
hawks,390s0p,ItsMEMusic,3,Tue Jun 9 03:03:21 2015 UTC,Somebody needs to dry Kane's kindling. It seems wet.
hawks,390s0p,meatyfingers,9,Tue Jun 9 03:05:50 2015 UTC,This is one of those games where you have to feel like they are now waaay behind. Tampa has outplayed them every game. I mean we've had a lead for what? 2:40 this series. Once again a soft goal in the first period kills us
hawks,390s0p,mikerhoa,8,Tue Jun 9 03:02:21 2015 UTC,ON TO A MUST WIN GAME 4.  ALL HANDS ON DECK!!!
hawks,390s0p,jazzcigarettes,9,Tue Jun 9 03:02:21 2015 UTC,Lol what the fuck is wrong with yall. It's one game. Have you not watched this team before or something? We out shot them this game and I bet when possession numbers come out we'll have beat them there this game too. Bishop put up a .947 that's hard to beat.
hawks,390s0p,KnightsoftheNi,3,Tue Jun 9 03:02:11 2015 UTC,What's wrong with us is that we've only held a lead for around 5% of this entire damned series. That's what's wrong with us
hawks,390s0p,SpottyRasang,2,Tue Jun 9 03:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's just that the fans really expected them to win this game, which was home, after we split them at their own rink. Obviously anyone that says the series is over is dead-wrong, but a lot of people, including myself, were expecting a big win here at the UC."
hawks,390s0p,nugeballz,6,Tue Jun 9 03:08:59 2015 UTC,The sad thing is that Bishop by no means should've had a .947 save percentage with the way he was moving out there the first two periods. We just couldn't capitalize.
hawks,390s0p,KikiFlowers,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"Really true. I'm not panicky or anything, but we definitely need to capitalize.  Also your flair makes my heart ache."
hawks,390s0p,livinlifeman,3,Tue Jun 9 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I mean it sucks we lost. But it's not like this was Game 7. This was Game 3, we can still recover and come back to kick some ass."
hawks,390s0p,Nefarious-,3,Tue Jun 9 03:04:04 2015 UTC,"Remember that there are a lot of ""new"" fans. The true fans know that Toews is now officially enraged. Kane....idk. kane doesn't give a shit from what i see."
hawks,390s0p,jazzcigarettes,6,Tue Jun 9 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"that's fantastic, we lost, on our ice, and that's the third game in a row our top players haven't done a god damn thing."
hawks,390s0p,Nefarious-,3,Tue Jun 9 03:03:29 2015 UTC,2013 kane and toews had one point through 3 games. We've lost on our ice before and been down in series before.

hawks,390s0p,Citizen-Kaner,2,Tue Jun 9 03:05:41 2015 UTC,Now we have guys like saad and teuvo.   It's not like we got shut out or dominated and you'd thing we did reading this thread
hawks,390s0p,blastermike,9,Tue Jun 9 03:09:20 2015 UTC,Bickell better not play Wednesday. And they better figure out how to get Kane to produce.
hawks,390s0p,IDquad8819,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:01:44 2015 UTC,"Let's get the PB&K line back out there for fucks sake, Steeger has been solid against these guys."
hawks,390s0p,Citizen-Kaner,3,Tue Jun 9 18:03:21 2015 UTC,Hard to play his game when he's stuck with a slow bag of shit as a linemate
hawks,390s0p,ChaplnGrillSgt,3,Tue Jun 9 03:04:45 2015 UTC,That's why I said how to. I see Kane trying but why put in Bickell over Versteeg?
hawks,390s0p,Gobyinmypants,4,Tue Jun 9 03:09:26 2015 UTC,And Toews...
hawks,390s0p,paulrulez742,3,Tue Jun 9 03:02:29 2015 UTC,? He didn't score but he worked his ass off
hawks,390s0p,Jellooooo,4,Tue Jun 9 03:03:25 2015 UTC,I always thought we were better than this. They should not feel very good about the outcome of this game.
hawks,390s0p,TheRiot530,6,Tue Jun 9 03:01:35 2015 UTC,What can we do? Onto the next. Let's hope our boys play better.

hawks,390s0p,jangerhofer,6,Tue Jun 9 02:59:23 2015 UTC,I think Hedman should be right up there for the Conn Smythe.
hawks,390s0p,Lystrodom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:59:18 2015 UTC,"There have been further rule changes made relating to face-off location to avoid penalizing teams for plays intended to create bona fide scoring opportunities. Specifically, the following are ""categories of plays"" where face-offs will remain in the attacking zone despite the fact that the attacking team was technically responsible for the stoppage in play: Shots at the net by a player on the attacking team where: (i) the shot breaks the glass; (ii) the shot goes off the side of the net and deflects out of play; (iii) the shot goes off the dasher boards or glass and deflects out of play; (iv) the shot is tipped or deflected out of play by a teammate; and (v) the shot becomes wedged in or on the exterior of the goal net."

hawks,390s0p,ChaplnGrillSgt,2,Tue Jun 9 02:58:25 2015 UTC,I agree completely. I'm not sure if they just assumed they would win the cup or if they don't care whether they win or lose because of all the success they've had in the recent years. Not sure which is worse either...

hawks,392twa,qwidjib0,3,Tue Jun 9 14:51:22 2015 UTC,This.  Should be a good option now that the students are away.  Honorable mention to Mugsy's if you want to wash it all down with the best wings you've ever had.
hawks,392twa,gValo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:44:49 2015 UTC,Have they changed the garden policy for the final? I was there for the May 23rd game and they refused to turn on the game audio.   I used to love that place. Now I'd rather be at Maggie's or home.   One of the two Buffalo Wild Wings could be fun to watch the game at.

hawks,394721,AskMeAboutMy-,6,Tue Jun 9 03:26:40 2015 UTC,"My best (and only) guess is that he's a proven veteran and without him there's a good chance the team as a whole would lose physical presence.  He's got over twice as many hits as any other player besides Seabrook, you think Q really wants to lose that?"
hawks,394721,jdshark,3,Tue Jun 9 04:00:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's just the physical presence. Versteeg has won a Cup as well, he's just as experienced in these situations as Bickell.   That being said Bickell isn't offering much of anything right now, so in my opinion Versteeg needs to be back in for game 4. He was offering us a lot more with his creativity, board play, and overall hustle, than Bickell with his extra few hits."

Bickell was terrible with no hustle and that damn late hit, thanks for reminding everyone of your production on that.  I was pissed last night, woke up the kids and everything from the other side of the house.  Seeing these guys in games 6 & 7 last series i went oh boy there it is, there it is.

Also per Mark Lazerus with the Times:   Bickell will be back on the second line with Brad Richards and Patrick Kane, as Joel Quenneville again split up Kane and Jonathan Toews. Kris Versteeg is the odd-man out of the lineup. Also expected to enter the lineup is rookie defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk, likely in for David Rundblad.

The UC gets a bad rap because of how well they filter out the sound of the crowd on TV so that you can hear the announcer clearly. There was a Bulls playoff game this year and I remember the announcer saying that the crowd noise was so loud that he couldn't hear anything, yet you could only hear a faint whisper of the crowd.  High quality sound engineers =/= quiet fanbase"
hawks,38y97h,rtomek,4,Mon Jun 8 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"This is very true. I've been to many of the playoff games this year and it's been rowdy, especially when the Hawks are really rolling. And I've been to playoff games every year so it's not some small sample size. It basically comes up every thread how ""quiet"" the UC sounds but it really is just on television. Up in the 300s it's a fantastic experience and there's a reason why the players always talk about how great the fans are and how great of a city Chicago is to play in   EDIT: This is my personal opinion, not necessarily fact"

It's relatively quiet."
hawks,38y97h,honestbleeps,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:16:33 2015 UTC,"It's quiet for Bulls games too. My guess behind it is that it's due to how much tickets go for.  Not hating on anybody that wants to go, but the white collar crowd is much less likely to come and make some noise the entire game.  Fair enough though, it's supply and demand. As long as they're enjoying themselves, no problems from me."
hawks,38y97h,crackthecracker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:33:38 2015 UTC,Bulls crowd in this years playoffs were so quite.
hawks,38y97h,adilp,0,Mon Jun 8 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the place is relatively quiet. I think the reason why is because of the changes that happened when Rocky Wirtz took over. Not saying they're bad changes, but it created a massive influx of new fans, and they aren't quite yet accustomed to aggressive fandom. I remember going to games in the old Chicago Stadium when the balconies shook during the anthem, and the fans that showed up then were rabid. Only diehards were willing to put up with Dollar Bill's shit, not because they wanted to, but they had to to see the games. The sudden growth of the fanbase has brought in a bunch of casuals (for lack of a better term), and they just are more laid back. You watch the anthem on TV now, and people are just standing there clapping and taking pictures on their phones. They don't go nuts like they used to.  I do think as time goes on it will get loud again, as the newer fans mold into diehards. But right now, the fanbase is still growing pretty fast, which brings in an inexperienced crowd. I don't think it's fair to say they're fairweather fans, just because the old policy did nothing to generate a growing fanbase. In a city as large as Chicago, going from a small fanbase to a large one can be insanely drastic, especially when both the organization's approach to the fans' relationship and the emergence of a dynasty happened at about the same time. It will level off eventually, though, and when that happens I think the UC will get loud again."
hawks,38y97h,dotmmb,6,Mon Jun 8 10:42:32 2015 UTC,"I think you have this wrong.  First, the old stadium was smaller an everybody was packed on top of each other.  The design of that building just allowed the sound to reverberate through out the entire place.  Definitely not designed with acoustics in mind.  Second and more important, tickets were like $10, the crowd was  MUCH more blue collar, and it got really rowdy.  I remember fights breaking out, swearing and yelling was pretty much non stop for the duration of the game.  It is 100x more family oriented now.  And tickets are way more expensive which draws a different crowd.  Magnify that for the playoffs, those lower bowl tickets are  $700+ face value, just an entirely different fan base than what you would have had in the 70s/80s."
hawks,38y97h,hchux,-1,Mon Jun 8 12:41:07 2015 UTC,"I believe it's partially fair weather fans but also because of how much success we've had lately. Our fan base is not cup starved. We expect to be here now and we have begun to take the playoffs for granted. Compare us to Minnesota, St Louis and Winnipeg and our crowd level is a joke. Sorry, but it's true."
hawks,38y97h,Siggy778,2,Mon Jun 8 12:07:53 2015 UTC,"I've watched enough games to know that it's much quieter than many other arenas. Here's proof: Game 6 vs the Ducks during the second period it was so quiet that Doc Emerick said, ""I feel like I should be whispering it's so quiet in here."""
