mturk,3e4i7e,Ddybear,3,Tue Jul 21 22:48:35 2015 UTC,You are literally the best.  I wanna make a HIT for you for getting this done (and for HIT Scraper in general.) If you PM me your mturk ID I'll give you a qual. Hell or set up a Paypal donate page so I can donate. Is this something that's allowed in this subreddit?
mturk,3e4i7e,auralgasm,2,Tue Jul 21 23:43:53 2015 UTC,Thank you! It looks good in Waterfox (64-bit version of Firefox) too.

If I click the ""don't show this anymore"" in the 2nd box will that stop both boxes or just the second? I don't mind seeing one but two to click through takes too long."

mturk,3e3p1n,WailingHost,11,Tue Jul 21 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"Requesters are still going to use the platform. This is a whole lot of hysteria about nothing.  The cheap ones, the ones that probably shouldn't be in the business of paying anyone to get anything done, will likely leave - as they should.  I do believe requesters will implement more quality controls, just because they'll be paying more for work. I don't know that for sure, of course, but it wouldn't surprise me at all."
mturk,3e3p1n,withanamelikesmucker,7,Tue Jul 21 19:12:30 2015 UTC,"Two of the most well-paying, largest requesters that I've been able to beat $10/hr with - Crowdsurf and Crowdsource - are jumping ship to other platforms.  No roadmap has been offered for platform upgrades, nor has there been a reason given for the hikes beyond ""we want more money"".  This is bad."
mturk,3e3p1n,tenmileswide,3,Tue Jul 21 20:18:42 2015 UTC,Is Crowdsurf leaving mturk entirely? I haven't seen anything from them about moving.
mturk,3e3p1n,snideways,3,Tue Jul 21 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, never mind, they actually edited their blog post. It used to sound like they were moving off Mturk, but here's the new text.  http://crowdsurfwork.com/blog/   Earlier this year, we launched our private CrowdSurfWork platform in order to create a more user-friendly experience for all of our freelancers.  We have invested much time and attention into making your experience the best that it can be. But there was link_icon_bluealways something preventing us from being completely independent on the CrowdSurfWork platform. Now we have found the missing link – INSTANT PAYMENT OPTIONS through Upwork!  We are excited to announce that we will make work available on the private CrowdSurfWork platform, which you can access through Upwork!  We plan to move tasks to Upwork towards the end of July, so let’s get started!   There's no longer a ""We are moving off of Mturk"" statement, just that Upwork is an alternative - but if Mturk is going to charge CS more money for fees, that will probably get passed along to anyone still doing jobs on Mturk.  There won't be a reason for Mturk at that point, really."
mturk,3e3p1n,tenmileswide,3,Tue Jul 21 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"To me it sounds like a diversification strategy more than anything. They can't risk putting all their eggs in the Mturk basket. I think they fully realized the incompetence of the Mturk staff when they initiated the fee hikes. On top of that, CS gets a whole new worker pool to tap into, which is crucial for growth.  Edit: On second thought and after looking at Upwork's fees (10% paid by worker), I would't be surprised if the goal is to inch people off Mturk over the next few months."
mturk,3e3p1n,celamer,2,Tue Jul 21 22:50:09 2015 UTC,"CrowdSurf Support isn't leaving AMT.   Q. When will all CrowdSurf tasks be available on Upwork? A. We plan to make CrowdSurf tasks available on Upwork by Friday July 24, 2015. Upwork will exist as a payment alternative, and CrowdSurf work will be available as normal on Mturk!"
mturk,3e3p1n,withanamelikesmucker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:56:11 2015 UTC,How do you know crowdsurf is one of them? They literally JUST consolidated to an mturk only platform and ditched their other site.
mturk,3e3p1n,blacktieaffair,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"It's still around. Their old setup was completely tied to Mturk. They completely re-did their backend and now Mturk is only an option to them now - so they can list work on other sites as well, potentially at better rates too if the rate setup is more favorable to them."
mturk,3e3p1n,tenmileswide,4,Tue Jul 21 21:50:27 2015 UTC,What will probably happen is Requesters will pay less for their surveys. This is a rather large leap in what they're asking Requesters so I believe it will have a negative effect.
mturk,3e3p1n,MehraMilo,5,Tue Jul 21 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"What will probably happen is Requesters will pay less for their surveys.   Bingo.

mturk,3e3p1n,randomoaf,4,Tue Jul 21 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"It's not that /u/SkyeRaven wants to pretend there's not a problem. It's that it's a dick-measuring, ego-boosting thing to claim you're not worried. It's like saying ""let them eat cake"", you're so good you're above the teeming masses of starving noobs.  I'm not even trying to be insulting. It's a thing I've observed in many other ways, not just on Mturk. Back in the day I used to make my living off RMT (real money trading), AKA selling video game items for money. In Diablo 3 there was an auction house in-game where you could sell your items for IRL money. People liked to post their screenshots to make others jealous and constantly claimed that everything was fine on their end, even as the game's economy was sinking faster than the Titanic.  I think this is just something that comes with the territory when there's a lot of money on the line and a lot of creativity required to make it. Plus, as someone (I think it was Tribune) once said, some people work online because they are unemployable, not merely unemployed."

mturk,3e3p1n,earnonlineaccount,4,Tue Jul 21 22:54:46 2015 UTC,"Requesters will either A) pay less for surveys or B) have less surveys.  I've seen requesters saying they'll go with the latter but I've also seen that they are seeking other options outside of Mturk.    Keep in mind that Mturk is not comprised entirely of surveys so batches (the ones that pull the most money) are also affected.   Like Ten said, two of the biggest requesters (who happen to also be batch) have already left or will leave.  People keep writing it off but this is not like video games.  People (both requesters and workers) leaving is actually a big deal.  You don't want anybody to leave. You want more to come in so they will provide competition for our attention and our labor. That means more money for us. The problem is that I see people treating this like a game. Where they are reacting to people and requesters leaving as if they quit an MMO."

mturk,3e3p1n,QnA,3,Tue Jul 21 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"The next week or so is bound to yield more information about any significant pay changes.  A couple of requesters have planned their migration for today and tomorrow. Hopefully everyone knows about this already.  I've been compiling information and writing a little about this stuff because I like to suss out the big picture of the whole mechanical workplace movement. Plus, information helps requesters and workers stay empowered in a workplace where they are the ones doing the paying and working.  Briefly, if things don't go well enough, Microworkers, Crowdflower and possibly Clickworkers are current sites staying in the game. If anyone is really that concerned, I'm happy to communicate via PM about other alternatives. I don't want to post more here about things non-mturk. You could also just look at some of my post history.  Good luck, folks!"
mturk,3e3p1n,earnonlineaccount,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"Crowdflower left AMT when it was caught out screwing workers out of money. They were also notoriously underpaid, so underpaid the best service they provided was a captcha return. Also, it costs $150K to get into Crowdflower's game. Don't Microworkers and Clickworkers charge workers? I may mistaken, but I don't think so. If I'm right (and maybe not) workers should certainly consider how much it costs them to work for either one of those companies."
mturk,3e3p1n,POSMStudios,4,Tue Jul 21 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  Crowdflower was my top requester in 2013 in terms of earnings made. If you cherry picked their HITs you could make a lot of money off them, especially because, due to their bad reputation, many other turkers stayed away. They had a few batches that were like a goldmine and I regularly made $20 a day just from cherry picking the good stuff. It's true that most of their work was absolute garbage, and it's also true that their platform was fussy and whimsical at best, but to say that the best service they provided was captcha returns is a little wrong.  On the other hand I've heard there is nothing good about Crowdflower nowadays and that they dropped pay substantially once they left. I expect Crowdsource to do the same. Remember that these websites do not have restrictions against non-American workers the way Mturk does. You will be competing against people who will do what you do for a fraction of what you'll work for. The fact that many of them do not speak English is not as important as the cost-cutting involved in utilizing their work. This is not a slight against Indian crowdsourcers (I know of one who has masters and speaks better English than most Americans, even), just the cold hard reality of life in a global environment."
mturk,3e3p1n,lolowalsh,3,Tue Jul 21 21:00:43 2015 UTC,"Crowdflower is so bad, there's an ongoing class action lawsuit against them.  http://peoplesworld.org/sub-minimum-wage-internet-employer-loses-round-one-in-federal-court/"
mturk,3e3p1n,mans0n2,2,Tue Jul 21 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"There's a research paper from a couple of months ago where some folks at Carnagie Melon University write about testing out a few sites. They apparently didn't have to pay that fee for Crowdflower in order to do 200 surveys. Apparently they paid considerably less than $800 for 200 surveys at CF.  Microworkers is going to beat mturk's new fees by several percentage points, even after the withdrawal fee. Clickworker has no worker cash-out fee."

This is a significant increase in overhead, especially for high volume requesters like Speechpad.  Speechpad has expressed concern to Amazon at this significant price increase but Amazon did not leave any room for negotiation.  Unfortunately, in order to keep our HITs available on MTurk, Speechpad and other requesters have been forced to reduce the payout to MTurk workers in order to offset the increased cost.  We regret having to make this change, but we do not have another viable alternative. If you have any questions or concerns about the price increase, feel free to contact MTurk.  The Speechpad Team"

They'll definitely be some people who lower their pay, so there will be more people to avoid.  That said, I think mturk will be just fine..the excellent requesters will more than likely remain excellent requesters, you don't build rapport with people just to fuck it all up.

When the rate change isn't just a minor change but actually quadruples it isn't something that can just be adjusted for by taking out one or two surveys. I really fear that this is gonna make it even more of a sweatshop pay grade then some of the work is now on mturk.  Luckily a lot of the larger crowdsource requesters are setting up their own sites now, and the few that I have personally spoken to about it seem really committed to getting fair wages for workers and fair costs to requesters so who knows, the rate change may end up being the best thing for  us lol."

Clear, concise, with full sentences and no assumption workers will ""get the gist"" or knows requester's work as well as requesters do.  Instructions that I can either hide or open in another page/tab so I don't have to scroll past a wall of text to get to the actual work.  Examples are always nice.   Communication.   A text box inside of the HIT for comments is always nice. If I had to make a decision that the requester might question, I prefer the option of explaining myself instead of having to go through the email to-and-fro and waiting for a rejection to be reversed.   Requesters who learn the platform, from a worker point of view.   Amazon doesn't give us many tools to work with and I don't believe requesters know that. Make a worker account and have a look at what we have to work with. Better yet, make a worker account and spend some time trying to work through HITs. Experience is invaluable.   Money.   Now, we aren't all doing this during our down time at work. No, we aren't all doing this to earn a Big Mac meal or beer money. We're real people with real bills and we eat real food. I appreciate requesters who understand this and compensate accordingly.  I also appreciate requesters who recognize that workers have transferable workplace skills - particularly computer skills - and are capable of much more than pressing a button with a picture on a register in a fast food place.  I have no - zip, zero, zilch - appreciation for requesters who reduce the compensation for their work until they fall into the ""cheap penny requester"" category.  Thanks for asking. :)"

mturk,3e0dw5,stephersms,3,Tue Jul 21 05:13:13 2015 UTC,I'm happy you brought that up about the table. I remember one that was very specific about a certain spot on a bench and it made me wonder if only part of the bench was highlighted in the original task. I worried about a rejection for myself on it hoping I got the spot just right. It bothers me to think someone may have been rejected because I didn't click exactly right in a very small spot.

Let's say I take 100 surveys and 20 of them are similar (randomly spread throughout). Of those 20, if my answers on the 20th are biased to the 1st, how does that NOT validate the data? If my answers on the 1st are different than the 20th, one of them is inherently invalid...  As a survey taker myself, I would bet anything if I did Survey X last July and never saw it again until right now, there would be no significant difference in my answers. Of course, I could always have an experience that completely changes my personality during said period, but it's unlikely, and that's true for most people. Plus, even it did happen, it's irrelevant, because the responses would just mold and form a new bias that is just as valid as the first.  Summary & main argument: Bias validates data. If no bias is present in two similar studies, one of them is inherently invalid*.  Edit: *The closer the studies are in time, the more true this is."

Let say you are doing a batch and constantly have to select yes or no and then move your mouse to the submit button and click on it. This eats time. So...sometimes, you can use a script which gives you hot keys. Then you can simply press 1 for yes, 2 for no, and hit enter to submit.

mturk,3e00jb,MartyMcfly6,3,Tue Jul 21 06:44:13 2015 UTC,"By the time a HIT gets posted over on HWTF, it's been up for grabs on MTurk for seconds, minutes, or longer which is plenty of time for other workers to grab it up. HITs are often gone within seconds if they're good."
mturk,3e00jb,electr0lyte,3,Mon Jul 20 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"we are a fast pack of savages. only the quick and cunning will eat. nah seriously, we have no idea how long a hit is going to be active for when we post it on hwtf. when you see something you grab it the second its up"
mturk,3e00jb,MartyMcfly6,2,Tue Jul 21 06:43:52 2015 UTC,yes
mturk,3dyxzv,lookimtalking,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:08 2015 UTC,pretty spiffy - you should at least add a 'donate' button =)  question: does the 'last updated' time only change when a new hit is found?  Im having a hard time 'seeing' if its running or not - last updated was over 7 minutes ago at time of this writing
mturk,3dyxzv,jqkill,3,Mon Jul 20 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yes 'last updated' only updates when new hits are found. Since it's driven off the forums, hits usually become scarce towards the end of day and on the weekends.  Feel free to checkout mturkforum, you can see if a new hit is posted. (But if the same hit has been posted previously (within an hour, it won't update because it will be considered as a duplicate)"
mturk,3dyxzv,Tjololo,3,Mon Jul 20 22:51:53 2015 UTC,Pretty neat. Do you plan to expand this to other sites or just MTF?
mturk,3dyxzv,Tjololo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"I actually just heard of mturkgrind today, so that's a possibility.  I'm a big fan btw, I think your scripts are awesome."
mturk,3dyxzv,Tjololo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! MTG is similar, but their site design is different. I was working on a similar project to this one written in python. MTG's site design looks similar to MTF's, but the underlying HTML is definitely different. I don't know if you'll be able to just plug in the new URL and start scraping, it'll probably need some tweaks.  Might think of adding turkernation.com's daily hit threads as well, then you'd have a comprehensive list of the 3 main forums. Add a reddit feed, and you'd create the perfect lurker paradise.  As a comment: This might have some negative ramifications if you start combining all the forums/etc hits in one site. You might think about restricting access to only certain people or something. I don't know how it would best be done, but if this is just public, you're going to get a TON of traffic of non-sharing lurkers, which might cause problems with hits being snatched too quickly.  An alternative, that might work out a little better, is to put a 30s delay on the posts or something. That way the people who frequent the forums/communities have a chance to get their hits in before released to ""the masses"" so to speak.  Still, love the idea! I'm interested to see how it ends up. Great work!"
mturk,3dyxzv,celamer,4,Mon Jul 20 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is already a delay ~ 1min. I have a service running every minute. I see your point about hits being snatched too quickly by non-sharing lurckers. I can add more delay to it. I'll play around with it , I definitely want to give actual turkers first dibs.  I see the negative reaction on mturk. I didn't think the response was going to be like this. :("
mturk,3dyxzv,jqkill,5,Mon Jul 20 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, people are always touchy when it comes to hits. It's kinda silly in my opinion, it's like people think the forum is some super secret hit haven lol. It's open to the public, there's tons of non-contributing lurkers there every day, this doesn't do anything different.  Honestly, people were more than happy to have a script that removes every post that doesn't contain a hit, and MTG has ""grind mode"" that does the same thing...This doesn't do anything different. If you want the conversation, you'll be in the thread conversing. If you don't want the conversation, you aren't really going to be contributing hits anyway most of the time.  You're gonna get backlash for it, especially if it gets popular. Eventually it'll die down though, as it becomes part of turk life. Hit Scraper got similar backlash IIRC, with people refusing to use it. now it's just a part of life. This will probably be the same.  A word of advice though, you could probably charge for this and people would pay it, but I would suggest if that becomes the method you're going, I'd just remove it altogether or just use it yourself. That would NOT go over well for you or anyone else."
mturk,3dyxzv,clickhappier,5,Mon Jul 20 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"My goal was just to have it up and running lol and see the amount of traffic I get in Google analytic.  I don't need money for this site, the only thing I'm paying now is the domain name which is like 9 bucks a year. I'm using a free hosting company right now. (I don't think it can handle many traffic but it works right now)  I appreciate the support. :)"

I ran into this while looking for a different script and have never got rid of it because I use to constantly start work and forget to hit accept, but since I installed it I haven't done it again even once.   For those of you who haven't seen the script before it automatically changes the background color of any hit that hasn't been accepted to a light red so you know that you need to accept it."

mturk,3dv7jn,Rizzpooch,7,Sun Jul 19 20:10:11 2015 UTC,just keep trying to outdo yourself..congrats
mturk,3dv7jn,MartyMcfly6,4,Sun Jul 19 23:13:04 2015 UTC,"Well done.  I just submitted my first HIT today. It is a bit intimidating because the instructions are not very clear, but I think with time I will get the hang of things."
mturk,3dv7jn,DewSchnozzle,4,Mon Jul 20 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Keep at it. It gets much much better the more you do it. I'm at a year and a half (just about) and hit $2000 a few days ago. Not too much in the grand scheme of things, but at this point I have lots of fun making extra money. Good luck!"
mturk,3dv7jn,the_dude42,3,Mon Jul 20 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"ok, i'll bite. as a dude averaging about $20 clams a week, I gotta ask, what is your secret?"
mturk,3dv7jn,the_dude42,4,Sun Jul 19 20:14:08 2015 UTC,Not much of a secret. I've just been lucky to have a very slow week at work this week and pretty much nothing going on in the evenings. I really pushed myself and kept wanting to top my previous days' totals. Reddit and HitScraper both helped a lot :)
mturk,3dv7jn,Alex470,2,Sun Jul 19 20:18:08 2015 UTC,"i use both of those as well. how many approved do you have, and is there any requester that you do batches for?"
mturk,3dv7jn,thewebsiteguy,5,Sun Jul 19 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"Just got 8200 approved! I always search for Sticky, Agent Agent, and Pickfu. Back when I needed to get my numbers up, I'd do lots of one-cent batches (anything that approved quickly). It helped a lot and now I can be more discriminating. It definitely gets easier over time!"
mturk,3dv7jn,Raynii24,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:13 2015 UTC,"See, I usually pull in $35 to $45 a week on average, and that's usually sticking to /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor and the grind threads for surveys. I'll typically stick to HITscraper for batch work. I tried using turkmaster as well, but it seems like most of the surveys on there have terrible TOs, and when I do see a decent looking survey, it's already on HWTF anyway.   My question is, when you're working mturk like it's a job, do you focus on the good surveys, finish them, and then take the poor TO surveys while looking for batches or better paying surveys? I tend to skip most anything with a poor TO just because I've had a few experiences with 25 minute surveys paying like 0.35. I suppose I'm just struggling with the concept of making anything more than $50 a week. If it helps, I'm around 3k approved and have one whole rejection."
mturk,3dv7jn,itsjustjibe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:36 2015 UTC,I definitely skip anything that isn't green on hitscraper. I agree it's just not worth it. I think I just got lucky to hit some big bonuses and payouts this week. That and having much more free time to devote. It was just a combination of good stuff. Keep at it!
mturk,3dv7jn,kimadagem,3,Mon Jul 20 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Alright. I have been turking for about 40 days now I'd say. I have managed to make about $800 so far. The best advice I can give is to treat it like a job the first 2 weeks, and start using scripts, forums, blogs, etc. Just get involved. You will be amazed what 15 minutes of googling can uncover. Congrats btw OP."
mturk,3dv7jn,Strigas,2,Mon Jul 20 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's definitely more of a hobby for me than an actual job, but it's become a rather lucrative one! Congrats to you - that's a hell of a start"
mturk,3dv7jn,jdinger29,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"that's pretty impressive for the both of you, I've only made 20$ in 10 days :("

mturk,3dvgac,itsbecca,2,Sun Jul 19 22:44:18 2015 UTC,"TBF both of those are specifically about grind batches to get your numbers up. OP sounds like he's interested in work that pays.

mturk,3dvgac,clickhappier,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:23 2015 UTC,"The stuff available in large quantities that actually pays well never lasts long, and there isn't much I'm aware of that opens up at 1000 specifically except a larger range of surveys."
mturk,3dv0aa,abhyphensoul,10,Sun Jul 19 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"I just just just posted that I've now made over $100/week for the first time in a year and a half. This summer has given me more time to work on turking, but the short answer is that it definitely does get easier. Not only are more HITs open to you, but you might also become more attune to what you should and should not be doing. Additionally, you get numb to the boiler-plate psych questions - it takes 47 days to cover half the lake in lilypads; the ball costs 5 cents; I strongly disagree with the statement ""sometimes I think I am no good at all"" etc.  Keep at it. If you eventually find yourself addicted to it like some of us, it actually becomes quite easy to make $15-25 a day"
mturk,3dv0aa,Rizzpooch,4,Sun Jul 19 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the bat costs 1.05 and the lily pad sometimes only takes 46 days. I've seen a few of those variations.   Also, I don't think some groups need to be stepped on and I believe I am on an equal plane to others.  Also where are these people buying bats and baseballs?

mturk,3dv0aa,clickhappier,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:06 2015 UTC,"Having good approval rate and high number of approved HITs definitely helps. Also being lucky and diligent in looking for new HITs.

mturk,3dv0aa,Christypaints,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:21 2015 UTC,how long do you turk each week to get to this goal?
mturk,3dv0aa,itsjustjibe,3,Sun Jul 19 22:05:50 2015 UTC,About 4-5 hours per day usually.
mturk,3dv0aa,Strigas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:07 2015 UTC,Dang I really wish I was making that much and only working that little heh (little in comparison to how long Im' working to earn 1/3-1/4 of the money lol)   Do you mainly earn so much through private batches or something?
mturk,3dv0aa,Gaffots,4,Mon Jul 20 02:37:06 2015 UTC,"People lie about how much they work/ get paid, unless you have some lucrative closed qual you aren't going to be making 3-400 a week at 4-5 hours a day.  5 hours x 7 days= 35 hours, so to make $350 and you'd have to average $10 an hour."
mturk,3dv0aa,itsjustjibe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"A couple requesters I work for have set up quals that only limited people can work on, but no not most of them. I do a combination of surveys and batches."
mturk,3dv0aa,kadauchi,3,Mon Jul 20 15:34:55 2015 UTC,The approved milestones help since the allow you work on more things but the biggest thing to increasing your earnings is experience.

mturk,3dw9ou,notablackmamba,4,Mon Jul 20 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"This has been asked before. Here is the agreed-upon answer: For your first ten days of active turking, you're limited to 100 HITs (including returns and abandons). After that, as you know, it jumps to 3,800 per day. Since you mentioned being inactive an entire day, that won't count as part of your first 10 days."

mturk,3ds7o0,rosie_the_redditor,3,Sun Jul 19 16:55:39 2015 UTC,Not up much recently but if you have a Mic and ever see Project Endor (Jamelio) HITs up do those as much as it will let you.  Guaranteed approvals and take like 5 to 10 second a pop.
mturk,3ds7o0,MidgardDragon,3,Sun Jul 19 00:40:20 2015 UTC,"These are good newbie hits and oldies, and also many do them when things are slow on Turk. Only 2c each but they go quick and after 13,000 hits with them never one rejection I adverage about three a munite and two is easy for begining. And yes I have made at least a dozen foul ups. They will take away a quality but you will keep the rest before they reject. Thats gospel. They do not post in batches and you have to qualify for each category but it,s fast and easy. HINT, when qualifying listen to each one first ( there are three of each category, when I did them)  then begin to answer and submit. It just helps to know what they want and look for. They put up over hundreds of hit per day. If this link works try it. https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups&searchWords=Bunny+Inc&minReward=0.00&x=16&y=13  should get you to the hits and qualifying page. For best work use Headphones they even ask that you do or you will miss out on certain subtle sounds. They will not reject you though.

For this instance specifically just write p9r they explain what you did wrong or let you know it was a system error and reverse it.   In the long run rejections are not that big a deal in singles. It's when they come in 20's and 40's and 100's that they really sting. (Monetarily anyway. Once you've built a good padding they won't ding your approval unless you hit a couple thousand (ore more) rejects) Also, you're gonna get rejections for things you didn't do wrong, it's just mTurk life,  however you're also gonna skate by and not get rejections you should have due to quick AA or just an overly nice requester, it all evens out."

mturk,3dsaff,ambyrjayde,2,Sun Jul 19 10:45:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I got a reply from them and they reversed the rejection, so that was nice. Apparently I missed a dash in the punctuation of one of the hits. I remember that all the ones I was doing were crappy bordering on illegible penny hits to grind up to 1000, so I very well may have missed a dash, but I'm betting it was on one of the hits where I could barely read half of it anyways.   So, the outcome was favorable this time. Now that I'm done with the grind up to 1000, I can stay away from their hits for a while and look for better paying work :-)"

mturk,3dro0a,MartyMcfly6,2,Sat Jul 18 23:56:24 2015 UTC,Eyeapps (5 cents) and AKCrowd (3 cents + possible 2 cent bonus) both usually have sizable batches up.
mturk,3dro0a,internet_enthusiast,2,Sun Jul 19 02:29:50 2015 UTC,Thank you so much!!  Gonna give them a try.
mturk,3dro0a,MeltingGlacier,0,Sun Jul 19 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"/screenshotted your post, Turk life represent!"
mturk,3dro0a,AlanIaningram,2,Sun Jul 19 17:44:27 2015 UTC,What does the scouter say about Blushingapple's Mturk approval level? IT'S OVER 9000! sorry I just had to.
mturk,3dro0a,internet_enthusiast,2,Sun Jul 19 09:32:15 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, let me in on the joke?  I haven't heard of this before!  :o)"
mturk,3dro0a,MeltingGlacier,2,Sun Jul 19 14:59:39 2015 UTC,It's a Dragonball Z reference
mturk,3dro0a,AlanIaningram,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"Uh oh...  are you familiar with Dragon Ball Z?  You could search YouTube for 'over 9000' if you're down for some cheesy campy 90's anime voice acting.  I won't provide the link, you need to take some initiative and do a search if you want to subject yourself to such a thing, haha!    On topic, I kinda don't like ProBoards as much as when I first found them (the lady got a few rejections for not erring on the side of flagging).  I have the PandA, but rarely poke it.  I'm gonna paraphrase a post of mine from day ago-  Req name: MyLikes -- One-click submit. ""Porn"" or ""Safe"" decision on one image, no rejects over ~150-ish submissions. PandA here:  https://www.mturk.com/mturk/previewandaccept?groupId=3EGCY5R6XY0PS57S4R2H1KZW7LSAYC  Req: Ben Peterson -- 3-question rating on social media profile pictures. Instructions are quick and clear. Ben Peterson has been good to me so far as well, you might recognize his 'Rate dating profiles! ([Age range] [Male/Females] Only)"" kind of hits. You'll have to hammer his req name in a search and find the HIT that applies to you, for those. Very similar, but these soc media ones have no gender/age reqs. PandA should be this guy here:  https://www.mturk.com/mturk/previewandaccept?groupId=3D8AITOIIKLLGNE1Z4F7BADEO0SIU3  It's not much, and you probably already know them, but maybe they can help someone else!  And lol, I just had 6 MyLikes pop while running these 3 (two from Ben)...  and 6 more while revising!  Crap, 3 more... no..  7...  9..  uhh...okay, 14 just popped, that's a new record!  Lol.  Good luck on hitting 10k, I gotta send and watch my queue harder haha!"

mturk,3dmo3m,sly9377,5,Fri Jul 17 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"Yes there is.  On the dashboard page, the middle table which is called ""Your HIT Status"" lists the past 5 dates.  You can click each day, and manually go through all the HITs you've done.  There is also at the bottom of that table a link that says, ""View more...""  That will show you a list of the past 45 days, which you can click on and go through manually.    Of course the official way is not searchable, and seperated by days instead of one big list, and only goes back to the past 45 days.  So it is a huge pain in the butt.    What you really want is Mturk HIT Database https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/864-mturk-hit-database    As long as you remember to update your HIT DB it will remember all of the HITs you've done, and is searchable.  That version only works with Google Chrome, due to the way it uses popup new tabs to show results.  Well it does work with Firefox as far as creating the database, but the only thing you can do to view the results is check ""export csv"" and view them in Excel or some spreadsheet program."
mturk,3dmo3m,jeff0jefferson,2,Fri Jul 17 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"Hit DB in Firefox (and in Chrome) does add little letter icons on the hit listing pages. ""R"" is for Requester and ""T"" is for title (of the hit). If ""R"" is pink it means you haven't submitted any hits for that requester and if it's green it means you have. If ""T"" is pink it means you haven't done any hits with that exact title, for anyone; if it's green it means you have. If one of those letters is green and you're using Chrome you can click on the letter and get a separate page/tab with a list of all the hits you've done for that requester/with that title. That's the part that doesn't work in Firefox; if you try to do that in FF you just get a blank page. But the green letters can at least give you a clue about what you have and haven't done."
mturk,3dmo3m,kimadagem,2,Fri Jul 17 22:32:24 2015 UTC,Excellent point.  I forgot about those.
mturk,3dmo3m,jeff0jefferson,2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:49 2015 UTC,Mturk will keep track of the last 45 days worth of HITs completed and requesters worked for.  Past that you'll have to keep your own records.  Many people use a script called HIT Database for this purpose; I consider it an essential script for all turkers.  In addition to keeping track of your HITs completed it also has a nifty feature that calculates your projected daily earnings as well as your total pending earnings from all unnapproved HITs.
mturk,3dmo3m,internet_enthusiast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:22:03 2015 UTC,"I installed HIT database awhile ago but it doesn't do anything, just says ""script monkeys are picking bananas"" whenever I've tried to interact with it."
mturk,3dmo3m,franticantelope,3,Fri Jul 17 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"Hit Database broke awhile ago (I want to say a month, but it may have been even longer), so if you installed it a couple months ago or more, you have a broken version that either needs to be fixed or completely reinstalled."
mturk,3dmo3m,auralgasm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"I installed it I think a month ago, and I've reinstalled it I think twice now. Does it have any conflicts with chrome maybe?"

mturk,3dmo3m,Tjololo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:47 2015 UTC,What does the script do? it sounds a little sketchy
mturk,3dmo3m,franticantelope,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:32:25 2015 UTC,It deletes the indexeddb object store so the hits script can remake it. It works in a lot of busted hitdb cases.

mturk,3djkg8,Dryuesnake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"99% of my hits are with CopyText Inc. The number of hours varies from day to day, anywhere from 3-6ish. However, I average about $7 an hour. What I do is transcribe about 1 or 2 rows on CopyText (nothing more because they dont always pay their bonuses so its not worth your time) going for sheer volume of hits. My method gives me about 2.5 cents per hit and I like it because it is fast and easy. I will often ""run out of hits"" and I just keep refreshing my page until more become available. It is a lot of clicking and it is very active but it makes me money and that is my number one goal."
mturk,3djkg8,MainTank,2,Thu Jul 16 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Are they pretty reliable as far as emails? Supposedly when I took their qual test I only got 78% (which I don't believe because it was super effing easy), so they disqualified me from their hits. I emailed them almost two weeks ago and no reply yet. Is it possible they're that busy and if so, do you think they'd be amenable to me retaking the qual test? Thanks in advance for reading :-)"
mturk,3djkg8,clickhappier,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"To be honest i'm not sure. I have never tried to email them directly. HOWEVER, i can definitely say they are reliable with their bonus emails. I had to move their bonus emails to a spam folder because I do a little over a thousand hits a day, therefore I get over s thousand emails."
mturk,3djkg8,MainTank,2,Thu Jul 16 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"HOWEVER, i can definitely say they are reliable with their bonus emails.   The requester isn't directly responsible for those emails... with a company that has an automated setup like this, those aren't an indication of how responsive they'll be to actual communication. Any time a bonus is issued, MTurk automatically sends you a notification email (that's the only way you find out details of your bonuses)."

mturk,3djkg8,MarinePrincePrime,2,Fri Jul 17 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try this tomorrow. $7 an hour would mean an average of 175 hits an hour but with how often you have to return hits because you've ""ran out of hits"" it might require 175 hits in like 45 minutes."
mturk,3djkg8,MarinePrincePrime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:16:52 2015 UTC,"wait, I have a Q, is this like a receipt transcription thing? You only do the first couple of rows and ignore the rest? How does that work? I do superrrr long receipt transcriptions and they take forever and i don't make much $$$ off of them"
mturk,3djkg8,Jinh0o,3,Thu Jul 16 21:26:17 2015 UTC,"I usually only do the first three rows precisely for that reason; everything else takes too long. Since with copytext there is no limit to the number of hits you can do and you are not required to do the whole thing (there is no penalty for leaving lines or sections blank, only for typing innacurately), I do the first three lines and then submit it and continue the process until I have done hundreds of hits."
mturk,3djkg8,Dryuesnake,3,Thu Jul 16 21:36:14 2015 UTC,Wow damn. I do the same hit but I do them all the way to completion for the bonus. I guess quantity of hits rules over quality in this case.   How much do you get for each line with your bonus?
mturk,3djkg8,Dryuesnake,3,Fri Jul 17 03:08:28 2015 UTC,I literally only do the first 3 lines which im pretty sure isnt supposed to qualify for a bonus but they give it anyway
mturk,3djkg8,optifrog,2,Fri Jul 17 03:19:09 2015 UTC,I have a quality score of 95 and get 0.005 per line for bonus. What do you get? I can't tell if 100 is the max or what but you've done more in a day than I've done in a week so yours ought to be higher if possible.
mturk,3djkg8,MainTank,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:13:22 2015 UTC,Nope I get the same as you
mturk,3djkg8,Natural_Flavors_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:58:24 2015 UTC,how long does the approval take? I still have mine sitting on pending
mturk,3djkg8,clickhappier,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:57:12 2015 UTC,"The first few hundred I do can take a while but once I really get going they are usually approved almost immediately, maybe within 10 minutes. But they are always all approved by the end of the day, for me at least."
mturk,3djkg8,Sabblesbox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:55:01 2015 UTC,At what level where you hitting 2.5 cents per hit? Was it after 500 completed hits? 1000?
mturk,3djkg8,Crustal_Math,3,Fri Jul 17 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"No sorry I should have clarified. The hits themselves are only worth a penny at every level, however, they almost always pay me a bonus of 1-2 cents even if I only complete one section. So the 2-3 cents per hit (hit plus bonus) usually averages out to 2.5 cents. So when I hit the 1,000 hit mark for the day i'm usually around $25"
mturk,3djkg8,FkinSteve,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:00:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Btw, I notice that they stop showing up later in the afternoon. What time do you suggest to usually work on Copytext for the most hits?"
mturk,3djkg8,jeff0jefferson,2,Sat Jul 18 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"I usually work on them periodically from 9-5. Its usually a little slow in the morning until about 10:30. From my experience, 11 am to about 3-4pm is the prime time (eastern standard time zone)"
mturk,3djkg8,4ndreas,2,Sat Jul 18 01:05:55 2015 UTC,Congrats! Good job.

mturk,3djkg8,howdoesthisworkagain,2,Thu Jul 16 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you a question, I've never had a reject from them, but the dang comma or period in the total price column always messes with me. Do you see a difference? Or do you just type them all one way? Sometimes I can swear I see 1.10 € but then others it definitely says 1,10 €"
mturk,3djkg8,4ndreas,2,Fri Jul 17 12:28:55 2015 UTC,"From my experience they are pretty lenient, usually both are acceptable. I only have a few rejections and from my memory they were completely arbitrary. I didnt protest because ive done so many hits that my hits approved is still 100%"
mturk,3djkg8,howdoesthisworkagain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:31:22 2015 UTC,"Your actual qual value is 99(%) once you've had even one rejection, fyi... the dashboard lies. Unimportant most of the time, at least. :-)"
mturk,3dk86g,Sapphoof,6,Thu Jul 16 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll break it down for ya.  The link to a HIT looks like this: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=LONGGROUPIDNUMBER    If you are at that preview page, and you click the accept button it sends you to a link that looks like this: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/accept?groupId=LONGGROUPIDNUMBER    Ok so if you check the box that says, ""Automatically accept the next HIT"" when you submit, it brings you to a link that looks like this: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/previewandaccept?groupId=LONGGROUPIDNUMBER    The ""previewandaccept"" page will accept another HIT every time that you refresh that page.  So what you can do is use a browser extension like RefreshEvery to refresh that page every X seconds, and it will accept that HIT every X seconds and fill up your queue.  Or you can keep that page refreshing if you are trying to catch a HIT that you think is about to be posted, like a really dank survey or zings or something.    Also note, if you know any of the links to the HIT, or even just the group ID#, you can make it into a PandA link by just changing it to previewandaccept yourself."
mturk,3dk86g,jeff0jefferson,5,Fri Jul 17 00:05:07 2015 UTC,"This sums it up very well.  The PAndA method is useful for ""catching"" HITs the may pop up at certain times.    I have a perfect example from early today.  Somebody posted a good HIT on /HWTF.  When I clicked the link, it took me to the ""search results"" page containing the HIT on mTurk.  When I clicked the link to view the HIT, it said there were no more HITs available.  So what did I do?  I updated the URL from 'preview' to 'previewandaccept', turned on my ""Easy Auto Refresh"" extension, and let it do its thing.    After about 5 minutes, I ""caught"" the HIT!"
mturk,3dk86g,Swiss__Cheese,2,Fri Jul 17 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"I'll add to this that there are a couple scripts you can use to make anything a panda easily.  https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/2431-preview-accept-and-hoard  This adds an ""Accept"" link next to the preview link so you don't have to actually hit preview and type anything.  https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5053-hit-return-accept  This one makes it so the checkbox is ALWAYS checked."
mturk,3dk86g,auralgasm,2,Fri Jul 17 19:16:39 2015 UTC,https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5053-hit-return-accept This one makes it so the checkbox is ALWAYS checked.    That's not the primary purpose of that script. I think you're thinking of https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/852-keep-autoaccept-box-checked
mturk,3dk86g,clickhappier,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:45:21 2015 UTC,"Ok so if you check the box that says, ""Automatically accept the next HIT"" when you submit, it brings you to a link that looks like this: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/previewandaccept?groupId=LONGGROUPIDNUMBER[3]   Actually, this adds &autoacceptenabled=true to the end of the url"
mturk,3dk86g,jqkill,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  Mturk does add a bunch of other query string gobbledegook depending on certain things.  I left all of the query string out except for ?groupID=XXX on purpose because it's messy and not needed for this explanation.  To be fair, the actual URLs would look like this:    Preview: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=XXXXXXXX    Accept clicked: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/accept?hitId=XXXXXXXX&prevHitSubmitted=false&prevRequester=XXXX&requesterId=XXXX&prevReward=USDXXXX&hitAutoAppDelayInSeconds=XXXX&groupId=XXXXXXXX&signature=XXXXXXXX%2Faccept.x=51&%2Faccept.y=8    Accept next checked: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/previewandaccept?prevRequester=XXXX&autoAcceptEnabled=true&hitId=XXXXXXXX&isPreviousIFrame=true&groupId=XXXXXXXX    Edit:  Also ""&autoAcceptEnabled=true"" is the part that keeps the box checked when you submit and the page reloads, I believe.  You need the previewandaccept to actually make it an auto-accepting link."
mturk,3dk86g,jeff0jefferson,6,Fri Jul 17 15:55:26 2015 UTC,Panda means Preview and Accept
mturk,3dk86g,Sic1337,3,Thu Jul 16 23:05:03 2015 UTC,"It's a term created by a really nifty turker, it's just short for Preview and Accept.   Used to everyone would say AA which would always get confused because there was ""Auto Accept"" and ""Auto Approve"""
mturk,3dk86g,ambyrjayde,2,Thu Jul 16 23:10:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have much time but I wanted to mention one aspect of the ""PandA game"" that really helps.  IMAGINE THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO AND PLEASE TAKE A FEW...  okay, sorry, let's get on with it:  You just saw a sweet survey HIT from HWTF/TM/HS/whatevs.  You check it and there's no HITs available, blech.  You have a PandA link handy, and throw it on the pile.  You do a bit of digging and notice there is a quick 3-question screener.  Take that PandA and crank it down to 2 seconds, because SOMEONE is getting screened out and will return.  Another quick example:  I saw a really nice HIT (slightly relevant: 'Attitudes about Marijuana' or similar was the title) with a 4-hour timer on it.  I set a PandA and started it off at 2 second intervals because it was the only one I had going.  After not catching it for 10 minutes, I didn't lose hope.  I calculated when I saw it pop and then how long 4 hours was from that time.  I made a note to run the PandA for 5 hours from original time it was posted..  and almost exactly at the 4 hour mark, I snapped that bitch UP.  I was pretty proud of that one.  And the reason?  Well, Turking stoners are likely to pick up a long-timer HIT and forget about it.  HAH!  :]  Anyway, I reaaaally gotta run out the door now.  Hope y'all find my post useful/entertaining.  Peace!"

mturk,3dj8mf,mtn00b,10,Thu Jul 16 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"I mean honestly $2 for ten minutes is pretty good pay, that alone will motivate a lot of people. And I think having a progress bar (if possible) helps as well."
mturk,3dj8mf,franticantelope,4,Thu Jul 16 19:08:34 2015 UTC,Progress bar is a good idea! Thank you!
mturk,3dj8mf,hitsworth,3,Thu Jul 16 22:12:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, definitely a progress bar! I think the pay alone will be enough motivation, as long as you are up front that the task is boring/repetitive."
mturk,3dj8mf,jeff0jefferson,6,Fri Jul 17 09:02:40 2015 UTC,"I've done some rather boring tasks for less.    I would rather see missing more than 10 in a row result in the study telling the participant that they have missed too many in a row, so the study can't continue and they must return the HIT.  I, and probably many turkers, would be reluctant to go into a task like this where the penalty for inaccuracy is a rejection.    I would think the prospect of flunking out of the study early would be motivation enough.  From what I know most turkers tend to put in a good-faith effort.  But if you want to offer a further incentive, you could offer a bonus to turkers who complete the task with 98% accuracy or better.  (or something along those lines)"
mturk,3dj8mf,earnonlineaccount,3,Thu Jul 16 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"This is a really good question. Motivation and boredom are two forces pulling against each other for anyone who doesn't truly enjoy the process of taking surveys.  $2 for 7-10 minutes juxtaposed to a rejection seems unecessarily polarized. Perhaps you could pay $1, with a $1 bonus for good responses, as well as a potential rejection for missing too many questions."
mturk,3dj8mf,Tazz2212,3,Thu Jul 16 19:23:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, I guarantee no one enjoys doing this. It's not something I can really gameify without compromising the actual research question. I like the idea of bonuses, though!"
mturk,3dj8mf,perk4pat,2,Thu Jul 16 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"What some surveys do is throw questions randomly throughout the survey telling the survey taker to select a certain answer.  Make it clear in preliminary instructions that you are expecting correct responses to some of the questions or the survey is null. This will ""help"" weed out the bored person who just pushes buttons."
mturk,3dj8mf,verifiedshitlord,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"I love this idea. Unfortunately, it's not exactly a survey that we're doing. It's more of a cognitive task. So things appear on the screen at set times and workers are expected to make a response on their keyboards. We look at accuracy and reaction times. Catch questions in the middle of the task would likely screw that up. But if I ever do a survey-based project, I will definitely include those types of questions!"
mturk,3dj8mf,andThatsHowiBeatShaq,2,Thu Jul 16 22:15:06 2015 UTC,"We look at accuracy and reaction times.    Are you using Inquisit? If so, inform people upfront -- before they accept the HIT.  Some people refuse to do a HIT with Inquisit."

mturk,3dicam,clickhappier,3,Thu Jul 16 14:48:45 2015 UTC,"After reading /u/Turil 's theory, I think the problem is most likely with people not paying close enough attention (myself included). Couple that with the threats made, it led a lot of people to blow up his TO the first time this hit appeared. It looks like a lot of people changed their rating after being approved though."
mturk,3dicam,turks24,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"I think the problem was that there was information overload, and that to really understand everything that the requester ""wanted"" us to do (to get paid) would have taken a lot more attention than most folks are willing to put in for below or even at minimum wage. :-)  Plus, of course, the fact that most psych studies are about the range of human behavior, not about getting people to follow directions ""perfectly""."
mturk,3dicam,turks24,3,Thu Jul 16 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think the only way to do this hit properly (assuming we are correct in what it's testing) would be to have a timer on the pages to make sure people read everything involved. Of course most of us would have returned the hit at that point.   I think most turkers try to do good work but theres an obvious balance between good work and the time:pay ratio. If you throw walls of text at people their attention starts to shift more towards getting the hit finished in a reasonable amount of time.   Put a timer on pages, adjust the pay to a fair amount for the time involved, and I bet you get drastically different results."

mturk,3dfno7,carbonx,3,Thu Jul 16 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"Its really not. I have been doing mturk for like a month a half now and I have reached almost 800 hits in a day. You just have to keep your ear to the ground and get involved with some of the forums/communities that are available. Then you will be a lot more informed as to when the best batches go up. They go super fast so you gotta be on it. I made like $30 last week literally hitting the number 1 key and enter as fast as I could for about 2 hours. (with small breaks in between). You also got look into scripts. Not hit scraper, or database scripts, Im talking user scripts that are specific to the hit. those will make completing hits much faster."
mturk,3dfno7,thewebsiteguy,0,Thu Jul 16 03:31:58 2015 UTC,The scripts complete the questionnaires for you?

mturk,3dgqhn,killaklam,10,Thu Jul 16 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"The important factor is what the pay is relative to the amount of time it takes, not just a high-looking total pay number regardless of the time...   Most of the higher-total-pay HITs are writing and audio transcription, types of work which definitely aren't for everyone. You have to pass each requester's particular tests to get access to them."
mturk,3dgqhn,clickhappier,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:02 2015 UTC,"You might not have to take a test for CastingWords, I think you request it and it's granted at 80 which allows you to do your first one, then it gets graded and you usually go down to a 79 which means you can't do anymore until you read the feedback and contact them and let them know you understand where you went wrong. Even the edit ones where you correct the ones somebody else did doesn't have a test. I don't think. You request it, start at 80, and then work your way up, at 85 you go do higher paying ones, at 90 I think you can do some different ones and at 95 you can do expedited ones which usually pay even more."
mturk,3dgqhn,pwicca,3,Thu Jul 16 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"That would depend on what HITs are being offered, and what the requirements are. Some requirements are for 10,000 approved and above, though a more common requirement is 1,000 approved and above. One thing you could do is a lot of easy and fast HITs to get your numbers up so if a good HIT that has a relatively high requirement is posted you can do it. But there really is no guarantee that the HITs with higher requirements will pay more than the ones with lower requirements, though it is better to be able to take the higher qualification HITs than not, obviously, almost always."

mturk,3darl9,DonaldFrumpp,2,Wed Jul 15 07:35:04 2015 UTC,Nobody on the subreddit respects the NDA. Everyone talks about the content of HITs and complains about the people in them. It would be too much work and create too much ill will if the moderators banned everyone on the sub who made a post or comment violating the NDA. That's my best guess for why they decided to go this route.
mturk,3darl9,nomagicinthehalls,6,Tue Jul 14 22:45:56 2015 UTC,"That would make sense. But I can't help but think they also want to have some control over our free speech too.

On the right side of the hit is a link for Request this qual. They will also need to have an opening for new Ibotta quals. Everytime I look in my quals, Ibotta is assigned to 850-900 people.

mturk,3dab1l,clickhappier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"As I said, it is a matter of supply and demand. There are too many people all trying to grab 2000 a day of those easy ones, more than the supply can sustain."
mturk,3dab1l,ImTurking_GoAway,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:06:12 2015 UTC,There are no more people than usual. There are always 850-900 people with the Ibotta qual. Always. So it is not the demand that is the problem. The problem is a drastic drop in supply.

mturk,3d7vsp,m-barts,3,Tue Jul 14 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"If you collected their IDs as part of the survey, you could give them a custom qualification that may bring some of them back to you (make the name something like Take Hit For Compensation or something, and put up a hit for them to accept), but otherwise, probably not, unless they contacted you."
mturk,3d7vsp,iamralph,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:11:26 2015 UTC,They were actually all assigned a custom qualification for taking part. So I can only direct them toward a custom qualification compensation hit if they contact me?
mturk,3d7vsp,iamralph,2,Tue Jul 14 05:32:43 2015 UTC,"well if you know who they are you could and post that it's for the workers on that list, a new qual would be more likely to catch their attention (it sends an email) but you might either way since you originally gave them the qual.  The risk with using the same qualification is you may have to reject someone dishonest who doesn't read that the hit is not for them  / completed the other hit and you may not reach the whole audience you want.   Those risks are minimal I'd say though.    If you don't know their IDs then yea they have to contact you, otherwise you could contact them via assigning a custom qual and hoping they look into it, which most probably would.  There is no way to initiate the conversation as far as I know, most likely a measure to avoid spam/scams but it does have a side-effect of being inconvenient."
mturk,3d7vsp,lostoompa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:35:40 2015 UTC,I don't know who they are though. Is there any way I can see the ID of everyone that received the custom qualification? The test should have only accepted a maximum of 48 workers but somehow the qualification has been assigned to 161 workers?
mturk,3d7vsp,lostoompa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"On the requester page, try going to     manage>>workers>>download csv    That should give you a list of all the workers with the qualification."
mturk,3d7vsp,Christypaints,2,Tue Jul 14 06:14:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I initially thought, not working though. Only tells me the workers who completed the test and got the qualification - and these guys have already been paid."
mturk,3d7vsp,pwicca,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:10:51 2015 UTC,"Without their IDs, it's gonna be tough. Just gotta wait for them to contact you. Although at this point, I don't think any will if they haven't already. Usually when I have trouble with a hit, I contact the requester right away.   I would discourage creating a compensation hit without their IDs.  Maybe in your final run, on the last page or so, you could create a multiple choice yes/no question asking whether the worker had done the hit before and was unable to complete it. Leave a comment box as well. Assure them that it will not affect their compensation. When you get your results, you can look up who answered yes and bonus them for the time spent on the trial version."
mturk,3d7vsp,lostoompa,3,Tue Jul 14 07:45:54 2015 UTC,I've got a few emails so for the time being I think I'll just pay these guys and take the whole ordeal as a bit of a learning experience. Unfortunately it's probably the first of many as I try to get the experiment off the ground - but from here on I'll be sure to create a more robust workflow to account for these situations.    Thanks for the advice everyone.
mturk,3d7vsp,clickhappier,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:37:36 2015 UTC,I think that's a really reasonable way to deal with it.
mturk,3d7jyi,BakingShoe,4,Tue Jul 14 03:18:29 2015 UTC,"It is a basic explanation, but it can come down to just that.  Firstly, the big question is what you want to transcribe. The three big transcription requesters on Mturk are CastingWords, SpeechInk and Crowdsurf (there's also ClariTrans, but they are known for blocks, so I wouldn't even consider them.)  Crowdsurf is easily the most entry-level of the Big Three. You have to pass their qual test to do them. Back when I first passed it, it never allowed retakes if you failed, but that might have changed. They recently simplified their guidelines to make transcription formats easier, too. The pay is really bad (and continually getting worse) unless you do hundreds of their HITs a week, in which case it can be decent. However, they have a really easy-to-use platform which provides slowdown and some nifty tools you can use.  I don't know much about SpeechInk and Castingwords. I know someone on one of the forums makes bank with SpeechInk using a speech-to-text program, but I have never used one and can't really say anything about that. Those two are far more byzantine than Crowdsurf and their pay is also bad unless you're really, really good. I wouldn't recommend them for newcomers.  Then there's random transcriptions that pop up and disappear throughout the day. Many of these are no-TO requesters posting one-off projects onto Mturk, not regular requesters, so you can't expect them. Most of these are awful pay, but some of them are amazing. These are the best way to learn how to transcribe, but you'll have to catch them, and I can say right now it would be really hard to grab any good ones. Still, if you just want to practice, you could try a few of them.  The biggest tip I can give a new transcriber is SLOW DOWN THE AUDIO. Don't try to transcribe it at normal speeds. Slow it down to the point where you're not having to go back over and over again to absorb what was said. It should be slow enough that you can type almost continually and aren't wasting time backing up into the audio, but not so slow that you start to type slowly too. You should be working at a fast pace.  And practice your typing skills. There are plenty of places on the internet where you can learn to type faster."

Not the same company, but basically identical tasks in regard to length, base pay, and scoring. The bonuses (both volume and variable depending on length) are what make Crowdsurf a good requester to work for and make it feasible for people to only do their HITs instead of doing higher paying surveys that take the same amount of time as 20 of their transcription HITs."

mturk,3d7jyi,auralgasm,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:46 2015 UTC,"The most important thing to know if you're new to transcribing is that almost all employers who ask for transcribing have guidelines that are very important to follow consistently. Do they want you to type the disfluencies (ums, uhs, stutters, etc.)? How do they want you to handle numbers, web addresses, etc.? Also, some transcribers want you to put time stamps directly into your transcript. Others (like Crowdsurf) break that into a separate task.  If you have a low wpm, no, transcribing probably isn't for you, unless you have a very good ear for various accents or are very familiar with specialized terminology that would give you an advantage in transcribing audio for those specialized topics.   But it can't hurt to try. Maybe this is a way to increase your speed."
mturk,3d7jyi,VortexVortexVortex,2,Tue Jul 14 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"Transcribing is basically the act of copying a text/data/information from one source to another. For example, a series of interviews are done but for ease the audio is simply recorded. The transcribing process would be to take those interview recordings and create, say, a text document that is a word for word copy. In the turking world, this scenario will most likely be what you do. Each company that has transcribing jobs will have a very specific method to how you go about creating the transcribed documents."
mturk,3d7jyi,arguvan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"If you are not willing to spend a great deal of time learning how to transcribe and also learning how to increase your wpm, then you should forget about it altogether. You will not make decent money at it. Transcribing is a skilled profession. Many new people think that it is easy money, but it takes a LOT of hard work and skill to actually make it worthwhile. It is not simple data entry, although to an outsider, it could appear to be simple data entry.    As others have said, you can give it a try, but without some serious effort on your part and lots of hard work, you are just wasting time that is better spent working on a variety of tasks on mturk increasing your skill base."
mturk,3d7jyi,vaginapuppet,2,Tue Jul 14 13:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to jump in here and say:  I owned a transcription company for 19 years and please trust me that any transcription you do on MTurk is paid with LESS THAN slave wages.    A good transcriptionist can make a decent living working for reputable companies as an employee or contractor, and an experienced VERY good transcriptionist can make from $35-90 per hour.  What you're paid on MTurk is shameful -- even though MTurk pay in general is often below minimum hourly wage.   Considering the necessary compliance with strict formatting standards, the VERY low pay and the product quality expected, transcription is, IMO, the worst gig on MTurk."
mturk,3d7jyi,challam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"The good ones on MTurk are few and far between, and the best ones are usually under the masters qual.  The best one I got was 2 or 3 weeks ago (masters) and it paid $75 for about 75 minutes of audio.  It's still not great pay, but it's way better than other ones.  I saw about a dozen posted yesterday that paid $1 for a 5 minute clip.  Horrible, horrible pay and I would never attempt those.  MTurk isn't a good place to find consistent, well-paying tasks.  But, sometimes you get lucky if you're on at the right time."

(People not aware of this will otherwise think ""since when is $1/min not great pay!?"" ;-) )"
mturk,3d7jyi,clickhappier,2,Tue Jul 14 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"In the transcription world, productivity is measured as a ratio, where one minute of audio will equal four+ minutes of transcription time, for example: 1:4 will represent an EXCELLENT, very experienced, knowledgeable transcriptionist who probably uses productivity aids such as macros, word expander software, etc.  Beginners or novices usually rack up a 1:8-9 ratio."

Possible, but it takes a lot of effort if you haven't been at it a long time.  2.) $600 is the 1099 threshold for reporting in the US. Not sure if Amazon has any specific guidelines. [Source: I'm a bookkeeper]  3.) REALLY depends on how much you put in and how many qualifications you have.  4.) If you decide to do penny hits that offer bonuses, research and make sure the company is not a scam.  My first month I did a ton of CopyText and didn't understand why I wasn't getting the bonuses I thought were promised.  Read fine print because you can waste your time."

The 1099-MISC $600 thing is not relevant to MTurk in any way since several years ago. The money all comes through Amazon Payments that is now subject to different requirements as a payment-processing service, which most turkers wouldn't come close to exceeding, but you are still obligated to accurately report on your own regardless.  OP:   I only have to file tax if I earn more than $400 a year right?   You only owe self-employment taxes on self-employment earnings of $400+ per year, so if you don't have any other sources of income or other reasons to file (like getting ACA marketplace health insurance), then that is probably the case. But anyone can file, even if you don't think you're required to and/or don't owe anything, to help maintain the kind of paper trail Amazon Payments seems to prefer; and depending on their circumstances, some people might even be eligible for some refundable tax credits (like EITC) that you'd miss out on by not filing.

mturk,3d66yd,earnonlineaccount,24,Mon Jul 13 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the masters qualification is a cleverly-disguised marketing ploy by Amazon designed to squeeze extra money from the Requester with no discernible benefits.  I have been a worker for nearly 5 years (290,000+ approved HITs, 99.99% approval rating, no masters qualification) and a Requester for 2 years.   Employing the masters qualification is a disservice to Requesters and workers alike. It is a disservice to Requesters because they face a severely limited worker pool, pay a premium fee and often do not get the volume of responses they require, rendering the data collection unusable.  It is a disservice to workers like me, who, despite outstanding work performance am excluded from a lot of great work.  Amazon makes the masters qualification a default setting the Requester UI, preying on the ignorance of new Requesters. They make the setting difficult to find, effectively forcing unwitting requesters to use it.  As a requester, I have received much better results using a combination of total approved HITs and HIT approval rating as qualifications then using just the masters qualification.  Not to say the masters qualified workers are bad; there are many great workers who have the masters qualification, and many poor workers who hold the qualification. There are many great workers who do not hold it.   In the time I have been using Mechanical Turk, I have seen the following:   workers with less than 3000 approved HITs receive the masters qualification workers with low approval ratings receive the masters qualification a workers who set up a second account (under a friends name) just to take surveys multiple times - that second account was granted the masters qualification the masters quals are always granted in groups of 3 - I have seen workers who have never done a photo moderation task in their life be granted the Photo Moderation Master qualification (this one is especially telling - Amazon would lead you to believe the Photo Moderation Masters have actually done Photo mod tasks)  I have seen workers with less than 6 weeks experience be granted the masters qualification. I have seen a worker receive the masters qualifications months after their account was permanently suspended   Over the past 18 months, I have messaged over 8000 new requesters who were (generally unwittingly) using the masters qualification. Nearly 5000 of them opted to discontinue using the masters qualification.   Here are some select responses I have received in reply to my message:  ""Holy crap thank you so much for letting me know. They hide that setting  completely when you’re setting up HITs! I never would have known and I wouldn’t have gotten my HITs finished. How infuriating and disrespectful to both requesters and workers. ""  ""Thank you for letting me know! I was wondering why it was taking forever to get to the 500 needed for my sample""  ""This is incredibly helpful information. I really don't need just masters, especially since this is a survey about what people think. I thought the 30% to amazon seemed high, that money would be better served going to higher worker payments.""  ""Thank you so much for your input!  I did not realize the task was set to require Masters (and was wondering why so few people were taking the survey).  I recently changed this feature yesterday and received a ton more workers. ""  ""Thanks for the information.  I was somewhat tricked into using the Master's qualification by mturk this time (it was ""strongly suggested"" when I created the HIT).  I have never relied on it before, and will probably not rely on it in the future.  I agree that the fees were a bit exorbitant.""  ""Thank you for taking time to contact me. This is the first HIT that I have created. I was very disappointed that it had the ""Master"" qualification. I will make sure the next HITs I create do not have this. I also didn't know about the 30%, that seems unfair.  Can you tell me how to reply to workers that have worked on my HIT? Almost all of them were done wrong so far.""  ""Thank you for that heads up! Normally, my research assistant posts our HITs and this was the first time I did it myself. I didn't realize that Master's was the default. Amazon does a pretty good job of making it tricky to even find where one can change the settings for worker qualifications! The revised HIT is now posted. Many thanks again for the heads-up. This saved me money and--more importantly--has helped me reach my intended worker pool.""  ""Thanks for the message. I noticed this issue earlier and fixed it. You're right, sending HITs only to ""masters"" is a waste of time, particularly for market research type stuff.""  ""Just to keep you informed: You were correct, and the masters qualification was not for us. We are putting a test up one last time, this time with slightly more lax qualifications ""  ""Thank you very much for your feedback. It seems like Amazon is really pushing people to use Masters workers, and as a result I am getting low adoption on my HITs. When I switched to a normal task with 95% approval rate, I was able to get HITs done quickly and with good results as well.""  ""Thanks for the message, I haven't used Turk in a while and went with the defaults.  I opened it up to non Masters and used the settings you described.  You're doing the lord's work there educating people on the extra money Amazon is skimming off the top with the Masters program.""  ""Thank you very much for the tips! Amazon did not make it clear that it cost more and restricted work. There is even a big scary warning box when you unselect Masters in the qualifications. ""  ""Thanks for the note. I tried requiring Masters just this once to compare quality to other studies I've done, and I agree, I found non-Masters workers to be just as good as Masters. I also do think it's unfortunate that Amazon awards the Masters qual so arbitrarily. So in the future, I think I'll not require Masters, and just do 98%/5000 qualifications like you suggested."""

While you definitely can find new HITs with TM, Hit Scraper can do a better job of finding stuff for you with a broader search. I had a pretty good idea of what requesters I needed to follow and what search terms worked best for me when I wrote the script so Turkmaster did a better job of finding HITs for me than it did for some others.

mturk,3dahnz,donovanm,2,Wed Jul 15 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"7 weeks here for me, 6 weeks in I installed both TM and HS.  I learned TM first because it felt easier and more user-friendly.  I got rid of HS shortly after so I could focus on learning TM fully.  It's been working out very well for me, but I'm -still- learning new things.  I'm almost embarrassed to mention this, but I literally just figured out how to properly add a PandA to TM itself.  Before, I was doing the ol' auto-refreshing tabs trick.  I'm finally convinced I should take on learning HS this weekend, but TM has been a god-send to a more visual learner like myself.  Thank you so much for your hard work!!"

I mean thats at least $36 a day and you get to laugh a little…. add the ben peterson refresher in the back ground, $40 a day plus whatever you find on HWTF… I seriously don't know how you can make that little.

I Panda all the surveys that they share on the forum.  Rarely get any.   There's no good batches on Turk anymore..    I personally like the App Annotations from John Smith and the ProductRnR 12 cent image HITs and all the Google requesters..   But those are never around anymore.    Turk is dieing!

There was also a (yet another) new Google requester yesterday who posted a batch of 30 cent HITs that literally took 30 seconds each.

But it sounds like you didn't even make it to the Amazon Payments denial step, they dropped you in the 48-hour MTurk approval period which AFAIK only targets people in other countries... Amazon's ability to link you to your prior location may go deeper than you think, despite what the chat rep said. You might have to move on to some of the other /r/SitesLikeMturk ."

Thanks for the information provided, I'll look more into it and perhaps contact Amazon to see if there's anything else they can do on their end.   Thank you!"

Then there's nothing you can do except contact the requester (include your completion code from the end of the survey) and ask them to set up a compensation HIT for you."

Use HitScraper to secure good hits.  Also, I would suggest that, since you're working from home now, that you consider getting involved with some other programs that you can run passively or semi-passively while at your desk.  I personally use Swagbucks and Perk TV (and might add EarnHoney and/or Earnably soon).  Basically, between HiTs I check to make sure my Perk TV phones are running the passive apps still without crashing, and I'll navigate to the next video or ad on some of the Swagbucks offers I have open on my laptop and tablet.

Usually from the time I get back from my morning workout to dinner time.  The money is less than minimum wage, I know. But it beats being a NEET.   is there some production tips to make more?   For surveys and/or doing work for requester you've never worked for, always refer to Turkopticon.

mturk,3cxb5i,MartyMcfly6,3,Sun Jul 12 03:06:21 2015 UTC,nah you could accept up to 24 hits at a time and find them in your hits assigned to you section http://i.imgur.com/XD1F2Zx.png  if im working on different hits i usually have about 5 in my queue..i'll start with the one that has the shortest timer and work my way to the hits with the longer ones so none of them expire..i only accept the max if im working on a batch that gives me enough time.
mturk,3cxb5i,Yds,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:39:32 2015 UTC,Thank you! I've only recently starting using mTurk and wasn't aware that hits assigned to you section served that purpose. I thought it was for invitations to complete hits. I was opening accepted hits on separate tabs :) This will make my life much easier for sure. Thanks again.
mturk,3cxbpa,ajdj1169,2,Sat Jul 11 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would start earlier.  I'm usually starting around 9 AM EST."
mturk,3cxbpa,coffeenick,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:00:43 2015 UTC,Great....I think I will start with that time....Thanks
mturk,3cxbpa,texaskevin06,2,Sat Jul 11 17:04:17 2015 UTC,9 EST is usually when new surveys start posting but I would suggest starting a bit earlier to do some of the surveys you missed overnight.
mturk,3cxbpa,MartyMcfly6,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:01:57 2015 UTC,makes sense...thank you...
mturk,3cxbpa,Suituy,2,Sat Jul 11 21:17:24 2015 UTC,i think 9am is a good time but it usually peeks around 10am-2pm..

mturk,3cvkfg,kimadagem,3,Sat Jul 11 03:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel like I've seen a few more that are packing in more unrelated studies into one HIT lately, too."

Maybe Amazon just wants more easy money from requesters don't think creatively...  lol.  And hey- I'll skip doing an extra 4 or 5 consent+demos for a longer 'batch-surveys' HIT if the pay rate is still reasonable."
mturk,3cvkfg,Clu7chy,5,Sun Jul 12 03:30:38 2015 UTC,I noticed that too. I hit $120 on Wednesday alone. If only it'd always stay like this.

mturk,3cvkfg,misspiggie,2,Sat Jul 11 06:00:09 2015 UTC,Yeah - I have a feeling there will be a big difference in the number of hits available from July 21 to July 22.

mturk,3cvkfg,MeltingGlacier,2,Tue Jul 14 09:05:51 2015 UTC,Yup! They'll be a void in about 10 days... so do them while you can!
mturk,3cvkfg,boofwad,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Another thing I've been thinking about are these studies that have multiple years of data that still needs to be collected (i.e., 200 participants every 3 months for 3 years).  They can't just move to another platform, it would invalidate their data...  So I'm thinking a lot of these long-term experiment requesters have no choice but to stay with MTurk, and Amazon knows that."
mturk,3cuppj,lgnsqr,7,Fri Jul 10 22:50:09 2015 UTC,They barely pay anything for their hits. The instructions are often at odds with the HIT. The HITs themselves are too long for the offer. A lot of the hits are just garbage.   ...   But I do them.   Annnnnd there's your problem.  People doing them is what keeps the trash around.
mturk,3cuppj,BornIn1500,7,Sat Jul 11 12:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'm very close to hitting 1000 hits. So far, I only have 5 rejects, and all 5 of them are from P9R. It would be higher if I hadn't taken the time to send them an email."
mturk,3cuppj,RedDragon501,2,Sat Jul 11 01:05:58 2015 UTC,There is a theory that every nth hit you submit to them is rejected.
mturk,3cuppj,Hootinger,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:44 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I wouldn't be terribly surprised if that were the case.
mturk,3cuppj,RedDragon501,5,Fri Jul 17 00:09:03 2015 UTC,"I stopped doing all p9r work last year for exactly the reasons described here.  If any of you have not already done so, consider leaving a review on turkopticon to warn others about this requester."
mturk,3cuppj,ShanaDoobyDoo,5,Sat Jul 11 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"A big problem with Mturk is the low paying batches that require too much time to be invested into for such little pay and Amazon raising their fees doesn't help either to improve workers getting fair pay.  I rarely do p9r due to their low pay, and because of the high risk of rejection. It is not worth the risk of mass rejection for a hit that requires so much time invested into for such little pay."
mturk,3cuppj,AlanIaningram,4,Fri Jul 10 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"No. They'll just mash more work into one HIT, which is what Amazon advises requesters to do."
mturk,3cuppj,withanamelikesmucker,3,Sat Jul 11 10:12:47 2015 UTC,"I've been doing them because they are simple, fast for me to do, and I'm new, so I need those 1000 approved hits. I just pick and choose what I do and it works for me in that sense."
mturk,3cuppj,HenryJakubs,2,Sat Jul 11 12:30:36 2015 UTC,"I very rarely do p9r HITs because they pay so low and the rejections are usually ridiculous. They expect what isnt really possible sometimes, like transcribing people's signatures. I can't even read my own signature. Ive gotten my share of rejections as well and I promise there are better HITs to invest in."
mturk,3cuppj,alisonlovepowell,2,Sun Jul 12 23:09:12 2015 UTC,p9r only puts their shitty HITs up on mturk because for some crazy reason people still do them. they pay so terribly but if you want them to improve just stop doing them. we should really start an mturk union lol
mturk,3cuppj,vrus16,2,Sat Jul 11 16:53:45 2015 UTC,"Ive been turking for about 36 days now. Almost $700 with 3072 hits submited and 2264 approved (13 rejections). When I first started, I did some p9r hits and got a few rejections for the same reasons. After that I never did another one of their hits and I never will."

mturk,3cuppj,Kubelek,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:37:23 2015 UTC,"They only gave me one random rejection and reversed it after I wrote an email about it.   When I was trying to hit 1000 with their 1 cent hits I pretty much only picked their easiest jobs, like yes and no boxes, transcribing one word per line and only accepting hits with clearly legible writing. That worked fine for me, was slower but rather safe.   I'd suggest doing Richmond's single value hits - they're harder to catch cause he posts small batches, but they're safer"
mturk,3cuppj,pmb1882,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:24:26 2015 UTC,"All of my rejections are from them too. I notice that if I send back a hit with mostly ""impossibles"" that's when I get a rejections (4 total).

mturk,3cuppj,clickhappier,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:29:39 2015 UTC,"I've heard recently that they're not being as forthcoming with reversals as they used to be, too.

I'd suggest you file this post in the Rejection/block flair rather than the general 'Watercooler', fyi."
mturk,3ctjgk,gidime,7,Fri Jul 10 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"Compassion. Certainly an honorable trait.  In my first career, social work, I worked with homeless and homelessness prevention programs. In my opinion, your idea is a good one and could possibly work toward changing lives.  As I'm sure you know, the reasons behind homelessness vary - domestic violence, un/underemployment, substance abuse, mental illness, etc. You're probably not going to see many takers off of the street, however you could find your target population in mental health centers and domestic violence shelters. There are many programs already in place to provide job skills training, and turking does require computer skills. Even if people don't become a career turker (or other type of microtasker), their computer skills would improve and make them more job-ready. Besides, resumes that show current employment - and there's a way to word resumes so turking is current employment - aren't automatically binned. I've helped several people with mental health issues learn to turk; it works well for people with anxiety, particularly social anxiety, issues.  I do wish you luck. Think about it, even if you positively impact the life of just one person, you have made a difference."
mturk,3ctjgk,withanamelikesmucker,5,Fri Jul 10 23:43:44 2015 UTC,and there's a way to word resumes so turking is current employment   Yep!
mturk,3ctjgk,clickhappier,13,Fri Jul 10 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to teach homeless people or really broke people and it's been a heartbreaking waste of time.  Your heart is in the right place.  However, in the last seven months I've been trying to teach people, they don't make the time to sit down with me or they take a peek at it before we get a chance and see things like penny hits and declare it a waste of time.  It has been my experience that people love to bitch about how bad off they are, and they wear their depression like a comfy old sweatshirt and it is really uncomfortable for them to take off.  When you offer them a way out of it it freaks them out and makes them withdraw so they don't have to actually do anything to fix their problems.  It is uncomfortable for a lot of depressed broke and or homeless people to break this narrative of ""poor me"" and their identity is wrapped up in living in victim of society mode.  Plus, panhandlers make way more money on the street begging for change than actually working.  I know a lot of self professed homeless people making $40,000 or more a year begging for change so why would they give that up to work on dollar surveys?    Tl;dr: you can teach a man to fish but they will just eat the meal with you and keep bitching to people they don't know how to fish."
mturk,3ctjgk,blushingapple,6,Fri Jul 10 17:47:01 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure if begging for change for a year returned a $40,000 payout, everybody would be doing it.  Including me.  Unfortunately, it doesn't."
mturk,3ctjgk,withanamelikesmucker,3,Sat Jul 11 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think there's much too much of a societal/cultural influence on that being ""the lowest tier"" of dignity. None of us would do it because we aren't comfortable with allowing ourselves to do that."
mturk,3ctjgk,Skatinbrad,4,Sat Jul 11 15:18:30 2015 UTC,"Wait, so me doing all of these penny hits isn't begging for change? Well this sucks, I guess it's time to stop wearing these ratty looking clothes while I turk. I thought it would increase my bonuses."
mturk,3ctjgk,Strigas,3,Sat Jul 11 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"You're not begging anyone, you're earning it :)"
mturk,3ctjgk,Skatinbrad,2,Sat Jul 11 18:34:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insights, I thought the main issue would be skills but I guess not ): Did all of the people you worked with behaved like this? or there was some that actually ""got it"""
mturk,3ctjgk,blushingapple,8,Fri Jul 10 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"Nearly all of the people I have worked with in the last seven months have been like this.  Two people who HAVE stuck with it both have full time jobs and treat it like beer money.    Funny part is, I was forced into homelessness last year by a domestically abusive ex who managed to take away all my ways to earn money, so I searched and found the beermoney subreddit and started doing turk and swagbucks and stuff to earn money he wouldn't know about.  I was thrilled.  It felt so liberating.  I wanted to be able to get a library set up to help local homeless people and teach them the stuff I learned.  My own homelessness is what led me down this path.  You absolutely could turk from a library, and I have.    But someone has got to want it bad enough and it's not your job to be their mommy and boost up their egos to get them in the chair to learn the stuff.  They gotta come to you.  And they probably won't based on my experience.  If you actually charged for a class to teach them, say $20 for two hours, they might actually take it serious but even then I highly doubt it.  It's way easier to bitch about how bad your life sucks and apparently more fun and rewarding or something, I dunno.  I would see friends bitching on Facebook how they are not going to be able to pay next month's rent and they aren't really looking for a solution by doing that.  I think they just like having people chime in and tell them how they know they are doing the best they can and there there, it's a hard world out there and America sucks and corporate greed got us here blah blah blah!  It's not your fault your life is a mess!  That's what they want to hear, and then they want handouts.  It's crazy making.  I'd advise just not going down this road at all after my seven months with it.  Unless you pair up with like, a social worker or someone who is better able to rally a group for you to work with.  On your own though, it's gonna be a big waste of time and make you hate people."
mturk,3ctjgk,iamralph,7,Fri Jul 10 18:48:53 2015 UTC,When I was homeless there was a 2 hour limit on the library computer.....
mturk,3ctjgk,pwicca,3,Fri Jul 10 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"And most libraries require proof of address to show that you live in the city and therefore paid taxes to support the library in order to get a library card and a card is usually required for the computers. If you already had a card before becoming homeless, you'd still be able to use it until it expires, but no address means no card."
mturk,3ctjgk,iamralph,2,Sun Jul 12 14:29:34 2015 UTC,"that part isn't hard to get by, but it does require some knowledge of the system.  You can always get an address, but you'll need to find someone who can help you navigate the system and knows the places that give you addresses.  Its unnecessarily difficult tbh, but the system isn't supposed to make you not homeless it's supposed to keep you homeless to keep the funding for the programs you will inevitably end up using."
mturk,3ctjgk,clickhappier,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"Just a guess, but I'd expect that since libraries tend to get homeless visitors regularly, the librarians might have some suggestions on where to go for some help / for an address. :-)"

I told her more than a month ago about MTurk and transcription services you can do at home, virtual assistant stuff, etc. She didn't even say thank you. I get that depression is tough and I'm not chastising her, but I'm not donating to that fund either."
mturk,3ctjgk,blushingapple,3,Fri Jul 10 23:13:39 2015 UTC,I really appreciate that you tried this! I'm disappointed to hear they didn't take it seriously but I guess for some of them that's the mentality that got them homeless.
mturk,3ctjgk,PokerBoySwag,4,Fri Jul 10 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I worry now that continuing to surround myself with broke and depressed people on the brink of homelessness is just gonna keep me broke and depressed and homeless too.  Instead of trying to ""teach them how to fish"", I'm getting more involved with my local preferred political party's already building momentum on how to help solve homelessness around my part of America.  It seems much more effective to jump on the bandwagon of something already more organized than just one person trying to teach Turking and beer money sites to people who don't want to really learn it.  Local politicians are much more positive and effective people to be associating with if I want to make a difference.  And hopefully they are rich people and one invites me on their big ol' boat this summer :o)"

If that counts..  =/  Wish i was joking but seriously Turk is tough. Even with all the scripts and tools it isn't that much better.  So much competition over pennies and dollars.  Not to mention after July 22 Turk as we know it will be dead.  Edit: And I'm very computer literate.  I built my own PC.  I have out of the box thinking.  I did internet marketing for one year without knowing a single thing and managed to make $40,000 with only putting in a couple hours a day at the computer.  Of course it died down and it's harder to make money now doing that so that's why I got Turking.  I Turk 12+ hours a day and I am lucky if I even hit $20. Not to mention I'm couped up in a room all by my lonesome and my social life is going to hell because of it..  So yea Turking isn't for everyone and for Mexican wages and missing out on LIFE it honestly isn't worth it"

mturk,3ctjgk,k9centipede,2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:03 2015 UTC,I've got nothing to fall back on so I Turk 12 hours a day..  only been Turking 2 months. Maybe a couple weeks over that and have only done almost 4400 HITs but have made $497  I honestly hate it and am not happy.  12 hours a day and if you are lucky you make $20 is really not a good feeling.  It's depressing.  And yes not to mention the past week has been horrible but I feel like every day is horrible if you're only making $20 for 12+ hours of work
mturk,3ctjgk,blushingapple,2,Tue Jul 14 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"Another example- I tried to teach a group of Satanists, all broken depressed people nearly on the brink of homelessness or already homeless couch surfers.  12 people.  No one would commit to a date or time after several months of bringing it up to them- even though they all said they really needed the help and would totally love to see what I do to make $700/mo!  It has made me really biased against Satanists."
mturk,3ctjgk,MeltingGlacier,2,Fri Jul 10 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"I've found its easier to set up a wide time and let people know and have them come to you than for you to have them schedule something.   ""The first Saturday of every month I'm going to put aside 5 hours. Anyone that wants to learn come by and I'll teach you"".   It's a bit overwhelming to be responsible for scheduling things.

It's like, why the hell do I care about what a 63 year old coworker from two departments over in a company I worked for eight years go thinks about my posts?    Now when my brain starts going ""goddamn, people suck, I wish I was dead"" I bring myself back into the present moment and remind myself I could be writing a song or conjugating French verbs with this energy, or god forbid, dick around on Reddit instead, and even Reddit I'm trying to cut back on!"

Good call on ditching FaceBook, the effects on your well-being are numerous and not always easily noticed.  I'm so glad I did it when I did.  I've actually thought to myself several times the past month about making a flyer about MTurk to distribute to the homeless folk I see around here.  However, I've witnessed a couple incidents that totally soured me on the idea.  I'll hopefully have time to elaborate tonight.  Thanks again for sharing your thoughts and experiences!  <3"
mturk,3ctjgk,AlanIaningram,4,Fri Jul 10 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"I know at least one MTG member has said they were homeless and turked from the public library; they seem to have managed to become non-homeless after a while, though they haven't shared details."
mturk,3ctjgk,OurLadyBolton,2,Fri Jul 10 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"IIRC, there are a few of us that are/were homeless and came out of it or at least eased the stress of it through mturk.   I was street homeless when I found mturk, and I used the library for the hour of alloted time, as many times as they would let me. It helped me buy food and toiletries while I was out there. A few weeks later, I became one of the ""hidden homeless"", also known as couchsurfers. A good friend of mine let me set up a little bit of space in his apartment, and because I cannot (as of yet) get a brick-and-mortar job due to some health issues, I turk like it's a ""real job"". Keeping a somewhat business-hour schedule, staying focused, and hopping on turk when I would otherwise be wandering aimlessly and wasting time online has helped me to pay toward medical/utility debts keeping me from obtaining my own place.   In short, it can be done. It's a bit like AA though, in that ""It works if you work it, and it sucks if you don't"". You have to put forth the proper effort to see the reward, but it can be done.  To OP, I say that perhaps only choosing to work with those that are actually ready to make a change would bring your idea to better fruition. No offense to blushingapple, but just because it didn't work in their area or with their social group, doesn't mean it might not work in yours. One of the most important rules of helping anyone make things better in their lives is that they have to want it. Blow off those that hem and haw about it, and focus on those who show true interest. If you just change one or two lives for the better, it's totally worth it IMHO."
mturk,3ctjgk,randomoaf,3,Tue Jul 14 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about the idea of using a micro worker platform to help out homeless people or any person who is living in low income, however there are some factors to be considered and should not be ignored.  One. Computer access, Certain library computers only offer a limited amount of hours to log into a computer for free internet use. My local library only offers Two hours to log into a computer a day, that is not enough time to earn enough money and that is why I use my own laptop.  Two. Rejection, Rejections from requesters when they are not the workers fault can destroy your approval rating and limit your pay, something a person that needs money in order to survive may not want to risk.  Three. Banking, most homeless people do not have a bank account to transfer the funds into a account to spend the money on the better things in life.  Homelessness is a complicated problem with many factors in-between, however I feel you are on the right track of using crowd sourcing to help those in need, but unless people are willing to set up better homeless housing and more crowd sourcing workshops at local colleges and libraries the idea of using Mturk to help the homeless is going to be a slow process."
mturk,3ctjgk,centraliac,4,Sat Jul 11 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"In answer to three, the American Express Bluebird card works similar to a bank account but doesn't require a credit check/doesn't have monthly fees/provides a routing number so that you can use it to ""deposit"" MTurk earnings onto. I've used it to this purpose without issue so that I don't have to provide bank account info to Amazon, and so that fun money stays separate from regular job money.  10/10 would recommend."
mturk,3ctjgk,clickhappier,3,Sat Jul 11 12:50:27 2015 UTC,My brother's friend is homeless and I tried to help him out with Mturk.  He threw that idea away faster than I pitched it.  He did confirm to me that he could work in the library for longer than the limit allows. The people that know him there are cool enough to leave him alone.  But that's not the problem here.
mturk,3ctjgk,MarciTX,2,Sun Jul 12 12:09:45 2015 UTC,"How would the payment work? A lot of homeless people (or poor people in general) deal exclusively with cash. It takes a lot to get from a HIT to literal money in your pocket.   It's hard to get a bank account if you're homeless or move a lot and don't have a secure mailing address. Besides, most banks have monthly fees of at least $8, which could wipe out a week's worth of earnings or more. There's also the issue that homeless people need any money they can get, but banks do not like people keeping their accounts next to zero. One unexpected ATM or maintenance fee can turn into an overdraft charge of $30-$50 (which is another reason many poor people use only cash: it's better to be flat broke than in debt)."
mturk,3ctjgk,MeltingGlacier,3,Fri Jul 10 20:11:39 2015 UTC,How would the payment work?   Bluebird prepaid card that acts like a bank account has no monthly fees. I expect the biggest problem is getting Amazon Payments to verify their identity info.
mturk,3ctjgk,wendysNO1wcheese,3,Fri Jul 10 20:34:41 2015 UTC,All u would need is a netspend card. U can buy them anywhere and they act as a bank account. I've used this prepaid card for turking for 2 years. Not that hard.
mturk,3ctjgk,wendysNO1wcheese,2,Fri Jul 10 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, you know what's up.  I gotta chime in and say Netspend has been a friggin godsend after dealing with banks for 15 years.  Impossible to overdraft unless you opt-in, just as good as a bank card+checking acct for essential uses.  I even did Pay As You Go ($1/credit $2.5/debit or atm) for a while until I qualified for Premier status for depositing $500 from MTurk in a calendar month (26 days!). Premier removes all swipe fees besides ATM use for $5/month.  So now, 8 months of paying for Netspend = $40 = One overdraft fee which I've paid dozens if not hundreds of in my lifetime.  So glad that garbage is over with.  I don't do referrals, so get a referral link (+$20 each) from someone worthy on the beermoney sub if anyone reading decides to try NS."
mturk,3ctjgk,pwicca,3,Sat Jul 11 01:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think most of them need to be helped with treatment for mental and physical health problems first. Nice sentiment, but naive. Maybe one day that will happen when the overwhelming majority aren't men."
mturk,3ctjgk,sorrynopic,2,Fri Jul 10 21:41:46 2015 UTC,"Great paragraph. You know there's a difference between ""to cure"" and ""to treat"" right? Please show me where I said ""cure"". I apologize if this is getting lost in translation. I'm not fluent in Gibberish."
mturk,3ctjgk,withanamelikesmucker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:18:39 2015 UTC,"It was called deinstitutionalization and there were a lot of factors behind it, three of the big ones were community mental health, the establishment of SSI and that there were better antipsychotics that allowed people to become productive members of society instead of being warehoused for life. If they have the right medical regimen it doesn't make mental illness worse. By the way Reagan was governor of California at the time so he couldn't have emptied mental hospitals in any of the 49 other states, he simply signed a bill stopping indefinite involuntary commitment, something that the Supreme Court has determined is unconstitutional."
mturk,3ctjgk,kimadagem,0,Sat Jul 11 11:58:09 2015 UTC,the concept is nice but it don't see it executing well. most homeless people have mental or drug problems. mturking also takes some work and efficiency to maximize your efforts which I don't see homeless people wanting to do. begging is much easier and has a higher reward.
mturk,3ctjgk,pwicca,4,Sun Jul 12 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"Those may be the homeless people you see, but there's another category of homeless people you don't see - those that are ""doubling up,"" meaning they are temporarily living with others until they are able to obtain their own home.  The stereotype of homeless people as beggars, drug addicts or mentally ill is exactly that, a stereotype. That stereotype only serves to impart the notion that homeless people are beyond help, which is certainly not true.  Lots of people live on the edge and are one paycheck or one emergency spend away from losing their permanent place to live."
mturk,3ctjgk,blushingapple,5,Fri Jul 10 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"most homeless people have mental or drug problems.   Well, that's definitely the stereotype but I doubt it's true now - if it ever was. The economy has made a lot of people homeless who have the skills to use a computer, and may even own one. MTurk isn't a great way to make money but it's better than nothing, and it's definitely better than panhandling (what you call begging), which is not only illegal in a lot of places but also potentially dangerous."
mturk,3cuyhc,MainTank,4,Sat Jul 11 00:03:13 2015 UTC,"I don't have much helpful information since you were doing HITs to get your numbers up. But CrowdSource is leaving mTurk towards the end of July, and their work will be available via their own website. They're phasing off of mTurk.

I'll usually put in a solid 6 hours though. Catching some of those $2.50 and $3.00 hits before they vanish has definitely helped out."
mturk,3crbxz,jarchack,2,Sun Jul 12 02:42:23 2015 UTC,Care to share any info on your scraper? Are these high dollar hits all master hits?
mturk,3crbxz,NoUse4AName68,2,Sun Jul 12 15:44:09 2015 UTC,I don't have Master's but I do have scraper refresh every 15 seconds or so and if I'm paying attention I'll usually catch a killer hit once every couple of hours.... more often on busy days. A killer hit (to me) is one that pays $2 or more and/or pays .25 per minute plus. My luckiest find was a $9 hit that took 18 minutes. Those types of hits only last for milliseconds and you have to catch them fast.   Oh... I don't do batches or hits that pay less than .40. I also don't mess with TO's with less than a 3.75. I sleep only 4 or 5 hours a night and have a laptop running scraper pretty much 24/7. I actually focus on it from 6 AM to Noon PST though.

mturk,3crbxz,SFluff,8,Fri Jul 10 04:18:03 2015 UTC,2 hours $6 is not far off from what i do. On average i make $4-$5 in a hour. I started using turkmaster a few months ago and that really helped find those hits that die fast. hwtf was my life saver during my first year. hitscraper comes in handy at times as well.

mturk,3crbxz,diphling,8,Fri Jul 10 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty much you set parameters for what you're looking for. A certain requestor or a certain hit of there's. Anyways it plays on a loop resetting at an interval you specify. It notifies you when hits in those parameters are available, and if you put the panda(preview and accept) link in it auto accepts once it finds them. It's been a life saver with good paying hits that get snatched up quickly.  Edit: These scripts run in your browser through extensions (usually greasemonkey for Firefox and tampermonkey for Chrome) you can then add many helpful scripts (I like browsing the selection at greasyfork.org) to not only help with finding hits, but also help with completing some of the simple ones."

mturk,3crbxz,TheBigGrinder,2,Fri Jul 10 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"You have that slightly backwards.  Let's say you make 30k/yr at your full time job and are filing single.  Your tax bill at the end of the year will be 4,050.  Your job will likely withhold 15%, or 4500.  Your refund is the 4500-4050, or 450.    You just added 10k on to your earnings though.  So your job has only withheld 4500, but your new tax bill is 5863.  You will no longer get a refund, but instead will receive a bill for 1363.  Depending on where you fall in the bracket, that extra 10k can be taxed as high as 3,960 (But assuming average income, you're looking between 1500-2500).  If your refund is routinely over that amount, you're likely safe, just dont expect any refund.  If it is not, well, then pack some money away.  http://blogs-images.forbes.com/kellyphillipserb/files/2014/10/Single_rates.png"

mturk,3ctdr4,oh1oh541539,3,Fri Jul 10 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"I guess my question is if you were in my shoes would you accept the HIT and risk reject?   I wouldn't. I wouldn't want to potentially mess up the quality of the requester's data by giving my answers twice. If you really want to do it, though, you could email the requester and ask."
mturk,3ctdr4,electr0lyte,2,Fri Jul 10 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"Well I returned them once they starting seeming too familiar...  Yep, I guess my plan is going to be trying to get the scripts under control..."
mturk,3ctdr4,kimadagem,2,Fri Jul 10 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"Well I returned them once they starting seeming too familiar...   That's a good idea. Some requesters don't use screeners, which makes it a lot harder to know whether you're eligible. It wastes a bunch of time to accept the hit, start it, and then return it when you discover you've already done it, but to me that's better than a rejection.  As long as you're keeping Hit DB updated it will keep updating those little ""R"" and ""T"" icons, and the ""R"" icon will at least give you a clue about whether you've worked for that requester before. If you get a green ""R"" and click on it you can also get a page with a list of the hits you've done for that requester, which you could then compare with the title of the current hit to see how close it is (if it matches the ""T"" icon will also be green). That doesn't work in Firefox though; it does work in Chrome and Opera because I've tried it.  Besides Chrome and Opera there are other browsers that will run scripts (although with varying degrees of success). /u/clickhappier has listed them here:  http://www.mturkgrind.com/threads/which-browsers-can-you-run-userscripts-in-and-how.27432/#post-483568"
mturk,3ctdr4,pwicca,2,Fri Jul 10 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"I put mine in a spreadsheet and sort it A-Z by requester, that way I don't have to search, I just have to scroll down to their name. Most are looking for unique responses from a certain number of respondents and won't pay for duplicates. But just because the survey looks familiar doesn't mean you've already done it, several surveys use some identical questions."
mturk,3ctdr4,clickhappier,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:07:42 2015 UTC,"Sometimes different requester accounts are working together and repost the same surveys, or sometimes the same requester reposts it under a different title, unfortunately. All you can do is try your best not to repeat surveys that don't specifically say it's okay to repeat, when the requesters don't bother to set up effective retake-prevention methods."

mturk,3ctdr4,jeff0jefferson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:24:13 2015 UTC,"I guess my question is if you were in my shoes would you accept the HIT and risk reject?     If the HIT, or something in the survey page says something to the effect of ""please only participate once"" then I would definitely not do it again.  Not only is it a possible rejection, but it's messing with the person's data that they are gathering.    Some studies and surveys don't mind if you participate more than once though.  So if they don't specify no repeats, I would assume if I don't get screened out I am clear to do it again."

Academic surveys at the moment are slow b/c it's off-season.    Another thing to consider about mturk is that the amount of time you put in doesn't necessarily produce a guaranteed amount. Work posted varies throughout the day and by the week. There can be off days, holidays, etc.    A common thing is that you could make 5-10 for your first two hours but then 2-3/hr and can drop to 0/hr. My experience at the moment is that I can't even make that 5-10 for the first two hrs anymore. It's about 1.50 to .75 for the first two hours, drop to 0 for the 3rd, make a dollar on the 4th, etc.   Before people start calling me out, I'll just show you.  You'll see here that it's been consistent only up to very recently.

mturk,3csk4n,clickhappier,3,Fri Jul 10 19:24:26 2015 UTC,I have no idea what issues you're having with that script.  I use this to track HIT times.

Anyway, my hourly wage always says $0/hr and my earnings for today has stayed at $0 too, but I'm hoping that will all start working now using the mmmturkeybacon script linked here.

Nothing you can do about it from your end... send the requester a message if you want to make sure they're aware of the issue. If their HITs are giving that error when you preview them, it's not worth bothering to accept them, in the future."
mturk,3cp82b,surveyrequestor,3,Thu Jul 9 17:44:45 2015 UTC,You'll automatically get their worker ID when a worker submits a HIT.
mturk,3cp82b,electr0lyte,3,Thu Jul 9 17:50:41 2015 UTC,You can test creating HITs and seeing how they work using the mturk sandbox.   It works just like the real site except no real money gets used.  https://requestersandbox.mturk.com/ https://workersandbox.mturk.com/mturk/welcome  The documentation is at: https://requester.mturk.com/developer/sandbox
mturk,3cp82b,studystack,2,Thu Jul 9 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"You could have them enter their worker IDs at the end.  Turkers are pretty used to that with surveys and studies.    Alternatively, you could have the unique code at the end different depending on how many parts of the study they qualified to take part in.  Like, if they only participated in part 1 the completion codes could start with D and if they participated in parts 1 and 2, the completion code could start with K.  Or something like that.    You will have all the IDs of the submitted HITs, but the key is to have a way to know which IDs did which parts of the study."
mturk,3cp82b,jim0jameson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"It depends how your survey is correlated to MTurk's data.  I've seen it where surveys require the user to enter their MTurk ID. I've also seen it where surveys have that information passed in the URL from MTurk and then ask the user to confirm it's correct.  Alternatively you can have your survey generate a unique code that the worker must enter in the HIT before submitting it. This not only correlates the survey response to an MTurk HIT submission, it ensures that the worker completed all steps you require (since you determine when the code is given). This is often referred to as a completion code."

If you can set the auto-approval setting closer to your intended timeframe, perhaps 24 or 48 hours, it lets workers better know what they can expect (and occasionally something goes wrong with a requester's approval scripts on their end when they have that kind of setup, causing someone to get stuck with a HIT sitting the full 30 days accidentally, so it's nice to have a faster 'fallback')."
mturk,3cndve,TrevorNetmsi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"So I was trying to work around the mixed content problem by serving the html of indeed via a https connection, but it appears that the scripts still caused problems. I went and replaced all http with https and broke most of the https links in the process, so now my HIT somewhat loads in firefox (the mturk's iframe doesn't handle the redirect properly), but still is not displayed in chrome.  I'm still unsure as to why the source to the page would indicate it is a https link but then the element inspector would say it is a http one, but I'm not too familiar with web development. I've reached out to amazon's customer service too, but my question is still making its way through the system."

mturk,3cl243,symbiotic242,29,Wed Jul 8 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Amazon, despite the stupidity of the pricing increase...this has been a long time coming for CrowdSource. They can't figure out why no one wants to work their ridiculously underpaid HITs, so they're migrating to a platform where they can farm them out to people who will do the work (read: outside the US), and they can pay them even less than they were paying on MTurk. They didn't know about the price changes when they started developing WorkStation.  (Besides, once a business gets to a certain size it often makes more sense to have direct control over your platform, plus it can lower costs, even ignoring the commission increase.)"
mturk,3cl243,tubedogg,6,Wed Jul 8 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what you do on Crowdsource. I write and edit for them and I consistently make about $500 a week, which isn't a ton of money but it's not bad for online work. Some projects are better than others."
mturk,3cl243,sprinklenoms,8,Wed Jul 8 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I only write/edit too. The work was good on mturk but I've heard that the WS platform doesn't allow you to accept more than one task at a time. That's seriously going to kill my hourly rate, so I'm not sure if it's even worth moving over.   I like to stack up a bunch of edits (especially 200-word experts), then knock them down. I just don't see myself doing a few minutes of sorting just to accept ONE task, then spend another five minutes sorting through the queues."

mturk,3cl243,snow_leopard77,3,Thu Jul 9 10:16:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not happy about the increased fees either, but this is not a loss to me personally. I rarely did anything for Crowdsource because their pay is way too low to be worth doing. Even for their writing HIT's, if you're good at writing and like doing those sort of articles (I don't), you can make much more elsewhere and get into freelance work on your own.

Click on any worker ID, then click on ""Bonus worker"".   The 10% (soon to be 20%) commission will apply.   You can advertise in your HIT description, or in the HTML of the HIT itself. Unfortunately, you will miss a lot of workers who search by reward amount, so your HIT visibility will be limited."

mturk,3cler4,studystack,2,Thu Jul 9 03:37:45 2015 UTC,You might just try increasing the required approval rate and min number of approved HITs to something like 99% approved and >1000 HITs.   That should filter out most the workers who aren't really trying to do a decent job.  I reject very few workers and I provide a makeup HIT that they can do to reverse the rejection.   Workers that made honest mistakes will fix what they did wrong.   The workers that were trying to scam you won't bother to contact you.
mturk,3cler4,hitsworth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:12:20 2015 UTC,You could use qualifications. Assign a qualification to people who have given you bad work. Then make all your hits not available to anyone that holds that qualification. This will prevent anyone known to you as a bad worker from doing your hits.

I also wonder what they will charge if you create a HIT with 10 or more assignments but then expire the HIT before you get 10.   Or if you create a HIT with less than 10 but then add more assignments later.   I suppose we'll have to wait and see how it was implemented because the documentation isn't very specific."

Once those ""Earn $0.30 for 30 minutes! Fast approval! Do this because it's fun and interesting!"" types leave and the overall HIT pay stops looking like cheap is normal, it's possible that the overall rate will go up."

Knowing my personal proficiency at certain common tasks helps, but so does experimenting on the ones I've never tried or might have different guidelines. Knowing how to utilize mturk search, related scripts, watching for quals, and monitoring requesters increases my chances of securing profitable work as well.

mturk,3ckwbh,tubedogg,2,Thu Jul 9 19:04:12 2015 UTC,Quantity over quality. Since I turk while at work I don't really have time for a 5-10+ minute survey. I'll gladly do a bunch of HITs in a row because I can stop at any time with no money/time wasted. I'd hate to be knee-deep in a 20 minute survey and have to do a job at work that takes me an hour and I wasted that time.   So that means that I could have 900 HITs at the end of the day but only about $25.

Search for ""survey"" or ""research"". You can sort by newest to see the most recently posted HITs.

Typed 7000 captchas  Successfully solved 6800 captchas  Solved in the way Amazon wants 4000 captchas  Captchas just seem so unnecessary. Theres too many other checks which would prevent bots from doing hits. Plus, if you can write a script to perform a hit, and the requester is willing to accept the work, whats the problem?"
mturk,3ccqir,turks24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:24 2015 UTC,What's the problem? Well some requester have batches that they'd rather not have to check every single one for pinpoint accuracy. It's good for us because they aren't nitpicking and rejecting us. Amazon guarantees them that they aren't being done via automated process
mturk,3ccqir,clickhappier,2,Tue Jul 7 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"That's true. But you're applying a blanket rule because of one small possibility of fraud. Eventually the worker running a bot is going to get caught and either reported to Amazon, get hit with a mass rejection that sinks their approval rating below what is required for most hits, or blocked by a few requesters and their account is suspended. It's not like you can simply create a new account if yours is suspended.   Theres also the option of only requiring captchas if a worker submits X number of hits from the same batch in a row. Or X number of hits from Y batches.   Whats to stop a worker from running a script but manually solving captchas?  How about get rid of captchas after a turker has a reasonable number of hits approved?  What makes someone with the masters qual so much more trustworthy?  I understand the point of having captchas, but it seems more like security theater than a necessary check on the system."
mturk,3cdxqu,AgoraApp,8,Tue Jul 7 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"I think you could use mturk for this project, but you might want to create some sort of paid qualification task to weed out anyone submitting subpar work.   Then, as long as you write out extremely detailed directions, I think it should be fine.   You might want to run a few test jobs to see how long it takes, and figure out a reasonable payment amount. Note that the payments listed on amazons website are extremely outdated (at least 7 years), and high quality workers may not want to work for that amount.  Masters is used to entice you with ""high quality,"" but that is just a gimmick to get you to pay more in fees. There are bad workers that are masters and bad workers that aren't. I think the qualification route would be the way to go"
mturk,3cdxqu,YACHOO,3,Tue Jul 7 04:11:24 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that workers generally don't like to not get paid for the time they spend researching dead ends. A general 'go out and find one that meets these criteria' from square one wouldn't really be a good fit compared to the clearly-defined granular nature of most tasks. I think it'd probably work better if you'd generate a starting list of candidate instagrammers somehow on your end, that could then be fed into a batch of HITs to be evaluated based on round 1 of your criteria, then the instagrammers that passed that round get fed into a new batch to be evaluated based on round 2 of your criteria, however many times, and then finally the winnowed-down fully-qualified instagrammers are checked for available email addresses (and allow workers to still get paid if the answer is 'n/a')."
mturk,3cdxqu,clickhappier,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:15:46 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this doesn't really make sense for me. I'm slightly more concerned with the number of leads rather than the quality. There really isn't a robust vetting process.

mturk,3cdxqu,electr0lyte,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:48:20 2015 UTC,"Ya I'm under the assumption that is a necessity. But it's also Instagram...with tens of millions of users, so I don't anticipate running into THAT many duplicate leads. Even for my criteria there are still so many options."
mturk,3cdxqu,xodus989,7,Tue Jul 7 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a necessity. It's not fair to reject workers for doing legitimate work simply because another worker happened to come up with the same result. But like you said, there are millions of users so hopefully you'd get a wide variety of results."
mturk,3cdxqu,electr0lyte,-2,Tue Jul 7 04:54:18 2015 UTC,He didn't say that he would reject the HIT's because they were duplicate though.  Pretty sure nobody would pick up his hits if they were rejected even though they followed the instructions to a T.
mturk,3cdxqu,electr0lyte,2,Tue Jul 7 06:54:35 2015 UTC,"It's happened plenty of times before that a requester with a project like this will accept the first submission and reject the other workers, even though workers have no idea what each other are submitting.  I was making sure he was aware that that would be poor practice and result in people not doing the work and negative Turkopticon reviews."
mturk,3cdxqu,electr0lyte,2,Tue Jul 7 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, that sounds like a reasonable project. I'm not familiar with Instagram, but does it require people to sign in with their own accounts in order to view the information you need? That might be one problem since you can't require MTurk workers to sign up for or log in to any other site in order to do a task.  For the cost effective bit, give this task to a friend who isn't familiar with your task and time them to do a few and see how long it takes them to find the information you need. Once you have a time estimate of how long a task takes, you can calculate an hourly wage out and decide how much you want to pay a worker for each task. Federal minimum wage is is $7.25. It ranges up to $15 in some places in the U.S. What would you be willing to work for to complete the task in the time you calculate that it takes?"
mturk,3cdxqu,electr0lyte,2,Tue Jul 7 04:06:33 2015 UTC,This is good advice. I may run into a road block with the login part because they do have to login to Instagram to effectively do the work. Technically you can use the web browser without logging in but it takes much longer and wouldn't really be worth it.   What If I just provide a login and password for everyone? And if you had to take a guess as to the hourly wage I could expect to pay what would you say? I really don't have much of an idea
mturk,3cdxqu,electr0lyte,5,Tue Jul 7 04:41:47 2015 UTC,"If you provided a login and password, that would be good. Or you could say the task is ONLY for workers who already have an Instagram account and are logged into it, but that's kind of a gray area and could potentially cut down on the number of workers who could do the task.  Most high quality, experienced workers who are able/willing to give you high quality results are going to look for at least minimum wage. It's hard to tell you what price to put on your task since I really have no concept of how long it would take to do what you're asking for. You'd need to write up a full set of detailed instructions and then have someone do a few test runs to find that out.  I like /u/YACHOO's idea of using the qualification system to get a set of workers who are trustworthy and can get good results for you."
mturk,3cdxqu,xodus989,0,Tue Jul 7 04:47:04 2015 UTC,awesome. And ya I guess I have to look more into the qualification system. Not yet familiar with how that works but I'll figure it out.   Minimum wage is a bit scary considering that at first guess I wouldn't think it would be that easy to get more than 10-15 leads per hour. I wish there was a way to pay per lead and not per hour.
mturk,3cdxqu,YACHOO,3,Tue Jul 7 04:51:50 2015 UTC,"I wish there was a way to pay per lead and not per hour.   Well, in a way, you are. You pay per HIT and each HIT would be one lead. However, when you set up your task, you need to set a price per HIT. You choose the amount you want to pay for that.  If you think a worker could do 10 leads per hour, that would be about 6 minutes per lead (HIT). As an example, a 6 minute HIT should pay $0.90 if your goal is to pay $9/hour."
mturk,3cdxqu,xodus989,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:58:43 2015 UTC,"What is stopping a worker from saying ""sorry but I only found 3 leads this hour"""
mturk,3cdxqu,ambyrjayde,6,Tue Jul 7 05:10:21 2015 UTC,"Workers aren't paid by the hour. They're paid by the HIT. Using my example pay structure from above:  A worker accepts one HIT with instructions to find one lead with a payment of $0.90. They search around, find a lead, and submit it to you and get paid $0.90. (The process takes your estimated time of 6 minutes and so they're earning the equivalent of about $9/hour.)  If the worker searches around and can't find anything, you'd have to decide how to handle that. You could tell them to submit it anyway, as long as they've given it a good effort, and pay them $0.90. Or you could tell them to return the HIT. Telling them to return the HIT is not going to be popular because it's a waste of a worker's time and effort to search around, do work, and then not get paid for it. But as you said earlier, there are millions of users so as long as your search criteria isn't really, really narrow, I doubt it'd come up very often that a worker would say that they couldn't find any matching users."
mturk,3cdxqu,withanamelikesmucker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"Any easy way to get around this is to setup a qualification.  Create a certification with two questions for .01 USD each.  Q1 would be, ""Do you have an instagram login that is valid and usable?."" Q2 would be, ""Do you know how to use and navigate the instagram app or webservice?""  If both are yes, create a qualification to only allow people with it to participate in your HITS. Otherwise decline the qualification and allow re-takes.  If the users creates one later and requests recert when they fit the criteria, that should be okay.    This way, you are not creating a requirement to create an account to do your HITS, but are requiring an account do do them."

mturk,3cdxqu,clickhappier,-8,Tue Jul 7 04:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you found your way over here.  If you're curious how the system works, I'd suggest you download turkassist and just try out a few HIT's (tasks) yourself and see how they work.  Here's a good tutorial that shows you how to install the script which shows what your hourly rate would be if you did the same task over and over. -- http://mturkforum.com/showthread.php?23412-Turk-Assist-HIT-Monitor-Tutorial  Say your task takes 4 minutes to complete. That would be 15 tasks  per hour that can be submitted.  If the user is looking for a 6 dollar an hour average for the task, you're looking at about .40 USD per lead.    You will take a hit in duplicates, but that's just a part of doing crowd sourcing.  You could also cut it down to .15 -.20 USD per lead (HIT) and just allow massive batches for people looking to simply push their numbers as well. There are MANY turkers who will work for pennies. (sign up and take a look at many of the .01 USD batches, they're worthless, but good to bring up your ratings and money).  Don't do masters. It's given out at random in a lottery system and anyone can get it at any level. It does not guarantee quality work.  If you're looking for quality work, you can request people with only things like 10,000 approved hits and a >98% approved ratio.  But this will push up the price."

There are MANY turkers who will work for pennies.   Why would you advocate this? Even if there are idjits willing to work for crap wages don't tell a requester ""Hey dude you should just pay us pennies, we'll do it"""
mturk,3cdxqu,clickhappier,6,Tue Jul 7 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"If I want to work for six bucks an hour, I'll go push buttons with pictures in a fast food joint, because six bucks an hour means no skill set.  Successful AMT have a large skill set and have to be computer savvy. Minimum wage workers don't.  FWIW, after the rate increases 7/22, a Masters batch is only going to cost 5% more than non-masters, and there is NO difference in pricing based on other qualifications (approved HITs/approval rating). Do keep in mind that this is not school and a 95% approval rating is not ""A"" work."
mturk,3cdxqu,withanamelikesmucker,3,Tue Jul 7 15:43:34 2015 UTC,"This is generally directed to OP to clear up a few things:   Say your task takes 4 minutes to complete. That would be 15 tasks per hour that can be submitted. If the user is looking for a 6 dollar an hour average for the task, you're looking at about .40 USD per lead.   Don't pay this little. Nobody wins when requesters try to pay workers $6/hr. AgoraApp, If you know what kind of account and data you want, you can create a qualification test w/ known answers to ensure people understand your task, and then confidently pay a fairer wage to those who pass the test.   If you're looking for quality work, you can request people with only things like 10,000 approved hits and a >98% approved ratio. But this will push up the price.   This is not true. HITs do not cost more if you require x number of approved HITs or a higher approval percentage. HITs DO cost more to use Masters workers. For this work I think your first objective should be to qualify workers for your task. But if you can't or won't do that, then a higher # of approved HITs and 99% approved accuracy rate may help."

mturk,3cb1s4,VusterJones,2,Wed Jul 8 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Nope, unfortunately not. You could contact the requester and ask them to show you what your answers were and why they were wrong. Some won't respond or won't want to bother retrieving your specific data, but some will."
mturk,3cb1s4,clickhappier,2,Mon Jul 6 14:54:39 2015 UTC,That stinks...you essentially just have to take their word for it?  I wonder if there is or could be some kind of plugin or script that saves an image of the HIT screen window when you click submit.

mturk,3c0lb2,timetogetpaid,3,Fri Jul 3 17:53:52 2015 UTC,Do you have any specific questions? I don't use hitscraper but I've been using turkmaster for awhile.
mturk,3c0lb2,internet_enthusiast,2,Fri Jul 3 17:58:18 2015 UTC,I really don't know how to use it or what the results mean
mturk,3c0lb2,internet_enthusiast,4,Fri Jul 3 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"Here is how I started to use it when I first installed it:  1) Think of all of your favorite requesters, the type who consistently posts well paying HITs (e.g. pickfu, wharton, sergey schmidt, etc.).  It comes pre-configured with some, like Agent Agent and Project Endor, but you can add others easily.  With your dashboard open in a separate tab, do a search for the requester's name.  If there is a hit currently available, you can then click on the requester's name, then click the grey ""watch this requester"" button that appears on the following screen.  This will pop-up a dialog box that will allow you to configure your search frequency, notification, and acceptance options when this requester posts hits.  If there are no hits by the requester, just click the grey ""watch this page"" button, which will pop-up a notification whenever there is a HIT available matching your search terms.  2)  Now that you've set up some requesters to watch, you can press the play button and turkmaster will perform all of the searches you've set up, and keep doing so as long as you like (until you press stop or close the tab).  When it finds an available HIT, it will pop-up a notification and you can preview or even autoaccept it directly from the notification.  3) As you continue turking, you can add quality new requesters to your watch list as you encounter them, eventually building up a solid list of the best requesters on mturk.  I hope that helps!"
mturk,3c0lb2,Taraalcar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:52:51 2015 UTC,yes this definitely does thank you

mturk,3c0lb2,KahTahDhen,3,Fri Jul 3 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"What's the little blue square you can click?   You mean the square below the start button for each requester?

mturk,3c0lb2,EdMan2133,3,Fri Jul 3 18:07:58 2015 UTC,You need the individual HIT's previewandaccept link in order to have it auto accept the HIT. You can't have it auto accept on a whole search result. Is that what you mean?

It's not adding them automatically, but it's quicker than opening the preview link and manually adding it.  I wish the script allowed for better sorting of your links as it gets pretty cluttered quick, especially when a requester has multiple HIT groups worth monitoring.

Alternating thumb and finger use for clicking reduces repetitive strain, I feel.

Previous/forward media for controlling VLC/Foobar2000/MPC globally Ctrl+Tab hotkeys are for tab switching in FF/Chrome Alt+Esc is the Windows shortcut for instant alt-tab-like window switching.  I used to have room for Shift-Alt-Esc, but not at the moment   I think that covers just about everything!

I eventually told them I was disappointed because I had always liked Amazon as a company and was extremely disappointed that I had to share this kind of bad news with my friends, and asked how to delete the account since it had suspended me from viewing my account info.

I'm just trying to do batches till I get to 10,000 and the occasional survey here and there, and I'm not even progressing very fast at that.

mturk,3bo7ru,smuckola,3,Wed Jul 1 09:25:21 2015 UTC,"It seems like the consensus is that ""not much changes"", but that wasn't true for me.  I feel like a number of well-paying academic requesters set their minimum number of approved HITs at 5000, so passing that threshold opened up a lot of surveys for me that I previously wasn't eligible for.  For instance this HIT that I posted recently (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups&searchWords=IU+SPH+longer&minReward=0.00&x=0&y=0) was a screener for a $15 survey that paid $1:30 and took less than 5 minutes."
mturk,3bo7ru,internet_enthusiast,2,Tue Jun 30 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure you get some that are over 5,000 and some of them pay really well.  There aren't many, though.  So, it's not like you're going to be seeing a significant jump in your MTurk income, unless you come across gems like that $15 HIT, which I'm in the middle of doing right now because I just got the email for the follow-up."

They were really polite when I emailed them with a couple of questions, and I've never had a HIT rejected.  Not great money or anything, but pretty safe for numbers in my experience.  Good luck!!"
mturk,3bo7ru,gallows3225,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. They are probably pretty tried and true. Sounds good and easy.  Now another question (maybe a variation on the same, with the same answer) would be....what is a simple and everpresent HIT which can be reliably done on a mobile touchscreen?  I imagine that a short survey would be good for that, but that's not nonstop-plentiful like receipt transcription is, and receipts are generally too complicated for a small touch interface. Long ago, I had briefly found one that asked me to rate the quality of OCR words. I could do those a minute at a time on a small iPhone, while I was waiting in line somewhere.  So what would be the equivalent of a three line grocery receipt transcription, for mobile touch devices? Would that same one be it?"

Did you not understand that you're supposed to submit a total of (up to) 5 unique photos per HIT to get a bonus?  ""Reward $0.07 per picture, up to $0.35 for taking 5 pictures per HIT.""  The $0.07 base pay is all you get for 1 photo per HIT. You can get an additional $0.07 as a bonus per each of up to 4 additional photos that meet the standards, a total of $0.28 possible bonus per HIT."

The FTC conducts investigations and brings cases involving endorsements under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which generally prohibits deceptive advertising. ... if there’s a connection between an endorser and the marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed. ... The most important principle is that an endorsement has to represent the accurate experience and opinion of the endorser: You can’t talk about your experience with a product if you haven’t tried it.

mturk,3bejm1,planetchad,3,Sun Jun 28 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"It seems like it would be easy for requesters to get around this. If they need 100 people to do a survey, just make a batch of 100 hits. They'd have to make a qual for ""Has not completed my hit xxx"" so that you wouldn't be able to accept more than one hit in the batch. What am I missing?"
mturk,3bejm1,trustypenguin,5,Sun Jun 28 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would be relatively easy to bypass like that, at the expense of making it harder for workers to find actual batches. Another of the numerous reasons Amazon needs to be convinced to drop this plan."
mturk,3bejm1,clickhappier,3,Sun Jun 28 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"It's not easy, and almost impossible to implement successfully.  I tried to do this about 2 months ago, here are the issues I ran into:   In order to have the qual auto-granted after the worker accepted the HIT, I had to use the API and an externalquestion structure. I then used my server to grant the qualification; however; The doesnotexist comparator is not available in the JAVA API; only in the GUI; however, The GUI does not support an externalquestion structure. I then tried using a qualification that was auto-granted upon request; then once the worker accepted the HIT, I had their qual score automatically reduce; however, There is a delay when granting/changing quals, so workers were able to accept the HIT several times before the qual change kicked in; and,  There was a visibility issue by making the qual auto-granted upon request - workers were not qualified for the HIT until they requested the qual, so it did not show on their radar.   In order to achieve what you are describing, the requester would have to use the GUI (in order to apply the reverse ""does not exist"" qual, and manually grant the qualifications (which is laborious and leaves the HIT open to abuse until the qual is granted).  I think it would be slightly less onerus for the survey requester to post the survey at $0.01 (and pay 40% commission), and then pay the remainder as a bonus (at 20% commission)."
mturk,3bejm1,symbiotic242,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"$0.01 (and pay 40% commission)   The minimum is going to be $0.01 per HIT (currently $0.005 per HIT), which is a 100% commission on penny HITs regardless of your assignment quantity on those. Still better than the alternatives, but it is more difficult for workers to find higher-paying HITs with this setup, and makes it much harder for workers to keep track of their projected earnings and who actually pays out the promised bonuses in a timely manner and who doesn't."
mturk,3bejm1,clickhappier,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:11:29 2015 UTC,Right. Forgot about the minimum fee.
mturk,3bejm1,symbiotic242,2,Thu Jul 2 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"They'd have to make a qual for ""Has not completed my hit xxx"" so that you wouldn't be able to accept more than one hit   They could do that, but they'd have to know how and I'm not sure many do; I've seen plenty of hits that say ""don't do this more than once."" Some use screeners but that would take/waste workers' time, over and over again.  Even if requesters decide to use this workaround the listings are going to be inundated with repeats (which I think is what CH just said but I'm not sure) - like the time my ""available hits"" went from 700 to something like 3,000 because one requester didn't know how to set up a batch.  I'm not a requester so I don't know how to set up a hit; maybe I'm not getting this right. But even without the extra costs the workarounds seem cumbersome and time-consuming, for requesters and workers. If Amazon really has thought this through I'm wondering if this new charge is their way of getting rid of the academics, for some reason."
mturk,3bejm1,kimadagem,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"You can accomplish this by using a custom qualification. The HIT would have a requirement that you have the qualification not assigned (i.e. Comparator=DoesNotExist), then when you finish it the first time it would grant you the qualification (thus locking you out of the rest of the batch from that point on).  As kimadagem said, it would make your available HITs inaccurate. It also assumes that the HIT is hosted by the requester (an ""external question"") and uses the API to send commands to Amazon. I believe most surveys that end up with a code are not like this, since a code would be completely unneeded if the HIT was already using the API to communicate with Amazon's system.  My company works this way, and we would be able to do a survey that got around the 40% rate, but my guess is that most researchers are not in that position."
mturk,3bejm1,TrevorNetmsi,2,Mon Jun 29 12:48:45 2015 UTC,"If you have the qualification = 0, the qual would have to be assigned, with a score of 0. So the qual would still have to be assigned in order to accept the HIT."
mturk,3bejm1,symbiotic242,2,Tue Jun 30 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah. You're correct. I was going on memory and had never looked into the exact API calls for this.  I edited my response. The QualificationRequirement object in the HIT creation call would need Comparator=DoesNotExist (and no IntegerValue set)."
mturk,3bejm1,TrevorNetmsi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:10 2015 UTC,Curious if you found a way to make this work?  The doesnotexist comparator is not available in the JAVA SDK.
mturk,3bejm1,symbiotic242,2,Tue Jun 30 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"I'm using PHP, which boils down to using CURL calls, so anything in the API docs (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/Welcome.html) can be done by manually forming the request data.  I haven't worked with this exact situation, but in the past when they added things I was able to start using it as soon as it was enabled in the API (which was great when they finally added reversing rejections to the API)."

mturk,3bejm1,symbiotic242,2,Tue Jun 30 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"It means a HIT where more than 10 people all get the same task.  Like surveys, there is usually 1 HIT available but many people can accept it and they all see the same HIT which is just a link to an external survey page and a box to enter the code from the survey.  Batches would not fall into the more then 10 workers category usually.  A batch might have hundreds or thousands of HITs and possibly each one can be done by 2 or 3 different people for redundancy and quality checking purposes.  But, unless the batch is set up so over 10 people can do each one for super redundancy or something, it wouldn't fall under the 40% thing.  This is why the academic research requesters are all up in arms about it."
mturk,3bejm1,jeff0jefferson,5,Sun Jun 28 15:04:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's correct. For more info, I've been collecting links at  http://www.reddit.com/r/MturkGate/"
mturk,3bejm1,clickhappier,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"I assume it is a HIT where more than 10 workers participate -- but it was worded strangely, I'm not sure."
mturk,3bejm1,TSolo315,0,Sun Jun 28 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"The way it's worded I would think it's a combination of either requiring more than 10 workers or a batch that has more than 10 HITs. But based on the fact that the only people being outspoken about it are academics conducting surveys (so they need well over 10 workers for their samples to be valid), I would say it only applies to ones requiring more than 10 workers.   But a lot of the requesters that offer batches also have alternatives to Mturk. Crowdsurf allows you to work directly through them, I think crowdsource and some of the others do too. So maybe the reason they haven't been is while Mturk is convenient for them, it's not absolutely necessary."

In the meantime the mods have been manually marking posts dead, but sometimes we get behind and the page ends up cluttered with dead posts. I usually spend some time each day cleaning up dead posts but I've been out of town for the past couple of days with only my smartphone and I'm not sure anyone picked up my slack.  Some responsibility also falls on the people posting HITs, as they have the ability to edit their own flair but rarely do so.  If hit_bot stays down much longer we may consider recruiting some new flair mods to help mark posts, but until then if you notice a post is dead leave a comment to let others know."

mturk,3be2x2,clickhappier,2,Mon Jun 29 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"make sure they are active daily    Yeah the ""active daily"" requirement is definitely the most essential and is also seemingly the most difficult to fulfill.  Most people who have been recruited as flair mods in the past haven't really lived up to their responsibilities.  I don't know if you noticed, but about a month ago wildncrazyguy (head mod) conducted a purge of the inactive mods that reduced the team by about half.  Even among the remaining mods, not all are nearly as active as I'd like.  So we'll probably be recruiting soon but I don't expect it to be a perfect solution."

Your only recourse is to message the requester and try to reason with him, and/or leave a TO rating.  Two problems I see with what the requester did:     He rejected a qualification HIT.  This goes completely against the spirit of a qualification HIT.  If workers don't complete the work accurately enough then don't give them the qual, but the requester shouldn't be rejecting a qualification HIT.   You (presumably) completed the HITs in good faith, and according to the instructions, and he rejected the HITs because he uploaded the wrong pictures.  That's just not kosher."
mturk,3bbvpz,jeff0jefferson,5,Sat Jun 27 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"Occasionally some inexperienced requester rejects for their own screwups like that.

That could have been because until a couple of weeks ago I was still using a Motorola Droid (Droid 1). I don't know why they want to stop people from using a touch screen; a lot of people with Windows 8 have touch screens and I haven't seen any HITs precluding that. I think the issue is the screen size/resolution (it was really hard to do surveys on that 3.7"" screen)."
mturk,3b9jz5,kimadagem,2,Sat Jun 27 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"If the HIT title/description/preview didn't indicate that there was going to be a potentially-unpaid screener, I think you're 'allowed' to give it a 1 for pay, if you clearly state the screener's undisclosed nature."
mturk,3b9jz5,clickhappier,2,Sat Jun 27 02:27:48 2015 UTC,"The screener was disclosed, and they did say it would be 3 minutes, which was right on target. I went ahead with it because I didn't know if I would pass. But in hindsight, especially looking at the pay, there's no way this would have paid decently. I need to think more about that in the future.  For hits with undisclosed screeners I usually rate communication low because to me that's the problem - a lack of communication. But I know others use pay.  I'll probably leave this one the way it is. At least people will know the requester wasn't overestimating on the screener time."
mturk,3b9jz5,jeff0jefferson,2,Sat Jun 27 04:05:06 2015 UTC,"I would rate pay a 1.  Since you got paid $0.00 for 3 minutes of your time.    Definitely not fairness, because the fairness rating is for ""fairness giving rejections"" not ""overall fairness"""
mturk,3b9jz5,Rand4m,2,Sat Jun 27 21:38:09 2015 UTC,"IIRC, you can put in something in TO for a hit you don't even do by selecting 'Report your experience for this Requester'.  Include at least the Hit Name; it's not a TOS violation; be sure to mention that you have done 'None' hits for this Requester (assuming you return the hit, rather than doing it); select 'N/A' for each category, then enter what you want to say under 'Please briefly describe your experience with this requester:'. I've done this on multiple occasions to alert people that a Requester has changed his name. Workers have no problem dissing a Requester for an unpaid screener."
mturk,3b9jz5,pwicca,3,Sun Jun 28 08:18:42 2015 UTC,"I think that it would fall under fairness, not pay, but you're not allowed to rate fairness unless you completed the HIT and were rejected.

mturk,3b7cgo,neuroguy6,6,Fri Jun 26 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that seems odd that they can re-take - surveymonkey has a default setting that allows only 1 response per computer.  http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Collector-Options  You could try using a custom qualification and creating a HIT that contains a screener survey. For example, create a screener survey in MTurk and offer a nominal reward. Ask a half dozen questions, being sure to hid your true intentions. From the results, identify workers who meet your criteria and grant them a custom qualification.   For your real survey, restrict it to workers who have been granted your custom qualification. That way, only workers you have identified can access your HIT.  If you have signed up for Amazon Web Services, you can create a qualification test using the API that will automate the entire process, instead of having to manually grant the qualification."

I can't see what they are because I blocked them because I got tired of every single HIT needing a different qualification and once you got that qualification there were no more HITs available and you needed the same qualification but at higher level (or a slightly different one) to do the ones that were there but you couldn't get them unless you'd completed enough HITs at your current qualification to earn the other ones.   Did you mean Crowdsurf; the one that will pay an $80 dollar weekly bonus if you complete 1000 HITs but only has 35 HITs available unless you count the ones that require six different qualifications (none of which are auto approved or you can acquire by passing a test)?

mturk,3b5czt,sprinklenoms,4,Fri Jun 26 02:38:50 2015 UTC,"From what I've learned Masters is probably earned by completing ""secret"" HITs that pass for your normal HITs and if you do them (and do them well) and you pass maybe a minimum threshold then they grant you masters. This accounts for the disparity between people earning Masters at under 10k approved and people without Masters at over 150,000+ (like myself). It's a whole lot of luck.  I guess the point of the phrase ""high degree of accuracy across a variety of Requesters"" they are basically saying that if you do a variety of HITs you are likely to eventually stumble upon our Masters HITs. If you're only doing HITs from certain requesters the chances of earning Masters is slim to none because those aren't going to be the ""special"" ones.   Again, all the above is just conjecture, but at this point I don't see how else they could be granting masters because it sure as hell isn't based off stats or even number of different requesters or approval ratings.

mturk,3b50ac,MarciTX,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:30:11 2015 UTC,I added it up a couple of days ago and I think it added up to around $275 that ive made exclusively with vision turk this month. Love it.
mturk,3b50ac,MarciTX,2,Sat Jun 27 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"That is awesome! If they were a daily requester, I would do them exclusively! How many do u do per day when they're up? I try to AT LEAST get $25/day out of them."
mturk,3b50ac,MarciTX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:00:12 2015 UTC,"Well no matter what I usually try to do 100 HITs a day, even without visionturk so I am for that with them as well. Last time they had a batch though I did 200 in a day, 2 days in a row."
mturk,3b50ac,MarciTX,2,Sun Jul 12 15:47:52 2015 UTC,200 in a day yields good money with them.  Isn't it cool how they are prepared to pay us thousands if we do it?  They have a HUGE batch up now that should last a few days.  Excited! Lol they are n my top fav requesters list.
mturk,3b50ac,MarciTX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"Its amazing! And yes its A HUGE batch up right now, its a little different though.

mturk,3b1h40,madisondaoutlaw,3,Thu Jun 25 05:10:46 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty justified to me.  He asked for ideas for luxury or exotic activities.  You gave him a hotel and basically told him to ask the concierge.
mturk,3b1h40,jeff0jefferson,3,Thu Jun 25 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, I get where he's coming from but he also didn't give very much information so he can't expect a LOT.  I have seen several ""luxury corporate events"" that were held in 5 star luxury hotels, so I just went based off of experience.  Guess I just effed up thinking experience would be better than googling ""exotic activities in Shanghai"" and writing down the first 5 results.  shrug  I'm not asking him to reverse the rejection.  I think he's totally justified if he just didn't like my idea since I basically went the safe route.  I am just hoping that in the future he might actually give more details about what he wants."

I looked up some really upscale lounge in Shanghai that had a specific page where they could book corporate events.  I did stray away from hotels because it seemed like he wanted something more specific than that, however that was me using my own thinking, it wasnt specified in the HIT."

mturk,3ayjtc,timberfore,3,Wed Jun 24 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"Well lately I've just been doing private qualification stuff with requesters that I have been watching/working for since the beginning. There's still a bunch of Masters tasks I watch for and do if they come up it's just rare these days.  But to answer your question, if I was going to look for work then yes, I would only do Masters work. I haven't done a non-masters task (besides private qualification) in...at least 1.5 years.   Basically one day I decided non-masters wasn't worth it. Either it is low-paying and not worth it, reasonable-paying but risk of rejections, or it is high paying, but that means it is gone so quickly that you can't make anything worthwhile. Even in that 2013 screenshot I was probably mostly only working on Masters. A lot of the times while people were going crazy over some big non-Masters batch I would be chipping away at some small batch on Masters that I could make twice as much on. Brand new requesters using Masters were always my favorite."

I may even have a screenshot of my first days where I would work for like 8 hours on ProductRnR (the first requester I ever worked for) to make like $15 bucks. I remember being miserable and have no idea how I convinced myself to stick with it.  Anyway, I have screenshots to the beg of time of both 45-days and the main account screen. Would be interesting to get them all transcribed and graphed to see the decline and where changes Amazon makes can be seen in it."
mturk,3ayjtc,auralgasm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:19:03 2015 UTC,What HITs were you doing recently where you reached 1934 in one day? In a 16-hour period that's about 2 per minute.
mturk,3ayjtc,ColdFire98,2,Wed Jun 24 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"A huge batch of an old requester where you just decide if a website is an online store, and then the other half was just searching a UPC and getting a product title.  And it was nowhere near 16 hours. That amount was like 4-5 hours that day. If you are new you are looking at it all wrong. There have been a handful of days I have reached the the 3,800 max. I mean...all HITs take different amounts of time. There are things that you can average a HIT every couple of seconds and pay less and things that take longer and pay more."

I benefit from working for Mturk, I started last year and I saw it as great potential for working online and generating income. I would not want it to change to the point where it becomes similar to other work at home sites where it is impossible to make money as with mturk, money comes easy if you do the right batches and have a high approval rating.  It is hard enough with some of the requesters having low paying hits & rejecting quality hits and now it is going to be harder to find decent hits if a good requester leaves, especially a requester with decent batch hits and/or quality surveys."

mturk,3aw0xu,FrankPapageorgio,2,Wed Jun 24 09:04:23 2015 UTC,"Oh great.  So it's cheaper to do Masters Qual HITs, which is now not that much more than a non Masters Qual HIT.  Why the fuck would a requester do a non Masters Qual HIT?  On a $1.00 HIT, it would be 24 cents vs. 29 cents.  As opposed to 10 cents vs. 30 cents as it was now.  There goes like... all the viable for non Masters people aside from big batches."
mturk,3aw0xu,thewebsiteguy,0,Thu Jun 25 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"I just started turking. Can someone explain what is going to happen to the workers like I'm 5? I am 20 days in and have made about $400 and have been loving it so far but I read this news today and I am extremely saddened. But I am not sure if I should be or not or at least to which degree I should be (right now I'm pretty bummed out). Does this mean that since they are now going to be taking 20%, that $400 is going to be more like $200 (since they are doubling) for the same work done?"
mturk,3aw0xu,turkinjoe,2,Wed Jun 24 04:26:15 2015 UTC,"I think it is going to be bad and I know you don't want to hear that. If I am reading the new structure right, any type of work that someone collects more than 10 HITs for is going to be 40%. This is compared to 10% that it is now. That is a CONSIDERABLE difference. That is a large enough fee that there are going to be a lot of new requesters (which I have learned is where you can really make the most money on) checking out mturk and looking for an alternative, not even giving it a second thought. Further, long-term requesters that have a worker base on a private qualification are, again if I am reading it right, jumping from 10% to 40%. What would you do? I would be upset. It is either going to cause pay to drop significantly (overall, not in every case) or it is going to cause requesters to leave completely.  That is how it affects the requesters. Here is one way people might not be thinking that it affects the workers. Masters was once coveted. Better work, better pay (for some things at least). For me, I got Masters, I would find new requesters and do a lot of work for them, find out they had hundreds of thousands of queries to do and get on their private qualification. Less amount of other workers means more work per worker, more money for me to make. This was an advantage to both the worker and the requester, because the requester's fee dropped from 30% (with Masters) to 10% (private qualification). Now there is little push for the requester to do this. It is a drop from 45% to 40%.   Tldr - I think that it wont be immediately noticeable but over a few months work will get less and less. Pay is going to, overall, become less and less. Requesters that do stay with mturk are going to drop prices. New requesters will never consider how much a worker can make - when considering what to pay they wont be thinking about how much the worker makes, but how much they have to pay after the fee.   Overall I think it is going to look pretty bad. Maybe not at first, but I can almost guarantee you that some of the long-term requesters are already looking for alternatives. Those fees add up quick."
mturk,3aw0xu,auralgasm,2,Wed Jun 24 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"You don't completely understand who the 40% fee affects. It's going to be almost exclusively academic requesters. When they say a HIT for 10 people, they don't mean a batch with 10 or more HITs in it, they mean 1 HIT that 10 people can do -- like a survey.   We are going to see academic requesters leaving en masse and the ones that stay will drop their pay like a stone. Academic surveys tend to make up the bulk of the money that new workers make, and this is going to hit new, inexperienced and unknowledgeable turkers the hardest by far. Surveys are going byebye, adios, sayonara.  The increase from 10% to 20% for non-survey HITs may not affect things as much as people think. It's hard to say for sure and only time will tell. Masters HITs are already 20% and there is PLENTY of volume for master's workers, some of it very high paying, so a 20% fee does not necessarily dissuade requesters from posting good work. However, because requesters now only have to consider a 5% fee increase for masters, there may in fact be MORE work that is master's-only. Right now, if they want master's workers, they are going to pay twice as much to Amazon (20%, from 10%.) But in July, they will only have to pay 25% instead of 20%, and many may find this an acceptable jump. This, again, will greatly impact new workers. And, of course, there will definitely be some requesters who stay away or cut pay rather than pay an extra 10% to Amazon.  Basically, the barrier to entry to Mturk, which was already pretty high, is going to become even more daunting. You're not going to be able to make money on it unless you have built up a history and are good at what you do (or willing to improve your skills to become more efficient.) Even then, without surveys, it's going to be tough going some days if you don't have the master's qual or some good closed quals."
mturk,3aw0xu,turkinjoe,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"Apparently I did completely misread it then. That is not worrisome at all to me in that case. I in no way want to tell other people what to do and I know a lot of people love surveys, but I still maintain they are a waste of time, even if they pay good. I can count on both hands the number of surveys I have done over a million HITs. I just don't see why people focus so much attention on them. For instance I got a message in my inbox from someone saying they have been at this for years and are amazed at some of the stats I posted and can't see how it is possible, then stated they mainly do surveys. It just baffles me that so much focus is put on surveys and I don't understand why even a little bit. - end rant"
mturk,3aw0xu,withanamelikesmucker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, either. Amazon is raising rates for the .3% ""research"" HITs, which are the worst HITs - low paying, broken, stupid rejections, the list goes on. Who wouldn't want them forced out? I know I do."
mturk,3aw0xu,scientific_derp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"The actual change to the cost of HITs for requesters is 27%. Currently, 9% of what requesters spend goes to Amazon. The remaining 91% goes to workers. For example, if I post a HIT that pays $90 to workers, I'll pay $99 total, including the $9 that goes to Amazon. Starting in month, survey requesters will pay 29% of their money to Amazon and 71% to workers. So if want to spend the same amount, $99, I could only pay about $70.69 to workers. That would cost me about $28.27 in Amazon fees, bringing me up to just about $99 spent overall. This is a difference of $19.31 ($90 - $70.69) in worker pay, or about 21.5%. If the payments to workers were $400 and a researcher did not increase their budget at all, only $314.16 would be available for worker payments next month.   These figures assume that requesters will spend exactly the same total amount under the new scheme. I don't think this is a reasonable assumption. Some requesters will be able to increase their budgets, though not necessarily by the full 27% needed to make up the difference. Some requesters will investigate alternatives. Workers will, too. And some requesters do not post survey HITS and will experience a much less dramatic increase in fees."

On the right hand side of the first page I think there should be something that says verify your bank account. If not there, go to account settings and look for manage bank accounts.   Click the verify account link and it should take you to a page asking you to input the deposit amounts. You'll have to check your online statement to get the amounts.  If that is not the case then I don't know what the problem is, but I don't know of them doing anything other than asking you to verify the deposit amounts."

Some bank accounts are able to electronically verify immediately, I guess both of mine were; in fact, I recall getting a message on my screen right after I added each one that they were able to do so right then.  Maybe you need a better bank. One of the ones I use only needed $1.00 to open it & I did it online by transferring $1.00 from my old account to it. I think I added to Amazon within a week of opening it, so it's probably not that yours is too new but an issue with that actual bank.  One other possible thing it could be...are you the only person on the account? If you opened a joint one with your parents that could be an issue. They may be listed as the primary account holder."

mturk,3ashq0,itsmyotherface,4,Tue Jun 23 15:44:13 2015 UTC,It's 40% for the survey type of HITs that the academic requester who started this post is concerned about. Surveys are hardly rare.
mturk,3ashq0,neo_star,5,Tue Jun 23 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"Hey folks, another requestor here.  If you like doing academic surveys on AMT, it would probably help the cause if you let them know that this change is not good for workers.   Here's a contact form: https://requester.mturk.com/contactus  And their twitter account: https://twitter.com/amazonmturk"
mturk,3ashq0,MrLegilimens,6,Tue Jun 23 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, MTurks customer service on the worker side is non-existent. For everyone who will leave the site over this, there are 100 more who are willing to do 15 minutes HITS for a penny. As long as requesters don't leave en masse (the ones that have thousands of HITS up daily), amazon doesn't care."
mturk,3ashq0,Rand4m,3,Tue Jun 23 17:19:18 2015 UTC,It is very difficult to find a equal competitor for AMT. I mean mturk has diversified over the years. Large enough sample space for researchers. I guess changes would be reverted after all this outrage.

mturk,3arx7y,Atroxa,9,Tue Jun 23 04:02:35 2015 UTC,"heh, twitter is calling it #mturkgate  I can see this being bad for the platform, more so than blocking international requester sign ups."
mturk,3arx7y,dembatchez,9,Tue Jun 23 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"Summary from Amazon:    Amazon Mechanical Turk’s base commission will be 20% with a $0.01 minimum per transaction. This commission applies to HIT reward amounts and any bonuses paid to Workers. HITs requiring 10 or more assignments will incur an additional 20% commission above the base commission. These HITs comprise less than 0.3% of Mechanical Turk’s overall HITs, and are most commonly used by Requesters to survey Workers and conduct market research. The incremental commission for using Masters Workers will decrease to 5%, making it even easier for Requesters to access the marketplace’s highest-rated Workers.   New pricing structure: https://requester.mturk.com/pricing"
mturk,3arx7y,Motivation54,11,Tue Jun 23 00:47:19 2015 UTC,"As someone who runs academic studies, having to pay 40% commission to Amazon seems a bit extreme.  Given most academics generally have set research budgets, this means requesters will be stuck either running less studies, paying less, or using other platforms.  Definitely not ideal for anyone."
mturk,3arx7y,kimadagem,7,Tue Jun 23 01:10:53 2015 UTC,I think many academic requesters will agree with you.  If you go somewhere else could you please let us know? I'll follow you.
mturk,3arx7y,TSolo315,3,Tue Jun 23 01:32:39 2015 UTC,"It's probably not too hard to circumvent the 40% fee deal, simply by spreading the assignments over multiple HITs.  Double the fees still sucks though."
mturk,3arx7y,omniborous,2,Tue Jun 23 05:45:54 2015 UTC,"So: 1. Penny hits will be batched together because of the minimum commission 2. More people will use masters by default, and if masters gives above a five percent boost in quality, everyone will use it. Hard to say if there's enough active masters to do all of the extra work 3. People who do surveys will have to pay a much higher fee, but this won't make mturk much more money because of the low volume (???)"
mturk,3arx7y,verifiedshitlord,2,Tue Jun 23 01:42:55 2015 UTC,it seems like surveys take up far more than the 0.3% amazon is claiming. More like 15%.
mturk,3arx7y,clickhappier,3,Tue Jun 23 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"It's impossible for us to accurately estimate the impact of surveys from the outside, unfortunately; only Amazon knows how many HITs x assignments are really posted, and they don't share."

I've done 4500 approved description HITs and have never had a problem.   I recently emailed the contact I have at Pitchbook (the company that posts the description HITs) and he clarified they are getting much more selective on how they approve HITs. They want absolutely no marketing language, or ""fluff"" in the HITs at all. This is a subjective requirement, and can be hard to fulfill depending upon your writing style, in my opinion.  I just wanted to post the information he gave me, in hopes it could be of some help to the community. I'm not saying the way they are rejecting is right or wrong, I just wanted to post some info that could be of help in people not getting rejected in the future."
mturk,3aqq02,itsjustjibe,2,Wed Jun 24 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for contributing to the discussion.  I hear what you're saying, but I would gently respond that (a) I did not include fluff, by my subjective opinion--I took great care to complete the HITs as posted and (b) even if 1 or 2 of them don't meet their subjective criteria, it is not excusable to mass-reject all of a worker's HITs.  You might pass this on to your contact. Additionally, you might pass on to them that not only are screening the submitted HITs in a way that is considered unfair, but also they may want to look at their inputs--a lot of the companies they are screeing are non-profits, school districts, etc. for which they could have a checkbox or pre-written script that one enters. They might also have a checkbox for if the website is invalid or erroneous in some way.  This would both help them meet their goals, and prevent worker disappointment."
mturk,3aqq02,clickhappier,3,Wed Jun 24 13:45:44 2015 UTC,"I will pass this on and post the reply I receive. I've long wondered why they would be interested in non profits and school districts. Doesn't seem central to the stated purpose of the company. I can only imagine they discard them at some point in the review process.   I do know they have an internal QA team and all HITs go under manual review at some point long after they are approved. Every HIT is looked at. I can't speak to their rejection/approval policy, however. I've thought it could be a good idea if they just create a qualification they can assign to workers whose work they like, and let them finish out the remainder of the batch. This has been passed on as well.   Again, I'll update as I receive replies."

They are planning on taking a break from MTurk in order to reformulate their HITs. I'm not sure how long that will be for. I was told this would start tomorrow. From what I've come to understand they are not satisfied with the quality on some of the submissions, and want to move to a new method of assigning HITs. They are looking toward assigning qualifications based on a workers past performance. At least that is the impression I received.   So that's what I've learned. When they do come back to MTurk I'm assuming they will have a new system in place that will make it easier for them to curate acceptable submissions."

mturk,3arhkv,wehaveadreamer,3,Mon Jun 22 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"It's probably the fact that by the time HITs get posted on that subreddit, they've already been up for grabs on MTurk for seconds, minutes, or longer. People have already snagged a lot of them by the time someone shares them on HWTF."
mturk,3arhkv,electr0lyte,0,Mon Jun 22 22:37:28 2015 UTC,Is there criteria I should be searching directly on mTurk to get good HITS?
mturk,3arhkv,electr0lyte,3,Mon Jun 22 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to do. If you like transcription, search for that. If you like writing, search for that. If you like surveys, search for that. You can sort various ways. I like to sort by ""newest first"" to see the newest posted HITs. You can also try sorting by most HITs available to find batches. It really depends on what kind of HITs you want to do."

mturk,3arhi0,PokerBoySwag,2,Mon Jun 22 22:33:23 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're getting that error; I don't do that account's HITs because of its blocking habits and underpayment expectations. Be glad it's just a persistent error instead of a block. It may mysteriously be back to normal tomorrow.
mturk,3arhi0,clickhappier,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:45:00 2015 UTC,Well it's been doing this a few times actually.. but it usually clears up after about 20 minutes or so and I am able to finally do them but nope not today.

I didn't know this, so thanks for mentioning it. But could someone please explain how a hit can't be returnable?  I've already blocked several of the Google requesters just because of their ""Oops sorry, you've done too many of our hits"" messages that show up after I accept them, but if they're doing something else I might want to avoid all of them."
mturk,3arhi0,kimadagem,3,Tue Jun 23 01:36:14 2015 UTC,"Of course you can return it but if you do it will lock you out of all Google requester Hits for the remainder of the time left on the Hit. For example, say you are doing an Endore with a 60 minute timer, you return it, you are then locked out of all Google requesters for 60 minutes. It is worth trying to do your best and complete the Hit... Google usually pays well. Some people avoid them because of the different errors and that is perfectly fine. Everybody has their favoritesand with the wide variety of tasks, thats what makes MTurk great!"

I've managed to fix the issues you mention in this video, and improve the ranking order based on confidence given the review density, rather than a straight ascending/descending list based on which number is greater. Here's a teaser!  I've also made a few interface changes, greatly extended theming support, and added an export feature for Reddit use, specifically adhering to /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor standards.  I'll be making a post when I'm done cleaning things up, but when I do, I would greatly appreciate if you could look things over and merge them into the official distribution."

mturk,3aoba0,Rand4m,3,Tue Jun 23 04:34:44 2015 UTC,"Just in case you don't know, be sure to message p9r asking if they can tell you what you did wrong, and if there's any chance they could reverse it. P9r is the only requester I have ever had rejections from, but they have all been reversed, even when it was actually my fault. So I still have my 100%. I still don't like getting rejected at all, so now if I do their HITs I completely avoid any vague instructions or anything I'm not sure about. But they're really good about reversing rejections, and they're really polite, so definitely try to get them reversed."

In here, I show you what to remove from a database export of your hitDB to fix the pesky hit numbers do not match issue. This shouldn't be necessary for most people (who the patch worked for I put out earlier), but it will be helpful for people who still have the issue and/or the patch doesn't work.  An important note, the hitDB I wrote still only works for chrome. I haven't had the time to do a firefox edition.

While I don't have specific tax info I can tell you that 1. it's not so much how much extra you make ($1,010 is the max per month though) it's whether or not they consider it ""gainful employment"". If you make $50 per month roofing houses they will no longer consider you disabled, the extra income has nothing to do with it. 2. The problem with actually talking to Soc. Sec. isn't that they'll screw you over, it's that very few of them really know the right answers.

They try 6 ways from sunday to get you cut off of it. As long as its under the reporting limit for ssdi, and you pay taxes on your mturk money it should be fine but thats why i said ask H&R block or some CPA they would know better but I believe from what people i know on SSDI if your not currently paying taxes on SSDI then i dont believe it will make it taxable if you do make some money off of mturk, just your self employement stuff. Thou again talk to a CPA. If you ask SSDI they might see it as you can work and cut you off. The H&R block website said if you stay under 25k total income your SSDI stays untaxable."

Self-employment tax (SSDI & Medicare) however is supposed to be paid if your net earning are more than $400.

mturk,3aeips,symbiotic242,2,Fri Jun 19 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know the details, but I've seen some requesters use qualifications for that.

mturk,3aeips,ColdFire98,3,Fri Jun 19 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"There's a qual ""has not been granted"" setting that's good for this situation. Would need to release the different surveys separately, with enough time in between them for the requester to assign the quals to the people who did the previous version.  It sounds like in this case, the requester could just use branching ('skip logic') within surveymonkey to run all four surveys simultaneously from the same HIT, instead, sending 1/4 of the participants to each one of the four versions."

mturk,3ac7h9,electr0lyte,2,Mon Jun 22 20:12:50 2015 UTC,Be careful with this requester. I received an email a few days ask asking me to complete the map 2.0 HIT. I completed it and it was approved and paid and then I received an email from Amazon stating techlist had hard blocked me.   I'm not saying that the requester isn't to be trusted or is engaging in shady activities. But I have over 1200 HITS approved with no rejections and now a hard block...
mturk,3ac7h9,enderkg,2,Sun Jun 21 16:03:55 2015 UTC,Someone else on MTurkGrind just reported receiving a block email as well. :(

Should additional requesters block you in the next few months, we may suspend your account."" Ridiculous because it was a penny HIT. Not losing any sleep over this, however.  Edit: I submitted results to techlist multiple times, so the block was warranted. There may not have been another way to prevent retakes like there is now."

BTW, agreed about the lack of connection between approval and blocks, primarily because much work is approved automatically.

mturk,3ac7h9,clickhappier,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"A very small number of workers submitted their location multiple times. Answering twice might be innocent. Four times is not an accident.  To keep the peace here I'll unblock /u/WestCoastTurk and /u/enderkg (both please PM me your workerIDs), but for the record anyone submitting duplicate answers that are obviously not of any help to the requester is asking to be blocked. The requester could use other means to prevent duplication, but taking advantage of the chance to repeatedly submit the same answer is a choice and a bad one. Almost all workers are aware and ethical enough not to do this.  If the above doesn't apply to you and you were blocked in error please let me known and I'll correct it."

Like they should get together and be like we already did this lets research different things.   A lot of times, they aren't researching to find anything new.  It's students who are using MTurk to practice doing research for a class. Every semester, there's a new batch of students so the assignments repeat and we see the same things again. It's always the same questions because those are proven experiments and proven scales that are already calibrated and understood. If the student gets the same results, the teacher knows they did the experiment on MTurk correctly."

If you take a research methods class, you're going to learn the same information about how to conduct research that students who previously took the class learned. The teacher will teach the same proven research methods every semester to the new students that come in. If a Research 101 class is meant to teach students how to do basic research using proven research questions, why would the teacher ""progress"" and start teaching something different to next semester's new Research 101 students?"

It's very hard to make more than $6 an hour, even more so to make that consistently. And even with a part-time job, you gain experience and references - which future employers like. I suspect even waiting tables is more impressive than turking on a resume. Mturk can help in a jam, but this is a good age to grab any and all references/experiences that you can."
mturk,3ack6z,snow_leopard77,4,Fri Jun 19 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"If you have to depend on making money to pay bills, get a job and Turk on the side.  There are times during the year when there's not a lot of work available (if you're working on surveys, which pay well).  Good luck."

Some of the HITs are worth the one penny, especially the ones where you only have to transcribe or click for one entry. Personally, I do them because they come in large batches, and my current HIT numbers are low (~725 accepted, with >1% reject), it seems like all the really decent-paying batches/surveys start to become available when you hit the 1000 mark."

mturk,3a77tu,ambyrjayde,2,Thu Jun 18 01:34:00 2015 UTC,Why use the second screen when you can just go to AdultNetHITs and do the ol' Turk 'n' Fap?
mturk,3a77tu,MeltingGlacier,2,Thu Jun 18 04:26:16 2015 UTC,This changes everything.
mturk,3a77tu,ambyrjayde,6,Thu Jun 18 13:31:02 2015 UTC,"Let's take it a step further:  I bet there's at least one guy on MTurk that can only get off if he's making money while fapping.  'Yeaaah, gimme that nickel, bitch!  I am SO marking this one adult even though it's borderline....'  ...Uhm, anyway, if I have time this weekend, I was thinking of starting a thread to help people be more efficient and give some ideas for how a dual+ monitor setup can increase Turking efficiency and enjoyment.  Sounds really smart now, huh?"

mturk,3a77tu,boofwad,0,Wed Jun 17 23:47:44 2015 UTC,A very intriguing reply.
mturk,3a77tu,internet_enthusiast,5,Wed Jun 17 22:53:00 2015 UTC,"I got a second monitor recently, mainly to make 411Richmond transcriptions faster. I open the enlarged image of the receipt on one monitor and key into the HIT fields on the other one. No more tabbing back and forth or having to stop and use the magnifier has really sped up the process for me. Then someone told me about the wonderful PandA trick and now  I use the 2nd monitor to keep my PandAs on as well."
mturk,3a77tu,BlueMoods,2,Thu Jun 18 03:35:28 2015 UTC,I only do surveys and I have tried two monitors and I don't feel it really helps me all that much.  I imagine Batch work would benefit a lot more.  Most of the time I used my other monitor for music or other non mTurk stuff.
mturk,3a77tu,texaskevin06,2,Fri Jun 19 02:43:24 2015 UTC,"Having 2 definitely increased my efficiency and productivity. Personally, I use 4 off a desktop and a laptop on the side. My wife hates it <grin>"
mturk,3a77tu,symbiotic242,2,Wed Jun 17 20:49:27 2015 UTC,I use 2. It's way better. You should switch to 2 immediately :)

mturk,3a77tu,clickhappier,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"I use just one. It's a monitor attached to a laptop so I could probably use two, if I could figure out how to turn the laptop screen on. But I do mostly surveys and would find it very hard to concentrate on the questions if I had something going on on the other screen. I'm pretty good at multitasking normally but I wouldn't try it on MTurk."

mturk,3a6oqw,clickhappier,5,Wed Jun 17 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"Phishing, malware-spreading attempts, earning from ad view/clickthrough-fraud, and/or signup commissions for the sites they funnel you to. These blatant scam HITs aren't surveys with any 'data' of that sort to keep (there are some relatively-rare surveys who seem to reject just about everybody, but their true motives are unknown... no question about the aforementioned types)."
mturk,3a6oqw,clickhappier,3,Wed Jun 17 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"The 'best' kind of scam HITs are the ones that were going around a few months ago that always used fake Submit buttons in the HIT - so they'd trick people into doing their junk and not pay you for it, but at least it'd be because you wouldn't be able to submit it, instead of submitting it and then getting stuck with a rejection.  PS: Contacting the requester on one of these HITs is pointless, and just ensures that they get ahold of your email address if you didn't already give it to them during the HIT."
mturk,3a6oqw,internet_enthusiast,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"Contacting the requester on one of these HITs is pointless, and just ensures that they get ahold of your email address if you didn't already give it to them during the HIT.

mturk,3a6oqw,clickhappier,4,Thu Jun 18 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"They absolutely do see your email address, and your MTurk account name, in addition to your worker ID. When (if) a requester replies to you, the reply comes directly from their email address to your email address. MTurk doesn't remain an intermediary in the messaging like, for example, Ebay does."

There was one guy who was the same scammer who popped up every few months with a new name, but with the same type of hit. Thankfully with turkopticon they can be weeded out before they do damage."

mturk,3a62yq,earnonlineaccount,2,Thu Jun 18 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"The only kind of record keeping I'm actively doing is trying to request payments around the same time every week, or perhaps every two weeks.  Ideally, the transfer amount will match up to my earnings in the weekly activity email. There may be temporary discrepancies depending on when the earnings report gets generated vis-a-vis additional approvals and the exact time I transfer my earnings.  Adding up several weeks should usually help the numbers match more precisely. [I'm not saying I do this constantly, but it's nice to have an easy way to check it.]  I know people like HitDB and the like, but I haven't really looked at them.  To help with taxes, yearly earnings are provided by Amazon at the end of the year. If you're good at math, you can deduce how much you've earned this year by subtracting the previous-years earnings from your total earnings."
mturk,3a62yq,kimadagem,2,Wed Jun 17 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"I do lots of research surveys and the researchers can't use the data if people do them more than once; Hit DB is helpful in tracking which requesters I've worked for and which Hit titles I've already done. I also have my own database which is even more extensive than that because I can keep notes about a hit, which helps with the requesters that insist on using generic names (""quick survey,"" for example); if Hit DB says I've worked for that requester I can check my own DB to see what exactly I did for them, what it was about, when I did it, etc. But I've been using databases for a lot of years, I like them and (usually) have no trouble setting them up, so for me it's not much extra work."

Of course, you want to try to keep them as low as possible but it's unrealistic to not expect them from time to time. Second, who was it? You may be able to get them to reverse it. Try sending them a very polite message asking what you did wrong so you don't make the mistake again, and see if they are willing to work with you. It doesn't always work but, in my opinion, it's always worth a try."

mturk,3a2u6e,cryptenigma,2,Tue Jun 16 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"There are no special quals for Burke, but you won't catch his HITs without a panda nowadays.  http://www.mturkgrind.com/threads/peter-burke-requester-thread.27828/"
mturk,3a2u6e,BloodyNobody,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:18:53 2015 UTC,its down for everyone i have turned off all scripts and still getting message
mturk,3a2u6e,Orhian,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"Haven't had a problem. maybe a ""node"" is down between mturk and part of the country?"
mturk,3a2u6e,Mark_B123,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:37:58 2015 UTC,I haven't had any problems either. I'm in California.
mturk,3a25gb,KittenVicious,10,Tue Jun 16 17:16:47 2015 UTC,I think they need to award a minimum of 1 penny in order to contact you at all unless you give them your email address directly.
mturk,3a25gb,Lurker673,8,Tue Jun 16 17:25:31 2015 UTC,Requesters can send messages to workers directly (without a bonus and without your email) but most probably don't know how.   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_NotifyWorkersOperation.html
mturk,3a25gb,electr0lyte,5,Tue Jun 16 17:38:33 2015 UTC,In order to use that operation they would have to sign up for an Amazon Web Services account and get AWS keys. Most requesters don't even do that.
mturk,3a25gb,symbiotic242,2,Tue Jun 16 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, and I think it's considerate to send a small 'consolation prize' anyway and let workers know the bonuses have been awarded, instead of leaving them to each wonder if the requester forgot about them or they just didn't earn one. :-)"
mturk,3a25gb,clickhappier,5,Tue Jun 16 18:50:36 2015 UTC,I got this too. I like how they misspelled unfortunately and then talked about my comprehension skills.
mturk,3a25gb,Suituy,5,Tue Jun 16 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"At least the bonus wasn't .02  I've gotten a few of those, and It always leaves me wondering if it is a subtle jab.  ""Thanks for your feedback on how our HITs take too long for the pay! here is a .02 bonus!"""
mturk,3a25gb,TSolo315,5,Tue Jun 16 19:25:34 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/uHZWVAb.png  i dont even remember the hit
mturk,3a25gb,MartyMcfly6,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"quit bragging about getting kick-backs, Marty"
mturk,3a25gb,Rizzpooch,2,Wed Jun 17 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"not bragging, just wanted to inform the people that the requester isn't just ripping people off by not paying bonuses"
mturk,3a25gb,MartyMcfly6,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:48:45 2015 UTC,I know; just ribbin you. Thanks for all the hard work - this last year or so of turking has gone very well since I've been getting the bulk of my work from /r/hwtf!
mturk,3a25gb,Rizzpooch,2,Wed Jun 17 03:54:16 2015 UTC,i know the feeling..i been turking for 15 months and turk master really helped out the last 2-3 months
mturk,3a25gb,MartyMcfly6,2,Wed Jun 17 04:00:58 2015 UTC,Which hit was this?
mturk,3a25gb,earnonlineaccount,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"They've had many HITs before with possible bonuses, ranging up to a couple dollars.  turkopticon : reviews about Research Methods (fka HCL Research) - https://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/reports?id=A4JVAZ8IYG82L  Edit: A reviewer has now posted that they think this is from a HIT they did a month and a half ago."

mturk,3a25gb,watermedic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:45:13 2015 UTC,I got this same message. Dont remember at all what this hit even was
mturk,3a25gb,matrixman92,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:13:13 2015 UTC,The lady and I both got the same deal.  My question is did anyone get a bonus higher than this?
mturk,3a25gb,MeltingGlacier,3,Wed Jun 17 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Good question; the $0.01-only reports keep coming in. Some ACs are overly difficult or even faulty, and if nobody or a very small percentage of people managed to pass theirs, there may be something wrong."
mturk,3a25gb,clickhappier,3,Wed Jun 17 02:00:48 2015 UTC,$1.40
mturk,3a25gb,MartyMcfly6,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"Papa Marty just served us, hard!  That's awesome, man."
mturk,3a32sw,glitteratiboss,4,Tue Jun 16 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"They emailed an apology a little while ago, issue is on their end and they will relaunch the hits in a few days."
mturk,3a32sw,smithmart,2,Wed Jun 17 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, same thing happened to me for the first time last night after a week of doing them on and off for some numbers.  I'm gonna try itsjustjibe's suggestion next time I go for 'em!"
mturk,3a32sw,MeltingGlacier,2,Wed Jun 17 01:41:33 2015 UTC,"It's very common with their batches. Something to do with their server probably. Sometimes it's not an issue, most of the time it is, however. What I do is load up a few tabs worth and you can work on one while the other is submitting."

mturk,39ykyv,Tr8cy,3,Mon Jun 15 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"So exciting! I'm so close, too. 983 with 21 pending."
mturk,39ykyv,buckette19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:33:01 2015 UTC,There was a ton of P9R I banged out to do it!!
mturk,39ykyv,mehwhateverforever,3,Tue Jun 16 00:09:53 2015 UTC,Nice! I am working on getting to 500 right now and I'm getting so close!!
mturk,39ykyv,Lolla-Lee-Lou,3,Tue Jun 16 19:08:33 2015 UTC,I'm getting close to 500 too! I was hoping today would be the day but it's been slow so far :(
mturk,39ykyv,lostoompa,2,Tue Jun 16 21:12:00 2015 UTC,Congratulations! 1k hits is a nice milestone.
mturk,39ykyv,MartyMcfly6,2,Mon Jun 15 22:19:38 2015 UTC,"Congrats, 1000 will crack the door open for you a little bit more now..i remember when i hit 5000 i felt like throwing a parade..after that it just flew by.."
mturk,39ykyv,turks24,3,Tue Jun 16 01:05:16 2015 UTC,I remember thinking it was going to take forever to hit 5000. Now 6 months later I'm about to hit 20k
mturk,39ykyv,MainTank,2,Tue Jun 16 02:55:18 2015 UTC,Congratulations!!
mturk,39ykyv,thewebsiteguy,2,Tue Jun 16 02:38:22 2015 UTC,I'm at 585 and $256.44 so far. Cant wait to hit the higher numbers.
mturk,39ykyv,Kytothelee,2,Wed Jun 17 06:38:59 2015 UTC,What hits do you all usually do? :)
mturk,39zszg,Turkit94,3,Tue Jun 16 02:56:09 2015 UTC,"Not clear what you're asking. If you mean you want to be able to spend your MTurk earnings outside of Amazon.com, then you should get a prepaid card that acts like a bank account, such as Bluebird or Green Dot."
mturk,39zszg,clickhappier,0,Tue Jun 16 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe I wasn't so clear in my previous post, I meant is there anywhere  I can do tasks elsewhere that will go into my amazon payments account other than mturk"
mturk,39zszg,clickhappier,2,Tue Jun 16 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"Ah. Nope, Amazon's MTurk is the only online work site that pays into Amazon Payments. Most other /r/SitesLikeMturk use Paypal. If you're just interested in buying stuff on Amazon with the money, you can also look at programs like Swagbucks and such that let you receive your earnings as Amazon e-gift card codes - these don't go into Amazon Payments, but they can be used towards your Amazon.com purchases simultaneously."
mturk,39zszg,Audacidy,2,Tue Jun 16 03:20:07 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks dude! just the answer I was looking for!  EDIT: I apologize for being not so clear in my original post!"
mturk,39zszg,Atroxa,2,Tue Jun 16 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"Swagbucks is really inefficient in making money if you're actively using the site though. In the time it took me to make $5 on Swagbucks, I've made $20 on Mturk."
mturk,39zszg,clickhappier,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:02:21 2015 UTC,Wait...can't you sell things and have it go into your amazon payments account? Like old books and things?
mturk,39xi6u,Turkit94,2,Mon Jun 15 16:35:29 2015 UTC,You can take the assessment and apply for the writing qual here on their website.   Here is a thread from yesterday with more information.
mturk,39vid3,sudilly,5,Mon Jun 15 03:33:50 2015 UTC,The fix is here. Worked for most people.
mturk,39vid3,NayaJY,2,Mon Jun 15 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I've been away for a few weeks and missed the ""memo'""!"
mturk,39vid3,NayaJY,2,Mon Jun 15 04:54:32 2015 UTC,No problem!
mturk,39vid3,BlondeLawyer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:11:07 2015 UTC,Ditto.  Thanks
mturk,39ut6r,cmhtoldmeto,7,Sun Jun 14 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"What does 'has NOT been granted' mean? Is the requestor looking for people WITHOUT a certain qual?   Correct. Sometimes requesters will grant a qualification after people do their HIT and set up the HIT with a qualification that says ""has NOT been granted"" so that the people who participated earlier can't repeat it again."
mturk,39ut6r,electr0lyte,3,Sun Jun 14 23:44:58 2015 UTC,or vice versa..they will grant you a qualification to allow you to take part in the next study and keep others who haven't from taking it.. they can pretty much name a qualification whatever they want..
mturk,39ut6r,MartyMcfly6,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:30:35 2015 UTC,"Yeppers.. Remember the ""gay threat"" revoked qual that threw many people for a loop?"
mturk,39ut6r,enderkg,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:52:35 2015 UTC,yeah Lee lol
mturk,39ut6r,MartyMcfly6,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:07:43 2015 UTC,"No, Lee (Calebro) doesn't bother actually setting up quals for his joke HITs, just makes up a qual name in the description.   The ""Gay Threat"" qual thing was some real researcher called Chelsea S."
mturk,39ut6r,clickhappier,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:23:38 2015 UTC,Thank you! Makes sense.
mturk,39ut6r,MrLegilimens,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Keeps our subject pools separated, makes sure our manipulations aren't being seen by the same people, provides more reliability.  and then if I ever want to pay someone $40 to be interviewed by me, well, I got a list of 1,000 people who know what I'm researching to begin with."
mturk,39ut6r,withanamelikesmucker,3,Mon Jun 15 06:22:56 2015 UTC,"and then if I ever want to pay someone $40 to be interviewed by me, well, I got a list of 1,000 people who know what I'm researching to begin with.   Maybe. Maybe not. Sometimes it's hard to remember a HIT I did five minutes ago. After a while, it all starts running together."
