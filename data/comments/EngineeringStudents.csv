Also, I love trig. Remember, it's all just a logic puzzle. I honestly sometimes do identities just because it's fun and it keeps my mind fresh.

I wouldn't say I made it to the top, but I feel you're in my position sort of, with taking trig and all.  I've never seen trig in a uni form so I'm assuming it's the Gr.12 one...?  I think you gotta keep plugging away at it.  I'm not ""naturally smart"" like so many other engineering guys, didn't join any science clubs/competitions, in fact I was an athlete, lol.  When going back to gr 11/12 the most important help was Youtube.  With YT help I went over every question in the textbook and found my weaknesses, in fact I'm going to see my tutor on Fri to work on some more.  Use YT to your advantage.  Fill up your bookmarked sites with channels discussing topics you will learn.  Don't be discouraged by your 3rd try but be warned.  You may need to change a certain habit, whatever that may be.

EngineeringStudents,3e46xa,SC275,4,Wed Jul 22 00:51:48 2015 UTC,I made poor grades all through my semester of vector calculus. My professor was a notorious hard ass with extremely difficult tests and quizzes that were far above the difficulty level of the homework. I was a terrible test and quiz taker getting low grades in the 50-60% range on most. The final was supposed to be comprehensive covering all 20 chapters. I studied my ass off on all the chapters but had an admitted shaky understanding of the last chapter. The final turned out to have 5/6 questions on the last chapter. I had a panic attack because I had no idea how to do any of it and had to take a break and collect myself in the bathroom. I quietly asked my professor when I could meet him in the summer to discuss grades and prepared for the worst. I apparently scraped by and passed the class with a C+. I maintain my professor took pity on me.
EngineeringStudents,3e46xa,Noonecanfindmenow,0,Wed Jul 22 01:52:33 2015 UTC,"Why do you want to be an engineer? Why are you failing trig?  Are you failing trig because you have too much going on in your life or are you failing because you just can't understand the concept? If it's the latter, I would highly suggest you ask yourself if being an engineer is really what you want and if it's something you would risk the significant effort, time, and money.  In my mind, trig is without a doubt one of the easieST courses, in terms of concept and application, you will take in your engineering degree.  People with far less talent have made it in much harder things, but it's not easy."

I can crush pretty much any video game you put in front of me, and I'm just good with my mind to hand coordination.....I think my struggle though is the discipline it takes to absorb a text book and regurgitate it down on to a piece of paper. It's a lot to take in, and I already have a mind full of other junk at my age. I could do something else, but in the 6 or 7 max it may take me to get this degree.

EngineeringStudents,3e2phq,MechMatt1994,5,Tue Jul 21 14:30:53 2015 UTC,Yeah the oil and gas industry is taking a hit so that's probably the biggest factor.
EngineeringStudents,3e2phq,wilson_1984,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I was applying for co-ops for the summer term earlier this year and the situation was very dire.  Basically everyone I knew who didn't go back to their last job had a lot of trouble finding a new one.  I have some really good work experience and I never got a job until a week after school was done, in May. I've been applying/getting co-op jobs for 4 years now and this is the worst year I have seen.    I think in Canada it is especially bad because so much of our economy is dependent on oil.  Obviously, the US has a lot of oil too, but they have countless other industries that are also massive and can help support the rest of the economy."
EngineeringStudents,3e2phq,nicholt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, in Newfoundland our economy is extremely dependent on oil.

At my current job I actually went through the entire hiring process with my boss and she explained every little thing to me.  She told me that there were 52 applicants from the 3 schools she sent notices to. The thing is, she sent the posting out during the last week of finals and only allowed like a day or two for people to reply. And there were still 52 applicants. She said she was amazed at how many high quality applicants were still available that late into the year.   I was literally a day away from going back to my old job washing dishes.  I have a friend with very similar education/work experience and he didn't get a job until 2 months into the summer.  It's hard out here for sure.  I'm hoping it smartens up for when I graduate.  Anecdote #2  Some oil companies cut their student budget and hired less co-op students (probably obvious, but not ever reported on).  My last work term was with Suncor, and I was not hired back for this summer.  However, I do have a friend who still works there.  She said they have 1/3 to 1/2 of the number of students they had in the fall."

EngineeringStudents,3e4eqe,Tuula15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"If you want to move around, aerospace is not the best. I am not saying it's not possible - Rolls Royce, Airbus, Snecma  are all based in Europe and have commercial arms - just that it's more difficult. Many aero jobs may involve contracting for the military, so that makes it more difficult to be a foreigner at an aerospace company.   That being said: don't let the transfer office discourage you. Aerospace is usually a capped program for many schools so they only let in a certain amount of students. However, about 10-20% will drop out in the first year and people transfer in to take those spots.  Which kind of engineering you want to do kind of depends what you want to do with your career. If you want to work on avionics or control systems, EE is a great choice. If you want to work on smart energy grids and how renewable energy sources fit in, EE can also be a good fit.  If you would rather work on the aerodynamics of the turbine blades (or aircraft wings), then aerospace is probably a better fit.  If you aren't sure what you want to work on but know you want to be more on the structural (or combustion) end of things rather than the electronics, you might want to consider mechanical engineering.  The most likely answer right now is that you aren't really sure, right? I would suggest you take a general engineering class (most schools offer a ""engineering 101"" course where you're exposed to all the different disciplines) and go talk to students in each area. See what you like to do and make your decision that way.  Don't fret about it too much either. I am an aero engineer and when I was a design engineer, I worked with every discipline. I had counterparts who were Mech Es and Civ Es. And once I went to grad school, I found lots of Chem Es and EEs and physicists and scientists and computer scientists in my department. The degree path you choose has some bearing on your future career, but it doesn't set your future in stone."

I don't think ""any field"" is quite true, but it is used in a lot. Anyone who makes something uses materials, but a lot of places just use ""common"" materials and don't really need a full-time materials engineer on staff. Another thing to consider is that, other than the companies that actually make the materials, most will not need a lot of materials engineers. So there are jobs all over the place, but they can be fairly scattered.   From my experience, most people who do a BS in MSE get their graduate degrees in MSE. But there's some overlap with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering (semiconductors), nuclear engineering, and chemical engineering (polymers)"

I don't build robots in my garage or anything like that.  I knew I could be decent at this and also make good money.  It's not very sexy, but it is the truth.  Edit: Yeah, I still want to be an engineer. I've definitely had my ups and downs though, as I'm sure most of us have had.  There's been times where I've come very close to my breaking point. But I'm still here and it has been worth it so far.   My perception about what engineering is has changed drastically over the years.  As a high school kid I knew nothing about engineering, my views on engineering basically matched up with the rest of the general public. ""I'm going to be good at math and get paid a lot"".  Of course, as is true with anything, the more you learn about something, the more you realize how little you know about that thing.

EngineeringStudents,3e2skl,nicholt,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"Basically this ^  Before having work experience (summer internships) I thought I'd find a job I would love, like a job that I enjoy more than college at least, and then throw myself into excelling at work because I loved it so much. But a job isn't the same as college, far from it.  The realization has come to me that a job is a job. If I wanted to do it in my free time, then so would others, and thus we wouldn't be paid to do this stuff. So I've lowered my expectations, become thankful that my job,(well, internship job responsibilities rather) setting up and running tests on failure of materials and writing reports, is more interesting than flipping burgers, being on excel all day, etc. And for how much they pay me, it's a bargain I guess.   There are plenty of jobs which pay more (and even more that pay far less!), but I think it's a fair tradeoff of somewhat interesting work, relatively low stress, manageable hours, and good pay when considering the actual hours worked per week.  I've reached the point where I'm okay with my job and future job prospects and would rather focus my time on life outside of work. Doing really interesting engineering stuff like designing a part and toying with it will be a hobby."

EngineeringStudents,3e2skl,Beesto5,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Haha I'm right there with you. I would love to go into aerospace. Or maybe chemical. Perhaps automotive. Maybe biological/medical engineering? Could even go into petroleum. Probably even end up as an engineering professor some day. Who knows what I'll do!  But I've known since probably the 4th grade that I belong in the engineering field.

I know I would honestly prefer waiting tables (and I was decent at it) but that lifestyle is not conducive to a family which I'd eventually like to have and makes considerably less money. So basically Im stuck with it. Could be so much worse so at least there's that. I'd probably be working in an office in just about any other degree and I'd hate medical more than anything.

EngineeringStudents,3e2skl,sxeQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"Why do you want to be an engineer?   I want to work with and improve the state of technology.  Not many people are fortunate enough to have the opportunities I've had to work with technology. I'm going to be involved in an industry where what interests me and what I'm good at and what society demands all intersect. And I'm lucky that's the case.   Do you still want to be an engineer?   I'm only gonna be a senior but after a few internships, I've seen some of the prospects I have after graduation in industry or graduate school. I'm glad I've chosen the route that I have. I look forward to the new challenges.   What has changed about engineering for you?   Long answer for this one:  I thought it was gonna be hard as all hell. It's still hard, but not in the way I imagined. But you've heard the stories. It'd be like a Hunger Games movie. It's not that bad if you stay focused and stay responsible. What is hard is keeping yourself motivated. And that's a life long endeavor. You can't just be motivated for a few days at a time. You have to develop a lifestyle. You will be working harder than most of those around you day in and day out. You have to keep a constant pace and enjoy yourself whenever you can. Because there will be things that are tedious and dry. 80% of the time, that is the case.   As far as the technical stuff (the math, the science, the technology, problem solving), I got what I expected and am loving it.  By the way, don't think you'll be living under a rock if you decide to pursue engineering. You will deal with people. Persuasion, professionalism and people skills are very important.   Do you still enjoy it?   Very much so, in a masochistic sort of way. Other than being a professional athlete, I wouldn't trade the profession for anything else."

I could be a mechanic or an assembler or a tester or a fabricator but I have the ability to design things with CAD programs. Being able to manage people helps a bit too. I've always loved science, math and understanding the world around me, I also love to fix things and to plan things. Engineering is probably the best route for me.  Other avenues that would probably work: -Project estimation - I would eventually get bored of 0 hands on work  -drafting - doing that now, boring as fuck!  -mechanic/fabricator/assembler - not enough conceptual work or design work unless I find some small shop. Also its dirty hard work every day all day. I'd rather dirty hard work ""some"" days all day."

I started off wanting to do environmental, but I switched to mechanical because I wanted something more versatile. Also, I really enjoy mechanical design, I'm just bad at it because I lack the skills to make good designs. So part of my motivation is to be better at what I love.   A perk I guess is that I would get paid lots of money to basically put to a CAD whatever I feel like."

Most research fields will have their own computational tools which bypass PDEs completely. Understanding the working underlying the computation would be great, but soon it wouldn't matter. Grad School Doesn't matter what field, take it. Especially if you know that you can get a math minor with solid scores in math.

I used that for all fall semester then one day I realized, ""What am I doing?""   I used a fraction of the pockets on the bag and it was VERY large and cumbersome. Eventually I just switched back to my old simple Jansport backpack that I had been using since fourth grade.   You don't need a very serious ""college"" backpack.

EngineeringStudents,3e1kaq,TCoop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"I got a Chrome riding bag just before my freshmen year. When I was actually riding my bike, it was great. Fit my 16"" laptop and a few books just fine. Water proofing kept everything dry, even in pouring rain. Fit well when riding and for short walks from bike rack to building.  But anything longer than a short walk it is the worst. When you're hunched over on a bike, some of the weight of the bag is just distributed over your back, and the strap isn't doing much. When you're standing up, it's all on that one shoulder strap, and it's a bitch.   8 years later, I still use it daily. It's still in one piece, no significant wear or tear. I suppose in that regard it's a really quality bag. I'll definitely need to upgrade to something more professional in the future.  TL;DR - Two straps or bust."

Typically the resume will get you an interview and your personality will get you the job.    When I interview I rarely look at GPA.  Mainly I look at projects, especially non school related projects.  I feel that is a better indicator for a good engineer than GPA.  If you have the passion to design and build something outside of your typical course load, you will probably be a good engineer."

I used to go recruiting with one senior engineer who didn't even look at the GPA. He'd look at work experience and how well the kid would handle difficult questions.  My manager would look at the school and the GPA. If it was a non-Ohio school and the GPA was below a 3.5, the kid would have to have something really stellar on the resume to get an interview.  I think it depends on who you interview with. A higher GPA usually means you get more interviews but as to the likelihood to be hired or pay, that depends on how you handle the interview."

Besides that, it comes down to a fundamental question of the purpose of education: is it about preparing students to blaze new trails, or about catching them up to what's already been accomplished by the sum of human experience to this point? The correct answer is both, they depend on one another, so even though it can sometimes feel boring or useless to learn about the science of the past, it's nonetheless an important element in understanding the world so that you can mold it, if you will."

In the meantime I filled a low level engineering role because I knew CAD.  So you could look into picking up the simple skills (most of what BS level engineers do is not college level), and going for a graduate degree to get the appropriate credential."

If you manage to pass all of the modules of the degree then you can become eligible for chartership with the Institute of Civil Engineers, just as any normal civil engineer would. It is a good programme, however, you should note that there are about 30 ish applicants per place and the degree it self is quite difficult(if you go with structural/foundation engineering modules). I am currently finishing the degree and I did the conversion route (I had a BEng in Materials Engineering) and am now a graduate member of the ICE and student member of the IStructE and have recently been offered a graduate structural engineering role.

EngineeringStudents,3dzzxe,B_Wizzle,5,Mon Jul 20 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"As a current aero student, I would recommend that you stay with EE in grad school if you do your EE for your undergrad. With an thorough EE education, you're setting yourself up with a good background to be employed by an aerospace company to do electrical work, whether it be designing the internal electronics of a satellite, or working on the avionics on a spacecraft. You don't need an aerospace degree to work in the aerospace industry.   Basically, if you're interested in EE with aerospace applications, do EE. If you end up being more interested in structures or aerodynamics, mechanical and aerospace would be the only appropriate choices. Having an aerospace grad degree after an EE undergrad seems unecessary, and robs you of the chance to specialize in EE, IMO."

EngineeringStudents,3e1jv9,cantorsparadox,6,Tue Jul 21 23:37:46 2015 UTC,"I would play it safe until you have a feel for the curriculum. The first year is a great time to get some of the electives and liberal arts stuff out of the way while only taking a few engineering/math classes. If your school is anything like mine, they will usually recommend 1-2 math classes, 1 engineering class, 1 chem/physics class, and then 1-2 electives for the first semester. Definitely veer away from maxing out your credit hours until you know what you are capable of - 16 is a fairly solid number for your first semester.  You also want to stay away from starting out with only 12-13 credit hours because if you have to drop a class, you may lose full time student status at your university (although this varies from place to place) which can have some consequences for financial aid and/or eligibility for certain programs. Additionally, you may find yourself screwing around more if you have fewer classes - remember why you are here! The only time you should ever take only 12/13 credit hours is if you are doing a job/lots of activities on the side and already know you don't have the time for more."
EngineeringStudents,3e1jv9,papperonni,2,Tue Jul 21 06:56:36 2015 UTC,It depends how many hours you want to put in. I took six courses and ended up with an 81% GPA.

I flew through high school with a 3.98 GPA without studying or reading anything. I was an active part of a half dozen extra curricular activities such as lead guitar in jazz band and lead role in the school plays, both incredibly time consuming. This simply doesnt fly in college. Especially in the engineering disciplines. My GPA tanked to a 2.5 because I tried doing what worked in high school my first year of college. Slowly you'll learn how to study, If you studied to get your 80% expect to study WAY harder and get worse results.  Just keep grinding, everyone makes it through eventually if they want it bad enough, if I could go back and do it all again I would have taken an extra year and tried to enjoy college just a little bit more.

There should be people there whose job it is to help incoming students plan their schedules and course load, and there may even be some specifically for the engineering department.  Ask if there is a degree flowchart available for the engineering program, this will usually show which classes are prerequisites for others. The one at my school was broken up into recommended semesters, and it really helped a lot with planning.  Looking into prerequisites is especially important if you are considering taking a heavier or lighter than normal course load, as certain classes may only be offered in the spring or fall, and by putting one off you could be making it harder to graduate when you want to.  TL;DR ask somebody in the engineering administration for guidance, and good luck!"

One professor I'm working with (and will hopefully join his lab in the near future) has me on a project where I have to translate and improve one of his major programs from MATLAB to Python.  Part of the reason why he's having me do this is because MATLAB is too rigid and not necessarily adaptable for the tasks this program (and most others he wants to make) needs to do. Sure, there are the additional bio modules, but Python has that as well and can actually be used in a more dynamic fashion (which is key in biology), whereas MATLAB isn't."

However, not everyone gets a C for the same reason. Is it your studying techniques, not doing homework, test preparation. If you figure you can review some material on your own and fix your techniques that caused you to get a C in Calc 1 then you don't need to retake the course.  TL;DR - Everyone has a different story."

There is a lot of overlap between mechanical and aerospace engineering, so with enough dedication you can definitely make the switch between the two. Also, a lot of graduate course professors prefer to reteach pre-req material over, rather than assume the student knows it, albeit at an accelerated pace. You should check with the professors themselves on what to expect going into a course, and what kind of material they expect you to know prior to the class."
EngineeringStudents,3dz9se,dr_everlong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"Courses will be continuations of undergrad but much more advanced and fast-paced. The difference between a grad course and a senior-level course is analogous to the difference between calc3/diffEQ and calc1 IME. You will struggle with the material either way most likely... grad-level courses require a lot of work outside of the classroom. A solid grasp of the fundamentals pertaining to the specific course is recommended but not required, if you're going to be able to handle the course itself it should not take you long to catch up on the background material.  Thesis requirements in an MSc vary wildly. Technically all you need to do is demonstrate a mastery of your specific subject and your thesis can end up being very fluffy and not contributing much. If you are a capable researcher you will ideally publish once or twice during your masters and use those articles to create a thesis. I published once in my first year and once right after defending but a few of my colleagues just wrote their thesis quickly and graduated without publishing.  Courses should be discussed with either an academic advisor or your direct research supervisor. Software will be provided by your institution. I would recommend being familiar with MATLAB or an equivalently capable language as well as being able to use LabVIEW. Those two are pretty key for performing experiments and analyzing data. My advice is to set a definite and reasonable goal right away with your supervisor for your thesis... some supervisors try to take advantage of students by bloating their projects and making them work insane hours. You may feel like a slave but you aren't actually one! Make sure to not let school dominate your life and go out once in a while!   Good luck."

Sounds familiar!    Are the courses going to be a direct continuation of what I studied in undergrad or I'm just supposed to know the fundamentals?    You should be comfortable with the fundamentals. Grad classes tend to be more derivation and working through the things you learned in undergrad more rigorously.    Am I going to struggle with the course materials since I don't have a bachelor's in ME?    There's a reason many schools have combined mechanical and aerospace departments. You'll be fine    What could you tell me about a thesis in a master's degree? any tips?    It's hard and rewarding. Get ahead and stay ahead. Start writing months earlier than you think you need to. You should be able to complete a lot of the literature survey, intro and methodology sections while you crank out results.    How many courses should I take per semester? How much time to devote to my thesis?    This will probably depend on your advisor. I never took more than three at once.  Depends on course availability and what classes you want to take or are told to take by your advisor    What are the software products I will need to use?    Depends. You should be fairly comfortable programming in at least MATLAB    Any good resources that could help me out? (courseware, books,..)

It's just a manner of utilizing the right resources to study how you personally learn best.  Maybe a one-on-one tutor is what you need for it to ""click"" faster. Or, it could be YouTube videos, or study groups, or office hours.  If you can find the method that works for you effectively, you'll likely have more free time in the end.  In the short term, maybe retake one of the math classes to solidify your fundamentals. Take a quarter or semester to really catch up, and the next classes will be so much easier.

There's freedom in pen and paper which is far simpler for engineering classes. I retype my notes when it comes time to study for tests.

AFAIK everyone who's ""taking notes"" with their laptop during lecture is really just sitting there playing games or working on an assignment for another class. Doing diagram-heavy notes with keyboard and mouse is not really practical.  If you're serious about taking notes on a computer during lecture, you need something like a Surface Pro, which has a good high resolution digitizer and can run OneNote (as opposed to something like an iPad, where the ""pens"" are not strictly accurate). The newer Surface 3 (the x86 one, not the ARM one), or any of the Surface Pros. On the cheaper side, there are a few android tablets with proper digitizers (Galaxy Notes, for example). That said, you can pick up an original Surface Pro new in the box for less than the cost of a 10"" Galaxy Note, so I'm not sure that saves any money...   How do you take notes? computer or paper?   Mostly via Surface Pro and OneNote, though sometimes still on paper. Paper only for math classes. OneNote for engineering courses--the effectively infinite drawing surface is beyond useful for doing large diagrams. You can also zoom to different levels to leave lengthy notes about what's going on at certain points. Additionally, annotating powerpoints directly (or copying images out of powerpoints into your notes) can sometimes be useful.  Of particular note is the ability to do full text searches on neatly written handwriting in OneNote."

Imo, a 20-30 year drought is highly unlikely. We'll likely be extracting oil for the next 100 years still, so petroleum engineers won't be going anywhere.  That said though, it seems like a risky major path to take.  Seems a bit wiser to just do chem engg.  But it is still good to graduate as a petro cause you will have much more knowledge of the industry than a chem engg major and therefore, you will be more desirable. (or at least that's what I tell myself...)  Edit:  Just felt like I should add a little to my post.  Usually when petroleum engineering is brought up, people are quick to say that you are pigeonholing yourself into O&G.  While it is obviously true that you specialize in that field, it does not mean you will not be able to branch out and do other things (though it might be a bit harder to get your foot in the door).

A big part of learning is struggling through new concepts independently and developing the logical pathways to the answer, which you might not get to the same extent in a study group. However, I would definitely recommend going to a good study group afterward that won't socialize half the time there, and then starting a discussion on how people approached problems and their logic behind it. Doing this gives you the best of both worlds - it gives you an independent method of learning new material which is a really important skill to have, but also allows you to discuss it with other classmates who may have different conceptions of the problem. And, if they may struggle with the material, teaching them how to solve the problem once you've figured it out yourself is a /really/ good way of reinforcing the concept in your own head.

It's quick and dirty, and gets you close, and then you finish with a finer process. For turning, depending on the process, you'll generally cut or part, you don't really ""rough"" a face to length. Cut/part a little over 70, do your turning, finish the ends. The exact process will depend on your actual part, though."

EngineeringStudents,3dxhhc,tyggerjai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:15:54 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say without knowing more details. If you can't cut or part, then allowing you to face seems odd. If you can't cut, part or face, then you get into odd semantics about when turning becomes parting. Or you turn one way and then try to chuck a cylinder sideways. It would be easier to help with more detail. But either way, if they really want you to ""turn"" rather than part, you would get close with roughing, then finer and finer until you are at spec, and at some point the turning would lop off the excess, in effect parting it.  Roughing vs finishing is partly about the tool, but significantly about turning speed and feed rate. It feels a lot like these are questions that should have been the entire point of whatever machining course this homework is for."

EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,PlantingATree,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:57 2015 UTC,How do you find that funding? Contact professors before applying to schools?
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,TCoop,3,Sun Jul 19 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely contact professors you would be interested in working with. That is important. You should want to know more about the research they are doing and if it fits your goals. Send them an email asking politely for a brief phone interview where you can ask about what they do, and see if it is a fit. Your not just applying to a school, your applying to a lab, and you need to be happy with them as much as they need to be happy with you. Don't ask ""Will you give me funding,"" that's not what that conversation is about.  The funding for your tuition will come out of the budget for the project you will be working on. So the main factors are going to be how much money they have left on that budget, how many grad students are on the project, and how badly they want you to join.  How many students are on the project is a good question to ask when you contact the professor. Good indications of how much funding a lab gets are: highly ranked university, prolific researchers in the group, economically relevant research topics, and variety and quality of available equipment. These are also things you can ask about.  These days projects are generally funded three years at a time, at least for government grants. The most favorable situation for you will be if there is still a year or two left, and the only grad student on the project is graduating. They will want to replace them to continue the research, and will have money to spend."
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,TCoop,2,Sun Jul 19 18:13:36 2015 UTC,Thank you! Amazing advice. I've been trying to find info on this stuff for a while now and haven't found anything specific like what you wrote.  Did you get a RA position this way?
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,TCoop,3,Sun Jul 19 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"My situation is a little unique and I cant really explain without significantly narrowing my identity, sorry. That said, take what I said with a grain of salt, as I didn't go through a normal process. (Mainly because i stayed at the same University as my undergrad). This is just based on what I have seen from my experience inside an academic environment."

EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,dberg,4,Sun Jul 19 19:13:33 2015 UTC,"Which schools would be the best to prepare for that career?   You should be picking programs based on something you would like to research over the next 2 or 3 years, not simply ""what is best to prepare you for industry."" Top Tier schools are great, but if you can't find any research you're interested in writing your thesis on, you're going to have a bad time. Even if you're going for a coursework MS, you will still need to complete a project which shows that you can adequately apply your skills.  You may find that a Masters of Engineering may be a better fit, since they are designed to train students specifically for industry.  Look at what sort of research faculty is working on, and try to find some solid middle ground between their interests and yours. Contact professors before you start sending out applications in order to see what sort of prospects might exist.   I've heard that you can be better off getting a M.S. in mechanical engineering rather than aerospace to get aero jobs, is that true?   The basis of this idea is that an ME undergraduate is more adaptable to the general needs of the aero industry because their education is broader compared to an AE undergrad. That being said, companies do not hire MS students to be jacks of all trades, they are expecting a master of one. You will be hired because you have shown, through your graduate degree, that you can effectively apply a specific subfield of aerospace engineering, which is most likely beyond the scope of both mechanical and aerospace undergrads.   Based on that, I do not believe you should consider this a valid rule. However, talk to your school's career center for a second opinion.   How do I get a research assistant position at whatever school I apply to? Do I contact the professor I would like to work for before applying to the school?   Most professors are open to being contacted before hand. It is certainly helps you narrow down your choices and see what options are available.   Getting the actual RA position varies from school to school. Ask potential advisors and the relevent graduate student office for more information."
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,why_earth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"Should I find a research topic before going to school/applying?

You've pushed me towards aero rather than mech for sure :) If I go for grad school that is.   Thank you very much for your help!"
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,why_earth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"Should I find a research topic before going to school/applying?    You should at least have a rough idea of what subject you would like to be studying. It can be general enough that you can get in with an advisor which is a good fit for you, and you narrow it down in based on what they need, or what you want to do in their lab. Some people have an exact thesis topic in mind, and know of exactly who they want to work with before hand, but that's probably a rare case for Master's students.   [I]n my country you need to have an M.S. to be legally allowed to call yourself an engineer.   Ah. In the US, engineer is not a protected title. There are plenty of people working tier 1 tech support who's title is ""Systems Engineer."" You still need to be a licensed professional in order to sign off on work, though."
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,tindandelion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't have an exact thesis topic in mind. Are propulsion and aerodynamics too general? Those are the two topics that I'm most interested in.  Over here it sounds like you need to be the kind of licensed professional you speak of to be able to call yourself an engineer, since those who work in engineering with a B.S. degree can do everything besides sign off on stuff."
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,tindandelion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"Are propulsion and aerodynamics too general?   Probably, but it's a great jumping off point. Try and find some faculty which are working on topics in propulsion that you're interested in. Could be improving efficiency on existing propulsion, maybe working on new technology for future propulsion methods, or stuff like that. Find something that really clicks.  Read their papers, too. It gives you a good idea of what they're working on in their lab."
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,Sirnacane,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not in aerospace so keep that in mind. Also, the school I'm most familiar with is the University of Minnesota which has a pretty good AEM program.  Going the ME route has the benefits of being more broad so it gives you more career options. Aerospace is more specialized so you'd want to be certain that it is what you want to do. You might look at the job postings for the companies you are interested in to see what they are hiring. Also, read the job descriptions and see which ones sound interesting to you.  For getting an RA position you can reach out to faculty. However, you need to have looked into what they are working on and have something specific you are contacting them about. They get A LOT of emails from perspective students. Because of this, don't be too surprised if you don't get a response or if they take a while to respond.  If you are a strong candidate, you may have the opportunity to get covered financially for a semester by the department while you find an advisor. However, these often go to PhD students first and MS students second. Side note: consider applying for the PhD program instead. PhD students have access to more university resources. If you still only want a MS it isn't hard to leave at that point. This may be unfavorable but it's just how it works. Not sure how being an international student affects this. An alternative to an RA position is to work as a TA. However, these positions often go to PhD students first as well.  For the GRE, ace the math portion. That is essentially a given. For the reading and writing portions, review what you can. Don't forget to ace the math portion."
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,Sirnacane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, it's very helpful. Especially about checking job postings.  Do engineering programs mostly look at how you did in the math portion on the GRE and disregard the others?"
EngineeringStudents,3du4cz,Sirnacane,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:37 2015 UTC,No problem.  They are basically going to expect that you get a very good score since you are an engineer. The other components are less important. You still want to prepare for them and do your best but the math will by far be the most important piece.
EngineeringStudents,3dvhrv,Fourier1,4,Sun Jul 19 21:37:09 2015 UTC,"Not sure who the hell has the luxury of taking 12 units a semester, but everyone I know had 16 semesters minimum.

EngineeringStudents,3dvhrv,Miggaletoe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your thought-out responses.   Unfortunately my school has a cap at 16 units. If i am lucky enough to find a class that is open I would have to fight with the department to allow me to go over this 16 units. If an opening becomes available I would definitely do that; and then drop the classes that I feel I won't be able to handle accordingly.  I am in the Los Angeles Area and there seem to be many companies seeking out M.E.s. I might be lucky enough to get into a paid research program, which would really weigh in against getting a job before completing my M.S. I will follow your advise, stay on my toes, and adapt to the situations accordingly. I have already started looking into possibilities for grad school, though I realize it is too early to set anything in stone."

(I actually have grant money left over for books and supplies)  -engineering is engineering, whether you take it at UC or a state U; I don't think school prestige is as important as the portfolio you build, especially for a B.S. degree.

You're basically faced with the problem of converting a point in task space (the user-input, or the point locations for the wall structures) into configuration space (i.e. the robot joint angles required to reach that point) which is a classic inverse kinematics problem. If the u-arm is open source it's likely you can just find the inverse kinematic equations for the robot online. Then all you need to do is convert the angles generated via inverse kinematics into relevant servo commands via a microprocessor and you're done. This is all assuming that you don't care what path the robot takes, only that it can reach the point indicated by the user."

EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,CBalls,25,Sun Jul 19 04:45:22 2015 UTC,"There are other engineering jobs that aren't super ""technical"" that you could look into. You could find a test engineering job and test stuff that other people did the math/design for. There's also field engineering in oil and gas and other industries. A buddy of mine that I graduated with just climbs rebar all day making sure it passes code and gets paid about the same as I do as a design engineer."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,CBalls,6,Sat Jul 18 15:57:34 2015 UTC,Test engineering roles usually involve a lot of technical knowledge don't they? At least the postings I've seen require extensive technical knowledge
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,Apfelstrudel1996,4,Sat Jul 18 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"It probably depends on what industry you're trying to get into. I work for a consumer products company and our new engineers normally start out at the test lab manipulating, dropping, and generally beating up products to see if they pass the testing standards that someone else wrote. They build a lot of test fixtures and do PLC programming on the robots to do the tests that require 50,000 cycles or whatever and then report up the results.  I know when I was looking for jobs there were also entry-level flight test engineering jobs at Lockheed Martin, if you're into aerospace."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,exposito,3,Sat Jul 18 18:02:31 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I want to do with my life!
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,EngineeringMuscle,4,Sat Jul 18 20:42:23 2015 UTC,"Depends. If you're running a test that's already set up and literally requires you to sit there and run the test stand and present the data, no it does not. If they want you to design (and present what you want to build to get approval), build, program, calibrate, run, etc. the test stand, it requires not only ME knowledge but some circuitry knowledge."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,kvnm,4,Sun Jul 19 00:19:14 2015 UTC,How do you get into the oil and gas industry if you don't go to a school in Texas?
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,EngineeringMuscle,9,Sat Jul 18 21:32:12 2015 UTC,"Right now isn't the easiest time to get into the industry, but I don't know of any O&G company that exclusively hires from Texas... I know for a fact that University of Tennessee has a good amount of exposure to the industry. You might consider trying to get to their career fairs there."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,Claythorne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:53:12 2015 UTC,I'll give it a shot. Thanks!
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,EngineeringMuscle,3,Sun Jul 19 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"Texas isnt the only place where the oil & gas positions are (granted they have a lot here). California, Oklahoma, and North Dakota all have activity but with the current market, jobs are definitely harder to come by.   But you dont have to be a Petroleum engineer or even go to school in Texas to get a job in the Oil/Gas field. I have co-workers that started as Civil engineers from Michigan and other states."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,Sybertron,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:27:58 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. I'll keep on trying then. Thanks!
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,BFoskett,11,Sun Jul 19 23:59:37 2015 UTC,"Quality engineering.  You can very easily make 50 dollars an hour, never touch anything technical, and just shuffle paper work and excel files all day long.  If you like the overall view of things, look for a CAPA (Corrective and Preventative Action) position.  It's the guy that reviews complaints and problems, and determines if a recall is necessary and what needs changed to correct issues.  You are doing quality work but have to go over every stage and step in the process for a part or product.  You really get into just about everything in a CAPA roll, while never diving to far into anything.  Usually you'll find CAPA jobs in aerospace, automotive, and medical companies but really any manufacturing site can have them."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,meeshu321,2,Sat Jul 18 19:31:08 2015 UTC,50 dollars an hour doesn't seem like entry level pay. What do you normally start out at?
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,BFoskett,14,Sat Jul 18 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"In the UK engineering graduates are one of the main sources of investment bankers, certainly meets the well paid criterion. Look for things in finance and insurance. Also patent attorney could be an option."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,meeshu321,3,Sat Jul 18 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"How do these individuals get into investment banking? By knowing people in the industry? Or they just apply and get in by marketing themselves right?  I've thought about this same thing, but I'm stuck as to how to approach it. I'm still on the fence of sticking with engineering or trying something completely new. At least I've got until the end of this year when I graduate to decide!"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,Gyang193,3,Sun Jul 19 06:23:05 2015 UTC,"Well we actually get sent information from the companies about internships and graduate schemes and finance companies here seem to seek out engineers. If you could find out more about that perhaps you could use the same information to write a convincing application to U.S companies, I think the main thing that attracts them is that we are problem solvers and highly maths literate."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,nmddl,3,Sun Jul 19 06:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard the same that finance people like engineering people because of problem solving/math skills. None have reached out to the engineering department at my school, or at least to my knowledge. I'll definitely do some digging and research to figure out what would make me an valuable asset to the company. Thanks for the response!"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,nmddl,23,Sun Jul 19 17:37:24 2015 UTC,"Retail manager maybe.  But no, there are few jobs that would get you 70k with a bachelors. Engineering is one of them. Finance is another"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,FISTFUCKMYDICKHOLE,12,Sat Jul 18 15:30:06 2015 UTC,Just chiming in; I graduated with a CE and I'm working now as a financial analyst.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,nmddl,5,Sat Jul 18 17:49:22 2015 UTC,How'd you make the switch? How do you even get into financial stuff?
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,Pellowify,16,Sat Jul 18 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I got a bit lucky. One of my best friends graduated in finance and got a job at a big biotech company while I was working on finishing up my degree. After I graduated, I couldn't find a job for a little over half a year and at that point an opening for an entry level finance position opened up. I asked him about the job and seemed like something that I could do (along with a decent pay and awesome company perks), so I gave him my resume to pass on.  The toughest part was the interviewer asking why I want this job when I had my background in engineering (I didn't want to tell her I lost interest and that I graduated with a below average gpa). I think she was more concerned that I'm using the opportunity to just have a job until I find a more preferred one in my field or to build up my resume with experience from the company and leave after a short time rather than lack of technical skills.  The job itself isn't very hard at all especially in the entry level positions (my title now is junior financial analyst); its basically glorified data entry until you move up a position or two; so anyone with a engineering background on their resume would be a viable candidate (showing a capacity to learn a tough subject)  Let me know if you have anymore questions and I'll try to answer them as best as I can.  Good luck."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,nmddl,10,Sat Jul 18 18:40:22 2015 UTC,How did you answer her question about whether or not you planned to stay with the company temporarily?
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,Pellowify,2,Sun Jul 19 02:25:44 2015 UTC,I pretty much had to convey that I actually took interest in finance and that I'm committing to the career path. She even asked me if I was willing to go back to school in the future for finance (I said yes even though I wasn't sure). I stumbled a lot; I actually thought I did a bad job during the interview. Definitely not my best performance.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,meeshu321,2,Sun Jul 19 15:32:16 2015 UTC,How would you cater your resume for a finance position with an engineering degree?  I'm kind of in the same position as op.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,nmddl,3,Sun Jul 19 06:16:08 2015 UTC,"This is tough. I worked in retail banking for 6 years while I was in school; even though it has very little to do with what a financial analyst does, it might have helped a bit. Other than that, just list any classes you might have taken pertaining to finance during college. I can't speak for other companies but we use a lot of SAP and IBM Cognos (TM1) for data-basing and business analytics; being able to list something like that would help.  Again, my resume wasn't strong and particularly geared toward finance. The entry level job just isn't that tough. If you can get through engineering, you're no dummy and they'd know it. My manager's (the interviewer) main concern was that I would leave within months if I found another job in engineering or something; I basically had to convey the message that I'm committing to the career change."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,meeshu321,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:49:41 2015 UTC,Thanks I appreciate the response.  I'll probably see if I can finish my ccna certification and see if network engineer is a possibility for me.  I'm just uninterested in mechanical engineering.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,haleandheartless,2,Sun Jul 19 20:25:11 2015 UTC,Did you do any research or teach yourself any financial background to prep for the interview job?  I've been trying to do some MOOC's in the financial field in case I decide to make the same jump as you when I graduate. Unfortunately I don't have any friends in the finance field so it'll be a bit tough. But I'm willing to go to networking events and such to broaden the scope.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,nmddl,3,Sun Jul 19 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't. The opportunity came so quickly; I wasn't really looking to it to be honest, It just fell on my lap and I hopped on it so there wasn't time to prepare. But if you are then yeah, take as many courses as you can and learn about some different finance software. My company uses SAP and IBM Cognos mainly, but there are just so many. I'm sure if you're pro active enough about networking it will work out for you.   Good luck"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,nmddl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I've heard of those in the past, but have yet to look into them. Thanks!"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,ylemp,4,Sun Jul 19 17:39:31 2015 UTC,Did you have to take extra business classes?
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,dbaker92,6,Sat Jul 18 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"I did not. I'm basically learning as I go on the job asking A TON of questions. Although it is definitely encouraged by management and I am planning to take some at my local JC.   Also just something I've observed, it seems to me in my position/company at least that your background is a HUGE determining factor on promotions. There are new graduates with 0 experience getting a full time position being trained by contractors that have been there for 2-3 years; Just one of many examples."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,jjhump311,2,Sat Jul 18 18:48:22 2015 UTC,How hard was it learning all of that on the job? Do you do any computational work? Modeling? Just curious since I've heard of some engineers doing things like math/stat models.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,iamrandomperson,2,Sat Jul 18 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"Well, for my specific tasks it is easy. Again, the entry level position is basically glorified data entry. I myself don't do any computational work but I have seen some of the things the people above me do, and they definitely do. Specifically what? I don't know unfortunately. (It definitely has some type of forecasting models)"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,Diablos_Advocate_,7,Sun Jul 19 16:04:06 2015 UTC,You can also look into patent law.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,assultrider,7,Sat Jul 18 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"I just got a job as a field engineer doing building commissioning. Very little engineering is involved, most of my day is spent walking job sites doing MEP testing and coordinating with contractors and managers to get issues solved. It's a lot better than being stuck in an office all day"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,SidusKnight,4,Sat Jul 18 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"What did you think about project management? That's what I'm doing and I barely use any engineering, but I love my job."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,bigyug13,3,Sat Jul 18 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"It wasn't bad. A lot of my co-workers did not have an engineering background and I barely used any engineering. I liked the fact that it wasn't technical for the most part. For me it was a lot of shipment schedules, making sure product was made on time, going to meetings, and working a lot with spreadsheets.  Overall I didn't think it was bad. I sorta liked it. Boss was laid back, let me have side projects for fun, and was a good experience. Unfortunately they were looking for an MBA candidate for the full time program/project management position"
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,salierniwasokay,2,Sat Jul 18 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"You should really look into systems engineering. In that role, you'll be working at a very high level instead of being down in the detail and technical work. It's more about scheduling, budget, subsystem integration, reliability analysis, trade studies, and generally just making sure a project is done well and as fast as possible. You won't need to be in management or have an for a systems engineering role, and you will do basically what you were doing at your internship except more."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,ForrestWould,2,Sun Jul 19 01:03:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe look into getting a PMP. We just got a new project manager at work. He has an engineering degree and a PMP and does zero technical work, but probably gets paid more than all of us design engineers"

EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,ForrestWould,6,Sat Jul 18 15:30:59 2015 UTC,Do you have a source on that? I'm from Ontario and all of my teachers bitched about shitty pay non-stop.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,424f42_424f42,5,Sat Jul 18 16:26:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm calling bull that a high school teacher makers ~90K.
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,FairlyOddParents,10,Sat Jul 18 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"It's actually not bull. It's misleading to imply that all of them make 90k, but many of them make that amount or close to it. Ontario is pretty generous to its teachers. Most of my teachers in high school (in Ontario) drove very nice cars and were able to afford nice vacations and whatnot.    Source: https://www.ett.ca/salary-grid-for-tdsb-elementary-teachers-2014-2015/ (Link to the pdf at the bottom of the page).   Exact pay depends on your level of education, training and years of experience. After 10 years of teaching experience, the highest salary one can get is $94k (w/ additional training and education).  The absolute lowest that one can get as an ONtario teacher after 10 years of experience is $76k.   With no experience, you can make between $45k and $55k (depending on education level)."

Firms like EY, Deloitte, KPMG and PWC are massive and although most people think they are full of accountants that's only one side of things. I joined a group that only hired engineers to do business analysis work. I then moved overseas with the same firm into a more general project management role within financial services. I no longer do anything engineering related but there are opportunities for more technical work, I'm trying to get  involved with automation engineering for example and there are plenty of tech related divisions within these firms. It's not all accounting and finance. It will also meet your pay requirement and offers great benefits and exit opportunities. But it's really tough work, high pressure, high stakes and long long days in consulting."
EngineeringStudents,3dqr9t,kvnm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:10 2015 UTC,The career services woman at my school suggested Deloitte as well. There are engineering consulting jobs available. Seems like it could be a good job for you.

I think the best bet for you at this point is to contact some of the universities you're interested in or that have the program you want, and asking them how your degree matches up with their requirements and then what gaps you would need to fill in, if any."

EngineeringStudents,3dtgek,various_failures,2,Sun Jul 19 18:00:47 2015 UTC,ME is the most versatile of engineering degrees. Take what interests you for you upper division electives. What you do at your first job won't be much like what you did in school-and it might not even be much related to what you studied. It's a great time to find out what fields you like.
EngineeringStudents,3dtgek,notavalid,2,Sun Jul 19 08:22:33 2015 UTC,"Hm.  That's good advice.  I'm worried, however, since I'm studying a non-traditional engineering discipline, I will have trouble doing what I want/explaining what my major means to people, and I figured if I could take the base ME curriculum, I could say that to them and they'd be impressed I had done that instead of confused about my major.  My major is Engineering Physics, by the way."
EngineeringStudents,3dtgek,notavalid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know Engineering Physics.  I'm Aero and specializing put me ahead of a lot people when it came to applying for jobs. There is a good chance your first job won't have much to do what you specialize with, but it'll help out.  I did sensors, telemetry, and programming. And picked a number of projects around it.  If you did RF (Radio Frequency), that's a niche that you could do better in than every except some EEs."
EngineeringStudents,3dtgek,smilingstalin,2,Sun Jul 19 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Engineering Physics is basically a combination of upper-level physics courses (E&M, Modern Physics, Quantum Mech, Quantum Info, Nanotechnology), with added Mechanical Engineering (necessarily Statics, Mech of Materials, Materials Science, Dynamics, and Thermodynamics), Electrical (Circuits, Electronics, etc.), and some programming/numerical analysis stuff as well.  Most people tend to either take a lot of mechanical classes, or electrical classes though, since there's a wide range of electives."
EngineeringStudents,3dtgek,eir411,2,Sun Jul 19 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Make sure you know how to program/code. And make sure you are good at differential equations. Other than that, it appears you have what it takes to be a MECH.   Keep in mind though, an engineering degree is not necessarily about learning the material, it's about learning how to learn technical information. Any job you take will need you to learn something new; make sure you know how."
EngineeringStudents,3dtgek,Diablos_Advocate_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"Depends on your interests. If you like robotics, take some mechatronics classes. They would synergize well with EE. For design, take some mechanical design courses that cover gears, beams and other components. CAD courses are always a plus. Personally, I'm into materials science and power generation so my favorite electives were mechanical behavior of materials, combustion systems and solar devices and renewable energy."
EngineeringStudents,3dtayr,HelloMyFriends32,2,Sun Jul 19 06:29:35 2015 UTC,"It's still worth it. What you really need to get into graduate school is get a professor who wants you as their student. It depends on exactly how low your GPA is (if it's really low, then the school might not allow it, no matter how much the prof wants you). There are many professors who are more than willing to overlook some GPA points if you're strong in other areas (as you say you are).   From the people I've talked to, one's research record is a stronger indicator of grad school success than GPA. Do you have any research experience (or an internship that was relevant to research)?"
EngineeringStudents,3dtayr,salierniwasokay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"I see.   And unfortunately no, my internship wasn't a research position. However, I was told that it is a leader in it's field and that it used/known by professors and researchers globally.. but I didn't do any sort of r&d so I suppose a research position would still look much better.  I always thought getting research positions would be pretty selective to get and require doing really well academically.. please tell me i'm wrong lol."
EngineeringStudents,3dtayr,salierniwasokay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:12:50 2015 UTC,"Well, there are ""formal"" research awards that you can win. You probably wouldn't qualify for those because of your GPA, but nothing is stopping you from just asking a prof if you could work in their lab for their summer (if you're okay with that --> it may not come with pay)."
EngineeringStudents,3dtayr,medquien,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:20:19 2015 UTC,"Well, where are you at?  A 2.9, a 2.5, and a 2.3 are very different GPA's.  Grad school apps are a lot more like a job application - they look holistically at what you've done and how well you have thought out your goals for the future.  They want to see that you know where you want to go.  Not sure why you had such a low GPA, but if you can show you were on the upward track the last couple semesters, that would definitely help.  First two years aren't looked at with as much scrutiny since people are still switching majors a bunch and figuring out what they will do with their life.  Overall the cost of applying and taking the GRE isn't that great, especially considering an engineering salary.  If I were you, I'd go for it.  If you don't try, you'll always doubt yourself and wonder ""what if?"".  Give each application 100% effort.  Start now.  You'll need at minimum 1 letter of recommendation, probably more.  Applying in the same college you're currently at may make things easier.  Those professors hopefully know you and can assist your application to get into the right pile."
EngineeringStudents,3dtayr,hairystockings,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:13:19 2015 UTC,"around a 2.5 :/   And I see, I will definitely work my ass off like none other in my last semesters.  You're completely right. I'll just go for it, thank you."
EngineeringStudents,3dtayr,scruffykid,2,Sun Jul 19 22:03:25 2015 UTC,"The trouble with low gpa and grad school is you have to apply to low ranking schools to get in. Low ranking schools are usually ranked low for a multitude of reasons, including a lack of incoming money for their research. Research that is done by grad students who are funded by that money. This means that most students are either only partially funded or receiving no funds at all from the school and paying for it to be there. These students then have to get other jobs to pay for being in grad school which is a full time job by itself.  If you apply, find out if they can actually fund you. Don't do grad school without being paid for it."
EngineeringStudents,3dtayr,riva707,2,Sun Jul 19 13:39:36 2015 UTC,Had a 2.69 from EE and got into grad school. Took a few years off but I made it in.
EngineeringStudents,3dsx5z,Rheathemyth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:05 2015 UTC,Government work. They'll let you do government work and public sector work. Also puts more people at ease if you're trying to engineer something at a refinery.   That's what I got out of my education and internship.
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,notyetanengineer,9,Sat Jul 18 19:59:32 2015 UTC,But you haven't even started EE classes yet?
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,jefffey,4,Sat Jul 18 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"I think you just described me, except I'm ME. I felt the same way you did until I took my first 'real' engineering course (structures and properties of materials). That class was very interesting and it was at that point I knew I was in the right place. The robotics club I'm in also helped me decide that mechanical was right for me, so maybe join some more clubs?  Is your problem that most engineers you encounter only seem to want to do engineering 24/7? I know plenty of engineering students who are learning a language or studying other subjects like history or playing an instrument, but I also know a lot who only do engineering things and don't show interest in anything else. Maybe you need to surround yourself with different people?  Junior year is when all of your classes will be major-specific classes, so maybe your attitude will change by then and you'll be more passionate?   TL;DR: There are a lot of factors that could be making you feel the way you do about engineering. Just continue doing what you're doing. Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,Apfelstrudel1996,3,Sat Jul 18 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"My current situation is not too dissimilar. I kind of started out in your situation, but wound up choosing to major in graphic design instead. After graduating, I found that the job market for that is complete shit, and went back to school for engineering. Now that I'm a couple years into it, I'm rediscovering a passion for art, music, cooking and photography. But I'm finding that doing it as a hobby, rather than as a profession or an academic study, is a lot more rewarding. I can pretty much just do what I want, when I want with it, not being bound by clients/professors, deadlines, or any other creative constraints.  I do know people who have gotten degrees in some of the other topics you mentioned. One English major got a job as a prison guard, another ended up in IT. History major, also ended up in IT. People with culinary degrees do tend to get jobs in restaurants, but after a few years they develop drug and alcohol problems, burn out and quit. This specific thing has happened to at least 3 people I know."
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,Solution68,3,Sat Jul 18 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"Same here. I'm a ME student in 4th year. Two years ago I got interested in bodybuilding and started thinking of quitting the career to dedicate full time to the gym. After a serious crisis and a lot of bad grades, I found the perfect way to keep my studies focused and my training time intense.  Just try to find the correct timing for your career and other interests."
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,iloor994,2,Sat Jul 18 22:01:12 2015 UTC,"The problem I have is that, the theory is awesome and very interesting in its own right, but at the end of the day, 90% of what ChemE does is produce inane commodity goods. Who cares that you're just some process engineer making an intermediate acid or solvent, or that you work at a paper mill? Oil? Sure, you get paid a lot, but at the end of the day all you're doing is making something we either toss into cars to make them go, or put into plastics that we throw away?  All of this amazing research and theory, to achieve a quite banal end?"
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,mbr123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"You don't have to always be 100% passionate about your job. As long  as you don't actively dislike what you're doing I'd say you're fine. Plenty of people go through life hating their job, while not making half an engineer's salary.  Once you finish your degree get a job and see what it's like working. If you don't like working as an engineer, chances are you can probably use your engineering degree to get to another job that you might like (with the addition of some schooling in some cases).  Just because you're working as an engineer doesn't mean you won't have time to pursue your other hobbies. Enjoy having fun with those hobbies in all of the other hours you won't be working."
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,Jorlung,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a Senior ME student and I've always enjoyed the subject. I can see myself being an engineer as a job, though I hope to go into management later down the road.  This doesn't mean I don't have other passions. I'm the president of my school's improv team and I've been doing improv for nearly 8 years. I try to spend as much time as I can doing improv.   I believe that just because you love one thing doesn't mean you can't do something else that you like as a job. It's important to be able to support yourself so that you can have the means to do what you love. If you are doing what you love as work and are barely scraping by, you might run into trouble.   If you can see yourself as an engineer, I'd say stick with it, but also make time to do those things you love.   On a side note, the really interesting engineering classes don't really start until Junior year."
EngineeringStudents,3drlyp,smilingstalin,0,Sun Jul 19 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"It's better than me since you are actually passionate about something. I'm getting in to Engineering simply for the business sense of things, so I can earn a lot of money. Sure, I have some interest, but overall, I don't know who I am or what I want to do. I don't know what makes me passionate, and other things I do (reading, watching anime, etc, etc) WON'T be professions to put food on the table.   I think you are doing it because of what you said about it ""being expected"" of you to do it. It's bad to live to expectations, but it's even worse to live with uncertainty."
EngineeringStudents,3dslga,saucysquid,4,Sun Jul 19 01:34:28 2015 UTC,"Ha ha, yes I've had experience with it. In Iowa, they (kind of) have a 3+2 program between the three state universities. You get a 3 year physics degree, then go 2 years at one of the other schools for engineering. Good luck trying to do that in 2 years. Liberal arts school said many people have done the program. Lol nope. I was going to do the program until I found out very few courses transfer, just math. They told me all the egineering tech classes (didn't know what that meant at the time) transfer to Iowa State. They don't. I heard from other students that Iowa State wasn't even aware of this 3+2 program. Now I'm just doing one year at the liberal arts school for math and gen eds, then going to ISU this fall. Now I think that a masters would be more beneficial than two bachelors.  I would only recommend a 3+2 program if you know exactly what you're getting into and you believe two bachelors would benefit you most."

EngineeringStudents,3dsvm6,theideanator,8,Sun Jul 19 03:21:55 2015 UTC,The best way to explain diffeq is you run around in circles a couple times and then a you get an answer. In reality it is a lot of deriving and integrating. Expect to do about the same as you did in calc. I didn't think it was any harder than that.   I have nothing to say on linear algebra besides that it can come in handy in some upper level classes.
EngineeringStudents,3dsvm6,_username_taken_,7,Sun Jul 19 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Diffeq to me was learn a bunch of ""tricks"" to solve problems and then be able to recognize which to apply to the problem. Pretty simple and straightforward imo.   Linear Algebra was a lot of basic arithmetic. I always had to do each problem twice just to make sure I did my addition and what not right. Half the time I had to do it 3 times to figure out which of my 2 answers was right because I did 4+3 wrong."
EngineeringStudents,3dsvm6,devilbird99,3,Sun Jul 19 04:53:04 2015 UTC,Simple math is the worst after your first 3 semesters.  Ask me to integrate as fairly complex equation? Yeah I can do that easily. Ask me to add -3+8? I got to find my calculator and do it 5 times just to make sure.

EngineeringStudents,3dsvm6,PR0ficiency,4,Sun Jul 19 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion both of these are the types of classes where the whole ""you either get it, or you don't"" kind of marking applies. For my classes both of these had a large percentage of people getting As and A+s, but also a lot of people getting Cs and Ds. I personally really enjoyed DiffEqs, and found it to be one of my favourite courses. Lin Alg was a bit more dry but I still didn't mind it. But you'll talk to other people who will say these two courses are their least favourite courses, so it's really a matter of what you enjoy.  I also took a slightly different version of DiffEqs than most engineering majors, it was with the applied mathematics majors and was a bit more theory and proof heavy. So we actually used A LOT of lin alg in our class, but I understand it's not really the same for most diffeqs classes. But regardless I'd try to take Lin Alg before DiffEqs, simply because Lin Alg is going to be all brand new stuff, and DiffEqs might have some Lin Alg in it."
EngineeringStudents,3dsvm6,Jorlung,2,Sun Jul 19 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"I tend to not like math a whole lot   Grind out your algebra skills and techniques for DE. For Linear Algebra, grind out your matrix arithmetic. It will reduce the mechanical burden that comes with math classes. That way you can sit in lecture and get an intuitive feel for the bigger picture. Students always get bogged down with the trivial algebraic details because they had bad teachers or never honed their skills. They get frustrated and dismiss the entire subject as not for them, saying things like I'm not a math person or some nonsense. It's ridiculous to me because I think anyone is capable of being at least decent at math. Most kids are just lazy and unmotivated. There's no point in dreading whether a class will be tough. The workload will come down to the professor anyway.  Check out purplemath.com for good algebra review materials."

Dif Eq. was super easy when I took it by itself; and I would definitely recommend to do math classes Bi-Weekly.  How difficult it is all depends on the professor."
EngineeringStudents,3dsvm6,Fourier1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:22:34 2015 UTC,"bi-weekly would be better imo if you don't like math a whole lot, it'll reinforce what you learn.

In my interviews I talked about my hands on project experience on the baja team and just being on the team and knowing how to work with different people really helped in answering the typical hr questions.

Look for advice on fixing up your resume, get more involved with something resume worthy, work on your interviewing skills, and ask around for any leads or contacts with companies that might interview you.

EngineeringStudents,3dptev,Vetrosian,3,Sat Jul 18 12:08:54 2015 UTC,"So true, 1st CAD class, 1st time ever using the program, tutor assumed I was one of the experienced users after catching me randomly exploring the menu and playing with viewports. As the class was overcrowded I was sent to use library computers along with two other students who had done a dedicated CAD HNC. Learned more in the library playing around with the software, watching youtube videos and getting tips from those two than most of the class learned from the tutor."
EngineeringStudents,3dptev,wvurower,8,Sat Jul 18 09:10:37 2015 UTC,"Even if it isnt specifically mentioned, chances are at some point a class will either teach you cad, or require that you know it.

When I took a class on Solidworks, it was mostly just practicing on my own--the class itself was not really that useful.  Find a textbook or online resource and work through it on your own.  Practice modeling some different shapes, and use it for a personal project that you want to 3D print or something."
EngineeringStudents,3dptev,illoominati,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe you don't have an engineering graphics class. They are usually mandatory and not an elective.   If you really don't, download solidworks or inventor student editions and go on YouTube."

On a more concerning note, I find it odd that a top 50 school doesn't have CAD software as a part of their curriculum.

Making things that only exist in your head is the place to start. Just start using it to mock up simple assemblies and then start going in depth with part features.   You can easily teach yourself enough cad to be compentent in the area. To put this in perspective,  my universities required mem cad class ends in a final project that only requires 6 model features to be included and to make an assembly of at least 3 parts. This is a joke. I, being a dumb fuck, decided to make a laser clock. I could have just modeled a pencil and got the same grade.  I really enjoy CAD, it makes ideas that much easir to put into some physical form and then forget about for a year. I think you will enjoy learning cad."

EngineeringStudents,3drit4,chocolate_malk,2,Sat Jul 18 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"When I got my research job last summer I contacted the professor directly.  I'm sure the grad students could give you the feel of the lab, but you will have to meet the professor at some point as s/he is the one leading the research.  S/he will be able to see if you will be able to help and will explain what the goals of the projects will be.  It varies by professor on how involved they are in the ACTUAL research.  Some will micromanage everything and others will give total freedom.  You should be able to pick up on that when you are interviewing with the professor.  It helps if you have taken a class somewhat related to the projects being done.  It will help after you graduate job hunting-wise if you have done research on topics you would like to possibly work on for your career.   I don't think you need to have research work for when you go to graduate school.  Some programs have the option of doing a non-thesis where you just take classes to get your degree.  Even if you do select a thesis you will work on projects given to you by your advising professor.  So its more important to pick a graduate school who's professors are doing research on the topics of interest to you.  Personally I would say just try all of them.  You will never know what you will end up liking."
EngineeringStudents,3drit4,ddpatel2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"What did you include in the initial email? Was it just stating who you were, expressing your interest in their research, and asking what opportunities were available?"

EngineeringStudents,3drit4,Fourier1,0,Sun Jul 19 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"Like Fourier1 said include who you are, your major, any classes taken that directly relate to the research done, what you hope/plan to get out of working for him/her, and a resume.  I think you can make your email the cover letter minus the intro heading information if you word it correctly but if the job posting is asking for one then definitely type one up.  I personally think asking what opportunities are available fails to show interest in the job.  It would better to do some initial background research (Wikipedia) and be able to connect it to what the professor is saying during the interview.  Gives a much better impression especially if there are other students applying.   I'm sure s/he would like some letters of recommendation from professors in the same department as well as seeing your transcripts.  If you have bad grades (below 3.0) still apply.  I'm by no means a excellent or even a good student, but showed that I can handle multiple tasks at once, am a hard worker, and that I'm just bad at exams.  When I was actually doing research I was able to apply the knowledge that I knew and was able to pick up information I didn't know."

If it's not there, recruiters/hiring groups think you're hiding it because it's too low for consideration and will toss your resume to start.   Since all your actual work experience is focusing on the IT field, this may have a minor hit. While this can be good for problem solving, it most likely isn't necessarily the experience they are looking for in a CivE position that's ready to rock on day 1.

EngineeringStudents,3dnkbc,424f42_424f42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:03 2015 UTC,"In my opinion you do have some extra space that can be condensed, which makes it possible to minimize the number of lines for each bullet point. One or two line bullet points are easier to read for a recruiter.   Here's one template that I use that cleanly handles more text. The page dividers can also help delineate different sections without sacrificing much space (unlike larger fonts for headers). It also shows how you can have a readable setup without using a lot of indents like you've used.  Always, always, have consistent margins. It looks like you were trying to fit some stuff on the bottom so there's greater space on top. Once again if you want more room, its okay to go to a 11 or even 10 pt font. I usually have the same amount of space on all sides. It is nice to use the same margins in your cover letter (but that's a matter of preference).  Also, be consistent with where you choose start text each line. Your leadership and accomplishment lines should start with the bullets of your other experience (in contrast to be in line with the name of the orgs where you've worked).  You can make your Education section a bit more official by adding some additional info and formatting. Here's an example of one.  Best of luck!"

EngineeringStudents,3dnkbc,savi93,6,Fri Jul 17 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"Your resume is fairly strong. If I were to critique your resume, I would say you are too wordy in describing your projects and experiences. Try to cut down the bullet points to the most important and impressive portions of the project. Employers will ask you for more detail in the interview, and that is the appropriate time to expand on your role. Your resume's content is strong but there is a lot going on and it feels cramped. I would attempt to pare down as much as you can without losing specificity. Recruiters and potential employers want to glance at your resume and get an idea of your skills / experience to see if you are worth interviewing.  In my experience, online applications are of limited use. Networking and career fairs are extremely important. Use any and every resource your school has available to meet recruiters and companies. Online applications become much more effective once you have an HR person who has a good in person impression of you."

I graduated with tons of job experience, was active in many clubs/sports teams, and had research experience but no internships. I looked for months and couldn't find anything. Here's my advice:  Go to job fairs. Meet people, get emails, tell them what you are interested in. I got so many people's emails and hints about when to apply (when positions would be opening). I think it helps when people can see you in person.  Take internships. Most internships are paid, and can lead into a full time job or at least give you more experience and connections for your next job.  Contact everyone you know asking for a job. Seriously. I got my first job by reaching out to my college coach.  Good luck!"

It's the starting point for their evaluation, if it's too low for them, then you never had a chance anyways. At least you have a chance to explain the low G.P.A if they decide to interview you."

Recruiters glace through hundreds of resumes and usually only the top half so use that space to showcase your best attributes. Also if they don't see those keyword skills right away they move on to the next.  I would suggest swapping education with skills and leadership so that education is last.

When they do it this way, whatever they teach in the Electrical tends to be more on the industrial side, and whatever they teach in the Electronics tends to be more on the microelectronics side (my dad was going for an Electronics Engineering degree a long, long time ago).  I just thought I'd give him insight into what each one likely is.  Edit: Moved around my sentences to make what I said clearer. Had a long day."

EngineeringStudents,3dqb4e,xavier_505,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:36 2015 UTC,"Electrical Engineering is a very broad field and covers many applications. Just take a look at the IEEE Journal titles.  Also, are you sure the degree is actually a Bachelor of Science in ""Electronics Engineering?"" At my school, EE only had one degree, BS in Electrical Engineering, but a student could specialize in ""Computer Engineering (CpE)."" The two tracks, EE and EE w/CpE, were pretty much the same except the Computer Engineers had to take additional digital logic courses, certain CS courses, and certain senior electives. The two tracks were very similar and I can't comment on job prospects for CpE since all my CpE friends went to graduate school (there were only 5). Personally, I think that EE gives you more options and later you can always specialize in a certain field if you find something specific that really interests you.  EDIT: If ""Electronics Engineering"" is actually ""Electronics Engineering Technology (EET)"" then go EE if you want to learn more about the fundamentals and less about the specific implementations. The abstract of this paper explains the difference for electromagnetics (emag) and the prerequisites for Purdue's EET Equivalent and EE Equivalent emag corroberate the paper's statements. IMO, go EE if the above is the case. EE will give you more options since you will know more and be able to solve more complex and diverse problems. EE will obviously be harder though."

There is also a cap on the eraser so there is the potential that you could lose the cap.

EngineeringStudents,3dogy0,seaslugs,3,Fri Jul 17 23:09:50 2015 UTC,Ask about a research assistant-ship. Not sure how your school does it but a research assistant-ship (RA) usually comes with a stipend and/or tuition waiver. Or a half RA if possible. At my school only PhD students can get a full RA and the half is possible for master's and occasional undergrad.
EngineeringStudents,3dogy0,i_is_engineer,3,Sat Jul 18 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"It is more typical to be paid only during the summer or when you're not taking classes, for a number of reasons. You just have to have that conversation with your professor, as funding comes from a number of places. Doesn't hurt to ask, you won't find out otherwise really.   I've been paid for undergrad research: During semesters I sometimes found pay for research funding from other sources (not my professor), otherwise I took thesis/research credits. During summers and semesters without classes I always got an NSF REU stipend, from one source or another. Never got paid hourly, always weekly or monthly with self-set hours."

To begin with, she might want to narrow down her interests a bit more. Graduate school is about specialization, and from my understanding thermal sciences is a different field than aerospace engineering.  Secondly, this search process is greatly changed on whether you're aiming for a Master's program or a PhD program. If you're not sure, you really need to find a more helpful professor to have this conversation with (it's strange that this is a problem). You can always do a masters and continue on to a PhD in any case, but in most cases she'll be paying for the masters. PhDs in STEM are always funded, and if they're not something's off.   Thirdly, graduate school is about applying to specific departments, not the overall school or university. Unless you're just going for a non-thesis masters, the way to go about a search is to find departments with lab groups that interest you. Make sure each school has a minimum of 2-3 lab groups you'd enjoy being with...most lab groups have a website.  if you want to know more about thermal sciences, I did some research in that field so I know a bit more. also, /r/academia  and /r/GradSchool and /r/AskAcademia"

Find one that only says you can get in-state tuition after one year of residence(make sure it doesn't say anything about ""moving to that state just to go to college"").  Move to said state, go to the community college for and listen very carefully(or you could end up like me and take 350 credit hours by the time graduation rolls around) Take Calc 1&2&3, Physics 1&2, Chem 1&2. Do not take any other classes, get that done in a year and a half RAISE THAT GPA, and join a club. Get accepted to the university, get instate tuition, take all necessary BS classes such as history and the what-not in the summer in your first two years at the university. Since you'll want an internship in the summer later.    This will maximize your foundation with math, raise your GPA, save you a ton of money and go to a school you actually want rather than settling.   Also added note: The reason you should take the BS classes in the summer is because once you are accepted into the universities program, they aren't allowed to change what does and doesnt count as those BS classes.

Once I had everything that I could take completed, I then went back to talk to the department. They let me in, since I had taken everything in the minor sequence (lower dev) already, and ""proved"" myself.

Or barring that, he could get involved in clubs that will get him contacts.  I'm a big proponent of getting experience through actual work, but jobs are a dime a dozen.  A semester abroad is a once in a lifetime chance."
EngineeringStudents,3dnxit,Szos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:54:39 2015 UTC,"Priorities, man. Sure I would love to just travel the world and neglect my priorities, too bad it ain't that easy. Just as you put it, this is what you'll be doing for the rest of your life. Because of this, you would want to have a job that you like, and having experience will help you have a choice in where you work. Also, I think taking time to travel can be done in a much better manner. When you do get a job, negotiate a delayed start date. Now, you would be able to actually travel, and not confined to one spot, studying. Oh and best part, you know you have a job when you get back.   If he is studying abroad, he will have responsibilities and commitments, he's not there to vacation, he's there to study. Why should he go to some other country for 3 months, only to be able to explore a few days of the week? Why not go on an actually vacation and explore everyday?  Financially, he is losing a summers worth of wages and paying the outrageous cost of studying abroad. Why should he do that, when he can pocket some cash over the summer, only use half that and be able to travel like a king? With the peace of mind that he has a job lined up when he gets back.   I recall seeing a thread here about someone who studied abroad and when he came back, had absolutely 0 success trying to get a job"
EngineeringStudents,3dnxit,bigdaddydirty77,2,Sat Jul 18 12:03:58 2015 UTC,"Anyone that has actually spent more than a couple of days abroad (particularly Europe) would know that the experience is worth just about any amount of lost wages.  And life experience is typically far more important than anything else.    And let's not get crazy about a delayed start.  Just about no company is going to let you start 4 or 6 months after your hire date.  They hired you for a reason - they have work that needs to get done.  They aren't going to push that back by 1/2 year.  And stating that you can't explore or travel during the semester is total nonsense.  Just living day-to-day life in a foreign country, interacting with folks quite different to yourself, and having most nights and weekends free is a huge deal.  In fact that day-to-day experience in a foreign country that you'd get as a student is far more authentic in seeing how others live than a 2 week vacation you might take later in life.  And I don't know where you are getting this notion that its ""outrageous costs"".  The program typically costs the same as a semester at the home school, or even less if they are covered by grants.  It seems to me that the people that say the OP should go with an internship are probably the ones that need a semester abroad more than anyone else.  Its an eye-opening and potentially life changing experience that few get to do, so if its even an option, they should jump at it."
EngineeringStudents,3dnxit,Wolfzdude,3,Sat Jul 18 12:35:49 2015 UTC,Study abroad. If you are a good student then the jobs will hopefully come. I studied abroad and it was an awesome experience and something I will always cherish. Brussels kinda stinks though(assuming you're staying there). Good for a weekend trip and drinking beer but travel a lot if you go over there.
EngineeringStudents,3dnxit,Jung1e,2,Fri Jul 17 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"If your GPA is good and you are willing to work a bit harder in finding a job after graduation I would say study abroad. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Alternatively though, if you do choose to do an internship you could save your earnings and go on a trip after graduation."
EngineeringStudents,3dnxit,MyWifesABobcat,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:46 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way. If you don't do an internship, you might have a harder time finding a job. Maybe spend a few months jobless post-grad, but as long as you're a good student, a hard worker, and have decent people skills, you'll probably land a job.  However, if you don't study abroad, you will never ever study abroad. I think that studying abroad is an invaluable experience (albeit expensive), one that I regret not taking, because all my friends said they had the best times of their lives studying abroad.   I say, as long as you don't need the money from the internship, abroad is the way to go.   But if you could do both that would probably be ideal. Don't let me undermine the value of an internship. Try to study abroad during the school year."
EngineeringStudents,3dnxit,ryanae,2,Sat Jul 18 02:12:29 2015 UTC,"I did study abroad.  Loved the experience but i would never recommend it over an internship if you dont already have one.

EngineeringStudents,3dnxit,uniferret,4,Sat Jul 18 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"Work experience is everything so I would go for the internship.

You can always travel the summer after you graduate, backpacking with friends through Europe can be just as rewarding if not a little more life expanding.

I called MoM Statics  II, because it's basically the extension of statics into material properties.  I agree your Statics description sounds like a structural analysis class, which comes after mechanics of materials in Civil."
EngineeringStudents,3dm07j,mixedliquor,2,Fri Jul 17 11:29:12 2015 UTC,So am I screwed for statics/structural analysis? I feel like I didn't get much out of MoM even though there was a lot to learn
EngineeringStudents,3dm07j,mixedliquor,7,Fri Jul 17 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say to ask your advisor. Did you take the classes in they recommended order? Statics isn't difficult to learn,its like an extension of Physics 1. You may need to do some self-learning to catch up though."
EngineeringStudents,3dm07j,unklrukkus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:04:19 2015 UTC,I don't think your screwed you only really use the basics of MoMs in FEA type classes because FEA is using the simplest cases to estimate complex cases by dividing the body into manageable elements.   The bigger thing in FEA is having your Linear Algebra game on point. Eigenvalues and such are used to find natural frequency.
EngineeringStudents,3dm07j,unklrukkus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:33:54 2015 UTC,I'll try to brush up on that stuff then. Thanks for the help!
EngineeringStudents,3dm07j,TheSandyRavage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:44:54 2015 UTC,Yeah the MoMs stuff is just to understand why the stiffness coefficients in front of your matrix look the way they do.  Mechanical Engineering: All the world is a spring and we are but dampers in a system.

EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,Rilandi,10,Fri Jul 17 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"Chemical, Electrical, and Mechanical are the most flexible imo.

The difficulty level is subjective as well."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,callmeslade,6,Fri Jul 17 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"I just finished up my freshman year of EE and saw many people change around disciplines. It caN be difficult depending.on where you are going to school for that fact that you may have to start taking discipline specific classes your first semester.   First off do you have any hobbies? Are you more of a physical person or thought oriented thinker. There's so many different characteristics that only you know about your self that you would be able to match up with a given discipline.  Honestly I think your best bet would be to go on the internet and look up jobs your self. Classes can be difficult but (from what I've been told and have researched ) 90% of what you'll end up doing will be ""on the job"", relative to what you learned in school."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,MrYellowDuckMan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:46:57 2015 UTC,I do have hobbies and I would say that I'm a more thought orientated definitely compared to physical. Software is starting to look interesting but that's not at the university I'm going to. Also chemical and electrical are equally interesting. I wont do mehanical or civil I think.
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,MrYellowDuckMan,5,Fri Jul 17 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"If you are thought oriented I'd go after Electrical, Industrial or chemical. Industrial (from what I've been told) are ""glorified business majors"", electrical is very interesting in that you end up doing programming, Circuits (both electronic and working physically on a bread board) as well as many other things. Again I highly suggest looking at what job prospects are and see what they do specifically, to see if anything peaks your interest!"
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,infindei,2,Fri Jul 17 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"electrical gets pretty abstract so thought oriented is good for that. I chose this one, let me know if you want to know more about it. There are a ton of sub-disciplines that fall under EE. computer engineering is like the strange middle child between electrical and computer science. Electrical makes the devices (phones, computers, electronics), computer engineering gets those devices to work on the low level (infrastructure pretty much), and computer science puts cute gizmos by making fancy apps and AI. The applied mathematicians are off in some strange corner getting supercomputers to work. mechanical & civil are pretty physically based, unless you specialize deeply in either of these. 'nuff said chemical is all about large chemical processes (food, laundry detergent, oil, biofuels, list goes on forever) and the practical application. There is a lot of thought here too but its a bit more physical compared to electrical."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,infindei,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:11:13 2015 UTC,It's down to electrical and chemical now. I think I'd like that electrical is abstract and allows a lot of room for creativity outside of learning the material. I would like to find out what you can do with electrical if that's possible for you (and also chemical).
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,infindei,2,Sat Jul 18 11:22:26 2015 UTC,"CHEMICAL ENGINEERING  I'll start here, as a close friend of mine just graduated with this. What I say is more of a vague overview as we understand it as engineering seniors/recently graduated.  As a chemical engineer you can get into Process Engineering, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Modeling, or Research. Process Engineering involves overseeing a chemical plant (where anything that's massed produced comes from, including beer, hummus, oil, laundry detergent, and post-it notes), and basically being in charge of overseeing workers, upgrading the system, and fixing any breakdowns that occur. Biotechnology, think pharmaceuticals and cancer. Nanotechnology is a large interdisciplinary field focused on tiny things, and as a chemical engineer in it you may be involved in making new technologies or scaling them up (one example is trying to get fuel or solar cells made on the large scale). Modeling involves simulating these very large processes, essentially coding. Research is again making new technologies or finding ways to scale them up.   Said friend jumped fields and is now working on genomes and cancer as a data scientist, coding all day fresh out of undergrad. You gain a ton of transferable skills, no matter what type of engineering you choose  ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING  The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers have this list of societies, which well captures many of the sub-disciplines of EE (link)   I like to think of the different fields/jobs you can get into in electrical engineering to be organized on a size scale. On the very large end you have power engineers and signal systems, who create much of the large scale infrastructure we find essential in our society (power grids, cell phones, radio, cable, etc.). Going towards the smaller end, you run into the electrical engineers who choose the parts and design the circuitry for many electronics (calculators, phones, sensors, anything that runs on electricity really). Getting even smaller you have people who get all the micro/nano electronic systems built and working, such as processors and graphics cards (pretty much all of Intel does this). At the smallest end you have people improving the semiconductor materials and devices themselves, back in the interdisciplinary field of Nanotechnology. I'm focused at this smallest end really, it's my favorite.  Again you gain a ton of skills, many of us EEs go into a hacking sort of hobby of making electronics do fun things. Most of it is silly stuff like making a work tie glow with LEDs in different patterns as you talk, but some people make useful things and gain prizes from competitions. Plus you learn how to fix most of your electronics, it's pretty useful.   Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,sundering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"The chemical engineering major at my university is joint with process engineering actually I didn't mention that. As of now I think both majors look interesting and seeing as I like math/physics/Chemistry I would hopefully enjoy both. Although, chemical engineering at this university is recognised as being a very good major. I assume electrical is too but the chemical engineering guys advertise that. On the downside for chemical, I couldn't see myself at the moment anyway being interested in overlooking a processing plant unless it was part of a startup! My general idea is pick one of these 2 majors, work in an engineering related field for x years and gain experience while working with driven/motivated people . Then (hopefully) do a startup and go from there. Are either of the two distinctly better than the other? I realise I could do business instead but I'd much prefer engineering and it's more suited to me definitely."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,Apfelstrudel1996,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say either is distinctly better than the other at all, hell I almost switched to Chemical halfway through but I. Both fields would have gotten me where I wanted to be, and both can let you follow through with your plan. Electrical might be better for start ups, but chemical has plenty of start-up opportunities as well. At this point I would suggest choosing between the two based on what tasks you might like more: working with large processes (fluids and thermodynamics) or working with circuits and electronics (electricity and magnetism).  edit: our chemical engineering department at our school also makes a show of bragging about being the ""hardest"" or ""best"" department, but most people I find think it's pretty equal to electrical in difficulty and quality. We make fun of the civil engineers together (we're terrible)."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,thegiraph,3,Sun Jul 19 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"Well actually Civil Engineering is very broad and can potentially land you in any of the following fields:   Coastal Engineering,  Construction Engineering,  Structural Engineering,  Geotechnical Engineering,  Environmental Engineering,  Materials Engineering,  Earthquake Engineering,  Water resources Engineering,  Energy resources Engineering,  Surveying,  Offshore Engineering,  Transportation Engineering,  Forensic Engineering,  Municipal (City) Engineering,  Project Management,   And then there are even specialities within these.   So realistically I wouldn't rule it out unless none of those appeal to you.   One can not give any justifiable answer as for which degree is more difficult because that is subjective. What you find hard, I can in turn find extremely easy and vice versa. Good luck, I can assure you that which ever engineering discipline you choose to go with, you will find it quite challenging. College is quite a large jump up from high school."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,mbr123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"Software engineering, like other computer-related disciplines, will probably experience the most growth.   Software, mechanical, and electrical will probably have more start-ups, though civil may have some contracting-involved start-ups.   I've heard electrical is the most difficult in terms of the math and physics involved, but each degree is difficult in their own way.  Some opportunities/industries involved with each discipline: Mechanical: aerospace/aeronautic, defense, automotive, manufacturing, HVAC, plumbing, R&D, weapons, medical and many more. This is the most diverse degree. Electrical: power, utilities, solar and alternative energy sources, computers, electronics, robotics, semi-conductors and more.  Chemical: petroleum, manufacturing, oil and gas, nuclear, forensics, food, medicine, wastewater treatment, and I'm sure there are others. Civil: construction, structural, soil,  hydraulics, traffic, architecture, and I'm sure there are more. Software: security, IT, medical, IS, robotics, and I'm sure there are others.   Civil is probably the least flexible of these options.  TL;DR there are a lot of things you can do with each degree."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,mbr123,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:04 2015 UTC,Electrical and Software definitely look the most interesting now. I liked physics math and chemistry in high school but the prospects of chemical engineering don't seem to look very interesting at the moment anyway.
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,infindei,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a chemical engineering major and and to me a lot of the job prospects aren't that interesting which is why I picked up a minor in aerospace(I love rockets). I like what a lot of other majors do, but I also like chemistry and many of them take zero chemistry classes.   if all else fails just pick one major and take extra classes in subjects that you like. if you switch before junior year you shouldn't be far behind at all."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,infindei,2,Fri Jul 17 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"ChemE is a very interesting major I feel, but the interesting material in school does not translate to interesting or worthwhile jobs.  For the most part, unless you decide to go on to grad school, with ChemE you are limited to basically those jobs that he listed above. The unfortunate part about all of those is that they all tend to be in undesirable parts of the country (hope you love Houston) and, although some of them pay quite well, many more don't pay especially well compared to anything in EE or ME. Anything else would require a Master's or Ph.D, but the compensation certainly rises once you get into the more niche fields such as bio/pharma or materials.  If you have to do engineering, do Electrical or Mechanical - every field has uses for those disciplines while Chemical is far more limited in what you're capable of doing.  Software is also great and certainly at the moment very bright for jobs, but many places do not put software under their engineering school, so you'd probably be looking for Computer Science (Software Engineering is only just now being discussed as a real engineering field with ABET accredited programs). A caveat to software, however: since it is so ridiculously easy to get the tools you need to develop and write code, you will be expected to do a lot of coding on your free time, and you may not be able to keep up with people who have been coding for fun for years before college. Those people are far more likely to get the good positions you hear about, so if coding does not come natural to you right now, you may face an uphill battle."

Join organizations related to chemical, mechanical, civil engineering (American society of x engineers for example), at those types of organizations you can talk to other students, alumni, and profs to figure out what each major does and narrow it down from there.   Don't sweat over it too much if you're a freshman. Typically, all engineering programs have similar first years (for example, all engineers at my school take chemistry 1-2, calculus 1-2, two HUMs, CAD, mechanics, programming, engineering design, and some other shit I can't think of right now). Basically-  it didn't matter what engineer you were during your freshman year, you could switch around easier. It's more difficult yo switch when your program gets more advanced and specialized (junior /senior)"
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,infindei,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"I would check out Materials Science and Engineering if your school offers it.  Mainly focuses on how the processing effects the properties and structure of the material.  Depending on your program you can focus on ceramics, polymers, metals, or composites.   You can work in the mining industry, raw processing, sales, castings industry, auto industry, marine industry, healthcare (bio-materials), water treatment, electronics, etc...Basically anything cutting edge since many of our limiting factors in design are the cost of processing and the materials that we have available to develop the performance needed at a profitable cost."
EngineeringStudents,3dmujo,infindei,0,Sun Jul 19 06:56:05 2015 UTC,I'd start by narrowing it down and getting id of the ones you don't want to do. It makes it a bit less daunting.

EngineeringStudents,3dluwr,petro_bruh,9,Fri Jul 17 09:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's the classic scarcity/""STEM shortage"" problem that companies always talk about yet I have never really observed personally.  I know plenty of people who would love to go into O&G (many for the money, some for the travel opportunities, etc.), but yet I don't see ExxonMobil, BP, Schlumberger, Halliburton, etc. just giving away internships and full-time offers willy-nilly to any average engineering student. At least at my school, ExxonMobil is among the hardest companies (which actively recruit at the career fair) to land a job/internship at, precisely because everybody knows they pay so well.  When companies cite STEM shortage/scarcity I take it with a grain of salt these days. Saying there's a shortage puts pressure on the government to 1) grant more H1-B visas to let foreigners compete for the same job and 2) spend money to coerce more youth to go into the field of engineering. I would say that at least the latter has a beneficial effect on our economy overall (more engineers/engineering students = generally more educated populace) but either way both end up increasing the supply of new engineers to the workplace which keeps salaries low (engineer salaries have not even been close to keeping up with inflation or GDP over the past 60-70 years, IIRC back in the 1920s-1930s engineers were paid more than Doctors, but the AMA heavily restricts med school admissions which keeps the supply low and the compensation high)."
EngineeringStudents,3dluwr,EngineerEddy,3,Fri Jul 17 13:10:14 2015 UTC,I'd like to add that Petroleum engineers are not the only ones trying to get O&G jobs.  Most chemical students I know expect to work in O&G as well and most of the time we both will be applying for the same jobs.  That just means it is even harder to get a job than these charts and graphs imply.  Edit:  supply and demand chart is kind of flawed.  I assume they are just looking at graduates from schools based in those regions.  I would say at least 50% of my class is from the Middle East/Africa and a lot of them plan to return to their home regions to work.
EngineeringStudents,3dluwr,nicholt,3,Fri Jul 17 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"My two cents to anyone who wants to work in oil&gas:   You will get paid a lot more if you work in undesirable areas. This may work for you, it may not. It may be a great way to jump start your career and your earnings potential, even if you only stick it out in the rough spots for a relatively short amount of time. But beware having a lot of money and nothing to do: you will be tempted to spend it all, if you're lucky on fast cars, if you're unlucky then liquor, and if you're really unlucky then both at the same time. If you're living out in North Dakota where the only form of entertainment is getting drunk and driving fast, and sometimes in that order, beware. Oil is a boom and bust cycle. As an engineer, you won't be protected from it. SAVE. Save money like a motherfucker. You might be earning $150k one year and be looking for work the next, and $150k the year after that. You absolutely need to be able to ride out your low points. In this industry, I would want to keep a year's worth of expenses in a savings account, cash; yes, it's not earning you money just sitting there, but you will probably need to draw on it eventually. The less you spend on stupid shit, by the way (see point 1), the less you need to have sitting in cash. Oh, and try to save more beyond that, because oil is a very 'political' industry with a lot of bullshit that might come your way, and saving money is buying freedom from other people forcing you into making unpalatable decisions. Absolutely far too many oil workers spend every dime they earn - and you'll meet them; they'll have the newest pickup truck, two bikes, and trade them in every few years; when things bust they go bankrupt with nothing to show for years of fat living."
EngineeringStudents,3dluwr,gimpwiz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:08 2015 UTC,"I am no investment guru but I am sure there is a better way to store your savings while you do have a job than as cash. There are liquid investment vehicles out there. E.g. in Canada, if you put securities in your TFSA then get laid off, when you draw from it you will have no income to report and it will barely be taxed, if at all.  Again, I don't really know what I am talking about"
EngineeringStudents,3dluwr,CisPrivileged,2,Fri Jul 17 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Well, yes there are, but they're usually not worth the bother, if you need cash that is immediately accessible.  I mean, I keep almost zero in cash for precisely this reason; I stick everything into vanguard index funds. However, I do that knowing that if things go shitty, I will be selling at a low point; what I am banking on is that if I ever need money, it won't be coupled with an economic downturn. If I were in oil, I would assume that any loss of job would come with an economic downturn.  Generally, for short-term savings, cash or cash equivalents are preferred. An emergency fund is sort of a cash equivalent.  You could do better by buying something like a bond fund, especially something very stable like a US treasury bond fund, which is unlikely to go down much when you need to draw on it, but for most people the effort of correctly figuring out what the right kind of emergency savings investment is is too much, and they're better served just keeping a decent chunk of change in cash."
EngineeringStudents,3dluwr,gimpwiz,6,Fri Jul 17 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"It's a boom/bust industry. Aside from the scarcity excuses, there will always be times when things are lean and you straight up don't need as many people. This, combined with the common sense of entitlement, is bad news for average-to-below average students.   I'd also throw in the fact that I've hardly seen anyone last more than a year in the industry if they got in it only for the money. If you don't thrive under pressure then you need to stop obsessing over that max salary and look for jobs elsewhere."
EngineeringStudents,3dluwr,partyhazardanalysis,0,Fri Jul 17 14:56:11 2015 UTC,"As a chem eng student from rural oilfield Alberta, with a passion (as in not having it as a career option would render my degree empty to me) to work in oil and gas, this is one of many things that scares the hell out of me. I'm in SPE, network all over my area and add random EITs on LinkedIn to learn about getting in, but my gpa (2.5 after first year) is really screwing me over for any internships, along with this price drop. I would like to work in Middle East later in my career, but they want expatriates to have that impossible ""5-10 yrs exp in oilfield,"" so I need to get my P.Eng. in Alberta.  Biggest goal atm is getting field internships. I WANT to go into roles like operator, field work, labour, etc. to start off, that way I'll know things from the ground up, unlike the straight-engineering engineers who can only use a wrench once they calculate the torque to feel good about themselves. I'm already getting more industrial exposure from my water treatment job, but things still look bleak. For even a slim hope at my oil career, I have to go from bottom 20% in my class to top 10 in second year, i.e. somehow land that deal-sealing 4.0, since my relevant experience and passion won't even be read without my 2.5 sending my resume to the trash bin LOL.

What I am considering doing now is selling my laptop and buying either a surface or a chrome book.   Day-to-day stuff you don't need anything powerful. Just word processing and internet. Make sure it can run some basic programs obviously, but the most demanding program I've used in EE so far is MPLAB X and maybe matlab or mathematica.   If you don't want to do this I would recommend getting any windows laptop with an i7 and maybe another monitor/keyboard/mouse when you are working on stuff at your place after class.

Some programming in both engineering and CompSci courses, some of which I had to use bootcamp for because OSX wasn't supported.   I'm not saying you should get a Mac for engineering, just that if you have a Mac, there's no reason you can't make it work for engineering (but don't get the new one that just has one port)."
EngineeringStudents,3dnttv,Brianfellowes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"Here's my thoughts from the last time this question was asked.    Basically, I have never run any kind of engineering software on my computer (laptop or desktop). EDAs are typically very large pieces of software that are 10+ GB by themselves and create intermediate files that can also exceed 5 GB per project. I have a project now where the files are 27 GB. With most laptops these days having limited SSD space, it isn't worth it.  As for some other design tools such as Cadence, you can't even get the tools on your computer because of licensing agreements, and the cost of a personal license is thousands of dollars. Piracy is not an option because this software is very niche and you're going to have a lot of trouble finding a crack anywhere.  One of the only things I might recommend installing yourself is MATLAB, which costs like $100 or something, or one of its free alternatives.  What I do, however, is remotely connect to the university servers (via x11) and run the software on a virtual machine. I get all of the access to university software and processing power regardless of what system I'm connected with. If your university doesn't have something like that, I think I would still recommend going to the lab over installing things on your own computer."

I have a Surface that I use because it's good for taking notes and it works A-okay.   Also for projects do you not use a cloud and keep a usb flash drive to store your projects?   Moving files is irrelevant with remote access. I just log into the school servers from wherever I am, and my environment/files are there. To be specific, I use git for keeping track of any code, Google drive for anything not code, and the school's file system for anything that I don't need to share.  Also relying on flash drives is a very bad idea. They are very prone to forgetting/losing, and Murphy's law is usually in full effect here."

If you plan on working on your laptop a lot (beyond just talking notes), you might want a good size screen so that you don't have to strain your eyes. If you're going to do a lot of work on your desktop, then you should get a laptop that's best suited for the things you plan to do with it.

I mean, I guess you won't need to, but having MATLAB on my computer has been vastly preferable to going to the lab to work on homework assignments. I can just sit in the lounge in the company of friends while I do work, as opposed to being a recluse who spends all his time in the engineering building.  There are a lot of freeware programs out there, and many providers offer free versions of their software to students, so it's easy to get the software on your computer. Some programs I have on my computer include MATLAB, Eagle PCB, Python, AWR Microwave Office, LTSPICE, Cadence PSPICE, and Pro/Engineer. Every single one of those programs were free, and I have used them for homework assignments, research, and internships in the past.  None of these programs are terribly processor or memory intensive to my knowledge, so you shouldn't need a computer with amazing specs.  Definitely get a Windows PC though. A lot of programs don't have Mac versions. I have a good friend in EE who has a Macbook, but he uses Boot Camp to dual boot Windows on his machine to run engineering software.

EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,gimpwiz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"Normalize it to the standard scale:  A+ = 4.0 if you have it (note, some schools actually give this a 4.333, but in most schools an A+ does not exist so you shouldn't.)  A = 4.0  A- = 3.667 or 3.7  B+ = 3.333 or 3.3  B = 3.0  and so on.  Next, multiply each numerical grade by the number of credit hours that course was worth. Finally, divide the sum of the numerical grades by the sum of the credit hours you have taken. (In other words, an average.)  The easiest way to do this is to make a simple spreadsheet to track grades, with rules that do the rest of the conversion and averaging, because when you have x courses of varying credit hours, it's easy to slip up, and it'd be really embarrassing if you were off by a 0.1 GPA and someone decided later you did it out of malicious intent and/or the company had very strict policies about this sort of thing."
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,gimpwiz,2,Fri Jul 17 02:33:47 2015 UTC,"My school does give an A+, which is 12/12, and A which is 11/12. I feel like counting A as perfect might not be a good idea. Especially since this chart that /u/Darkknight512 linked to says A is actually 3.9/4. I don't want to ""overstate"" my GPA and get accused of doing it with malicious intent."
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,KennyGaming,2,Fri Jul 17 02:53:42 2015 UTC,"Feel free to do what the chart says, if you prefer.  However, if an A is usually a 93+ as it is in most US schools, then feel free to make it a 4.0 as that's what we do."
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,gjoeyjoe,3,Fri Jul 17 03:29:02 2015 UTC,Just edited the OP. I'm in Canada so it's not really the same. The chart is Canadian so it's probably my best bet.
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,gjoeyjoe,3,Fri Jul 17 03:59:36 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're selling yourself short. An A is a 4.0
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,massifjb,4,Fri Jul 17 03:08:00 2015 UTC,If A is 11/12 is it really equivalent to 4/4?
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,gjoeyjoe,3,Fri Jul 17 04:01:38 2015 UTC,99% of places put an A as 4 points. Whether or not it translates the same (maybe an A at your school isn't what constitutes an A at my school) probably isn't relevant to employers. Just count an A as an A and give yourself 4 points
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,TurboHertz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:56:16 2015 UTC,"If I have a perfect 4.0 GPA on the 4-point scale but my actual GPA isn't perfect out of 12, doesn't that look a bit weird though?"
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,KyleGG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:25 2015 UTC,"It looks weird when people have over 4.0 gpas, but some schools do that. On your transcript, I'd go by grade received instead of points given. It sounds like you did very well in your classes, so don't undersell yourself."
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,Moncion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:33 2015 UTC,"I guess maybe I would have a 4.0 if I went to a school that uses that system, but I don't see how I could justify putting a perfect GPA on my resume and then having an employer check my transcript and see that it's not perfect."
EngineeringStudents,3dkuu9,Moncion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"I would second asking the career center at your school how they typically convert GPA to the 4.0 scale.  That said, at my school and most schools I am aware of, an A and A+ are both worth 4.0. Many professors at my university do not give A+ at all. A+ is usually given to exceptionally well performing students, far beyond the norm.   If an employer is asking about the discrepancy between a 4.0 and your 11/12, just state that the 12 point scale treats A and A+ as numerically different, whereas the 4 point scale does not. Frankly with such a high grade point, I doubt most employers will be concerned."

EngineeringStudents,3djxds,Erick_James,8,Thu Jul 16 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"A first semester course in Linear Algebra will be pretty simple computationally. The vast majority of computations you will be doing will be arithmetic, with a bit of very basic algebra thrown in. I'd be surprised if your knowledge of Calculus is ever used in that class.  That's not to say the class will be a breeze, though. I suppose it all depends on how your professor teaches and what material you cover, but Linear can get pretty difficult when you start covering abstract topics like Vector Spaces."
EngineeringStudents,3djxds,TimoKinderbaht,6,Fri Jul 17 00:17:31 2015 UTC,"We got introduced to vector spaces this week. Our prof begged us not to get hung up on what a vector space is. It's basically just a way of expressing the axioms of Rn, and used to introduce topics like subspaces...at least it won't be on our midterms.   It's a no calculator course. I found Calc II easier D:"
EngineeringStudents,3djxds,Elesh,3,Fri Jul 17 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"Vector spaces are one of those things that are confusing as fuck at first, but the longer you have to process the idea and the more you work with them, the more they make sense. In lin alg in first year I didn't get it at all, but when they got reintroduced for continuum mechanics in grad school the concept seemed really easy and it was hard to remember why exactly I found it so hard to grasp in the first place.  The same happened with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Taught in lin alg with no context or explanation of why they were useful I did not get it at all. In second year quantum mechanics and control theory they were used to solve problems or calculate values with actual physical meaning and suddenly the concept made so much sense."
EngineeringStudents,3djxds,qubat,2,Fri Jul 17 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"I found Calc II easier than Linear as well. I mean yeah, series suck a lot, but pretty much everything else in that course was pretty manageable.  I had the same professor for Calc III and Linear I and both of those rank among the hardest classes I've ever taken. I took both of those as math courses, not engineering courses, so my Linear class involved proofs as well. Those subjects are really cool when you dig deeply into them, but man are they tough when taught thoroughly like that."
EngineeringStudents,3djxds,TimoKinderbaht,6,Fri Jul 17 04:25:17 2015 UTC,I just graduated with my BSME and I put off linear till my last semester...in my opinion linear is a lot easier than DiffEQ or even Calc 3. Just get you a TI-Nspire cuz most of the class is just calculator work and memorizing the process! It's not hard unless your professor makes you do stuff by hand..
EngineeringStudents,3djxds,MrRiverRabbit,12,Fri Jul 17 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"Man, I envy anyone who's allowed to use a graphing calculator in Linear.

EngineeringStudents,3di150,I_DONT_LIKE_THIS111,107,Thu Jul 16 13:03:35 2015 UTC,"The only challenging part is finding out information, learning about the processes, etc. They don't assign me much at all. Two days ago the only task I was given was to combine two spreadsheets into one and filling in missing data that was there. In all honesty, I could've finished it in an hour tops, but I took the whole day since they have nothing else for me to do. My boss & mentor were a little upset it took me all day, but I would've had two full days of just sitting around then.   The purpose of an internship isn't to have you working your ass off, it's to see if you're a good fit for the company and someone they might be interested in hiring later. Do the assignments they give you in a timely manner, be kind and helpful but not annoying, try to learn something and make a good impression. That's all you need to do in an internship.   I just don't like it. I asked my manager multiple times that I've had hours of free time during the week and could take on an actual project. Everytime I've asked, he's mentioned he'll look into it, but nothing comes of it.   You'll be gone in another, what, five or six weeks at most? Unless they have something super short-term that has no possibility of requiring future support, they aren't going to put you on anything. Because you won't be around to see it through.   To me, it seems like bs work. Anyone could do this, they didn't have to say they wanted an engineering intern.   No one needs interns for doing real work. Internships are there as a part of a company's investment in their future labor pool.  Incidentally, most real work is bullshit work. It's working with spreadsheets, sitting in meetings, and writing up reports, while continuing to be someone others can work with and rely on. Turns out it's not actually bullshit--it's just part of the overhead of large groups of people trying to work together.   Anyway, I don't plan on quitting since it pays more than any retail job I could get and it will look good on my resume. So I guess, how do I deal with a possible bad experience from both ends? (Me not liking it and a potential bad review?)   Shape up in the last few weeks, try to do something about any bad impressions you might have left."

It's a cakewalk internship and all he has to do is smile big, do some paperwork, and then twiddle his thumbs until they need him. Instead he's purposely prolonging work and complaining repeatedly."
EngineeringStudents,3di150,Picklebiscuits,75,Thu Jul 16 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"This says to me just a lack of maturity.  I hire engineering interns every year and get a pretty substantial amount of time with them. Some come in with a good attitude from the start and are quite productive. Some come in terrible from the beginning and quickly come around with a little coaching. Some just aren't that good, sometimes because they just aren't a great fit for the role.  I can think of a couple in particular that came in expecting a cakewalk, and one almost got fired and the other was almost not asked back for another rotation (which is practically a given that they will be). They became two of the best ones to come through here, and it's mostly because they were talented but not mature enough to understand that real effort is required in the workplace to earn respect.  I think that what I most want to communicate to OP is that three weeks in, this isn't an abnormal experience and it's not really telling in regards to the workplace in general. Three weeks in, I only really ask that my interns are learning the processes. You aren't going to be challenged because frankly your superiors have no idea if you're useful at all. In any job experience your responsibility will slowly increase as you demonstrate the ability to handle it, be it full time or at an internship, or even if you're a mop guy at McDonald's.   Basically, you might think you're the smartest guy in the world and it's good that you want to be challenged, but for all your boss knows you're a complete fuckup. He can't risk giving you critical work if he doesn't know it's going to get done quickly and accurately. So take what you're given, do it quickly and accurately, and show initiative. Help improve the process if you can. Like any other relationship in the world, the direct report relationship is one of trust, and you have yet to earn that trust. Stretching work to take up your whole day when it shouldn't is the absolute opposite of doing that, and it screams entitled child to me."

He just doesn't know how to deal with his boring job he thought would be cool, and doesn't (or won't yet) see the for the trees - that basically interns are hazed before/if they get actual work. I had just about the exact same attitude with my first internship. What's so impressive about finishing a spreadsheet fast, and why would you care?

OP: Do stuff at a reasonable pace.  If you can do it in an hour, do so.  This makes you look good.  If you still don't like working there, then don't apply for a job with them after... but you can still get a recommendation from that manager if you do a good job!  As for what to do when bored... It really depends on your work environment.  You've indicated that you've tried to get more assignments.  Keep trying.  But if you have nothing to do, consider having something to read or study.  Something educational is ideal, especially if it's related to the work done at the company, because then you're getting paid to better yourself in a way that, again, makes you more appealing as a full-time job candidate.  Ebooks are also a viable option, if you're mostly on the computer at work.  It lets you read, even for entertainment, without looking as distracted as you would while reading a paperback at your desk.  Avoid games, videos, or anything that looks very much like goofing off.   Do the assignments they give you in a timely manner, be kind and helpful but not annoying, try to learn something and make a good impression. That's all you need to do in an internship.   I don't completely agree with this.  A good internship should give you something to do that directly affects the company as a whole in some positive way.  Not just ""make life a little easier for some of the engineers by taking on the boring work""--though that is acceptable work for an intern--but also making progress on a project that matters external to the immediate group.  There are tasks that, if one person has the kind of time available that OP does, can easily be completed in the 2-4 months of a typical internship.  And quite frankly, a lot of the value in an internship is to have something on your resume afterward that says, ""I did ___ and it helped the company by ____.""    Examples (from my 2 internships):   I wrote a program to parse prescan data, and it helped the company by reducing the time needed to analyze data going forward. I wrote specifications for a specific aspect of motherboard design, with the help of my mentor, which will give manufacturers the information required to produce them properly, and provide groundwork for future platforms. I wrote instructions to clean up Cadence Allegro files for electromagnetic simulation, which will reduce training or review time needed in order to prepare these files.  (This is a task that is needed about twice per platform, which means about once a year.  There is a lot of experimenting with the tools to figure it out... or an intern could write instructions that remove the need to spend hours fiddling with the software.) I designed and programmed a device to test WLAN interactivity between products.  I was unable to finish due to time constraints of a summer internship, but left my work in a state that would allow it to be completed in a matter of weeks.  This device will make it much simpler to test products, as they will not need to be removed from their current test facilities in order to use it.   Anything that helps a product get out the door or increases efficiency on a larger scale than ""just while I was there"" is good.  ""I combined excel files"" doesn't work nearly as well for proving your worth to a potential employer, because that falls into the category of ""they got the trained monkey to do it while they had one available"" (no offense to OP, but that's how some companies treat interns as a rule).  All that said, OP: There will be times when you are bored.  Please do not whine about it.  Don't take it out on your manager.  You can ask for more work, but don't say ""because I'm bored and I'm spending 7-8 hours a day twiddling my thumbs.""  They probably know that, but saying it comes off as rude, and will probably affect your review--not in your favor.  Full-time engineers still have times when they are bored and have little to do.  They have to write reports, monkey around with spreadsheets, and send emails and make phone calls.  It's part of having a job.  Also, if you haven't tried this already--find an engineer who doesn't mind you hanging around, and ask to shadow them whenever they're doing something that works well with shadowing (e.g. lab work, testing, building stuff, thinking-out-loud through designs).

EngineeringStudents,3di150,AmIAnIdiot_Yes,16,Fri Jul 17 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"Two days ago the only task I was given was to combine two spreadsheets into one and filling in missing data that was there. In all honesty, I could've finished it in an hour tops, but I took the whole day since they have nothing else for me to do.   You should have written a Python or VBA script to do it for you. That way when they ask you to do it again you could just do it automatically. Spend your 'free' time documenting the code and rolling it into an EXE (py2exe) for other people. Next time it comes up they don't have to ask you for that they just do it themselves and you move on to something more difficult.   My boss & mentor were a little upset it took me all day   That's a bad thing. You should have told them it would take a half a day and done it in a few hours.   sitting in on meetings, and making calls.    Yeah, we all do that too. Who do you think is sitting next to you in the meeting?   To me, it seems like bs work. Anyone could do this   Most work is. Who do you think we make do the BS work? The ones that are paid the lowest. Me doing BS work costs the company $100/hr. You doing BS work doesn't.   they didn't have to say they wanted an engineering intern.    Maybe you should trust that they know what they want more than what you think they want. There's a reason they recruited engineering students.   I would've had two full days of just sitting around then.   There's a website called Reddit you should visit to kill time. There were also Fark and Slashdot. As well as a bunch of other ones. How well do you know Python? There's codeacademy."

EngineeringStudents,3di150,Lobobot,5,Fri Jul 17 01:11:05 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm also currently doing an internship. Have been doing it for a month and I was also facing the same situation for my first week. My second week on wards were very busy but my tasks were just like how you described. It was all the easiest and most boring tasks, BUT (and this is a big BUT), I always ask the engineers what the projects were about and how significant were my given assignments. Don't just blindly do it, you must understand what you're doing. If the engineers at your company don't answer your questions, that is an indication that you should start packing and leave. Anyway, what kind of company are you working for? Property? Consultant?How large is it? If you're working for consultant, try to be a little bit more patient, there's a lot of project and you'll definitely get your chance. However, if you're in a property developer company, well, let's just say that you won't have that much luck....sorry dude TT... But their pay is awesome!! Right now, the engineers at my company finally ask me to assist them to run analysis (and it is on a frequent basis!) Yeah! =)  I sincerely hope your internship will get better as I know how you're feeling right now. Cheers!"

I've done other things like putting them away (learning the organization of the company), cleaning my work station and putting tools away (learning where things go and how we recycle cardboard and other shipping supplies), and also some production floor work (how its organized and the flow).

It may be boring and easy, but kill that shit and they will give you more responsibility. Are there other interns? compete with them if possible. If people think you don't do anything around there that is a failed internship. Instead of asking for a project from now on - since that doesn't look like its going to happen - ask for more bs work, honestly. You're going to have to show some enthusiasm to prove yourself around there if you want to be more involved. I'm sure they can tell what your intentions are if you're dragging your tasks on all day like that."

I took advantage of my excel tasks to learn and become familiar with everything I can in excel including VBA. In classes you might learn how to code something but if you aren't solving a real problem it doesn't always stick with you. I started by learning how to make a quick button I can press to scroll to the bottom of a huge page of data. It's a pretty simple task, but now I know how to do it and it makes it much easier to enter in new data without scrolling through 1000 rows of data. They were impressed with my excel sheet, even though it was a fairly simple task, I polished that turd. I try to find things I can do to learn and make myself more useful. I ordered a textbook for a class i'm taking next semester that's related to what i'm doing in the internship and I'll read a chapter of that if I have nothing to do. I got a hold of a copy of AutoCAD and made a few drawings thinking I was going to do some real drawings later on.

EngineeringStudents,3di150,MiddleClassSeaBass,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"Just to give you some perspective:   I've had internships that went the complete opposite direction. I was given work that did not match my skillset (miscommunication between HR and the team I was working for) and basically told ""Figure it out if you can. If you don't, we didn't really need the project anyways."" At the end of the summer, I didn't produce a final product nearly of the caliber of what I was hoping to make, but I walked away having taught myself a ton. It was work I personally never planned on doing in the future, but I understood a lot more than I had previously. The way I saw it, the company I was working for had kinda screwed me. The best I could make of the situation was to use the opportunity to get paid to learn something new.   I've also had internships like yours where I was basically doing office administrative work. What I found to be the most useful was to quickly and efficiently finish any work that was given to me (which led to strong recommendations after the fact), and using the downtime to read up on current events and news related to the work my company was doing.   Moral of the story: Even if an internship isn't what you hoped, try to make the best out of a shitty situation."
EngineeringStudents,3di150,capnwally,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an internship.  I WAS in the same situation (though I LOVE working for this company), where I didn't have much to do, so I just went up to to other engineers in my department and see what they are doing, or to just BS with them.  I had the same thoughts 2 months ago, but now I am dipping my hands in almost every department of the company doing all sorts of work. Some days it's being on the line putting some bullshit in, and some days it's pulling out a bunch of stuff to run testing on it.  Internships are what you make of it. You're the boss of you, and you have to go and FIND the work."

I probably spend 70% of my time at my internship browsing reddit and I still outperform the majority of my team due only to the fact that I am well versed in the MSOffice suite and assimilate new processes easily.  Get a gym membership, burn the boredom and the anger after work at the weights.  You'll be making good money, and the emotional distress will turn into an athletic build.

EngineeringStudents,3dj2ma,MrWoodcack,7,Thu Jul 16 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"For the most part I'd say no.  Pigeon-holing into an industry usually happens after like 8-10 years of full-time in a single industry.  It's certainly not as easy to go from food processing to say... aerospace than it is to go from aerospace back to aerospace, but you're probably just as competitive as a candidate trying to go from like consumer products to aerospace, and definitely more competitive than any candidate with no prior internship experience.  I'm not sure what year you are, but if you really want to go into Aero and you have at least another summer of interning left try and hold out for an aero internship offer during the fall, but this means applying to aero companies of all sizes (from startups to the megacorps like Boeing/Lockheed). I'd say that having experience at a small-midsize aero company would make you a more competitive candidate than an internship in any other industry (regardless of size or perceived prestige)."

Got a grand total of 2 interviews all of junior year, luckily got an offer from one of them for a position at a small-midsize manufacturing company.   Fast forward a year and 7 of 11 companies I visited at my school's career fair gave me interviews for internships, had to turn down two more offers for interviews in October because I had to accept an offer already (2 week deadline).

Also, if you're getting manufacturing experience, that's always highly desired so learn what you can - GD&T, process flow, optimization, six sigma, learn all you can and then massage your resume to reflect the skills you bring to the table, even if from an outside industry."

I was working in a plant primarily troubleshooting different machines. When I was going to career fairs this was the thing most companies pointed to. They were intrigued and talked to me about these sorts of positions, even if they had other ones open. I wanted to get a more design oriented position, so this was kinda annoying. Yeah it did open some doors, but it wasn't the ideal situation. I did get an internship that was supposed to be more design, but people did think I had a interest in manufacturing, which complicated things a bit. I'm not sure if this will relate to what you're doing. My first internship was in the automotive industry and the other one is in defense. Take and/or keep whatever opportunity you have because it's probably better than nothing."

EngineeringStudents,3dk8ry,brownmojo,2,Thu Jul 16 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the typical professor trying to weed out students. Especially with the no partial credit, that's over the top. All my exams in my education have been written exams, but they give partial credit. Also, statics is the basic fundamentals of civil engineering and prereqs to other courses, so you're going to have to pass it one way or another.   I'm on the fence about this (but I'm thinking it out as I write), since you are going to be a junior this year, so you'll probably be in school for possibly another ~2 years since you transferred majors. If you do drop it now, when will you be able to take the course again? And if you drop it, how will it affect your graduation date?  If you choose grind it out: what's the reason for the poor grades on the exams? Are the questions tougher than the homework? Not enough time? Not understanding the concepts? You mention the grading is tough, does the professor take off points for wrong labeling, rounding, significant figures, formulas, etc.? If you feel comfortable with the material, and the grading is the only issue, work on how to minimize those things the professor takes points off on. When is the final supposed to be posted? If you're not comfortable with understanding all the material, you should cut your losses and drop the course. I've had professors who curve and don't curve, but I always assume there is no curve, and I think you should make the same assumption.  Check out this YouTube Channel if you haven't seen it before already. This helped me immensely when I was taking mechanics of materials (or strength of materials, however your university names it).  Best of luck! And if you need any other resources, let me know."
EngineeringStudents,3dk8ry,meeshu321,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. If I drop it now, I would be able to take it again once the Fall starts. I would need at the very least an extra five semesters whether I passed the class this summer or not. I feel as if I understand the material completely while doing the book problems and homework, but the exam problems are somewhat of a different beast. I've also made a ton of stupid little mistakes on the exams which destroyed my grade considering an algebra mistake makes you get the whole problem wrong. The final will be posted the first week of August. I kind of just want to stick this out, but I feel like there's so many unknown variables right now regarding the final. Its definitely been a psyche killer having my first real civil class be like this. I do very much want to succeed though."

If you don't pass, you can always do a grade recalculation. The F will be on your transcript, but it's not going to ruin your academic or engineering career. And the next time you take the course you'll know how its going to be.   Check out that YouTube channel and see if that helps. If you've still got some issues, I can propose other places for help.   Don't let this get you down. Engineering is challenging, but it's not difficult. I also got discouraged when I was taking calc II.

When you make it into 8.5 by 11 size it doesn't zoom in to the lines so you can write as you normally would between the lines. And there's no way to automatically generate a new page of 8.5 by 11 as you go. Am I missing something? I would prefer an app that lets you have 8.5 by unlimited length and you can keep writing and afterwards you can export to pdf that makes the margins etc...

I absolutely love onenote and am legitimately upset there is nothing better to replace it and there is absolutely no linux analog.   I don't enable grids or lines when I take notes. I set the zoom level to whatever is comfortable and write, scroll with my finger, write, draw diagram, scroll with my finger, repeat. I never would ever wish to limit myself to 8.5"" of virtual paper as there is no reason to. I never export them either; my notes were created as digitally ink and stay digital ink.

Fourier is the same general concept, but involves superposition of sinusoids.  It's probably easier to explain what they are than it is to explain how they work without just resorting to a cookbook approach to math. Also, there's a fair bit of background to explain how to get there to a complete layman."

For example, in music, the bass drum has mostly low frequencies, the guitar has lots of middle frequencies, and a cymbal has lots of high frequencies.  When all these are mixed together the sound wave looks like a jumbled mess, but looking at its frequencies with a Fourier transform allows separation and identification of the different components."

EngineeringStudents,3dh6yq,hclchicken,3,Thu Jul 16 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"Pressure is a measure of how fast and how hard gas particles are running into other things. If you're in an airplane that is descending, more air runs into your ears with more force, so you feel your ears pop.  Fugacity is a measure of how often and how hard gas particles run into other things on a molecular level. In an ideal gas, the two are the same, but in reality some gas particles are ""stickier"" than others, some are ""bouncier"", and we need to take those qualities into account.   So if you're studying a chemical reaction, use fugacity. If you're studying a gas's physical impact on something large-scale, use pressure."
EngineeringStudents,3dh6yq,svipdag_DM,3,Thu Jul 16 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"Ideal gases have a bunch of nice properties than make them easy to model, but real gases deviate from this model and that difference has to be corrected for in chemical reactions.  For a real gas at a certain pressure, fugacity is the pressure an ideal gas would have to be to have the same chemical properties.  For example, real nitrogen at 100 atm is chemically the same as ideal nitrogen at only 97.03 atm (the fugacity), so for chemical calculations you can use the fugacity of 97.03 atm and the properties of an ideal gas instead of mucking around with more complicated real gases."

My first year never felt too difficult, and it also felt like I was taking a lot of boring, non-engineering courses (Microeconomics, Chemistry, a Lit Course for general credit, etc.).  Second year is where the difficulty ramped up a lot, but I didn't mind because everything I was learning was so much more interesting and felt like actual engineering.   I took Circuit Analysis + Lab, Diffy Q, Statics (required for EEs at my school for some stupid reason), Modern Physics and Criminology (general credit) my first semester.  Then I took Signals and Systems, Digital Circuits, Linear Algebra I, Discrete Math, and Electronics I + Lab my second semester.

EngineeringStudents,3dfv53,LeighmurBJJ,27,Thu Jul 16 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"Naw man, don't undervalue your work or devalue the work of the profession. The reason the stereotype of the coffee fetching intern exists is because it does exist! If people are free you're going to ""hire""  them for any stupid task. How can we ensure that engineering internships actually give experience unless the company needs to think about what real work needs to be done for money? In Ontario we have a nice bonus of. 3k per 4 months for the company hiring the intern so there's good incentive without making it dumb.   I do hiring of coops now and this is awesome. Sure I'd have like ten minions if they were free but they wouldn't all be doing valuable work to give themselves experience.   As a side note check the graphic design subreddits and see how mad people get about unpaid gigs and spec work, it's created a bad landscape in the industry :("

EngineeringStudents,3dfv53,Jorlung,2,Thu Jul 16 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"I get paid $13 an hour, which is above U.S. minimum wage, and everyone in my class gets paid over $10.50 an hour.  $15/hr is not uncommon to hear of - I think the giant aerospace companies like Pratt and Whittney pay $15.  That said, I live in an area with a lot of engineering companies and low cost of living."

EngineeringStudents,3dfv53,CorporateNterest,3,Thu Jul 16 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"Most is definitely a vast overstatement. I'd say average is probably around $17-18/h for summer internships (I know plenty of people making like $14-16/h on their summer internship), and like $20-24/h for year long internships. At my school the average salary for an 12 month intern is like $40k-45k, so definitely not quite $26/h. I have heard of people making like $50-60k on their 12 month internship, but that's by no means average.  Maybe $26/h is average in like Alberta oil and gas, but Canada wide that's not average at all."

When you're working purely in an art form, the people who established a lot of the industry standards are people who have been acting on their passions for decades with rigorous study and training. Especially in the entertainment industry (which is where most art students want to go), the people who ""make it"" have had to study and practice far more than any curriculum taught in schools (aside from a select few like CalArts or FZD).  Compare that to the curriculum taught in schools (which is 90% of the time outdated), you get a bunch of kids with certificates that wonder why they don't fit in the industry. Because they have false impressions that the workload in school is close to the industry standard, when it's not even remotely a fraction. FFS I even came in as a guest instructor at a local college for their anatomy lecture and people couldn't pay attention let alone draw for shit. People have this false idea that drawing is just all fun and dandy and you get paid big money to make shitty fanart whenever you want to, but the industry requires a huge range of skill, knowledge, and work ethic. Tons of technical topics are brushed under the rug until after kids go to school for it, and all of a sudden, they lose their ""motivation."" Then you get a bunch of broke kids who didn't take advantage of 4 years of uninterrupted training working at starbucks because no sane art-director would hire them.

In the EU a student visa will allow you to work but only a limited number of hours as you are a student first in their eyes.   Look up student visa work hours for each country you're looking at and it should tell you.  EDIT: US apparently is only 20 hours a week of on campus employment.

Do you think it is possible to work as an entry-level engineer while doing a MSc? 16hrs/week means I could only work for about 3 hours every weekdays.   Btw, I need some advice, here is my current situation: Just finish my second year in civil engineering and currently doing an internship in geotechnical engineering at a consultant company for a period of 3 months.  I'm doing a 3-year BEng which means I would be graduating next year.  After graduating, I would like to start working as an entry level engineer for about 6months. Since I'm currently planning to specialise in Geotechnical Engineering, I would spend that period of time to make sure that this is really what I want to do.  Then, I'm gonna continue my MSc in Geotechnical Engineering while working part-time as an engineer.  Now, my questions are: 1) Should I apply for an internship or as an entry-level engineer after graduating my BEng? (I'm asking this because I'm only working for 6 months) 2) Right after my BEng, do you think I should work for a company in the country that I'm planning to continue my MSc? This is because I will be able to continue working for them as I'm doing my MSc.   So, what do you think? Your opinions are very very important to me and I really appreciate them.  Hope you reply soon. Thanks."
EngineeringStudents,3di9oq,Bananas_n_Pajamas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:01:44 2015 UTC,Working fulltime as an entry level engineer and doing your MSc would be almost impossible (at least in the US it is).   An MSc isn't a breeze so don't take it lightly. Work a small part-time job like in a coffee house or a bookstore and then in your summers get another internship. Graduate and you'll be ready for a full-time position.
EngineeringStudents,3di3ek,igivenofux,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:25:16 2015 UTC,"Idk about the UNCW program, but most schools have something similar for their engineering programs. Whether or not you can get your degree in 2 years after transferring really depends in what type of student you are. A lot of students have to repeat some of the harder engineering classes like statics and dynamics. On the otherhand, a lot of people graduate on schedule no problem. It really depends on you. If you really HAVE to graduate in 2 years, worst case scenario, you can take summer classes, but you'll miss out on good internship opportunities."
EngineeringStudents,3di3ek,queen_of_mars,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I really want to graduate in 4 years because my gi bill will run out if I take any longer.
EngineeringStudents,3di3ek,clearcoat_ben,2,Thu Jul 16 16:33:53 2015 UTC,"Just gotta buckle down then. I'm using the GI Bill for my BS in Mechanical Engineering right now. Upper level math courses, and the more rigorous engineering courses tend to be the trip ups for many engineers, on the GI Bill or not. So just make sure you're dedicated, work hard, improve your study habits (they can always be better), use assistance where you can find it - either school run tutoring, ask other students, and the VA will pay for private tutoring as well (up to a certain $$).   Also, you get 36 months of benefits, after a few semesters I looked at how many days I had used, how many I had left, and it looks like I may have enough bennies left over for one additional semester. Because if you begin a semester with any bennies left, the VA pays for the whole semester. Just don't waste time on half-loaded semesters, or taking a single course over the summer. If you ever have to take one course over a summer or something, pay for that out of pocket.   Also, talk to the appropriate advisor at NC State ahead of time and make sure everything you plan on taking at UNCW will transfer.   Also, check both campuses for Student Veterans groups  - they can help you navigate some of the paperwork hurdles that we face. Most schools have a chapter that is a part of the national Student Veterans Association http://www.studentveterans.org.   Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,whitezul,14,Wed Jul 15 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"I went CpE because I enjoyed coding, but preferred to have my code interact with real world objects, rather than the results just being displayed on the screen. I'm assuming what your cousin meant by that quote is that CpE is a specialization of EE. I can see the logic there. After all, my undergraduate level CpE classes were nearly all combined with graduate level EE classes. I think the fact that CpEs need to learn a good amount of programming is what sways me away from categorizing it as a specialization.   Why do people think studying 4 years should be invested in something 'better' than CompE?   I don't know how you can quantify which is better.   Should I go CompE?   If you enjoy programming and working with hardware, don't let the uniformed opinion of your cousin sway you."

I really appreciate this sentiment and it reflects how I feel as well. I don't want to be limited to software. This makes me more content with deciding to go CompE.   I don't know how you can quantify which is better.   I was mirroring the public opinion here. I really don't believe it myself. I just noticed that publicly, the name electrical engineer carries more weight than computer engineer.   If you enjoy programming and working with hardware, don't let the uniformed opinion of your cousin sway you.   I do. I want to program more than EE, and I might even get into game development on the side. At the same time, I want to deal with hardware more than a CS major. If CompE covers the field between EE and CS, I think I might belong there."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,Darkknight512,7,Wed Jul 15 19:52:17 2015 UTC,Computer engineers can work in silicon design and have an easier time getting jobs in pure software. We can be better suited for embedded software where we integrate the electrical side and software side stuff but all of these things are based on the person. There is no reason an electrical engineer can't work in a programming job or a computer engineer working in controls or circuit board design or radio stuff. They are largely more equivilent degrees then people think.
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,onewiseowl,3,Wed Jul 15 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"Say, if I do end up doing CompE (By now, about 75% probability), what are the courses I should make sure to study as electives, in order to bring me closer to EE?

EngineeringStudents,3deur9,frostypoptarts,2,Thu Jul 16 12:56:32 2015 UTC,"Most CpE programs are 3/4 of an EE degree mashed together with 3/4 of a CS degree. This leaves very little time for electives.  For example, I get to pick a grand total of six courses over four years. One of those is a relatively free choice of some kind of art course, another is a choice between business writing or technical writing, one is a choice from among a handful of higher math courses, and three of them are my choice from a list of four EE and CS courses (essentially, pick which course you don't take). Everything else is already selected.  On the flip side, it does make advisement pretty easy."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,Darkknight512,2,Thu Jul 16 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why not do EE with an emphasis in programming? A lot of ee classes require tons of other ee pre reqs whereas programming classes are a bit less. I'm not saying EE is better, but I find it to be more flexible in career options especially if you focus on programming as well. I was a CompE major but switched because I really wanted a better chance to deal with hardware. And EE definitely does. But that's just my opinion! Feel free to ask questions or critique what I said lol"
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,reddit409,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest my reason for not doing so is that my current impression of EE is that it's bloated with stuff that I really don't care about, and CompE less so, at least in my school. The time I would spend on all the courses to do with power generating, I'd rather use it in learning things like.. artificial intelligence. The reason why that probability isn't 100% is because EE is still interesting to me.. It's like real life magic, and it's also very flexible, like you said. I can easily walk into the Aerospace or Biomedical industry with an EE degree. I'm not sure if it's the same for CompE.  That said, I want to go to grad school after I'm done, and I will study something different. If I went CompE, then definitely something more centered on hardware, or maybe Mechatronics which encompasses all. If I succeed in doing so, then no more flexibility concerns."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,Hurricane043,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with everything you said and you should obviously do whate makes you happiest. With the grad school thing though, wouldn't your cousin be somewhat right that ee would be better for undergrad then grad school do the compE? It's kinda like getting a broad understanding and then zeroing in on a very particular focus. I think he has a pojnt because its more traditional to do it that way, but like I said you should do what feels best!"
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,Brianfellowes,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"EEs normally take some signsls, signal processing, radio modulation, and electromagnitism courses. They usually also have more options to take semiconductor physics and optical communications stuff."

EngineeringStudents,3deur9,TheUnlimitedGenius,4,Thu Jul 16 15:59:26 2015 UTC,"When does one pick CompE over EE   If you are sure you want a job in almost anything digital or relating to computers, or you want a job in programming.    why is it treated as an inferior   It is not treated as inferior. Quite the opposite. CPE graduates on average earn higher salaries than EE graduates.  Let me try to explain what your cousin means. EE is a massive field. CPE is essentially a concentration of EE that got so large that it warranted its own major. To give an example, other concentrations of EE include power, communications, and semiconductors, which in themselves are all very unrelated to CPE and each other. If you go into CPE, you are committing yourself to that concentration. If you are going CPE you are highly likely not going into power. Sure, you can take power electives if you want to. But why would you want to? It would hurt you in your own major and you wouldn't get nearly enough depth as an EE in that concentration. On the other hand, if you start out as EE, you have more leeway to branch into CPE and power at the same time. However, be aware that doing this will reduce your depth in either field, and there really is no tangible benefit to doing. You aren't going to fabricate semiconductors in the morning and then go program an embedded system in the afternoon.  So your cousin isn't wrong, but it isn't great advice either. You can start out as EE and move into CPE if you want, but you can't start out as CPE and move into a ""pure"" EE field easily. However, if CPE is your goal, doing this is not the best course of action.  To easily solve this issue, just double major."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,unionfind,3,Thu Jul 16 12:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing you can do it take a hard look at the differences in the graduation requirements for the two. The classes that you take will help determine your engineering background, which helps determine your career. The major you select is simply a restriction on the set of classes you can take. Being a EE doesn't mean no programming unless either A) you decide not to take any programming courses, or B) the EE grad requirements are such that you can't/wouldn't be able to take any programming classes (which I have found is typically not the case). At my school you can specialize in computer architecture or VLSI through either the EE program or the CE program. You can also specialize in operating systems through either the CE or CS program.  Basically, I'm trying to say that you should look at the classes that interest you the most and find out which major better allows you to pursue that path based on the degree requirements."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,CapturedSoul,3,Thu Jul 16 00:10:49 2015 UTC,"What intro classes have you taken? Most EE and CE programs have heavily overlapping intro classes (intro programming, electromagnetic physics, etc). You sound like you want to build robots and things like that, both designing the control boards/systems and programming them, rather than the individual components. I think CE gives a good balance of CS and EE. I wish more CS students took some basic EE courses. On that note, for the love of all things, take the intro logic course, even if its not required."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,BallsDeepinLogic,2,Thu Jul 16 05:54:53 2015 UTC,"At my university, EE and CpE are very similar. They remove some of the EE classes that include things like Radio Waves, and or frequency classes  (don't know about it too much), and the classes only diverge near after three years.   The main reason I'm in CpE is due to the fact that I enjoy coding AND embedded systems. I want to make both hardware and software myself if I have any future personal projects. You're less specialized but being versatile is a better when it comes to finding a job IMO.  If you enjoy coding and EE stuff go with CpE.  We make more money anyway."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,schreiberbj,2,Thu Jul 16 13:18:06 2015 UTC,"CompE is one of the most versatile engineering degrees you can get but a lot of people think CompE is 50/50 EE and Compsci, which is completely wrong. It's mostly EE with Algorithms/networks/computer architecture/etc thrown in instead of power and E&M. You can always pick up the compsci on your own.  At my school EEs and CpEs have same courses for 2 years (covering E&M, Calculus 1-3, Diff Eqns, circuit analysis, electronics, and programming in C,C++,assembly,verilog).  I'm thinking about switching to EE when I hit 3rd year."
EngineeringStudents,3deur9,unionfind,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"The main difference people usually reference is that CmpE does more coding and EE does more circuits (which is true).  To extend,what is CmpEng, the specific areas are related to EE. However instead of dealing with specific analog values (the type of numbers you see in your physics class), CmpE majors look at the bigger picture by abstracting this as high/low values (1s and 0s). This allows them to understand how embedded device/computers work a lot better."

The practice exam I took had a lot of concept questions but the actual exam I took had almost none. There were a couple of questions I could solve easily from a basic understanding of theory, but mostly it was just problems. Every test is different, but mine had a lot more statistics and hydraulics than I expected."
EngineeringStudents,3dekgu,billyspleen21,2,Wed Jul 15 23:04:35 2015 UTC,"EE who just passed the FE.    Easiest way is to prepare your study habits off the FE Exam Specifications. Notice how the sections are ordered.  Those topics are ordered almost identical to the list of functions in the FE Reference Handbook.  Also notice how certain sections have more questions than others.  Since the biggest topics in the exam are Math, Circuit Analysis, Electronics, Power, and Digital Systems, I spent more of my time with those topics over others.  I also used Kaplan's FE Electrical book for practice problems.  Big disclaimer though, the book is riddled with errors.  However, it was the only study book I could find that actually follows the new CBT format.   If there is a specific topic that you feel like you need much more practice problems, or even revisit its theory, I would suggest looking into the Schaum's Outline book series.  For example I used Schaum's Outline of Basic Circuit Analysis, 3ed to get more practice on phasors and impedance.    Overall the process I went through was overkill but it really helped me get prepared for the exam.  Hope this helps and good luck."

EngineeringStudents,3dcalp,DamnShadowbans,6,Wed Jul 15 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"Hah I was the same way until I got an internship. You have to use both in the field. For example, things are measured in feet and inches, but all the computer programs want inputs in decimal form."
EngineeringStudents,3dcalp,Nowhere_Man_Forever,7,Wed Jul 15 12:20:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but sometimes MML wants fractions, sometimes it wants decimals, but it never tells you which it wants.   Plus, it's much better to do calculations in fraction form, then convert to decimals if you need to at the end. That way it totally eliminates round off error."
EngineeringStudents,3dcalp,SoDel302,3,Wed Jul 15 12:58:50 2015 UTC,True. Just saying you have to use decimal notation quite a bit even if you don't want to.
EngineeringStudents,3dcalp,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Wed Jul 15 13:06:24 2015 UTC,For sure. I think decimals are more functional anyway. Fractions aren't easy to work with in your head by any means.

EngineeringStudents,3dcalp,Rickshaw-Racer,8,Wed Jul 15 05:40:47 2015 UTC,The only thing I dislike about that episode is him assuming that the value added formula couldn't possibly apply because it was originally developed for cattle breeding.
EngineeringStudents,3dcalp,Nowhere_Man_Forever,5,Wed Jul 15 12:21:40 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a pass, as it obviously doesn't apply in this case. The formula depends on the assumption that a cow will never get pregnant literally the day after its previous calf is born, so a ""perfect score"" is virtually impossible. This results in the bizarre situation that a girl who got a perfect score was ""underperforming"" according to the formula."
EngineeringStudents,3dcalp,TropicalAudio,7,Wed Jul 15 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but that it was developed for cattle means nothing. That's like saying the formula Pert was designed for interest and therefore it can't be applied to population growth."

I'm doing robotics, so a bit of mechanical, a bit of other stuff, but even the bit of mechanical I do requires windows for CAD. So your choices are:  1) Find a Linux version of everything, and accept possible compatibility issues. The CAD stuff is iffy, but there are some options. But the risk is putting in the time and effort doing the work, and discovering you can't export it in a form the lecturer is prepared to mark, or that your team-mates can use. This didn't seem worthwhile to me.  2) Work at the labs/library on school computers. If you're living on campus, this might be ok, but for me, again, not an attractive option. They frown on you opening a beer while you work, and they really don't like it if you take your trousers off.  3) VM. I use Virtualbox, but VmWare have a free player, or there's Xen or KVM. This is my preferred solution. Modern machines are usually powerful enough, and modern hypervisors are slim enough. You may have graphics issues, but I get excellent results in both solid works and autodesk inventor even with 3d stuff. But it is an overhead, and your mileage may definitely vary.  4) Suck it up.

You could do the same thing with Windows and connect to a Linux computer through SSH. Both my undergraduate and graduate engineering departments offer linux server nodes to students, you just had to ask the computer admins of your department directly for server address and an account. This is how much of engineering simulation work is done too (through SSH to a server cluster).  If you want to learn how to use Linux and SSH, try some projects like getting a minecraft or counter strike server running on a linux server on Amazon ec2 (just don't leave it running 24/7 or you'll owe a lot of money).   As an undergrad engineer I don't think you'll ever have a time where it is necessary to have Linux, but there will be times when Windows is necessary. If you do want to go on to graduate school in aerospace, having Linux experience would be good though. Most research FEM and CFD codes were originally written to be run in a linux environment."

Dell now makes an XPS 13 that comes with Ubuntu but I believe it is onboard graphics. It should handle Solidworks to a degree but it won't be as easy as just running it on Windows.  Also depends on what other programs you'll need for school. You can look at the websites for some of the schools you're interested in, or even contact the IT departments, but the safer bet is going to be getting a Windows machine.

There's a lot of practice, in addition to the concepts.

EngineeringStudents,3dgeld,marioo1182,2,Thu Jul 16 02:09:40 2015 UTC,With a MOSFET no current can flow through the gate. So what happens is there is zero potential across the R1 resistor and therefore the potential at the drain and the gate is the same. So therefore Vgs = Vds

It was kind of amazing to think about wires - which we had consistently discounted in our analyses to that point - have all kinds of crazy and useful properties. Being able to create a bandpass filter or an antenna simply by etching copper into a certain shape is pretty cool.  Control Systems was pretty interesting. There are so many things you can do with the transfer function of a system. That class got especially awesome when we started learning about the root locus and how it can be used to optimize certain characteristics of a system (like the rise time or percent overshoot) without sacrificing stability and minimizing error. All of that just by manipulating the poles and zeroes of the transfer function!  Modern Physics was pretty mindblowing too. Learning about special relativity and how time dilation and relativity of simultaneity can happen completely changed my view of the universe. Things like wave-particle duality, quantum models of the atom, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, Schrodinger's equation, and much more were fascinating and really piqued my curiosity after the relative mundanity of Physics I and II."

EngineeringStudents,3dduv3,riversfan17,5,Wed Jul 15 21:06:30 2015 UTC,Philosophy was my favorite class by far. I had an amazing professor and learned about a bunch of weird ideas about things.   I would say my favorite classes have more to do with the professors than the material we were learning. I really enjoyed my fluid mechanics class and mechanics of solids because the professors were awesome. They were also the two most technical and challenging classes I've taken.
EngineeringStudents,3dduv3,angryguywalking,3,Wed Jul 15 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"My favorite ""conventional"" class was ""Strategic Metals and Materials for the 21st Century."" We learned not just about the properties of materials, but other economic, political, and environmental issues - like which metals the US is entirely dependent on imports for, which have only a few decades of currently economical mine reserves, and why certain metals that we rely on are mainly produced as a byproduct of other metal production.  I also took a class that went on tours of local industries, like a steel mill, a company that made jet engine turbine blades, and a company that did ballistic testing."

I (and many others) am of the opinion that Linear Algebra is far more useful than Calc B, especially for engineering. Therefore, I assumed that you hadn't taken Linear Algebra yet, because if you had then you would agree that it is the most useful math class you'll ever take.  I'm mostly joking though. If you have taken both courses and still value Calc B more, who am I to say otherwise? If you haven't taken LA though, you should! It's tremendously useful and shows up everywhere, especially in engineering."

EngineeringStudents,3dduv3,unionfind,7,Wed Jul 15 19:05:26 2015 UTC,For me it's because it's the class where  I learned or perfected many math concepts and techniques that I've found myself using in many other classes. I found calc 3 to contain many things that I doubt I will ever use again. Calc 1 is very useful of course but calc 2 edges it out IMO.

I guess it's because things are much slower during summer in engineering companies since many engineers are on vacation so they want us to have some experience in a faster pace environment.  I prefer spring because the workers usually have more time to explain things, to guide and mentor you. During fall, non-IT people at the office are coming back from summer vacations and they'll call a lot the IT support (forgotten passwords, etc.), so less time dedicated to the interns."
EngineeringStudents,3de4hs,encapsulationdot1q,2,Wed Jul 15 16:12:05 2015 UTC,What happens if people can't find an internship? I don't understand how a school can have that many companies near it that it is able to get every student an internship.
EngineeringStudents,3de4hs,mbr123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:21:05 2015 UTC,"My program is IT engineering (similar to CS). For every IT student, there are about 3 available ""official"" internships. On the other hand, students in ME have a much harder time since it's about a ratio of 2 students for 1 available official internship. What I mean by ""official"" is those internships are in the official school database. If you want/need, you can find your own internship.  You have to complete your 1st internship after 12-46 theorical courses, your 2nd after 38-83, your 3rd after 80-108. There's a 4th optional one. The internships are incremental: the tasks and responsibilities keep increasing.  If you can't find an internship, you aren't allowed anymore to subscribe to theorical courses. This is why some students are ""stuck"" at home for 4 months to a year, but it's rare (less than 5% of students).  My engineering school exists since 41 years. Here's the webpage. They have great relationships with so many enterprises and government (federal & provincial) agencies. Also, compared to the other engineering students from the other universities/schools in the region, we have a very favorable reputation. I think the main reason is that most of the students have a technical background (ex.: I'm an IT technician) and a few years of working experience."

It's an absolutely fantastic choice for engineering. The digitizer alone makes it worth the cost. Get the type cover with it. If you want to save some money, you can still get new-in-the-box Surface Pro 2s that perform about as well but cost a lot less (~$800 on Amazon). Make sure to get a thin and portable 4-port USB hub as well.  You'll probably want to get an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse for working at your desk. The dock is not necessary for this, but it is nice (and puts less wear on your ports).  Seriously, once you get used to doing notes with OneNote and a pen, you will not ever consider going back to a traditional laptop again.   My friend who is also going into engineering just bought a mac and told me I should also get a mac because ""its better for university"".

You could easily get away with something like a Chromebook if you're just screwing around on your laptop in class and can use a lab PC for anything extra. A lot of schools also run Citrix/remote server connections so you can connect with your own PC to run the school software.
EngineeringStudents,3dfxhc,elomenopi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"Hi there, i'm currently a 6th (oh god its really been that long) year engineering student at Michigan Tech. When I bought my first laptop I got a really nice one (like 2k) and i really regretted it. I wish i would have gotten a ~$700-800 Asus for the 98% of my time i spend reading articles, researching, writing papers, etc. If you search the deals on newegg you should be able to get that grade of laptop for close to 500 or 600. That laptop should be able to handle all but the most strenuous programs, which you almost certainly have to use a school computer for anyway because of licensing issues.   I would also strongly recommend NOT using a Mac because of software compatability issues. As an engineering student you will have to use specific software in some situations and it'l save yourself a pile of headaches to just have one computer to use.   If you decide you need a more powerful computer as well get a nicer desktop. You can get a great desktop and decent laptop for the same price as a great laptop. Plus you'll have a easily portable laptop to take to class and a powerful desktop when you need it.   Your needs may vary from mine, but unless you do a lot of high-demand gaming, I doubt it, and looking back that is what I wish I would have done.  Hope this helps"

Chances are they will meet with you guys separately and they might try to have him rat on you, or get you to rat on him.  Go in knowing that so neither of you guys fall for it and crack.  Walk into that meeting not swaying from your insistence that you are innocent and this other guy is simply a study buddy.  Bring in the passage from the book that you mentioned.   Bring in past homework assignments that you guys might have done similarly.  Bring in class notes - chances are the stuff you wrote down probably also matches what the other person wrote down too.  That shows that your programming knowledge is coming from the same source and both of you are learning the material in a similar style.  Remember, they can't prove anything.  There are only sooo many ways to write a program, so if you guys legitimately did your own work, be very clear to them that there are different ""styles"" of programming just like there are different styles of writing, and when two people work together (but not cheat), they tend to develop similar styles.    If you saved different iterations of your program as you were doing it (like program001, program 002, etc), possibly bring that if the files have their creation times.  If you can show that you started working on this program on Saturday the 4th, but the other student didn't start till a week later, that might help show that they were created at different times."

I would make it a point to mention how all your professors have tried to hammer home the point that engineering is a ""team sport"".  At least that was the case at my school, and its definitely true out in the real world.  Engineers will be working on teams, with other engineers or other people.  As such, working on homework assignments with others was encouraged in pretty much every single class I ever took.    The reason I am mentioning this is that you should be laying down the foundation that two students working together is not a ""crime"" and in fact a good thing for your future career.  This kind of puts this review board in a bad position if they try to punish you for doing essentially what their curriculum has been teaching its students."
EngineeringStudents,3dav5v,Szos,11,Wed Jul 15 00:19:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the best idea. Although I agree unconditionally, It says on the homework assignment that collaboration is not permitted."

EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,pete2104,26,Tue Jul 14 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe not necessarily the first job you get, but at least the first 1 to 4 years of your career. Yes, you can get pigeonholed, but only if you allow yourself to be pigeonholed.  I say this based on personal experience.  It's better to figure it out early in your career rather than later on. Look at it from a potential employer's view. Take /u/Goins2754 example in Civil with structural steel design emphasis. Say the person spends 10 years in steel design, has their PE license, and then wants to go into concrete structures. The person would be able to make a switch fairly easily because the concepts and knowledge are transferable. There will be many new things to learn but it's not like they're starting from scratch and an employer may still be willing to pay that person the same, or close to, the $100k to do structural concrete design. But, say the person wants to go from structural steel design to geotechnical engineering and has zero experience in it. That employer won't pay the same $100k rate they were previously getting because they have zero experience and are essentially back at an entry level position.  That person has to learn something new from the ground up (no pun intended). It can be done, but don't expect a new employer to pay at the rate you were previously getting. Moral of my story...figure out what you want to do early on in your career (doesn't have to be the first job). Skills transfer well to jobs of a similar nature.  The longer you go in one field the harder it becomes to switch into something completely different (but not impossible, just harder) later in your career."
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,txhusky17,6,Tue Jul 14 19:25:28 2015 UTC,"I'd like this question to be expanded to civil engineering as well, if you don't mind, /u/pete2104.

EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,Conkeldurrrr,2,Wed Jul 15 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"I think the important part of structural design, whether it's concrete, steel, timber, whatever... is that you can use whatever resources you have to ultimately get to a working section.

Get a job as an operations/sustaining/manufacturing type engineer and you should be able to apply for that type of manufacturing position associated with aero, like at major supplier or something most likely for your next move after the cable company.  If you want to get into design in aero, the path would be the same, but you will most likely hit a barrier because you really need the material the aero part of the degree teaches in order to be a design engineer.   You could ask the company to pay for some aero classes at your local college as a term of a contract when you move to the aero manufacturing job, though, maybe."
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,smilingstalin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate your response.  I think my ultimate goal is to go into management or business/engineering administration, ideally in the AERO industry, so perhaps it would be fine if I stuck to the manufacturing side of things.   At the moment I am an AERO minor though and I do really like the subject matter. Perhaps I'd be lucky enough to have a future employer pay for AERO grad classes."
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,Rfogelsong,2,Wed Jul 15 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, nice, the aero minor will probably give you some design classes that'd make that transition easier.  Everyone's (or most, at least) ultimate goal is management, so you probably won't see much difference between the two based solely on that, it'll probably depend more on the specific job.  I'd recommend against an aero masters unless you're at a major engine or chassis manufacturer and they absolutely require it to get to management simply because it definitely limits you and makes you look focused on one area.  I think you'd be much better off with a MBA and a PE, especially for management, vs. being more of a tech. expert with an aero masters."

EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,RGandhi3k,3,Wed Jul 15 03:13:09 2015 UTC,Make sure you get a structures engineering job.  There are lots of jobs at large companies that require an engineer but are largely non technical. That can be a very hard career path to change.
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,lowdownporto,3,Tue Jul 14 20:30:03 2015 UTC,depends on the job I think. For me I went into electro-acoustics since I had a previous career as a live sound engineer before finishing my engineering degree. I did this because I am more valuable in that role (Meaning I am able to make more than I likely would in other specialties at this point in my career) I will likely specialize in this role because otherwise I would set my career back quite a bit. Also considering the number of recruiters I have contact me apparently there are not a lot of engineers with the electro-acoustics knowledge/skill set that people in my position have and yet there are lots of openings for such people. Even one recruiter said to me that people with this skill set are really hard to find. So for all those reasons I will likely continue down this path since it seems like a good career move. And it is super interesting and rewarding in my opinion.
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,lowdownporto,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:12 2015 UTC,are you doing a bachelor's right now? One way that people will switch industries within their discipline of engineering without setting their career back a lot is they go back and get a masters. This is a good reason to get a Bachelor's then go work for at least a few years before getting a masters because this way you will have a better idea of what you may want to specialize  with the graduate degree.
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,portol,2,Tue Jul 14 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"In my 4 years in a telecomm company, I have switched teams three times. Each team is in a different technical field so I don't really have to worry about being pidgeon holed. I went from LTE to IMS/Core to Linux and Virtualization. So really, if the company is big enough, you can switch career paths easily."

Im currently a stress analyst on satellites but id really want to switch to missiles and or fighter jets  Good thing im in a company that makes all of those products.   So OP the answer to your question is : even when youre in one role, network with other managers. The stress manager for missiles is also in my organization of 'mechanical analysis' so i can easily contact him and ask about jobs and similarities between satellites and missiles. (And i have)"
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,RGandhi3k,4,Tue Jul 14 19:35:00 2015 UTC,That shouldn'tbedifficult.  Stress is always in demand.   It's harder if you try to change specialties.
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,Gyang193,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"Eh not really. I can be a flight test engineer too because we do a lot of testing in this line of work as well.   The main point is, being in the same company is the largest selling point of these mobile jobs"

Lots of individual part analysis, as well as spacecraft total modal tests and analysis. The guy next to me worked at Boeing during stress on 777 so the work is totally applicable, we use cylinders, boxes, and other thin walled structures.  The loads are different and we focus on launch loads, rather than a 50 year airframe cyclical loading life though"
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,Conkeldurrrr,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:20 2015 UTC,It's definitely easy to get pigeonholed into a certain sector if it isn't widely applicable to begin with. If you were to find a job in missile design do you think your skills would be transferable to some other aerospace field?  Employers at any time in your career are interested in what you know and how fast you can hit the road running.
EngineeringStudents,3da0ba,Kommenos,2,Tue Jul 14 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"EE major here. It would, wouldn't it?  I mean, from someone with little understanding of aero it seems like the skills are transferrable. If you're designing the aerodynamic structure of the missile you'll be using the same skills to design aerodynamic bodys of aircraft, would you not? Similiar principle with propulsion?  Or did I get it completely wrong?"

EngineeringStudents,3ddr0l,sxeQ,2,Wed Jul 15 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"I would suggest trying to compile a group made up of value added students.  I have been fortunate to to create a group, for the past year, that consists of  one person that gets the theory,  one that gets the application,  one that takes impeccable class notes and  one that can explain the information in an easy to understand format (me)  This has been a recipe for success.   Other than that, time. Take time to do the problems, then do them again. If there is something you don't understand, and won't, often with repetition, you can circumvent that portion and move on.

I can send what I have to you if you want.   Passing this class isn't too difficult, but it's important to stay on top of things because it moves pretty quickly. The textbook is all right, but it's fairly simple. It's best to substitute with other sources, such as Khan Academy and Paul's notes.  Since the class is pretty much all computational problems, it's best to just do as many as you can until you can do it in your sleep. If you get stuck, the MSLC tutors 2177, or you can ask your TA for help.   Best of luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3ddr0l,penguinhugs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used the MSLC tutors a bit last year, but honestly this class is just so rough for me. I can't stand doing three pages of integration or matrices, I just don't understand it."
EngineeringStudents,3ddr0l,callmeslade,3,Wed Jul 15 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"Well you have to do SOMETHING to be able to understand it to where you can pass the course. Everyone has a rough class here and there. Go to the tutor lab every day if you have to. Sit there until you have all of your questions answered. Get a private tutor if you need to. Get solution manuals to the math book and use it to assist you with learning the method to problem solving. Go to all of the office hours you can make. Sitting and complaining only does so much; at some point you have to say ""I can either sit here and mope and fail the class, or I can use all of my resources and put time into the class and do as best as I can."" Not everything is fun, and sometimes you have to sit there and do a triple integral that takes up a full page or find a solution to an ODE that takes half the page to work out. That's just how it works."
EngineeringStudents,3dc6oo,neburhdz,4,Wed Jul 15 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"it said using riemann sum with n=5. You have to divide that up into 5 rectangles. Each rectangle has width 2 and height given by x2 * g'(x). So the area of the first rectangle is 2 * 22 * 3.3 (we use the value for g(2) instead of g(0) since it's the right hand sum, 2 is on the right side of 0 on the number line). Second rectangle's area is 2* 42 * 5.1... And so on. Once you found the area of all five rectangles just sum them up, that that is your approximation."
EngineeringStudents,3dc6oo,Karilusarr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:13:57 2015 UTC,"I understand that part, for that integral that is on the right (look at part a) for the formula I'm talking about) and got the value of 779.2. But this is incorrect being that I've yet to get the approximation from the left hand part of the same formula ( [(x2)g(x)] - ... is the part I'm referring to)."
EngineeringStudents,3dc6oo,Karilusarr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I think we all read the question wrong. It's asking you to approximate the entire integral by using approximating the second term in your answer to A. So it's (102 * 7.5 - 0) - (riemann sum of 2x * g(x) from 0 to 10)"
EngineeringStudents,3dc6oo,SuckADickDumbShits,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:17:58 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is 2500. after doing the integral its x3/3g(x).  Using 10 for x since that's your upper value and 0 for your lower value.  it ends up being 103/3g(10)-0.  well g(10)=7.5, so, it ends up being 333.3333*7.5, which ends up being 2500."
EngineeringStudents,3dc6oo,thatrocketguy,3,Wed Jul 15 04:02:14 2015 UTC,Probably not the answer they are looking for though. Solving it that way gets an exact answer but they are asking for an approximate answer which will probably net something slightly off.
EngineeringStudents,3dc6oo,UlyssesSKrunk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:31:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it isnt the exact value of the integral on the right hand side. I know because I tried this as an answer and it told me I was wrong."

I know for civil it's required specifically to take a science elective in a field other than chemistry or physics for accreditation.   I got one class switched in my core electives but I had a dean as an advisor.  But I'd recommend bringing the class syllabus and looking at the specific requirements of the elective you want to replace

EngineeringStudents,3dcunm,callmeslade,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have, but it wasn't nearly that much work. I wanted to take a general engineering course about nanotechnology for one of my departmental electives since it seemed to fit into my interest in smart composite materials. My department just required an email from the professor, a copy of the course syllabus, and a short letter explaining why it should be considered a useful course for my degree plan. But then again, my department was pretty relaxed about which courses we could take as departmental electives. I know people who took courses like automotive engineering even though they were aerospace majors.  I'd recommend bringing the course syllabus and maybe a copy of the textbook if it's available to you (either ask the prof or check your library)."

Besides the fact that you probably eat up some of their billable time by asking questions, or the time they spent training you.   Plus, if they're a small firm, they probably don't have a lot of room in their budgets to be paying interns much. If you want money, go for the big, fat companies with big coffers.

Just graduated in mechanical engineering with a girlfriend and a new baby born in march. It's difficult for sure. What worked for us was:   We had rituals together. Cooking, certain tv shows, park walks, etc. The point was to set sort of sporadic but daily times to give one another and our daughter undivided attention. I got used to 5 hours of sleep at least 5 days a week. Sometimes that meant waking up at 3:30 in the morning and starting homework. Others it meant getting home late. But time she slept was time she didn't really miss out on me. Chegg.com subscription for solutions to your homework. A lot of problems are prototypical and designed to teach you how to deal with that type of problem. As such spending 7 hours to figure out a general process you could actually memorize is a bad use of time (in my opinion) when you have a loving partner waiting for you. Your significant other definitely needs to understand that school b is a combersome task for both your futures, you need to understand the material.

I spent this past year, the 6th year as a graduate student, married.    My wife also had a very time consuming major, information systems, so she certainly understood.  Several nights a week, 2-5 depending, we would have homework dates. She would come over after classes, 3-4pm, we would do homework until 6, cook and eat dinner together, around 7pm we would get back to homework until 9-10pm, and then watch a show or a movie or hang out until midnight. I would then take her home, we would both pass out, and start all over again the next day.   We would also hang out or go on normal dates on most Saturdays, but not do any homework.    Both of us have no problems just hanging out in the same room working on various things simultaneously.   Now that we are married, little has changed, the biggest difference is that I no longer need to take her home and that I don't have nearly as much homework as she does.    Really depends a lot on your personalities. Both she and I were very happy with that arrangement, because we got to see one another a lot, hang out a lot, but also get a lot of homework done."

I was a liaison for their funding and had a few friends there so I worked closely with them.  The biggest, and likely most important, thing you will need is space. If you don't have a permanent space (even if it is only for the year and then you need to move to a new location) then it makes it very difficult to get anything done. You need a place to store your equipment, build the car, and bond with your team. Our team has done a variety of things to make sure they have space but the school has not been very good to them recently so it's been difficult. For a short time they were working out of a self-serve storage facility.  As far as more information and resources, the best place to go is to your peers. Obviously you have done that by coming here, but it would be even BETTER if you were to look up some really successful teams and reach out to their leadership. The best thing I ever saw our hybrid team do is go visit UPenn's team in order to ask questions and get a better idea of what a successful team had in place already. You can probably find the teams either on Facebook or on a dedicated website provided by the school.  Good luck bud!"
EngineeringStudents,3d994d,Darkknight512,3,Tue Jul 14 16:31:32 2015 UTC,"I'm graduated now, but I worked to help start a Formula Hybrid Team about 4 years ago  Couple of things to first figure out:   What's the timing for the first competition that you want to go to?  Is it close geographically? Can you visit it before you compete to get a feel?  Start reading the rules religiously.  Can you find an advisor with knowledge about this competition?  Budget - Start developing a budget.  Include things like raw materials, parts, space, tools, lodging and transport to competition, etc (some of this like space may be supplied by your university) Sponsorship - start contacting local businesses in addition to university departments.  A lot of little donations add up.  Focus on Automotive, OEM, Tier 1, 2 etc.  Also go for things in kind in addition to money.  I don't know how it works in the UK, but in the US if I could get a steel company to donate stock, they were able to get the full cost back in tax deductions. Start Recruiting and find your knowledge gaps.  Does anyone know about suspensions? Brakes? If not, can you recruit someone that does and someone that's willing to learn the system as well?

I found that if I had early classes, I was too tired and worn out to study enough in the evenings.

I still got to go out several nights a week and was always on top of things. If that's something you think you can do (you have to be able to get up early without commitments, like it or not), it helped out myself and quite a few of my friends.  I always noticed the ones staying up late often struggled under pressure."

EngineeringStudents,3da66u,unionfind,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:42:05 2015 UTC,"You're smart enough, right? Then you just need to work harder. Commit to getting your assignments done, and most importantly to really understanding the problems. For me, this meant working alone was essential."
EngineeringStudents,3da66u,UmiNotsuki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"I believe I can do the work its just a matter of applying myself. For a lot of the problem sets and online homework I study with a group of friends, are you suggesting that doing these myself would be more beneficial?"
EngineeringStudents,3da66u,UmiNotsuki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. When you're working with friends, two factors work against your ability to really learn the material:  1) the group usually either moves at the pace of the fastest student (who finds the solution quickest, shares it, and then moves on) or the slowest (who needs his/her hand held and may not truly understand the material.) If you're not that person, the group is moving at a pace which is not right for you.  2) You're not forced to work around the more difficult aspects of a problem (often, setting it up properly) by yourself, even though you will be expected to do so on a test. Working with a group means you either solve a problem piecemeal (in which case no one is getting the full experience,) together (in which case no one is doing any work solo,) or by copying from someone else (in which case you're not doing any work at all.) None of these options are good.  When working alone, you get to move at your own pace and you force yourself to solve problems entirely on your own, which means better comprehension. The only real disadvantage is that it takes longer -- but it sounds like you need to be spending a lot more time working anyway.  The only other argument in favor of group work that I've heard is that teaching others is a very effective way to learn yourself. While this is true, it's uncommon that a student who's able to teach others the material really needs to help anyway. Besides -- you're probably not the one teaching everyone else (no offense, just a numbers game.)"

EngineeringStudents,3d8piw,rfinder1,3,Tue Jul 14 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"To expand on /u/renocasino, there are some courses that you really want to master.  Integrals (predominantly Cal2 and Cal3 but you will do A LOT of integration in EE especially Basic Circuits class)  Eigenvalues (or eigenvectors. I did that stuff in Linear Algebra classes. You deal with Matrices almost all the time but I don't recall using it in my EE courses)  Differential Equations (holy shit learn and master this shit. Almost all your EE classes will directly/indirectly use DE. You will take a standalone DE course, for my school the pre-requisite is Cal2 I believe)  Complex Numbers (ah the good ol' i. You will see complex numbers a lot in basic circuits class)  Fourier Analysis/Discrete Signals/Convolution/Nyquist (like DE, learn and master these shits. Those all will fall under your Signals class and to me it was a hard one. A lot of people said it's difficult in a sense that it's conceptual since you don't have anything ""physical"" to work with. Labs are almost just programming on MATLAB)  Bode diagram (you will learn this in advanced circuits class. You draw that while doing filters. A filter that passes high frequency but rejects low frequency and vice versa)"

I live in the south-west and there's not much going on on that front as far as I'm concerned. Some of my friends are Muslims and they live perfectly happy here, so I guess it might depend on the part of the country.   Henkel is a pretty big company, but I'm not sure if they're internationally active. It could also be, that I'm just too oblivious. I think in big companies, where international work is just part of the business, one should be ok with English. Maybe just shoot them an email, asking if being fluent in German is mandatory."

The pay was pretty good because we got a lump sum before we went, so I can't comment on that, but I can say that the experience was worth more than the money. Working in a different country means (most likely) working for an international company. If you want to work for that company after graduation, having experience in one of their offices in another country is going to make you stand out soooo much.  Mine was mainly handled through the company, so they took care of a lot of the paperwork-y stuff. They set us up to get working visas and everything. If you're biggest concern is going into debt, I say do it definitely. The work experience itself is going to be fantastic, but the experience of really living and working in another country is going to be something you'll talk about for the rest of your life!"

The level of difficulty will change based on the school, the professor, and obviously personal aptitudes.  Core ChemE classes generally include thermo, transport (including heat, mass, and fluids), reactor design/kinetics, process control, and some form of senior design project class. I assure you that there's someone out there who would tell you that each one of those is the hardest class. Therefore, you'll get much more applicable answers if you ask your upperclassmen, particularly with respect to the teaching styles of your professors.

I'd always play it safe and not mention it at all as I know people that take political opinions as insults due to someone else's political belief having a negative impact on their family and disagreeing with their values.  EDIT: I believe everyone should be entitled to their own opinions, however when you work for someone else you've sometimes got to be prepared to have someone else's view forced on yours - whether you like it or not. If you don't want that, go work for someone else or work for yourself, you could take legal action if you feel they treat you differently because of it, but that's probably a bad idea as you'd probably end up bankrupting your own employer.."

My first internship was at a small chemical plant whose operators handled all the maintenance. We were having a problem where the rotating head on a pelletizer was chipping blades and these steel blades would move through our system until they were caught right before entering our extruder. I designed a magnet array that would catch them when the plastic pellets entered a cooling bath and then when the recycle line was shut down they could be easily cleaned off. Pretty awesome to see my solution actually work.   But on another rotation I was tasked with designing a sample system for a scrubber in hazardous service. I never was able to get it done. Every step of the way the design was stopped because of cost of materials or industrial hygiene reasons. Working with engineers as well as operations I went through probably 4 or 5 iterations of the design and by the time my rotation ended there was only a rough idea of what we could do.   I ran into one of the engineers who I worked with on the sample system a few months ago and he told me that even now, a year and a half later, they are still working on the sample system design. But not being able to come up with something for that is still the biggest disappointment I've had as an engineer so far."

EngineeringStudents,3d5mvj,HydraulicFractaling,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:41 2015 UTC,One of the big reasons I'm going into structural engineering is so I can see things I've worked on while driving around. I just imagine it's going to be incredibly rewarding to see a large structure that I helped design and build for decades to come. To think that potentially millions of people will see and benefit from something I worked on.

Just remember that you want to present the version of yourself that best aligns with the job you want to someone who may not spend more than 30 seconds looking at it.   In my case, my education is my biggest selling point, so that's at the top. They don't care about high school (besides the fact that I graduated), so that's one line. Most of it is my BS, ms, and academic societies and achievements.   Next is my technical experience. A recruiter actually told me to split up experience into technical and non-technical. In this section is any significant technical effort I worked on for at least 3 months. This includes internships, semester projects, research, and anything else that tells the recruiter that I can walk up to a workstation and get some shit done.   Next is Other Experience. I've done a lot of leadership/management stuff extracurricularly, and I want my career to be more than purely technical, so I include all of that in this section.  Beyond that, I have a small section for relevant coursework, which I mostly use to load up on keywords that an automated filter system would pick up on.   And last, but not least, don't forget your name and contact info.   If you have any questions, just let me know."
EngineeringStudents,3dazmd,poopsquisher,2,Wed Jul 15 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"There's no right or wrong way to write a resume.   After having the opportunity to look at a few hundred of them, I disagree.   If a company says that only video resumes of you reciting your qualifications while wearing a pink tutu are acceptable, get ready to be a ballerina. Easiest way in the whole wide world to screen resumes is to put the equivalent of the Van Halen brown M&M clause in the ad. Does this person pay attention to detail? Are they spamming carbon copies of their resume to everybody? Did they scan for gimmeajob@myrentisdue.com, and send it there without adding the required ""SUBJECT: I CAN HAS JOB PLZ?"" You're right about the 30 seconds part. If it's not on the first page, don't bet on anyone ever reading it. That first page should be really easy to scan- with both the Eyeball Mk 1 and the digital version. Anyone under 30 with a second page had better have a darn good reason. Being a short-term hotshot troubleshooter is a good reason, joining twenty clubs isn't. The guy in his mid 20's with a five page resume is not getting hired. Have a base resume, write for the audience. Management job doesn't care about your Hackerspace BattleBot successes, robotics job probably will. Computer engineer job in the server farm values debate club less than sales engineer job. Federal IT jobs won't touch you without ""Security+"" on there, nobody else cares. This also helps with trimming for length.    I've seen close to 1,000 resumes come in for a job, and fewer than 50 passed the initial screening. Those 950 took about 10 seconds each to review.

EngineeringStudents,3dazjq,MilkyBaron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"Oh are you saying if you apply the 20.4kN or 22kN to the Steel section it will fail, therefor the max force for the entire structure is the max for Steel (12kN)?"
EngineeringStudents,3dazjq,PR0ficiency,2,Tue Jul 14 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"No. If you apply a force greater than 12 kN to the steel section it will fail. That means this material is the limiting strength of the entire structure. If the steel fails at 12 kN, when you reach 20.4 or 22 kN your structure has already failed (even though the bronze and aluminum are OK). As such, the max axial force you can safely apply will have to be the smallest maximum force that can be withstood by the materials. This is also why you have to calculate a different value for each material and then compare them."

As far as what is appropriate, it varies immensely.  Many engineers patent the most ridiculous things that are not especially unique or take any real talent.  On the other hand there are obviously some groundbreaking ones.  So it is generally up to the attorney to do the search and decide if it is worth pursuing."
EngineeringStudents,3d9tj7,claireauriga,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:10:18 2015 UTC,"Patents give you the right to exclusively use your invention for a certain period of time, at the cost that after a certain amount of time, it is released to the public. However, patent law is complicated and there are plenty of ways companies game the system patenting inventions a part at a time and things like that so they can effectively extend patents for much longer than their original lifespan.  You file patents with relevant government organisations. The patent office then reviews it, and if you really have got a novel invention that's patentable, they'll award you the patent. Different countries have different definitions of what an invention is - I believe I've heard that the US has one of the broadest definitions in the world.  Patents are valuable because they give you the right to use an invention that could earn you money. That's why companies sign intellectual property agreements with employees that make sure the company owns the patents that person creates for their job, and why they will often choose to give someone a reward when they file a successful patent."

If you'll be able to reach that GPA after 1 year ( time required to be in liberal arts before you can attempt an internal transfer ) then it might be worth it. Otherwise, if you were accepted anywhere else, why not just go there and graduate a year earlier instead of taking 1 year of liberal arts classes just to go to UT? FYI, I'm in the same boat, rejected from UT for ChemE and accepted for liberal arts.

Divide that average pace by 60m to find out how far 1 pace is equal to. That I would guess is the Pace Factor. The second part needs the standard deviation of the 5 paces.

It  appears that the Relative Precision is related to the standard deviation of the paces from step one and the actual taped distance from step two. divide the distance by the standard deviation should give you relative precision.

That said, which lab's do you consider extremely important? I can honestly look back at my BS and not recall too many labs I couldn't live without. Short of manufacturing, nearly everything else I could have watched a video and arrived at the same core concept. Yes, the labs were more enjoyable and instilled a deeper understanding and experience than a video ever could, but we're not absolutely necessary."

Instead admit you had difficulty in a difficult course, and you learned from it. Also show them you have taken steps to to improve your knowledge in the subject (retaking the course, study it on your personal time, ect.)"
EngineeringStudents,3d4qhg,thatkidwhoruns,2,Mon Jul 13 15:53:37 2015 UTC,"Best advice right here. The only reason get C's in Physics 1 and 2 didn't hold me back is because I got straight A's the next two following semesters. In the end I could've been a better student, I could've taken a concepts class or studied harder, but I still learned a lot and took steps to remedy the deficiencies I had in my study habits, which was shown in the leap in my GPA.  GPA is only a factor really when you're first looking for internships or initially looking for jobs as school draws to a close, it also depends on your major and how competitive your particular field of engineering is, and where you live. If you're a civil engineer, you better get A's like it's candy, if you're chemical or aerospace, then a B average isn't really all that surprising."

Furthermore I stated that GPA isn't necessarily the best indication of how well someone is suited for the job. That factors such as passion and personality matter just as much. Then I talked about how I really liked nuclear and thought I'd be a good fit. She ended up liking me so much that she told me that I made it to the next round on the spot.

I feel like I'm being disingenuous if I talk about my enthusiasm for CAD drafting roads and analyzing flood discharge when I couldn't prove this enthusiasm in directly relevant assessment.  I feel like if an interviewer directly asks me why I'm applying to this position and talking myself up in my resume when my results directly contradict that, I would have a hard time convincing them that my personal qualities and eagerness would overcome my failures, even though I'd be speaking honestly."
EngineeringStudents,3d4qhg,LastSecondEscape,2,Mon Jul 13 16:09:53 2015 UTC,Your courses probably wouldn't be very helpful anyways. In engineering you typically use <20% of what you learned in class.  You can be interested and just not finish well on the exam. Grades don't imply interest.

If you're strong in all 3 areas, awesome, but most aren't.  Most people are strong in 2 areas.  As /u/thatkidwhoruns mentioned, don't deflect blame, honestly explain the cause.  The worst way to start your time with a company is by lying.  E.g. I was going through some family issues that semester, but those have passed and my GPA has been increasing ever since.  If you just did horribly with no outside influence, that's a bit tougher to explain."

EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,Szos,24,Mon Jul 13 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"Also, from an intern's perspective I could see it looking more like there isn't much teamwork. I think being  a degreed engineer is a bit different."

I work at a tier 1 automotive supplier company and almost 80% of my work will need team work.  Although, teamwork in school is different compared to work.   At school, team work is basically you work with a group of students/colleagues to collectively get your output. At work, you will be working in a team but everyone have their own output.   tldr: At school, I can do my team member's work if he/she doesn't. At work I won't be able to do it.    Another thing that I want to put here is Communication. It is very important at work especially at Manufacturing Industry(believe it is the same in all industry). If you want to be successful at work, start developing communication skills and practice if you already haven't. All the best to all fellow Engineers!"
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,E_n_g_i_n_e_e_r,68,Tue Jul 14 00:10:58 2015 UTC,"I've worked for a long time in a couple areas of Electrical Engineering, mostly R&D related but I have had very wide exposure to many areas of engineering. It looks like you pulled some pretty dangerous lessons out of this internship of yours, at least when applied to engineering as a whole. My comments in italics.   Excel skills are very important and will definitely set you apart. For some positions Soft skills are extremely important. Yes, and this is very true of almost any profession Filling paperwork will be a significant part of your job. For some, but definitely not all engineering positions You will spend a ridiculous amount of time dealing with compliance, red tape and all types of bullshit.  For some, but definitely not all engineering positions Having tact and knowing how to make yourself look good to your boss is very important. It is definitely important to have tact, but you will only get so far 'making yourself look good to you boss'. Your work will speak for its self in any worthwhile organization, even if it takes time. More than 70% of all the stuff I learned in the classroom has absolute no relevance to what I am doing(Manufacturing Engineering). Anything you learned in your undergraduate that you are able to directly apply is a bonus. You were supposed to be learning how to learn technical information and skills, and you probably did! You could spend 5 years in a classroom learning about Manufacturing, all the theory I learned helped very little in making me more prepared to understand the ins and outs of Manufacturing. See above GPA is a very poor predictor of how well you will do in an Engineering position since a lot of what is involved in a typical Manufacturing Engineering position has very little to do with what you learn in school. GPA is a pretty poor indicator of practical capabilities, but not completely uncorrelated You better believe you will be doing boring, repetitive, mind numbing tasks. The idea that Engineers ""create"" stuff and work with cool stuff all the time is mostly bullshit. Maybe for some positions; but if that is what you want to do, take a R&D job as opposed to manufacturing. That is where the heart of innovation and development lives, and there are tons of engineers doing that every day The emphasis some Engineering schools place on ""team work"" is mostly bullshit. You will be working on your own projects most of the time with very little supervision. This is the most incorrect statement you made. Most engineering positions will require teamwork, and very little work engineers do is in isolation."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,xavier_505,12,Mon Jul 13 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, the R&D positions are most interesting.  I've been having a blast at mine this summer.   Anything you learned in your undergraduate that you are able to directly apply is a bonus. You were supposed to be learning how to learn technical information and skills, and you probably did!   I wish more engineering students realized this.  A professor mentioned it my freshman year, and I've always remembered it.  It's a way of thinking and analyzing problems, rather than applying every learning goal in the classroom to the job you end up with."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,medquien,3,Mon Jul 13 02:03:48 2015 UTC,This so much! I didn't take materials courses to do chemistry and come up with new materials.

My grades are alright, but how can I be sure I'll be able to actually apply that knowledge once I'm working in the industry? Getting an internship on the side is out of question for at least another semester."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,ArtsyAttack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:03:46 2015 UTC,"Well, until you experience industry, I suppose you simply need to trust other people.  In the interim, consider doing project based learning experiences.  Try to get involved with an engineering design club and get some experience.  Take a small portion of the project, and own it.  Be the lead for the small portion and you'll have something to talk about in interviews as well as a bit of experience in actually doing something.  ME's can learn all the mechanical design theory in the world, but actually spending time in the shop, machining a design they came up with is probably one of the best learning experiences they can have.  Just because a CAD model shows something doesn't mean it's possible...like square corners in a pocket...but SolidWorks will certainly let you do it!"
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,medquien,10,Tue Jul 14 02:46:43 2015 UTC,"Seriously this was cringe worthy. Once a month we see the undergrad intern that's convinced they have everything completely figured out post, with a bonus of thinking their 3 month stint is an accurate microcosm of the entire spectrum of engineering work. No shit he was doing menial tasks, like the vast majority of interns in the history of internships."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,Overunderrated,6,Mon Jul 13 12:23:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm in a similar position to the OP. I'm interning as a product engineer and 95% of it is excel/writing various procedures. My desk is 50 feet from a massive factory putting together some cool equipment, but ultimately what I'm doing is dull. It's definitely not what I want to be doing. Do you have any recommendations on what kinds of intern postings I should be looking for next year?"
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,jefffey,13,Mon Jul 13 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of people give interns the boring tasks they don't want to do themselves. It's really hard to tell how good a particular internship will be, since much of it will depend on the specific people you're working with."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,axz055,3,Mon Jul 13 01:59:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're definitely right. Three months of documentation is definitely brutal though. I do know some other interns at this and other locations that get much more interesting work though. Guess it could've just been my luck and department."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,jefffey,3,Mon Jul 13 02:29:48 2015 UTC,"It's most important that you have an internship at all, the specifics of what you do isn't nearly as important as how well you do them, and how well you can take away tangible experiences to a job interview. If you are doing data entry, do the best damn job at data entry you can, automate things, etc. It's always a benefit if you can intern somewhere you want to eventually work (makes things easier on both ends), but apply for everything and don't be afraid to ask questions like 'what will I be doing as an intern at XXX'!  At the end of the day, you are going to graduate with zero years of professional experience like everyone else. Get an internship that will net you experience you can leverage for a full time job."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,xavier_505,2,Mon Jul 13 01:30:56 2015 UTC,"In my experience smaller companies are better on average.  In the large behemoths you will be at the very bottom of an extremely large hierarchy, so all of the shit busy work will trickle down to you.  You still get busy work at the small places, but hopefully there's not enough of it to fill 40 hours a week.  With that said, it's hard to find an internship that isn't much more than glorified busy work.  A few months is not enough time for you to learn enough to be able to make meaningful contributions.    This is why I recommend co-ops over internships.  You do three semesters at one company and by the third semester (if you're good) you'll be doing work that's at least somewhat comparable to the full time engineers.  By the end of my undergrad co-op I was the sole CAD designer on a multi-million dollar manufacturing project.  I attended the design meetings and even contributed some ideas here and there.  Not the most amazing thing in the world (manufacturing layouts in CAD are pretty easy) but it was better than writing documentation or making binders."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,noelsusman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:09 2015 UTC,"I expected that coming in. Just not to the degree I'm experiencing it. Wouldn,'t a co-op be a waste though when I could just start full time a semester's time sooner? Thanks for the response."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,jefffey,2,Mon Jul 13 20:06:25 2015 UTC,I was never in a rush to graduate myself.  What's another semester in the grand scheme of things?  A co-op gives you higher quality experience than most internships every could which can help you get a better job when you graduate.  On top of that it can help you figure out what you want to do with your life (or in my case what I didn't want to do with my life).
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,noelsusman,3,Mon Jul 13 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, communication is super vital.   Engineering is all about communicating with people to find specifications, restrictions, and all sorts of other details that you need.   Right now I'm doing senior design with about 30 other students in 5-6 teams, our main thing is communication. The different teams have to communicate fully otherwise the final product won't work.   I'm doing my internship and I have to talk to my customers to make sure the systems I'm designing will fit with their whole organization."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,InquisitiveLion,4,Mon Jul 13 01:16:51 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Engineers who cannot communicate end up in one of two places. 1% of them are so fucking good that it really doesn't matter, they are savants and will be responsible for seminal work in their field. The other 99% of them end up in the bottom 20% of their peers, destined to be held back by their inability to express themselves, their ideas, and work with others.  As an engineer, you will not be paid big bucks because of what you can do. Initially it will be all about the value of your contributions, but in the not too distant future you will not have enough hours in the day to continue to add value as an individual contributor, and your value will be expressed in what you can get out of a team. This requires communication."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,xavier_505,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"I see no application where you can exist without communication or in a team. Engineering cannot be done without communication. Communication with coworkers or clients is needed, and I don't see how you could do without it."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,InquisitiveLion,3,Mon Jul 13 02:27:11 2015 UTC,"I am not suggesting the is a place for zero communication, but I have met and worked with a number of very poor communicators over the years, and they generally limp by. I have also had the interesting experience of working with a few (2 come to mind) world renown scientists who were absolutely terrible at communicating, but they had the resources to overcome this (other people who do the interfacing generally)"
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,xavier_505,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the .01% of people, or the people that don't do well... Not the people you really want to be most likely. Though, if you're the .01%, I guess you can manage for a while."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,InquisitiveLion,3,Mon Jul 13 03:43:36 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. If you don't want monotony or dull problems, do R&D. I use stuff from my classes plus things I never knew before to solve problems."

EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,iHateReddit_srsly,3,Mon Jul 13 04:14:17 2015 UTC,"My job when I arrived  a month ago was writing various sensor drivers that will eventually be provided as example code to customers that are using our microcontroller. But as I was using the build environment I noticed a lot of room for improvement, so for the past few weeks I've been reorganizing and restructuring the build environment so that it's easier to use and error-free. This is the same toolchain and set of scripts that will be going to customers, so it needed to be clean and simple, which it wasn't. The goal is to have the customer only need to run one Python script which will compile and flash the program onto the MCU, and then open a GDB window for debugging and a serial console for UART output. I'm essentially in charge of the entire Linux side of the MCU build environment.  Once the build environment is finished I'll be going back to writing sensor drivers. We got one that is a 3-in-1 humidity/pressure/temperature sensor and I'm going to be writing the driver for it and then a program that will make it send its data over Bluetooth to an Android app for logging and viewing. This will be provided to a customer as an example of what can be done with our MCU."

Soft skills are basically interpersonal skills. I.e. how to interact with different people in a workplace, how to deal with difficult people, how to deal with different bosses, etc.  I agree with the OP in that they do end up being extremely important in an engineering job, just like they're extremely important for almost any job, especially any office job."

The Matlab one was more of a math job than engineering though (some really cool algorithm R&D).  My current internship is just me and my boss, an electrical engineering consultant. We're designing a hydro power plant and it's super cool. We're working with two other companies, I get to do some design work, I'm reviewing tons of drawings, and generally learning lots.   But I'm also realizing that I'd be lost without my fundamentals. Circuits and power systems classes are necessary just to be able to read and design schematics, at least for me.  I'll agree that excel is useful and soft skills are important, but most of your experience is just that: personal experience. I wouldn't say that your experiences apply to much of what I've done at all."

And enjoyable to be there, because of the people...awesome people.  The big projects are right up my alley.  BUT, during normal power producing ops, it's boring as hell.

EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,shupack,2,Thu Jul 16 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, another Cyclone!  Same program too!  I'm about 5 weeks from being done with my 3rd internship, with one being entirely manufacturing engineering stuff, one being a weird mix of IT and manufacturing, and one being a desk job.  It seems like you're a bit frustrated with the school side of things, so I'll throw my take on things.   Filling paperwork will be a significant part of your job   Filing paperwork is not a big thing at many internships.  I have never been tasked with anything of the sort, but that will vary a lot by company.  I don't think I've even been handed a piece of paper at my current internship.  Even if you get stuck with a crappy task like that, always think through the best/fastest way of getting it done.  I once had to enter serial numbers and a bunch of other information for ~150 devices we were implementing in a factory.  My coworkers left for lunch, and I was done in 30 minutes.  They were shocked it took so little time and was so accurate, but I used a barcode scanner to grab the serial numbers, and used keyboard shortcuts to enter the rest of the info fast.  This earned me a lot of credit in terms of looking for a better way.   More than 70% of all the stuff I learned in the classroom has absolute no relevance to what I am doing(Manufacturing Engineering)   The point of the program is to give you skills in a number of relevant areas.  It won't all be manufacturing engineering classes, but you can use your focus and topic electives to gain more experience in that area.   You could spend 5 years in a classroom learning about Manufacturing, all the theory I learned helped very little in making me more prepared to understand the ins and outs of Manufacturing   While I haven't taken it, I would highly recommend IE 222.  It sounds like a decent amount of theory, but it's the applicable type with a huge manufacturing focus.   GPA is a very poor predictor of how well you will do in an Engineering position since a lot of what is involved in a typical Manufacturing Engineering position has very little to do with what you learn in school.   While not it's not a fantastic indicator, it is still important, especially for your first full time job.  Often times there's not a lot more for employers to go off of, which is where engineering clubs can really help out.  Since I started college, I've noticed GPA mattering a lot less.  It used to be that most companies had a hard cutoff at a 3.0, and would refuse to hire below that.  Just in the last 3 years I've noticed the number commonly drop to a 2.6 or 2.8 and also become a little more ""soft"".  They do like seeing a 3.0+, but prior experience and (especially engineering) club involvement seem to be more heavily emphasized now.   You better believe you will be doing boring, repetitive, mind numbing tasks. The idea that Engineers ""create"" stuff and work with cool stuff all the time is mostly bullshit.   These are the tasks you need to automate.  :)  Automating the everyday tasks that nobody likes doing means you no longer need to do them, and your coworkers won't once you're gone.  I've done that a few times with some pretty decent office work time savings.  Engineers absolutely do create stuff, but industrial engineering is typically more about the process than designing a product a customer will use.  If you want to ""create"" things other than processes, ME might be better suited for you.  You can also get involved with engineering design clubs like SAE or Solar Car to get some of the skills to get you in more of a CAD or design type position.   The emphasis some Engineering schools place on ""team work"" is mostly bullshit. You will be working on your own projects most of the time with very little supervision.   Varies by company a lot, however teamwork really is important.  Just because you can do something on your own doesn't mean you should.  You can save a lot of time on your projects and learn a lot more form SME's (subject matter experts).  Yes, school is a lot of theory work, but the theory is important and helps you to know that you're going down the right path with things.  Engineering school teaches you a way of thinking through and analyzing problems, which will always be more important than anything you learn in a single class."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,medquien,2,Mon Jul 13 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about school basically not being incorporated at all into the real world, however, your point about engineers not creating, I feel, is off base.  I am a Mechanical Engineer for a sizeable company that deals with security systems and intercoms and my whole job has been based around creating the designs and set ups for whole security systems.  I mainly have been creating the electronic housings and the face plates for the intercom systems.  My entire job has been creating, but that's just my experience."
EngineeringStudents,3d2irv,SuckADickDumbShits,2,Mon Jul 13 05:49:28 2015 UTC,I'm sort of at a loss as to how you can recognize the value of soft skills but not group projects in college. Part of why you do group work is to learn soft skills.

You would be amazed at how much you have to communicate with and lean upon different departments and different people once you get a permanent job.   As far as GPA, yes it's a poor predictor of how good of an engineer you'll be but what else do recruiters have to compare you to others, and how else do they weed through the 100's of resumes they get?

EngineeringStudents,3d5llj,Gyang193,2,Mon Jul 13 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"Usually they'll at least give you some time to consider if they extend you an offer for next year, if they give you enough time that you can fully consider other possibilities (aka attend fall career fair, interview, hear back, so like until mid October) then just sit on the offer until you have a better picture of what companies you could work for next year.  If they're pressuring you heavily, like giving you just a week or two to decide (in the middle of August!) then I'd politely decline. Normally I'd say unless you loved it, but you're going into sophomore year, don't handicap yourself by continually working at the same company. For all you know there might be a company out there with a job you'd love even more, that pays better, in a better location!  Also you can try to ask for more time to decide, but companies sometimes play hardball with their interns for return offers, so don't expect too much more time (i.e. going from 2 weeks to 2 months).  I would say you should definitely make friends with the colleagues you work closely with, and write down their contact info somewhere for later. If a company in the interviewing process asks for a reference, whip out that contact, ask them first if they'd be comfortable giving you a strong recommendation, and if they are, list them as a contact. Do not under any circumstances list a contact as a reference without telling them beforehand of it."

EngineeringStudents,3d4zc2,benjaminave,6,Mon Jul 13 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"MoM was one of my favorite classes. It just makes so much sense and it's fascinating to me to see how the laws of physics really do command our everyday lives. That being said, both my mechanics of materials class and my Solid Mechanics in Material Design (like MoM 2) were incredibly fast paced. There are so many theorems and methods, and you have to stay up to date. My biggest piece of advice is to always think big picture before starting a problem. Things with static deflection and slope- always stop and think at the end. If you have a cantilever beam with a force pushing down, your deflections should always be negative kinda stuff.  Thermo is strange. My university has A+ tutoring- a third party tutoring service with tutors who personally know several of the professors. I went to every single session. My thermo prof never worked examples in class because they'd take up 45 minutes easily. So for you, I'd say go to your profs office hours and work as many examples in the book as possible. Also, steam table are life.  Fluid Mechanics isn't bad. Read your textbook and, again, always thing big picture. Problems in that class are usually pretty cookie cutter in that there aren't too too many variations of problems.   Circuit Analysis is just weird. Personally, I hate everything EE related. It just doesn't make sense to me. I can do the work, use the formulas, all that stuff, but in my heart of hearts, I still think of electricity as magic. The lab is very helpful to connect the theory from class to application, so make sure you really pay attention and don't just mess around.  Good luck! This course load isn't too bad. Thermo is really the only one you need to put extra effort into"
EngineeringStudents,3d4zc2,DSice16,3,Mon Jul 13 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"all of the following is my opinion/experience: Thermo is probably going to be the most difficult of those. It's a whole new way of thinking. It's a lot of table reading that you probably never had to deal with before. MoM is a lot of physics stuff with no motion, it won't be as foreign but it'll be pretty different almost immediately. Fluid mechanics is tough at first but as you get closer to more modern things where it's a lot of estimations it gets easier. I would prepare for thermo in advance personally if I could only choose one. Second would be MoM. I can't give much advice for Circuit analysis but it'll probably be not that difficult and try to learn from lab."
EngineeringStudents,3d4zc2,callmeslade,2,Mon Jul 13 17:21:30 2015 UTC,Review Statics for Mechanics of Materials. MoM builds directly on statics. Get accustomed to method of sections because MoM deals with internal stress and shear.   Remember:  ΣM=0 &  ΣF=0
EngineeringStudents,3d4zc2,mountainoyster,2,Mon Jul 13 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"Linear algebra will save you a ton of time in circuits if you aren't already required to solve your problems that way. IMO, thermo 1 was very easy and largely unentertaining; people aren't lying when they say it's a bunch of looking stuff up in tables."

For a couple programs that I need windows for, I have teamviewer installed on both so I can remote into my windows machine.   As far as hardware, I'd say go small. I have a 13"" macbook air. You will most likely be carrying it around EVERY SINGLE DAY so keep that in mind. Also battery life is probably the most important factor. Just being able to go a whole day or 2 on a single charge, you will find super convenient.

Typically 2 classes per semester.  Your job is good paying (probably a fair bit above average), so I would definitely consider doing both.  It's demanding, and it's best if your company is understanding.  Some weeks are filled with a project and 2 exams, and working 40 hours would make your grades suffer significantly.  Talk with your supervisor to see what they say.  Could you work 40 hours most weeks, but 25 3 weeks of the semester (when it's chaotic)?"

A professor at my college once said it doesn't matter what type of [technical] minor you have, as long as you have one. I too have to keep my GPA above a certain point for a research scholarship, so I understand your pain. Also, picking a minor that is similar or supplements your major is pretty helpful in my opinion, because I am using similar concepts between the classes and it gives me an edge over the other students in the class.

It's just that I don't want to take another Newtonian physics class as a requirement for the minor when I can just take photonics (which has much more physics) in the engineering department. I decided I'd rather just get further ahead in engineering and take the extra classes I want within my own major.  If you do a minor just for the heck of it, do one that is unrelated to your major. You get a more well rounded education and it adds more depth. I recommend anything that involves using more people skills.  Typically in engineering, minors can only be picked up by individuals who started out ahead (maybe through AP credits). Otherwise, it's 17-19 credit hour semesters.

EngineeringStudents,3d2fnc,reddit409,3,Sun Jul 12 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"I had a 17 credit hour semester about a year and a half ago. This included two classes that each had a lab. It was 14 credit of EE and 3 credits of statistics. It was one of the most brutal semester I had ever had, but after I was finished I felt that I could take whatever EE was going to throw at me. You have to stay on stop of everything and it gets hard. Know how to balance your time and what your threshold is.  Taking a large work load can be draining and overly frustrating. Lab report after lab report, 2-3 tests in one week, terrible lab partners. The list goes on.  But perhaps you don't need to take 15 credit hours. Less credit hours means more room to allocate your time and perhaps gain a better understanding of the materials, which I think is far more important than blasting through.  Those loaded semester did prepare me for graduate school though. My first 12 credit hours of EE grad was like 18-21 hours of undergrad...  Hope I answered a few questions for ya."

I am just hoping I don't fall behind because i feel like it will just snowball into a disaster if I don't stay focused. But at the same time I think it will prepare me for harder semesters to come, like you said about feeling ""that you could take whatever EE was going to throw at you.""

I have one friend in civil who is pouring it on and taking an insane load that I could never handle myself. All I can suggest is comparing the classes to what you took in lower division and try to draw a conclusion from there. I'm also starting my third year and find that the lecture courses look like they will vary in how demanding they are. Just trying to go by gut feel on how stressed out it looks like I might get.

If you want to do research and look for it I'm pretty sure you would find it.   Also if you had a GPA over 3.5 you were almost guaranteed an interview for an internship at Northrop Grumman or General Atomics. I got interviewed three times at NG with a GPA of 3.2. I remember one of my professors lined up two AE jobs at Boeing exclusively for students in his class only.   There are exclusive summer internships for UCSD students with some of the local companies. I never participated but my classmates were able to get in.

EngineeringStudents,3d246f,07Mech-E,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"Well the z is in the function for T so wouldn't I have to differentiate T wrt to z? However I get confused here because T also has the variable t. Am I supposed to use PDEs? My maths course taught me how to find solutions to PDEs but not how to apply them.  Also, if I just plugged it into that equation for hot and cold, the xi values are 0 and 1 - putting them into sin(pi*xi) gives 0 and dT would then be 0.  Yeh, the book gives the answer under the question, but no full solution."

EngineeringStudents,3d246f,Remyskii,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"The delta(T)/delta(x) is only suitable for the steady state iirc*. The full integral form is dQ/dt = -k int_closed(del(T) dot dA). In 1D it becomes -kA((dT/dz)_z=L - (dT/dz)_z=0), and that will give you a nonzero term for dQ/dt.  Did you write the thermal conductivity unit correctly? If it were W/mK then it implicitly represents kA/L, where k usually is W*m/K, in which case you don't need to know A or L anymore.  I can't say that I have chugged the numbers in to check.  *Actually it's an finite-element approximation for a sufficiently thin slab."
EngineeringStudents,3d246f,Noonecanfindmenow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:30:53 2015 UTC,"What should I do with the time term in the temperature equation?

I don't understand what to do with the time term as subbing in definite values for time when the LHS has a dt term doesn't seem right. However, the temperature function depends on the time also, in units of hours. I'm lost.  That's the unit that's given in the book. It makes sense as q=kA(dt/dx), lhs units: W, rhs units: k * (m2 * K * m-1), to cancel this to watts, k must be (W/mK).  Thanks"
EngineeringStudents,3d246f,Remyskii,2,Mon Jul 13 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought W/mK was watt per milliKelvin, which made my calculation orders of magnitude off lol.   You don't want to sub in a definite value for time. This is a calculus problem. At any given moment the amount of heat transferred per second is dQ/dt, so to get the total amount of heat in 30 minutes you want to integrate dQ/dt wrt time from 0 to 0.5.  The spatial and temporal dependence in Q only has to be considered separately, if that was confusing you. First you take the gradient(derivative) of T wrt to z to get heat flux dQ/dt, at which point the t-dependence of T simply implies that dQ/dt also depends on t and changes over time. Next, to get total heat over a given amount of time, you integrate dQ/dt wrt to t to get Q. The z-dependence of dQ/dt here implies that Q also depends on z, because the heat flux is different at different depths of the rectangular slab. We only care about the heat transferred in/out of the entire wall, so we evaluate Q at the z boundaries, z = 0 and z = L, and that's why I had two terms in my post above.  This got a bit rambling-y. Let me know if it works out for you. You should get about 7700J at both z=0 and z=L, which when combined will give you your answer."

EngineeringStudents,3d246f,Remyskii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"I might be completely wrong here, but wouldn't it be wrong for you to just integrate dQ/dt wrt from 0 to 0.5?

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,Arjun_,2,Sun Jul 12 14:47:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. From The Japan Times:   Japan’s bifurcated power system is a holdover from the 19th century, when early power ventures were small in scale and highly localized. In Tokyo, entrepreneurs who were already providing electric lighting in a limited area, using direct current, decided to expand their business by importing high-voltage alternating-current generators from Germany. The German equipment, purchased from the company that became AEG, worked on a frequency of 50 Hz. Meanwhile, the local power providers in Osaka brought in 60 Hz generators from the United States, supplied by the predecessor of General Electric Company. Surely no one was thinking about compatibility: Who then could have imagined that electric systems some 500 km apart might ever connect?  But the grids grew, with 60-Hz power generation emanating from Osaka and 50 Hz electricity spreading out from Tokyo, until eventually the entire country was wired. The frequency frontier is delineated by the Fujigawa River in Shizuoka Prefecture and the Itoigawa River in Niigata Prefecture. All electricity east of the rivers is 50 Hz, while that to the west is 60 Hz."

Have things measured as a force instead of a mass cuts out a conversion. And as far a length goes generally we dont work with much stuff smaller than inches or bigger than feet, so it makes more sense to use imperal because the numbers are more manageable. As far as most other units of measurement (Volume, etc) I 100% agree that metric is the way to go. I'm sure it also has alot to do with the fact that we are brought up learning imperial so that is where our frame of reference comes from."

Mind you, we're sacrificing convenience (not using base 12, which is easily divisible) for something along the lines of tradition (base 10 being more intuitive, and thus we used it first). Which is a bit ironic, as people argue that metric is easier to work with because it's base 10—yet base 10 is inherently less conveniant to work with, due to it being less divisible.  What I suppose I'm trying to say is that any number system is pretty arbitrary. We like base 10 because that what we've always been using. And we've always been using it because of the visual aid attached to it (ten fingers). And now, most people dislike a base 12 measuring system because it doesn't conform to the base 10 counting system which we all are accustomed to, despite it having it's own advantages (and disadvantages).

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Sun Jul 12 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"Time is base-12 because of the early civilization that created the detailed measure of time. They are the reason a circle is 360 degrees, and an hour is 60 minutes or a minute is 60 seconds. Those are all multiples of 12. By making it multiples of 60, you get a lot of divisors to split things evenly in multiple ways.  Base 12 counting is also simple if you count finger segments, without using yout thumb in the measure. Each hand has 12 segments for the 4 fingers.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xJfP7-HCc  Units of time are also bothed like they are, for days and such, because the Earth doesn't take an even number of days per revolution around the sun."

It's not useful.  10 is not a useful number to base our counting system on anymore. Sure, it might mean a little bit to a kid who can use it to count on his fingers, but mathematically, it's arbitrary and meaningless.  A base 12 system is actually meaningful and useful to math, and it's why every technician I've ever worked with has always demanded their measurements in English units, not metric. It's not that we haven't learned them. Everyone learns the metric system in school, even Americans. It's the scientific standard.

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,damnableluck,6,Sun Jul 12 08:20:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like it because high numbers are hot, and low numbers are cold. Okay, I know, that's a horribly general statement that applies to every temperature system so far.* My point is, that is considerably more relatable to us. We associate higher numbers with it being hotter outside, except that in Celsius, those ""higher numbers"" aren't very high.  Yes, this may sound extremely petty, but bear with me. If it's a hundred degrees out, my reaction may be ""Okay, I'll stay inside today"", because I'm used to Fahrenheit. I mean: that's a high number—it's in the triple digits—so I know that it's hot outside. and if I say it's zero degrees outside, I may want to stay inside with a blanket. Because you know, that a low number—in the single digits.  Now let's look at Celsius. If it's a hundred degrees outside...I don't care. Because I'll be dead. Zero degrees outside? Well, that's a pretty similar situation as Fahrenheit. I know, this is being taken to an extreme, but what I'm saying is between freezing and boiling, Celsius has 100 degrees—except you'll probably only ever experiance fifty of them. In Fahrenheit, there's 180 degrees, and you could experiance almost a hundred of them. It's more intuitive. Oh, yes, and you don't have to go into decimals to tell what temperature it is outside. I don't know if that's common, but I know I've seen it with Celsius, and it really bothered me.  Mind you, this may sound like some fanatic talking out of his ass trying to defend what he grew up with. And that's exactly right—because it's what I grew up with. If I learned Celsius first, I'd probably be on the other side of this discussion.  *interestingly enough, Celsius was initially inverted. 0 was boiling point, and 100 was freezing. Though I don't remember why the inventor changed it. I believe it may have been suggested by a friend of his to invert it to the scale we know now."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,Kallest,8,Sun Jul 12 09:16:39 2015 UTC,"You're right, Celsius is easier for people who have grown up with that system. I don't get confused in my day to day life because I can't grasp the difference between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius any more than you probably have trouble understanding the height difference between 5 and 6 feet, or roughly 150 and 180 centimeters.  Decimals are used pretty much only in science, one degree Celsius is accurate enough for the weather, food, etc.  Personally, I like playing around with Celsius because of the easy conversion to Kelvin. I don't see how the Imperial system has any advantage, besides familiarity for US citizens (and the 1-4 other countries that use it exclusively)."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,damnableluck,2,Sun Jul 12 09:37:00 2015 UTC,"I don't see how the Imperial system has any advantage, besides familiarity for US citizens.   As an American engineer who's equally comfortable in SI as in Imperial, I find I use the imperial system for any project that's design oriented, and SI for engineering problems.  I find Imperial preferable for design problems because it's base 12 (can be divided by 3, and 4 both of which I use much more frequently than 5), and because the units are similar to everyday objects.  A foot, is about the size of an adult foot.  A cup is about the size of a mug.  Pounds-force is much more immediately meaningful than Newtons (which are an unintuitive 9.806 kgf).  Pounds per square foot are again a lot easier to translate into something ""real-world"" than Pascals (which are so small that for most design problems we have to deal with kPa or mPa to keep the numbers reasonable).  For engineering, I find SI to be more useful, generally.  The simplicity of dimensional analysis, is it's main advantage, as far as I'm concerned.  Overall, I think if I had to pick only one system, I'd go with SI, but I think it has fundamental problems too, and it's hardly a perfect.  Ultimately, when you see these conversations, most of the objections or opinions boil down to ""it's easier to do it the way I've always done it,"" which is true, too."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,metricadvocate,2,Sun Jul 12 17:14:50 2015 UTC,The fact that some numbers are really small (like diameter of particles in metres) or large (like pressures in Pa) is not really a fundamental flaw with SI. Just slap a prefix on there and you're good to go. Plus it is a really easy unit conversion in your equations when you use the base 10 prefixes: just add x10x and then the appropriate base unit.
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,zephyrus299,2,Sun Jul 12 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that that it is a point of personal preference.  Unit size is definitely subjective and has to do with what you're working on.  mm's are an obnoxiously small unit if you're a civil engineer, and an obnoxiously large one if you're a chemist.  My point was that for in general, imperial units are more easily understood, visualized, or felt.  This is particularly true for compound units like those for force of pressure."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,threesidedfries,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"While I do get the point, particularly about Pascals which has always struck me as a weird scale, most of the visualisation issues are solved by growing up with the system as you refer to everyday objects in centimeters, kilograms, deciliters, degrees centigrade, etc, and can then apply approximations like ""about four cartons of milk"" when you need to visualise a new problem."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,DaveYarnell,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:31:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  As usual, whichever you're most comfortable with will be the best for you.  I personally, think the metric system has a lot of things that are far better than the imperial system.  I love that the imperial system is in base 12, but it's not consistently so.  Once you get to feet, its back to base 10, and weights are in base 16.  Switching bases makes very little sense, over all.    I just think Imperial's not nearly as bad as people like to make it out to be."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,Dave37,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"Pounds-force is much more immediately meaningful than Newtons (which are an unintuitive 9.806 kgf).   Perhaps not equally comfortable, as 1 kgf (a deprecated unit) = 9.806 N, not vice versa.  And I suspect you mean megapascals (MPa) not millipascals (mPa).  Is that cup British or American? The British gallon is about 1.2x the American gallon as are all the subunits.  The US does not use Imperial, but US Customary, different gallon, bushel, ton, and subdivisions.  Technically only the foot and pound are reconciled, since 1959; before that, even they were minutely different.  Imperial/Customary is an abomination, the two countries that use ""english"" units can't agree on them.  We may spell meter and liter differently, but at least they are the same size as everybody else's.  Imperial isn't really base 12, sure there are 12 inches in a foot, but we divide the inch into 16ths or smaller binary fractions.  Try dividing an inch by 3. A pound has 16 ounces, try dividing a pound by 3.  When you get to structural analysis with pounds-force and pounds-mass, you find f ≠ ma, and you have to make up silly units like slugs or poundals to fix it."

Nobody needs to really know the temperature that water boils at. Very, very few people really use that on even a weekly basis, except bakers, some few French chefs, scientists and some engineers.  Similarly, we know 70 is warm because fahrenheit goes from very cold at 0 to very hot at 100 and 70 is similar to 70%. It is almost like a perfect timeline from 0-100 where anything above 100 or below 0 is ""off the charts"", and everything in between is intuitively arranged."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,DaveYarnell,5,Sun Jul 12 09:42:14 2015 UTC,"0 is a very cold, life threatening day.    Ahaha what are you talking about? 0 F is far away from life threatening. It's cold and sometimes uncomfortably cold, but life threatening? No way. It's not until you start to creep close to -30/-40 that things becomes life threatening.  Celsius is superior in everyday use because for example 0 C is when water freezes, which tells you a ton (that's a metric ton for you) about slipperiness outside. Secondly, no-one feels the difference between x F and (x+1) F, it's unnecessary precise for everyday use. But all in all, Kelvin rocks. :)"

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,LivePresently,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"Fahrenheit based his scale around the human body. He put what he had measured to be the temperature of the human body at 100 (This was a long time ago and his equipment wasn't as good as it is today) and put the coldest temperature he could produce in his lab using brine at 0.

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,metricadvocate,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"What is the reason for the 0-100 scale from Celsius?  For whatever reason, people like 1-100 scales. That said, I would say Fahrenheit is a lot less arbitrary than Celsius because the freezing and boiling point of water at 1 atm of pressure are pretty much the same wherever you go, whereas the other two are based upon one dude's measurement capabilities. I am very pro-SI and if I could do it over the USA would be using it right now. However, the Imperial system has its benefits and I was just giving one.  The main advantage of Fahrenheit in weather applications is that 1 degree F is a lot smaller than 1 degree C and so you can say you want your car at 69 degrees F because it's a little more comfortable than 70 degrees, whereas you can't really do this with Celsius because you would end up with a messy fraction or decimal."
EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,Arjun_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:36:08 2015 UTC,"69F is 20.5°C, 70F is 21°C, both are options in every AC. It's not really that hard to use fractions.  And regarding your weather argument: at 0°C water freezes. When the weather forecast says it will be -1°C, what do you expect? Correct, icy roads, maybe snow.   I'm sorry, for someone who never used Fahrenheit or the imperial system, there is absolutely no advantage visible. Maybe I'm close minded, but I don't think that anyone who doesn't use F out of ""tradition"" would prefer F over C."

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,Bronium2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"""Learned it in school but don't have a feel for it"" is probably true for a majority of Americans in non-technical careers.  Of course, if they used it for a few weeks, every day, they'd have a feel for it.  Also, our schools teach it more as conversions than how to use it for actual measurement until you get to high school chemistry and physics, mostly for people on a college track, if not a technical career.  I think most Americans think of it ONLY as math conversions, not a native unit of measure.  Meanwhile a few industries and most multi-nationals have quietly gone metric internally.  Some Americans find they need to remember their metric if they want a job.  Companies don't talk about much, they exist to sell product and make a profit, not be champions for metrication of the US."

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:28 2015 UTC,"He's probably talking about stuff like subdivisions of the inch unit. If you're looking at your typical tape measure it has markings for 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 of an inch. So stuff like 5 and 3/8 inches is a measurement in the US (especially in carpentry).

EngineeringStudents,3cyndo,CountingChips,8,Sun Jul 12 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you hate fractions, but it makes visualizing irrational numbers much easier. Would you rather shorten a number to a few decimal places or understand the entire thing? Its simply division. One sixth of something (1/6) is .16666666666666666(repeating). Why shorten it to .167?   Yes, metric is base 10. Yes, metric may be simpler. But you're asking a country of 325 million people to all just magically convert to a system that they don't all need to use on any kind of basis. The majority of them will never go out of the US and never need to know metric. You know what it's like for us in school here as engineers? We have to learn both systems, we have to use them both too. What's the big deal?   I also want to point out, because the majority of the population of the United States doesn't encounter metric regularly, grasping the concept of how large a centimeter can be a daunting task--to you that probably sounds dumb. But if you never EVER worked with imperial units and then one day you came to the US and was like ""oh fuck, I don't know how far a mile is, what's the distance from new York to Philadelphia, there aren't any kilometer signs around, I have no clue how long it's going to take me. Blah blah blah"". Or, compare it to learning another language, until you learn it, hearing the term centimeter means nothing to someone who speaks inches. It's perspective.  Also, all units of measure are completely arbitrary and completely made up. The foot, the mile, meters, Celsius, Fahrenheit, all of it was made up.   So, now I'm going to be a rude American.

EngineeringStudents,3cz9qu,Thatbigturd,9,Sun Jul 12 03:25:12 2015 UTC,Loose-leave engineering paper in a 3 ring binder.  Originally I had separate binders for each course. Eventually I ended up just getting a single mega-binder per semester as courses started overlapping and I wanted to have all of my notes on me while on campus.  Anything hard bound seems strangely overkill and limiting if it's not a lab notebook that actually needs to be bound and numbered.

It's got 100 sheets of paper or 200 pages including front and back. I like them because the front and back covers are pretty sturdy and don't get all messed up like cheap notebooks. The wire is also a bit thicker than your standard cheap notebook. I think a bound notebook like you linked would be pretty nice though. My notes are typically somewhat sloppy, it really depends on how the professor organizes their notes on the board, because I usually just copy their format in my notes.   Now that I think about it more, I think i'm going to try this notebook next semester. It's not grid ruled like you want, but it's a hardcover, so the spirals wont get stuck together in my backpack. I also like this one because it has a hardcover, but also has perforated pages. Still has the wire that I don't like though."

They also make notebooks in A5 if that's more your size. The paper is the smoothest around, won't bleed or tear, and will last a lifetime. You'll have your notes forever. I use them with my fountain pens and they are fantastic. They work great with ballpoint pens and pencils too though. Also, check out Apica notebooks.

I know someone graduating this year who accepted a full-time position at the Wyss Institute. They had no internship experience aside from working in the labs on campus for ~2 years. They found this institute looking for work similar to what they had done, albeit in a more research-based scenario, and demonstrated their skills gained in that lab work during the interview.   In addition, work hard at networking. Seriously. It's a huge benefit. I've gone to events all over the place in Boston and ended up connecting with tons of Senior R&D engineers and people in the robotics/medical device industry on LinkedIn because of it. If you're in a big city, I guarantee there are cool meetups for you to network. In Boston, I'm a big fan of the Bolt VC firm that funds hardware startups. They have tons of awesome people and companies to meet there. Look for something similar to that, because studies show that referrals are twice as likely to get interviews and 40% more likely to get hired (article semi-old to be fair but still relevant)."

I was so alone...jk its the internet   That aside, a lack of internship experience can and probably will hurt you (not as much if your GPA is pretty stellar), but the best I can say (I'm only a rising third year) is to have it there and emphasize the strength(s) of being lab support.   I dunno how the EE labs at SC work, but if they're like any (read: every) other, they'd want to have someone under them for 2 years. However, it shouldn't stop you from trying to latch on with a professor, whether its research or lab tech work or something.  Also, you're most likely going to be doing a senior project (or you already did it, idk). That can be used as well for experience or, as I like to call it, filed under 'look at the shit I did, hire me'.  Overall, if you maximize this, you may have a better shot at landing a job after graduation. Also, taking an internship after graduation isn't the worst idea if you can afford it."

I wouldn't call my GPA particularly stellar (it's 3.2, honors for EE is 3.3 if that puts it into perspective), but I still have a whole year to improve. I've been thinking about asking one of the EE or CE faculty if I can work under them for part of the year; I agree that it'd definitely help.   I've also thought about interning after graduation, but I haven't looked into it as much - I was under the impression that most internships (at least, the ones I've looked into) require you to be enrolled at an undergraduate level.

An $80k salary in Warren, MI is the equivalent of $150k in Seattle. http://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/warren-mi/seattle-wa/80000  There are plenty of opportunities to get away from a desk in engineering. I did an internship at an architecture/engineering firm, and it was pretty common for engineers to go out to construction sites to check on progress and make sure the contractors aren't doing anything stupid. Now I work in R&D for a large manufacturing company. For larger projects that require making dozens of samples or that have to meet a certain standard, we have technologists to do the labor. But for smaller projects, we do most of the lab work ourselves. The first 2 days of the job were learning corporate policies, benefits, and getting my desk set up. On day 3, I got fitted for welding gear.   And if you don't want to be in the big corporate world, there are plenty of startups and small companies outside the software industry. At those, you'll likely get even more opportunity to get away from your desk."

This would also need to be boosted.  If you use 6V as your switch voltage, you can use a comparator with two transistors. Feed the + terminal of the comparator with Vin, and provide the - terminal with a 6V reference. The output then drives an NMOS transistor for the EH module and a PMOS transistor for the boost converter.  Not sure if this is the best answer but it should work. Circuits with variable rails (supply voltage) can be tricky to implement as the changing supply adds a level of difficulty."

Not every company out there is going to want to hire an optical engineer, and every company who has an optical engineer is likely going to have 2 or 3 times as many electrical, mechanical, and software engineers (for each discipline) at least.

Depending on the book, there was either a lot written or none at all. For example, in my machine class we used  shigleys book so the equations were spot on. But, in our thermo, fluid dynamics, and heat and mass transfer class our professor gave us equations that he deemed ""more reasonable to use in industry."" They were equations gathered from various other texts so we were encouraged to use those instead of the book equations."

Taking the Moment at C = 0, I would only have one equation and one unknown, which is P, now in the book, why are th 300lb downward force to the left of C and the 200lb upward force to the right of C not in the equation? The solution written on the book is ""8Pv + 200(12) - 400(16)=0""   Shouldn't that be -200(12) + 400(16) -300(8) _200(8) - Pv(8) = 0???   Edit: Ah, Av, and Dv must have been resultant forces, I tried -300(8) - 200(8) - 8Psin(56.31) and I got 600.92, and it is correct. Now my new problem is that when I try to find the moment in B, so that there would be one equation and one unknown, I use 300(8) - 8Fsin(36.87) = 0, I get F = 500 which is wrong.

EngineeringStudents,3cwpgy,Uber-Mensch,3,Sat Jul 11 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"This is using the method of sections, no? Making 'cuts' to the relevant members. Py seems to be the force described, just put in algebraically to show the ratio relationship."
EngineeringStudents,3cwpgy,Anttank123,3,Sat Jul 11 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"If the body is at equilibrium, all parts are in equilibrium. This looks like method of sections for a truss, but they made a cut right at the joints instead of in the middle, as I've seen. It would have made more sense if they made the cut just below the two points but I think they wanted the numbers to be nice.   Because the truss must be in equilibrium, the cut section must also be in equilibrium. Your cut includes reactions at the cut and the reaction at the support. Which means you can ignore the other components that are not in the drawing. If you notice, the forces at C are also not included for the same reason.  Also, when taking moments about B, you should consider the reactions at A --> 200lb in the x direction and 400lb in the Y direction. Let me know how that turns out and if you have any other questions."

EngineeringStudents,3cwpgy,eriverside,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"This is a truss problem; moment equations cannot be used. This stems from the physical construction of the truss, which allows all members to rotate at all joints. This means that moment is not transfered and does not exist.  For analysis, moment does not exist at any joint. Use only summation of horizontal and vertical forces for this problem. Start with balancing all of the applied forces and then trace them through the truss when they become axial forces to find P and F."

It is equal to the magnitude of the force exerted by one kilogram of mass in a 9.80665 m/s2 gravitational field (standard gravity, a conventional value approximating the average magnitude of gravity on Earth).  Therefore one kilogram-force is by definition equal to 9.80665 N.   Similarly, a gram-force is 9.80665 mN, and a milligram-force is 9.80665 µN.

EngineeringStudents,3cycqx,AKxLegacy7,4,Sat Jul 11 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"1) Do larger firms even consider hiring interns that are from out of state?   Yes, I work for a pretty well known infrastructure firm. We have ~6 interns this summer. 2 are in-state, and 4 are from schools in neighboring states (I, however, live 13 hours driving distance from my office, so I am waaaaay out of state). HOWEVER, 5 of us were from schools that my company specifically recruits from! 1 applied online. Around 100-200 people applied for 2 internship spots in the structural engineering department.   2) If so, is it likely that some companies pay for housing, or help with housing?    Maaaaybe. My company just started offering a small stipend last year. HOWEVER, your hourly wage should be more than enough to pay for everything. I lived off of $15.75/hr my first internship in Chicago, and still saved ~30-50% of my income. Check out /r/personalfinance if you need help with personal finance.    3) Since I'm an out of state student, when are the best times to start applying for those internships?   Early and often? Check online job postings, check the company's website for job openings, check with your school website, check with your professors, and never give up. Some structural interns got their offers by early August, and my company was still looking for a transportation intern in May!   Companies will tend to fight over the best of the best applicants in the fall, then fine tune their labor projections in the early spring and open more spots."

They have apartments set aside for co-ops with full utilities and furniture for $350/month (taken out of weekly paycheck).  I have a roommate, but we each have separate bedrooms and bathrooms.  3) I applied for mine back in September 2014, and was officially accepted at the end of November 2014.  I applied as soon as the application went up online (I used Aftercollege) because the company was extremely relevant to what I wanted to do after graduation.

So I decided i'm going to graduate school because I want to go into structural engineering specifically. He said that with a graduate degree in structural engineering that i'm pretty much guaranteed a job in structural engineering. I've also heard from someone at my internship that currently a civil engineering degree pretty much guarantees a job anyway, but I want to be in structural.

EngineeringStudents,3cxh2x,paulkon,3,Sat Jul 11 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on applying for a non-thesis MS in CompE program within the next year. My undergrad is in math and have spent the last 1.5 years working on the core of an EE BS from the university that has the MS program.  I've asked this question explicitly of a few people in that graduate department and received pretty encouraging responses. One professor who I had for a computer systems course mentioned that the were specifically looking for new students from outside an engineering background. That probably refers more to other sciences where computing as a tool is increasing being used, like medicine, but it at least implies that they are open in their considerations.  From what I've heard, it seems that politics plays a big role. I've worked hard in the past two years to foster relationships through staying in touch and facilitating undergrad courses for their distance ed department and hope it pays off.  Additionally it is sometimes possible to begin taking courses within the program without admittance. Nothing shows that you can succeed like actually succeeding both in prerequisites and the beginning courses. The program I'm looking at allows up to 12 credits to be taken as a non-degree seeking student, which is more than 1/3 of the total program.  I would also look at the recommended course loads for different concentrations to figure out where you need to fill in the gaps. The prereqs for an embedded focus are going to be a lot different from an VLSI path.  There is always the chance that this doesn't work out for me, but at the very least, I'm about another 1.5 years out on a CE BS."

If that doesn't have enough information you can call/e-mail the admissions officer(s)/course director and ask them. They will have a greater capacity to help and provide guidance/advice than most people here. You might not get an answer until, at the very earliest, Monday but I'm sure you can wait eh?

EngineeringStudents,3cxh2x,TheBeard86,3,Sat Jul 11 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yup. Plenty of people do it. I have a BSEE and finishing my MSCpEg. There's tons of people that went into computer engineering with a BS in computer science. The ones that had a relatively easy time were the ones that did software engineering.   The ones that struggled were the ones that didn't do much hardware design in undergrad and tried to do hardware in grad school. There tons of software in hardware design but pairing the hardware and software is difficult for people with no background.   So depending on what you want to do, if could be easy or it could be a bit of a struggle.

EngineeringStudents,3czvvv,Velovix,5,Sun Jul 12 08:04:40 2015 UTC,It's kind of like learning how to add and subtract before being allowed to use a calculator. You have to learn HOW these answers are derived before you can effectively use them in analysis programs. That's how I look at it anyway.
EngineeringStudents,3czvvv,cmedrive,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"I get that, but the way we do these are through tricks like substitution and integration by parts and all that.

EngineeringStudents,3czvvv,Propagating_Crack,3,Sun Jul 12 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"Fundamentals are needed to massage creativity out of the mind. Fundamentals are also needed to give confidence when hurdles unpredictable by current education will be encountered in the future. Calc II is a fundamental, you will get through it.  For example, suppose 10 years from now you were given the task by your software engineering company to modify an airfoil simulation written 20 years ago and in your code writing/material research you encounter this:  http://imgur.com/DkxwQTz  And you need to dissect the code and manipulate it, or dissect the math in order to fix it or update it. You will need fundamentals or at least the confidence that you have done harder stuff in the past and you can learn this.  This is an example that I am giving based on a similar thought I used to have, ""why do I need to know all this math can't I start with the engineering already"", then once i started with the engineering based courses, "" holy cow this applied math I am doing is more advanced than I previously thought I would encounter."""

Decent hardware for laptops, and they are usually cheaper than the other brands. If I were you though I would avoid buying directly from Lenovo; actually, I'd avoid the company as a whole altogether. They make decent laptops but their support is terrible. Also took them about 2 months to ship my laptop after I bought directly from them.

EngineeringStudents,3cvtlq,inzanehanson,9,Sat Jul 11 04:58:39 2015 UTC,"Speaking multiple languages is a VERY marketable skill. Getting a degree isn't so much, but just learning to speak fluently will help immensely. I use Rosetta Stone personally that way my GPA is not effected in any way and I still get the same end result."
EngineeringStudents,3cvtlq,aeipownzu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:15:27 2015 UTC,"Speaking another language is definitely a plus, but it takes an incredible amount of time and effort to even get to a conversational level. Rosetta stone especially is not that great and will not get you anywhere near fluency. Check out r/languagelearning for advice and resources."
EngineeringStudents,3cvtlq,fullhalfie,0,Sun Jul 12 05:36:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Do a summer abroad or some kind of immersion program. If you can reasonably say you are fluent, that is enough. A minor really isn't necessary."
EngineeringStudents,3cvtlq,THedman07,2,Sat Jul 11 07:38:23 2015 UTC,"Spanish is a good one.  Opens up almost an entire continent to you.  International experience is now becoming a big enough deal that my school's college of engineering is requiring some kind of overseas experience (work, study, or volunteer) to get an engineering degree."
EngineeringStudents,3cvtlq,KurtWagnerX,2,Sat Jul 11 09:14:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the crowd and say no. Language classes are difficult in a different way from engineering. The upper level ones typically require a big time commitment to get all the reading and projects done.   This may not apply to your school, but mine has a big engineering program but a small language program. Because of this, some languages required for minors are only offered every other Fall or something else that ridiculous. I'm not saying it'll happen for sure, but you may have to delay graduation because it won't be possible to take some of the classes you need, especially if those classes interfere with classes for your major. This can happen even if it seems like it's possible to fit however many credit hours in a semester.   Also, different people will give you different answers on how useful foreign language is in finding a job. Yeah, it'll look good and every little bit helps, but there are usually better ways to spend your time. For example, relevant clubs or a more technical minor.   Study abroad would be nice. Some programs don't require language training, and some have requirements a lot smaller than that of a minor. It's possible without taking all the extra classes.   This probably comes off as really negative, but I'm not saying that you absolutely shouldn't do it. This is just some stuff I've seen from friends and my own research. I just wanted to give you the other side of this as you makes your decision. Good luck with school."
EngineeringStudents,3cvtlq,rogerrrr,3,Sat Jul 11 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"If you have enough space in your schedule or can make space for a foreign language minor, I'd say go for it. I spent two of my undergrad summers taking courses on campus and studied abroad during my third summer. Those two summers of classes combined with the 12 hours or so of class credit I had coming in were plenty to start and finish a minor in Japanese language by senior year.   Spanish is a more widely spoken language obviously, so your minor may do you more good than mine has. However, in my experience with Japanese language, it helps to supplement your minor with a certification of some sort and as others are mentioning, it's really not necessary to even obtain a minor in the language if you study it on your own - just make sure you have the drive to do it without the external motivation!"
EngineeringStudents,3cvtlq,MisterMelancholy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"YES, DO IT  I'm currently minoring in Japanese (which I think maybe was a bit too ambitious) but it definitely made a difference in me getting an internship, because the companies I applied to were mainly Japan-based with American locations.  Even if you can't speak it well, showing that you're interested in the language, and probably the culture, shows alot about how you interact with the world."
EngineeringStudents,3cxbrl,recyclable1438,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"I would change to engineering. If you end up hating engineering, you can always change back and finish up your Bio degree. An engineering degree opens up way more doors than a Bio degree. You are more likely to end up in a dead end job if you were to stick with Bio.   When you graduate, your job is your life.   I know this because I graduated with a Bio degree, and I work as a lab tech. I dream everyday of going back to school for engineering."

EngineeringStudents,3cy0jg,sanjana4242,4,Sat Jul 11 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"C3 and C4 are in series. The resulting capacitance is in parallel with C5 and C2.   The resulting capacitance from this is in series with the remaining two capacitors, which are parallel to each other.  Capacitors in parallel you just add them together.  When in series they follow the 1/(1/c1) +(1/c2)+...) formula."
EngineeringStudents,3cy0jg,Marenjii,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:01:04 2015 UTC,If are only combining 2 parallel resistors / 2 series capacitors at a time you can also use (c1*c2)/(c1+c2)
EngineeringStudents,3cy0jg,dammit_i_forget,2,Sat Jul 11 22:27:37 2015 UTC,Yeah product over sum is so much easier. Just wanted to make sure they knew how to calculate it outside of only 2 capacitors.
EngineeringStudents,3cy0jg,Marenjii,2,Sat Jul 11 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"What the person above said, a little trick I use to remember how to add series/parallel is that an inductor schematic sort of looks like a resistor, so they follow the same method.  Capacitors don't look similar at all, so they're the opposite method.  Also, until you get used to it, redraw the circuit every one or two combinations and it will get a lot more clear what is in series/parallel."
EngineeringStudents,3cy0jg,immelbatoast,2,Sat Jul 11 21:16:11 2015 UTC,"A quick way of determining whether circuit components are in series or parallel is to see whether or not they are located on different paths relative to a junction (a point in the circuit where at least three circuit paths meet). In your example, C3 and C4 are on the same path, so they are in series. Comparing them with C2 and C5 shows that they are separated by a junction from each of C2 and C5, so the equivalent capacitance of C3 and C4 is in parallel with C2 and C5."
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,Wubbls,9,Sat Jul 11 06:08:00 2015 UTC,"I would go for Computer or Electrical engineering. That way if the aerospace industry isn't what you thought it would be or there is a downturn, you'll have lots and lots of fallback."
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,THedman07,3,Sat Jul 11 07:36:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. All aerospace companies are heavy in computer and electrical engineers, but they're also in high demand in the tech sector, so it's a safe choice. I thought that I wanted to do aerospace, but after I interned at a major aerospace contractor I realized that it wasn't for me. But because I am majoring in electrical engineering I am able to pivot into a wide array of industries."

Turns out Mechanical really caught my attention.  I really thought I was going Chemical but I saw things the Mechanical Engineers were doing and I was hooked. So overall ask older engineering students (hopefully some here can tell you what their experiences are) what they are up to and see if you are interested in any of that, that way you get a good idea of what you want."
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,SannyK02,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:42:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah mechanical looks appealing aswell and from what I read, is usually a better choice over aeropsace due to the industry desiring both almost equally and mech being a much broader job range. Tough decision but hopefully whatever college I go to can show me what I would enjoy in my first year."
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,SannyK02,3,Sat Jul 11 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"You can get into Aerospace from a range of Engineering degrees, I had a professor who had majors in civil and structural engineering and ended up in Aerospace before he took on professing. He constantly reminded us that just because you have a major in one form of Engineering does not mean you have to be stuck there throughout your career. But definitely ask older students and even professors of their experiences and you really shouldn't have a hard time choosing. :)"
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,TK05,3,Sat Jul 11 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"Although I may be biased, I'd say go computer engineer.  I currently study CE and just got an internship that deals mainly with EE stuff.  Both CE and EE can work with electronics, although CE have the capacity to deal with software as well while EE focus more on power and energy.  Everyone eventually learns to code and a lot of the fields tend to blend together.  If you like computers and software, then I would suggest CE.  If you want to build some fancy circuits, go EE.  I don't know much about AE to be able to tell you about it.  As for computer science, they tend to be software only, but I have heard from my peers and other professors that CS and CE sort of merge together in graduate school.  From what I understand, they don't ever get to learn much about circuitry, except for what's provided in physics (which is minimal).   It's really all about what you would enjoy doing.  Don't worry too much about your focus in your first few years, and make sure you find a university that offers everything that you're considering."
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,aeipownzu,2,Sat Jul 11 13:52:51 2015 UTC,"My uncle is an electrical engineer for Boeing but has an aerospace Engineering degree. That would be the best of both worlds for you! Planes, jets, and spacecraft need enormous amounts of electrical work, you might want to look into that. Get an electrical engineering degree with an elective focus on aerospace/astrospace   Edit; I have been to two colleges and both have ""Engineering 101"" courses where you explore each engineering discipline and learn about each one to help you make a decision and be able to ask questions. Not sure if all of them do this though."
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,Thiggles,2,Sat Jul 11 09:22:35 2015 UTC,"If you're into circuits, computers, software, etc. then try looking into CE or EE and explore them a little to see which one peeks your interest the most. Check out what courses they take, what types projects they work on, where the students end up employed, and so on. You have a lot of free time now, so dive right in!   As for the aerospace industry, CE/EE are needed there as well. When the time comes, I recommend finding out if the uni you end up going to has a satellite design club. The one at my uni has tons of CE/EE in it and they get to work on some pretty cool stuff that often leads to internships/co-ops in the aerospace industry."
EngineeringStudents,3cvzk2,nlman0,2,Sat Jul 11 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with Aerospace is that it's a very specific degree. It's basically a mechanical engineering degree with a bunch of extra electives in aeronautical and astronautical topics. Because it's so specific, it limits the job prospects for graduates. It'd be great to work for NASA or SpaceX, but not every Aerospace engineer can do that.   If you like the electrical side, I would agree with everyone else and do Electrical/Computer engineering. But if you enjoy Aerospace more, I would suggest double majoring with mechanical. It's a really common double major since they have so many similar classes. That way, you'll have a fall back in case Aerospace doesn't work out. Best of luck!"

EngineeringStudents,3cvha5,RKO36,4,Sat Jul 11 04:08:35 2015 UTC,"I failed my first semester entirely when I started attending in 2005.  I took a semester off and came back, doing pretty well until I failed one more class.  That ended up getting my financial aid taken away and I had to drop out of college.  I joined the military, did that for several years and came back.  Now, it's all A's and I just landed an internship.  I had to retake every single class that I failed, and I'm still going to graduate on time.    A lot of this seriously just takes time and dedication, and you can't get upset about every little small failure in your life.  Whether or not it was someone else's fault, or no matter how serious it seems, the best advice is to just take it on the chin and keep going.  And no matter what people say, you need to understand Calc II.  Every class that you'll have in the future that people say is difficult is because they didn't do well in Calc II either.  Get the fundamentals and do it right; it will make things easier."
EngineeringStudents,3cvha5,TK05,5,Sat Jul 11 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"So you fail a class and get behind a semester? Don't let that discourage you. You now know what mistakes you made and can avoid them in the future. Do keep moving forward in your program. Giving up is the absolute worst thing you can do and you would never forgive yourself. If you end up failing, take the rest of your electives. Don't just sit on one class because you think you can't keep moving forward. Take any science/math/art/humanities electives you have left to get them out of the way. If you take another summer class or two you can most likely still graduate on time.  You can do it."
EngineeringStudents,3cvha5,aeipownzu,2,Sat Jul 11 05:06:07 2015 UTC,Hey man I was in the same situation as you but the other way around - I enjoyed Calculus but Physics II was holding me back. I failed it once and almost failed it again last semester and I was ready to retake it this summer.   All I can say is that if you really want to be an engineer just realize that it's just one class. If you fail again just retake it and hope for the best. Now that I passed Physics II I have had no trouble in my later courses.
EngineeringStudents,3cvha5,faceinthegrass,2,Sat Jul 11 05:18:16 2015 UTC,Aim for the 51 and be excited with anything higher.  Calc 2 is one of those courses where the general opinion is pass and move on.

EngineeringStudents,3cssav,DickingtonBallsworth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:18:46 2015 UTC,"On this note, another thing to think about is that you rarely get an MS in the accelerated programs. More likely you will get an ME, which is coursework based. The MS usually takes 6-12 months longer which reduces the benefit of the accelerated program.  An ME is not equivalent to an MS. It is important to understand the differences so you can decide whether an ME is worth it. For many jobs, an ME is usually enough. However, for R&D positions in particular, it is not."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,Hurricane043,4,Sat Jul 11 03:34:59 2015 UTC,I don't see any problems in the 4 yr plan to get two degrees. One suggestion I have is to get a part time internship/job at a local engineering firm. I think you'll want to know what you really want in your career before diving into a narrow focus in grad school. Classes give you some exposure to certain topics but real world experience is king because you really get to see what it's like day-to-day.
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,txhusky17,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"Real world experience is only ""king"" for a certain set of jobs.  Yes, those are the most common jobs, but if going on to a certain other set of positions then real world experience in a standard engineering job counts for nothing.  Just mentioning it so others understand it's not as simple as that blanket statement."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,Lattice_Bowel_Mvmnts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"My statement about real world experience being king was in comparison to what you get in a classroom, not that experience trumps everything in the engineering world. Yes, I understand that there are things like R&D and other areas where skills/things beyond experience is valuable.  I'm not sure I've seen a situation where real world experience for an engineering job would count for nothing though, like you mentioned.  My point was to say that OP may want to get some experience (be it in consulting, govt, R&D, etc) before settling in on a narrow path on grad school."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,txhusky17,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:49:31 2015 UTC,"The ""count for nothing"" comment was based on my experience.  I was in industry for 2 years with a BS, 3 years with a MS, and then did PhD.  Those first 2 years were as a design engineer, the last 3 as a CFD analyst.  Despite still doing CFD, and getting several patents related to it in the previous job, those 5 years of my work experience meant nothing to what I do now.  Now, in 5 years when I have the PhD level experience I'm sure that will trump school, but again, that first 5 years meant next to nothing.  And while I know that might not be common, it seems worth mentioning so options aren't closed/people can consider different paths."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,Lattice_Bowel_Mvmnts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:53:42 2015 UTC,Understandable. Was it in a completely different field which made it not applicable? I come from personal experience as well. Had I not had an internship after my junior year I would have done something completely different in grad school. I had profs painting one picture but it wasn't until I got the experience that showed just how different it actually was outside of school.
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,txhusky17,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"Not completely different field.  Last job before PhD was applying CFD commercial codes to automotive purposes, creating best practices for design engineers to take over some of the work without having to know the ins and outs, etc...  The next step is still CFD, but in the role of deriving new methods to solve as yet unsatisfactorily modeled issues.  So, at first it was nice I didn't have to learn what CFD is from scratch, but there is a massive difference between the application side and the development side.  But, I think you hit on a key point, the work experience also helped me narrow down what I wanted to do.  It's just that it wasn't a selling point in what I do now.  It is almost totally about the PhD and publications.  The MS job also didn't pull anything from my design engineer position and everything I needed for that job came from a progression of graduate coursework built on the undergrad."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,Lattice_Bowel_Mvmnts,3,Fri Jul 10 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"I am taking my course in Mec. Eng.  3 years + 2 years = Masters Degree. You have to do the 5 years or you get no degree. Not masters  nor anything else. Just some diploma saying ""specialist in sciences of mechanical engineering"" - which is nothing.  I am going to my 4th year now, and what I can tell you is that it is not good to rush things.   I failed a few subjects (right now I have 25 done and I should have 30 but I can recover until the end anyway) and I have been having more subjects than I should have. This means I am taking like the ""accelerated"" program now because I ran too slow earlier xD  Anyway, this leads to what I want to tell for my experience. As I don't want to leave anything behind anymore, I have to rush and I don't study as much as I should for each subject. In the end, I can tell sometimes I loose self confidence in a lot of ways, when I was the best student before the university and even got payed some prizes. I entered as one of the best. And now look at me, I feel I'm getting dumber each day.  So do things slowly and keep it under control so you'll learn more and more! That's the best way to do it."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,cptfreak3,2,Fri Jul 10 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"take some time and do some independent research on subjects you want to specialize in. Talk to your professors, talk to professionals, get an internship. Don't be afraid to take year off and work in a subject/topic you might like to specialize in.  YOU MAY FIND THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE A PARTICULAR TOPIC, YOU MAY NOT LIKE TO DO IT FOR A JOB. The academic and professional sides of any type of engineering can be wildly different."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,slorider,2,Fri Jul 10 15:21:11 2015 UTC,If it were me i would take my time a bit. I would rather be not too stressed for 5 or 6 years than be really stressed for 4.

EngineeringStudents,3cssav,MiddleClassSeaBass,5,Fri Jul 10 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure what country you're in but in Canada it's pretty much illegal to get an engineering degree  in under 4 years. So I would double check that.  General rule of a masters if they're not paying you, then you're getting ripped off. It's a lot of work and you want to be compensated.  How accelerated masters work is that you take a couple of fourth year courses with an elevated ""difficulty"" I.e. All of your projects and assignments are done independently, if you want to hate yourself... Then go for it!  Do some research, are you doing a course based masters or a research based masters? If it's course based, then make sure that it is in a field that has a lot of opportunity, and one that you are interested in. You need to be able to convince an employer that doing more school makes you more qualified.   If it's research based masters then I would suggest doing the 4 years and then doing your masters, your thesis matters and you want to make sure that you can dedicated our full attention to it. Science cannot be rushed.   But in general there are 2 things that you need to get into a masters:   A supervisor- this is by far the most important part: when you have a supervisor you get a project and potential funding. How do you get one? Talk to your profs and try not to be a tool :) Minimum grades: this can be alleviated if you have a prof but it just reduces the hassle.   Remember! Nowadays a degree is just a check mark what you do outside of school is what gets you your dream job."

If someone wanted to overload themselves with 20 credit hour semesters and summer courses, provided they pass, I don't see why that would be a problem.   I mean, doing it in 4 years itself is tough, but entirely doable. I wouldn't recommend it, I did the 5 year plan myself, but I could have changed very little and done it easily in 4.5 and 4 if I did summer courses."

EngineeringStudents,3cssav,dide101,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:52:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I wonder why they require it by years rather than by simply requiring an engineering degree from an accredited university - as many US states do."

EngineeringStudents,3cssav,Gyang193,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"If you're sure you want to do a certain MS, and you're confident enough in your ability to pull the grades and do the extra curricular stuff at the same time, do option A. MS in 4 years? $$$ please. Downsize is that this may not allow you to build adequate work experience and you may not make the wisest choices regarding your long term future when you're 21.   If you don't mind spending the additional year and all else still applies, go option B to make things a little easier. You also may be better off focusing on some internships where you can bolster your resume and gain work experience while taking an easier class schedule, which would probably be more helpful in the longrun than trying to eliminate one year in the process. People will be impressed by your abilities, accomplishments, and extracurricular projects, than by the fact that you graduated undergrad in 3 years. I work with structural engineers regularly and personally I don't give a shit how quickly they graduated, I care about how well they are able to contribute to a project.   In regards to option C... I did a similar 4+1 program my first run through college and got a BS+MS after 5 years (though it was a business program). It was great to be done with it quickly, HOWEVER I didn't have the work experience to get into a good gig relevant to my degree and ended up in a different industry where my masters isn't really being used (and where in retrospect I may not have even wanted to go).   My advice is to be very sure of what you want in your future and to be sure you get enough real world experience under your belt before you commit time and money to an MS that may drive you down a certain path (regardless of which option you're choosing). I really don't think you're going to regret spending a year or two after undergrad working in an industry and having a company pay for your degree when you have a little more experience in the real world. Also, I really feel like having the professional background in graduate school not only helps you focus your efforts, but you're a little more mature and you may able to better relate to professors and fellow students who have a similar professional background."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,lopsiness,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"If you're crazy smart and can handle, it's probably not a terrible option. It's a case by case situation. I did 5 years for BS (changed my major a couple times) and did 2 for MS. I don't begrudge the time at all. If I had my MS after a program like that I'd be in the wrong field and probably wouldn't have gotten as much out of what I did. But that's just what I needed."
EngineeringStudents,3cssav,madbadanddangerous,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind with option C is that you'd be getting a different kind of degree.

Whether that makes a significant difference or not will depend on your career goals."

The fastest growing fields I would have to say are computer science/engineering, or the green sector of chemical engineering (There could be more). If you don't want to do civil engineering, don't do civil engineering. The job opportunities for each engineering major are great (as long as you get experience during college and get good grades you should not have any issues).   There has been a pretty large influx of civil engineers in recent years from what I have seen so competition will be increased very soon. Research which branch of engineering interests you the most and pick that one. Majoring in something you like rather than what you are told will make your college career and even your life much more enjoyable.   As for the school question, I'm not sure. US News has an engineering ranking system that is very good/accurate. Here. I would look at this for your school ranking information to see how good it is."

EngineeringStudents,3cucid,theloneliestgirlincs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"I believe any of the three core engineering fields, namely Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical are worth studying. In terms of financial return, the top fields are Chemical Engineering, closely followed by Electrical Engineering, where either field can get you in the six figure range of salary. Civil and Mech I believe are more middle of the pack when it comes to salary, but they still pay relatively high compared to non-STEM fields.  Picking an engineering field to study should rely on your interests, not on what your neighbour says. If you like building Lego or woodworking, Civil and Mechanical sounds right. If you like tinkering with electronics or computers, go to Electrical. If you like building paper planes or rockets, go to Aerospace.  I can't say much about schools in the US since I'm Canadian, but I will say MIT, Stanford, Caltech are some of the top Engineering schools down there.

I am a Mechanical engineer and it is fantastic. I am currently making a bed loft and using the equations and things learned in class to determine the safety factor.  I do not want there to be a reasonable chance of the loft breaking and sending a 400 pound bed crashing down on my head.    Engineering also speaks to me because I can never ever leave good enough alone.  I come up with all these rather simple fixes to make my life easier and then have to spend the next 6 hours designing them and walking through the assembly process untill the idea is 80 percent complete.  Then I never actually do anything because I have zero free time.  I  will,  one day,  finish at least one project."

EngineeringStudents,3cue4s,hugababoo,4,Fri Jul 10 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that your classes at school aren't designed to teach you the ""real stuff"" you encounter at work. Any interviewer for an entry level job will know this. What school is supposed to teach you (at least at the undergrad level) is how to think like an engineer, give you a taste of what kinds of problems exist in your field, how problems have been solved in the past, and give you some basic knowledge and vocabulary so that you can be easily trained in the field you want to enter. Your internship experience is also invaluable to eventually getting hired, and will demonstrate that you can learn the necessary skills to do whatever job it is you get hired for.     As for the point about side projects, I wouldn't say that they're necessary to get hired, but they help if you have little else on your resume (which doesn't seem like the case for you)."
EngineeringStudents,3cue4s,aquaphobic,2,Fri Jul 10 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"As far as side projects.  You will do them if you are interested in it.. no matter your 30+ hours work... what summer courses are available during the summer if you have only 10 classes left... maybe you have some english/history/ art etc to do... one class + 30hrs work should leave you enough time to do some dabbling.  I have on my desk right now a Tiva C, Intel Edison, 2 ESP8266-01, 2ESP8266-201's.  Do I touch them every time I sit at my desk?  No.  But I have LED's, IR sensors, Temp sensors attached to them so all I need to do is program them to do something different.  Yea, you're right.  School teaches us tools, it's a ""virtual world"" of sorts but projects are about what you like to do... not resume fodder.  Just my 2cents"
EngineeringStudents,3cue4s,Mycophiles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"You don't go to college to learn ""the real stuff"". You go to school to learn the theory behind it and the fundamental problem solving aspects, as there are so many different jobs out there it's not possible to teach ""the real stuff"" at any meaningful level. That is why internships or other extracurricular activities are so important, to get you started on something more specific.  Don't sweat it too much during the school year, focus on your grades and learning the fundamental theory. Maybe join an engineering related club, but learn that theory the best you can and you will be more valuable."
EngineeringStudents,3cqjgo,_subvert_,27,Thu Jul 9 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"Some general tips:  For resume:   Have a good-looking, easy-to-read resume.  A nicely formatted one that doesn't take away from ease of use can really stand out. List ANY experience that is relevant, but use your judgement.  The model bridge you built in middle school probably won't help much, but if you coded something for a hobby fairly recently (high school is about as early as you want to go, unless you REALLY rocked something earlier and can elaborate on it still today), you can list that as an achievement. On any jobs, volunteer work, or projects, make it clear WHAT you did, and how that benefited the group. BE CONCISE.  Resumes only get skimmed on the first pass. If spelling and grammar aren't your forte, get someone else to proofread it.  Career centers can be great for this, if your school has one. If you seek resume advice from someone at a career center, remember that the person deciding whether you get a job or not in a technical field will have reasonable technical knowledge. Goes along with a few points above, but if you get advice from someone, remember that it is ultimately up to YOU to decide what goes on your resume.  Use your best judgement. Research the company, and adjust your resume for each company you apply to.  If you have an objective statement, this should always get revised slightly between companies.  Otherwise, this is mostly a matter of adjusting what comes first--the higher up a section is, the more relevant it should be.   For interviews:   Work on your speech and body language.  If your school has a career center with mock interviews available, this can really help.  Learn to recognize your nervous habits and either suppress or disguise them. If you don't do it already, work on solving problems out loud.  If an interviewer asks you to solve a problem or puzzle, they want to know how you think, not whether you can get the right answer.  And ""I don't know"" isn't an invalid answer--but if it's a factual question, you should be able to follow it up with ""but I could find out by _____."" Take notes during the interview, especially if you had to answer ""I don't know"" like above.  Take the time after to look up those things, if any, so that if there's any followup, you can say, ""By the way, I found out _____."" Have a few questions that you would like answered at the end of the interview (most interviewers will ask then if you have any).  Some may be addressed at the start, such as hours, responsibilities, etc.  Have some basics like those, but throw in a few specific questions, so you have something to say.  (Asking about pay is usually a major faux pas on first interviews, especially for internships.  And btw, ""never be the first to name a number"" is a common--and valid--strategy for interviewees.) In the unlikely event that you get a rude interviewer: Keep calm and carry on politely.  You can vent later; for now, make it clear that you are a professional... or at least have a professional attitude. Do not make any assumptions about the interviewer.  You may get a manager, a potential peer, or someone from HR.  They may not introduce themselves in a way that makes it clear what their role is in the company.  Treat them all with respect.  Assume they know things that are, in your opinion, ""common knowledge"" to your field, but be willing to explain if they ask. If you are contacted and asked for a good time for an interview, don't just say when you're free--give them an actual set time and date, with about a 2-hour window.  Use a time when you have some flexibility, and let them know you can adjust.  Scheduling can be a PITA, and this takes some work away from the interviewer's end--they'll appreciate it, though they may not explicitly thank you.   I've mostly been on the job-seeking side of the table, but I overhear a fair number of comments on interviews from coworkers.  Let me know if you have any questions."
EngineeringStudents,3cqjgo,tinycatsays,6,Fri Jul 10 01:07:11 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for putting the time in to answer my question. I really appreciate it.

EngineeringStudents,3cqjgo,mrpyrotec89,5,Fri Jul 10 01:17:04 2015 UTC,"And a couple important tips when interviewing. At some point during the interview ,preferably near the start, ask what they are looking for in a candidate. They will prattle off some keywards, then for the rest of the interview tailor your responses to repeat those keywards and show how you represent them. When I have had to interview kids I had an interview guide which had 4 categories (leadership, autonomy, competitiveness, intelligence). Honestly i had no idea what the fuck I was looking for, if someone said those words i would think more highly of that person. I don't think most interviewers know what their doing either, their enigneers.  Also at the end when they ask if you have any questions the first thing you should ask is if they have any concerns about you or your resume and if you can speak to that. Super helpful because it allows you to combat their largest criticism of you. 8/10 Engineers cannot communicate. Be the other two, it goes a long way."

EngineeringStudents,3cqjgo,urfavewhitegirl,7,Fri Jul 10 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"Big companies like Google (or Pepsi, Apple, etc) hire personalities. They will check your resume for GPA and experience, don't get me wrong. But these are companies that want to see outgoing, friendly, innovative, hard working type A people. It won't matter that someone is a 3.9 at A&M if they are awkward and are most comfortable trapped behind a desktop for most of the work day. So really brig out your personality in these interviews -- make small talk, joke a little, laugh when appropriate. Answer the interview questions with a calm, personable air that tells them you are a perfect fit for their culture. Think about what places like this might ask before your interview. Utilize glassdoor.com and the like. And don't be afraid to say ""I don't know"". Be prepared with follow up questions. Think of the interview as more of a conversation. Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3cqjgo,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see this being recommended. I thought that it would be a good approach but I've never really heard from anyone directly stating that.   I actually took that approach with my phone interview (not the same as in person, but still) for the internship where I currently reside. My manager, who was interviewing me, seemed to ease up over the phone and even get more comfortable himself when I wasn't sounding like a robot for lack of a better term.   Fast forward to today. They have been interviewing people for a full time position and I heard my manager talk about the high level of professionalism that someone had in an almost negative term. He was making it clear to who he was talking to that he liked the candidate but he was mentioning how it seemed odd. So I find that interesting given your comment.  Thanks!"

EngineeringStudents,3cqjgo,PriceZombie,3,Fri Jul 10 04:50:11 2015 UTC,"For Google, Microsoft, other top-tier CS jobs, this is more appropriate for a CS subreddit as software developer positions have different recruiting procedures from general engineering positions. Here are my tips. Also, this is a pretty popular topic and you should be able to find lots of info about this through Google.   PROGRAM!! Find projects you are interested in, open source, personal website, robotics team, twitter clone, etc. and write them. Focus on things you like or want to learn more about. This will build a portfolio of relevant skills and help you figure out what you like doing. You must be very good at programming to get a job at these places. Its also important that these projects are significant. Programming an Android app that just takes notes is irrelevant but a full game or app that interfaces with your own backend that tracks stats and does more interesting stuff etc. is worthwhile. Still do the first Android app but know that you need to do more to impress these companies. Learn your data structures and algorithms cold. You should know mergesort and quicksort and when to choose one vs the other. What's a hash table and is one implemented? How to implement a queue? What's Big-O notation and can you figure out the complexity of your implementation quickly? Is it optimal? CLRS is the most recommended textbook for learning this. GPA. From WVU, I'm guessing there's a GPA cutoff. You must have a relatively GPA to get your resume through the normal channels noticed. However, if you have really cool projects, open source contributions, know a friend at Google who can refer you, then the GPA doesn't matter as much. Internships. What are you doing this summer? Why aren't you working at a software company? It doesn't matter if it isn't Google but previous work experience is very important for next year's internship applications and the year after's full-time applications. Network. Try to find recent WVU alumni who work at these companies who might be friends of friends (LinkedIn is great for this). Once you know those people decently well, you can ask for a referral or interview tips etc.    You do the all of the above you should be able to get interviews. CS interviews are notorious for being pieces of shit.    Learn how to do software interviews. First, use Cracking the Coding Interview to understand how to approach these problems and specific problems. Save ~10 different problems that you haven't seen before. Find a friend to give you an interview on 3 problems you haven't seen.  As other posters have mentioned, be friendly and engaging during the interview. Beyond technical skill, interviewers are looking for someone that they want to sit next to and chat with at lunch. Don't be pretentious, shy, smelly, arrogant, or neckbeard-y during the interview."

EngineeringStudents,3cqjgo,WVbrU,2,Fri Jul 10 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"Have meaningful and relevant hobbies/interests. Show that you apply yourself as an engineer outside of school just as much as you do in school. This means projects that aren't part of design and that you take initiative or the lead on. Since you're CPE, maybe you contribute regularly to an open-source project and maintain an active portfolio of projects on Github (just making stuff up, I'm an ME, but you get the point).  Demonstrate that you actively seek out challenges and are capable of working independently. Good interns will complete all the projects assigned to them. Great ones will go above and beyond, and then look for more work to get involved in.  Personality is a given. Be enthusiastic, do your research on the company, and engage the interviewer. Getting to the interview = you have the skills needed to work there. Passing the interview = you are someone they would want to work with. Companies hire people, not faceless blobs of skill.  With all that said, GPA (above a 3.5 at least for Google and competitive places) will matter. A high GPA is very rarely an indicator of a poor candidate. This is pretty important as large/competitive companies will filter and screen resumes by GPA."

Ask professors about research and get involved with competitions (getting into a lead position helps a lot).

At a certain level, every applicant will be very similar and you need to make an impression.  Just imagine all the resumes that Google gets.  I'm sure most of the people have good grades and have done cool projects and all that jazz that everyone knows they are supposed to be doing.  It comes down to what can you do/have you done that separates you from the rest?  It could be something simple like you have varied and extensive work experience (rather than working at one place for the last 4 years) or something seemingly unrelated like playing junior hockey.    I had an internship at a major oil company and they are pretty selective just like some of those big tech companies.  That was the main thing that stood out to me about all of my co-interns.  Most of them had some interesting fact behind them.  One had recently done research at Harvard. One played junior hockey. One was a DJ.

EngineeringStudents,3ctr81,Getupboi,3,Fri Jul 10 18:31:27 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.  Long answer: Maybe, it really depends. It's becoming quite popular to have a surface/tablet replace regular pen and paper. I've seen their notes, and they are most of the time, so organized and neat that it almost makes me want to study. I've also seen those same people browse reddit when they really should be taking down notes - so... It depends if you will be one of those people.   OneNote on Surface is really popular, it has text and writing capabilities. If you are planning to switch to iPad, I'd recommend Notability (for the small price of $3? I think?). If you can physically restrain yourself from browsing the internet when you shouldn't be, then go for it!  Personally, I like the texture of graphite scratching away on top of a hard wood desk."

One thing I miss is with electronic notes, you have them anywhere and everywhere. This is way more convenient than a notebook."
EngineeringStudents,3ctr81,Blu3Army73,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"I try to do it as much as I can, but in some cases it's just not practical. As a result I have 2 big filing boxes full of notes and an external hard-drive backup of all my files on the cloud.  The biggest disadvantage to laptops or tablets (even with writing stylus) instead of a good-ole' notebook is that drawing charts, graphs, and using obscure symbols with annotations takes way too long and you lose the pace of the class; ESPECIALLY if you have professors like mine who erase the boards rather quickly. Not even note-capturing apps that optimize whiteboard pictures are that practical because professors will often edit what they put on the board, someone's head will always be in the way, and I doubt many professors will be ok with people having their phones out all the time.  That being said, it's great to go paperless. For literature or history classes where everything is written out plainly, typing can be a huge advantage. It saves paper and storage space. This also applies to digital handouts and notes you may get from your professor. Odds are these are perfectly fine staying in an organized computer filing system, but I know some people who still insist on printing everything out.  But if you reeeally want to go the extra mile, digitizing your notes can be a great way to organize all your notes and get a little extra studying in. It can take a lot of time if you don't keep up with it or have a clunky scanner. Retyping notes can also be a big time commitment, but can definitely pay off. Being able to access my notes anywhere, even on my phone while I'm riding the train, is enormously helpful. It also beats having to carry 6 binders with me everywhere.  tl;dr: Digitize and go paperless as much as you can so long as you can still create and access your notes as easily as a notebook. Being able to keep all of your documents and projects in one place is great for any engineering student, but make sure the extra work to make the transition will pay off."

EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,aeipownzu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"Heyy, an ASU ChemE! How do you like the program?  I wanted to go to ASU but they only accepted me as a Chemistry major. Oh well! UA is pretty nice and I like it so far.  To address your point though, I have a friend who is double majoring in ChemE and Aerospace Engineering. She's been doing fine so far with a good GPA and a manageable course load. She really wants to work in the Aerospace industry though, so maybe I'd advise only double majoring if you have a particular goal in mind (and not just for the heck of it).  I'm majoring in ChemE and minoring in Japanese because my goal is to work in East Asia for a while and with East Asian companies for long term (either directly for them or for companies who do business with them). I take on the extra course work because I have a goal in mind."
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,rockincellist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"Hey a fellow UA ChemE. I've been to both schools actually, I transferred to ASU. Personally I didn't like UA and Tucson is a terrible place. I had my bike stolen 3 times in one year! You can always transfer and I definitely recommend it. The ChemE program here is outstanding with great professors compared to UA. Get a 3.3GPA at the least at UA, then when you transfer ASU will offer you 8,000/11,000 in scholarships guaranteed. While ASU gets a bad reputation, it is actually a very well ranked school."
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,aeipownzu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"Hnngggg but I like UA and Tucson. Except that bike thing. I lost a bike. :(  I've already transferred into UA from CA community college and I'm starting my Junior year, so I don't really think I have that option anymore (not enough time, tired of transferring); I'm probably sticking with UA till the end. I do like the (few) ChEE professors I've encountered here and I absolutely love the Japanese department here.  I'll consider it for grad school though! Phoenix is nice, and my brother goes to ASU. I've been to the campus quite a few times and it is nice!"
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,rockincellist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:12:45 2015 UTC,"When I decided to double major, it was because I love both engineering and math. By only majoring in engineering, I feel like I would be almost cheating myself by not exploring my favorite subject further (I don't really see a minor as being enough). I am very aware that if I double major not many employers will care about that and that the math major will not directly help engineering.  I have a feeling that I may not want to do engineering forever, however. For this, I want to keep my options open with something else that I love which is math (i'm not sure how yet though). Not sure if this is a good enough reason for anyone, but that's my current mentality to say the least."
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,aeipownzu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:19:16 2015 UTC,This is a good reason to double major. I'm glad this is your reason and not something else. Good luck!
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,austriangirl_21,3,Fri Jul 10 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I believe there are good news and bad news. For me, someone double majoring in ME and EE, I had to take up to 20 units a semester. I was able to still somewhat keep my sanity and good health, but it was extremely stressful and I found myself experiencing anxiety that I had never felt before. I found that when I forced myself to get at least 5 to 6 hours of sleep a night (unless its a test of course :P) I felt better through the week. I also drank a lot of tea because personally, it helped me relax. I had a very good schedule set out for when to spend time on each individual class that allowed me to feel like I had more control. I think that having a good schedule that will allow you to have specific times set out for the classes that you have work in that week will help because you won't feel like you have an insane amount of clutter and work overwhelming you.  I do not think double majoring reduces your abilities to join clubs and get internships at all. Clubs usually have meetings at nights and clubs, such as ASME, that have trips, sometimes have the trips or competitions on weekends (at least for my school personally). As for internships, yes summer school can cause some issues depending on what time the class is being held. If you can, find an internship that is either a) willing to let you work odd hours (around the summer classes) or b) somewhere directly in your schools town that you can have a year-long part-time internship. The internship part really could be the only thing I say is bad. You might have to just get lucky with where you apply and hopefully find someone willing to work with you. Maybe you will even have a summer that is free!   Good luck with double majoring. It could be really fun and rewarding. Be sure its what you want  - it is a lot of work but if you really think you can handle it, then it could be worth it. :)"
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,EngineerInTraining,2,Fri Jul 10 06:40:28 2015 UTC,"You are a freshman and proverbially know nothing. Take GenEds and base classes for both first semester. Talk to upperclassmen and figure out what courseload you can handle.  My personal opinion is the double majoring especially in two related majors (two humanities majors or two STEM majors) is almost always 100% useless. No employer or grad school is going to care about having two degrees. First, think about and discover what you like doing. Then pick the major closest to what you like doing. Take classes that match what you want to do and secondarily fulfill degree requirements. Take classes not in your major that match what you want to do. Graduate and start doing what you want to do.  I think the only time a double major makes sense if you double major something out of your field. For example doing MechE and Art History so you can identify and appreciate art for the rest of your life or MechE / Business for obvious reasons. However, I think its almost always more optimal to take just the classes in the other major that interest you. If doing so, leaves you two extra classes to take to get the degree, then take the extra classes to get the degree."
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,BNicholasEarl,2,Fri Jul 10 15:13:24 2015 UTC,You can take more then  four years to get a four year degree... Plus the extra time would give you a chance to build a better repituar for grad aplications.  Take it a pace that lets you apriciate the classes you are taking. Don't let other people's standards get in the way of learning what you want to learn in college. The world will always have a place for someone with an ambitious and unique education.  Happy hunting.
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,mozzarella_past,2,Fri Jul 10 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Some people are saying a double major in math is useless. Its not useless at all. Honestly, who cares if a recruiter says it doesn't matter? That's not why you're going to university. Your primary reason is to learn. Maybe you wont use what you learn in an upper level math class in your everyday engineering job, but if you want to learn algebraic topology and enjoy the beauty of math, I say you should go for it. I know i'm more than likely not going to use quantum field theory if I work in industry, but I still like learning about it. If I were you OP, I would say to go for it. I'm involved in research and multiple clubs and my GPA hasn't suffered too much. Im not stressed out and I still have friends and a social life.   It depends on the type of person you are, and what you want to get out of engineering. Are you in engineering to make a paycheck at the end of the day, or are you in engineering to develop a better understanding of the world and to learn. Either choice is fine, it just depends on your belief. Lastly, consider taking an extra year if possible. That way you wont be under so much pressure.  Good Luck with your decision!"
EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,foxycat11,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:02:23 2015 UTC,Do you mean you have a maximum of 17 hours of class a week? My first year was 26-28 per semester and I've seen upper year schedules approach 40 for single major engineering.

EngineeringStudents,3crkcn,bobskizzle,2,Fri Jul 10 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"I'd guess your classes require more time out of class than mine, so the total workload probably evens out. That being said, I played competitive sports in high school so I'm used to having to manage my time.  Some things that might help you stay on top of it whether or not you do the double major:   Get ahead when you can. The workload gets heavier later in the semester, so if you use your extra time early to really understand the material and read ahead if you can.  If you're struggling with a concept ask a friend, TA, prof etc asap. Studying for exams and coming across something you didn't get two months ago sucks. I personally prefer to devote lecture time to trying to understand, taking minimal notes. I then review the material and make up proper notes later that day. Figure out what works for you.  DO PROBLEM SETS Find a way to unwind. Engineering is intense; it can be a sport, club, hobby, partying, netflix, whatever, but if you value your sanity you need a way to destress.   This has all been said before, and everybody has their own ways of dealing. Poke around this sub for lots more tips and figure out what works for you. Good luck!"

EngineeringStudents,3cpf7w,FeelTripp,2,Thu Jul 9 22:59:46 2015 UTC,"Take a circle of radius = 1. 1 radian = 1 radius. The distance around the circle is 2 pi radians (roughly 6.28). Half the distance around the circle is 1 pi radians. A quarter distance around the circle is pi/2 radians. If you want, you can divide the circle out into as many pieces as you want. Say a full circle is 2x pi/x and make x = 4. This cuts the pi. A full circle is 8 pi/4 (2 pi), a half is 4 pi/4 (pi) and an eigth is pi/4. So you can add however many these eight pieces together to get your distance around the circle."

EngineeringStudents,3cpf7w,lopsiness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:42:28 2015 UTC,Not the person you were asking but most of my classmates who had a tough time in calc 1 just didn't have the algebra skills required to pick it up easily. Either they'd taken it awhile ago and just didn't remember or they'd never learned it very well in the first place and had to struggle to keep up with what was going on in lecture. Reviewing that stuff before the class started would have really helped.
EngineeringStudents,3cpf7w,herestoshuttingup,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:46:41 2015 UTC,That was the case on my classes too. I was perplexed why someone would struggle so hard in calc 1 and then ace calc 2.
EngineeringStudents,3cpf7w,Lublib,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:11:41 2015 UTC,For me I think calc 2 was easier because calc 1 forced me to step up my algebra and trig game. By the time I got to calc 2 I was pretty much an algebra pro which made things much easier.
EngineeringStudents,3cpf7w,AmumuIsOP,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm quite the anomaly, at least from an academic standpoint. As a child I was classified as twice exceptional (ADHD and high IQ) so I naturally am a huge slacker/procrastinator. In high school I never developed study habits because I took could just ace the tests without much effort.  In my freshman year I went into calc 1 with the same attitude, thinking I could just emulate my behavior in high school. I ended up failing the course and only managed a C in my second attempt.   I can't really say that I had a good background in algebra/trig upon entering calc 2 because I never really paid attention to what I learned in high school. If anything I relearned all of what I was supposed to know as I progressed through the course."

EngineeringStudents,3cow0n,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Thu Jul 9 19:31:21 2015 UTC,I prefer the Casio scientific calculators but TI graphing calculators. I have a cheap Casio (Fx300-ES) I got in high school that has lasted me for years and it does most of what I need. It can't do algebra or integrate anything but if I can't use a graphing calculator it's my go-to.
EngineeringStudents,3cow0n,molasses,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"I love my Casio fx-115ES Plus. I also have a Casio Classpad II which is super-fantastic for graphing, but I only really used it through difeq because my engineering classes mostly require that we use FE-approved calculators."

All of my other classes didn't really care about what calculator you had, but it was easier to have a TI89.

I'm really used to the 84, been using it for like 6 years. Used the Nspire for a semester in high school, and didn't really care for it. There were some nice features, but a lot of it just seemed really clunky compared to the 84."

I had the majority of my exam say no calculator allowed which means professors need to keep the numbers nice.
EngineeringStudents,3cow0n,MiddleClassSeaBass,3,Thu Jul 9 21:12:15 2015 UTC,Ive never needed a graphing calculator. If i need a graph i use my pc.
EngineeringStudents,3cow0n,ASmallCrane,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it's probably a case by case thing.

EngineeringStudents,3cow0n,MiddleClassSeaBass,2,Thu Jul 9 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"I used my TI-36X Pro for nearly everything. It does pretty much everything I need better than the Ti-84 I have. It puts fractions on-top of each other so it's really easy to stay organized. It's simple and fast to work with large numbers because I don't need to use the 2nd button. It's fast with things like sin-1 and sinh because I can just click the button twice. It will take derivatives and integrals of equations which I can't do on my Ti-84 (that I know of). It can work with matricies and is much more intuitive than the Ti-84. It can do complex math and work in other bases, made that part of my ECE class really easy. It can solve a system of three equations faster and easier than my Ti-84. It has a large list of universal constants that I can quickly find and use. I can press one button to switch between a fractional answer and an approximate one. It can do all the basic statistical analysis that was required for one of my stats classes. It literally has everything I have needed except for graphing capability. If I get to the point where I would need a graph I would just open the wolfram alpha app on my phone and get an easier to use UI as well as one that is about 10x as powerful. I have never been able to use a graphing calculator on a test where the Ti-36X Pro wasn't a better choice."

I'm a fan fan of the pentel graphgear 1000 pencils overall - not too expensive, come in 4 lead sizes (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and can be bought as a kit.  I took many many many pages of notes with the 0.9mm pencil - lead that thick just doesn't break.  And when you're finished you retract the tip, so it doesn't get damaged (that's what happened to most of my pentel p20x series - the metal tip at the front gets crushed/damaged and it no longer feeds well).  I also like graph paper notebooks for courses with lots math (having the vertical lines makes planning/spacing easier) or where you need to draw graphs or free body diagrams.    A good short (6"") slightly bendy steel ruler.  A few high quality binders.  If you're going to do hand drafting you're probably going to need some scales, but wait until the course tells you exactly what you need.  I wouldn't buy an expensive drawing equipment until I was told exactly what I need.  It's possible that you don't need a drawing board at all and can just use one at school.  A non graphic calculator, as others have suggested.  See if one on the approved list has good matrices functions - those can save you a lot of time.  Most of the time calculators that can do more than 3x3 matrices aren't allowed, though."

However, I still recommend buying some fine-tip pens (multiple colours is nice), because they are useful for when the prof allows handwritten cheatsheets for exams.   Mendeley is very useful for classes involving writing reports. You can download it for free.   Also useful to have are highlighters and sticky tabs (or flags) for organizing hardcopy notes of any sort."

(And later passed the ME PE Exam with materials/design focus, FWIW). I still find the EE stuff useful, at least on the occasions I actually get to be an engineer.  I'd recommend EE, and maybe  fit in some ME electives (fluid mechanics, and statics and dynamics, mechanics of materials if they're not part of your basic curriculum) to see how you like it. For undergrad, the fundamentals are important - but you're really learning how to solve problems as much as anything.

EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,voodoogod,2,Thu Jul 9 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with /u/daftroses. I've nearly completely failed 2 or 3 semesters because of burnout and listening to my advisors. See what classes you need to take to progress within your degree and, if at all possible, spread your classes out (many pre-reqs are usually also co-reqs) and put off ones that you don't need to take for awhile. Also, say goodbye to your summers, that is if you want to remain sane during the school year. But this is just my personal suggestion and what's worked for me, so take it with a grain of salt."
EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,muuushu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:09:32 2015 UTC,"Go to all the courses for the first week and get familiar with the syllabuses/professors. If you think it's going to be too much, drop the courses that are offered later on and aren't prereqs to anything. It's better to take a light load and an extra semester rather than cramming everything in and burning out. Your GPA will be higher and you'll have a better time overall."
EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,daftroses,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about taking full course loads, just try to keep your GPA as high as you possibly can to nail that first internship.   The days of summer internships and full time schooling are gone now, it's perfectly normal to finish a BS in Engineering in 4-6 years. Nowadays, the most EMPLOYABLE students after finishing university are the ones that took time off from school to work Fall/Spring semester internships and co-ops and load up their resumes.   Their resume looks great since engineering companies would prefer to not train a new hire from scratch, and all of the previous work experience shows that you at least know what to expect.   As far as I know, no company looks at how long it's taken you to finish your degree. It's all about how well you can get along/work with other people and how much experience you have."
EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,icantfeelmynips,2,Mon Jul 13 23:17:47 2015 UTC,Yea haha. This is almost the exact same as the semester I have coming up in September.
EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,sasinsss,8,Thu Jul 9 23:46:17 2015 UTC,Are you at ASU tempe? If so get Heckman for linear algebra and it's a breeze.  Most of the E&M professors are awful so read the book and use online resources to learn everything.  Wolfram is your friend for Differential Equations. I did almost every webwork problem with wolfram because it's honestly mostly just busy work.  Not a bad semester at all. You'll probably look back at it and wish they were all that easy material wise. That doesn't mean you won't be very busy though. Those 15 credits and 2 labs (I think?) will take     significant amounts of time.
EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,originalfedan,3,Thu Jul 9 21:31:13 2015 UTC,"As an ASU student about to go into that. The post gave me anxiety, but this comment helped."

EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,Apfelstrudel1996,2,Fri Jul 10 05:12:51 2015 UTC,"I had Chen for physics 1 and he was ok. He spent most of the class going over examples from the textbook, which I liked. However, he went through the them pretty quickly, so you're going to have to keep up. He also allows cheat sheets on his exams, even the final, but be prepared for curveball questions that weren't necessarily covered in the examples. Most of the class failed the second test because of this. He also curves your final grade by a generous amount (I ended up with a B surprisingly). If you aren't used to Asian accents, you're going to have a hard time understanding him.   That's basically Chen in a nutshell."
EngineeringStudents,3cpuop,originalfedan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:24:12 2015 UTC,"This all sounds like my physics teacher from high school.

I didn't have him for Heat/Mass though. Mu is whatever, I had him for Heat/Mass and Separations, he literally teaches from the book but he also gives a decent amount of extra credit opportunity.   I had Green for Thermo too, I wasn't a huge fan of his style of lecturing and he wasn't good at answering questions for people who wanted a better overall understanding of what he talks about. It did seem like people in Green were a bit better at the concepts we covered though, he does a bit more theoretical concepts and derivations than Forzani."

EngineeringStudents,3cplel,MsShuffles,3,Thu Jul 9 19:29:05 2015 UTC,Buy the lindeburg review book and study the topics. There's also a document on the NCEES website that has the topics to be covered.
EngineeringStudents,3cplel,brickrickslick,2,Thu Jul 9 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'll check the lindeburg book out. Thank you, I had only seen the FE review manuals on the NCEES site. I have looked at all the topics covered in both the Mechanical and Civil exams, which is why I made this post. I have mechanical experience at my internship, but am worried that there are gaps in my knowledge that I would have gained from taking the actual courses. I am looking for Arch E's that have taken either the mechanical or civil exam and can give input as to what they encountered on the exam that was from the courses outside of the Arch E curriculum. I may need to add an edit here shortly of the topics outside of the Arch E curriculum that I will need to learn for each exam. I am more or less trying to decide which exam's sections I have not learned would be easiest to try and learn in approximately a month's time."
EngineeringStudents,3cplel,civil_liberty,3,Thu Jul 9 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"There is no ""General"" FE test on the NCEES website.

EngineeringStudents,3cplel,JulietxLove,2,Fri Jul 10 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was referring to the Other Discipline exam when I said General Exam. If you don't mind me asking, are you an Arch E that took the Other Discipline Exam?   And thank you for linking that spec sheet. From our mandatory seminars my school has us take and my school advisor's advice, I had gotten the idea that the Other Exam was way too broad for me to want to take and that Civil was the route to go. So I hadn't really even thoroughly looked at that sheet. You linking it made me open it again and now I'm beginning to definitely reconsider it as an option.   If I took the mechanical, http://ncees.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/FE-Mec-CBT-specs.pdf a couple parts from section 10 and a good chunk of 15 were my main concern. But it almost seemed easier to attempt, as the Civil exam has a Hydraulics and Hydrological Systems, and an Environmental Engineering section that would be mostly new to me (and that is what my advisor was saying Arch E's should take).   Once again, reddit advice beats paid advice. I knew I was right in coming here."

I don't like to make too many generalizations, but I think engineering in general has a culture of elitism. It starts with the fact that engineering typically requires a better GPA for acceptance; for that reason, it's easier to transfer out of engineering than into engineering; it makes a lot of money; it uses a lot of math and technical knowledge, both of which are useful for scaring off laypeople; and it's frequently hailed as a progressive and useful field (whereas theater majors are sometimes criticized for ""not contributing to society""). All this encourages engineering students to feel good about themselves, yet they may feel insecure when they realize their classes are difficult and their peers are brilliant, so they belittle other majors to feel better about themselves."
EngineeringStudents,3cqt4h,persipacious,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"Well thank you :)   I do know what you mean though. It really brings me down sometimes. I hate hearing fellow engineering students talk down about, or even sometimes to, other students of different, non-STEM, majors.   I mean, I'm not in this for the money. I know some are but I'm not. I'm doing it because I think it's fun. I want to do it. So why should any of us berate someone else for wanting to read or write and somehow live off of that? Let's just be happy. We all have a role to play in society anyways. We can't all be engineers. Then it'd be way too hard to get a job ;)  One final note:  I am, in fact, capable and guilty of thinking less of other disciplines such as English when I get angry with someone from one of those studies. I did not mean to sound like I was trying to make myself out to be a perfectly passive, peace-loving person. I'm quite imperfect. I think that's pretty normal no matter what you do though. But at the end of the day, who cares?   Sorry, really really boring lunch break.."
EngineeringStudents,3cqt4h,_subvert_,2,Fri Jul 10 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"Of course I identify with that! When I'm stressed, overworked, or just damn proud of what I've accomplished, I love to think that my major is difficult. It makes it feel more rewarding, it makes me feel like the struggle is worth it, that I've worked hard. It's a source of motivation, and there's nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn't lead to a toxic attitude.  I prefer to think of it like this: my major is uniquely difficult. Majoring in economics, english, or biology is also difficult, but in different ways; they will not fully understand my struggles, nor will I understand theirs. When I claim my major is difficult, I am not implying other majors are any less difficult, only that there are struggles specific to my field that I have overcome. It is possible, after all, to be both proud of your own field and respectful of others."

I believe this philosophy sums it up pretty damn well.  You don't have to be a genius to do engineering. You don't have to get all 100% on every test. You just have to be willing to sit down for as long as it freakin' takes to finish that homework assignment. Or to completely understand everything on that test next week (yes--next week. You need to be prepared).  It's not a measure of intelligence, it's a measure of determined-ness."
EngineeringStudents,3cqt4h,acet1,6,Fri Jul 10 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"Is (insert any technical topic here) hard? I feel like this is a question people ask all the time without really thinking about what they mean. What do you mean, ""hard""? It's not ""hard"" to solve a problem when you don't have the proper tools, it's impossible. So go back and learn the proper tools. Is it ""hard"" to do 8-10 hours of schoolwork, between classwork and homework, every day? Maybe, but you never do 8-10 hours of work at once. You can only do it bit by bit, just like everyone else. Yes, you have to make sacrifices, but people make sacrifices all the time for activities which few people would consider ""hard."""
EngineeringStudents,3cqt4h,KurtWagnerX,5,Fri Jul 10 02:04:08 2015 UTC,Hard work and discipline are better predictors of success in engineering than being smart.
EngineeringStudents,3cqt4h,PapaBurgundy69,3,Fri Jul 10 03:45:02 2015 UTC,I second that. in my experience it pays off to fully learn what is taught in class. So as long as you LEARN key concepts you should be fine. Always study after class and do THOUSANDS (not really) of problems. this will reinforce what you have learned. One more thing it helps if you can visualize or imagine how or what youre learning applies to in the real world. I love controls engineering because i can see and imagine its applications.

I honestly didn't take it seriously, I was still in a high school mode by ditching a lot and not studying like I should have. I've always wanted to do engineering, but the math classes were killing me at the time because I wasn't dedicated. I want to go back and 'crush' those classes and prove to myself that I can take them and succeed. A lot of it I guess is just cuz. haha  I've been asking myself a lot of what if's lately about finishing, and I really just want to tackle it again and try something new.

EngineeringStudents,3cpi8k,good_things_come,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go full time unless you're trying to switch careers or something, or if you can somehow keep your current job because the degree is relevant to your job/industry.   I am in a position of doing part time (usually 2 classes) while working full time, but I have no family to worry about. Taking 1 or 2 classes won't kill you, but will severely cut down on your money, free/family time, and flexibility when you're in school, and it will take for-fucking-eveeer to finish an undergrad degree. It can be an odd transition to make as well, as you're sort of reverting to being a student and doing homework and stuff.   Does your job have tuition assistance and would they cover this degree? If so, I would suggest taking advantage of it since you seem to really want to do it. If not, then maybe you can at least meet with an advisor to see what kind of academic path you're in for in both the full time and part time options. The good news is that most (I think) universities will waive all your gen ed credits since you have a degree and you'll only need to worry about the degree credits. I came from a business background as well and it took me about 2 years of math and science agony before I got into the meat of the civil program and things began to settle. I still have about 3 years to go however, even with the amount of credits I was able to bring in.   A lot of people I see in my program are in their 30s or older, so there's no real limit to when you can go back. Save up some money and wait out the wife and you'll be fine."

EngineeringStudents,3coejg,RedBaron91,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:08:28 2015 UTC,It usually requires a lot more research into the specific model you are looking to buy.  Is this model the lemon of the line or actually going to last a long time.  Some years have great models and others have shit.  You cannot be 100% you are getting what you want without much research from a windows laptop.  Since mac's are crazy about quality control it's much faster to determine if that specific release is good or not.  Windows 10 gives me hope but when I started University Vista was king and no way in hell was I touching ME's bastard brother (I had a hell of a time with that OS).
EngineeringStudents,3coejg,HappyNacho,3,Fri Jul 10 05:21:01 2015 UTC,"As long as you have Windows via Bootcamp, you'll be fine. I prefer the *nix environment of OS X for most things, but there are a lot of applications that only run on Windows."

It works well for most day to day things, but I had issues finding a decent SPICE program. It also wouldn't run PowerWorld or Visual Basic so I had to go virtual machine. Also, Microsoft Office is missing some key features on the Mac edition, so I'm building my first PC this summer because I'm tired of dealing with it.  If it was me, I'd look at a Surface Pro. I see lots of people taking notes on it, and you can use it as a laptop with the keyboard cover thing. Otherwise plan on using bootcamp for some apps."

EngineeringStudents,3coejg,HappyNacho,2,Thu Jul 9 17:12:26 2015 UTC,I have one and it's phenomenal.  I would never buy anything else.  Full disclosure I also own an iPhone so the integration (continuity is Apple's name for it) is extremely important for me.  I even own a Mac Pro (the cylindrical ash tray looking guy) for research.    The only issue I have ever had is with Creo.  Creo currently is only supported on Windows.  And by issue I mean I just flopped Creo into a VM on my Mac and it ran better than on people's older Thinkpads.  I believe people telling you it's a pain in the ass don't own Macs.

All you need to do is get the model that comes with an optical drive (if they still make them). Then, remove the optical drive, replace it with a second hard drive and boot camp the computer. This way, one hard drive runs Mac OS and the other runs Windows. Now you can run ANY program you could possibly need.  I can write up some more detailed instructions and provide links, but I'm terminally lazy so I won't unless somebody wants me to."
EngineeringStudents,3coejg,snowsin,3,Thu Jul 9 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"They still make the optical drive Macbook. However is the 13 in model and the specs have not been updated since 2012. So, not worth it. Better just to buy one of the recent models and use a VM or Bootcamp."

EngineeringStudents,3coejg,doyourlabs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"I never thought to do that. I have a feeling that there's going to be issues around both operating systems trying to access the same drive, as apple and microsoft format memory differently. Even if it is technically possible, I would be concerned that it'll glitch somehow and fry something.  The way it worked out for me is that I have a lot of programs and data that I use for research and design projects, which means I needed a high-capacity drive for my windows side, but I don't need to meet those requirements on my mac side. What I ended up doing was installing windows on the HDD and Yosemite on my SSD and it's been working out great.  I store all of my media on an external drive so that I can access it on both operating systems. If I really need to transfer a document or data file from one OS to the other, it's a simple matter of choosing between dropbox, email, google drive or a jump drive."

Everything else you will learn on the job. I am an electrical engineering student (rising senior) and am currently working as an embedded software engineer. Turns out my mentor is also an electrical engineer but whos title is Embedded Software engineer.   I've noticed that it is very useful to be an electrical engineer because you can understand some or most of the concepts behind what you are coding for, such as RF stuff, communication, DSP and the like. A computer engineer will only scratch the surface of those topics if you ask me, but will go more in depth into differnt OS's and digital design.  Also, start an embedded design project. It is very fun the be able to go from picking the hardware and using EE knowledge, to then go and code up the whole system. Quite rewarding! You will learn a lot on the way in turns of how to most efficiently code up a project (interrupts and direct register manipulation). I plan on taking a CPE class or two when I return to school, but ultimately I will graduate as an electrical engineer.  EDIT: On second thought though, I will be very hard to do both hardware and software design in industry I would think. It's usually one or the other unless it is like a startupy type company."

From my experience with dealing with other engineers, those of us EE's have such a better foundation for hardware design while having a decent enough software background that we understand basic software design and concepts. In my opinion, learning to write code on your own is a bit less challenging than learning to design hardware on your own given only a basic understanding of the key attributes of each.   There are, of course, exceptions to each rule. There are plenty of computer engineers who can design awesome pieces of hardware but are mediocre software developers just like there are tons of electrical engineers who can write beautiful code but can't build you a voltage divider."
EngineeringStudents,3cmla4,bricksinthewall,6,Thu Jul 9 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"I am leaning towards staying in EE, but at the same time I find myself more interested in computers in general. It's hard to be specific!"

EngineeringStudents,3cmla4,lowdownporto,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:08:02 2015 UTC,"depends on what kind of embedded systems you want to work with. I studied EE and there were tons of embedded systems related courses and computing related courses. Do you want to do any sort of signal processing? then definately do EE that is a core EE thing, I have spoken to many who work with DSP and they are all EE's. Do you want to do any sort of control systems? then definaltey do EE as linear control systems is an EE course, and is built off of fundamentals covered in EE courses.   I don't know much about comp E courses and what is offered but I would say you can definately go that route with an EE degree. May EE's go into software. Hell I have a coworker who was a physics major and now all he does is software, and he is one of the best programmers I have ever met. So as far as the basic skill of programming you can learn the basics in either EE or comp E and then learn the rest later. you will have to do that because there is no telling what all languages you will end up using in the long run, 10 years from now you may be learning a new proprietary language that isn't even defined yet. and with embedded systems you will have to learn the functions for that specific chip anyways. So my point is go into the program that teaches you the theory and background you want to learn because as far as basic skills of programming you can do that all on your own or in either program."
EngineeringStudents,3cmla4,GodTierEE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:46:31 2015 UTC,"What's dsp, digital signal processing, and how is it ee? Is there hardware involved?"
EngineeringStudents,3cmla4,HadACigar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:12:30 2015 UTC,"well first off of course there is harware involved. But whether or not you are working on hardware designs does not define electrical engineering. The reason DSP is largely taught in EE programs and DSP engineers usually have a background in EE is because the concepts used in EE bassically make many of the foundations for DSP. In my program DSP was an elective but we had a course called ""signals and systems"" which was a required course. In this course you talk about frequency response both phase and magnitude, sampliing theory, regions of convergence for transfer functions laplace transforms Z-transforms, group delay etc. Most of these concepts are used in analog electronics in terms of filters, amplifier stabillity, analog controls etc. And these are the basic fundamentals you need to understand in order to understand DSP. So is DSP Electrical Engineering really? I don't know but the basic fundamentals required before going into DSP definitely is and historically has been developed by EE's so that is why it falls under that realm and into EE programs. There are lots of things that fall into EE programs not because they are working with analog electronics but because EE fundamentals are incredibly applicable to those subjects. And there are many different peices of technology that definately falls under the realm of EE that require DSP knowledge so it is a very useful thing for an EE to know. So there are lots of reasons why it is usually part of EE programs."

EngineeringStudents,3cmla4,sonicSkis,3,Thu Jul 9 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"I graduated as an EE, and currently do embedded systems work.  At my university (mid-tier state school, you should have these opportunities or better) there were quite a few CS and embedded systems classes available as electives to the Engineers.  Focus on learning verilog(edit: or VHDL), and c/c++.  You will also get plenty of coding experience in your other classes, using things like Matlab.  As a straight EE you will be regarded in the professional world as 'a hardware who knows how to code.'  As a CSE, you will be regarded as 'a software guy who can understand hardware.'  Either way, how seriously you are taken in either role will depend more on your first job and subsequent experience rather than what your diploma says.  Tl;dr:  don't sweat it.  For your chosen role, the two are largely interchangeable."

EngineeringStudents,3cmla4,Nyaan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:01:51 2015 UTC,"I've had to translate VHDL example code into Verilog once or twice, they use very similar logic, just different syntax.  Jumping between the two is similar to if you had to jump between, say, C# and Java.    It's worth being familiar with, but 99% of your time will be spent working with one language or the other, since most companies will be locked into one language.  I was told Verilog is more commonly used in the US, but in practice I saw positions for either language being advertised pretty frequently last time I was job hunting."

For me, the major is less important than the projects you work on and a solid understanding of the hardware of several types of microcontrollers. An internship is crucial. This is a field where coursework is definitely not enough. You need the experience on the hardware.   A good microcontrollers class and a good C class are the main coursework you should look for. If you have a project based class, try to find a good embedded project to work on. If it is with a team, try to work on some challenging aspects of the embedded code."

EngineeringStudents,3cmjp9,SuddenMadoka,4,Thu Jul 9 01:53:35 2015 UTC,"Assuming ideal components, you're expecting a sinusoidal motion on everything. For the charge on the capacitor, it's going to be a cosine function. You can prove this with Laplace.  So Q = k cos (wt). Except you were given the amplitude, so you already know the value of k. Use your given condition Q(t=2) = 0 to get omega. Differentiate for the current and you're golden.  For the Laplace proof, acknowledge that these components share voltage and current. So V=L di/dt and i = C dV/dt. Except in this case, put a constant on one of those equations (connecting a charged capacitor to a dormant inductor is the same as connecting a charged inductor to a dormant capacitor)."

EngineeringStudents,3cmjp9,WeEatHipsters,3,Thu Jul 9 02:17:26 2015 UTC,"You would use it to get a numeric answer. You put the circuit into the laplace domain, and then solve for the current, and then do an inverse transform.

I don't know, I haven't tried to work it out yet."

Several companies in my area make a VIP line for students who actively participate in computer clubs or otherwise apply themselves outside their courses. These companies know that students that actively attempt to learn more than they're required to are going to be more motivated and willing to work harder during their work in an internship as well.  Also, you're not going to become a proficient programmer by doing mandatory exercises alone. I graduated a month ago, and looking at my peers, the ones that have spent their weekends fiddling with arduinos (or preferably bare-metal microcontrollers) are way ahead of the ones that spent their spare time playing league of legends or whatever. Even if they put in equal effort during labs and exercises, the difference is mind boggling. I feel like 90% of what I've learned is from my own projects.   Also, it's fun."
EngineeringStudents,3ckbxr,trianguloid,25,Wed Jul 8 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"For Mechanical:  Depends on the program, which classes you've already taken, and whether or not you're specializing in a specific area (Structures/Thermal/Controls). Most of the time, you'll be studying ways to determine how a system will behave under given circumstances, e.g. If I push on this part of a frame with a 1000lb force, will the frame bend? Break? Fall over?   If one end of a pipe stays at 100°F, will the fluid inside cool to 75°F by the time it reaches the end? If not, how much longer should the pipe be?   Mechanical engineering is all about using available information to determine how well a given system will do its job.  TL;DR: Use numbers to describe the behavior of a system."

I feel like a lot of people try to talk up how difficult life is as an engineering student to make themselves sound superior for pushing through it. If you are smart about it, it isn't that bad.  On an average day, I'll wake up and attend the lectures that I feel are worth actually going to. People say its dumb to not go to all of them, but face it, some professors are terrible at teaching and/or difficult to understand. Often I feel I can learn the content more quickly on my own time.  During breaks I'll either work on assignments, eat, or get other school-unrelated errands done. Lectures and labs generally end mid to late afternoon. At this point I go to the gym and have a really good workout (don't underestimate the importance of fitness). Then I come home and maybe cook a good meal (eat healthy!!!), then work on assignments with my friends.   The time spent on assignments varies day to day so I'll either finish a good amount then take the rest of the evening off, or work until I need to go to bed. Getting enough sleep is highly underrated in engineering colleges.   Usually I can get all my assignments done for the week by early Friday so I take the weekend off and go out with my friends.    Saturdays I go to my school's Formula SAE (Where I am a team lead) to work on our car and socialize.   The people who say engineering ruins all other aspects of your life have no concept of time management it would seem. Life isn't that bad if you are responsible."

It's still possible to manage, obviously, but it becomes far easier to get caught in a shitslide and become overwhelmed.

We had projects due every semester. Still had to do the math and prove to the professor that the project would work before we made it (aka the theory part) but then we had to make it and test it to make sure the practical matched the theory.

EngineeringStudents,3ckbxr,yosimba2000,2,Wed Jul 8 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"Industrial Engineering as a whole seems more about management, controls, manufacturing, supply chains, economics and human factors. I believe there is a lot of statistics. (Please correct me as I am an ignorant ME)  Mechanical tends to involve more directly physical studies, like material science, design, physics (thermodynamics, fluids, statics etc). Plenty of math to be had in both.  Your first two years will be things like Physics, Chemistry, Thermodynamics, Calculus I-III, and gen eds. Junior and senior courses are more specific like Machine Assembly Design, Heat Transfer, Material Science, Fluids, etc. but in reality your ACTUAL workload is all in the projects. Design projects, presentations, hours spent in the lab and machine shop.  As for a typical day, my school's engineering classes are almost all in the morning. So I wake up around 6, get breakfast and get to class around 8. Classes are usually out by 1-2 barring labs so I get lunch and stay on campus doing homework/projects in a computer lab until I feel satisfied with my day's progress. That usually goes until dinner unless I have a big project deadline. After that, I go home and drink away my troubles. This co-op could not have come sooner."

EngineeringStudents,3ckbxr,EagleEyeInTheSky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:01:46 2015 UTC,What is being an aerospace engineer  student like?
EngineeringStudents,3ckbxr,Killsranq,3,Wed Jul 8 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"For some schools it's very similar to mechanical engineering. Some Aerospace programs are just mechanical engineering with a few specialized 400 level classes.  In my program, the first two years I took about five classes a quarter. One or two of them every quarter would be Aerospace specific. These lower division ARO classes are mostly a lecture/lab mix, so one or two times a week we'd meet in a lab for about three hours. For me, these classes covered Aeronautics, Astronautics, Propulsions, Structures, Signals Processing, and Systems Engineering. I'd also take one or two support classes a day. Many of those support classes had their own lab section. My department was the weird one that had hybrid classes. On average I'd spend about four hours in class. On a good day I'd spend two or three hours on homework. On bad days I'd spend up to eight hours on homework, but I tried to schedule that on a Saturday or Friday if I could. You always get at least a week's worth of warning on assignments so scheduling was easy to do once I got in the habit of it. I would usually spend my homework hours in the library or in one of the department computer labs, because it was usually difficult for me to be productive at home. I'd have two or three large class projects a quarter.  Later in my degree, there's way less formal labs, but I have way more extracurricular projects going on, so I have key card access to a handful of labs 24 hours a day. The homework has become way easier to handle both because I'm much more mature and because I'm seeing a different group of professors that prefers teaching higher division courses and don't like to do a lot of the hand holdy assignments like in the lower division courses and in high school. The material is way harder, but it clicks faster and you start to see connections between stuff that you wouldn't believe is connected. For example, recently for a Quantum Physics class I'm taking for a minor, I realized that analyzing particle wave functions was extremely similar to modeling bounded vibrating systems in a Vibrations course I took. I got an A- in Quantum Physics because I was already familiar with the math involved. About half of the week I focus on my formal classes. I don't normally spend all week on my assignments anymore. The problem is the other half of the week I spend 8-14 hours in the lab having a ""work day"" for one of my projects. Which is fine because I really enjoy my extracurriculars way more than my formal school work.  My written homework is usually extensive enough that I don't need to actually sit down and study more than once or twice per quarter. Your studying is just doing homework problems and seeing how trends and behaviors work out in the math. I don't ever actually sit down and read chapter x.  Aerospace as a major is pretty broad compared to something like Mechanical or Electrical. We don't spend as much time on manufacturing as a mechanical engineer would, and not as much time spent on circuits like an electrical engineer, but it is pretty cool being able to wear multiple hats during a project from systems engineer to project manager to programmer to dynamicist to structures."

I find that Junior year is by far the hardest year out of all your 4 years. I am going to be taking Fluid Mechanics, Physics II w/lab, Mechanical Design course (learn about linkages and using Solidworks for motion study), I have a class that deals with using MATLAB called Math Methods. There aren't many classes, but the work will add up. You just need to learn how to balance time. Should you really be playing video games right now or should you be studying for a strength of materials exam? I would suggest buying a planner or using some kind of app that will help you organize. I personally have a surface pro 3, but I still use an organizer because writing something down with a pen or pencil helps me remember better. You will have nights where you might be up late, but those shouldn't happen too often. When you have group projects, not everyone works at the same rate as you do so find good groups and work with them. No sense in wasting time with people that don't have a good work ethic."
EngineeringStudents,3cooj6,subliminalthoughts31,4,Thu Jul 9 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"Take a look at how a two stroke differs from a four stroke. One has a distinct exhaust stoke, the other is an integrated intake/exhaust stroke that will always spew out some unspent fuel that was coming in from the intake. Also keep in mind two strokes need to have lubricating oil in the fuel stream so I suggest you look up the average combustion efficiency of a two stroke versus a four stroke. You will most likely find a four stroke is slightly higher."

It's gotten me 6 interviews out of the 7 I applied for and I got 5 offers. Oh and bring more with you for the interview. It's much easier to talk about your projects than answer cookie cutter questions and will leave a better impression. My GPA is only 3.1 by the way. Though many places have a 3.0 cutoff.
EngineeringStudents,3ckdoo,Se7ensins20,4,Wed Jul 8 18:14:25 2015 UTC,Can I ask you what kind of pictures you've included? Are they CAD drawings or pictures of things you built? How did you integrate them into your text? Thanks! :)
EngineeringStudents,3ckdoo,Se7ensins20,3,Wed Jul 8 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"Cad drawings mostly but also projects I've done. Basically in your cover letter write a paragraph about how one or two of them gave you experience doing a certain thing. I wouldn't include more than that in the cover letter. Put the picture or two at the bottom of the page and a paragraph for each in the body. Then bring a portfolio with you for the interview and when they ask about the projects you have on your resume you have pictures to back it up and talk about it. Use them as segues to some smaller things that maybe don't make your resume. One you get them talking about you're projects and you have pictures to show them it's very easy to keep them focused on that rather than the ""tell me about a time when"" crap that they forget almost immediately because it's typically a canned answers.

EngineeringStudents,3ckdoo,DrSloan,2,Wed Jul 8 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"Should you include a project portfolio when applying? Absolutely! Why? Companies love to see you project work, especially in technical interviews. It'll also really help you out in phone interviews where its hard to explain things in words.   I'm also a mechanical student. Recently I applied to two companies for co-ops this fall and had offers from both and accepted one. One company had a 3 stage interview process and I pretty much talked about my project portfolio the whole time. They were really interested to hear about my projects.   So, what can you do? I made mine in PowerPoint. Landscape. Turned out well enough. I included SolidWorks models, pictures of me machining parts, and pictures of the final product. I gave the project a scope, what my role was, and timeline.   You can also set up a Google Drive folder and add other material to that as well. I included electrical circuits I soldered, Python code, 3D PDFs (yes, they exist) made with SolidWorks, lab notes, etc. Include anything you're proud to show off. Why include all this? If the company has a good sense of the quality of work you put out, they'll feel more certain in their choice in hiring you.   After you include all this, prepare to talk about it a lot and know everything about your projects. They'll love to pick your brain about your technical considerations in your designs.   What else? Make sure your cover letter is tailored to the job. Have strong opening and closing paragraphs. How can you make the middle easy to write? Bullet points. Yep, bullet points. Does the company want SolidWorks experience? Well then you have ""• SolidWorks experience - blah blah"". You can literally copy and past their qualifications from the posting, but clean them up if they're too long. After my co-op advisor suggested this method for cover letters, it has been super easy to make tailored cover letters.   Hope this helps."
EngineeringStudents,3ckdoo,dragoneye,2,Wed Jul 8 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"I work for a company that hires co-ops primarily from UVic and UBC, so hopefully I can give a bit of insight into the job market you are applying to (I don't do the co-op hiring though). The fall term is probably the easiest to get a job in, since the competition from UBC is mostly students that have just graduated 2nd year, and are looking for their first or second co-op. This indicates to me that you may have something wrong with your resume and/or you aren't standing out from the other resumes.  Have you double and triple checked that there are no spelling and grammar errors? Many HR departments will throw out your resume if they see those errors. Next, how are you standing out from the other students you are competing with? If your grades aren't good, then you need to highlight how you have more experience than the other students. Make sure you are using accomplishment statements, including specific numbers where possible. Are you available for only 4 months? Most companies preferentially choose 8 month co-ops over 4 month ones as your first 1-2 months are mostly just getting up to speed about how the company works.  As for a portfolio, it certainly shouldn't hurt. I bring one when I go to interviews to show what I'm talking about.

When two metals are submerged in an electrolyte, while also electrically connected by some external conductor, the less noble (base) will experience galvanic corrosion. The rate of corrosion is determined by the electrolyte and the difference in nobility. The difference can be measured as a difference in voltage potential: the less noble metal is the one with a lower (that is, more negative) electrode potential than the nobler one, and will function as the anode (electron or anion attractor) within the electrolyte device functioning as described above (a galvanic cell).

I am also taking the F.E. tomorrow so good luck!!!    3) D - 106 http://www.rel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/236_pump-install.gif  5) A  changing from paved increased the runoff coefficient  design rainfall doesn't change (rain from sky - constant) peak discharge doesn't change
EngineeringStudents,3cltxf,HaiImBRIAN,2,Thu Jul 9 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"Adding paving increases imperviousness which generates more runoff, thus the peak discharge increases so III must also be correct. In addition, there's a difference between design rainfall intensity and actual rainfall intensity. The design rainfall intensity, if using the Rational Method, is based on the drainage area's time of concentration. Increasing imperviousness usually leads to a reduction in tc values which subsequently drives up the design rainfall intensity. In real life, the rainfall is independent of land cover, but for design purposes it has an influence. So I think all 3 answer choices are correct."
EngineeringStudents,3cltxf,txhusky17,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"1). I don't remember redox too well, can't help you there.  2). It's a streeter-phelps equation problem. Equation should be in the environmental section of your FE exam booklet. The deoxygenation rate constant is k1 and the reaeration constant is k2. You'll solve for the critical DO deficit and then subtract that number from the saturated DO level to find your minimum concentration.  3). It's the difference between the static water level in the lake and in the tank, which is 106 ft. Pipe center line and ground level don't matter.   4). You have enough information to solve for the headloss in AB and AC. Headloss at any junction should be the same regardless of the path you take, otherwise you would have discontinuity. So headloss in CB will be the difference between the headloss in AB and AC.  5). I'm confused by this one. It's a rational method problem (Q= ciA). A parking lot will have a higher run-off coefficient. Rainfall stays the same. But higher run-off coefficient (c) results in higher discharge (Q), so it seems like I and III should both be true and II is false."

I also found a CC in New York that is offering it also. I applied as a non degree seeking student and got an email immediately that said I could register immediately. I did because I saw they only offered one section and it had 10/20 people signed up already. I don't have to pay until September though so I'm just going to hold my spot until further notice...$1700 for out of state tuition on one 4 credit class. Yikes.

If it takes longer and more effort to understand and do well, you'll have less time. You can have free time, I had plenty and I was in Greek life, worked, and was an RA.  I would say don't join everything first semester, especially Greek life. Get an idea of how you'll succeed, and for greek life take a semester to find the right org for you."
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,ergonomickeyboard,4,Wed Jul 8 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"This is definitely true. Workload will vary a lot by individual. Some people can just sit down, read a question, and pound it out just like that. Meanwhile, others take a lot of time to wrap their heads around the concepts and problems.

EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,Szos,4,Wed Jul 8 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"A typical day is impossible to create because it's different for everyone since nobody has the same class schedule.    In terms of free time, you'll have plenty of time between classes and over the weekend to do everything (again this is only true if you have a decent workload, which varies by college and what classes you sign up for)  I would say however, that most engineers only have time for 1 or 2 outside activities tops, usually a frat, design team, or club sport. For example, I devote huge amounts of time during the week to rugby (practice, gym, team functions, etc), so my life is basically rugby and schoolwork, with a little Netflix time on the weekends when I'm procrastinating.   The best thing is to accept that whatever organization you join will be where you spend most of your free time so you should enjoy it. This is more important than most people realize because engineering IS a lot of work, so picking an extracurricular activity will help break up the monotony of studying while allowing you to save time on making friends.   TLDR: Joining a club or two is fine, but just don't go overboard or you will definitely have no free time. Having an extracurricular is really important for engineers because you need an out from the anxieties of studying  TLDR TLDR: Yes you have free time"
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,karen62,16,Wed Jul 8 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on if you're working or not.  If you're not working, you'll have plenty of free time.  You generally get one assignment per class per week.  Each assignment will take about two hours.  So, really, if you plan out your work - or just do it all on Sunday night like I did - your week will be pretty open.  Exam times or big project times will be hectic, but generally speaking, the homework isn't so much.  Now, if you have to work a 4:30pm - 2am pizza delivery job after your classes, well, good luck with that.  I don't even know how that's possible.  :("
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,Goins2754,28,Wed Jul 8 13:57:46 2015 UTC,"One assignment per class per week that takes two hours?? I don't think so... Generally, 1 hr of class time equates to 2-4 hours of homework. Two hours of system dynamics homework is usually setting up a problem to solve."

EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,Bluffz2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"US schools usually follow a 1 chapter/week progression and there's usually an assignment for each chapter.  A chapter assignment is usually 5-10 problems based on that chapter.  You can, of course, study as much or as little as you want; I'm only talking about homeworks.  And don't take this the wrong way, but if you need to study 8-10 hours every day, you might want to change your study method.  60 hours of study per week is entirely too much - even for a full 18 credit semester."
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,Goins2754,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, when we started studying our faculty advisor suggested to all engineering freshmen that we'd study atleast 60 hours a week.

I often have lab projects, assignments, and exams all for the same course lining up within the same week. Most assignments take 20+ hours and lab projects can easily take 60+. I often don't even study for most of my exams except cramming the night before or maybe the morning."
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,Avedas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"No, I'm a graduate student, but I'm posting about my undergraduate days.  And I'm highly skeptical that your homework assignments take 20+ hours each and your labs take 60+ hours each.  That's just silly.  Do you really need 60 hours to write about how an egg floats in salt water or how cars with magnetic bumpers collide?  I would challenge you to post an example homework assignment that takes 20+ hours, as well.  That number seems highly embellished.  I don't think I spent more than 6 hours on any one assignment in my entire undergraduate days - and that was only because I had skipped a day and hadn't read the material yet or it was particularly tedious (mechanics of materials cones to mind when we had to derive deflection equations using differential equations and conditions of continuity).  Now, there are term projects that usually take days - way more than 60+ hours, even.  But that's not within the scope of ""weekly homework"" and I made mention of those in my OP."
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,Goins2754,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:06:36 2015 UTC,"Here you go. This one was probably closer to 40 hours if I remember correctly. It says ""Lab Assignment"" but all of our assignments required the lab to complete them so that's just what they were labeled. Naturally these are unscheduled lab times available 24/7 to complete coursework. The difficulty of this assignment wasn't too high but the amount of work required to complete it was fairly substantial. I have plenty more like it, although I'm not sure how many assignment PDFs I have saved in my repository. I usually just save exams.  Anyway this is indicative of an average upper level engineering assignment at my school. Some are a bit easier and many are far more difficult. The format of ""here's a short list of textbook problems to work through"" was pretty much gone after freshman math and physics."
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,Avedas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:08:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I understand very little of that.  Is that computer or electrical engineering?  I'm a structural engineering major.  That assignment says at the bottom, ""this assignment contains sample programs exactly like...""  Why is it not as easy as copying those sample programs, modifying them for the lab, and then inputting your data?  I've been to two universities, both in top 50 ranking in the U.S., and I've never had a lab that didn't completely hold a students hand.  Physics I might have been the hardest only because the discussion section of the lab asked some critical thinking questions, but honestly, most everything else was copy-pasta:  ""here's your lab manual, copy this exact format, input your data, use the proper equations from the relevant chapter in the textbook, discuss the results.""  My soils lab, even, was designed by Dr Krishna Reddy, one of the most famous geotechnical professors in the world and one of the more demanding professors at UIC and his manual is used worldwide, yet even it was a step-by-step lab process.  You can see it here:  http://www.uic.edu/classes/cemm/cemmlab/  I just don't buy that your labs take 60+ hours - even with formatting and data entry, it shouldn't take more than 10-20 hours at an absolute max for the most tedious and difficult labs."

Ask your classmates for help before you go see the professor.   I think people just like to humble brag about how much time they spend studying."
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,theloneliestgirlincs,2,Wed Jul 8 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on how heavy your courseload is for the semester. Some classes might not assign homework that is too time-consuming, others you may find yourself spending several hours per week doing work for. And exam weeks will definitely crunch your time pretty hard.  However, you will still find free time to do other things besides study. It might be difficult to do this for some weeks, but in general, if you manage your time well you will have time for clubs, greek life, sports events, etc."

EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,SoDel302,2,Wed Jul 8 14:02:35 2015 UTC,"It depends on the school. Some classes don't take a lot of time, and then there are others that take a significant amount of time and do not give you a comparable course credit.  But if you work hard and focus and don't procrastinate, then you will have free time. Consider studying NOW over the summer. Buy/download the books, send the professors an email and request the syllabus as well as homework that was done the previous year, and study. I cannot stress how helpful this is."

My typical day was classes until ~4:30pm (MWF) or ~12pm (TTh), and then I probably studied/worked for ~4 hours. After that I had free time. During pledging, it becomes a little harder to manage time. Most of my free time was dedicated to the fraternity."
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,r42xer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you manage your time and how much coursework you have. Everything is a trade off, if you want time to do one thing it will normally involve a trade off in time elsewhere. In most cases that elsewhere is sleep"

I'll be graduating this year, I've worked at my job about 20-30 hours a week every semester, and there hasn't been a single semester where I didn't have plenty of time to goof off. I've had time for Netflix marathons, school clubs, spending time with friends, hitting up the bars, dating, video games, etc. There will be days where you don't have free time, maybe even a few back to back, but you don't need to become a hermit to study engineering."

EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,micky_serendipity,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:21:13 2015 UTC,Just depends on your school. I get by with rarely studying but it might be because I have a predisposition to liking the material. The only time I've studied past midnight is for dynamics. I think I study about 4 hrs a week on average.   I've never scored below a B- and I'm in my senior year.
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,angryguywalking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:43:34 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how efficiently you complete the required stuff (homework and studying) and how busy you choose to be with extracurriculars or work.  In my experience joining greek life and clubs is a great idea because you will make friends in your major and that is invaluable. There are lot of ways to make your class load easier on yourself, and having friends to work with is a big one. Engineering relevant clubs (or even non-relevant clubs can work too) are good for your resume and will help you meet people in your major.  If you find help and use your time well, you should have a good chunk of additional free time. Now if you fill that with a work schedule or get very involved with a project (10-20 hrs a week), the free time starts getting a bit lost. Also, in my experience the workload can be very variable. Early in the quarter, workload isn't usually too bad with just homework and early projects. Midterm season can be pretty bad and I generally will have a weekend or two where I am studying for three tests and have no time. Before finals is the same way.  That said, I still have free time on weekends, I work 15+ hours weekly on a club I'm heavily involved with and I still am spending reasonable time on classwork."

EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,sirgos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:58:27 2015 UTC,Its different for everyone and it also depends on the classes you're taking. Last semester for me was pretty breezy but this semester seems like its wrapping up to be a 9-5 everyday at Uni. I really only get the Winter break off as I intern over summer as well.
EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,odlawodlaw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on your time management skills.  I work about 15 hours a week and spend 5-6 hours a week exercising, get a full 8 hours of sleep and have a 1 hour commute one way.  I go skiing for the weekend every now and then too.    If you sit in class and do nothing but pay attention and ignore your phone, and you do your assignments as soon as you get them and not the night before (DO NOT procrastinate just because everyone else says they do) then there is no reason whatsoever you can't have any free time.  It's critical you go over your notes when you get home every evening before starting assignments and whether or not you have assignments.  This will make your life easier during midterms/finals.  School will certainly be your largest time commitment if you want to get good grades.  Priorities first, fun after, and you'll have more than enough free time."

Work hard during the week and then you can enjoy your free time most weekends. The time of your classes can also be a factor.

EngineeringStudents,3cju0u,titanicmango,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"I worked a full time job during undergrad and I feel like I still had plenty of free time for hobbies. The best favor you can do yourself is to start early on anything. Read chapters 1 and 2 of your textbooks before the semester starts. When you receive an assignment, start the day it is assigned even if all you do is read over the problems and make a mental checklist of where you might find similar problems. Start exam study 1-1.5 weeks in advance. I did this throughout undergrad and I rarely needed to rush anything and I don't think I studied at all the day before most exams except for a few times when there was a lot going on.   What I think is more important is that during freshman year, go way overboard on studying. If you think you have something down, keep going anyways. After freshman year you will be a better judge of your abilities and will be able to make an educated call on when you need to study less or more, but for freshman year you should over-prepare for everything. Freshman year is what trips up many students (myself included, I failed my freshman year because I under-estimated the difficulty and over-estimated my abilities).   Also: it's not a race. Don't be afraid to take 5 or even 6 years if it makes your courses more manageable. You don't need to graduate in 4 years and you'll only be doing yourself a favor by slowing things down. It took me 10 years to finish undergrad, although I wouldn't recommend taking quite that long."

I don't know if you need a minor in GIS but a class or two may be useful for you if you're interested in it.  I know the environmental engineers at my company use it often and I think it's a good skill to have on your resume.  Check your Civil Engineering department's classes. They may offer a GIS class specifically for Civil Engineers like mine did. In the future, as an environmental engineer you may be doing some field work so I'd suggest learning about some mobile GIS capabilities like ESRI's Data Collector app once you get your feet wet with the program."

I was able to work about 15 hours a week while taking 5 engineering classes. I could've done more if I wanted to give up my weekends but I liked being able to spend time with my friends and get my schoolwork sorted. Plus I was more sustaining things that I did rather than new development.   It also sounds like you'll have a ton of responsibility here, and that can be exceedingly stressful.

Quite frankly if the company doesn't manage to get some hired in the next few months I don't know what will happen. I am just bidding the company more time, but my experience is nothing compared to either of the guys who left.   I highly recommend seeing about at minimum decreasing the hours.   How many hours would you recommend? They gave 30 as a ballpark number.

Sophomore year classes (depending on the program and school) can be pretty tough since it's almost always brand new to everyone and is a lot of getting used to concepts that are usually skimmed over in junior/senior year. Check your classes and see what past students have said about them to decide better

What is important is not memorizing the integrals (and there's a bunch) but understanding where they come from and what it means to take an anti-derivative.   Calc 2 has more topics (iirc), and they all work together. taylor series is kinda like an integral and then you manipulate taylor series by differentiating and taking the anti-derivative.   My school posted every exam for the last few years. See if your school does the same. Sitting down a week before the test, taking the ""test"" and then meeting with a TA on how to work is incredibly helpful."

EngineeringStudents,3cmejz,ThexRuminator,2,Thu Jul 9 04:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah Calc 2 is harder, honestly because it's more abstract. Physics shouldn't be bad if you have a good grasp on integration/derivations and their actual meanings (rates, slopes, etc).   Going in - don't expect it to instantly ""click"". Even if you never had to study in high school, this is a different ball game. It's gonna be hard - but it IS doable. You don't have to be smart; just be persistent!  Also invest in a good graphing calculator. And learn how to use wolfram alpha."
EngineeringStudents,3cmejz,mnk88,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:26 2015 UTC,What do you mean by abstract? I've heard it can be more of a creative process to get the answer.

EngineeringStudents,3cmejz,mnk88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"Abstract in that you take it to multivariable calculus, differentiating in both x and y, maybe z (but that might be calc 3). When I took calc 2, a huge part of the course was series/algorithm type stuff, you have to play with the equations to get something useful out.   For the love of all that is good - pay attention to Polar Coordinates in calc 2! By the time you're a junior, about half the world is in polar coordinates - lots of stuff spin, and you'll thank yourself.   And your calculator sounds just great :D"

Show you are doing things besides just school with your time.  What are you doing with your summer? You should be able to talk about what you did with your summers especially summer before junior and senior years. Even if it's being a camp counselor.  Put effort into your application essays. Start working on them early on, write a couple different attempts on different subjects until you have something that feels right. College counselors and (smart) parents can be helpful in finding inspiration and reading them over.  It's way too easy to put off applications and not really care too much.

Unless you go into diff-eqs, which isn't part of calc 2 anyways, it's just basic calculus you should learn either before you get to that content (concurrently) or would be useful to know in advance to make things easier (pre-req).   The only reasoning behind it would be purely arbitrary, so the school doesn't have to worry about offering it to as many students at one time by limiting those who can enroll in it, or because they arbitrarily decide to use more complex integrals for no reason other than to make the material more difficult with no added benefit, if anything, this practice would only be more confusing as the students are focusing on the math rather than the physics concepts."

The engineers at my school are mostly normal, or at least the social ones who are the ones I actually talk to. There's a pretty good sense of community and camaraderie since we all know how screwed we are and that we're all in it together, often helping each other out. Then again, anyone in a STEM major in my school is going through absolute hell anyway and there's no time for gloating."

When hanging with my music major friends, they really remind me of days of  high school drama past. I can rant about how much there's a difference in common sense between the groups, but that's a topic for another day."

EngineeringStudents,3ckrbd,yosimba2000,-10,Fri Jul 10 01:00:24 2015 UTC,Being an engineer requires a certain confidence.  You don't get through it being wishy washy about most things.  It also requires a shit ton of work to earn and is something you are proud of.  I guess that can be egotistical.  No fucks are given.

The good news is it's never too late to make the decision to pursue what really interests you.  Other good news: if you graduated from an accredited program, there is a good chance that a chunk of classes you have already taken could be applied to your degree and cut down the time needed to graduate. Talk with advisors at the colleges which interest you to verify.  Also ask the advisors about scholarship opportunities, and fill out the FAFSA to see what you qualify for. But mostly, apply for scholarships. All of them. Apply for them even if you don't think you would ever get them. Apply for them every semester of every year you have to go to school (as new ones come up often) and make it a goal to try and pay for most (if not all) of your education through scholarships."
EngineeringStudents,3chcna,tjmiller88,25,Tue Jul 7 22:32:11 2015 UTC,I've never understood why people are so obsessive about notes. I look at my notes almost never. I treat in class notes as if they are just practice problems. I basically just take them so I'm engaged with the lecture. Once the lecture is over I don't touch my notes unless I am having a really difficult time with a homework problem and I remember going over something similar in class. Practice/homework problems are so much better for learning the material. I'm pulling pretty good grades so it's pretty effective for me. Other strategies probably work better for other people.
EngineeringStudents,3chcna,Undercover_brosefer,3,Wed Jul 8 05:24:37 2015 UTC,"Nice. That'll work too as long as you're super disciplined about making sure you understand ""why"" you're doing what you're doing when you solve problems. I think a trap a lot of us fall into sometimes is that we go through and mechanically solve HW problems, but then when the prof throws us a curveball on the exam we don't know how to handle it because we don't have the conceptual understanding to be able to adjust on the fly."

Then I forget how to do that and the rest is history."
EngineeringStudents,3chcna,zacharythefirst,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:34:47 2015 UTC,I do the same thing. A lot of my friends think I'm crazy because I never look back on my notes unless I have to. Glad I'm not the only one!
EngineeringStudents,3chcna,Pineapple26,23,Wed Jul 8 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: I was obsessive about taking super-organized and detailed notes (because I thought it was the ""right"" thing to do to do well) at the expense of actually learning the material. Instead: (1) just focus on getting the important stuff down, (2) organize it all into a 1-sheet summary each week, (3) organize it all into a 1-sheet summary before each exam. This post details exactly what to do."
EngineeringStudents,3chcna,Blu3Army73,6,Tue Jul 7 22:37:23 2015 UTC,This worked well in highschool. I found way too much content in university for a 1 sheet summary. I still do similar study things though

You can keep a Prezi very simple and let the frames become your ally.  Here's a real life example from David Epstein about the evolution of athletes. Notice how so simple and minimalistic each Prezi frame is. Not many words, subtle animations, symbolic pictures.

Do whatever you think you will like better, and if you try hard, do well in your classes and get involved in design teams and internships, you will not have a problem finding a job that you like.   The problem is for all those people who don't study and then act like its okay when they get bad grades because ""our curriculum is harder so we are better than them anyway"". Aerospace is conceptually more difficult than civil and is more narrow-focused, but both have exceptional jobs if you take the time to distinguish yourself from your classmates. Aerospace has fewer careers for graduates, but generally the jobs pay more when you do get them.  Aerospace has a lot of very intensive mechanical courses which require knowledge of certain aerodynamic and deformation behaviours well beyond the scope of any other engineering discipline at the undergraduate level. Civil, if you focus on structures, particularly advanced behaviors like earthquake and aerodynamic forces and flutter, can be very difficult too, but there are avenues of study which are far less intensive, such as land development and transportation engineering."

EngineeringStudents,3cjeo8,lmg6841,9,Wed Jul 8 21:33:42 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am an aerospace engineering grad student who also studied aerospace in undergrad.    Career Prospects  I will begin by saying that either path that you choose, aerospace or civil, will present you with job opportunities so long as you take your courses seriously and are proactive in securing internships while in undergrad. I graduated undergrad May 2014 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and all of the classmates that I have kept touch with have secured jobs in the field. Many of these individuals had jobs lined up before graduation, and those that did not secured positions within 3-6 months of graduation. I know several Civil engineers as well and the same is true.  With that said, you have to think about which field has jobs/problems that you are interested in. Personally, I chose Aerospace because I think airplanes and spacecraft are exciting; they have interesting design problems that often test boundaries on many fronts (structural, material, propulsion, control) simultaneously. I'm sure that there is a Civil Engineer around that could make an analogous argument.   Courses/Studies  With regard for classes, I can only speak to my experience in aero; I do not pretend to have any knowledge of civil engineering courses. In a standard aerospace engineering curriculum you will take a myriad of courses that introduce you to the many areas of specialization in aircraft/spacecraft design. Here is a brief list of some standard courses in an aerospace curriculum:   Aerodynamics Propulsion Structures Aircraft or Spacecraft Dynamics Control Theory Information Systems (or some related programming course) Electronics and Avionics Linear Algebra Aircraft or Spacecraft Design   Not really sure how these stack up in terms of difficulty against civil engineering. Like any discipline some courses are harder than others. Which courses these are is institution and professor dependent.  Post Grad -- Specialization  In one final section, I would like to add that undergraduate aerospace, while sufficient to get you a job in the industry is not truly sufficient to develop any sort of specialization in the field. My overall feeling at the end of an aerospace undergad is that we never really spent enough time on any one topic. Instead you learn a spread of information pertaining to aircraft design and then it is up to you to find a job that will help you specialize in the area that interests you. This is probably true of most fields, but I feel that a Master's degree is often required in aerospace to even be considered for some jobs (i.e. control) and to distinguish yourself from the rest.      Edit: I should also specify that I am speaking from the perspective of a US citizen studying domestically. Job prospects in aerospace industry are much more limited if you are not a US citizen seeking employment in the US, since a large portion of positions are supported by defense contracts."
EngineeringStudents,3cjeo8,berwyn_urine,7,Wed Jul 8 14:15:38 2015 UTC,"Civil engineering has ~9 specialty areas, and each one is very different. Structural, Geotechnical, geomatics, transportation, materials, architectural, etc. Some practically require master degrees.   That being said, I doubt that civils will earn more than an aero, though I've heard that it is more difficult to get aero jobs. A lot of civils work on government projects, and while the government will throw money at the DoD, they're pretty stingy about funding infrastructure."

Keep in mind that aeronautical is extremely difficult as well and if you don't have a real passion for aviation as well as having a very strong grounding in maths/physics you're going to struggle.  That said...if you're passionate about it you're going to enjoy your life way more than if you just do civil for the money. If you're in a country with an actual aerospace industry as well (basically UK/US/Canada) then don't feel too discouraged. Remember that you can always go into another engineering related field or even something business related if the job situation isn't looking too crash-hot, a lot of the skills you'll get from an undergrad degree are more geared towards analytical thinking and problem solving rather than technical expertise (that's saved for your masters)."

But for the sake of answering your question unbiasedly, if you're into looking at numbers/statistics, the National Bureau of Labor Statistics has civil engineering as one of the fastest growing fields second to computer science if I recall correctly.  According to the NBLS there's a lot more jobs available for civilEs than for AeroEs (pretty much what other people have said on this thread).  On the other hand, the median pay an aero engineer makes is like 25k higher than what a civilE makes.    I'd link the sites but I'm on mobile and I'm sure you can google them yourself.

EngineeringStudents,3ciikz,Barncheetah,12,Wed Jul 8 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"First off, don't come across pretending to know more than you do (I did this, don't do it, they can tell).  Express why you are interested in getting involved in research and be sincere about this. Is it graduate school? Curiosity? Whatever it is, state it briefly. Then state why its his/her research that attracted you to that professor in particular. Explain that you're a student dedicated to learning, and you're not just there because your parents told you to. In whatever order you do this, it just lets them know you're not there to fuck around.  After that just ask whatever questions you have and what kind of research they do. The explanation will get hairy because its research, you're an undergrad, and it's bio med research. But just keep asking questions (""yo, doctor professor dude, like, you conduct all these studies, but what are the applications?""). But keep in mind some professors love to talk, go off on tangents, talk about random conferences they've been to, what have you. I've honestly had an hour and a half long meeting with a professor where the guy just never stopped and I just sat there listening.  At some point you have to go in for the kill: ""so what kind of opportunities are there in your research/labs for undergraduates?"" Or any variation of that considering that undergraduate research positions have already been established.   But all this is just my own personal method for asking favors from professors whether it be undergrad research, faculty recommendations or project sponsorship. I ain't no interview guru, but its worked for me. Take a listen to what others have to say as well.  And for sake of all undergraduates everywhere, stay professional. Treat it like an interview (but formal clothing may not be necessary). I'd recommend not acting as if you've already got the gig."

Show him that you not only know what his research is but that you've done personal homework on the topic itself and that this is something you find fascinating. That's the kind of people professors want doing research for them.  I thought the whole process of becoming a researcher would be a lot more complex, but when I interviewed it basically went like this:  Prof: Do you know about this lab?  Me: This is X lab. You guys do work in Y.  Prof: Do you know about this area of study?  Me: Yes, that is Z.  Prof: We have a position related to Z doing work in Y in X lab. You'll be here over the Summer and you did well in my class. Would you be interested?  Me: Sure!  Obviously Y and Z were long explanations, but I was just simplifying it. As long as you're clear from the beginning about what you're interested in and show this professor that you're serious about it, you'll probably do great. Good luck!"

If you're learning something on your own don't learn Calculus though, just wait until you learn it in class. Learn something more related specifically to your major  or another related field (read upper-year textbooks), or how to use some sort of software or programming language. This might help you get an internship next summer or help you get a research position with a prof during the year. If the upper-year material uses any calc 3 concepts, just learn whatever's required as you go. This method will be a lot more useful and more interesting than rote-studying calc 3."
EngineeringStudents,3clmzk,Avedas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:58:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the chances of actually getting hired for an internship/co-op after your first year are incredibly low because you have no actual skills and you're competing against senior level students who have previous work experience, projects, and applicable skills in many areas.

EngineeringStudents,3cho0h,rogerrrr,7,Wed Jul 8 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"Hey that's what I did last summer. But in a research lab. But it was some high level research so my knowledge of the topic was zero. So I didn't have any project. So I was basically an errand boy, shit sucked. Basically counted tools, labeled stuff, picked up packages and ordered parts (also as someone just finishing his sophomore year). But again, university research lab, not industry internship.  But there were a few weeks where I did find myself occupied. Do they have any broken electronics there? I found an electronic measurement device that wasn't working, spent a few weeks looking at schematics and testing the thing. With an oscilloscope, soldering iron and plenty of shrink wrap, I ended up fixing the thing. Then I became the electronics debugger and fixed a few more things until summer ran out. Ended up saving the lab a few hundred bucks and spared someone the work of having to replace the devices.  But this was a university research lab, so I don't know if you'll have the free time and resources to tinker with stuff laying around your work area.  What you're doing is just a summer internship, just enjoy the cash, try to enjoy yourself as much as you can, and exploit the shit out of the experience by using inflated words on your resume. It should lead to getting a better experience next summer (more experience on the resume) and its not a reflection of the work you will actually be doing as an engineer."
EngineeringStudents,3cho0h,mr_crabs_tits,5,Wed Jul 8 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar position, but not as bad, maybe i'm just picky. I get mostly menial things to do because that's all the work there really is. I've entered thousands of pages worth of data into excel so far. The good side is that I can go out into the field and see the work being done. I get to see what an inspector does in the field. I get to see how communication happens between the contractor and the owner and how they solve problems. I want to be more involved with the design though. I work probably 50% of the time to begin with, another 30% is menial tasks that any high school graduate could do, 15% is out in the field, and 5% is doing something slightly related to design. It's been pretty boring but overall I think it's going to be a great experience. I have never worked in an office before and this internship has helped me to figure out how an office works. I've eased my worries about finding a job in the future and if I have chosen the right career path. Even though it kinda sucks right now, it's a good thing for me."
EngineeringStudents,3cho0h,MiddleClassSeaBass,2,Wed Jul 8 03:46:31 2015 UTC,That's a good attitude. Probably one I should adopt. I guess I just needed to rant a little bit. But there's definitely good things about my internship as well.

You can ask to see if you can help out to design a small part.   I don't have the CAD software on the work computer they gave me, otherwise I would give that a shot. But yeah, I could try to get more involved in what they're doing. I'll try to ask them about stuff if they aren't too busy, but how would I go about doing this without bugging them too much or them having me do some other menial task?"

I have to figure out how to stretch 3 hours of work into an 8 hour day. Lots of the work feels contrived, I'm almost counterproductive because the guy I help has to figure out what jobs to give me in addition doing his own work. And I came into it with the same attitude, I did my best to find the most efficient way to tackle all the menial tasks they threw at me, but now it's hard to care when it's apparent how redundant I am. It's like they're paying me to hang out with them. I can't really be upset with them either, it doesn't seem like anyone's fault and everyone's very nice. I don't really know what kind of a perspective to adopt to make it feel more worthwhile, but it's good to hear that there are a few other people in this situation. I'm just going to suck it up and stick with them till the end of the summer, then look for something better for next year. Best of luck, I hope things get better."
EngineeringStudents,3cho0h,Hapten,0,Wed Jul 8 08:59:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give you some real world advice. If you're not doing what you want to do, then ask for more relevant and/or important work. If your manager isn't there then  send a well crafted email to him, I almost never see my boss and when I have something to say I just text or email him. If that doesn't work, learn the art of the spin I.e. ""There has been a lot of looking over parts to make sure the contractors didn't mess them up and counting them.""

EngineeringStudents,3cho0h,MCbrodie,0,Wed Jul 8 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"Hate to break it to you but you are doing engineering work. Whenever you are ordering parts or working with contractors, you have to make sure they don't screw you over. If you don't check stuff thoroughly a vendor can send you the wrong parts. Seen this happen so many times, but the project engineer usually catches this. I also seen contractors say that we are missing stuff when we obviously are not.   One engineer sign off on a BOM only to find they were missing some key components. Had to put the entire project on hold and reorder the parts again.   I was actually in a similar situation as you. Decided to say F it I'm going to have fun with it. I started spending more time getting to know people and less on working. Whenever something interesting is going on I would go observe it and ask questions. Then they started giving me more responsibility because they trusted me and I wasn't just another intern workhorse."

Your inventory and counting is integral to the tradesmen and the engineers.  At the bottom level you make the business run well.  You may find the job unrewarding and demeaning but your position matters.  Just because you aren't doing equations does not mean you aren't an engineer.  Embrace your role and begin your climb.

EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,-Wildboyz-,29,Tue Jul 7 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. Thank you. I really wish we could collectively abolish the myth that a USA Today ranking has any affect whatsoever on future job prospects. Ivy league and super prestigious private schools might DO open more doors but public state schools, as long as they are ABET accredited, are seen as equal to one another. People generally go to school in their home state/region. No employer is going to ""punish"" a student for staying in Missouri and going to MU rather than leaving for California and attending UCLA. It just doesn't work that way."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,mprhusker,5,Tue Jul 7 17:53:52 2015 UTC,The US News rankings are also heavily biased towards graduate program quality and don't necessarily reflect undergrad education quality.
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,o0DrWurm0o,2,Tue Jul 7 19:12:11 2015 UTC,No matter what Harvard and Stanford aren't going to have bad undergrads though.   For the most part the correlation between Graduate and Undergraduate is 1:1.
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,foxh8er,3,Tue Jul 7 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about 1:1, but yeah there is probably a decent correlation. However, there are some really good undergrad programs out there which will not show on this list because they're at non-PhD universities. I went to one and never had a major class over 40 students total or a lecture taught by a grad student. You can get a lot more personalized education at some of the smaller universities."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,o0DrWurm0o,-1,Tue Jul 7 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"True, but name > education in my opinion. Places like Harvey Mudd don't make the list despite being excellent in name and in quality."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,foxh8er,3,Tue Jul 7 23:27:06 2015 UTC,"Well I got that at a state school, not Harvey Mudd."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,o0DrWurm0o,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:36:50 2015 UTC,Quoting myself because I'm lazy and don't want to type the same message written in a different way:   A lot of people worry about the prestige of the school they go to and the truth is as long as you go to an accredited school that is marginally ok (enough companies come to the engineering career fairs) then it's all the same. In my department some are from better school and some are from worse schools but we all have the same job and roughly the same pay. The only real difference is the amount of student loans some have over others.
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,cbmb,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, just because you say the same thing multiple times doesn't make it real. A NC State degree is worse than a MIT degree but better than a University of North Georgia degree. It's a caste system, pure and simple."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,foxh8er,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"My answer to that is that it depends. If your intention is to go to grad school, by all means follow the rankings like it's your bible. If your interest is to go into the job market, no one cares. And people care even less after your first job because your experience is what you're selling and not your education."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,cbmb,2,Wed Jul 8 00:41:53 2015 UTC,"Companies don't care. Except for the ones that most certainly do and target recruitment towards top schools, if not in the overall rankings, in that major specifically. Good luck finding a job without an internship or co-op, and good luck finding either when you go to a low-ranked school with no company recruitment.  It's very disingenuous to completely downplay the role of rankings and connections in finding a job. Since ABET more or less standardizes the curriculum of schools it accredits, where you go is a huge indicator of what connections you will be able to make and what jobs you will be able to find. Even moreso than the MIT/Stanford caliber of student who will most undoubtedly make a great engineer simply because he had enough drive to get there that far, even the top 20-30 make a real difference as companies will look at those places and see a higher quality of student and more opportunities available for the students from the school. It's a feedback loop, higher rankings usually get associated with more well-funded programs, which also attracts companies that see those students having more options for club or internship activity."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,mbr123,8,Wed Jul 8 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"Ivy league and super prestigious private schools might open more doors but public state schools   There is no ""might"" about it. Higher ranking schools offer way connections for students to top companies. ex. I go to a somewhat higher ranking school (like 15th in the nation for ME). GM sponsors a senior design team here by donating a car for the project. So those students get an awesome learning experience, and GM gets a direct funnel for new employees.   I agree that the USA rankings don't mean as much as some people think they do. No matter where you go, if you work hard, you will be successful. But it's not like they're just random rankings."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,Joshisacowboy,0,Tue Jul 7 23:39:09 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. MIT looks better on paper than the University of Kansas for sure but it doesn't mean the MIT grad is going to be any better for a job than the KU grad.  If I may ask, would you happen to go to a school that is close in proximity to GM headquarters or have tight alumni relations such as their CEO graduating from there? I figure things like that have a lot to do with companies partnering with universities."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,mprhusker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:50:33 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the job is. If the job is low complexity and not very critical, then no, the MIT grad would not be a good fit, but if it involves a level of high precision and careful design, I would surely assume the person at MIT would be a better fit than someone who went to Kansas University. This is by no means a universal truth, and for sure there are likely those at any school who are more than capable of doing so, but companies have such a wide pool to pick from of candidates that they can afford to be picky for critical positions and will prefer to go to higher ranked institutions where they can be more sure of getting a reasonable selection of people to interview."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,mbr123,5,Wed Jul 8 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that as long as you don't completely screw the pooch on your undergrad, you'll generally have your pick of graduate programs at any school you want.  Provided you still want to study further at that point, of course."

I know 6 people from my graduating class at Nebraska, something like 99th on the USA Today rankings for US universities, who are working or interned at SpaceX. I know of at least 13 people since I started in 2010 who got internships at NASA because of their involvement in our AIAA chapter. I have a friend who is currently working at Tesla. Another one of my friends got two NASA internships, a microsoft internship, and now he makes around $90k a year in Lincoln fucking Nebraska where the cost of living is dirt cheap. Others have jobs at major Aerospace firms like Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems and then there's me, the lowly 2.99 GPA at a lowly ranked state school getting a job right out of school at Cessna Aircraft.   Coming out of school your alma mater defines your earnings potential, and ergo, your value as a human being.   What a close-minded thought."

EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,PhascinatingPhysics,36,Wed Jul 8 05:18:20 2015 UTC,"Have you tried calling an advisor to see why you might've been rejected? There may have been a mistake on your application.   On the other hand, with the recent changes to how the department handles majors, MechE is ridiculously hard to get into even coming through as a freshman. It was a 25% acceptance rate for the freshman that had already completed their general engineering year at TAMU."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,SirJellyMan,14,Tue Jul 7 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"This should have more upvotes.   Call the admissions officer. Talk to them. See what they say.   Also, I don't know about A&M in particular, but some school accept based on intended major. So if you did aero, if there were either not many open slots or lots of super awesome applicants, you may have not gotten accepted. But if you apply for another specialty, you might have been a shoe-in.   Worth a phone call."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,hamncheese71,5,Tue Jul 7 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"I did call earlier, the answer I was given was that I didn't make the cut for Aero. and for Mech. which was my second choice I was automatically denied because they only consider those who put Mechanical as their first choice. I hung up the phone feeling kind of scammed, I understand rules are rules but could they not at the least put me in pre-engineering or something close to that to take me in? I understand A&M is a very good engineering school but it's by no means a Rice, Stanford, or MIT; it is only a public state university and not to mention it cost 60$ every time you want to apply!"

EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,Voidslan,7,Tue Jul 7 20:27:07 2015 UTC,"Did you have the required transfer coursework completed? I believe the courses for Aerospace are the same, but you can find them on their site as well. Did you have at least 24 completed hours of college credit before applying? I also read on the admissions Q&A site that letters of recommendation are rarely considered for transfer applicants in engineering majors. Keep in mind that the admissions process is holistic and does not only look at GPA.  Also, as others have mentioned, try not to get hung up on this too much. UT Arlington has a really good engineering program. As others have mentioned, how well you are prepared for a job after graduation is more about how you use the resources and facilities at your disposal as a student. Graduates of top-tier schools can easily be outperformed by those who applied themselves at so-called ""lower ranked"" schools.   If you think you want to reapply, I would suggest not worrying too much about how the admissions committee looks at the quality of the classes you have taken. If the course is accepted for transfer credit, they consider it nearly equivalent to their version of the course. The idea is you have learned the requisite material to pass the class, whether you took it at an unknown community college or prestigious university.   One last thing: Don't take the decision personally. You were compared on paper to a lot of other applicants who were equally qualified for admission. The school has lots of factors to consider when admitting a student that go beyond GPA and your desire to attend their program."

I wanted to go to uc davis really bad for mechanical engineering. So i saw a councelor at my community college riverside city college, and got a list of classes needed to transfer. I dumped two years into them and had a decent gpa. I applied to uc davis and was rejected. My gpa was way above the minimum they had accepted in the prior years so i called admissions to ask why. It turned out the list i had been given was general transfer stuff and had nothing to do with what the college of engineering wanted for prereqs. So, i started over for another 2 years and finally got in. I just graduated last month.  The moral is if you really need to go to that school, do some investigating as to what they actually want for admissions."

Have you visited and not liked the campus? Or do they not have the right programs? Or are the rankings skewing you opinions of those schools?  If you haven't really given either a thorough look, I'd encourage you to. Tour the campuses, if you can, with open eyes. Look into all the activities and such you can do.

I am planning on going to Texas Tech for a year and try applying again next year. In my opinion it's better to have something than nothing at all, I recommend that you transfer to Tech or Arlington and do your best and try applying next year. You never  know a year is a long time you might even reconsider staying where you are at. Good luck and don't let this put you down."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,InquisitiveLion,2,Tue Jul 7 21:22:17 2015 UTC,Don't feel stupid.  Texas A&M is a huge school anyway.  The class sizes must suck.  Find yourself a smaller school.  The name of the school means nothing.  No one cares once you graduate.  You might get asked where you went and it'll be left at that.
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,Andy_Gator,2,Tue Jul 7 21:24:37 2015 UTC,"When I was applying to colleges, I had some preferences about where I wanted to go. In the end though, as I made my decision, I knew that it didn't matter too much where I went. One college or the other may excel in a particular area, but I wouldn't really be impaired. It comes down to what you make of it.  Going into my junior year, I'm happy with the college I picked. I was given plenty of great opportunities that have given me a great education both in class and in extracurriculars.   You seem like you're a good student, so I bet you'll be happy at any college you attend if you give it the benefit of the doubt. Find people who share your interests, talk with professors, and excel despite A&M not accepting you. You might be able to transfer next year if you still feel so inclined, but I wouldn't be too upset. No matter what happens, you will be able to have a good education."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,Diablos_Advocate_,2,Tue Jul 7 21:51:16 2015 UTC,"What engineering discipline are you applying to? UT Arlington, UT Dallas, and Texas Tech are all solid choices and are even considered top schools in some disciplines. Also, what year did you just compete? I know a friend that waited til their third year to transfer to UT and are doing fine. They're a semester or two behind, but still followed their dream of attending UT.   Personally, what I'd do is look at the companies you want to work for and see where they go to career fairs. That's why I picked UH for my graduate degree after missing out on UT even though I got my undergrad there."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,Ogi010,2,Tue Jul 7 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"+1 for UH  They also have some amazing scholarships too! But really, they're accredited and we have some great programs and everyone in the Houston area appreciates the work we do in that engineering school."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,fonzynator,2,Wed Jul 8 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"I got accepted to UT, but not to their school of engineering, so I went to UH, where we have a great program and they kinda gave me a great scholarship, so that's where I went.   Great school, good classes, actually interested teachers, and it's been a pretty great 3 years. Plus, very accessible internships and you're nearly guaranteed to get a job after graduation. If you're about the money, most of us either get signed at six figures or make that after 3 or so years. My roommate has an internship at a salaried 80 grand, and he's going to graduate in 2-3 more years.   Don't get too down on yourself."

EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,pyzparticle,2,Wed Jul 8 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"Well those are some impressive stats man, sorry and surprised to hear you didn't get in. But if there's something I've learned during my time in industry is that it doesn't really matter where you went to school (as long as it's an ABET accredited program). I've met awesome engineers from ""lesser"" schools and plenty of not-so-great engineers from higher ranked universities, including A&M.   Your grades and internships will be the greatest determiners of your job prospects right out of school. So just keep your head up, work as hard as you can wherever you end up, do some networking, and get some good internships under your belt. Do that and you'll likely be ahead of those relying on school reputation and prestige to land a job (who are often disappointed and frustrated at how little it matters in the real world)."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,KnightOfAshes,2,Wed Jul 8 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"OP, I was exactly in your shoes a 6 years ago.  I had pretty good (not 4.0 good, but good) grades, and had my sights set for Cal Poly SLO as a Mechanical Engineering transfer student.  I was a veteran of the armed forces, and was looking forward to their 'hands-on' type of education.    I ended up being rejected and I was absolutely heartbroken about it.  Turns out they only had room for 6 transfer students; and while my grades were good, they weren't that good.  I transferred to UCSD, which was considered a much more ""theory"" oriented program, which I was reluctant about, but it was the best school that admitted me.  After a couple of terms there, I realized I really liked it there, and the theory centric approach actually fit me much better than I thought.    Point being, you may end up being significantly happier at another school, as you haven't been exposed to upper division engineering curriculum, it's hard to say what you will like.  OP, you will be fine, you're going to enjoy wherever you end up.  Congratulations on your admission to Texas Tech and UT Arlington!"
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,The_Didlyest,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:15:58 2015 UTC,"Usually, in California at least, you won't get accepted unless you have most of your requirements for the first two years completed.   Call them and ask them if that's the case."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,FermatsRiemann,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:37:19 2015 UTC,"When did you apply and for what term?  I only ask because I believe Texas A&M uses a rolling admission system, so you could have been denied because they were considered full for the major you were wanting (some schools only have so many slots open under each major for transfer students) and if they have a rolling admission it is extremely important to apply early."
EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,plw20k,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"It sort of doesn't matter where you go. From an employer's perspective they're more likely to find better candidates from better schools, but that's because better schools have stronger admissions requirements and more competition. This means that the graduates from a higher ranked program are likely to be better engineers intrinsically rather than because of the school. From a personal perspective it doesn't matter too much - you might get better opportunities in a higher ranked school but the education is largely the same everywhere with an ABET accreditation. If you feel like you've been wrongly rejected, just keep in mind that you'll be roughly the same coming out of any of your second choice universities."

EngineeringStudents,3cfooa,callmeslade,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"No offence, but the American system seems pretty flawed. I mean a person with perfect grades should be able to be accepted anywhere they want. You should make so that only like one in a couple of hundreds gets 4.0, that way you'll know if you get accepted or not. Here in Sweden we have a SAT-like test and if you get anything over 1.9 of 2.0 (max) you'll easily get in anywhere you want I the country. But it's only like 100 people out of 50,000 that get such an high result. But still. Also, it's the same with grades from ""high school"", if you get A's every class throughput high school you'll get in anywhere you want. Albeit Sweden is a relatively small country, but this system is in my opinion better than the American system."

EngineeringStudents,3cgs65,Gyang193,2,Tue Jul 7 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"I have some lawyers in the family, and I was considering going down that route myself, so let me lay out what I know. This is US based, though.  First, patent law is probably one of the easiest fields to actually find a job in because relatively few lawyers have the technical degree to take the patent bar. That said, the market for lawyers is pretty oversaturated. There's a lot of them around and law schools are pumping out way more than there are positions for.  People have the impression that lawyers start at $150k plus $50k bonuses, and that's true for the lawyers who went to a top school who get hired at a top firm, which is an extremely difficult path to get on and even harder to stay on - you're talking a few years of 100ish-hour weeks to get your position at a firm like that secure. Most lawyers are in the $60-80k range, just like engineers. Except you now have something like $100k more in college debt.  The work is hideously boring. People have the impression that court is exciting, but that's because real law work makes terrible TV and movies. For every hour you spend in court, you'll spend dozens doing paperwork and legal research, and court itself is a snoozefest.  Patent law itself has become kind of a mess because the patent office has mostly taken the position of approving most things and letting the courts sort it out. This is how you can have things like Apple patenting a rectangle with rounded corners, or Monsanto patenting a wheat varietal that's been traditionally grown for a few thousand years.  In general, my advice to somebody considering law school is:   Talk to real lawyers about what their job is like. Take that into account. Unless you know you have the drive to work and network your ass off forever to land and keep those high-paying positions, go for schools that cost less or give you scholarships over big-name schools where you'll be in debt forever. Nobody cares that you graduated Yale if you're in-house counsel for $60k a year at Bob's Machine Shop in Bumblefuck, KS."

They just want a few things from this piece of paper, so give it to them!  Also, I'd still say that's too wordy. Here is what I'm thinking.  Cut down the ""President's Honor Roll"" to just say that, and the years earned. Nobody really cares what it's for. For programming languages and other experience, literally just list them at the very bottom of the resume in a seperate category ""Skills"" instead of your summary.

I've made some more edits to my resume:  http://i.imgur.com/KWVEs59.png  I thought I would compromise and removed most of the words like you advised, but I also kept things like the Summary, except moved it to the top. And since I bolded my GPA, it kinda placed the eye right to where my GPA is...or at least I like to think so.  I also kept the honors symposium stuff, since honestly, that is the only extracurricular thing I have on my resume aside from the co-op stuff.  The only thing I really want to remove is the last line about being proficient in new technologies. I wanna replace it with something else but I can't think of anything right now.  Also some more spacing, as well as increased font size for headings and such.  Thoughts? Still remove more?"

If s/he wants another look it will get put aside, otherwise it's going into the no pile.  Also, at my recent job interview in April (that landed me a position anyway), he told me that he would have liked seeing my senior project on my resume, as similarly I only had internship experience. Just my two cents! Good luck!"

It won't be read, likely, and the big blocks dwarf the important parts and make me want to skim over the entire thing, which means I won't get much out of it. From looking at it for a minute or so, I can tell you that you did great in school grade wise, but I hardly remember anything else.   Seriously though, I did the same thing. Try looking at guides from colleges. I'll straight up recommend the BU engineering resume guide, it's on their website.   Good luck! You have impressive content, so just look into formatting effectively (in my opinion).   Edit- one more thing. I was also told to consider what was actually important/a game changer about my content. If you have a degree in engineering, it's pretty likely that you are able to use office. Mentioning that you know a specific coding language is good, but will saying you can use Microsoft office set you apart from other people, or does it just fill space? For real though I'm just repeating stuff, don't take this as criticism!"

Also fix that date that is messed up in your experience category. In addition to that dont bold that presidents honor roll thing.   Too much text. I want to look at your resume scan it, have a few things pop out and boom interview. Honestly let your GPA stand out. You may want to format your resume around that so it pops more. I would delete the honors college part you have in there.  Also change your summary into an objective and put that at the top.  Format. Objective. Education. Experience. Skills.   Remember your resume gets you an interview.... then in the interview you drop those blocks of texts in verbal form and then you sound super knowledgeable. boombadabing."

EngineeringStudents,3cfgit,Fruglemonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"One thing you need to remember is that resume's don't get you jobs - they get you interviews. No one i talk to ever listens to my advice because engineers have giant egos but honestly you don't need most of that.  Remember that your resume is in a pile of others. If your resume reflects the fact that you meet the qualifications, you will likely get an interview. If the job description asks for excel knowledge or WHIMIS training, THEN WRITE THAT YOU HAVE EXCEL KNOWLEDGE AND WHIMIS TRAINING.   The sentence that employers say in their head goes like so "" Does OP from University of Central Florida meet the qualifications to work here? If so we will interview him"" and in the interview you can expand on all your extra curricular activities.  Also, don't be afraid to make your resume 2 pages - this isn't highschool anymore, you're a big boy"

EngineeringStudents,3cfgit,cbmb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:52:48 2015 UTC,Isn't that the point of a cover letter?
EngineeringStudents,3cfgit,cbmb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:58:59 2015 UTC,Good question and the short answer is yes.  The long answer is that the cover letter is your forward face.  That is the first foot forward in representing yourself.  Your summary is your clinical representation of yourself.  Your cover letter is longer and highlights information that would not necessarily be in your summary.  An example of this is applying for jobs not in your locale.  You would state in your cover letter you are looking to relocate.  You would not put you are looking to relocate in your summary.
EngineeringStudents,3cfgit,cbmb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:31:56 2015 UTC,"Well, shouldn't that 'clinical representation of yourself' be demonstrated by what you put down in your past experience?

Medical device companies, I worked in a pharmaceutical lab for a few years between degrees and during my first two years. Much of our instrumentation was made by MesoScale Discovery, Cellular Technology LTD, Perkin Elmer, Molecular Devices, Tecan, Hamilton Robotics, Tomtec, Gyros, Thermo Fisher, Finnpipette, Gilson, and Eppendorf. Other major hospital equipment and testing brands I know of are Siemens, Philips, GE, Fujitsu, Panasonic, Welch Allyn, Toshiba, Stryker, and MedTronic, but there are many others in both categories.  * There was enough crossover that I could complete first and second year engineering courses in one year, so I'm pretty much on track as a rising senior now."

No. A masters is supposed to deepen your knowledge of a particular subject.  Taking general classes will not deepen your knowledge of CM. It'll give you a breadth of knowledge like undergrad did with its variety of classes.  I think spending extra years taking general classes is a waste of your time.  And IMO, masters degrees in construction management is a bit of overkill.  I think your time would be better suited to getting experience over getting more education in this instance.

EngineeringStudents,3ci0dh,cakky1,2,Wed Jul 8 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I gather that your complaints are the lead breaking and the tip bending, which possibly is causing the lead to break.  I have the pentel in .05mm and have no issues with the lead breaking.  It also has a nice heft and solid feel to it.. so while I can't help you fall in love with your current pencil, I will recommend the Pentel as fitting your needs."
EngineeringStudents,3ci0dh,tyggerjai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:17:47 2015 UTC,How does the weight compare to a rotring and cheap pencil you buy at store? I did like the heavy feel of the rotring
EngineeringStudents,3ci0dh,tyggerjai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:05:22 2015 UTC,"I love the graph gear. Tip retracts, so no dropping issues. Doesn't break internally for me. Solid weight.   My only complaint is that when a lead runs out, it's an odd limbo - it's too short to easily grab and pull out, but you can't click it out any further. Kinda annoying. Other than that, I actually really like the cheap Staedtler Mars ones - the 775 or whatever.  Sounds like most of your issues are the tip. I'd drop down to the graph gear rather than step up to the 800. I own both the rotring 600 and the graph gear - the graph gear lives in my bag/pocket because it's great for daily use, the rotring lives on my desk where I'm less likely to drop it."

EngineeringStudents,3ci0dh,twinnedcalcite,3,Wed Jul 8 02:57:42 2015 UTC,"Your lead breaking problem is probably a consequence of the borked tip. 2B lead is soft, and pushing it through a curved (bent) tip is going to be a problem.

I also need tracing paper for many labs so I usually had a pad of that.  I have 1 folder for each class which contains all the handouts/printouts/homework.    I made sure to have different colours so they were easy to identify.  I write with different colour inks so I can tell when one day ends and other begins (doesn't always work out but generally it did).  If you want to be the awesome person in class, always have a stapler with staples.  Seriously, there was like this massive issue with finding staplers with staples on campus when things were due."

EngineeringStudents,3cephi,brickrickslick,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"Here's my system:  I have a Surface Pro 3 which is fantastic for taking handwritten digital notes with OneNote - my binders tend to be really disorganized so I find my notes much easier to handle when they're stored on my computer, and I never have to worry about running out of lead. But a word of caution: I don't think typed notes are worth it. The act of writing out notes by hand really helps to internalize the information as you learn it, and trying to type formulas is just about impossible if you have a professor who talks fast (I've seen one guy who was good enough at LaTeX to type up formulas and keep pace with the professor but that was insane, and it's honestly a bit annoying hearing him rapidly mashing his keyboard in a frantic attempt to keep up)  For working, I keep one pad of Engineering computation/graph paper which has been a lifesaver - I'm an electrical/computer engineering student so the lines make circuit diagramming much much MUCH easier, and help me to keep my math organized (I like to think my TAs appreciate the paper when they grade my work). After working through an assignment, I take the pages I tore out and staple them together and put them in a binder (I'm able to use a single 1.5"" binder for all of my classes since my notes are digitized). Another note - mechanical pencils are super nice for engineering because you have a consistently fine point. I recommend this one.  As far as formulas and other big-picture ideas, I usually just keep whatever formula sheets I get in class. Having formulas quickly available is handy but not essential thanks to Google.  My favorite part about this is how light my backpack is - I just keep one binder, one pad of paper, and my laptop"

To be fair most of my classes either did handouts which you could write on, or power points which you could type in. I will say that what helped was that we were a small group (about 17) and didn't compete with each other, but helped each other.  I hear these horror stories of people backstabbing others to try and get a leg up and I'm really glad I didn't have to experience that in my classes.

Naive way: work out the impedances of the 4 components. Do a nodal analysis on the two nodes either side of the resistor. Then, since the current through the resistor is 0A, by Ohm's law the voltage across it, Vr1 - Vr2 = 0. Then you can solve for omega. See attached.   Clever approach: since there's no current, the voltage is the same at both nodes on the inside and we can redraw the circuit without a bridging resistor. With this circuit we can just equate the voltages between the components, which we find with the voltage divider rule. See attached."

EngineeringStudents,3cece2,YourMomWearsContacts,10,Tue Jul 7 06:33:37 2015 UTC,An a 4.0 Scale where A+ is the highest grade it is in general:  A+ = 4.0  A = A+ = 4.0  A- = 3.67  B+ = 3.3  B = 3.0  B- = 2.67  C+ = 2.3  C = 2.0  Take your grades and convert them to these point values then take the average. This is only approximate since they usually get waited by credit value. So an A in a 3 credit course will be worth 3 times more than an A in a 1 credit course.

My university has a 12 point scale, you would think you  just divide 12 by 3 to get a gpa from the 4.0 scale but no. According to the table it is different.   For example if according to the 12.0 GPA scale I have a 10. I could divide the 10 by 3 and my 4.0 GPA scale would be a 3.3. But according to the table a 10 in the 12.0 GPA scale is considered a 3.7 in the 4.0 scale. Here is the link to the table http://studentsuccess.mcmaster.ca/students/tools/gpa-conversion-chart.html  According to a 9 scale if you have a 5.44 that would be around a 2.5 (I dunno, I'm just making a guess, you could use linear interpolation for a more accurate number)"

I'm assuming you have a research committee: your adviser and a selection of other professors who are able to critique your work.  Go to the other members of your research committee with a completed draft of your work and ask for a critique.  As long as you have some sort of relationship with them, such as previously taken their classes or are somehow involved in your project, then they should be able and willing to help you.    After you receive critiques from your committee, make appropriate updates and meet with your adviser.    At least, this is the way I would approach your situation.  Grad school is for you to expand your knowledge and skill set, not to serve at a professor's whim.    Just remember to tread lightly and approach your research committee in a way of asking for their critique and feedback, don't try to involve them in any type of conflict."

What hardships did you conquer? What skills did you gain through challenges or tasks? Did you have to exercise teamwork or working with deadlines or anything like that? Mention it!! It's good that you wrote a script that increased efficiency. That's a good detail to include because it quantifies a benefit YOU brought to the company, but you need more. It's barebones and your first bullet point is just a snoozefest.  Honestly, some of those mundane technical task bullet points can be condensed into one, and you can instead write about things that make YOU a valuable asset.

It's a fairly common software in the ME world and it's more similar to some higher level softwares as well"
EngineeringStudents,3ccdo0,CoasterRage,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:46:28 2015 UTC,I personally like Autodesk inventor better but that's probably because it's what I originally learned on. Right now the company I'm interning with has solidworks and its not much different at all.

EngineeringStudents,3cav90,Saxopwn,2,Mon Jul 6 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"For my Freshman - Junior years I used a Lenovo x200t, a convertible tablet PC. I bought it because I loved tablet PCs and had been using them for years. I wanted a full laptop so I could run solidworks and full PC applications. I ran solidworks a total of 5 times over those years, every single time it was just to verify a drawing while I was in the shop.    Senior year I made the horrible mistake to buy a Sony Vaio Duo 13. Terrible, just terrible. Would not recommend anything that uses a N-trig digitizer, ever. Some people say the SP3 (which uses N-trig) is decent, but I doubt it. Any time I used a display one it was always slower to respond to initial strokes than any Wacom counterpart.   First year of graduate school I bought a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 2. It is alright. A little small and the BT keyboard is several kilometers past useless. The battery life is pretty great, but charging is painfully slow with the included charger. Supposedly it charges much faster with the dock, but you can't get the dock for less than $150 anywhere when the tablet itself was $200. That's absurd! I don't even consider running SW on here, it's Atom CPU and ram are far too weak. If I ever have to do anything serious, I just remote into my desktops with teamviewer.   For all of those years however, I ran solidworks constantly on my desktop in my dorm / apt. All the time. My desktop was irreplaceable. I rarely, if ever, spent time on campus in labs for solid modeling.   All that said, I wouldn't trade my digital notes and tablets for paper ones + $2500 cash. Never. E-Ink is a stellar way to take notes and I hope I never have to go back.   If I were to do it all over again, right now, I'd probably buy either a Surface Pro 3 or a Surface Pro 2 and build a desktop."

I also run things on my desktop but when I am away from the house on campus I haven't run into a situation it couldn't handle. It run's Solidworks / Inventor like a champ. I just use my bluetooth mouse and go to town. Have done a few class projects on it already. Also runs Matlab just fine. Steam games work well. Just don't go too crazy on graphic settings. I play Civ 5 on it and other random games. In line with the ""yellow line"" huge issue that was reported by another guy here. It's not very common but does happen. It's from the adhesive used to bond the screen. Recommended fix actions is to do essentially a burn in to fully cure the adhesive and it clears up. It's not as common as he made it out to be (it seemed to be a first batch near release device problem). Worst case scenario you can turn it into service and they replace the entire device for free. Microsoft's warranty / support team goes above and beyond with the Surfaces. Myself and everyone else I've run into with a SP3 ~15 people. Haven't run into any issues."

My friend got the surface pro 3 overall its a good product, however regarding to the price and screen issue* ( yellow line on the screen, a is very common problem ) it does not worth buying. I bought a tablet samsung A 8inches I think.. which is not very performant... but I am only using it for my pdf notes and online videos.   I highly recommend you getting a laptop instead at that price specially inregards to Solidworks and Autocad ...  Good Luck!"

I worked with composites and did a lot of hands on work that I had never before had the opportunity to experience. Made friends. The professor I worked for had really good students and put a lot of focus on hands on work, the theory driving the hands on work, and being the best presenter possible. He was basically making his students work hard and trying to grow them into perfect engineers and seemed to be succeeding. As a result, the grad students in the lab were very helpful and I learned a lot. I didn't accomplish as much as I would've liked, even with a partner, but we had a lot of problems at the beginning of the REU and 10 weeks isn't much time to work with anyway. I was still able to make myself useful though. Got a presentation out of it and I have a poster that I could take elsewhere if I wanted."

EngineeringStudents,3c8e4d,abitofsky,3,Mon Jul 6 02:48:29 2015 UTC,"You don't have to go on medication. Some people do just fine with talk therapy. However, for some people (including myself), therapy isn't enough. I am not ashamed to admit that I need medication. There's a chemical imbalance in my brain and I can talk about it all I want, but it doesn't help.  Ultimately, the medication decision is up to you and your doctor. Go to your counseling and discuss things with them before going to a psychiatrist. Medication is not the immediate solution. I chose it because I need it. And right now I'm off it and it sucks ass, so I'm going back on it. But that's me. I have friends who were on it only during the high-stress parts of their lives. My whole family is genetically disposed towards depression/anxiety and half of us are on medication right now because we need it.  But you make your own choices. It could be that just talking to a counselor can get some of the weight off your chest. And usually they encourage you to go have fun. Get exercise, take some time to relax, catch up with friends. All work and no play makes Jack a wreck. And if right now the thought of taking some time off to not be studying makes you sweat, your heartrate increases, and you start worrying you're going to fail and have a death spiral... That's a classic anxiety attack. And counseling, with or without medicine, is a good idea. Humans are fragile things, with fragile brains, and engineering is a high-stress major. You're not any worse than your peers for going to therapy. Probably a good chunk of them are going as well. But mental health is something that people believe is a private thing.  Basically, I'd suggest you talk to a counselor or even your academic advisor and see what they think. But the final decision is yours."
EngineeringStudents,3c8e4d,enginrit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"I'd still recommend therapy. Talking to someone once a week has done wonders for my anxiety. Sometimes just talking through something that's been bothering me is the absolute best medicine. It's also great to be able to work problems out with someone I'm not at all involved with socially/familiarly. My mom and friends are great to talk with, but I like having someone where everything I say stays in the room and doesn't affect their opinion of me."

It's fine to be a stressed out on a Monday because there's usually a lot that needs to get accomplished during the week, but time management can cut it up. Try and break up your time and dedicate to certain things. it's okay if you don't finish everything during that time, what's important is that you are working on finishing it.

I choose to play guitar or just listen to music. It's whatever you like.  3) Go with the flow. Having a detailed schedule works for some people. I don't like it cause then I worry about trying to keep to the schedule. With that being said I do keep a schedule but it is more of what to study for the morning/afternoon/day.

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,Imperial_Trooper,46,Mon Jul 6 22:03:44 2015 UTC,"One thing that definitely helps is using your gym time efficiently. Don't make your workout super complicated, streamline it as much as you can. Try to eliminate wasted time by keeping your rest periods short, and spending as little time waiting for equipment as you can (ask to work in, go when it's not crowded, or know an alternative to whatever exercise you want to do). If you're really in a time crunch, strip your workout down to absolute bare bones.  Also, see how your body reacts to working out. I typically like to work out earlier in the day, but I find that a heavy leg workout will just leave me too fatigued to think straight. So, if I have something mentally demanding coming up, I'll save it until the end of the day."

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,plotifer,25,Sun Jul 5 19:14:37 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have been a little more clear about that, the length of your rest period should be dictated by your goals. If you're primarily going for endurance, you could probably go under 30 seconds. For hypertrophy, 45-90 seconds, for strength, like 90 seconds to 3 minutes. It's less about shaving seconds, more about not taking 5 minutes when you need 1."

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,proraso,7,Mon Jul 6 01:41:20 2015 UTC,"I usually go to the gym for an hour at night, but I usually don't start until after 10 so it isn't crowded and I don't have to wait for equipment."

On the days I do go to the gym, I would go at night, around 9:30 or 10pm. By then, all my homework would be done. Also, I like going at night because there are less people, so not as long of a wait for equipment. It's really not that hard to include fitness into your daily routine."

People think i'm crazy but it just requires going to sleep a little earlier than normal, which i'm okay with.   The morning workouts left me energized for a good few hours after and then coffee took care of the rest. This upcoming junior year might be a different story though."

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,salierniwasokay,9,Sun Jul 5 23:37:16 2015 UTC,I played basketball for stress relief. In undergrad I got really good at basketball...
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,12gabriel3,5,Mon Jul 6 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"Sports is kinda tough because pick-up soccer for me lasts two to three hrs.   When I just work out I have two types of workouts. I do the traditional splits focusing mainly on compound movements (bench/squat/deadlift). Pick a compound movement and do a few accessory exercises for it. The other days, I just do a ~30 minute kettlebell workout. The complex that does best for me is 10 swings > 10 goblet squat to overhead press > 10 swings > 10 curls to overhead press > 10 swings > 10 sumo deadlift to upright row > 10 swings > 10 rows each side > 10 swings > 20 pushups. I rest 2 minutes and do three sets. Then the last thing I do is EMOMs (every minute on the minute) with kettlebell swings for 10 minutes. So you start a stopwatch. On every minute, start 10 kettlebell swings. the faster you do them, the longer your rest is.  If you're not trying to get big or anything but just want to work on overall fitness, I highly just recommend buying a kettlebell. It's a great fitness tool. It's an all body workout. It's also quick and efficient. Mixing kettlebell workouts with barbell movements is what keeps me happy though."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,beardedburden,3,Sun Jul 5 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"Obviously, each person will have their own preferences. From talking to different people about this (and through my own experience), the following seems to work pretty well:  Become an early bird and get up an hour or so early to do your workout. This can be beneficial in different ways. It ensure that you actually get your workout done (if you save it for the evening, it can be easy to tell yourself that you have other things to do).   Also, it may help wake you up a bit and get excited and ready for the day. I find that some workouts can actually help stimulate your brain and get you ready for class. Be careful with the type of exercise though. For me, jogging (and other cardio) makes me really tired and would make me feel dreary in classes. However, lifting weights makes me feel good in the morning. Figure out what works best for you.   Another benefit is that, sometimes, you may find that gyms are emptier in the early hours, and that's always nice.   Other than working out, look to see if your faculty runs intramural sports. They're great for stress relief and, since it's run by the faculty of engineering, they'll schedule the events in a convenient manner for you!   There are lots of people who are able to balance all of this. It can be tough if you don't cut down on more useless activities/time wasters (such as Reddit!). You'll have to be more efficient but it's definitely worth it for your health and sanity."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,BoabyTheBarman,3,Sun Jul 5 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"The major problem for me is not the time I spend at the gym (1h 3x a week), but the time I spend doing other stuff when I should be studying. So that's what I focus on. Not procastinating."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,cj2dobso,3,Sun Jul 5 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"It required some sacrifices. I didn't have a lot of time where I could go to the gym and play a couple pick up games of basketball and THEN go lift for an hour or two. Those are some large continuous blocks of time I couldn't really sacrifice. It was more so Can I play some basketball today, or can I only lift? Definitely can stay active easily, but you have to learn to prioritize what it is you want to do, whether it's a general tone for the semester or just deciding how you want to stay active for that day."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,Kritty1996,3,Sun Jul 5 23:00:44 2015 UTC,I'm willing to sleep less (6 hours) and work out for 1-2 hours rather than just get 8 hours sleep. I'm totally fine with 6 hours so I normally just head to the gym in the few hours before I'm due to go to bed. Plus side is that the gym is essentially empty at night so I can get my workouts done efficiently.  I've also tried treating University as a full time job. If I've got work to do I won't head home until it's either done or it turns 5 o'clock. It's amazing how much you can accomplish if you head to the library/study rooms in between class. Means your evenings and weekends are totally free.

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,rustyoldtimer,2,Mon Jul 6 05:15:26 2015 UTC,"I have yet to master the study/exercise balance, but I can speak to its importance. When I'm in a fitness mindset I will spend 60-90 minutes on an elliptical 3-4 times a week, usually in the evening. It's not good for training, but it can be great cardio if you don't slow down. I notice I sleep better, have more daytime energy, and focus better when I keep up with my exercise. It also helps counteract the comfort food if I'm having a particularly tough week in school, which is an added bonus to my confidence and self esteem.  From one engineering student to another, PLEASE make time for exercise. Find what works for you and take advantage of the benefits. Healthy body, healthy mind.  Edit: And if you need a little more motivation, try using an activity tracker. I got a Fitbit One and having the ability to see real data on my physical activity helps me want to raise the numbers of steps/miles/ burned calories I do each day. It adds a measurable value to 15 more minutes on the elliptical."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,MechPandaa,2,Mon Jul 6 07:21:36 2015 UTC,"Umm freshman year I was really careful, always took the steps and was reasonably careful with what I ate. I exercised fairly regularly, too, and managed to lose 2 lbs (thought I did good to beat the freshman 15). Sometime after then I managed to gain 25 lbs, though. Some of what I gained was muscle, but a good chunk of it was getting lax, spending a lot more time on homework (letting it take away from exercise time, awful idea), and more social life. Be careful, college can sneak up on you."

Homework and tests and office hours and projects with groups did. My schedule revolved around everyone else. When everyone in my team could meet. When my professor could make time for me to walk miles to his office. When an assignment took several hours a week, working late into the night.  In the end I got the grades I wanted, though. Now that I have a nice 40 hr/week job post-graduation, I'm going to make time for myself again."

You'll hate yourself the next morning.  4) I usually aim for 4/5 days a week when I'm not super busy, but 3 times a week when I loaded with midterms."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,Heidi423,2,Mon Jul 6 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"Although it's usually difficult to get going, getting your workouts in first thing in the morning is what works best for me. You end up killing a few birds with one stone this way if you stick with it too because the early workouts make you keep a consistent sleep schedule. Some of the most successful guys in my program are the ones on the crew team because they have to get up at 5:30 every morning for their workouts.   Also, like others have already said, it's very worth it to make time for fitness even if your schedule is busy. There are plenty of studies that show you benefit both physically and mentally when you keep yourself active. Three days a week of moderate exercise is a great start for most people."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,Fourier1,2,Mon Jul 6 04:16:25 2015 UTC,"Set aside a fixed time for hitting the gym - as though it's a class in your schedule. Always go at that time (as though it's a class). Never skip a session for any reason (after all, it's just like a class). Even if you have a test coming up, I assure you that one hour clearing your head at the gym and maintaining your body and mental state is worth more to you (and your class) than an extra hour of studying."
EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,kingrobotiv,2,Mon Jul 6 04:28:24 2015 UTC,"Stress keeps me thin.   Honestly, I probably biked 2-3 miles a day easily around my campus, just between classes. and that's not the easy biking, it's the holy crap, teacher let us out 5 minutes late (10 minutes between classes) and I have to bike 2/3 of a mile and get a good seat so I can hear the teacher, type of biking. Also, there are people, buried in their glowing rectangles that will just walk out in front of you, so you have to try not to lock brakes while swerving, then get your speed back up.   I do take joyrides on my bike when it's light out and there are very few people around, but that's on the weekends. It's a great low-impact activity since I blew my knees out a few summers ago. Really fun actually, especially when you can have a bit of a race with your buddy."

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,MacawsInMacau,2,Mon Jul 6 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"I really wish I figured this out during my first year, but doing some type of excercise helps. I took walks on nice days but not much else. The day after my finals I finally went to the rec center and tried the rock wall. After that I thought 'why didn't I try this sooner?' Now I think that if I had put in a half hour or so of that a few times each week, I would have been less stressed out all the time. I'm going to (try) to change that this fall and start rock climbing or something. Just find something you like to do and deciside how much time you want to devote to it. Some people like running or swimming, I like hiking and climbing (not very good at it though). It helps you deal with academic stress better and take your mind off it for a awhile."

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,HammerheadLincoln,2,Mon Jul 6 04:55:37 2015 UTC,"Make ""the gym"" interesting to you as an engineer. Find a good stationary cycle or rowing machine that gives your output in watts: these allow you to create periodized training plans that allow you to tinker with your fitness in much the same way that you tinker with various engineering projects. If that's not possible, heart rate is a good enough start. Cardio has far more immediate benefits vis-a-vis mental clarity, improved sleep, etc. than lifting weights, so if your schedule is truly pressed for time, skip the Curls for the Girls.  LPT: Do a post-class review and your assigned homework as soon as possible after the class. Fresher material = greater retention = faster homework = more free time. I usually end up spending most of dead week/finals week in the saddle of my road bike.  One last edit: if there's only one thing you should be doing if possible in a gym, use the rowing machine. It combines cardio with complex weight lifting."

EngineeringStudents,3c7smr,TheBigTiger,2,Mon Jul 6 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"My general advice is to go between classes. If you have an hour's break between class, what were you gonna do in that time? Watch a TV show on your laptop? Buy some snacks from a vending machine? Study in the library a bit? You can't finish that much studying in an hour. I would usually fit in a 5x10 of bench presses, shoulder presses, and pull ups in that time, and maybe fit in some crunches afterwards. It won't make you look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it'll keep you in shape enough. Or, go to the basketball courts and see if you can join some others for pickup.    Do you only have a thirty minute break? Leave your backpack with a friend and go running. Run a circle around your campus or see how many laps you can make from your previous class to your next class.  If you're scared of being all ""gross and sweaty"" during your next class, just bring some deodorant and a change of clothes. Plus, if you're going to an engineering class, who's going to judge you? We're all used to much worse smells anyways.  Of course, if you don't have a break between classes, this doesn't work. I'm in CompE, and I would also just do preliminary planning for my programming homework while in the gym. I'd just think about what I could do to implement whatever goals I needed, and write down notes on my phone in between sets. You don't get that much done, but at least you're getting in exercise and doing some classwork at the same time."

EngineeringStudents,3c8tbc,reddit409,10,Sun Jul 5 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"If you like research and the prospect of grad school, there is no shortage of physics in electrical engineering.  You could go through the solid state path in EE. There's a lot of nanoscience and physics to be done there. I'm doing an REU right now where I work with a group of theorists (as well as experimentalists), with electrical engineering backgrounds. There are plenty of EE's, physicists, material scientists, and chemists here. So some EE topics are very interdisciplinary, and very theoretical. (at least in research areas)  I'm still an undergraduate and gonna be a senior this fall and I've had the same dilemma as you. I don't like circuits, but I know how they work, they just bore me. I like physics. I was going to minor in physics. But then I'd just be taking lower level classical physics courses when what I really wanted to take was laser physics and some of the more esoteric quantum courses.  But I started out in EE and I figured that if I just focused on EE, I could go the solid state route, go really deep into it and eventually take classes like solid state physics, transport in nanostructures and even some photonics classes (no shortage of modern physics there). So there is plenty of physics to be done in electrical engineering. And plenty more research to be done. If you get a physics degree, and go more toward the applied physics route, then in grad school you may end up working with a team of electrical engineers anyways.  So unless switching majors doesn't really set you back at all, stick with EE, maybe even minor in physics if possible, and take the engineering route with the most physical science you can find. But this all depends on your interests. Maybe you won't like semiconductors too much. Maybe you don't want to go to grad school. But even then, there is plenty of electromagnetic/optical engineering work to be done (you'll probably be working with even more mathematical models here, and a lot of computational stuff, but I'm not too familiar with this area).  But either way, even if you are in engineering, if you want to go down a path with more physical science, a graduate degree will become more necessary in order to have the sufficient marketable skills needed to enter the job market."

Advanced power systems courses become really interesting- applied physics, math you never want to do again, etc.    I've spoken to a few recent EE grads who are working as engineers in consulting and power engineering   If you're talking to MEP consultants, you're going to have a bad time. I hate to disparage EE's that go that route, but a master electrician could do that job. There are a lot of different roles in MEP, but the ""Wiring CAD"" guys have it the worst. A job like that would be mind-numbing.  If you want to see some crazy stuff in Power - Protection, System Planning, Operations, Power Electronics."

EngineeringStudents,3c8tbc,mr_crabs_tits,2,Mon Jul 6 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"I'm actually kinda of in the same boat as you, OP. I'm about to enter my second year this fall and while I haven't taken any actual EE courses, I chose it because it had a ton of opportunities, both within the university and in industry. I've been tinkering this summer, hoping to get a feel for what I would do. I too enjoy physics. I haven't taken modern (probably gonna take it in the spring), but I absolutely loved E&M. The material was so much fun.  But, what I really love are computers. Idk if /u/mr_crabs_tits can give me some advice regarding computing with EE but I'm sure there are plenty of opportunities with this field."

EngineeringStudents,3c9ucz,BFoskett,11,Mon Jul 6 06:19:37 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I have literally no idea what that is, but my personal rule would be if you have engineering in the degree title and the degree is accredited then go for it."

EngineeringStudents,3c9ucz,Brewbs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:03:50 2015 UTC,This seems Like a really wierd thing to do. Do you have a strong backround in physics and math? Have you already started your engineering studies?

I opted out of physics my first semester as a physics major, thinking I could jump straight to upper level classes. I was way wrong"
EngineeringStudents,3c93tz,DrunkVinnie,3,Mon Jul 6 10:02:12 2015 UTC,"I would skip gen chem, but take calc 2 again. You'll be using calc constantly throughout the next four years and this gives you a chance to get accustomed to how college math classes operate."
EngineeringStudents,3c93tz,MrSteve920,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"I don't see why you shouldn't go straight for calc 3. If you finished genchem, that should also mean that you'll be taking Physics 1 as well. Those two classes go great together. I'd say go for it. Being ahead means you can either add in a minor of your interest later on, or take grad classes later on, or even graduate a semester early. It can give you a little breathing room if you happen to fail a class, you won't have to do summer school or add an extra semester.  Just don't jerk around your freshman year and you're all good, but that applies no matter what courses you take."
EngineeringStudents,3c93tz,mr_crabs_tits,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:03:58 2015 UTC,Skip General Chemistry and then here are some questions you need to ask yourself? - Do you want to take another class? - If you are not in a great financial situation then maybe you do not want to pay for the class? If you aren't worried about taking another class or paying for it then just take Calc II and get an A+ then proceed to Calc III later.
EngineeringStudents,3c93tz,TheBigTiger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:15:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that a college course won't necessarily be harder than the AP class you took in high school. I didn't fully test out of chemistry and had to take general chem 2 my first semester. I thought I would learn cool things and do more advanced experiments with advanced equipment, but really I could count on one hand the things I learned in that class that I didn't learn in AP chem. I was bored out of my mind. I also knew people who got 5s on the AP exam and could have skipped over the class completely but chose not to because of the same reason you listed. It turned out that they already had a solid foundation and didn't need the class at all. Because attendance was mandatory (clickers) they were forced to sit through a boring class learning almost nothing new. It was an easy A for them, but they regretted rejecting their AP credits.  This will obviously vary by college, so I suggest asking people who were in a situation like you and see what they did. Better yet, email your professor and see if you can get a syllabus.   TL;DR evaluate whether an easy A is worth relearning what you already know."
EngineeringStudents,3c93tz,Apfelstrudel1996,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:53:34 2015 UTC,"Go ahead. You will be fine placing into Calc 3. It doesn't matter if you take Calc 1 and 2 again anyway, you're going to forget the material a few weeks after class is over.  You'll enjoy the freedom in your schedule. While everyone else is doing gen eds, you can knock out a class for next year."
EngineeringStudents,3c93tz,Oxidation_State,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:48:58 2015 UTC,"I am also an EE who had the choice to skip Chem I, Calc I&II, and Physics I. I ultimately decided to retake Chem I and Calc II, while skipping Calc & Physics I. The reason was that I had forgotton most of Chem and while my Calc foundation was strong, I felt that retaking Calc II would be a grade booster. Trust me, getting As are more important than trying to skip intro classes. If you're not sure, retake it. Its worth the easy A (as long as you don't completely slack off) and helps your GPA. Plus its just good as a refresher when things get harder."

I was able to talk to a few petroleum engineers and other members of the gas and oil industry. Petroleum will be around a lot longer then people realize. One engineer told me we only extract about 5-10% of whats available in the earth; it just becomes harder to extract. But hell isn't that why we wanted to became engineers. What turned me off of it was the unstable-ness off the jobs its self. You either have to move (I live in Pa), or political interests could effect it, as another engineer put it ""there's always something"".

EngineeringStudents,3c84ru,InvisibleBlue,3,Mon Jul 6 04:24:00 2015 UTC,"I am a layman but If you're counting on fracking to be a big thing in the future i sincerely hope and think that it's not going to be.  Intensive fracking hasn't been going for that long and from following world news and us news for a while now i've seen a lot of evidence about its damage popping up including earthquake activity increase, fracking waste water finding it's way to drinking water (partially because of the increased earthquake activity i guess) and leaks among other reasons.  As i've understood so far doing some internet research on it a part of waste water is often left inside the fracking holes under high pressure which would explain it. Nevermind the fact you have to dispose of the rest of the contaminated water somehow.  The high pressure contaminated time bombs are a very SERIOUS issue and in my personal opinion it's already done irreversible damage which won't be fully understood for an entire generation or two. If the majority of fracking water ends up in the drinking water you've basically got a poisonous wasteland, how poisonous and dangerous however remains to be seen.  As far as fossil fuels go, methane is supposed to have a future. Completely phasing out fossil fuels is impossible in forseeable future. The less carbon a fuel has and the more hydrogen it has the more energy is released from it's burning compared to it's weight and less carbon emisions take place. Carbon becomes CO2 and hydrogen H2O. methane burning  EU  Most importantly: Don't belive me and do your own research. I'm a student like you who has already formed an opinion of his own on this issue.  Also fracking causes methane leaks which is a WONDERFUL fuel but is also a very powerful greenhouse gas (up to 21 times more powerful than CO2)"

For me, an internship that I loved is what gave me the motivation to keep up the work. I no longer care about my GPA enough to stress out and lose sleep/health over it. Mostly because at this point it's a little above average and not going to change much unless I flunk a class. I can generally get a B in most classes without killing myself, so my plan for my last year is to do well (B's or up for me), have more fun with friends than before, and work on fun side projects that will keep me motivated and look good on a resume for the field I want to go into.

What type of internship/co-op/PT job are you looking for?  Then work backwards to:   Which companies might have a need for a student like me? Which parts of my classes/projects/experience can I highlight that match up with what they might be looking for? What can differentiate me from all of the other hundreds of students out there?  Pick your top 5-10 targets and focus all of your preparation on those companies. Come prepared with the questions above already answered. Do deep research on new developments that they're working on so that you can strike up a conversation with the recruiter(s) and show genuine interest. Get on LinkedIn and check out some engineers that work at these places locally - see if you can reach out to them to chat beforehand to sharpen your understanding of what the company does/needs beforehand.  The more prep you can do up-front, the more you'll get out of the process. And through this process you'll be able to quickly determine whether they would care whether you're an AE or ME (most wouldn't if you understand their problems and show genuine interest).

EngineeringStudents,3c6mgp,jugglingman456,3,Sun Jul 5 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"I posted this on this forum last January: ""I attended my first career fair 2 weeks ago and got invited to an interview with a company 30 min in. Here are some things I learned: -before the fair, print out a list of companies and star the ones you reallly want in one colour, and the ones you like in another color. These are your top priorities. Talk to as many random companies as you need until you feel comfortable approaching the companies you starred -make sure you dress well. For a fair I would just recommend business casual. The interview I got above was the next morning and the fair was two full days. So after my interview I went to the fair again but this time in the suit I was wearing during the interview. The response I got was that recruiters talked to me about office jobs more than field jobs which was the opposite of what happened when I wore business casual the first day. Also, some of the big companies actually took my resume while they told other less dressed up people to apply online. - do your reasearch. This seems hard at first because there could be 40+ employers per day. So only actually research the companies that you have starred the day before so it's fresh in your mind. For the companies that I never heard of during the fair, I would do a quick search on my phone right before I talked to them to bring up some relevant info on current projects, positions, etc. -choose the right recruiter to talk to. There will usually be 2-3 of them per booth so figure out which one you would be able to get along with the most. I think this is pretty important because if you can relate to the recruiter, they will want to help you. This is going to mean taking a few laps until this person is free, even though other recruiters in the booth are available. -do not be a robot. Recruiters will be talking to a ton of students that will all be telling them the same shit. The most effective way I found to actually engage the recruiter was to find a personal connection with them based on what you have experienced. They are way more likely to remember the conversation, especially if you can make them laugh. -stay as long as you need to in order to talk with/hand out resumes to any company you are qualified for. Bring a folder to carry around with the company listing and 3-4 resumes in it at any time. Keep track of your progress by crossing off the companies you spoke with on the company listing and see where you still need to go. Good luck!"""

EngineeringStudents,3c7jf0,whatswrongwithme94,25,Sun Jul 5 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"If by engineering counselor you mean just an academic advisor, then no, I would not fill her in on all the details. If she is some type of licensed counselor, however, then yes, be honest. Either way you need to see some type of mental health counselor/therapist, preferably one specializing in substance abuse. Most schools have ones you can see for free. If they want to refer you to an outside clinic, explain your financial situation and they probably will be accommodating. Be prepared to take some time off from school to work on your personal issues and work off your debt.  Most importantly, do not be ashamed of your situation. Shame isn't going to help you quit your cocaine habit. Get the help you need, and try to stay positive. Again, I cannot stress enough that you seek help from a therapist or substance abuse counselor. Reddit can't help you with your mental health issues."
EngineeringStudents,3c7jf0,engthrowaway123,3,Sun Jul 5 17:14:25 2015 UTC,"I strongly second this, as someone who performed poorly at university (so far it has taken me 4 years to get to the end of second year) for similar reasons I think the point about shame not helping is very important to emphasise. Feeling like you are a piece of crap and feeling ashamed is really what we are taught we should do in such situations but it will only make your addiction seem more comforting and less costly, there is a serious danger of getting into the mindset that you aren't worth saving so you might as well do some more coke. My advice would be of course see a counsellor, but also try to rid yourself of the feeling of guilt, try not to driven by emotion, without letting yourself off the responsibility of your actions. You need to hit the metaphorical reset button, you know that you were valuable prior to your coke addiction, so you do know that you are worthy of the time and effort of your counsellor, friends and family and that it is important that you can recover. You need to focus on the future now and try not to dwell on what has happened. You should also be aware that your progress might be frustratingly slow because frankly changing even small aspects of your personality is very hard. Also be aware that there is likely more of a problem than you ended up doing too much coke, you may well have to face underlying personal problems as you deal with the cause of your addiction. In terms of debt it doesn't sound like you will pass, I would see if you can get mitigating circumstances and or suspend your studies for a while, work to get your finances in order, but importantly make sure that once you are in a better position keep studying."
EngineeringStudents,3c7jf0,BFoskett,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:10:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should have mentioned that I have been sober for 2 months now..by myself. Although I crave it when I'm really sad, I'm pretty good about not touching it.   As for paying my tuition, fortunately I have landed a dream internship which will allow me to pay my tuition for this term. All I need is an extension to pay the finances..which I will request from my counselor.  My main concern is passing. I'm just so far behind I don't know how I can catch up and learn the material within the next month as finals are just around the corner. Failing would mean, I get kicked out of university and lose my internship offer. So I'm really really worried about it. To the point where I can't sleep nor study effectively. What can I do about this issue. I'm sure if I pass..everything else will sort itself out.  Thank you all for the kind remarks. Cocaine is a bitch of a drug but I'm confident I can remain sober. Just really worried about passing this term"
EngineeringStudents,3c7jf0,mnk88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:48:27 2015 UTC,"It sounds like things are coming into order, considering you'll be able to pay your tuition thanks to the internship, if you can keep it. As for failing, well... losing 35% of a grade is a big hit. Will your credits even count for passing if they are below a C? If you've done the math and know that aceing your finals is your one final shot at passing this class, do EVERYTHING. Research for supplemental reading material, put together flashcards, watch YouTube videos, practice problems. Do literally everything you can and crush that final exam. In the end, if you're going through hell you just gotta keep on going. Good luck."
EngineeringStudents,3c7jf0,lowdownporto,15,Tue Jul 7 03:14:14 2015 UTC,you need help. Take a semester off go to treatment. This is not good man. Paying your tuition could be the least of your worries.
EngineeringStudents,3c7jf0,bearfx,6,Sun Jul 5 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, you are in a bit of a pickle, but it is not without hope. Your main problems are: * Drug Addiction/Dependency    Drug addition / Dependency  Poor academic performance  Insufficient Funds for next semester.   Engineering is about problem solving - so lets work to solve this problem.  1 is the biggest, and without conquering it, you will not succeed.  Without knowing your school, I cannot direct you to the resources you need, but can outline what is likely available to you.  Resolving Problem 1 Find your colleges Drug/Alcohol Counselors.  Make sure they are credentialed counselors, and make an appointment today.  Talk to them honestly, because they are there to help you get out of this mess.  They can also advice you on other resources that may be available to you.  Yes, you messed up, but everything can be recovered.  If you haven't already, stop with all the drugs.  Then follow their advice,  Resolving Problem 2 Fixing poor academic performance is hard, but doable.  Talk to you professors, tell them that you were having a rough time adapting, and that the school has you seeing a Councillor to help you achieve better.  Ask for homework help, and for extra credit, and for explanations on things you dont understand.  Do the homework and the extra credit, and put effort into it.  Show the teacher that you are a bright student who got off track, and are working hard to fix it.  They will help.  Resolving Problem 3 Money is a bitch of a problem.  You will likely have to take out unsecured student loads with crappy terms, but you should still be able to get them.  Keep working, but not to the point it interferes with #2.  Put this money into an account that you have trouble accessing until you need to pay tuition.  Cut down on all non-essential goods and services until you are on firm footing again.  It isdn't easy, but you can do it.  For the long-term, I would also recommend you join one of the drug recovery groups at your university to help you stay on the straight and narrow."

Man having to school and work all at the same time ain't easy and you've reached up to this point, ain't no time to quit. you are aware that you have an issue preventing to complete your academic goal, that is good; you feel the need to change that's even better…Now go  get some guidance or support group. Man we all face some kind of addiction, that threaten our goals, and actually fighting back to reach our goal is what makes the journey worthwhile. I am telling you, when you get that degree in your hands, you will have tears that no one will understand but you, cuz only you know what monsters you had to conquered to graduate.  As far your tuition is concern, you are being honest and taking responsibility, that's good. now get your shit together and go bank to get student loans, it will certainly come with higher interest and shitty conditions, but hey that what you got yourself into. Clearly working hard to pay your tuition is undoing the hard work you've put into this degree and most certainly increasing the odds of you not graduating.  BY THE WAY I disservice you to take a semester/year off, now is the time of change buddy! taking time off is just what the voice in your head expect so cocaine can destroy you, like I said we all go through some kind of shits, now is the time to man up  That was my two cents!"

EngineeringStudents,3c7kb1,JMHow01,3,Sun Jul 5 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'd check the requirements for the programs at the universities you're planning on attending. Physics 3 is usually modern physics/quantum mechanics, which isn't required for most engineering programs. Chem 2 would probably be required for ChemE, but not MechE. Have you taken a computer programming class?  Whether you can complete everything in 2 years will depend on how frequently the courses you need are offered. In theory it's possible. In practice, some classes will only be offered in certain semesters. So if you start in the fall, but a class you need as a pre-req for 3 other classes is only offered in the spring (because they assume you'll take it in spring of your second year), it could cause issues. The other issue is handling the load. Most people take their humanities gen-eds gradually, so that they're not just taking 5 straight hard science classes in a semester.   In state tuition often requires a lot of hoops. Like the other poster, I grew up in MI too. But one of my parents lived out of state. So despite the fact that I a diploma from a MI high school, I still had to give a crapton of paperwork to UMich to prove it (I didn't even end up going there, I had to do that just to apply as in-state). When I moved to NC for grad school, we were required to apply for in-state residency after 1 year. It made no difference to us since the department paid our tuition, but it saved the department money. Again, it was tons of forms detailing, among other things, anywhere I had lived for more than 2 weeks in the past 5 years."

You might have to take a few years after undergrad to get into a grad program, but that's pretty normal.  I don't know what school you're at, but if your school is highly ranked and they won't take you for a research position, you should look at lower ranked schools in your area and see if they'll take you on for research. For BME, look into medical schools/hospitals in your area as well because they do research too. You can try to get research experience throughout the year, but you're going to want to get some prolonged experience (so you might want to just do research for a year after graduation or something).  What's your GPA over your last two years going to be? Quite a few grad programs only care about your last 60 credits/two years of school so if those are above 3.0, you won't have to worry about your GPA for those programs."

Also, look in non-BME departments like physiology that might not get very many students. You're going to be a hard sell for the more competitive departments.

The economy isn't that great and a masters counts as 1 year of experience towards the P.Eng across the country.    It'll also get you more contacts as well.  All depends on your professor.  Also you resume and cover letter probably need to be restructured to catch companies attention.

He then turned to IT and he is now in Montreal... finally he found a good position.  That has being said, I strongly believe that a certificate will give you a better kick! I always encourage people to do their masters & Phds, however in your case its better to get experience then pursuit your studies for further credentials.. Usually employers do not hire someone who is too qualified. So be careful with that. Be patient, while searching for a job do your certificate to optimize your time and keep an eye on every opportunity. Do not get desperate or down ...  generally in these domains Chemical engineering, environmental, mining ... its a bit harder compared to mechanical, industrial and civil ... just the beginning to get started, but once you will get IN ... you will be in TOP! ... you are almost there do not drop ...

There's basically two sides to the argument:  Pro STEM Shortage:   Substantially lower proportion of STEM graduates than other countries Offshoring R&D STEM jobs (as well as some tech jobs...) No noticeable growth in STEM graduates or papers unlike other developed nations   Against STEM Shortage:   More engineering graduates than entry-level positions (well documented in US and Canada that there's a significant number of engineering graduates who can't get engineering jobs) Argument that the industry is using the STEM shortage to artificially inflate the supply of engineers (citing STEM shortage causes US government to encourage more STEM students as well as grant more H1B visas) which reduces the amount they have to pay engineers   I flip flop between the two a lot and can see the merits of both arguments. However since I have been job hunting (internship hunting) and been around many friends who are job hunting (for full time) it's pretty clear as day that there's not engineering jobs being offered willy nilly to any engineering graduate as some crying STEM Shortage would have you think.   Furthermore IIRC I've read that engineers used to be paid as much or more than doctors in USA, and now they are paid substantially less (median salary ~$90,000 vs. ~$185,000 from BLS I think).

They assume having strength in Chemistry means you should go Chemical engineering, strength in Physics means you should go Mechanical engineering. I'm a recent high school graduate, and no matter how I try to deny it, I'm still affected by what I've heard.

I chose chemical engineering precisely because I knew I wanted to pursue engineering, and chemistry happened to be my favorite subject. As long as you don't have any illusions about what you're getting yourself into, you'll be fine.  With respect to your original question, I think it may be better to choose what you enjoy rather than what you're good at. If you enjoy what you're doing, you're more likely to put in effort to learn it, but merely being good at something doesn't guarantee that you'll actually do well. You don't want to end up three years into your degree, not enjoying what you're doing, and having to decide whether to switch out or push through.  Another way to approach this is to consider where you want to be in five years. As cliche as that sounds, you should choose your major based on what you want to be doing after graduation. This is often a tough question for some people, but you seem to at least have some idea of what you're interested in. Chemical engineers often end up doing things like process engineering, process design, or research and development for petrochemical, specialty chemical, consumer products, or pharmaceutical companies. If that doesn't sound particularly appealing to you, then chemical engineering is likely not a good choice.  I hope this was helpful, and best of luck in your future studies."

EngineeringStudents,3c4s84,StarRice,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"I always enjoyed the STEM sciences throughout my primary education, and honestly looked at the course schedules for degrees (What classes did they take, does it sound neat to me, or like a chore?), googling what engineers did, watching those documentaries about large building constructions and being fascinated.   Also the higher job security definitely helped me decide as well. While I haven't started any classes yet, this is what helped me decide it at least. Also! Search this sub-reddit or /r/engineering or some of the specified ones and just have a look around.   I wanted to originally go into computer engineering, but after taking Python, Unix, and Perl at a community college I'm glad I didn't pursue it. Just wasn't for me.

EngineeringStudents,3c4s84,Scrtcwlvl,2,Tue Jul 14 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"So, two questions.  One: I used to be a graphic design major, and I've recently picked art back up as a hobby. I launched a new portfolio page, and I don't plan to include it on my resume, but I'm wondering if there would be any advantage/disadvantage to linking to it on my LinkedIn page. I don't really have any engineering-related pieces up yet, but I may in the future.  Question 2: Looks like my engineering-related work experience is going to be somewhat scattered by the time I finish school. Last year I did work relating to 3D printing and quadrotors, this year I'm doing biomechanical engineering, and looks like I may be in oil and gas next year. Does this look particularly good/bad?"
EngineeringStudents,3c4s84,DAMAN16,3,Wed Jul 15 14:03:44 2015 UTC,"One: I'd consider tacking it on your resume through a website link. As in, link to your website and have a projects page. Projects are still good examples of work even if they aren't related to engineering. Sure, they'd prefer to see major relevant projects, but just showing you can work with your hands and bring a concept to fruition is often very helpful for some jobs. One of my internships I was specifically chosen out of the candidate pool because I was the only one who had tech support on their resume - worked as a Staple's EasyTech like 7 years ago. It was just what they were looking for, sometimes you never know.    Two: Mine is pretty scattered too. Design -> Process Optimization / Web Development -> Medical Devices -> Aerospace -> Consumer Product Design -> Manufacturing Equipment -> CAE Instructor -> Robotics Research. It can look less desirable if you are trying to specialize in one specific thing, but aren't showing it with employment. If you aren't laser targeting on one specific industry / position, it is fine. A broad resume can often be advantageous for multidisciplinary positions."

Some questions you might consider:  What type of work interests you most (structural design, energy systems, software, hardware, modeling, testing, efficiency, etc.)?  Do you want to work at the actual OEM itself? Or a supplier that focuses on a very small niche?  For example, I'm an ME and I work almost solely around designing products for injection molding (we make washer systems for all of the major OEMs).

It's nice to have goals in an industry, but I personally think you should also set goals for what you actually want to do"

Has anyone properly managed their time so they can spend time with their partner, study and maintain good grades, be active in your majors clubs, and still enjoy hobbies? Is it possible? I naturally sleep 6 hours a night so it gives me some more hours during the day.   Any tips for this?"

The more they can relate to what you're doing, the easier it is to let things slide. Otherwise, talk to them explicitly about what 'study time' needs to be for you; where, when and how you like to work. How productive you're able to be will dictate extracurriculars."

My biggest tips would be :  1) stay organized  2) pick a night/day for you and your SO to have together with no school. I did homework on maybe 4 Friday nights my entire 4 years and that was primarily for major projects. Take some time off!  Edit to add:  3) don't join many things just for your résumé. Join something you enjoy and are passionate about and it will be much more impressive.

EngineeringStudents,3c54x8,laxman1515,2,Sat Jul 4 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"In short I recommend you learn all of them.  Start with AutoCAD, once you're fairly good move to Civil 3D if you can find a well documented guide and project to work on. You can also learn basic drafting in Civil 3D instead of AutoCAD since it has a 2D drafting workspace. Revit is a whole different beast and is not like AutoCAD but its really nice so I do recommend you atleast play with it. There are Lynda.com videos and guides online to help you. BIM is supposedly ""the shit"" these days so that might prove to be helpful. I would put Excel with VBA before Matlab because its more than likely that company X has a copy of Excel on all their machines.   In addition to these software you'll want to get your hands on SAP2000, RISA-3D, or IES Visual Analysis. These are structural analysis programs and you'll most likely find yourself using it more than any of the other programs while in school.  At work I use AutoCAD and AutoCAD Map3D. Map3D is more geared towards Map creation, Civil 3D is geared towards civil project planning and design. With Civil 3D you don't need AutoCAD because it is already included with Civil 3D however sometimes software behaves strangely. So while Civil 3D can do something you might find that AutoCAD is better, for me its the performance when using Aerial Images that forces me to use AutoCAD."
EngineeringStudents,3c54x8,brickrickslick,2,Sat Jul 4 23:21:03 2015 UTC,"2D drafting is first priority. AutoCAD first, then Bentley Microstation. Please know that many transportation and structural firms are switching to Microstation to better integrate drafting and structural analysis from Bentley LEAP products. LEAP is mostly used for bridge design. Microstation is mostly used in transportation. Excel to help speed and check calculations, and Mathcad if you can. Good mathcad sheets will save you on homework as well, mostly for iterative design classes like reinforced concrete and steel design. Structural modeling is nice for homework too. I like RISA 2D and Autodesk Forceeffect for my 2D work, SAP is ok. Forceeffect has a phone app and Chrome app only - but it draws axial/shear/moment diagrams for you in its report function. Great for checking work on homework. A decent free program is Mathstan 2.0 for 3D structural analysis. Please know that Mathstan was created by a professor and published online as-is; it has very very little (if any) IT help or technical support.   That about covers it. Maybe Photoshop to make your facebook sparkling and professional :)"
EngineeringStudents,3c54x8,SmashingReptar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:33:31 2015 UTC,"Microstation is nowhere near as popular as AutoCAD but it is seen enough that knowing it may help. If you have to choose between the two, Autodesk products are more widely used.  Warning with Civil 3D: it can and will crash a workstation. Learning it is great, but some companies are hesitant to use to because they know their current workstations cannot support it, hardware-wise. However, finding a system that can run it consistently enough for you to learn it will make you a unicorn. MASTERING Civil 3D will make you rare and magical and intriguing. Messing around with it for a weekend before giving up will not."

I've spent the last few weeks frantically searching for placements along for him (since I had nothing to do) by cold calling and managed to find something magnitudes better than the original placement. He will be starting in 2 weeks time.   To be frank we started searching for alternatives about a month ago. Ever since he was given an offer from the original placement, the liaison has been vague and reserved in his/her email replies. We knew that there was something wrong (i.e. being told that it will be a paid position originally, then suddenly receiving an email stating it will be unpaid. Saying that placement can start between X & Y month and then suddenly saying that the suggested starting/ending dates will not work despite being within their window). Bear in mind this was one of the biggest graduate recruiters in the government/client-side sector in the UK, I was extremely appalled by the way my friend was treated (really lack of empathy or shame from the liaison) so I was thankful that we end up securing something for him that is much better as a big 'FUCK YOU' to the original placement guys.   My point is, start using unconventional methods for finding your placements. I don't want to give out too much details since I don't my friend to get identified but I managed to get him an interview a week ago by strolling into a construction site on my uni campus with a copy of his CV and asked the laborers where I could find the project manager's hut and now he will soon start working on-site for arguably the biggest contractors in the UK."

I think I'll mull it over this evening and then start searching again tomorrow; I'm still waiting to hear back from uni staff as to what I need to do to continue my studies, and student finance won't help me until Monday unfortunately.  I have myself in this mindset that a placement is what makes students really stand out to employers and now I'm caught in this awkward panic that this could majorly impact my future if I don't manage to get anything, but at the same time it's really hard to convince myself it's worth the effort now.

If their email isn't available publicly, I try and spot patterns in the company email by looking at examples of available emails online (i.e. Firstname.Lastname@company.com or Initials_lastname@company.com) and just plug in the name of the person I want to contact. I send off a nice email (which acts as a cover letter) and my CV asking if there is a possibility I could work with them, saying how much skills can compliment their work (Not work for the company, I explicitly stated I want to work with the person or his department). Then I wait 1 or 2 days before I call them. If their phone numbers aren't available publicly, just call the reception for the office and ask to be connected to the person.   In the past I've applied to 20+ companies online and never had any luck. I've applied to only 2 companies using the coldcall method but both times I've secured placements. I find it strange that the 2 companies that I've got placements with were one of thes ones that have rejected me in the past when I applied online.

This is especially true for MS students, as funding is often prioritized for PhD students."

It definitely is possible, but switching to nuclear (if offered at your school) would be the better choice. That being said, the nuclear power industry is bound to need chemical engineers for some reason or another, although not as predominantly."

If you want to use your ChemE background in Nuclear expect to be in fuel, waste or coolant (re)processing/R&D. You can go elsewhere but you may have to take physics/mechanical classes. Not sure what type of work/research is open to ChemE's on the fusion end.  Even at masters (I assume that's what you're referring to with ""grad school"") level the of theoretical physics/quantum mechanics is not that intense. It's the maths you should be concerned about. While you'll (most likely) never use it in it's pure form, take a look at the neutron transport equation for an example of horrible maths. That and perturbation theory.  Anyway, if you're interested try taking some basic reactor physics/kinetcs/engineering classes where possible. The nuclear field is badly gapped and people are needed. Expect a secure job"

If you're here in the US, you've got three options (iirc) for schools with a full Nuke program : MIT, Texas A&M, and Univ of Tennessee Knoxville.   Call up A&M's nuclear department if you're really looking for some solid advice. It's a small (but great) program and (last I heard) the admins are very friendly.

EngineeringStudents,3bybdo,IAlternateMyCapitals,83,Fri Jul 3 12:48:25 2015 UTC,Unpaid internships should be illegal. Either you're a volunteer at a non-profit or you're a paid employee. It is entirely unethical to have someone work for you for free while making a profit.
EngineeringStudents,3bybdo,theGentlemanInWhite,33,Fri Jul 3 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"Well that's sort of how it already is. For someone to be an unpaid intern they have to be getting more out of the experience than the company, like an art student getting one on one experience with a master. If the company is profiting from the internship then they have to pay.   Is this rule always followed? No, but it is the rule."
EngineeringStudents,3bybdo,CHARLIE_CANT_READ,9,Fri Jul 3 05:23:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it's too hard to enforce. At least for engineering internships, you might get more out of it right now, but the company gains a lot in the long run by finding and vetting interns to decide which ones they want to keep. If they don't intend to hire at the end of the process then they shouldn't have interns in the first place."
EngineeringStudents,3bybdo,theGentlemanInWhite,16,Fri Jul 3 05:27:36 2015 UTC,The majority of engineering internships result in work that significantly benefits the company.

What the hell do you want? Workers rights don't just magically appear, if students want to be paid then they need to know unpaid internships are illegal and not accept them. Maybe schools should do a better job of telling students when it's appropriate to take an unpaid internship."
EngineeringStudents,3bybdo,CHARLIE_CANT_READ,2,Fri Jul 3 13:29:02 2015 UTC,"like an art student getting one on one experience with a master.    Totally irrelevant to the overall topic. One of my friends (he's a MechE) got an internship with a ""public sculpture"" workshop who specialized in welded metal sculptures that pays about the average engineering intern rate. My girlfriend is currently in art school and going to exhibits they set up the stuff my friend makes in his free time could be comparable to the best of show. Idk how any of this is relevant besides people who are exceptional at art don't go unpaid."
EngineeringStudents,3bybdo,unityskater,5,Fri Jul 3 07:36:52 2015 UTC,Maybe my example was poorly phrased. I was trying to say that in the case where an art student is learning more than they are providing value then they don't need to be paid.

EngineeringStudents,3bybdo,axz055,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:32:04 2015 UTC,"They aren't blatantly breaking the laws by the DOL standards.    The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;   Met: In original post he mentions ""The work I'm doing is stuff I learned from school""    The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;   Met:""At the same time, I am gaining a great experience and will have a pretty impressive thing to put on my resume.""   The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;   Met: By OP's statement ""All the work I'm doing is stuff that none of the employees or bosses at the company know about"" can be assumed to read ""I'm the only one doing the shit""   The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern;and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;   Met: Questionable but per the OP statement he is doing testing that might not be used therefore derives no advantage from him. If he came up with the cure for cancer that is one thing, this is another.   The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and   Met: By statement ""I currently work for a company as an unpaid engineering intern."" he knows his position and fully accepts it. It is not a ""Intern and possible candidate for hire""   The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.    Met: See above.   When you break it down there might be one issue but it is not violating employment laws. We can assume he signed a contract (hopefully) or made agreement to work unpaid and to change the terms of that agreement would not fly in court."

Fishing wire (+ some sort of pulling) is a very rudimentary way of replicating hand motion, from my knowledge. For a more smooth and controlled motion, you might want to add some method of making the fingers ""unfurl"" instead of opening directly. What are the points of attachment for the wire on the fingers/hand?  For individual fingers, you'd need an individual mechanism for each one."
EngineeringStudents,3c191e,defyingsanity,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, as of right now I have a motor with a small rod on it. One set of wire controlling all the fingers opening is tied to one end and the closing wire is tied to the opposite end. When the motor causes the rod to rotate clockwise, the wire controlling the opening motion goes taut while the other slackens. This causes the hand to open. The opposite motion causes the hand to close.    As for the point of attachments on the fingers, I have each set of wire going above or below the fingers and then connecting at the finger tip in a knot.   For a more smooth and controlled motion, you might want to add some method of making the fingers ""unfurl"" instead of opening directly.

EngineeringStudents,3c17nx,EngineerEddy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"As a follow up to recruitment opportunities, since that is what you (the OP I mean) seem to care most about. Keep in mind that a lot of recruitment depends on location rather than simply prestige. Many companies will have a local state school as a tier 1 recruiting school while something like MIT or Stanford is not a tier 1 recruiting school.  There's valid reasons for biasing recruiting efforts by location too:   It's cheaper. Less travel for the recruiters. Less money for a relocation stipend if you take the job. Easier to set up an on-site interview. Everybody hates phone interviews, both interviewers and interviewees, because they simply aren't as effective as an in-person interview. If you're just a 2 hour drive instead of a 5 hour flight away, it's easier to set up an on-site interview (cheaper, more convenient for you, etc.).  You're more likely to stay on for a full-time job. The fact is most people either want to work near their college or their home (or both, if you go to college near home). Furthermore, you're more likely to regard the company highly. For example in Michigan automotive companies might be more highly regarded than in other parts of America, whereas in Washington maybe Boeing is more highly regarded."

Sorry I'm not more help, these problems are highly visual and this was a pretty tricky type of calc 3."
EngineeringStudents,3c0zc3,Darth_drizzt_42,3,Fri Jul 3 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"The equation you have is for circle. x2 +y2 = r2. Therefore, r2 = 4, and your radius r = sqrt(4) = 2.  Ok, well you know the equation you have is for a circle in xy plane.  Solve for y to get y=plus/minus sqrt(4-x2).  The positive part gives you the top half of circle, and negative part the bottom half. http://imgur.com/atcaM5q,L6Ku5YO,c72wqMy,yVSoXRn,GoYCVqy#2  Ok, now you are given the height bounds (z), which is z = 0, and -z=y. Well if -z=y, then z=-y. Then your z bounds go from z=-y to 0.  Ok, now lets look only at the positive root of the y equation (+y). This is for simplification, we will account for the other half of circle later. Well, if you graph it, you get the top half for the semi-circle.   Ok, if you integrate this, you get the area under this half-circle. What are the bounds for integration of this half circle? We know radius is 2. If circle is centered at (0,0), then we want to integrate +y from X = -2 to 2. I believe this integral is a trigonometric integral. If you don't like this, you can use cylindrical coordinate system. http://imgur.com/atcaM5q,L6Ku5YO,c72wqMy,yVSoXRn,GoYCVqy#3  http://imgur.com/atcaM5q,L6Ku5YO,c72wqMy,yVSoXRn,GoYCVqy#4  Ok, now that we have the area, we can multiply by the height to get the volume of this extruded half circle!! Look at it this way. Integration is adding stuff. What happens if you add a bunch of areas on top of each other? You get a volume!! So what is our area? It's the result from the previous integral. Ok, so let's add up this area (integrate this area equation) from one height to another (on top of each other) to get a volume. Height is same as Z. 3-space is x,y,z. http://imgur.com/atcaM5q,L6Ku5YO,c72wqMy,yVSoXRn,GoYCVqy#0  Z bounds are z=0 and z=-y. What is z=0? That's horizonal plane covering X axis!  How do you add it up? Integrate the area equation with respect to dz, and the bounds of integration are z = -y to z=0.   You have a volume! But which volume??? A half cylinder! But you want a full cylinder! Well, by symmetry, the other half is the same volume as the part you calculated... so just multiply your answer by 2 to get volume of full cylinder! http://imgur.com/atcaM5q,L6Ku5YO,c72wqMy,yVSoXRn,GoYCVqy#1  yay you're done! I think it might be easier in cylindrical coordinates now that I think about it. x=rcos(theta) y=rsin(theta) z=z  theta = sweeping angle. for full circle, you sweep from 0 to 2pi radians. then integrate how you would, but with respect to theta, then with respect to z."
EngineeringStudents,3c0zc3,yosimba2000,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think that z=-y is a plane that runs at a 45 degree angle it would look just like the first example here,http://users.math.msu.edu/users/gnagy/teaching/11-fall/mth234/L28-234-tu.pdf BUT slid over to have the center of the wedge at the origin"
EngineeringStudents,3c0zc3,yosimba2000,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:42:37 2015 UTC,"haha yeah you're right! sorry about that, it's been awhile. but the idea is the same.  :D"
EngineeringStudents,3c0zc3,yosimba2000,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:55:46 2015 UTC,"ok here's what I believe it is. First, what is the height? The height is from z=0 to z=-y. So height delta Z = 0-(-y) = y. That gives us a line (the length of line = height of object).  http://imgur.com/HY2H03u,KgM5mui,VOCZosL  Ok, we also know how to relate height to width and length of the geometry. It's from the circle equation. Y = plus/minus sqrt(4-x2). Plug this into Delta Z equation. This relates height to width and length of the cross-section.  If you graph the cylinder w/ the cutting planes, you get this picture: http://imgur.com/HY2H03u,KgM5mui,VOCZosL#1 You can see that you can solve for half of the shape if you go from Y = +2 to Y = -2. But attempting to do so will create the wrong answer since +Y is top half of circle and -Y is bottom half of circle, which we havent used the equation for.  So do it this way: From the Delta Z equation, plug in +Y. This is still giving us height (a line). Now integrate this line from Y = -2 to Y = 0 with respect to Y. Because by adding a bunch of lines in a row, you create a plane, which is what your new equation is now. Now if you add up a bunch of planes in a row, you get a volume. So integrate the plane equation from X = -2 to X = 0. Now when you get your answer, realize that the geometry we solved for is in the 2nd quadrant when looking from top down. If you can visualize the whole shape, realize that the 1st quadrant geometry is symmetrical to the 2nd quadrant. So double your answer to account for both volumes. Call this final answer A. http://imgur.com/HY2H03u,KgM5mui,VOCZosL#2  Ok, now to solve for the 3rd and 4th quadrant, which are also of similar geometry. Let's look at quadrant 3. The height is still Delta Z = y. And we also know the relationship between height and width and length. But this time, we have to use -Y because the 3rd quadrant uses the negative semi-circle equation. Plug in -Y (solve for Y itself first though, so Y = -function) for the Delta Z equation. Now as before, what we have is still a line. Integrating this line from Y = 0 to Y = 2 gives a plane. Integrating this plane from X = -2 to  X = 0 gives a volume in the 3rd quadrant. Double this answer to account for the volumes in quadrants 3 and 4 as they are similar. Call this answer B.  So then, your total volume is A+B."

Kerrebrock's ""Aircraft Engines"" (I think it's got a longer title)   This book is kind of an in-depth, better version of Mattingly, but undergrads often complain it's too complicated.   Greatix's ""Powered Flight""   This book is kind of like Mattingly, but there are parts where it's better and parts where it is worse.  For papers, check out NASA's STI server. Search for fuel combustion and so on. Ideally, you want your combustion to take place at a velocity of Mach 0.3 or less, but the parameters of combustion will depend greatly on your fuel choice, droplet size, and so on.  Did your mentors/tutors/professors approve this project? I just say this because it sounds a little overscoped. We've had whole graduate teams (8-10 people) work on redesigning and building one of those engines for about $50k and have been unsuccesful.

For example: here and here are some of Virginia Tech's policies regarding transfer credits. Note, that one of those pages (I think the first one) mentions that they require you to be in good academic standing with your previous institution to transfer. That may not be true for all schools but I thought it was worth mentioning. Finally, you'll need to check those universities  for application deadlines. Again using Virginia Tech as a reference, the application deadline for transfers starting Fall 2015 was February 15 with notifications sent out on May 1. So, for similar universities, the ship may have already sailed for transferring this year.  A word of advice based on your text: I would recommend a small, teaching school for you rather than a large research institution. They will likely give you more personalized attention and provide a more interactive, engaged environment which may (or may not) help."

EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,MSchroeds,9,Fri Jul 3 01:43:54 2015 UTC,One of the reasons I chose to pursue engineering was how much graduate school was optional instead of a requirement like many STEM fields. While having a masters is certainly helpful in obtaining some jobs (especially later in your career) it definitely is not a must have for most entry level work.
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,AnalogKid2112,5,Fri Jul 3 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"I'm working on a PhD now  ONLY do grad school if you want to do research at the highest level (industrial R&D, national labs, academia, etc.). Don't do it because of the money or because your parents told you to because you will get rekt lol."
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,Thiggles,8,Fri Jul 3 11:07:23 2015 UTC,"its easiest to get a masters right after undergrad. masters during work is like, really really tiring and long even if you take one class per semester.  and yes, if you want to get higher up without having first to work like an extra 5-10 years, masters is essential."
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,Gyang193,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Kinda reassuring to hear someone say that.  I can never tell if my parent's advice is outdated, or if our generation has just a ""cheat the system"" and ""you can get by without doing X"" mindset."
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,qwicksilfer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:36:29 2015 UTC,"I am going to disagree with /u/Gyang193 here. It depends heavily on where you go. Some of the really big places don't care if you have a BS or MS, they will look much more at work experience. If you want to go into management, you may want to hold off on an MS and have your company pay for an MBA or engineering management masters.  If you want to stay technical, you'll definitely want to look into an MS and maybe even a PhD (I don't recommend the PhD route unless you really know that's what you want to do - and I'd work for a few years before heading down that road).  /u/Gyang193 is right that it's a lot harder to do a master's once you're working. Not only because you're tired but because school work seems often very insignificant to the real work you have to do.   Either way, there's no real harm to getting a master's degree right out of school - except don't go into insane debt for it.  Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,axz055,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:00:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!!! That was really well explained. The debt thing won't be a problem. It's looking more and more like getting a masters right out of undergrad is the way to go
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,CentralChime,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"The other thing is that there are 2 different types of engineering master's degrees. There is a thesis-based master's where you take classes and do a research project, and there is a non-thesis master's where you just take more classes. Employers will usually only pay for the latter type, since it's the only one you can do part-time. But if you want to do R&D, a thesis-based program will be more useful.  Most colleges give them different names. Thesis-based is usually MS and non-thesis is usually MEng, but it's not always consistent. Many universities (including GA Tech) offer BS-MS programs that allow you to get a thesis-based MS with only 1 additional year."
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,amfoejaoiem,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:59:39 2015 UTC,Currently an undergrad learning mechanical engineering. I plan just to finish my bachelors with my remaining courses and take a few grad classes on top of that. Work for a few years to build up some experience. I know a lot of grad programs are looking for people with research experience. It can't hurt to work for a few years while at a lab or testing facility.
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,axz055,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:53:06 2015 UTC,What are your career goals? Short term / long term?
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,amfoejaoiem,2,Fri Jul 3 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"Ideally, I'd like to get a solid career building job right out of college (whether that be undergrad or post), and work my way up the ladder to be head engineer of my department/company. I don't want to be job hopping, and I want to stay in one location (but doesn't everybody? Lol).  I am about to be a junior, and I've had internships the past 2 years, and I'm sure I will the remaining summers.    I ask mainly from a job opportunity standpoint.  Some say it's easier to get a job WITHOUT a masters, because you are more specially qualified and you have to be paid more.  Any truth to this?"
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,Hurricane043,3,Fri Jul 3 02:34:33 2015 UTC,"Without a graduate degree, there are more jobs you're qualified for, but thousands of other people are graduating every year with the same qualification. With the specialization that comes from a graduate degree, you might be overqualified for the basic jobs, but you can apply to ones that require a more specific skill set and won't be competing with nearly as many people. Only a fraction of people will go on to get a graduate degree and only a fraction of those will focus on the same thing as you. So instead of competing with 5000 people, you might be competing with 20-50. Of course, there also won't be quite as many of those positions, so finding them can be a challenge, and you have to be more willing to relocate (and the higher-level the position, the more likely the company will pay for that).   You make it sound like being more qualified and getting paid more is a bad thing. Any company that prefers to hire less-qualified people so they can pay them less is not somewhere you want to build a career. Don't think of a master's as making you overqualified for BS-level jobs, think of it as qualifying you for MS-level jobs."
EngineeringStudents,3bxwa4,brickrickslick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:37:35 2015 UTC,"and I want to stay in one location (but doesn't everybody? Lol).   Not necessarily! I love moving to new cities.   Some say it's easier to get a job WITHOUT a masters, because you are more specially qualified and you have to be paid more. Any truth to this?   There is some truth to this - certain jobs will only hire undergrads. There are other jobs, higher up the ladder that will only higher people with grad degrees.  Sounds like you have no issue with working your way up the ladder, and if you've already had a couple of internships you know what that entails. You don't need a master's degree. But hedge your bets! When you start to get towards the end of your time in school apply for jobs and grad schools at the same time."
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,Inferno221,12,Thu Jul 2 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, you will always have to apply online (for large companies). My company audited their hiring process 3 years ago and went from no rules to completely online applications. I think it was so that everybody had a fair shot at the openings and to try and avoid nepotism/discriminating hiring practices."
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,WiggleBooks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:42:06 2015 UTC,But I thought that networking and knowing people was great in getting jobs? I thought nepotism was a way of life for all industries
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,vice_grippy,6,Fri Jul 3 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when your hiring practices get audited, you can land in deep shit. Basically you (we? they?) have to prove that the person you hired through nepotism is also competent and better than at least some of the competition."
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,papperonni,2,Fri Jul 3 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"I'm also a recent grad; I actually just started in a really great job. I'm in a different field than you, so I'm sure the hiring process is different, but I have exclusively had luck applying to positions online. I mean, I have worked three internships, all of which I got by applying to random online listings (not even through my university's recruiting network). My current job I actually applied to online, and then found the company at a career fair. I spoke to them in person about how I had already applied and I'd like to think that helped. Otherwise, I'm not a particularly memorable person, so I am not good at making much of an impression in a venue where I'm one of hundreds of students forcibly handing a recruiter a resume. (That said, I have a friend who has exclusively gotten jobs through career fairs-- I guess it's different for different people.)  I think my personal success was due almost exclusively to the sheer number of positions I applied to. It may be a pain in the neck to repeatedly enter all of you information online, but I was applying to 3-4 positions a day until I was interviewing for a few different positions at the same time. Fresh out of school, it isn't easy to get a job right now. The way I think about it, getting hired at any one company is a long shot, but getting hired by one of many companies is much more likely overall."
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,axz055,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"If your school has an alumni network, make use of it. Graduates are often eager to hire fellow students from their uni. I got my current internship from posting my resume on our school's website without having to apply. It was a smaller company, but anything is better than nothing. I think they offered a position to someone and they declined, and they needed someone on very short notice.  Also, you will have to apply to many things. Before I got this internship rather randomly, I applied for ~30 positions, and got interviews for only two of them. Neither of the interviews resulted in a position, although one was courteous enough to tell me that out of the NINETY people who applied for the ONE AVAILABLE POSITION, I was his second pick (which may have just been nice, but we talked for a long time). It doesn't matter that I was second - there was only one position available, and a lot of people applied for it. The only real way to counteract this (without getting additional work experience or training in the meantime) is to apply for many things, and eventually, you will get something. Also apply to less advertised companies, as ones on the front page of job websites often have dozens if not hundreds of applicants."
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,adca,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:02:14 2015 UTC,"Some companies do still have a way for employees (career fair recruiters, personal connections) to ""recommend"" people after they've applied.   I probably applied to ~100 jobs. Of those, ~80 never replied at all. I had an extended email exchange with a recruiter for one. I was qualified, but they wanted someone who could start sooner (I was still 6 months from graduating at the time). But I had 3 actual interviews (2 in person, 1 via skype), and eventually got 2 offers.   In terms of getting a reply from an actual person, job listings where you just email your resume to someone were the most successful for me. Though the job that I actually got was through a job posting (not a connection) on Linkedin. Also, all of the ones where I was actually contacted were positions I was especially qualified for via my research/internship experience. So while some argue that you should apply to as many as possible, I found that to be counterproductive."

I try to push for results, but for my work at Blah labs and consulting, we do different experiments. Those experiments have different results. Something like testing the coating thickness of a certain substrate will have different results than testing the ductility of that substrate. And some tests are qualitiative, I'm not sure how to go about illustrating the results from that.   Maybe I can show just one test for an example, but it doesn't make sense since customers just say ""here is our sample, can you determine how much the coating thickness is?""  One thing I think I can add is that in terms of ""minimizing costs"" I've saved the company hundreds of dollars on equipment.   Same thing goes with the senior design project, we saved money in different areas and there are optimal conditions for different key products."
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,Riveraj0301,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:43:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry if that was miscommunicated on my part. What I mean is that  ""Conducted experiments at Blah lab"" vs. ""Discovered cost savings through material ductility (insert lab speak) through assigned experiments"".   I got a lot of feedback from HR reps on that I wrote what I was responsible for vs. what I actually accomplished if that makes sense."
EngineeringStudents,3bx7dh,adca,2,Fri Jul 3 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"How about something like:   ""Work to minimize the costs and amount of equipment needed to perform experiments, saving hundreds of dollars in expenses""  I get what you mean with the accomplishments, but with the variety of experiments we do, its like impossible to say something like ""consistently performed experiments with less than 5% error"".  Me developing tests to be added to the compaies accredited scope is an accomplishment, cause it increases the customer base of the company. Metal finishing companies would rather have their samples tested by someone who is accredeited to perform that test."

That processor will run one program at a time; but if you are multitasking and you have MATLAB, solidworks, firefox, spotify etc etc open at the same time you will run into memory issues, and are gonna want more ram (16GB min).  Ideally, engineers refrain from buying gaming laptops, and instead invest into ""Mobile Workstations"" ( http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/category/category_slc.asp?CatId=11871 ).

I'd say as a graduating senior there is more that you can add to your resume to show what you know and what you've learned in school. Also you could reformat a bit it so that it's easier on the eyes.  First I would make your header smaller put your address, written in letter form, in the top left and your phone number and email in the top right (phone number on top).  Next, I would take the cumulative GPA off. Since it's below a 3.0 it'll catch way more attention than if you were to just put your major GPA, do not leave the word ""major"" out though.   For your work experience, projects, and research where you list the companies and such put your title right next to the name of the company, followed by the location. Also put the dates you worked there on the same line as the company you worked for but put it on the right side. Putting it like this makes it read like a sentance, ""I worked at blah labs and consulting as a lab engineer in city, state from june to the present and here is what I did there"". The way it reads now sounds more like, ""I worked for blah labs in NJ. I worked there from june until now. I was a lab engineer"". Resumes are a list of things you've done so every new line should be important information.  Now for the individual positions. With some things remember that it's often HR looking at your resume and an engineer actually interviewing you, don't be afraid to talk yourself up about things you actually have knowledge about.  First, for the lab engineer job for the most part it reads like that was the job description when you applied there. For the first point say something like, ""Developed new experiments to expand the range of accredited testing services for metal finishing operations."" I took out the mention of ISO because by just saying accredited it shows that you an industry standard. Then in an interview you bring up how you used it to make these new experiments. Second I took out the mention of the ""company"" by listing under the company name they know you're already doing it for them.   For the second point you should reword it so that it first says what you did, then how you did it. For example ""Wrote the standard operating procedures for various processes following standard ASTM test methods.""  For the third point I would say ""currently working minimizing...."" For the fourth I would reword it as, ""Increased productivity by providing employee training and guidance on company test procedures.""  For senior design. In the first bullet I would change ""in aspen plus"" to ""using aspen plus"". Since I've never heard of Aspen Plus that way its worded now makes it sound like an actual power plant not a program.  The second and third point can probably be combined. ""Using mass and energy balances the optimal efficiency of the plant was calculated reducing the capital and operational costs while increasing efficiency."" This one is a little more iffy because of my lack of knowledge in ChemE. One thing that is important though is that you already mentioned you worked with a team so someone reading this knows it was a group project. From then on focus on the results. If you ""cooperated"" with the group you probably know the ins and outs of the project and you aren't applying with the group give yourself more credit. That applies to the last bullet point as well. I would probably just take the ""with the team"" part out, if you were involved and can explain the reasoning no need to devalue yourself.  For the EWB work the first point is good. The second and third could be rearranged. for example the second could be, ""Tabulated the average rainfall per month which led to accurate estimations of the monthly roof runoff."" The third, ""The barrel system designed by the group was able to provide water for the community garden for the year it was monitored.""  For the research portion I'd say the first bullet point may be a little excessive, instead of describing the grand detail of what you were hired to do it reads as you're bragging that you got the position. I would just delete everything after the comma. The only other comment on the other points is to change the verbs to past tense(modeled, measured).   For the skills section I would title it ""technical skills"" and change the other ""technical"" to ""computer""  and say ""microsoft office"".   Going back up to the top where i mentioned you should move some things around like the contact info, and the job title/duration you'll probably have some empty space. Under the education section you should definitely have a relevant coursework section. Me, like many others who you're sending your resume too have probably never heard of Blah University School of Engineering and even if they have they may not know what you you actually have to learn to get a ChemE degree. By listing some of the classes you've taken it shows companies that you're applying for what you've actually had to learn to get through your degree. These can be general courses that show that you have a solid foundation and more in depth or concentrated courses that apply to the company you're applying to. If possible change these around if you're applying to companies in different fields that may see value in some classes over others.   If you want I can PM you a copy of my resume since I kinda just explained through words how mine was formatted."
EngineeringStudents,3bx5zu,unityskater,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:10:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I disagree on you with two things:   Next, I would take the cumulative GPA off. Since it's below a 3.0 it'll catch way more attention than if you were to just put your major GPA, do not leave the word ""major"" out though.   Leaving the cumulative GPA off would also catch attention. I've tried this, and haven't gotten any success with it. HR people aren't the cream of the crop, but they're not stupid either, they'll automatically assume I'm taking it off to get a higher success in applying. Or they'll assume its lower than it is. GPA does matter for entry level engineers for the most part.   Under the education section you should definitely have a relevant coursework section   I consider the relevant coursework as fluff, because its just listing core classes that are expected to be taken in a chemical engineering curriculum. It also takes away space to highlight important skills."
EngineeringStudents,3bx5zu,unityskater,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"I can totally agree with the GPA thing, I meant to write a disclaimer on that but I kinda got carried away with the other stuff. I was never in that situation so I was just giving my opinion and should've stated as such.  For the relevant coursework I sort of disagree. Maybe it's because I went into the metallurgy aspect of MSE so I felt the need to list classes relevant to actual metallurgy (though I listed 8 classes in total 3 of which where metals concentrated) but in multiple interviews I've had people ask about my classes and what I learned in them. I used that opportunity to show off a bit about what I know and the interviewer felt more comfortable talking about more technical aspects since he knew I could keep up.   If I was submitting my resume now that I've had a full time position I would take it off my resume because as you said it's fluff. As an undergrad applying for jobs though it was definitely relevant in the interview process. Also with a bit of reformatting you could add it no problem without having to remove anything you have now."
EngineeringStudents,3bx5zu,_emmaloo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:20:23 2015 UTC,"I usually recommend having a ""Relevant Courses"" section under the ""Education"" section. Don't list things that everyone takes like Calc I or Physics I, but list more specialized classes like Materials or something (I'm a computer engineer, so I don't know good chemical engineering classes to give you as examples.)   Some people like to include an objective or summary statement at the top of their resume. This statement can say what you're particularly interested in within your major and what kind of job you're looking to have when you graduate. If you know what you want to do, it's a good thing to include. If you have no idea yet, I wouldn't include this statement.  For what you have already, make sure you keep the tenses of your verbs the same for each entry. I think it's good until you get to the Undergraduate Research Assistant one. Some of your statements are in present tense and some are in past tense, so I would change them all to be the same. For that same entry, you don't ever say what your outcome of the research was. You should consider adding another bullet to do that.  Hope that helps some (:"

Entry ranks are fun, and are a composite of a bunch of things.  The easiest one is the STAT test, which even if you get a below average mark will boost your entry rank further.  If you don't have any qualifications in maths, they may not accept you. I did a six month course at TAFE and that was more than enough to get me in (although I have to do further remedial math once class starts).  You may or may not need to do this.  Best thing would be to talk to the university itself.  I just walked in one day and went straight to student services, where a very helpful young lady pointed me in the right direction.    So whether or not you need to do this I cannot answer, but your trade is definitely going to be a bonus for applying, and possible count towards some credit points that may let you graduate earlier."

EngineeringStudents,3bvjmn,excursionist,3,Thu Jul 2 14:29:56 2015 UTC,"It's mostly algebra, though knowing how to analyze maxima and minima/graphically integrate will make it easier to understand sheer and moment diagrams."
EngineeringStudents,3bvjmn,PUBspotter,2,Thu Jul 2 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly after you take all your calc classes, you rarely use it quite as in depth. Even as a third year phd candidate in mechanical focusing on dynamics and FEA (solid mechanics FEA specifically) I still don't use much calculus regularly. And when I do, it's either just a power rule derivative, chain/product rule, regular old integration, integration by parts, or a dot/cross product. Anything more complicated and you use a calculator/matlab. Chemes at my undergrad used to have to do a ton of ODEs out by hand, but other than deriving stuff in class I rarely came across it.  So yeah, like everyone else said, undergrad solid mechanics doesn't really use any calculus other than shear/moment diagrams (which are just basic power rule/integration), or Castigliano (again, basic power rule). It's always a good idea to make sure you're familiar with the basics though, so if you're bored and motivated it won't hurt. Though I always strongly recommend improving coding skills over math, because eventually in your studies and the real world that will be much more useful."
EngineeringStudents,3bvjmn,orange2o,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"My experience was there was a little bit of calc towards the end. Converting force to torque to bending angle to displacement can be done algebraically if you know the formulas well, but each one is the indefinite integral of the previous, so knowing how to integrate is a good way to double check your answer."
EngineeringStudents,3bvjmn,bigscience87,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"You should review calc. Beam theory, deflections, shear/moment diagrams, etc. will be easier if you remember your basic calc."
EngineeringStudents,3bvjmn,lopsiness,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"For me there was a small section that went over integration of materials that varied in thickness. The other calc component was determining equations of shear/moment/deflection by integrating the previous equation. It was all pretty straight forward as far of calc was concerned and the hard part was setting up the problem correctly.  The harder part of the class was working with the geometry of a 3D problem, so good bases in trig and algebra were required."
EngineeringStudents,3bvjmn,DSice16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:56:27 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're going to be looking at deflections? If you're doing Castigliano's Theorem or Singularities you're going to be doing a lot of basic integration (reverse power rule). It's nothing too bad though.
EngineeringStudents,3bvjmn,brickrickslick,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially when it comes to elastic curves (deflected shapes). Its usually basic integration but they can get really messy. Didn't you use integration to find centroids and moment of inertias in statics?"

EngineeringStudents,3bv10m,mikey_the_kid,2,Thu Jul 2 13:07:56 2015 UTC,"You could start by listing out all the things you've learned in your classes that apply to the internship you're applying for.  Make a detailed resume and cover letter with excellent grammar and spelling. It's all about proving you can handle a detailed task, you're willing to put work into it, and you care about details.  Add some examples of your work as attachments. Popsicle stick bridge? What calculations did you do to support your design? Take some pictures of it!"
EngineeringStudents,3bv10m,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"Well, you can start by putting the popsicle stick bridge as a project I suppose (make sure to note if it was one of the best in class or what not, what your role was in the project, etc.).  Also any summer jobs or even campus jobs are good to put on there, as it shows that you aren't just loafing it all summer, you're putting in an effort to stay busy during your free time.  When your resume sparse in terms of experience, usually you fill it up with relevant coursework, computer/machine shop/lab skills, any extracurriculars you're involved in, and even high school achievements (high school GPA, AP classes, clubs, sports teams, etc.).  In the meantime you should look for ways to put more quality projects and experience on your resume, so look for a jobs (engineering or non-engineering), look for engineering related clubs (formula SAE is the most common one, even for a BME student it helps since you're working in an engineering capacity with a group of other engineering students, also look at stuff like EWB), and also research (approach your professors and ask if they need any help in their research lab, do some basic googling to see what their research interests are beforehand though)."

Why go into anything else without a little research?"

What really kicks people's butts in schools is time management.  Learn to spread your work out and work ahead on projects and homework.  If you get behind in college, it's really hard to get back ahead and often people tank.  Work on projects weeks ahead of the deadline, finish homework multiple days early.  That's how I was able to do well in school, finishing work before deadlines."

EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,DSice16,2,Thu Jul 2 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"Since GPA is so important in HS, I'd suggest taking the AP courses in HS only if the profs are pretty good. You don't wanna risk losing your eligibility for acceptance to an engineering school just because you were trying to get a leg up.  If the profs aren't infamous, go ahead and take at least AB calc (BC if you really like it) and Physics C. AP Chem might be just excessive because you don't need to know a lot about chemistry in ME, and for PE they'll have a specific required chem class for you.  A lot of schools want to teach you their way of doing things. It's not as pointless as it sounds, though, because they may include something in their calc 1 and 2 classes that are required for their calc 3, and if you use a BC credit to pass out of 1 and 2 you could be fucked in 3. (Plus retaking classes gets you a solid GPA hold your first semester in college which is important (trust me I got a 2.5 and have been busting my ass to make up for it ever since))"
EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,DSice16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"Wow,  thanks for the advice. I had never really thought of the importance of the teachers. With that in mind I will definitely not be taking AP Chem due to the possibility of constant exchange of new teachers throughout the year (it has been a big problem with finding new science teachers). However, AP physics sounds like a good idea to catch me up again in that area. I will only be able to take calculus AB in high school but that should be enough.  Thanks again, I've also thought of the idea of going to a community college first (I'm not the most financially gifted as some others) to get my basics all finished and see if OU will transfer certain classes. On a side note, I'm not entirely sure on whether to attend Texas A&M or OU for a PE or ME degree due to both colleges being in a fairly close range. What's do you think of this? Thanks"
EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,ertlun,3,Thu Jul 2 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"This is something I wish I'd learned way earlier in my college career: the professor is everything. When making your schedules, always ALWAYS go after the best professors and not best times. Because there are some very shitty profs. At my college, one prof had an average of a 42 on a test and the other prof had like an 85. Just insane ranges between prof averages. Do your research before registering!  I've heard good things about OU, but I'm an aggie so GIG EM! I've had a great experience here. Also, the greatest thing about getting an aggie diploma is the network it opens up. You walk into an interview with an aggie ring on and your interviewer has one too, you automatically have a leg up on all other applicants.   As far as disciplines go, I know that now you just get put in general engineering your first year for calcs and physics and intro to engineering classes, then after your first year you apply for a discipline. So if you choose A&M I'm going to super mega extra suggest you take AB calc and physics C in high school and then retake them your freshman year. That way you should make A's or B's in all 4 (calc 1, 2 and physics 1, 2) which will set you apart and give you a better chance of meeting the GPA reqs got engineering disciplines.  As far as community college goes, that's fine too. You can knock out all your basic maths, physics, English, and even some electives and save some cash, then transfer your credits. Sticking with A&M info, you could talk with an advisor and see about what your chances would be if you went to Blinn for a year to save money. That way you can still even audit some classes at A&M campus to get a feel for if you'd prefer ME or PE.   If you have any more questions let me know! I'm starting my 4th year in tamu meen so I can probably answer anything you think of."
EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,DSice16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"Great, so how exactly do you go about researching certain professors' test scores? Would it just be located on the college website? Also by the network it opens up, do you mean availability of jobs once you're out of college? The GPA reqs are usually 3.0 as well if I'm not mistaken. Or I've just heard of certain engineers who simply had a 3.0 GPA and they were hired, haha.   As for taking calculus AB I have the option to take the AP test for that class however I've heard it's extremely hard. Would taking it in high school but not taking the AP exam be a dumb idea or it be just a good way to keep a good GPA in college?  Also, a good friend of mine's dad went to Texas A&M and would always call some community college there ""mini texas a&m"". Is that Blinn or is there actually a community college near A&M?   One more thing (sorry haha), I've been looking around online about people majoring in PE and they would always bring up the NEED to try to get an internship during the summer to get a feel for the field. How exactly would one go about getting an internship like that? Thanks for all the help, it's making college seem a lot less stressful than it seems and makes me feel better about what I want to pursue in."
EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,DSice16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"Average grades in each professor's class isn't something that the college will publicize, or that there's a straightforward way of getting reliable info on. Talk to people who attend the school, and have taken classes with those professors. If you can't do that, use ratemyprofessor.com. Don't go straight for the easiest-sounding professors: an easy A in calc 1 might sound great, but it'll screw you over in calc 2 if you didn't actually learn the material.  I can't help much with your other questions."
EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,mikemiz24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"You can't see specific test scores, but you can see the overall class averages and grade distribution. There are two ways you can see this:   Go to this site. I just found it recently and it is incredible. If you wanna look at the grades for Engineering Calc 1 (MATH151), you just type in MATH for the department and 151 for the course number. Then it gives you the class average for each prof at each semester, as well as the letter distributions for each prof for each semester. The official way, though, is to go through the registrar and select the year, semester and department you want. It's less pretty and graphical, but it is officially from the university so it's more trustworthy I suppose. (again, these are for A&M only. I'd suggest going to the OU subreddit if you would like to ask them these questions)   What I mean by 'The A&M network' is just the general job market that would be available to you. We have one of the biggest career fairs in the country every September, and another one in the Spring. Reed Arena is literally packed full of hundreds of companies for you to learn more about, submit resumes, and learn of opportunities. There are constantly companies coming on campus to learn more about students and extend their interest to potential interns and full time students. We have such a diverse faculty that consists of researchers and past employees from pretty much any company type of which you can think. We have nearly (if not over) 1000 student organizations (not all engineering specific of course) that help students connect with others and build a network of other Aggies. The list goes on and on.  I have not heard officially what the GPA reqs are, so you probably know more than me!  No that would not be a dumb idea. In my opinion, AP classes are all about exposure to material. Obviously if it's something like English, Government, Economics, History, etc. (things that are not specifically related to your major but are required by the university for graduation), you're gonna wanna take the AP test to pass out. But for classes related to your major, the exposure is worth more than the credit. So taking the AP test is up to you. They are kinda expensive now, though, so if money is tight and you're going to retake it at your university, I wouldn't bother.  Blinn is the mini Texas A&M. You cannot get a BS degree from Blinn, only an Associate's. Pretty much 9/10 of the people at Blinn are saving money and knocking out general courses (like the English, Gov, Eco, etc) before transferring to A&M.  Internships are really not that hard to get. My GPA fluctuates between about a 3.0 and a 3.2 and I'm currently sitting at my desk for my second internship (one after sophomore year, this one after junior). The career fairs I mentioned above are excellent resources you won't find at another university. Just the immense company exposure is priceless in itself. For PEs; I'm ME so I'm not 100% sure, but I do know they aren't the biggest Engineering major, but they're one of the most sought after. Usually they have a hiring rate of something like 97% within 3 months of graduation, but with the industry so hurt right now that number's dropped (but should be back up to normal numbers by the time you graduate). You can also meet with advisor's and the career center to help you find an internship if you'd like some extra assistance. Resources are endless!  Sorry it took me a few days to respond. I've been out of town for the fourth and wanted to be able to link you things from my computer. Hope this is helpful! Really, don't hesitate to ask any other questions you have :)"
EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,mikemiz24,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:07:18 2015 UTC,"If I had to choose between OU or Texas A&M, I would with no hesitation take A&M due to the opportunities it holds. The main problem would be the tuition costs. My family isn't the most financially gifted so they can't pay my way through college as some other families can. The costs are extremely higher for non-residents of Texas (me being in Oklahoma) at about $40,000. Even with Blinn for the first year or two, the rest of A&M would be hard to come by. I feel my only option would be to (somehow) get a full-ride there or try to get as many other scholarships as possible. I would be very dependent on a paid internship as well during summer.   What would you suggest I do in this situation? Just see what scholarships I can obtain until the time comes or go to a community college in Oklahoma such as OCCC and then attend OU?  Also, just a side note, I was recommended to check out https://www.spe.org/twa/print/ for an overview of the current state of petroleum engineers right now, what do you think about it?"
EngineeringStudents,3bvbba,JewFroGorilla,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"See, I hate giving advice about money because my family has it. My parents have been able to pay my tuition and board and everything loan free for all 3 years so far. Of course, it's easy for me to say just take out a loan- education is important, and you're making an investment. Also, I can't help but think paying it off shouldn't be too too hard if you graduate with an engineering degree- especially PE since they usually make around 100k+ after their first year.  Paid internships will usually make you somewhere from 6000-12000 depending on your company. I'm making 1000/week right now and it's for 8 weeks, but taxes take out like 25% (that can be recovered in your tax return!). Also, it's very easy to find a job on campus, and because you're employed by a university, the taxes taken out are very small.  Transferring into tamu, especially the engineering schools, is going to be very tough. Because our admittance rate is so high, they often require a GPA of around 3.5 to transfer directly into an engineering discipline. I'd really suggest emailing one of the tamu advisors if you'd like more specific advice on transferring from another university, transferring from Blinn, or Blinn-team opportunities for Engineers (Blinn team is like a blinn/tamu hybrid where you take some classes at blinn, some at tamu, and then you transfer into tamu after your first year or two).  Scholarships are everywhere too dude. I didn't look very hard because I'm well off (and spoiled), but I know from friends that there are so many little ones all over the place that nobody even knows about. I have a friend that found some diabetes tennis scholarship that was something like 1000/yr and he was the only one who applied... So do research and look around! Obviously OU is a great school too, and if that ends up being what you have to do, don't be upset or disappointed. You will have a job after graduating, and after integration into the working world, your university will become less and less important as you gain experience."

Our course is mostly general but we did have specializations last semester and I took Telecommunication as mine.  The most important thing is YOU HAVE TO ABSOLUTLEY LOVE MATHS!  All engineering disciplines will require a lot of math but the common opinion at my university is that E&E has the toughest math. You will also have to be willing to put in more hours than most other courses. It sucks (especially first year when everbody else is partying and meeting new people) but you eventually get used to the workload.  As for the difficulty, if you work hard and regularly you should be fine. A lot of our maths and physics look intimidating but if you put in the work you'll see it gets easier the more you practice. First year maths always caused us nightmares. At this point in my course I often joke that by the time a problem reduces to just math I consider the problem over!  Compared to other courses I'll be honest, I think we're one of the toughest. After my 3rd year I stopped thinking that medical or actuarial sciences are notably more difficult than us. In engineering I consider mechanical (probably mechatronic also) to be tougher than E&E (Chemical/process might also give us a run for it. The general opinion at my university is that they have a greater workload but less intellectually challenging content).  I think E&E engineering is one of the more fun engineeing disciplines to study because we can relatively easily apply our work practically and see the results (you can solder a circuit for a practical period, you can't build a bridge!). I know some universities don't focus on the practical application but the most fun I've had over the years was the feeling of joy when an antenna or sound amplifier works after hours of math and soldering!

Consider what you like about areas of physics and chemistry. What are you interested in? Now put that in the back of your head, focus on what you want to do after graduation. You may not know and will probably change your mind, but this is a good way to pick a major.  For instance, I loved power. To get into the power industry, you should be an electrical or a mechanical. If you are specifically interested in fuel sources or energy storage, chemical isn't a bad path either, but most people at the end of their secondary education don't know that too well.  You will take general courses in your first two years before specialized courses anyways.  Since you suggested mechatronic and electrical, I can assume you are interested in robotics. Depending on your school, you can take electrical engineering courses geared towards robotics.  As you said EE is broad. It is not all about hardware. My university offers upper level electives in power, electronics, digital systems, communications, computer architecture, electromagnetics, controls, and signal processing.

EngineeringStudents,3btql4,KaptainKielbasa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"I apologize for the long response. A lot of what you are asking is really going to depend on the school you choose and the specifics of each program. Let me start by saying I will be finishing my undergrad this summer as a triple degree in Chemical engineering, Geoscience, and German studies. I have known several people who have done double degree with a double major, and just a few other with triple degrees.  It is possible to manage and make it happen, but you may have to get creative and figure out how much time you can commit to this. I am not surprised that your uni gave you vague and unhelpful answers. Mine was not helpful so I had to figure everything out myself.  Most of it just came down to making sure I had enough credits and satisfied the requirements. It also helped that many of my classes were able to satisfy requirements for all three. The math, physics and chem classes I took counted towards both my engineering and geoscience. So yes, some crossovers are allowed but you have to be careful. I would be happy to explain it more in detail of you are interested  Can you enroll as undecided engineering? That way you can take some classes in each field and see what you like best before choosing. You might wish to consider doing a double major within engineering as electrical with computer or mechanical. Or pick one and consider doing a concentration. Mechatronics seems like there would be a lot of overlap between the engineering fields.  There definitely will be some crossover with the sciences and engineering. For chemical, our requirements are in such a way that we also meet the requirements for chemistry minor, or at least one class off. The same thing kind of goes for all our engineers with math; one or two more classes and you have a minor. Then to go from a minor to a major is just a few more classes.  Engineering is difficult and time consuming, but that shouldn’t be the reason for not doing something. If you are really interested in engineering and like it, then go for it. If it turns out you don’t like it and makes you utterly miserable, then run like hell and find something you enjoy."

I'm currently in my second last year of high school and I'm wondering what engineering major I should choose.   whichever one you want. the wiki page may be helpful  chemical engineering: chemist get juice from an orange, while a chemical engineer figures out how juice 100 oranges.  civil engineering: build static stuff (bridges, roads, buildings, etc.)   electrical engineering: i'll throw in computer science in here as well. electrical engineering and computer science operate on a spectrum. on one side, it's purely physical (developing computer chips). on the other side, it's purely code (programming). in the middle, you have code (software) controlling hardware.   mechanical: essentially, whatever's left over from the other fields. mechanical engineers are the generalists.   aerospace: specialty of mechanical that focuses on airplanes/rockets.   industrial: optimizing stuff. lots of modeling and math. how do you make things more efficient, etc.   mechatronics: smack dab btwn mechanical and electrical. do you want to build the physical robot, or figure out how to control it?   nuclear: bombs (not so much), reactors: fission (splitting atoms) and research fusion - joining atoms.    So, for example, I could take some of the most basic physics courses such as mechanics, etc., and have it count for both engineering and physics, and things like linear algebra, diffeq, etc., could count for all three. Is that how crossover works? I asked the uni this question, but their answer was awfully vague and unhelpful.   typically engineering majors take 2 years of math(s). math majors will go on and take more math classes. physics typically branches off to the very small (quantum mechanics) or the very large (astrophysics). engineering covers everything in btwn.    Furthermore, I constantly see people on this subreddit saying engineering is extremely difficult and time consuming   it is.    law and medicine much more difficult   in the US, law is competitive. you need to go to the 14 best law schools. medicine is rigorous and requires a significant amount of time commitment (in the US, it's 4 years of college + 4 years of more school + 3-7 years of apprenticeship before you're finally a ""real doctor""). with engineering, (in the US) you're good to go after a 4 year degree.   you ask a good question. however, it's broad so it requires a long response."
EngineeringStudents,3btql4,various_failures,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:52:27 2015 UTC,"I looked at the wikipedia page - control engineering seemed to be quite interesting.  So you're basically telling me there will indeed be a lot of crossover? That should make things a lot easier.  Over here, med and law are extremely difficult to get into; only about the top 0.3% of people are able to go into an undergrad med degree, and about 0.5% for law. Engineering is more like the top 10%. (I'm talking about the top uni in the state though.)"

EngineeringStudents,3btql4,LeighmurBJJ,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:45:21 2015 UTC,One of the reasons med and law are extremely difficult to get into is probably because significantly more people want to go into those fields than engineering.   Someone once told me that many people go to law school when they don't know what else to do.

EngineeringStudents,3bry8c,instamine777,75,Wed Jul 1 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on this whole college thing.  This attitude - if you will - made me quite successful during my college days.  It might not be an idealistic attitude, but pragmatism is a better trait for an engineer in my opinion.  No one - not even the 4.0 GPA geniuses - are going to retain everything you learn in college.  College classes are to give you two things:  the skills to learn how to learn something and a general overview of the things you need to know to not be completely lost on your first day in the industry.  What's more important than 100% retention is to retain bits & pieces of information so that you have an idea where to begin your search when the information is needed in the future.  For example, in 20 years when your boss asks you to do something new and then you run into a problem with something you've forgotten, you'll remember, ""Oh, I remember something about this from college.  Let me find that old textbook...""  ""Data dumps"" after a class - as I call them, when I forget a bunch of stuff - are perfectly fine.  I can't tell you at all how to do a DO-sag model problem from environmental engineering, for example, but I remember that DO-sag model problems are a thing and if I'm ever dealing with pollution and water one day, I'll know to refresh my memory on it and where to go.  That being said, tests and homeworks are a challenge to be overcome in the moment.  I always planned my study sessions to lead straight into exams or tests.  I took notes in class in a fashion that I was creating my study sheets - don't write every word, write important equations and such.  I would then refine those note sheets the night before an exam.  I would then study those equation sheets and example problems 4 hours before every exam going right into the exam.  The goal was to have it so fresh in my mind that I could easily copy it over to my scratch paper.  Now, that being said, there are some things you'll develop a deep understanding of during your college days.  For me, as a structural engineering major, I can churn out a bending moment diagram or deflection analysis in all kinds of structures with little effort.  That's because I keep doing them in every class I take.  Every single problem - from statics to graduate level prestressed concrete - starts with a bending moment diagram, so I really know how to do them.  You'll develop your own deep understanding of topics based on your major as well.  Just keep those other things from your other classes in the back of your mind in case you need them.  Summary   Treat each test as a challenge.  Overcome it, learn and retain bits and pieces of the information so you know where to look in the future if you ever need that information again. Take notes as if they are study/equation sheets.  Refine those notes.  Study right before exams to have the information as fresh in your mind as possible. The stuff you need to know, you'll learn.  It'll be in all of your classes.  The stuff you don't need to know so much, don't worry about it if you forget some of it.   Hope this helps!  Good luck to you!"

I found that the biggest waste of time I had when studying was setting aside to do study, but not actually using it. The Pomodoro technique, already mentioned in another comment, is nice because it keeps you from burning out.  Also, always study stuff on your own and attempt to work problems BEFORE going to a group session.

EngineeringStudents,3bry8c,sauceysalmon,5,Wed Jul 1 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"For me it's all about motivation. If I'm not in the mood or I'm too busted I won't make out the most of my cave sessions. When I do, I can sit for about 8 hours or more quite happily, mixing theory with exercises to make it more appealing.  I do not fathom study without a computer screen in front of my face, to show my pdfs and some music (speakers only, I find headphones too inmersive). Plus, the web browser always open (in case I need a short 5-min break to check reddit) and my dear HP-50g emulator always on top.  I also need tons of space, and I would like to stress its importance. Sort your notes and spread them around the room (floor and bed even). My mind gets narrow and less creative if it doesn't find the papers somewhere (this is very important when doing exercises). I don't do tidiness at all.  Stay hydrated.  If you have the whole day for your study, save about 3 hours minimum to do what you want, as long as once you do it, you go back to the desk inmediately. Having dinner or launch? Fire up that new episode, lad!  It may sound a bit slizzy but that's my method. I'm sure there's something you can use. Good luck and don't forget to obey the laws of Thermodynamics."

EngineeringStudents,3bry8c,CripCrip,4,Fri Jul 3 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what REALLY turned my grades around and wished somebody had told me years ago, its all about efficiency by frequency and outrunning the curriculum.  For example, say you're in a tough math class. Don't do one major chunk of studying; i don't know about you guys but memory retention from blocks of studying hasn't been that wonderful for me, and I don't much like the long hauling through problems as its a quick way to burn out... fuck that noise.  Do the problems, and the shit you didn't already know.. write on a separate piece of paper. Basically, jot down the main idea which applies everywhere, and learn from THIS rather than brute forcing the problems. Essentially, make a recording of the mechanics. ~ Later, study from this short-but-to-the-point information as frequent as possible. Not 15-30 minute sessions, just take a few minutes as often as you possibly can and soak it in. ~ Whenever you can't perfectly recall w/e you wrote down.. keep looking at it until its burnt into your memory. Later, roll into the ""same but different"" problems and see how you do. Judge from here what next to do. Either move on to new material or keep repeating.. but remember, don't forget to later come back and review, else you're going to lose the information.   Think Extremely often - Very often - Pretty often - casually.    Also, outrunning the curriculum is a major help to you. Go into the next few chapters and soak it in. Don't make notes yet, don't do anything except mentally absorb the information.. because later, you're going to recall it during the lecture and you're not coming from the perspective of ""what the fuck is this shit?""."

EngineeringStudents,3bry8c,parkerclayton,3,Thu Jul 2 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"Personally I like to keep a document that is easily accessible from my phone or laptop and update it every time I do something. If I study for an hour I write it down, if I do a project for 3 I write that down. Initially my goal was 10 full hours a week, then it was 15, and now it is a minimum 20 hours. Only time spent where I am completely focused counts. Classes and group meetings don't count. Some days I am able to work 4 hours straight, others only in 30 or even 15 minute increments. But at the end of every week I know if I slacked off or if I didn't.   I started doing this my freshman year of undergrad (I am now working on finishing my Masters in CEG) because as an athlete (I played D1 soccer) for my school we were required to do study table hours every week. It stuck with me and was my saving grace for many semesters."
EngineeringStudents,3bry8c,parkerclayton,3,Thu Jul 2 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"Think about applying Bezos's pizza method to study groups. If can't feed your study group with two pizzas, you have too many people. I'd go even further and say that if you only study with one or two people, it makes you more accountable and don't want to annoy or disappoint your study partner.   Furthermore, figure out who's the smartest and study with them. They will certainly have questions still and sometimes even though you might not be the smartest, you'll understand some concepts better than they do. No one will understand or retain everything."
EngineeringStudents,3bry8c,vincently,3,Thu Jul 2 05:33:21 2015 UTC,"I found that for me, the key to a successful study session is location. I'm a firm believer in conditioning. The only time i spend in my bed is if i'm trying to fall asleep. If i'm in the computer lab, then i'm doing nothing but some form of work. I've found that separating study and relaxing areas is important. I can study at my desk at home, but its magnitudes less effective than packing my shit and going to the lab... or for that matter a coffee house. Find what environment works best for you, and do as much work as you can in that location.   A lot of the tips that I find are picked up from other, older students. The separation of home/work was from a phd student who talked about getting rid of his desk at home.  Another highly successful tactic that I would like to pass on is spreadsheets. For each class, go through the syllabus and create an excel spreadsheet that shows the breakdown of every point, and allows you to enter your grades. You might have something online that already records this, but make your own spreadsheet anyways. You will find that it will not only make it easier to keep track of your standing in the course, but the simple action of putting your grades into it will satisfy that desire that we all have for instant gratification.  My girlfriend is a hdfs major who never had a quarter gpa above 2.5 and usually averaged a 2.0. I put together a few spreadhsheets for her, and helped her stay on top of recording into them. The first term we did this, she was taking some of her most difficult classes, and pulled a 3.0. It really works, and is once again something that i picked up from an older student."

Your second point is interesting,  however I do not think I will have time to spend on a excel spreadsheet for each course. The courses are usually condensed as you know and our grades are posted online on Omnivox.   For each course I have a course outline/syllabus and I always follow it up, I usually use highlights on where I need to improve, focus on, or re-practice.  Maybe its the same concept is it?

EngineeringStudents,3bxhj2,unityskater,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:37:53 2015 UTC,Also the difficulty depends on what you're good at or not. If you can pick up programming easily then the intro class may not be too bad.   Also with the math side of things I think you made a good choice. I did calc 3 and diffeq at the same time and having 2 math classes made it easy to focus on math where when I only had one class my mind would be all over different subjects and math was always the one I focused on least (since it wasn't my favorite).   That's why I found school got a lot more interesting junior year once I got more concentrated in one area. Even in different classes things that you learn start to overlap and learning something in one class provides benefits in your others.

This allows you to deploy it in a more diverse array of settings making it more useful."
EngineeringStudents,3bteil,sir_joober,4,Thu Jul 2 03:55:09 2015 UTC,"It is definitely worth it to learn Python.  And it won't be very difficult if you know MATLAB, either.  Probably 2 or 3 days to be able to use the language comfortable, and probably another 3 or 4 days to get a fell for the Python way of doing things (called ""Pythonic"").  There are a bunch of advantages to learning Python:   In terms of basic data analysis, it has some extremely powerful tools that make complex data analysis very easy.  And it handles big data and distributed computing like nothing else.  Automatic broadcasting, views, complex structured data, multi-level labelled data, out-of-core processing, automatic background distributed computing, and other such tools that make data analysis much easier. It can do just about anything.  It is great for data analysis, but it can do a lot more.  It can automate boring, repetitive computer tasks for you, like organizing your files and folders.  It can let you manipulate text files and data files with ease.  It is the programming language of choice for many low-cost computers like the Rasberry Pi.  It can be used for making sophisticated, dynamic, resizable GUIs, as well as sophisticated, dynamic web interfaces. It encourages good programming practices.  Learning Python has actually made me a better MATLAB programmer, because it encouraged me to write well-organized, reusable, maintainable code, a skill that results in better MATLAB code as well. It will make it easy to switch to most other languages.  Python has most of the programming principles and data structures you are likely to encounter in other languages.  So once you know Python, learning another language is more a matter of learning the syntax for the principles know from Python, as well as whatever quirks the language may have (of course Python has its quirks as well). It will make you more marketable.  MATLAB is good within it niche, but pretty much useless outside of that niche.  Python is useful for just about everything, which gives you additional flexibility in what you can do in your job."

EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,ADickFullOfAsses,22,Thu Jul 2 07:09:55 2015 UTC,Ti-89 never having to do electrical calculations involving angles by hand is amazing. This is the only reason I passed electronics.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,LaughLax,14,Wed Jul 1 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"TI-36 will do the same for about 20 bucks, and is considered ""scientific"", so it's generally allowed on all tests."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,OSFitz,9,Wed Jul 1 19:19:00 2015 UTC,"I second this, particularly the TI 36x-Pro. It can do most things a TI-83 can do except graph - complex numbers, definite integrals, matrices (up to 3x3), LSE (again, up to 3x3).  And it's approved for use on the FE exam."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Crychair,7,Wed Jul 1 20:38:49 2015 UTC,Great advice.  Learn to use this model or something comparable so you don't freak out when they tell you that you can't use your TI-89 on the FE.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,ADickFullOfAsses,8,Wed Jul 1 21:46:25 2015 UTC,I don't think it will. There was a specific function I had to use that other ti's didn't have. But you know I don't really remember after a few years.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Triple_Felon,7,Wed Jul 1 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. It did me well during a non-major circuits class, but that was the extent of it. There's no denying the 89's power though. The solve function has saved my ass so many times."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Anon123212321,10,Wed Jul 1 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"Or do yourself a solid, and spend the same amount of cash on a TI NSpire CX CAS. It demolishes the 89, and doesn't cost much more if any at all."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Jorlung,3,Wed Jul 1 19:15:00 2015 UTC,"Just in case it's not obvious to some people, this is actually a really bad ""investment"" if you're not allowed to use graphing calculators in exams."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Jorlung,41,Wed Jul 1 22:39:23 2015 UTC,If you haven't taken DiffEqs yet get the Wolfram Alpha app for like $3 and it will probably be better for you than any solution manual you could possibly find.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,milkchococurry,12,Wed Jul 1 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"I'm taking this class next semester, so this is perfect timing :D"
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,not_perfect_yet,15,Wed Jul 1 16:20:06 2015 UTC,"It's pretty sweet. As long as you're doing simply ""Solve this DiffEq"" it is pretty much a complete replacement for a solution manual.  You just simply put in the equation. Then you can choose  1) Solve using variation of parameters  2) Solve using method of undetermined coefficients  3) Solve using laplace transforms  And then it gives you step-by-step solutions of each of these methods.  And further, the Wolfram Alpha app is still pretty sweet regardless."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,mniwrm,3,Wed Jul 1 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"And I'm taking DiffEq right now (started this week), so I guess I'll have to look into this."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,StoneHolder28,6,Wed Jul 1 20:17:11 2015 UTC,gamma.sympy.org has free step by step solutions btw.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,EngineerEddy,4,Wed Jul 1 21:01:23 2015 UTC,It is also sometimes offered for free on amazon as their free app of the day. With the 4th of July and amazons 20th anniversary coming up. It is likely they will have many apps for free. Good time to keep your eye out and maybe save $3.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,lopsiness,2,Thu Jul 2 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"It's my go to app for a lot of things, but I've had trust issues ever since it had trouble finding the volume of a revolved solid. I questioned my sanity for a week."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,nicholt,55,Thu Jul 2 05:18:46 2015 UTC,"A good suit.  I kid you not, you don't need to break the bank but just do some research on where to buy a good (budget) suit and how to get it tailored. It really makes a difference when the HR recruiting folks see mostly engineering students with oversized and ill conditioned suits all day.   Not to mention a good suit is good for 10 years (supposing you don't gain too much weight!), and it's good for more than just job hunting."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,tuckeriswilde,24,Wed Jul 1 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"Just to reiterate, an ok/budget suit that's well tailored is going to be far more impressive than an expensive suit that is not tailored."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,EngineerEddy,6,Wed Jul 1 17:45:53 2015 UTC,any brands you'd recommend?
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,gimpwiz,12,Wed Jul 1 16:23:57 2015 UTC,"Depends where you are and price range  There are some really modern, really nice suits shops in most big cities.  Here are some and their price ranges:   Suit Supply - Starts at around $400 J Crew - Starts around $500   Those are two of the more popular brands. If you're more interested in fits and what kinds to look for check out:  The First Suit Guide - /r/malefashionadvice"
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,EngineerEddy,3,Wed Jul 1 16:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yep I got a $400 Dark Grey Napoli suit from Suit Supply, great value, even if it is a bit pricey for a college student.   Then don't forget the tailoring, do some research online for good local tailors (usually I google ""insert city tailor"" and look for results from styleforum.net or askandyaboutclothes.com forums). Generally as long as the shoulders and suit length are reasonable, a good tailor can make you look like a superstar.  Also, the /r/frugalmalefashion subreddit has solid advice all around including suit buying guides for different price ranges such as this: https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1wab45/crowdsourcing_frugality_250_and_under_suits_read/"
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,424f42_424f42,8,Wed Jul 1 18:17:25 2015 UTC,"Meh. I wore a suit for none of the coops I got, nor for any full-time interviews afterwards. I am gonna get a suit now, though... for weddings."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Roamingkillerpanda,9,Wed Jul 1 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"The tech world is a bit different. A t-shirt, jeans, and flip-flops are suitable interview attire for a job there.  In fact my friend who interned at Palantir said they specifically tell you not to wear a suit to the interview.  More traditional manufacturing-based engineering companies (aero, automotive, O&G, etc.) expect suits though, and conversely I have friends who got rejected from interviews chiefly because they did not wear a suit (remember for many of these traditional engineering companies the first interview is by an HR recruiter, so they care about these things)."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,twinnedcalcite,3,Wed Jul 1 19:44:17 2015 UTC,"or, as i did, find a suit shop by you and wait for a sale. I got 2 suits for ~400 (original price tag online was that each)."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,DoctorDystopia,4,Wed Jul 1 18:43:05 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more with this comment. Head over to r/malefashionadvice if you want more advice on suit shopping.   Remember though, a well fitted suit will look much better than an expensive one that doesn't fit well."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,brokentofu,3,Thu Jul 2 00:20:41 2015 UTC,Non-iron shirts.  If you are really in a hurry hang the shirt up in the bathroom when you have a hot shower and they usually come straight out.  You let it dry and then put on the nice shirt that you didn't have to fight to iron.  They also travel well.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Catabre,2,Thu Jul 2 03:29:23 2015 UTC,This is great advice! Thanks :D

EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,OMGIMASIAN,4,Thu Jul 2 19:16:06 2015 UTC,I bought the Uni Kutu Toga and it has not disappointed me :)
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Squirmols,2,Wed Jul 1 21:55:13 2015 UTC,What do you recommend?
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,sharkdubs,8,Wed Jul 1 22:16:04 2015 UTC,Pentel GraphGear 1000. When I use a plastic pencil now it feels like I'm scratching at my paper with stick.  Amazon for around $11.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Alexandurr,4,Wed Jul 1 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"Rotring 600 is my pick. It's 30 dollars, but it's a solid metal pencil that feels great in my hand for writing. Head over to r/pencils there is some info on a lot of different drafting pencils there"
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Squirmols,2,Thu Jul 2 00:28:47 2015 UTC,"To add on, make sure to get a drafting pencil. Which is basically a higher quality mechanical pencil."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Alexandurr,33,Thu Jul 2 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"My Surface Pro 3 has been amazing. It is small enough to not be too cumbersome, but big enough to be useful to me. The specs I opted for are enough to run my programs like CAD and Visual Analysis plus whatever else I have needed for my Civil degree. I understand that they are a lot of money and other devices do similar stuff, but I've been impressed and quite pleased with it."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Twosdai,4,Wed Jul 1 15:16:36 2015 UTC,Looks really cool! I'm actually saving some money to get a notebook on my birthday and the Surface Pro looks like a good option. Thanks!
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,commanderkull,7,Wed Jul 1 16:28:43 2015 UTC,You won't regret it.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,sharkdubs,5,Wed Jul 1 17:34:23 2015 UTC,What specs do you have? My professor is convinced my i5 is too weak and I need to upgrade.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Alexandurr,10,Wed Jul 1 16:27:33 2015 UTC,I have the i5 with 8GB of ram. Runs CAD with very little problems. It acts like normal computers in the sense that the larger the file/job gets in autocad the slower it will go. That's expected though.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,jonmon22,4,Wed Jul 1 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Cool, I have the same one. That's good to hear."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,aijalone,3,Wed Jul 1 18:10:07 2015 UTC,Yall need to jump onto the I7 boat. Thing of beauty. has a nicer internal graphics card too.

EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,MrRedSeedless,4,Thu Jul 2 09:57:12 2015 UTC,I have the i3 and have yet to run into any issues. I do have a desktop though that I use for anything intensive. For a buck a month though I can remotely access that PC from anywhere though which also helps.

EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Anon123212321,2,Wed Jul 1 21:31:32 2015 UTC,What do you recommend
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Wir3mu,3,Wed Jul 1 22:17:37 2015 UTC,On the cheaper side there is the Pentel P203/5/7/9 or a Uni Kuru Toga or on the expensive side a Pentel Graph Gear 1000. I have the 0.3mm versions of each and find that a good 2B lead seems to write the best and have enough contrast on paper.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,hardolaf,6,Thu Jul 2 04:31:06 2015 UTC,Good desk chair and a few extra monitors really helped.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,minipink212,6,Wed Jul 1 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"In your opinion, how many monitors would make a perfect setup for work and gaming?"
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,hardolaf,5,Wed Jul 1 18:16:43 2015 UTC,Three is perfect for me. But I'd recommend two if your short on desk space.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,minipink212,3,Wed Jul 1 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"I've been running two monitors for four years now, and I've never had a major issue with playing games or programming as long as I'm not doing both at once.  So two is perfectly fine if you ask me.  Plus you run two with a laptop, not just a PC.  In that same vein, I'm upgrading to three monitors so I can watch videos WHILE programming or gaming at once.  One for video, one for main, one for additional things to support main activity."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,mastermindwoof,3,Wed Jul 1 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Like the others here, I think a good number is two.  I got a second monitor early last school year and it's been such a good investment. Mind you, the monitors I have aren't even that big (laptop monitor is 14"", external monitor is 23""), but I was able to display all of the work I need all at once, or have my programming/physics/bio/whatever up on one screen and have my videogames/anime/Smash tourneys with my roommates on the other.  I was so enamored with it that one of my roommates 'suggested' that I get enough monitors to create a bubble around my desk. I'm legitimately thinking of getting another. I bet I can do a whole bunch with three monitors haha."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,tbpimaster,5,Wed Jul 1 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"I use two. Main one is 27"" at 1440p, though I'll upgrade that to 4K when something large enough comes out so text is reasonably large. I'll usually snap MATLAB to the left or right and my text editor to the other side; that's really the only programming I do. The larger space is helpful for when I have to use AutoCAD, and 1440p is pretty nice for games, and not too terribly expensive.  The other is a 21.6"" 1080p, I just stick a PDF or browser in there, or play stuff from Netflix/Youtube if I'm just mindlessly drawing/programming/gaming. It's probably smaller than what most people like to get but I like the high pixel density since I usually sit pretty close to my desk.  If I were only going to use 1080p monitors, I'd get 3. I find that there's barely too little space for me to snap stuff to left/right edges and not have to scroll to see a full page at a reasonable size."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,amped2424,2,Wed Jul 1 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"Three, especially if you're also using them for gaming and intend to use AMD Eyefinity. Obviously you also need to think about desk space, although considering this is /r/engineeringstudents, you can probably figure something out if it turns out you don't have enough desk space."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,tryingtograsp,2,Wed Jul 1 22:41:56 2015 UTC,"IMO just one monitor is best, but an ultrawide one (2560*1080) , 29"" or bigger. It fits 2 word, web or cad models very well and doesn't have the annoying black lines in between screens. It also doesn't require you to turn your head as much."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,amped2424,19,Thu Jul 2 09:51:49 2015 UTC,"A good nights rest.  After that, test equipment, a good bed, good shoes, good clothes, improved computer. Tools are always good just like a good bed.  I may be thinking of sleep too much..."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,ElXGaspeth,10,Wed Jul 1 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously on the sleep. Make it a priority, so that when you schedule your homework, you do it early on rather than at 2 am when you are tired.  It also helps since sleep helps you retain information.  Plus sleeping in class/skipping reflects poorly on you to your professors, and there's nothing worse than being exhausted during an exam. I've seen classmates pass out during exams from pulling all nighters!"
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,dbu8554,3,Wed Jul 1 16:16:02 2015 UTC,"I have the opposite problem, I don't sleep at night. Never have. I usually don't get tired even in total darkness in the wilderness until like 2 am. So I hate anything before 10 am. Thankfully my earliest class this upcoming semester is at 11 am so I'm good!"
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Crychair,2,Wed Jul 1 17:41:23 2015 UTC,Sleep is sleep! I agree on hating morning classes though....

EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Insanity_-_Wolf,2,Thu Jul 2 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"I love my 558s. Are the 598s open or closed back? I love the open back on the 558s for listening, and they are generally good enough to block out noise around me."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Insanity_-_Wolf,2,Thu Jul 2 20:56:24 2015 UTC,I think they're open. I'm leaning more towards the Bose QuietComfort 25's now though even though they're more expensive. I don't want to hear shit in the library so noise canceling seems like the way to go for me

EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,Insanity_-_Wolf,3,Wed Jul 1 22:11:24 2015 UTC,Free tuition in the UK? I'm assuming you're either scottish or on a ridiculous bursary?
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,dufcdarren,2,Thu Jul 2 02:29:20 2015 UTC,Scottish. Also a £1750 bursary on top.
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,HydraulicFractaling,2,Thu Jul 2 08:34:35 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's a sweet deal.  I'm studying in England and 3 years is costing me around $70,000.  It's a hell of a lot cheaper than the US but it's definitely not free.  Even local students pay nearly £10,000 per year."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,dufcdarren,2,Thu Jul 2 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"The actual price for a Scottish student is £1850 roughly, per year.  This however is covered for all eligible students (i.e. people doing their first degree) by the Government, so I pay zero tuition.  I take a £5750 loan which is added to a £1750 grant, giving me £750 a month over 9 months (1st is a double payment of £1500 so 10 payments over 9 months)  Can't really complain."
EngineeringStudents,3br1ma,dufcdarren,2,Thu Jul 2 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"$70,000 for 3 years is not a hell of a lot cheaper than most US students."

I TA'd the class when I was in school - very cool program and you can do some really useful stuff with it with very simple concepts. If you actually understand programming concepts (concepts like counters and how a queue works in programming contexts) then you can do some even crazier stuff.  @OP Gimme a shout if you want to do arena, I probably have some notes left over in my email.  Also, Arena for students is free to download/install. It's just limited and you can't use it for actual work purposes  EDIT: Though, in retrospect, if you don't understand the probabilities stuff behind the models it probably won't be super useful for you."

EngineeringStudents,3bwwk8,lightningheels,4,Thu Jul 2 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"What? You've got it all wrong; there's absolutely no reason to prepare for lack of sleep -- the only people that pull all-nighters or close to all-nighters are people with poor time management or an obsession for a 4.0 gpa (which works against them since they're all theory and no hands on skills). You absolutely SHOULD NOT sacrifice your health to succeed in engineering; moreover, you do not have to do that to succeed in engineering. Exercise, get some sleep, eat some decent food, and that will help your health and your brain.  This is why I can't stand some of the engineering stereotypes. Yeah, engineering's hard, but if you use your time right it shouldn't encompass your whole existence. Instead of ""preparing"" for sleep deprivation take up running, or programming, or piano...just something that isn't in response to the engineering circlejerk."

Part of being an engineering student is working hard but if you want to be an engineer, you'll be working hard for the rest of your life. This being said, do not compromise your health or happiness. You will be miserable and you won't last long if you forget about either of those.  Manage your time, work hard when you can, have fun when you can, and for the love of god, get rest."
EngineeringStudents,3bwwk8,unityskater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:56 2015 UTC,Late nights working don't have to be a thing unless you have poor time management. Honestly most of my late nights were due to me fucking around and doing dumb shit with friends which happened very frequently my freshman year. The other portion of late nights were because I procrastinated too much. I only pulled 2 all nighters for school through my 4 years and both of those were my last semester senior year after I had gotten a job and fucked around too much.

They suck  in college and you'll be glad you did, wish I did. But again don't go crazy with the ap classes. You've got a solid resume for high school and should have no problem with getting in to a good college.

EngineeringStudents,3bspcp,thezohann,2,Wed Jul 1 20:56:29 2015 UTC,"It would definitely depend on what you'd focus on in your selected MS coursework.  If you're interest is in aerospace structures, I would say that a background in Civil sets you up well for mechanics-based coursework. You'd just have some catching up to do with thin-walled structures and, honestly, this is just one class that is very basic level stuff you'd already have some exposure to in Civil. If the MS program allows you to select any courses to meet your credit hour requirement then it would be no big deal. However, some programs require you to take ""core classes"" which could include some classes on systems engineering, aerodynamics, and/or controls which you likely would not have much experience in due to your Civil background.  As far as job opportunities are concerned, many of the entry-level stress analyst positions at Boeing, Lockheed, etc., list desired majors as Aerospace, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering. So, if that's what you want to do, you'd be well served to have both on your resume (not to mention fairly competitive because of it).  This is just my 2 cents. Honestly, outside of the structures realm I'm not sure what impact (dis/advantage) this would be for you."

EngineeringStudents,3brqzo,pyzparticle,5,Wed Jul 1 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"Its arguable whether or not officially joining the actual organization is helpful because the most significant benefit (IEEE published papers) should be provided by your school anyway. But the student membership is only like 30 bucks and there are loads of benefits other than papers.   More importantly, most schools also have an IEEE club or ""student chapter"" affiliated with the organization. It really depends on the school, but our IEEE club had a private lab, equipment, classes, industry events. It was also a more close-knit circle of people in our major so we did homework, studied for tests, and prepared for labs together. Undergrad was just an easier and more fulfilling experience because of IEEE. While I doubt many IEEE chapters have the kind of physical facilities we had, I still highly recommend you look into it."
EngineeringStudents,3brqzo,Anton338,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, all of this. However, even if your school doesn't have a local chapter, you'll still receive emails about professional events in your region and magazines that are pretty relevant to the industry."

AP credits shouldn't factor in at all, as they do not fit into your last 60 major credits for your BS.  So to answer your exact question, no, I was not able to use AP credit.   I also have never heard of AP credits covering any major classes - physics 1, 2, 3, calc 1, 2, 3, chemistry, biology, history, statistics, and econ aren't major classes.   https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse    None of those would be listed as a major Aero course."

EngineeringStudents,3bs4cv,seaslugs,3,Wed Jul 1 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. MSE is a broad field and includes specializations in metals, composite materials, energy, biomaterials, and semiconductors/electronic materials. You could work at foundries, aerospace companies, energy companies, bio research, Intel, etc."
EngineeringStudents,3bs4cv,unityskater,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"I would definitely say so you touch topics of all different fields in MSE which is pretty awesome.  Honestly in my biased opinion I would look into metallurgy. Because it's not as ""sexy"" as the other fields of MSE there is a severe lack of young people going into that field and it's very top heavy age wise compared to almost any other engineering field.   As someone who at first wanted to chemE, metallurgy was awesome because it's still very chemistry dependent but only in the sense that you know how different elements would effect a metal. There's no x+y=z reactions but you still learn about the positive and negative effects about why certain compounds form in a metal and why it can be beneficial/detrimental"
EngineeringStudents,3bs4cv,EngineerEddy,5,Fri Jul 3 08:08:57 2015 UTC,"They're just really different subjects in general.   MSE, at the undergrad level, is not too math intensive, at least not compared to ChemE (although maybe I'm just buying what some of my ChemE friends are groveling about too much). Usually Calc 3 and Difeq are still required, but you'll find that you rarely if ever use them (for undergraduate MSE courses).   Annoyingly (for me at least) a lot of the core coursework is very qualitative, such as learning about defects (point defects, line defects, dislocation movement, dislocation sources, etc.), and to me it honestly ended up being mostly (logic-aided) memorization.   Certain specialized fields within MSE are math/science intensive though, for example solid mechanics (mechanical behavior of materials) is heavier on physics and math than most other MSE electives I've taken.  Job prospects are very different than ChemE, not worse persay, but different. As a Materials Engineer pretty much any engineering company might want to hire you (keyword: might). However from my experience applying for and looking around for career advice online, most engineering companies only need a few materials engineers compared to the masses of MEs, EEs, and maybe ChemEs that they hire. This means that while you could feasibly work for pretty much any industry, from aerospace, to O&G, to automotive, to consumer goods, to steel, etc.. Being hired is often at the whim of timing since they usually only need a few materials engineers at any given time (so if no retirements or expansion, no jobs for you). Obviously larger companies will always try to keep some young materials engineers in the talent pipeline, but I'd say they're far fewer than for say, ME or ChemE.   Of course if you want to go into the metals or polymers industry, like say for Goodyear or Nucor Steel or Alcoa, then yes, they will always be hiring materials/metallurgical engineers.   Good luck to you all the same!"
EngineeringStudents,3bs4cv,EngineerEddy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"Are they technically engineers though? From the course I am looking at (moving to) it's under the category of Meng which is pretty much an engineering qualification, and I have no interest outside of doing anything engineering related (don't want a science course).  I'll do my best to see if I could remain in the Chem Eng since my eyes are set on it, but I hope it enjoy this either way."
EngineeringStudents,3bs4cv,io12312,3,Wed Jul 1 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"Well.... depends on what you decide to do after college.  It is sort of a half-science, half-engineering degree in my opinion (at least at the undergrad level).  In the real world, you can be a scientist or an engineer.  A materials scientist is similar (in job roles) to that of a chemist or biologist. At a low level you can be a lab technician for a company, which means they tell you to do lab work for testing or research, you do the lab work.  You can also be in research in development, which means researching new materials, or researching how new materials can be used for an application, or developing a materials process that makes a (expensive) material feasible for applications, etc. This however, usually requires a PhD or at least a masters degree.  On the engineering side I would say most of the jobs involve either process development, materials selection, or materials testing. Materials testing is somewhat similar to that of being a lab technician, but with increased responsibilities and knowledge required. Materials selection is self-explanatory, you help product development teams decide on materials to use and sign off on them, contact suppliers, develop specs, etc.. Process development is the most similar job to what you'd expect a ChemE to do, except instead of working with chemical processes, reactors, etc. You're probably working with something like steel or aluminum.   I think if you really want to do ChemE-like stuff, then working in a basic materials industry (metals and polymers mainly) as a process engineer is pretty damn close. Also working at a steel mill is pretty awe inspiring (albeit very dirty and potentially hazardous!). Don't let anybody tell you otherwise, there are still serious potential process improvements in steelmaking to increase efficiency, decrease CO2 emissions, etc. The modern integrated steel mill with a blast furnace is already something of a pinnacle of thermal efficiency (65-70% efficiency, compare that to a car engine w/ ~35% efficiency). It's a dirty environment (and thus it's not considered a ""sexy"" workplace environment or industry like say, aerospace or tech) because there's bound to be steel particles accumulating everywhere, but most of the ones still running are state of the art (although some of the most advanced integrated steel mills are not in America)."

EngineeringStudents,3bqrhd,Rilandi,14,Wed Jul 1 11:45:29 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way, some students have not been so fortunate in the past. By lowering admission standards, it provides opportunities to more individuals to enter into these technical fields.   Say you grow up in a home where education has never been enforced. Maybe your parents wouldn't give you rides to school in the mornings, and some days would refuse to take you. Your High School education could quickly take a turn for the worse. Now, maybe you are the kid in the family that wants to make something of yourself, but need someone to just give you a shot. My university does exactly this. There are no requirements to get into the engineering, business, nursing, or any other majors. You just have to be accepted into the University. And even the process for doing that is incredibly easy. If you graduated High School, you'll probably get accepted. They do this for a reason.   Every successful person had someone that gave them a chance to make something of themselves. So just remember that.  And as far as worrying why the courses are not in high demand is probably just down to your area. For example, my school has a high engineering population, but almost no medical students. There are around 50 current nursing students due to the requirements and everything. So it could just be flipped at your school."

EngineeringStudents,3bpns2,PPGBM,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:26:21 2015 UTC,Why Triscuit boxes...? My friends freshman year went to USPS and got the free flat rate boxes and used those to make a wall blocking the hallway.
EngineeringStudents,3bpns2,Scrtcwlvl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it became a pride thing by the end of it.   I lived in the dorms, so I had a dining plan. This gave me enough money daily to get breakfast, lunch, and dinner from the dining hall. I had odd hours sophomore year (12 hour day schedule) so I never really made it for breakfast or lunch. I opted instead to buy cereal (life) from the student store, which accepted meal plan money. They also sold triscuits, one of my favorite snacks. Every week I'd buy triscuits and milk."

EngineeringStudents,3bpns2,fruetloops,2,Wed Jul 1 21:25:44 2015 UTC,"I have 2 desks set up in a corner, one is 8'x3', the other is 8'x1.5'. This provides me an absurd amount of desk space. On the large desk i have a TV and computer screen connected to my desktop computer, and it faces my bed so I can watch TV in bed. The big desk is where I do most of my work, The small desk is used for eating or the other person when I'm studying with other people.

EngineeringStudents,3bpzca,barley_n_hops,4,Wed Jul 1 05:27:12 2015 UTC,"Some employers like IBM request a list of courses or topics you covered in classes for interns and freshouts. Also, my school includes whether you did EE or CpE on the degree. If you feel something is not clear on your resume, use the cover letter to clarify and then offer more explanation if prompted during an interview. ECE is a combined accredited program from ABET that allows one degree to cover both a CpE and EE program. It normally exists because there is insufficient distinction between a CpE and EE program. Employers know this. Just make it clear to them which you did and you'll be fine."

But yeah, mental health is the top priority, you just can't perform if you're unhappy. I started studying last fall semester and out of multiple reasons I started becoming really unhappy, so I half assed my first semester with a lot of Cs. I also had to commute more than 2 hours daily, cause I couldn't afford to move, so that wears you off quickly, too. Combine this with doubts about whether I really want to continue with the Electrical Engineering route and just general unhappiness about personal stuff leads me to where I am now, taking a break to overthink stuff. Probably gonna switch majors and move to a nearer college, or move out."

EngineeringStudents,3blumx,CyborgSlunk,4,Tue Jun 30 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"It's mainly general doubts whether I really want to become an engineer. I just chose EE because it was the discipline that appealed to me the most out of the engineering stuff. It's not even different from what I expected it to be, and I do find it interesting, but still...I just can't bring myself to actually invest myself into it, mentally and emotionally.

But my gpa was improving every semester from a B average my freshman year, until this last semester. I had the added job as an officer in my fraternity to my load of responsibilities and along with the part-time job and some added family issues that came up, it just got to be too much. Now I've lost my position because my grades were just barely below our B- semester standard.   Don't try to take on too much extra outside of your Engineering degree...it was tough for me to adjust to the added commitment when I started hitting my core classes late sophomore and junior year."

I can't bring myself to help myself so I bury myself in this site and another site to hide from everything. My GPA is faltering and I don't know what to do. I want to switch but I don't know what to switch to and I don't know how I can tell my parents. Plus I don't want to have to stay another year (I'm entering my third year) and a 5th would kill me because I have a terrible time making friends and what not.

EngineeringStudents,3blumx,djentlight,3,Tue Jun 30 11:58:49 2015 UTC,"It is true. I have a prescription for it and only take it when I absolutely have to, and this was the reason I held off so long, even though in hindsight I do have a genuine need for it. I have an extreme dislike of being handed things and I knew that amphetamines will boost your performance regardless of whatever your starting point is. At the end of the day motivation is still needed to haul your ass to the library for hours every day and if you don't have that then adderal certair won't give it to you. I still hate that I find it necessary at times but once you overcome the mindset of ""academic steroids"" then it's a more tolerable proposition."
EngineeringStudents,3blumx,Corpse_Nibbler,2,Tue Jun 30 12:54:33 2015 UTC,"The counter point I'll make for my situation.  I was going to get a psychological assessment done. Once on a lifetime opportunity as an adult so I decided to stop the Concerta my doctor prescribed. Still awaiting the report but I've been described by the Dr psychometrician as bright but low working memory. ADHD or asperger's likely but no childhood history to be conclusive.  I got an A in calculus 2 and a B in engineering 2 that semester on my low course load.  I'm back on Concerta. I've had it explained by the psychologist that ADHD is the inability to auto regulate attention. Medication allows neuro signals to not drop off along synapses. My life is less stressful, I'm not more intelligent. The trade off really is that I'm more tired now. Stimulants promote unsustainable lifestyles. If you need it don't fight who you are."
EngineeringStudents,3blumx,__waitwhat__,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:14:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thorough reply, i always appreciate a devil's advocate. My doctor agreed with my assessment that it's really only long stretches of time where my attention span suffers. In lectures and hands on labs i'm fine ( even more so during all nighters in the SAE garage) but it's the 5+ hour stretches in the library where i have an issue. For me it wasn't a slow fall off but a brick wall i'd hit after 2 hours. In these situations it helps me and i take it appropriately, although i'm the first to admit that my personality doesn't really improve the situation."

EngineeringStudents,3blumx,fanCmonk3y,4,Tue Jun 30 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Antidepressants. I didn't actually have a very high workload during the last 2 years (except for last quarter). My sophomore year, however, I took over the unit cap twice in weeder classes, and was able to handle the stress pretty well, so I knew I was able to handle large workloads. Yet, for junior and the beginning of senior year, I was reducing my unit load habitually over and over and not getting any better results. I found myself not thinking clearly, not able to focus, and spending days on end not doing much of anything but contemplating suicide. This seemed different to me-- stress is something I can handle, but depression? That was a serious wrench in my ability to function. I decided it was too much, got some help, landed on the right medication, and saw an instant boost in my gpa. There are likely other factors at play here, but combined with the fact that I feel better in general, I'd say it's pretty clear what's been going on."
EngineeringStudents,3blumx,haarp1,-5,Tue Jun 30 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"Good for you. I don't know you, so I won't judge you.   I just know far too many people here at my university who claim to have depression just because they lose their motivation for several months. That's not a depression. They constantly cry about the huge workload and how it isn't possible to get your degree in the regular 3 years. (it usually isn't, but nobody cares if you need an extra semester). It's an engineering study at a university with a good reputation. I don't know what they expected."
EngineeringStudents,3blumx,zacharythefirst,7,Tue Jun 30 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"Hey man. I'm not trying to hound you in the comments, but I do want to try to correct a few things. The United States has an absolutely terrible stigma against mental health and the only thing that can help change it is education.  If someone who 'claims' to have depression is diagnosed with depression by a doctor, then they have depression. If that depression was caused by something as trivial as school work then it's still depression and is just as valid as my own depression which is combat related.   One of the worst things you can do is to trivialize what someone has gone through, no matter the cause.  However, if they're claiming depression because they're bummed out over failing classes and have never sought medical attention, well that's a whole different issue. That sounds more like a lack of self discipline than anything else."
EngineeringStudents,3blumx,haarp1,6,Tue Jun 30 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really hard to grasp what depression is without feeling it yourself, so people without depression end up thinking like I used to think ""it's like when i'm sad but all the time.""

That being said, even if you're the top of your class it will be tough to find employment if no one recruits your university.

In the first year I would only be allowed to take a max of 6 credits per semester then the next year I would be granted in-state tuition rates.  The school you choose to go to really doesn't matter if you can network and graduate on time, a number of students on this sub will tell you I'm wrong, but I'm surrounded by engineers who went to the state university or the private college some considered ""prestigious"" some thought of as subpar yet they are making the same salary.

At ISU, showing that you are a resident involves providing proof of employment in that state (not being dependent on parents/guardians) and no intention of being supported by parents/guardians in future years, previously filed Iowa tax return(s), valid reasons for why you are in the state beyond educational purposes (proof of how long you have lived in state, drivers license and voter ID is helpful, able to show how long you have lived in Iowa so lease or mortgage information going back at least a year or two, etc). Basically to get in-state tuition the burden of proof is on the student to show they aren't just there for college and trying to get tuition they aren't qualified for."
EngineeringStudents,3bqyin,mnk88,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"It is possible to get in-state after a year, provided you go through the process of establishing intent to stay by getting a CA license, filing taxes, registering to vote, etc. Look up the residency requirements and maybe contact the residency deputy at the school you're interested. I went through the process at UCSD, however because my father is a CA resident I was able to get an out-of-state tuition waiver and was able to pay in-state tuition my first year, then applied for residency my second year.  Also, I think Berkeley has similar tuition to UCSD so if you get into Berkeley you likely won't save much money by choosing UCSD."

I would also recommend looking at the smaller companies. There are a ton of satellite and aero companies which aren't big names, but the experience you get is often times better than at a large company.   I've worked for two summers now at a smallish company (<300 people), but all my work is for Boeing (it's a supplier), and all of it is awesome. I've gotten a lot of great experience here because it doesn't have as formal of an intern program, and as a result I get a lot of regular-employee responsibilities, as opposed to a standardized intern program you might find at a large company such as LM where you get a lot of tours and ""intern"" projects. When you go to career fairs, sure go visit LM and Boeing, but check out some of the smaller companies as well :)"

United Launch Alliance, Orbital ATK, SpaceX are always looking for top talent in the private sector space market...that said, I'd look into the UAV market if you want to try something a little different and really wanna get into controls. Here's a list of global UAV manufacturers. Some are tiny one-man operations and some are massive global organizations.   Also maybe consider Raytheon for controls and guidance?  For a very different experience, you could look into working in an advanced research lab, like Georgia Tech. GTRI has some really unique opportunities  Either way, best thing to do is to just find those companies you're interested in and go ahead and start finding their applications.

If not, my i5 model works absolutely great for me. It's snappy to run MATLAB and some aerodynamics modeling software I've needed for school, and one of my friends runs CAD on his (albeit not as well as a computer owned by the university and made for intensive software like CAD)  To me, having a Surface is invaluable because it's  - Light, so it won't add to my already incredibly heavy bag filled with books - Powerful, so it can handle most any software I need it to - Has great handwriting support and software: seriously, OneNote is a revelation.

However, she has not found this to be a really big drawback.    In any engineering program the key reason for a laptop is to run programs and office on your laptop so you dont have to be in the computer lab.  I don't believe that anyone can effectively take notes on a touchscreen; no matter how good the stylus is, it cannot replace pen and paper IMO."
EngineeringStudents,3bojmn,SplitPSoup4U,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"I agree up to a point; I found that whenever I needed very intense engineering software, I was almost always someplace that had computers owned by the University built to handle them. Everything else (including Office, MATLAB, Mathematics, XFOIL, etc) I could run on my Surface, and I 100% disagree that you can't take good notes on a touch screen. Sure there's an adjustment period, but here is a sample from some of the notes I took this past semester, keeping in mind that my handwriting and drawing are normally not very good: http://imgur.com/We1wY9J http://imgur.com/GBTNdo3  The benefit of doing things digitally was that if I needed to move things around or erase, I didn't have to mangle my paper or shuffle things out of order, and it was fewer notebooks and bulk to keep track of.  Of course it's all a preference thing, and your mileage will obviously vary, but I wouldn't be so quick to discourage people from a Surface for engineering school. All of my engineering friends who own them are totally satisfied with the Surface as a primary mobile computer, since the amount of time they actually need to spend doing things like CAD and would be doing that work outside of a design lab or comparable campus facility was slim to none."
EngineeringStudents,3bojmn,jayfred,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:54:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is possible to take good notes on a touchscreen, those notes are some of the more decent ones that i have seen.  I still dont think that you get a good value with the Surface line though, its the new ""thing"" to have in Engineering.  My wife has heard mixed reviews from her classmates on the surface, the only ones being positive are for the top of the line version.    Seperate side note, i do hope that touch screen notes improve the drawing ability of Engineers, i graduated from a Structural program about 6 years ago and it seems like the drawing/lettering ability of engineers is getting worse. But i worry that since you can't be as rough on a touch screen, it leads to a bit shakier lines and poorer handwriting than pen/pencil and paper, i have never used a quality screen myself to write on  so just a theory,  any thoughts on this?  The other aspect is that I think you have to consider your field. If i went into a meeting with a tablet for taking notes at my job, i would be laughed out of the room.  Everyone pretty much uses moleskin books/steno pads etc for notes with the occasional laptop typer.  Now if you are in the Computer Science field, completely opposite I am sure."

I have a MacBook Pro as my main computer that I can bootcamp to run the more intense programs.  so if you're getting it for notes, get any of them, they all are powerful enough for that. if you're getting it to run powerful programs, you might have to shell out quite a bit of dough."

EngineeringStudents,3bok16,rossland,2,Tue Jun 30 22:05:14 2015 UTC,The main reason i could think of would be for employment. I'm assuming a masters on a resume would greatly increase the chance of getting hired.

These degrees paths aren't as likely to be funded by the school, but there's a decent chance you'll be able to find an employer that will hire you on and pay for a masters (with some sort of commitment on your part and/or some time working prior to beginning the degree), especially if you express a desire to further your education."
EngineeringStudents,3bok16,hardolaf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:34:24 2015 UTC,"In EE, you barely scratch the surface of topics in undergrad. Employers know this. If you're looking to do design of any kind, a Masters or significant experience is usually needed to get into design positions (whether they be power, RF, electronics, etc.). If you're just interested in layout, analysis, testing, validation, basic power design, etc. you don't need a BS. Also, you can always go back. See if you like the work that you get with a BSEE and if you don't like it and don't see yourself doing what you want to do without a MSEE, then go back. Maybe take advantage of a tuition reimbursement program at a company and earn a MSEE while working.  A MSEE cannot hurt you. But don't do it unless you want to."
EngineeringStudents,3bnr8v,Swissar,3,Tue Jun 30 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend learning ARIES (Landmark - Halliburton Software) since it's a widely used program for decline curve analysis and running project economics - both integral to the reserve booking process.  Any experience you have with programming or data analytics would also be helpful. VBA is typically solid due to Excel's ubiquity... although knowledge of Access wouldn't hurt. Regarding other specific O&G programs: CMG (simulations) along with the program suites offered by Kappa and Fekete are useful and obviously knowledge in this software makes you more valuable (as well as adding lines on your resume if that's what you're looking for...), but may not be accessible depending on the resources your company has.   In my experience, most reservoir engineering duties tend to lean toward reserves booking and project management, which is discouraging if you expect the role to be that of a traditional reservoir engineer (reservoir characterization).  The optimal way to develop your career would be to speak with experienced reservoir engineers and read some fundamental SPE papers, monograms, and books for a good background in reservoir engineering. Over half of the time, actual knowledge of what the programs and doing and the assumptions/concepts they make and use are more meaningful than knowing how to press buttons."

Personally, I already have years of experience as an IT technician (returning to university). I remember that during the first month of the first session, I struggled a little bit with the fundamental sciences because it's been such a long time I didn't do mathematics/physics/chemistry but now I'm fine. I guess that I'll increase gradually the workload: 4 this fall, 4 this winter, 5 in summer 2016, so on. It should work. Thank you for your advice."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,swarmed100,16,Tue Jun 30 14:22:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a shit professor, the fuck kind of policy is that? Of course you can undermine the TAs, that's why you're teaching the class instead of them!  Regardless, my advice would be to mostly keep doing what you're doing. However, I'd study the old test questions and see if you can pick up any pattern in them. A lot of professors have certain things they like to put on their tests (an obscure trig identity, a way of evaluating an integral, etc.) and tell the graders to look for those. So, don't memorize the questions per say, that's a waste of time (from an understanding standpoint) but do watch out for things that you're repeatedly losing points on. And, if nothing else, maybe you'll have a better professor next semester without such an idiotic policy."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,DannyFuckingCarey,3,Tue Jun 30 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"commenting to agree with you. It's one thing for a TA to correct a professor, but it's the professor whole job to keep the TA's in line and grading according to what he would grade."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,Darth_drizzt_42,4,Tue Jun 30 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"Nearly all professors have this policy here, at least in the first year. The reason is that everyone can start to study engineering, you don't have to write an application like in the US. This results in 2/3 of engineering students who aren't fit for engineering and who fail to many classes. If the professor challenges one exam score he will get flooded by tens or hundreds of those students who hope to pass the class.  And yes, I study the old tests to check for exercises I can't make or theoretical questions I don't understand. The way other students do it is that together they make a big list of all the theoretical questions and find the answers to them in the textbook. They put this huge compilation on dropbox and study from that. It's not that I'm losing points to some obscure way of solving things, it's that I'm losing points because since I don't study it by heart so my sentences aren't exactly the same as those of most students.   One example for thermodynamics:  Q:What steps does the carnot cycle consist of and why do the steps have these characteristics?  my answer: [...] This step has to be adiabatic so that the total entropy doesn't increase [...]  ""correct"" answer: [...] This step has to be adiabatic so that the process is reversible[...]  This was literally the only difference in the whole question between what I wrote and what was in the textbook. I got a 3/10 on the question. 3/10 because I used a synonym."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,rdg00,2,Tue Jun 30 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"If that is really the only issue with that question that you had, I would definitely consider some alternative options, because even if that isn't worded 'exactly right', they are the same thing.  I would be careful though that there isn't any other smaller issues that may be contributing to the lower grade and that you may be inadvertently focusing on the more negative aspects.  A couple of things to keep in mind here...  If you are really concerned about the grade, you can always consider looking into if your university has an academic grievance policy.  Just be aware that if you do end up going down this route, you will end up burning some bridges, so it may be worth it to consider whether or not a small increase in your grade's percentage is worth the extra effort.  You may also have to weigh it against the possibility of an end of course curve as well (if one is present), because if you have attended all classes, asked questions, and sought help, generally if a curve is present you get bumped up.  Secondly, I know you said you talked to the professor, but have you talked to the TA to explain your reasoning?  I know the professor may not be willing to undermine the TA, but if the TA is willing to sit down with you and sees the errors, perhaps there is a chance that they will be able to institute the grade change for you (through your professor)."

We never got a model solution and we're not allowed to show our exam to other people so the only way I can find out the answer to a question is by looking up all related sections in the textbook. I'm fairly confident that in this particular example that 3/10 is just because he didn't accept that one sentence. He put a question mark next to it, so it seems that he might not understand what I mean with total entropy? How is that possible after a course in thermodynamics? It's so odd...   A couple of things to keep in mind here... If you are really concerned about the grade, you can always consider looking into if your university has an academic grievance policy. Just be aware that if you do end up going down this route, you will end up burning some bridges, so it may be worth it to consider whether or not a small increase in your grade's percentage is worth the extra effort.   Burning bridges is indeed why I haven't taken any action, while I would like better grades I don't think that it's worth the hassle. A 70% is considered really good, but I wanted more to be able to teach freshmen and to stand out. Making professors hate me won't help with either of that.   You may also have to weigh it against the possibility of an end of course curve as well (if one is present), because if you have attended all classes, asked questions, and sought help, generally if a curve is present you get bumped up. Curves don't exist here in Belgium :)  Secondly, I know you said you talked to the professor, but have you talked to the TA to explain your reasoning? I know the professor may not be willing to undermine the TA, but if the TA is willing to sit down with you and sees the errors, perhaps there is a chance that they will be able to institute the grade change for you (through your professor).   I don't know which TA graded the exam. Maybe in the future I can try this route, but I'm afraid that for this exam it's too late. Thanks for the tip! Maybe talking with the TA will make me see where the problem lies. I will probably have to jump through some hoops to talk to him/her, but this is certainly something worth trying out."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,seeking_perhaps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:48:46 2015 UTC,"Fuck bridges. If the professor refuses to correct a TAs incorrect grading, they are not someone you should ever want to work for. File a formal grievance. This professor's actions are unreasonable and unethical. A refusal to correct an incorrect grade in my department can be used to revoke tenure from a professor. That's how serious of a matter the department here considers grades. Grades are the only official indicator of your knowledge and proficiency in the material. GRADES MATTER. Sure they don't matter that much to an employer, but they should accurately reflect your ability to learn the material in courses."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,OminousLatinWord,2,Wed Jul 1 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"Yea, seriously. This guy did everything right: knew his professor personally, learned the material in his own words, and answered every question on the exam right, but the kids that memorized the questions get the good grades. What a shitty professor. Still, OP should be happy he actually learned the material and should just avoid that professor in the future."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,hardolaf,6,Tue Jun 30 21:47:24 2015 UTC,My suggestion: move up the chain of command from your professor to the department head. Tell them what your professor told you. They have more power than your professor and don't care about his rules. You are in the right and the case is a shoe-in.
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,txhusky17,0,Tue Jun 30 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"Like /thatoneguydudeperson says, they will most likely make up some reason as to why the grade is correct. They don't care a lot about the students here, especially not in the first year. I'm starting a study group next semester, studying in group instead of alone will probably make me answers more in line with the textbook. If the issue persist I will move up the chain next semester. I'm going on a vacation for the next two weeks, and after that we're not allowed to fight a grade anymore. So it's very difficult for me and probably not worth the hassle to escalate things this semester."
EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,hardolaf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"They may not care about the students, but they do care about reputation.

EngineeringStudents,3bmugm,thatoneguydudeperson,3,Wed Jul 1 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"he told me that what I wrote was correct but that he had a policy of not undermining the TA’s who corrected the exams. I understand why he has to do this   I don't understand that one bit...he's the freakin' professor. The TAs work FOR him, not the other way around.  He's the one orchestrating and leading the class. He should have the final call on grades, not the TAs.  TAs are typically there to take the grading burden off of a busy professor. Not to determine final grades. If you're ultimately correct, and the professor agrees with you, then your score needs to reflect that.  Gosh, not being able to change the grade because he doesn't want to undermine the TA is horrible policy with zero checks and balances. Anyway, if that's the policy they go with then continue doing what you're doing in learning the material, but start studying the old exams as well. I know profs can get busy sometimes and use an old exam but change up a couple questions so those old exams may give you a good idea of what to expect. However, if they do write an entirely new exam, you'll be the one sitting pretty because you know what's going on and understand the core material. Those that study an old exam not really knowing how to apply the math to different questions will be the ones who struggle.  Edit: typo"

I would go there and ask for help on something that you don't know and they will help you through and and make sure you understand it. Also I cannot stress this enough , study with someone or a group of people, however this will sound a little harsh but study with people who are smarter than you and you will literally feed of their knowledge.

EngineeringStudents,3bnjjm,bppatel23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"Even though I did well on dynamics, I definitely understand where you're coming from. I remember studying for my dynamics final felt like beating my head against a wall repeatedly until somehow I just started getting questions correct. It was weird, it wasn't even like I had a breakthrough or something but just after beating my head against a wall (mentally, sometimes physically) stuff just started to work out.   So my only tip for you with dynamics is honestly just keep doing problems until you start getting them right. And I want to also second /u/bppatel23's suggestion of finding a tutor which is probably more effective than smacking your head all day. Dynamics is the type of thing where it's difficult to know how to do something if you're not really understanding it well, and judging by your situation it doesn't seem like you're understanding it too well.   To give you more anecdotal experiences, I remember trying to wrap my brain around nested rotating frames and not being able to understand them at all. Then I said ""Shit, I don't have time to be wasting mulling over this. I'll just start doing problems."" And unsurprisingly, I wasn't getting many problems correct. Then one of my reallllyyyyy smart friends walked me through the most complicated problem I saw studying, explaining each step. And I won't lie, it's not like something just suddenly click like ""Oh wow, it's so easy I know how to do it now!"" But just having even a slightly better understanding of what was going on helped me immensely."

I feel like I really understand the material. Every book question I've done, I've gotten correct (minus a handful of incorrect cross products and algebra mistakes). I feel like last term I didn't understand it at a basic level, so I had problems setting up the equations, but now I've mastered the basics but this professor loves to throw curve balls.   Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any resources where the questions are not (more or less) straightforward. Our textbook has many problem types, but there's nothing ""next level"", like my prof seems to enjoy giving us.   I don't really know what to do because I feel like I've been doing everything that's been suggested (I have a good study group, I am friends with a masters student who goes over problems with me, my best friend got an A in this last last term and explains problems to me when I get stuck, I'm doing the problems on my own and getting them correct), but none of that matters if I can't pass the exams."

I took 3 years off after high school before I figured out that I wanted to do engineering. I never took any math above algebra 2 in high school and even though I placed into pre-calc I decided to start with Trig. I was in there with other engineering majors and with some math majors. I got 102% in that class. Easy GPA boost and it built a foundation for me to move into pre-calc and calculus and get As there too.  Point is, do your degree however you see fit.

Math and engineering majors generally exhibit a lot of bravado, and it's really annoying to those of us that are over that phase of life and are seriously interested in results.  I tested out of Pre-calc and went straight into Calc 1. KhanAcademy and online lectures are your friends here. There's also a saying that you never really understand algebra until you do trig. And you never really understand trig until you do calc. Calc is the most elegant math I've encountered and I actually love it a lot. It's a pain to perform it, but its concepts are gorgeous. I mention this because you mentioned you've always loved math too.  Keep the big picture in mind as you proceed through and don't compare yourself to what others are doing. Just do your damn best."

Every fresh engineer has the worst nerd complex ever and is going to think they're hot shit. Especially the one's coming in with Physics C or Calc AB/BC credits because ""oooo I took college credit early so I'm obviously a genius"". Fuck those guys.  Also, I know a lot of universities like you to take their version of calculus. Obviously it's not super different, but they'll cover all topics needed for the next class. I took BC calc my senior year of hs and we covered both calc 1 and calc 2, and I got credit from the AP test.

When I did the placement exam as an incoming freshman they suggested I start there too even though I took calculus in high school. I skipped it and jumped right into Calc 1, worked my butt off, used tutoring when I needed it, and did just fine and you may be able to as well. If you need the tutoring, then use it.  That's why it's there and there's absolutely no shame in that. Understanding the material and then nailing it when it's crunch time on the exam or in real life is far more important.

EngineeringStudents,3bmmol,carl_sagans_ghost__,2,Tue Jun 30 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"All I took in high school was algebra 1 and half of geometry. I had a kickass algebra 1 class so I managed to do okay on the ACT and stuff but when I went back to college nearly 5 years later, I placed into Beginning Algebra, one class above developmental math. Had to take beginning algebra, intermediate algebra, then precalc. Now I'm in calc 2 and have gotten A's in every class so far. I see it two ways, both positive:  1) if I kept chugging through those classes, nothing will stop me. Everyone talks about getting bogged down in hard classes but I think it's even worse when you have to think ""I have three more classes before I'm even to the classes I need""   2) my foundation is a lot stronger. No matter what the snobby kids think, algebra in college is harder than algebra in high school. In college they know they are preparing you for higher math. It's a much better foundation.

I'm 27, have a bachelor's degree in geography and am going back to school in the fall to do engineering. I have already taken algebra, trig and precalc but I decided to start with precalc again because I have no memory of it at all. The point is, start where you feel like you need to and move up from there. The only thing I can suggest is that you take an extra math class during the summer if your university requires concurrent enrollment between physics and math courses. I found that because I'm taking pre-calc instead of calculus 1, I will have to wait an extra semester to start physics courses. As a part time student who already has virtually all of the other basics I could be taking in that time, it leaves me in a semester with basically one class because I won't have the prerequisites and concurrent enrollment requirements necessary to take other courses. In other words, an extra semester before I can get my degree.   As others suggested, use Khan academy even during classes. It will help you practice, keep an edge on the material and prepare for the next courses you will be taking. It's a very useful tool for me and requires minimal effort.   Don't worry about being a female in engineering. Engineering is changing in this regard and someday the chauvinistic attitude will disappear. If anything, be happy about the fact that many companies are eager to higher professional female engineers right now. Your fellow students may feel like they're somehow above you in school, but someday you're gonna get a job almost immediately and their cocky attitude isn't going to do them any favors in a heavily competitive job market."

Sounds like an easy way to become confused and burnt out/disinterested. If you're the type of person who studies like that or if you're really interested then go for it. If you really want to start ahead of time, following along on Khan Academy would probably be easier than trying to go through the material with the book by yourself. Pace yourself so you don't hate yourself, too."
EngineeringStudents,3bk12b,zebrastripe665,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:20:36 2015 UTC,Khan academy is actually what I planned to use. The text will be to see exactly what topics will be covered
EngineeringStudents,3bk12b,Chris1671,11,Tue Jun 30 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"You're being dramatic.  Buckle down, do something different (STUDY MORE), and you'll be stunned by the results.    Calc 2 especially is heavily memory based more so than any other advance math.  Here's your keys for memory.  1) SLEEP.  No seriously, you gotta get fucking sleep.  This is when your brain encodes memories.  If you don't sleep, your brain is not even 1/2 as useful at memory forming.  This flows into number 2.  2) TIME MANAGEMENT. You just failed this class, you did not do enough to pass.  So when you take it again, you must do more and do different.  Take out that syllabus AS SOON AS YOU GET IT.  Mark down the areas you KNOW you struggled in.  Pull up your calendar and block out time at the BEGINNING so you can have extra study time.  Don't bullshit this.    3) MULTIPLE ENCODING STEPS.  The more you hear something, the stronger your connections in the brain form allowing you stronger memories.  HERE IS THE ULTIMATE HACK watch a khan academy video BEFORE every class on the subject you are about to study in class (the syllabus tells all).  Honestly they are 15 minutes, do it while you are brushing your teeth with a smartphone or whatever.  That is encode 1, encode 2 is class, encode 3 is homework.  If you go back & study the info again that is encode 4 & 5.  Notice this is not 'skip class, ignore homework, and hit encode 1 the night before the test'.  4).  KEEP YOUR CHIN UP, don't beat yourself up, don't pay attention to the other kids in class as much as possible, be brave and raise your hand when you get confused (even if you're that annoying twat always doing it, I know I always was, and now I'm an engineer so who cares?).  No one is naturally talented at this stuff, they may act like it but then they go home and do the work.  Some inspiration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsIwQeUKo0U  5) NETWORK.  You can go buy this book for 100 some bucks, and go read and do problem sets and learn calculus.  THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE IN COLLEGE FOR. You are in college to network, make connections, and grow as a human being (that happens to be a rad engineer).  Form a study group once a week for a bloody hour, buy them beer or pizza, have a good time with it. Go to office hours and talk shop with the professor.  It will force you to be invested in the class, invested in the information, and you will not let yourself do bad when you are that invested.  (also you may hear of some cool startup idea that makes you millions in the future or at least gives you great experience).  Do those 5 things, you ace, I guarantee it."
EngineeringStudents,3bk12b,Sybertron,4,Tue Jun 30 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"Came here to stress two of these points; study groups, and khan academy. Khan academy wasn't around (I don't think) when I took Calc 2 but it has helped me to go back and fill the gaps in my understanding very well. And is always great for new material. And study groups are so key. You get different viewpoints to the problems and a higher probability someone will understand what is going on, if you don't. Calc 2 is rough, but you can get it done."

However, in your situation I believe it's more of a difficulty factor. Calculus is in no way shape or form difficult as compared your future classes. But just like everyone, your first time around can be challenging. But with that being said, really take the time to try and focus as much as you can. Use outside resources. Start to think like an engineer. The days of everything being given to you in nice easy to follow step by step worksheets is soon to be over. Use the internet, use tutors, use your professor. If you can't master the material, atleast form good study habits and learn to manage time. But also try to do well in the class to save that gpa of yours. Good luck."

That being said, calc 2 in 5 weeks sounds insanely difficult unless you've already taken it before. Don't let failing the course discourage you. I wouldn't have passed calc 2 in 5 weeks, but I did well with 14. Are you trying to graduate within 4 years? Is it still possible to do this if you're behind 1 semester in math? Maybe taking a gen. ed. course over the summer might be a better idea. It could give you more space in your schedule to take another course (such as a math class in order to catch up). Although, this could increase your workload in the fall/spring, so you'll have to judge how well you can handle it before you try it.  It isn't over until it's over. Good luck!"

Startalk or The Infinite Monkey Cage might be about as close as you get, as far as I'm aware.  I would love to know if anyone else has found some that aren't in iTunes.  Like maybe recorded lectures or something.    EDIT:  I did find that Feynman's physics lectures are available in various places but I haven't found strictly audio yet...at least for free.  http://www.richard-feynman.net/videos.htm"
EngineeringStudents,3bktss,geersy,3,Tue Jun 30 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"If you have access to the video (which you do--and it appears the Feynman videos are hosted via YouTube) you can extract the audio file from the video and then just load that file into iTunes or whatever media player you use, and then transfer it into whatever device you want to listen to it through."
EngineeringStudents,3bktss,mnk88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:15:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I want something that is relatively instructional like a lecture but not so reliant on being able to see the notes. I'll look into the ones you mentioned! I'm pretty new to listening to podcasts so I have no idea what to listen to. You should post any ones you find interesting even if there not engineering or science related
EngineeringStudents,3bktss,Nathanaelbendavid,5,Tue Jun 30 01:43:09 2015 UTC,"http://theengineeringcommons.com I subscribed to this and am working my way up from the initial episodes.  Honestly, there is a lot good info here the can be helpful even beyond engineering (work ethic, working with people etc)   I would be interested in good general (or electrical/comp) engineering books as well."
EngineeringStudents,3bktss,1ntre,2,Tue Jun 30 01:52:30 2015 UTC,This seems really interesting I'll check it out! Nothing seems to be all that focused on coursework and theory much though. Hopefully I find something that is done a little more in a lecture style
EngineeringStudents,3bktss,hanadiode,2,Tue Jun 30 02:27:20 2015 UTC,Check out the tv series called The Mechanical Universe and Beyond. It's rather old (Late 80's) but REALLY good.
EngineeringStudents,3bou44,engthrowaway123,3,Tue Jun 30 22:59:57 2015 UTC,"I found Chegg to be extremely useful thanks to solutions manuals they have for textbooks online; it is great as a means of double checking my work. Plus, I have used the ""ask a question"" feature once or twice for when I was absolutely stumped and didn't have time to ask a professor or tutor for help--got a reply within an hour. Paid for the year subscription (I also paid for Wolfram Alpha and of course have my free account with Khan Academy)... Online resources have been an incredible help to me since my work schedule often prohibits me from being able to stay on campus and wait for available tutors etc"
EngineeringStudents,3bou44,mnk88,2,Wed Jul 1 08:27:12 2015 UTC,"I use Chegg all the time.   Chegg is nothing different than having a solution manual, other than Chegg will sometimes have the wrong answers or an overcomplicated way of solving a problem). If you use Chegg just to copy answers, then you're still going to bomb on your exams, otherwise it's just a tool to help you show how to do the problem, it's up to you to figure out why it's solved that way."
EngineeringStudents,3bou44,WowStrongArms,3,Wed Jul 1 00:10:58 2015 UTC,"Good luck on exams if all you do is rely on solutions posted prior. It's one thing to look at a solution and go ""hmm, that's reasonable"", and another to be able to proactively derive the solution. Using a solution manual after you've made the first attempt on your own is a good way of checking your understanding, but it is a crutch and if you rely solely on it, you will get bit."
EngineeringStudents,3bl1tk,amiapanda,4,Tue Jun 30 02:19:59 2015 UTC,"Walk up to their office or desk when they aren't on the phone or talking to someone and ask if they have a moment. That has worked for me so far and most of the time it seems like they enjoyed talking to me and other younger people. I've talked to someone new pretty much every day just to see what kind of stuff they do and their path to where they are now. What they think of the company, future of their position, stuff like that. There really isn't a need to be so formal with most people. I randomly walked into my hiring managers office and had a chat with him for over half an hour. No scheduled meeting or anything like that."
EngineeringStudents,3bl1tk,iamrandomperson,2,Tue Jun 30 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yup this has worked for me. I check if they are busy then lead with 'Hey, I heard you're a Platteville alum.'. And that rest is history."
EngineeringStudents,3bl1tk,thinkrage,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"In my case, the plant I'm working in is about 30 minutes from HQ so the dropping in unannounced thing doesn't work for me. That's why I'm thinking of doing the email+scheduled meeting at some point."
EngineeringStudents,3bl1tk,iamrandomperson,2,Tue Jun 30 04:24:24 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate. If they are pretty high up there, you might want to be formal with them just in case. In my case, my company is very casual when it comes to formalities unless it's around the customer. Your company might be different.   Try talking to other people around there that are in frequent contact with people back at the office and maybe get them to set up a meeting for you."
EngineeringStudents,3bl1tk,TubbyandthePoo-Bah,0,Tue Jun 30 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"Why would you target alumni, rather than people working the speciality you are interested in?  Is this an american thing?"
EngineeringStudents,3bl1tk,Jorlung,2,Tue Jun 30 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"Because it's easier to network with people that are alumni from your school. I wish there was someone important that graduated from my school at my summer job, because I know for certain if I went up to an alumni at my school and mentioned the fact that I go there they'd at least be intrigued. They might not be like ""OH MY GOD THAT'S AMAZING!"" but at least they'd say ""Oh you go there? That's cool!"" and it would give me an ""in."" You don't often have excuses to talk to important people at your summer job and this is an excellent way to lead into a conversation."
EngineeringStudents,3bl8og,AndyISE,5,Tue Jun 30 03:18:56 2015 UTC,"For the most, the class gets ""real"". You as the student starts making the connections between the real world, what you're learning, why you're learning it, and why is it important.   One class that really rattled my brain was foundation engineering because almost everything was based off some vague empirical relationship and problem solving isn't as strict as other courses. If you made reasonable assumptions you can solve a problem.  Sometimes you had to assume and simplify things to get somewhere and there's lots of trial and error solutions."
EngineeringStudents,3bl8og,brickrickslick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:52:27 2015 UTC,Were the major classes much harder than classes like math and physics?
EngineeringStudents,3bl8og,PrinceofPersia69,2,Tue Jun 30 05:12:43 2015 UTC,"They were definitely challenging, but in a different way. Some people have a hard time applying theory (they are good and memorizing and regurgitating information, but have trouble choosing what to apply when)."
EngineeringStudents,3bl8og,brickrickslick,2,Tue Jun 30 11:27:18 2015 UTC,"Depends who was teaching it, however the thing you always have to focus on is understanding what you're learning. Many people just know how to solve a problem but never really understand it.  Question what you're learning."
EngineeringStudents,3bl8og,unityskater,2,Tue Jun 30 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"In my experience yes. The main reason for me was that once you get deeper into a given subject finding resources for help were much harder.   Until junior year I had never gone to see a professor in office hours because I never though I was ""dumb"" enough to need to go. With math and physics there's a ton of resources online but for phase equlibria in multicomponent systems most resources refered back to the textbook I was using for the class and that point why not go see the guy who actually is teaching this stuff.  On the plus side once you get into the more specific courses (depends on your major) your classes got from 100+ students to 25 and just by going to office hours you get to build a relationship with your professors (something that seemed crazy to me until junior year). Most of the time because the classes are so personal professors may be more lenient come exam time because they know you as a person, not as a face in a class."
EngineeringStudents,3bl8og,bravokiloromeo,2,Fri Jul 3 08:27:59 2015 UTC,"I found them easier because you start to integrate the separate fundamental classes (thermo, calculus, physics, etc) into realistic scenarios (solving multi-group neutron equations and correlating that to reactor system response, in my case). You're not just solving problems with given values, you're starting to define them based on a system you are evaluating."
EngineeringStudents,3bl8og,MisterDu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't do well in my core classes, but I performed much better in my upper-division courses. I like them much better, because the exposed me to interesting problems even though they're harder. The competition is also more fierce, and it forces me to work harder."

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,falcongsr,10,Mon Jun 29 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"I have this same regret. Never failed a class before university. So never cared much about putting in the extra work to make sure I do good, that is until I failed Statics. It devastated me for a good half of the next semester, true, but then I finished that semester with a 3.70 GPA(not CGPA, mind you) cause of it."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,forceless_jedi,10,Mon Jun 29 22:14:28 2015 UTC,This is what worked for me. Failing a class changed my life.

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,StressCavity,36,Mon Jun 29 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"Long post warning (I'm really passionate about this stuff)  Find a passion, link that passion, realize your life is over if that doesn't follow through. It's extreme, and honestly you'll have to fabricate most of the mentality, but if you bear the overwhelming feeling that everything you do towards this will define the rest of your life indefinitely, it can drive you forward really hard. It's basically the mental equivalent of getting sucker punched in the face, sometimes you need some severe mental readjustment to grasp the weight of your actions. Think about the immense depression that will follow if you don't deal with the situation now, imagine the disappointment of friends and family if you dropped the ball at one of the most important junctions of your life, sit there for a minute and imagine it. If you're really properly imagining how abysmal it will be, then let that be every motive for you to make sure that doesn't happen.  It's taking things to an extreme in a way that your mind won't allow room to breath. Procrastination stems from your brain riding on every ounce of probability, even if the chance is extremely low, it'll prioritize self enjoyment to make you believe ""it's ok."" If you force yourself to predict the outcomes as absolutes, either life ends miserably or live a happy future, than dealing with that mindset becomes more bearable. Writing lists, making schedules, reciting work backlogs, that's all shit for after you've overcome the procrastinating mindset. Procrastination isn't an issue of being unable to memorize what you're supposed to do, it's an issue of being unable to prioritize what you're supposed to do, and prioritizing isn't putting things on a list, it's truly realizing the importance of something relative to everything else.   I was a slack off hardcore for most of primary school, staying up till 6am goofing off and then cramming things an hour before class, or during class 5 minutes before it was due. Basically, every other student and I was in your shoes at some point. I entered an accelerated program for my last 2 years of high school, and when I realized my ridiculous procrastination isn't going to squeeze me through, I adopted the prior mentality. It's been a few years, and the work ethic has stuck with me enough that I've relaxed my prioritization, but until I felt that my work ethic was actually a part of me, I didn't let the idea of that slip in. The biggest thing is to be hard on yourself, and not to ease up. People will say that's unhealthy, but 2 years of an ""unhealthy"" mindset in some regard may be what you need to ensure health and happiness for the other 80 years of your life."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,QuantumLeapsHigher,7,Mon Jun 29 11:57:26 2015 UTC,"This sounds reasonable but from most behaviour modification theories, positive reinforcement is stronger than negative reinforcement.  By this I mean you should ""work towards something"" (your dream job, life, etc.) instead of ""working to prevent something"" (homelessness, being poor, etc.).  But I can also see this working, as the ""fear"" is getting you into shape.  In any case, the gist I got from your post is discipline and motivation.  But from a previous past thread, motivation is encouraging but temporary.  Discipline is what will get you through this.  Discipline is what will keep you going whether you want to or not. There will be things you want to do but can't and things you don't want to do but will have to."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,StressCavity,3,Mon Jun 29 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but I felt it wasn't necessary to explicitly state the positive reinforcement. For someone who is used to procrastinating to the extreme, the implicit satisfaction of finishing early and excelling all of a sudden are huge positive reinforcements themselves.   But you are right as a whole, my method is very much a last ditch emergency plan, intended for someone who needs to make a sudden change immediately."

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,lopsiness,14,Mon Jun 29 18:05:59 2015 UTC,I've found that filling my schedule to the limit has helped me. Making it so that I have so much to do that I can't put anything off. It's not perfect but its kept me at all A's and B's the past 2 semesters.

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,hanadiode,8,Mon Jun 29 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"I highly, highly, highly recommend this. Especially working out. It puts you in a rhythm and it makes you feel better and more active.  Plus almost all of my procrastinating is done in my bed (I'll just lay down 5 minutes and check my reddit inbox... Turns into an hour, maybe even sleep). If I make my bed every day I'm inclined not to touch it because I don't like to mess up a well-made bed. Plus, it makes you feel more active to start the day with a chore."

Or ordering a Arduino and planning projects... it's been about a year now. :/  It's not just study stuff D:"

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,hanadiode,3,Mon Jun 29 18:08:55 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you man... same here. I diagnosed myself of a slight depression that makes me think (not actually think, rather feel) of what all could go wrong and what hassle it will put me in when I start this and that. And I just don't start. It's horrible.   And it seems to be some kind of social problem. Don't know... but if so many people suffer from this then there has to be some common cause for this. Something we all share. What could that be?  I assume that it is the completely crazy motherfucking overstimulation that we are all constantly exposed to. Smartphones, internet, games, TV, news, commercials, colors, noises, scents, ARGH, stop it!!! It all permanently descends upon us. We cannot concentrate on one thing because there are a thousand other things to do that distract us no matter whether we want it or not. And I think it's not just the acute exposition of stimuli but much more the chronic exposition. We are full, up to the very top with so much crap that we can't find the important things and thoughts anymore and at this point are to exhausted to even try.   So what I think might, could... should help, haven't tried yet but would love to (if only I could stop procrastinating it...) is the following:   turn off everything in your surroundings that could distract you and that you can get hold of (not the neighbor's TV, that's his own problem).  put in some ear plugs (into your ears! and, nope, not those that push music into your auditory canals!) just sit down in an arm chair or whatever you feel to be most comfortable (maybe even better outside if you're lucky enough to have a convenient balcony or garden or something else exposed to direct sunlight; don't forget to protect your skin!) close your eyes (important) just listen to your thoughts and let them wander off (try not to fall asleep) ... for as long as you can whenever you realize you're just killing time - you as well could kill that time sitting in an armchair without missing anything important but with the benefit of gaining some rest.    This might help on the long run. Because I think that's what your spirit lacks the most: silence, easing and daylight."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,QuantumLeapsHigher,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:49:04 2015 UTC,I think you are right on the overstimulation thing.  I have always liked to have some time for myself sometimes where I can just sit and stare and let my thoughts go wherever they want. I never realised before that I should try to do that more often and maybe let it knowingly become a positive thing.

Concentrate on whatever you're doing for a set amount of time and ""reward"" yourself with a break of an amount of time less than the working time.  The normal pomodoro plan is work for 25 minutes, rest for 5 minutes and after four sets of 25 minutes, rest for ten minutes.  I modified it to work for 30 minutes, then rest for ten minutes.  After a while, 30 minutes wasn't enough and I was going for longer work time.  I also like to record my progress and see a graph of my progress (the amount of pomodoros and pomodoro times) to see that I'm increasing.  It's like leveling up in a video game.  Edit: Corrections."

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,Skopos,2,Mon Jun 29 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, the pomodoro technique is the closest I got to stoping my procrastinating. I've always ignored it, I thought it was dumb but last semester I was in deep deep shit and I decided to try it, so i can focus. For a whole week I was a lot more productive, not very much, but compared to before it was much more. I was actually doing some work!

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,solidsnake530,3,Mon Jun 29 20:22:25 2015 UTC,"You might for real have ADD. People say ""oh it is over-diagnosed"" but dismissal doesn't rule out the possibility. ADD is real, can show up in brain imaging, and some people really do have it. I do, didn't figure it out until my last year of uni, which sucked. ADD has types, including ADD without the hyperactive and with anxiety.  Saw a Psychiatrist, but you might also consider a psychologist. Not sure how good that site is, top search trying to google for psychologist for ADD to figure out the difference between the two. Anyway, they questioned me, very quickly diagnosed me, were sad I waited this long to get help and started trying out meds from least side affect first. They started me out on meds because I'd already tried some recommended focus tips. After having done so, I feel real silly for how big a deal in my mind that seeing a psych would be. The meds don't just jump to the max option, adderall. Also, stimulants affect the ADD mind differently. Some people get it by different means, can't blame them for wanting to get ahead, and they super focus, like me or you with a real interesting book/project. Ritalin for me was like putting on glasses for the first time, and being like ""oh shit, stuff isn't blurry this is how it is supposed to feel to focus"". The channels stopped flipping. A ton of caffeine also helps a little, but has other effects. I was unknowingly/knowingly self-medicating with 2 or 3 or 4 cups of coffee and energy drinks.   Anyway, read ""driven to distraction"" first if you are on the fence about seeing someone. Helped me decide. Also, your uni might have a psychiatrist or means to get help/meds and resources for ADD, as well as accommodations such as longer test times. One thing that always plagued me was slow test taking.  A diagnoses will more than likely not affect a security clearance by the way, but certain meds can by the way, so think about what jobs you want to get and maybe talk to their hiring manager/your current manager before starting meds.  The pomodoro technique I found after diagnosis, and helps me immensely. You can adapt it, too. I adapted it to 50min/10 split work/break, but on rough days shorter 20/5 or 25/10 lets me get some work done that day. I don't take a break if I feel I am in a groove though, unless it has been almost 2 hours, I have to force myself to break which avoids losing as much focus later in the day. Your will has a tank, and you can't run on empty, give it time and ways to refill. Just a timer helps, visible, on my desk/phone also helps. Also I use toggl.com to track my study hours.   Also, exercise, and health such as sleep and healthy food, is at the top of my priority list now. Hour on the treadmill per day, going on walks, etc, helps my focus to a large degree after a week. Lost sleep, such as an all-nighter once or twice per week one semester to make up time lost to loss of focus (do not do this, do not recommend), as well as crap food, hurt in the long run to focus and well being. Some sleep studies now are suggesting sleep helps prevent alzheimer's, lack of sleep permanently increases your risk and sleeping extra the next day does not make up the damage. Whether that is true is to be seen, the studies are recent, but lack of sleep is so detrimental to your well being avoid it.  Anyway, sorry for the wall of text and rambling, I'm better edited at not 4am after retail work. Also, I haven't been following my own advice lately, and have no add meds due to lack of health insurance and cost. And your post sounds like me a few years back.  You can only pull yourself up by your bootstraps so much, and still not be hitting your goals. So before you are working retail with an engineering degree due to not hot gpa, take a deep breath, get help, and take care of your health by exercise and getting sleep so you don't fuck yourself in the longterm. Give yourself some allowance too, some projects will stay in drawers, some days will suck, shelf some projects for later, and focus on each one bite by bite. Make sure to start homework day of to limit anxiety, just start the thing, set a timer for an hour and work at one problem at least. Helps a ton.  Also, the library/silence thing. Going to a physical location and studying, like a library can help. ADD people though, often do better with stimulation to occupy their brain so you can focus. Basically the unfocused monkey side needs a ball to play with, otherwise it takes the reigns and daydreams raptor attacks. F-22 or velocirapter or both, have fun. I focused best at my school's student union pub in the early morning or evenings, with the din of the crowd, with headphoned heavy instrumental metal or EDM without lyrics as another layer of white noise to block out any conversation my ear would pick up and zoom in on. Also, simplynoise.com or other white noise source as an alternative to music has helped.  Engineering, especially with procrastination or ADD issues feels a lot like banging your head against a wall. Just know you aren't the only one, set aside time to work on your procrastination and health, proper exercise, sleep hygiene, diet and seeing a professional if need be, which I think you do. Also, go to your professors office hours, they can help with material a lot as long as you see them early and often, as well as study groups, just be like ""hey, can I join your group/make a group"" and bam, even if just an hour to compare difficulties/resources. No reason to drown yourself, when life rafts are floating around.  Everything will be ok no matter what. Even without a hot gpa, just a longer road sometimes. Get help, focus on health, network/study groups/office hours and you will be in a much better shape you thought possible.  tl;dr You might have ADD. Get exercise, sleep, relax. Set aside project/hobby time. Everything will be ok, avoid winding yourself up in anxiety. I'd suggest reading all of the above, sort of vented out a bunch of observations from my own experience I hope helps."

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,forceless_jedi,8,Mon Jun 29 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"I might be the odd one out, but I feel I should chime in on an experience of mine with weed.  I am generally an easy going person but that easy going attitude correlated to a ""don't want to do anything productive"" attitude.  I was generally 'OK' with that and didn't stress too much.   Until i started smoking.  Now I've never been one to do drugs or anything illegal but I've heard all the benefits of weed and thought I might try it (at age 32 mind you).  Well once I started I loved it. It makes even the most brutally boring job so much more enjoyable.  Stuff like cleaning and washing dishes. I know most people though get 'couch lock' and don't want to do anything.  Me, however, I've never gotten that way no matter which kind I smoke. I've been diagnosed with ADD when I was younger and it still affects me to this day. But when I'm high ""I hyper focus"" on the things I need to do and it diminished the ADD affects.  I used to think of all the things that I would do when I had time, but when I got around to having the time I couldn't bring myself to compete any task. It was always half-assed enough to be tolerable to my needs. Then back to gaming or TV or whatever.  So since weed, I've gone back to college to finish a degree (although most of the motivation from that comes from somewhere else), started working out, and making my own food for lunches, making furniture, and fixing everything around the house (which is constant). Most of these things I would have procrastinated to hell and back if I was sober.  There are some pretty bad draw backs though. When I don't get a fix for a while I get some pretty deep depression. Also the stigma of smoking is a constant thorn in my side.  However, the most important realization of my life came when I was high. ""I am the one in control of my actions."" It made me realize I was horribly depressed with my lack of success on anything and it  was only getting deeper. I finally took action and stopped neglecting the important things in life instead of gaming and television.  So like I said. I might be the odd one out, and I might have come to this realization without the drug, but It has opened my thoughts up to myself and stopped my mental block of procrastination."

Like some other guy said, 5 minutes of really hard work in an hour is better than an hour of nothing.   Just as an aside, I never found it to be helpful at all but sometimes studying with others is a good idea, even over Skype. I just spend an entire day doing one past paper, if I start a couple of weeks before an exam I can get quite a lot in using that method. I really wouldn't recommend using any pills, you may become dependent on them for study and that's not good. Here in the UK hardly anyone (never met anyone who has) uses them anyway. The ones who walk away with a first class or whatever are just really strong willed.   TL;DR just try and make do with what you got, kinda worked for me :)  EDIT: Most importantly, just relax. I sometimes play some guitar or play the PS3 (weirdly, not a single other platform makes me relaxed) just to unwind before starting. Just remember that no matter what happens, everything will work out alright in the end, one day."

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,twinnedcalcite,5,Mon Jun 29 10:05:01 2015 UTC,"Easiest and most helpful:   study buddy, especially if he needs your help doing it. This gives your work some kind of purpose.  challenging yourself on a student's design project. Let's say you have to design a steel beam without any consideration to joints or mass. Count joints as well. Make an excel spreadsheet for that kind of beam and that kind of joint. Find the lightest beam out there. Got to do a Rating curve for an irregular cross-section of a river by dividing it in simple sections? Go ahead and make a spreadsheet that will divide it every 0,1m or so, so that your results will be close to integral value, or go for an integral alltogether. Then go for the usual solution and compare both. Trying to find a capacitors capacitance by discharging it at different, known, resistances? Check if the resistor is scaled properly by comparing results from different capacitors.   When I had time for it, the second solution worked the most and I learned more about the classes I did it with, and scored a solid A in them, with teachers in heavy impression that somebody still cares."

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,XMT3,5,Mon Jun 29 12:39:34 2015 UTC,"2 things combined to work miracles for me. I started doing some basic concentration meditation and that may be the main thing. I also started using the task feature in Google calendar. I list every assignment and chapter to be read in the main list with a due date. Then I use another list for each assignment where I break it down as small as possible. To give you an idea of how small, my first task for each assignment is always to make a list of things to do. Sometimes I'll list concepts to study or individual problems to solve. The third thing is that I study 8-5 Mon through Friday (with an hour worth of breaks) and not outside of that. 40 hours per week is more than enough if you stay on top of your shit and especially if you make it a quality 40 hours. Free evenings and weekends are good motivation to focus for those hours."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,rockincellist,5,Mon Jun 29 12:58:51 2015 UTC,"Most procrastination comes from fear of failure.  Plus the video game instant gratifying society we live in etc. porn on demand, any release on demand immediately at our fingertips.  Everyone has ADD these days.  Even I leave very big reports to literally the morning before its handed in, or at least half of it.  I seem to do very well under that pressure at the last minute,  but I spend most of my time until that point getting my thoughts together.  There is no secret way to learn discipline.  The more you learn you realise studying is like hacking into a gobstopper, its really hard and you achieve nothing at the beginning, but eventually you crack into the gooey center and things are a lot easier.  Once you fail horribly and realise you barely do any real work throughout the semester you start to knucklle down, several hours a week, and accept that no matter how hard it is, it eventually is learnable.  You don't just sit down and learn things, very few people have that gift.  I have been around the brightest kids in the country that can read a slide and know it instantly.  The more I studied and tried to cram things into my brain without fear or pressure the better I became at it, and started to easily read a powerpoint slide and be able to retain it."

Having a therapist help you find the source of the anxiety and then working on minimizing it is an effective solution in the long term.  You are so scared of failing that you failing is a very bad cycle to get into and breaking it takes a lot of self observation and drive.  I started having CBT (cognitive behavior theory) back in 2nd year and it's helped me a lot.  I don't worry myself to the point of being sick and I can push myself better then before the therapy.  I also got better at tests.    I also have a hidden learning disability that was at the root of a lot of my issues because it wasn't caught and corrected early enough.  The testing was worth it as well since I know how to work with my brain to get what I want, instead of fighting it."

I highly recommend doing the same because I wasted a lot of time trying to figure things out myself; a therapist would save a lot of time lol"
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,sunny_bell,3,Mon Jun 29 19:41:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, go to a counselor/therapist.  I have massive procrastination problems (one only needs to see how often I post on reddit...) and a therapist helped me realize the root of my procrastination.   Because procrastination that seriously affects your life is serious.  For what it's worth, for me it's a fear of failure.  I'm scared of failing at anything, so I keep putting it off because if I actually try to do it and fail, that means I'm a failure.  But my brain is stupid and doesn't realize that if I don't do something it also means I'm a failure.  But by putting something off either until the last minute or forever, I can 'rationalize' it that I didn't do well because I was rushed, etc.  Ah.  The joys of self delusion...  I unfortunately had to leave my counselor before we really fully worked through coping mechanisms to work through this, but they can help.  And I encourage you to seek it."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,interiot,3,Mon Jun 29 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"Dude, I feel your pain. This past year something just clicked for me and I've become majorly organized. I'm not entirely sure what happened to changed it, but the past two semesters have been pretty good. My advice to you is to start practicing discipline in other areas of your life apart from studies. I'd suggest coming up with a normal workout routine and just keep to the routine. Repetition is key until you really get it down as a priority. I guess go from there. Start building up disciplines until you not only know, but feel the importance of having priorities and a more full understanding that you'll have to sacrifice something in order to achieve those whether it be time, playing video games, etc.  Edit: Oh! I almost forgot, drinking a hot beverage (usually coffee or tea) while I'm studying improves my study efficiency by like 100%. I have also been diagnosed with ADD (I don't take my adderal [sp?] so I'm not sure if that plays into anything or not. Sorry."

She cites heavily, and there were a few sections on procrastination and changing the habit of procrastination. My two favorite pieces of advice and information:  Starting work is the hardest part, but the pain disappears once you begin.  Dont work to finish, work for a predefined amount of time instead. It helps to cut the anxiety. Stop when the time is up.  That said, I am on reddit when I should be doing dishes, ~10 minutes of dishes. I'll set a timer. edit: Didnt finish them, but started right away and worked for 10 minutes. Only a few left, I'll get them after I run an errand.

Depression causes severe lack of motivation, and makes people isolate socially which only makes things worse.  Exercise is crucial for dealing with my depression.

I procrastinate at work almost as bad as I did in school. My biggest problem, I think, is perfectionism. I hate being wrong even slightly, but in real world engineering, almost nothing is ""perfect"". Every solution has downsides or drawbacks. This paralyzes me and I just don't make any decisions.  I don't think it conciously, but I think in my head if I wait to the last minute, I can rush and make decisions and if they turn out to be bad decisions, I can justify it (just to myself) that it isn't my fault since I had so little time."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,14Gigaparsecs,2,Mon Jun 29 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"I have a similar problem. For me I skip loads of lectures and cram for exam because I can only really learn from going over notes and tutorials in own time. However, I did really well in projects such as dissertation and some competitions, so this procrastination is definitely psychological and emotional. I viewed my course content as a chore and somewhat below me as I could cram successfully in 3-7 days, but I always actually ended up cramming in 1.5 days due to extreme procrastination. It is a killer  and needs to be eliminated. Why can I do so well for self driven projects but so poorly (attendance and hours wise) for module subjects? I had zero interest in study for the first 6 weeks of a module, and then lukewarm after. This strategy went well for easier subjects, but punished me badly in harder subjects like solids, dynamics, thermo and fluids. Any insights would be greatly appreciated."

EngineeringStudents,3bho74,nancy_ballosky,2,Mon Jun 29 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"Take a serious look at your life and make sure you are truly doing what interests you and brings you joy. I used to be just like you when I was in high school. I got really bad grades and didn't care because I never saw the point. Then I took physics my junior year and something clicked. I actually felt like I had a reason to try in school, because I enjoyed a class. Make sure you are pursuing a degree that interests you, because otherwise you're going to be miserable. Especially in engineering, I see people only going after the big paycheck, which I personally believe is a recipe for a miserable life. It's okay to think about what you may make in a career, but don't make it the focus. It's hard to break away from chronic procrastination. I still have horrible habits that I have to try to break. However, I'm getting better every semester because I have a goal and something I am passionate about. It also helps to look at the friends you are around. In high school I started dating a girl who did much better in school than me. Then I met her family: her dad was a doctor and all of her siblings were off to doing something impressive and unique. All of the friends that they hang around are the same way. When you're with people like that, it's hard to be noticed and almost expected that you try to be your best in life, so being around those types of people has really helped show that anyone can do almost anything if they dedicate themselves enough. I also found a group of friends at my University that have the same dreams as me and don't want to mess around on the way there. We have our fun, but school comes first. Best of luck. I used to be in the same situation as you. I got my grades back from my summer classes yesterday and I got straight A's :) you can do it, you just have to keep trying and never give up. Look at something you have done well and see why you did it well. For me it is working with other people; if I'm in my room by myself all day absolutely nothing will be done. But if I meet up with my friends in the same class, I will get done gas and have actually tried. I am dangerous by myself, so I found out that I need to work with friends.  So TL;DR make sure that you are actually doing what you love. Also hang out with people who are way smarter and way more impressive than you."
EngineeringStudents,3bho74,anchorschmidt8,2,Mon Jun 29 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"Fellow engineering major here. Heck yes on all of this. I started in business and made the change quick. Having something I truly care about and love has made a world of difference. It's a hard as crap major but I love going to class every day. It's a motivator. And to add to your ""hang out with smarter people"" advice, I also suggest finding friends who study and work harder. It makes you work harder, gives you a good resource, and they're less likely to waste a whole day playing or something.  Also I've found studying while standing (installing a white board, spreading papers across the desk and walking when thinking) is helpful too. It's not as easy to mindlessly browse the webs and being on your feet makes you feel more alert and focused. No relaxing and laying your head down."

Picking a sport (I picked table tennis and I'm loving it) really teaches your mind to get into a zone of concentration where you're only focusing on one thing and that's applicable to studying as well.   Otherwise, I would recommend building a study group and meeting at least once a week and focusing on doing work and not chatting.  The Pomodoro technique helps a lot in this regard as well."

You'll automatically get more interested & focus on the end goal.  2) no matter how long you procrastinate, don't ever give up. Pull all-nighters, funnel all that ""oh shit"" adrenaline into finishing stuff. Make sure you physically feel the direct consequences of procrastinating. Giving up is like rewarding yourself for procrastinating.  3) don't overdo it. Small goals at first. Reward achieving those goals  4) divide&conquer. If you need to do something in the future, whip up a quick .txt file now and just note down some words about how to tackle it. It's like magic. Any task can be subdivided into trivialness.   5) get others involved. Talk with classmates about your subjects.  Social pressure goes a long way."

I'm very fear motivated and in the weeks leading up to finals week I looked at all my classes and thought of the worst case scenario. I could have failed 3 out of 5 classes. Then I thought about what would happen if I failed those classes. No more engineering school. No more career in aerospace.  I even went as far as to decide that I would be a highschool science teacher (not knocking teachers, just not as exciting as engineering).  From that point on, I couldn't enjoy things that I did when I procrastinated. Video games weren't fun. Going to the gym didn't seem very important. Drinking made me more nervous than tipsy.  I guess TL:DR, remember your end goal and imagine the alternative and let that motivate you."

EngineeringStudents,3bkghf,deathlymonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:19:32 2015 UTC,"I've been through a fairly similar situation!  I started with theoretical physics at another university before I came to realise that I like the practical applications more and I also started to really like computers and the engineering behind it. Therefore I transferred to another university for a degree in Electrical Engineering.  I've just passed my first year of EE and the main differences are the projects. In physics, all that happened were lectures, working hours and then tests. Here in this discipline, they understand that we learn most by actually creating stuff so be prepared to work with your hands as well. Have you ever soldered?  However in the end when you're done, with physics you have a broader scope of jobs that you could get into. A lot of physicists could do the same jobs as electrical engineers. If where you end up is important for you, with engineering physics you could likely get into your interests.  If you also give a shit about your time on the uni and want to get started on stuff like robotics now, you might prefer transferring. There is a bit of overlap between engineering physics and electrical engineering so you might be able to make some arrangements about the curriculum, but that's up to you and your uni system."
EngineeringStudents,3bkghf,Quickitt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"Depends on how reputable your Engineering Physics program and Engineering school in general is as well. I personally know that pretty much anyone with a good academic standing when they graduate from Eng Phys at my school will find a job just as easy, if not easier, than a MechE/ElecE grad. At my summer job (more focused on communications and logistics than engineering) I talked to an Engineer there who said he had a friend who graduated from Eng Phys at my school who is now the lead project management engineer at a large manufacturing company. So that goes to show you can find jobs with an Eng Phys degree, even if they are completely unrelated to Eng Phys. With that said though, if you want to actually utilize the high level physics you learn in your degree as a job, you'll have to go to grad school.  You also might find this post I made a while back interesting: https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2lpl45/engineering_physics_graduates_what_are_you_up_to/  But to be honest the best advice I could give you based on my knowledge is:   If you are enjoying Eng Phys, stick with it and you can probably find a job just as easy as any other grad. If you are not enjoying Eng Phys switch out and you can probably find a job just as easy as any Eng Phys.    There's no point sticking with Eng Phys if you're not enjoying it (since there's no chance you do research in an area that doesn't interest you). But if you are enjoying it, I say stick with it."
EngineeringStudents,3bkghf,Jorlung,0,Tue Jun 30 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"I studied EE from the beginning. I have actually met people who graduated with an EP degree, and they said they couldn't find a job anywhere. They did not go into enough detail in any engineering field so people didn't think he was qualified. So he actually was starting to go back for a masters in EE because he needed to in order to become marketable. On the other hand where I work in Electro-Acoustics we have physics majors and engineering majors and verything is really interdisciplinary so you could probably do the work we do here after some extra learning, because there aren't really any acoustical engineering programs out there so you are not expected to come out of school an expert in this field. With how many recruiters I have contacting me I have found it is a rare skill set for this reason. So there are some jobs out there you may be able to get.   But I have just personally heard it is hard to get a job with that degree. And as far as how hard of a program itis EE and ME are also incredibly difficult degrees, so EP doesn't stand out there. Did this teacher that said ""you can do whatever you want to do"" give you examples of jobs that gradeates have done? To me that response sounds like such a cop out. You should be getting internships every summer, if you can't find internships, you won't find many jobs when you graduate. Does your school's career center have examples of open jobs right now for EP majors? How often do employers come to the school specifically to talk to EP majors? At my university it was like a different major company every other week was at our EE building talking to students about coming to work for them. No joke. It was cool becuase that meant lots of free food, they always had free food of some sort. So I mean if you don't see anything like that, or you don't have a career center or something that has resources I would be worried. All engineering fields are hiring right now, I soo thousands of open positions all over the place. If there isn't much for EP I would be very worried."

You have the kind where you get to do things, there is also the other kind where you do nothing for 3 months. Its not ideal that the projects are too hard for you, but as such there are many valuable skills or lessons to get out of this. You could get better at researching problems, planning your activities, organizing your thinking, talking to people, and building professional relationships. Since you probably have quite some time left, maybe you'll actually finish the project by the end. Maybe your current problems are just trivial in the grand scheme of things (perhaps why they won't help?) and next week you'll find somewhere online with the right solution. Just keep your head up and work through it.   As for your coworkers, you can't force them to do anything and tbh professional relationships with them are probably worth more than whatever you can learn in three crappy months. Figure out what makes them tick, have casual conversations over lunch, get to know them, endear yourself. Even if you haven't finished your project in 3 months you could have learned plenty and built a solid foundation for your professional network."

Don't be afraid of conflict, (healthy) conflict is necessary in a team (see The Five Dysfunctions of a Team).  Not sure how the company you're working for works, but set up meetings with your peers to talk about your project, and what you need to learn. Set up meetings with your manager as often as you can, also, before you're done with your internship set up meetings with upper level manager to talk about your experience, ask more about the organization and get to meet them and ask them questions.  It is important you make connections with people, get to know them a bit, and then ask about work, all you will have after you leave (besides adding that you your resume) is the connections you made and the things you learnt, and you have the potential to learn more the most connections you have."

Our current intern is fucking useless because when I am busy and ask for his help, it takes more time to explain to him how to do stuff than it would have taken me to just do it myself. Therefore I just let him sit at his desk and play with his phone all day.   There is a balance to strike.

Remember to always be proffesional even when you are frustrated. If you can get some time set aside at a later time, research on your own until then. Even if it's fruitless you will find new resources. Also make sure your not asking the busiest person in the work center as that person is probably incredibly busy.

This will put me behind but since I have transfer credit from HS PSEOP classes, I have some wiggle room later on in my schooling (which I would prefer to have more open, but what can you do).   I have also accepted that I will reduce my hours in the machine shop (10 to like 3).    Honestly, having taken statics, I understand the material somewhat but so many different factors made this past year difficult.

EngineeringStudents,3blgl4,yosimba2000,2,Fri Jul 3 20:57:57 2015 UTC,"It depends on what kind of engineering you're working on. From a biomedical engineering standpoint, the only other time I used polar stuff aside from math class was in my Circulation Physiology, which is essentially Fluid Mechanics, class.   If you're trying to determine flow in a cylinder, it's best to switch to a cylindrical coordinate system. If you're working w/ spheres, you can use Spherical coordinate system. However, the polar stuff we used was essentially just knowing what each variable represents (eg. theta in cylindrical = angle, theta in spherical is the longitudinal angle, etc). However, I highly doubt you'll be needing to plug in x=rcos(theta), etc. to derive the polar equation sets from the rectangular coordinate sets (that's pretty hard). Just accept the equations as gifts from mathematicians :D  Oh, and the polar coordinates stuff was in... Calc 2 (the integration section) I think. Or maybe it was the first half of multi-variable. Regardless, in an undergrad situation I don't think you'll be needing too much of it. However, that's not to say it's not important...  Also, just for Calc learning, I'm sure you already know about PatrickJMT, KhanAcademy (great visuals here for Multi-Variable!), and Paul's Notes. However, one thing most people don't use for the beginning Calc classes are the AP test prep books. Remember the ones from Princeton/Barrons? Those are very very concise and easy to read and understand. Be sure to pick one up (I used the Princeton brand one)! And don't fret about taking Calc again in college. You learned it once, the next time will pretty much be review.   also let me say im still a student, not in the industry :P"

I'm almost always one of the first people to leave, but I score sorta middle-of-the-pack, depending on how much I study.  Meanwhile, some of the guys who did the best took the longest.  So long as you're finishing and passing the test, you should be fine."
EngineeringStudents,3bl2t4,AluminiumSandworm,2,Tue Jun 30 02:53:51 2015 UTC,I make an effort to stay as long as possible.  Test situations are really stressful so it is really easy to make mistakes.  I find staying longer to read over everything helps. Average grade for my courses are between 50-60% and I always score 85% or higher.
EngineeringStudents,3bl2t4,Ebulus,2,Tue Jun 30 03:41:15 2015 UTC,"I used to worry about this until the following happened: We were taking a chemistry test, and this one guy turned in his test before everyone else, he walked up confidently and turned it in, I was thinking ""Damn, he must have owned that test"". I turned my test in last or close to last. A few days later I saw that one guy's test grade as the teacher was handing them back; he got like a C or something unremarkable. But I got an A. From then on I realized that when you turn the test in makes no difference. That's happened a few times since. A lot of people just want to get it over with quickly and they don't spend time reviewing their answers."
EngineeringStudents,3bl2t4,carl_sagans_ghost__,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"I get time and a half for tests because of my ADD and the test anxiety which accompanies it, and even with time and a half I use the entire time provided for me. Aside from the anxiety, my ""slowness"" can also be attributed to taking my time to answer the questions as best as I can, and double checking my work. So... yeah.  Prior to my diagnosis, I wouldn't actually be able to finish exams which obviously affected my grade negatively, even though I attended every lecture and took great notes and studied and did homework, etc., doesn't matter how hard I worked--I struggled so much with timed exams. When my doctor diagnosed me and helped get me on an effective treatment & helped me to get test time accommodations, my test scores GREATLY improved. If you think you have an issue, talk to your doctor and explain your concerns."

EngineeringStudents,3bj0rz,jampge,5,Mon Jun 29 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at working towards a BSME don't get an MET. Just go straight for the BSME even if it takes longer to do anything. An AS MET won't get you anywhere you aren't already, even a BS MET typically won't get anywhere but a tech position.  Most MET programs won't get you anywhere in a BSME program and you won't be more than a semester closer to it than you already are. IMO it's not worth it."
EngineeringStudents,3bj0rz,AuroraFinem,6,Mon Jun 29 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"As others have said definitely do not go for the AS MET. IT likely will not get you any further than you are now. You could always go to a school that has a BS MET program as those can be worth the investment. Unfortunately, BS MET is looked down upon as compared to BS ME but taking and passing the FE exam is a good step towards parity."
EngineeringStudents,3bj0rz,whatsnewb1,2,Mon Jun 29 20:40:43 2015 UTC,"At my county college you can get an associates in MET or Engineering Science. One particular professor always begins his first class of the term explaining in detail how the two are alike and different. He states very clearly that they are two distinct paths and an MET degree won't get you very far if you want to be an ME. The Engineering Science associates is what you want for becoming an ME. Compare the university ME and the local college's MET curriculum. You'll see some similarities but maybe a 1-2 years of non-compatible classes.    If you're serious, definitely talk to the dean of the local college because this is probably a common question. At my county school, once you get your associates MET degree, one of the nearby colleges will pretty much take you on as a Junior for their MET bachelors program. There's no need to try to go from MET to ME in my situation unless you really want to. Maybe something like that exists in your area."
EngineeringStudents,3bj0rz,soingee,2,Mon Jun 29 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"I don't want to spark a debate as to whether or not getting an engineering technology or engineering degree is better but I currently am a ME major who works with a lot of machinists and welders at my current internship, so I have some experience working with those people and where their career advancement can go.  First I would say you need to specifically define what the job is that you want, or what advancements you would like to make. A mechanical engineering technology degree will definitely be advantageous to have but often the credits WILL NOT TRANSFER to a pure mechanical engineering program. The name of each degree is very similar but the classwork for the ME degree is much more difficult. A person with either degree to me is usually capable of doing the same type of work, but the one with the engineering degree is going to get paid more and have more chances for advancing within a company.  The machinists and welders usually will hold that job title for their entire career and usually don't have the mobility to move up within a company, getting a MET associates degree may change that but you would most likely be an hourly paid technician.  If your desire is to become and engineer, I would strongly advise that you go to your community college and start taking math and physics classes or anything that will transfer as credit to a university. If this isn't your thing, you can always get your AAS or BS in MET. You are making a good choice by going back to school, just think about what you really want and see what degree will get you there."
EngineeringStudents,3bj0rz,HipToss79,2,Mon Jun 29 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"Am I wrong in my thinking?   Not at all, although afaik with a AS MET degree you'll very likely be in a technician position which may or not pay any better than your experienced machinist one. You'd need to look up positions in your area, as it sounds like you'll working near where your wife is going to school.    A BS in ME would move you into an entirely different bracket and position, which considering your work experience may or may not be enjoyable to you.   Personally, I'd love it if more MEs had a strong machinist's background. I'd get to spend less time telling students, ""No, you cannot physically make that,"" ""No, SLS is not a reasonable manufacturing method for a simple bracket,"" and ""Not every part needs to be a weldement!"""
EngineeringStudents,3bj0rz,Scrtcwlvl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.   Most of my machining experience is with aftermarket automotive and firearm related components.

I apologized for asking one guy, who is on my team, a ton of questions. His response? ""You're supposed to ask questions... you're an intern. If you knew everything it would be creepy."" Since then, I've learned that people are completely willing to help. I'll ask random shop guys for help machining something, or a designer what their thoughts are on my idea.

I've heard of students gaining admission to prestigious institutions such as Oxford University and Heriot-Watt with a HNC, rarely in Oxford's case but it does happen. You could also go on to study a HND in Mech Eng. Personally this is the way I would go as it gives a qualification in easily attainable short stages. Whether you go down the HND or BEng route make sure to study in a university as they will have superior lab equipment for materials testing and links with industry relative employers.

The technical skills and experience are far more important aspects in the prioritization and problem-solving expected of engineering managers.

Many universities have BS-MS programs, but it's something that current BS students apply to in their 3rd year; not something incoming students apply to. I've never seen a combined BS-PhD program.  The applications for undergraduate and graduate degrees are different, and handled by different departments.  If you want another BS, you'd have to apply for that, then later apply for a separate graduate program. No one is going to guarantee you admission to a MS or PhD program just for getting in the BS program. Any equivalent classes would transfer - you wouldn't have to take all the basic calc and intro classes again - but you would have to meet any differences in the programs (like if the university requires more writing classes or something).

EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Mathiaaz,118,Sun Jun 28 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"I have seen two sides to this.  One one side: Many engineering students loooooove to feel superior to others. They hate on damn near every other major because they give up lots of personal time and want/need to be recognized for it. Although they are not engineers yet, so I have no idea why they act like they've already completed the degree. Almost anyone can be an engineering student, doesn't mean they will finish.  On the other side: In America, the title of engineer is not protected (basically anyone can have the title of engineer). Many engineers with an engineering degree dislike this, feeling that it cheapens their degree since they worked so hard for that piece of paper. This is especially true when people with degrees such as engineering technology who have a title such as ""Process/Project Supervisor/Superintendent"" and call themselves engineers. It is somewhat common to have this happen, I have met at least one person at each of the three plants in which I have worked who call themselves engineers but have a technologies degree or a process operations degree.   It's also just as annoying to many engineers when engineering students refer to themselves as engineers or like at my last internship ""Summer Engineers"". The latter of which I refused to take part of. My email signature had the title of ""Project Department Intern"" because I am aware of people who have the view of students not being engineers and will let it affect how they interact with you."
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Willskydive4food,18,Sun Jun 28 21:23:29 2015 UTC,"As an EIT I'm not even sure I get to call myself an engineer. Am I an ""engineer, in training"" or am I an ""engineer-in-training""?"
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Conkeldurrrr,4,Sun Jun 28 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"It's highly dependent on the company/country I would imagine. However I have never seen anyone officially call themselves an engineer in training in an official sense (in emails), usually just ""Process Engineer/Maintenance Engineer etc"".   Do you normally introduce yourself as an EIT? When do you feel you will get to call yourself a full fledged engineer?"
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Willskydive4food,7,Sun Jun 28 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's part of my title so all of my emails are signed with ""Bridge EIT"".  I'd probably get the full fledged engineer status when I get my PE.  If I'm meeting someone within my field I'll introduce myself as an EIT. If someone asks me what I do I'll just tell them I'm an engineer."

EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Conkeldurrrr,2,Mon Jun 29 01:41:46 2015 UTC,"EI and EIT are official designations for people who have passed the FE, graduated from an accredited institution, and been recognized by their state for doing so. Whether it's EI or EIT is dependent on the state, and I'm fairly certain EIT is a lot more common (and definitely more accurate/less prone to confusion).  As an co-op/intern, your company shouldn't be calling you either one."
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Jason_OT,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:52:50 2015 UTC,"I'm full time so it's my job title. My state used to issue the EIT but now it's EI.

EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Conkeldurrrr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:02:13 2015 UTC,"Being full-time doesn't change that it shouldn't be your job title unless you've passed the FE, graduated, and been issued a certificate by your state board (I assume this isn't the case from what you've written). And even then, it's still not really a job title but a modifier to a title. EI and EIT may only be certifications, rather than licenses like PE, but they have very specific meanings in the engineering world that shouldn't be used for those who do not hold the qualifications.  I passed the exam a few years ago, but took my sweet ass time paying PCS to send my results to my state board, so I only got the certificate late last year and it's still EIT in Massachusetts."

For what it's worth, I looked up other people who have the same job description and it fits pretty nicely.   I'm sure as shit not an engineer, though. I work with a bunch of engineers. They run their ships and can take their assigned responsibility from from beginning to end without needing to hand the reigns over to anyone else.

EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,Willskydive4food,4,Sun Jun 28 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"As long as your co-workers don't mind, there shouldn't be a problem.   I worked at an extrusion plant for a co-op term when the maintenance engineer quit to go to GP in Georgia. I took over several of her duties and some of my mentor's while he shifted his focus to other parts of her job until a new engineer was hired (took longer than my term lasted).   Since it was a small plant they had me take call duty one weekend (mainly consisted of documenting the cause of the process going down and making a decision to call the plant manager or quality control engineer if need be or to call out extra maintenance workers if need be in the case of one of the above not answering their phone at 2 am).  But hey it's great to bring up in interviews.  I also did much of the purchasing and general maintenance direction/downtime analysis. I was hourly and was given almost unlimited overtime to accomplish the new workload since I was payed only $17/hr and I took full advantage of these circumstances to add projects and experience to my resume, it was a great experience. I got a letter of recommendation and was able to initiate a project where we were able to eliminate a projected 96% of our annual chemical cost. (Our chemical vendor had been selling us a chemical meant for a closed loop system while ours was open to atmosphere and we were burning through chemical. I really need to call and find out what the actual number was.)  I was told to call myself engineer when speaking to vendors in order to more easily get services provided to our plant and have the vendors be more responsive.   Overall the co-op was an ego boost but I still felt like I shouldn't call myself an engineer since I had no diploma hanging on my wall."

Technologists are not represented by the same body as engineers are where I live (for us it's APEGA and for them I believe it is ASET) and its quite annoying when someone tells me they are an engineer, and then reveal that they do not have an engineering degree, but instead have a technologist diploma.  I have nothing against technologists, it just gets under my skin when they claim they are Engineers and they aren't even represented by the same association as each other.

However, as far as I'm concerned about what I call myself at work, I work with degreed engineers and most of the higher ups are degreed engineers and to me it's a matter of respect.   I look at it like medical students doing the same work as physicians, they don't call themselves Dr. (although I am aware that M.D. is a protected title and engineer is not).   I stated in a post above that some engineers do take issues with this and I am aware of that fact, right now I am playing the game of ""Getting a job after I graduate"" and it behooves me to subtly show them respect."

EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,photographic_mammory,2,Mon Jun 29 02:42:10 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live, you can get into legal trouble doing that.  An engineer is more than just the work you're doing.  An engineer is a person qualified and certified to do that work - if you don't meet the qualifications and have the certifications, you aren't a professional engineer, and using the engineer title may get you in trouble."
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,cant_read_adamnthing,2,Mon Jun 29 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"In the US, as far as I understand it, that would probably only apply to a PE. I don't think many engineers that don't do consulting work (outside of civil engineers) get their PE license."
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,photographic_mammory,0,Mon Jun 29 02:43:50 2015 UTC,"In Canada you can only use the word engineer in your job title if you're either a professional engineer or some provinces allow engineers-in-training to use that term.  Only professional engineers can call themselves professional engineers, though."
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,photographic_mammory,2,Mon Jun 29 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"The reason AME is ""allowed"" is because the AME gets licensing from the federal government via Transport Canada.  Because of this they can get around the laws which restrict the use of the word engineer, which are provincial and therefore federal law supercedes provincial laws.  They are not allowed to sell themselves as professional engineers, even with the license they acquire - they are licensed aircaft techs with a holdover title.  Private companies and people cannot get around this rule.  Microsoft, for example, lost a case against the Quebec engineering body and then lost the subsequent appeal over the use of their ""Microsoft Systems Certified Engineer (MSCE)"" designation, which is not a professional engineer but may lead someone to believe the the holder of that certification is.  Instead they retired that title and changed it to ""Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE)"".  So no, I'm right, you just happened to pick one of the few jurisdictional exceptions."

Obviously any time when they have interns taking on important tasks there will be a solid support structure in place and you will never truly be independently responsible for much, but I've found that having to option to just be thrown in at the deep end has been really beneficial as a learning process.   I could be 'in charge' of drafting up and procuring a large fabrication one minute and the next minute could be undertaking some of the key structural calcs. Everything that I do gets monitored and moderated by a more senior engineer almost like passing them an exam script but i find that the amount of red pen that comes back to me is slowly decreasing over time. Thoughts on this approach? This is at a small company so I appreciate that this may not be possible at a larger organisation   Note that this is in the UK where ""engineer"" is also an unprotected title and many engineers share the same concerns as those in the USA by the sounds of things, but I don't necessarily think that allowing undergrads to use the title of ""engineer"" or even ""student engineer"" is necessarily a bad thing. For one thing, when you are dealing with suppliers and clients they are much more likely to take you seriously if you have engineer in your signature rather than intern."

MET can take you just as far as ME in my opinion, but the really smart ones in ME are the ones who take full advantage of the degree. I believe that you should know the technical hands on side before you go on to know the theoretical ME side. For example, how can you design a part, such a housing or whatever, without knowing the ins and outs of the method of manufacturing that part?  I'm in a similar situation as you where I am having a hard time in ME. I chose to focus on hands on engineering which gave me a competitive advantage in job searching. My 2nd internship I was a CNC machinist, which many MEs believe is a job for non college educated people. This is true, but this experience gave me a unbelievable stepping stone to go on to greater internships. A thing that employers loved to hear was something along the lines of, ""I can design and think ahead better than the other guy because I know how to machine parts and the whole process of manufacturing from tracking stock material to finishing & shipping"". I not only ran machines, but did QA inspection, and some shitty manual labor stuff like sandblasting and rework. Focus on your strength of the practical, and I think if you're still interested in ME I would go for it. Even though it might be really hard, I am sticking through it and find that a great help is to find ME friends that are smarter than you, this really helps with understanding material. If not, you can still go far with MET, what's helping me a lot is in my current internship is a senior ME works with me everyday and I learn a lot from him."

Even then though there will probably be some back and forth on how stuff is tolerances or designed.

Have a basic knowledge helps but you by no means have to know any detail on how it will be made beyond machined or cast ect."

To boil it down to well if you can't fabricate your useless just isn't realistic. In fact unless you work in a really really small company the people designing aren't going to even touch a piece of fab equipment especially for a production piece of equipment. So is the FSAE competition supposed to be a skill building activity for students to take a project from conception to build or just a way for some students to slap a go cart together?

EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,petropunk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:57:43 2015 UTC,Ya I graduated awile ago. I want them to succeed but they have a lot of work to do to change. The idea is great. They had just lost track of the true purpose and from what I heard from people still around they still have a long way to go.
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,CouchMountain,9,Mon Jun 29 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"Because, in general, engineering students know nothing about the profession and are always looking for a reason to feel superior.  Once you get into industry, there's little difference between the 4 year degrees in 90% of jobs. Sure, BSME has a higher ceiling, and BSMET a lower floor, but there's a whole boatload of room in the middle there where skills far outweigh the specific degree. When you start getting into the areas where BSME would make a big difference over BSMET, you also start getting to the areas where an MS/MEng is going to be preferred anyway.  I graduated with an engineering BS, from a school with a ton of 4 year engineering technology students. The BSET graduates almost universally interned as engineers and went on to full time jobs as engineers (and rarely some garbage like sales engineer or systems engineer). IMO, comparing fresh grads from both groups, the ET kids often have a leg up because of their more practical experience."
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,petropunk,7,Mon Jun 29 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"I think it depends where you are. In Canada technologists are more established and most of the flak we get is mainly on the internet. It seems like especially in the US people don't distinguish between technologist and technician, and generally don't consider that technologists actually do design work.   I guess if you're an American and you're caught up in the university game, watching technologists talk shit might be insulting. Our education costs almost nothing, carries zero prestige, and can get us most high paying management jobs they are going for. That's gotta piss off some people."

At my school they have the engineering school and then they have another campus for engineering technology majors. All I know is that their program is more hands on
EngineeringStudents,3bfsoe,notavalid,4,Mon Jun 29 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"BS in Engineering is mostly theory.  BS in Engineering Technology is more hands on and all projects.  One teaches you a wide area field of study so that you have tools for the future. The latter teaches you do the job you'll do in the future.  EDIT: I wrote a sentence a wrong.    ~~Unless the job requires a PE, people from either discipline can do the same jobs. ~~ Engineering and Engineering Technology can do all the same jobs, PE or not."

Doing electrical networks, statics, dynamics, and damn near every other course during the last two years of an engineering degree requires advanced math like multi-dimensional analysis and differential equations.  But don't get me wrong. The experiences and skills gained in an Engineering Technology degree are invaluable to a project. Where I work, we've got engineers working with technicians and it is pretty clear who does what. Engineers derive solutions for specific problems and work on designs to optimize our products for our clients needs and the technicians do some amazing work to get those designs into reality working brilliantly, ready and tested in time to ship.  There is a fair amount of communication between the ETs and the engineers, just as much as there is communication between engineers of different types. I've also heard that in some places, ETs and engineers perform identical tasks. I just know that where I am, that isn't the case. An ET with an idea can bring it to the engineers and the engineers would consider it for what it's worth. Sometimes, it's brilliant, sometimes it's not.  But any good engineer respects their technician/technologist and vice-versa."

For example, if you got a degree in MET, you would have to take more math classes if you wanted to get a masters of engineering, or a masters of science IN engineering."

Three of my classmates had worked as technologists for a while (8, 6, and 5 years, respectively) and are back in school to get their engineering degrees. Their reason for returning to school for engineering is their technologist careers do come with a pretty low glass ceiling, and they'd all gotten to a point where their career advancement stagnates and upwards mobility is limited by their education.   That said, bear in mind that in Canada the designation ""engineer"" is held in very high regard and is controlled by the respective provinces' Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists. Unless you're a PEng or a PGeo you won't get the authority to sign off any projects."

I think it really depends on your school and how they want Tech to be viewed, my school is trying to change from tech to engi (but sadly wont graduate students until I'm long gone).  For me COE wasn't much more challenging then CPET - some of the courses were faster paced, but a lot more boring and at the end of the semester I felt like I couldn't put the application to real life scenarios.  In my CPET classes I learned a whole lot more, partly because all of my profs where older guys around my parents age who had worked in the industry prior to teaching. I learned the same stuff, but since everything had a lab/real life scenario attached to it I understood it so much better.  One thing I find ironic is that (in the past) Engineering courses where straight theory, whereas now engineering schools are swaying towards hands on teaching."

The only reason I'm in it is because I know that is what I enjoy and the only thing I want to do. There is nothing else I'm interested in.   I have actually tried to speak to a healthcare professional before but it has never actually come through and it takes a lot for me to gather balls to do so and it just has never come through and it fucking hurts so fucking bad. Doctors have told me that they will find a counselor/therapist for me and they have just flaked. The phone calls have never come.

EngineeringStudents,3bgw1p,infindei,4,Mon Jun 29 07:26:17 2015 UTC,"I battle depression too, so I get the struggle. Finding help is the hardest part, but in order to succeed you really need to overcome this and gain the tools you need to not let depression get the worst of you. I personally found the first few types of medical help useless, but eventually found Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to be great. Don't depend on others or flaky doctors (I don't trust them), the internet has a plethora of resources to find places for help.  Don't give up engineering. Yes you may fail physics, but it's not the end. GPA isn't everything, experience and motivation is a huge component you can communicate through essays and recommendations. One option might be to switch majors into a related field such as computer science to boost up your experience and your GPA. Additionally, there are many programs that will pay you to network and get experience over summers such as Research Experiences for Undergraduates.  PM me if you want to talk, it's really important to face the depression if you want to succeed."
EngineeringStudents,3bgw1p,mnk88,11,Mon Jun 29 03:43:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry this got kind of long. Just want to share some of my own backstory with you.  I thought I had depression and anxiety for most of my life. I was not an excellent student, but by no means was I unintelligent, considering around age 12 I was self-teaching myself how to code websites and computer programs from scratch... but for some reason I was not able to ""do"" things that most other people would ""do"" -- i.e., in high school it is practically a miracle that I graduated considering how many times I left class early to walk the halls. I felt miserable most of the time anyway, so I would just think, ""what does it matter?"" I failed out of college my first two attempts within the first semester each time. I struggled to pay attention, and would end up not going to class, then would feel terrible about not going & then sink into a depression... which would lead to me continuing to not go and not do homework and essentially fail exams and then fail my classes. Which, obviously, did not help the depression or anxiety and only made it worse.  As for your comment on exams --even when I really WOULD try to study and do my best, I would have full-blown panic attacks. As in, extreme anxiety before the exam... blank on every single thing and forget everything I studied for... and then mental breakdown afterward because of KNOWING I had failed it, because I could never finish the whole exam due to not remembering how to solve for multiple questions.  In my mid-twenties I went to a doctor about depression and anxiety, and I explained my struggles and how I wanted to do my best in college but I felt that this ""fog"" in my brain, the weight that I had always carried since I was a kid, was preventing me from being successful. I knew I was capable, but for some reason my brain wouldn't let it happen. He suggested I didn't really have depression or anxiety, but rather had lived undiagnosed with ADD my whole life and that the depression and anxiety were offshoots of that struggle.  He started me on medicine to see if it would have a positive impact, and it did. It was like I could see and think clearly for the first time in my life. When I looked at exams, I didn't blank like I used to. Plus, I was able to get test time accommodations (such as time and a half to take an exam) considering my diagnosis. I was finally able to attend class and focus. I was able to retain information. Even my classmates were able to tell a difference.  In my two years of community college I ended graduating with honors, earned an invitation to an engineering workshop last winter at NASA, and got a full-ride when I transferred into my four-year. It was not easy by any means, and I had to work really hard to create great study habits and essentially ""rebuild"", but much of that success is due to my doctor having enough insight to see beyond what I thought was simply depression/anxiety.  Not saying that this is the case for you, or that you should self-diagnose, but please--if you current doctor(s) have not been able to properly diagnose or treat you, do not give up. Find the one who listens to you. If this is what you want, you must make it happen. You have to find a way. No one can earn that degree for you, so you must identify you areas of weakness and figure out WHAT is standing in the way and you must develop a plan on how to overcome that.  Side note: What is it about Physics II that is so challenging for you? For many engineering students, Calc II and Physics II are the hardest courses they take, so you should know you're not alone in your struggle. But with Physics II, what have you done beyond your textbook or tutors? Have you tried watching lectures from other professors at other colleges on YouTube over the material? Have you gotten any supplemental books to help you work through physics problems? (I bought a book of 3000 Physics Problems to help me through.) Have you made appointments during your professor's office hours to talk to them one-on-one and have them explain what isn't clear? These are some examples of other steps to consider when you ""develop a plan"" to overcome this issue."

EngineeringStudents,3bgw1p,MalakElohim,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, first off, see a professional. You need help for your depression and you need it fast. Your life is not worthless, it may all look dark, but once you beat depression you realise just how wonderful living can be.  Now as for your capabilities, it sounds like you are capable of doing engineering but you suck at testing. I suck at testing, not as badly as you but you're not going to be doing exams in the workplace, you'll be working. I don't know how to beat exam anxiety, it might be connected to your depression/self doubt, but it can be fixed. And if you want to progress, you need to fix it, exams don't prepare you for the workplace, but they are what we have at the moment so you have to do them. You'll probably have to see a different professional to get help with study techniques as opposed to someone who specialises in mental health.  But if you are seriously contemplating suicide, call a suicide hotline and talk to them about it. I don't know where you are so I can't give you a number, but google should help you with that. But killing yourself won't make anything better for anyone. Not you, not your family, suicide is the worst possible option, but at the moment you can't see anything else, that's not because there are no other options, but because you simply can't see them. Get someone to help you find those other doors to open.  Good luck."
EngineeringStudents,3bgw1p,757babycakes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'll reiterate others on here that say to seek some professional help.  You might also try talking to your professor to set up a private exam time; maybe some extra time will take some pressure off you.  Profs are people and their usually reasonable.    As for the physics part, without knowing what specific parts of E&M you are struggling with, I'd recommend checking out a Student's Guide to Maxwell's Equations by Daniel Fleisch.  It explains some important E & M concepts very intuitively and breaks down each equation.    More importantly though, find a professional to talk to.  You'll never be a successful engineer if you let all that stress keep you trapped inside your own head. Good luck"

You study with said tutor, you nail everything with the tutor, you think you're set, you get to the test, you see the first question isn't what you studied, you sweat a little, tell yourself to calm down, scroll through a few questions, realise nothing you studied is on this test VERBATIM, panic sets in, those little worries are now HUGE, you glance at everyone working through and think to yourself what the ****??   If not.... you are on your 3rd try, IMO it means you're doing something wrong, you just haven't figured it out.  I suggest you drop the course and return to it when you settle a few things, if possible.  I think you can achieve your goals but you have to get over this life hurdle. 3rd time taking the course, eh?  So how many problems have you done?  How many past exams have you done?  IMO after 3 years, you should have done ALL of them.  I hope reddit moderators call help for you, no disrespect, but saying you will off yourself is a serious RED FLAG.  Going to end off with something you probably don't want to hear but MAN THE FUCK UP.  Fuck suicide, you're 24 years old, sooo many things to do in life, why kill yourself?  Why let the professor beat you by giving you an exam that you couldn't beat?  FUCK that I refuse to let a professor beat me with a piece of paper.

EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,BrokenEngineer,2,Sun Jun 28 22:12:09 2015 UTC,UoT is pretty expensive compared to UBC but the international rate is still comparable. It's crazy but the government subsidizes local students not international ones.
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,salierniwasokay,2,Sun Jun 28 22:33:20 2015 UTC,"Is it that crazy though? We subsidize Canadian students because they're families are tax payers and citizens of the country. International students have never paid a dime in taxes to the Canadian government. Maybe it sucks for them, but I think it's perfectly reasonable that international fees are where they are."
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,BrokenEngineer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:09:20 2015 UTC,The craziness is the huge difference in price. I agree that it's reasonable but it's just kind of amazing to see that 30k difference.
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,salierniwasokay,2,Sun Jun 28 23:18:28 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Apparently, the price that internationals pay is what Uoft (for example) would charge all students if it was a private university. Makes me really grateful that universities (for the most part) are publicly funded up here!"
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,unityskater,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:20:00 2015 UTC,"For Canadian schools is it just international vs ""national"" students or does going between providences matter like in-state vs out-of-state like it does in the U.S.?"
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,2pu200,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:10:18 2015 UTC,Province doesn't matter. If you're a Canadian citizen then you'll get cheaper tuition.
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,salierniwasokay,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:26:01 2015 UTC,"If you look up tuition at different Canadian schools, you'll see that there are only 2 categories: domestic and international. Domestic just means that you're Canadian, so (most) schools don't distinguish between provinces - they just look at whether you're Canadian or not.   NOTE: Schools in Quebec are actually an exception to the above though! For Quebec universities, they have 3 categories: Quebec residents, non-Quebec Canadian, and international. For example, at Mcgill, engineering tuition for someone from Ontario would be $7k/year. However, if you're from Quebec, it is just a bit over $2K/year! That's ridiculously low! (And for internationals, it'd be $34k/year)."
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,BrokenEngineer,4,Mon Jun 29 13:42:49 2015 UTC,It's still much cheaper as an international student for Canadian schools. Still expensive but cheaper than the US.

EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,photographic_mammory,2,Sun Jun 28 21:35:24 2015 UTC,I just read up on it - you're definitely right.  They cover tuition and you need to cover cost of living.  You also need to learn German before showing up (there's a language exam).  And you're even allowed to work part time when in school.  Pretty amazing.
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,HipToss79,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:40:40 2015 UTC,"It is pretty incredible that they even give you money to help you live. I swear if I had known about this I could have learned German (my best friend and his wife speak German) and started applying. I have three more semesters of school and I'm done with my degree so at this point it kind of wouldn't make sense.  I still for the life of me can't understand why nobody in the United States thinks that doing something similar would be a good idea. It's really frustrating to watch as other students don't have to struggle through school getting paid complete crap at minimum wage jobs (while usually still having to take out loans) while practically starving to pay tuition and expenses while still trying to make good grades.  The amount of student loan debt I've racked up getting my engineering degree is staggering and I don't even go to a top tier university.

EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,wadamday,5,Sun Jun 28 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"Community college would be a great option, especially if it would defer you from being drafted. You would still pay higher tuition due to being ""out of state,"" but substantially cheaper than a university. Also you can easily apply now to start in the fall. Work part time and find roommates to stay with while you are in school to avoid going into too much debt. If you're looking at UC schools in California, the community college system is great. Assist.org tells you exactly what courses are needed for transfer so you don't have to risk community college courses not being accepted by your university. If you complete your lower division courses, your high school grades and SATs won't count, so you potentially even get into berkeley if you do really well."
EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,Secretly_Italian,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:27:23 2015 UTC,I also want to add you might be able to work on establishing state residency while in community college so you will qualify for better financial aid once you transfer.

EngineeringStudents,3bf7nw,ptitz,3,Sun Jun 28 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have very much experience with loans, but I would advise you to be three times as careful when you apply for them.

I would say come to the states and do two years in community college to cut your costs overall, and then transfer in to the state college of your choice. After you have two years of college classes under your belt, and if you get great grades, you can apply for scholarship after scholarship to help pay for the remainder of your education."

There might be people here that can help you out but honestly you'd have to give a better explanation of where you're doing your apprenticeship and what you'll be working on.

However, if you are willing to really put some time in, you can most likely do it. It is all reliant on math, so if you truly feel that math is a weakness that cannot be improved than maybe it is worth switching. Just do some soul searching, get away from the whole ""this is hard but I could make money"" thing, and think about what you actually enjoy and not what you think you should do or your parents think you should do. If you dont truly enjoy it, than it is not worth your time and money. And also, dont stress on the GPA too hard. If you can get and hold a 3.0 GPA you are fine.

Unfortunately, not many engineering programs run on Mac. As a solution, I simply had to partition off part of my MacBook for Windows and used Bootcamp so I could dual boot.

EngineeringStudents,3bg6yq,MerpdyDerp,2,Sun Jun 28 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's like 60% to 40% (maybe 70% to 30%), windows to macs. Macs are pretty common, you'll see them all over the place during lectures. I know of a few graduate programs in EE where they supply Macs to their students, so compatibility really isn't a limiting factor. And there is no recommended screens size, that's all your preference.  Put it this way, you don't even really need a laptop for engineering, you could get by using library computers and a home computer. It would just be really inconvenient.   All I'd recommend is not getting a cheap computer that won't be reliable, then a year and half down the road, half way through your third semester, it breaks down and you lose all your files for that semester. You'd be fucked. With Mac, that won't happen. And with a quality windows laptop, that won't happen. The rest is just your preference and the cost you're willing to pay."

EngineeringStudents,3bg6yq,infindei,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"Don't buy a mac. In terms of the price/performance, it doesn't pan out. In terms of software compatibility, yes you can get by, but it certainly isn't easier than a PC. In terms of what most everyone else is using, they will mostly be PCs. There is usually a single person in my 50 person classes with a mac, rest PC. School lab computers are usually PCs as well, so you will have to learn/use the PC interface anyway.  My advice? If you can drop the $1200 on a mac, spend half of that building an OK desktop that is nice and forwards compatible and more powerful than a laptop, and spend the rest on a surface pro. They are way more lightweight and easy to carry around, which is something that I didnt think would really be a big deal until I ended up switching to a tablet. It is seriously great, and being able to have matlab and solidworks on your tablet is great.  Ultimately, you make the decision, and if you really want to get a mac it's your prerogative.

I mean performance wise there's definitely better options, but I keep it around for gaming and usually use Ubuntu for other general use.  I understand its a personal preference, but personally I find OSX difficult to use, even coming from a somewhat linux background.  That and your essentially paying for the apple logo, as you can buy similarly reliable laptops for much much less."

Some people simply just do not like Windows or OSX, so saying things like ""Do not buy a Mac for any reason"" is unfair. Many of their products have very good and reliable engineering, although they are definitely overpriced. I have had other carefully selected computers fail on me quite quickly, so I personally enjoy the reliability and customer service. That said, I also run windows and linux on other systems (actually my old mac is a linux now...for reasons)."

I currently work in a plant setting but want to get into aerodynamics of cars. I have tried but been unable to get a job close to that.   My advice is if you want to get into the car industry the best place to start is in any job in the car industry, even if it a job you don't care for. You at least have your foot in the door with the company and have industry experience.  Also if you can get above a 3.0 cumulative GPA in MechE or any other engineering field you will find that it is not very difficult to get a job in the field you want."

EngineeringStudents,3bfcik,Gyang193,3,Sun Jun 28 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Southwest Michigan where it seems like everyone works for the auto industry. It's not a particularly competitive field, and there's plenty of opportunity. If you aren't speaking working for the big 3, you still have opportunities with the countless suppliers, contractors, and all the other companies that benefit from the auto industry. You can get pretty good pay, and the cost of living isn't bad. That last part is specific to here and could vary by location.   The downside is that you are relying on the auto industry. During the 2008 recession, people were losing jobs left and right because companies couldn't afford to keep them. Many companies went bankrupt and others suffered huge losses. Though there are others that did fine because of good management or working for companies outside the auto industry.   That was more than I was planning to write, but I hoped it helped. I don't know what things will look like in the future, but I think they'll be okay for a while. It's up to you to decide what you want."

However, I do know of a few people who have had great success both being admitted to and succeeding in engineering grad school with a chemistry degree. CHEM is a difficult degree and colleges know that, and there are a number of masters engineering program which are pretty chemistry heavy, such as Environmental and Chemical (obviously). In my opinion it might be best to finish the BS with the minor and then go for the MS. Masters programs for engineering tend to be only one year anyway and then you'll have two degrees!"

EngineeringStudents,3bglqn,Oxidation_State,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:02:45 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for grad school but it looks like you could get a BS in ChemE if you're willing to either spend an extra year in school or take summer classes.  You've taken all the required pure chem classes like gen chem and organic, but you're probably missing stuff like DE and vector calc that chemE's at your school have already taken. That and you haven't taken the introductory ChemE courses like mass / energy balances & fluid mechanics/dynamics that are prereqs to the higher level courses.  You'll most likely be starting over as a sophomore ChemE in some respects. If a high paying job is really motivating to you, then make the switch but know that ChemE and Chem are very different degrees when you get to higher level courses. Make sure you're truly interested in ChemE before you switch."

EngineeringStudents,3bglmi,dragoneye,2,Mon Jun 29 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I went to a university with both Eng Phys (Fizz) and Mechanical engineering. I graduated a few years ago and work with people who have both degrees (mine is in Mech).   Fizz is essentially an applied physics and math degree. They get way more theoretical knowledge than the mech department teaches, but do a little less practical work. Upper year courses are often shared.  Many Fizzers start their own companies or go to grad school with their degrees. Those that go into industry may be more comfortable programming or with the math behind the work, but they aren't better or worse prepared for most engineering jobs.  Personally, I wouldn't hesitate to just finish the Fizz degree if that is where I started. I chose mech because I'm more of a practical hands on type rather than theoretical person, but I probably would be in a similar place regardless of which degree I took."
EngineeringStudents,3bglmi,DrSloan,2,Mon Jun 29 05:09:33 2015 UTC,"I'm currently enrolled in the mechanical specialization of Engineering Physics (Fizz) at my university. Wouldn't have chosen any other degree. On top of the fully accredited mechanical engineering degree I will receive, I will graduate with several physics, mathematics, electrical, and programming courses. My Fizz program is typically 5 years, but many students will choose to do it in 6. Each student in the program is enrolled in the co-op program where we have access to many job postings in industry and research and will generally complete 16 months of co-op work come graduation. I have classmates working for big companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Tesla Motors. Some companies nearby will actually prefer to hire Fizz students if they know of the program. Other classmates have been accepted to schools like MIT and Harvard for graduate studies and some have even started their own companies. This degree can take you anywhere really.  Most of our classes are shared with the other engineering/physics/mathematics students, so we do receive similar education compared to those degrees, but the program does have its own courses. We have two capstone projects, one in 4th year and one in 5th year. In 2nd year we take an intro to prototyping course where we design and build a fully functional autonomous robot during the summer. Each semester can be pretty intense where you can typically take on average 7 or 8 courses (on a 5 year schedule), whereas the typical course load for ENG is around 5/6. Some classmates have even gone as far as 10 courses in one semester. Depending on your interests you can receive a lot of hands-on experience, especially if your school has hand/power tools, mills, lathes, waterjet cutter, 3D printers, etc. Your program might have tech elective requirements where you can choose courses that suit your interests and not necessarily fall under MECH.  If you would love to really know how things work and also receive an engineering degree (assuming your school is similar to mine), choose Fizz. It'll be difficult, but it'll definitely pay off if you're willing to put in the hard work. Upon graduation you'll come out with a great work ethic, strong fundamental knowledge of how things work, solid engineering background, and some good hands-on experience. Read up on your program and see if it suits you."
EngineeringStudents,3bglmi,Jorlung,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:07:01 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on the ABET thing if your school is not ABET accredited, depending on your state you either will be ineligible for a professional engineering (PE) license, or will need more experience before getting it.

EngineeringStudents,3be5pl,CMagex,3,Sun Jun 28 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"The difference is huge.  A ton of math vs a ton of programming.  You're venturing into engineering when you switch this major, that means you need calc 3 and diffyq additionally and many circuit classes.  The rest of your classes will be programming classes for the most part."
EngineeringStudents,3be5pl,Dustinfl,2,Sun Jun 28 16:14:54 2015 UTC,I switched from comp sci to comp engr like you last year. First 2 years are pretty much the same in terms of workload and courses. Then you take EE courses which are probably a little harder than the upper comp. Sci classes but obviously this depends on where you go. From what I've heard comp. Engr. Is taken more seriously when you're on the job hunt. As a comp engr who has 10 classes left before graduating I often  feel overwhelmed with all of the material I feel I'm supposed to know. Hardware and software are very different beasts. Try and find something to focus on and so some personal projects based on that.
EngineeringStudents,3be5pl,hugababoo,2,Sun Jun 28 14:04:55 2015 UTC,"Haha. Some ppl here are saying the EE courses have a lot more math. While I feel great about it, my job opportunities are a lot lower than that of CSEs and CS students. At my job fair, most of the companies were looking for CS students. Practically all of them.  I'll speak of my experiences at my school. I'm an EE but I have plenty of friends who are CSE who swapped to CS because of signals and systems which is an EE class of course and the second hardest of our ""2000"" lvl classes behind fields and waves. We have three levels ""1000"" for freshman. ""2000"" and ""4000"" level courses for different stages of an undergrad.  Hell, the president for our CSE/EE department was a CSE who swapped to CS because she hated the work for Signals.   I honestly dont know what the course load is like for CSEs but I do know ppl hate the EE classes with a passion. Very smart people who got high GPAs don't have perfect GPAs because of EE professors giving them a B in an EE class.  That's just at my school though. I read everywhere for my school that people who still swapped to CS blessed the fact that there were a lot more curves than in the engineering department.  While its a lot of boasting for EEs and I do feel bad, CSEs/CS are doing better than me and my friends in job searches. I know people with their own start up companies, working at Microsoft, working at Amazon, working at National instruments, working at Google, etc.  I'd be lying if I said that I didn't see more high GPAs in the comp sci field than I did for the Engineering field though.  Tldr; EE classes are pretty hard and most of the time I haven't seen a person swapped from cs to CSE. A lot of the times the opposite way."
EngineeringStudents,3be5pl,ReaperOfProphecy,4,Sun Jun 28 18:30:33 2015 UTC,CE is civil engineering. You can't just take the abbreviation for something that was here first and use it however you want.

So the application gets forwarded to civil which has no record of said student so they deny it. Then the student freaks out because they just see denied for their application. At least once a month for the last month or 2 of the semester we get emails that ""The appropriate abbreviation for computer engineering is CPEG""."

EngineeringStudents,3be5pl,DisWastingMyTime,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"This would depend on your school's program, I can only speak of what I know in my program.  Here CompE has 25% more course load overall, about 2 courses more each year and 1 extra year compared to CS.  It also has less focus on math and more on applied math, so instead calc 1 2 3 linear 1 2 in CS, in engineering it would calc for eng ,applied math 1 2 and linear algebra for eng, of course now there's also physics which is easier for me but harder for some, and then hardware the first two years are strict, nothing to chose, in the third and fourth year you get to chose subjects to specialize in, in you could (which is done my most) specialze in software exclusively. The program is fantastic in my opinion as it allows CompE's to have every important* course that CS has and then some, you end up having a wide vision, no blackboxes, nothing beyond your comprehension."
EngineeringStudents,3be5pl,TheBeard86,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"Computer engineering, like every other engineering discipline has a lot of different prospects and directions. It also varies by school as to what computer engineering really is. Some schools computer engineering is basically software engineering. Other schools computer engineering is hardware with more programming. Other schools its a mix of software and hardware engineering. Its hard to say what your experience would be like without knowing the school or even more, knowing the electives you have available or plan to take.  I have a BS in EE and I am finishing an MS in CompE. People who came into CompE MS with computer science background had a much more difficult time since they know the programming but lack any of the hardware understanding. This would be similiar to undergrad as well. Many universities are going to have hardware based requirments that you will be missing out on. Also, might have some physics and math requirments you didnt  need as CS but need as CE.  For jobs, again it really depends on the interest. I work in semiconductor and the jobs are big, the market is big, the pay is big and the outlook is big. Not all markets are as big, and some are bigger."

Durring school I had an internship at a company and worked in a research lab. These are great for resumes. I found my current job through the schools career fair.   Project development is a very large field and question. I am what would be considered a project manager and individual contributor depending on the project. Some projects I just do what a project manager asked. Others I get to delligate  and direct. It's a fun and crazy process. Lots of work but very rewarding.   Team member work on projects in all sorts of manors. Email and phone calls are the most common, but so are face to face, webex, and skype type calls.   I work in manufacturing, hands on is a requirement. It isn't taught in many classes but is absolutely nessisary.  I have two modes, office work and field work. Office days are pretty typical. Go to work around 8, work on my project for 8 hours then go home. These are fairly independent days that I get to manage my own time as long as my deadlines are met. Field work is a different animal. Work may start at 6am, 8pm or anytime at all it depends on the customer. I may be working 16 hour days to meet a schedule I may only get 6 hours. It's a total crap shoot. Those days are non-stop all hands on deck work. Very busy, but man do those days go fast.  In manufacturing we are on the up, manufacturing will not decline, especially with more automation by job just gets more busy.  I have had a few rolls, from low level associate engineer to project lead and a few on the way.  Work load varies. I do travel a lot but I'm home most weekends. When I'm in office mode I'm home every day at 4, I make my own schedule, and I see my wife all the time. In field mode I can't tell you when I'll eat next. It's hectic and I'm usually out of town in a hotel. I don't have any kids so for now this job fits me. In the future that will change and I'll changes roles, but for now I have a good work life balance.   Cons are the unpredictable hours, long days away from home, and eating on the road.   Engineers must be well rounded. If you are the best in the world at X and only X but you need to integrate X with Y and Z you are screwed. Lots of this comes from just being able to problem solve and experience. But that's what the first year or two of working is for. Seeing anything and everything.     I hope this helps."

I am studying in electrical engineering in Germany.  Some general advice though: If you want to invent new stuff and there is no innovative company that fits you, you might want to consider staying at the university after you finish school and get a Masters/PhD and as a Post-Doc afterwards. However, I do not know how they pay in Australia. In Germany it's alright, but usually you get more money in the Industry.  At the school I am, we also have a ""(bio)medical engineering"" specialization in our program. Students studying that, also have classes about basic medical stuff.

Unfortunately the current political climate isn't very friendly to STEM or research funding.   I was put in a team with PhD students and one of them quipped that $500 a week is more than what they were getting paid. He might be joking, but either way if you're adamant on the research side of things I doubt it will exactly be easy. Postdocs will fare much better though, but that's even further down the line. Who knows how things could change by then, there would be at least 2 federal elections before you start looking at a PhD.  I digress. But yeah as /u/badumudab has mentioned industry is generally a better option so focus your research on what you can do there or maybe overseas. I also second having a look at biomedical engineering. I don't know about your options in Queensland but at UNSW you cannot do biomedical engineering by itself, without combining with another engineering major (5 years total).  Look harder.

EngineeringStudents,3bcinv,Ramton,2,Sun Jun 28 00:20:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion. English-language textbooks aren't a problem at all. I must say I read some reviews on the book and they weren't very favorable... Lots of typos, notation all over the place, disregard for the control side of things and very outdated sources. Do you think these are valid criticisms?"
EngineeringStudents,3bcinv,WiggleBooks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:48:12 2015 UTC,"I second J.J. Craig, though there are some topics that aren't very clear straight from the book. I would supplement this book with Stanford's open courseware robotics class. Particularly when you deal with Jacobians."

EngineeringStudents,3bcinv,hephaestusness,3,Sun Jun 28 03:17:19 2015 UTC,"I'm in a class that uses John J Craig's ""Introduction to Robotic Mechanics and Controls"".  It's a good book as far as having plenty of examples and stuff goes.  Not sure if it's translated though."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,failedmymath,50,Sat Jun 27 14:56:24 2015 UTC,Ask for a year to prove yourself. My dad was the same since I got a 2.4 gpa my first semester. I asked for another year and I brought it up to a 3.1.   He was more understanding and supported me after I showed him I had a bad first semester.
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,silentempest,24,Sat Jun 27 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a reasonable option, and just realize that in electrical engineering, stuff like Differential Equations is important, so make sure you keep up with the math even if you don't like it much. (I know personally I've always done worse in my math classes than my engineering classes, but be better than me. )"
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,DrShocker,9,Sat Jun 27 15:16:36 2015 UTC,"Yup. Actually I did poorly my first semester cause I treated it like highschool. I changed my ways and presto, Im doing much better."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,silentempest,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"I was the opposite, sort of. I wanted to drop engineering after I got a 1.33 and it took several times to pass Cal A. Mom has pushed me to stick with it since it is something I'm interested in.  Got a 3.0 last semester (end of my second year)."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,SingularBread,28,Sun Jun 28 03:43:41 2015 UTC,"Why did you do poorly on the exam? Was it because you didn't study or haven't seen the material? Or is it because you simply don't care about the math? The first two can be worked with. The last is a bigger issue.  For what it's worth, I placed into precalc my first semester. I'm now in the process of getting my Ph.D. The placement test really says nothing about your abilities other than being an indicator of what you already know (I was lazy in HS and didn't take calc) as long as you're willing to put in the work. Eventually, it will all be new material, so whatever you knew coming in is less relevant.  I think you're doing the right thing by recognizing that you don't know what you want to, and taking active steps to bridge those gaps. This kind of behavior will serve you well as you learn.   As far as your mom - she may mean well, but is showing it poorly. I think the important thing to know is that everything can't, and shouldn't, be about money. Be sure to remember this when you do start, because one of the best ways to tank your grades is to burn yourself out by not taking a break."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,VortexLine,19,Sat Jun 27 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"They don't get to choose what you major in. Only whether they support you or not. The only way to change your mom's mind is by succeeding. My advice is this, take precalc if you didn't do well in math during high school. I started college in algebra and trig (same thing as precalc) because I sucked at math coming in. It gave me time to solidify my foundation before Calc 1, which is a brutal class.  You need a solid foundation even if it takes more time. I'm sitting with a 3.62 in my senior year of EE, so it's definitely possible to come back from a poor math background. You just need to put in the work."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,jefffey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"Same story here... started university not knowing what sine and cosine were. Failed calc 1 twice before I got my shit together. I graduated with a 3.8 in physics, and am now a grad student. Take your time, and learn the shit out of your math, and everything else will come. As for non supportive parents, you get to be an adult now. If they are not willing to support you, then that is their problem not yours."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,csp256,2,Sun Jun 28 13:21:10 2015 UTC,"Started my master studies of artificial intelligence without having the foggiest notion about statistics and probability theory. It's a question of commitment, I think. If it's something you like, just do it, no matter how good you are when you start. If you're devoted to something, you'll get better over time."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,SeveQStorm,14,Sun Jun 28 15:30:57 2015 UTC,"The best things you can do:  1) Recognize your success or failures are your own doing. Understand that whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right. It's a mental game.  2) Understand that math in college is not like math in high school. Even though you feel confident that you will fly through your courses, don't rest on those laurels. I'm taking Differential Equations right now, but I promise you that Calculus II was the most difficult math course I have taken, and many others can agree with that statement.  3) A really great book for Calculus (and possibly for you, since it does a review of pre-Calc) is The Humongous Book of Calculus Problems. It's clearly written, explains step-by-step how it solves a multitude of calculus problems, but also says WHY--which is the important part for later when you need to figure out what you're going to do to solve a problem. When you get into Calc I and Calc II, online resources like PatrickJMT on Youtube or Khan Academy are also great for supplementing what you learn in lecture.  4) Put in the work. You will have to make hard choices on how to balance your time, and the amount of hard work and studying you can put in will directly correlate with your time management skills.  5) Change your attitude about the full-ride. ""Even if I flunk out it wouldn't cost us anything""-- get the fuck out of here. I earned a full-ride scholarship to my university as well, but it was after working my ass off. If it weren't for that full-ride scholarship, I wouldn't be able to get my degree because I come from an extremely poor background that offered little to no opportunity. It is a HUGE blessing and a HUGE responsibility to receive a full-ride, regardless of how ""cheap"" your university is... many, many, MANY people would love to have a full-ride anywhere. Don't waste it. Know that the money could have been given to any other student, but they gave YOU a full-ride. Prove to them that it wasn't a mistake. Don't let thoughts like, ""Even if I flunk..."" even cross your mind again. Replace it with something like, ""I have an opportunity to get a college education thanks to a full-ride, an opportunity not everyone gets. I'm not going to mess this opportunity up. Failing is not an option."" This links back to my first point."

If you are not at least solid with calc 1 and 2 and diff eq by your sophmore year, you are going to have a bad fucking time as an electrical engineer."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,WeAreInfinitesimal,8,Sat Jun 27 17:36:39 2015 UTC,Take sure math courses at a community college. They will probably be smaller class sizes so it will be super easy to get the help you need. I am about to finish up a chemistry course like that and I have actually learned so much and done very well with only one class to focus on. Even while working on top of it.
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,DH8814,3,Sat Jun 27 15:49:52 2015 UTC,"Also, this.  It is so much cheaper to go to community college.  I got credit for the same courses as everyone else, will graduate with the same exact degree, and saved myself almost $30k in tuition by going to community college first."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,RKO36,8,Sat Jun 27 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"You got this. I was an art major for my first three years of college, had never had a physics class before, and was a solid C-student in high school math. Wound up in physics by accident (literally, long story involving a thunderstorm) and found myself fascinated by math because I'd had a real shift in attitude about it since hating it in high school.  I have worked my ASS off. When it comes to math, physics, and I'm assuming engineering as well, if you're gonna make it, ""you're going to suffer, but you're going to be happy about it,"" because you find the material genuinely interesting even though sometimes you will ask yourself why the fuck do I do this to myselfI'mdying. But, no, yeah, fast forward four years from that damn thunderstorm and here I am, taking my ""personal math crown jewel"" (complex variables) over the summer, recently realized I'd only have to take one extra math class I never intended to to pick up a second math degree instead of taking extra physics classes for my ""gotta catch 'em all"" attitude for my school's course offerings, and all I got left on the physics degree is quantum I & II. (So... I made it. Didn't even think I'd pass intro physics I tbh but I just didn't give up)  I mention all this, because I am NOT good at math either. I still don't think I'm very good at math, but I have an undying fascination, respect, and love for it because it's the most beautiful thing in the universe as far as I'm concerned. But, JESUS, my mom's always tootin' my horn bein' all like PARAB0LOID IS A GENIUS I AM SO PROUD OF MY GENIUS DAUGHTER SHE'S GONNA BE A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER ONE DAY!!!!!!! (I am not a genius, I just work hard), so the fact that you don't have the kind of support and cheerleading I get from your parents really upsets me tbh.  Also, I personally WOULDN'T try and test out of precal. It's really important, and all of my friends who tested out of different math courses regret it because their foundation isn't as strong as those of us who didn't. And the more math you do, the more you develop your ""math brain,"" y'know, just the thought processes, and the more developed your ""math brain"" when you get to calc the better off you'll be. (There's also definitely a ""physics brain,"" too, I work in my school's physics tutorial center and I constantly reassure the students that come in that intro physics is almost the hardest in a sense because you don't have that thought process yet and it all seems arbitrary and foreign.)  Also, your attitude of the challenge being worth it says to me that you absolutely have it in you. The challenge of math and physics versus art (for me personally, I'm good at art, I just got burnt out/bored) is what kept me interested.  Idk I kind of want to take you in and help you out, because, hey, if your mom won't believe in you, then I will. Actually here's a list of my favorite math/physics resources and I think you'd find them super useful.  You got this. Tell your mom to fuck off n quit hatin cuz you got this."

EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,mathamphetam1ne,6,Sat Jul 4 02:49:52 2015 UTC,Prove them wrong.  It doesn't matter if you need to take precalc.  I did too because I did nothing after high school for three years and I never learned it as well as I would have liked anyway.  I think it was a great thing to take that course because if you're weak in precalc or trig you will not get through engineering.  Everything depends on being able to work with algebra and trig with you're eyes closed and hand tied behind your back.  Prove your family wrong.  Do what you know you want to do.
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,RKO36,5,Sat Jun 27 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"When I was just getting started in our engineering program, I had two different professors say at different times that hard work and discipline are much more important to success in engineering  than being smart.  I have seen this myself.  I have classmates who can build a raidio for fun over the weekend or program in half a dozen languages,  but they're gonna graduate with a C average.  Some of them are our most sought-after tutors!  But they're barely scraping by in their grades because they don't go to class or can't balance their time.   The point is, if you have the drive, the math will come.  Pre-cal and Cal 1 are very systematic courses.  Repetition and drills are usually sufficient.  Cal 2 is where things go off the rails for most folks because you end up having to relearn a bunch of subjects that you didn't use in Cal 1.  See if you can get her to lay off you long enough to pass this retest in August.  Strike a deal with her."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,KurtWagnerX,5,Sat Jun 27 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't even place into precalculus. I had to take college algebra first.

If it's the latter, you'll have a tough time in engineering because you'll be using math all the time."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,FiiSz,5,Sat Jun 27 20:55:52 2015 UTC,I did worse than you on my math placement. I started in college algebra and I had a ton of success in college.
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,Conkeldurrrr,3,Sat Jun 27 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Make a deal with your parents.  You have already taken the steps to fix your problem and it looks like you have a really good game plan.  Ask them to give you a shot at it for the first year and if you really can't do it still, then you will either switch majors or get a job.  If you can't do it, that's ok.  There are other routes you can take until you can do it.  I have a friend who just finished a 4 year contract in the military because he couldn't handle school right away.  He took online classes while working until his grades were better, and is now enrolled in an ME program with a full ride from the government.  If you just have to press forward, you can also consider electrical engineering technology.  It's very similar to regular EE but the curriculum is much less math intensive.  Another route could also be to go to vocational school and get trained as an electrician.  It's a fairly profitable field, it will help you do what you love until you are ready to be an EE and every vocational guy you work with when you get into the industry will love you: Sometimes engineers have a tendency to understand the theory really well, and not really understand the issues posed by actual application."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,birosjh,2,Sat Jun 27 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"Besides the lack of family encouragement, I'm right there with you on math. Didn't take the placement test seriously, ended up in PreCalc. Asked for PreCalc 1 and 2 in the same course, but only got PreCalc 1. Got a 40 on my first midterm, worked my ass of and made an 87 in the class. Took Calculus in the Spring, had lots of help and study time, but none of the PreCalc background, and still made a B in the class. I'm taking an 8-week Calc 2 class right now, and just made a 98 on my first exam (it's community college though). My point is, no matter how bad you screw up once, you just gotta tell yourself ""it happened, and now I have to get through it"". And you do. Because you're an engineer. There's nothing else you can do, nothing else you want to do. So just work your ass off because it's what you have to do. You're on the right track, but as someone else said, ask for a year or maybe even 2 since it's paid for, to prove yourself. After that if you don't want to do it or you end up doing poorly, you gotta make a decision. But worry about that when that comes. For right now, just work to earn what you want."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,WillFerrelsNuts,2,Sat Jun 27 15:39:41 2015 UTC,My calc professor actually advises students take the pre-calc course at a community college after calc 2 just because pre-calc is so comprehensive and people forget a lot.

I have no idea how to do half the shit students bring to me without looking through their book.  That being said I don't know that it would be worthwhile to retake it if you've already taken calc 2.

EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,EpicDermis,2,Sat Jun 27 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"It's all on you.  Getting through engineering is tough - there's a lot of work, you have to learn fast, and you have to have the mental fortitude to push yourself to finish and work even when you don't want to, on your 5th hour of homework that night, or whatever.  No one can help you with your family issues but you.  But remember that this is the easiest this will ever be - it only gets harder from here.  If you can't solve the issue with your mother now, its not going to get better and you aren't going to have more time to solve it."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,photographic_mammory,2,Sat Jun 27 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"A person is neither ""good"" nor ""bad"" at maths. How you do on maths tests is a reflection of how hard you have worked at maths, and very little to do with ""innate ability"". So your mother basically has no idea what she's talking about.   The best thing you can do is move out, if you're able. Having lived with fairly...demanding...parents, and having moved out, it is so much easier when you can hang up the phone or leave when they start on that bullshit.   Do you mind if I ask what gender you are? If you're a woman, this sounds like it could also be somewhat motivated by sexism."
EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,candydaze,2,Sun Jun 28 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"Because it's easiest for me, I'll give you my advice on how to improve your math skills and retain the knowledge for decades to come:  Continue with your classes on Study.com. They will help a lot. But supplement them with Khan Academy. The best way to learn a subject is to approach it from as many angles as you can. Using two resources approaching a problem in different ways instead of just one will help you gain a deeper understanding of mathematics or really any subject that you wish to learn. The best way to learn is to hear it, read it, observe it, practice it, apply it. That's true for everything in your life. Keep that in mind always when in college and you will be far more successful than most of your class (there are others who understand this and the outliers who defy it).  As for your personal situation: can you go to the library? Can you escape your house and go to a place that is quiet and where your mom won't find you? That will allow you to at least take a break from being in your home.  For addressing the problems your mom has with you. Don't yell at her ever about it. That will just make things worse. Try to keep calm around her, ask to sit down one night and explain exactly what you're doing to help yourself succeed. Lay out your entire plan for catching up on math for her. And if she doesn't listen to you, that's her problem. Block her out. Wear headphones. Do whatever you can do avoid her until you pass, and if you're determined you will pass, the placement exam.  Even if you don't pass the placement exam with as high a score as you'd like, oh well. Remedial math classes are nothing to be ashamed about. Many people struggle with math because they didn't learn something fundamental that makes everything after it make sense. Identifying this is difficult. But once you do, you will soar.  You didn't learn math the first time because you didn't pay attention. Never beat yourself up over this. It happened and it's in the past. All you can do now is live with it and work to improve yourself. You are on the right track to do that. You've made a plan and you're trying to stick to it. And you know what, if you make another mistake, own up to it at least to yourself and do the same thing again: identify a solution and work to make it happen. That's what engineers do. We find a problem and we find solutions to that problem.  If you believe in yourself and if you put in the effort, then you will succeed. I know a guy in my graduating class, he started out in remedial math courses. But he never gave up, he's now well above average in every one of his engineering courses. He's had an internship every summer with a big engineering company. He's succeeding because he never gave up on himself. You can be like him, just don't give up.  We are here for you to vent. We are here to talk to you. We are here to help you through engineering. We've been in or are in the same boat as you coming into an engineering program woefully under-prepared (even the ones who thought they were the king of the world for getting a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam). But we're all here to share experiences. To share knowledge. And to help each other out. Sure we're all strangers to you, but that doesn't mean we don't want to help out.  Don't give up on yourself. Don't let your mom make you doubt yourself. You can succeed. You have a full-ride scholarship. You have what most students dream of having. Make the most of it while you have it. Never give up on yourself or your dreams. Always give 110% even when that means pulling an all-nighter three times in a week. And most importantly, try to have fun. You'll need to have fun to get through college without going insane.  Edit: I forgot to mention something. Reddit is an evil, horrible, despicable time-sink that you should never ever visit. Now that that disclaimer is out of the way, we know you won't be able to stay away. So make an account of just the subreddits you use to find out stuff about engineering/science/technology. Have no defaults on there. Have no funny pictures on there. Have nothing that isn't relevant to your education on there. Use that for daily browsing. That way, even when you're fucking around and not studying and trying to waste time, you'll keep learning. I did that, except it's my main account."

EngineeringStudents,3bb3pv,klima94,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:04:28 2015 UTC,"Well, well, well. A post I can directly relate to!  I'm currently a mechanical engineering student at a state university, taking junior level courses. I actually had a similar high school experience: graduated with a 2.7, placed poorly on placement tests (just never studied, like ever) so that I had to start college taking college algebra! I did well, though, and after that worked my way up through precalc, Calc I, Calc II, Multivariable Calc (Calc III), and I just finished Intro to Differential Eqns (Calc IV) this last semester. Depends on where you go, you may to take more math like Linear Algebra (one I highly recommend), etc. Currently have around a 3.0, if I remember right.   The key? You have to want to get it done. As in, you have to be there to want to learn. You have to find a way to make yourself want to study on a regular basis. The biggest hurdle that I have faced (and still face, actually) is not developing good study habits in high school. The best advice I can give you, is if you know you want to study electrical engineering and there are certain areas you know you are interested in, then make all your goals oriented towards that. Nip any bad habits you have in the bud right now  (can't stress that enough) and face every single semester with the goal of learning as much as you can about that which interests you in EE. Build amazing, not OK, not decent, not good, but awesome study habits, and it will pay out a hundredfold or more.  You can definitely do it! I did, now I'm taking classes that are actually kinda fascinating. That's what you need to push towards if this is something you want. Only you can decide that. Use your time wisely. Will you remember everything you learn even if you go through with this? Probably not. That's not the point. The point is to demonstrate that you can learn it. The math skills will come in later when you have to actually apply it in other course you are taking.  On of my biggest tips for retention: try to learn it a style that you will remember. If you don't get something, do not be afraid to ask questions. Ask your teacher first, but also use your classmates, teaching assistants, learning centers, tutors, other teachers, online YouTube videos (Khan Academy, PatrickJMT, etc.), your textbook, other math books/reference material. If, after your freshman, maybe sophomore year, you have the ability to put a check mark next to most of those and you have the time investment to show you do study, and you still don't understand anything, then might be the time to reevaluate how you want to be spending your time and money. You could try a Technologist program if your school has one (not sure if there is one for EE, but it tends to be less focused on higher math and more on tech processes).  Others might try to sell you on that you might not want waste the money and time now, and interpret the writing on the wall. I'm not gonna tell you that. It's up to you to decide. I do firmly believe, however, you won't know for sure until you try. If you don't want to spend nearly as much money, look into local community colleges that offer those math courses, and even possibly some calc based physics courses (unlikely they have them, though).  Stop worrying about what your mom wants you to do/thinks is best for you. If you want to live your own life, and learn some interesting stuff in the process, then make your goals based on your own final decision. You can't let other people run your life for you. I am living proof you can do it if you genuinely set your mind to it have persistence and patience"

I'm n I genius others in class got a higher score doing less than me but my point stands that the math will get worse.  However! Do not go into engineering out of spite to try to prove your parents wrong. Go into engineering because you want to. You have shown an interest and that's good, so provide THEM with a backup plan at the same Uni. an ""easier"" major as they say. And tell them, give me a semester and prove to them you can pull off ___GPA. If you start having doubts yourself, you have something to fall back on.  I don't want be Debbie downer but I love planes. I almost got a license, and I can tell you any plane if you send me a picture of it. However I discovered Aerospace Engineering is alot physics. I hate physics. I never passed a single exam in my AP physics class and regular was a joke. Now in uni. the exam part is different but I still failed 2/5 exams. I simply can't physics. So I sacrificed. Why put myself through the physics to be with, let's dace it, a hobby or just some talent I have spotting the differences in planes.   TIL: Create a backup plan (similar major) to your parents at the same uni. and give yourself and them a semester at uni."

I find it bizarre how a parent wouldn't want their kid to be an engineer, as if that's a job that someone would be ashamed of.  That's crazy.  In the end, grow some balls and realize its YOUR life, not hers.  Do really well in your first semester and prove her wrong.    BTW, stating that you built a computer as if its some big accomplishment is rather comical... and stating that you're terrible at math, but still somehow want to be an engineer simply does not go together.  Follow some online math videos now before the semester starts and get prepped for precalc and calc, as well as your coming physics and chem classes, but in the end RESULTS are key.    If you want to shut her up for now, how about proposing this temporary solution:  remind her that there are no real engineering classes till your late sophomore or early junior year.  Tell her you're going the engineering route for now, but you'll reevaluate your major after your first year at school.  If you are doing shitty and want to switch, it won't really affect your major too much because the first year or so is pretty much the same for almost every field of study."

What I would recommend would be to study in your local library, so that there's no negative presence and so that its clear to her that you are actively taking steps to work on your maths.  Bring the issue up with her, ask her for a probation period where she won't discourage you, and then work your ass off, prove her wrong, and she'll get off your case."

I'm currently having to pay ~$2,500 out of my pocket for the two summer courses I need to get from a 2.84 to a 3.00.   It's very difficult to get good grades in engineering if you're half-assing everything. I wish I would have studied better my first semester instead of skimming through the notes. It helps to surround yourself with hard-working students so I'd recommend joining an engineering club to make friends and get to know older students who have already gone through the classes you're taking.

That's college algebra>trigonometry>precalc> calc series in order to catch up. Along the way my brother would call or meet with me once every week or two and spend around 2 hours explaining that i couldnt do it. He was wrong. With well placed focus, your mom can also be wrong.

Please don't bring it up again because it really hurts. I'm doing my best this year, and if I fail pre-calc, then we'll talk about doing something else.""  If she continues to press you on it, or brings it up again later, WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE. Don't give her the benefit of the argument. Go somewhere, anywhere, and don't come back for a few hours. The library? The park? Your buddy's house? Somewhere.  If you come back, she better be worried about you. Tell her your feelings. Say ""I'm doing my best Mom. I need you to support me, because math is hard enough."" This should be her wake-up call.  If she isn't worried about you, then you've got a problem man, and I wish you the best. You're gonna have to ignore her, and I hope you have good friends. Work your damndest to save money and get an apartment. Some people have to ditch their families when they drag you down.

If you must choose, securing your mental and social health is worth delaying schooling.    You may not need to delay school, especially if you start now.  Project number one: get clinical counselling.  You school may help, you may need to take a job, you may need to take advantage of social services.  But do it.

Also don't be afraid to cross state lines to take the test where the rules work more to your favor. I live and work in PA, took the FE in New Hampshire and took the the PE in Virginia for a similar reason. At my old job I worked with a guy who flew to California to take the PE 2 years sooner than he could have in PA. Technically the PE credential only applies if you are registered in the state that the project is in; it doesn't matter where you live and work. Since so many people are registered in their own state but do work out of state and still call themselves PEs, being registered out of state is less of a hindrance than one might think.

You said you'll be taking Calc II, so I'm going to be honest... if you got a B+ in Calc I then you may find Calc II to be even more challenging. Not sure how you are with your trig and physics, so the best advice you can take is to attend lecture and do your homework as it is assigned (don't miss any of them, and if you have questions, know what questions you have so the next class period you can ask). Utilize outside resources if you find that you are having a hard time understanding material (for me I used The Giant Book of Calculus Problems and watching PatrickJMT on Youtube) and if you can get your hands on a solution manual for any of your textbooks, then do it. I pay for a yearly subscription to Chegg.com, which has many many many solution manuals available, and it was a huge help for me. It's not that I just want the answers to problems, but I want to see how problems were solved, and unfortunately some of my past classes were not good about being clear with that.  Get adequate sleep, try to avoid all nighters, and since you're a student who works while having a full course load, you need to REALLY commit yourself to using your free time (in between classes, during lunch breaks at work, when you get home from work, etc.) to study or do homework. As tempting as a Netflix binge can seem after a long week of work and classes, try to avoid that. Use it as motivation instead...

I would think your prof was looking for how the Youngs and shear modulus effect the behaviour of the material being stressing not some weird electrical resistance question. Lower modulus the more it will strain for a given stress. So it will be less ""resistant"". The smaller the strain per stress the less the material will deform.   Edit. To sum up I think you tricked yourself into thinking a simple question was a trick."

EngineeringStudents,3bbx6z,kobullso,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:46:00 2015 UTC,No because the two are only the slope of the linear elastic portions of the stress strain curve. As soon as you get out of the linear portion the moduli don't make sense any more. They would still deform the linear amount until you got to the yielding point though.
EngineeringStudents,3bbx6z,seaslugs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:46:39 2015 UTC,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending_stiffness  Bending stiffness does depend on the modulus
EngineeringStudents,3bbx6z,kobullso,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:28:19 2015 UTC,The question is does that only hold true for the linear elastic region of deformation or does it include plastic yielding? I would think it is only for the linear region since your modulus would change as you started strain hardening.
EngineeringStudents,3bbx6z,seaslugs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:12:59 2015 UTC,Yes this would only hold true for small deflections. This is a strangely worded question so it is not entirely clear what is being asked.

EngineeringStudents,3bbx6z,meagerbeaker,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:49:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second this. Metals conduct well, but can have a huge range of moduli, likewise, polymers don't conduct at all and can also have a huge range of moduli.   I'll generalize here, so don't quote this on an exam,  but resistance and conductance is generally based on bond types and orbitals/energy states available for electron-hole pairs. Your mechanical moduli are based on crystal structure and specific bond strengths of atoms in a unit cell.   Feel free to correct on any of the technical bits, but this is how I think of it off the cuff."

Honestly, it doesn't sound like you know much about what you are considering. Have you had an internship?   Even if you don't care about the hardware aspect of computers, you can still specialize in software development as a computer engineer. It's low-level software, of course, but it's a widely chosen option. Even if you want to do high level software, that just requires a little bit of initiative on your part in learning those skills and getting appropriate internships. My first internship as a CPE was a .NET and Android developer. I worked with more computer engineers than computer scientists. It's not an issue, really. But if you are SURE you want to do high level development, then switch. This is honestly the only thing you should consider. Because...   I want some interaction with my coworkers, I want that environment of working at a corporation. You know, casual Fridays, dirty jokes by the water cooler   What? Can you explain what you mean by this? Do you think computer engineers don't do this? Do you think computer scientists are more social (lol)?   I'm not sure on how computer science is perceived to employers in the real world compared to computer engineering   It's perceived effectively the same way. Computer science will be ""preferred"" for high level development, computer engineering will be ""preferred"" for low level development, but you can easily do either as either degree, and that's about it.   computer science is in the college of engineering where I am, so it's not really a huge change, but how much am I affected by castrating the ""engineering"" part of my degree   Zero   I want to eventually end up on the business end of a corporation.

EngineeringStudents,3b8oza,rockincellist,14,Fri Jun 26 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"Take GOOD notes and keep them.  Keep textbooks.  Be on good terms with professors AND STAFF, and try to volunteer to help them with things if you can; even if it's just helping move a desk or something.  Professors determine if you pass, and can influence your getting into graduate school.  Staff help the school to function, and if the IT guy hates you, do you think he is gonna fix your computer or install that software you need in a timely manner for you?  When it comes to the thesis, it's almost more important to have a good working relationship with your adviser and committee than to absolutely love your project.  Both are important, but even if you love your work, if you don't get along with your adviser you won't talk to them when you need them, and then Bad Things happen."

If you're dead set on it, I want to give some words of warning from my experience and the experience of many of my colleagues...  Don't just join a group based on reputation of the research leads. The more clout the professor has, its likely that the more of an egotistical asshole he is. He'll take complete advantage of you in any way he can (and often in ways he isn't allowed to do but the school won't stop him because he brings in grant money and the school couldn't give two fucks about you). If you have a shit advisor you're going to have a shit time.   Talk to grad students of the lab you're looking to apply to. Ask them for some real scoops on what it's like working with the professor. if they give you bad news, DONT think that you're special and your experience will be different, it won't be and you'll hate it.   I see you're at UA. I did my BS and MS at Arizona and loved it. I should have stayed instead of 'upgrading' schools for the PhD -- biggest regret of my career."

I should have stayed instead of 'upgrading' schools for the PhD -- biggest regret of my career.   Really? From whom I've talked to, everyone says to get your MS and PhD at a school other than where you got your BS. Why do you regret ""upgrading""?"
EngineeringStudents,3b8oza,idiot_wind,7,Sat Jun 27 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"that is the exact reason i switched. Everyone told me if i wanted to go into academia that one school for the entire process is bad.   I was a little more than a year away from a PhD at Arizona (had a long Masters that would have completely transitioned into a decent PhD). That was 5 years ago. Now I have absolutely no desire to stay in the bullshit world of research-based universities. So the PhD from Arizona would have been completely satisfactory to get into where I want to go now.  The school I went to is top 10 in the US but it keeps that ranking by having professors like mine who know more about politics and grant-getting than doing science anymore (somehow I feel like not mentioning the school's name since I'm doing so much shit-talking and since I'm so close to getting out of here and don't want to jeopardize anything...). I've seen great lecturers get fired because they weren't bringing in enough research grants -- from which the school takes 50% off the top. So the shittiest lecturers get tenure just because they're bringing the school money.  So the whole institution fosters this air of politics, back-stabbing of research credit, and frankly bad science that gets spun as groundbreaking. I have seen more friends here pressured into faking data than ever happened at Arizona (which was zero times). The stakes are higher at a school like this so ethics often get left on the road side.  The thing is, for how romantic my view of grad school was (and it really was nice doing grad school at Arizona), I'm disgusted at the whole world of academic research. The system is a sham to get cheap labor out of grad students by dangling this carrot of PhD and academia.   The thing about not staying at the same school for your degrees is bullshit. If you do really good work, it doesn't matter where you do it. People will recognize it and you will be rewarded for it. If you like it at Arizona and can get into a good lab that's actually doing work, don't listen to a single person telling you you ought to leave just because that's the way it is. While by the same token, having a school's name on your CV can open more doors if you're only a mediocre or above-average researcher (which you have to honestly judge for yourself, we're not all Einsteins and don't need to be)."
EngineeringStudents,3b8oza,rockincellist,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:55:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I'll be sure to keep what you've said in mind when I consider grad school!
EngineeringStudents,3b8oza,MakeCoolThings,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:28:36 2015 UTC,Two questions for you. What exactly constitutes a good advisor vs a bad one? And how do you find a good advisor especially if you're looking at a school other than where you got your BS?
EngineeringStudents,3b8oza,idiot_wind,2,Sat Jun 27 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"The first question is hard to answer with any concrete thing because good advising can take many forms. But the outcome is that you are a better researcher because the advisor uses his/her years of experience and expertise to prod you into directions where you make your own discoveries and don't get mired down on the wrong path. They can look at your data/results/whatever and provide some insight that you might not have on your own. But almost more importantly, practically speaking, they know you have your own goals in your career and help you on your way to them -- instead of wringing you like a dish rag to get every drop of publication out of you.  A bad advisor does none of these things and that can be done in an infinite number of ways.   For the second question -- the only way you can really figure it out is by speaking with past graduates or current students of the lab. I don't know of any way you can find out the information without trying to get direct contact and an inside scoop from those grad students.   Sorry, this response is probably not helpful in the least."
EngineeringStudents,3b8oza,Pizzadude,4,Mon Jun 29 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"Ignore that guy.  You'll be able to make plenty of money either way, and grad school is the path to pushing the state of the art."

EngineeringStudents,3b8oza,WalkinGhost,3,Sat Jun 27 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"I can try, but it's gonna be more than three sentences...  So, magnetorheological (MR) fluid is notable for the effect that a magnetic field has on it - the strength of the field affects the yield strength of the fluid.  The use of an electromagnet results in an increase of current (to the magnet) increasing the yield strength of the fluid.  By placing this setup in a damper (shock absorber) you now have a damper that has easily (and extremely rapidly) adjustable properties (notably, transmissibility, or the ratio of input to output; force and displacement are our concerns).  My research looked at the effects of various factors (excitation frequency and amplitude, payload, and current level to the damper) on the damper's vibration mitigation properties.  I also looked at the effects of changing the current level on the damper's characteristics (stiffness and damping constant), and how those changing properties affected vibration mitigation.  My experimentation focused on the use of a shaker table, which limited the displacement of the damper to very small amounts, on the magnitude of millimeters.  Hence, vibration mitigation, not impact mitigation.  My results found some trends and some notable things here and there, but primarily it showcased the need for further research.  I did not collect all my data in a manner that would allow for easy analysis, and so I could not make too many conclusions.  But I can confidently state changes that could be made to support a true statistical analysis of similar data.  It just happens that the collection of said data will have to be done by someone else.  looking back through what I wrote, I did a poor job of layman's terms...  Hopefully you will be able to follow along none the less, and if not, a dictionary and wikipedia will get you there (and it's good practice)."

Yeah, spending a couple hundred on summer courses isn't great, but it beats losing $9K."
EngineeringStudents,3b6g6g,SinceBecausePickles,8,Fri Jun 26 14:24:19 2015 UTC,"Lmao this is my exact story. First semester needed with a 2.11, second semester ended with a 3.6, left me with a 3.2 when I needed a 3.25. I appealed and got it granted. Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3b6g6g,Oxidation_State,15,Fri Jun 26 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"Do you think you have extenuating circumstances due to the fact that you've had to consistently overload on courses? I know a few guys in AFROTC and almost all of them will overload at least once.  I wouldn't try and make it a technicality thing, I'm not sure how that will work out. Whoever makes this decisions needs to know that if you don't get this scholarship, it will be difficult for you to attend at all. Being in ROTC, they've probably poured a lot of resources into you and it would be a waste if you couldn't finish.  It looks like you maintained a 3.04 average after your first two years (4x + 2.1+ 3.5 = 2.96 --> x=3.04) which is just above the cutoff. You have to convince your school that you're making a change, and getting a 3.5 during one of your hardest semesters could be a good start to that argument.  edit: /u/AuroraFinem corrected me."
EngineeringStudents,3b6g6g,AuroraFinem,8,Fri Jun 26 12:21:58 2015 UTC,The 3.04 only applies if he took the same number of credits each semester. If he took a more/less credits then his previous GPA would be different. Cumulative GPA is determined per credit just kind semester GPA is.

EngineeringStudents,3b6g6g,onaclaireday,2,Fri Jun 26 14:52:37 2015 UTC,Call financial aid and ask them what you should do. Tell your story. Perhaps they have discretionary funds. I also like the idea about taking the incomplete. Keep working on every option. Maybe they have an online class you can take. Before you take a class at another school make sure the grade will be figured into you GPA. Make sure your GPA is correct. Do everything and find an ally in financial aid. A person with college age kids would probably understand best.
EngineeringStudents,3b6g6g,mshermansw1,2,Fri Jun 26 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned summer classes, and that's a great option, especially if your school does grade forgiveness. I'd make sure and talk to your cadre about it too, they might not be able to get you money, but they can probably get further talking to the school on your behalf. Last but not least, look at living of campus.  Housing and food at my school runs about $5k per year, and living in an apartment with another cadet and coming for myself only costs around $3k. I wouldn't worry about the loan is that's your only option.  You have guaranteed income within a year of your commissioning, that debt will stuck, but it's doable, especially if you consolidate it using your USAA career starter loan (<2% apr)."
EngineeringStudents,3b6g6g,shifted1119,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:40:17 2015 UTC,Maybe try talking with professors or your adviser and see if you can retroactively get an Incomplete in one of your courses.

One unusual trick that I have learned is called ""parking on a downhill slope"".  Essentially the idea is to always leave the end of your day in the middle of a task, it is much easier the next day to finish what you are working on as a warm up and then move onto something else than to start cold with a fresh task.  That being said I don't recommend it for over the weekend only during the week."
EngineeringStudents,3b6qq3,deerhurst,25,Fri Jun 26 13:04:37 2015 UTC,I feel that is a personal thing. I absolutely hate leaving work with things half done.

Just started on a welding line, and am currently being trained for various tasks. I'm normally like you - wanting to have everything completed - but I hate having to go to my boss first thing in the morning and ask what I should be working on.

We work with Fanuc robots. Super guy. Knows more than Ill probably ever know. He loves to teach but only makes and effort if his student are interested. I have learned from him to never stop asking questions. Never stop learning. This guy reads technical manuals for fun!   Documentation for when some dip shit tries to throw you under the bus. Make good friends at work. They can be powerful allies if needed. Ive had this happen with people trying to throw me under the bus. My lead stepped in and annihilated any thought I had done something wrong.   Work hard. Dont be afraid to take on things you are unsure you can do, especially with a good mentor. On my free time at work I was doing dew point calculations and thermo to find how long it would take to condensate on a piece of machinery. My writeup on it made it to the main engineers of the plant. Didnt plan on that happening! I work in an automotive paint plant. Dew dripping into fresh paint is not good."

EngineeringStudents,3b6qq3,Oxidation_State,3,Fri Jun 26 21:21:33 2015 UTC,"I chalk it up to jealousy as well. I don't have much experience around tools, like I literally walked in knowing absolutely nothing. They don't like the idea that I will eventually make way more than me and they see me as undeserving.  They have no lives outside of this job so every little thing gets them so worked up. They constantly shit talk me to look better to my boss by comparison (their boss as well). They blame shit on me that isn't true. They give me jobs, don't prepare me with enough information to complete said job, and then get pissed when I don't do it correctly. Then when I take too long to do something because I've never done it before they get pissed at me for going too slow and rush me. And rushing me ruins the quality of my work and makes it awful.   My first semester, I designed a new system to replace the motor on a conveyor drive, and the mechanics convinced me that I was doing it all wrong and complained to my boss about it, telling me that I turned the gearbox upside down and the whole project was fucked. I find out my second semester back that they just flipped it over because, little known fact, gearboxes have exactly aligned threaded holes on both fucking sides! The took the project from me and allowed me to think I fucked everything up fr half a year.  It's completely shot my confidence and I get incredibly anxious thinking about my boss screaming at me and it ruins my performance. It makes me not think I'm cut out to be a mechanical engineer, and makes me want to not come back for my third semester. But I need the money.   They also constantly ask me to do work like a technician and I get frustrated getting judged for work in something I'm not supposed to do and won't be doing as an engineer. I'm really good at CAD when they give me the chance to do things.   Then there's absolutely nothing to do which is just demeaning, sitting with nothing to do all day. Then they have the nerve to mock me for doing nothing, as if I wouldn't prefer having work. It has gotten better lately. They have me hanging conduit in the factory, which is unairconditioned and hot as hell, but I'm doing a good job although they're still complaining I go too slow, even though it seems like they deliberately slow me down with bullshit just so they can have something to shit talk me about to pass the time.   I do think my performance on this last job is improving my reputation though. And I feel good at work for once, I just hate having nothing to do and it depresses me and puts me in a horrible mood. I legitimately wanted to kill myself one day at work, and it was my birthday. I just sat at my desk all day, periodically asking me boss for work to do."

There are only about 3 occasions where I've ever had to address my poor grades to anyone and that has always been to college advisers. Advisers don't hire you. Also, you can meet with those advisers after you've started cleaning up your act and show them your improvement.   My question is, how hard is it going to be to get accepted to a school given a bad record. I'm going to take a few classes at a new community college when I move and actually give a damn this go-round.   Don't discount that community college as just a place to take a few classes. Find out if the community college has a guaranteed admission program with any state universities. You can pick up an associate's degree on your way to your bachelor's and eliminate the worry of getting accepted anywhere. You'll save yourself some big money that way, too.   Recently I've tried to force myself back into taking classes at a local community college, but have not had the discipline to care. My priorities have been way out of wack.   Get your head straight first. If you aren't ready for it, you're just going to burn out again. That shit will hold you back. Do whatever it takes to get your priorities in check. Delete facebook, call a lawyer, hit the gym... whatever. If you don't have the discipline to care, then it's not just going to magically come to you by moving to another town.  I did exactly what you're doing. I did it quite a few times, but when I was 32, it finally stuck. I've had a great life thus far, but I honestly believe that getting my shit together for an engineering degree was the single best thing I've ever done for myself.

There might be the occasional one, there may be evene a whole program (for a steep tuition) - but everything is generally taught in german.  edit: I just noticed someone apparently went on a downvote rampage in that thread.

But there's a reason you enrolled for engineering. If it was just money, you could've gone pre-med, or anything else that makes decent money. My guess is you have an idea of interest, but aren't sure where you feel inspired.  Take the time to look at other field than automotive: you may find something that looks more fulfilling to you.  My other suggestion is to look into personal development. This is not meant as an insult - I know absolutely nothing about you - but stating that you consider yourself just average tells me enough about you to make a couple recommendations.  Purchase and read these books: How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, and The New Psycho-cybernetics by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.

I really wanna do good for the earth or even just build some cool fucking structures that people look at and admire, and with CE I feel like that might be possible, but I'm so scared it's gonna be an office job, 9-5.   I don't wanna be sitting around all day. I wanna use my skills to invent things. I want to be outside.   Edit: I'm a receptionist at a rehab center for a major network in Florida and I freaken love my job. It's super interesting to see all aspects of the business and I've strongly considered going into the field of management because I work with people that do this stuff and it seems so awesome.   I need something like that for engineering. I need to see people's lives being changed. It's so hard to do all this intense coursework without seeing an end goal."
EngineeringStudents,3b5nk3,SoleSoulSeoul,3,Fri Jun 26 06:29:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, based on what you just said there, I would highly recommend Industrial Engineering.   From what I've been told by I.E. students at my school, IE's tend to be more ""management"" oriented. I'm an M.E. student, though, so take that with a grain of salt. My best advice would be to meet/correspond with a couple different advisers and departments at the school(s) you want to attend (IE would probably be at the top of my of recommendations).  Seriously, I can't stress enough to meet with adviser(s).  Edit: check the link. Bot doesn't show the management areas that concern an IE"
EngineeringStudents,3b5nk3,SoleSoulSeoul,5,Fri Jun 26 07:13:14 2015 UTC,"Lots of people major in Engineering because they see those big starting salaries on glassdoor and whatnot, but the truth is, the people making those starting salaries are really passionate about their fields, went out of their way to do projects during school, and are truly innovative in their work. They are engineers in the most literal sense of the term, right behind those guys with the cool hats in trains.  If you're fueled by monetary desire, maybe look into the field of finance. Many of the skills of engineering tends to cross-over and it's definitely more salary oriented.   I'm in a similar situation to you, I grew up incredibly poor due to my mother having some serious medical conditions which left us in six-figure debt, but I grew up around science and friends who are already done with engineering school. They tell me about their $15/hr internships and even that alone sounds like a dream income compared to what I'm used to, but then they tell me about their 60, 70, even 90k job offers during their senior year and that gives me quite the boner. But I just happened to be lucky enough to have a passion in a lucrative field.   Honestly, try to find your passion, or you'll wake up every morning and wanna put a hole in your head regardless of the bucks you bring in, and if you go to an engineering job depressed, you won't get anything done and you'll likely get canned. Hope this helped somewhat, good luck"

A friend of mine's Uncle leads a Software dev team and he had me watch how he lead his office for a couple of weeks.  The best advice I can give you personally (and I'm sure there's some threads purely about getting internships), is to just find some local or semi-local companies and shoot them an eMail asking about internships.  I would be sure to include that you don't mind if it's unpaid because you'll likely get more responses that way. You don't need any degree to get into the field, just try to make some connections while you're still early in your studies."

The downside is that he's never home, so I haven't been able to confront him and ask for some internships (because I'm sure he can hook me up). I'll ask my friend to just ask for me, I just feel like that's highly unprofessional.   On the other hand, I've honestly tried to reach out to companies but I've gotten no responses thus far, and I really don't want to annoy anyone.

EngineeringStudents,3b5nk3,mnk88,7,Fri Jun 26 06:33:30 2015 UTC,"You will likely quit engineering school. And if you don't, you will suck at being an engineer, because money is your only goal, and you won't be satisfied with any salary you make. Engineering is not for you. It has nothing to do with liking math, you need to ""want"" to be an engineer. Most engineers don't make nearly as much as you think they do, and I can honestly say having a job you love is more important than a high salary.  Now that we've got that out the way, try finding a particular industry you are interested in, and see what engineers do in that industry. For example, if you like automobiles, it's pretty evident what MEs and EEs do, but dive in and check blog posts, job postings, etc, and see if it's something you'd like to do. Same for any other industry, and any other major."
EngineeringStudents,3b5nk3,mnk88,2,Fri Jun 26 04:26:09 2015 UTC,"My original post didn't really explain this but I do like the idea behind engineering. Designing things really freaken interests me. I'm just not sure if CE would really interest me. I should do some interns but I don't even think I could get any yet? Unless I can get lucky. I don't know. I need to see what they do. But that seems near impossible.  Still doesn't change the fact that I'm average at everything and nothing truly interests me. Again, designing large structures sounds cool, but is it? I have no fucking idea."

Completely ignore the fact we're talking about engineering.   You should consider what you really want to do with the rest of your life.   Don't pick a job for the money, power, etc, pick it because its what you want to do with your life.   I chose AAE, mostly likely gonna go for a masters in Astronautical, because I love space.  I've been obsessed with space ever since I was a little kid, watching every shuttle and satellite launch, owning a bunch of telescopes, etc.  I want nothing more with my life than to help humanity push farther into space.

EngineeringStudents,3b4d00,promarkman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"I would take one or two extra EE classes, and then look at other options. Are there any PE/other fun or interesting classes that you could take to pad your schedule? I did a lot a those sorts of classes, tried University Chorus, took a welding class, etc. A minor is a good idea if there is something else your interested in (or once again, just a couple classes to learn the basics). I would spread out the workload out fairly evenly since you have that option, and get up to full time status with fluff classes."
EngineeringStudents,3b4d00,Spdreader,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:25:48 2015 UTC,"Im in a similar boat, take the full load. Nothing builds character and chest hair like getting smacked around by 5 engineering classes."
EngineeringStudents,3b4d00,D________D,0,Fri Jun 26 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"I would go with option two plus some ""extra"" classes to make a full load. In my undergrad there was a 1 credit oil painting class, that had no homework. Or you take a language (hint: Chinese)"

EngineeringStudents,3b51uz,kingman123,17,Fri Jun 26 01:01:28 2015 UTC,"Getting an internship is a big deal, you may think you're wasting your time there or it is too stressful. However, please believe me when I say it though having an internship can be more important than just about any other resume point (even GPA or grad date). Quitting anything in a professional environment is ill advised as well. I would NOT put it on your resume (if you quit), that's just asking for some gnarly questions in an interview.  I would try to talk to your professors before you quit and see if they can help you out, just explain the 'sitch and your reasonings, you might be surprised at their answers.  Take any advice in context, these are based on my experience getting a job, and the experiences of my friends who've recently graduated who don't have jobs because they never had an internship...just don't take it for granted.  Wish ya luck amigo, whatever your path."
EngineeringStudents,3b51uz,clingaa,2,Fri Jun 26 01:35:44 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the answer man. I've given this subject a lot of thought. The thing is this internship isn't really set in a professional environment. It is an ""Robotics internship"" with a community college. We learn some Java, but almost 4 weeks of it is working at a summer camp for elementary school kids."
EngineeringStudents,3b51uz,Darkknight512,3,Fri Jun 26 01:59:18 2015 UTC,I spent a year planning and executing a summer camp for kids at my university. I learned a heck of a lot there. Currently far away from home at a great internship. There is plenty to learn at any job.

EngineeringStudents,3b51uz,okiedokieartichoke,2,Fri Jun 26 02:38:20 2015 UTC,"Until the interviewer calls them to confirm, and they tell him that OP left in the middle of summer to go back to school. That's like what, 6 weeks of work and then you disappear? Not very professional."
EngineeringStudents,3b51uz,burdlinsky,2,Fri Jun 26 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"Typically, companies do not give references to people who just cold call them. Good HR practice is to verify dates of service/eligibility for rehiring. I had plenty of job interviews and it wasn't until I accepted an offer was my background checked. Many companies outsource the background check. This costs money. I think it's atypical to investigate until an offer has been made. Just one man's experience. Good luck either way."

EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,dan84827,45,Thu Jun 25 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people recommend writing down your assignments somewhere. No need for paper - use a task app on your phone. There are some which sync with Google Tasks too - absolutely indispensable in my opinion to be organized with what you have to get done.  Other tips: I'm not a morning person but I've gotten in the habit of waking up ~15 min. earlier than I have to. During that time I do small things on my phone - check the news, listen to music. The music especially helps me wake up and be alert. So much better than dragging yourself to class half-dead.  Caffeine is a tool, not a crutch. When you absolutely need to pull that all-nighter, use it (but promise not to pull an all-nighter next time). When you're feeling sluggish halfway through the day, go for it. But try not to use it everyday. If you try not to build tolerance, coffee will work better for you when you need it.  Naps: if you're going to nap, try to nap while sitting up, without blankets, with an alarm set for 15 or so min. If you nap for too long (you'll have to test your limits), you'll nap for an hour and a half. Which isn't necessarily bad - it's super rejuvenating, but not always what you intended.  Time your naps so they occur before you have to be somewhere. Let's say you have a class at 5 - napping from 4:30-4:45 is great, it'll leave you refreshed and ready to go. Personally, I find it dangerous to nap when I don't have to go anywhere afterwards - then I'm too tempted to just sleep or laze around afterwards.  Best tip: Enjoy what you're doing. I always ask myself whether I would rather be doing anything else, and the answer is no. The best way to avoid becoming a zombie is to actually have motivation in the first place. Invest yourself in your subjects and it'll pay off.  When reading, read actively. I often find myself snoozing if I just try to read a textbook after a long day. Scribbling down equations on a piece of paper as I read actually helps keep me awake and focused.  Productivity: do not waste time on social media. Either be social or be productive, social media doesn't accomplish either. Don't take a 15 minute break on Facebook or Buzzfeed or YouTube or Reddit - just don't. If you want to take a break, wash your face, walk around a bit, talk to someone (give your mom a call?), find a snack, or do some idle tasks (for example, staple your papers, organize your binder).  Let's say you've just gone through a rough day and you've been working for the past 6 hours. It's time for bed, but you're feeling restless and you want to browse the Internet as a reward for your hard work (or as ""stress relief""). Try not to - you may think you don't want to sleep now, but you'll regret it in the morning. When you crawl into bed, you won't be bored long, I promise you - you won't notice any boredom/stress when you're asleep.  Avoiding social media and sites like Buzzfeed isn't just about avoiding the waste of time - it's also because those sites are great for killing your motivation. You can be in an amazingly productive mood, go on Reddit, browse for 5 minutes, and suddenly lose your mindset. I've had times where for 3 weeks straight I'd be super productive and have a healthy schedule (proper sleep, eat, exercise), and then one day of browsing the Internet makes the next week a complete struggle. Don't break the spell - if you're being productive, don't ruin it."

Every day, I put in eight hours of class and schoolwork .  If I don't have a bunch of stuff due tomorrow, I will work ahead on homework or study for an upcoming test.    That's all it takes to be successful, I've found.  No all-nighters, no unnecessary stress, or zombie feelings.  Get in the habit of sleeping the same hours every night.

My sister in law is going to college full time and her schedule is like 8 am to noon a couple days, and 10am to noon the other days. This is relieving though, because I'm about to get out of the military and become a full time student, so an 8 hour work day will be awesome."
EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,crew_dog,26,Thu Jun 25 11:32:46 2015 UTC,"The transition isn't the worst thing possible, but remember that those 8 hours of work are going to very different to what you've done in the military.

EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,SecretNewMeta,5,Fri Jun 26 13:50:25 2015 UTC,All nighters come when something breaks and it's beyond your control.  My all nighters were due to a formatting war with an 8:30 am deadline or ArcGIS crashing and taking 5 hours of work with it (and it somehow got the backups).

I've been on the schedule you mentioned for the past two years and have yet to get a B. The first two years of college I didn't organize as well, but once you give 8hrs a day, 5 days a week (and 3-5hrs a day on the weekend, in my case), you will never again struggle with due dates, studying for tests, getting projects completed on time... If you have nothing due in the immediate future, just get started studying for the next test, the next project, etc. 8hrs a day and you will succeed in engineering-- it's really not that hard."
EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,swingtheory,3,Thu Jun 25 15:07:52 2015 UTC,8hrs/day outside of class or class time included?
EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,Alpha_Ape,5,Thu Jun 25 15:22:25 2015 UTC,"For me it was class included. On average 2.5 - 3hrs in class, 5 - 5.5 hrs studying/doing homework. As the semester comes to a close I might bump it up to 9 hrs a few of the days during the week, but no more. That way I always had 5 or 6 hours every week night to myself (or with friends), not thinking about school."

I said all this assuming a full time student, 5 classes a semester. The truth is that school takes at least 40 hours a week to do moderately well in an engineering major. Anything less and it'd be a very stressful semester."

Take my Monday and Wednesdays... my day starts with a 7-8 am class, and I go to open at work with a 9am-3pm shift, and then I have a one hour break until I need to leave at 4pm to get to my 5pm-9pm class (because rush hour traffic is a pain). By the time I get home, it's 9:30 pm, and I have a choice between going to sleep and not doing my homework, or doing my homework and getting little to no sleep.  My Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are no better. And yes, I unfortunately have to work on weekends, as well. A Saturday shift could either have me leaving my home at 9am and working until 7pm, or leaving my home at 11am and working until 9 pm.  Not everyone is fortunate enough to have as many hours during the day to devote to homework/studying. I'm truly envious of students who are able to do that, and wonder if they realize how fortunate they are."

I did homework by myself freshman through junior year and always understood the material because I figured everything out myself.  Senior year I lived with someone who took the same classes as me, so we ended up doing homework together. He was generally much faster than I was, so 80% of the time he would figure it out first. I struggled the most that year because I just never mastered the material on my own.    There's nothing wrong with consulting others though. Just save it for checking your work for accuracy or for when you occasionally get completely stumped by a problem."

Not just your classes but your extracurricular stuff and from this start placing time slots where you can do your tutorials/project work. I say can because it allows you to move stuff around drop stuff for a week or so. Just be highly organised especially if you have a lot of stuff to.   Get a whiteboard, or if you can that magic whiteboard stuff (a sheet of plastic that uses static energy to stick to walls) if you can get magic ones they're a god send! Place them around your room. Eat. Might sound silly but I got through my third year eating more or less 1 meal a day and lived off caffeine due to spending so much time doing uni stuff plus working 20-30 hours over the weekend. Keep a logbook. Kinda like a diary but without your feelings. Just short notes on specific things like when you had meetings or a list of stuff to do."
EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,WeAreInfinitesimal,3,Thu Jun 25 11:43:05 2015 UTC,Wake up early!  This helps me so much.  Ive started getting up at 5:30 or 6:00 every morning and I feel less rushed in the mornings and my days go better.  Exercise!  So important for me.  As I approach my senior year I'm seeing so many of my friends get flabby/fat from sitting on their asses all day.  Eat!  I bring food everyday.  We have a big fridge in the engineering lounge I use.  I'm definitely guilty of abusing caffeine.  I scale back though to a cup or two a day when I'm not busy.  I also occasionaly use a nootropic called phenylpiracetam for those really long days.

EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,BeastmasterDar,3,Thu Jun 25 22:31:59 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's all about food, sleep, exercise, and following your curiosities.   Eat three square meals a day that you either cook or warm up from leftovers. Which you hopefully also cooked. Basically, if you stick to foods that you cook yourself and eat some fruit and vegetables, you will be fine as far as nutrition is concerned. I also have between 16 and 24 oz of black coffee every morning.   Now for sleeping. As of late, I haven't been very good at this one because of a really bad round of summer classes last session. Make sure you are getting between 8 and 10 hours of sleep every night. My first semester, I was sleeping 9 hours every night and it was my most successful semester. How you manage getting that much sleep every night is your business.  Take yourself for a little run, ride your bike, do some bodyweight exercises, something like that, every day. It doesn't have to be for a really long time if you just don't have the time for it, but you should do something. This will help you be awake and energized all the time.  Okay, the last one is out of the ordinary. I make it part of my routine to work odd little problems on paper. For instance, I had a little project my first semester where I had to design something in Solidworks. I chose to design a camping stove made from two soda cans. The next semester, I was in chemistry and looked at combustion reactions and vapor pressures for the first time since my sophomore year of high school, and applied some of that knowledge to this little stove. Now I knew how much heat the stove could produce for some mass of ethanol fuel burned and what the pressure was inside the vessel. Fast forward another semester, and I'm taking thermo I, so I make some assumptions and figure out how fast the fuel/air mixture will escape the stove as a gas. I'm taking thermo II next semester, I'm sure I will learn more and apply some knowledge yet again.   I guess you could call curiosities like that ""research"". It doesn't really feel like work, at least for me, and I enjoy doing it. I often find myself sitting in class with some wonder about how such and such concept could be applied, write it down, and take a look at it later. That's how you become a good engineer."

There's any number of great engineers with amazing minds that are horribly out of shape.  You're an adult now, time to start taking care of yourself.  Spend the damn 30 bucks on a gym membership and work up to getting there 3 or 4 days a week.  If you have weight problems already get on a calorie tracker and start watching what you eat (energy in and energy out, that whole thermodynamics thing rears its head again).  Unless you stay in academia or start your own company, naps aren't going to happen.  Try to get your adult life going now, so you're not picking up good habits your first week on the job but have them already.  Get used to SLEEPING RIGHT.  I stress this to every student.  Nothing will impact your adult life more than not getting enough sleep.  Get to bed on time!

EngineeringStudents,3b1hok,rainydayadventure,2,Thu Jun 25 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"If I was a fulltime student I would:  • whenever possible, schedule classes at your own ""good"" time. If you don't function well at 8am, try classes at 9 or 10 instead. It's still early enough that it doesn't monopolize your day, but you'll actually be awake enough to, like, go.   • get up early enough to make coffee, tea, choc milk, whatever floats your boat, sit up for a bit and read over stuff, etc. It only means losing 15 or so minutes of sleep but it makes you so much more prepared for the day. There will always be days where 15 minutes of sleep is too precious to lose but usually it's worth it.   • bullet journal. It's the only type of ""planner"" I've ever been able to stick to & it combines to-do lists with a planner.   • don't go home to do homework. I don't get anything done at home. Stay at school or go to a public library. When possible, use their computers so you don't have your ""fun stuff"" open on yours.   • I definitely nap whenever possible, but when I wasn't so busy I didn't. Nap when you need to, not just when you feel like you could. Try a snack and a long drink of water first & if that doesn't work, take a nap.   • have good snacks on you all the time. I'm currently on break in a 3.5 hr calc class and I can't even believe how many people don't eat the whole class time. I hardcore zone out and am so lightheaded when I don't get 3-4 snacks during that time. One chick legit eats a meal halfway through class. I respect that. A lot of people also don't get up and move around on breaks. They're nuts.   • do yoga."

EngineeringStudents,3b4jh1,acidchubonLoL,10,Thu Jun 25 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, probably mechanical. Because mechanical engineering lately focuses on not only moving parts/stresses/etc, but also electromechanical stuff - controls systems, basic circuits, etc."
EngineeringStudents,3b4jh1,ThexRuminator,3,Thu Jun 25 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"Assuming that civil is separated from all the HVAC stuff (and also from marine constructions), I'd say mechanical.  I think there would be more emphasis on fluid dynamics in mechanical. Many mechanical objects need to be aerodynamic (cars, planes, turbines, propellers etc), while buildings are rarely optimised for low air drag. Also maybe a bit more thermodynamics in mechanical? But buildings need to be isolated thermally, so civil has thermodynamics too, I'm sure, but mechanical seems to cover more aspects: thermal machines, like turbines, combustion engines, friction heating etc. Most mechanical engineering programs also involve some electrical engineering classes, so electricity, as an aspect of physics is also a factor here."
EngineeringStudents,3b4jh1,japko,3,Thu Jun 25 22:32:07 2015 UTC,"I am a Civil Engineer and I am friends with some people who graduated mechanical and it's all physics but it's different. I focused on geotechnical and hydrology. Do my physics is about the earth and how it moves and how water moves and the physics behind those. Failure forces, flow rates wall and foundation design. Whereas mechanical is more about moving parts and physics in motion. Or at least that's what I surmised from what they told me. I really enjoy civil, I get out in the field a lot and I get to work on multi million dollar developments and work with a lot of interesting people. Like I said I don't know too much about mechanical but I really like civil. Good luck"

Everything in engineering that deals with physical stuff and quantities will have a deep physics background...think of this sort of engineering as ""applied physics"".  (If you dont like physics then theres probably a good chance you won't like the more involved math courses, like vector calc and laplace and etc, since physics is almost like applied mathematics)"

EngineeringStudents,3b4jh1,NoobMadeInChina,6,Fri Jun 26 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"gotcha.  Sorry for the pessimism, its been a sort-of depressing day for me today.  Be aware you might change your mind later on.  When I was a foolish freshmen coming into EE, my mentality was ""I want to take as much EE courses as I can!"" basically trapping myself in EE because I love EE.  Now 2.5 years in apparently I'm crazy enough to pursue a double with EE and physics.  I realized, with the limited time available, its pointless to take class where you are relatively confident to learn the material on your own later.  Plus trapping yourself in one area is a good way to burn yourself out.  My mentality is now ""I want to take classes where I have absolutely no idea how or where to start on this topic"".    The best classes are those that motivate me to take another class that dives deeper into something I learned in the previous class.  I know its probably not the most direct answer, but its just something to think about.  Good luck"

Are there classes available that your friend will eventually have to take to graduate (e.g. tech electives) that he has already satisfied the prerequisites for that he could take?   If there seriously are no other classes available and the course scheduling is flexible I would recommend trying to get a co-op for the fall semester.

Experience:  What experience?  Experience outside of RF EE?  Thats what it looks like...contractor, IT, and landscaping.  Take it out if you're sending this to a major RF company.  They'll know you're hardworking just by the EE-related items alone.  Maybe put them in a separate section called ""interests"" if you really want to.  Technical: Please avoid full-on sentences.  No need to go full on in every technical detail.  ""Designed and simulated 12V power supply in LTSpice"" yeah and what is that compared to working with RF and holy-hell-expensive VNA's?  Are you a noob or a legitimate RF engineer?  Just say what you're trying to accomplish and what, if any, technical innovation exists in your design.  Create new line after each title.  Put the year of your project on the same line as the title, right justified, just like in the middle ""Experiences"" section above it.  ""w/"" dont use abbreviations.  Make sub bullet points below each project, just like the ""Experiences"" above it.  Skillset: Make each item new line.

So many people presume they'll hate ""real"" chemical engineering as much as they hated that semester.   The other thing is that the my university offers a common first year, when you don't have to decide what major till your second year, unless you do a double degree in science. Every single person I know who got to the end and decided they didn't want to be a chemical engineer did that science double degree, so didn't really have an idea of what they were getting into in the first place.

You can just take a couple CS classes if you have room in your schedule. And there are other things you can do to get experience, like open source projects."

I've worked with a few RPi and I like some of the programs they come with but I usually like writing my own for them just for simplicities sake because I have a specific way I like to write my code.

I haven't got a stationary mount just yet as I'm not that good with CAD or anything of that nature. As well as that, we have a model train/railway set up to try and test it later on. Have had a little play around with open/simple cv, but not a great deal just yet."

We have in cylinder pressure sensors for a research engine that give really good resolution so that we can break down the explosion and look at how it progresses. The goal is to create a MATLAB process that will take the pressure data and output essentially a graph of percent of fuel (really mass fraction) burned against crank angle degrees. My professor has a method of doing it graphically with excel but it's extremely time consuming and not entirely repeatable so it needs refining.   I need to figure out all sources of noise in the data, filter out pressure changes due to piston motion, and then automate a process to convert it all to a measure of how much fuel has burned so far in the combustion process. It's not as cutting edge or design oriented as other topics I looked at but I'm hoping that it will leave me extremely well versed in combustion processes, especially the part where I'm working on filtering out all of the noise in the pressure data."

So far I've done some background reading and took a coursera course on programming in matlab because I'm a total noob at programming. I can post some results eventually but the goal is to basically have an input graph of pressure v crank angle and create an output graph of mass fraction burned v crank angle. I don't think the results would be nearly as interesting as the process. I've got a long way to go before I get there though.

We're not his professor and he doesn't need to beg and grovel for our assistance. Also the italicized bit at the end could be a little ( or a lot) less condescending.  One of the biggest challenges in teaching isn't just asking questions but knowing when students don't know enough to ask, which is why talking to professors can be so intimidating.

EngineeringStudents,3ayky0,lkwai,7,Thu Jun 25 03:26:49 2015 UTC,"I think i've found the FBD okay, as well as the required reaction forces, with the reaction at G being 1.95kN and the reaction at A being 4.35kN.  But when it comes to finding the axial stress I'm completely at a loss as to where even begin. Can you assume that the reaction forces at G and A at the same, in the same direction at E and C respectively? How can you then use that to find the stress?  I also understand that stress is load over area, and that the load is the tension in that part of the beam? Is it as simple as finding the coefficient of the reaction forces that runs down ED assuming what I said above?"
EngineeringStudents,3ayky0,daniefer280,2,Wed Jun 24 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"Commentary on your thoughts  1) How would you assume that the reaction forces are the same, having just calculated Rg to be 1.95 and Ra to be 4.35? (i'm superscripting because i can't subscript. also, those numbers are what I get too.)  2) Those numbers, and an understanding of where/how reaction forces work, would allow you to isolate zero-force members in the structure (there's at least one.), and then for you to calculate resultant loads in all beam sections as a result.  3) You find stress in a beam by taking the load in that beam and dividing by the beam's cross-sectional area - I would not say ""tension"" because that implies a certain direction of force.. (fwiw I am not familiar with the use of coefficients or whatsoever.)   Commentary on the question  I was midway through (2) when I realized.. and maybe this will help you... EDC forms an isosceles triangle, with D being the apex.   addition: after you figure out the implication of EDC being an isosceles, you would find the load carried in ED, and then divide it by the cross-sectional steel area of member ED."
EngineeringStudents,3ayky0,backcountry52,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"1) When i said that they're the same, I meant that the force at G would be the same as the force at E an the force at A would be the same as the force at C  2) I'm surprised there are any zero-force members? How'd you figure that one out?  3) I know about getting stress from the load, it's the load that confuses me!  4) Appreciate the help, thanks  I noticed the iscosceles triangle, how can we use this?

EngineeringStudents,3ayky0,mullerjones,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"1) okay, I see what you mean. nope, it doesn't work that way.  2) If you examine AG, you'll see that it's just a single member oriented in the Y direction. Given a space frame (so taking the assumption of pinjointedconnections), AB can only be loaded in the vertical direction - and given the reaction loads acting, that's not going to happen.  (because i can't explain zero-force members, have a thought exercise. apply a compressive/tensile force in place of AG, and see how the reaction forces at A and G will change. notably, you cannot get the vertical reaction required at A.)  isoceles triangle: you can try the method of sections, or you can also try replacing points E and C with X-Y fixed pin joints (rotation only.)  made a diagram maybe this will help. http://imgur.com/wgU5RbI"
EngineeringStudents,3ayky0,theOpulentCage,2,Wed Jun 24 17:54:56 2015 UTC,Since you are asked for the stress in the ED element you can do a FBD for the two elements connecting at D and ignore the rest. That way you can find quickly what is the axial force on the ED element without having any assumptions about its relation with the reactions at G and A.
EngineeringStudents,3ayky0,hockeychick44,2,Wed Jun 24 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"It's exactly as easy as that. Axial stress for this problem is defined as force per unit area. You'll want to make note that most of the members in the problem (if not all) will be loaded in compression, not tension. It's not a real big deal to remember that, but as you progress through structures you'll want to keep track of those sorts of things."
EngineeringStudents,3ayky0,Darth_drizzt_42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm an engineering student in Brazil so I might make some mistakes on the terminology as I'm only familiar with it in Portuguese.  This is a truss, basically. The main idea behind them is that each bar only suffers compression or traction and you have 2 basic ways of calculating loads on them. Here, we call them the node method and the Ritter's cuts method.  The node method is simple: there mustn't be any resulting force in any node for the system to be balanced, so you can treat each one individually. You make a FBD for each node and the forces involved are only the bars attached to that node. This way you kind of crawl from node to node, calculating every load on every bar until you find the one you want.  The other method is a bit more ingenious, but follows the same principle. The whole system must be balanced, so if you separate it in 2, each half must be individually balanced. What you do then is make a ""cut"" through a few of the bars and then calculate things for each half separately. Like this, you treat that piece as a body on its own, and balance it like you would the whole system. This lets you find out the load in specific bars much more easily depending on your system.  I'm sorry if I wasn't very clear as English isn't my first language, but I can answer any questions you might have."

Here are the six factors considered by the Court:   1.The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment. 2.The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern. 3.The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff. 4.The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded. 5.The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship. 6.The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship"

EngineeringStudents,3azl3q,Darth_drizzt_42,24,Mon Jun 29 13:03:08 2015 UTC,"This screams 'illegal internship'. I believe that unpaid internships (in the US) have extremely strict definitions on what can and cannot be done. For example, what you've described falls under what should be paid. An unpaid internship is a learning experience where your 'work' is supposed to be supervised and pretty regimented. Typically, college credit is received from an unpaid internship. I understand that the experience is probably a great thing, but if you need to put food on the table and pay rent...you have to evaluate this decision. I'm not saying get a job at Starbucks, but keep looking for something that is somewhat related to what you want to do in the engineering field. The other option is to push for some sort of compensation from where you are currently 'working'. State your case and be ready to leave if they don't at least meet you halfway.  How I personally feel about it is that you have a skill that not many others have. You have worked hard to develop your skill (an education that was paid for) and it is insulting to ask someone to work for free when the company is clearly going to gain from it."
EngineeringStudents,3azl3q,hardolaf,11,Wed Jun 24 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about that. I think you're right. According to the Department of Labor, an unpaid internship must be:   similar to training which would be given in an educational environment ... under close supervision of existing staff   and    The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern   If the OP is doing real work that the current staff doesn't know how to do, I can't see how those could possibly be met."
EngineeringStudents,3azl3q,axz055,2,Wed Jun 24 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"I was going to reply and say that unpaid internships typically fall into an assistant type role to a senior company member, and even that tends to stretch the definition. This is definitely over the line for not paying him."

If you want unpaid experience, start a company, a blog, do engineering things. I did this with northstreetlabs.org, I ended up building the world's largest vending machine for Lady Gaga two years later and used it all as experience on my resume."

I was told multiple times during the interview process that it wouldn't be paid, they're a small company, etc. I took it because I thought I was going to be working with people on the cutting edge of this particular tech sector...turns out they're kinda garage style folks minus the steve wozniak if you know what I mean...it's great and works for them, but it's not like what I thought going in, even though they said it was unpaid multiple times and I said it was ok.  I guess the question is am I justified in feeling entitled, and if so, how do I communicate that to boss without negative connotation?  Last thing I want is to come off as ""I'm smarter than you, I thought I was gonna be working with people smarter than me."" But that's almost how I feel, without the negative connotations.  I have a lot of respect for them. And I want to contribute, really bad. I think I could do a lot of great work for them and make them money through that work. But I feel that I deserve to be paid for that effort and I want to communicate that to them in as professional and smooth a way as possible so we can both benefit, ie, I get hourly pay and they get a hard worker.   I'm not disagreeing with you, just trying to get a different perspective. I guess I want to optimize my outcome like any engineer lol and that outcome is like I said above: I work for them and get paid for it. But I understand to some people that attitude might come off as negative or entitled or whatever. I'm certainly getting that reaction from friends and family."

I've found job X, that would mean I have to leave here. I don't want to stop working for you, but I need the money""  Then, if they value your contribution, they'll pay you.

But being able to think about things in terms of a cost/benefit analysis, considering the opportunity costs of decisions, etc. is pretty useful.   A minor is a good opportunity to explore a subject of interest to you in some depth without having to base your career on it. And unless it makes you take longer to graduate, it's basically free."
EngineeringStudents,3b0jrf,axz055,2,Thu Jun 25 03:42:43 2015 UTC,Unrelated majors add depth and make you look more diversified.

So, in summary, it can only help. I suppose there may be the odd employer who may interpret it as you being ""unfocused"", but this line of thinking doesn't seem to be common (from what I've heard)."

If they ask you why you have the unrelated minor don't say like ""Art history is my true passion in life"" because then it implies you're not really into engineering (which you may or may not be, but just don't tip off the recruiters about it).   At worst you could say that it's just a curiosity of yours, or you were looking for some breadth in your courses and that shouldn't affect your chances in any negative way."

Freshman year was gen ed mostly so I was able to get my GPA up.  Sophomore year was very hard for me.  I failed calc 2, got a D in physics II (electricity/magnetism).  Started doubting if engineering was for me.  I am still recovering from that semester going into senior year but I've been fortunate enough to have been interning at a company for two summers away from home.    At least where I go to school, those calc and physics classes are ""weed-out"" classes so they are designed to test your breaking point.  Those two were the only ones I had a hard time with but I got an B+ in calc 2 the second time around and had a great professor.

I learn best when I teach, so working with a group and teaching them (while they call out my mistakes, since I'm verbalizing everything I'm doing) is really effective. Make friends outside your major. All my friends are engineers, which is fine, but I miss outside perspective. Don't hesitate to join extracurriculars.

They're going to look at your GPA and internships, and your GPA is the first thing if you don't have any internships. If you accidentally load up on too many classes or too many outside commitments you will tank your grades or worse, fail out of your program because you didn't plan your semesters responsibly."

EngineeringStudents,3b0rw2,wutnowsucka,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:48:57 2015 UTC,12 credits is fine. You should be fine. I think 12-13 is a great starting point. You can load on more next semester if you feel like it was too easy.
EngineeringStudents,3b0rw2,zebrastripe665,2,Thu Jun 25 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"Go to class Get enough sleep (even at the expense of finishing homework) Get involved in a student organization. Sign up for the emailing list for a bunch of them at the beginning of the year, then pick the one you end up liking the best, you'll have a hard time being committed to more than one at first. Go to class Make friends in your major, you can do homework together, collaborate on study guides, etc. Make friends outside your major, variety is good. Organize your responsibilities, use a day planner, a dry erase board, whatever. Don't let an assignment fall through the cracks because you simply forgot about it. Don't not go to class. Have fun, party on the weekends. You're gonna want the stress relief."

And study for all of them. It may seem overwhelming at the time but your first year is your chance to get your GPA up before the really cool classes start. I made the mistake of being cocky right off the bat and didn't focus on a couple classes I should have. Plus your schedule is already so packed you'll thank yourself senior year for overloading your freshman and sophomore years for easier junior and senior years.  Good luck going in! It's challenging but it's a fun challenge.

EngineeringStudents,3b183y,RKO36,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"My time to shine!  I am doing a full-time co-op (~44 hours with overtime) while taking 3 pretty hard classes (Diff Eq, Dynamics, and Mechanics of Materials). I really don't have any free time to do anything, including the weekends.  I really would not recommend taking more than 1 class while working full time. For me, it was either taking the classes this summer or take one class next summer at my college and spending an extra semester after that. Taking these 3 classes this summer allows me to hopefully get a different internship next summer (as I wouldn't be limited to living in my college town) and also graduate on time. I am just glad I am halfway through it. I know I can pull off a C in all three classes so my credits will transfer over, but I am not sure how much information I will retain due to the accelerated pace and lack of time to study.  In your case, if you are just taking these classes to get a head start and maybe ease up your later semesters, I don't think taking more than one class during the summer would be worth it. You will not be able to enjoy yourself and it could even affect your performance at work. On the other hand, if you really need to take these classes to graduate on time, then maybe it is something you should look into. You just need to realize what you're in for."

EngineeringStudents,3b06bu,rogerrrr,2,Thu Jun 25 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"While I'm not the biggest fan of MS Word, it has to be said that most people don't know how to use it properly. Here are some tips off of the top of my head:   Learn to use heading/paragraph styles to do all of your formatting. You should rarely have to change fonts manually, and should practically never space something out by hitting enter a bunch of times. Doing this kinda janky shit just sets you up for failure when you have to make the whole document look consistent later. I have a template setup with my standard heading/paragraph styles so that I don't have to replicate this step every time I do an assignment. Write first, format second. If you're trying to deal with table placement etc while you're trying to write, you're going to lose your fucking mind. Get your shit down, then worry about making sure the table is on the right page. Learn to love the equation editor. Some good tips and tricks here: http://www.penwatch.net/cms/?cat=16 (not my blog btw) When formatting, do so with non-printing characters on. This makes it easier to deal with Word's quirks - you'll quickly learn when formatting is tied to a particular non-printing character which makes a whole paragraph jump around when you hit backspace once. Use the built in reference manager to make sure your references to tables/figures actually point to the correct things after you insert a new table midway through the document. Use Zotero for managing references to external sources in research-heavy papers. Cite as you write! Add domain-specific terms to the dictionary so it doesn't auto-replace your shit. Tweak auto-replace settings so they don't infuriate you anymore."

EngineeringStudents,3b06bu,fullhalfie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:55:44 2015 UTC,"Majority of my school doesn't use LaTex at all, so I normally just use word. Use what your comfortable with and try to become really proficient at it."
EngineeringStudents,3b06bu,rkkrqqqqrssss,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:21:09 2015 UTC,"Word takes a bit of work getting used to, but it's definitely worth it. You will in the future need to write a professional looking document in Word, probably many times. If you find some obscure program that works well, none of your colleagues will be able to open it or edit it.   It is usable once you get used to it. I handed in a 100 page report yesterday full of tables, figures, subheading etc. I did the rough formatting as I went, and then spent maybe half an hour at the end making it look pretty. If you're spending more than 30 seconds on formatting individual items as you go, you're not doing it as efficiently as you could be. Then for anything lab report sized (<30 pages), it shouldn't take you longer than 15 minutes at the end making sure everything is working right."

Beyond that, its just a cool and interesting thing that will help you during job searches and interviews. You have a huge, unique thing you were a part of and interviewers will value you. One of my best friends from high school plays D1 as well, and the guys on his team that are in any STEM field, especially engineering, have no problem networking and getting jobs after school.

I spent two summers away from the team in order to pursue internships, which ended up being very fruitful, as I start full time at the same company this August.   You have the time, though it will be tough to explain to your coach that your future might not include the NFL (and likely, it will not)  Good news is that you'll likely take 5 years to graduate, or move on to grad school for your final year of eligibility. You still have time to find an internship and get some experience.   Talk to your Athletic Advisors, as you might have a career-prep course you can take.  It will be hard for you to find a job without experience, but you can sell your commitment to your sport (especially football) as a full-time job throughout college. Also any alumni will probably love to at least interview you - its worth a shot to seek those people out.   If you've got any questions, feel free to PM me. Also, if you're in to being a MechE in the chemical industry, I'd love to help a fellow SA out."

I would imagine that listing UGA football on your resume would be on par with work experience for a lot of employers, especially in the south where more people are familiar with how big a deal UGA football is. I'm sure you learn some marketable skills there, like teamwork, tactics, hard work, etc. What do you personally do to improve the team? Can it be applied to the workplace? Can you talk about it in an interview? If so, play that up when advertising yourself to employers.  Work experience isn't everything. It's just one way to prove to employers that you have skills that will be useful to them.  You're going to have a really interesting resume, (UGA ME in UGA football?? How??) I think you'll got a lot of grabbing power with it. Hiring managers see so many boring-ass identical resumes every day that when an interesting one comes, it has an advantage to get to the interviewing process.

EngineeringStudents,3ay2j0,shaven_neckbeard,3,Wed Jun 24 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. One of my good friends was in this same position: played D1 football and graduated with his ME degree. He had the same worries about not having any internship experience. He did stop playing football his senior year because his knees were that of a 70 year of man, which probably allowed him to be more active in the job search, but he found a job before graduation. I told him the same thing as you mentioned in your comment. So what if you don't have any specific engineering internships, you played on a D1 football team, won back-to-back national championships (NDSU), and still have a 3.6 gpa. That shows incredible time management, dedication, and teamwork skills. In my opinion, those are some of the top qualities a hiring manager would look for."

Right now Braunschweig's football program is ranked #1 of europe. Every year they sign a bunch of college athletes who didn't make it to the NFL. Some are coming over on a year to year basis just to play football but some find a full time job here through the network of the team (e.g. structional engineers) So you might consider living a year abroad in Europe, playing football (practice is always in the evenings since only a few  import players can make a living out if it) and doing an internship or getting a full time job at the same time."

Not every employer is going to look at it the same way, but many will view the fact that you played D1 football as a major plus. Having said that, it definitely would help your resume if you could try and squeeze in an internship or part-time work experience during the off season. I know that there isn't really an ""off-season"" in D1 sports, but there definitely is usually a 3 month period where it's a lot lighter (workouts and weights 5 days a week instead of 6 haha). For basketball, that was during my summer. Looking back, I probably should have taken a little more advantage of that time to get a little work experience. Otherwise, use your class projects and senior project as a good opportunity to get good practical experience."

The Turkish student went to a public university in Turkey, then did an MS and PhD in the US.   And if you're interested in staying here and working, a lot of foreign students get a PhD, then do a postdoc while they apply for a green card. A PhD in engineering with a good publication record is usually enough I think. This article is written by a medical researcher, but most of it would apply to engineering too. A green card wouldn't be enough for a job that requires a security clearance, but it is enough for work on export-controlled projects and means employers wouldn't have to sponsor you for a visa."

EngineeringStudents,3ayefg,ScientificMK,2,Wed Jun 24 22:05:49 2015 UTC,"Coming from Egypt, it should not be a problem at all to get a graduate degree in the US. What will matter is how you did compared to your peers. Are you top 10%, 5%, etc,  of your class? Assuming you are good, the next obstacle is financial. If you apply for a PhD you might get financial support and then things are pretty straightforward. If you do not get support (e.g. going for a Masters) then you should show you have enough funds to sustain yourself and your family in the US. That would include proof of funds for tuition plus a monthly allowance. I hope this makes sense to you."

EngineeringStudents,3awz35,laxman1515,26,Wed Jun 24 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"The longer you work in a job that requires socializing, the easier it gets. Just remember to always be genuine and kind. Plus, when it comes to socializing, here are some good things to remember:  1) Use their name when you speak to them. ""Hey John! How are you doing today?"" ""What do you think about this situation, Mary?""  2) Focus on listening to what they are saying in the moment, instead of falling into the habit of thinking about the next thing you will say. Don't be afraid to take a moment or two to think about what you'll say, to hopefully help avoid jumbling.  3) Ask people for their advice or thoughts on things. This is actually a proven technique, because people appreciate feeling valued and needed.  4) Genuinely compliment people, to them directly or when talking about them to others. (From ""Sarah, I really enjoy working with you because you always have such a positive attitude about things."" to, ""You know, Ted is a great guy. He's been helping me with ____ and I've learned so much from him."")  Bonus: spontaneous trait transference -- aka, the words you use to describe other people in conversation become the words that people use to describe you.  5) In relation to that: avoid negative gossip. No need to be that person. Also, the whole trait transference thing.  6) Ask people about themselves. And when they share a bit about their life, disclose some of yours. It's like a transaction. It doesn't have to be super deep or personal. Example: You: Hey, Pat! How was your weekend, did you do anything fun? Pat: Oh, you know, just spent time with the family. We barbecued because the weather was so nice. You: It's that time of year! I learned everything I know about grilling from my dad, and my mom always made this great homemade BBQ sauce. What did you guys end up making? etc etc etc  7) Smile. Just get in the habit of smiling when you see people. Attitudes (both positive and negative) are contagious, and most people would rather be around someone who makes them feel happy than someone who brings them down."
EngineeringStudents,3awz35,mnk88,15,Wed Jun 24 05:15:39 2015 UTC,"Being social is like any other skill, it requires practice and constant upkeep.  The issue with engineering is that we usually end up with a lot less social interaction, especially with non engineers and outside a work environment.  In a non-engineering job, you're now noticing the socializing skill difference between you and people that have time and situation to develop their social skills.  Think of it like a skill you're practicing, even maybe admit it to the people you work with, people are surprisingly understanding. Especially since you are working with girls, suggestion is don't think of them as girls but just as people (as in take any sexual tension whatever out of the equation) and just try to interact - small talk, getting to know them, likes, dislikes, humor, general personality and conversational traits.  You'll fuck up at the beginning but you'll enjoy it when you start getting good, and when you enjoy it you'll seek it out more and get even better which you will enjoy more, a nice virtuous cycle.  I was very social due to team sports, but I know some awkward engineers, but its something he's admitted to, and especially his closer friends are really helping him to pick up on social cues that he is just mostly oblivious to, but he's definitely starting to get them. You're doing engineering, you're a smart kid, and social skills aren't really that hard."

Being social takes time and better that you learn now and not during an interview with an engineering firm or other professional career you choose. Start slow with small talk and slowly you will pick up what your fellow co-workers/classmates enjoy and maybe you might share similar interests. As for talking to girls, this will be the most challenging. Just act cool and be yourself. No need to impress them or anything. If they don't like your personality well FUCK THEM. This rule also applies to both sexes. Being social is important in your engineering career, but you don't want to loose a side of yourself that makes you, YOU!"

EngineeringStudents,3awz35,Roamingkillerpanda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"Agree with brooklyn_hapa.  Just another skill, and like any skill you may pick it up slowly or quickly but bottom line is with more practice you'll improve, especially if you make a point to improve on it (for example, think to yourself after awkward interactions what you could have done to make it less awkward, keep these in mind for future).  I'm still awkward in many many situations. Meeting a group of people who already know each other well is by far the worst for me (I don't want to feel like I'm butting into their conversation, and whenever they talk about past stories/funny moments I obviously can't relate).   I'm also still far more awkward around girls than guys in terms of making interesting conversation (i.e. more than just ""how was your day?"", ""how bout that weather?"", etc.). With guys I can usually go to some comfortable common interest topic. For me these common interest topics are usually some combination of sports, girls, videogames, and cars.   But like said, just keep with it, be persistent, be sure to note your mistakes, and in time you'll learn. In theory you can observe what others do to be more smooth in social situations but I find that this is very situational because of how different social interactions styles can be (i.e. what's funny for me to say/do isn't funny for you to say/do due to my body language, tone, tambor, timing, or just something as simple as how I'm regarded by my friends vs. how you're regarded)."

It is more difficult. Engineering in Canada is seen as a professional degree. Which means you'd probably have to take equivalency exams.   Here is the governing body for engineers in British Columbia."
EngineeringStudents,3ayrm1,LastSecondEscape,2,Wed Jun 24 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link. In the UK, Engineering is also a professional degree, and usually you have to get a few years of industry experience before you become a chartered engineer (equivalent to a P Eng in Canada/US)."

There's also the issue of getting a work permit, which I believe require an offer of employment, but I'm not sure.   Take a look at the classifieds to see what the job market is like. Common ones for engineers include the APEGBC career listings, Indeed, Canada Job Bank, etc. I don't know if Vancouver is really a hub for Biomedical companies.

If your professor has contacts with engineers in Canada then you'll have a better time finding work then just sending out resumes.  It's not a good market across the country for Juniors.  If you have +10 years experience then that's a totally different story.  I believe (could be wrong) that Ontario is the province most likely to have biomedical stuff.  When Alberta starts to move again then you'll know the market is changing.  Honestly, it would be better if you came over with your full designation.

EngineeringStudents,3azk36,Metalgreek,2,Wed Jun 24 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"Well, not gonna be a dick like the other guy, but I also second not switching to biomedical engineering. It is a very niche field, and limited job opportunities. However, as an electrical or mechanical engineer, you can still break through in the industry while leaving your options open. There are thousands of things an electrical/mechanical engineer can do. A biomedical engineering degree just pigeonholes you too early on. It's good as a specialized degree (grad school), but you should really get a base in electrical/mechanical.   I took this advice myself when attempting to switch to biomedical. I ended up electrical, and while I did end up losing interest altogether in biomedical, I have a broad field to play in and could still head that way if I wanted to.   The other user does have a point though. If you've failed this math class multiple times (and you have really been trying), it may be time to consider other alternatives to engineering."

EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,lazy_monk,8,Thu Jun 25 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"Do you really understand what a PhD candidate does on a paid assistanceship? They're getting their education at least partially, but in many cases fully, paid for. On top of that, they're paid a stipend by the university to teach intro level courses as Graduate Assistants. Factor in the cost of going to whatever university you're looking at and add that to the stipend that you'd get paid, then look at that as the total payday. You're not just going to school to make money, you're going for an education.  Also uni in the US is very different from uni over in Europe. The biggest difference to me is the cost. I have a friend who got his degree in Germany and paid a fraction of a fraction of what I'm paying in the states. Because tuition is so cheap there, they can afford to pay their PhD candidates more than we can in the states.  No offense man, but you're an engineering student, start thinking like one."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,lazy_monk,-5,Thu Jun 25 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"I know they have their education fully paid for. And yes they do have lower tuition in Europe, but why is that in-state students who are subsidized by tax payers at state schools don't get a higher stipend compared to out of state or international students? Why do they get a smaller total package than an international student?  I'm not saying I'm going into it for the money. But honestly, I'd like to have a decent income while a graduate student. I'm not saying I want entry level wages for EE while in grad school (60k+), I'm saying I want to not be exploited for less than a stocker at Costco makes.  Also, most PhD students aren't taking classes after a couple years outside of a few special topics courses so their tuition being paid is mostly a moot point. By the time they get to candidacy they are taking no courses at all.  Hell, I could go to the Department of Energy or NASA and get them to cover a PhD completely after working for them for three years while getting a real salary as long as the research is related to their mission."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,meerkatmreow,3,Thu Jun 25 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"Everything you're saying is making it sound like you're only interested in this PhD for the money; that's the wrong reason. You get a PhD to further your education and if you're doing that to make more money, good for you, but don't expect the entire country's higher education policies to change because one guy thinks he should get paid more in his stipend than a costco stocker. This is just the way things are. The wages will be similar at any university and any program you're looking at. If you want to make more money, forgo the assistanceship, pay for all the education yourself, and go work at costco. But by doing so, you're making less money in the long run due to the cost of your education and you're losing out on the experience you'd get from teaching.  Also, if the fucking DoE or NASA wants to pay for you, go ahead, but you're not going to be making more money. Your stipend from the university is based off of how many hours you decide to work in the classroom. You're not going to get paid for your research. All the research you're going to be doing for your PhD program is basically au gratis, but it serves to increase your understanding of the field, produce publishable work that you can be the first author on for your final board of review, and to also give you experience and credibility for employers in the future that will be looking for PhD students for higher paid positions. The positions that become attainable to you right out of your PhD program come because you have more education than that of a bachelor's student and have done the research to prove it.  Going through a PhD program is not about making money in the interim so stop assuming that's what it's about. Your stipend is shitty, I get it. But my stipend will be just as bad, my sister's is just as bad, both of my parents' were just as bad. Stipends suck but what you gain in your program is worth so much more than any monetary value you can give it. You're thinking about this with tunnel vision when you need to be looking at the big picture."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,naiku,-4,Thu Jun 25 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the stipends in the US suck way more than other nations. I'm wondering if there are any universities where they don't suck as much?  I know the benefits of a PhD program. I know the reasons to go into one. I just want to be making more than $25,000 in a year. If it wasn't for my girlfriend being stuck in the US because she's going for a teaching licensure, I'd go to a country where they pay people doing the exact same things as a PhD student in the US but pay them more than $10,000 over the poverty line. As I said, if they paid say $30k to $40k in the US based on region that would be more conscionable. I don't care about that much money. I care about being able to afford maintaining my 2007 car, afford to go out with my girlfriend one or two times a month, afford an emergency fund, and not worry about not having enough money to afford going to a $3 movie or paying $8 to go to the zoo."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,axz055,2,Thu Jun 25 05:44:01 2015 UTC,"You can very easily live on $18k to $20k. My sister drives a 2009 car and maintains it, pays her insurance, gas, housing, utilities, food, literally everything herself and I know for a fact that she's still putting money in the bank. That whole poverty line thing is a misnomer because you don't have any kids. The average cost of a kid is $250k and it's an expense you don't have to deal with. You'll have a paycheck equating to around $1,800 per month which is plenty to live on. Put $500 in the bank, live in modest housing that's around $500 a month, the next $500 can go towards your utilities and cost of living and then you've got around a bit of money left to do whatever you want with it.  Get it through your head that being a PhD student does not mean you're going to be living in shitty, low income housing typically occupied by those near or under the poverty line. There's a ton of student oriented housing near universities where it's still a nice play to live but doesn't break the bank. It's totally doable.  And to answer your question, no. In the United States, there aren't really any universities where your stipend will not suck. I've said this before. Yes, I know you can get paid more in other countries but you've already said this isn't an option.  These are the facts:   You can live well off a stipend You will be able to pay for everything with that stipend Stipends suck everywhere If you want to make A LOT of money NOW, a PhD program may not be for you   Beyond that, I don't really understand what you don't get about this. Stipends suck, but they're not a sentence to four years of impoverished hell."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,naiku,-2,Thu Jun 25 06:05:19 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I'm not arguing I should be making a lot of money now. If I wanted that, I'd go take a job with a company where I'd be making $60k to $80k.  As for ""student oriented housing,"" I know what that's like. It's loud, cramped, and low quality at most places. Also, I'm very introverted. I can deal with people for 8 to 10 hours at most a day before I need to go find an almost completely silent area to just sit back, listen to music, and relax for hours. That isn't always a real possibility near a campus on a Friday night or on the weekend.  So you live a bit further away. Depending where you decide to live you may or may not be able to use public transportation to get to the campus.  I'm just saying it's disrespectful for them to pay us peanuts. Hell, NSF even admitted that it's not enough and is issuing fellowships with stipends of $32,000 for 2015 and $34,000 for 2016."

Um, not really. I go to a university that's around top 150 in terms of engineering and only top 100 in terms of overall public universities and there's plenty of options. Yeah, there's the shitty student housing like what you're describing but seriously, that's not all that exists. Look around, there's both ends of the spectrum anywhere you go.   I'm just saying it's disrespectful for them to pay us peanuts. Hell, NSF even admitted that it's not enough and is issuing fellowships with stipends of $32,000 for 2015 and $34,000 for 2016.   Okay, yeah, cool. It's ""disrespectful"" how much tuition costs for a bachelor's degree and how much textbooks themselves cost."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,EngineerEddy,-4,Thu Jun 25 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well, my BS at OSU will cost less than an English student in the UK or someone in Germany so I don't know what you're saying about tuition costs being unreasonable. $11,000 a year for all fees and tuition seems like a great deal considering they pay more than that in the UK and Germany for schooling. Their schooling isn't actually free at a university. It usually is for college though, but college comes before university in Europe.  So if I went to the same school as my undergrad (I know it's not the best option, but it could very well be the best school that I get into as it is top 20 in EE), I could either live near a bunch of loud college undergrads or I could live near the ghetto if I want to be within walking/biking distance of campus. So the other option is live further away. Housing becomes cheaper and higher quality, but you often need to drive instead of take the bus because the bus service isn't really that great. So you end up paying say $300 for parking because you don't want to pay extra for better parking. Plus you have to drive everyday to campus. That increases cost of living a lot.  Maybe I have high standards of living. Maybe I like having more than $500 of income to put away for emergencies and entertainment."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,EngineerEddy,3,Thu Jun 25 06:39:26 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how you're getting by for only $11k a year in tuition but you're seriously not the norm. And you can live very well on a stipend, it's all about budgeting. I have a high standard of living and could live very comfortably with what my sister has. If you don't think you can live well enough then that's your issue. You're just creating more and more reasons for yourself not to get a PhD."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,zebrastripe665,0,Thu Jun 25 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"Welcome to in-state tuition. My current yearly expenses are $14,000 living and lifestyle and $11,000 tuition. The only thing is, I don't pay for my phone or my car. That's a good $300-400/month savings by not paying for insurance, maintenance, or phone service. Yes, I include maintenance in monthly costs because it needs to be budgeted for."

Having gone to OSU, you're honestly full of shit on this point. The Columbus bus system is pretty good, especially around campus. You could easily live in Victorian village, grandview, clintonville or ua while making heavy use of the bus system. Since you mentioned a car, its sometimes annoying but not impossible to find street parking if you know where to look for those occasions you have to drive  As to the stipend, it varies from department to department (and even by professor). If you're competitive enough for NSF, NDSEG or SMART, those all pay pretty well by comparison"
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,burdlinsky,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:34:03 2015 UTC,"I live in UA, it takes 50 minutes by bus to get from my place to campus. The bus runs once an hour and stops at 8 pm. You have a 50/50 chance of getting to campus at 8 for an early class on any given day. It's much easier to drive because I don't need to worry about staying late to work on something then having to find someway to get home that doesn't take forever."
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,LukeSkyWRx,2,Thu Jun 25 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"During the semester you are a student, not a full time researcher. This means even though you spend much more than 20 hours a week working, you are paid for 20 hours of work. You are a part-time employee making around $24/hour.  During the summer you are hired at full-time which is around $50k annually.  I am unsure where you got the impression that you would make any money as a PhD candidate / student. I always heard and had the impression that you should break even financially. You are getting all school fees, tuition, and a stipend to pay for living expenses.   Your PhD is effectively 'free' in STEM. Stress, time, and other hardships are just bonuses :)"
EngineeringStudents,3b1c30,LukeSkyWRx,2,Thu Jun 25 05:21:47 2015 UTC,"None of the programs I applied to (or at least got into) gave a pay increase in the summer. I got paid the same year-round. And I got paid the same when I was done with classes and did research full-time. The only time I got more money was when I was working as a TA and doing research, but it was only a 10% increase."

My most commonly-received math grade is an A. You can be a  successful engineer without having gotten A's in math and with a few C's here and there, but you shouldn't be getting C's in the majority of your subjects. If that's the case it's likely either an issue with poor study skills and time management, or a weak foundation, both of which can be an issue later on."

They said they're putting together a salary package and I'll find out in the next 2 days if I got the job.   I'm shitting myself to be honest. I really wanted to work as close to home as possible, but this is too good an opportunity to miss if the salary package is reasonable enough to accept.   If I get the job I'm thinking I'll do it for 2 years, try to save 80% of my salary and return home with enough for a deposit on a house.

EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,sunnyk1911,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"Where are you coming from? If you are at the U of MN, then the science/engineering career fair is your best option.   As far as companies to apply to - 3M has a ton of facilities in the Twin Cities area. Well repsected company, and say you put in a year there, your resume will float to the top (in my experience) since lots of people in engineering spots at Medtronic, General Mills, Seagate, et al have worked at 3M previously."

EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,gimpwiz,4,Tue Jun 23 18:59:13 2015 UTC,How much is rent? If you don't mind me asking
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,hokaythxbai,9,Tue Jun 23 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"1600/month for a 1-bed, owner pays city utils (water, garbage, whatever) and we pay electricity+gas and obviously internet. No parking or anything fancy like that. Fairly small, bit shabby, definitely livable.  Oh, yeah, since it's two people, we split the cost.  2500/month can still get you very nice 1-beds in various parts of the city, and occasionally bigger places. (Hell, we saw a house for 2500, 3 bed + multiple parking spots; and a 2 bed + living room + kitchen + deck for the same.)  Them's city prices."
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,gimpwiz,6,Tue Jun 23 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"Insanely low unless you're near oil, in which case I've seen SF-level prices when I was in ND a year ago.  With that said, I'd fucking love to live someplace like ND, except my job is too awesome and I don't think oil has anything as fun. That, and the fact that there's no work apart from the occasional oil and mining outfit.  But yes, I pay more in rent than my parents pay in mortgage."
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,gimpwiz,3,Wed Jun 24 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"Damn your mortgage is my rent plus utilities says Internet for a 2 bed, 1 bath, two floor plus basement townhouse in Ohio."

EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,compstomper,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah Ive heard that too, any idea if having an european passport helps at all?  Might be easier just to go to Germany after all"
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,albertofp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:22:16 2015 UTC,I don't know much about the situation in Europe but in the US it costs a ton to sponsor an employee with a greencard (500k-1mil?) My boss is from Germany and he just went through that whole ordeal. And companies definitely take that into account when it comes to what they would pay you.
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,unityskater,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"Oh well, thanks!  Seems like I will have to work harder then!"
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,albertofp,2,Mon Jun 29 06:08:16 2015 UTC,Study and work hard. Nothing is impossible you just have to make sure you're the best candidate they can select. What are you studying?
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,Imperial_Trooper,2,Mon Jun 29 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"Not in university yet, but if everything goes acording to plan I'll be starting CompE next year at the best/2nd best school in the country.  Studying harder than I ever have, cant wait to start engineering :)"
EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,albertofp,2,Wed Jun 24 04:27:07 2015 UTC,"You need sponsorship from a company to get into either. You really need to stand out. The US is especially difficult as you'll be competing with graduates from the best engineering schools in the world. Get as much documentable experience as possible, practice your English writing and speaking skills, and make yourself stand out when applying."

EngineeringStudents,3aujwc,compstomper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:15:52 2015 UTC,"I went to school at the University of Central Florida. I want to get out for probably similar reasons you want to leave Boston. I grew up within 20 minutes of where I went to school. I'd never lived anywhere else. I just wanted a change in scenery. Florida is wonderful. I loved the beaches and I loved Disney and theme parks. Now I love mountains and hiking and traveling 5 or less hours to all sorts of different climates. In 5 hours or less, I can go from the desert to Mexico or San Diego beaches or the mountains in flagstaff for snow and skiing, etc or Vegas to gamble and party. If I want to stay in Phoenix, there is ALWAYS something going on. Want to go to a Polish cultural festival or an ostrich race, we've got that. Florida is very much one climate. And it'll take you much more than 5 hours to get somewhere different. I think you'll like it. Just not somewhere I wanted to stay forever."

EngineeringStudents,3awric,EngineerEddy,2,Wed Jun 24 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"Learn about the field, for example with investment banking or trading you should learn about who the big banks are (bulge bracket-BB), who the elite boutiques are, who the middle markets (MM) are, etc. You should know about what they do (don't just say they move around money and take a slice from the top), i.e. mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, etc. If you're on the S&T side know about how markets work, options, derivatives, basic knowledge of algorithms, etc.  If you can prove your interest and knowledge of the field, and then back up that interest with proven technical/quantitative skill from your engineering education background, then you can be a competitive candidate.  At a career fair if the banks or trading firms come it's purely up to you to sell yourself, I've seen it done before (engineering majors with no prior relevant internships getting into elite banks or consulting firms)."

EngineeringStudents,3axeku,theBergmeister,5,Wed Jun 24 07:14:23 2015 UTC,"In my experience (9yrs engine design at large OEM), these sets of design problems are not tackled with one software all at once. A CFD program is used for head and valve flow, heat transfer issues, and tracts of intake or exhaust, or pieces of the turbo like the blade and housing design. Other software is used to analyze the cooling package options quickly. Something like Matlab or proprietary software might be used for combustion analysis. Something like GT Power or proprietary software might be used to perform a 1D/2D simulation of the whole engine to help match the cam, compression ratio, turbo, ignition timing, manifold length tuning, and rough heat rejection estimates. So each tool is used in turn to answer specific questions about the design and help iterate the designs slowly. But even for each of these, in lab testing is used to validate the models and help adjust the nearly limitless parameters to make iterative predictions useful."
EngineeringStudents,3axeku,drewtam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:15:27 2015 UTC,I'm just about to start trying to learn GT Power next week.  Do you have any suggestions on what I should focus on learning how to do?  I have a model of a Formula Student engine made by a master's student last year that I believe has been verified against test data and the goal is to work on some turbocharging simulations.  Just for my own learning I'd love to go beyond figuring out and adjusting the model that someone else created.  Anything in particular you would suggest doing?
EngineeringStudents,3axeku,BaltimoreBirdGuy,2,Wed Jun 24 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"Where I worked had their own proprietary modeling software for the full system 1D/2D simulation. So I don't have much to say about GT Power. The hardest part I found was leaping from a known matched model (matched to lab data) and switching out hardware (turbo, cam, injector, etc) and trying to estimate what new correction factors should be used for best apples to apples comparisons."

EngineeringStudents,3av787,who_dat_who_der,3,Wed Jun 24 00:08:30 2015 UTC,I bought both books and regret buying the review manual. The book is so large and has so many topics that it was overwhelming. I preferred the problem sets in the smaller book. Went through it twice and passed the test the first time. Just my two cents. Good luck.

EngineeringStudents,3avexw,platypusincanada,12,Tue Jun 23 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"90% of the time when I see someone complaining about the workload of engineering its because one of two reasons:  1) They have work/volunteer/legitimate responsibilities outside of school that interferes with their ability to keep up with the material.  2) They procrastinate studying/reviewing/assignments to the last minute and thus feel like they need to cram an entire semesters worth of material into a few days.  If you consistently review the material for atleast 4-5 hours everyday, you'll have more than enough free time, low stress around midterm/exam time and no problem keeping up with assignments. However, you almost certainly will constantly feel swamped if you have terrible professors/ don't attend lectures/don't understand the fundamentals."
EngineeringStudents,3avexw,Team_BBC,3,Tue Jun 23 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"Guilty of both one and two. OP: doing the course work as soon as you get home certainly helps, but if you're not revising throughout the semester then its going to be tough come exam time. Like /u/Team_BBC says, 4-5 hours a day is definitely the ticket. I end up doing this during my end of semester panic mode and everything feels a lot better."

I graduated with a 3.7+ GPA, but managed to have enough free time outside of studying to amass 100+ days of goddamn anime watching over the course of undergrad. My time management is tighter than a gnat's ass when I care enough though, so I could get away with that when I wasn't doing any extracurriculars.  Now on the other hand... when you throw in research, design team activities, or a part-time internship into the mix is where it becomes absolutely brutal depending on how devoted you are to them. I got heavily sucked into research during one semester and easily spent 30-40 hours a week on that alone, which left me no room for anything else along with just barely keeping up with classwork. During times like that it's like fighting a hydra; complete one assignment/project while 1-2 more pop up in its place."

That doesn't mean declining all social events - it means going to social events and not wasting time later. I will go to the movies with you, I'll play sports, I'll hit the gym. But I will not spend more than 10 minutes a day on social media, when I have 15 spare minutes I will use them, and ""work time"" really means work time. I started early, read the material before each lecture, practiced previous exams in preparation.  However, the bigger problem is the feeling of being ""swamped with work"". Even if you keep up with the workload, the stress/pressure of not falling behind is not worth it.  Here's a better idea: Enjoy it! The workload will never end during the semester. But don't see it as ""stuff you have to keep up with"". Every time I felt burned out, I would think: ""What do I really want to do with my time?"" Every time, I realize that I really enjoy being productive.  That's my secret - that's how I go for weeks and weeks without letting myself slip up or waste time. I immerse myself in my studies and actually have fun doing so. Not such a bad deal."

If you have that then you don't need to list any other GPA, period.  If your cumulative is not >3.75, then list major GPA in addition to cumulative if it's significantly higher (>0.2 higher IMO).  If you have an awful freshman year and it's like, your junior or senior year (aka at least 2 semesters of decent GPA since Freshman year), then I guess you can list post-Freshman GPA, but they're going to ask about it, so prepare an answer.  But like said, in your case your cumulative is high enough to blow away any recruiter, so you don't need anything other than just plain old cumulative GPA, in fact I'd personally consider it gratuitous/wasteful (it's another line on your resume, or just more clutter)."

I would only be able connect this with environmental engineering in civil, but I'm not too interested in collecting water samples or analyzing them. Jobs are not as plenty as well as other civil disciplines (geotechnical/structural/hydraulic)."
EngineeringStudents,3avifx,pyzparticle,2,Tue Jun 23 22:24:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, double majors are usually pointless due to several reasons.   Division of labor is standard practice - your broad knowledge in disparate disciplines won't help you, because they've hired someone else to deal with that field. Worst case scenario that someone will get territorial about it.  In a very short time, most of your skills will be from work experience rather than course experience, so whatever you learned in school that you don't do at work, due to #1, will fade into the background.  It usually won't help you transition later in your career, due to #2.  It's basically a waste of money due to #1,2, and 3. (If you're financially situation is sound then by all means explore your passion for learning. If you're on student loans than you need to get into the workforce asap.) The coverage of single engineering majors are already too broad from the standpoint of division of labor, so even for people with single majors, #2 hits really hard.    They do however make sense if you're planning on entering interdisciplinary fields (Chem + EE = materials, Chem + Civil = Env Eng.), and your school doesn't offer the specialized degree.  I'm also going to be quite unequivocal about the fact that /u/RKO36 has no idea what he's talking about when he claims civil is broader than EE. Literally every endeavor of any significance probably since steam engines went away required EE's. Also, finding a field EE job simply requires you to leave consumer electronics behind and look at companies that don't live on the NASDAQ. Just off the top of my head you could try the power industry, manufacturing, transportation. Civil seems broad but compared to any of the big 3 (ChE, EE, ME) its pretty damn specialized.   You should pick Civil, because EE is clearly not your thing. But if I were in your position, I'd also drop chemistry because double majors are a waste of time."

EngineeringStudents,3av0mx,superdiglett100,3,Tue Jun 23 18:56:21 2015 UTC,"That's rough. Other than talking to the department, there's not much you can do. It's not the end of the world, you can still retake the course. You're training to be an engineer and it's your job to problem solve. Sometimes that includes owning your mistakes and doing better the next time around. 10 years from now, I don't think you're gonna care too much about failing a class."
EngineeringStudents,3av0mx,tokenasian1,2,Tue Jun 23 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"Talk to the Dept heads and professors. Maybe they'll allow you to simultaneously take the following class while retaking Solid Mechanics in the same semester since you've already taken SM once already.

They were then allowed to take the second class concurrently with the make-up class.  Personally I think it's stupid and I'm pretty mad that they were allowed to. I got a D in the class a year prior, and I asked if I could still continue. Permission denied. Set me back an entire year in that series, and probably my graduation as well because it meant I had to take that class instead of others that I needed.   Hopefully you can get permission, but you'll just have to live with the consequences if you don't. Use it as motivation to not fuck it up again."
EngineeringStudents,3av0mx,mnk88,2,Wed Jun 24 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"First thing to remember is that this isn't the end of the road, just a little speed bump.  You can try to talk with your department to work out a solution that can keep you on track for your current expected graduation date. Otherwise, if that's not possible, find a way to spin this as an opportunity for change or improvement. Maybe secure an internship or co-op and take a semester off for the work experience if your graduation date is going to be pushed back a year. Use this as a chance to demonstrate your ability to bounce back... view it as a character-building circumstance."

Based on the interests you express, I would not give up being a scientist. I would try to get to the best school I could and it would not matter if it is not amongst the top ones. There are really good graduate programs at mid-level schools. I am pretty confident once you start your PhD and compare yourself with others at your new program your self-esteem will come back. Once you are in a graduate program, it is entirely up to you. Grades don't matter anymore and all focus should go into your research. At the end of the day your thesis and publications will be the only thing that matter to get a job as a scientist, either in industry or academia. Don't give up! I wish you the best!"
EngineeringStudents,3av0mu,ScientificMK,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"To be a scientist you need a PhD and post docs and luck.  Most PhDs cannot become professional scientists.    I spent 2 years without a full time job after graduating with honors in physics.  I had both a BS and a MS but not quite good enough for a PhD.  In science its PhD or bust...  So I got a job in a restaurant about a year after graduation.  In the mean time I went back to school for engineering and applied to hundreds of places and I finally got lucky.  Look for a technician type job or just a regular job to pay the bills.  I usually strongly suggest graduate school of some kind for people in your situation... but your finances and GPA may preclude that.  Note that you only have to pay off student loans if you make a lot of money under ""Income Based Repayment"".  I have a lot of student loans but I pay less than the interest alone and they will be forgiven after 25 years of payment since my income is not high."

EngineeringStudents,3aucco,TheOnlinePolak,7,Tue Jun 23 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"Well, what do you need to do? Write a report, or just work on something? If you want to actually do something in depth, then your research can go pretty deep; finding books, journals, patents, etc. etc.  If you just want to learn something and build something, your ""Research"" could be as much as reading a wikipedia article.  After 5 years of uni, and mid-way through an internship, all I've learnt is how to google a bit better, and better use my Uni's access to Journal websites for proper literature. Almost everything I do starts with reading wikipedia though.  Start off by reading the basics, and if you don't properly understand something, make a note of it, and search for another source that may explain it better/differently. Sometimes you will need to read the same thing 3-4 times from different sources to properly ""Understand"" it.  Often you will need to search for an equation, or a method, find these, and make good note of them. See if the variables are useful in your case. If it seems useful, that could be what you want.   What do you actually want to start on? give me an example."
EngineeringStudents,3aucco,KrassLord,2,Tue Jun 23 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"My example is I have an idea for an ""invention"" if I can even call it that.

EngineeringStudents,3aucco,KrassLord,6,Tue Jun 23 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, well keep in mind that you're somewhat in the wrong place, as you've got more of a computer science question. Virtual assistants are pretty proprietary things, really, which take a bunch of input from many different services and use probably some sort of highly-custom computer learning (Search around this topic)  algorithms to work out things such as suggestions etc; with complex components such as voice recognition, which is a large subject unto itself.

I am currently doing an Internship with a large company, that is quite computer science related; but I've since realised I don't want to really pursue a software-oriented role in the future at all.  Ideally I'd work on something within the space/aero industry; making good use of my programming skills but not focussed on the development so much. It sounds vague because it is vague.  Really though, I took CS to give me much better leverage into roles I am more interested in; and it has turned out to be a good choice. Many companies advertise engineering roles and ask for good programming skills, a CS/Eng double asserts this."

If you're interested in the second part, Google Scholar is one of the better search engines for this (IMO). If you search it at your school, you should be able to find more links to journal articles, because a lot of them require a subscription to access, which schools are more likely to have (highschools vary greatly depending on school board and location).   If you have something more specific or an example of being unable to research properly, I think I could do a better job at explaining that. I would be able to give a breakdown of my thought process as I'm researching a topic, which might help more than whatever rambling I just did."

EngineeringStudents,3av8am,okiedokieartichoke,4,Tue Jun 23 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"There are generally two kinds of interviews (or interview questions), broadly speaking: technical and ""human."" A technical interview is where you answer specific questions and/or delve into designs. The other kind is basically where the interviewer wants to know if you're human, and if so, what kind of human you are - can you get along with people? will they be able to get along with you? will you be receptive to teaching and criticism? are you a jerk? are you a cannibal?  As a coworker said (who had interviewed me when I applied for the job): As long as you have a foundation of knowledge and skill in the appropriate area, we can teach you anything. But if you're a dick, we can't teach you not to be one.  The cliche advice is ""be yourself."" The real advice is ""be yourself on a date - you're still you, but you're talking about interesting things, showing passion, being attentive, asking questions."" In other words, if the you is someone who spends 10% of their time saving puppies from burning orphanages while hiking old ruins at the peaks of tall mountains and 90% of their time looking at cats on reddit, try to focus on the part that's interesting. (PS, if you suck at dates, see above.)  ""What do you like to do in your spare time?"" ""Well, last weekend I watched a bunch of youtube videos on how to fix this thing with my car. It's really not complicated; it took me like three hours, but I learned a lot and if I had to pay someone it would cost me like $200 in labor. So I guess right now I'm learning about cars, starting from the basics and working up. I also like to design little boards to do nifty little things, and next weekend I'm going to design a diagnostics PCB so I can tap into and re-arrange my car's audio lines to figure out why one of them seems lossy. I guess that's a roundabout way of saying I like to tinker with electrical systems, and now mechanical ones too. It's great to see some very different designs from what I do every day at work.""  Doesn't mean I know jack shit about cars, but I do like learning more about 'em, and the interviewer would know that 1) I do hobbyist hacking of various sorts, 2) I can probably shoot the shit about cars or whatever people often talk about at work [I live in silicon valley, people love cars here], and 3) I have interests. Boom technical points, boom human points. Not saying that that specific answer is what you want to say, but just shit like that works to show you're a real person.  Edit: typos"

EngineeringStudents,3av8am,seeking_perhaps,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"Most of the interviews for internships or recent grads usually end up like what you experienced. In the first interview, they usually aren't going to drill you hard on technical knowledge (unless you're recent grad). They are more concerned with whether or not you are a good fit for the team, and what kind of person you are outside of school/work. People do care about that kind of stuff.   I was actually asked about what I did in my free time in all 3 of my interviews before I got my internship. I was pretty straightforward with them. I told them I usually just play video games with my friends, and that I worked out. It's probably better to be honest with them than to make shit up - at least it worked for me."

EngineeringStudents,3avvk8,infernalmachine64,3,Tue Jun 23 22:37:17 2015 UTC,Comp Sci is definitely the better major if you just want to do programming. Comp Eng involves hardware and the lowest level languages which you would never use for video games.
EngineeringStudents,3avvk8,Catalyst93,2,Tue Jun 23 22:39:38 2015 UTC,"Be aware that game programming does in fact involve a lot of math, especially for games that use 3D graphics.  Linear Algebra is incredibly necessary when doing anything with 3D graphics.  My point is, don't give up on calculus, if anything CS will be just as math intensive as computer engineering.    Look at the course sequences for each degree and choose the one that puts you on the path for the career you want.  If CS will allow you to take game programming courses, then maybe do that.  My experience and from what I've read is that C++ dominates the game dev industry, and at least at my university they teach C++ to computer engineering majors and java to CS majors, so in that case computer engineering might be a better choice.  You just need to take into account all the factors at play here.  In the end, either degree will probably teach you many employable skills and help you to gain a foothold in whatever industry you want to work in (provided you work hard for it)."

Otherwise you could try some maintenance, check if any tools around the place need some love, even maybe just a clean.  If you are interning, you are trying to add value to your name. You might have agreed with your employer or your manager to do a certain role, or assist a certain team member, but there is no reason you can't add value by making the hours you get paid for be the hours you do something productive.

They could try to appeal to girls and women who like sport, or music, or Dr Who, or sci-fi, or anything else, but they chose a fancy cupcake.   Don't get me wrong. I think these kind of events are great. Most girls I knew in school never even considered engineering as a legitimate career. Hell, I didn't for years, even though my father is an engineer. It took me filling out a ""what career suits you?"" survey, where 8 out of the top 10 results were some sort of engineering for me to even think about it as a potential career. So something that says to women, particularly those interested in maths and science, that engineering is a great career choice is a fantastic idea.   But a cupcake?"

They don't get looked at strangely, they don't asked if they're ""really sure"" it's what they want to do, they don't get told it's ""too hard"" for their entire gender, they don't get shown where the crèche is at a job interview, they don't get sent interstate to a really dry internship because the interesting internship was ""at a very male dominated site"".   Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that being male and studying engineering is easy. But there is a certain stigma against women in engineering that means that some countries are only seeing 6% of their engineers being female. This event isn't disadvantaging men in any way."
EngineeringStudents,3at5ss,Szos,-4,Wed Jun 24 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"I know plenty of female engineers, including working with them, and it seems that if this myth even exists, its perpetuated by other women more than any guy.

EngineeringStudents,3at5ss,candydaze,4,Wed Jun 24 01:14:11 2015 UTC,"Women can be sexist against women too. Women aren't one homogeneous group with identical agendas.   Sexism:    prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.   Nowhere in that definition does it say ""by men"". I'm not trying to blame anyone for sexism, I'm trying to say that it is bad, for the individuals and for a society that loses out on some of its best potential engineers, because engineering was never presented to them as a viable career option.   I'm sorry if you don't believe that sexism exists. But it does. You say that women have more opportunities to get engineering degrees than guys, but you haven't seen what pressure they go through from classmates, friends, family, career counselors, the works. The fact that we are still seeing such low numbers of female engineering graduates suggests that your ""more opportunities"" hypothesis is wrong."

What you put on your resume are just talking points. If you can at least talk for a minute about anything on your resume, then it's fine. Don't put stuff just to fill space on the page if you don't have the ability or experience to talk about it. Don't lie or mislead any potential employer.   If you don't have any experience, then get some experience instead of worrying about what to put on your resume. If you're active in anything at all (clubs, sports, etc.), you'll be able to put it on your resume and talk about it for a very long time.   I didn't put it on my resume because I had other stuff to put on related to engineering, but I was fairly involved in a competitive gaming scene. I volunteered for some events, went to many events, and I even competed locally myself for a little bit. Even though it wasn't related, I could have talked a lot about it to anybody for a pretty long time. I spent like 2 or 3 years doing that kind of stuff, and I still kind of do on a smaller scale. If you do something for that long, you definitely have stories to tell and lessons learned. If you have anything like that at all, include it."

EngineeringStudents,3av1nw,Thiggles,4,Wed Jun 24 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"NCSU has a good online engineering master's program, and the tuition is pretty reasonable, even for out-of-state. But there's no such thing as a good reputable online engineering PhD. You can get a master's with just coursework, but a PhD requires research and is generally like a full-time job. I suppose you could do computational research remotely, but you'd still probably need to commit to doing it full time and certain things would likely need to be in person, like oral exams.   For Master's programs, the US News list: http://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/engineering/rankings is pretty good, but not every school offers all their programs online. I mentioned NCSU because I know they offer all or most of them."
EngineeringStudents,3av1nw,axz055,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:33:50 2015 UTC,I was looking at the master's program and possibly transferring to a traditional route. I hear that online course degrees aren't respected as much as a traditional thesis one. Plus it's terminal if I'd want to go back.
EngineeringStudents,3av1nw,Old_Caroline,2,Wed Jun 24 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between a thesis-based and a coursework-based master's program, regardless of whether you do it in-person or online. From what I've seen, coursework-based programs are mainly for working professionals looking for a sort of incremental improvement in their skills, often paid for by your employer. Thesis-based programs are more for people looking to go into research.   So yeah, if you're applying for an R&D position or a PhD program, a person with actual research experience will probably have an advantage. But if you're already employed, I don't know that it would be to your advantage to quit to do a thesis program unless you hate your current job.  If you're going to do it in-person, full-time, there's no real reason not to do a thesis-based one."

It seems if you travel a lot then unless you have a specific goal, perhaps a more theory oriented job, a graduate degree would require you to either go crazy trying to keep up on it, or, get little to nothing out of the experience.  Also, a PhD isn't just a few courses you log in to.  It is original research that takes several years of full time work.

You are unlikely to be overqualified for jobs, but if you are overqualifeid it is for the jobs that are lower level BS only.  Having two bachelors degrees is a lengthy expensive proposition for having no higher level of education than you did when you started.  Also you mention a problem of having no experience?  But you wouldn't at your current rate anyway, or if you did a BS.  Not to mention it is very possible to be hired during the MS and gain experience, or do a thesis that is of sufficient uniqueness that an employer becomes interested in you for that unique capability.

If you have a good relationship with some of your professors it may be worth asking them, however you have to weigh up whether you want to keep the 2:1 and hope they don't pick up on it or go with the 2:2 and see where that takes you. If you stick with the 2:1 there is always a chance to get a masters later on from employee funding or when you've saved up after a few years. What university will you be graduating from?"

Voltage- generally higher volts will result in higher torque, but this is assuming the panels can supply enough current, if not, then you will HAVE to wire in parallel to get the car to even move.   Gearing- generally higher gear ratio will result in higher acceleration, but this is assuming many thing- your top end speed is sufficient to to win he race, you don't want to top out too quickly.  These are all things you can very easily Google, btw, to get more information."
EngineeringStudents,3at5ji,JoeReal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:56:38 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot it did help :)  Each panel supplies about 2 volts and an amp each and it is a 3 volt motor. We wired them in parallel as the car wasn't moving at all in series.  We originally geared the car so that it was a 1:1 ratio (The speed of the motor was the same as the wheel axis) with an idler gear in the middle but this didn't seem like the most efficient way to organize it.
EngineeringStudents,3art5l,kalphakomega,6,Tue Jun 23 00:10:21 2015 UTC,"This is all over the place. You mention computer architecture, energy, and embedded systems. These are all very different areas of EE and regardless of what you want to study, if you get accepted you will likely have to take several matriculation courses since you don't have an EE undergrad degree. You are going to have a really tough time writing a research statement if you can't even focus on a specific field so I'd say work on that first.  As for projects, you will need to focus on theory before you do anything practical and even the most basic practical circuits you could study (BJTs, FETs, comm ICs [PLLs, FM/AM modulators], etc.) will require at the bare minimum a power supply, signal generator, and oscilloscope so this isn't really practical."
EngineeringStudents,3art5l,shitstep,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:53:47 2015 UTC,"I understand I'd need to take matriculation courses, I'm mainly talking about skills I could be learning in the mean time. For instance I know mechanical engineers use CAD software alot, is there any equivalent software in EE? That is something I feel I could at least become familiar with now.  As far as a power supply, I have some old ATX computer power supply units. I know it only has 5 and 12 volt lines so unless I get a transformer I would be limited to those ratings.  As for an oscilloscope, I was actually thinking about building one out of an old CRT TV. And I found some simple schematics on signal generators using a 555 timer chip.   I have a the strong physics background already, and I really rocked EM and Quantum. My main goal now I guess then is to narrow down the possible specialties I'd like to get into before working on applications, and mainly I'm worried about not being competitive with other EE undergrads applying into the program."

Get your ME and go get a masters in CE/EE. In my opinion a CS degree isn't worth it 90% of the time. I have a few buddies who are anywhere from biochem to ChemE majors working as programmers for big name companies in New York and silicon valley. All you need for a programming position is experience and knowledge of the languages which is relatively easy to learn. A minor in CS is about the most I'd recommend for it honestly."

To me it sounds more like you dont know what you want to do when you graduate and for that I'd say ME is the way to go, since it gives you the most options. If you dont like circuits EE and CE probably wouldn't be for you. And as for the computer thing. I'm an ME major interning at a computer company (big one, think Dell, HP, Lenovo) in their materials science lab. So its applying my ME knowledge to computers.  TL;DR MEs do more than cars and robots  Edit: feel free to PM me if you have any questions about my internship"

Engineering physics at UBC is actually that tough.   Most Canadian schools have greater workloads than what I've seen from American schools (with respect to the # of hours of lecture/labs/tutorials). For most regular engineering programs, you're going to have 30+ hours easily. The highest my program goes to is approx. 34 hours in the upper years."
EngineeringStudents,3aoznf,qubat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did EngPhys at Queens and had similar courseloads throughout. When you're taking 7 physics / engineering courses, a lab course, and also some electives in each semester, you can easily hit 40+ hours per week. One year the lab course itself was 9-12 hours a week - you were given a pile of equipment, a gigantic pile of manuals, and asked to assemble an experiment to determine some fundamental value or whatever... it was nuts."
EngineeringStudents,3aoznf,salierniwasokay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:27:54 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely nuts. This kind of course load looks pretty common amongst engineering physics programs (at least in Canada).   I guess it must be rewarding in a (almost masochistic) way. Looking back on it, are you glad you did eng phys?   Also, just out of curiosity, which upper year stream did you choose at Queens?"
EngineeringStudents,3aoznf,qubat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"I got my ass kicked in second year (transition from general first year to the insanity of EngPhys was tough) but then pulled out a pretty nice GPA by buckling down in my upper years. I think I learned some valuable time management skills and I got really good at quickly assimilating information. Also the math you get into for the high level physics is something that no one other than the applied math engineering people come near, not even electrical engineering people.  I think my advanced math skills served me pretty well in my masters, the math courses that they called graduate level for mechanical engineering were just review of things I had learned in 2nd or 3rd year... but I the math and physics came at a cost: severely less emphasis on design during the degree and the heavy courseloads precluded anyone other than people with impeccable time management from getting involved in design clubs (which are key for getting jobs if you don't do an internship, and are where most students actually learn the most about real design).   Given my current career trajectory, if I had to go back to high school and choose a thing over again, I'd go into business / commerce. If I had to do engineering, I'd do mechanical engineering instead of EngPhys and I would join the solar car team and try really hard to get an executive design position on that team for my junior and senior years. That would have been a better use of my time in terms of relative resume strength with the same amount of time working in undergrad.  Don't know what you mean by upper year stream, I did the mechanical option and then with my tech-elecs took mostly courses related to fluids (cfd, fluids 3, compressible, aerospace eng) and bioengineering (an into bio eng course and a medical physics course), and then some other stuff like laser optics to fill in my physics requirements. It all worked out pretty well in terms of relevance to my masters work."

EngineeringStudents,3arsmq,likethevegetable,3,Tue Jun 23 03:31:27 2015 UTC,"You can certainly do both. I worked as an NSERC summer researcher (and still have plans on pursing graduate studies) and was a member of the FSAE Electric team (I'm an EE). I attended the competition the same summer in Lincoln NB, it was a blast! I think both experiences played a big part in landing me the job I wanted after graduation.  The key is balance. SAE can consume a lot of your time, but only if you let it. You have to be comfortable with saying no to work that you think will interfere with your academics. I learned a lot of valuable lessons on teamwork, practical engineering, and management and made a lot of friends along the way.  I say do both and see what you like, broaden your horizons, and try to see value in what each has to offer."

EngineeringStudents,3arsmq,EngineerEddy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:27:13 2015 UTC,"Ahh, my apologies for not carefully reading your post.  I still think you should give it a shot. As an undergrad I found it incredibly valuable to get a range of experiences. If you can get paid to to fulfill your desire for research, why not?   As for your worry of SAE wrecking your GPA... As an NSERC student you'll probably be okay. I'm assuming you have an excellent GPA because NSERC grants are highly competitive (my school required at least 4/4.5). You'll be busy, but you'll develop better time management and study skills. Personally, my GPA only went up as I progressed through school.  Good luck!"

EngineeringStudents,3astok,dixienormus933,2,Tue Jun 23 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"If you're asking if you'll transfer directly to being a Junior in ME, the answer is most probably no.   Your gen eds and electives will probably transfer. Some of your drafting classes may transfer as CAD or technical electives. If theres an overlap with Mechanical Engineering Technology at your county college, perhaps you'll get more out of it.  Most US engineering degrees follow a pattern:  1st Year: General Educations / Sciences   2nd Year: Department specific courses  3rd Year: Major specific courses  4th Year: Engineering Electives, Senior Design classes  So unless you've taken Calc I-III, Diff Eq, Statics & Dynamics, Chem I-II, Physics I-III, MATLAB, Circuits, etc... You will not transfer as an Engineering Junior.  If you transfer into a CA public school you may have a better chance of transferring credits.   My advice would be to take ME Technology classes before you transfer, as they'll probably be easier at county college. Make sure they'll transfer though."
EngineeringStudents,3astok,lrrlrr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:28:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I've taken a few calc and physics classes but I'm probably going to continue taking them along with the drafting classes

Seems to be the tougher of the two majors, people often claim it is more theoretical and therefore more grad school oriented, but at the end of the day, it won't matter, either one can get you to grad school.   But you say you want a to work. You'll probably be just as fine, but it might mean explaining your major to recruiters and describe how it is similar to MechE."

EngineeringStudents,3aq57p,peacecoast42,3,Mon Jun 22 18:21:34 2015 UTC,"Determining where it fails depends on who is observing and what your failure criteria is. You can say it fails at yield (when the curve goes from linear to nonlinear at that spike point) or when it fails completely at rupture. This plot is most likely A36 steel because the yield point is shown at 36 ksi, if your application does not permit any plastic deformation then you can take the yield point as failure. Different codes have different criterias ranging from around (.35-.6)Fy. Another thing to remember is that if you test a piece of A36 in the lab it will most likely yield at a much higher point."

EngineeringStudents,3arrzp,aa2114,3,Tue Jun 23 00:00:27 2015 UTC,"entropy measures change of internal energy lost of gained by the system, and tells you if a process is spontaneous(natural under the given conditions).  entropy is 0 for complete reversible cycles (each cycle has a number of steps, aka processes), not for the individual steps in the cycles. since it is a state function it only depends on the path taken (on the plot), once you complete a cycle it means you are back where you started; meaning you will integrate from some point P back to that point P: the integral is 0.  in nature all processes are irreversible because there is always some energy lost; so you can never go back to the initial state of things.  reversible processes are assumed to be quasi-static(infinitely slow) which allows us to graph them on a P vs V plot, they can be:  -isovolumetric ( pressure held constant) W=P・(V2-V1); Q=m・Cp・dT; dE=dQ-dW  -isobaric ( volume held constant): W=0; dE=Q; Q=m・Cp・dT  -adiabatic (cutting from one isotherm to another): W=P・dV= -dE ;Q=0;  P1・V1γ=P2・V2γ ; (γ=gamma=Cp/Cv; either 5/3, 7/5, or 9/7 depending on the state of the gas)  entropy dS= dQ/T; if this specific process goes from T1 to T2 you will have to write dQ= m・c・dT such that dS=((m・c)/T)dT and integrate from T1 to T2 which will always give you ln(T2/T1)・m・c.  each of these steps are part of the carnot cycle, and each cause a change in entropy. These steps are derived from reversible processes and applied to irreversible processes, so it doesn't matter if you are applying the math to a theoretical process or a real one, the entropy change will be the same.  you problem says it undergoes a process between two fixed states, it never says it completes a full cycle; meaning that there is a change in temperature and most likely heat and work applied to get to that process.   the shape of the curve matters because it tells you what kind of process each step is.. and most likely shows you what isotherms each one goes from and to."

P=NP states it is always true that there is a way to shorten the time it takes to calculate a complex mathematical function.   That's what p=np is in laymens terms.

So, like if you imagine a PV diagram, and choose two points, you can draw a ""path"" that looks like anything and, if it is a state function, the value will always be the same. In other words, you know how work is area under the curve? Well because the shape of the line would affect the area under the curve, it means work will not always be the same when you try to connect the two points in different ways, so work is not a state function. Internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy should all be state functions as the way you get from point A to point B does not affect its value."

EngineeringStudents,3arrzp,WilboBaggins,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:18:13 2015 UTC,"Consider a system created from 10 ordinary coins.  The state of the system will be defined by the number of heads. If all 10 are heads the state is 10, if all 10 are tails then the state is 0.  The process by which the system changes will be flipping each of the 10 coins. Assume there is an exact probability of 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails.  For highly ""ordered"" states like all heads or all tails. There is exactly one way to achieve each of these. All of the coins must land heads or tails. The probability of this is (1/2)10 for either.  For a highly ""disordered"" state like 5 heads. There are multiple ways this could be achieved. The first 5 coins could land heads. The last 5 coins could land heads. Every other coin could land heads. Obviously, this means that the probability of having exactly 5 heads is much higher than having 10 heads. You can also see that in most cases of having exactly 5 heads the entire set of coins appears to be disordered. This is where the analogy between  entropy and disorder comes from.  Entropy is the number of ways you can achieve a state. In the system we've explored, the number of ways to achieve a state of 10 heads is exactly one. But the number of ways to achieve a state of 5 heads is much more than one. So naturally as perform the process by flipping the coins over and over again we will get a state with high entropy, 5 heads, more often than a state with low entropy, 10 heads."

EngineeringStudents,3aqk3o,Sup6969,2,Mon Jun 22 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"Usually to go direct to a PhD program you have to be exceptional.  Although I guess that is going to be somewhat school dependent.  The benefit of getting a MS first is that if you do well it will increase your chances at a possibly better school than otherwise.  You will also get a chance to see if this is what you want to do by doing a thesis instead of jumping directly to a dissertation, taking more advanced courses, spending time with professors and researchers.  You may find that you aren't so sure you like research or grad school as it is very different from undergrad.  On the other hand, funding for MS students is generally lower than that for a PhD.  And I don't see much value in specifically having a MS AND PhD once you have the PhD.    If you are truly 100% confident you are willing to commit to years of repeated attempts at original research and have the academic credentials to go straight to a PhD then it is the best choice.  If there is doubt then MS is best."
EngineeringStudents,3aqk3o,Lattice_Bowel_Mvmnts,2,Mon Jun 22 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"One issue might be that PhD funding/grant/scholarship applications will look weak compared to those that have a master degree, due to a lack of publications. In the applications I've seen, the publications section is the primary decision metric.   Another is that you might decide in year 2 that you don't actually like academia, and it would be insufferable to carry on for another 3-4 years. A master degree is a good trial of research and academia, before making the bigger committment"
EngineeringStudents,3aqk3o,civeng12,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean doing a separate master's program (or a BS-MS), then a separate PhD, rather than a ""master's en route"" as part of a PhD program.  I don't know what it's like for ChemE, but I can give observations from my field (MSE), which is probably similar.  The only real advantage I can think of is that if you do way better in your MS program than your BS, you might be able to get into better programs for the PhD. But you're probably only going to have 1 year or so on your master's transcript before you have to start applying. You also probably won't have to take as many classes in the PhD program, but overall you'll end up taking more. And of course, it will take longer. From my observations, starting with a master's degree (some international students do, if their BS is from a foreign university), doesn't significantly shorten the time to get a PhD.   When you're first starting out with a new project in an unfamiliar lab, it can be difficult to really make a lot of progress in research especially if you're taking classes at the same time. Combine that with the time it can take to get an article through peer review, and you may not even be able to get a publication out of your MS research before you have to apply to the PhD program. It took me about 2 years to get my first one as a PhD student.  Some programs don't actually offer terminal (not continuing on to a PhD) thesis-based master's degrees. They'd rather have PhD students. And many that do offer it will discourage it. Our DGP told us that for MS applicants, she'll frequently contact them to ask if a PhD is their end goal, and if so, suggest they just apply for that. It can be harder to get funding. Our department only has a handful (<5) of thesis-based master's students. I think most are people who got their BS here."

EngineeringStudents,3ao4nd,Joskilatrix,19,Mon Jun 22 02:53:31 2015 UTC,"I took off two semesters after being assaulted and having residual anxiety and depression that still persists today. I didn't leave right away though, couldn't function at all, and ended up failing / being on academic probation for the semester I tried to stick out (I got a 1.8 when I'm usually around a 3.2). I knew I had to leave then. It pushed my graduation off by a year, but I could finally work on the problems I was having and not have additional stress. It has done me wonders.   I am now graduated and have a good job. Taking a semester off is a personal decision, but I'd definitely consider the pros and cons.    I would have been kicked out due to poor grades if I tried to stick it out before working out some sort of regiment to control my problems, honestly. And I'm thankful I did and got the help I needed."
EngineeringStudents,3ao4nd,rockyosockz,5,Mon Jun 22 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"Just to ask, if I may. What did you during that time? Did you work or just work on yourself, or what? I'm genuinely curious because this is something my girlfriend has been talking about doing (she has bad anxiety and depression)."
EngineeringStudents,3ao4nd,Alexandurr,5,Mon Jun 22 04:43:21 2015 UTC,"I worked at a computer store part time (around 15-20 hours) to make some money for rent, was in therapy 1-2 times a week, and spent my extra time learning things I failed (like material science) and working through the severe depression that plagued me. I liked the low stress of stocking shelves and it gave me time to not interact with people, but it was a loose enough job I could call out if I was having an episode, and my boss was very understanding since I let him know from the start I was having severe issues. My friends weren't terribly far away, so one would come to my apartment and make sure I was eating. Usually I'd have a wellness call in from my psych as well."
EngineeringStudents,3ao4nd,rockyosockz,3,Mon Jun 22 10:50:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's pretty nice actually. I can definitely see how that could help. I have some problems but for now nothing as severe as that. But it's very likely my girlfriend will need to look into this.  Do you have any advice for people who may need to take this route?"
EngineeringStudents,3ao4nd,Alexandurr,5,Mon Jun 22 12:49:05 2015 UTC,"biggest advice is probably talk to the Dean of your class year, or your academic dean, so you can plan out if/when you return. They can walk you through the process of going on a leave of absence, and usually are helpful.   Some other useful things...   Actually focus on getting the help you need via a professional rather than staying home hoping it'll help. This is your health, and it's serious. Make sure you treat it seriously.  Keep yourself busy. Plan out the days and stick as best as you can to that plan. Even if the plan is just go outside, sometimes that's all you can do, and do your best to actually go outside.  Work on things that are / were difficult, whether it's chemistry or calculus. Keep your mind sharp.  Count the little things! You talked to your psych today? Score. You went to work? Excellent. Small rewards, even stupid freaking stickers, can help.  Make sure someone besides your psych or your parents know what you're going through and can check in sometimes. Plan to either go out with them, or have them just ask how you're doing.  Prepare to get ready to go back to school, if you're going to definitely do that. Have a desk to work at, paper/pens, and look at the course catalog. Don't drop off the face of the earth, or you might not return. Keep in contact with the dean and your academic adviser."

It was against the advice of many, many people in my life. My parents, my friends, my advisors..  My only regret is not having taken it sooner. I kept telling myself that I was going to ""man up"" and ""stop whining"" which led me into a spiral of bad grades and general depression.  Now, I agree that what people said to me was right - it was my fault, I should have done better, worked harder, etc. But now I'm back in school after spending two years just doing what I felt was right for myself, and it's a world of difference. Of course, there were costs (all my friends graduated, I gave up my positions in organizations and residential life), but it was worth it. In the end, I think it's all up to what you think would be best for yourself.  Feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk or ask about anything. :)"

EngineeringStudents,3ao4nd,RaigonZelo,2,Mon Jun 22 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to have someone who supported me - even though my father was to the point of kicking me out, my sister was willing to take me in and let me stay with her for a few months. So I moved the 1500 miles away from home, and put almost everything on pause. The distance alone helped to separate myself from others, which really helped put aside the guilt that I was disappointing people. My closest friends kept in contact anyways, it was really nice being able to open up to them.  What I told myself was that this was my second chance; in a year I was going to go back and prove to everyone (and myself) that I deserved a restart. I must admit, the beginning was terribly rocky. I would sleep in a lot, be irritable, not want to do anything.  But the big change for me was when I decided to become ""selfish"" - to stop thinking about how I 'should' have performed in the past and what I 'should' be doing now, and just ask myself what I really 'want' to do, and where I want to go in life.   Sorry if that's a bit cliched, haha. And I haven't graduated yet, so I don't want to sound like everything worked out and life is great. But I think I'm definitely in a better place than before I took that break."

If set you back a semester saves you further mental anguish and if your doctor seems concerned then taking one class is fine. Your self worth as a a human being and future productive member of society will not be predicated on when you graduated and if you have a W that is latter made up do to mental health problems. Your psyche is a very important part of you. Heck maybe do a co-op for a semester and get a better idea of why you are doing school or just to give yourself a break. Your life's journey does not consist of ""and he graduated at 22 like a good boy and got a 9-5 job"". I'm going back to school for a second degree I'm engineering so a semester is ok. Keep yourself taken care of cause you do yourself no favors coming out of this with a mental health illness or a sever sleeping disorder. Keep positive and don't beat yourself up, your the best rock star you know."
EngineeringStudents,3ao4nd,rswsaw22,2,Mon Jun 22 05:27:30 2015 UTC,"I'll lead in with saying that I think taking a full semester off is dangerous. It has potential to build complacence and that can be detrimental to furthering your education towards your goal. I'm not saying ""suck it up"" or ""be a man"", but weigh it out. School is hard and demands a lot of our mental fortitude. Be mindful of your work load. Finishing a semester later isn't as bad as letting your grades fall or having stress bring you beyond your breaking point. Take it one step at a time and if all else fails take the semester(s) you need to get yourself balanced. I hope this helps in some way. I wish sleep for you. Good luck."

I changed my viewpoint from NEEDING school to get a job to actually realizing that I need to get as much out of it as possible to get a life. Made my drive stronger. I can't speak for your situation, just telling you mine. I've only had procrastination and laziness attributing to my weak course record in the beginning, so it's all on me.

Also, having a job and making a difference in the future shouldn't be mutually exclusive. You might find a company that shares your vision on making people's lives easier; I know several people in my major (BME) that feel this way.

Where I'm at, the ECE program is around 20% ladies (my rough estimate, not an official statistic), and more of them are CpE than EE.  I want to support students who are struggling for whatever reason. I believe that most people could really understand the material and do well, if it's explained at their pace and in a way that will fit their understanding.  I feel like my passion isn't as much to do the work that's in my field of study, as much as it is to increase support for it.

Ironically, we are often in a better position to make a real difference in the lives of people around us than, say, a history major.   Any ideas why?

Our Engineering Club just organizes fun nights mostly, but I think it could have some kind of subcommittee for doing charitable things. My current ideas are mostly around software / computer engineering as that's most of what the students here do.

And comment structure is bad in lots of cases. An argument on reddit starts with a root post and then springs lots of child comments - but they're isolated even though they might make more sense if you could show the connections between them directly.

I have great marks and I'm almost done but I just don't see myself as an engineer. The problem is no other major interests me other than maybe History, but there's no job market in that field. It feels kinda shitty."
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,JohnnyJenks,11,Sun Jun 21 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"Hey man I have a similar situation. I'm starting Civil next year because it interests me, the market/pay is good and the international possibilities, but history is my real ""passion"". Other than teacher it doesn't get you a job though, so I'll keep it as a hobby."
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,Wakiem_,7,Sun Jun 21 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"History in of itself may not present many obvious career paths but it is one of the great jumping off degrees for a huge range of careers i.e. law, journalism, public relations, technical writing, fund-raising, administration, domestic and foreign government service, research. You don't have to be a historian, like many degrees on the arts end of the spectrum it shows that you have very acute critical thinking skills, a trait that is fairly desired."

Maybe I should have added that all the options it presents don't really interest me. I'm just a fan of history itself."
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,Wakiem_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:21:35 2015 UTC,"Me too, did a couple history units in my first degree and loved em, was always such a science kid through school I never really gave it a look, now after a long night doing math I love lying in bed and listening to some dan carlin hardcore history (give him a listen if you haven't already). I only mentioned that about the history options as I used to think the same thing and recently saw some thing come across my FB that listed the top ten degrees by average first yr salary and history was 3rd or 4th (not claiming it's true as it was just some crap on FB), so I was curious and googled career paths in history and didn't realise it was so diverse. Got me reading quite a few articles about the intangible value of arts degrees and some really compelling arguments, I'm not American but here in Australia we hear the same arguments about more STEM more STEM, but when you look at some of the great innovators of our time even within the fields of CS, Eng etc. a lot have a liberal arts background, that critical analysis stuff is really underated"
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,likea40degreeday,7,Mon Jun 22 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"Why do you say you don't see yourself as an engineer? Have you had work experience yet?  To be honest, it seems to me the engineering school experience and the engineering work experience are completely different. School's a lot of math and analytics, whereas work (from what I've seen) is mainly coordinating details to make sure things fit together and work right."
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,LaughLax,4,Sun Jun 21 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any work experience in my field yet so it definitely is a bit premature to say that I don't see myself as an engineer. The reason why I said that was because my classes bore me to death and most of the people I know from my program are working 9-5 desk jobs as programmers, which doesn't sound appealing to me at all.   Engineering school really is a grind like you said so perhaps I'm just feeling especially jaded. However the whole startup scene sounds exciting to me and the skills I've gained so far in school will be useful if I go down that path, so it's not all that bad."
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,JohnnyJenks,3,Mon Jun 22 00:12:59 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way pretty much. A lot of engineering jobs, to me, sound really boring and demotivating. A lot of it is optimizing something to make some guy more money that doesn't care about you.   In school, there's less worry about what something costs, it's more about the value it provides in improving human lives. I think the difference there is enough to make me question what I'm doing and where I'm going.   I like EE, but there's plenty of days where I think I might be better off just staying home and learning to write better code. More and more, I get the feeling that I'd have been better off in computer science. Topics in that field tend to come more naturally to me than the incorporation of the natural sciences in EE. EE is nice, because it is so broad, hence my reason in choosing it. In the end, though, when I think about the life I want to live, and what kind of jobs I prefer, I tend to believe i may have had a better (and maybe easier) time as a CS and came out with just as good of a job I have now (Hell, maybe even better paying considering how hot software is). I think the elitists in engineering had tricked me into believing that because my degree had the word ""engineering"" in it that it was automatically more prestigious and arbitrarily ""better.""   More and more, I realize how childish it was to believe that ME's can do the jobs of EE's, and EE's can do the job of CS' and yadda yadda yadda.  If that were the case, the reason for a separation in the disciplines wouldn't exist in the first place. I think the prestige of an engineering degree is a bit overblown--I get the feeling that more people are getting them because they believe they'll be granted some special privileges not granted to them by other majors, not because they actually want to be engineers. In the end, you just go for what you like and say screw what anyone has to say about that.   Anyway, I'm rambling, this is more of a rant than an opinion at this point. I don't regret pursuing EE, though, I do enjoy a lot of it. I just think I should have pursued Comp Sci and went for it, despite my parent's odd notions of it being a ""bad field"" to get into (because, you know, outsourcing, even though there's no way to stop that anyways)."
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,GarbageAccount012,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:02:00 2015 UTC,"Damn dude Ive been wavering and feeling like this as well... granted Im a computer engineering major so Im closer to learning software but honestly Ive been learning computer hardware for the most part and digital stuff.   The only 2 pure computer science courses Ive taken were the only ones Ive really liked so it shouldve been an indication for me to switch but I too was tempted by the whole ""engineer"" status.... faack =/  Edit- But to add on for my personal feelings. I came from a liberal arts heavy h.s. and I grew a good deal of interest in philosophy and studies regarding race in society but I felt that these wouldnt help much for a career.... sigh  Im graduating next spring so fuck it Im nearly done."
EngineeringStudents,3ammua,bkzhotsauc3,2,Mon Jun 22 12:21:24 2015 UTC,"Haha, heard that. I'm the same way. I took operating systems last year, and now I have a job where I'm part of a team that basically develops them. It was a hard f*cking class, but hey, I enjoyed the heck out of it. Some of the stuff in there blew my mind, and I think it was because I had an amazing professor that actually explained the deeper OS concepts quite well. I honestly can't say the same for EE. To me, it's incredibly stressful to sit through EE courses that are taught so bad that I don't learn anything in them, and have other courses in the CS department where I feel like I'm building new stuff everyday. It just seems to be a lot more results oriented, to me. They make you build projects from day one. In EE, there's so many pre-requisites that you don't start until year 3 or 4 at my school. That really bugs me. In CS, while there's plenty of bad students and professors, I just feel more 'at home.' The questions I need answered? Oh, no worries, I can google pretty much EVERYTHING i need to know before even needing to email a prof. While this is a good and bad thing, I've come to the conclusion that it's really positive. I love the fact that there's all the information you need on the net to get going with building good software. Open source is alive and well, so getting into big projects only requires time and effort. I feel like it's one of the few jobs that still ""gives back whatever you put into it.""   For me, I realize more and more that this is something I should be pursuing, because it's an awesome work environment. I've realized that if I am on a good team of people that I get along with, coding isn't bad at all. I like being able to think on my own, and still have the ability to contribute to something larger. There's other engineering disciplines that I'm sure require much more face-to-face contact. Naturally, I'm more of an introvert. I prefer talking for a few minutes, then going back to my desk and pounding my head over the problem for the rest of my day.   Like you, though, I am only finding this out late in the game. I think in the back of my mind I've always enjoyed Comp Sci, but I've always been too stubborn to admit it, and I let some my engineering friends convince me (with really arbitrary and loopy reasoning) to go with EE instead. I'll still be slogging through it, though, because there's plenty of CSCI-relevant knowledge in the degree, anyway (i.e. I can still feasibly get highered as a Dev despite being an EE if I put in some extra time coding and pick the right classes).   I guess the take away from all of this for me is that the other obscure topics in EE, I'll likely not use. I think that they were fun to learn for academic purposes, but in terms of my career, there's plenty that I don't think I really care about continuing to learn about or practice in the long run. The only reason it's bugged me, is because it's more my parents that nag me about ""making sure you use your degree."" Lately, I've realized that I will have no problem getting a good job, so I should just do what makes me happy, and say screw the whole ""using my degree.""   TL;DR If you like what you do, nothing else matters haha."

I may have been better off doing Mechanical for what I want to do in the BME field; and failing that, my employment options would have been amazing elsewhere.   But on the other hand, I'm going to a school with a lot of respect, a highly-regarded BMEN department, and a huge alumni network; and Texas is one of the leading states for Biomedical jobs.

However, I just found out they changed the requirements to get licensed as a civil, you don't even need to study under civil, you can study under a contractor.  IMO this degrades the civil license to the point of worthlessness, and I wish I didn't waste the time and money to go to school if that was the case.

EngineeringStudents,3ammua,surrender52,2,Mon Jun 22 02:36:06 2015 UTC,"My major is Materials  I wish I had pursued a mechanical or electrical engineering major instead, with a minor in materials.  Materials, especially at the undergraduate level, is too theoretical for many jobs (crystal structures with atoms in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, diffusion of atoms, Frank-Read dislocation sources???), and sometimes not theoretical enough for a hard science. In my opinion they should separate Materials Science and Materials Engineering into separate majors (or at least into different focuses or tracks).   In the real world, if you aren't in research and development (which you probably would need a PhD or at least thesis Masters) you probably only need cursory knowledge of such hard science in materials. Much more important is design considerations, materials selection, materials processing, process selection, process optimization, etc..   Also, what many people don't know is that while pretty much any kind of engineering company needs materials engineers, with exception to materials producers (polymers/adhesives companies, metals companies like Alcoa or Nucor) they only need a few (compared to the huge masses of MEs or EEs they hire). So while yes, you can theoretically go to anywhere from consumer goods, to a chemical plant, to oil and gas, to a nuclear plant, to aerospace, to automotive. The reality is that your being hired is heavily dependent on their specific need to hire a materials engineer the year you are graduating (or looking for an internship). Often if there is no opening (which usually comes from retirement or expansion), then you have no shot.  Lastly I have seen firsthand (from my fulltime colleagues at my internships) that materials engineers are often ""typecasted"" into their role, aka the company doesn't want you to move around (to say another engineering role, or even a business/management role). So since materials engineers make up such a small slice of the pie in terms of skilled/educated workers at most engineering companies, it's much harder to move around, while a ME could go from say, manufacturing to product devlelopment to design to process improvement to CFD specialist to Matlab specialist, a materials engineer usually stays witihin 1 or 2 departments.  TL;DR: Materials Engineering, at least the way it's taught under ABET accredation, is too focused on science for those who want to go into industry, and furthermore there is limited need for them in most companies. Go electrical or mechanical (or computer engineering/science if you wanna go way out there) for more flexibility."

I graduated with a 3.0 and I know that I could have done much better.  Keeping up with my classmates was tough considering that they had 40 more hours per week than I did to spend on their classwork/studying.  I'm glad that you're planning on not working full-time when you're fully enrolled.    In terms of your schedule:  If you think you can knock those classes out of the park with A's in all of them, then do it.  If you even get the inkling that you're going to struggle, drop work and focus on school.  You're going to school to invest in your future and you should put all of your focus into that investment ASAP.  These pre-req classes should give you a solid foundation for later classes, but they should also give you a solid foundation for your GPA.  Plus, I'm assuming that since you need to take these pre-reqs you're banking on these classes getting you into your school of choice.  I was in a similar situation.  I had been out of high-school for ten years before I went back to school.  My University told me, ""We'll accept you if you take Calc I and Physics I and can show us that you're ready.""  So I did.  Got two A's and they accepted me.  You want to be in the position of having all A's so you can say to them, ""No reason not to take me now,"" instead of giving them even a hint of an excuse.

EngineeringStudents,3amoxj,randomguy3167,10,Sun Jun 21 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"To the the medical school question: no. Do not go to medical school unless you really want to work as a clinician. I was asked this question a lot when I interviewed for med school this past year. If you're interested in an MD/PhD, you could look into that, but I've been told that, if one wants to spend his/her life in research, they should just go for the PhD and leave out the MD. If the clinical aspect is a real interest though (and research is only a side interest) for you, it's definitely viable to go to med school after your masters. As a physician with an engineering background, you'd definitely be an asset.  I think a masters' in ECE would definitely be helpful-- I know people who have gone that route (or vice versa with ECE/BME). However, from what I know, a lot of that work is in the research stages so you might need to go beyond a masters to really get involved. I know there are also several BME programs (USC comes to mind) that are focused on neural engineering/ECE applications of BME.  Edit: I'd look up the program requirements for an ECE masters. You might have to take some prereqs/make your degree relevant, but I think it's very doable. In addition, masters' programs usually have more room to ""customize"" your courses to fit your interests so I wouldn't worry too much about the discrepancy between the two majors."
EngineeringStudents,3amoxj,defyingsanity,2,Sun Jun 21 20:36:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wish my school had an neural engineering program. I now know that there are other schools that do. I don't think there should be an issue in terms of prerequisites as from what it seems all you need to have his graduate standing to take the courses at my school. You can read further in my comment to milkchococurry. I know the requirements, so basically I'm just trying to see what people's advice is on whether it's worth it haha.   How did it go for those people that got a BME BS first and then an ECE MS? Did it help them land a better job? Also, was the MS sufficient in helping them be more successful in the workforce, actually designing devices, in a way that just a BME would not be able to?"
EngineeringStudents,3amoxj,defyingsanity,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"My sample size is literally 3 people. Two of them are now in BME PhD programs to do more neural engineering stuff and the other did do some neural engineering work with a startup but has now left to go work for either Epic or MathWorks because he wasn't finding any other non-research neural engineering work (idk what happened with the startup). Most neural engineering folks that I know either are getting PhDs in the field or just used neural engineering as a stepping stone for a job at Genentech, Abbott, Baxter, J&J, etc.  That's probably not what you wanted to hear, but I've heard of very few neural engineering jobs outside of research. I would imagine that there are startups that pop up, but I haven't any data about their longevity or what they actually work on."
EngineeringStudents,3amoxj,defyingsanity,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:55:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm yeah, that is definitely an issue at this point. I have heard of a few companies. Battelle is actually a big company working on a neural interface with their Neurobridge project. I don't know too many others.   So these people that went on to other companies had no trouble with ""actually making devices"" with just an MS in ECE? I'm not really talking about neural engineering specifically here. I'm basically just trying to see if getting an MS in ECE remedies the issue of the lack of expertise as a BME."
EngineeringStudents,3amoxj,defyingsanity,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:22:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of them had problems ""actually making"" things.

EngineeringStudents,3amoxj,zebrastripe665,6,Tue Jun 23 02:10:06 2015 UTC,"First off, you're gunning for the same kind of stuff I'm gunning for (broadly neural engineering, specifically a blend of neural interfacing/rehab as well as neural generation/sketchy stem cell stuff) and your double major plan sound badass. We should be friends haha.  Take my advice with a grain of salt because I'm a rising junior who basically just lucked my way into a neurosci/neural engineering lab on campus recently (I'm doing some of the computational bio aspects of it because I volunteered for it, I actually have a good knowledge base of the programming language in question (Python), and the lab isn't set up yet), but I'm actually thinking about an ECE minor before graduate school, and at the risk of your sanity and money, I'd suggest the same. The reason on my end is that BME at my school ordinarily takes so much time to finish because of the long prerequisite chains and the...unfavorable scheduling my school provides. I'm actually on track to graduate in 4 years, but with an EE minor, I'd be more qualified to take on some of the neural engineering concepts and challenges while adding on another year's worth of work (and expensive CA tuition money) before heading to graduate school. Not only that, I have to wrestle with other potential choices for supplementing my BME degree, such as minoring in CS or even getting a BA in CS (which would make my CS parents very happy).   There's also the idea of just taking some EE classes that you think will help in the long run instead of getting a major or minor. Personally, I think that straight jumping from BME to another engineering major for a MS is risky because of the number of courses that we lack compared to someone with a BS in EE. Now with that said, its not like you can't do this. Coincidentally (based on what day it is today), my father is a great example, albeit slightly different circumstances. Back in the 80's, he was an international student in the US getting his MS in CivE from a small school. He wasn't sure if he was gonna get a job in the civil industry here, so he took some intro CS classes on the side. Lo and behold, civil companies in the US wouldn't take people with certain visas, one of which he had, even with his internship experience and annoyingly great grades. So he hit his fallback option and parlayed the above things he had done into a MS in CS. He's had a very successful CS career since. Something else to take from his experience is that if the graduate school lets you take additional ECE courses on top of what you already have, then I don't see why not.  And as you pointed out earlier, I hate how the BME degree is broad in the bad way so that a BS doesn't qualify us for 'engineering' because we don't know enough. Grad school and medical school are both good options, but if you're more willing to work on the engineering and research than just the biology, I'd advise graduate school over medical school. Now I'm not too aware on what medical school offers (it's not a goal of mine, but I probably should consider it), but imo the goal there is to make you into a physician or doctor, not necessarily a researcher or engineer. And you can probably benefit from it, but in terms of time and cost, it doesn't sound economical.  I realize that everything above is quite the ramble of many different thoughts and ideas, and if anything is unclear, I apologize. I'm a week into summer and I already have shit to do, so I'm not too keen on expending brain power at the moment haha.  At the end of the day, it's all your choice. An engineering degree is an engineering degree one way or another (my biochem cousin who works at Genentech assuaged my fears on this being useless earlier in the year), so don't let that hinder you. And even so, a degree doesn't stop us from learning. It's all about experience and willingness, and I can tell you at least have the willingness.  If you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help, and good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3amoxj,razalath,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks, it's great to see there's more people like me! I really do hate that the BME degree is so broad too. Maybe in the future it can separate into more specialized majors like ""Tissue Engineering"" and ""Neural Engineering,"" etc.  I actually just got into a neural engineering lab too, helping a grad student with his project. Hopefully, I can continue with them into the future. I'm on track to graduate in four years too, but only because I had a good amount of credits coming plus summer classes. Unfortunately, my school doesn't have an ECE minor so I couldn't do that.   I did consider just doing a bunch of ECE and neuro courses as sort of my own DIY ""Neural Engineering major."" Unfortunately, it still fell short of counting as a double major. I asked my advisor what she thought and she said she didn't recommend it since it wouldn't technically count as a degree and there was no way to make it into one. (I go to a really big school that allows you to even create your own major, but apparently, it's only for the college of arts and sciences.) I figured this was the next best thing, and at least, employers will see it. Clearly, I am also very interested in the subject matter.  I mean, I could just say screw it and go for the ""DIY degree,"" but normally you have to have the advisor schedule you into the major's intro class for engineering once you get in, at least definitely for BME. (We can schedule ourselves normally.) I assume this is true for ECE too, and unfortunately, these classes are prerequisites for further ones.   The good thing about the graduate degree is you don't have to worry about any of that, since all you need is to have graduate standing. I also feel like some of the graduate courses are just somewhat more advanced repeats, at least somewhat, of the undergraduate ones from my look into the classes. (Not to say that there aren't many advanced classes too.) I guess it's relevant to mention that we do have a BS/MS program at our school that lets you basically get your masters in one year by double counting some credits. You're allowed to take graduate classes and even required to take one graduate class for BME. I just wasn't sure if this would be a solid enough basis of ECE or not.  As far as medical school, I guess I'm trying to create my own niche that is currently not filled by PhDs. I think the medical expertise could be beneficial, as companies usually do consult with doctors for neuro-rehabilitative stuff. Also, it might be nice to see patients on the side and work with them to make these devices. But I don't know. I'm just considering it at this point and weighing my options. My parents are actually willing to help me pay for medical school. So, money aside, do you think it would be worth it? If you have any further advice I'd love to hear it and good luck to you too!"

Did graphic design, got a dead end job in a grocery store, then decided to return to school for mechanical engineering. So, a couple pieces of advice.  One, consider starting out at community college. It's a lot cheaper than any university, and you can get some prereqs, gen eds, etc. done there at the very least, I was able to get a full 2 year associate's degree. However, be sure to figure out what courses will transfer to your program.  Definitely consider a public university, they're a lot cheaper than privates ones. It seems like any university you go to will have its fair share of older students.  Fill out your FAFSA. Definitely. Also, try to find internships or something during the summer, they make you a lot more marketable."

EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,KnightOfAshes,3,Sun Jun 21 05:28:45 2015 UTC,I thought that intellectual property doesn't apply to US students
EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,firielazer,5,Sun Jun 21 05:37:47 2015 UTC,"That's my point. We don't get intellectual property, so why bother putting effort into a design I'd want to make money off of? I'd rather just build a competition robot."
EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,KnightOfAshes,2,Sun Jun 21 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"No, I mean as long as I can use the intellectual property for homework, why not totally pirate stuff? I can still patent homework and my designs are all automatically mine."
EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,firielazer,4,Sun Jun 21 05:43:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, that's absolutely not the case. In fact, at UT Arlington, one of the deans is actually pushing for students to finally have intellectual property over senior projects, which are currently IP of the school itself, and not the students. Same for the University of Houston. It's definitely a school-by-school thing."
EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,KnightOfAshes,3,Sun Jun 21 05:56:34 2015 UTC,"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107  I was more talking about this, but what your describing is sucky and possibly illegal.  http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/copyright-automatic.html  Whatever design I make in Revit is my intellectual property unless I drew from a different source that isn't transformative."
EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,firielazer,2,Sun Jun 21 06:06:54 2015 UTC,"Often this isn't the case. I know if i made a design in my student copy of Solidworks and tried to profited off of it, Dassault could sue. It's explicitly stated in their terms of agreement that if you wish to make money off of a design you must re purchase the software at full price and then fully replicate the design from scratch, otherwise it isn't your intellectual property, as the orginal software was for learning purposes.  And what he's describing isn't illegal. It's unfortunate but often the norm for most schools to consider your work their work, sort of the old ""you made this? I made this"" shtick. Same with using company resources for a company project. It blows, but schools are more a business than ever, and their happy to take whatever they can from us."

EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,firielazer,2,Sun Jun 21 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"That's true in general, but students are often forced to sign agreements that give all IP they generate while using school resources to the school. Some employers have similar agreements too, I believe.  At RPI, some students have gone as far as to avoid even thinking about their own ideas while on campus."

EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,firielazer,2,Sun Jun 21 19:48:52 2015 UTC,Strange I figured of all places in the world the US would love that their students have ownership of their own IP. Most Canadian universities ( with Waterloo being the best example) allow this to my knowledge.
EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,Zephyr104,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  At my school it belongs to the student,  professors will even have us redact reports if needed.  (unless you sign paper work,  and thats usually only if you want the school to pay for your patent,  so they in turn want some ownership)"
EngineeringStudents,3akl6g,424f42_424f42,2,Sun Jun 21 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it works at Arlington, but from what I can tell the honors research type projects stand to benefit the students the most. I have a friend whose project will be used as the basis for a graduate research project and they are getting published in an IEEE journal. Another friend in a similar project is working on their project with the professor after turning it in. The big benefit isn't IP, but networking and making waves--showing that you can accomplish great things."

The liberal arts school offers physics-engineering, and it sucks ass because not a single person has majored in it this year, also it's a really weak program. So from what I've observed, it's a paper-pencil, less hands on type of major that doesn't really appeal to employers like NASA/Boeing.. Mechanical, on the other hand, will be designing/building things for companies and actually testing the mathematic principals in your projects"
EngineeringStudents,3aogar,farrari121,2,Mon Jun 22 07:09:36 2015 UTC,"It's actually a solid major choice for doing more advanced work.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure how a new freshman would know that and be able to choose.  My PhD (in progress now) is Engineering Physics, with a subject that is obviously something that straddles mech, aero, math, physics, and there is significant interest by employers/labs in the title ""Engineering Physics"".  But, unless you are going on to graduate work that encompases more theoretical aspects of engineering I'm not sure it is a great idea.  You can always go into Engineering Physics at the graduate level after a more traditional engineering degree, but if you are going to stop at the BS level you aren't going to be doing work that is that advanced anyway, and employers will be more comfortable with the ME."

So expect systems of equations, summing forces, rotating members, etc.   I would review other coordinate systems such as polar coordinates you will appreciate using other coordinate systems for this class when it comes to rotations.   Dynamics is brutal if you don't buckle down and read your book, but if you did well in Statics you should do just fine."
EngineeringStudents,3amovq,TIISupernova,2,Sun Jun 21 19:25:41 2015 UTC,Use of polar coordinates!!! Also tangential coordinate systems if your uni likes that. Probably some basic derivations/integration - velocity is the derivative of position etc... so that could be handy.
EngineeringStudents,3amovq,ThexRuminator,2,Sun Jun 21 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"Understand what an integral is, don't stress about being able to integrate.  Understand how derivatives work in a spatial sense. position, velocity, acceleration.  everything from Physics 1, kinematics, f=ma. understand polar coordinates, its not hard, just look it over.  vectors, vectors, and more vectors.    other than that, just make sure you have a solid grasp of algebra, so many people struggle with this class because their algebra is sub par.   Honestly i found Dynamics to be pretty straight forward. if you are good at applying kinematics and can do a bit of algebra you will be fine."

I had a ""horrible/new"" physics teacher who thought she had to prove something. Calc 2  Make sure to do really well on the homework/quiz assignments. My teacher would assign us a lot of problems for ""homework"". He expected us to do them all, which I would highly recommend. Every other week he would give us a homework sheet with 6 or so problems on it, they were really difficult. Our tests were really tricky sometimes, there are so many curve balls they can throw at you.

EngineeringStudents,3am4sb,Conicoid,2,Sun Jun 21 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"One of the most important things you should be doing to understand the material is reading your book, especially before you transfer. Your education will definitely be your responsibility and not the prof's.     What has worked for me this past year has been just reading ahead of the class, coming to lecture and focusing on digesting the material rather than mindlessly jogging down what the prof. is saying, then i'll start practicing the material.   When it comes to homework, (speaking as someone who has held a 4.0 through these classes), what has worked best for me is to bust out my book and do practice problems until I get it, not until I finish the homework, but until the point where I can fully explain the problem to someone else.  Word of advice, get your hands on a solutions manual, it is one of the greatest learning tools you can acquire aside from the book itself. Be warned though, with great power comes great responsibility, abuse of a solutions manual is only shooting yourself in the foot.  I too stress out a lot about school, but just remember this is school, experience trumps grades in almost every case, so don't stress too much about getting a B in a class."
EngineeringStudents,3am4sb,TIISupernova,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:48:03 2015 UTC,"I took Calc II as an Honors course while I took Classical Physics I (aimed for scientists & engineers) at the same time. I was taking 6 classes total that term, and unfortunately those two at the same time made for a very difficult semester overall. I was able to finish Calc II with a B+ and get my Honors notation but I will say that it was the most difficult math class I had, probably due to the extra work load if I'm completely honest. Taking Different Equations after taking that was like a refreshing glass of lemonade.  Pay close attention to your Physics I course, because no only will Physics II build upon that, but when you take Engineering Statics and Dynamics you will be relying on a lot of what you learned in Physics I in order to solve the problems."

Anyways I plan on trying to work through the first few chapters of each. As far as why I didnt receive an A in my Calc 1 class was because I had a death in the family like a week and a half before my second exam so I wasn't super focused so didnt do well on it. What kind of sucks is that my calc and phy. classes are on the same days. PHY-MWF 10-10:50, Lab M 2-4:30. Calc- MW 6-7:40, but I do have tues and thurs off. I plan on spending as much time as possible at tutoring. As far as studying like structures does anyone have any good tips?

EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,janemfraser,7,Sat Jun 20 22:56:52 2015 UTC,"As a department chair, my standard response to any complaint from a student is to say that there are always at least two sides to a story. I then listen and ask questions in great detail so I clearly understand what the student says happened. If the complaint comes in email, I will usually ask for a meeting to clarify exactly what happened. Then I talk with the professor. So, if the chair follows my method, you will not get immediate satisfaction, but you should get a respectful listening to and a follow up in a week or so, maybe less. If you don't get those, escalate.   You could even guide the chair by saying that YOU realize there are always at least two sides to a story and that you would like the chair to listen and then talk to the professor.

It got so bad that more time was being taken up informing him how his ideas wouldn't work, or redoing his craftsmanship, than was being spent actually being constructive, and we just started not telling him when we were meeting.

EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,bak3ray,17,Sat Jun 20 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"Hello,   This is a throwaway account for a very good reason, I am a current international student in an American University for an Engineering degree. Yes, I am middle eastern.   Here is the thing, most of the idiots that you guys encounter I've seen personally do the same shit over and over and over again. I've reported that crap before and the problem was because I'm an international student like them I was treated like I was cheating on every fucking exam I took.   I eventually left that school for a good reason, because that school treated me like a thief and with utter disrespect.   Not all international students cheat, I work hard, I spend all my time during the term preparing and doing my own homework. I try to reach out to students if I am not exactly sure what I'm doing (I'm ADHD, dyslexic).   What I'm trying to say is there are those who work hard, and actually put the effort in doing their own work.   It hurts when locals treat me like shit just because I'm foreign, by the end of the day I'm here to learn, accomplish something that I always wanted to accomplish.   If it wasn't for the disability services in the University system I would not even be able to finish my education. and that is one of the reasons why the american university system is top notch."
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,Int_student,12,Sat Jun 20 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I think one of the reasons why it seems like people always point out international students is because in my experience they were a lot more bold in the ways they would cheat. Most American students I saw cheat would have extra notes or write equations on their arm or in their calculator. The international students would literally talk out loud during the test and try to act like they didn't speak English at all if they were called out on something when they spoke perfect English otherwise.   From your experience I can understand why you are upset but I don't think anyone means to imply that ALL international students cheat, or that Americans don't cheat at all. I'm sorry to hear they treated you poorly simply for being foreign, that isn't right at all and I hope you are around better people/in a better place now."
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,bak3ray,3,Sat Jun 20 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'm in a better place for sure, at least I'm not as depressed as I used to. My work actually account for something in this school, I still see the international students cheating. I would love to say something but I don't want to put myself in the same position I was in with the previous school.   I simply want to graduate and get on with my life. I'm sick and tired of having to suck up to professors that despise your presence."
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,Int_student,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, I actually did poorly in school the first time around because I didn't take it seriously. I left and went back when I was 25. A lot of my professors and classmates were assholes to students, but international students got a lot of unjustified hate in particular. One professor was actually foreign born and did it to international students, didnt really make much sense to me.   Luckily for me the support system in place (libraries, study labs, etc) was a lot better the 2nd time around and I met a few good people to study with so I managed to get through but it still sucked. A lot of the kids think they are entitled to be assholes simply because they're going to be an engineer, when in reality they don't really know much and are good at bullshitting people.   Don't let em discourage you, just get through it and get a job and then you will be able to do what makes you happy. Hopefully you won't ever have to worry about those kinds of people again."
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,bak3ray,3,Sat Jun 20 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"funny enough, i got back to school at 25 after a few breaks here and there. its good to know that I'm not the only one who stopped and went back at it.   I finished my first term back in spring, and it was exhausting. I have to study up the material I did a few years ago to actually get up to speed with the rest of my classes to come.   Btw, dota 2 is better than LoL. come to the dark side!"

I have no gripes with them personally as I understand the culture, what I have a problem with is them getting away with this sort of cheating especially on this sort of scale.   I know not all international students cheat, I think most students regardless of where they are from are honest students. Just this class has a very high percentage of international students and most of them are cheating because they are getting away with it."

Ones background does not matter, what matters is are you there to learn or are you there to fuck around. Sadly most of the students we are talking about are here to fuck around, hence why I do not interact with them at all. I do not even say hello to them, that should tell you how much I do not like interacting with them."

EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,rastanyan,13,Sat Jun 20 15:24:30 2015 UTC,Unforgiveable F/Kicked out of the University.   This is a major school. Good/high Tier engineering program as well as D1 sports.
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,xdavid00,7,Sat Jun 20 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"Well.... it waters down the name of the school if the cheating scandal is revealed. Not to mention the engineering profession itself. Best to deal with it internally in my opinion, and kick out the students that way it doesn't seem like the school knew of the cheating if/when the media starts asking questions. At least this way they can say they broke up a cheating ring and save their reputation."
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,_blackbird,3,Sat Jun 20 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"I would report this to the teacher then the Dean of academics (or whoever is over academic integrity) and if your school is as big as you say you could get this to blow up through the media if you cant get anywhere on campus.    I hate cheating, I hate cheaters and in engineering it can get people killed.  I don't want to work with people who cheated through their classes that could potentially put me in danger in an industrial situation."

EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,GoP-Demon,10,Sun Jun 21 07:39:17 2015 UTC,"International students don't tend to care about the consequences because in their schooling back home they are often encouraged to cheat by the teachers, or bribery is an accepted practice to pass a class.  My wife's teachers used to get the government official drunk so they could steal the exam questions the day before standardised testing. Then they'd spread the answers around to the students because their funding was directly related to the test scores.  Also my Chinese friends said their teachers encouraged the smart students to text answers to everyone else during the big exams."
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,Team_BBC,3,Sun Jun 21 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"Jesus, international students as in .. not north america or europe? or what sort of international?  I feel a little betrayed that schools would cheat their students of education in order for funding."
EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,qwicksilfer,4,Sat Jun 20 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"Indonesian, Chinese, and Indian students are the ones that are often cheating at my Uni. Rich Chinese students are notorious for paying other people to take their exams for them as well, I've heard this happens a lot for driving tests too.  My wife was an international student so she got to see the worst of this. Even her friends were not paying attention the whole first semester, but they would go to the lecturers with cookies and try to look cute (because that's what works back home). Of course the Australian lecturers just take the cookies and tell them to study.  Her Chinese friend offered her his ""guy"" that writes all of his assignments, he got some fail grades because the same ""guy"" was doing the exact same assignments for multiple students. Although as far as I know they didn't get expelled or anything, just failed the one course. Intentional students get a lot of protection because here they provide so much of the income for the University, and often have quite rich families as well."

Plus, My transcript is flawless so I would take the F, then my lawyer and I would inquire why the university cannot follow it's own academic standard in the face of indisputable evidence.  There is not only the Dean of the Department, there is the Dean of the Division, there is the VP/Pres of Instruction, there is the President of the University; then, there is any society the university get accreditation from, e.g. ABET.  Those organizations have a stake in academic integrity.

EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,shoottheotherdude,3,Sun Jun 21 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"I went to Northern Arizona University last semester, a school that has a very large population of Saudi Arabian students. The Saudi students were the most blatant cheaters I have ever seen. They would pass notes during the tests, leave the room every 30 minutes for long periods of time, etc. Some of them even had copies of the tests before they were given. It was magnified by the fact that 60% of my thermo class only showed up for the first day and the three tests, almost all of whom were Saudi. (There were multiple Saudis who did the work, so I'm not trying to generalize too much, but the large majority were cheaters).   A few of the professors at my school seemed to care, but most didn't. That meant that the students who truly studied and worked hard didn't appear to deserve it due to the high percentage of As and Bs in the class. That also led to virtually no curves being given.   The cheating is one of the main reasons I'm transferring away from that school. It was very distracting and took away from the experience."

EngineeringStudents,3aigwr,ThexRuminator,3,Sat Jun 20 22:27:07 2015 UTC,"Cheating, the antithesis of Engineering Ethics 101. During my undergrad, I saw it a lot with the frat guys, always in the blow-off classes like Thermo for non-believers. There, everyone just wants to pass and spend the least amount of money on weed-out classes.  Returning to school for Grad, it became the Middle Easterners, and the Indians. These were no longer blow-off classes, but important courses. I could very well be working with these kids some day. I could be working with people who have no work ethic, who blindly follow templates, and possibly get people killed.  I had a Real-Time Digital-Signal Class, and decided to have some 'fun'. I got stuck in a two-man, with the other being an Indian. He did no work, and constantly asked for me to send the most up-to-date code and reports to him. I suspected he was handing my reports and codes to the other students. I decided to start using LaTex for my lab reports.   Funny thing about LaTex PDFs and Word's OCR system: the letters 'i' and 'l' are frequently dropped, added or switched.  I also started adding fictitious entries/variables to my code.  End of the semester rolls around and we received an email from the professor regarding final grades.   I have been getting questions from many of you concerning your semester grades for the Real-Time DSP course.  Generally, those that got B’s in the course copied the code from someone else’s project either from this year or last.  Some people copied the entire project from another group.  I will be in my office from 2 to 4 on Monday if you want to discuss your grade then.   I refer you to the course syllabus:  ""...Discussion on lab experiments and final projects between groups is permitted, but each group should conduct the experiments and programming independently. If codes from two groups are found to be effectively identical, all members in both groups will receive zero as the grade. Other examples of cheating are     Submitting a report that the experiment or the write-up is not done by you.   ...      Copying paragraphs without putting them in quotation marks or citing the reference.""    MRW I saw the email  In the end, out of a class of 24, only 4 kids got 'A's, and a handful of students were kicked from the school for plaigirism, and a handful were kicked because it overflowed their 10  'C' credit maximum. From that class of 24, I'd estimate that 12 are still at the University."

EngineeringStudents,3akuav,Heidi423,2,Sun Jun 21 04:41:02 2015 UTC,"Depends what area of aerospace you want to go into.  If you're more interested in R&D side an aero degree will definitely give you a better understanding of aerodynamics and what not.  However,  structures and component design work can be done with a mechanical degree and basic understanding of aeronautics can be learned through tech electives and experience.   Also let's say you get your BS in one and an MS / doctorate in the other, companies will not pay alot of attention to what you majored in for your BS degree and focus more on what you specialized in for your higher level education.   Another thing I learned from talking to advisors (which I highly recommend you do,  although find an advisor that is actually helpful and nice) was that a good reason to do dual degree is if your GPA is on the low end: 1. Because it allows you more time to pull it up and 2. It gives a more positive spin to your academics which causes companies to more likely overlook your low GPA."
EngineeringStudents,3akuav,Chrystine,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:13:51 2015 UTC,"AE can get ME jobs.  I have one anecdotal example which may display how.  A coworker did AE, became an FEA specialist at a AE company, then got the current job doing Automotive FEA.  The important part is that he was a proven success with FEA and the fundamentals he got from school and work don't really change.  But, I don't think there is a need to break out AE at the undergrad level.  A BS just barely scratches the surface of what is out there.  Keeping it to the basics, allowing some electives near the end, is probably the best.  Then, if desired, specialize at the MS/PhD level with material you won't learn on the job.   I did physics undergrad, even more fundamental than ME, let alone AE, and I am very happy I did it as I hit the road running when it came to math oriented graduate courses, dissertation, and jobs in analysis."

You build a computer model of a part and apply loads to it to get a more accurate understanding of what will happen to the part under loading.   Someone who is a specialist would understand what the program is actually doing, which would allow them to pick the best elements (ELI5 the material that the program is using to construct the model) to converge to the real part."

EngineeringStudents,3akuav,LukeSkyWRx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"CFD is modelling fluid flow over some sort of surface (like an airfoil or the front of a car) in order to determine how the fluid will act when it flows over it. FEA is modelling stress, strain, and stuff like that on something when a load is added to it (like say a bridge with cars driving over it), in order to model how the bridge itself will bend, strain, etc. when the cars drive over it.  FEA is the thing you always see in those engineering promo videos with the blue, yellow, and red colouring like this.  Whereas you can see a visual example of CFD here."
EngineeringStudents,3akuav,Jorlung,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"Both of those look interesting, looks like Solidworks. Does it require lots of difficult, advanced math to do this? I haven't had diff eq yet but calc 1,2,3 are not easy for me."
EngineeringStudents,3akuav,Lattice_Bowel_Mvmnts,2,Sun Jun 21 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"CFD and most modeling are exclusively advanced math, CFD is all diff eq."
EngineeringStudents,3akuav,Jorlung,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't taken a course in CFD and FEA (both are 4th year electives in my school) but from my understanding its mostly MATLAB/scripting and math.   I can't comment much on FEA because I really don't know much about it besides just what people have told me. But for CFD you'll understand the applications of it once you take a Fluid Dynamics and DiffEqs course. In Fluids there are plenty of differential equations that govern certain properties of fluids that are impossible to solve explicitly (i.e. with a pen and paper exam style), which is understandable because fluid mechanics is a lot more complicated than solid mechanics (for the most part). So for that we need to use computer modelling to get some sort of a solution."
EngineeringStudents,3akuav,iamrandomperson,2,Sun Jun 21 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"Matlab would make a poor tool for CFD.  It is slow and lacks control over the methods.  CFD is done almost exclusively in C/C++ or Fortran, with some front end/back end work done in Python."

EngineeringStudents,3akuav,Lattice_Bowel_Mvmnts,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:27:07 2015 UTC,"For the most part, FEA is not iterative. You directly solve X equations for X unknowns. This is possible because of the linear nature of the problems that FEA usually solve. This is why you can do stuff like structural analysis and thermal analysis with FEA code, but you really aren't going to see fluid flow done with FEA code. The reason for this is fluid flow's governing equations are very much coupled and very much nonlinear."

When you have so many applicants that have an above 3.0 gpa NASA, along with all the others, place a lot more value in the aspects of a resume that distinguish a candidate. They'll be more impressed with relevant leadership roles/research/clubs because they've seen a good GPA a million times.  I'm not saying GPA is irrelevant; it's incredibly important for landing an internship (especially the first one), but a 3.1 student with research and leadership in engineering clubs and projects will probably get the job over a 3.4 student with no experience outside of academics."

Mechanical is better than civil for O&G.   If this is just about the money, stay in civil engineering. The “shortage” of petroleum engineers is OVER.

EngineeringStudents,3ak61f,hungrydirewolf,4,Sun Jun 21 00:14:54 2015 UTC,"Just some general advice: Your first year will be mostly learning the ropes of tertiary education and adjusting living away from home. The main thing you need to focus on is staying on top of your work and not let it overwhelm you. Your work ethic is going to be tested because no one is going to push you to do your assignments and study, so try and keep a schedule or plan for yourself. Also, try to enjoy yourself and get involved in the social aspect of university. Whether it be clubs that interest you, parties or anything else. It'll help relieve some of the tension and you'll build a great network of people. Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3ak61f,fnrooster,3,Sun Jun 21 02:47:58 2015 UTC,"The biggest one for me was to remember that all of my classes mattered. All of my gen ed classes that I needed to take I didn't see ""as important"" as my engineering classes and my GPA suffered as a result. So just stay on top of things.  Also, make friends in your major early. It's really good to have that support network.   To all the people that tell you that you'll have no life and spend 100 hrs a week doing schoolwork, they're exaggerating a bit. Just keep your head up and stay on top of your schoolwork and it'll limit the number of all nighters you'll need to pull.  Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,3ak61f,spencerawr,3,Sun Jun 21 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"From my experience I wish I did these things then; I certainly do them now:  • Don't slack, focus on getting the highest grades possible.   • You are most likely going to only have one day off in the weekend, at most.   • Try to get yourself into an undergraduate internship asap, preferably a paid one; it might be grunt work but it is a great addition to your resume.  • Get an agenda, plan what and how you plan to study, follow your own schedule religiously so that you don't fall behind.   • The time to take a break from studying is when you get stuck on a problem; go to the gym, a walk then come back and try again. Don't take a break while you are on a roll.  • Prepare your labs and prelabs ASAP. Ideally a week before your actual lab, read over it the night before. On the day of the lab or the day after complete your data tables, your calculations, and conclusions. Not procrastinating on the labs will relieve most of the pressure of having to do them.  • Make as many friends as you can but don't waste your time trying to study with the slackers; study with the smart people.  • Join a club, a society, or a frat, one that will help you grow, support you, and network in the future.   • If you need extra cash find kids to tutor, I charge 25 an hour, plus it helps you reinforce the material you learned.   • Keep all your notes, tests, and work. You can trade them with others who need them who took classes you haven't taken yet or you might need them to review the material in the future, you won't regret having them.  • Don't drink too much, there is plenty of time for that, take your time. If anyone offers you drugs don't say you never did it, instead say you don't like that drug and you don't wanna do it again.  • I doubt you will have this problem, and you probably already know this, but don't let anyone punk you around.  • If you are in Atlanta don't go walking around through the ghettos, don't party in the ghetto; preferably stay on campus.  • Use a condom, don't fall in love and don't spend too much money on females, but definitely keep them around as friends, their friends will love your accent."

EngineeringStudents,3akbu6,confusedstudent88,4,Sun Jun 21 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"Hi! Good to see other people considering the MSE route! Depending on the university you go to, there may actually be a biomaterials concentration available. In my experience, MSE is a rather broad, yet little-known, field, which is good because it allows for a framework to pursue any kind of sub-field of engineering that you could think of, and is surprisingly marketable, especially with how technology is heading now. Most specifically, I would consider it a major support field of engineering, because nothing can get done in design or engineering if the materials required to make it are unknown or under-researched! Also, keep in mind that the engineering major you get a B.S. in doesn't limit where you'll eventually go. On a higher tier, that's essentially what the higher levels of education are there for. Also, note that the higher education path of MSE is primarily PhD focused, where those going for a masters in MSE are at a disadvantage in the general pool of MSE PhD applicants. You may find that a combination of degrees will best supplement your knowledge and ability in the BioE field. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions!  TL;DR MSE is a broad, marketable, up-and-coming field that has a lot of scientific intrigue potential, especially with the next step of future-tech. However, you may end up finding that both MSE and BioE will get you where you want to go!"

I'm really fascinated by the product design vertical. The idea of building creative solutions to problems entices me. But I realized this very late I guess, I didn't do any internships directly relating to Mechanical Product design (though I designed parts of a satellite while I was at the satellite building team of my Univ). I've a fair knowledge in Solidworks. I wanna work for companies that build industry leading designs (say, Apple). How can I accomplish this? An MS in the US? or Apply for jobs in the US right now? Thanks for you help :)  Background (If its required.): I earned my Bachelors in Mechanical engineering from one of the leading universities in India.   Job Offers: I got offered a job as a trainee engineer at a big watch maker.   Activities: i) I worked as a designer at the satellite building team of my University. (One of our satellites is orbiting space right now)  ii) For our final year project, my team and me built an automatic drafting system, which can automatically design a pressure vessel along with flanges, pipes, gaskets in it, based on ASME standards and then draft it in AutoCAD.   TL;DR - I graduated in Mechanical engg and have been offered a trainee engineer position at a watch maker in India (Don't know which vertical though) but I want to be a product designer at a reputed firm in the US or Europe (say Apple).

EngineeringStudents,3ajfdc,brickrickslick,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Introduce yourself to people. My biggest problem is remembering people's names. The first day you get introduced to so many people and by the time you finish you can't even remember your supervisors name. Try to communicate with others, ask for advice or help with something. Most people are willing to talk to you.   You'll remember their names and they'll know yours."
EngineeringStudents,3ajfdc,Oxidation_State,4,Sun Jun 28 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"Context is everything which is why it's hard to have a catch-all method when it comes to networking. I think a lot of people tend to over-analyze their interactions with engineers and hiring managers. Conversations do not follow scripts, they are dynamic and unpredictable. That's why they're hard.  Are you going to be working in an office? Be friendly with the miscellaneous people you see on a daily basis like the receptionist, janitorial staff, etc. This will help you with your small talk skills. That's really how most casual office conversations get started in my experience. You talk some BS about the weather or complaining about it being Monday, then you introduce yourself. After you get acquainted, then you can go a little deeper.  People love talking about themselves. I usually like to ask about their day-to-day responsibilities in the office / field and what their favorite project was that they got to work on. When the conversation eventually makes its way back to you, just talk about your interests in the field. If any part of what they said interests you, mention that thing and why it interests you. Just be genuine.  The more people you get to know in the early days of your internship, the easier it'll be to pick up the stragglers in the later weeks."

EngineeringStudents,3ajfdc,nanami24zj,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:38:30 2015 UTC,"Hi! I was 25 when I tried to work full time and go back to school full time, My first semester I only took Gen Eds like American History, Western Civilization, Psychology and Composition. I got  A's, and B's on all of those classes but the second semester when I started taking a class related to computer engineering I got C's and B- is my highest. What I'm trying to say if your taking classes that you think it will be a little difficult for you and your going to work full time, that difficulty will be 3x more. Some classes need a lot of repetition for you to learn and advanced math homework take hours to practice to really get it(atleast for me it does), so you need most of you time studying if not all. I quit my job after the first year, I couldn't do it being a full time student, take care of my family, and have a job. lf you really need the job then it can't be help, make sure your time management is excellent and be prepared for next semester, books, syllabus, study block mapped out, know what the course are about, read 2 chapters ahead, if you have the book already and specially if the topic is alien to you. Reading 2 chapters ahead before the semester gives you a leeway for when you get sick or something comes up. Good luck!! Hope this helps you."

EngineeringStudents,3ajfdc,CaptainUnusual,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"3.6 cumulative is not bad at all. I haven't heard of companies having a cutoff of more than 3.5 and it's usually 2.5-3.2.  As for the black hole, it's not completely hopeless. You just have to tailor your application to each position, which you should do anyway, no matter the medium of application.  A career fair does give you a better shot though, since they are there specifically for students from your school. Have something to talk about, something that sets you apart from other students in your major. Your resume will tell them you are technically competent, you have to show them through your interpersonal skills that you're someone that they want to work with."

You need to understand (as fast as possible) that many professors you'll encounter in college are not great teachers. They are experts in their fields, but not necessarily experts in teaching it. The faster you understand this, the faster you'll take responsibility for your own education and use your professor properly, as the resource they can be to help deepen your understanding.  I've got 10 years on you and pursing the same degree. I gotta say that the internet as a teaching resource is a new and fabulous thing this time around. Use it to its fullest capacity to search out ways to explain the concepts in a way that clicks with you.  Also, get into a study group. When you are in a group where everyone approaches problems from a different perspective, it will broaden and/or deepen your understanding of the subject.  I approach these subjects from a posture of humility and at the same time know that thousands of others can grasp this stuff too. If I fail to understand something, it is not because it is not understandable, but because I have a shortcoming. So I work to fix that shortcoming. I embrace challenges and I do things that are difficult. I'm gonna learn something from this experience, goddammit."

The hardest issue that I have had so far was not being able to sit during office hours on material that I wasn't a hundred percent on. I really hope that the professors I have in the future will be able to explain the material well, but I can't realistically expect to understand everything on the first run through. I just get very frustrated when I work a lot at something and don't actually feel like I am getting close to a right answer, which just wears at my self confidence. What sites are you using for reference? I have been using Paul's Math Notes and Khan, which have both been pretty useful.  Study groups have only been partially helpful. On the one hand, when I have trouble figuring out a step, I do have someone to bounce an idea off of, as well as I get to explain material that I do understand. Maybe I should utilize my peers more. I am amazed that you can approach this as well as you can, especially with the humility. I don't expect to be the best, but I do expect to at least have a basic understanding of the material. Right now, we've been going through the emission spectrum and the photoelectric effect and for the life of me its entirely magic.  How far into the degree are you?"
EngineeringStudents,3aiw7y,bleu_cerulean,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"Not very far. I'm a transfer student with a previous degree but I think I am technically a 2nd year on the engineering track.   Youtube basically saved my ass in a Calc 2 online course (which means practically no professor, no lectures, no office hours). There is an engineering student that collected a bunch of vids into playlists corresponding to chapters in my exact text. UN is mneoct. He/she's got other playlists too corresponding to upper division engineering courses.  I used Patrick JMT, Khan and many others on YouTube. Don't forget that Khan has problem sets for practice, with worked solutions. When looking for study partners, don't just pick anyone. Pick folks that seem to get what the prof is saying and whose personalities you're likely to get along with. Keep the group small too, about 3 or 4.  Good luck and keep working at it!"
EngineeringStudents,3aiw7y,Fourier1,2,Mon Jun 22 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"It might look like everyone knows their stuff but most likely they don't, unless they reviewed the material beforehand.  I am still in school and I have had this feeling many times in the first two years when I will still getting my study techniques down.  A lot of times you will be taking notes and the material will be intimidating and confusing; when that happens just take as many notes as you can during the lectures and don't think about what they are trying to say, just accept it as a fact; then analyze the review the material after. To avoid this problem I study the material ahead of time, which makes me much more motivated and less intimidated.   To get a good understanding I review the material before lecture, take good notes during lecture, and review again after; I add summaries/equations to my personal ""cheat sheet"" for that class. Do homework problems, review it with students. I don't get a solid understanding for some material until I let it sink in for a week, review it before an exam, and study it again. I have managed to get A's without a solid understanding of the material, so if that happens I go back to in on my own time try to wrap my head around it again.   Phrase the concepts in ways that you would use to explain to others. I also tutor students so trying to find a way to explain the material to someone who doesn't know it is a really good way to solidify it for yourself."
EngineeringStudents,3aiw7y,Fourier1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"I know that some of my friends do, though I don't believe all of them do. What kills me is just how quick they pick up what is being stated.  What studying techniques do you use? A lot of what I have done is doing the homework and reviewing the material to make sure I do in fact understand. I haven't yet dedicated time to memorize all of the formulas we've used. What materials or sources (textbooks, pdfs, websites) would you recommend as a means of trying to gain a basic understanding before hand? I use a lot of analogies when I learn material due to the fact that if I can think about a problem in the correct way, it makes the material super easy to process. The best example I can give was at the start of learning currents. The water flow analogy made the difference. I like the idea of being able to phrase it to others. I wonder if there is a subreddit or source to go over the material. I suppose I could just do it to/for myself, but having a person ask questions is important."
EngineeringStudents,3aiw7y,bleu_cerulean,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"Study methods differ depending on the subject, but something I do for any class is create a ""cheat sheet"" for myself. I try to summarize every chapter onto one sheet of paper; once the exam comes around I would summarize those chapter onto a few columns on one sheet of paper. This works for me in math and chemistry:  http://i61.tinypic.com/24ywopg.jpg http://i61.tinypic.com/2f08xog.jpg http://i60.tinypic.com/34dkkjm.jpg http://i57.tinypic.com/160cydc.jpg  however in physics I had to do this on loose leafs of paper until I was confident what I had summazied the chapter well enough, then for finals week I would transfer everything over to a physics notebook I have specifically for these finalized summaries:  http://i57.tinypic.com/dhamgw.jpg  I noticed it got much easier to absorb and comprehend the material after a couple of years of improving my studying technique. Learning electricity and magnetism was much easier for me than learning linear and rotation momentum etc, simply because I fine-tuned my study method. Since everyone is unique you have to find what is right for you through trial and error.  Note, you won't always fully comprehend what you learned until a significant amount of time passes. I got A's in Calc I, II and III but  calc I didn't click until I took calc III, and calc III didn't click until I took Electricity and Magnetism. I got an A in differential equations last semester but I am spending this summer wrapping my head around it's application; and I feel as if I will NEVER understand Linear Algebra but I made a plan to go over that too. Getting  the foundations down on your own time will make it easier when you get ahead. Don't pay attention to how others seem to be doing, just focus on getting the best grade possible.   Read the chapter in the book ahead of time so that the lecture won't surprise you, and attempt to follow along. Come home, analyze it, review it, do some homework, and try to summarize everything you should should have got out of the lecture in a few sentences and write out the formulas you went over. The next day, review that material, prepare for the next lecture, and leave that info in the back of your head.   My teacher always said: ""study and do homework until you get stuck on a problem mentally, that's the time to take a break, go to the gym, or go for a walk, then come back and try again. Don't take breaks while you are on a roll."

So the class is basically balancing forces. It can certainly be tricky but isn't particularly hard. But the next course in that series is Dynamics. By definition, everything in dynamics is moving. Which makes it pretty daunting. Most problems look like a mess of pulleys, wheels, and pins, and you have to define every force, velocity, and acceleration.   To be honest, I think the difficulty of dynamics is a bit over exaggerated here. But it's a huge time sink that requires hours upon hours of studying. I loved the class though."

Now if y = mx2 +b, that's a non-linear equation, because of the square on x. This applies similarly to differential equations. Note that this is not referring to d2 x / dx2 which is the second differential, etc."

EngineeringStudents,3ahmbc,time-trader,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"general. Certainly y   Well, if it's a function, linear would have a variable with the highest exponent of 1, and the graph doesn't look like a parabola."
EngineeringStudents,3ahmbc,time-trader,2,Sat Jun 20 21:51:13 2015 UTC,"It is true. Linear differential equations are kind of like that too. The derivative is not put to any power or multiplied by a derivative of another dependent variable/unknown function. I think /u/14Gigaparsecs has put it nicely.  But I just wanted to point out that, there is more to a linear function/system than that. For example, it is not enough to say that a variable has a highest exponent of one, or looks like a line. What about function in more than one dimension? Trig functions are also not linear. Generally, in any dimension,  linear function is the one which satisfies additivity or superposition property.   f(x + y) = f(x)+ f(y);  and   Homogeneity:  f(ax) = a f(x).  Now it may not seem like much of a property, but at least in my mind, it is crucial in understanding how linear functions are different from non-linear, in terms of inputs and (expected) outputs.  In fact from this property arise other properties and mathematical constructs that make it possible to analyse linear systems. So if you took Linear Algebra, you learned about those various  tools, like linear combinations and eigenvalues. It is exactly those tools that can enable us to find solutions to linear differential equations.  In fact linear systems are so much easier to analyse, that in engineering we try to make every system linear, by approximation, (finding solutions for small values, using Taylor series etc)  The funny part is that there are very few analytical tools to solve non linear diff. equations.  So as soon as you get to real life even such a simple system as a pendulum) (look it up!) need a computer/numerical methods solution.  Hope I didn't come as condescending. I just really find it a fascinating topic.. Good luck with your studies!"

EngineeringStudents,3ahmbc,zundish,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:57:13 2015 UTC,"One responder was trying to ask you if you were familiar with what linear/nonlinear means in general. Certainly you must understand that concept if you were at the differential equations level of math. That said you can understand how much more involved solving nonlinear equations are versus linear ones.....yes? The same thing applies to diff-eq's. The techniques differ and the approach needed for nonlinear equations requires different analysis than do linear ones. Certainly the form of the equation can present different hurdles as well, and sometimes just making one simple change can present a new equation with a different approach to solving than it would be otherwise.  Think about it; a 2nd derivative can sometimes bring extra effort than what you would have with a 1st derivative.....right?  For example, if you had f(x) = esin(1/x)  df/dx = ( -cos(1/x) esin(1/x) )/x2  Not tough...but:  d2 f/dx2 = (esin(1/x) (-sin(1/x) + cos2 (1/x) + 2xcos(1/x)))/x4  Much more involved, so to effect solutions from linear to nonlinear is also more complicated."
EngineeringStudents,3ahmbc,groundedhorse,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"Many people are asking you about your linear v. nonlinear functions, which is important. I'll add that while linear combinations/superpositions of solutions are again solutions to linear problems, the same need not be true of nonlinear problems. Moreover, the theory of vector/solution spaces tells us that an nth order problem defines a solutions space which is n-dimensional. Thus, for a linear problem, finding n-many linearly independent solutions provides a basis to write down all solutions to the DE.

EngineeringStudents,3akgtc,Conkeldurrrr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"It's easy to pick on a major when you know almost nothing about it. I work as a structural engineer and I guarantee you it's far more challenging and rewarding than 95% of the jobs you'd find most other engineers in. That said though, the structural team is generally the smallest at any given firm. Most of the work is in transportation and land development (where I live at least), and if you graduate as civil engineer who focused on structural engineering it's very likely you'll end up somewhere else. I can't say I'd love my job as much if I were stuck on cad all day.   The all-around great thing about civil though is that if you're working as a consultant you're 100% designing real systems that are going to last for generations. You're leaving behind your mark when you do a job, and it's something your kids and grandkids can be proud of. There a lot of engineering jobs out there that'll have you design a single facet of a major project, but as a civil engineer you could design an entire bridge by yourself."
EngineeringStudents,3akgtc,salierniwasokay,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:41:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry for not contributing to the thread, but I have to ask: do people actually pick on civil engineering majors? Why? That sounds odd to me."
EngineeringStudents,3akgtc,cprenaissanceman,3,Sun Jun 21 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that picked on is the right word: ""made fun of"" or the ""butt of the joke"" is more apt. I think for the most part no one cares. However, I think that civil and industrial engineering are made fun of for a few (not necessarily correct) reasons:   Perceived Rigor: I can only speak for civil, but I think the largest reason is that CEs are made fun of because most CE curricula do not require certain ""hard"" courses (e.g. Advanced coursework in thermo, fluids, heat transfer, systems, etc.) in particular, this seems to be a pastime for mechanical engineers.  I think this largely stems from the association of civil engineering with statics and mechanical engineering with dynamics. This association becomes conflated: as statics is a subset of dynamics, civil is a subset of mechanical. Though these theoretical principles are important, they are not descriptive of practice. I suspect the same is true for industrial engineers.   As a counterpoint to the oft claimed ""mechanicals can do anything"", I would say that ME offers a wide theoretical basis for engineering practice, but does not sufficiently educate one for work in any industry with its own design processes/codes/standards, regulations, and history. One can argue this is true of any major and that one's major does not even prepare one for industry. Nevertheless, my point is that simply thinking a mechanical engineer (or any engineer for that matter) can do anything by the virtue of education alone is nonsense.   As an example, I don't think a mechanical engineer would be prepared to use ASCE 7-10 or the HCM. Nor would they be familiar with many civil engineering drawing conventions. And likely they would know little to nothing about construction. Mechanical engineers are prepared to do many things, but not everything: remember engineering is about more than equations. There are many factors beyond analysis which make a competent engineer. These competencies may not be the same across industries.    Perceived intrigue: I think many people find ME, CS, BMED, etc. very flashy and perhaps even sexy. Not so much the case with civil and industrial. Ironically enough, I think there's a certain amount of the popular kids (in this case the cool engineering majors) making fun of the dweebs, dorks, nerds, and geeks (I.e. The not so cool engineering majors) for their own amusement. Clarity of purpose: what exactly is a civil or industrial engineer? (Not what they do but what they are.) I think that because the titles of civil or industrial engineering do not necessarily reflect the technical content of the majors, people make fun of these majors because they in large part don't understand very much about them. Someone to make fun of: by in large, our society, despite its intolerance for bullying, loves to make fun of a specific person or group again and again and again. This is true in many ways: if you are familiar with orchestras there is a phenomenon called a viola joke (look it up - though it probably won't be funny you haven't been in a band or orchestra). The poor viola section is always made fun of for no reason. Nevertheless, this is part of the culture: viola players know it exists and generally ignore or embrace it. Perhaps a better example is Meg from Family Guy. The things that happen to her are terrible;  many are also quite funny. Humor is always tricky and requires the best of one's judgment.   In any case, it fine to bag on civil engineers in a joking manner. Having a sense of humor an important life goal. But we also need to be cautious about taking things (meant as humor) seriously and letting it morph into views of inferiority, vitriol, and hatred.   Other: I'm sure there are many other reasons as well. These are just the one's I could think of at the moment.   As for OP, I think it largely depends on the individual. Civil is pretty broad in its scope so there are many things that might interest an individual. What people are likely less inclined to like are the lifestyles / work environments required of certain engineering industries. For example, some people live for construction. They like being in the field and helping to bring about the fruition of a project. Others may not: the long hours, ""rough"" people involved and the litigation (oh so much.) remember school is not industry. Finding interest in a subject matter (even with talent) is not always enough to make you successful in a given area of engineering. You must also accept the associated costs which ultimately may not jive with you. I will provide no advice on how to determine if a field is worth pursuing. However, I will say that it is wise to consider more than interest (as in inherent amusement with or curiosity towards or attraction to, not as in investments with respect to the self) alone when making decisions about the future."
EngineeringStudents,3akgtc,RKO36,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:48:37 2015 UTC,"What I like about civil is, firstly the stuff you deal with is very cool.

Also, civil engineering allows you to both be in the field and also do work in a nice comfortable office.  Best of both worlds."

If you want to specialize in something more specific like the focii I just mentioned, then you can do that too, or just try to pick up those more specialized skills on the job.  Employers don't expect you to be an expert at something right out of school--they just want to know you have solid fundamentals and a good work ethic, and the rest you can learn on the job.

EngineeringStudents,3ah6hi,dragonf1r3,3,Sat Jun 20 08:03:48 2015 UTC,With physics II (E&M I assume) take whatever is the easiest of those 3. I did calc 3 and physics 2 and it wasn't bad. I barely passed calc 3 but I was working part time.
EngineeringStudents,3ah6hi,MechPandaa,3,Sat Jun 20 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"Take whichever professor has better reviews. I took all of those and I thought they were all equally as easy, but one professor sucked so I didn't do as well"
EngineeringStudents,3ah6hi,runAUG,2,Sat Jun 20 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Calc 3. Add other people have mentioned it will probably be the most helpful for physics, that thinking process (thinking in 3d, and a little bit of Calc) will help with photogrammetry as well. Then again you might see some diff eqs in photogrammetry, and probability is always helpful for understanding error theory."
EngineeringStudents,3ah6hi,mniwrm,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:55:05 2015 UTC,never taken probability so differential equation would be the easiest in my opinion. Methods are as mechanical as they can get and straight forward with the exception of some really tricky substitutions before the application of a method.

I've been putting off Engineering Statistics because it keeps clashing schedule-wise with requisite track courses, so I can't give an opinion on it.  Calc III was pretty easy for me. Take everything you've learned in Calc I then extrapolate it to three dimensions. That's an oversimplification, but basically the gist.  Diffs however, was IMHO, the hardest math class I've taken, but I can't be sure if it was the material or the instructor. One of our exams was a takehome which we were encouraged to do collaboratively, and it took a group of eight of us four hours to figure out the final problem."

If you liked the part in Apollo 13 where they had to come up with a way to hack a filter for the CO2 scrubber, that's the whole book.  A less engineering oriented series I love is The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss. One thing I like about it is that the magic system he came up with is actually kind of believable. It might be due to the fact that Rothfuss studied Chemical Engineering in school."

EngineeringStudents,3afzp8,cs_kris,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"I actually did! Unfortunately after a while I realized that's not gonna cut it. They don't have any of the features because of which I'm using AutoCAD in the first place. The worst thing is even if I knew how to add that stuff I don't know what it's supposed to be until I know what the thing is.   For instance, it's pretty obvious that this thing has a lot under the hood. I just plopped down the circles, drew a square around them with a line across it and drew some wavy shit. I wrote all of the text in one of the circles' description box because I don't have the categories for the different kinds of information, and more importantly, I don't even know what they're supposed to be. As you can see here it all falls down the instant you click anywhere.  Another example are the arrows. I understand they're supposed to somehow be connected to one another and have information change depending on the wires they're on or something, but I don't know how to do that. So I just changed the number of the wire they're on to that data and moved it so it looks like it belongs to the arrow.  Or this thing. I drew it, but I can't know from the picture whether the arrow in the circle is part of the symbol or its own symbol entirely.  I imagine the easiest and most probable way to check for errors would be to just run that report thing that makes a table of every component and all its data. Obviously that's going the be missing half of the things and the rest is going to be gibberish or all written in one description box.  So if you looked at a picture of my schematics you'd say I did an amazing job but if you clicked around or (or tried to use any feature I'm using ACE for and not an image editor) it would be very obvious that I, in fact, have no idea what I'm doing. The fact that there's no reason I should notwithstanding, I still didn't do what I was supposed to. I might as well just screenshot the PDF, remove the white background and paste it into a DWG file."
EngineeringStudents,3afzp8,cs_kris,2,Sat Jun 20 00:50:58 2015 UTC,I'm interning in this field. I answered a few to the best of my ability.

EngineeringStudents,3afzp8,Saddam00,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for taking the time to reply :D   These are all symbols that are probably standard for a company   That's the main reason I'm frustrated. Fuck that it's way too advanced, I can figure it out, but I was never told what standard to use nor did I get any of the (I presume) custom symbols. It's like being told to run a marathon and you're like ""damn, but I guess I at least try"" and then they cut your legs off.  I spent at least 30-40 hours on this by now, mainly doing nothing. Just looking for clues, googling said clues to find out what some shit is and then googling where to find that shit. Anyone else who needs to do something like this already has all of the symbols and knows what to do with them because it's his fucking profession.   Looks like a transformer going from three phase to three phase and a neutral.   Do similar pre-built symbols exist in ACE? Can it be built with some ""transformer creating tool"" or something, like PLCs can? I just drew it from regular old lines and I don't imagine it would behave like it's supposed to.   Looks like a company standard or some sort of utility wiring showing three phases and a neutral   Yeah, I agree. After a ton of googling I figured out PE is protective earth and N is a neutral so I think N/PE designates those 2 connect or something. Any idea what the vertical line is supposed to be?   Looks like an AC to DC converter   Yeah, I just checked my drawing and I actually have that one.   Looks like a chip with low true inputs and outputs   What are low true inputs and outputs and how do I make a chip?   Circles look like a shielded cable and the perpendicular line looks like a ground   Are the circles shielding the 3 cables or are they shielded themselves? Why are they seemingly a short circuit? Is these a tool for making shielded cables or do I just make a round wire and change it to dashed? Is the ground a part of the motor symbol (because I don't have that one), does it have its own symbol or do I just draw a short wire and increase the width?  I really appreciate your reply, it's giving me hope!"
EngineeringStudents,3afzp8,spaceman-mike,2,Sat Jun 20 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly man I am just as lost as you are for just about every question you asked. The company I'm interning for doesn't use ACE, we use AutoCAD Revit MEP which I think is becoming industry standard. It allows you to model buildings in true 3D which is very useful when coordinating with mechanical and plumbing devices. For one line diagrams (what you are doing) we use annotation symbols that our company created. For example, I would just drag and drop the UPS annotation symbol onto the drafting view and then something like this will be on the drawing:  http://www.elit-ups.com/immagini/ups_tph_king60_500_9.jpg  I think you are just drawing the annotation symbols that a company would use. Which in the ""real world"" would most likely never happen since it is much faster to drag and drop the company's prebuilt symbols."
EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,He90,87,Fri Jun 19 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"First of all, the current doesn't travel on just the path of least resistance.  Ok, absorb that.  The current travels along all possible routes along the voltage gradient set up by your battery/power supply. This means that there is current flowing from one terminal to the other through the insulation of the electrical plug, through the air between the plugs, along the entire cable, everywhere; it's just that the amount is extremely tiny because the electrical conductivity of insulators is ~12+ orders of magnitude less than that of the conductors.  What insulators actually do is allow for a large voltage gradient across them at a given current throughput; conductors only allow a small voltage gradient. The difference between these is so large (again, 12+ orders of magnitude) that we normally just don't notice the leakage current through the insulators.  Now, the current doesn't know which path has what resistance, because it hasn't traveled along it to find out. What happens is a wave of current emanates from the source and travels along the voltage gradient toward the drain. As each area has different electrical conductivity, some areas will have electrons/holes pile up in them, causing the local voltage to increase/decrease which causes the current flowing into that area to slow down. This process repeats until the current ""wave"" has propagated to the drain, where it is collected.   The first thing to realize here is that this process happens on the order of nanoseconds - it's literally so fast you need dedicated instrumentation to detect it.   The second thing to remember is that these current ""backups"" propagate backward (just like water in a river running into a stationary sponge - some current gets through, just not a whole lot, and it backs up the flow behind it). Once this information from all of the pathways from the source to the drain is communicated back to the source, the system will ""ring"" (think guitar string or the slinky experiment in HS physics) and eventually settle into a steady state. Again, this happens so fast you simply don't notice it with the exception of components specifically designed to take advantage of it (flyback transformers being an excellent example).  TL;DR: current is like a river of water where everything is slightly leaky; it'll eventually settle down into a steady state and that's what you observe.  BTW: this phenomenon is derived from the same source as Fermat's principle of least time, and you noted the same simplification that was classically applied: the light takes the shortest (subjectively) path. Remember that both light and electrons are driven by an electric field; it's this field that actually propagates along the conductive pathways at near c, and it's this field which ""washes"" over the conductors and insulators in the circuit to setup the voltage gradient. The simplification in the optical case was that light only takes when the shortest path (how does it know?) when in fact it actually takes all paths simultaneously, it's just that the shortest path is the unique one that constructively interferes at the output of the material (the rest turn into evanescent waves which die off after a few nanometers - one of the causes of imperfect transmittivity)."
EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,bobskizzle,3,Fri Jun 19 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"This is a great explanation.    OP, if a visualization helps, look for a video or gif of lightning in slow motion.  Note how there are many paths that it ""tries,"" but the final bolt, with the bulk of the energy, takes the easiest path found.  The feelers are the initial state; the bolt is the steady state. (If it helps to expand the metaphor, the end of the strike is when the power supply is depleted or disconnected.)"

EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,bobskizzle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like I need to clarify something so that everyone is on the same page:  Recall that the actual electrons don't flow very fast (on the order of mm per second); what's propagating through the material is the electric field (also known as the voltage gradient plus some extra dynamic factors due to the changing magnetic field; see Maxwell's Equations), which travels at the local speed of light in the material (i.e. it is slowed by material properties however it's still damned fast). As this field is set up, free electrons and electron holes begin accelerating along/against the field. These charges begin piling up as noted above; what I wanted to clarify is that all of the charges along the entire ""conduction path"" begin moving essentially simultaneously (as the local electric field increases).  Further, note that the bulk resistivity of the material strongly depends on the permittivity of the medium (which is a complex number, by the way; have fun with that one).  All of these factors (and a few more that are junior/senior level E&M topics) contribute to the steady state rule that, basically, I=V/R."
EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,bobskizzle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add a good visualization of electricity is flow through a pipe with two valves in parallel. The valves act as resistors,  current = flow, and voltage drop = pressure drop. Let's say they have identical valves one open at 25 the other at 75 percent water is still going to flow through both."
EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,Banshee90,8,Sun Jun 21 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"Let's say you are a skiier. You like to ski. But you notice that all skiiers (including you) ski so much and never shower and as a result all smell terrible. So you are repulsed by other skiiers; you must keep a minimum distance between them at all times.  Now, you go down a mountain. It has one path. The path has some trees that slow down the skiiers (and you). So because one skiier can only go so fast, and there must be a certain distance between them, there can only be a flow rate of so many skiiers per unit time.  If you put more trees in, the flow rate decreases.  Now, let's say there are two paths. One has no trees and one has a lot of trees. So most skiiers will be able to go down the path with no trees with a high flow rate, and a few skiiers with a low flow rate go down the path with lots of trees. Everyone keeps the same distance apart, though.  So if you're at the top of the mountain, and you see two paths, and you are randomly assigned one, you will almost always go for the one with no trees because many more skiiers fit onto it while keeping that minimum repulsive distance, but sometimes you get assigned the slow path.  And if one path has a huge rock, well, nobody goes down that way because nobody wants to be stuck forever."
EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,gimpwiz,3,Fri Jun 19 17:39:43 2015 UTC,"Think of current flow similar to water through a pipe with the water pressure being voltage, the diameter of the pipe being resistance and the water the electric current. If I have a pipe that splits into two other pipes, one with a small diameter and one with a large diameter, more water will flow through the larger pipe as it can accommodate a greater volume of water and therefore has 'less resistance'. So electric current doesn't 'know' which path has the least resistance, it just moves according to the voltages and resistances in the circuit."

EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,MechPandaa,6,Fri Jun 19 17:11:35 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much exactly like evolution, something very little people truly get and questions like how/why it works are constantly asked. It requires no explanation, it's simply the only way things can be. Of course that the traits that make something more likely to ensure its offspring's survival are more abundant because having offspring is the only way for the traits to exist! It's a tautology due to the nature of the universe.   Same thing here, more current travels where there is less resistance. Resistance impedes current, that's literally what it does, so there's more current where there is less resistance, simply by definition. It's a tautology as well. In case arguing by the definition is too semantic, resistance is just an obstacle. It's completely evident why a path with less obstacles ensures more throughput.   If you want to go lower, though, you're bound to hit a wall. You can keep asking questions after every single explanation forever. In the end it's just that things are what they are simply because things can't be what they're not, another tautology:)."
EngineeringStudents,3af0jd,teokk,-1,Fri Jun 19 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"To extend the metaphor further - current travels along all paths, it's just that it will naturally go further along the path of least resistance.  Similarly, evolution will generate random mutations, and the best fit for survival is the path that will propagate.  OP's question is like asking, ""how did evolution know to go from single called organisms to humans?""  And the answer is it didn't.  It just tried a bunch of stuff, and that's kinda what stuck."

Not a bad analogy in the end.  if you think about water in free space with the Earth below it, the water is going to accelerate towards the earth because the earth's gravity attracts it. If the earth were positively charged, electrons would similarly accelerate towards the earth because of its charge.  It's more complex in wires (and I'm sure in pipes too, though I managed to avoid doing fluid mechanics), but the basic principle (that the electrons try to flow towards a positive charge) is pretty much correct."

A successful alumni network helps students succeed after graduation which makes successful students want to come there and on and on.

EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,StressOverStrain,24,Fri Jun 19 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"It depends. On a lot of factors.  First of, let's talk rankings. Rankings are based on a lot of nonsense that doesn't actually impact your education. A university's ranking is based on a lot of monetary things (funding per professor, funding per student, outside funding for graduate students, etc) which may or may not impact your education. Closer on the ""may not"" when it comes to an undergraduate degree. So take ""top tier"" university with a grain of salt.  Secondly, it depends on your status. Your undergraduate degree is pretty standard, meaning that as long as you went to an ABET accredited school and get a BS in engineering, you're on the same footing. (I say a BS and ABET accredited because schools like Swarthmore offer ""engineering"" degrees which are not equal to a BS in EE from Texas State University, they should hardly be called engineering degrees). However, because you're on equal footing, you have to set yourself apart from the crowd with internships and projects and other unique experiences. For graduate degrees it really depends on the professor you work with - his name will carry the most weight - and they happen to flock to top tier schools. That doesn't mean you have to go to a top tier school. One of the top guys in my field is at Embry Riddle which just barely started a PhD program and is definitely not a top tier school.  The project opportunities is really where the top tier school comes in. Usually, they have more organizations around big projects like the Baja car or Design, Build, Fly. That being said...it also makes it a lot harder to get on those teams, especially for freshmen and sophomores.  So in short: a lot of what makes a university a ""top tier"" school is nonsense, it matters a lot more what you do with your time at the school you're at, and don't get a BA in engineering physics and expect it to be the same as a BSEE.  source: I worked in industry and was hired alongside MIT grads as well as state schools and we basically got the same starting package. And in grad school I have worked with people from all over the place as well...even a kid who got his degree at a liberal arts school (his mom worked there so he went for free but he set himself apart with NASA internships, math team, coding team, etc)"
EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,qwicksilfer,15,Fri Jun 19 14:27:09 2015 UTC,"Everything said here is true. Source: had a girlfriend who worked at UCSB in a building with PR and development.   Literally the only thing UCSB cares about is rankings and money. They spend all their effort and money on procuring top-tier professors who have the highest chance of getting a Nobel Prize, attracting rich donors, and paying for positive press. UCSB gives zero fucks about undergrads and a few mild fucks about grad students. It's all a bureaucratic circus act to grow the university in prestige.  As an aside, I kind of wish universities could be ranked by employment rates, salary, and satisfaction post-graduation. Right now, rankings are based on some nebulous things like prestige, exclusivity, and campus life."
EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,2four,6,Fri Jun 19 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"As a kid at a different UC, this is interesting. I'm pretty aware of some of SB's strong professors (one of the physics profs there won a Nobel Prize recently), but it's hard to believe they'd only care about the press and prestige.  Over in our magical forest, I find this to be less true in my limited experience. A good number of the professors seem to care about the students here (though there are some horrible eggs, like the head of the BME department..sigh), and the research here only attracts citations, not Nobel Prizes. But it's important nonetheless.  I find your aside to be very true. That's pretty much how US News ranks schools, and it's silly."

I think it speaks volumes when you look at our joke of a career center, our lack of availability to internships, and the size and availability of classes. They don't care much about undergrads, otherwise they'd be putting your tens of thousands of dollars towards these undergrad resources than towards paying our UC president seven figures to shake hands and make connections."

How else does some random public school manage to get monstrously rankings and a Nobel every 5 years? That said, my understanding is that most of the professors (at least in ECE) don't teach any courses and the ones that do teach take it quite seriously. Most of the professors I had were actually great teachers."
EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,pyzparticle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"I've had great professors as well. And a lot of shitty ones (cough Matthys). I think the point is that undergrads are being neglected.   You pay about $16,000 a year in school costs, even if you're a resident. For a school to take that much money from you and not make you a top priority, instead choosing professors solely on research potential, is irresponsible to you, the customer. It makes you wonder how the Cal State system manages to have some extraordinary opportunities and programs for students without research and while still being a publicly funded school. It's certainly been demonstrated possible to do, so why do we rely so heavily on the precedence of research over students, when a better balance is possible?    Just so I'm not talking out of my ass: here's an example. Our Fluid Mechanics class took a trip to Cal Poly to use their fluids learning lab, which is about 2000 sq. ft. of lab space specifically for learning, including an HVAC system and three wind tunnels. For perspective, UCSB has one wind tunnel tucked into a small lab. CP students pay about $9,000. Understandably, we do have more research opportunities, but I think a cost increase of 78% warrants a little more undergrad resources than we currently have, especially when we're ranked higher than CP."

Now, I'm probably totally biased because of where I went, but that really has no bearing on how good an education from that school is.  Tech pretty much lets everyone in.  You've gotta be spectacularly bad for Tech to reject you.  At least when I applied, you didn't even need to write an essay.  However, Tech has a lot of drop outs.  Either switching to different majors, switching to different schools, or dropping out entirely.  Because the classes are on par or more in-depth than other schools (I had a friend at University of Michigan who was in the MechE program and we learned basically the exact same things as far as we could tell, only Tech had more hands-on labs and nearly all of Tech's senior design projects were with actual companies while many of U of M's senior design was for professors.)"

It's sub-par on every aspect of the program. I just don't think it is a good value program, personally (and I have interviewed students from the program...they don't have a fundamental grasp of engineering...like, how to solve a simple statics problem or the three ""kinds"" of pressure measurements). If you went through the program and kicked butt, let me know. But so far, I haven't met a kid who went through that program who has mastered the basics of engineering."

EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,Every1sFriend,7,Fri Jun 19 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"Essentially, cost and pedigree.  A upper tier school has a better pedigree and looks amazing on a resume, but it often costs magnitudes more and is more difficult to get into. An upper tier school usually has lots of donations from the wealthy and alumni."
EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,Joshkl2013,5,Fri Jun 19 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"Do you know why they are more prestigious and cost more though?

EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,letheia,2,Fri Jun 19 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between the most highly ranked schools and the best schools. But let's be clear, there is a very large overlap.  Generally speaking, the best schools are the best schools because they have the best students, who go there because they want to go to the best schools. It's not tautological as much as it is cyclical. If the best schools start doing shit to fuck things up for the students, they will no longer be the best.  What I do worry about is when lower ranked schools try to become higher ranked schools quickly. My own university did that. We went from 80-something to 50- or 40-something in the five years I went there. They focused a lot on the metrics by which schools are ranked. On the other hand, I was also slightly involved in a relatively large and very commendable effort by my school's ECE department to aggressively improve the curriculum. Were those two things related? Probably - they were probably able to secure funding for professors, research, capex, and the time and effort to improve the curriculum largely due to the university's push. On the other hand, it doesn't hurt that many of the big alumni donors went through the engineering program and want to see it improve."
EngineeringStudents,3aekaa,gimpwiz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"In terms of education you will see very little difference in Engineering, since much of the curriculum is standardized by ABET. There's not a huge correlation between school and post-grad salary in Engineering, due to this fairly standardized curriculum and due to STEM graduates having a decent job options compared to other majors.   Where you will see a difference is in the quality of your classmates, the resources available at the school (labs, paper subscriptions, events, equipment etc...), networking and alumni connections, and more opportunities for research. You will have good and bad professors at either end of the spectrum. Top schools will attract top professors, but half the time they are more focused on their research and teaching is an afterthought.   I did my undergrad at a small public college, and my graduate studies at a top tier university. I thought I got a better education at the small public school, while the top tier university had higher quality students. Even the goofiest or strangest person you meet is there for a reason, and the amount of bright and talented people you will meet is a huge selling point."

There's typically a lot of teams for projects to get involved with and they often have good funding, so you can be successful and get awards / resume bonus points. Career fairs at top schools will have all the best companies in your area and they will be very interested in getting interns / full-time positions filled. There are advantages and the name recognition and alumni network can take you far if you take advantage of it.

EngineeringStudents,3ag1rf,M4d4o,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"it is a bit of an unknown academically in my part of the world    Yeah I understand. Finland is not that huge country so we are not that known especially not outside of Europe. But I would say Aalto is pretty good University (well it is Finland best one). There are some cool student projects like for example making Finland first satellite. Also Aalto University is known in Europe.   also what certifications do they usually require there , do they require toffel ,or for me to already know finish before i go there ?    Most master's programmes are taught in English. International students are required to demonstrate their proficiency in English language.   So international students don't have to learn Finnish if they don't want to. Most of Finnish people are able to speak English.  Link from my previous post has all required documents and everything that is needed to know for applying to Aalto University."

You can stretch/distort the truth, and possibly outright lie, on your resume so long as you can back it up.  Promote yourself, make yourself sound good.  Just don't be an idiot.  You can't claim to have worked at Google if you haven't, you can't claim to have 20 years experience when you only have 2.  What you can do is stretch things out to make it sound much more interesting, you can say you have 3 years experience with some tool when you only have 1 etc...  To the actual question, I see nothing wrong inherently wrong with doing it.  But, do the risk/reward analysis.  How much benefit will this give him?  Probably not very much, so what's the point?"

In practice you will probably not actually optimize that, but it is fun to think about it and maybe do the math.  The one we made shot further than a foot ball field.

Basically everyone comes in knowing the same math, physics, ext. but what will set you apart is knowing how to actually machine or make stuff. This will also make you super useful to a Formula SAE or Baja or Solar car team if your Uni has them (I extremely recommend joining a design, build team). Most Mech E profs will be very impressed if you can look at something and know how to mill or lathe it. What operations are possible, what arnt. What the different between UNC, UNF, UNJF, and NPT threads are. Drilling, tapping, bolt standards, stuff like that.  If I could go back I would ask around my town and see if I could get a part time job at a machine shop just helping around. You will learn so much just through osmosis. Learn about sheet metal forming, stamping, casting, spin forming, carbon fiber layups (this is a really fun and big one). LEARN HOW TO READ AND MAKE PART DRAWINGS FOR MACHINIST. A job like this won't seem like ""engineering"" work but it will put you MILES ahead of any other freshman who thinks they are the shit because they know physics.

EngineeringStudents,3aehso,mr_melk,3,Fri Jun 19 15:12:47 2015 UTC,Autodesk has 30 day trials and free student versions of all their software. OP is right on. Hit up a makerspace if there's one near you. They might have a well equipped workshop.
EngineeringStudents,3aehso,cj2dobso,2,Fri Jun 19 15:27:36 2015 UTC,Solid works is great for learning 3D modelling and has a modest FEA system built in.   Student teams get free licenses. There's not many other places to find it for free legally that I know of. (But there are others.)  AutoCAD is also pretty good and it has a free student version.
EngineeringStudents,3aehso,MAK-15,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"This depends. I went four years and graduated without knowing more than the basics in machining they taught during the first year. I personally wouldnt waste my time, it won't help you graduate unless you go to a school where machining is a core part of the curriculum."
EngineeringStudents,3aehso,Fourier1,2,Fri Jun 19 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"kickasstorrents for SolidWorks, MATLAB, visualstudios etc. There is also video courses available so that you can teach yourself certain aspects of each of these programs.   openCourseWare is offered by a number of schools, my favorite is the MIT ocw but there are others: http://mashable.com/2013/08/06/opencourseware/#gallery/10-best-opencourseware-sites/521804b512d2cd5f450004d0  people usually upload their textbooks on SlideShare so that is a good place to get the textbooks and solution manuals in order to start teaching yourself early."
EngineeringStudents,3ac7o6,jeezuspieces,2,Thu Jun 18 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm taking controls right now, so I may be able to help.  The first equation comes from the definition of the state variables.  X1=x, X2=xdot, X2=X1dot.  The second equation comes from the EOM after dividing through by m.  X2dot=(-k/m)X1-(b/m)X2=(1/m)F(t)  Writing this in matrix form gives you equation 14.  Hope this helps."

EngineeringStudents,3ac7o6,who_dat_who_der,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:04:38 2015 UTC,When you start doing much higher order systems... you'll see a really nice diagonal appear.
EngineeringStudents,3ac7o6,Dertrommlinator,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"Second order systems are very common in many fields, but the easiest way to visualize what's going on is to think about them in terms of equations of motion. For a mechanical system, simply specifying the position of all bodies is not enough to describe the motion. You need to describe the velocities as well. Hence a second order problem requiring two initial conditions. In state space, we can pick two state variables (position and velocity) for each degree of freedom. Choose   y_1 = x  and  y_2 = dx/dt = x_dot.   Now you want to write two first order equations. The first is super simple. Differentiate it to get   y_1_dot = x_dot.   That's it. Look at the first line of the matrix equation in your link. They use x instead of y, so it just reads x_dot = x_dot.   The second is also easy. Differentiate to get   y_2_dot = x_double_dot.   You then just solve for x_double_dot from the equation of motion and sub it in. Now x_double_dot has disappeared from both equations. Finally, you replace all x with y_1 and x_dot with y_2. There you go, two equations in terms of the state variables y_1 and y_2. Or in your link's example, x_1 and x_2."
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,yungdieu,10,Fri Jun 19 03:47:45 2015 UTC,"No, you shouldn't make that a goal. You can learn the software anywhere by just using it. It could just be at school. You might learn some tricks to save time, but probably not much more than that. It's also entirely possible that you'll need to learn a new software package as a full timer in your 50's. It's just something you do while working.  Use the internship to get to know the people and the industry. Ask them about what they like about working there, what they don't like, what their background is, their work history, etc. It'll give you a better sense of what you'll want to do, what you don't want to do, and what kind of opportunities will be available to you in the future."
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,iamrandomperson,2,Fri Jun 19 04:25:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. OP, you can learn software on your own. Use the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the industry and the office's work flow, etc.."
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,thepasser13,2,Fri Jun 19 04:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah but its nice when the licenses are $ xx,xxx AND you can get paid to do it! Getting paid to learn is awesome."
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,I_Miss_Scrubs,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:39:05 2015 UTC,The point is that learning software is just part of the job regardless of whether or not it's your goal. It's also not your choice what you're learning for the most part. You just kind of learn what you need to to get the job done.
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,iamrandomperson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:11:20 2015 UTC,Agreed on all points. Taking a job to learn software is silly. But it is an added bonus.
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,I_Miss_Scrubs,2,Fri Jun 19 06:17:50 2015 UTC,"Your purpose is to learn and gain experience. If that involves using software then it's even better.    Before I started working this summer all I knew for CAD was AutoCAD, now I use  more tools from Autodesk (Map 3D, Raster Tools, etc)  to get the work done so I'm happy I'm getting the chance to learn it.   Using AutoCAD efficiently varies by person, some prefers point and click menus I prefer entering the commands (left hand on keyboard, right hand on mouse)."
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,brickrickslick,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:20:59 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else is saying about learning real life applications, gaining experience, etc., if you do take up an internship that is largely software focused (CAD work all day as a designer, PCB layout as a hardware engineer, etc) make sure that you don't take this internship as your last one. An internship like this would be good to do for your 1st or 2nd, but for your last internship before graduation you want something close to what you want to do after graduation. Well if you do want to be an AutoCAD designer and be the expert on AutoCAD as your full time job I would go for it."
EngineeringStudents,3ad6e9,1upLuigi1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:24:35 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I have been taking classes this summer to get ahead and in my spare time I have been slowly learning AutoCAD. I plan on interning next summer to get some engineer related work experience under my belt.
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,GAM3R187,6,Fri Jun 19 09:39:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't know a ton, I guess you could say. Not that I was innocent to how difficult engineering would be, but just in terms of engineering being a relatively new interest in my life. I hadn't worked on cool engineering projects until I started robotics in high school. After mentoring the team a couple years after I graduated, I decided to do engineering.  Anyway, I didn't take calc in high school, and I didn't consider myself good enough at math to test out of college algebra and/or trig. I took those in community college and took calc afterwards.   It sounds like you know all the staples to college success, but I'd like to add that you should be realistic with yourself. Before I started, I believed I'd want to work my ass off and get perfect grades. Nope. You need to give yourself time to relax. Don't expect to be perfect. Also, get involved in some clubs, related to engineering or not. Your life in college shouldn't just be studying. Plus, if it's engineering related, I think companies like to see a little bit of diversity in terms of clubs, even at the cost of imperfect grades.  If you procrastinate (you probably do, everyone does), try to stay on top of that shit. Space out all of your work. Everything will be a lot easier if you can just minimize all procrastination. This is applicable to life in general. If you're especially bad at procrastination, get started on handling it now.   If you don't exercise at the moment, I would recommend trying something, because doing Taekwondo really helped me through a lot of stress. Try to go to a fitness class so that way you're more likely to stick to it. You should have like a ""free"" membership to the campus gym, so there's no reason not to.  This ended up kinda long... but if you have more questions I can answer them, though maybe not right away."
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,RavioliRachel,2,Fri Jun 19 10:19:49 2015 UTC,"Nope that was awesome! I have heard and agree with most of this. I was looking for advice in terms of course work, what can I get my head around to make sure I am ready for courses in engineering?"
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,RavioliRachel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:22:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I would make sure you feel good about physics and math, and that's really it, heh. The only really difficult classes I've had so far have been Calc II and Diff Eq., and these are math classes. Physics wasn't even as difficult in terms of those classes. I haven't taken many engineering-specific classes yet, but I don't think they'll be as bad as those two. Well, except Thermodynamics...   But yeah, math and physics. The physics will help you figure out what the problem wants, and the math will help you get what the problem wants. If you so desire, maybe try learning some Inventor or AutoCAD if your school has it. But I took a CAD class in college, with absolutely no experience, and it wasn't that hard. You'll likely have to take one, too."
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,RavioliRachel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:36:49 2015 UTC,"Okay awesome! I mess around with sketchup all the time, so I am semi-comfortable with CAD. Also calc 2 an themo are weed outs though aren't they?"
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,EagleEyeInTheSky,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I didn't know if that was a generally accepted perception of those classes or if it was just my school. I think that can probably be applied to most of the classes taken before professional school, but some are more difficult than others.   Don't worry about it, though. I hear it gets better once you get into professional school. Things won't get easier, but they'll be more interesting."
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,Scrtcwlvl,3,Sat Jun 20 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, if you can solve for x and do trig, college will teach you everything else. Colleges basically don't make any assumptions as to what you learn in high school and will reteach you a lot of high school physics and calc and stuff.  Normally I don't point out bad grammar on this site, but if you write your engineering reports like you wrote this post, you will lose points, so you might want to work on some proofreading sometime. That is one thing that they'll assume that you can do in college, to be able to write well.  One outside thing I would recommend you learn how to do is how to use a spreadsheet program. I'm always amazed how many Freshmen can't plot data on an Excel plot.  Personally, before college, I got a 5 on both AP Calc BC and AP Physics C: Mechanics, (that was a very good year for me, test wise), I knew one programming language, Python, and I had done some robotics using Mindstorms NXT. If you're doing a robotics club, then you'll probably know more than I did leaving high school, because I didn't do anything with traditional robotics until my Sophomore year of college in a tech elective."
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,KaptainKielbasa,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:23:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you. Also I am usually fine, I wrote this last night in the middle of a sprout of worrying about going into engineering."
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,Oxidation_State,2,Fri Jun 19 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"Which robotics team? A lot of experience from my high school robotics team carried very well into my first few years at uni. The experience secured my first internship under a rival robotics team's coach as well as my position on the Universe Rover Challenge team.   Otherwise, don't start off with 8am classes.    Don't feel obligated to stay friends with crappy people because they are the first ones you met. There are a ton of great people out there, no need to bog yourself down with crappy ones."
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,KaptainKielbasa,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:07:15 2015 UTC,"Just one that I am starting from the ground up as we just got a VEX kit this year. Also thanks, I was feeling like I was going to have to suffer though that."
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,vilemuse,2,Fri Jun 19 22:42:38 2015 UTC,"I came in with AP Calc BC and AP Physics C so I had a lot of the math and physics but almost no engineering. No robotics, no project lead the way, not even drafting class.   Another one I would recommend is teaching yourself a bit of programming. If you're going to do Electrical (like me, sorry haven't got a flair up and I'm on mobile) or Computer, teaching yourself a bit of C is a fantastic way to get a bit of leverage. Otherwise maybe learn Java? There's tons of us non-digital EEs, MEs, and others who work for companies that like to build programs to automate tasks. That's useful.  If you can't use excel, you should learn it before school. Makes life a teensy bit easier, maybe not much but I never wasted time in lab formatting graphs.   Also explore your intended major. Investigate sub-areas and learn general knowledge about subjects. I.E. if you're a EE learn about communication systems and magnetism. Don't do all the math and theory, just study basic, vocabulary and applications of the stuff. It will hold your interest better.  For general college stuff, you have an eager attitude and that's great for an incoming freshman.   1) 100% yes, but try to make a showing that you put a lot of effort. Don't rush to the prof and then tell them you didn't look at your textbook.  2) engineering won't be like high school. Sit somewhere that's comfortable. I was front row for a class that used a projector and my eyes were strained the whole term. Sit by people that seem respectful, it won't necessarily be front row.  3) at risk of sounding like a dick, you don't want to be the smartest person in your group. If your major has an area for students to work,try to use it. That's how I made all of my EE friends. Not so applicable freshman year though...  4) you'll hear this and if you're like me you'll resent it. There are times to sink in hard work. There are times its better to call it a night and keep your sanity. Save your class rubrics. If your teachers don't keep grades publicly, make an excel sheet to do it yourself. Typical classes at my school (RHIT, sorry no flair again) only count HW as 10% of your grade. I might be in better off if I hadn't sunk 8 hours into a 3-4 hour assignment. Never don't do HW, but never pull an all nighter to get it done, if that makes sense. Focus on the exams and projects first, they should be your priority.  Otherwise  5) for the love of whatever, don't cheat. Profs are pros at recognizing it. I say this even though it seems so self evident. The temptation will be there, and there are many people that do it. The kids that used solution manuals to get through Calc and DE did the worst on tests. Perfect homework is not worth very much, a perfect exam score is much better.  6) be humble. I had a terrible superiority complex coming into engineering. I bragged about my hard work and success too much. Don't join the ""STEM master race"" crowd and don't get into pissing contests with your classmates. You'll get along with people much easier if you are modest and non-judgemental. You will work harder than other majors, but there's no reason to belittle them for it. I would tell this to any engineering student, there's nothing you said to indicate you have this attitude, but beware not to develop it. Its good to be proud of yourself, but an inflated ego is toxic.  7) keep the perspective that engineering is a long haul. Your four years of undergrad are gruesome and challenging, but they go by quick and the rewards are nice I hear. For me, weeks felt like months and months like weeks, if that makes sense. Basically, on Friday as I was winding down and reflecting, the past five days felt like they took forever, but the month as a whole seemed to be strangely Short. It's a weird feeling that I'm not sure you can prepare for, but don't let it get you down!  Good luck, I'd be happy to answer any other questions!"
EngineeringStudents,3adxoc,vilemuse,3,Fri Jun 19 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"The STEM master race circle jerk is really easy to fall into, especially at Rose where everyone is in STEM.  OP, make friends in your majors and related majors, but also branch out to others. Diversity is invaluable.

Thank you :D A lot of my stuff is very much independently learnt so I feel brushing up in math and physics is a good idea. Although programming just doesn't click for me, I've tried many times. Also what do you need to learn in excel exactly? I'm planning to look more into a intended major in first year as it is a general year. Also I know, I understand the professors time is limited and precious so I will use it when needed, I mean't as in I know not to fear using the office hours and talking with TAs.  Also I am highly introverted and love the back, I want to move to front row for post secondary because then I'll be forced not to think about the lecture size and be more engaged.  Also I don't want to be the smartest, I want to have a group that helps me improve my learning and engagement and I hope to help others with that too.  Also I feel #4 will be the most difficult for me, also based on the information I am given would I actually be able to calculate the grade point?  To cheating I have to say I no chance, I feel I'd be robbing myself of my own education and creating more stress later once you realize you know nothing in the course. Though I will definitely compare my answers to solutions sometimes to check I am grasping it all.  Also I feel I have had an inflated ego a bit because I have a plan for my future more so than most my age, yet every time I read about all these people from AP going into engineering and getting low marks I feel worried so my bubbled has definitely been popped in terms off ""I feel like I have it all together""  Also I have felt that with a rushed week of my online chemistry, I get it. Also co-op extends the degree to five years right?"
EngineeringStudents,3ada30,theflyindumplin,11,Fri Jun 19 04:25:28 2015 UTC,"You can do it with your schedule and classes, but until you really understand the difficulty/time commitments, it might be better to take it easy and figure out what works best for you.  Use your first semester/year to ease into college life. Its different.   You know whats worse than graduating in 5 years? Dropping out after 5 semesters because you burned yourself out."
EngineeringStudents,3ada30,who_dat_who_der,6,Fri Jun 19 04:28:56 2015 UTC,Leave your schedule the way it is now and first get through your first semester before you start adding or dropping classes.  Add more classes for the Spring semester if this one goes fine.
EngineeringStudents,3ada30,Szos,3,Fri Jun 19 09:53:19 2015 UTC,This is highly dependent on the individual school – at my university 4 courses in a semester is a full load. I'd ask on your own university's subreddit.

EngineeringStudents,3ada30,THedman07,2,Sat Jun 20 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"Imo, an engineering program is like a marathon. You have to pace yourself and try to finish strong. Some students have a hard time with 5 classes each semester, others don't. So what, the important is that you complete it eventually. I mean, what's 1 or 2 more years if you expect to live about 60 more years?  Personally, I only took 3 classes during my 1st semester while many of my friends took 4 or 5 (5 is considered full time in our system). Guess what, so many of them failed at least 1 weed-out class while I got 3 A+. I'm not saying that it's impossible to get only A+ with 4-6 classes, it's just much more complicated especially during the first year."
EngineeringStudents,3ada30,Joskilatrix,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:32:55 2015 UTC,"Physics 1 is usually in there the first semester. Getting physics 1 and 2 out of the way in the first year is fairly important because they are probably prerequisites for your sophomore year classes. You might be OK if you take summer semesters too.   Also, that looks like 10 hours or so, which may not even qualify you as a full time student."

EngineeringStudents,3ah3d3,Gyang193,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"I see this question a ton, especially on my school's engineering society's Facebook page. I always have approached grades by asking myself these questions:  Did you pass, and get credit for the course? Do you understand everything from your coursework well enough to do what you want to do after you graduate? Do you have a working knowledge of things that enables you to learn more advanced things later?   AND, if you want to do grad school right after university: are your grades good enough to communicate the right level of understanding for your application to grad school?  If you answered yes to all of those, you're good to go. Who really cares about your grades after that? In my opinion, past about a C+/low B, there's not much difference in understanding in terms of practical application - the only difference was that someone who gets an A vs. a B is the time studied.   However, if you have a low GPA, I'd highly recommend having some order sorts of experience to back your resume up. If all you have is a shit GPA on your resume and no internships/clubs/professional development activities/etc, that's not great.  I know many folks who get hired at great companies not because of their GPA, but what else they did during their degree. Hackathons, being a campus leader and impacting their peers through student government, student design teams, personal projects, and other things like that look great on a resume. One of my friends is a current engineering intern at Tesla and whilst his GPA or academic transcript isn't the prettiest thing you've seen, he's doing quite well there and got hired because of what he's done outside of the classroom.  TL;DR What you do outside of the classroom can get you hired, and GPA aint that important as long as you graduate and have engineering skills by the time you do graduate."
EngineeringStudents,3adleu,mandzhalas,24,Fri Jun 19 06:39:52 2015 UTC,So you want to get an engineering tattoo before you even started classes? Not really a smart move. I'd wait you finished.
EngineeringStudents,3adleu,tooyoung_tooold,5,Fri Jun 19 13:59:12 2015 UTC,"""I want tattoo that will remind me never give up and always do my best.""  This is a great idea, and it will apply to so many things in your life outside of engineering. I would focus on this aspect of what you want, and not on it being an engineering / bio-mechanics based design.  If you really want something engineering related, then I would recommend waiting at least until you've completed your engineering program. My own concept of what an engineer is and how I feel about the field changed drastically over the course of my undergrad education, and it's shifted even more since entering the industry."

Anyway, for the tattoo, I guess you could get something like this."
EngineeringStudents,3adleu,encapsulationdot1q,3,Fri Jun 19 07:08:00 2015 UTC,"Hating maths with a passion at school does not mean (s) he will hate maths in university/college.  Its a very different experience when you understand the reasons behind learning maths.   I find maths very difficult and its hard to enjoy something that requires a real effort on my part to learn but the end pay off is worth it and the satisfaction of knowing I have learnt something I previously found so difficult can really help with motivation.  Edit:  However i would also say if your not sure what to get as a tattoo,  don't get one at all. It is permanent and its not worth it to get one just for the sake of getting one.

EngineeringStudents,3acv2p,queen_of_mars,2,Fri Jun 19 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"Luckily once you've spent a few years out of high school, your high school grades don't really mean much anymore. I had terrible grades in high school, but I spent a few years working. I also got an associates degree totally unrelated to engineering before I decided to be an engineer. I ended up taking a few classes each semester at a local community college while working and eventually transfered to the university I'm attending now.  Taking your prerequisites at a CC will help you a ton, because colleges only really look at the your grades from the latest school you've attended. Also, I would avoid online classes if possible. I was looking to transfer to GA Tech for ME, and they wouldn't award credit for anything taken online. Just make sure whatever CC you choose has classes that will actually transfer to most schools! (You can call their admissions department or check their website). Getting A's and B's for 2 or 3 semesters will show the university that you're not a lazy kid anymore and you've grown up. Additionally, it's MUCH easier to get into schools as a transfer student. It's a lot less stringent. Your experience as an electrician will help you too, because it shows hands-on experience with something engineering related and a good work ethic.  I know that's a lot, but hope that helps. I've dug myself out of a similar hole, and I was able to get into a very good engineering school. If you're this excited to get started, you'll be fine."

Talk to an advisor at whatever school you want to end up at and see which classes you can transfer. It will improve your GPA, be significantly easier, and a lot cheaper. I'm not sure how admission will work after you've been out of school for a while. Check with wherever you're applying. You might even be able to get some kind of credit for having so much relevant work experience."

Your first two years are generally the classes everyone takes than by your third year, you'll get into your true core classes."
EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,axendrale,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:06:34 2015 UTC,I had zero free summers after I started college.  The most easy going was between freshman year and sophomore year where I only took one class and just hung out at home otherwise. After that it was working or full time school. Spending my summer before freshman year doing absolutely nothing productive was the best idea ever.
EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,partyhazardanalysis,3,Fri Jun 19 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"Focus on time management. If you're in res, there's going to be a lot of fun things going on there, and around the rest of the campus. Being able to do those as well as manage your courseload will make the next 4/5 years so much more rewarding. If you have your schedule now (including midterms and stuff) start to look it over and pick maybe 1-2 hours a day (which will obviously change later, as you realize the required workload for the courses) that you can block off as study time. This might seem like overkill, and it might be to a lot of people, but speaking as someone who did fuck all in HS, it really helped me out."
EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,TheMeaning0fLife,2,Fri Jun 19 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help!  It might be a stupid question, but what is ""res"" ?"

EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,TheMeaning0fLife,2,Fri Jun 19 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with taking fewer courses only if the credits he's taking now aren't mandatory. In my first semester, we had no choice in the courses we could take, and not taking one would have put you at a disadvantage in the following semesters.

EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,koolaidman47,2,Fri Jun 19 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"Even within the USA, schools have varying ways of counting credits so confusion abounds. I have a friend, a (American & Canadian Citizenship) who goes to U Waterloo in Ontario and his schedule is more or less set by the school.

Just know that at this point, school isn't about how smart you are anymore. With a basic high school science understanding, I think anyone can get an engineering degree if you dedicate your life to it and work harder than you ever expected. Embrace the challenge, start studying for exams early, and stay positive. It'll all be worth it!"

Of course you can get a PhD and do research for a company, making location something you shouldn't have to worry about.

Places you can find entry level chemical engineering jobs: Gulf Coast cities like Pensacola, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Mobile, Houston; Charelston, Fairfax, Richmond, LA, Chicago, Atlanta, Huntsville, San Francsico, Colorado Springs, among others. Once you get beyond entry level, it widens to even more places.   Of course, if you get to senior year with no experience, mediocre grades, and zero campus leadership, you'll probably end up in some middle of nowhere town working at a paper company or something unless you have a serious network to work with.

(Heat transfer is normally the second most painful unit, for the record)  Also, teach yourself some basic programming if you don't know how to already."
EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,Convulsed,2,Fri Jun 19 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would drop the honors program. It really doesn't mean anything in college and you will have a higher GPA not taking honors courses."

EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,Convulsed,4,Fri Jun 19 00:08:13 2015 UTC,"GPA matters, don't let anyone fool you. For me it determined whether I got into my major. But even if your school doesn't work that way, the higher your GPA, the better your chances of getting your first picks of research, internships, first job, and most importantly, grad school. I guess if you just want to put in your four years then make a livable wage, it might be less important."
EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,wutnowsucka,2,Fri Jun 19 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"Well experience matters the most, but it is better to have a higher GPA than a lower one with honors.   Also, obligatory fuck Tennessee and Anchor Down!"
EngineeringStudents,3ac4le,partyhazardanalysis,3,Fri Jun 19 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"And when you don't have experience, your GPA is often what gets you that first experience.  As a graduating ChemE, let me say: be awesome at Algebra, Excel, and MATLAB, and you'll be way ahead of the curve.  And get involved with organizations and activities soon so you have something to put on your resume, but  don't rush into commitments your first semester. Focus on preserving your GPA your first year so you get scholarships and good internship opportunities."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,SalvadorDali8,11,Thu Jun 18 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"For many schools calc 2 is the weed-out math class. They basically shove all the specifics you should know for all of calculus integration and derivation into the course then add series.  Calc 3 is much easier, in my opinion just as easy as calc 1 if not more so.  Just stick it out through calc 2 and you should be fine."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,AuroraFinem,5,Thu Jun 18 17:19:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Of all the pure math classes I've had to take, the most demanding was cal 2. I knew that coming into it so I took it by itself for summer. I'll never forget when the professor worked out a very involved trigonometric substitution problem on the boards ( took more than one board!)then turned back at us, saw the looks on our faces and said ""Welcome to the big leagues""  That was the only semester where I wasn't full time but it paid off with an A. Cal 3 is cake, DifEq is even easier, and linear Algebra was a total joke. Dedicate the time and you'll get through it."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,mannyfiu12,4,Thu Jun 18 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"I'll never understand why some people think that DiffEq is a joke... I took the pure math version (as opposed to the one tailored for engineers) and I died. The class was full of math majors and the class averages were in the 40s... Very different from when I took calc II, where the averages were in the 90s even with ridiculously difficult exams."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,mrchutotoro,3,Thu Jun 18 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"My school doesn't offer an engineering version, or my major isn't supposed to take it, but the board long problems that guy was talking about, we have to do multiple of those on each homework assignment. It fucking kills me."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,DragleicPhoenix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:43:04 2015 UTC,How is diff eq so easy? I'm taking it now and it sucks. Maybe because prof won't let us use calculators
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,sideoftheham,2,Fri Jun 19 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's 'relatively' easy compared to classes like Dynamics and Thermo.

EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,admiralbonesjones,2,Fri Jun 19 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"At my school it's Calc 3 that gets everyone. Calculus 1, 2 ,and differential equations really aren't that hard. These were all engineering math classes though."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,MiddleClassSeaBass,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"That makes me feel pretty good then. I knew the class was hard but taking it over the summer it just seemed to fly by. I probably spent 10 hours a week on homework plus 5 hours in class for 9 weeks.  I only got a C because I bombed my first test before everything started to gel together, but I'm glad it's over with."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,varisforge,14,Thu Jun 18 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"Do you want to stay in engineering?  Personally, I couldn't stand my prerequisite classes. I'm dreading the last math class I have to take in the fall. I got Cs in calc 1 and 2, and gen chem, and a C- in physics 2.  Once I got past the majority of my basic classes and was able to start taking more applied classes like statics, mechanics of materials, and intro to mse, my grades went way up. Calc 2 probably isn't the hardest class you'll take, but my trouble with math classes is how god damn tedious they are. I absolutely hate doing three pages of integrals, trying to understand sequences or matrices or whatever ever bullshit I have to do in the fall. I can't stand it. Even if a class is harder, it won't be as bad for me because it'll be material that actually has a use, it's not just difficult for the sake of being difficult."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,sxeQ,2,Thu Jun 18 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"I've had the same problems. I really don't like the way most schools approach intro math classes. I think that the classes would be much more useful if they were more targeted to the students taking them. It's much more interesting to solve calculus problems that have something to do with what you're studying.   I've also never really had a math professor whose methods I've liked. They've all seemed far too impractical for my tastes, or they've made the material much harder than it actually is."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,Adam5400,4,Thu Jun 18 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"Calc 2 is just one of the hard courses that you have to do in your list of required hard courses. Once you do enough hard courses, you get use to only doing hard courses. That actually engineering school in a nut shell, you just do so much hard shit, it becomes the new normal.  So no Calc 2 isn't the hardest course you will take, it is just preparation to make you man enough to do harder courses like chem thermo, transport phenomena, or mass transfer."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,ktgster,6,Thu Jun 18 18:25:41 2015 UTC,Stick with it! Cal III is definitely a hard class but to me it felt like the last hard math class I took. Once you get to Diff Eq math is a breeze.
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,yazmincha,2,Thu Jun 18 16:46:38 2015 UTC,Can you talk to me about differential equations? I'm not sure if I should take it this semester. I just took calc II
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,Darth_drizzt_42,4,Thu Jun 18 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Diff Eq is typically calc 4, with multivariable being calc 3. Diff Eq is simply different methods for solving equations, with the vast majority being along the lines of ""differentiate these things this many times and plug back in"". After calc 2 and 3 the majority of my class found it realatively simple and it was the first calc class where i got A's on my exams."
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,rkkrqqqqrssss,2,Thu Jun 18 20:19:56 2015 UTC,Can agree! I found ODE to be the easiest out of all the calculus courses.
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,FuttJohn,2,Thu Jun 18 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"Totally stick with it, I was in a similar situation as you. Took calc II twice and passed the second time.

EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,BlackholeZ32,2,Thu Jun 18 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"I can't stand online classes. They just don't work for me. Calc 2 is designed to be tough, because you need to have it nailed. You will be using that material in everything from now on. Can you take it in person?"
EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,BlackholeZ32,3,Thu Jun 18 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, I signed up for a 6 week course starting July 1st. Hopefully the professor goes easy on us because of the shortened semester."

EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,mythic94,2,Fri Jun 19 06:26:41 2015 UTC,I'd say stick it out. I took calc 2 this spring and 50s and 60s on all test but one but managed to pass with a C. Not to mention that the final exam average was like a 52. Taking it during a longer semester may help you out. The hardest part of the class is the series section. After that the material is much easier.

As an EE I was required to take quantum mechanics and our 4th physic class. I barely got a C. Very difficult and has almost nothing to do with what I am currently doing, software.

EngineeringStudents,3aavdc,Klarkson1273,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know what specifically you do in those lines of work because that's not my line of study, but as an Enviro student I've taken some water / air chemistry and mass transfer courses. Those classes do typically involve setting up and solving differential equations in order to solve problems. Since you're in chemical engineering, I'm assuming you guys do something similar at some point.   That being said, virtually everything you do in calc I, II, III can be solved by programs these days. Set up a differential equation that would take 5 hours to solve by parts? Cool, toss that guy in MatLab or Maple and it'll spit out an answer in a few seconds.   The point I'm trying to get at is: you sound like you've got a lot of interest in the field, and you shouldn't let a prereq course stand in your way of achieving it. If you take the course agin and wind up with a 50% (or whatever your school requires as a passing grade), that's fine. You've passed it and you know that if you ever come across it in the field there are means to solving it simply. Take the course again, do your best, and as long as you've passed, you've succeeded. There's tons of good references online you can use to help study, and you're welcome to PM me along the way if you have any questions (I did pretty well (90%+) in all of the calc courses).   TL;DR: Don't let a stupid prereq stress you out. Stay in engineering."

EngineeringStudents,3aah5l,engineerneedhelp,6,Thu Jun 18 14:52:14 2015 UTC,"You'll want to get some experience with FEA software. This can be SAP2000, LARSA, STAAD, whatever. They basically all work the same. You can probably find some of this software at your college's computer lab. I think you can actually download a student version of STAAD.  Also get experience with CAD software. Definitely work on Autocad and Revit if you can. If you're interested in bridges we almost exclusively use Microstation.  Get whatever relevant experience you can. I was captain of our ASCE steel bridge team during my undergrad and I made a lot of great professional contacts and learned a lot about actual design work.  Get familiar with the code books. There's a lot.  Timber = NDS, Masonry = MSJC (I think?), Steel = AISC, Concrete = ACI, Bridge = AASHTO. Know mechanics of materials like the back of your hand. I really can't stress how important that class is to gaining intuitive knowledge on how different materials work, why code is the way it is, when elastic/nonelastic conditions apply, the way stresses develope in a member, etc... When you take your design classes make sure you spend the time to learn about serviceability checks. They tend to control the designs more often than not (especially in concrete) and it seemed like this was a big missing part of my design classes.    I'm not really sure what else I'm missing. Having good grades doesn't matter as much as really understanding your subject matter. If you can visualize load paths, deflections, moment diagrams, and then be able to put that into words during your interviews to actually show that you know what's going on and relate to your interviewer a bit then you'll be in good shape.   Another good one:   Learn how to design actual components (when you get to that point in your education).  You'll go through your design classes learning beams, columns, fasteners, but that only accounts for 5% of what you're going to see.  Find out how to design a deck, a footing, or a wall.  One thing that I got knocked on during my interview was that I couldn't say I knew how to design a typical deck or something.  There's a lot of sources out there that'll give you a step-by-step example on how to design these things."

My father is a P.E. that has a lot of structural backings himself, so maybe that is why I'm fond of it out of comfort. I would ask why you couldn't do both. Having an engineer that understand how the field workers think and work is extremely valuable to the project, imo. I work at a roofing company while I finish up my Civil Degree, but I get to talk/listen to the workers and understand where they have issues with designs and how things could have been done more efficiently. So, I would say start in the construction side and learn on the job stuff and then slide over to structural after. As far as programs are concerned, Revit seems to be a fan favorite around here. I would also say that Autodesk's Steel (?) sounds pretty cool to work with. Basic ACAD would be a necessity as well as really understanding excel to be able to write some very useful spreadsheets."
EngineeringStudents,3aah5l,Squirmols,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:02:12 2015 UTC,AutoCAD is always good to know as a civil engineer.

I am focused in structural engineering at school and the software we use extensively is SAP2000. I'm not sure what the industry standard is but the others that come to mind is RISA-3D and STAAD.Pro.   You should know how to use AutoCAD or Microstation and a professor told me that Revit skills will boost your chances of landing jobs.   School won't teach you every software that you might need so it's up to you to learn it. My advise is to get a trial version and play around with it. Use textbook examples to guide you.   Finite element analysis of structures is a really cool course because there are no indeterminate structures and the hardest part is setting up your matrices correctly.   Foundation engineering will require a different mindset than what you might be used to because it is so empirical and requires a ton of assumptions when you don't have information."

EngineeringStudents,3aari2,Gyang193,2,Thu Jun 18 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"Although I can't answer your main question, I can give a little perspective on grad school vs undergrad. If you're interested in going into more in-depth technical work, I really do recommend a masters. The courses I've taken in grad school really pulled undergrad together for me and have helped me understand technical problems and how to solve them better. You focus more on where everything comes from, which lets you pull knowledge together from your subjects better. Is it necessary? I can't say, I'm just a student, and I've heard both ends of the argument. But my personal experience has been very good.  More specific to you, I have a few (albeit subjective, YMMV) thoughts. For one, I always see it as impressive to go back to school at a later age. It shows commitment and genuine interest, especially since you already have two degrees. Not everyone has the motivation to go back, and I think most people would agree that it says something. Second, from experience I've met a few non-traditional students and they are usually very successful, approaching college as a job and are more efficient in getting work done. So hopefully if you are at all nervous these two help a little.  Third, I think before worrying about a masters you should see where the bachelors takes you. Your opinions may change drastically in 2-3 years. I definitely didn't plan on a PhD when I started my undergrad, I didn't even know if I'd get a masters. Not that it's a bad thing to look ahead, but at least for me I've just taken things as they come and it's worked out so far. Your professors may have contacts in the fields you're interested in, and they can definitely talk to you and answer your question. Hope this helps."

If you're learning something new, the card will keep showing up a lot early on until you're comfortable with it, and then crop up occasionally when the algorithm thinks you're about to forget it.  So, rather than re-learning, try to devote some regular time to not forgetting.  EDIT: I think I first heard about this here.

EngineeringStudents,3a8pon,respect_cat,2,Thu Jun 18 04:29:12 2015 UTC,"Good textbooks often have spaced repetition designed into them (I think the pedagogical term is called scaffolding in that context), but this scaffolding is often lost when uni courses just overviews of topics in order to move on to the next.   I've been working linearly through ch 13 to 18 of Stewart's Calculus for the last 6 months, doing about 80% of the problems (every odd numbered plug n chugg, and attempting almost all challenge/application questions - I have the luxury of time at the moment). I'm in Ch 17, vector calculus, at the moment, and it's really good to be repeating practice for many of the methods and ideas that were covered in Ch 13 and 14 (Vector Operations and Vector Functions), as well as lots of the concepts from Ch 15 and 16, Partial Derivs and Multiple Integrals; it all seems to be coalescing into exercises where ALL of the previous ideas are applied.  Stewart's has really good scaffolding, but you need the luxury of time to take advantage of it."

EngineeringStudents,3a8pon,respect_cat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"I am not able to give any kind of expert opinion.   I took both advanced math units in HS (Math B/C - Australian standard) getting very good grades in both, and then I saw some hodge-podge calculus and linear algebra here and there in a few math units I took alongside my Chem degree from about 7 years ago.   Last year I worked through all of this text for calc I and II, and I think it was quite lacking. I wouldn't recommend it in retrospect. But then it's tailored to the California curriculum for HS students...  I am working through Stewart's now as part of a preliminary self-study regiment before returning to uni Feb of next year for a BS in Electrical Engineering. MIT open course ware units on Matlab and Linear Algebra and Knight's College Physics are also featuring in this plan, along with some possible Python study and playing with some Arduino.   I find Stewart's to be good for me and my purposes. I have the time, I have some real self-discipline (finally), and did well in advanced math units in HS; I guess you could call it some natural ability as well. I am covering everything in a linear fashion, not picking and choosing.   I've heard it criticized, primarily that the text escalates the difficulty of the exercises too rapidly throughout a given section. I feel like there is some truth to this criticism, but also that it may stem from TAs or lecturers who want something better suited to less in depth overviews, for incorporation into something less math-intensive. Again, I can't be sure.   In many reviews Adam's text on calculus is more highly praised. From a brief perusal in the uni library I haven't found much difference between it and Stewart's."
EngineeringStudents,3a8pon,autowikibot,4,Thu Jun 18 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"Spaced repetition:       Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. Alternative names include spaced rehearsal, expanding rehearsal, graduated intervals, repetition spacing, repetition scheduling, spaced retrieval and expanded retrieval.   Although the principle is useful in many contexts, spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts in which a learner must acquire a large number of items and retain them indefinitely in memory. It is therefore well suited for the problem of vocabulary acquisition in the course of second language learning, due to the size of the target language's inventory of open-class words.

I've always considered being wrong as an easier way of learning, sort of as negative feedback.  Like, I'm given a problem and I immediately go for a solution. Work all the way through making assumptions along the way and end up incorrect. Then I get to backtrack through the problem to find out where I messed up, and since I'm already familiar with the concepts (because I've taken the class) I can spot the problem in my assumptions, and find out where I lack the intuition. Be it in the actual concept of what is happening, or a silly calculus mistake.  Being wrong, and knowing you're wrong (this is the key part), is a better learning tool than being correct 95-100% of the time every time and not know which mistakes you're prone to make."

The best way to retain the content is to understand the content, rather than temporarily memorize it. Looking bad, the courses I remember best are the ones I had the most difficulty with, and I attribute this to having to fight and struggle with the material until I had a truly solid grasp of what was going on with it.

Hell, we frequently get transfers who come in with all their GEs completed that still take five years on top of their community college degree to graduate (although that part about the GEs doesn't really mean anything at my school).  I'd really talk to the advisors at your prospective school about building a three year plan, and ask about priority registration opportunities and how many classes you'll be able to fail without being pushed back, because managing that is going to be the hardest part of your degree."

EngineeringStudents,3a9x51,rmate,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:43:28 2015 UTC,"The trick for this kind of question is to do an atomic/elemental balance for each element present (excluding ash ofc).  Looking at carbon: 1 mole of Carbon in coal = 1xMoles of CO2 + 1xMole of CO  For Hydrogen: 1 mole H = 2xMoles of H2O (Combustion produces water)  For Oxygen: 1 mole O = 2xMoles of CO2 + 1xMoles of CO + 2xMoles of O2 + 1xMoles of H2O  I find for diatomic gases that doing an elemental mole balance (i.e. on O, not O2) helps avoid confusion.  Also, make for yourself a stoichiometric table like so:    Species In [mol] Change [mol] Out [mol]    Species 1 80 extent of reaction*stoichiometric coefficient In+Change   Species 2 60 "" ""   Species 3 20 "" ""   Species N X "" ""   Total 80+60+20+...+X Sum Sum    Later on, you can add another column to each of those columns detailing the enthalpy changes, when you get to it. As for help with this question, I suggest taking a basis of 100 kmols of flue gas produced (As volume % = mole %), then using your carbon+oxygen+hydrogen balances to figure out the rest of the questions.

I really liked Calc 2, but it was at times very dense and packing all that info into 5 and a half weeks seems insane to me. There are some techniques like integration by parts that require some time to get used to and that short period of time doesn't seem adequate to have it all set in. Then again, if you really love math and you are willing to put in a ton of extra effort to learn integration in less than half the time most people do, by all means go for it.    My program requires I go up to Calc 2   No linear algebra or diffeqs? You don't have to do series and sequences? What's your major?"

It was super shitty, but I just went back out there as soon as I knew. During finals week (Last week for me) I was out there looking for anything. I actually landed a decent job and thought I'd share my experience with you OP. I made sure that my resume was of course up to date and visited a local staffing agency. They were able to place me in an admin assistant position in the engineering department of a pretty decent size structural engineering company. I work closely with the VP of Engineering on various tasks, some engineering related ( Beam deflection and hardness testing) and other clerical stuff like meeting with project managers and updating spreadsheets. It's not $25 an hour like I was offered with my internship, but at $14 an hour full time plus an hour or so of OT per day, it's not awful money. Try to do something like that. Just being in an engineering environment and being a sponge is pretty great. I don't have a ton of a responsibility loaded on me, but I get some of the perks that a proper engineering intern would get. Put yourself out there, be humble, and you'll be fine.   To add to that, you still got a chance to talk to more potential employers at your school's fall career fair! In my experience last year, there were plenty of companies looking to set up interviews for new hires right there on the spot. It was kind of strange, seeing as how it was fall, but it might end up being the same for you."

They actually had difficulty with the algebra part: simplifying an equation, transforming an equation, isolating a variable, finding the roots of an equation, dealing with imaginary numbers, being lost when there are many negatives, etc.  It's as if they forgot almost everything they learned in math courses in high school. It's very surprising.  Imo, I think that being really good at basic algebra is a must for any engineering student. It means that you can grasp much faster any new concept and you have a much easier time during assignment but especially during exams."

What part of robots or space aircrafts do you want to work on? No engineering happens outside of a team and each team is responsible for different aspects of the final product. I would also suggest that whatever you pick make sure you like the general job enough that you can deal with not getting your dream job I.e. You want to work on the electrical subsystem of robots so you get an electrical engineering degree. Now you graduated and weren't able to break into robotics but you're still satisfied doing power for a chemical company.

EngineeringStudents,3a970m,stowxzee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:47:03 2015 UTC,"Based on this drawing, I'm thinking Sway due to the lack of rigid connections in the corners. From what I gathered form Structures last semester, we would draw the squares in the corners to symbolize a rigid frame then it would be considered sway. Without showing the corners as rigid that would be my thoughts. Not sure about the pinned connections in the interior of it though. Those wont allow it to ""move"" left or right."
EngineeringStudents,3a970m,Squirmols,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:56:47 2015 UTC,A frame will always have sidesway unless it is shown explicitly that there is a support to prevent the sidesway. Frames that have no sidesway are treated as beams.   If those supports on the girder are pins then your structure does not have sidesway. If its a roller then there is sidesway.

EngineeringStudents,3a9rek,fishbaderqaderqa,2,Thu Jun 18 10:27:38 2015 UTC,"I'd go with studying for the classes, even if it isn't much. I did this last summer with one class. I didn't have all the material down, and I think I only got through half the material before giving up, but it made it easier to learn once the class started and laid a good foundation that I could use for later. The class had all the notes and materials publicly available, so I did that. I would suggest looking online for a Physics 2 Lecture series with some problems attached, since that's a common class everywhere. I don't know how something like Dynamics works since I'm an EE, but that might be worth looking into as well.   I don't really think it's worth learning MATLAB. You'll learn all the functions you need in class probably. You may be able to do both, learn the basics of MATLAB and study for a class.   But that's just my two cents. You have always have the option to rest up this summer."
EngineeringStudents,3a9rek,rogerrrr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:00:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't study over the summer. Would you go through the first few weeks of class? That would only help until the class catches up to you, and then you're back where you started.  If you want to do something engineering related this summer I'd suggest learning a programming language like python. Most of the stuff you learn will be transferable to your MATLAB work and in your career ahead."

It's great for engineers that aren't software engineers because it's pretty easy to get started and does a lot of things in a simpler way than other languages do. If you're interested / adept at programming I HIGHLY recommend it. When you start working you will have an insanely high leg up over everyone else with a bit of programming in your background.  I suggest codeacademy as a good resource to learn it, but there are tons of other places. Let me know if you have any questions."

EngineeringStudents,3a70b7,LA_Melendez,6,Wed Jun 17 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"First off, engineering management is not simply management of engineers as many in this thread suggest. It is about applying engineering principles to the management of systems, processes, etc.  You aren't so much a manager, you're just an industrial engineer for the modern world.   Yes, there is project management and team aspects to it, but you're really being prepared to apply an engineering mindset to an information age environment. You're going to be concerned with not only design but reliability, sustainability, control, optimization, and yes, manageability.  The name throws a lot of people off, and I personally think it is a poor representation of those kinds of programs.  Read some of the research posted by ASEM to get an idea of what kind of research work is being done in this field.  Since youre applying to grad school, look at the library website to find dissertations and thesis written by prior students.  If you find yourself intrigued, you might have found your calling.  I say if it interests you, go for it.  EDIT: I should mention, I have an engineering management degree myself.  Actually, one and a half if you count my doctoral work.  Not only was I offered a job before graduation, I have consistently had opportunities for advancement.  Sometimes even in favor of my contemporaries with electrical, mechanical, and civil backgrounds.  Happy to tell you more about my experience with EM programs or careers if you have questions."
EngineeringStudents,3a70b7,SnakeFarmer,2,Wed Jun 17 23:46:55 2015 UTC,"Really good comment here, thanks for giving this a look. I'm already kind of leaning towards the EM Master's program, and I personally find myself enjoying some of the finance work from the business students. If you don't mind me asking,   you're really being prepared to apply an engineering mindset to an information age environment. You're going to be concerned with not only design but reliability, sustainability, control, optimization, and yes, manageability.   You mind expanding a bit on what you meant here? Sorry if it's a silly thing to point out.  Also, mind expanding a bit on what you've actually been doing in your workplace (wherever you are)? What kind of jobs have you been exposed to with that degree? What do you find yourself doing the most?  Programming? Hardware design? Finance? Personnel Management?  Etc, etc."
EngineeringStudents,3a70b7,SnakeFarmer,2,Thu Jun 18 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"Well, once upon a time, when scientific management was just getting started with guys like Frederick Winslow Taylor and pals, the problems that were being examined were still at their core about efficiency and human interface.  There's the story about Taylor noticing trends in how workers shoveled coal into a furnace through time and motion study, for example.  Long and short of it, Taylor figured out the optimal weight for shoveling was like 21 pounds or something and so designed shovels that would hold about that much coal in an effort to maximize worker output.  Those kinds of problems still exist today, but in different forms.  Engineers want the most output with the least input.      I work for a large telecom company right now where I do something similar.  It is my job to identify areas where I can save the company a buck, improve the customer experience, or eliminate a potential failure risk.  I obviously can't get too detailed here, but I do a lot of simulation, statistical analysis, and general number crunching.  I design our work flows, our processes, and I am even tasked with ensuring we are in compliance with standards and laws.  Unlike Taylor, I no longer have to sit around and watch a guy while holding a stop watch (they hate that, by the way...).  I get all the data I could ever hope for automatically, now that I helped build the system to compile it.  I make decisions every day that might change one tiny thing about how we work that, when compounded over all employees, might save a few hundred thousand man hours.  It is pretty cool.    Prior to this, I worked in project management for data center build outs.  I didn't much care for it, to be honest.  My job was to make sure we got the job done on time and on budget.    I did failure analysis for a power company in the north east for a little while.  I got to dick around and take apart sump pumps for transformer vaults and figure out why they failed, how they failed, and when they might fail.  In that particular instance, my findings lead to changes in how technicians service the vaults.    I also worked for a large shipping company.  I was in charge of projecting anticipated package volume and then assigning delivery drivers to routes.  If I was wrong, it was my ass.  I relied on historical data, current events, and some fancy stats to get it right.  I actually had a role in developing those routes.  I would ride along with the drivers, do some number crunching on the way, and then make changes as necessary.  If I can shave 30 seconds off how long it takes you to start the truck, or find the correct package, or whatever, I've earned my salary.  Not all of it is numbers, though.  I can look at your delivery metrics all day and not understand that the reason you always deliver late to a specific house is because there is a mean ass dog in the yard.  You only get that information from the driver or a ride along.    I'm a PhD student right now, and I'm still trying to nail down my dissertation topic.  I am pretty sure I'm going to looking at agricultural supply chain issues, though.    If any of that sounds interesting to you, look in to Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering as well as Engineering Management programs."
EngineeringStudents,3a70b7,partyhazardanalysis,2,Thu Jun 18 02:03:09 2015 UTC,Can you explain how this differs from industrial engineering?
EngineeringStudents,3a70b7,SnakeFarmer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:54:50 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of overlap.  In fact, in many cases, the systems and EM programs roll up under the IE department, which is currently the case at my university. If I want to take an EM class, it will be listed as IE5649 or whatever.  Hell, even if you look up IE on wikipedia.  ""Industrial engineering may also be known as, or overlap with, operations management, management science, operations research, systems engineering, management engineering, manufacturing engineering, ergonomics or human factors engineering, safety engineering, or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user.""  I think the biggest difference is that systems and EM are more holistic in their approach, and lean a little heavier on simulation, statistics, and engineering economics.  When I describe either of them, I usually refer to them in relation to IE since so many more people are familiar with that.  Courseload is a little different.  IE seems to be built around the assumption of operating within a production environment like in manufacturing.   Tldr, very similar and overlapping."

EngineeringStudents,3a70b7,SnakeFarmer,2,Wed Jun 17 19:14:07 2015 UTC,"Although I completely disagree with the first half of this (see my post below), there is value in working a few years.

There is still some engineering involved, usually calculations and looking up specifications/codes. You are dealing with people most of the time. From what I have seen, most project managers go for their PE instead of masters.

If you want to shoot for a specific job, call up a few people who have that job, find out what skills they use / how they got where they are now, and align your degree pursuits with their's.  I would also avoid allowing whether you think a class might be enjoyable or not to influence your decision. Classes suck until they don't. You should expect each class to be a mind-numbing grind, and be pleasantly surprised when the material and presentation are engaging.   Also, go hokies! Great school :D  P.S.

Anyways, to make it short, I can't really help you decide since I know too little about these fields and don't want to steer you the wrong way. However I just wanted to give some advice. In my opinion, it's fine that you don't know which specific one you wanna go to yet. Like you said, we're lucky that we get a year to kinda think about it. My advice would be to use that year, get to know what the school's like. It's gonna be a somewhat big change. While you're at school, see if you can get to know some people who are ME/EE/Civil/Aero majors. Talk to them, ask them how they like it, how classes are like, etc etc. I know you're trying to reach out to people who are already in this major by posting here, but it would be better if you actually asked the people in our school. At the very worst, when you still haven't decided and the day you need to decide by is coming up, there are lots of professors and people who can really help you. You could even talk to the head of each major and see what they have to say, after you explain your situation. Lastly, I lean towards waiting until you get here to decide if needed because when you take the general engineering courses, you'll get a taste of many of the engineering fields, and from there you can actually decide which one you favor the most.  Good luck to you!  -Fellow Hokie"

EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,MrCare4Bearz,10,Wed Jun 17 08:46:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I'm an EE student, final year in the electronics option.  Our core subjects are electric circuits, micro electronic circuits, control systems, signal processing , computer design and low level embedded system programming."
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,Luepin,5,Wed Jun 17 09:04:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, can you give me a brief explanation of what   Micro electronic circuits (To me it sounds like circuits but circuits with smaller components, forgive me if I'm wrong)  and  Low level embedded system programming ( I have no idea haha)  are all about?  Also, how are electrical and electronic different from each other? Do you do any classes on electromagnetism?"
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,Luepin,5,Wed Jun 17 09:17:36 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll break it down.  So you're right, micro electronics is circuits on the smaller scale, we deal with things like bjts and mosfets (CMOS being the current technology). These are the circuits on your computers mother board, inside your smart phone, etc. There are physics courses as well that go into the theory of how these work, semiconductor physics.  Embedded systems are like special dedicated computers that do a single thing, I.e. The computer that controls the traffic lights. Programming these requires interacting at the hardware level so you're either coding in machine language (assembly) which no one really does anymore, or c/c++.  Electrical can be anything from high power to tiny little smart phones. I'm not really familiar with high power, my background would be the smart phone level.  Finally, yes we take 3 electromagnetism courses"
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,mostly-void,2,Wed Jun 17 09:27:30 2015 UTC,"Do you mind me asking, what are the applications of electromagnetism? Where do you use it? I just find magnetism really cool"
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,ohdog,7,Wed Jun 17 10:01:21 2015 UTC,Well a simple answer is wireless communications. First you need to understand how an electromagnetic (radio) wave propagates through space. Then you need to understand how to build antennas that can a) transmit and b) receive this radio wave.
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,speeding_sloth,4,Wed Jun 17 10:23:43 2015 UTC,The whole production process of electricity is based on an electromagnetic principle called induction which is also the working principle of electric Motors on the other end of the grid.
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,asuspower,4,Wed Jun 17 12:13:18 2015 UTC,"Electromagnetism is used in antennas to send information, but it is also a huge headache for more normal electronics. Every electronic device emits EM waves which can disturb other devices. This is called electromagnetic compatibility.  Also, EM is used in electrical motor design and actuator technologies."

EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,the_aura_of_justice,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:05:09 2015 UTC,"Signal integrity:       Signal integrity or SI is a set of measures of the quality of an electrical signal. In digital electronics, a stream of binary values is represented by a voltage (or current) waveform. However, digital signals are fundamentally analog in nature, and all signals are subject to effects such as noise, distortion, and loss. Over short distances and at low bit rates, a simple conductor can transmit this with sufficient fidelity. At high bit rates and over longer distances or through various mediums, various effects can degrade the electrical signal to the point where errors occur and the system or device fails. Signal integrity engineering is the task of analyzing and mitigating these effects. It is an important activity at all levels of electronics packaging and assembly, from internal connections of an integrated circuit (IC),  through the package, the printed circuit board (PCB), the backplane, and inter-system connections.  While there are some common themes at these various levels, there are also practical considerations, in particular the interconnect flight time versus the bit period, that cause substantial differences in the approach to signal integrity for on-chip connections versus chip-to-chip connections.

EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,LouisCowell,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:05:25 2015 UTC,"Electrical can be anything from high power to tiny little smart phones. I'm not really familiar with high power, my background would be the smart phone level.   Then let me add something on the power side. The power side of electrical has more to do with motor drives and electricity systems (both on a big and a small scale). This ranges from power plants to energy management in embedded devices and from large continent wide power distribution to making a drive train for an electric car. Also medical technologies like MRI have a lot of electrical power engineering in them.  The main difference is that in the information side (like communication and information technologies), you are working with more tangible things which may or may not have the capability to kill you."
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,Luepin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:18:42 2015 UTC,"Just out of interest, why does no one code in assembly anymore? I've done a little bit of it and quite enjoyed it."
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,Luepin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:41:00 2015 UTC,because it's easier to code in C or C++ and the control over resources that you gain from assembly isn't really worth it in most cases
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,Unspool,6,Thu Jun 18 07:15:39 2015 UTC,"Oh ya, so labs. We build circuits using tools like function generators and oscilloscopes, We have simulation equipment for control theory, like inverted pendulums and computer labs and boards for doing embedded system programming. Also, there's fpgas if you get into digital circuit design."
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,rkkrqqqqrssss,5,Wed Jun 17 09:07:38 2015 UTC,"Just remember, these classes are not the work you'll be doing if you choose a career in these fields. It is important to think about what work you'd like to do. Classes are just tools and generally software does a lot of the computational work anyway."
EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,rkkrqqqqrssss,2,Wed Jun 17 10:55:56 2015 UTC,"I understand that, the reason I am tempted to switch is that I am under the impression that the career path electrical engineering leads to is more attractive to me. One of the reasons for this is that I find designing mechanical devices intimidating. On the other hand, I have little problem with mathematics. One of the reasons I am considering EE is the larger involvement of Mathematics and Theory.   I'd like to use science to do 'magic', I'd like to use electromagnetic waves to communicate with someone far away. I'd like to know how we store energy and the science behind doing it. I feel like electrical engineering is moreso suited to what I want and enjoy.  There are lots of cool things I can do with a degree in M.E. Perhaps working at a water distribution plant, designing nuclear power plants (strengths of materials wise), helping design an oil platform, making lifts, designing planes maybe even (if I go into aerospace). Or at least being part of the process of all these things. Designing engines using thermodynamics too. There's a lot I can do with M.E but the one problem I have with this is that they all have to do with Mechanics, something I'm not that good at (although moderately interested in). I find that with EE, you're involved 'weirder' and less intuitive concepts,  that make things more interesting"

EngineeringStudents,3a55oo,aa93,5,Thu Jun 18 01:32:19 2015 UTC,"At my school the areas of focus are solid state circuits, microwaves and light waves, signal processing and communications, and computers. Before we can ""specialize"" in any of these areas we have to take some basic circuit theory and analysis classes as well as signals and systems, etc. Not to mention the math classes like linear algebra and complex analysis.  As far as labs go, they come in a few different flavors. First lab is ""build this circuit and see what it does. Is it what you expect from the theory?"" Second lab is ""find the components for this circuit that will make it do x, y, and z. Prove that it does,"" then ""Design a circuit to do x, y, and z, and prove that it works."" Then there are other more specialized labs for digital systems, and finally senior design which is a whole other beast."

The EEs that teach themself a little bit will be able to find work in all software jobs, silicon RTL design (Verilog code), operating system development and things like that which are not really considered EE but those doors will be open to you as well. EE + CE spans the entire spectrum from industrial control to consumer electronics, they can do anything in those fields.

They know that new hires are basically interns, you probably know very little but can learn.  Do a personal project related to your target field or find some club or team at your school. Or do undergraduate research with a professor. You have more options to gain experience, you just have to find them."

It usually lists the minimum or recommended pc requirements there. In general, have at least 4 gb RAM and a decent CPU (like i5). A laptop with dedicated video RAM would be very nice but cost quite a bit more. Size is also a factor; anthing over 15"" might feel too big to carry around. My laptop is 11"", which is a nice screen size for me. Also, if a particular laptop is on mega-sale and there's only a few left, make sure that model doesn't have problems.

EngineeringStudents,3a4o6j,throw_me_away124,29,Wed Jun 17 05:04:21 2015 UTC,"You did not plagiarize by any stretch of the imagination. You've said 'broad picture' discussion is encouraged, as well as using online resources. In terms of ethics, you have nothing to worry about.  My pet turtle was once alleged to have copied programming assignment code from a solution floating around. One could either challenge this assertion (and raise the stakes), or receive a zero on the assignment and move on.   He was suffering from depression and plagiarized because he couldn't handle school at the time. He felt nauseous and suicidal after the notification.   My turtle took the zero, nothing escalated to university level, and ended with an A- in the course.   My point with all this being: your professor doesn't want to fail you or report you for plagiarism. People don't go into academia to power trip. You truly didn't plagiarize. Tell him the truth, show him your commits, and explain to him the resources you used.  If he encouraged, or even required, you to use a public (i.e. free) Github repository, then it's certainly not your fault if friends or classmates copied.   Your professor should dismiss the assertion of plagiarism when he examines your code and you explain yourself. He is already downplaying the accusation by saying the detector isn't foolproof - not the behavior of someone looking to crucify you.  Sorry you have to go through this, it's not right to stress you when it's not your fault."

Leave it at that. If the system is flagging it, you likely have snippets that match someone else's. There's nothing else to do unless the instructor escalates it. If you're being honest in this post I doubt you have anything to worry about. If he was out to get you I he wouldn't tell you in advance while pointing out that the system isn't that accurate, he's just telling you the system flagged it."
EngineeringStudents,3a4o6j,Rhynocerous,4,Wed Jun 17 06:15:55 2015 UTC,Unless entire chunks of your program and/or the whole thing is copied a quick look at your code should make it obvious you didn't plagiarize.

I wasn't sure why I got flagged, but procedure is to have a meeting with one of the dean's to discuss it. Well turns out, I had left my laptop with my code open on campus while I went to get something to eat(was in a lab, where some of my friends were there so it was safe), in that time another student had basically copied all of my code, and used it for their assignment. Luckily the other student confessed Ina separate meeting so I just got a temporary flag on my account (basically it doesn't show on your transcript, but faculty can see it if I ever get in any plagiarism trouble again ) but the other student apparently got failed in the course,  and not sure if it was related but she switched into a business major.

What sort of time frame and budget do you have for your projects? What area of research do you want to do? (Suggesting a Controls project to a mechanical design person wouldn't work)
EngineeringStudents,3a5jzl,MrCare4Bearz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:34:56 2015 UTC,"Our time frame is at most 13 weeks to do research, design and build. The budget it not much but it depends on the project proposal. So I think of low budget since the collage will provide as needed.   My area of research it will be in mostly motor vehicles, but it can be going to oil industry since is a major thing in our region"

EngineeringStudents,3a7xa4,iAmbitionX,3,Wed Jun 17 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think it makes much of a difference. Your grades,  scores, essays and extra curriculars mean more given that you are taking advanced courses either way. Having the community college courses will be much more helpful once you are at a 4 year though. You will have a head start on some pretty tough subjects. This should give you more freedom in your first year to see which engineering field is best for you. You also might even be able to graduate early.   CS has the most internships available by far and is easiest to get jobs. You can do whatever engineering major is most interesting to you. Both ME and EE will be relevant for some time so don't worry too much about that. I would recommend getting some programming experience regardless, as you will have more options for getting real world experience.   Try the early EE classes as you will get a feel for what the major is about pretty early on. I did that and found EE wasn't all that exciting for me and have now focused more on CS. Good luck to ya."

EngineeringStudents,3a34oe,seedragon,26,Tue Jun 16 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think that the FE exam is a joke. Sure its a long exam, but the exam itself takes place on a computer that includes a reference handbook filled with all the equations you need. I prepared for the exam by studying an FE prep book, but I think that one could easily get through that exam by looking at the question, and using ctrl+F to find the relevant equation in the reference handbook.  In short, OP, look through a practice book maybe 2 weeks before the test and you'll be fine."
EngineeringStudents,3a34oe,BowTieTime,20,Tue Jun 16 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"For the people who failed, I think it's either a lack of preparedness and not knowing how to navigate through the reference manual or an over analysis of the problems at hand. For example:  Let's say they give you a schematic of a rankine cycle within a nuclear power plant with various listed enthalpies, specific energy, mass flow rate, etc. for every part of the cycle. What is the work in to a feedwater pump?  The unprepared person would search high and low in the reference manual and lose a lot of time. The over analyzer would start by looking at the whole thing and be overwhelmed and try solving for various bits and pieces of the cycle. The prepared person would recognize that they give the enthalpy values across the feedwater pump and the mass flowrate. It's a simple equation, W-dot = m-dot*(Δh), which can be found in the reference manual if you know where to look and how to apply it. This type of problem is in Lindeburg's books and pretty accurate to what I experienced on the actual thing.  Here's a post that I wrote a while back concerning my method and how I bought myself a sense of security. You should be fine for two weeks using the reference manual and the PP book listed in my post."

EngineeringStudents,3a34oe,jhc1415,7,Wed Jun 17 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"Edit: Downvote/ignore as you wish. This is relevant to the old exam only.  I don't know if they've changed it at all, but I honestly don't see any reason why any mechanical engineers bother with the mechanical exam in the afternoon. It's just a harder version of the general exam, which is a drastically simplified version of what your entire mechanical engineering curriculum prepares you to tackle. They don't even put on your certificate which exam you took in the afternoon session.  There is absolutely no incentive to take the mechanical exam. Nobody shakes your hand at the end and says ""Congratulations, you took the hard road and survived!"" Nobody ever really explained to any of us why that part of the exam even exists. I'm actually curious to find out if someone wants to explain it to me. I know that the morning general exam is normally the hard exam for some of the non-mechanical majors since their curriculum is a bit more specific, but mechanical engineering is general by nature, so the general exam is easy, and the afternoon general exam is only slightly harder. I guess maybe take the mechanical exam if you're the type of person to want to really challenge yourself for no reason, but that's something I wasn't in the mood to study for in the middle of the quarter when I had 20 other things I needed to work on.  The quarter I took it at my school, my department had a 100% pass rate because everyone knew that. If you paid attention and got decent grades in all of your major and support courses, you'll be able to answer about 60% of the questions within a minute, 38% of the remaining questions in under 5 minutes, and have enough time to sit there and read the manual to full-on learn the material for the first time for the remaining obscure 2% of the questions you're completely unfamiliar with.  Seriously, someone give me a non-personal, objective reason why anyone should take the mechanical exam."

Also it's common on product designs to just do software denouncing as you reduce the component count(and cost) and make it easier to fine tune the system. I don't quite get why the author doesn't just software debounce if they have little hardware experience.  In fact, the author had one of the Ardiuno Dues in their picture. The SAM3X microcontroller on the board has hardware debouncing built into the chip that you can enable per pin with configurable time settings via software. This is a common feature on most ARMs (so the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc have this too). The lower end Arduinos with AVRs don't have this feature but software debouncing is so simple.

But the Titanic disaster wasn't his fault - it was ruled an accident and surpassed the standards for its time. Safety standards just weren't good enough.  EDIT: Re-reading his Wikipedia page makes me respect him even more.   As he had done for the other ships he had overseen, Andrews familiarised himself with every detail of the Olympic and Titanic, in order to ensure that they were in optimal working order. Unfortunately, Andrews's suggestions that the ship have 46 lifeboats (instead of the 20 it ended up with) as well as a double hull and water tight bulkheads that went up to B deck, were overruled.  At Harland and Wolff, he began with three months in the joiners' shop, followed by a month in the cabinetmakers' and then a further two months working on the ships. The last eighteen months of his five-year apprenticeship were spent in the drawing office. In 1901, Andrews, after working his way up through the many departments of the company, became the manager of the construction works [...] During his long years of apprenticeship, study, and work, Andrews had become well liked in the company and amongst the shipyard's employees.  As the evacuation of the Titanic began, Andrews tirelessly searched staterooms telling the passengers to put on lifebelts and go up on deck.[...] Fully aware of the short time the ship had left and of the lack of lifeboat space for all passengers and crew, he continued to urge reluctant people into the lifeboats in the hope of filling them as fully as possible. Survivors also reported seeing Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to use as flotation devices."

He is considered the greatest experimenter of antiquity  and his work is representative of the Hellenistic scientific tradition.   Hero published a well recognized description of a steam-powered device called an aeolipile (sometimes called a ""Hero engine""). Among his most famous inventions was a windwheel, constituting the earliest instance of wind harnessing on land.   He is said to have been a follower of the atomists. Some of his ideas were derived from the works of Ctesibius.  Much of Hero's original writings and designs have been lost, but some of his works were preserved in Arabic manuscripts.

If you know what the company does ahead of time (which you should) then it should be tailored around specific things you've done and the result of your work. If you haven't had work experience yet, I'm sure there are a few classes you've taken that gave you some useful experience.

Every employer is going to be looking for something different, besides things like report writing skills, punctuality, etc. The best thing to do would probably start working on some personal projects that are related to the field you want to work in. That'll show employers that you're passionate about their line of work, and hopefully there will be some transferrable skills from your project to the actual job.   EDIT: And make sure to include the project on your resume and bring it up in an interview, if it's relevant."

EngineeringStudents,3a39is,various_failures,3,Wed Jun 17 07:40:27 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I'm in a similar boat as you.  I was 29 when I decided to go back to school.  I'm now 31 and have one semester left in community college before graduating with an AS in Engineering, after which I'll transfer to a local four-year university to get a BS in Civil Engineering.   First, don't let your age discourage you at all. Seriously, nobody cares.  If anything, people look up to you for your maturity.  Second, it's good that you like math because you are going to be doing a lot of it.  All engineers take the same math core (Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus 1-3, Differential Equations).  These are all considered freshman/sophomore level classes.  At my school, some place into Calculus 1, but most (including me) place into algebra/trig.  Third, course loads for engineering students are very hefty.  Including general education (English, History, Humanities, etc), general science (Chemistry 1-2, Physics 1-2), and engineering courses, you're looking at 16-18 credit hours per semester if you plan on graduating with a BS in 4 years.  Because of this, a lot of folks I know are actually on the ""5 year plan"".  They say that it allows them more time to absorb the material.  If you're not in a hurry, that may be a better way to go.  Anyway, I hope that this was helpful.  Good luck to you!"
EngineeringStudents,3a39is,anmre,2,Wed Jun 17 10:37:15 2015 UTC,"I'm just finishing up my schooling as a mechanical engineer, so I can't weigh in on the electric side, but as far as mechanical goes your workload will change significantly from semester to semester.  It's not easy, I would say engineering is definitely among the most difficult majors to choose.  After saying that I would follow with you wind up with some of the best jobs out there.  The math is intensive, for me calculus 1-3 then difeq. Don't let that discourage you though.  Most schools have honours societies with awesome free tutoring and I honestly believe anyone can get through that stuff. Once you get to your core engineering classes, from my experience with non traditional students at least, you will have a huge advantage. Every non traditional student who worked in a related field previously destroyed all of the practical classes and wrecked the curves for traditional students.  I now have an awesome job working at a midcap500 energy control company and I couldn't be happier with my choice to do engineering. If you have any specific questions feel free to pm me and I'd be happy to talk about whatever."

In classrooms, a lot of the work will be theroy based and will force you to critically think about problems and use maths. Definitely brush up on algebra and trigonometry. My math professor once told us that kids who don't do well in calculus based courses are becuase the algebra skills are shit. Most common calculus concepts are not too hard to grasp, but yeah. Just go in wanting to learn and you should be good!"
EngineeringStudents,3a39is,rkkrqqqqrssss,2,Wed Jun 17 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"I just graduated with my BS in mechanical engineering.  I won't repeat what everyone else said, yeah the math sucks and it will make the first two years of classes suck.  But if you make it through, it's very well worth it. I was in the same boat as you, being between electrical and mechanical.  I am extremely happy with my decision to do mechanical.  In my school, many of the mechanical classes and projects had a significant component of electrical/software.  We often had to make a circuit and/or program a microcontroller to control the mechanical system we made.  I loved both sides of this but I usually did the electrical bit for my team because I just had a knack for it.  This totally satisfied me for as far as I wanted to know electrical engineering. Also, I don't think the work load between the two majors is really comparable.  They both are hard in their own ways.  Additionally, the job market is great.  I had a great job lined up since the start of my senior year, and everyone I know had a job by the time they graduated.  You should enroll now while you have the motivation.  It pays off. Good luck to you!"

EngineeringStudents,3a39is,TheIronGus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:23:10 2015 UTC,"Full time class loads are going to be similar for both majors, they both include fairly difficult material, in their own regard. If you're looking for what is typically the easiest, I can't help you with that. Depending on if you mean Electronic Engineering or Electrical Engineering (they may be different, electronic being easier), then the stratification is probably similar to this:   electronic < mechanical <= electrical  As far as a full time load, probably 14-17 credit hours is average - translating to about 4-5 classes every semester. It's going to be difficult, and you will almost definitely have to improve your math skills. Luckily, you will take Calc I, II, III and differential equations before you get into any of your engineering courses so that won't be a problem as long as you pass. Obviously if you previously took any courses, you may be able to accelerate your program slightly.   Don't worry about being 'old,' there are plenty of 'non-traditional' students in my classes. At first it's like 'hey look at that guy, he's older than me' and then that's it, you're exactly like us IF you are not a condescending 'I know more because I'm older than you' asshole.

Chemical engineering programs are not always linked to bioengineering programs or electives in tissue engineering. Also, depending on the department, BME professors in tissue engineering may be more likely to give you research opportunities if you're already in the department.   If you think you might change your mind about grad school, you might want to go into chemical since the job opportunities with a BS are better there. They aren't terrible for BME, but you'd have to be very active in finding internships/co-ops and network well if your school doesn't have connections."

Even if you think you know what they are talking about, be respectful and listen and don't try to finish their sentences(figuratively, and literally). I have been surprised how many times I've learned something new by listening to my coworkers talk about something I thought I already knew pretty well.   If you have a question, google it first. If you still have a question, especially one that is detail oriented or somewhat complex, make sure you know exactly what you're asking before you walk into their office to ask.   As other people have stated, don't be afraid to ask questions. Most people will be aware that you are an intern (or introduce yourself as being an intern when you meet new coworkers), so they won't expect you to know everything. Don't be afraid to ask questions when people are explaining stuff to you. If they use a term, or an abbreviation or say something you don't understand, just ask.   Try to relax! Most people, everyone really, at my internship have been super helpful and are always happy to help me, and explain something new to me. Showing interest in what you are working on or learning will speak for it self and most will respect you for that.  Good luck, and try to enjoy it!"

""Well one covers a range of 1-2kHz, but on the other hand, they both cover a 1 kHz range... guess I'll just choose one because this is a stupid question.""

EngineeringStudents,3a3zmo,littlekittencockslut,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:33:00 2015 UTC,"What's important is being able to do the exercises that will come up in the exam. Hibbeler is very comprehensive (and that's usually a good thing) but in your case you want to skip all the stuff about how they derive each formula for each variable they want. Those derivations help tremendously in understanding why, for example, the formula for so and so is so and so and so, but right now forget all of that.   If you're stressed for time, you need two things: the formulae, and how to apply them. Go through the book and take down the formulae they give you in the little summaries at the beginning of each chapter (hopefully I'm not confusing Hibbeler with M&K, if they're not at the beginning they're located just before the sample questions in a helpful lil box)   Then with all the time you have left, go through the sample questions then some exercise questions (you can find thorough solutions to the latter online). Do your best to understand what you're doing (or reading in the solutions).   This gives you knowledge of the most important thing you need to complete most questions in an MoM exam: how to apply the formulae to give them what they're asking for. It's a cheap thing to do, it's shallow and it might not work for higher-level questions - but it should be enough for you to get through most of the exam."

How am I supposed to know?  It's for you to figure out.  College is sort of a drink from a firehose exercise.

EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,SkinnyEngineer,-2,Fri Jun 19 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"i do multiple apps a day, but they are generally at the same companies"
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,Beanz122,7,Tue Jun 16 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Thats awful reason, if its for friends and family fine. Rent is just a bad rationalization on your part though.  In the 9 months you've been out of work, which wouldn't have occurred if you had been looking at a wider area, you would have made enough to pay for 5 years of rent in most places."
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,Beanz122,-3,Tue Jun 16 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"you're right, but fuck I love my friends and family here"
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,ch00f,2,Tue Jun 16 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I hope this doesn't sound pompous, but dude...you're going to be making an engineering salary. What do you need to save money for?   Edit: also, what's your reason for wanting to stay in southern California?"
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,Gyang193,-1,Tue Jun 16 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"Raised here, born here, great friends and family here"
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,THedman07,7,Tue Jun 16 21:46:13 2015 UTC,All good reasons. Just... Keep your options open man. Maybe apply to places a little further away. A job with an hour commute is better than no job at all.

EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,twinnedcalcite,5,Wed Jun 17 02:28:57 2015 UTC,What else is on your resume? Previous internships? Boeing and NG doesnt really care about portfolio they need intern experience etc
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,autmnleighhh,-3,Tue Jun 16 21:33:06 2015 UTC,no internship experience but none the less my dual major and minor with the research experience should be more than enough
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,12pinRJ45,5,Tue Jun 16 21:45:31 2015 UTC,2 majors that are very close to each other and a minor in a subject that is partially covered in the mechanical curriculum isn't that impressive.
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,twinnedcalcite,3,Wed Jun 17 02:45:26 2015 UTC,your results seem to suggest it isn't more than enough. check your attitude and find some humility.
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,siac4,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:57:08 2015 UTC,You need to sell those projects if that's all you have.  Your resume doesn't sell them at all.   Why should HR give to shits about you?  - all those points that just came into you head are the start of your new resume.
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,twinnedcalcite,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:12:40 2015 UTC,I thought it was pretty well know that it's internships and experience that get you jobs.  Your lack of success find a job could be used as proof for why this is.

PM me your info if youre interested"
EngineeringStudents,3a2yv6,twinnedcalcite,-1,Wed Jun 17 05:44:46 2015 UTC,Make your resume 2 pages instead of 1.  Also have you been doing any personal research projects or taking extra courses to keep yourself occupied?    I'm unemployed as well but I do anywhere from 1 - 15 apps in a day.    A LinkedIn profile would serve you better then a website.

The scholarship I got is specifically meant to target out-of-state students and it has been working: out-of-state are now a slight majority of the student body and we have a pretty vibrant campus culture as a result.  If you like sports, you'll like it here: Alabama is known for its American football, but sports are big and we have a lot of good teams.  Lastly, and most importantly, the Engineering department is on the rise. Like I said before, the university is going a long way to attract out-of-state talent and they're specifically dumping money into the COE. We've had three new buildings since I've been here and the faculty has expanded as well. I predict that in 5-10 years, UA will be one of the premier engineering schools in the South."
EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,rodiraskol,2,Tue Jun 16 15:51:15 2015 UTC,"Seconded! I just graduated from UA as an out of state student (though my scholarship wasn't as large as yours) with a degree in chemical engineering.   Just as important as the new facilities, everyone I knew in the program had no issues finding a job. UA's career center is really on point when it comes to getting great companies to come recruit its students. My grades weren't mind blowing by any means at a 3.02 and I'm now working a great job for a company in Fortunes top 100!  On top of that, UA has one of the most beautiful campuses in the country!"
EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,GoFlight1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:21:04 2015 UTC,Congratulations! I'm graduating May '16 myself.  How exactly did the career center connect you with the company? Was it through the career fair?
EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,rodiraskol,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, my current job came after I spoke with recruiters at the career fair. I also had two other interviews that were set up through Crimson careers.   Definitely take advantage of everything they have to offer! Especially the interview practice and resume reviews, they're great!   Also, just because your not graduating until next spring doesn't mean you can't go to the career fair this fall. In fact, I'd highly recommend you do. Having your job already lined up early in your senior year is great, trust me :)"
EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,GoFlight1,2,Thu Jun 18 01:37:27 2015 UTC,This is probably the best option of all I have. I've been checking the page and everything seems right for me!! What about extra-curricular activities?
EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,rodiraskol,2,Wed Jun 17 12:26:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's a big school, I'm sure you can find a group of people that are into whatever you're into. /r/capstone is our university subreddit and they could probably answer any questions you have.  I'm personally involved with the engineering fraternity on campus and that's been a great experience. I've also played a lot of intramural sports.  Finally, I noticed that you're from Mexico. I don't know if it matters to you, but you probably won't meet many other Latinos, especially in the College of Engineering. I think I may actually be the only one."

EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,saroka,2,Wed Jun 17 14:05:37 2015 UTC,"Hunting, fishing, and general outdoors activities are big in the region in general. Being a larger university, there is pretty much anything you could possibly want to do there. The programs in their engineering college are also rapidly improving so the reputation is getting better almost every year.  I went to Auburn, which is clearly the better school, but their out of state financial aid is so bad now that I am literally pumping up UA. You hear that, Auburn? Get your shit together!"
EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,hugepenis,5,Wed Jun 17 13:53:38 2015 UTC,What engineering are you applying for? A lot of universities are specialized in one major or two. Mine had a lot of international students but biomedical engineering was the schools focus.

EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,mgrier123,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:45:15 2015 UTC,Boston University? I feel like MechE was the main focus but I might be biased. A lot of my friends said BME shouldn't be offered as an undergrad major and the course track was very unorganized.
EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,MCbrodie,2,Tue Jun 16 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"BU started the BME undergraduate program in the country so yes it's a little oriented weird compared to other schools and by rankings sake it's one of the best in the country for it. However, BME in general is weird. Other schools make BME even more focused than BU's BME so honestly BU made the best of what it had. I have mixed feelings about BU and BME, but I can say I learned a lot from it and that they did not bullshit around like my friends BME program who had more of a biology orientation. The general rule I found was that you needed to pick a second major or really a track to follow. My friend went more BME/EE and he found more use than just being a BME alone."

VT is big on sports, and by that I mean football. Blacksburg is a great town and if you're into parties we're a huge party school, but there's also lots of hiking and other outdoorsy things to do in the area as well. There are tons of international students, and lots of latinos if you care about that sort of thing.  Great facilities (except Randolph...) and mostly great teachers, and everyone is really friendly.  Give us a look but by no means is VT a perfect fit for everyone. Feel free to ask me anything else."

EngineeringStudents,3a16v8,Apfelstrudel1996,2,Tue Jun 16 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"Currently at Montreal Polytechnic. Not kidding, I'm in the best years of my life. The price is decent for foreigners and they really encourage others to come visit us (somewhere about 50% of the students aren't canadian). The city is welcoming and most student learn to love the diversity of Montreal. Moreover, you'll learn that French Canadians are really friendly and ready to help if needed.   The social life in Poly is amazing, there's so many activities, happy hours, and you will find your integration amazing too. If you love to party, you'll be served. There's also a solid bond between students at Poly, no matter the program you're in, even with the graduates. I never felt that before in my other experiences, and it fells amazing to take part and get involved in school projects, student committees (beer brewing, concrete canoe, solar car, quadcopters, sports, parties, Eng games and so on). I'm sure you'll find something that suites you well!  My gf is in civil engineering, and she loves it, there's quite a lot of choices when it comes to choose a certain concentration.  The only con I can genuinely find from hearing other international students is that Poly seems to be quite theoretical rather than practical. I would say that depends on the program, in Comp eng. it's more 60% theoratical 40% practical.   Feel free to ask any questions!"

The main campus is near downtown where there are a few companies always looking for interns/recent graduates to hire. I'm talking Altria, Dominion Power, MeadWestVaco, and more.  The basketball hype is insane (or at least was), so it's always fun to go to games/watch games. Social life is really nice too, as we're downtown and there's a lot of things to do. It never gets boring!  EDIT: Plus if you're thinking of BME and want to go/apply to medical school, MCV is a great medical college and is literally down the street from VCUs main campus.

Houston has a huge hispanic population so you'll have absolutely no issues finding people similar to you in culture and personality. Houston (and Texas in general) has a booming construction industry largely because a lot of companies are moving their headquarters here and we're seeing an influx of people moving from other states. Houston itself is usually referred to as the energy capital of the world so you'll have the opportunity to network with many industry professionals.  So as a civil engineering major you'll love it.

Our program is one of the top rated in the nation (somewhere between #11-15 in US News when i was applying). We're selective, but not too selective. They give in-state tuition waivers out pretty easily, but I can't guarantee you'll get one. The Aggie network is supposedly extremely helpful with finding employment, even outside of Texas. Lots of people, so you can find your niche (not everyone is conservative or from Texas, I am neither). Beautiful girls, great football, great people, tough program, great value for the price. I would say the one downside is that start your freshman year as a general engineering major and then must apply to get into a department. PetE, ChemE, and BMEN are the toughest to get into. CivE and EE will take pretty much everyone. Not sure about MechE, though. We also have a pretty good Ocean engineering program, but finding an ocean engineer is like spotting bigfoot, so I don't know too much about them."

Pretty sure most of them are open since a lot of enrolled freshman visit during the summer  start to register for classes at their New Student Conference.  If you have above a 34 on the ACT and/or are a national merit finalist, you'll be rolling in the scholarships. I don't know how generous they are to international students, though. We have a lot of students from China and India, so they must be kind to them in some way; and I have heard of some hispanic and first generation student scholarships.  This is a big school with a lot of applicants. The surest way to get in is good test scores and a high GPA. Somewhere around a 26-29 on the ACT and your chances should be pretty good. I can't say for sure whether or not my essays affected my admission, I'm pretty sure it was mostly my test scores."

I ran my degree audit, everything checked green, I applied for graduation and received a confirmation email, I took my exams, I walked and everything golden.  9 days after I walked I received an email stating I had not satisfied my major-elective and that I would not be receiving my degree. I was furious. I took my situation to the Dean and my advisor who both said that it was an error on the audits part since one of my classes I had to get signed off on.  I had already accepted a job at a firm and had to inform them that I had not graduated.  Luckily for me, the only thing it affected was my job title.  I sucked it up and took the class.  The professor was very sympathetic of my situation and he made things very easy for me.  I know what you're going through and it's unfortunate, but you need to keep your head and fight through your anger so you can accomplish what you've set out to do.  Don't let your emotions towards the university keep you down.  Tl;dr: Never trust the degree audit"

Every time I go to an advisor at my CC they tell me I need to finish a crap ton of classes (I would have to stay at the CC a total of 3 years to complete these) and that, by the way, I will then be eligible for an associates. But, when I talk to transferring colleges, one person I talked to was an assistant dean of the program I wish to transfer to, they say I actually need about half of those classes to be eligible for transfer. I have a faculty mentor (which is awesome) and he said that the CC does have a motivation to keep you as long as possible at the college and for you to get an associates degree from that college for funding reasons. My advise would be, even though it is a little late, to talk to the college(s) you wish to transfer to about their requirements.  Sometimes these vary but basically the CC advisors usually arent on top of these and are crazy generally. Youre not the first to complain of this and it just happened to a good friend of mine last year.

She then goes through everything and checks to make sure everything is there and complete. Then, she gives you tentative approval and sends the graduation plan over to the chair of studies who approves it usually within 48 hours. Once it is approved, only a change to the graduation plan, failure to pass a course, or failure to meet the minimum GPA requirement can prevent you from graduating.

They said many students had done this and it was very successful. After talking to some of students, they said only 2-3 people have done it and it took a lot longer, not to mention that Iowa State wasn't even aware of this 'program.' Many of the classes wouldn't even transfer. Now I'm just going to tranfer to ISU after my freshman year, I don't see how one could finish an engineering degree in 2 years. I don't think a physics/engineering dual degree would be very helpful either.  I just needed to write this somewhere.

It shows that you had value for their company. So you're much better off sticking with it than dropping it.   And don't just try to graduate as fast as possible. Often, taking an extra year or six months to get more experience, and potentially lighten your course load so you get better grades will lead to better jobs in the future.   As to your specific questions about mechanical engineering internships - that really depends on the individual internship."
EngineeringStudents,39zwx3,candydaze,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:40:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response!   After thinking about this a full day, I thought I should defintely stay with the company, especially growing some of my programming skills, and obviously showing my commitment to a company, and what not.   I definitely agree on the work experience part, it definitely is important I take up every opportunity and make myself not only appealing to employers, but have the experience to be succesful in the workplace. Being at my current internship, my previous work experience has significantly helped me do things the ""right way"" and ultimately navigate my way around the typical ""9-5"" workday.   Lastly, I know my specific questions are unique per every opportunity, more or less I was just trying to get a feel out of what is ultimately out there, I guess that is more research on my part, unless someone else can chime a bit more on that?   Once again, thanks for your response! :)"
EngineeringStudents,3a1fd8,Sterling_____Archer,2,Tue Jun 16 14:02:27 2015 UTC,"Very basically: Id like to replace the three way toggle (I think?) switch on this fan with a potentiometer, so that the fan speed can be set to any speed, I.e. Not limited to the three factory presets.   Just wondering what kind of pot to buy, and if I should also use resistors."
EngineeringStudents,3a1fd8,andredotcom,3,Tue Jun 16 14:04:46 2015 UTC,"Buy the one is use to dim fans they sell them at home depot, is not just a pot."
EngineeringStudents,3a1fd8,speeding_sloth,2,Tue Jun 16 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"That will only work if the motor is a DC motor and it is the absolute worst way of speed control. Imagine driving a car at full throttle and breaking to get to the speed you need. That is what you'll essentially be doing.  You'll be better off getting an existing speed controller (or, if you know a bit of programming and electronics, build your own)."
EngineeringStudents,3a1fd8,speeding_sloth,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that's unfortunate to hear. I'd like to retain or improve its current level of efficiency, and the ""driving the car at full throttle while using the breaks to regulate speed,"" analogy certainly seems to be the opposite of that."
EngineeringStudents,3a1fd8,offramp13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is pretty unfortunate. The problem is that if you try to limit current by adding resistance, which adds (rather big) losses in the circuit. It also lowers the voltage over the motor, which might actually be what is needed (lower voltage to the machine means lower speed for DC machines). It is how some of the cheaper dimmers work nowadays.  That being said, a DC motor's speed is proportional to the voltage, not the current. So, there might be hope. Can you give some more info on the type of fan and maybe on the motor (is it actually a DC motor or something else)?"
EngineeringStudents,3a1fd8,speeding_sloth,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:10:59 2015 UTC,"Variable speed fans typically work by adjusting the number of energized coils in the motor, not by limiting the current or voltage that the motor receives.  This will likely be impossible without a more sophisticated motor controller."

I've set up some rigorous scheduling, with at least an hour a day per subject (and larger blocks when available), and stick to it like a religion. It's made a huge improvement in my ability to understand the material, and subsequently my grade. Uninstalling video games and redditing only on the shitter helps too."

EngineeringStudents,39zs59,kingman123,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"I think you could make a good argument for both, it's really a judgment call.  If you are concerned about cost and do not want to go into more debt, then taking the class a community college makes sense.  I would not worry about the difficulty of the class.  You work hard in the class, you will be successful.        However, even if the Summer Camp is not an internship in industry I think it has value.  It will give you something to put on your resume and something to talk about in interviews.  You will be working on a somewhat technical subject in a team environment that will test your patience (kids, lol).  You are young, and I think having something like this on a resume would make your stand out a little bit.  Most sophmores have nothing on their resume at this point, or at least I didn't.   Bottom line: If you're worried about debt or graduating faster, take the classes.  Otherwise, I'd choose the Summer Camp."

EngineeringStudents,39zxrp,candleonaflame,4,Tue Jun 16 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"I believe the gaming and visual effects industry is highly competitive and you will need to bring a lot to the table. If you're interested in the visual aspect, you will need to build a portfolio, which can take years. Take a look here. The software you will be most likely using is Autodesk 3Ds Max or Maya along with plugins like ZBrush. I personally don't have experience with softbody modeling, but I have spent a lot of time in hard surface modeling (cars). It took me awhile to get good at it, I currently have 8 years of experience (hobby only) with modeling, texturing, and rendering. And I think it's safe to say the people you are competing against have just as many years. With that said, you'll need to be passionate about it because you can easily burn out. Losing motivation on a project is very easy. Here's my first suggestion, participate in the mini modeling challenges they have at forums.cgsociety.org to build your skills quickly.   The artistic side will take many years to develop, but on the technical side maybe you can work with virtual reality technology like the Oculus Rift? Maybe use your knowledge of fluid mechanics and programming to implement particle visualization within the game?   Well, I hope that's somewhat helpful. I can only speak from my own experience with artistic modeling and I know just how difficult it can be. It will take many years to get on everyone else's level. You should post your question on forums.cgsociety.org. These are people that actually work in the gaming and visual effects industry and can give you a much bigger insight. Also, be aware of the assholes on that website. There's quite a few but they are the best after all."

I think it was the first Witcher game actually, but I really don't recall. Could have been Dark Souls, I really don't remember.      If I remember his story correctly, he got into working with the neuromechanics group in college within the ME dept and became really proficient with motion capture systems. After school he went to work with the development studio and got even deeper into motion capture, setting up skeletons and being their lead tracker. Eventually, he became so specialized in motion capture, he moved over to the company that manufacturers and designs the 3d motion capture systems. He then came out to train us, a bunch of MEs, on how to use their system they were installing in our lab.

EngineeringStudents,39x3bs,Pariguayo,3,Mon Jun 15 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"After spending the last 7 years enlisted I've looked into comissioning as an engineer in various ways.  The general consensus over at /r/AirForce  and among the couple active duty engineers I know im the Air Force is that commissioning as an engineer, you are an officer first and engineer second. You could be pulled away from doing engineering work for a couple of years to fill a leadership role, so there is that to consider. The job code is 62E if you want to do more research.   If you arent going to try and be a pilot, your service committment after comissioning should be 4 years.   If its a route you are on the fence about, you can always do the time in ROTC and change your mind at the end and not take the commission, at which point you will still have all the experiences from ROTC."

You're getting trained in the basics.  Between Sophomore/Junior Years: Field Training. Four(-ish) weeks of the Officer version of basic at Maxwell AFB, AL/Camp Shelby, MS.  Every sophomore completes for an EA (enrollment allocation, your slot to Field training.) It depends on your grades, major, PFA score, AFOQT score and commander's ranking.  Junior/Senior Years: 2-3 hr of PT a week, 3 hr clas, 2 hr of Lead Lab (Training). You're doing the training.  The rest of the time, you're a normal college student.  As for engineering jobs, there's a lot you can do with your degree. Most of developmental engineering is more on the side of project management, but there are flight test opportunities. Engineering degrees are also desired in fields like Intel and Space Ops, or you can get test pilot down the road.  Commitment is four years for most jobs, ten for anything rated (where you're in a plane/RPA box). I just whent through job selection, and am about to go through rated selection this fall, so if you have any questions about that feel free to ask.  If you're interested in joining, you'll want to talk to the officers at your detachment-NOT a general recruiter. They'll get you squared a way with school-specific requirements."
EngineeringStudents,39x3bs,PUBspotter,0,Mon Jun 15 15:49:33 2015 UTC,First and foremost you gotta talk to a recruiter. I was enlisted before going to engineering school so my understanding of ROTC is limited. I believe if you finish the whole program you owe AF 4 years of service unless you become a pilot. I'm not exactly sure how job assignments work in the AF and there are few engineering jobs which you can easily look up at airforce recruiting website. I think the way it works is you compete in a job selection process and depending on your scores and job qualification they'll tell you what kind of job you'll have.

EngineeringStudents,39xu65,nuke1968,4,Mon Jun 15 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"Nuclear engineer here.   There is no bulk boiling in a PWR. There is some subcooled nucleate boiling directly around the fuel rods, but that's it. Bulk boiling would lower the available heat transfer and could damage the fuel. We use high pressure both to prevent boiling, and to allow us to raise water temperature to improve heat transfer and cycle efficiency.   If you had nuclear fuel in a water solid system, that would be bad. Every degree or two the water heats up can cause a 50-100 PSIG increase in pressure, which can rapidly lead to vessel failure, even with safety valves.   So to protect the pressure vessel, a pressurizer is used. The pressurizer has a small steam bubble in it. The rest of the reactor coolant system is kept water solid, but that small vapor bubble in the pressurizer is used to help dampen the temperature effects on pressure.   The pressurizer has heaters and sprays to act as supplemental pressure control. The heaters raise pressure, and the sprays lower it. The spray water usually comes from the cold leg water in the PWR, (water that was just cooled by the steam generator), if necessary, you can also inject cold (room temperature) charging water to the spray system for helping to cool down or pressure control before the reactor coolant pumps are started.   The pressurizer is also used for level control. You measure water level in the pressurizer, and the pressurizer has a power operated relief valve for rapidly lowering pressure, for transient pressure relief to prevent safety valves from lifting, or for once through cooling during emergencies.   The water does become pressurized by heat from the fuel, but we use the pressurizer for pressure control and use the fuel for temperature control. The pressurizer's pressure control is secondary to the temperature changes by the RCS.   Hope this helps. Please feel free to ask more questions!"

EngineeringStudents,39xu65,Hiddencamper,6,Tue Jun 16 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"The capslock thing is pretty silly, so is expecting a non-engineering type response in an engineering related subreddit. Your answers are all in my original post. Here's the say it louder version if one would read more closely.   In laymans terms, what is the general premise of pressurization to keep reactor water from boiling.    Bulk boiling would lower the available heat transfer and could damage the fuel. We use high pressure both to prevent boiling, and to allow us to raise water temperature to improve heat transfer and cycle efficiency.   Is there air in the primary coolant piping?    The pressurizer has a small steam bubble in it. The rest of the reactor coolant system is kept water solid,    My interpretation is the pressurizer heats air in the coolant tube. The air expands, creating pressure on the water volume, preventing boiling, because boiling would create steam, and steam requires cubic volume. and there is no room for steam, because of the expanded air. is this correct?    The pressurizer has heaters and sprays to act as supplemental pressure control. The heaters raise pressure, and the sprays lower it.    as for pressurization, doesnt the water already become pressurized by heat from the reactor fuel?   The water does become pressurized by heat from the fuel, but we use the pressurizer for pressure control and use the fuel for temperature control. The pressurizer's pressure control is secondary to the temperature changes by the RCS."
EngineeringStudents,39xu65,a_slippery_nipple,3,Tue Jun 16 12:58:34 2015 UTC,I recommend you take a thermodynamics/heat transfer course to more fully understand how temperature and pressure relate to each other as well as the benefits of using higher temperatures in heat engines.

EngineeringStudents,39teck,Needmofunneh,32,Sun Jun 14 16:23:48 2015 UTC,"My worst GPA also occurred sophomore year when I while I was taking Thermo and Fluids. It dropped me down to a 2.7 (pretty close to where you're at).   2 years on, I brought it back up to 3.1 for graduation. Rough couple of years for that turn-around (basically lived at the school), but it is possible.   I landed a summer job while I had a sub-3.0, but it was a food industry position at a processing facility. Not exactly aerospace, but still a suitable starting position.   You're not doomed, but you might have to work a little bit harder to find a job than you would with a 3.0. Open mind, keep searching, and you'll probably be alright.   And personally, I would still include the GPA on your resume. They'll either care about it and find out anyway, or they won't care and it won't matter."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,AtomicSteve21,5,Sun Jun 14 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"This is my experience, too.  Thermo and Fluids were nasty for me (but I got through them without having to repeat.)  These courses got me down to a 2.6...I'll be happy with a 3.0 by graduation.  Not stressing too much."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,eatthepupu,5,Sun Jun 14 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation but agree with the exception of putting your GPA on your resume if it's sub 3.0. Highlight project experience and academic achievements without putting a number on it.  Also, keep in mind that you can round to a tenth for your resume so if you can get to a 2.95 you can put down a 3.0.  I had a 2.9 junior spring and still got a solid summer internship. Got it up to a 2.98 so I could apply with a 3.0 senior fall. Got a job and then still managed to get up to a 3.06 by the end of senior year to finish with a 3.1."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,gj667cc,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:29:07 2015 UTC,keep in mind that you can round to a tenth for your resume so if you can get to a 2.95 you can put down a 3.0   That seems risky. Is every company aware of this rule of tenths? Because otherwise it might be taken as a lie.
EngineeringStudents,39teck,AtomicSteve21,2,Mon Jun 15 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"It's commonly accepted practice to round to the nearest tenth. I think I ran into a couple of job applications (the ones where you basically have to re-enter all the info on your resume into whatever system the company uses) that specifically asked for two decimal places, in which case I would give them the 2.98. If they didn't specify that, I put down 3.0."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,gj667cc,5,Mon Jun 15 12:26:18 2015 UTC,When there's a lower cutoff such as 3.0 gpa you can't round if it's even 2.99 because that voids the cutoff. You can round 2.85 to 2.9 though. 2.84 to 2.9 is not proper rounding.
EngineeringStudents,39teck,blingdoop,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"Read the fine print. The internship I ended up taking said a 3.0 cutoff but in the more detailed description specified 2.95.

EngineeringStudents,39teck,NewHorizon84,10,Mon Jun 15 14:48:25 2015 UTC,"All the positions I interviewed/talked with recruiters about; not once did my GPA come up, no potential employers asked for my GPA. I have side projects I work on outside of class and some other real world experience. That's what they wanted to hear about. These two questions are what rings loudest when they are talking with someone: ""Can they work effectively in a team"" , ""Can they apply their knowledge to real world situations to solve real problems outside of a textbook"". Accentuate those two things when talking with someone and you are golden. I landed a Co-op with a local company doing engineering work with a position waiting for me when I graduate. I am currently a Sophomore in Mechanical Engineering. Sell yourself and realize your strengths above your peers and emphasize those.  Edit: This company also has full tuition/education expense reimbursement including parking, etc... as long as I stay above a 2.5 GPA. If you are looking for a position with a government contractor (e.g. Lockheed, Boeing, etc..) you will be in more of a cube farm setting with very high expectations and cutoffs because they can afford to only recruit the cream of the crop, and it's no big deal if they don't get a single person for the position for the year.  Edit 2: Forgot to mention some relative data. My University is ranked #6 nationally for public universities in the US for engineering, and the Career Center recommends listing your GPA at 3.0+ as very important. Since you are still quite close to 3.0 as a Sophomore it is very easy to hit the 3.0 cliff to meet what potential employers are looking for. Don't ever sell yourself short and always try your best. If you can't get that 3.0+ GPA then get a side project out of school to show you can apply your knowledge to real world applications regardless of how ""stupid"" or""simple"" you think it is you won't have any problems finding a position. It is up to the employer to determine what is important, not you! Include everything regardless."

EngineeringStudents,39teck,tsquared456,8,Wed Jun 17 05:39:04 2015 UTC,"Let me break down my school career experience: At the end of each year:  Freshman: 3.3  Sophmore: 2.8 (I went through some personal things at home)  Junior: 3.0  Senior: 3.21  I landed a GREAT job at a fortune 500 company. A higher GPA would have made my experience a ton easier however; I had to interview twice for this company to get a position (the first round I got rejected, applied again in a second round when another position opened up, got it).  GPA certainly isn't everything but it is important. You should be VERY concerned if you have below a 2.0...  Here's how I break it down:  <2.0 step up Senpai   2.0 - 2.5 is meh, you could get away with it MAYBE if you had a decent amount of extra curricular activities/ valuable internship experience   2.6-3.0 is solid, if you can get it higher do it, you may have some trouble competing for some ""cream of the crop"" jobs (NASA, SPACEX, ETC.)  3.1-3.5 is good, you should feel comfortable at around this range... may still have trouble competing for some of the ""cream of the crop"" jobs  3.6-4.0 is stellar, you will have immediate access to the ""cream of the crop"" jobs.  However, as others have stated; GPA isn't everything. Networking, good work ethic, and job experience are very important as well when it comes to getting a job.  TL;DR GPA is important. Work to get it as high as you reasonably can, but don't lose sleep over it if its between 2.5-3.0. You'll just have to gain some internship experience/network first because those are more important.  As a sophmore you have plenty of time to bring up your GPA."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,MiddleClassSeaBass,4,Sun Jun 14 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"I hear working at SPACEX is not really that great.

Grad school is about academics so naturally they will pay closer attention to it."

I don't know why I got it and they didn't, but it's some combination of resume/cover letter quality, charity volunteering/extracurriculars, and good job interview skills.

Pulled it up to a 3.25 before graduating this spring.  I only had one internship which was last summer.  I started applying and interviewing for jobs as soon as my senior year started.  By Thanksgiving, I received three offers and accepted one of them which I just started at this past week.  Just keep working hard and prioritize your studying.

EngineeringStudents,39teck,colechristensen,2,Sun Jun 14 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"ME here, I just graduated in May.  Experience and being able to do more than a math problem is where its at.  With a 2.xx GPA you might not work for NASA or (insert highly competitive position here) but you will get a job.  I had the lowest GPA of my friends and I was the first one with a job.  I would attribute this to being able to work with my hands, and having real world experience fixing things myself.  Get experience that will differentiate you from every other ME student and you will get a job.  Go through school with only theoretical idealized models that we are taught and you'll find it a little more difficult.  At the companies I interviewed with, the engineering mgrs all said how disappointed they were with current ME graduates.  Guys couldn't use basic hand tools, didn't want to get their hands dirty, had little if any knowledge of manufacturing processes and basic (at best) CAD experience.  Learn Solidworks or your favorite CAD package and know it.  Build stuff and have examples to show employers.  Also remember that after your first job nobody looks at GPA.  They only care about work experience.  GPA is used because its really the only way to weed out all of the applicants.  The firt job is important, however, because it can set the stage for what you do from there on (automotive, aerospace, robotics, marine...)"

EngineeringStudents,39teck,Szos,2,Mon Jun 15 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"Just about everything you do closes some doors and opens others.  There are several doors which will be closed to 4.0 students (what the hell were they doing with their time studying? probably nothing, they might end up being terrible employees who are only good at getting grades in classes)  What does a first-year 2.6 tell you about you in the far future? Very little.  You're still switching modes into university and not being first out of the gates doesn't mean much to your future potential or your first employers.  What does it mean for the near future? You haven't got engineering down yet.  B's and C's mean you aren't terrible at what you do, but you aren't excelling either. You aren't efficiently acquiring and applying knowledge.  You need to engineer yourself - in science and engineering failure is often as important as success. Maybe you need to organize your time better, improve your network of classmate support, better utilize professor and TA resources, how to relax properly, etc. University is as much about being good at these things as it is about acquiring knowledge.   You can graduate with a 2.6, you might not have every job you want immediately available to you, but you will be able to find something. Especially if you try to get everything out of the university experience by doing more than just classes. (the most important thing about interviewing is being able to relate experiences to another person - have some experiences please)  Leaving ME for something else might be the right thing to do, but it's waay too early to know that it's definitely the right thing, there's plenty of room left."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,sdn,2,Mon Jun 15 06:01:17 2015 UTC,"Something more important than the grades is experience: Join a Cubesat or SAE team. Work for a professor during summer. Get an internship/co-op, even two if you can. Those will help open more doors than a 4.0 will."

It's the later two years that count. If you have a substational improvement, you can use it to win over potential employers by showing that you put time and effort into improving yourself. If you frame it like that, you are golden.  Another thing I suggest looking into is seeing if there are any professors involved in startups. A lot of professors are now cofounding companies and are always looking for engineers. I suggest looking around for professors with LLC's too. It's less traditional, but working at a startup teaches you things you wouldn't learn in a bigger company."

If you're really concerned about your GPA, I would recommend you schedule as smart/light as you possibly can from here on out, maybe only do 1-2 ""core"" classes each semester, along with easier electives to both help you save time for your tough class(es) and raise your overall GPA.   Look into taking summer classes and possibly an extra semester to year of undergrad too, as you will feel less pressure to take 12+ credits of engineering in a given semester.  I never fell below a 3.0, but I did come very close until I started scheduling smarter and accepted the fact that I needed more than the 4 years that most undergrads take."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,kv-2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"Reasonably possible to save it   Yes. I went from a 3.07 at my lowest after 4 semesters and pulled it back to a 3.50 after 5 more. I graduated in 4.5 years. I really hit my stride when I actually got to the engineering classes, pulling between a 3.7-3.9 each semester.   Could I even get a job if I couldn't bring it up much.   Yes. But remember, you're closing doors on yourself. As /u/kv-2 has pointed out, getting past the HR hurdle with a low GPA will be the biggest challenge. You might be competitive because of good internships/experience, but they'll get other applicants with similar experience and a better GPA."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,goodoletom,-5,Sun Jun 14 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"If you aren't afraid, you should be. There are workarounds for a low GPA [<3.0 is low] as some companies do automatically filter out applicants based on GPA for entry level hires. Yes, they maybe eliminating ""better"" candidates, but tough shit pull the GPA up if you want to start there. Typically smaller companies will let lower GPA students get to the visual inspection at which point internships, work study, etc can keep you inconsideration to the phone screen and interview.   TL; DR: Pull the GPA up if you want an easier job hunt, get a lot of GOOD experience if you don't."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,casey12141,7,Sun Jun 14 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"Afraid is a bit harsh. If the company won't hire you because you have a B- average (2.7), then screw that company. 83 and 84 is the difference between a 2.7 GPA and a 3.0."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,MiddleClassSeaBass,-2,Sun Jun 14 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"4.0 = A, 3.0 = B, so a 3.0 is an 80. Were you meaning 73 and 74?"
EngineeringStudents,39teck,casey12141,12,Sun Jun 14 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. 4.0 = A, 3.7 = A-, 3.3 = B+, 3.0 = B, and a 2.7 = B-  An 84 is a B which is a 3.0. An 80 would be a B-, and 2.7"
EngineeringStudents,39teck,jackavsfan,-4,Sun Jun 14 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"This is how my school did it and all other schools I had seen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States#Grade_point_average  4.0 is assigned to a flat A - 90 to 100, 3.0 to a flat B - 80 to 89, etc. None of this + - BS."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,jackavsfan,10,Sun Jun 14 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"""Additionally, many schools add .33 for a + grade and subtract .33 for a − grade. Thus, a B+ yields a 3.33 whereas an A– yields a 3.67.""  Right from your link. I've never seen it any other way than that. Personally I think that this is the best way to do it, there's a huge difference between getting an 89 and an 80 and it should be reflected."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,TheZachster,6,Sun Jun 14 17:13:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know why they don't just weight the actual percentage grade with the credits, rather than grouping it out and making it less reflective of real performance."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,TheZachster,2,Sun Jun 14 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to say a 5 credit class with an A and a 3 credit class with a B should be higher than a 3.5? If that's the case, it's how my school does it. They call them ""quality points"" and it's how our GPA is calculated."
EngineeringStudents,39teck,carl_sagans_ghost__,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"That's how mine does it as well. But what im saying is rather than saying ""you got a flat B, that is 12/16 quality points for a four credit class"", you say "" you got an 86, that is 12.xx points"". I just don't see the point of ignoring the actual percentage grade. Sometimes it helps students, sometimes it hurts. Seems pretty senseless to me."
EngineeringStudents,39vajj,WowStrongArms,13,Mon Jun 15 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already, I would check out Paul's Online Notes, link's in the sidebar. He gives a great explanation of a topic and follows it up with practice problems and fully worked out solutions.  Calc II is not easy. There's a boatload of new techniques and material that you have never seen before. When I took the class I felt the same way you did, in that I never knew how to approach a problem, so here's my two-cents: When you begin a problem, instead of just jumping right in, try stepping back and asking yourself if you've seen that form of equation somewhere else, have you done something like this before? Chances are you have and the solution follows similar steps. Don't think you've seen it somewhere else? Think of the tools at your disposal, try using them. (Sometimes brute force does work) The more practice problems you do, the easier it gets. You'll begin to know what solution path to take based on the form of the equation, and intermediate algebra such as partial fraction decomposition becomes second nature.   Also, given that you're taking it in 8 weeks, yea you're basically getting slammed with information everyday, and don't have as much time as you would in a regular semester to absorb it. However, if you really are putting in 5 hours a day, you should be learning something.  Good luck."

I can't help you too much (since I haven't taken cal 2 in a while, and have never used it outside of cal 2), but what helped me TREMENDOUSLY was setting up a flow chart. You will eventually start finding patterns when you work enough problems. At that point, you can make a flowchart to help make your thinking process more efficient and waste less time.  The only thing I found useful from Cal 2 was becoming better at studying and learning power series. It's the first true weedout class you will have.   Good luck!"

EngineeringStudents,39u10k,rkkrqqqqrssss,14,Mon Jun 15 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"So, I've been doing some research in the biomechanical engineering lab. Basically, a lot of writing/running Matlab codes, which has been a good learning experience because I hardly used Matlab at all until this point. The project I'm working on is quantifying the physics of head injuries.  So, I got assigned a partner. I felt like I was probably doing about 80% of the work. However, he quit after about 2 weeks because he was unhappy that we weren't doing enough hands on experiments, and that the PhD student we're working for was vague about project goals.  So, at the end of last week, I discovered some fairly massive inconsistencies in the data, and realized that the way it was collected, and the way I was told to process it, were not conducive to each other. So, I basically have to redo my last 1-2 weeks worth of work.  Oh, and it looks like I'm still not getting paid.

I'd been applying everywhere, but with no responses even after the semester ended.  Applied everywhere like crazy after finals ended, to any place that still had openings, even if the commute would have been 2.5 hours to the next state.  My college's career advisor sent my resume in to a company, along with a recommendation, and I got it!  No formal interview, just a couple of chats, and then an employment offer email.  A note to people who are still scrambling for internships, because I know I wasn't the only one: there's still hope!  I actually got 2 offers, one right after the other, before deciding on my current internship.  My first day is tomorrow, and I'm fairly nervous, because it's in a discipline I'm not particularly good at (structural, I was hoping to find something geotech but oh well).

How can you help increase your chances? Some tips are below. You might think that these are obvious, but we're constantly surprised.  1) We notice when you are IMing/texting during meetings.  2) Dress appropriately. A friend at work calls some of the ladies 'skinterns'. The guys can be just as bad. I know about the argument ""it shouldn't matter what I dress like as long as I can do the job"", but the clothing helps project that are serious about the position.  3) Be there. I know that for many of you you're in a new place and it is very exciting, but first and foremost you need to be at work.  4) Pay attention to what's going on around you; take notes in meetings, ask relevant questions either then or later.  5) Recognize that you aren't special. As I said, we get hundreds of interns every summer and can pick and choose. We won't always pick the smartest; teamwork, communication, attitude, drive, etc all play a part.  6) Finally, do the work you were asked to do by the date you were asked to do it. If there's a problem, talk to people.  Good luck!"

Hopefully it will be implemented before I leave, it is cool to see things take place that you designed.   Outside of that Arizona is great even though it's hotter than anywhere else I have lived.   My advice to anyone with internships is to try and be proactive, learn everything you can, help whenever possibly. But you need to be tactful and not hover. Your supervisor likely has a full plate with you added on it. Show up to work in a good mood, be nice to everyone you meet, because an internship is technically a ~90 day interview."

I'm the first intern of the company, so there isn't the routine of having someone moderately unskilled in the office.

I'm in it for another two months, so I'm pretty pumped.   How I got the job: Mostly nepotism; my sister works as a graphic designer at the company, and suggested I apply, so I did, and they took me on immediately.   Advice: leverage everything you have.

Keep your eyes and ears open, listen to what people tell you about what you're doing. It's likely they've done it a lot and have developed a fairly efficient process.

Even if it's about something you won't directly be involved with during the internship, it shows you have a genuine interest in the process that happens inside a company.    After your first couple weeks of learning all there is to your position, don't be afraid to be self-directed. The worst kind of intern (or employee in general) is the kind that is competent but will only ever as work as far as you tell them to.

EngineeringStudents,39twuw,RS_Leben,2,Sun Jun 14 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"What the book is trying to say is that finding that distance ""d"" is more difficult than just breaking down the force into components and finding the net moment induced by those components. According to fig 4-17, Fy will create a positive (CCW) moment and Fx will create a negative (CW) moment. So   Mo=Fy(x) -Fx(y)=F*(d)   Which according to the figure will be a net moment in the CW (negative) direction.  It's easier to visualize if you do this: move Fx to the upper left corner and move Fy to the bottom right corner. We can do this because only the perpendicular distance from the axis counts, and we aren't changing this distance by moving the components in such a way. Now imagine O is at the center of a wheel with a radius of r=x=y. It should be apparent now what direction each forces is trying to turn the wheel, and therefore what moment should result from these forces.  Another thing to realize is that once you get into things like vibrations, the ""standard"" positive=CCW moment doesn't exist anymore, and what is positive and negative will depend on which direction you have defined the angle to be positive."
EngineeringStudents,39twuw,vendetta2115,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for that.  Made more sense when you put it that way but just for learning purposes..... am i discarding the RHR and making ""sense"" of it when dealing with components?  In my first post I detailed what I did when trying to use the rule, can you see where I went wrong?"
EngineeringStudents,39twuw,vendetta2115,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:11:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused about how you're implementing the RHR so I'm going to explain it the way I'd do it:  The moment of the force F about the point O is the net moment of the components Fx and Fy. Imagine standing at the point O. You extend your right arm along the x axis, and point your fingers in the direction of Fy. Your thumb is now pointing up, indicating a positive (CCW) moment. You do the same for Fx: if you extend your right arm along the y axis and point your fingers in the direction of Fx, your thumb points down, indicating a negative (CW) moment.  Basically, your shoulder is O, your arm is the perpendicular distance from O, your fingers are in the direction of the force, and your thumb points in the direction of the moment. You're still using the RHR, just individually for each component of the force.  Alternatively, you can just point your arm along D and point your fingers in the direction of F, and that will give you an equivalent moment. The reason that's not preferred is that finding the distance D is harder than simply resolving the forces into the x and y directions and adding their moments to get the net moment. This will become more clear later in the class, when you have several forces acting on a body at once that aren't aligned with your coordinate system.   I hope this helps. If you're still not clear on anything, just ask."

I often leave out my GPA and only leave my Major GPA and have gotten great internship offers just because I have great experience on my resume. I'm in a paid internship in construction management firm in NYC as well this summer.   So yes they won't heavily look at your GPA tell them the experience you have, and how you already know so much and eager to learn more at their company to have yourself grow. They rather have you who doesn't take much training an resources to a guy with a 4.0 and doesn't have any experience like you do."
EngineeringStudents,39t0y4,iareloading,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there are so many people that are looking for an internship/job and think the main thing employers want is gpa. The thing is, most people are capable of getting 3.5+ gpa if they put enough time in. However if you have less than that, but you have experience that directly relates to the field your looking for, it's much more helpful and useful for the employer. A good portion of the stuff you learn at school will be forgotten if you don't use it, but the design experience or rules of thumb you learn in the field will stay with you for life. The only time GPA becomes an issue is if you want to get into a research position/higher education, or if it is lower than maybe 2-2.5ish."

Work on your interviewing skills.  Couple quick thoughts. (1) I would not consider a 2.98 as sub-par.  If you're really worried about your GPA, them put your ""in major"" GPA instead of your overall GPA. (2) Put your internship experience near the too of your résumé followed by your research experience.  Generally experience is worth much more than your GPA.  Emphasize it. (3) Putting memberships in clubs/organizations on your résumé is good but showing leadership experience in those clubs is 10x better."

EngineeringStudents,39swyf,salierniwasokay,3,Sun Jun 14 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is definitely dependent on where exactly you are. If you're in the U.S., CS is probably the best in terms of job prospects and pay. I'm in Canada, and a although the U.S. and Canada aren't the exact same, I will say that it would be pretty hard to not find a job through CS up here! Mechanical and civil, on the other hand, are good fields (relative to the national averages and all), but not nearly as good as CS up here.   Your interests seem to line up more with mechatronics more than anything (a mix of ECE and mechanical). Not all schools offer that though. I think maybe CS with some hardware courses would also be a great fit, if your school offers that (at my school, the CS students have access to a lot of the ECE classes and can often take several robotics-related courses in upper years).   Summary: In terms of pure pay and prospects - I think CS is probably best. For your specific interests, maybe CS paired with hardware courses (similar to ECE) or something like mechatronics. You may not get exactly what you want through a traditional mechanical degree (depends on the school though)."

As I'm also studying in Delft I can tell you a few things:   No electronics/mechatronics in the first year of ME (will be in 2nd year) It IS really 'practical' at all times you have a project running where you physically make something... ... but it's still ME, lots of calculations too (but that fun too!) Talk to a study advisor! They really help you in this not-sure-if-I-should process and will also make sure you can keep some of your points when you do switch Personal tip: just follow your hart, it will find you your place :)   I'm enjoying ME a lot here in Delft, but have been doubting my decision since I started.

EngineeringStudents,39umd1,drthrawn,3,Mon Jun 15 00:19:56 2015 UTC,"First, keep in mind that you need to distinguish between the starting and ending quality. Let's start with the volumes you were given: V_l = V_g / 20. Total volume: V_tot = V_l + V_g = 21/20*V_g. Now, go back to what BroImTheShit said: v = V/m. Or, v_l = V_l / m_l and v_v = V_v / m_v.   Now let's go to the definition of quality: x_1 = m_g / m_tot = m_g / (m_g + m_l). If you combine this with our earlier equations you can solve for x_1 (by looking up v_f and v_g in your saturated tables). That make sense?

What I found out is that going in with an open mind makes a huge difference.   You don't know what you're doing really, and the employer knows that to a certain extent, so be ready to learn. Be engaged when someone is explaining something to you. And show that you are interested. If you have questions ask. If you have a bunch of questions on how to do something, write them down and come up with possible solutions and go to your boss or who ever you're doing work for and say here's the issue I ran into and here's a possible solution or an educated guess as to what it might be.

The higher degree mainly opens up different, more specialized jobs.  A PhD doesn't make you unemployable, it makes you unemployable for the same sort of jobs that people do right out of undergrad.  R&D and consulting are large employers of PhDs outside of academia (which is a small portion of PhD jobs anyway). Depends on what it is you want to do.  If you're unsure, it may help you explore and find what interests you enough to go to grad school for. Few, if any, will cover coursework only masters.  It's less the program and more your adviser.  If your PI has funding to support you, or can help lobby for a TA position for you, that helps.  If you can get a SMART scholarship, NDSEG or NSF fellowship, that's even better since they tend to pay better than TA stipends. Sounds maybe a little high unless you're including summer (which you'll either need your PI to pay you to work on research or make other arrangements such as research based internships and programs) First place to talk to is your potential adviser (not the academic counselor advisers you get in undergrad, but the professors under whom you'd be doing research)."
EngineeringStudents,39ubxu,meerkatmreow,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:53:07 2015 UTC,"No idea unfortunately, I'm a CivE.  I know my school has one, although how good it is, I don't know. It depends on what you're after.  A Masters generally seems to have a good return on investment since you start making more money for 1-2 more years of school.  I've heard from my dad (PhD in ocean wave behavior) that having a PhD will put you into a specialist niche in the industry, which can pay very well, but can be difficult to find jobs.  Apparently he has contacts in most of the industry by keeping in touch with 10-12 good recruiters, so its a pretty small area.  You also probably wouldn't rise too far away from your original work.  A Masters still allows for some flexibility in that area. I'd say all engineering fields require just your bachelor's for some pretty great jobs.  A Master's can open a lot more doors though, at the expense of some time. If you have a high GPA, you can get your Master's covered no problem.  If you have a fairly high GPA, you can probably get something worked out for a PhD.  I'm going to a pretty good school in the Fall, I was accepted with a 3.734 but I didn't get any funding.  My friend did however, I think he had a 3.96 or something obscene.   This was for Masters Programs however, for which funding is more scarce.  If you went for a PhD, I think you could even have a 3.6 and you'd get funding if you had a good enough application. Grad student stipends vary based on institution as well as the surrounding area.  I have a friend getting a $65,000 stipend from Stanford, of which $40,000 goes right back in tuition and something like $16-18,000 goes to housing.  I also know someone getting a $15,000 stipend at Rutgers, and they're living at home and making it work, so it varies. There are a bunch of scholarships and awards for people seeking graduate degrees.  Many of them have specific prerequisites, however you should be able to apply to a few."
EngineeringStudents,39tso4,salierniwasokay,4,Sun Jun 14 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"I took linear algebra online.  We had some assignments submitted online, but exams were taken in an on-campus testing center.  Calculus is probably going to be OK online becsus there are lots and lots of online resources and free video lectures for a class that fundamental.  I would not recommend taking an online math course more advanced than Cal 3, though.  As the material becomes more specialized, it becomes harder and harder to find extra online resources.  The most commonly recommended online resources for self-instruction are Khan Academy and MIT's Open CourseWare lectures.  Edit:  Cal 1 is pretty easy IF YOU KEEP UP WITH THE HOMEWORK. It is hard work and time-consuming though. It's really a very systematic application of a few rules. The hardest part is the algebra.  Once you get past the first exam, you'll spend about 10% of your time doing the actual calculus, then the rest of your time will be spent using algebra to simplify your answer."

EngineeringStudents,39tso4,slapthefrenchman,2,Sun Jun 14 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"I've taken a few online courses, and it kind of varies from course to course. Professors seem to have gotten wise to the time management issues that have plagued online courses (do it on your own time, everything due at the end of the semester leading to a lot of procrastination) and have taken a more traditional approach, with due dates throughout the semester. I've had some math courses where all the quizzes were multiple choice, some where you had to type an answer. With ones where you had to type the answer in, you might get initially marked wrong for syntax, but the professor reviewed all the answers and would give credit for answers. Also, in courses I've taken, you had to take finals, and sometimes midterms, on campus, so be aware of that possibility."

Also, we have the option of dropping it halfway through, so I guess that's nice.   Thanks for the insight. I think I'll sign up for this regardless and see how it goes. If I start out poorly, I'll just drop it and take it in the fall."

I actually really enjoyed it because I was forced to learn it all on my own - definitely tougher, but I think I learned the content more thoroughly than I would have otherwise.   The structure of the class was very similar to a regular class as far as regular due dates etc. We took quizzes on each textbook section that had unlimited attempts, we would also turn in written assignments where we were graded on showing work. For tests we would submit the answers then email the prof a scanned copy of our work for partial credit.   I'm sure ymmv but with this particular prof things worked great. If I ever got really stuck she was really good about finding a time to meet, but for the most part I worked through it on my own and learned it very well as a result. I finished with a 98 in the class."
EngineeringStudents,39tso4,RS_Leben,2,Sun Jun 14 22:54:49 2015 UTC,"I took calculus 3 online at a nearby community college. So how it worked was that lectures were videos online on a website called Blackboard and I would go there for the video lectures, notes, and supplementary material as well as homework problems.   I had 3 tests: two midterms and a final. The way that it was set up was that I had to go to the community college to take my exams at a testing center, and there were no exceptions. I made an appointment with the center so that my professor knew when I would need my materials.   I've also taken an online class at my actually university where there was an option to take the test online if you lived far from the university, you had to pay extra for a service where a proctor would watch you via webcam while you took the test. I didn't do that so I don't know how well that worked."

Minimum cutoff for grad school is generally 3.0, but there's plenty of anecdotal situations which say you can still make it with lower.  If you think that's low, you need to take a step back and assess your situation, just a bit. Not saying it can't be higher, but saying what you have is inadequate is absurd.   How can I make these schools focus on the courses that actually mater (upper division) and somewhat ignore my overall gpa which is being dragged down by boring and tedious GE classes?   You can't change their method of evaluation. Not a single bit. It is beyond your power as a mere mortal.   The only thing you can change is you. For example, being ""dragged down by boring and tedious GE classes."" Just because it's not engineering doesn't mean you should throw in the towel. The purpose of college to become a well rounded individual, not just learn engineering. This includes writing, literature, music, arts, other sciences, etc. Just because they're not engineering classes ""which actually matter"" doesn't mean you should neglect them.   If anything, neglecting them shows poor form. Very rarely will you be working on ""just engineering,"" especially if you are going to for a graduate program. You will need to handle yourself outside of your own skillset, whatever that may be.   Engineering won't help you for jack shit on 2/3rds of the GRE. Writing and Verbal aren't priorities, but if you bomb them because they're ""boring and tedious,"" say goodbye to your goal.  The rest of the world isn't at fault here.  You are."

I practice a bit more afterwords and they're starting to makes sense, but they're fundamental to Calc 2 so I really need to practice some more)."
EngineeringStudents,39sxm4,cantorsparadox,2,Sun Jun 14 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Don't retake it, you know the material well. Just buckle down and focus on Calc 2."
EngineeringStudents,39tjvm,civilghost,2,Sun Jun 14 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"at least 1/3 of the classes you will take, and maybe close to 1/2, will be on subjects other than your degree. University is supposed to prepare you in all areas of human knowledge. Usually you have a varied pool of classes to choose from from each of the main categories such as of history, art, humanities, economics and  english.  Although some are mandatory  (history, english etc). How tough are the classes? from my experience it all depends on the teacher rather than the subject.  Piece of advice: do not pick the ""easy teachers"". Yea you might get an A, but remember you are PAYING to get an education and you might as well get your moneys worth.  Any subject can be hard if you a) have a dickwad for a professor, b) you are undermotivated, c) you are not that bright.. d)?? .... If  you are in the C category, don't worry you might have to put in a bit more time than the average student but if you have dedication and passion you will be fine."
EngineeringStudents,39tjvm,aarrodri,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:25:17 2015 UTC,But it doesn't involve learning things like history or something. That is my main worry I am not good at that.
EngineeringStudents,39tjvm,vendetta2115,2,Sun Jun 14 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"You could start by, you know, looking at the degree audit for your intended major. That will tell you what classes you'll be taking."
EngineeringStudents,39tjvm,IsuspectJaundice,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"As /u/aarrodri said, you will actually have to take GE courses not related to your major (like history). So memorization will be a part of your college experience no matter what. As for your engineering classes, there will be some basic equations that you will be expected to learn (ie distance formula, Kirchoff's laws, etc) but the most important part will be understanding the concepts, as many classes like physics will give you some sort of equation sheet to use come midterms."
EngineeringStudents,39rnjm,theryansleepstonight,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"(Shameless plug for my school) but Johns Hopkins has a Masters in BME from the Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design, which is more design focused and most of its graduates end up in industry.

EngineeringStudents,39rnjm,Baoom,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:25:39 2015 UTC,Hi! I'm actually fairly interested in the BME graduate program at JHU. I'm a rising senior studying materials engineering at UW with a bio/nanomaterials focus. Do you have any advice about the application process? I'd also like to know what you think about the traditional vs. CBID program?
EngineeringStudents,39rnjm,guitard00d123,2,Sun Jun 14 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"Hey there! All of my experiences are purely anecdotal but to me Hopkins has historically been very research focused, and the curricula across all disciplines reflects that. Over the past 5 years however there has been a concerted effort to make Hopkins more industry-savvy people and make Hopkins an appealing place for business minded people (for example, Hopkins just helped open a startup incubator in Baltimore). I would say the CBID program leverages its research power with a growing entrepreneurial base to provide students a well-rounded exploration of bioengineering and design in a business context. That said, the program is fairly new and rapidly changing, and I personally feel that it may be a bit too specialized in the sense that it's hard to do something other than bioengineering design with a CBID degree (i.e. you should be absolutely sure this is what you want to do before pigeonholing yourself). The MS in BME program is more traditional and very research heavy, and probably wouldn't touch too much on the entrepreneurial side. This is good for people who want to end up in academia/R&D. Unfortunately I can't really speak for the application process (I'm an undergrad) but I do know the CBID program interviews are more problem-solving (sort of like case study interviews) whereas the MS program would probably focus on research experience and coursework.   I'd be happy to answer any other questions you have, hope that was helpful! Best of luck!"

I'm already in society of petroleum engineers, a fraternity, and a jazz band, and I already have my classmates weathering the storm with me. I think my problem is not knowing when to say ""no"" to social things, and that forcing myself into some sort of understanding for x amount of hours would be better than seeking help from my TAs, which none of these top 10 students seem to need to do."
EngineeringStudents,39s8mq,candydaze,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:11:10 2015 UTC,"At your stage of schooling, any experience like that can make you stand out. If you're applying for internships early in your career, you'll be against people with a little retail experience or no experience whatsoever. Use that in your favour. It shows that you've worked in a related industry, and that you have a passion for chemical engineering.   At the end of the day, apply anyway, particularly to smaller firms. As your GPA gets better, you can work your way up to the bigger companies, using experience from smaller companies as a leg up. If they knock you back, all you've lost is the time spent preparing your resume/cover letter. But that's all good practice.   If you can communicate your passion genuinely, it will help you immensely. Make sure you know a lot about the industry. Who the major players are, what their strengths and weaknesses are, how their financial performance is going, all that kind of stuff. What the challenges facing the industry are, where you see it going in the future. Do your research! Be able to hold a good, in-depth, academic conversation about the industry if you do get to meet someone worth knowing in it.   And finally, if you don't get it, it's not the end of the world. Your career will last 45-50 years. You will not be doing the same job for all that time. I've known chemical engineers that went via senior management and HR into psychology and personality typing consulting. If you finish school and can't land a job in O&G, you can still get in, just a bit later."

I work on the upstream side and I have many coworkers who came from a wide variety of industries.  Right now times are tough.  Oil and gas companies are either on hiring freezes or are hiring very very few people.  I would give it your best shot trying to get into O&G if you have a passion for it, but don't be afraid to accept another job.  O&G firms will look at your favorably with some experience in a different industry."

Dr. Goldberg has been spending many long hours working on that and we should be accredited either this year or the next. While the original commenter was being a bit pompous, devaluing another institution's worth based on issues you haven't begun to state the additional circumstances about is not so great either. The academic fraud is related to a single department serving primarily the sports teams.

I started this as a final project in my bioinformatics class and now I'll be working on it further over the summer (which started today because I'm on the quarter).  So far, I've gotten the image data to be readable in grayscale and in a static read-in format, although in an inconvenient way because learning extra Python modules on top of a full course load was...taxing, to say the least. Now I'll fix the problems with what I have now and try to get the data in color so multiple regions can be looked at per frame instead on nitpicking a few. Then I'l try to make this whole thing go real time  I'm really hoping that this translates well for my chances at this prof's lab at least, because his work in neuroscience is extremely interesting to me, and computational bio is something I know I need to get better at.

EngineeringStudents,39r9w0,drevyek,4,Sun Jun 14 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a mechanical student, and 8 gigs of RAM is fine for FEA simulation, MATLAB, SolidWorks, etc. for me. On a budget, I'd go with 8 instead of 16."
EngineeringStudents,39r9w0,danmanmoo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:57:45 2015 UTC,Ditto. My new i5/8GB RAM/SSD chugs through MATLAB and SolidWorks like a champ. My renders are a little slow but my gtx 960 tries the best it can.
EngineeringStudents,39r9w0,hockeychick44,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'd go with 8gb of RAM, a smallish SSD to put the OS and key software on (SW, Ansys, Matlab), a 5400 rpm (min) HDD, a Intel i5 (most software can't even take advantage of the i7's capabilities), and a dedicated graphics card. I have a AMD Radeon 6950 that is about 5 years old and it still handles SW just fine. Rendering can take some time though. There are much better options at a similar price out there now. Check out parts on Newegg.com. They often give outstanding rebates and you can really save some money. A good keyboard and mouse is really important as well. If you're a CAD god, dual monitors are probably one of the first upgrades to look into. That and a larger SSD."

I know life is difficult, but he is young, which is why I wanted to see if I could help get him on a good start, rather than going in blind.   In my opinion he doesn't have to go to MIT. But maybe there are some other suggestions? He has one year left of high school where he could really kick ass and apply to the right places, scholarships, and do well on his test.

EngineeringStudents,39qrud,rossland,3,Sat Jun 13 23:46:25 2015 UTC,"These are two extremely important questions you need to ask yourself. Pursuing a PhD is not an easy task. You will be facing moments where there is a lot of self-doubt, frustration, and failure.   I've worked in research labs with graduate students for almost three years and saw them every step of the way as they pursued the PhD. My mentor, in fact, essentially started work on his PhD about a year before I was assigned to him, and I was there alongside him for all those late nights in the lab and writing/analyzing data. You will have to sacrifice a lot in order to come out with a PhD.  If you want to go to grad school, my advice first is to figure out why you want a degree. If you just want a degree for a higher paycheck in the end...well, sticking with the BSc or getting a Master's is a lot more appropriate. If you want to have the potential to do a lot of things that nobody's done before, or be a part of more in-depth topics, then you might want to take a shot at getting a PhD.  Also there is no reason why you couldn't also work for a year or so, first. My PI did that (worked for a year before going for his PhD), and I'm currently heading to a job to work for a bit before pursuing an advanced degree myself. That way you can get a more accurate sense of what you think you need, what you enjoy, and whether or not you feel the time spent will be worth it."
EngineeringStudents,39qrud,ElXGaspeth,2,Sun Jun 14 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a specific career goal that requires a graduate degree at the moment. The main reason I am thinking about a graduate degree is because I thought I would be more likely to find a job I'd really enjoy.   I was really excited to get the research position I have at the national lab I'm at, which I thought would be a dream job. After working here I don't know if I'd be happy doing this work long term. A lot of the engineers here seem unhappy.   I have been told by a few of my professors that I would do well in a graduate program and I should pursue it. I feel as though I would be wasting a great opportunity (free grad school) if I do not go after at least a masters degree even if I don't see a specific reason for it at the moment."
EngineeringStudents,39qrud,rossland,3,Sun Jun 14 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"That is not unreasonable... just keep in mind, a ""free"" chance to work very hard for 2-3 years is still more expensive than 2-3 years in industry."

These jobs are not ideal for me though."
EngineeringStudents,39qrud,concernedaboutfrienz,2,Sun Jun 14 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"Given my ""about me"" information, what level of schools would likely accept me and give me funding?     Don't know. Your GPA is high, but without knowing your GRE I can't tell how your school's grading compares nationally. Recommendations and personal statement also matter.     How much does the schools name/prestige matter for an engineering graduate degree?     As is true for all things in life, wherever you go matters way less than whoever you meet and network with. That said, a prestigious school can provide you with a crazy alumni network that will get your foot into tons of doors and interviews, but you can also absolutely find the same at a smaller/lesser known school. What you do wherever you go will matter most (ie, ""you get out of it what you put into it""), but if you did the same mediocre sort of getting by at both a lesser known school and a ""prestigious"" one, you'd probably fair better at the latter just by default of having the name of the school do some of the work for you.    Is a graduate degree a good idea for me with so little work experience, should I get an engineering job and then come back to school in ~5 years?     Completely up to you and also what you want to do. Do you want an engineering job in industry? If so, what kind of job? If you're not sure, go look up a bunch and do some research on them. What are companies you think you'd be interested working for? What do the job descriptions for jobs you're interested in with these companies look like? Go find some. Do they sound like they prefer masters/PhD students over bachelors? How much do they equate ""MS/PhD"" to years of work experience (ie, some job postings say ""BS + 3 years experience, or MS + 2 years, or PhD + 1 year"" or something along that framework; some don't care at all and just want a BS).    Or do you like research and academia? That is absolutely a PhD track.   Is a graduate degree in mechanical engineering, likely in vibrations, a good idea at all?     See previous question. It depends what you want to do. Yes, it's a great idea if you wanna do something in that field. It's a horrible idea if you want to be a pet groomer. This is such a vague question.     I am interested in all concentrations of mechanical engineering. Is there a concentration with a better job security and/or earning potential than vibrations that I should be looking for?     Google is your friend."

First of all, no one cares about your grades even if you just graduated.  You are not an engineer if you have just a bachelor degree. You have to take a 3 year bachelor degree and a 2 year master to be considered one.  There are no general ME or EE degrees but more specialized ones such as power generation/distribution, microelectronics or telecommunications instead of EE."

We have a faculty of Engineering, Bio-Engineering and Engineering Technology (of which I'm in the latter) and we also have business engineers at the faculty of Economics.   While 'Engineering Technology' isn't always used for 'real' engineers, Belgium has this weird system in which there are different types of engineers depending on the approach that is used during the courses. The faculty of (Bio-)Engineering is very theoretical and is often closely related to the exact sciences in the approach towards problems whilst my faculty (ET) takes a more engineering-based way and gives room for practical applications.   EDIT: A Bachelor's degree is alway followed by a Master, otherwise you're not considered as an engineer."

EngineeringStudents,39oyv3,GabrielZAC,3,Sat Jun 13 17:07:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comments everyone.  So I think the main differences are:   Americans have to do a certain amount of general studies (not required in Australia). More places than not it takes 5 years to become an engineer (in Australia it is 4 years). Engineers Australia requires 60 days of work experience with a professional engineer before graduating (not sure how many other countries require something like this).   But the subjects seem to be more or less the same between universities. Only difference seems to be the amount of major specific electives offered.

EngineeringStudents,39rrzd,Zlateh_The_Goat,3,Sun Jun 14 05:32:13 2015 UTC,"Engineering is oftentimes more of a system game than pure brains. No matter how smart you are, if you can't study properly, you will do very poorly. But, conversely, if you study properly, you can do quite well, despite, not  understanding everything.   If you work hard, but still are middling, it will be a very uphill struggle. You end up in a haze of living numbers, and eating formulas. It becomes very second nature, and it pervades your thinking. You really do need to be pretty good in math to do well. You don't need to be the best, but you need to be able to grab these concepts quickly and efficiently, because you only have so much time between your courses.   Try to be honest with yourself- do you think you can do it? It is a funnel, designed to weed out those who cannot hack the program. If you are determined to work hard, and to be proactive about your studies, you'll probably be fine. Apathy to marks is a killer more than almost anything. People get a shit mark, and figure ""eh, it's just one mark, one quiz, I'll bounce back"", and then do nothing about it. I got a goddammed 14% on my 2nd (of 5) quiz in Linear Algebra in first year, but pulled my shit together and got 100% on the last to salvage a C+.   it isn't hard, but not impossible. And yeah, you can have been very good in high school and shit the bed in Uni if you don't work. Important to remember is that you do not, by any means, have a free pass, ever. I had a bud in 1st year who got ~90's across the board, but came to uni, and failed literally every single assessment for the entire semester- all of them. It happens. Another bud was in your position, of doing meh in HS, but has been rocking it in uni. They're different games.   Basically: do you actually like math? or is it just the job prospect? Either path can get you through, but actually liking math makes it a fuckload easier."

Will you know the test grade before the drop deadline? Also, I'm not sure about your school, but my school has a distinction between dropping and withdrawing from a class. You can drop a class within a certain amount of time of the beginning, and not have it show up on your transcript (but for summer classes, the window for this is like 2 or 3 days). A withdraw will show up on the transcript, but won't hurt your GPA for the first two, and can be done almost half way through the semester.  Sometimes dropping is the safest bet."

In general, I know people who have switched majors and ended up not adding any time to their degree because they take summer classes to make up material, and I know others that added a year or two, so it can really vary. Just consult someone from your school and make sure you really want to switch, since I know one class won't show you what the rest of the degree is like."
EngineeringStudents,39rl8x,sentienttoast,2,Sun Jun 14 03:39:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed.

EngineeringStudents,39rwot,dzjc,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:47:39 2015 UTC,It's a voltage controlled voltage source so it measures 2 * the voltage through the resister.
EngineeringStudents,39rwot,dzjc,2,Mon Jun 15 01:06:56 2015 UTC,Take another look at what you've drawn in qucs.  Are you really measuring the voltage across the resistor?  Is R4 properly connected?
EngineeringStudents,39rwot,dzjc,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sure.  I made a test with a simpler voltage dependent voltage source circuit.   R4 is connected ""backwards"" but I accounted for it by making G = -2"

EngineeringStudents,39npvm,spencerawr,7,Sat Jun 13 05:59:46 2015 UTC,"Better sooner than later. Heres what I would do: ask a professor or a peer what kind of calculus topics you would use on the class to help narrow down your work and focus. Sit down once a day and work through a section. If it really boggles you, watch a couple videos on the subject and sleep on it. Watch the video again the next day and try to remember what the person does before they do it. This'll help with your problem solving skills, and indirectly with your understanding of the topics (I always felt like knowing how to do the problem was a better way to understand the topic than lectures and reading theory). Once you feel you get it, do (if you have Stewart book) the red problems from that section.   Once you get a good feel for it, look at some guided solutions for the new classes. See how the calculus is applied (some professors are better than others at this in my experience). Life's a learning experience, so maybe you can take this as an opportunity to form a habit of reviewing older material that's important."
EngineeringStudents,39npvm,gjoeyjoe,16,Sat Jun 13 09:05:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's helpful, but in EE I felt the same way about not having understood light and wave mechanics when we got to semiconductors, diff eq when we got to signals and vector calculus when we got to E&M stuff. Each time I thought ""this is it. It's all over here. I'll be a janitor."" I then realized that there is usually jobs or areas in your field that require more intuition than analysis, and that seemed the right choice for me. The kids who are really good in class might not always be the smartest out in the field. You have to search and find your niche, learn enough to get through the stuff you suck at and power through. Sometimes it feels like the fight is lost, but it's not over till it's over. They also purposefully try to scare you out all of junior year basically. And make you feel like a dumbass for not knowing the science of EVERYTHING. one day you realize that they're really just trying to make themselves feel better for being so theoretical and not practicing what they've learned."

EngineeringStudents,39q3lb,Chachis96,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:34:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm just another engineering student, but I have some advice still. First of all, if you're new to computer science it's not a big deal. You definitely need to learn a couple languages though and try to become familiar with what different languages are used for and how they differ. I would focus on this during the summer of you have nothing else to do. Also, do something that can be seen as comparable experience to an internship. Create an app, a program, join a completion, just do something related to what you want to do that would be worthy of a resume. Above all though, it's all about who you know. Ask friends and family if they know anyone that could help you out getting an internship, especially if they're involved with an engineering related business. I currently work as an intern at a Fortune 200 company and almost all of our 50 interns have been personally recommended by a current employee rather than just getting chosen out of a stack of applicants. Find connections. Make connections. Talk to professors. It's all about the networking. Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,39pxdx,Avicenna1,4,Sat Jun 13 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"I find integration harder than differentiation. Taking derivatives is fairly straightforward in that there's always a simple and straightforward rule to apply (like the power rule). Taking integrals often requires a lot more creativity (or just a whole lot of practice) and ingenuity. There are general methods to use for certain types of functions, but it's much more nuanced."

EngineeringStudents,39pxdx,Heidi423,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"Calc 2 is often procedurally the hardest calc class because it's a damn lot of integrals of different types.

EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"It's a tiny startup company. The founder is doing client services which brings in revenue while the ""new product development"" group (all interns) basically work together. It's more educational than anything since our side doesn't bring in revenue. I was provided with Atmel Design and some other programs. Basically I'll be meeting at the office once or twice a week to catch up while at home I work on familiarizing myself with the software."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,faceinthegrass,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:48:54 2015 UTC,so you found the position randomly online and just applied?
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:10:48 2015 UTC,"Nah I was looking for engineering groups on meetup.com and found an organizer that had two groups I was checking out. His bio said to find him on LinkedIn and after I did we connected. Then he messaged me the next day offering the internship, had a phone and in person interview."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,faceinthegrass,3,Sat Jun 13 11:52:32 2015 UTC,"Shoprite represent! Seafood, 2010-2015.  Serious answer, though, see if you can do some research. Talk to old professors, see if you can help them out with any of their projects, or if they'll mentor you on any of your own."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,tomanonimos,2,Fri Jun 12 21:09:12 2015 UTC,What type of engineer are you?
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:06:59 2015 UTC,mechanical engineer
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,tomanonimos,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"Learn CAD, MatLab, and Python. Also look for volunteer opportunities. Ideally things related to mechanical engineering (or something you can word it to sound related to mechanical engineering) but if you cant then just get a volunteer position and use it to network."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:07:15 2015 UTC,"so forget about part time job? I did learn solidworks, creo last semester."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,tomanonimos,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not a ME so I can't answer that for you. I find internships related to your career and learn coding languages which you will probably face in your career more helpful then a part time job. That being said, if you are not in good financial standing then I would recommend a part-time job and if you can learn coding."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"oh no, my parents are supporting me along with financial aid so it's not a problem. It's just that I don't want the recruiters think that I haven't done anything ever since my last part time job."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,NotBrittnye,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:30:37 2015 UTC,How about for a chemical engineer?
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,tomanonimos,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:50:03 2015 UTC,Too out of my expertise.
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,spencerawr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:50:45 2015 UTC,What's your GPA?  You can look into doing a project over the summer and start looking for jobs and making connections now. You can never start too soon. I recommend filling out your linkedin and going to career fairs next year. Start in September and don't let up until you get a job offer.
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:39:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I talked to my career advisor and she told me to prepare your resume during summer and start applying from fall semester. GPA wise, it's sub 2.x because I've been having depression all my years... So part-time job is a waste of time right now? I've thinking of office/managing part-time if that ever helps..."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,Shaddow1,3,Fri Jun 12 23:51:23 2015 UTC,why are you using 2 accounts?
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,spencerawr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:12:04 2015 UTC,Doing anything better than nothing. Take a part time job. Save that money. Work on a project in your free time.   Sub 3.0 GPA isn't that big a deal. I have a 2.7 and I'm not too concerned to be honest. One internship and heading into my last two quarters.
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,tomanonimos,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:05:52 2015 UTC,As long as its at least a 2.5 gpa you have a fighting chance.
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:08:09 2015 UTC,"does it really matter though, in the end people won't put gpa on resume if it's not really high"
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,tomanonimos,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:16:41 2015 UTC,The problem comes when an employer asks for your GPA. A gpa lower than a 2.5 sends up red flags.
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,spencerawr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:39:56 2015 UTC,I've had ~10 interviews. Didn't list a GPA on my resume and never had anyone ask during any process.
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,tomanonimos,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"Out of the 10 interviews I have done only one had asked me about my gpa. It seemed to imply that it was an HR requirement.   I know for a fact, didnt interview with them,  intel had a gpa requirement so yea that mattered."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,christyu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:54:00 2015 UTC,"well regardless of whether my gpa is below that or not, I'm still gonna work hard as usual and raise gpa so I guess it won't matter haha."
EngineeringStudents,39mrgu,bike0121,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"Do a personal project (like a robot or a rocket or something), research with a prof, help out with FSAE or another club, anything engineering - I'd say don't just ""learn programming languages"" unless you have a specific goal of a program you want to make - you need to have something to show for it.  Just do something engineering, doesn't matter if you don't have an internship - you can make something yourself, or with friends. It's amazing what you can accomplish if you put your mind to it and don't get discouraged! Then keep doing awesome engineering stuff on the side during the school year (and try really hard to bring your GPA up to 3.0 if there's any way to do that)."
EngineeringStudents,39nla6,d1rron,3,Sat Jun 13 01:01:22 2015 UTC,"That is what lead me to learn about Engineering Physics, which I realize wouldn't be anything like being a theoretical or experimental physics.   I'm confused as to what you mean by this, because you certainly will be taking some courses that are purely theoretical or experimental physics courses. Most of the Physics courses we take we take with physics majors who are aspiring to be theoretical or experimental physicists or astronomers.   Sure Eng Phys isn't really the same as pure physics, but its not all that different as well."
EngineeringStudents,39nla6,Jorlung,3,Sat Jun 13 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"I understand that I'd take many of the same physics courses, such as quantum mechanics and such. I meant that I figured the actual career would be very different from theirs. I mentioned it because I had said that I have a strong (layman) interest in physics. If it was practical, I'd pursue theoretical physics -- but it's extremely competitive and there's a good chance, from what I understand, that I'd not end up doing the kind of thing I'd want to do (research,/academia) for the academic commitment. I'm 29 and have a kid on the way, so I think theoretical or experimental are probably out for me. Engineering physics seems like a nice compromise between engineering and physics. I admit I don't have a strong understanding of the field of engineering physics. I'm not even sure I'll be able to get into a program since only a few schools even remotely near me offer it.   I'd be interested in any insight or advice that you have!  Thanks for the reply to my post."
EngineeringStudents,39nla6,lrrlrr,2,Sat Jun 13 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Engineering Physics is being phased out as a field in general. You may have have to look farther to find a 4 year program to transfer into. Any engineering major will require 3-4 semesters of general physics so you'll get your fill, and many engineering courses utilize physical concepts. EE and ME are much more practical for employment. FWIW I chose EE because I enjoyed my E&M class."
EngineeringStudents,39nla6,Jorlung,0,Sat Jun 13 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"Really? From what I've seen some colleges (Stanford for example) only started getting the program in the past few years. I was under the impression it was sort of a new field, or at least a new actual major."
EngineeringStudents,39nla6,mountainoyster,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, generally people who pursue Eng Phys degrees either end up working a pure Engineering job anyway or pursue masters in more specialized fields. If you do have an interest in Physics, Eng Phys is a nice compromise between the two as you said. It also gives you a stronger mathematical background because of the nature of what you're studying as an Eng Phys student. But obviously if you're taking more math and physics courses, something has to give way and that something is generally the more ""hands-on"" stuff like manufacturing labs and such.  I noticed especially in our 2nd year Fluids class, pretty much everyone in Eng Phys breezed through it because we had a much better understanding of the mathematics behind it compared to those in the regular MechE stream.  But honestly, I don't know if I'd recommend it for everyone. Personally I want to pursue a Masters in MechE/AeroE with a specialization in something like Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, and an Eng Phys degree allowed me to pretty much take all the Fluids/Aero courses that regular MechEs would take, while also getting a bit of a stronger math background which is important for grad school. But honestly, if I were to pursue a job after undergrad, I probably would just be treated as a regular MechE undergrad and not really get any preferential treatment even though an Eng Phys degree is a little more difficult and a little more work than a MechE degree (at least in most Canadian schools).  I'm not really sure what exactly to say about it, I'm kind of just rambling, but if you have any specific questions I'd be glad to answer."
