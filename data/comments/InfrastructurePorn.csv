InfrastructurePorn,3dychv,MeEvilBob,4,Mon Jul 20 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"Do you know more detailed info on the history of that? Has DCR in the past tried to work with CSX/PanAm railways/the previous owners to get the path protected under the arch or have we simply decided that we need to prioritise high-speed vehicles on Storrow Drive over bikes/peds?  If you walk that path all the time, you may be aware of the fact that MassDOT has been planning a realignment of the Pike next to this bridge. I'm not aware of any historical protection of the Grand Junction Bridge itself, but it would be worth considering rebuilding the Allston landing to allow the path to continue under it on land rather than over the wooden bridge.  If we can get MassDOT to chose a cheaper alignment, we may be able to win partial reconstruction of Grand Junction on this side of the Charles and improvements to DCR land for non-car users. At the moment, MassDOT has placed better parkland connectivity into a third 'bucket' of projects for which they have decided they 'currently have no money'..."
InfrastructurePorn,3dychv,digitalsciguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"The Grand Junction Railroad is primarily used for shuttling MBTA equipment back and forth between the two halves of the commuter rail system.  CSX is the freight operator, but as far as I know they don't have any active customers that require it's use.  It was originally double tracked and is now mostly single track except for a siding near the MIT campus.  The second track was also removed from the bridge, which still has the girders for it.  It would be neat to have a bike path running alongside the active track, especially since it's so unlikely to need the second track restored any time in the forseeable future."
InfrastructurePorn,3dychv,deathtopumpkins,4,Mon Jul 20 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"Per my memory and the Wikipedia article, Grand Junction was sold by CSX to the state. It is still used by PanAm Railways CSX, Amtrak, and, as you mentioned, by MBTA to shuttle equipment between the north and south sides.  The state has identified the corridor as part of their future DMU/'Purple Line'/rapid regional network plans, so it's doubtful they'd put a rail trail into Cambridge over the bridge, especially since they just refurbished the BU bridge with bike lanes.  Any future refurbishment of the bridge - for either the Pike realignment or upgrade of the corridor for rapid regional rail service - would be a good opportunity to widen the span that goes over Storrow Drive/Soldiers Field Road and straighten the Dr. Paul Dudley White Bike Path.  Edit: PanAm Railways doesn't use the Grand Junction; their operations are chiefly north and west of Boston."
InfrastructurePorn,3dychv,digitalsciguy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"Clarification:  The GJ is owned by the state, and used regularly by the MBTA and Amtrak to shuttle equipment.  CSX runs daily freight service to Everett Terminal from Framingham over it.  Pan Am has never been involved in the GJ.  Long term plans call for the bridge to stay in place, as it is a vital piece of rail infrastructure. While yes, the state has considered running some Worcester trains into North Station via the GJ, and has also proposed DMU shuttles running North-Kendall-West, they would be using the existing or a replaced GJ bridge, likely with the second track restored. Any future Urban Ring service would use an additional bridge or tunnel at this approximate location, and may use part of the GJ right-of-way, but will not replace it."

Ah, yes. I'll defer to your superior knowledge of freight carriers and operations.  One way or another, touching the bridge is also a prime opportunity to improve the path and connectivity to DCR land by widening the spans over Soldiers Field Road/Storrow Drive. Now that the Grand Junction Bridge is under state ownership, that's one less battle that needs to be fought when the time comes."

With an overall length of 14 km, it includes a 4.4 km bridge and 9.6 km tunnel underneath the bay—the fourth-longest underwater tunnel in the world  At the bridge–tunnel crossover point, there is an artificial island called Umihotaru (海ほたる Umi-hotaru?, literally meaning ""sea firefly"") with a rest area consisting of restaurants, shops and amusement facilities. Air is supplied to the tunnel by a distinctive tower in the middle of the tunnel, called the Kaze no Tō (風の塔, ""the tower of wind""), which uses the bay's almost-constant winds as a power source.  The road opened on December 18, 1997 after 23 years of planning and 9 years of construction at a cost of 1.44 trillion yen (11.2 billion USD at the time of opening).  One goal expressed during the planning of the Aqua-Line was to reduce the traffic through downtown Tokyo, but as the highway toll is quite high, the reduction in Tokyo traffic has not been as great as expected.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Bay_Aqua-Line"

InfrastructurePorn,3dnwvh,steavoh,2,Sat Jul 18 08:42:31 2015 UTC,"Probably struggles tbh. Construction costs were $1.44 trillion yen ($1.44bln USD). Toll is 3000 yen ($30).   That's 480 million vehicle trips to break even. Given that an optimum capacity highway moves around 2000 vehicles an hour that's 13 years of operation.  13 years of continuous operation, with no off peak or congestion.  In reality, once you add in wages, maintenance costs, etc it's quite possible this project will never break even.   You'd think they'd have put in a rail line instead. It looks like they had to build a new motorway in Kisarazu, whereas rail links are already there. In Tokyo the Haneda monorail is very near, an extension of that would probably require a far less expensive bridge and smaller tunnel and could terminate at the existing rail station near the eastern terminus of the tunnel."

I'm not particularly fond of Dubai, and have personally seen the living quarters of the poor migrant workers... and it is an ethical issue... but it is still one of the most amazing cities in the world in terms of architecture and infrastructure.

InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,realjd,3,Tue Jul 14 00:05:13 2015 UTC,What's the ratio between diesel and electric passenger trains in the US? In Europe hearing a big ol' diesel roar is getting rarer every year. I understand that the US probably has less tracks electrified because the country's humongous.
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,him_again,11,Mon Jul 13 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"The Northeast Corridor, between Boston, New York, and Washington DC is virtually the only electric intercity passenger service in the US."
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,ottergoose,5,Mon Jul 13 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"There's also the Keystone line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  And a couple of NJ transit commuter routes which use electric locomotives too.  But yeah, the number of electric locomotive operated routes with catenary is very small. As others have said, there are some obscure coal hauling lines that directly connect power plants. There is at least one of these East Texas(multiple lignite strip mines-> big power plant) as well. But these are only marginally joined with the rest of the national network, if at all, and who knows how much longer they will exist if coal gradually becomes obsolete versus cheaper and more efficient natural gas.  Also, its really more of a novelty but there is a heritage/tourist electric railway in Iowa that sometimes moves commercial freight. And freight moves under commuter rail wires but pulled by diesel in Indiana I think.  San Antonio, Texas, used to have a inner city electric switching railway that moved freight on trolley tracks into the 1990s. I remember seeing it as a kid. Sadly all gone. El Paso also had the same thing at a copper smelter which is also vanished now.  There are two new EMU, not locomotive, electric urban rail line in Denver under construction also."
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,steavoh,3,Tue Jul 14 03:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yep. As far as I know, the only electric trains at all outside of northeast AMTRAK will be intracity like subways and other light-rail. Portland also has two light-rail systems - the MAX and the StreetCar."

Even most commuter service in Chicago (Metra), San Francisco Bay (Caltrain/ACE/Amtrak), Seattle (Sounder), for example, is diesel electric. There has been talk recently about converting Caltrain to electric, but it won't be in service for 5-10 years."
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,spacepenguine,2,Tue Jul 14 07:56:31 2015 UTC,Is this caused by lower oil price in the US? Or perhaps less draconian environmental regulations.
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,him_again,3,Tue Jul 14 08:14:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure.   I was under the impression many European electrified railways predate any kind of environmental regulations, though NYC in 1926 had an rule against steam locomotives operating in the city. I know Switzerland and Germany had a lot of the earliest ones, and I'd guess it might have something to do with hydroelectricity abundance making power cheap and the problems with steam engines in long tunnels.  May be totally wrong.  Also isn't electric traction good for trains that stop frequently and need quick acceleration? Seems fit for passenger service in densely populated urban corridors. And as a fixed piece of infrastructure you'd probably want to route as many trains under wire as possible to pay for it. All this sounds like the conditions found in Europe vs. the US where passenger trains are lacking and long distance freight on a spread out, decentralized network of numerous lightly used lines is the dominant thing."
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,steavoh,3,Tue Jul 14 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"Not totally sure but my understanding is it has to do mostly with the economics of keeping the infrastructure up. Most rail traffic in the US is long haul freight on very long, flat routes. In this case, I think a diesel infrastructure costs less. Even on commuter train routes I see freight trains all the time. In more industrial cities (like Pittsburgh), the lines are really busy, but there are only 2 passenger trains a day."
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,spacepenguine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:09:19 2015 UTC,"Complaining about the cost of railroad infrastructure is popular in the USA.  The complainers never give any thought to the cost of maintaining highways for cars, of course, because, well, cars.  The very same complainers complain about subsidizing the passenger rail operators but ignore the part about subsidizing the drivers of cars.  It's unAmerican to complain about cars.  Or something."
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,Fazookus,2,Wed Jul 15 19:52:45 2015 UTC,Railroads are not privately owned in the US?
InfrastructurePorn,3d5fpt,him_again,3,Wed Jul 15 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"Passenger railroad (AMTRAK and local commuter railroads, and I think some others) are subsidized to varying degrees and some passenger service runs on tracks owned by freight companies, which doesn't make for keeping to schedules...  It's... complicated.  Most of the private railroads have gone out of business over the years and been consolidated into a relative few remaining  companies.  The main Interstate Highway automobile routes were entirely constructed with Federal funds (based on the German Autoban) and most roads are owned by governments at some level, though there are some toll roads in private hands.  Taxes on fuel are another source of funds for the highway system.  The political dialogue generally speaks about subsidies to passenger rail as evil and subsidies to highways as not really happening."

The landmark structure has a total length of 3.502 miles (5.636 km). Its longest bridge spans 550 feet (168 m). Travelling between Newark and Jersey City, the roadway crosses the Passaic and Hackensack rivers and Kearny Point, the peninsula between them.  Unpredictable traffic congestion and its functionally obsolete design makes the Skyway one of the most unreliable roads in the United States.

InfrastructurePorn,3d1gdd,finkleface,5,Sun Jul 12 20:45:09 2015 UTC,Are concrete ties more sustainable? Maybe cheaper as well?
InfrastructurePorn,3d1gdd,Zernhelt,5,Sun Jul 12 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that they're cheaper and last longer, but wooden ties make for a smoother ride."
InfrastructurePorn,3d1gdd,x3nopon,3,Sun Jul 12 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"Actually concrete ties give the smoother ride.  However concrete ties require more maintenance because mud spots can cause ballast to get ground up underneath the tie, thereby creating more mud spots in cycle of worsening deterioration.  So if you don't have good mud spot maintenance concrete will be worse.  Concrete ties are also more difficult to work with when you need to replace just  a couple of ties for other maintenance operations."

InfrastructurePorn,3d1gdd,coahman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:51:14 2015 UTC,Would the gravel bed help compensate for the rigidity of the concrete ties?
InfrastructurePorn,3d1gdd,vanisaac,3,Mon Jul 13 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's really much to compensate for. Generally any deflection is going to increase fuel consumption (just think about a rail deflecting downward as having a slight uphill in front of every wheel that it has to climb out of - that's energy being lost. And with continuously welded rails becoming the industry standard for mainlines, I don't think there's really any significant performance difference between concrete and wooden sleepers, except that the track class (gauge tolerance) degrades faster with wood, so older track is less likely to be usable safely at higher speeds."

InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,digitalsciguy,3,Thu Jul 9 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Spain does urban tunneling for like $40mln/km. Double for higher wages, $80mln/km.   That's 300km of metro tunnels."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,DaWolf85,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:44:34 2015 UTC,"The reason the Big Dig became so costly was because everyone wanted a piece of the pie. The politicians all wanted to add their own pet projects, the businesses all wanted some of the money, and when you add some typical Boston corruption into the mix, you get some serious pork-barrel shit. They spent money on the most ridiculous, extraneous shit you can think of, and getting a good deal on any of the crap they bought was the last thing on their mind. The Big Dig is what happens when you essentially run a massive infrastructure project with an open checkbook and with zero accountability."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,digitalsciguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:57:35 2015 UTC,Or 24bn USD to fully electrify our commuter rail network and tie the two disconnected rail terminals to build a regional rail network to have never needed actually doing all the highway realignments and capacity replacement/expansion that everyone praises the Big Dig for having done?...
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,DylanTheDespot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:24:25 2015 UTC,It's also worth noting that a lot of the debt from the Big Dig was handed off to the MBTA for them to deal with. It's a large part of why that agency is having such trouble - it's spending $400 million a year on debt service instead of passenger service.
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,digitalsciguy,2,Thu Jul 9 06:31:04 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, yes, that's a very short answer to that.  If you can hold the attention of people after that statement, the detail is that the 'Big Dig debt' that was handed to the T was specifically for debts taken on by the state to build the transit mitigation components (Silver Line tunnel under Ft Point Channel, etc). It was a way for politicians to offload a very localised capital expense from the state budget, but the Big Dig as a road project still sits (relatively) comfortably as a 'regional' improvement.  The perception that transit improvements benefit locals only is chiefly the reason it's been so politically difficult to raise operating and capital funds for the T from municipalities in its catchment area. There's no unifying regional government between city and state levels to levy a specific tax on the T region for heavier investment, unlike in LA - you'd need to get buy-in from all the municipalities and even now, everyone's concerned about the T, but no one's really stepping up with funding solutions. And austerity for so long at the T has got them with such tunnel vision on simply operating the system that to outsiders it looks like corruption, which doesn't help with currying political capital in funding discussions."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,CantaloupeCamper,7,Thu Jul 9 13:30:31 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know of any instances where roads are placed on top of a suspended train's tracks? Seems like it'd be a smart use of space, allowing space below the train to be parks or local only roads."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,minidanjer,12,Wed Jul 8 12:46:31 2015 UTC,"I think there would be very few instances where this would be a practical solution for the sake of having park space or having double the road capacity. You already have the train providing trunk service along the corridor and probably have nearby roads that can act as arteries.  Elevated roadways in Japan would probably be highway and the costs would skyrocket and the additional space required for ramps up to the elevated roadway would make it even more impractical. All just to have parks under a double-stacked elevated structure, which probably wouldn't be that pleasant.  That said, I can't think of any real world examples where this has been done. If there were more dense places in Texas, this kind of overbuilt transport infrastructure would be totally up their alley - build transit then nullify its utility by doubling road capacity along the same route, just as they do today, but not stacked vertically."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,digitalsciguy,5,Wed Jul 8 13:15:23 2015 UTC,"I'll second that I'm also not aware of anyplace that's done it and I know it hasn't happened here in Japan.  And yes, it's not really very practical, due to the heights involved.  Here, it's also unnecessary, as the great majority of people in urban Japan don't own cars.  Most road traffic is business related in some way.  (It drops off very substantially after business hours.)  Your Texas example reminds me in a way of what Portland, Oregon did; spend billions on a light rail system, then build a bunch of large parking garages and charge drivers almost nothing to park in them."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,minidanjer,5,Wed Jul 8 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"Aside from a short distance to fix some problem (bridge, particularly nasty intersection or choke point) here or there, it seems like it would be redundant to add expensive elevated roadway where you already added another type of mass transit.....   presumably you added one to help the other.  Also I imagine an elevated roadway would take up a lot more space / shadow everything under it more than we see here."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,digitalsciguy,4,Wed Jul 8 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably better off using the space above the track as a pedestrian/park area. See the High Line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line_(New_York_City). Putting roads up on top of the track would be costly and I'm not sure how much benefit you'd get out of it given the reduction in access for traffic. It would function more like a highway than anything because building ramps to elevate vehicles takes up a lot of room. That said, ADA ramps to elevate folks who can't move up stairs also take up a lot of room.  Edit: the link was all wonky."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,BBnet3000,3,Wed Jul 8 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"ADA ramps to elevate folks who can't move up stairs also take up a lot of room   The High Line is wheelchair accessible by way of lifts to get you to/from street level. It's a beautiful space and I don't know why I didn't think of instead offering the concept of a linear elevated park as an alternate to the elevated roadway idea. These days it's a massive tourist trap, but a beautiful tourist trap nonetheless; in the evenings when the sun sets earlier in spring and autumn, the park gets to acceptable levels of people where it still feels like an active space but doesn't feel like a deserted park."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,bbqroast,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:40 2015 UTC,Lifts would be ideal in this situation and the fact that it's an active monorail line would mean that there should be power accessible throughout the length of it to tap into. I was thinking of the really long pedestrian bridges that go over roads and highways in Boston that have massively long ADA ramps in order to accommodate the height differential.
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,WarriorHealer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah. Japan has some really fair and nuanced taxation on cars that allows for more tax revenue to maintain infrastructure. Installing outdoor lifts would be overkill and likely significant increased operating expenses for DCR and MassDOT who maintain the majority of those ped bridges along Storrow Drive. Realistically, we should be walking back from the last century of car accommodations we've been making and really make the regional rail network actually usable so we can fully boulevardise Storrow Drive and do away entirely with having to build ped bridges just to get to the Charles River."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,Tanya3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the whole reason to build a monorail rather than an elevated subway is that its lighter, slimmer and cheaper. Making it a rather high elevated highway would most eliminate all of those advantages."
InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,WarriorHealer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"How would you get on/off the road way?  You'd require loads of space for big on ramps, none of which would be particularly useful (because the road would only have 1 or 2 lanes worth of capacity anyway)."

InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,edinn,4,Wed Jul 8 22:33:26 2015 UTC,I'm not an engineer but further up in this thread it's mentioned that suspended trains are significantly quieter than traditional rail trains which is why they're used in some residential applications.  Edit: added a word

InfrastructurePorn,3cjfu2,Cythrosi,2,Wed Jul 8 21:42:29 2015 UTC,"What advantage does this have over traditional elevated monorail, if there is nothing else like a road on top? Is there perhaps another non-suspended monorail on top? I can't see why this would be advantageous and it seems the infrastructure required to suspend the train would require quite a bit more engineering than simple wheels below the carriage, which we have been doing for much longer. I'd be interested to know more."

InfrastructurePorn,3bvxfe,AmericanGeezus,5,Fri Jul 3 02:43:22 2015 UTC,It's actually pretty informative and has a bunch of facts about the dam.  According to the counter only about 2800 people have ever looked at this site.  ...looks around nervously for a drone.
InfrastructurePorn,3bvxfe,someone21,2,Fri Jul 3 03:32:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its actually pretty informative little site. Especially accounting for what I imagine isn't much of a budget."
InfrastructurePorn,3bvxfe,AmericanGeezus,3,Fri Jul 3 04:27:48 2015 UTC,"So, that spillway you see below the dam serves a purpose.  The gates that let floodwater out of the dam are right in the middle, but quite near the top of the dam.  This means when those gates are open, that water is falling a long distance to the riverbed below.  This can severely erode the riverbed at the base of the dam, and you don't want that happening, as it can lead to structural weakness at the base of the dam.  So, when they open the gates to release water, it fills up that smaller reservoir below the dam, and that body of water serves to cushion the blow of the water pouring from the gates, and slow down erosion of the riverbed.    You don't see this on most dams, because most dams always have a decent amount of water flowing through them.  Being in the desert, this dam looks like during the dry seasons, the discharge is barely a trickle, and the bed below the damn is almost dry."

InfrastructurePorn,3b6wf4,DeityAmongMortals,5,Fri Jun 26 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to be absolutely mind-boggled, google the Embarcadero Freeway. Until about 20 years ago there was a double decker freeway where the ground-level street is now.  It was awful."
InfrastructurePorn,3b6wf4,thedurka,4,Fri Jun 26 19:11:24 2015 UTC,To illustrate: the freeway during demolition. If not for the earthquake in 1989 it would probably still be there.
InfrastructurePorn,3b6wf4,savetheclocktower,5,Fri Jun 26 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"The Embarcadero Freeway was of the same reinforced concrete construction as the Cypress Structure in Oakland.  One of the main problems with this type of construction was a lack of horizontal reinforcement within the concrete columns, so the columns essentially just buckled, with the rebar bowing outward, when subjected to the forces of the earthquake.  Location and type of fill were also factors, I believe, not only with the Cypress Structure but also later when much of the analysis was in and assessed with regards to the Embarcadero structure.  It was the collapse of the Cypress Structure that killed the majority of those who died in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake.  One of the main things I remember after the quake was the flag pole atop the Ferry Building jutting out at a precarious angle.  I was working when the quake hit--hanging a massive scenic drop for a telecommunications convention party while straddling a 16' rolling A-frame ladder, which I rode to the ground inside the Union Square Hilton Grand Ball Room.  Pieces of glass chandeliers were pelting everything and everybody.  As I was on one of the lower floors of a 44-story building, I made my way under a banquet table, with Pablo the bus boy, where we both waited for the building to pancake down upon us.  I positioned myself just under the edge of the table on my back so that I could look up to see when my death would come and then it stopped.  Such fun times!  (On a side note, I believe that the Seattle's Alaskan Way Viaduct, which they're attempting to replace with a tunnel, is of the same construction as the Cypress Structure and the Embarcadero Freeway.  At least they all date from the same era of construction.  That project is currently massively behind schedule and over-budget with Bertha, the world's largest tunnel borer, currently stuck just 1000' into a two mile long tunnel,   Yet another fascinating topic for /r/InfrastructurePorn.)"
InfrastructurePorn,3b6wf4,skjellyfetti,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:49:21 2015 UTC,I'm sure it was awful. It's also awful not having a freeway through San Francisco.
InfrastructurePorn,3b6wf4,baddox,6,Fri Jun 26 21:34:52 2015 UTC,"Not if you live there.    The Embarcadero area was a scary, crime-ridden mess for as long as that freeway stood.  The removal of it and eventual extension of the N Judah has so incredibly revitalized the area.  The waterfront has become a significant destination.    (tho, for what it's worth, I'm completely in favor of something to better connect the Golden Gate Bridge to, eg, 280, maybe a tunnel under 19th Avenue)"
InfrastructurePorn,3b6wf4,combuchan,3,Fri Jun 26 23:59:31 2015 UTC,"They demolished it for a VERY good reason - because of the incredible danger not just freeway bridges, but anything built on tall supports poses in an intense earthquake. When there's an earthquake, any water saturated ground like the filled in land that used to be shallow water this area of San Francisco is built on literally gets turned to quicksand as the seismic waves travel through it. This is a process called Liquefaction.   Very few people understand how bad this is, so I'll try my hand at explaining it. This happens because the seismic waves travel through this type of ground slower, so the waves have to increase in amplitude (effective intensity) to conserve the same amount of energy. The effect of this is to magnify several times the horizontal acceleration exerted on structures, AND make them sink at the same time. It can take the horizontal force of a very strong earthquake from 11 - 21 ft/s (strong shaking) to 22 - 52ft/s (violent to extreme shaking). For a bit of perspective, a car doing 0 to 60 in 4 seconds is just 22 ft/s acceleration, and the acceleration of gravity is 32.15 ft/s. As a counter to this, structures with a foundation on solid bedrock experience less shaking, because the waves travel faster through the continuous rock.  These are very achievable acceleration values for earthquakes. The February 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake had a peak ground acceleration of 70.7 ft/s.  Disclaimer: the wavelength of a seismic wave is not a full second long at the speeds they travel, so you're not going to actually be moving a horizontal distance of 52 feet and back again. It's just a measure of how strong the force on buildings is. It's also not the only thing that damages earthquakes (resonance, for example, is another big thing) but it's the biggest one that can be described so simply.  Shaking of that kind of intensity means the difference between strong shaking that causes moderate damage and extreme shaking that can do things like this. (Disclaimer: that happening to rail lines is actually caused by a difference in acceleration on different parts of the track because of different materials underlying the railbed, causing extreme compressional forces on the line, not just by high peak acceleration).  These double deck freeways are particularly vulnerable, because the two road decks are very heavy indeed and in an earthquake accelerate at slightly different rates (anything further off the ground will), putting immense forces on the vertical supports. The vertical supports simply cannot handle this - not by an order of magnitude - and will fail. The Embarcadero Freeway structure not failing in 1989 is nothing short of a miracle.   The upside of all of this? Increasing knowledge of how earthquakes and the resulting seismic waves work, combined with engineers learning from the past (what fails and what doesn't and why?) building structures with steel and concrete that are stronger and lighter than ever means more modern structures just might have a chance."

About the only thing left that you can see in that area is some of the old railroad grade. Some of the roads re-used the grade.

Oh, and if you like to toke like I do, theres an awesome coffeeshop houseboat called the Culture Boat. Nothing like walking out stoned out of your mind then taking pictures all night!"

InfrastructurePorn,3b4nf9,MeEvilBob,2,Thu Jun 25 22:55:23 2015 UTC,"Part of the Stony Brook Railroad in Westford Massachusetts USA. Built in the 1848, double tracked until 1957, passenger service ended in 1961 and the line is now part of the Pan Am Railways freight main line from Mattawaumkeag Maine to Mohawk New York.  The passing siding in the distance is on the alignment of the original second track and a center siding half the length of the modern siding began here.  Also note the 3 light stop signal on the right, this is an active signal, I took the photo just after a train had passed."

InfrastructurePorn,3ay6pr,stevekeiretsu,11,Wed Jun 24 13:23:01 2015 UTC,"Wow... that must be an incredibly busy spot to justify the cost of a flyover vs an x-crossing.  Although judging from your picture, it seems that having two trains crossing at the same time must be pretty common!"
InfrastructurePorn,3ay6pr,KosherNazi,20,Wed Jun 24 14:52:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is leading to Clapham Junction, the UK's busiest railway station (amount of trains, not passengers).  The flyover line is taking the up slow over the up and down fast, so when it reaches it's terminus (Waterloo) the slows and the fasts are separated. This results in less conflicting movements across the station throat. You can see similar arrangements approaching London Euston, Kings Cross, St Pancras and Liverpool Street.  The reason the arrangement isn't the same all the way down the line is to keep the slows to the side and the fasts in the middle of the 4-track route."
InfrastructurePorn,3ay6pr,laryk,7,Wed Jun 24 15:10:27 2015 UTC,"When I took the photo I googled around exactly what the track layout was and, thus, what the point of building it was.  It took me absolutely ages to figure out, but I think you explained it better than the text I found!  I grasped the switch between separated by direction and separate by type, but I couldn't get why not doing this resulted in such problems at the station throat.  The one bit which made it fall into place for me was the (should-have-been-obvious) realisation that an up train turns into a down train at the terminus."
InfrastructurePorn,3ay6pr,Dannei,2,Wed Jun 24 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"For St Pancras, are you talking about the flyover at Hendon? If so, that's more aimed at getting freight trains across, rather than swapping passenger services around - I'm not sure if it's signalled to passenger standards."
InfrastructurePorn,3ay6pr,laryk,2,Wed Jun 24 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the one. I hadn't realised that was it's purpose - makes sense now as the freight lines have no platforms! Thanks :)"

InfrastructurePorn,3apag7,EpikYummeh,2,Mon Jun 22 17:09:30 2015 UTC,The way they snake when they move from one beam to the next strikes me as almost eerie in the way they give the impression of a living thing.
InfrastructurePorn,3apag7,meekstadt,9,Mon Jun 22 17:56:38 2015 UTC,What is the advantage of monorail over traditional rail?
InfrastructurePorn,3apag7,stebbiv,12,Mon Jun 22 14:23:24 2015 UTC,"For one, elevated infrastructure is less expensive to build and maintain."
InfrastructurePorn,3apag7,wadamday,20,Mon Jun 22 14:33:30 2015 UTC,"Well suited to compact Tokyo, the beam has a smaller footprint than traditional rail, so routes can be installed where there wouldn't be room for rails. That often places the trains in very close proximity to homes/apartment buildings, offices, ect., which leads to another of their major advantages: they're quiet; creating just a small fraction of the noise produced by traditional rail."

InfrastructurePorn,3apag7,scoutgeek,3,Mon Jun 22 18:10:36 2015 UTC,What is that green structure on the third track? A rail cleaner of some sort?
InfrastructurePorn,3apag7,darconiandevil,10,Mon Jun 22 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"In a way. It's an enclosure that protects maintenance workers from the elements. It's pushed or pulled to where it's needed on the line by a what's known as a monorail tractor, which also transports the workers.  Adding that the tractors run on diesel, so they can operate even when the beam's electrical system is powered down."

Not just that the whole city could be better planned by a bunch of five year olds with a sheet of paper and crayons. I guess the rapidly incresing population ( circa 3m in 2001 to 9m in 2011) due to the IT boom has really streatched the infrastructure thin.  Delhi metro on the other hand is awesome!

I think it's about 50-60 feet.   It's also a barrier for invasive species, though that was not intended when it was built.   The way it stays level is rather clever. There are separate rails for the front and the end of the carriage. The rails are identical, but the rails for either end are shifted by the same length as the carriage. So even though the rails are sloped, and no matter how they slope, the carriage wheels remain at the same elevation and the whole thing is level."

InfrastructurePorn,3a2cit,TheHmed,3,Wed Jun 17 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its huge. But it is right off of our major expressway so the length of it is mainly to move the traffic from the offramps, to the circle.   That Five Ways Roundabout is absurd btw! Is that two levels of streets with a pedestrian ramp in the middle of it all? That must get fun at rush hour!"
InfrastructurePorn,3a2cit,kvachon,2,Wed Jun 17 07:05:12 2015 UTC,Oh that makes a lot more sense now.    And yes it is! It has a separate A Road going underneath straight into the heart of town. It's generally not too bad to drive except on the indented part of the roundabout where you'll just be able to make out  pedestrian crossing.  Massive hazard because as you're approaching it you don't see them   Edit: funnily enough it doesn't get choked really. Flows quite well even though it's needed for a lot of destinations. Top to bottom is into and away from centre of town.  Left to bottom right is residential to motorway.  Left to top right is shopping

InfrastructurePorn,39o52f,TurboBox,3,Sat Jun 13 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"What does that mean, and how would they do that?"
InfrastructurePorn,39o52f,apache2158,7,Sun Jun 14 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"Well... (keep in mind I'm translating from Spanish to English here, and I'm only a civil engineering student! If anyone else reading this wants to chime in and /or correct me, please do haha)  In structural engineering, in simple terms, one type of stress that structures (and the elements that compose them) can be subjected to is tension. That is, a stress that tends to separate the infinite transversal parallel sections that compose the element in a way that they keep parallel to one another. They ""move"" along an axis that crosses them perpendicularly. A piece of rope that two people pull from each end away from one another is in tension, and the axis I mentioned would pass right through the middle of the rope, in the ""long"" direction of it.  The material best suited for this type of stress is steel, which has great capacity for enduring tensional stress.  However, you can also use reinforced concrete. This is a concrete element with steel bars inside of it, both materials "" "" glued "" "" together so as to work as much as possible as a continuous, uniform material.  There's a but, though. Even though the steel bars inside said concrete give the whole structural element the ability to withstand considerable tensional stress (since concrete alone has a pathetic ability to resist tension concrete in elements for tensional stress is always used in the form of reinforced concrete), the concrete part of the reinforced-concrete element will always suffer fissures. Cracks. These are -in simplified terms- little parts of the concrete volume where tension was too much for the concrete particles to stay joined and thus they separated. The concrete broke there.  There are different types of cracks but in the end, what they provoke is a decrease in the element's ability to resist tensional stress. That is, after the crack has formed, the element responds to the same increment in tension as before, with a bigger deformation than before. It is less rigid. It's more like bubblegum than before, its blander. It's like applying the same force to a piece of cheese, after and before heating it up in the microwave oven.   So, if you want the element to function with X rigidity (or resistance to deformation when tension is applied) , but you know that because of the inevitable fissures, you will lose some of that rigidity, you'll have to construct said element with X + x rigidty, so when you loose x of that to cracks, you'll still have enough for your element and your structure to work how you want it, right? Yeah.  You do that through making the section of the element taller and/or wider, if it's rectangular. That makes it more rigid. However, that means the element is heavier, which means more stress on the structure as a whole, and if the element is pre-casted (instead of casted in-place), it can't be too big or you'll have trouble getting it to the construction site, etc.  That's when (Finally!) pre-stressing comes in. You see, the cracks I mentioned can be analyzed, without too much error, like this: the concrete in reinforced concrete will resist tensional stress without getting fissures, that is without breaking, if the tensional stress applied is less than a certain threshold value we'll call Sf. If we surpass that level of tension, we'll get fissures in the concrete, our element will loose rigidity while in service, and we'll have to have made it with an extra or we'll have less rigidity in the structure than what we need. If the stress is less than that, the concrete will not fissure considerably and we can fabricate a smaller-section element, which is great. So, how do we stay under that threshold?  You could say: ah! I'll just make a section so big that the forces the structure has to endure will be distributed over so big an area that the resulting stress will be less than Sf! Well, that's great but it has the problem I mentioned with too much weight, construction difficulties, etc. PLUS, and this is a really really big deal, that section isn't concrete alone, it also includes the smaller sections of the steel bars. Steel is a whole lot more resistant to tensional stress than concrete (like aprox. 200 times more), and a whole lot more expensive too. If you make it so the overall stress over the section is so small that poor little concrete won't ever break, that will mean you're under-using your steel outrageously.  INSTEAD, what we'll do is pre-deform the element in the direction opposite of what the service loads will deform it in. For example, in a support beam like the one showed here, the service loads will tend to tense/elongate the beam. Since at first the element has zero deformation, that means all the load will ""go"" towards elongating it and the resulting stress will be tension. HOWEVER, if we deform it in the opposite direction, by compressing it beforehand and thus ""shortening"" it, that means that the same loads will ""have to"" nullify said compression/shortening before they produce tension/elongation. In the first case, all the magnitude of service load ""V"" distributed over element section Y produced tension, and since the concrete is so lame in tension, it will surely have cracked it, with all the bad consequences that has for us structure designers. In the second case, however, part of said load distributed over section Y first has to nullify the pre-compression stress the element has, before it can start elongating it/tensing it. Instead of tensing the element, that fraction of the load is decompressing it. The result is that only the rest of the load (a smaller part of the whole load) is applied to produce tension. Thus the resulting tension is smaller. We can calculate and balance the equations and precompress the thing enough such that the final tension isn't enough to crack the concrete (and often such that it will never stop being compressed), and so we can use smaller section elements, with all the advantages that brings!  tl;dr: prestressing (in this case precompressing) means deforming an structural element in the opposite way it will deform when the structure is in service. That way, the element (and the structure composed of the elementS) will not suffer the ""complete"" deformations of the service loads. Instead, part of those deformations will ""cancel out"" (in broad terms) with the pre-deformations we gave the element, and only a fraction will actually produce deformations in the ""direction"" of the service loads. This means we can make smaller, lighter, easier to make, cheaper structural elements. Sometimes, using this construction technique is the only way to use certain materials (like concrete and reinforced concrete) in certain applications, like tension-resisting elements. Otherwise, they can't endure the necessary stresses.  SECOND QUESTION  There are several ways to pre-stress, for different kinds of structural elements, and I only know a couple of them. It'd be best if you searched around the net. The only keyword I can give you in English is prestressed concrete. GOod luck!  Haha, that was fun : ). How did I do? Confused as hell?"

InfrastructurePorn,39b61k,diesel_stinks_,9,Wed Jun 10 21:25:14 2015 UTC,The amount of resources and energy needed to produce a solar panel is tiny compared to using fossil fuels for energy.

InfrastructurePorn,39b61k,Col_mac,2,Wed Jun 10 21:34:15 2015 UTC,"I was referring mostly to the industrial incursion on the landscape. This is no longer habitat or at the very least it has been degraded significantly. Yes oil and gas has to clear away some dirt to make a pad but It doesn't use acres and acres of wilderness to get that pad. Oil sands is an obvious exception to this. And spills and global warming aside, the actual foot print involved in getting conventional oil and gas out of the ground compares to greenfield solar projects like this. Throw them on roofs and parking lots to actually call them green. Do not call this industrial incursion a totally guilt free source of energy.   This doesn't include all the mining of rare earths that is required to make solar panels. But that's another story."
InfrastructurePorn,39b61k,diesel_stinks_,3,Thu Jun 11 01:05:33 2015 UTC,This was farmland before it was a solar farm. It's likely that it was farmland that had become unproductive.    Yes oil and gas has to clear away some dirt to make a pad but It doesn't use acres and acres of wilderness to get that pad.   Those pads add up to huge areas.   Roofs are definitely a much better place for solar panels.  The mining of materials for solar panels isn't remotely as damaging or widespread and the mining for coal.
InfrastructurePorn,39b61k,Col_mac,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"Woah pal, was I talking about coal? Let's not bring coal into this. Do you know what heap leach mining is? If not a TL;DR is they pour acid on the ground and they get what comes out the other side with some of the gold, platinum, Mercury that accompanies these metals. They then let this waste hang out in a tailings pond which makes any oil sands tailings pond look like a delightful kiddie pool.   Also you're saying farmland isn't worth reclaiming for, you know, food?   I used to think like you did (alternative = good; fossil fuels = bad) but the world is not as black and white as that. I do believe that shifting towards renewable energy is a responsible step that we need to take. However, not taking measured steps in how we do it will result in negative cumulative effects on the landscape. Yes this use to be an ecosystem, yes it used to be a farm, to when it reaches the end of the lifecycle the solar farm. Then what? Keep your farmable areas intact for as long as you can. You can farm right up to an old well head which has a diameter of 2'. Unless their farming ginseng under this solar canopy keep it off my farmland."

Who knew?   and we're a long way to go before that isnt the case.    We're not likely to ever have an energy source that doesn't have some kind of negative impact.   beyond simply shifting from one form of mass power to another   The goal is to shift from energy sources that have a high impact to energy sources that have less of an impact."

They used 36 acres of land to make 100mw.  A solar boiler could have thrown out 5 times that much, and it would have continued producing electricity after dusk. There were a dozen more efficient ways to build that solar park.  Oil and Gas is super destructive, as coal once was. Scrubber tech has made clean coal a reality for the last ten years. It isn't the tech firms' fault that EPA regulations don't make the tech mandatory.  I was an I&C Engineer at such a firm for ten years.  It sucks seeing the technology exist but only a few big hitters buy it (Alcoa et cetera).  After the tech was finalized we starting pumping out solar boilers with molten salt tanks.  That is some very efficient technology.  The first few were terrible.  3,000 acres for 400MW, it was shameful.  But that was years ago. Modern designs crush this pathetic photovoltaic park in every area."

That's what I thought too until they sent me to the station to draft the As-Builts.  I could go over how it's done if you like, I figure on this subreddit it's worth sharing.  What amazed me was how the carbon dioxide was handled, every other pollutant has pre-existing Zero Percent Emissions tech.  BPEI had developed signature ductwork which induced precipitation of CO2 via a series of diabatic & adiabatic compression and expansion.  They performed this with ductwork and delta wing mixers. The pressure & temperature drop caused the CO2 to phase change inside the flue gas path. Eventually they settled on a saturation which enabled the stuff to be tapped & poured. Liquid phases for flue gas separating & gas purification was done using binary ionic liquid mixtures containing cyano-functionalized anions. The delta wing mixers saturate the flue gas with the supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs), which changed the gas transport properties of the flue gas.  The CO2 precipitated like rain in the ductwork.  From there it's a question of tapping.  The Nocks and Socks (ha ha, other pollutants) were served with SCR & Turbosorp technology.  The only variable obstacle to clean coal was CO2, and the only other company with competing CO2 scrubber tech is General Electric, and their process involves wet scrubbing and is extremely expensive and cost prohibitive.  But ... just because you haven't seen it or aren't part of the industry doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  These technologies are part of the private sector, so it doesn't surprise me that the public sector can claim it doesn't exist.  That's hard for me to do when I'm stood in front of it & worked on it for months though ;) The thing is the demand for Zero Emissions Technology is also zero.  Unless regulations mandated that the CO2 be scrubbed away, then we won't sell CO2 scrubbing tech to many places.  Not that it would matter, because it's all inter-private sector trading & infrastructure."

InfrastructurePorn,38z1h6,arbili,10,Mon Jun 8 01:22:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this photo. It may sound weird, but it brings back a lot of good memories.  For three weeks in the fall of '08, I stayed at a small school in Rambouillet (west of Paris, about halfway between Paris and Chartes). Class would let out around 4 and I would often walk as fast as I could to catch the fast train to Montparnasse. I walked those platforms often.  I once missed the penultimate fast train to Rambouillet. I had two hours to kill, so I found wifi and used it to call friends back home for free (thank you, T-Mobile). I learned an ex was pregnant, all sorts of emotional stuff. All while I paced back and forth with my bags of dictionaries from the used selection at Gibert Jeune just off the Seine.  I saw a lot of France by train. I took a TGV from Mount Parnassos (the literal translation, as in Apollo's favorite hangout) to Rennes. I rented a car to drive to Mont St-Michel then to Lannion for a fest-nozh (the Breton harvest fest, where they have elaborate dances with pinkies interlinked). Later I went to Lyon, then Marseilles, then Montpellier (an amazing medieval city) and eventally way up to Lille.  I remember giving the conductor 105 euros in cash on the train from Montpellier to Lille (5.5 hours, 1000 km). I didn't even get a seat -- I just xamped on the floor of the resto-bar with a bunch of other folks until we got to Lyon. The Spanish girl I was dating told me the line to purchase a ticketwould be an hour but the train would be leaving in half an hour. Thus I ran up to the ATM, got the cash, and kissed her goodbye.  Lille was beautiful and worth the trip. However I probably should've taken the money and got a better hotel room with the girl. Lille in the freezing rain without a room is a nightmare. Lille however does have the classiest all-night steak and fry house, so I ate well as I pondered my ill decision.  Actually, Lille was worth it. That last full day in Europe was better spent traipsing around Lille and eating interesting food than it would've been at a hotel near CDG. Besides, it was one stop from Lille Europe to CDG and it took less time than getting from CDG into Paris."

InfrastructurePorn,38vc42,whiznat,2,Mon Jun 8 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"The ""sawtooth pattern"" you're seeing is the clips that secure the rails to the sleepers. You can see them on the left tracks too, albeit harder to see because they're in shadow.  If you follow the left-hand tracks back behind the railcar, you'll see that the rail nearest the platform almost disappears behind the edge of the platform as you move further away from the camera.  The same is happening on the right-hand tracks too, but to a greater degree because the camera is further over from that side of the platform.  It's just perspective:  http://i.imgur.com/SJBxhLy.png  (Where the camera is at the black star, the areas shaded in green cannot be seen because the edge of the platform obscures them.  That includes the nearside rail on the right hand tracks, even though the platform is only very slightly higher than the rails, mostly because the camera is so low to the ground)."

InfrastructurePorn,38nrbn,KingDaveRa,3,Fri Jun 5 14:56:22 2015 UTC,You'd think they'd just build a mechanism inside the housing to wind the copper once it gets up there.  Do they have to assemble a crane then to hoist that thing into position?

InfrastructurePorn,37vvjk,Scary_,2,Sun May 31 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"That was the initial arrangement (one at a time).  Now what they've agreed is to demolish and restore 1, then the other 3 at once.

InfrastructurePorn,37vvjk,Scary_,0,Sun May 31 16:56:23 2015 UTC,This is the point. The chimneys are replicas so it is easier to convince authorities to remove the listing.

InfrastructurePorn,37vvjk,Timothy_Claypole,1 point,Sun May 31 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"They don't take up that much space as they're on top of the building, any maximising of space means leveling the whole thing.

But without the real chimneys, the really important things as you note, it is easier to persuade someone that yeah, that building is not what it once was. This was always the fear. The amount they could make from hauling it down and putting something else up is going to be obscene. It is prime real estate in one of the word's most expensive cities.  I realise this may seem cynical but developers really do think this way sometimes."
InfrastructurePorn,37vvjk,Timothy_Claypole,1 point,Sun May 31 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"But if they've spent hundreds of millions redeveloping the power station and filling it with offices, shops and flats, rebuilding the chimneys, building more new flats all around the power station... would they really make a profit from buying out all their tennants and starting all over again? Breaking even from the current development will take years.  It's prime real estate, but it's even more valuable with the famous building in the middle of it!"
InfrastructurePorn,37vvjk,seantorious,0,Sun May 31 20:57:10 2015 UTC,"It's less valuable when you consider how much further redevelopment they could do. They're playing the long game here, this isn't something that will happen in any sudden way or without significant extraction of value."

InfrastructurePorn,37mywk,terd_fergesen,8,Fri May 29 03:31:44 2015 UTC,"I live near this bridge and did a seniot design project regarding the small island running beneath it!   Anonymisity, the suspended span goes over the federal shippinh channel of the St Johns River, so it requires great vertical clearances to allow container ship passage beneath so they can pass from the ocean (a few miles East of the pic) to shipping terminals West of the bridge. The unsuspended portion travels over Mill Cove which has a small pleasurecraft channel, but does not allow shipping vessels.   Rhydderch, the power plant behind is a rather run-of-the-mill plant for the Jacksonville Electric Authority. This whole area around Dames Point (the Northern landing point of the bridge) is very industrialized.   A few things to note:   -The bridge carries I-295 (formerly FL SR 9A) across Mill Cove, Bartram Island, and the St Johns River on the upper east side of Jacksonville, FL.  -Most property surrounding the North landing site of the bridge is owned by the Jacksonville port authority. The Blount Island Terminal is the big developed island just to the right of the bridge, Bartram Island is a dredge spoil site directly beneath the bridge, and the area beneath the North landing is Dames Point itself.   If I get around to it later, I'll upload some pictures from beneath the bridge if anybody is interested!"

But hardly any of them have spillways without a chute, training walls, and a stilling basin at the bottom."

InfrastructurePorn,37c4sr,Skudworth,1 point,Wed May 27 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"Another major, and more important, water source for the Briones Reservoir is imports from the Briones Diversion Works near Orinda through the Briones Aqueduct. This Aqueduct is a 7-foot, 6-inch steel pipe, operated by four pumps that can deliver up to 60 million gallons a day.[4] This is water that originates from EDMUD’s biggest water source: the Mokelumne River.    Read a Wiki article if you think that's where your water comes from. 9 square miles of watershed isn't going to deliver squat in terms of local supply. 28 inches per year, average 50% runoff, on 5700 acres = 13,000 acre-feet per year, into a dam that services half of EBMUD's 1.8 million residents.   EBMUD's water supply include 364,000 acre-feet of imported water against 30,000 acre-feet local - 7% local supply. (Compare San Diego, where 17% of our water is from local supplies, with a goal of 50% by 2035)  So...you best be taking those navy showers for the sake of your own water supply, not ours."

InfrastructurePorn,37c4sr,PetalJiggy,8,Tue May 26 21:13:22 2015 UTC,"One is the California acqueduct, which goes from near Stockton to Los Angeles. The other is the Delta-Mendota canal, which starts in the same spot but ends near Fresno and serves as a replacement for the San Joaquin river (the central valley gets much of its farm water from this canal)."
InfrastructurePorn,37c4sr,humjaba,5,Wed May 27 01:08:56 2015 UTC,"It's curvy to dissipate excess energy from the water. As I understand it, the aqueduct is pumped up and over mountains. On the way back down, it would gain significant velocity if simply allowed to accelerate."
InfrastructurePorn,37c4sr,inqrorken,13,Tue May 26 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"Did I stumble into /r/ShittyInfrastructure?   Tracy, CA, where these canals run, is where the water is pumped from the California Delta. The canals follow the curvature of the land to minimize fill/cuts necessary to keep the aqueduct essentially level.   This is hundreds of miles away from ""on the way back down"" from the mountains over which the aqueducts are pumped (and on the wrong side of those mountains).   Where the water does come down the mountain, it runs through turbines that recapture the potential energy as electricity, offsetting the power needed to pump the water in the first place.   Also, as to this image in particular: we're seeing a photo taken with a powerful zoom at a low angle, which has the effect of compressing distance, making the canals appear more serpentine than they are. This may be more obvious by looking at a google maps view of the area."

What gives you a claim on any of this water? You think because you've lived a few years in weedville that the water belongs to you?
InfrastructurePorn,37c4sr,no-fun-at-parties,2,Tue May 26 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"Well, given that when they built the dam (that blocks all the water flowing to our county) a contract was formed between agencies running the water project and local governments guaranteeing us a certain outflow every year, and the water project proceeded to give us only a fraction of the agreed amount, leading to dry rivers and mass fish die-offs permanently disrupting and destroying valuable and protected ecosystems, and only relented and gave us our water after we sued them in federal court and a judge clearly stated the contract had been knowingly violated for multiple years... Yeah, I think that counts as stealing.

All natural resources generally should be managed to the mutual benefit of everyone, and I feel like the current management regime is balancing needs very well.

Traveled heavily around the country (Chengdu, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou... and countless other mega cities).  Every time I was taking a cab from city center to the airport I was trying to count the crane only from one side of the cab (ie almost always on the right side of the road). Most of the time it was more than 150 cranes.   And almost every time I was lost in my count. Impossible to have a good figure, sometimes you can see cranes as far as the eyes can see. It's crazy impressive."
InfrastructurePorn,36y4ng,boucledor,2,Sat May 23 16:01:00 2015 UTC,And the big question is whether those cranes are erecting anything worth value or of future use.  Did you get any sense on the upward mobility of workers and the need for their scale of construction?

InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,xavierfox42,6,Mon May 18 19:38:15 2015 UTC,Certainly looks nice. The only issue I can see is you can't do U-turns on it.
InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,Nomad45,9,Mon May 18 06:02:44 2015 UTC,"You can't do U-turns in a stack either, and this is just a stack alternative (more land needed; less bridge required over the carraigeways; lower speed limits on the flyover ramps).  This kind of interchange is ideally only used at freeway/freeway or freeway/expressway interchanges anyway, where if you miss your turn, it's easier to just drive to the next exit and turn around there."
InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,LordoftheSynth,7,Mon May 18 08:15:49 2015 UTC,Why would anyone ever want to do a U-turn on a motorway?
InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,Sir_Chrysa,5,Mon May 18 07:14:52 2015 UTC,If you make a wrong turn I guess. You can do a 180 with a cloverleaf. I meant that in Cities Skylines having that 180 option is nice.
InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,Nomad45,7,Mon May 18 07:21:55 2015 UTC,"There's a reason cloverleafs aren't done any more. They are inefficient and accident prone (a traditional cloverleaf has one on-ramp share a lane with an off-ramp, which can lead to merging problems.)"
InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,apawst8,5,Mon May 18 13:59:12 2015 UTC,Can? More like does. Chuck clover leafs and their suicide ramps.
InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,SycoJack,9,Mon May 18 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"No way.   Each ramp is a multi-million dollar project.   If you want to make a U-turn, you've got to get off the highway and enter again in the opposite direction"

InfrastructurePorn,36bgtu,zipperseven,3,Mon May 18 04:58:14 2015 UTC,If I'm right this is JTB at 9A (295 now). You can't really see much because the ramps don't stack more than one layer deep so they don't have much elevation. Plus there's pretty substantial embankments on either side of JTB that block the views of most of the ramps.

Fun fact: The Sydney Habour Bridge originally didn't have the pylons but the public didn't feel the bridge looked stable so they added the pylons (that do nothing) and allayed everybody's concerns -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge#Pylons  Trivia: Sydneysiders often refer to the Sydney Harbour Bridge as 'the Coathanger'.

Hôtel de Ville - Cuire; 2.4 km, 5 stations  On 6 Dec 1974, the former funicular, opened in 1891, was converted into a rack railway between Croix-Paquet and Croix-Rousse, which then became part of the new metro system in 1978 after its extension to Hôtel de Ville (Hôtel de Ville and Croix-Rousse - 936 m). In 1984 it was extended to Cuire, now on a level alignment without the centre rack rail, but single-track and above ground from just after Hénon and the terminus at Cuire. This extension took advantage of the abandoned railway corridor of the line to Sathonay, closed in 1975.  Line C probably includes the world's steepest metro station: Croix-Paquet (a gradient of 17%). This line is operated with 2-car trains.  02 May 1978: Hôtel de Ville - Croix-Rousse 10 Dec 1984: Croix-Rousse - Cuire   http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/fr/lyon/lyon.htm"

InfrastructurePorn,364azo,Betrivent,3,Sat May 16 02:32:01 2015 UTC,"There's an interesting story about this bridge. The Guinness family purchased a bunch of land in West Van in the 1930's, then paid for the construction of the bridge. Property values skyrocketed with the improved access to the area. Toll booths were installed to recover costs of the bridge construction, and were eventually removed in the 1960's when the bridge was sold to the provincial government."
InfrastructurePorn,364azo,snowtroopin,1 point,Sat May 16 18:11:42 2015 UTC,sold to the provincial government for the same amount it had cost to build the bridge originally.  $3million if I remember my tour guiding info correctly.

InfrastructurePorn,35s1fw,slotard,5,Wed May 13 05:06:22 2015 UTC,"Lift bridges aren't really uncommon though. Yes, they impose a height limit, but realistically the depth of the water imposes a size limit as well - and while it can be dredged, it sure isn't cheap.   I suppose they probably have counterweights of some sort hidden in the towers. Essentially all lift bridges use some sort of counterweight. It wouldn't surprise me if it was unable to lift with a full traffic load on it, even a single truck might be a problem."
InfrastructurePorn,35s1fw,matteisen0,1 point,Wed May 13 13:48:52 2015 UTC,There are most certainly counterweights hidden in the towers. This bridge does an amazing job or making the towers sleek and clean - at least compared to other lift bridges. I would think one of the challenges is to insure all four corners of the lift are synchronized in order to prevent jams.
InfrastructurePorn,35s1fw,bobtehhobo,5,Wed May 13 14:23:18 2015 UTC,Those designs seem super impractical   In what way are they less practical than traditional drawbridges?
InfrastructurePorn,35s1fw,matteisen0,2,Wed May 13 08:54:07 2015 UTC,They impose a height limit on passing ships that you don't have with traditional drawbridges.
InfrastructurePorn,35s1fw,Narissis,1 point,Wed May 13 12:55:07 2015 UTC,"Does that really fall under ""super impractical"" though? It seems like a limitation, but maybe the result of a cost/benefit analysis? (construction/maintenance)  If they only receive a certain size of ships it's something their planning office would have taken into account."

InfrastructurePorn,35m6wu,SirSid,16,Mon May 11 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"From the Wikipedia article: ""Helping to control floods, the dam has two spillways, 5 gates near the crest and a tunnel on the left bank. The gates can discharge up to 5,130 m3/s (181,164 cu ft/s) while the tunnel has a maximum discharge of 4,884 m3/s (172,477 cu ft/s). In the middle portion of the dam, there are six orifice openings that can discharge 6,500 m3/s (229,545 cu ft/s). In addition, the dam can release additional water and sediment with two bottom outlets. All of the dam's outlets including the power station give it a maximum flood discharge of 20,709 m3/s (731,331 cu ft/s)"""

InfrastructurePorn,35m6wu,SirSid,7,Tue May 12 02:22:02 2015 UTC,It's a ski-jump in the spillway. If I recall correctly they're used to slow down the water and reduce erosion around the dam.
InfrastructurePorn,35m6wu,D_E_Laowai,3,Tue May 12 02:39:16 2015 UTC,I'm assuming it's to reduce scouring.  A lot of sediment at the dam base would be carried away by the outflow.

One of my worst rowing episodes was from an extended row from Putney, through this lock, and further up, in high summer. I had a tiny bottle of water, and we ended up trapped this side of the lock and weir because we missed the tide turning.   Had to squeeze our tiny pairs into the lock, which started banging into the walls because it's so confined, and then row all the way from there to Putney dehydrated and exhausted. The thing about a pair is that when you get tired and frustrated, you're frustrated and angry with the asshole you're rowing with, so the whole thing is a passive aggressive session all the way home.

InfrastructurePorn,3562jr,RedBreadRotesBrot,31,Thu May 7 14:46:27 2015 UTC,"The term grain elevator is a bit misleading.  It's just for storage.  Previous to grain elevators, grain was stored and handled in bags.  Now it's moved and stored in bulk.  The elevators offload grain from a ship, truck, or rail car, and dump it on top of the silo (via the actual elevator portion, a bucket elevator or pneumatic system).   To unload the silo, they just open a hole in the bottom of a silo and move it using an auger or pneumatic system."
InfrastructurePorn,3562jr,dawiseguy98,3,Thu May 7 15:03:41 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, loading grain onto ships is a time consuming process.  It takes days, because if you load it too fast, friction can cause spontaneous combustion in the hold.  Also, if it rains, they have to close the hatches and wait for it to end."

InfrastructurePorn,34t1v9,irishjihad,17,Tue May 5 00:17:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the attention!  This is Riverside Drive in Los Angeles. A wider view of this incredible rebar shot the same day  I also was struck by the density of rebar, and one person did say that getting the concrete to flow into and around all that metal was ""hard to do"".  I have to do other work stuff, but I will try to answer questions later today."
InfrastructurePorn,34t1v9,soupyhands,4,Mon May 4 16:56:02 2015 UTC,looks like the bar is only really dense in the transfer beam

It was super hazardous but I was very careful and slow walking across it.  Tripping was not an option.  Also, I didn't stay on it very long... if you're not sure you're allowed somewhere, keep moving... so I did.  but seriously I have to go do work stuff now...

InfrastructurePorn,34t1v9,liotier,30,Mon May 4 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"OP, are you sure this isn't a picture of rebar ready to be assembled on-site, rather than rebar already assembled? Or is it perhaps the connection point between the bridge deck and a pier (I'm guessing from the 90 degree bent vertical bars running to-left to middle-right of the picture)?  I'm not big on bridge design but I have scheduled concrete and I've never heard of bars of this sort of density, let alone diagonal bars (always longitudinal bars with transverse links), hardly any rebar protective caps except two I can see in the top-right, and an empty coke bottle sitting on top of it too...  I've not yet worked on-site but from my own conjecture: the bars seen running in parallel in the top left of the image are more in line with what you'd expect to see,and these diagonal bars are the result of a unique, detailed connection between two points, possibly a freeway on-ramp or something.  This is the kind of thing I expect to see when I opened this.. Nice mesh on top, A393 or something, much more symmetrical to look at and no diagonal bars. You can see the rebar chairs below the bottom rebar which hold the rebar in place to allow appropriate concrete cover below the rebar, so it isn't exposed to the elements, which would result in rust, and reduced tensile capacity, therefore reduced bending resistance. The mesh on top prevents surface cracking and can resist hogging moments too, although I haven't specified slabs in ages...  OP please give us some context on this if you can"
InfrastructurePorn,34t1v9,hidemeplease,1 point,Mon May 4 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"Come back to the thread, the diagonal bars are some sort of electrical conduits.  Discounting the post images nightmarish criss-cross, the other images OP posted look fairly close to the one you posted."

InfrastructurePorn,34t1v9,atomkarinca,11,Mon May 4 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"This is a reinforced structure so it consists of steel and concrete. For these two to act together, they have to adhere to one another. Usually a gap of 4/3 times the diameter of the rebar is left between the rebars. If you look at the picture, there is almost no gap between the thicker rebars."

From what OP has said this is So Cal, so those issues aren't prevalent, so black bar makes sense here."
InfrastructurePorn,34t1v9,colewinkle,3,Tue May 5 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"How are you supposed to have rust form if the rebar is epoxy coated?  You should know you can't pour the concrete until the rebar is fully coated with rust.  If it were consolidated,, it wouldn't be a mess, would it?  Pick one!  And ties will just keep the rebar from shifting.  The only way to get the concrete in there is to use a crowbar and pry while you are pouring the deck, and the ties make that impossible.  Sheesh."

In my experience, pedestrians think it's safe to enter the lane without looking and people opening passenger side doors are less likely to check that it's clear before doing so because they aren't concerned about opening their door and stepping into traffic."
InfrastructurePorn,34pjwe,GoPetADog,10,Sun May 3 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you, ideally there should be a buffer zone between the cars and the cycle lane - I really like the design New York City implemented: https://www.nyintl.net//uploads/imagebox/cycle_lane_nyc.jpg  I admit the space they left here is quite big, I guess a bit less would have enough of an effect as well. As for pedestrians: One can only hope people learn there is moving traffic in those lanes and act accordingly. The more people in a city cycle themselves, the less this kind of thing should happen - and I'd say they'd feel safer cycling between parked cars and the sidewalk than parked cars and moving cars."
InfrastructurePorn,34pjwe,Cespur,5,Sun May 3 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like those. To be honest, I don't like bike lanes that aren't separated by at least a curb because I feel like a car can crash into me any moment, and they preferably have a curb and some grass or trees. I'm Dutch though, and most of our bikelanes are thankfully constructed like that."

I don't think we should not do something good just because of a difficult transitional period."
InfrastructurePorn,34pjwe,cj5,3,Mon May 4 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"Wish we had separated bike lanes. On my commute to work everyday, I see cars driving in the shoulder/bike lane, like it was an extra car lane."
InfrastructurePorn,34pjwe,cj5,2,Sun May 3 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds like there would be at least theoretically enough space to cycle. What do these lanes usually look like where you live? Maybe a small physical barrier might help? Where I live, this seems to be the latest must-have for every city that wants to green-wash themselves into being all green and cycle-friendly. Drivers parking there? Surely won't happen! Getting a door slammed in your face while cycling there? No way, cycling on the road is of course always the safest option. It's quite frustrating to see those implemented in a lot of places (another example would be this: http://www.bamberger-onlinezeitung.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/85.jpg ) especially when there would be enough space for a proper separated cycletrack."

Good luck getting people to agree to increased taxes just so they can hide the freeway underground. Los Angeles has far more pressing problems with inadequate infrastructure to be worried about aesthetics. That I-710 corridor would be a nice start, but the NIMBYs will never let it happen in a million years, so maybe just fully funding the Purple Line Extension so it can get built in five years instead of 20 would be a good start."

The downtown green way is obviously the most visual improvement, but the project also made a massive improvement to traffic congestion. It increased the capacity of the downtown highway and bridge connecting the city to the north and provided a way for people going to and from the airport and north to bypass downtown altogether."
InfrastructurePorn,34nie7,Yotsubato,7,Sun May 3 01:19:06 2015 UTC,We need an alternative to Wilshire blvd and Santa Monica and no one wants the freeway in their neighborhood. So why not dig it down in there.
InfrastructurePorn,34nie7,cracked_mud,7,Sun May 3 00:25:13 2015 UTC,I think the bigger point is that placing any road underground is incredibly expensive. It can only be justified in the very densest of locations and West Los Angeles isn't such a location. The Purple Line Extension (as expensive as it is) is still far cheaper than burying an entire freeway.

LA has had the policy of building more and more freeways hoping that will fix everything. It doesn't. Highways are expensive and they induce demand which very quickly limits their overall impact.

InfrastructurePorn,348mm5,rotmoset,2,Sun May 10 21:05:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess the whole point is that you don't see the damage from the highways.  I think most urbanist, myself included, have concluded the emphasis on maximizing travel speed for cars at all cost, has been horrible for cities.  I'm not sure where you drove on the East Coast, but you inevitably drove through stretches of highway that were previously dense urban neighborhoods.  Just think of I-95, the main north/south highway along the Atlantic Coast.  While it's undoubtedly helpful for shipping goods and people between metro areas, but isn't it kind of insane this behemoth of a road separates Center City Philadelphia and the Delaware River?  Or in order to take it north of Philadelphia, you have to cut through dense northern NJ and even in to Manhattan for a bit.  How crazy is that?

InfrastructurePorn,345r71,Non-combative,17,Wed Apr 29 17:45:38 2015 UTC,"The British Antarctic Survey station Halley VI. Halley is built on the Brunt Ice Shelf, a floating area of ice that is flowing off the Antarctic Plateau some 50 km south of the station’s current location. As the ice flows off the mainland the buildings move with it – the station drifts northwest by around half a kilometre each year. As the ice shelf is pushed farther from the coast it is put under increasing strain by the motion of the tides until eventually a large section breaks off to form an iceberg.  The station is made up of eight modules connected by short, flexible corridors. The modules are kept above the snow surface using hydraulic legs mounted on skis. As well as keeping the buildings above the rising snow level, the design allows the station to be relocated across distances of many kilometres. The individual modules are designed to be separated, towed across the ice shelf by bulldozer, then connected again at the new site. This makes it possible for the station to remain a safe distance from the edge of the ice shelf.  Scientific experiments often compare results taken from different places and time periods. ESA signed an agreement with the British Antarctic Survey to perform experiments at their Halley VI station. Concordia research station offers ESA scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes. The crew at Halley experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level. Performing the same investigations at Halley will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data: air pressure. Source"

InfrastructurePorn,345r71,Picknipsky,8,Tue Apr 28 17:53:49 2015 UTC,"And during the summer, the sun has to penetrate the atmosphere at a very oblique angle resulting in considerably less light flux than the same panel at the equator."

InfrastructurePorn,345r71,Picknipsky,-2,Wed Apr 29 09:06:21 2015 UTC,just angle your panels to face the sun...
InfrastructurePorn,345r71,Picknipsky,8,Wed Apr 29 06:34:52 2015 UTC,"That's not the point. Sunlight striking the ground at a shallow angle must pass through vastly more air than sun from directly overhead, making it weaker. The sun is always low on the horizon at the poles which is why it's so goddamn motherfucking cold."

InfrastructurePorn,345r71,Picknipsky,2,Wed Apr 29 09:06:04 2015 UTC,"Solar panels would be great over summer, but useless over winter.  There is no good technical reason for them not to use solar over summer and there are many good technical reasons why they should.  As a rough rule of thumb, silicone based solar panels gain about 1% efficiency for every 10 degrees C they are cooled.  So at the cold temperatures they will see in this location they will be more efficient than you'd expect.  The sun is up all day, so you can generate continuous power (over summer).  The sun (more or less) just circles the horizon, so the panels can just be mounted vertically.  Everything around you is white, so even when your panel isnt facing the sun, its going to be working.  The sun does have to penetrate more atmosphere, but this is not a reason why solar panels would be less effective.  Its a good reason why a solar panel facing straight up at the sky would be less effective, but that would be a retarded way to set up your solar panels.  The air is very clear and sunlight really loses bugger all energy whether it passes through 100km of atmosphere or 500 km of atmosphere."

InfrastructurePorn,33x2s4,doctorsound,20,Sun Apr 26 19:15:29 2015 UTC,Haha.  The reason I call it that is because the lake (Tempe Town Lake is the proper name) is about 2 miles downstream from a wastewater treatment plant.  There've been issues with the fecal coliform levels in the lake being far beyond what's allowed.  There's a persistent stench that emanates as well.  I went kayaking a couple of times on it... but you're supposed to have a permit ($35).  I got stopped by the park fuzz (before I knew about the permit) and he wouldn't let me go in.  I figured $35 to kayak in a wastewater pond was a ripoff when every other reservoir is free for human powered craft.  Why would I pay to paddle around in fecal coliform?

InfrastructurePorn,33x2s4,King-in-Council,9,Sun Apr 26 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"Well it's kind of worse then a tube that spits you out the wall of the dam. Firstly, I don't think this is really a spillway, spillways are more so for overflow.  I would call this part of the penstock.   So water enters the penstock, often times it gets slightly smaller in diameter to increase the speed & force of the water, then it goes through the blades of a turbine and then out the bottom of the dam- under water.    Somewhere there is also a screen to protect the blades of the turbine from damage. So you would get caught on that and if you weren't dead already you would be soon.    EDIT: What is picture is a variation bell mouth spillway. Everything u/Narissis said is correct. It's clearly used to regulate the water levels of the reservoir and not feed the turbine. I got distracted by the more traditional image of an open channel spillway and wanting to describe the horror of ending up in a penstock. Interestingly when you type 'bell mouth spillway' into google the next word is 'deaths'."
InfrastructurePorn,33x2s4,Narissis,12,Sun Apr 26 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"A penstock would be designed to always be filled with water, though. I'm quite certain this is in fact a spillway; it's just one that uses a closed design instead of being an open trough.  This would increase the amount of water that can enter it before it gets 'saturated' and causes the reservoir level to begin to rise.  A lot of times you'll see photos of spillways like this where they're bone-dry because the water level isn't high enough to reach the lip."

InfrastructurePorn,33vhiz,paintball6818,6,Sun Apr 26 00:47:01 2015 UTC,"The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, more commonly referred to as the Q Bridge (the ""Q"" referring to ""Quinnipiac"") by locals, is a partially completed extradosed bridge that carries Interstate 95 (Connecticut Turnpike) over the mouth of the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Currently, the northbound span of the new extradosed bridge carries both northbound and southbound traffic, while the original girder-and-floorbeam bridge that opened in 1958, is demolished and the new southbound span is built in its place. The original 1,300 m (0.8 mi) span – which opened on January 2, 1958 – was a girder and floorbeam design where steel beams support the concrete bridge deck. The bridge carried three lanes of traffic in each direction with no inside or outside shoulders. The bridge was officially dedicated as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge in 1995 to commemorate the attack on Pearl Harbor.[2]  The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge is being replaced by a $554 million 10-lane extradosed bridge; the northbound span of which opened to traffic on June 22, 2012. Southbound traffic was shifted onto the new bridge, sharing the northbound span with northbound traffic until the new southbound span is completed in late 2015. Since the Gibbs Street Bridge in Portland, Oregon was redesigned from an extradosed span to a box girder bridge, the Pearl Harbor Memorial bridge is on track to be the first extradosed bridge in the United States when it fully opens in 2016.[3] The new bridge is the centerpiece of a $2 billion megaproject to reconstruct and widen 13 miles (21 km) of I-95 between West Haven and Branford.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_Memorial_Bridge_(Connecticut)   In an extradosed bridge, the deck is directly supported by resting on part of the tower, so that in close proximity to the tower the deck can act as a continuous beam. The cables from a lower tower intersect with the deck only further out, and at a lower angle, so that their tension acts more to compress the bridge deck horizontally than to support it vertically. Thus the cable stays act as prestressing cables for a concrete deck, whether made with I-beam girders or a box girder. The deck of an extradosed bridge can be thinner than that of a comparable span-beam bridge, but must be thicker than that of a conventional cable-stayed bridge of comparable span.  Extradosed bridges are relatively expensive and material inefficient. Almost any span that could be bridged by an extradosed bridge could be spanned more inexpensively with a continuous girder, or more efficiently (but at even greater cost) with a cable-stayed. In most cases the spans are short enough that the use of cables is an aesthetic, rather than engineering-necessitated, choice. This does not imply that is a ""bad"" choice, since in some cases the difference in cost and efficiency is small, and the extradosed type is a very elegant form.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradosed_bridge"
InfrastructurePorn,33vhiz,yuckyucky,6,Sun Apr 26 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great bridge, but it seems to me the majority of the aesthetic differences between the before and after are the construction equipment and the cloudy day in the before pic, rather than the bridge itself."

InfrastructurePorn,33at80,akadreamcrusher,8,Tue Apr 21 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm residing in Michigan and believed that all expressways were four to six lane divided highways with overpasses for trains and local traffic only. Aside from driving cross-country on I-80, it's the only place I've driven. Here (this is my last day in Texas), the overpasses are 100 feet high and sometimes go nowhere but back to to freeway they originated from. To be honest, though, it reminds me of a three highway interchange we'd pass in Oregon on our way to the science museum when I was a boy."
InfrastructurePorn,33at80,burgess_meredith_jr,7,Tue Apr 21 01:56:52 2015 UTC,If you like massive interchanges and overpasses take a trip a few hours north to Toronto.

InfrastructurePorn,33at80,Petrarch1603,11,Tue Apr 21 03:11:14 2015 UTC,They don't have a lot of those high overpasses up north cause they get all icey in the winter.

Both cities love what I call the ""rollercoaster overpass"" configurations. Both cities get cold snaps during the winter which have enough sustained cold temperatures that they can cause road ice. The infrastructure is not meant to deal with any major icing events, so all of these overpasses become accident magnets. Add in idiot drivers who think they can still do the speed limit and you've got almost a 100% chance of getting into a fender bender. That's why everyone just tells you to stay home and why even businesses close their doors if it ices over here."

Imagine having a nice rainy day when it's 28 degrees outside, and all the city does is salt the roads. Maybe throw a little sand down if you're lucky. They started using a de-icer here recently and tried to pre-treat the roads, which some people think might have caused accidents by making the roads more slippery."

InfrastructurePorn,33at80,WarriorHealer,6,Tue Apr 21 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"So you've got ""South"" geographically, and ""South"" culturally. Geographically, Texas is about as south as you can get when you're looking at a map (Florida having the furthest southern points in the continental US). So when you ask people about things like census and  geography, yeah, Texas is ""South"" or ""South-Central"" or ""Southern"".   However, when most people mention ""The South,"" they're usually referring to the Deep South culturally. While parts of Eastern-most Texas can fall into this category, most of Texas does not. The reason why Texans (and probably a good chunk of the rest of the United States) don't consider Texas as part of the ""Deep South,"" is due to the diversity. Thanks to the sheer size of the state, we've got parts that people would consider Deep South, Central, North Mexico, and the Southwest. That's why when people say ""Texas is Texas,"" it's because it's hard to categorize the state as any other single pigeonholed description."

Ok, now that I've gotten that out of the way, the biggest issue with monorails is switching. With this kind of hanging monorail, your switches need to be incredibly robust. But the purpose behind a switch is that it needs to move easily. Those are directly contradictory engineering goals. For over the top monorails, like in Seattle, a switch would be hundreds of feet long, and require moving easily a hundred tons of concrete beam and track a good 10 feet over. On the other hand, standard railroad switches move maybe 15 feet of two separate rails, and at 40 pounds per foot, that's about half a ton, and they only need to move a distance to clear the wheel flange - maybe two or three inches. So just on the basis of reliability and adaptability through switching, monorails have a major drawback to standard rail technologies."

If you clight the ""Monorail Diagram"" link here, you'll see a diagram of why. It's largely because of added costs for the structure."
InfrastructurePorn,32zsix,Zernhelt,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the real problem with monorails is that all the minor little details make them no different from conventional metros/subways. They must be totally ""grade separated""- meaning a monorail beam cannot physically cross a road at ground level, there has to be some kind of bridge or tunnel just as with a third rail powered train(and even the CTA brown line in Chicago crosses streets at ground level with a third rail). Then, because of safety regulations any newly built monorail in the USA or Europe must line the guideway with catwalks so passengers can escape in an accident. This makes the thin beam bulkier and visually as ugly as a normal train bridge."

InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,fernguts,20,Wed Apr 15 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"I studied these things in ecology in university. It's not about preventing animals getting killed by cars.      Large highways effectively divide a single wildlife habitat in two. So if you have a deer population, now you have two, each with half of the population, and half of the genetic diversity, which is bad. And of course, it also upsets migration patterns. Put together, those factors can have a dramatic effect.    But where it really matters is with large predators. You see, a deer could survive off of a few acres of plant life. But a wolf needs to eat many deer, so therefore many acres of plant life are required. Given that they can only eat a fraction of the deer without reducing the deer population, and there needs to be many wolves to maintain a genetically diverse breeding population, there has to be a very large area of habitat. The bigger the predator, the bigger the required habitat. That's why you never see large predators living on modestly sized islands.      So when you take a functional habitat, and you clove it in twain with a 4 lane highway, you can really screw up the ecosystem, and in many cases, severely deplete the large predator population.    So they built these land bridges across the highways. Result? They worked marvelously. It has been one of the most effective conservation projects ever.     Having said that, it was always assumed that the predators would learn to hunt near the bridges, which is why, when they were deployed, there were a number of future steps planned to compensate for that. For example, one of the more evil ideas is to issue a limited number of wolf hunting permits for areas near the bridges."
InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,datums,5,Thu Apr 16 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"It's not about preventing animals getting killed by cars.    I've heard first-hand from people involved in the project that preventing animals being hit by cars was one of the major motivations behind it.  You're correct that animal overpasses/underpasses were only introduced when the highway was twinned, but the problem existed long before that.    The ecosystem there is quite used to dealing with obstructions, such as mountain ridges and fast-flowing rivers.  The introduction of wildlife overpasses has added a new obstruction, but it's surely better than allowing daily carnage on the highway.  Take a look at the carcasses in the ditches outside the national parks, and you'll see what I'm talking about."
InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,TardisTechnologist,3,Thu Apr 16 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"You're both right in a way, fencing the highways is what ""cloves in twain"" (hehe) the ecosystem, although the highway alone does to an extent. Allowing animals to cross with the rest of it fenced off both prevents animals from being able to get on the road and avoids the ecological problems mentioned.  Either way, the animals being killed by cars really isn't a huge concern (maybe in parks etc. it is but these are seen elsewhere too), the concern is drivers getting killed by animals on the road. Many people die from hitting moose and deer at highway speeds every year, and countless drivers damage their cars hitting raccoons or much worse skunks. The number of dead animals isn't much of a concern compared to the damage to human lives.  But yeah, the purpose is to  both prevent animal-car collisions and the land bridge is to prevent damage to the ecosystem."

As for breathing predators, I fully expect any increase in their kill rate is vastly offset by fewer deaths by car, and over the next 20 years would expect some meaningful change in wolf and cougar populations (the latter is already on a notable, but unrelated upswing in population lately)"
InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,yetkwai,4,Thu Apr 16 03:42:47 2015 UTC,Would it be any different than a predator hanging out at a water hole or a narrow pass in the mountains?
InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,AdamDe27,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:11:59 2015 UTC,Well water is necessary for survival so there's a reward/risk ratio there.  Simply migrating or searching for new habitat (or maybe they have asshole squirrels for neighbors) isn't crucial for life 100% of the time.  Eventually they learn that it's a fatal funnel and the smart ones avoid it.
InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,PAY_CLOSE_ATTENTION,31,Thu Apr 16 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"this isn't true.    ""We conclude that the evidence for the existence of prey-traps is scant, largely anecdotal, and tends to indicate infrequent opportunism rather than patterns of recurring predation""  "" The proximity of ungulate kill sites to the highway was similar before and after construction of fencing and crossing structures."" ... "" We found no evidence that predator behavior at crossing structures is affected by prey movement"""
InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,L8sho,-7,Thu Apr 16 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I buy that. As a lifelong trophy whitetail hunter, a large part of the strategy is to find natural ""funnels"" that channel deer movement. I would find it hard to believe that nature isn't cashing in as well."

InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,L8sho,-3,Thu Apr 16 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"Having done a bit of work for scam groups such as The Nature Conservancy, I must point out that you can ""prove"" most almost anything if you have deep enough pockets backing you up.  By the way, check out ""Point # 7"" from your first cited article. It openly admits that there hasn't been significant study of the phenomenon we are discussing.  The second cited article is slightly more credible, but it seems to be only an abstract available. The basis for the ""validity"" of the idea that there was no predator/passageway interaction was that there were few observed ""kill sites"". These so called ""biologists"" (likely academics with little outdoor experience) obviously know little about the coyote, which would be one of the primary predators in that habitat (Banff).   It only takes a couple of coyotes to make an adult deer ""disappear"", where evidence of the animal's death would be non-existent within a few hours. Hunters in my part of the world lose mortally wounded deer to coyotes in the time it takes to walk back to get a vehicle to retrieve it. Frequently, a few ""puffs"" of fur are all that are left, which are totally gone within 24 hours.  Aside from observed ""kill sites"", the other method used was game cameras. Any hunter worth his salt knows that animals frequently identify them as a threat and change traffic patterns accordingly.   I say that the jury is still out on this one. Remember, there was a time when the Earth was flat and cigarettes were good for you."

It's modern folklore that never really existed. At least between anybody educated and not paid by marketing companies.  I'm not going to down vote you bc I do agree these studies don't prove that funnel points don't exist, but at the same time, comparing sentient humans to wild animals, no matter how smart, is not exactly proof that they do. Right now, the against category proof is outweighing the for category proof. You may discount these peer reviewed studies, but until you have anything more than anecdotal evidence, your opinion doesn't really mean anything."

InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,Col_mac,11,Wed Apr 15 19:51:53 2015 UTC,I am not a landscape ecologist. But my best guess would be that they are wide enough as the animals are using them. They just need more of them. There are now four of these throughout the park as well as a number of underpasses that go unnoticed to drivers.   The biggest reason they put these in is that the trans-Canada highway bisects the park and there are fences on either side of the road to prevent large animals from getting on to the highway. This causes habitat fragmentation and was leading to population inbreeding on either side of the highway.  To the best of my knowledge they are working to prevent population inbreeding.

InfrastructurePorn,32pn9g,OldButStillFat,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:35:44 2015 UTC,of course it is going to be implemented based on a cost-benefit assessment. It would be foolish to fund one project that only benefits one goal e.g. wildlife protection when you can also use it to prevent the animals from crossing the road and causing accidents or vice versa.  The job of policy makers is to make sure the resources are allocated in a way that benefits the MOST for society. Sometimes it is misused but this is not one of these times.

InfrastructurePorn,32k7ie,shniggy222,7,Tue Apr 14 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"In this area, no, it probably doesn't matter that much. If there were faster trains coming through, or if the cargo cared about swaying back and forth as it got shunted around, the lack of maintenance could quickly become a problem. But with the low speed and simple cargo, coupled with the fact that trains really don't care about a little grass in their way, I doubt this is slowing them down that much, if at all. And if it was, they probably wouldn't have let it reach this point."

Instead of building a freeway through the city centre, we built expressways up to the fringes (like Bow Trail in my picture), built light rail, run express buses, and put a cap on the number of downtown parking spots.

InfrastructurePorn,3294nv,salty-kraken,46,Sat Apr 11 19:22:02 2015 UTC,"According to the wikipedia page, it seems like this is a bus line that was designed to incorporate both bus and light rail features. It's special track design enables high speeds for buses (especially around turns) where special guide wheels are used on the sides that can roll on the vertical wall face. It enables them to go as fast as 100 kph (~60 mph) which is fairly fast for a commuter bus. It doesn't go into too much detail about how it works, but it does indicate that it is safer than traditional pavement. Apparently, the walls act as a safety feature, treating the bus as if it were on rails - while part of the line was going to be a  standard paved surface, they found that this design, while more expensive, enabled safer travelling at faster speeds. The center of the road is unnecessary due to the buses' track path and if anything discourages car usage on the busway.  It seems they originally intended to build a light rail line but there was a lot of public opposition. They wanted something similar with diesel buses so they came up with this hybrid influenced by a system in Essen, Germany where buses utilized existing tram infrastructure."
InfrastructurePorn,3294nv,papperonni,32,Sat Apr 11 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"if anything discourages car usage on the busway.   They actually installed 'sump busters' which literally break the oil pan of anything with less ground clearance than a bus. It happens to a couple of idiots a year.  ""Cars entering the O-Bahn are deterred by a large number of signs at entrance points and a ""sump buster"" device that rips out a car's sump (oil pan) if it gets onto the track.

My understanding is that steel wheel on steel rail has lower friction and generally you could put more load on an axle, so conventional trains always will have a niche in being bigger and heavier and more efficient per unit of cargo or passenger moved provided enough demand exists along a route.  Likewise airports and a few cities have rubber tired metros. These usually have a third rail or linear induction motor strips. Thus they have to be guided.  But a diesel bus on a guideway seems like a 80's thing. Nowadays I could see this being a separate flat roadway and the buses having a special autopilot mode.

At most stations (if not all), the track forks into two parallel tracks, allowing for trains in both directions to pass with the other stopped at the same station.

Subsequently, a project was set in motion to reconstruct it, and the rebuilt bridge opened on 23 July 2004.

In 1900, the bridge was dismantled and simultaneously rebuilt out of steel to allow it to accommodate heavier trains. It stayed in commercial service until 1959 and was sold to the Government of Pennsylvania in 1963, becoming the centerpiece of a state park. Restoration of the bridge began in 2002, but before it was finished, a tornado struck the bridge in 2003, causing a large portion of the bridge to collapse. Corroded anchor bolts holding the bridge to its foundations failed, contributing to the collapse.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinzua_Bridge  This is another picture of the first bridge.

InfrastructurePorn,308tqb,adambomb5060,2,Wed Mar 25 20:02:30 2015 UTC,I have a question for you.   Is that road surface a low quality surface? I was reading a few months ago that the deep black road surfaces contain a lot of recycled oil products which makes them much weaker than a traditional asphalt & aggregate mixture. Is that true or not?
InfrastructurePorn,308tqb,iamnothappy2,4,Thu Mar 26 09:52:06 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no.  Long answer: I don't know anything about this particular mix, since I'm American and Europe tends to be way ahead of us on this stuff. That said, all pavement is made of 2 things (as you said): aggregate and asphalt binder. Recycled material is those two things, aged significantly, and when you heat it up to production temperatures, the binder in the recycled material will become fluid again.  Asphalt pavement has to perform under two extreme environmental conditions: hot summer, when it absorbs heat from the sun and can go well over 100 deg. F, and winter, when temperatures can get well below freezing. Of course, this isn't everywhere, so there are different grades of asphalt binder that are applicable to specific geographic locations. The difference between these binders is basically differing viscosity, resulting from the types and sizes of organic compounds (since asphalt is a product of the oil refinement process) that make up the binder.  Generally, longer organic compounds impart more strength at the cost of flexibility. At higher temperatures, the pavement must be strong enough to carry the traffic load without permanently deforming, and at low temperatures, it must be flexible enough to disperse the stresses induced by the traffic load without cracking.  So back to your question. New asphalt pavement will always be black (assuming it has enough binder). The reasons it turns lighter over time are 1) oxidation - oxygen infiltrates the pavement and lengthens and rearranges the organic compounds, and 2) wear - some of the surface binder is worn off, revealing the (often) gray aggregate. Asphalt pavement is the most widely recycled material in the US (about 85% is recycled), and recycled pavement does add a certain amount of binder (and binder with long, rearranged organic compounds in it), so there are practical limits to how much is used in a mix.  Now, technically, the longer organic compounds that come as a result of oxidation make the pavement ""stronger"" but at the expense of flexibility. When engineers talk about strength, we're specifically talking about simple bearing capacity, while a layman might consider flexibility/ductility/elasticity - essentially its ability to deform and rebound to its original configuration - to be part of the overall strength of a material. So, while an older, grayer pavement may be ""stronger,"" this is because it has lost most of its flexibility to oxidation. When a pavement is no longer flexible, it cracks. Cracks let water in, and if you don't have low temperatures, the water could get into the gravel base and wash out the smaller particles, eventually leading to sinkholes; if you do have low temperatures, the water might sit between pavement layers, or in the base, freezing and thawing, causing the pavement to flex and crack more (if it's new and flexible, it will resist cracking).  Should I do a tl;dr? Basically, strength and flexibility, to an engineer, are two separate properties. Pavement loses flexibility and gains strength over time through oxidation, which also lightens the color of the pavement. So, while darker (newer) pavement will have less strength, it will deform elastically, and keep its shape; lighter (older) pavement will not deform as easily under heavy loads, but the stress from loading is dissipated through cracking instead, which weakens the pavement significantly."

The 1 in Los Angeles doesn't look like this, it is smaller and through most of the city it has traffic lights so it doesn't use ramps to maintain traffic speed as you enter and exit.   This is the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange which joins the I-105 and I-110 in south LA. If you google it there are many more great pictures and a good wiki article.   It's worth noting that the photo here doesn't capture the height of the interchange, it's massive. This one does a better job (http://www.rtengineering.net/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/110_105_interchange_photo.200162611_std.jpg). Sorry for the huge link I'm on mobile.

In the US when a freeway is built, its so well engineered that even 60 years from completion, they are still good at handling traffic. In India, they have the chance to do the same, but instead just throw money at projects without even planning it well. Its not completely obvious from this picture, but you can tell when you drive on projects like this, the difference between a cloverleaf in the US and for example this one. The curves won't be right, there won't be that detailed planning and it won't be efficient and isn't even adequate for current usage, meaning there's absolutely no way it'll come even near to lasting 60+ years. It really would not have cost them more, especially in the long run to use knowledge on banking angles and curves etc to build an efficient interchange instead thanks to shoddy govt agencies and lousy contractors they build a sub-par design"

I honestly feel a major reason that 80% of the country is completely vegetarian apart from Religious outlook is that all the meat here is SKANK because they have no way to regulate and monitor it properly.   Go through Customs at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and you will get a great taste of India.  4 years ago a friend and I were taken into a small office and told you give me 500 USD or I will say I found this in your pocket,  the customs agent then held a up a bag of FUCKING METH.

The area is very densely populated so they had to build an overhead roundabout to keep traffic flowing. Before, there were two bottleneck intersections here. The cables don't serve any useful purpose, just for show. My best guess is the overzealous CM talked the architects into adding it.  I think if you remove the cables, it makes more sense. There's a BRT line running underneath with a station (barely visible in the background) because of which, an overhead roundabout was necessary as there's no way you could've kept that line separated from traffic otherwise."

InfrastructurePorn,2zgqgc,Narissis,7,Thu Mar 19 14:04:48 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder what people far into the future will think about  the engineering skill that went into making such an awesome looking piece of architecture.
InfrastructurePorn,2zgqgc,ArmoredCavalry,2,Wed Mar 18 19:02:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting info. Yeah, I saw that episode of Last Week Tonight, definitely worries me that infrastructure maintenance is so low priority.  Those are some cool looking bridge remains.

InfrastructurePorn,2zgqgc,ArmoredCavalry,1 point,Thu Mar 19 12:49:13 2015 UTC,"I was more thinking of how we marvel at a thousand year old stone bridge today. It always impresses me that people were able to build things in ancient times that stand up to the test of time so well (or at least, the things we see did!)  Although, I guess in the future people will be able to look up records on how exactly we built things. A little different than when we look at something like Stonehenge and can only wonder how they achieved it."
InfrastructurePorn,2zgqgc,Narissis,2,Wed Mar 18 22:16:11 2015 UTC,"Plus, the added complexity of our modern structures means reduced lifespan compared to ancient ones. :/  A cable-stayed bridge can cross massive expanses that our ancient ancestors could only dream of, but the concrete and steel will deteriorate in a matter of hundreds of years, rather than the thousands for historic stone bridges and edifices."
InfrastructurePorn,2zgqgc,BurgerBuoy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I actually wonder, have any massive ""modern"" bridges like this reached the end of their life yet?  Seems like the technology to build them is still too new for that to happen. Will be interesting once it does reach that time though, wonder if they will just close them off and let them decay, or actually take them apart/demolish them."
InfrastructurePorn,2zgqgc,slotard,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:52:52 2015 UTC,"Right now, it seems to be mostly bridges around the century mark that are starting to go. Like the East part of the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge. Though even that one could've stood longer in ideal conditions; it was replaced mostly for seismic safety reasons.  With careful maintenance, we can keep bridges in good shape for a long time. That's the big difference, I think; all that old Greek and Roman stone infrastructure managed to last for centuries without much upkeep."

InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,John_Barleycorn,46,Sun Mar 15 18:27:23 2015 UTC,So the weight on the bridge is going to be exactly the same regardless of there being a big boat on top of it right? Since the water will be displaced and all that
InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,EastenNinja,16,Sun Mar 15 23:48:05 2015 UTC,Hmmm.... I think you're right unless the boat bottomed out.  That's pretty neat.
InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,AndrewCarnage,4,Sun Mar 15 23:59:05 2015 UTC,You can tell it's a mega-yacht because of the way it is!
InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,MrBig0,16,Mon Mar 16 18:00:55 2015 UTC,"I came here to say this. Depending on the size of the yacht compared to the size of the channel you might have water pushed up in front of it due to lack of space to flow around it, but I'd expect the design of the aquaduct to be adequate for water overflowing."
InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,slotard,9,Mon Mar 16 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The weight on the ""bridge"" is exactly the same as if there were nothing crossing it."
InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,RazorDildo,2,Mon Mar 16 02:14:15 2015 UTC,"In theory yes, as long as the body of water it is on is extremely large, but if it was a lock system or a closed off channel then the displacement of the boat would be centered on its own area. But I'm sure it is the former."
InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,SmartFarm,3,Mon Mar 16 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"You are getting down votes, but you are right, if the system is small enough the addition of the boat will cause the water level to rise and this will add additional weight to the bridge"

InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,2-4601,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:23:49 2015 UTC,So the downward pressure created by the boat is negated because none of that pressure actually touches the wall of the bridge?
InfrastructurePorn,2z59be,GreyscaleCheese,3,Mon Mar 16 16:38:59 2015 UTC,There is no net increase because instead of one metric shit-ton of water there is now a yacht-shaped hole filled with one metric shit-ton of yacht.

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Enavantfanfan,13,Wed Mar 11 20:50:49 2015 UTC,There are fewer conflict paths than on a regular multi-lane roundabout therefore they have a higher capacity and are safer.  http://www.turboroundabout.com/benefits.html
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,T-Altmeyer,8,Wed Mar 11 21:01:39 2015 UTC,But you can't do one important thing: turn and go the direction you came from.

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,pleasebekidding,2,Thu Mar 12 15:18:59 2015 UTC,Did anyone study the impact of the lane changes required before the roundabout and if there were more accidents caused as people cut others up to avoid going 10 miles in the wrong direction.  I guess I'm asking is the roundabout safer as all accidents now happen before you get on it.

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,ENWOD,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:48:02 2015 UTC,well in that case why not just build a north american style 4-way cross junction?
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Enavantfanfan,16,Wed Mar 11 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"These are significantly safer than regular 4-way intersections because you can't speed right through it and there are far fewer conflict points. The only conflict points are on entry. This reduces the amount and severity of the accidents.  edit: comparing to regular 4-way intersection, not multi-lane roundabout."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,T-Altmeyer,6,Wed Mar 11 21:30:10 2015 UTC,I would have thought a continuous-flow clover leaf junction would be safest. The only interaction is when you merge onto the new road
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Jembers1990,5,Thu Mar 12 01:33:32 2015 UTC,That's the safest but it is expensive and takes up a lot of land

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Jembers1990,13,Thu Mar 12 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"I don't see fewer conflict points. If you come from the S and take a left turn, you interfere with SEVEN other traffic flows: W-E, W-N, E-S, E-W, N-E, N-S, N-W. Seems to me like a waste of everyone's time."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Tjeptjeptje,11,Wed Mar 11 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm legitimately confused as to how anyone can only see one point of conflict for any direction, unless you're staying on the very outside lane, and taking the immediate right."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Ancient_Unknown,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:39:55 2015 UTC,"Of course, but not seven. If this were a simple roundabout, a driver coming from the S and heading for the W would only interfere with THREE traffic flows: when merging onto the roundabout and when passing the access roads coming from the E and the N. The whole point of a roundabout is to merge traffic flows and thus reduce the number of conflict points, which isn't the case for this ""upgraded"" roundabout."

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,poster_nutbag_,2,Thu Mar 12 14:45:13 2015 UTC,"By your logic, each entry point is a conflict point. Even when you are in the roundabout you aren't totally in the clear because each entry you pass is a conflict point. And in this particular one, you might pass a lot of entries depending on which way you go.   On a smaller scale I can see the benefits of a roundabout, but this particular one does not seem very safe."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,LordoftheSynth,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:03:55 2015 UTC,"With that amount of land already used, I'm surprised they didn't just replace it with a 4-way CFI/XDL, if there's not funding to build proper grade separation."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,XJ-0461,2,Thu Mar 12 05:44:11 2015 UTC,"Me neither, seems kinda worse. Yeah, it is flow-y, but you have to stop more."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,T-Altmeyer,14,Wed Mar 11 20:55:58 2015 UTC,Once you're on the roundabout you have right of way. There's a maximum of one stop just like on a regular roundabout.
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,volatile_ant,7,Wed Mar 11 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"Are you sure?  It looks like there are traffic signals before entering the roundabout, and another set of signals at each major crossing (at the thick white lines that run across the lane, most noticeable on the upper right of the roundabout, behind the black car)."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Cert47,3,Wed Mar 11 22:23:57 2015 UTC,"Try looking at someone coming from the left of the image wanting to go up: I count 5 spots with traffic crossing that lane, and 2 spots with merging.  As I see it there is no roundabout to be on."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,XJ-0461,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"And I assume you have to stop at all thick white lines. So that is 1, 2, or 3 times going from turning right to straight to turning left."

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,ModusPwnins,2,Wed Mar 11 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"In most of the U.S., vanilla roundabouts are ""fucking local experiments"" for the same reason. I love them, but we have one here that resulted in a lot of confusion and minor fender benders when it opened."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,vanisaac,2,Thu Mar 12 13:09:01 2015 UTC,minor fender benders when it opened.   That's actually kind of the point of roundabouts. All the merging and weaving action is designed to replace the T-bones and head-ons of signalized intersections with merging sideswipes and rear-ends - essentially replacing high-fatality crashes with minor fender benders that everyone walks away from.
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,ModusPwnins,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"I love roundabout, they are a whole lot safer and traffic can flow a lot better.

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Colonel_Rhombus,3,Thu Mar 12 03:34:39 2015 UTC,There's nothing 'turbo' about a roundabout with dozens of traffic lights strewn across it.  It defeats the whole object of having continuous flow.

InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,RimePendragon,2,Thu Mar 12 03:26:13 2015 UTC,"It's the Netherlands, so of course. Their infrastructure for bicycles and pedestrians far outclasses everywhere else in the world.   You can see bicycle paths in the bottom left and at the top right. However, I suspect that the bicycle routes here are taking a slightly different alignment than the road to a separate bike junction, avoiding the need to interact with this one at all - a modern policy called unravelling of modes."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,Dear_Watson,2,Thu Mar 12 20:18:54 2015 UTC,The turbo roundabout was formally developed in 1996 in the Netherlands by Lambertus Fortuijn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMYib3IR43I  Turbo roundabouts: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout#Turbo_roundabouts
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,ka0t1k,2,Thu Mar 12 14:33:15 2015 UTC,"For those who don't understand how it works I made a basic flow model in Microsoft Paint...  So basically you go in one side (Top, Bottom, Left or Right) and then get in a lane that describes where you want to go in reference to the central circle. There is no turning into other lanes, aka right or left hand turns, so you continue around the roundabout without making any turns... IRL this system would be about 65% more efficient than a similar 4-way stop, and would allow about 30% more through-put than a similarly sized typical roundabout."
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,T-Altmeyer,5,Thu Mar 12 19:25:57 2015 UTC,This would be way more confusing than it needs to be
InfrastructurePorn,2ypqtr,LoudMusic,10,Wed Mar 11 21:04:17 2015 UTC,Turbo-roundabouts are designed to be less confusing to drivers than regular roundabouts and it's a design that works.  The one in the picture isn't on street-view yet. Try navigating this one instead.

InfrastructurePorn,2yk36c,fastfood8891,3,Tue Mar 10 17:30:10 2015 UTC,agreed
InfrastructurePorn,2yk36c,Sasakura,4,Tue Mar 10 18:54:08 2015 UTC,HDR is to allow scenes with greater dynamic range than the sensor to be captured or represented.  Tilt shift is to correct perspective in angled shots.  Both are practically invisible when used correctly (ne traditionally).  Why use either when they're not required?  Fake HDR destroys contrast which usually looks worse; fake reverse-TS generally just looks weird.

InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,LMB222,9,Mon Mar 9 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, this would be an awesome way to complete I-710 through S. Pasadena in the L.A. area."
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,rockymountainoysters,9,Mon Mar 9 16:12:51 2015 UTC,I see L.A. still hasn't learned anything from its $1.1bn widening of the 405 or any of the countless futile attempts at highway congestion-relief-through-highway-construction and wants its own $5.4bn Big Dig...
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,digitalsciguy,9,Mon Mar 9 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"All that 405 widening did to the actual freeway's capacity was to add a carpool lane.  There are tons of obvious reasons why carpool lanes aren't very effective, but they get built in SoCal anyway because they trigger a federal financial boost, helping fund the overall project.  A lot of the rest of the work involved ramps onto/off the freeway, which were quite effective in relieving surrounding neighborhoods.  Adding a whole new link to close the I-710 gap is an entirely different kind of deal."
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,rockymountainoysters,6,Mon Mar 9 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"In Sydney, the government built a 4km tunnel, the M5 East, to connect a missing link between the South-Western Freeway and General Holmes Drive (the main freeway to the central business district)  Within two years the tunnel reached capacity, and is so overloaded with cars during peak hours that they're going to spend $5 billion to widen it to five lanes in each direction (3 lanes towards the new city bypass, 2 lanes to the city and port) by 2019. The original tunnel cost $795 million to build.  The moral of the story is to build it for the future. LA would probably need to build it with 7 lanes in each direction if they don't want it to have a toll or be gridlocked within a few years. Good luck with that!"
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,mubd1234,3,Mon Mar 9 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"Good moral.  I'm sure something similar would happen with I-710, in a place like Los Angeles especially.  Why didn't Sydney put tolls in that tunnel when they built it?"
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,rockymountainoysters,2,Tue Mar 10 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"It was originally slated to have a toll, which was abolished by the government after the design was completed, hence why it became overloaded so quickly."

InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,neanderthalman,10,Wed Mar 11 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"If you look at the map it's ""undercutting"" a roundabout, one major intersection and few smaller ones. My guess it's to ease up congestion in that part while not having to destroy anything."
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,Mattho,6,Mon Mar 9 19:18:37 2015 UTC,The wiki page has more details on the ventilation fans than an explanation of the tunnel itself.   Wikipedia focusing on the important stuff.
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,audiored,11,Mon Mar 9 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"Despite this subreddit's masturbatory overtones about infrastructure, projects are hardly ever done for the sake of building something that one can slowly jerk off to while reading the engineering specs; one of the most important tenets of engineering is to design an efficient solution to a problem, and less a solution seeking a problem to be solved.  I would contend context about the tunnel's necessity and engineering are just as important as the infrastructure itself. I might add that many other Wikipedia pages on large infrastructure projects do include bits of information on funding sources, needs, and challenges to provide that context and allow one to appreciate the infrastructure on an entirely deeper level."
InfrastructurePorn,2ygafu,digitalsciguy,3,Mon Mar 9 19:42:36 2015 UTC,"Looking through Google Maps, it seems the point of the tunnel is to help relieve some traffic congestion without needing to build some very space-intensive on/off ramps. The land surrounding the street the tunnel is under is urbanized and undoubtedly prohibitively expensive to acquire.   The tunnel seems to bypass several artery roads (in the sense that a true intersection isn't required)."

If you can sell your photos, then good for you. But I have no need to buy a photo, ever, so I don't live in that world. If I want to look at photos, I live in a world where I can easily find innumerable expertly-crafted photos to look at, like yours, for free.  I live in a different world with regards to what I put on the internet as well. To explain my perspective, personally, I have never charged or made even one cent whenever I have provided unrequested services to the internet at large. I have provided code and bug fixes for open source projects, hosted dedicated game servers, and spent countless hours in internet forums dispensing advice related to topics in which I am experienced. This surely amounts to some ten thousand or more of hours of my time as well as a decent investment of my own money over the course of my life. I do it because it's fun, and I don't care that I'm coding for free when rates for contract programmers start at probably $50/hour in my area and climb significantly from there. I suppose if I didn't make a decent living as well, I wouldn't be able to do these things for free. I am not rich but I live comfortably. I'm not comparing your experience, ability, and chosen form of expression with mine, and I'm certainly not harshing on you at all for your choices.

It doesn't matter much what percentage of solar radiation the plant can turn into usable electricity, because the solar radiation is free.

InfrastructurePorn,2y554f,baddox,10,Fri Mar 6 23:20:04 2015 UTC,"You're right, I should not have used the word efficient. What I was trying to say is that both in watts per dollar, as well as watts per square foot, a solar tower is less desirable than, say, a solar cell array.

InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,yuckyucky,33,Thu Mar 5 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"Bertha, is a 17.5 meters (57 ft)-diameter tunnel boring machine built specifically for the Washington State Department of Transportation's (WSDOT) Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel project in Seattle.[1] It was made by Hitachi Zosen Sakai Works in Osaka, Japan, and the machine's assembly was completed in Seattle in June 2013. The name Bertha, after Seattle's only female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes, was chosen by a panel (that included the Governor and Transportation Secretary) from submissions from kindergarten through 12th graders, who were asked to submit female names with Washington state heritage.[2]  By December 6, 2013, Bertha had tunneled 1,019 ft (311 m), or 11%, of the total 9,270 ft (2,830 m) length of the tunnel,[3] stopping about 60 ft (18 m) below ground between South Jackson Street and South Main Street.[4] However, on that day the machine's progress was halted by an unexpected impediment.[5] After a month's investigation, WSDOT announced that the machine's cutting blades had encountered an 8 in (200 mm) diameter, 119 ft (36 m) long steel pipe, one of several well casings left over from a previous 2002 drilling project that had assessed groundwater conditions and soil stability in the area in case of another earthquake, such as the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, which led to a need for the replacing of the Alaskan Way Viaduct in the first place.[6][7] Because the machine cannot cut through metal, the pipe damaged several of Bertha's cutting blades, necessitating blade replacement before the machine could proceed.[7] The pipes' locations were known to WSDOT and the agency thought they had been removed. As of now it is unclear if the state agency or one of its contractors is responsible for the left-behind pipes, or who is responsible for allowing the tunneling to proceed without their removal.[6][7]  In early February 2014, as Bertha was preparing to continue drilling, workers discovered it was overheating and that a damaged main bearing seal needed to be replaced. Multiple options were discussed to fix the problem, but Bertha is expected to be out of commission until March 2015.[8] As of December 2014, workers were digging a pit in order to lift Bertha's front end up to street level for repairs.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(tunnel_boring_machine)"

InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,AviusQuovis,5,Thu Mar 5 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"Still, the plan of ""we're just going to hope it doesn't get stuck"" was really stupid.   According to the information I can find, the obstruction that the TBM ran into was a steel pipe from a past construction project that was documented as having been removed.  How is it stupid of them to be tunnelling through rock that is, based on official records, free and clear?  Are you really naive enough to think that the managers of the project did not conduct extensive inquiries into construction records as well as geological surveys to understand what they're drilling through?"
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,Narissis,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"When that much money is on the line, assuming that all records are correct and accounted for does seem a little naive.   Also, I'm no expert in boring machine engineering, but it doesn't seem that it would have been that hard to put a reverse gear in the drive train, so that they could back it up and visually inspect the cut face if needed."
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,AviusQuovis,3,Thu Mar 5 19:38:05 2015 UTC,"If you can't trust the records, there's no point in keeping records.  TBMs can't reverse, because they build the tunnel lining as they go, leaving an opening too narrow for their wider drilling head to fit through. However, it is possible for them to retract their face enough to create a maintenance opening to it. This is how cutting heads are replaced during the tunnelling process as the rock wears them dull, or to swap out for different kinds of rock.  Here's a video showing how a TBM works. You can see how the business end is actually quite short, and how it propels itself by pushing against the tunnel lining that it has constructed. Ain't no reversin' that.  Presumably in the case of the Alaskan Way tunnel, the damage was too extensive to repair with this relatively limited access."

It's stupid of them to do something where, if it fails, it can't be fixed. Mistakes happen; plans get screwed up. I don't really blame the people who screwed up the maps of what was left in the ground. I blame the people who designed a multi-billion dollar project with no margin for things going wrong, because things always go wrong. Even if this monstrosity gets restarted, what's going to happen when it gets stuck underneath a skyscraper downtown? At some point, you have to take a step back and notice that if the project is this brittle, someone screwed up in the planning stages."
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,grendel-khan,4,Thu Mar 5 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think you really grasp the simple conditions of working with TBMs. Yes, they are difficult to recover if an unforeseen problem occurs. But that's just the nature of the beast; the alternative would be far, far more expensive than using a TBM in the first place.  You're writing as if this is some kind of uniquely flawed, one-of-a-kind plan that was set up for failure. This isn't the case; TBMs are very widely-used and all TBM projects risk facing obstacles like this one. The efficiency easily outweighs the risk, and the exploratory work done beforehand means that operators should know exactly what they're tunnelling through and what to expect.  Don't blame the TBM and its planners for the fact that somebody cooked the books and said they'd removed a pipe when they hadn't.  It's also worth noting that if the TBM had encountered anything likely to actually be in the ground, this extent of repair wouldn't have been necessary. The unique problem here is that the steel damaged the cutting heads, which are designed for rock.  It's also worth noting that no TBM is ever easy to remove from the ground. For instance, one of the ones that built the Channel Tunnel was deliberately driven off-course and entombed under the middle of the English Channel because that was easier than dismantling and extracting it.  This is all very routine and par for the course for TBM projects; it doesn't constitute poor planning."
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,Narissis,-1,Thu Mar 5 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think you really grasp the simple conditions of working with TBMs. Yes, they are difficult to recover if an unforeseen problem occurs. But that's just the nature of the beast   I'll allocate some of the blame to planners who made ludicrously optimistic projections in order to get public approval, and played down the risks. You see the same kind of malfeasance in any megaproject, of course, from nuclear power plants to bridges.  TBMs involve risk. Making ridiculously optimistic plans to sell them to the public, then acting very surprised when they don't work out, is unconscionable.   the alternative would be far, far more expensive than using a TBM in the first place.   If you're considering the alternative to be building the tunnel via cut-and-cover, then certainly. But the other options included building another elevated highway and a sort of surface/transit option (not as crazy as it sounds; it's worked in other places).   This is all very routine and par for the course for TBM projects; it doesn't constitute poor planning.   The project is years behind schedule with no completion date on the board, and there's no way in hell it's going to come in on budget even if nothing else goes wrong, and I doubt you'd want to take that bet. Whatever this is, it's certainly not good planning."
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,laundry_box,2,Fri Mar 6 04:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the project was well-planned, necessarily, I'm saying the particular problem that caused this situation falls within an area of risk that no reasonable amount of planning would have been able to mitigate. The due diligence was done regarding the obstacle that stopped the TBM.  Whether or not projections were accurate or the public was misinformed or another option was a better idea to replace the viaduct - all of these things are irrelevant to what I'm saying. I'm talking specifically about the operation of the TBM. The reasons for using a TBM and the administration of the project are a whole other proverbial can of worms."
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,grendel-khan,4,Fri Mar 6 05:50:16 2015 UTC,How could they possibly have done it differently? It seems to me that when you're burrowing deep into solid earth the only plan is to cross your fingers and hope it doesn't get stuck.

So there were no other proposals to solve the original problems.    ... and worst of all, cut Seattle off from its gorgeous waterfront.   To get from the downtown core to the adjacent waterfront, pedestrians have to walk through a gloomy, shaded area beneath the highway   The point at which I stop reading: When it is postulated that 30 feet of shade is literally a Berlin Wall trapping the city."
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,Davecoupe,2,Thu Mar 5 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"If the proposal is ""fix transportation problem"", which presumably involves fixing congestion, then highway alternatives are also solutions. Just ask New York, which built a street replacement for a failing elevated highway and shoved the money into improving transit, and didn't see noticeably worse congestion. The tunnel project doesn't solve any actual transportation problems anyways, and may actually make things worse - the tunnel is smaller than the highway than it replaced, and also has no exits or entry points along its length, which is fairly pointless since the entire point of building the elevated viaduct in the first place was to provide access to downtown.  From an urban planning perspective, urban highways would probably be worse than an actual concrete wall, because at least a concrete wall can look pretty, is fairly quiet and doesn't give everyone asthma. Elevated highways generally blight areas, because they form a giant psychological barrier and walking under them is actually very unpleasant for various reasons. Now, granted, they take off a total of five minutes off your commute because you get to stop at less lights, but whether or not that is worth the billions of dollars is debatable."
InfrastructurePorn,2xzhgr,grendel-khan,2,Mon Mar 9 22:13:56 2015 UTC,"Your understanding of geotechnics and tunnelling is obviously limited. There would have been years of testing, exploration and desk studies to determine feasibility before construction planning even began.  Even with all the planning in the world, with tunnelling something usually goes wrong. It's the same with piling and all sub surface construction. Natural earth is the only unknown in modern construction, the limits of all the materials we use can be calculated and manipulated but the earth is natural.  There are seams of sand 2 feet wide, in what is otherwise solid rock, that can stop TBM's dead. In this case it was a pipe that had been recorded as removed, someone dun fucked up but a gravel seam could have caused worse delays, at least the pipe can be removed, a seam of gravel can't as it will probably contain a perched water table etc.  Basically working underground is like trying to find your way around a pitch black room, you can feel around for as long as you like but as soon as you stand up, you will step on the one bit of Lego that is in the one place you didn't check.

InfrastructurePorn,2xwgw2,tgeliot,1 point,Wed Mar 4 12:46:51 2015 UTC,Interesting that they have such a substantial bridge to what appears to be a very empty island.
InfrastructurePorn,2xwgw2,nilenilemalopile,2,Wed Mar 4 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"The island is not that empty (5th largest island in Croatia) and the bridge is not that substantial (300m).  What you're seeing here is the north-easern side of the island which is exposed to strong wind (called ""bura""). This strips the rocky surface of soil and subsequently, vegetation. The sheep do the rest. While the island is definitely not forested, it is not empty.   Roughly 8000 people live on it in two towns. In the summer the island is packed with tourists, and i would not be surprised if the population increases ten fold during the summer. Also, one of the most popular douche-party destinations is there."

That said, it runs parallel to the bridge, surely there could have been something more like a train that runs across the bridge stopping in the middle and connecting to an elevator?"
InfrastructurePorn,2xslte,sicarim,9,Tue Mar 3 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"There is  a train running to Roosevelt island (though it is a subway, not on a bridge). The tramway is for tourists and locals who happen to work right there in midtown, and it was built before a subway connection existed on the island."
InfrastructurePorn,2xslte,homeworld,5,Tue Mar 3 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting story:  Roosevelt Island, which the bridge touches upon going from Manhattan to Queens,  at various times hosted an insane asylum, a penitentiary, a charity hospital, a smallpox hospital and the like.  As such there wasn't any need for much in the way of transportation.  Interestingly, there was in fact just what you suggest, a trolley did go over the bridge (long gone) and there was a building with an elevator for the doctors and staff and such, long gone.  The only vehicular access was a bridge to Queens.  Then, along came a housing boom and residential buildings sprang up on the island in the 70s.  And  suddenly there were hundreds and more commuters and no reasonable public transportation to Manhattan... the subway actually runs under the island but it's one of the deeper tunnel and there was no station, and apparently building one was a really major undertaking.  So, the tram.  It was intended to be temporary but even after the new F station opened it was popular and apparently pretty cheap to operate so it remains.  Pretty cool view for $2.50 (and you can get a transfer from one of the buses that go by for free)."
InfrastructurePorn,2xslte,sicarim,6,Tue Mar 3 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"And don't forget about the vacuum tube garbage system.  http://www.wired.com/2010/08/trash-sucking-island/all/   A network of 20-inch tubes takes garbage from the island’s 16 residential towers, collecting from every floor, to a central collection point where it is compacted and trucked off the island. It is at once a simple and elegant solution to gathering trash, and an aging and complicated beast that needs a lot of upkeep.  Each residential tower has chutes in the hallways where people simply deposit their trash which collects on a platform in the tube at the bottom of the building (above). Five times a day, the turbines are turned on and the platforms are pulled out from under the trash so it can be sucked away through the tubes."

I remember them doing interviews with people working with dams and getting all this interesting information from them. Then they would just completely disregard it! Go right back to the ""all dams are evil."" stance.  I was looking for something that actually conveyed information, but this so called documentary wanted to convey some shitty ideology instead of specific information that people could use to make their own opinion on the matter.   It was just idiotic. Nice cinematography though, I remember there being some very nice shots. But yeah, it was just to push some shitty ""save the rivers! people are evil!"" agenda. Dam removal has to be assessed on a case by case basis, yeah, some dams block salmon, that's an issue. But not all dams damage the ecosystem. some old dams are left in place because they actually created or helped an ecosystem that couldn't have existed without the dam.   if someone wants to watch it, I suggest you go in very skeptical, and do some research after, or before the fact. This piece was very charged with a clear goal and ideology. Like I said, it wasn't so much about conveying facts as about conveying a way to think about dams, and its just wrong for a documentary to do that."

InfrastructurePorn,2x16jm,eleitl,15,Wed Feb 25 09:52:55 2015 UTC,"Not ""the same,"" no.  ""A lot of the same.""  It has to be a self-contained, mostly-prefabricated structure that is built to withstand harsh, inhumanly cold temperatures and support a crew for extended periods of time in an extremely remote location.  They don't need their own air supply, and resupply is easier, but it is relatively similar."
InfrastructurePorn,2x16jm,rzNicad,-1,Wed Feb 25 11:11:49 2015 UTC,"self-contained   The Antarctic stations have supply chains you wouldn't believe. They're the opposite of self-contained.  You can't have that supply chain on Mars.   most-prefabricated   You can't bring much material from Earth, so you have to do ISRU. ISRU in absence of people. Not at all a problem for Antarctica, huge problem for Mars. Ever tried to remotely control something with 10-40 min varying latency?   harsh   No wind drag nor snow, but radiation, dust and vacuum. Way more ""harsh"", by which meaning engineering on an entirely different scale, with entirely different problem space.   inhumanly cold   The least of your worries on Mars, frankly.  The difference is that the rocket equation and the transport delay require ISRU for sustained presence. You have to make almost everything locally (breathables, water, food, structural material), under half solar flux and effective vacuum. Bootstrap needs to be done by largely autonomous automation that is very compact, due to relativistic latency and expense of transport.  In other words, it is nothing at all like an Antarctic station, and convincing yourself it is guarantees failure."

As for why, there's a lot of stuff we know about the region but there's huge amounts we don't, including details of things we sort of know. The British Antarctic Survey in particular is looking at:   past climate (last few million years, giving long term behaviours), current climate (including relatively short-term behaviours of how wind and ice and ocean and different layers of atmosphere interact),  ecology (including how easy or difficult it is to screw it up, which impacts commercial fishing rather a lot),  ice-sheet behaviour in particular (this is a big part of the uncertainty in current short-term climate models),  oceanography (the poles have a major effect on how currents and heat/salinity/dissolved gases flow through the entire ocean, which affects basically everything on the planet to some extent), and  some stuff on long-term geophysical/environmental change mechanisms."

Horizontally left to right you can see Enneüs Heeremabrug (cut off the picture for the most part) connecting IJburg to Zeeburgereiland, also carrying the light rail, to Piet Heintunnel which connects to mainland Amsterdam towards the city center.     The horizontal curved highway goes over the Zeeburgerbrug viaduct and immediately connects to the Zeeburgertunnel (already posted before) towards Amsterdam-Noord. ""Landelijk Noord"" as it's sometimes called (Rural North). This road is the A10 Ringroad circumnavigating Amsterdam.  The Curvy road coming from the upper right going to the lower right was the old fast route to Amsterdam-Noord, now a local route. It uses the Amsterdamsebrug (named after Amsterdam, which is possible because it is built just over the Amsterdam border on another municipality's territory) to cross the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal and the Schellingwouderbrug across the IJ Bay next to the Oranjesluizen (""Orange Sluices""), which locks (literally) Amsterdam and the IJ Bay away from the IJ Lake, which flows into  Markermeer, then into the Wadden Sea and then into the North Sea."

InfrastructurePorn,2wgh6k,MeEvilBob,15,Fri Feb 20 05:37:44 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:   The longest single-belt international conveyor runs from Meghalaya in India to a cement factory at Chhatak Bangladesh.[5][6][7] It is about 17 km long and conveys limestone and shale at 960 tons/hour, from the quarry in India to the cement factory (7 km long in India and 10 km long in Bangladesh). The conveyor was engineered by AUMUND France and Larsen & Toubro. The conveyor is actuated by three synchronized drive units for a total power of about 1.8 MW supplied by ABB (two drives at the head end in Bangladesh and one drive at the tail end in India). The conveyor belt was manufactured in 300-meter lengths on the Indian side and 500-meter lengths on the Bangladesh side, and was installed on-site by NILOS India. The idlers, or rollers, of the system are unique[citation needed] in that they are designed to accommodate both horizontal and vertical curves along the terrain. Dedicated vehicles were designed for the maintenance of the conveyor, which is always at a minimum height of 5 metres (16 ft) above the ground to avoid being flooded during monsoon periods.   I found more information in a google book, explaining the maintenance is done by an overhead trolley (which explains the size of the bridges), but there are two vehicles and crews so they do not need to cross the border."

InfrastructurePorn,2wgh6k,Wouter10123,8,Fri Feb 20 02:09:31 2015 UTC,You mean like the hills? It follows the terrain. Imagine how much more material it would take to go straight across from hill top to hill top.
InfrastructurePorn,2wgh6k,LMac8806,10,Thu Feb 19 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"The up front material cost would be higher.....but it seems to me that the energy cost of moving limestone up and down hill constantly, would eventually surpass the higher construction cost to make it relatively flat."
InfrastructurePorn,2wgh6k,notTomHanx,11,Thu Feb 19 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"Well depending on the design the energy expending in pulling the stone up the hill may be recouped as it pulls the belt with it on the way down.  e: It’s actually the world’s longest conveyor belt with no intermediate drives or transfers. Since it’s one long belt, down tension balances up tension, plus or minus the difference in elevation between the beginning and end.  There’s likely more friction than there would be in a flat belt, but that’s an acceptable trade."
InfrastructurePorn,2wgh6k,BrowsOfSteel,4,Thu Feb 19 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"Good point. I'm wondering if this is in fact a true conveyor belt. I come from an industry that relies heavily on conveyor belts and descending material was something that was never done. If material went down, it was through a spout. Then again, we didn't move anything 17km either."
InfrastructurePorn,2wgh6k,LMac8806,2,Fri Feb 20 00:59:36 2015 UTC,"It depends. Downhill conveyors are nothing unusual, some even actually generate energy depending on the load. You'd still use chutes to transfer from one conveyor to another."
InfrastructurePorn,2wgh6k,MarcusP2,4,Thu Feb 19 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"The energy cost balances out. If you think about the potential energy, it's only dependent on the final elevation. The difference is mainly in friction on the idlers (rollers) from the extra length.  Possible friction savings would not recoup the massive extra cost of building huge bridges."

InfrastructurePorn,2wgdw7,cracked_mud,2,Thu Feb 19 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, most likely not that much extra. If you look closely, you can see icicles forming under the fans. The ice inhibits air flow, reducing heat transfer and increasing condenser pressure.  Best case, they're looking at maybe 1-1.5"" Hg abs when it first got really cold. Probably closer to 3-4"" under design conditions.  Source: Rankine power plant employee"
InfrastructurePorn,2wgdw7,inqrorken,1 point,Sun Feb 22 15:48:08 2015 UTC,Our combined cycle plants seem to get 10% higher generation during the winter than the summer (a much larger increase than the coal or nuclear units) and it may well be more when it's so incredibly cold as it has been lately. Perhaps it's coming more from the gas turbine than the steam turbine though. Theoretically lower inlet temperature has a huge effect on efficiency.

InfrastructurePorn,2wcffp,lalala41101,24,Thu Feb 19 04:43:36 2015 UTC,"The details from wiki:   The Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel (often referred to simply as the Whittier Tunnel) is a multi-use highway and railroad tunnel that passes under Maynard Mountain. At 13,300 ft (4,100 m), it is the second-longest highway tunnel and longest combined rail and highway tunnel in North America. The tunnel was upgraded to mixed use by the Kiewit Construction Company.[13]  The tunnel is designed with a single highway lane. The floor of the tunnel is constructed of one-thousand, eight-hundred 7.5 feet (2.3 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) texturized concrete panels, with the railroad tracks sunken slightly below the road surface.[14] The interior is exposed rock, and contains several ""safe-houses"", which are small buildings that are used in case of severe earthquakes, vehicle fires, or other emergencies. The tunnel also contains several turnaround spots, which are reserved for disabled vehicles.[7] The tunnel uses a combination of portal fans and reversible jet engines to ensure proper air flow and air quality throughout the tunnel.[15] There are two backup generators to ensure that the computerized traffic controls and ventilation systems in the tunnel continue to function in the event of a power failure.[13] Because eastbound traffic, westbound traffic, and the Alaska Railroad must share the tunnel, rail and road traffic are coordinated by two sophisticated computer-based systems: the Tunnel Control System and the Train Signal System. These systems control the timing of vehicles entering the tunnel, spacing them for safety, and lower railroad gates when a train is approaching.[13] The tunnel's entrance portals are designed in an A-shape, with a large, train-sized ""garage door"", which allows traffic in and out of the tunnel. The entrance portals are designed to withstand the force of an avalanche.[14] The tunnel's eastern terminus is in Whittier.[2][7] The staging areas on either side of the tunnel can accommodate as many as 450 vehicles waiting to pass through.[13]"

All that remains today are the ruins of a few buildings and a ""ghost forest"" of trees that died after salt water inundated their root systems.

InfrastructurePorn,2vz9o7,vln,0,Sun Feb 15 22:03:20 2015 UTC,"Uh, honestly, they don't really do 'intersection redesign' for bicycles in Ireland. They just put in some bike boxes at traffic lights and voila. But since the junction behind the bridge is uncontrolled, those wouldn't even be considered necessary. Unless there's something extraordinary going on in the intersection down below I don't see why they didn't just facilitate bicycles on the bridge.

A little bit of digressing here: Between Frankfurt Flughafen FBf and Frankfurt HBf there's a branch that goes to various places including Basel (CH). This is something I deduced because there's a direct train between Arnhem (NL) and Basel which my dad takes occasionally which takes the Köln-Frankfurt NBS. Also, Frankfurt HBf is a bay station as far as I know (in order to leave any platform, a train must reverse out of it), so trains from Arnhem to Basel would have to go through quite some extra work to leave that station. </digress>"

InfrastructurePorn,2vjjrs,stevekeiretsu,3,Wed Feb 11 15:26:12 2015 UTC,"This photo highlights the unusual ""fourth rail"" mode of electrification used by the tube (you can clearly see there are four rails per 'track')  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_electrification_system#Fourth_rail   The additional rail carries the electrical return that, on third rail and overhead networks, is provided by the running rails. On the London Underground, a top-contact third rail is beside the track, energized at +420 V DC, and a top-contact fourth rail is located centrally between the running rails at −210 V DC, which combine to provide a traction voltage of 630 V DC.   This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem."

""According to NOAH’s in-house developed treatment method, inorganic hazardous waste is mixed with lime and gypsum and transformed into a chemically stable matrix. The stabilized gypsum is deposited below sea level in old limestone craters and thus the wounds after 100 years of mining are being healed.  The industrial plant at Langøya is complying strictly with ISO 9001 and is also certified according to the EU EMAS-system.

InfrastructurePorn,2vf9qu,_adanedhel_,7,Tue Feb 10 17:52:07 2015 UTC,This being a quarry makes me wonder how many of these hazardous wastes have always been on this island but were trapped inside rocks that were mined out?

Not only is the HangPu river one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, these bridges are fundamental to daily life in the city – the Nanpu bridge alone carrying up to 140,000 cars a day. The unique part of the crossing, however, is not the bridge itself – it’s how they manage to get all those cars up to the base of the towers in such a heavily populated area. The solution? Build a 4km long circular junction which climbs up through three loops with on and off ramps in each direction.

InfrastructurePorn,2umsc0,ironn1ck,12,Tue Feb 3 16:51:27 2015 UTC,I feel like it would cause the opposite effect. Lanes merging into each other tends to cause major backup.
InfrastructurePorn,2umsc0,Yotsubato,6,Tue Feb 3 18:09:44 2015 UTC,I assume the second lane only gets used when traffic is backed up on the road you are merging on to. At that point you're already going slow enough that the extra merging shouldn't matter and because of the extra lane there will be more space before a backup affects the source road.
InfrastructurePorn,2umsc0,elfo222,5,Tue Feb 3 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not only the source road, but also the other side of the exit. A backup at the two lane portion would first cause congestion to before the exit splits into its different directions.

InfrastructurePorn,2ukdb1,AngryLips,4,Mon Feb 2 22:11:19 2015 UTC,It's been a while since I went to Ireland (like 10+ years) so this may be outdated but it's still evident here.   Why do Irish roads with shoulders have them so narrow?  There's no way you could change a tyre in that shoulder without having your bum crack shaved by the passing traffic.  Especially the right-most carriageway.
InfrastructurePorn,2ukdb1,JeremyR22,2,Tue Feb 3 02:30:35 2015 UTC,in my expirence in most european countries you don't change your tire on the motorway because the possibility of a tired or no attention paying driver sweering into the shoulders is to high anyway to do any repairs there. You're calling a road service like the ADAC and you get towed very quickly to the next exit where you/they can change it (or to a garage if you want to)
InfrastructurePorn,2ukdb1,FrellPumpkin,2,Tue Feb 3 10:41:06 2015 UTC,"It doesn't even look like you could safely fit a vehicle at all on that shoulder, never mind getting out to change the tire. Are you supposed to just sit there and block traffic when your car breaks down?"
InfrastructurePorn,2ukdb1,ZenKeys88,1 point,Tue Feb 3 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't say it's perfect.

They even built small underpasses for animals so they don't end up on the road.  As for accidents, no. This one time though some bull broke through the fence and caused a lot of trouble.

Seattle could build the entire proposed East Link light rail for the cost of this one small road tunnel. I'm not saying it doesn't make the city better, only that the money could be much more efficiently used somewhere else. Just Google some other road projects and you will see the cost per mile for this one is absolutely ridiculous."
InfrastructurePorn,2u86gp,HistoryMonkey,2,Sat Jan 31 09:10:36 2015 UTC,Boston only wanted to lynch Becthel because they cocked up the project and still got paid. And then the state foisted a bunch of debt on our public transpo corporation in the form of required ancillary projects that were never completed. And also the whole concrete issues and corruption. And the whole work backlog that the Romeny administration left for us because of it.

Capitalism has no solution for mass automation. Eventually it won't just be manual labor jobs that are being taken. Discovery is the most time consuming part of law firms, and in the not too distant future, computers will be able to do that a million times faster than humans. There goes a ton of ""professional"" jobs. Just one example of ""non-poor-people-jobs"" that will be taken away by automation.  With automation and population both increasing exponentially, it's inevitable that we will have more people than jobs available. We need to make a choice as a society whether to say ""fuck those people"" or ""let's help those people."" And ""those people"" will very soon be you, regardless of the job you hold now.  If we continue to automate as we are, the world will have to shift to a more (gasp) socialist style economy. It is the only thing that makes sense when the majority of human manual labor is being made obsolete. And in not too long even much of human intellectual labor will be done by computers.  First they came for the janitors and we said ""fuck 'em."" Then they came for the dock workers and we said ""fuck 'em."" Then they came for the fast food workers and we said ""fuck 'em."" Then they came for the lawyers, and the lawyers objected. But it didn't matter because the robot lawyers were so much better and more logical and defeated the humans in court every time. Then everyone but a few people were immensely poor because our society never changed with the times to take into account that labor isn't needed when everything is automated. Then there is a revolution. Then there is dark times for a while before maybe getting better and learning from our mistakes in the past. But probably not.  That's my timeline for the next 100-300 years. All of this assumes no catastrophes from climate change, which there will be, and will probably make all this computer/robot stuff moot."

It's not as though I'm suggesting that we avoid automation, or even suggesting that automation is inherently bad. But there will be huge effects on human populations, just as asherrd and platinum_peter have indicated. I agree that there will have to be some sort of quasi-socialist or communist strategies employed, but chances are, the solution hasn't been invented yet. One possible outcome to all of this is that the means of production (3D printing and what not) become so ubiquitous that the whole concept of exchanging currency for goods and services goes out the window. I mean if you can print you own (climate disaster proof) shelter, where you can also produce your own nutrients and recycle waste water, print your own clothing, etc, and the machines are smart enough to fix themselves, then we don't really need currency for anything other than, like, vintage vinyl records or some such that can't be digitally replicated.   At any rate, the transition is gonna be, and this is best-case scenario, very, very weird."

InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,OrzBlueFog,48,Mon Jan 26 17:06:28 2015 UTC,Marvelous engineering.
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,soaringrooster,38,Mon Jan 26 17:33:42 2015 UTC,This still has to be insanely more expensive than just building a bridge OVER the lake.

InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,soaringrooster,14,Mon Jan 26 21:51:04 2015 UTC,That's what struck me about the photo. There's virtually no disturbance on the water's surface. It looks photoshopped on.

InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,Kaktu,2,Wed Jan 28 18:04:36 2015 UTC,The main reason is so highway traffic doesn't have to stop for boats.
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,jdmgto,3,Wed Mar 18 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"That would be a very interesting comparison. You'd also have to factor in things such as the local view, this has little to no impact compared to a bridge."
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,bbqroast,0,Mon Mar 16 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"Probably not to much. I'd assume the damn is reclaimed land, so they'd just need to include this as they built it up.  Not easy but easier than building a bridge high enough for tall masts, strong enough for salty ocean winds all on possibly unstable land."
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,MeEvilBob,3,Tue Jan 27 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"As long as the water level doesn't rise just a few feet during a rainy season, then it's a disaster with no escape."
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,Jitte,16,Tue Jan 27 01:46:53 2015 UTC,"Do you really think there is no escape? The engineers probably did not think of anything? They were designing it, someone asked ""what if the lake overflows?"" and all the people involved raised their shoulders?"
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,Gallig3r,3,Mon Jan 26 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"Well I agree, it was probably designed for a flood level that would occur statistically every 50 or 100 years or whatever safety factor they deemed was worth it.  It's still interesting to consider what would happen when it floods more than what it was designed for.  Probably anticlimactic though,  the hole fills with water until the flood level lowers enough that the pumps can drain it I'm guessing."
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,HumboldtBlue,7,Tue Jan 27 08:04:24 2015 UTC,"I think there stands a pretty good chance that's exactly what happened.   Dieter looked at Klaus, Klaus looked at Petr and Gerd sighed, shrugged his shoulders and said ""let's hope no one dies in any flooding known to happen on this notorious flood plain and that the underpass isn't inundated with water during minor and regular flooding.""  And then they all went out for a beer and salted fish and made fun of Dieter, who is a real dork sometimes."

If you're in a car and suddenly thousands of gallons of water start pouring down in there, on most cars as soon as the water level reaches the air intake the engine won't run anymore, and escape doesn't look very likely as far as I can tell just by looking at this photo.  I'm sure there's warning systems to prevent people from using the roadway at all if the water gets above a certain height, but if this is a major travel route then that would just make more of a case to build a bridge rather than this thing.  It looks interesting, I'll give them that, but I highly highly doubt this was the only option they had."
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,aforsythe,36,Tue Jan 27 15:05:26 2015 UTC,Something like this is both awesome and scary.  Is there any way there could be a rise in the water to spill over into the roadway?
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,ubertalldude,18,Tue Jan 27 08:14:54 2015 UTC,There would be incredible water management systems in effect to prevent the water level from rising significantly. A few large reservoirs could control it well enough.   The only place where this would be a really significant concern if this body of water was connected to the ocean.

InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,T-Altmeyer,6,Mon Jan 26 20:44:17 2015 UTC,It's a dam to keep the sea out and the road isn't on top of it.  From the road you can only see water on one side. I guess it would be more interesting to drive over if you could see water on both sides.

A situation like this is sort of a hybrid since the roadway has been dug out of the ground, but the top of it under the aqueduct is artificial."

InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,Dilong-paradoxus,26,Tue Jan 27 10:02:14 2015 UTC,"A ship displaces an amount of water with a weight equal to its own weight, so as long as the water level stays the same the weight on the supports will always be the same, ship or no ship.

InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,spinfip,7,Mon Jan 26 17:52:50 2015 UTC,Could it be to not limited the height of boats? But I guess the hull could only go so deep this way .
InfrastructurePorn,2tqizd,Iamthesmartest,3,Mon Jan 26 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"yea, given that the road doesn't appear to go very far under the water, that passage can't be very deep. a small ship with a tall sail would make sense, but a large ship, with any amount of hull would never pass."

InfrastructurePorn,2trwbc,cracked_mud,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:02:00 2015 UTC,"Depends. Roughly, on how far offshore the farm is, as the connection to the mainland is a major, major factor.  Short of that, the additional costs for construction at sea are usually offset completely by stronger and more regular winds, as well as not having to pay (nearly as much) for land usage.  Which is why we have so very little offshore windmills, here: Can't build in the Wadden Sea, still have to lay cables through it. Also, Schleswig-Holstein already covers 100% of its electricity needs with wind, feed-in tariffs have been reduced a lot, there's still a lot of capacity left simply upgrading old mills and NIMBY doesn't really exist onshore, here, either, as it's largely rural citizens and municipalities that own those mills in the first place (in fact, as a big corporation it's neigh impossible to get land rights, here. Why rent your land to those if you've got a cooperative on municipal level that could build a mill).  What we'd need right now is feed-in tariffs for synthesised gas so we don't swamp the whole of Europe with energy on especially windy days. And, of course, those two HVDC lines to Norway, currently under construction: Their hydro dams make for excellent batteries.  Which is going to severely piss off Bremen as they invested a lot in offshore construction. But then, as a Hamburger all I've got to say that Bremen can go fuck itself, even slightly more so than Amsterdam/Den Haag."
InfrastructurePorn,2trwbc,cracked_mud,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"What is the cost of electricity there? Around here onshore wind is usually around $70/MWH, but coal and natural gas are ~$35/MWH so it's a pretty tough sell to get any sort of wind. The numbers I've seen quoted for off-shore wind are usually around $150/MWH which is never going to fly with anyone. It's especially hard because electricity demand is flat so any sort of new generation is hard to build. It's not like they are building new coal either. So long as Natural Gas prices stay at $3/MMBTU nothing can compete."
InfrastructurePorn,2trwbc,cracked_mud,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:01:02 2015 UTC,"142Euro/MWh on average for the currently existing ones, projected to fall to 91-100 by 2023, and further after that.  You're guaranteed 130Euro/MWh for the first twelve years, 20 Euro more per year you've built it before 2016, after your twelve years 35/MWh. Which should be enough for upkeep. There's also provisions to incentivise repowering when sensible.  OTOH, you've got to (at least in theory) pay carbon tax on those fossils, and fossil and nuclear energy has to give way for renewable: Everything the renewables produce is used, it's the classical sources that have to power down (though, of course, nuclear plants don't do that they'd rather pay people to take their electricity when push comes to shove)  That is, yes, given the regulatory framework that stuff can compete: The framework was designed to cause exactly that. There's been instances where operators of gas plants have threatened to shut their plant down because it was only running a couple of hours a day, and subsequently got money from network operators to keep it on standby. Network stability needs them, and will for some time, potentially forever, just that at some point they'd be running with synthesised gas, which is excellent high-capacity long-term storage (though not particularly efficient when you look at the round-trip).  ...and onshore wind is actually 4-11Euro/MWh, which is roughly the coal/gas span. Offshore is a long-term thing, someone has to stem the initial development costs. They're very reliable, though, you could even call them base-load capable in the traditional sense: On the sea, there's a lull maybe one or two days in a year.  The thing is: It's very windy here in Schleswig-Holstein, and we have a fuckton of onshore mills. Yes it's enough for electricity but if we actually want to wean ourselves (and our customers) completely off fossils one day, offshore capacity is needed."

In Denmark, for example, most internal-combustion engine cars are taxed at 180%. That means if a car normally costs $30,000, you pay the 30 grand to the seller, and another 54 grand to the government. So a cheap car ends up being an $84,000 deal, which is why you'd consider buying a bike instead and pretending to embrace the bike culture because, as a middle-income person, it's either that or walking to the bus stop.  The surrounding countries' governments (NL, NO, SE) tax car purchases similarly, although not as high as the Danish."

InfrastructurePorn,2tczse,official4lex,4,Fri Jan 23 10:08:54 2015 UTC,"OK this is a great time for a rant.   When the engineers designed this bridge they didn't realize icicles would form on the cables and drop onto the traffic below in winter. This has caused a few accidents but luckily no injuries. The engineers gathered up and brainstormed a new system that would get rid of the icicles.  Engineer A proposed to install metal wires around the cables and heat them up in winter.  Engineer B proposed to paint the metal cables with hydrophobic materials so ice wouldn't form around them.   Engineer C then thought: ""Wait a minute, why don't we come up with the least hi-tech and the most cumbersome solution, while increasing the bridge's yearly upkeep as much as possible?"" So he proposed to install a giant metal ring on each cable and hire a few guys in winter to drop the rings from top to bottom every few days.  Guess which system they decided to implement? Oh, and they charge you $3 each time you cross it. No joke."

I wonder if hydrophobic paint would really be sufficient to prevent the icicles from forming and how long it would last.

InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,RyanSmith,4,Thu Jan 22 18:51:53 2015 UTC,Definitely infrastructure gore.  This bridge is so badly under provisioned that crossing during rush hour can take 40 minutes or more. It's been this way for decades.  There are no plans to upgrade the bridge because the cities on both sides don't want their cities to be open to people who live on the other side.
InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,vacant-cranium,2,Thu Jan 22 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"And if that bridge is closed for whatever reason, your only other options are to go up Hastings (which is crazy in Rush Hour) to the Second Narrows, which is the freeway and is also always crazy in Rush hour.  You could also take the Seabus, if you aren't driving."
InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,ecnepsnai,2,Thu Jan 22 23:39:50 2015 UTC,Is the road in the bridge not really horizontal? (it seems it has a bump in the middle). Would that be a problem?
InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,protestor,2,Thu Jan 22 22:00:50 2015 UTC,It has a gentle hump in the middle as most bridges do.  The lens the photographer used is distorting things somewhat I suspect.
InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,PhotoJim99,2,Thu Jan 22 22:37:29 2015 UTC,I've seen the bridge from the same perspective as in the photo. The hump isn't exaggerated much from what it looks like to the naked eye.
InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,vacant-cranium,2,Thu Jan 22 23:11:25 2015 UTC,Its called cambering. Its a slight upwards curve of the deck. A lot of bridges are cambered to minimize deflection under load.
InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,d-boom,2,Fri Jan 23 01:38:07 2015 UTC,So it gets straighter under load? Interesting.
InfrastructurePorn,2tbcl0,protestor,2,Fri Jan 23 01:43:17 2015 UTC,"Essentially yes. If you were to start with a level bridge and apply load it would sag downwards. With cambering it either becomes level or sags downward less, depending on the design.   ETA: Suspension bridges like the Lions Gate are quite flexible compared to other bridge designs. Which is part of the reason the why the camber is so noticeable."

InfrastructurePorn,2t6xh1,green_griffon,6,Thu Jan 22 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"And depending on who you ask, it's either a blessing or a curse.  The windward side didn't really get built up until the H-3 was completed.  I used to live in Kailua.  It would take at least an hour to take the Pali highway or the Likelike to get to work in Pearl Harbor.  The H-3 makes the trip 30 minutes tops, and that's accounting for the shitty base traffic on the Kam.  You also can take the Kam around the coast, but thats looking at 2 hours at rush hour.  So it brought more traffic to the windward side.  Which is great for people who want to live there, but sucks for the people that want to keep it more rural like the old days."

Any trip longer than a 30 minute drive is really far these days.  I remember when an hour drive was nothing I couldn't handle, but If I'm driving for an hour these days, it better be a day trip."

InfrastructurePorn,2sxy50,nusmesa,19,Mon Jan 19 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"I've been subscribed to this sub for ages but it only occurred to me just now that I could post a lot of content from Pakistan here. Contrary to what people believe, some of our infrastructure is world class. 2nd largest dam in the world, fastest growing and largest motorway system in the region, more dams, excellent BRT infrastructure, World's largest man-made irrigation canal system etc. I should post here more often."
InfrastructurePorn,2sxy50,irishjihad,10,Mon Jan 19 17:43:16 2015 UTC,I'd love to see more.  It's always great to see how engineers solve problems in other countries.  Every one is just a bit different from the next.  Even just the subtle differences between the U.S. and Canada fascinate me.
InfrastructurePorn,2sxy50,DogeSaint-Germain,4,Mon Jan 19 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"Look up Neelum-Jhelum Dam, Diamer-Bhasha Dam and the Karakoram Highway. All three are projects are located in the treacherous Himalayan-Karakoram belt and pose huge logistical challenges. Other than that, we've begun building highways in the Himalayas (Murree expressway, Hasanabdal Expressway), BRT and metro tracks through some densely populated areas (Rawalpindi-Islamabad MetroBus, Lahore Metro-Bus). Some really cool airports and Motorways are also under construction. Then there's this plan to redevelop some remote mangrove islands on the Arabian sea into developed residential and commercial towns/cities. I'll be posting photographs from some of them here from time to time. Dams especially are sometimes stunning since they're so massive."
InfrastructurePorn,2sxy50,DogeSaint-Germain,0,Mon Jan 19 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"The dam was built by the money we were handed to give up the Ravi and the Sutlaj, the canal system was built by the English and the motorway system is useless compared to the needs of the population."
InfrastructurePorn,2sxy50,ChokeZero,4,Mon Jan 19 19:18:09 2015 UTC,"The dam was built by the money we were handed to give up Ravi and Sutlej.   Umm..alright.   Canal system was built by the English?   Some older one's, yes. However we have built our own canals since. Example: The 500km long Kacchi canal project thay runs through Southern Punjab and East Balochistan.   The motorway system is useless compared to the needs of the population.   The motorway has actually helped benefit trade and commerce in the country. The NHA has reimbursed itself from the cost it took to build the M1 and M2 in five years through toll tax and renting out commercial spaces on rest-stops. They're now utilizing those funds to expand the M3, M4, M12 and connect Karachi to the rest of the motorway, advertently connecting 80% of the country's major cities to the motorway network. Small cities will benefit from the trade and commercial activity this will bring. I mean yes, there are other issues that need addressing in Pakistan. But calling it 'useless' is farfetched. The M2 has been vital in the economic boom Islamabad has begun experiencing recently."

They just feel very different. Metro tunnel stations definitely feel like they are interior spaces, while the transit tunnel feels like it's an enclosed, but nevertheless fundamentally outside space. It probably has quite a bit to do with fundamentally just being an underground four lane road with wide sidewalks, instead of a definite ""platform"" design of Metro."

InfrastructurePorn,2s6g9q,LupineChemist,2,Mon Jan 12 23:01:50 2015 UTC,So why do the two carriageways cross over each other? Looking at the google maps the highway starts off with both carriageways the correct side of each other. But then they split before they enter a mountainous area and they cross over each other swapping sides. The carriageways ways then join back up and cross over each other again as they leave the mountainous area.
InfrastructurePorn,2s6g9q,oh_no_aliens,6,Tue Jan 13 10:21:09 2015 UTC,"The carriageways were built in different moments. When inaugurated in 1974, there was only one carriageway. The other one (that goes below in the picture) is from 2002. My guess is that they crossover multiple times for topography reasons. Keeping them parallel would probably mean longer and higher viaducts for the new road.   There might also be some environmental reasons, since the legislation governing those issues is far more strict now than it was back in the 70s (the highway is in the middle of the Atlantic Forest, a now well protected ecosystem). Even with the highway above the trees, there is some environment degradation, specially during construction."
InfrastructurePorn,2s6g9q,confluencer,2,Tue Jan 13 13:05:42 2015 UTC,It was also mentioned that the tunneled section would make sense to be the downhill section as it vastly reduces the amount of exhaust required from the tunnel itself as vehicles traveling uphill will have much more emissions.

Given that the line was built to a maximum gradient of 7%, the best you could do is to take off 210m of track. The viaduct alone is 110m, and makes up less than half the spiral, so I dare say they don't have any room to drop any quicker. You can see the gradient continues past the viaduct in various photos, and keeps going through Brusio itself. The gradient beyond Brusio continues to be impressive!

InfrastructurePorn,2s44fm,BigDuse,3,Mon Jan 12 07:28:57 2015 UTC,"Freeway is a road classification and is not impacted by name.  Freeways use on/off ramps exclusively, and no traffic can cross a freeway except by going over or under the surface.  A freeway is always a highway (another road classification that is often used in the name ""Highway B"" for example), but a highway may not be a freeway.  Going through a city on a freeway, you will likely see a sign saying something like ""Freeway ends in 1 mile"" after leaving the more densely populated areas.  About a mile from that sign, you will see another road or driveway with a level crossing on the highway.  I get where you are coming from, but there is no reason to use a definition other than the one used by the DOT.  A freeway section is very likely to be the busiest point of the highway."

The GTA has a population of about 6 million and a huge chunk of the jobs are all in one location downtown.  Edit: Forgot to mention construction. It's non-stop. The other east-west highway which runs on the far south end of the city is the Gardiner/QEW and it's FUBARed by construction all the time too. You can't widen the Gardiner/QEW and construction wreaks havoc so the 401 gets even more slammed.  http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=e16c775f7d773410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD  http://kokul.ca/2013/04/thoughts-about-torontos-hwy-401-traffic-problem/
InfrastructurePorn,2s44fm,MultiPurposeHat,3,Mon Jan 12 04:29:04 2015 UTC,"its only the one stretch of the road that is the ""busiest"", which is between Weston road and the 400. That one stretch handles roughly 450,000 cars a day. The least busy parts of the 401 near Montreal are in the 25,000 cars a day range, which is very far from ""busy"". Mind you the road is also well over 800km long..  It is that busy as there are a ton of jobs along the highway. Everyone uses it to get to work if they work in suburban Toronto.  All the other highways in the city also act as a sort of spur off of the 401, so if you want to go anywhere in the city you are using the highway. The 407 is an alternative, but it is a tolled highway so a lot of people avoid it.  Most people who work downtown take transit, and the 401 is a bypass (very old one that now runs through the middle of the city), so it doesn't even go downtown. The two highways leading into downtown aren't nearly as busy.  The 407 does not restrict the construction of new highways, they are planning a new bypass to the north of Brampton. It's too far away to have too much of an effect on the 401 though.  Public transit in Toronto is also very well used, it's behind only New York and Montreal in terms of percentage of people people who take transit."
InfrastructurePorn,2s44fm,WalterSochek,1 point,Mon Jan 12 04:44:57 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that the main problem with the 407 isn't that we aren't allowed to build others, it's just that the 407 already occupies a decent enough arterial route and it's wasted. Building another highway from Vaughn to Milton (through Brampton) would never be necessary if the 407 was public and used to capacity."
InfrastructurePorn,2s44fm,innsertnamehere,0,Mon Jan 12 04:57:18 2015 UTC,"We have a similar problem in Vancouver. They built a couple new bridges and tolled them, now most people take the old un-tolled bridges."
InfrastructurePorn,2s44fm,pretty_jimmy,1 point,Mon Jan 12 11:45:38 2015 UTC,"Other people have addressed the geographic/demographic factors, but I think one of the issues is that traffic actually moves along it.  Remember, the ""business"" metric being used here is cars per day past a particular point.  Which works out to lanes x speed / spacing.  If it's a parking lot, speed goes to 0 and so does ""business."""

InfrastructurePorn,2s42jw,thedurka,3,Mon Jan 12 06:11:00 2015 UTC,Why did they not paint it international orange with reflectors?   International orange does not comply with visibility requirements under the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,smashedsaturn,2,Sun Jan 11 22:28:30 2015 UTC,I remember riding it when the bridges were only one lane in each direction. The way passing semi trucks would pull/push your car made you fear for your life.
InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,Holmespump,16,Sun Jan 11 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to why they opted for a hybrid bridge-tunnel over just one or the other. My immediate assumption is because of length, but there are some pretty long bridges and tunnels out there."
InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,APP6A,47,Sun Jan 11 05:04:00 2015 UTC,"The Bay includes multiple major naval bases, they wanted to ensure the channel could never be blocked from above."
InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,RadagastWiz,21,Sun Jan 11 05:27:16 2015 UTC,This is the right answer. Enemies can destroy bridges to block water channels. You can destroy a tunnel but it won't block ships. That's also why the rest of Norfolk has so many tunnels instead of bridges.
InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,realjd,8,Sun Jan 11 05:29:38 2015 UTC,"What would happen if a ship somehow blocked the gap, either because of a mechanical failure or because of an attack? Do you think the gap between the bridge segments is wide enough to accommodate passing ships?"

InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,zenstic,8,Sun Jan 11 17:23:29 2015 UTC,"There are two tunnels, and both are wide enough for ships to pass through at the same time, so it'd take some serious coincidence or engineering to completely block everything up."
InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,vanisaac,3,Sun Jan 11 11:17:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Each tunnel is a little over a mile long.  I can't bring up any nautical charts here at work, but I'd venture to say that each navigation channel is approximately 1000 feet wide.  You would pretty much have to sink a carrier, or something larger than panamax, directly in the center of the channel, across the channel, to block it up."
InfrastructurePorn,2s0zv1,just_an_ordinary_guy,12,Sun Jan 11 17:59:29 2015 UTC,Probably shipping.

Yes and that's the big problem that Birmingham has - when people think of Birmingham they think of concrete, Brutalist buildings and motorways. In the 50's, 60's and 70's the city was redeveloped with lots of concrete buildings surrounded by ringroads.  This video gives a good idea of what the city's architecture was like in the 70's   It's starting to shake off the image, with lots of the 60's buildings being replaced or rebuilt.  New Street Station will soon look like this  The Bullring is now a modern shopping centre  Other buildings like the old Central TV studios which have lay derelict for years are going along with the library and surrounding buildings.  One bit of classic brutalist architecture, the New Street Signal Box is however now listed meaning that it's protected from demolition or major changes"

InfrastructurePorn,2ryrig,ReadsSmallTextWrong,6,Sat Jan 10 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"It needs some but isolated examples like the signal box. I think the problem though is that a lot of the brutalist or concrete buildings are big multi-use centres and have either been neglected or not aged well meaning that it ended up with large run down shabby areas.  Even now, with the likes of the Bullring, Brindly Place, the new library and along the canals behind The Mailbox all being new pleasant areas it still suffers because they're all seperated by horrible aging buildings, underpasses and flyovers"

He would be pulled to his left (the middle of the picture) and the man in the middle would fall over (and down). The reason he is supported is because the force of his weight is being supported partially by the men's arms and then on to the bricks via the rope. The remainder of the weight is being supported by the bars to the chair. The bars are being pushed (compression) while the arms are being pulled (tension).  Think about the force exerted on each member of the structure.  The same thing is occurs in the bridge, some of the components are in tension while others are under compression.

The pool of water behind the tide is so massive that allowing it to flow upriver could not possibly lower its level. Thus, blocking the water from flowing into the estuary only allows the level to reach its peak sooner, not to reach a higher peak."

InfrastructurePorn,2res0b,Zernhelt,2,Tue Jan 6 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I never thought of that.   It would be exceedingly difficult to retrofit many of the BTS stations with elevators. I mean the BTS is sort of a retro-fit itself... a mass transit system built over the existing road system. In some spots there's actually an elevated highway over the BTS which is over the streets.  But just the other day I saw some new concrete poured to turn half a stairway into a ramp, and starting to see more wheelchair accessible bathrooms around BKK. So things are improving, it just takes time.  While Thailand's economy is growing rapidly and they are making efforts to turn Bangkok into the next Tokyo, with the endless protests some of these issues unfortunately don't get the attention needed. But it looks like it is getting some attention now, so with how rapidly things are changing you might see elevators in ever BTS station in a few years. But they're probably focussing more on putting ramps in the shopping centers around the BTS first, as making the BTS wheelchair accessible doesn't accomplish much if as soon as you exit the BTS you're face with a bunch of stairs. And the sidewalks are really shit in Bangkok, so that needs to be improved.  TL;DR They are doing some work on making BKK wheelchair accessible now, but there's a huge amount of work that needs to be done it will take some time."

It's pretty complicated inside; feels a bit like walking around in an enormous airport or something. It took me about a year to really figure out how to get around, but it can hard to describe to somebody how to get somewhere.  Sometimes you have to go double the distance, but being in a (usually) heated skyway is totally worth the extra walk."
InfrastructurePorn,2r8s9d,Andewz111,43,Sun Jan 4 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"When I used it a bit while visiting the city a couple of summers ago, I kept having this feeling of ""am I allowed in here?""  So many parts of it just don't feel...""public"" I guess?"

Lights are not all on in some places, there are dead ends in buildings which seem private...  But that is one of the greatest partd about the skyway - unless there is a locked door, its open to anyone.   If you are into art, the disolays in the building lobbies are amazing.  If you are into architecture, you can finds great examples of a wide range of eras and styles.  And if your an electrical nerd like myself... Welll, lets just say you won't be disappointed.

InfrastructurePorn,2r8s9d,Bunnymancer,7,Sun Jan 4 04:47:13 2015 UTC,My coworker is wheelchair bound so we have to avoid anywhere with stairs (those little elevators are ridiculous).
InfrastructurePorn,2r8s9d,Valendr0s,5,Sun Jan 4 04:56:10 2015 UTC,How clean is it? And how do they deal with people on wheels?
InfrastructurePorn,2r8s9d,Bunnymancer,18,Sun Jan 4 07:01:40 2015 UTC,"'On wheels' is somewhat vague. If you mean segways or something, then I don't think I've ever seen one in the skyway.  But if you mean people in wheelchairs and such, then it's usually very good. The only problem is that there are a handful bridges or inter-building connections that have stairs. I go to lunch and coffee with a guy from work who's in a wheelchair, so I probably notice more than most the frustrations.  Some are more inconvenient than others. ""IDS"" and ""Baker"" buildings are very well used hubs. To go anywhere from the southeast to the north west, you usually have to go through them. Same with ""Northstar"".  But between the Baker Building and the IDS tower there's stairs. And inside the NorthStar building there's stairs. Also in McGladrey, from the IDS connection there's stairs & an escalator. Aaaanddd... hmm... Capella to North Star is sort of the same as McGladrey. Inside One Financial there's stairs but they have an accessible ramp that works very well (why don't they others just do this?)  So say you want to get to Target (west) from Centre Village (southeast)...   Street: ~6 blocks. Skyway w/ stairs: ~6 blocks (though with all the turns and twists, your total steps will be closer to walking 8-10). Centre Village > Accenture > Ameriprise > Baker > IDS > Macy's > US Bankcorp > Target Skyway avoiding stairs: 11 blocks (and with all the turns and twists, more like 14-16). Centre Village > Accenture > Ameriprise > Capella > US Bank Plaza > One Financial > North Star > Wells Fargo > IDS > Macy's > US Bankcorp > Target.   At least they finally put in the Accenture > Ameriprise connection. Going through Thrivent to the Government center looks like a short detour, but while you're walking it, it certainly doesn't feel that way.  All the stairs technically have a little elevator, but they're dreadfully slow, poorly maintained, and most of them make you use the call button before you can use them. Also, according to my buddy, fantastically loud inside when they're in use. In the long-run, they're probably a wash in terms of time, but the hassle is well worth just avoiding them.  Most of the skyways have doors between buildings. It's probably 50/50 between automatic sliding doors and physical doors. Most of the physical doors have accessible buttons, but some open so slowly that it's hardly an improvement, especially in the mad rush at lunch.  Though touching 50 public door handles at lunch never feels good >_< - it has to be a big source of flu spreading in the cities.    You also asked about cleanliness. Most of them are very clean. Basically imagine 30 malls (though there actually is a mall in there too). They want to stay clean for their shops. Some of the skyways themselves aren't heated very well (I'm looking at you Plymouth > Lumber exchange - same with Energy Center), but the buildings are usually fine.  Some of the older buildings just feel like older buildings (Foshay, Lumber Exchange, etc). But they're kept as clean as can be expected.  I will say that I'm very sensitive to smells and I never smell anything strange. Now that may be because the whole thing acts as a cafeteria to hungry office workers so it's filled with all sorts of food smells all the time, but if it reeked of urine or something I'd certainly notice.  There are bums that sort of hang out (they mostly keep walking). But I've never seen one cause any problems. And other than the Government Center, I VERY rarely see any kind of panhandling or even solicitation. I assume it's because the government center building & skyways are treated as more public property where the other buildings and skyways are private so they can evict panhandlers.  IDS has a little atrium in the middle of its skyway with a bunch of benches, and the homeless do tend to hang out down there, especially outside of work hours. But, let's be honest, it's -20 degrees out there, where would one expect them to go? And I've never in my 5 years down there seen anybody causing fights or any other kind of disturbance.    One little side-note: There's a few places that have a very noticeable breeze 24/7. For example between Campbell Mithun and Foshay. There is a quite strong breeze for the entire length, always going from Foshay to Cambell.  We sometimes joke that it would be interesting on one summer day to open all the doors and windows in all the buildings just to see the kinds of strange weather patterns that would appear.  The strangest things I notice are... It's 50 separate buildings each with their own style. Some of the older ones weren't built for the skyway, and are, indeed, 4 separate buildings in the single block. So their 2nd floors are sort of cobbled together to work (hence the stairs inside the buildings). As as a result, they're terribly inefficient in terms of getting you from point A to B.  But they've all either been built or retrofitted to treat the skyway like their main floor. All the main elevators go from 2 to the other floors and have an escalator and little service elevator between the parking levels, ground, and skyway. It's strange when you first see it, but it quickly becomes completely normal that the 2nd floor is the default 'lobby' level."

InfrastructurePorn,2r8s9d,bwcajohn,3,Sun Jan 4 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"Well the reason Toronto summers are so unbearable is because of the humidity and little breeze.

I'll ignore your insult.
InfrastructurePorn,2qncdm,vln,8,Sun Dec 28 23:49:49 2014 UTC,"I live here and take the tube regularly, although not every day.  I don't find it ""soul crushing"" to walk down these tunnels, although I'm not going to make any great claim the other way, I don't usually find it enormously uplifting and inspiring either.  Whenever and to whatever extent I do dislike the experience it is because of the overcrowding or occasional annoying behaviour of other users, not due to the architecture.  Personally I agree that it would be much nicer if these type of spaces were not 'polluted' with ads.   From an aesthetic point of view - and even more boldly and controversially, from a social point of view.  On the other hand, I don't live in an economy of my own dreams, in the economy of reality the ads bring in a lot of money I wouldn't like to compensate with fare increases!  At that point it's a complicated far-reaching discussion.  So, setting that aside and concentrating on the architectural experience, I think this one is overall quite... neutral.  I am interested in what you would think would make such infrastructure less 'awful'.  You probably can't do much about the shape, in any realistic cost/engineering scenario.  More decoration and use of colour on the surfaces perhaps?  The tube does have plenty of tunnels like that:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/jb_1984/9574024238 https://www.flickr.com/photos/25842521@N08/3964098238 https://www.flickr.com/photos/scotch_egg/2429782474    But they are mostly older.  I believe the OP tunnel is amongst the newest on the network, and in our current 'age of austerity' it appears no expense has been, er, spent on the decorative side of this tunnel lining.  I would agree that this a shame.  Although I don't think it's quite as depressing as you do, it could be prettier."

InfrastructurePorn,2qncdm,Bsq,1 point,Mon Dec 29 00:51:43 2014 UTC,"I was just surprised to see it here. Putting the issue of ads aside (I agree with you) I do perfectly agree it is very hard to make a tunnel pretty. And to be perfectly honest I have no clue how to make one more attractive. Maybe start with some color ?  But really you saw this tunnel, and you though it's infrastructurePorn worthy. And that I don't understand as it is the opposite for me. For me it's not even interesting, as in ""it's ugly but interresting"". It's just so banal. It's a grey tunnel with ads. Why show it here (real question, sorry if I appear aggressive, language barrier) ?   Maybe to show people who live where there are no tubes that we can indeed create monotonous boring tunnels ?  Also, maybe I just hate subways."

And to tl;dr that, in a way, the idea that it is ""just so banal""? -- I totally agree, and that was sort of the point :)  It's so bland that 99% of people would walk down it without considering it, but I watch documentaries about crossrail cosntruction and stuff, and when see these shotcrete tunnels being built and realise actually, they still required some cool engineering.  So I shouldn't take them for granted.  You know?  It's not super pretty, but not all engineering/infrastructure is, so I like to mix up submissions from the visually spectacular to the more mundane.  If you prefer submissions that are more in the former category, that's a fair opinion.  Also, I think you probably just hate subways.  ;)  On the other hand, I tend to find any tunnel like this, even the most boring ones, a teeny bit science fiction and cool, for reasons I can't explain!"

InfrastructurePorn,2qguwb,blaireau69,1 point,Sat Dec 27 20:49:23 2014 UTC,"Lane changes, overtaking, things approaching in the rear mirror are what you care about on the Autobahn. First thing to keep in mind: Never assume you're the fastest. From your fellow drivers, hope for the best (and act like that) but expect the worst. You don't just hog the left lane, even if you're cruising at 300km/h. The curves are indeed trivial (at speeds standard tires survive), but important to prevent tunnel vision.  It's one of the safest highway systems in the world. Part of it is of course upkeep, both of the streets, cars (regular checkups!) and driver training, but a fuckton of it is because people respect that street so much.  Americans chide their kids for not having proper trigger discipline with their water pistols, Germans chide their kids for not having proper Autobahn focus on their bobby cars. Well not really but you get the drift."

InfrastructurePorn,2q6p35,adrianb,6,Tue Dec 23 19:29:07 2014 UTC,"There is no third rail, it's just trams going by. They use a catenary wire.

InfrastructurePorn,2q6p35,ChromeLynx,2,Tue Dec 23 20:09:05 2014 UTC,"There appears to be a fence between the tracks, so the top rail of the fence might be what you're mistaking for a third rail.  It also appears that the tracks were made with poured concrete and the running rails appear to be elevated on slabs.  since you can't see the closer running rail because of the platform, the outer rail appears to be elevated above where the rails would be for a subway line.  In reality the running rail heads are likely level with the platform."

InfrastructurePorn,2q6p35,tragedyofthecomments,3,Wed Dec 24 15:46:53 2014 UTC,It does indeed look more like a metro or a commuter train station. Here in Helsinki trams aren't separated from other traffic to that extent. Tracks here are either right next to or on regular streets.
InfrastructurePorn,2q6p35,Cespur,3,Tue Dec 23 19:45:18 2014 UTC,You're not far off. The original plan called for a metro line but it was built as a tram line on an oversized right-of-way.  There's also a tunnel which instead became a chocolate museum. Because chocolate.

It's not uncommon (though it's getting rarer) to see a local RER or TER train in France that's tagged, but usually not TGVs. Swiss trains, meanwhile, are rarely tagged.

Construction quality is a major focus point on any offshore project, and especially so for one that pioneers new technology. As large as this vessel is it still represents an extreme miniaturization of the natural gas liquefaction process. As a result, all of the equipment spacing guidelines used for an onshore facility are unpractical. This concentration of process equipment magnifies the potential consequences of most releases, and is controversial among many Shell investors and environmentalists."

InfrastructurePorn,2pltc2,dethb0y,5,Thu Dec 18 01:22:18 2014 UTC,"From this article:    To exploit the Prelude gas field more than 100 miles off the northwest coast of Australia, Shell has opted to bypass the step of bringing the gas ashore, instead developing a system which will do the job of liquefaction at sea.  In Shell's view, this means avoiding the costly tasks of building a pipeline to the Australian coast and of constructing an LNG facility that might face a long series of planning battles, and require a host of new infrastructure on a remote coastline.   tl;dr: supporting an on-shore refinery's a pain in the ass, especially with environuts freaking out every time you damage a dandelion.

Also, a two lane road through a park is not ""major"" bus traffic. And yes I'm not denying that if you got hit by a car immediately after you jumped onto the road that you would easily die.

This concrete colossus had stemmed the natural flow of the Colorado River, desecrating the steep gorges of the magnificent Glen Canyon that Abbey imagined grander than all the cathedrals in Europe. Gone forever in the dam's building were groves of cottonwood and thickets of tamarisk, wolves' dens and eagles' nests, natural sandstone spires and ancient archeological sites. In their place--man-made Lake Powell, a reservoir with a 1,800-mile shoreline that Abbey dubbed ""the blue death."" Glen Canyon Dam was a pork barrel project ostensibly built to provide Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix with affordable electric power; in fact, it was an engineering abomination that destroyed an entire ecosystem. Even the dam's conservative sponsor--Arizona Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater--would eventually admit that its construction had been a terrible mistake.

InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,LockAndCode,4,Fri Dec 12 10:04:53 2014 UTC,"Well, yeah, something like that. It's easier if you consider the ground as a giant current sink rather than as a literal return path. Power is generated relative to a certain reference potential, and for convenience that's usually the ground, because it's available anywhere there's planet surface, and it maintains that same reference potential everywhere."

InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,keithb,4,Fri Dec 12 13:23:09 2014 UTC,"You don't. Your domestic power is AC, the current shuffles backwards and forwards 50 or 60 times a second in and out of your gear, which is why every item you connect to the mains has two wires, often (and somewhat misleadingly) called ""live"" and ""neutral"". The ""neutral"" line might be connected to earth at some point, but doesn't need to be. There may be a third ""earth"" wire for protection.   But these undersea power connections are usually (and this one is) DC, so the current goes one way all the way. The Earth is so big that you can push pretty much any practical amount of current into it and pull any practical amount of current out of it and it does not change its potential noticeably."
InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,protestor,2,Fri Dec 12 16:25:13 2014 UTC,"But does the current literally flow back through the ground? I would imagine that the actual path would be quite complicated and that ""returning"" through the ground, although predicted by the theory, doesn't literally happen.  Like collecting water in the Pacific and dropping it the Atlantic -- in some sense there is an ""oceanic"" return through Themohaline circulation, but the water you dropped in the Atlantic most probably will go somewhere else."
InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,keithb,3,Fri Dec 12 16:34:54 2014 UTC,"The current absolutely, the charge carriers (in so far as they have any sort of identity) no."
InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,protestor,2,Fri Dec 12 19:09:27 2014 UTC,"Yes halfway through writing this I figured I was confusing the water with the water current.  But it's still odd to think that the current actually returns. Would it simply not work if both sides weren't grounded? What would happen if the current didn't return through the ground - would charges accumulate on one side (since it's DC) lowering the voltage across the endpoints, lowering the current flow? What kinds of failure this charge buildup would cause?"

InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,westdonkeykong,2,Sat Dec 13 00:40:48 2014 UTC,"Still ground. You'll notice often on farms and rural areas where there are overhead distribution lines, there is only one conductor ran atop a wooden pole. Your neutral path is still ground.   In the transmission world, below every substation is a ground grid, and they are connected via ground through this ground grid. You'll see transmission lines with three wires, one for each phase, and typically a shield wire. This shield wire is to protect against lightning strikes and may also contain fiber for communication assisted protection schemes."

Then, the farmers report strange occurrences (livestock refusing to drink, usually) and then the power company shells out for the second conductor.  What's happening? The earth return causes ""high"" voltage (actually 5-7 V) in the area - like in watering troughs. The second conductor - the neutral - now provides a return path better than the ground, so poor Bessie doesn't get a shock while drinking."

If you used a fence with metal poles in the ground and just put the wire directly on the metal with none of those small plastic/porcelain holders, then you would not get electrocuted by touching the fence because it's grounded already by touching the metal poles? Is that how it works?"

InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,ivix,3,Fri Dec 12 10:10:05 2014 UTC,Yes
InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,westdonkeykong,2,Fri Dec 12 11:54:22 2014 UTC,"Ah, this is misleading. I wouldn't put a definitive yes.   Step and touch potential could kill you.   TL:DR: Under the right conditions, touching an energized fence could kill you.   Let's say, and this is really pushing it, you're hanging outside of a high voltage substation, touching the fence. The deadend insulator breaks and the line falls, coming in contact with that fence. You've got a line to ground fault at voltages above 80kV. (More or less depending on where you are.) Now that fault current has two paths to ground. Directly through the fence. And through your hand and body to ground. So, we have a parallel circuit with high resistance (you) and low resistance (the grounded fence). Now you need to make some assumptions. We have to assume that the fence structure is grounded properly to the grid. This resistance could be 0.05 ohms. Then the resistance of the human body can be wildly different. (Don't touch that fence when you're sweaty.) We'll say 5000 ohms of resistance from you to ground. Finally, we'll assume that the substation is close to the source, so the line resistance is only 5 ohms. Total fault current is 15,841 amps. Voltage across you is 792V. Current flowing through you is 158mA. Your heart stops at between 50-100mA.   Those aren't bad conditions. What if you're sweaty and not wearing rubber sole boots? Less resistance, more current to flow through you. What if the fence is not actually grounded very well? That'll lead to higher resistance on the fence, and more current flowing through you. If the line is shorter, there's even more fault current, and thus higher voltage across you, leading to higher current through you. All of which of course can be turned around to say, what if the line is longer, the fence is grounded properly, it's a dry day and I'm wearing nice new boots.   Still, the answer is not a definitive yes.   Edit: To add to this, line protection relays would see this fault and trip the line breakers. Hopefully quickly, but some scenarios could be time delayed: If there is line differential protection you'll have an instantaneous trip (say 50ms with breaker and relay contact operate times.) If the line remains connected to the substation that you are near AND there is an accelerated tripping scheme (PUTT), both line breakers will open instantaneously under a Zone 1 fault. However, if that line were completely disconnected from the substation you are touching, it's protective relays would see no current on a phase (no fault) and you'd be relying on the remote end relay to operate on a Zone 2 fault. This is time delayed, usually 350ms plus relay and breaker operate time. So 400ms of heart stopping current, probably not a very good thing."
InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,protestor,1 point,Fri Dec 12 13:34:20 2014 UTC,"I will suppose that if you were wearing protective boots, your actual resistance to the group will be much higher than 5k Ohms? (I mean, I can buy resistors of 5M Ohms, and they aren't that huge). Or is the voltage so large that there will be effectively a dielectric breakdown of the boots?  But, suppose I have such boots (and I suppose that certified boots won't have trouble insulating you), and touch the fence with both hands. Since the fence has such small resistance, the voltage across my arms will be very small, and even though the current passes through the heart it won't be on the order of hundreds of mA. But there will be a spike when I touch; would it be big enough to cause damages?"
InfrastructurePorn,2p1tso,jmottram08,2,Fri Dec 12 12:30:23 2014 UTC,"Essentially what would happen is the metal poles would be getting electrocuted.  If you touched them, you may or may not get shocked, depending on whether your connection to the ground is less restive than the pole.  Which is doubtful."

InfrastructurePorn,2oni9b,SubcommanderMarcos,5,Mon Dec 8 19:18:29 2014 UTC,"This looks to be a coal storage facility capable of unloading and reloading train cars.  The cars would unload by dumping their cargo through through the rectangular holes visible amongst the tracks.  From there the long conveyor belts would lift the coal and drop it on the top of the storage pile. Loading coal back on the train is done via the four tipples, where a conveyor raises the coal and the drops it into the train car from above.  All the loading and unloading is done by gravity and machines so requires much less human muscle than older operations."

Seventy-nine workers plunged 30 metres (100 ft) into the water. Eighteen were killed either instantly or shortly thereafter, possibly drowned by their heavy tool belts. A diver searching for bodies drowned later, bringing the total fatalities for the collapse to 19. In a subsequent Royal Commission inquiry, the bridge collapse was attributed to miscalculation by bridge engineers. A temporary arm, holding the fifth anchor span, was deemed too light to bear the weight.[2]"

InfrastructurePorn,2o9rsc,vanisaac,6,Fri Dec 5 00:08:32 2014 UTC,Arches are a very common dam design - they bolster against the weight of water on their back side with a minimum of material.
InfrastructurePorn,2o9rsc,BananApocalypse,2,Fri Dec 5 01:13:40 2014 UTC,"I should have been more specific. Why is there only one, and in that particular location?"
InfrastructurePorn,2o9rsc,vanisaac,5,Fri Dec 5 01:21:24 2014 UTC,"This picture is too high to see, but it looks like there's a bit of a canyon down there. The rest of the dam surface is just holding back the very top levels of the lake, so it doesn't need much more than some little reinforcing arms. That's really the only place that needs any serious architecture to hold back the pressure of the water, and an arch design is a lot easier to integrate than a gravity dam."
InfrastructurePorn,2o9rsc,BananApocalypse,3,Fri Dec 5 01:26:08 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that makes sense!  More depth, more pressure, more resisting force required."

InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,ssstar,6,Wed Dec 3 11:16:43 2014 UTC,how does a government create new tunnels? do they just dig under the city and carry all the excess dirt out?
InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,randomtask,10,Wed Dec 3 16:39:35 2014 UTC,"Most new subway tunnels under densely populated cities are built using a tunnel boring machine. However, since this is a box shape it was probably constructed using the cut and cover method under a street. This means you dig a pit, haul the dirt out, cover over the pit with road decking (usually temporary), build the tracks/infrastructure/station, and install a permanent cover. The wiki article on tunnels describes this in more detail."
InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,sessurea,5,Wed Dec 3 17:10:42 2014 UTC,Actually most of the tunnels (especially for the express trains) are round so it was probably at least partly built with a boring machine.  The reason it is box-shaped is because this is a station. It was the last stop for about 3 years before it was connected to a line going and coming from Yokohama and they left this part of the future tracks partly covered and accessible to the public as a treat as can be seen here.

InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,Lothar_Ecklord,16,Wed Dec 3 16:40:55 2014 UTC,"Dammit, NYC.  Just as packed in as Tokyo.  Nowhere near as aggressive with subway planning."
InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,randomtask,21,Wed Dec 3 16:24:42 2014 UTC,"I think it all comes down to maintenance. NYC neglected their system for decades, so now they are pouring money into maintenance of existing lines instead of major expansions. Tokyo never really lapsed so they get to fund expansions without worrying about anything else."
InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,Lothar_Ecklord,22,Wed Dec 3 17:01:17 2014 UTC,"I like to use this as a reference.  And you are correct, they have neglected it for decades, and now we are paying for it.  No new lines since 1950.  The 2nd ave line will probably be at capacity, the day it opens and the 7 line extension won't be super convenient unless they continue to WTC (Think of the transfer(s) to get from 34th and 11th to Brooklyn or even downtown at all).  Just my speculation anyway."
InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,hak8or,14,Wed Dec 3 17:24:40 2014 UTC,"Not to mention the NYC mass transit system runs all the time, 24/7. It never shuts down except during emergencies like 9/11, strong storms, or really nasty weather. Heck, the NYC subway has 450+ stations, Tokyo's subway has a meager 142 stations.   The official count of stations is 468; however, this tabulation classifies some transfer stations as two or more stations, which are called ""station complexes"" within the nomenclature of the New York City Subway. If station complexes are counted as one station each, the number of stations is 421   http://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_New_York_City_Subway_stations   There are a total of 142 “unique” stations (i.e., counting stations served by multiple lines only once) on the Tokyo Metro network, or 179 total stations if each station on each line counts as one station.   http://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Tokyo_Metro_stations"
InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,muckstew,6,Wed Dec 3 19:07:04 2014 UTC,"To be fair, the Tokyo subway consists of not just Tokyo Metro, but also Toei, which has 99 “unique” stations of its own – though some of those interchange with Metro stations."

InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,ToMetric,2,Thu Dec 4 10:22:32 2014 UTC,"Well.. That's where I gets a little tricky, and depends on how you define it. My neighborhood in the Bronx has close to 70,000 people and it is only a square mile, which is pretty typical in the Bronx and parts of Manhattan too. That's dense! Like... India or Thailand dense. However, the Bronx is about 25% parkland, plus there are neighborhoods that are primarily single-family houses, so the density goes way down. But, there are also Queens and Staten Island and Brooklyn which have significant suburban areas and parkland.  The urban areas of New York are extremely dense, but the average is offset.  Then there is Tokyo. This is where it gets really tricky. Firstly because there are many definitions of Tokyo. Tokyo Prefecture is the equivalent of a state or a province. There is no ""city of Tokyo"" anymore, as it was dissolved in the 60's and divided into 23 ""special wards"", which function as individual municipalities, but are closely tied together.  So, are we looking at the massive sprawl that is Tokyo Metro, the extremely varied Tokyo Prefecture or the former Tokyo city limits... Also, not saying this region doesn't have its fair share of parks, but it isn't exactly known for its green space. Also, due to earthquakes, Tokyo has no office or residential space taller than 1000 feet - which, New York is adding more and more of every year. Tokyo also has less ""high-rise buildings"". On the other side, Tokyo (former city limits) contains significantly less single family residences.  Officially, Tokyo Metro is listed as 37,501 people per square mile, or 14,485/km square; NYC comes in at 27,779 people per square mile or 10,725/km square. New York City has 8.4 million in 468.9 sq.mi. (789km2); Tokyo 23 special wards is 9.0 million people in 240.1 sq.mi. (622 km2). Also note, the numbers are based on total area, not land area. NYC has almost 170 sq.mi. of water (35% is water!).  To make a very long explanation short, technically no. But it depends on how you measure/consider it. The ""super-urban"" areas on land are closely matched, but NYC has nowhere near the (dense) sprawl."

InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,fukuragi,9,Wed Dec 3 19:56:08 2014 UTC,Less dangerous for trackworkers Greater separation between power components allows for looser construction tolerances
InfrastructurePorn,2o590e,The_Svele_Guy,10,Wed Dec 3 20:04:32 2014 UTC,IIRC overhead wires don't require insulation so the cost per mile is cheaper than third rail. There is also less gaps in the overhead wire.   It can also be harder for a person to get electrocuted by a wire 20ft in the air.

The core of Seattle is all hills, which makes it hard to build. In ~1903, hoses and steam shovels were used to tear down Denny Hill at the north edge of downtown. The dirt and stone was used to fill in the vast mudflats south of downtown, creating Harbor Island and the industrial area to the top-right of the photo.  Not all the landholders on the hill were willing to be relocated, but the digging continued around them. Their buildings were left stranded atop columns of earth up to 100 feet tall, nicknamed ""spite mounds"", until they relented and their buildings were moved or demolished.   The ghosts get their revenge though: the filled-in mudflats are like jello everytime we have an earthquake, and the worst structural damage in a shake is usually there."

When I first traveled to Germany and got to drive on the autobahn, my favorite experience was seeing the ""no more speed limit"" sign and immediately flooring it. Felt really awesome to do something seemingly so wrong back home and it be sanctioned by an actual official sign.  The sign in question: http://i.imgur.com/lWWXWvA.png  Incidentally I told this story to a friend of mine and for my birthday this year he got me one of these signs. It was up there for the coolest gift ever, partly because I didn't even remember having told him the story years ago."
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,FourSquash,6,Tue Dec 2 12:20:10 2014 UTC,Even as a german using the Autobahn at least once or twice a week seeing this sign is a huge pleasure.
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,Negativbeispiel,3,Tue Dec 2 15:40:50 2014 UTC,I would get such shitty gas mileage if I lived in Germany and commuted through parts of the Autobahn with no speed limits.
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,EpikYummeh,2,Tue Dec 2 17:55:08 2014 UTC,That sure is my biggest problem too. Consuming around 16 litres/100 km. (4.22 gallons/62.1 miles) is no rarity.
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,Negativbeispiel,1 point,Tue Dec 2 22:40:41 2014 UTC,14.7 mpg? That's just a little less than what my RX-8 gets in street driving!
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,EpikYummeh,1 point,Wed Dec 3 01:15:48 2014 UTC,That's REALLY bad for most European cars. I get like 4.8 L / 100km  (49 mpg US) on the highway and I usually cruise at around 130 km/hr. Like 6 in the city (39 mpg).  I have a not particularly efficient model of a not particularly small diesel hatchback.
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,LupineChemist,1 point,Thu Dec 4 16:04:57 2014 UTC,Well... 1. I'm in the US. 2. Gas/petrol is its drink of choice 3. Rotary engines are known to get lower mileage than traditional piston engines 4. It's too much fun to drive to drive like a grandma. 5. I drive about 30 miles on the highway once a week
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,EpikYummeh,2,Thu Dec 4 17:16:51 2014 UTC,For quite awhile now. It's just not all of it has speed limits.
InfrastructurePorn,2o0yqp,ERIFNOMI,-1,Tue Dec 2 17:41:01 2014 UTC,Meh

InfrastructurePorn,2o1i3h,LupineChemist,1 point,Thu Dec 4 13:03:14 2014 UTC,I used to work there!   Joliet 6 across the river is a really crazy building. It was basically cheaper over the years to just decomission parts and build additions than demolish and remove so there is all kinds of equipment from decades ago just mothballed on the other side. You can seriously go there and get lost and there are practically no operators wandering around that part except for a little break room they set up so it's like something out of a horror movie.  It's also really cool to watch the coal train be unloaded.

InfrastructurePorn,2nxpeq,mkvgtired,1 point,Tue Dec 2 02:19:59 2014 UTC,I get the feeling there is a lot of zoom used here to make you think the mountains are a lot closer than they really are.
InfrastructurePorn,2nxpeq,Tesseractyl,1 point,Tue Dec 2 01:34:00 2014 UTC,This is 4km above sea level and the mountains are very big.
