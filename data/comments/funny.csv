funny,3e1kht,Our-Year,11,Tue Jul 21 13:40:26 2015 UTC,"*Hand fucking. The movie is based on the true story of Aron Ralston, who got his arm caught between two boulders when he slipped while exploring a remote canyon. After 127 hours of being stuck, with no water and no rescue in sight (no one know where he was), he used his dull pocketknife to amputate his hand/lower arm so that he could get out. It's actually a great movie."
funny,3e1kht,mamacrocker,7,Tue Jul 21 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"Great movie of an incredible (in the ""holy fuck!"" sense) experience. I think someone asked in some interview why he didn't do it sooner, his answer was in that situation you don't want to believe it, you keep hoping rescue will come or you'd find a way to make the rock budge. Only when he was desperate and delirious from dehydration did he do it, and apparently the dehydration helped too, his blood was so thick it meant he didn't bleed to death."

This means the email arrived before the business day even started. I got a response the next day saying I was basically shit out of luck because the ""order had been processed"". The items were shipped like 3 days later. For some fucking bullshit reason, it's apparently impossible to stop a processed order which won't be acted upon for several days. It's like saying ""sorry, there is no way we can stop ourselves from sending you some stuff since there are only several days to do so"".

The question is not whether they can stop an order, but whether they will invest the time (and other resources) it takes to stop/change an order.
