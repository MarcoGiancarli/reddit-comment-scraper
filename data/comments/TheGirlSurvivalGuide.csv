TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e3j1k,bonusblend,5,Tue Jul 21 19:22:50 2015 UTC,This app is hilarious! Also it's good for removing pimples for that perfect selfie.

It won't help you on the haircuts, though :( If you have a photo of the haircut you want to try, but on somebody else, the app Superimpose is the best thing ever.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e50kk,0knikki0,2,Wed Jul 22 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"I can help! I just got a DivaCup a few weeks ago and have also been doing dry runs and had the exact same problem. The first time I did it in the shower which was a horrible idea - I got super dizzy, had it ""flattening"" like you describe, it just wouldn't open up. I was so dizzy I just had to finish my shower and lay down. A few hours later, after a TON of research, when I was more relaxed (watching some That 70's Show) I tried again while laying down which was a lot less stressful. One of the tips I read online was, instead of pushing on the cup with your finger like the company says, push on the back wall of your vagina instead to let some air into the cup. It totally worked! I felt and heard the air rush in which was kind of weird and it seems to open all the way now. I initially thought my vagina was just so tight that the cup wouldn't open but I've realized that it was just because there isn't any way for air to get into the cup without my help. I am also slightly more able rotate it after doing this as well. I haven't actually had my period yet so I can't be sure if it's suctioned properly, but it feels like it is. And it's definitely better than having it as flat as a pancake :P  Good luck, let me know if this doesn't work!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e50kk,extraphilestrial,2,Wed Jul 22 01:28:52 2015 UTC,"Twinsies! :)  I just tried it a couple minutes ago. And I actually think it might have worked. I layed on my bed, tried a couple breathing exercises for good measure, shoved it on in, pushed my back wall, and when I felt around the cup it seemed to be much more open and rounded! I didn't hear/ feel any air rush in or anything like you did though. I didn't try laying down before because I read that it makes it more difficult before. But hey, it seems like it worked. Guess I'll find out if it did in a couple days. Thank you, kind stranger. :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e50kk,extraphilestrial,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yay!!! Glad to help :) Yeah I didn't know you're not supposed to lie down until afterwards, I won't do it again but it helped me to figure it out. I did another dry run while sitting down and the pushing on the back wall thing worked again. I'll probably try doing it while standing before I get my period to make sure I can do it in the shower.   Oh also I forgot to mention, I was having trouble getting fingers in like you, so the next time I tried using lube and it helped IMMENSELY. I know the company says not to, but tons of people online use the same one I did with no ill effect (coconut oil btw)"

The half diamond fold is my bestie."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e4ara,SuperiorCoconut,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"As you said, you had intercourse last a couple weeks ago, so that's worth checking out with a doctor, seriously. If it was one/two weeks or less it's just a bundle of cells that die off, but at several weeks it's a different story. It's possible that's what it is, which in a perverse way is a good thing, as it means 1. You're fertile and healthy, and 2. You're not dying!!!

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e328k,Dargobt,4,Tue Jul 21 16:52:11 2015 UTC,"Your body needs time to fight the infection.  And you can pass it to your sexy time partner, who might not show symptoms, and they can pass it back to you.  Wait to have sex."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e328k,where_it_began,6,Tue Jul 21 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"It has never worked for me. If you can, ask a doctor to prescribe you Diflucan/ Fluconazole. I can call into my gynecologist's office and they will prescribe it over the phone for me. It's usually around $5 for me and it is a total life saver. It usually clears everything up within 24 hours. Best thing in the world."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e328k,thesongsinmyhead,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:38 2015 UTC,Upvoting this one. My OBGYN pretty much said OTC treatments aren't really effective. Plus with the Diflucan/flucanozole it's just a pill and it works super fast. The only time I've had to use a vag cream was for BV. That's actually an antibiotic so you have to use it til it's done and no alcohol. Def no sex on that one.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e10cb,enraged_ohmu,33,Tue Jul 21 03:10:30 2015 UTC,"This has happened to me. The best thing you can do is not talk to him for awhile. Give yourself time to get over him. Otherwise you're gonna keep having thoughts about getting back together when you talk to him. Give yourself some space, meet other guys, and try to keep your distance so you can build a new support network. Seriously--prioritize making strong friendships. Enjoy your hobbies and do what you love. Teach yourself to enjoy those things without him.   My friend is currently in a similar situation. They ended bc of distance, but they're in the same city this summer so they hang out all the time. He is her best friend but honestly I think it makes it worse for her because of the lingering hope that they'll get back together. She's prolonging her feelings and it's just gonna make it harder.  It'll take a lot of discipline, but it's worth it in the end. Relationships end for a reason."

My (ex) BF works crazy hours 6-7 days a week right now, and just can't make the relationship work. We were best friends before we started dating, and are still trying to be friends. I miss him. I think I miss his dog more. We still get along. I loved his family. They loved me. I'm afraid he is going to find someone else. I'm more scared of finding someone else for myself. I don't want to quit loving him. Ever.  I'm not sure I have any words of advice. But I know exactly what you are going through. I'm just focusing on myself. I'm trying to improve myself so that if we ever get together, I can be the best version of myself as possible. I crochet, so I'm making an afghan for him. Maybe I'll give it to him for Xmas. Maybe I'll never give it to him. But each stitch is an expression of my love, and it helps me to cope. We also went fishing a lot together, so I'm painting a sunset at our favorite fishing spot."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e10cb,619shepard,3,Wed Jul 22 00:51:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely go no-contact. I honestly don't really believe in being ""just-friends"" with someone you were intimate/in love with. At least not at first. Be mature about it and try not to go out of character because you will wish you hadn't when you think back on it. Take time to mourn because you truly have lost something in your life. Take as long as you need and never feel guilty about it. Wish him the best (whether its to him physically, or just in your head) and move on. Invest your time in your family and friends. This is a great opportunity to strengthen some amazing relationships that you may have neglected due to your ex-boyfriend. Most importantly, invest your time in yourself. Join the gym, or a group, or a book club, or your towns volunteer first aid squad and fill your time with these things. This is the best time to find your passions.Try not to look for someone/something to blame (it was his fault, it was my fault, maybe if I did this, etc..). Sometimes, the timing is just not right, and maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Write your favorite quotes down everywhere, on sticky notes maybe and put them on your walls, in your car. My favorites were: ""Your mind is a garden, your thoughts are the seeds, you can grow flowers, or you can grow weeds."" ""Plant your own garden and decorate our own soul instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers."" Best of luck OP, keep your face to the sun. It doesn't happen overnight but one day you will wake up and it will be a little bit easier to breathe."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e10cb,thevicker,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:57 2015 UTC,"I have gone through this exact same thing, very recently. I met this guy, moved away, we tried long distance, and it was extremely difficult despite us caring for each other. He broke it off, and I was really happy in a lot of ways because I needed to work on some things on my own and so did he. I have been gone since September, and we both knew that we would be in the same city come August. We broke it off in the beginning of April, didn't have any contact at all with each other, and just used the time to reflect and work on ourselves. Figure some things out on our own. Then, by the end of May, I started missing him SO much. I reached out to him just to tell him I missed him, and he reciprocated the feelings. We started off just talking once every 2-3 weeks and now we're back to everyday. Us taking that time apart was the best thing that could've happened to us; even though we're still long distance for another month, our relationship is in great condition and we were able to better ourselves for each other.  So, point being, take this time to find yourself. I suggest cutting off contact, because it will be too difficult if you have him to fall back on. Force yourself to grow a little independent from him. If you get back together come January, you'll both be the better for it. If it isn't meant to me, you'll already be moved on and you'll be happy either way. I am also a very closed off person and it kind of forced me to find comfort in other people and it strengthened my friendships and allowed me to further experience the new city I'm living in.   It was really difficult, and I felt a lot of negative feelings, but it also came with a lot of positive feelings and forced me to improve on some basic things. View the breakup as a positive thing, even though you're sad. You'll either be happy you broke up and moved on, or happy you found yourself to have a better relationship in the future."

I understand it's hard to write someone off completely but you should definitely try to turn him back into just a friend. Keep it casual. Talk to him for 10 minutes every other day.

However, I'm not sure I would put a cap on how often he stays as long as you are there, too. It sounds like your friend has some ongoing issues in her marriage and personal life, but I would also be sort of pissed if some guy I didn't really know very well was always hanging out in my space that I pay rent for. If she was okay with it then it would be fine, but she is bothered. Maybe when you leave your boyfriend could take your dog over to his place to hang out?  I wouldn't touch her marital problems with a ten foot pole, that's totally her business and she is only going to be prickly if you try and talk with her about it. In that regard, just give her support as she is your friend, and discuss it with her if she brings it up. Otherwise you are just asking for trouble! If her relationship with her husband is making your home life difficult, though, then perhaps talking about her/his actions affect your happiness might be in order."

I've had the rest of the sets for years and they are still going strong - even though they are 100% white. I'm very glad I spent the extra as I've not needed to replace them at all.  (In the UK by the way.)
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e1jke,NurseAngela,3,Tue Jul 21 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"Do you sew at all? This duvet cover from sheets was a super easy project I did a few years ago and ended up being WAY cheaper than the duvet sets I was looking for even with super soft pretty sheets. I kept it simple and just did one color on each side so it would be reversible, but patterned sheets would look nice too."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e1jke,omgblvd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:10 2015 UTC,That is such a cool idea! I can kind of sew but I don't think I'd be able to pull that off.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,fridgemenow,43,Mon Jul 20 11:10:41 2015 UTC,"This was me 15 years ago. People think since you're thin is OK to make comments about your weight, but it isn't ok to make comments if you were obese.  I was ashamed of my body. I wrote baggy clothes to hide my scrawny arms and to try to deter comments. But I was pretty much constant told ""if the wind picks up, you'll blow away!"", ""if you turn sideways you'll disappear!"", ""eat a sandwich!"", or my personal favorite was that you can never complain about being cold because you would get told ""put some meat on your bones! If you had more insulation (like me) you wouldn't be so cold"".  I didn't start to gain weight until about my mid twenties, and I actually gained quite a bit in my late twenties when I went through a divorce. I've shed about 15 pounds off but am still about 20 pounds heavier than I was at my thinnest, and I think I look great (despite a slightly flabby belly, but I digress). I no longer look like skeletor.  The most important thing is to be true to yourself. Don't change because of others' influence. If you're getting comments then tell them to stop. You could always go to the doctor for a physical and if you're told you're healthy that should be good enough for your parents to stop giving you ""the look"".  Comments about someone's weight are inappropriate, no matter the size."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,rvtjess,12,Mon Jul 20 11:39:39 2015 UTC,"That's great that you're happy with your figure now :-) And why does society think it's okay to rudely call someone a skeleton to their face, but they refrain from saying anything mean to those who are overweight?  And oh yes, my parents are always telling me to eat more so I'm not as cold in the winters haha."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,rvtjess,6,Mon Jul 20 12:56:30 2015 UTC,"Another frustration is that I'm a vet tech. We have a scale up front for dogs that I'll occasionally use to weigh myself. It frustrates me to no end when coworkers will see me and comment about how I shouldn't worry about my weight because I'm ""so thin"".  Or my favorite when I mentioned watching my calories I was told that I shouldn't have to worry about dieting (note: I wasn't attempting to diet, just trying to get a general idea of how many calories I consumed in a day).  Look. You can be a twig and be unhealthy! You can be overweight and be healthy! Weight is not an accurate assessment of health!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,chantelrey,-5,Mon Jul 20 20:30:47 2015 UTC,"As much as I agree with your post, I have to disagree with the ""overweight and healthy"". Being overweight is inherently unhealthy.  I hate to nitpick but I really dislike when people say that because it just isn't true."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,rvtjess,7,Tue Jul 21 06:21:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not taking about being morbidly obese, I'm talking about society's view of being overweight. In many cases, they are healthy."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,rvtjess,2,Mon Jul 20 19:54:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not sorry. If we hadn't divorced, I'd be stuck in a shitty situation and wouldn't be with the man of my dreams now. :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,Helen_Damnation,66,Mon Jul 20 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"I used to get this all the time. I was 5'5"" and weighed roughly 105-110lbs. I don't have that issue anymore as I'm 39 and am on meds that made me gain weight (but I like it).  I used to respond with, ""Well you could lose a few. See? Hurts when people comment on your body."" or ""I didn't ask your opinion and you sure as hell don't want mine."" I was asked a few times if I was anorexic like it was perfectly acceptable to ask someone that and I responded with, ""I don't know, do you eat a dozen donuts because you feel sad inside?""  I know they sound nasty but frankly they're being nasty and sometimes they need to hear what it sounds like. The people I've said this to may have been offended but they kept their opinions to themselves after that and I couldn't care less what they were thinking as long as they kept their mouth shut."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,TwoTonTuTu,17,Mon Jul 20 12:29:25 2015 UTC,I want to snap back at people and stand up for myself so badly sometimes. But so often the comments come from family members. I can't get myself to be rude to them even if they've been rude to me.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,Helen_Damnation,47,Mon Jul 20 13:00:12 2015 UTC,"I think that is something you will learn to do as you get older. You could try saying,  ""It really hurts my feelings when you make comments about my body. It is rude to talk about how a person looks.  Up until now, I have been too polite to say anything,  but if you continue,  I am going to start telling you what I think about your body."" And see if that does not get them to back off."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,TwoTonTuTu,10,Mon Jul 20 13:09:50 2015 UTC,This is much more tactful than mine. At that point I had reached a boiling over point from so many years of hearing this that I didn't give a rat's ass about offending anyone.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,Helen_Damnation,7,Mon Jul 20 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"I completely understand. But, it is hard when you are raised to be a good little girl, who is never to say anything rude or disrespectful. Being raised to always think of how other people feel before your self.  Raised to keep quiet and not complain and never taught how to communicate your feelings. ""Children should be seen and not heard"" and all of that.  I have been fighting to learn how to combat how I was raised,  and to actually stand up for myself without the fear that I will be the one doing wrong for being disrespectful.   It is hard to change that.  I am doing better but I still take too much abuse before standing up for myself.    I still have trouble knowing that it is ok to call someone else out on their bad behavior. So I spend way to long trying to think of the best way to word something so I don't hurt any ones feelings,  even when no one considers my feelings."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,TwoTonTuTu,3,Mon Jul 20 15:09:25 2015 UTC,I can appreciate that. I was brought up Catholic by a Marine that treated our childhood like boot camp. It takes a lot of work and I commend you for it.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,Love_Trust_Hope,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:16 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I did not have it quite in that category, but I understand.  It is very interesting how much being raised in that manner affects your adult interactions. I am working on confidence and approaching people about an issue before I get angry about it. I try so very hard not to say the wrong thing or hurt any ones feelings that often I just don't say anything at all.   Actually,  online gaming has helped me tremendously.  When you are a woman and talk over a  mic, it makes you a target for all kinds of criticism and just general nasty comments.  I am getting rather good at telling people to pound sand. :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,amphetamine709,37,Tue Jul 21 11:27:54 2015 UTC,"I'm overweight. My best friend is a size zero-double zero. I NEVER knew this was hurtful to say to her until one day she sat me down and told me how it affected her. She started off by asking me if I ever had heard her speak about my weight. I said no, and then she said how would you feel if I told you I thought you needed to lose weight? And I got really uncomfortable, and said if she real ly thought I was becoming unhealthy.... and she cut me off and said no, this had nothing to do with that. But then she said ""If I can't tell you to lose weight without hurting your feelings, why do you think you can tell me to gain it?"" We had a long talk about her feelings, and how I had been hurting her without realizing it, because to me she has a perfect body. And now, we both tell people who comment on her weight that it's hurtful."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,rxbin,8,Mon Jul 20 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"This is what I have gotten my whole life.  It's rude, and hurtful and annoying!  People don't understand because we are just ""lucky that we are skinny"".  I love that i am smaller, but i don't like when people point out that im a stick.  Who thinks a stick is a good body shape?!  I have gotten better about my body image and having a boyfriend who loves me and my body the way it is has helped me so much.  I was teased in elementary school and called anorexic and bulimic, and it hurts because people don't believe you when you say you are not.  People think you are lucky to eat whatever you want and not gain weight.  I do like that, but that stuff is just as bad for my body as it is for other peoples.  Being skinny means you can't sit on people's laps because you have a bony butt.  That sucked.  I just don't understand why people can't see that it can be so hurtful and have such an impression on the way you see yourself. and all these songs lately that talk about ""skinny b*tches"" droves me crazy."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,tinnie75,5,Mon Jul 20 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"Oh man, are you me? I have exactly the same issues. It's annoying as fuck when people comment about it. My mom's friend even went as far as asking me in a serious tone if I suffered from annorexia. Are you serious? You don't even know me.  I've learned to just snap back at them. Tell them they wouldn't point that someone's that fat - why would it be okay to point out that someone's skinny?!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,chantelrey,7,Mon Jul 20 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"I can relate to you in many ways. I'm really short (150cm) but also quite skinny. Especially in the upper part of my body. My arms are so thin I look sick, but my legs and butt are a bit bigger than I would want. And I don't really know what to do about it. I'm not happy when people comment on my skinny arms and small shoulders. I know I have no real muscles there, but I'm afraid that whatever I do, it's only gonna make the situation worse. I've tried searching the internet on how to gain weight in that part of the body, but all I found was guys looking for ways to get big arm muscles.  I guess we just have to deal with the fact, that sometimes we can't change the way our body looks. And we shouldn't have to. But I wish I was able to say something to the people who have stupid comments.  It doesn't bother me too much, but it's not nice when they comment on those things (and in my case mostly how short I am) in not exactly positive way."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,chickenliddle,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:50 2015 UTC,"Hey friend.  I just wanted to say that I went through the exact same thing. Or maybe I just want to join in the venting because I am still dealing with the consequences of this. For my entire childhood/adolescence, I was SEVERELY underweight. When I was in high school, I was 5'5"" and 80-90 pounds.  You probably know just as well as me that it's not just a body image or appearance issue. It affects everything. School was absolute hell. For years, everyone thought I was weird, but I didn't know why. When I was in fifth grade, someone called me anorexic for the first time, and I was confused because well, to be blunt about it, I'd been taught being skinny was good, and I didn't understand how I could be ""anorexic"" looking if I still ate.  Teachers would always be concerned about me. The lunch monitors in the cafeteria would hover over me making sure I ate every bite of my food. Every year, we had to get weighed by the school nurse, and then they would send a letter home about how I was possibly ill/anorexic/being neglected.  So then, my parents (who were already pretty inconsistent/abusive emotionally) would go through periods of extreme resentment of me. I remember them screaming at me to eat more as I sat at the table, already stuffed. And then they would praise me if I ate more than my fill, probably because they were worried that someone would suspect them of not feeding me unless I put on some pounds. This caused some really fucked-up thinking patterns around food and eating that I'm still trying to make peace with.  Puberty was absolute bullshit because other girls were getting boobs and I was standing in the mirror naked wondering if I was actually a boy (never really totally got the ""different genitalia"" memo). My friends at the time would ""playfully"" make fun of me, and it was incredibly grating on my self esteem but I was too shy to say anything. The first guy I really seriously liked and found a connection with told me he would like me if I was more ""feminine-looking"".  And while I do understand all of the concern about fat phobia and fat-shaming, those fucking ""REAL WOMEN HAVE SOME MEAT ON THEIR BONES"" were extremely toxic to me as a young person. I remember going online and reading things like, ""Why would I want to sleep with a skinny girl? It would feel like having sex with a child!"" And I was so ashamed of myself for the longest time.  The little stuff too, of course. Not being able to find stylish clothes in my size. My friend's parents asking my dad if I was on a diet every time he picked me up from her house. It adds up after a while.  When I got to college, I gained the freshman 30 from beer and maybe a slower metabolism. I finally was ""average,"" what I always wanted, but of course my insane expectations for my body got the best of me and I teetered on the edge of anorexia for months on and off before finally counting calories and starting to reprogram my idea of healthy eating and healthy body image.  Finally affirming for myself the relationship between food consumed snd weight gained really improved the feeling of not being in control no matter how much I stuff myself/starve myself, but the anxiety is still there. It's hard for me to eat around people and if I'm going to an event where food will be served, I feel tense and nervous all day. It's gotten better, but when I read stuff like this I feel compelled to respond because to live this way is absolute shit sometimes.  Sorry if this was a bit too heavy. Maybe this wasn't for you, but for me. Sending you good vibes through the internets."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,KashmirKnitter,2,Tue Jul 21 07:59:41 2015 UTC,O.m.g. puberty was the worst for me too. I remember in 7th grade locker rooms noticing how everyone was starting to fill out their bras and how I was so far from it. I kept wondering what was wrong with me!   And I'm glad you are doing better :-) Keep it up
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,coconutmango,4,Tue Jul 21 11:43:58 2015 UTC,We're in the same boat I'm currently 5'5 105lbs. I am constantly getting looks when I wear leggings or anything form fitting it makes me feel extremely self conscious and then I hide myself in baggy clothes for a couple of months. It got bad when I was pregnant and some people assumed I was anorexic and needed therapy because I was about to bring in a very unhealthy baby into this world. My child was born on term and zero complications. I thought about going to the gym too and the increased calorie intake did make me feel stuffed as well. Try /r/gainit they are very helpful into building up from being skinny. If you need someone to rant to or if you want a weight gaining buddy feel free to PM me :)

I understand the hurt and the pain. Remind yourself that these people are stupid, and you can't hate yourself for the way you are.  I recently became so fed up from the excessive comments from people, I've been starting to work out and gain more muscle tone, hopefully gaining a little more weight in the process :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dxm0c,amaizeing_phd,3,Mon Jul 20 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"Learn to love beer and wine, that totally did it for me! A little too much, actually...  People sometimes say stupid things thinking it's a compliment. I think this is one of those things. If you can't laugh it off and remember that they mean well, then you're gonna have to have a heart to heart about how it makes you feel. But you'll have to have like a million of those, it would be easier to change your reaction than to change everyone else's actions. Not that it's your fault that it hurts your feelings! Totally understandable. But the thing you have the most control over is your perception. Try some mindful meditation exercises, that might help."

People can be stupid. The only thing I would advice is to own it. Take ownership of, well, whoever it is that you are. When someone says something about the wind blowing you away, reply with a comment about your dreams of being a kite. When they say something about your skinny arms, say something about how handy they are for reaching under the coach. Add something slightly hurtful if appropriate, like like finding their lost sandwich under there. Try to find a way to turn it around, not to be mean but to highlight the stupidity or to express pride in what they criticise. Be yourself and take pride in that. It may seem a bit forced at first but people will respond to your humor and self pride. You can't change them, only your response to them. Try to have fun with it.  Big hugs, my skinny sister!"

I think that finding other ladies (and dudes) with similar experiences has helped.  The only opinion about my weight that I cared about was my doctor's who realized when I hit puberty that nothing was going to change with my weight, so he stopped mentioning it. My mom would make comments about how ""she could feel my ribs"" when she hugged me in college. Something I knew wasn't true because I neither gained nor lost weight when I went to school.   I can tell you that I'm the same age as you and recently started to gain weight (specifically about 10lbs in six months) which put me at a more ""normal"" weight. So maybe your time is coming?  I don't want to say that you will definitely gain weight and can put it all behind you. What I can say is that it's possible you will fill out eventually and until then just do you. As long as you're happy and healthy there's no reason that someone else's opinion of your weight should matter."

So I know how you feel. But it's to the point that I just don't make comments about myself to others anymore since I'll get passive responses that my feelings aren't justified and being skinny is what everyone wants. It's not skinny that I want, it's to be healthy and that's what I've been working hard for. It takes the same amount of effort to gain as it is to lose.  I probably just rambled off but I'm on my phone. Just wanted to say I understand how you feel and if you wanna chat, my inbox is open."

He was always got upset when i got bills from my them. He never took the time to go to these appointments with me. Said i was never going to save any money.Yet if i said something about his gambling habit he would get extremely angry with me. He would lose hundreds at a time.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,silverse,48,Mon Jul 20 03:30:46 2015 UTC,"You deserve to be with someone who cares about your health, both mentally and physically."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,miscreantpossum,22,Mon Jul 20 04:09:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. I know  its not fun having to spend time at a Dr's office,  but i mean the stuff I'm going threw isn't  some stuff that is minimal. I have anklylosing spondylitis and reproductive track issues and its hard going and hearing stuff alone."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,SaiyajinPrincess87,17,Mon Jul 20 04:59:32 2015 UTC,"I totally understand. For the first two years of our relationship my boyfriend would come along to all my appointments because I was severely hypothyroid so I had really terrible recall and couldn't remember what had happened. You deserve someone supportive unlike your ex, may he suffer from a hell of root canals with no anesthetic."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,intrinsicdisorder,78,Mon Jul 20 06:08:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best thing you can do for yourself is to get out now. That's the isolation portion of abuse. He would prefer you to not have friends, and any time that you show attention to your friends there will most likely be a conflict. With abusers, it's about making sure that their target has no one who they can turn to, no one to tell them it's a good idea to leave their abuser. It makes their manipulation easier for them, and more devastating to their spouse."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,StrangerSkies,22,Mon Jul 20 02:54:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, its still hard but I see it now. I shouldn't have to try so hard to make something work when I don't get anything from it. But still seeing the life you have been building with someone fall apart is not an easy thing. But I'm upset I let that happen to me. I grew up seeing the women around me being abusive relationships and vowed to never have one but you can't always plan on things to turn out the way you want them."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,SaiyajinPrincess87,20,Mon Jul 20 03:38:19 2015 UTC,You can't blame yourself for getting into one.  It starts so slowly and pretty soon you're questioning yourself a lot.  What's awesome is that you're getting out!  And now you know exactly what to look out for in the future.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,stormbornqueen,4,Mon Jul 20 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"No you can't, but then that makes now the time to change things for yourself. Use the supports in your life, spend time with that friend. Spend time with your family members, do things to keep yourself busy. But if you want out, use those things between working on Divorce papers and necessary things to keep yourself together."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,howdidyouevendothat,29,Mon Jul 20 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"Girl, good on you for recognizing that the way he was treating you is not okay. You need to get out and find a good place, whether it be with your mom or a friend, and focus on healing yourself. Find a therapist, get a dog, do something that makes you feel good. I'm sure there are subreddits for abusive relationships, but off the top of my head I know none. Please look for women's resource centers in your area (Planned Parenthood is a good place to start if you have no idea where to go, they should be able to redirect you) and take care of yourself!"

Bring the pup made him mad but he has his moments of anger with the dog  so I refuse to leave him there. I plan to start doing all the things I use to again like drawing."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,Trystanik,2,Mon Jul 20 03:35:49 2015 UTC,A wonderful thing to do with drawing is definitely Hit Record. You don't have to be an amazing artist to join and they provide you with fun challanges for drawings! It's a whole community of creative people getting together to make art. Great thing to get your creative juices flowing.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,occidentalis,20,Mon Jul 20 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are so strong and perceptive. Sometimes abusers get such a strong hold, the abused have no self worth and can't tell that their problems are not their fault.  I'm glad you've got a support network to help you find your own life, and awesome that you are able to save your dog from possible abuse.  If you need help with anything, feel free to send me a PM."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,FivebyFive,9,Mon Jul 20 04:33:26 2015 UTC,"I was in a really bad relationship a few years ago. I put up with it for 2 and a half years. The amount of emotional, verbal and mental abuse was unreal. The moment I received a message from any of my friends he was instantly angry that I would spend more than five minutes having a conversation with them,  or dinner was terrible because he didn't like soy sauce (I love it),  I worked double what he did and got home half hour before him and he'd be mad that dinner wasn't ready and the list goes on ....   I put up with so much shit because like you, I thought I was in love. I was, at a time. But that died the moment he put his hands on me.   You need to realize that your safety and happiness is worth far more than your giving credit to. He is the cause of your unhappiness and I'm sure he knows it. Remember that he will not change unless he wants to and it's clear that he doesn't. You cannot do anything to change him and you should try to see this as a blessing in disguise.   You now have the freedom to start a new life and be truly happy. You're allowed to cry, you're allowed to miss the good times and the happy times, but don't think for a second that it will go back to that. Please trust me.   Love yourself and love the future that you have in store."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,hankdiggles,7,Mon Jul 20 04:22:39 2015 UTC,I realize that now. Im feeling like I might do something at any moment to set him off. I want someone who will listen and talk to me  about me day.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,pagangds,3,Mon Jul 20 04:35:03 2015 UTC,Realizing it is the first step to making positive changes. I hope you get things worked out for the better.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,inflagra,5,Mon Jul 20 04:41:55 2015 UTC,That's awesome thay you're seeing it. This first step is always the most difficult. Never be around people who drain the life from you. Loved ones should be lifting you up no matter what you do or who you talk to.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,rabdacasaurus,6,Mon Jul 20 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"Oh sweetie. I've been there before and it was not fun. He was an asshole.. ensured I relied on him financially, would pitch a tantrum whenever I wanted to see my friends but he never wanted to go with me anywhere, always took my things (car, ipod, etc) just because he wanted them.. the list goes on and on. He relapsed back into his drug habit, cheated on me with two girls (that I know of), stabbed himself in the arm and put his hands around my throat when I told him I was leaving, and refused divorce for like 2 and a half years!   Do NOT be me. Stand up for yourself.  Do you have shared bank accounts? Any property aside from the pets? Kids? Do you think he will contest a divorce?"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,WhiteFishCantSwim,8,Mon Jul 20 04:24:25 2015 UTC,"No lucky we just have both our names on the apartment lease. The dog is registered to me as well. Everything else was kept separate , I hadn't even changed my name yet after the marriage. Im trying to be strong and move on. This was my first relationship and it just didn't go the way I thougt it would. Now I plan to just spend time with my family."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,NurseAngela,5,Mon Jul 20 04:30:39 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds weird from an internet stranger but I'm so proud of you! I've seen a friend go through this, and she just kept staying with the guy. Stayed until the abuse got physical. Stayed after it got physical. The warning signs were all there (like they are with your husband), he isolated her, put her down, made her think it was her fault. And she just couldn't imagine life without him.   You got out, you can imagine a different life! One where you're happy, respected, loved! You're so much braver than you know. Just remember this, at 22 you literally have your whole life ahead of you. And you can make it whatever you want it to be. Try to see the adventure in that and you'll do just fine."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,Guckalienblue,2,Mon Jul 20 12:46:34 2015 UTC,"He sounds like a complete piece of shit, I hope he doesn't try to cause too much trouble over you leaving. Take your furbabies and go on that trip to London, spend time with your best friend, and focus on being you without that asshole dragging you down. <3"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,Hey-its-Shay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:53 2015 UTC,This is how it begins. The abuse often ends up becoming physical after a while . Good for you for getting out early
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,jchandler45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:25 2015 UTC,"That type of abuse is so insidious because it develops gradually, and slowly you start losing more and more of yourself until you forget what it was that you actually like about yourself. He doesn't want you to like yourself. He wants you to hate yourself and think that he's the only one that will ever love you.   I'm so happy that you've seen it for what it is because if you stay with him, he'll completely isolate you by throwing temper tantrums whenever you do something he doesn't like until eventually you only have him, and it will be that much harder to leave.  Internet hugs!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,jonbowen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"The hardest part is over, now that you can see your relationship clearly. All you have to do now is follow through and begin putting yourself as a top priority again. Just remember as you go through this that you are always 100% lovable and that there are tons of people who are there to support you (platonically and romantically) even though sometimes it may seem like noone is there. Good luck!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,howdidyouevendothat,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"I was with a guy like that for years. It took getting in a safe, equal, loving relationship to see it though. I don't have any advice, I just want you to know that it can get better and I'm super glad you are out of that and realize it is what it is."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwf1o,howdidyouevendothat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"So the best thing you can do is contact the local domestic violence shelter in your area.  Even if you choose not to use them as a place to go they can hook you up with lots of resources including councillors, lawyers, finical aid etc.  If you're serious about wanting out then you need to thinking of your safety first.  If you're in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, leaving can often be a trigger for physical violence.    Be safe!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dzr99,mysterious_walrus,7,Mon Jul 20 21:13:06 2015 UTC,"This has happened with a lot of people in my life, and I think sometimes it's a natural thing. Like you noticed, if you stop putting in all the effort and they don't reciprocate, it is what it is.  But then again, maybe they don't realize it's happening?  I stopped making the effort with an old friend and we lost touch. Recently, she sent me the nicest note apologizing for that time period, and saying that she would love to get back together and catch up.  Another old friend was very MIA during my wedding planning. I wrote her a long email explaining why I was hurt by her distance, and she wrote back a huge response thanking me for being honest and apologizing, telling me how her life is so hectic right now she's dropping the ball a lot but still cherishes our long friendship.  So I dunno, sometimes I think people's relationships change and that's life, but other times maybe it's worthwhile to bring it up to the person?"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dzr99,shupyourface,3,Tue Jul 21 00:26:54 2015 UTC,She could have depression.  One of its effects is to make the patient seem like they are disconnected so they don't even try.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dzr99,EnterpriseNCC1701D,3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the case. I'm friends with her on Facebook and follow her on Instagram. She has a very active social life, she just doesn't make an effort to include me in it any longer. Thanks for the input though!"

I know it is hard to confront someone about something like that (trust me, I have had to do the same before!), but it is the only way you will have answers. I suggest calling her again to bring her out, to some place where you can have some drinks and talk it out. I heard alcohol makes these things easier :-) good luck"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e2jbp,Barely-Boobage,5,Tue Jul 21 15:25:19 2015 UTC,Lots of foreplay and some lube should help things.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e2jbp,muddlet,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:36 2015 UTC,"As the others have said, lube! And foreplay and teasing to the point that all you can think of is sex - the more turned on you are, the more dilated your vagina is so it should be easier. Have him go in really slowly, an inch at a time so you can get used to it and adjust your position to accommodate. And Communication is key!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3e2jbp,artipants,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:34 2015 UTC,try pausing once he goes in and you should stretch. when it stops hurting you should be good to go. lube and foreplay are your friends. ask /r/bigdickpriblems for some more advice

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dyo32,numberthangold,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:45 2015 UTC,Since upkeep can be so expensive and time consuming we decided as a couple to just let our hair grow out. It's been a few months now and we are both back to our natural state and enjoy it. It's a lot easier.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dx2vo,soopaaflii,7,Mon Jul 20 06:35:56 2015 UTC,"I usually wear a pair of nude or skin-toned seamless panties when wearing white pants, leggings, or tight skirts. I like the ones from Uniqlo. Some skin-toned lace thongs also work, but it depends on the seams.  Whichever style you choose, it is imperative that the underwear fits you nicely (as in not too tight or not too loose). If they're too tight, it would defeat the purpose of seamless panties; since your butt could look weird, like you're wearing invisible ill-fitting panties. If they're too loose, they could bunch up and won't look smooth underneath.  For black or dark leggings, it's best to wear black or dark seamless panties or thongs. The color is probably not important during daytime. But during nighttime and say someone takes flash photography of your entire outfit, pale-colored undies under black clothing could be noticeable."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dx2vo,trufflecheese,6,Mon Jul 20 09:07:50 2015 UTC,"I had this question a lot regarding shirts when I worked at a bra store. Many people think that you should wear a matching colour underneath in order to not see it. DO NOT DO THIS. If you wear white undies under white pants they will show through like crazy. Wear a nude colour (as close to your skin tone as you can find, but it doesn't have to be perfect)."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dx2vo,invalid101,5,Mon Jul 20 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"I had a uniform that required khakis at one job several years back. My favorite pair was exceptionally thin and light. A black lady came up to me at work one day and pulled me to the side to tell me she could see my polka dot underwear through my pants. She told me that she would normally wear black underwear with pants that thin, but I should wear tan.  As embarrassing as it was, I took her advice to heart. Unless you're pale as a ghost, you probably shouldn't wear white but something broadly close to the color of your skin should work for light colored pants.    Seamless underwear is a godsend for tighter pants and leggings. I found some cheap ones that fit me well at Target and stock up occasionally. I've seen them elsewhere, too."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dx2vo,artipants,3,Mon Jul 20 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"I don't wear white pants, but I imagine that most of them have thick enough fabric so you wouldn't be able to see the underwear.   And to answer your other question, yes, thongs are always the answer."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwnia,daisylove,4,Mon Jul 20 03:46:42 2015 UTC,"I used to go to bars alone regularly - I'd take a book and have a seat up at the bar and get to know the bartender - it was never weird or awkward ... got hit on a couple of times, just politely told them I wasn't interested and I never had a problem with them respecting that ... I always attributed it to sitting up against the bar - the bartenders usually keep an eye out for stuff like that."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwnia,Kill_The_Dinosaurs,2,Mon Jul 20 03:48:21 2015 UTC,I've never seen someone with a book there. I'm a very self conscious person (as you can guess from this post) but trying to get out of my shell.   Do people still do that? Go to bars and read? Ugh. I guess it shouldn't matter what others are doing.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dwnia,Kill_The_Dinosaurs,2,Mon Jul 20 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"Do people still do that?   Honestly, I don't know. I did - but I will admit this was 5yrs ago.   Ugh. I guess it shouldn't matter what others are doing   No, it shouldn't - but it's so hard to really actually truly grasp that.  You will probably feel weird as hell the first time you go alone and maybe set up for someone to meet you - but get there a good 30-45min early so you're sort of easing your way into it. It will begin to feel less awkward the more comfortable you get."

I'm not a bartender, but you could try going in to one place at a few different times of day/on different days and take note of when it's quiet. It'll be a good time to read a book, but it'll also be more likely that the bartender(s) will have more time to chat. Start by asking what they recommend or don't and why and go from there. I find that, given the right atmosphere (Irish places usually have this vibe for me, YMMV) it'll be easy for others to jump in and you might make a bar-friend who can chat beer with you.  Sounds like fun! I'm moving to a bar-friendly city soon (how I've missed bars) and this has made me excited all over again to check out new locals."

So it's more painful and messy, But it's over in 5 days instead of what used to be 8.  Discharge? No, however I think my cervical fluid smells like pennies now, my BFF says I'm crazy and it smells normal (Yes, my BFF smelled my cervical fluid just to give her opinion.)  Insertion tips   Take anti-inflamatory pain releif 20 minutes-1 hour prior to insertion. Mefenamic acid is the best, Naproxen sodium, diclofenac sodium and Ibuprofen are also good. DO NOT take aspirin, the insertion process may cause cervical bleeding and aspirin can make that heavier.  Take Analgesia after the insertion, Paracetamol, Codeine etc. If pain is a great concern, as your GYN if they could prescribe something such as Codeine. (I would recommend Tramadol, but I had a hard enough time getting a script for 30mg codeine....)  Continue to take anti-inflamatory pain relief after the insertion. Double check with your doctor, but it should be safe to take NSAIDs with other analgesia if you space each dose out and only take it for a short duration. Ask your GYN what anaesthetics they offer, My GYN offered a topical spray of lignocaine for my cervix, and lignocaine injections (like what dentists use) to then inject into my cervix if needed. I asked for the spray, but opted to forgo the needle. Eat something light, but sugary before the procedure, juice is good because it wont trigger nausea too much. Have something sweet, light and comforting set aside for after the insertion. Buy stick on heat pads to have on your journey home from the clinic, and had a heat pack waiting at home. Book the insertion on your day off so you can nap afterwards. Buy pads and bring one to the clinic. the insertion may cause spotting, and you can not insert anything into your vagina for 48-72 hours after insertion due to an increased risk of infection due to you cervix being slightly dilated. So you must use pads for any bleeding. BRING A FRIEND ie: boyfriend, your mum, your sister, your BFF. For starters it's good to have someone help escort you home (If they can drive you that's even better, I took the bus). Having someone to comfort you in the recovery area when it's over is nice. I brought my friend into the room with me and she held my hand and stroked my hair during the insertion. I could not have handled it as well as I did without her.  Don't rush it, If you need time to relax pre-insertion, tell your GYN and take that time to relax, If you feel dizzy afterwards, just sit there and recover. The clinic should have a recovery area you can move to once it's over, stay there as long as you need, there is no need to hurry yourself.   The pain Itself  Insertion is very quick, I was in the chair for <5 minutes and the actual insertion pain was a second, if that, so just remember that it's only temporary.  The sensations were interesting, that's for sure. I have vulvodynia and cervical motion tenderness, I was very anxious about insertion pain.  First there is a speculum that is inserted into the vagina, This is identical to normal vaginal exams, I describe it as feeling as though someone is flicking your vaginal wall. Then there is a tool used to clamp and immobilise the cervix, this feels a bit like a pap smear, an uncomfortable pressure that may be pinchy and achey. This is where I asked for the anaesthetic spray, because the clamp was already very painful for me.  Then comes the sounding rods, these are used to open the cervix and to check that the uterus will accommodate the IUD. This hurts a lot, For me it felt like I had been kicked in the testicles and smacked on the back of my head with a baseball bat simultaneously, I don't even have testicles. It was sharp, sudden and very deep, even though it was only touching my cervix and uterus I felt the sharpness in my whole abdominal cavity. It lasted less than a second, and then was gone, I felt mildly crampy, like I had to poop. My GYN gave me a minute at this point to catch my breath and relax.  Next comes the loading gun/IUD insertion tool. It feels exactly the same as the sounding rod, and is just as quick, Only now the after--effect cramps were full blown period cramps.  I had a severe hypertensive reaction to the pain and I passed out after the insertion because my blood pressure had risen and then dropped. I also threw up a bit when I was coming around.  I had some juice in the waiting room, which made me less nauseas, I was still very dizzy, I walked slowly to the bus stop and took the bus home, once home, my friend made me a hot chocolate and after that I was much less dizzy. I was incredibly fatigued and fell fast asleep at midday.  The cramps lasted several days, But I started my period the day I got my IUD so I can't say if the cramps were IUD induced or period  induced.  My period pain was bad before my IUD, I'd need days off school/work and some days I couldn't walk because of cramps, I would say that on occasion they got as bad as an 8/10 at the peak of contraction. The insertion pain was a 10/10 and I don't use that lightly, the after-cramps of the IUD was a 6/10. (For further comparison, for me, dislocating my knee was an 8/10, stubbing my toe is a 3/10)  Tips on Living with an IUD  I only have one tip that I think is awesome enough to share. IUD strings are used for confirming the IUD is in place via a non-invasive vaginal exam (Compared to an ultrasound and hysterscope) and they assist with removing the IUD when the time comes, But they can be annoying and get in the way. Over time they soften, Mine feel like silk now, but at first they were stiff and pokey and my penis-owning partner's were irritated by them. In addition, every individual varies, but it's common to have a bruised cervix following insertion which can make sex unpleasant.  Use Menstreal sponges or soft tampons like Gynotex or Joy Division to both protect your SO from the strings, and protect your tender cervix from your SO.  Yes, Insertion was painful and horrible and I hate it and I'm scared to do it again. But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it's less painful than childbirth or a medical abortion and it's a few hours of pain for 10 years of protection. By the time the IUD is ready to be replaced, I'll be in my 30's and I can hopefully convince my GYN that it's time to tie my tubes, If not, second IUD!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dvpg0,mundabit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same with me on all of this.  The only thing I've noticed is that I'm now iron deficient from the Copper IUD. So I'm taking iron supplement pills.  I think I'm gonna get it taken out soon, and go with Mirena."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dvpg0,MandyChristina,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"I think I smell like penny's too. The copper smell is super strong while mixed with blood. But then dies down after the period. Also I while I bleed alot more now I only have one heavy day (day 3) and then just spot for the rest of the days. Also some how I was graced with zero cramps which is great because it use to be unbearable. However, now I have to chart my cycle or I never know when I'm going to start."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dvpg0,rose_is_badwolf,2,Mon Jul 20 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"I got a Mirena a little more than a year ago. I'm 31, never had kids. I was 30 when it was inserted. I'm not going to lie, it sucked. It was a kind of pain I wasn't expecting, it was a super crazy cramping pain. I recommend having some take you so they can drive you home. I was having crazy cramping and it was distracting to drive. Give yourself the whole rest of the day at least to recover. Your uterus is gonna be all, wtf is in here! And it's gonna be mad. I spent the day and night in bed with a heating pad watching netflix. It was just like super bad period cramps which I don't normally get. I did mine on a Friday so I didn't  have to worry about work until Monday. I was spotty for a few weeks. After a few weeks, everything was back to normal. I can't tell it's in there..and it's amazing. Seriously best thing I've done for myself. However, I'm not looking forward to when I have to have it removed and a new one put in.   I don't have periods anymore, which is awesome. My boyfriend can feel it sometimes but not in a painful way. As far as the pain, I took the ibuprofen  like they recommended...it still sucked. It's not a pain like, oh I cut myself and it hurts. It's a really crazy pressure kind of pain and the worst cramps in life...it was weird. I don't really know what MORE you could for the pain other than taking some sort of prescription med. But I don't know how helpful it would be."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dvpg0,TitsForTaat,2,Mon Jul 20 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"I got the mirena 3 years ago and I love it.  After 6 months I stopped getting periods at all, and since my body didn't react well to the hormones that the pill gave me, the mirena was a great solution to that.  Yes, the first couple days suck-- it is the strangest cramp I've ever felt, but in the long run it has been SO worth it for me.  Make sure you take an anti-inflammatory prior to going and keep up that dose in the days that follow.  Also, an ice pack or heat pad does wonders to relieve the cramping."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dvpg0,liluglybae,3,Mon Jul 20 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"There are about a thousand 'tell me about IUDs' posts on here with lots of answers.  Do a search or look back a couple days to find some.  No disrespect meant, but it's asked constantly."

I was aware of the insertion pain but decided to go with it anyways.  40mins of agony later the 2 nurses concluded that currently one cannot be fitted due to the tightness of my cervix. They told me it is rare but it happens and also said that childbirth hurts the same way just worse. At least the nurses made me a 'cuppa'."

Amazon has great UK brands like Panache, Cleo, Freya, and others. :)  I don't really like Victoria's Secret much since they size people incorrectly in-store.

You've got this! Try some that are on sale online. I also use eBay and /r/braswap to find bras. Sometimes Zulily has good sales too. If they don't work out you can try selling them on Bratabase and /r/braswap. I've recouped most of the cost of all my ""nah this was a mistake"" bras that way.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dvuzr,ygfann,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"Amazon is definitely the best place for pinning down your ideal size, if it's out of the A-DD 32-38 range, since they have free shipping on returns :) It was a real life saver when I was first figuring my own size (28GG/H) out.   After you have it pinned down and feel confident, Bratabase is a great resource with lots of measurements for different bras and such. It's more overwhelming at first, though!  Nordstrom is also a US store that does carry many UK brands in harder-to-find sizes. They're ridiculously expensive, though, so I'd recommend going there to try bras on but probably buying them elsewhere."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dvuzr,missdeejers,3,Mon Jul 20 00:12:32 2015 UTC,Victoria Secrets! They're definitely pricey but they last for years. I still have one from 5 years in good condition. The trick is not to wear one bra for a long period of time since that ruins the shape of the cups and the bra in general. Wear the bras interchangeably.

I have gotten name brand/designer bras like Calvin Klein, Guess, Gap for a fraction of the price. For instance I got a $50.00 Calvin Klein bra for 10 bucks.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3du5kh,miningchick2015,9,Sun Jul 19 14:30:03 2015 UTC,"I'd guess camping strategies would work decently well here. You have a couple options I can think of right off:   If you are a tampon user primarily, keep tampons in whatever bag you are using. Have a ziploc or other brand of sealable, air-tight plastic bag. Place used tampons and other tampon debris in this bag so no scent escapes.  Menstrual cups may be a good option too. Menstrual cups are safe to leave in for 12 hours easily, and they're pretty easy to just empty and put back in even if you're not in a place where you can properly wash them every time - just do it once you're back in your own space. Probably not feasible for your shift coming up, since I wouldn't recommend your first time being a ""trial by fire"" like that since some women take a few tries to get the seal properly without it leaking and such, but a good idea later on.  If you prefer pads, I'd do #1 but with pads instead of tampons. It's a bit bulkier, but it is what it is. I also recall another user somewhere (can't find the exact post) talking about a brand of reusable pads that come with a water-right pouch for used ones on the go, so if reusable cloth pads are something you're interested I'd look for those!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3du5kh,thecerealdilemma,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it. There are horror stories for every product ever produced. I had two issues: (1) leaking; I had to figure out how to properly insert it so it worked for my body. I actually almost gave up but figured out inserting it at an angle worked much better and (2) removing the cup; I definitely struggled the first few times I used it. Good luck with it.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dtxwz,Crawford0927,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:18:15 2015 UTC,"I had an ultrasound to check on my IUD shortly after it was inserted because I was getting acute stabbing pain, They did a transabdominal at first, and while they were there they checked my ovaries, bladder, kidneys and gallbladder just to check for other sources of the pain. Then they let me go pee, then I came back and they did a transvaginal ultrasound.  I've had plenty of ultarsounds before due to other gynaecological issues, and this was no diffrent. I prepared by drinking fluid, wore comfortable clothes that were easy to pull down for the transabdominal and pull up for the transvaginal (eg: a skirt with an elastic waist band) but this isn't necessary as they will offer you a gown or modesty apron to wear. I'm just lazy and never bother with gowns.  I lied down on the table flat on my back with my abdomen exposed, they put on the lubricating gel which was warm because it's a full time sonography suite and they're fancy like that. Then they rubbed the probe over my abdomen, they had me roll over and lie on my side for the kidneys.  The transvaginal was actually very comfortable. I lifted my skirt and lied down on my back with my feet together and knees apart. The wand was small and very smooth, it went in as easily as a plastic tampon applicator, they moved it around slowly and slightly but it didn't really feel like anything, and it was less than a minute.  They found my IUD fast enough and showed me on the screen, they didn't say if it looked good or not, but they were calm so I wasn't worried. (when they scanned over my gallbladder all I saw was a white mess, and immediately realised the pain I was feeling in my abdomen was actually gallstones, not my new IUD)  Then they handed me some paper towels and I cleaned up, put my underpants back on, signed the form they gave me to have the films given to my GP and I was done. I saw my GP that afternoon where she confirmed my IUD was in place, but that I have cholelithiasis."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dpuza,Snowwhitesevencats,4,Sat Jul 18 07:44:37 2015 UTC,"From the Diva cup website:  The DivaCup is worn low at the base of the vagina and away from the cervix. This means that it should not interfere with an internal birth control device. However, please use caution when using any internal feminine hygiene product with an IUD as there is the possibility that they can be dislodged. When using The DivaCup, it is important to carefully follow the directions in our User Guide, paying close attention to inserting The DivaCup low in the vaginal canal and breaking the seal (suction) before removal. Many of our customers use The DivaCup with an IUD or NuvaRing® simultaneously, but we recommend that you become familiar with your birth control device’s risks (such as the body expelling the IUD, etc.).  So it should be ok, but you should be certain of how to use the cup/ be totally comfortable with your IUD. I've read horror stories about women being unable to relieve the pressure/suction of their menstrual cup and having to get it removed by a doctor for fear of it yanking an IUD out... not sure how realistic these fears are because an IUD sits higher but its worth looking into. If you are concerned, it may be worth considering using a sea sponge tampon- they're reusable and cheap and comfy and all that jazz."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dpuza,realhumanbabby,3,Sat Jul 18 12:01:56 2015 UTC,I'm very comfortable with my cup so I'm hoping it will be fine and the light seal inside me while wearing it doesn't mess with my iud . Thank you for sharing
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dpuza,pastramijello,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"I was confused as to why they mentioned nuvarung when you take it out to have your period. Then I realized bleeding for some lasts longer than a week.  March on, sisters!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dpuza,AddContentHere,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"Be careful. I had a paraguard IUD and used a menstrual cup with for something like a year without any issues. Then one day I went to take out the cup, felt a weird cramp and the IUD came out in the cup. My theory is that I must have pinched the strings in the cup and pulled them both out at the same time.   The other thing I found is that regardless of how low I inserted the cup, over time it would slide up and sit around my cervix. So if that isn't a problem for you, you might be okay. Good luck!"

Outside of /r/TrollXChromosomes and /r/TwoXChromosomes, nowhere on reddit or my real life are there discussions about period stuff or questions about hair ties or ""how to girl"" or other women's perspective stuff.  Plus, this is a subreddit that hasn't been invaded by the usual lameness of reddit.... kind of like how /r/TwoXChromosomes was before it went default.

I still don't identify as female though, I feel like I haven't earned it yet if that makes any sense. From what I understand that mental feeling should switch over eventually but I'm not there yet. I joined this sub back when I figured out I was trans as part of my efforts to catch up on all the girl stuff I'm ignorant about."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dmo4o,clumsycolours,17,Fri Jul 17 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"You don't have to earn it!  It might be internalized transphobia, as most of society sadly still is shit regarding trans stuff. I bet you'll get over it."

I don't look female, I don't sound female, and I don't feel female. Calling myself female at the moment just sounds very wrong. I'm putting a lot of time and effort into fixing this but I've got a ways to go still."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dmo4o,wanderingscribe,4,Sat Jul 18 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"Heh. You sound just like I did a year ago.   I'm dfab, but, due to hormone shenanigans, also see myself as androgynous (I have more androgen than estrogen & progesterone). So I often felt like calling myself female was wrong because I didn't look female (hirstutism, body image issues), didn't sound female (squeaky boy voice), and didn't feel female (or male, but more like both and yet neither, if that makes any sense).  This sub has helped me simplify my life, improved how I looked, and taught me how to take better care of me. I may not be the ideal woman, whatever that is, but I feel better about who I am and what I want in life."

Because I have a real life already that requires my attention.  I think most people in real life are more reasonable and mature than what I see on the internet. Then I found this sub. It's just women and girls talking about issues that relate to our day to day life as women. Girl stuff. No drama. No gender wars. Any guys that are here do not do that. And all the people on here are delightful,  polite, just lovely,  as well as intelligent,  and diverse. We all fit in. No judgment. We are different and can be who we are.

So that way if you are completely lost, you can get in contact with them. Try to look at your apartment as more of a base camp for a while. It's not prison, you don't have to spend every moment there. If you're feeling too closed in, go to the library or go for a walk, or even just go to Starbuck's or something! If you have room and plan on bringing a desk or kitchen table, try to set it up near or right in front of a window.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dmp7e,sadlander,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:37:38 2015 UTC,"OK, massive wall of text, sorry. But I have found myself in all three of these situations before. So here goes my pep talk...!  New jobs are always kinda stressful! Just be yourself and do the best you can possibly do, even if your administrator isn't there. Everyone will appreciate your drive  to get stuff done, even if you don't have the guidance at first. When I started my professional internship, I realized I already knew more than I thought I did, and didn't end up needing a lot of help to start off with.  Since you two haven't really lived together before, this will  be a bit of a change. But fret not! You will just have to get used to each other's way of living. For me and my (now) fiance, it was a bit rocky at first but turned out just fine. You just have to remember that you are living with another person who may not do everything the same way you do it, and that's ok! Just another part of the relationship, and once you get used to living together, it is quite awesome and relaxing :) My big tip here: Make sure you have something you enjoy doing in your apartment. Whether it is reading, knitting, or playing video games (or literally anything), have something that you can go do on your own for a bit. You won't want to be together doing the exact same thing 24/7. Also, as another poster said, you don't have to stay in the apartment all the time. Get out and go for a walk or something! I found that going grocery shopping was my ""escape"" when I needed to get out for a few. And enjoy the big bed, and the pet! Pets always listen to you when you talk ;)  As for your friends, sometimes this just happens. And it could not even be happening! It sounds like you are all starting to go different ways in your life. Your fried got engaged, you have a job and are moving in with your SO... people and situations change. You won't always be friends with your ""best friend"" unfortunately. I learned that when I started dating my fiance, and especially after we got engaged. Things change in weird ways sometimes. BUT, take this as an opportunity! Get to know your neighbors at your apartment complex/building/street... get to know your coworkers! Meeting new people can be tough, but just be yourself and you'll find new friends in no time! And, once again, your current friends may not even be phasing you out. They could just be having a weird week, or something personal going on. Who knows! Just keep trying, don't give up on it.  Lastly, remember to just breathe. It will all be okay :)"

If he suddenly/unexpectedly acted disinterested and called the relationship off, maybe it has left you feeling insecure about yourself and whether there was something ""wrong"" with you?  I had a similar situation occur when my boyfriend of 2 years pretty much ghosted me. It took me years to get over it, and I was still always left with a feeling of ""unfinished business"" which messed up my subsequent relationships. When the old boyfriend finally got in touch with me to come clean about cheating on me, it felt like a huge load off my chest. Nothing had been ""wrong"" with me, he just disappeared because he felt so guilty! Now that I know this, it has helped me connect more with my current boyfriend and feel more present in the relationship."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3di41w,af7202a,5,Thu Jul 16 14:22:50 2015 UTC,"Well I did have a sense of closure. I feel pretty good about it. It just stings a bit. I'm just hung up on thinking that he was the only guy I was sexually compatible with as ridiculous as that sounds. Or maybe its more-so that there was a lot of affection in that too, he was very compliment-y. This recent kid not so much, which I don't mind but that sort of validation is sweet at some times."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3di41w,MariacheMustache,8,Thu Jul 16 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"Oh Hun. There is no such thing as a magical ""one true match"" when it comes to sexual compatibility.    There are so many influencing matters of sexuality that maybe one day you experience it's range.   The main aspect, I think, is looks and attraction. Different facial features are appealing to certain women based on hormone levels. Enjoying the smell of their body odors and the taste of a kiss show hormonal and immunity compatibly.   Sexual attraction boils down to basic biology. It can even mislead you. Just because a guy is compatible on the sexual level doesn't mean they're perfect or that you'll never find something like that again. It kind of just means you would have made some really strong, disease resistant babies.   There will people you are highly sexually compatible with, but they're dumber than bricks. Some that you just don't click with at all and they are exactly on your level mentally and emotionally.   Hope that helped."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3di41w,aerilea,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"Long story time! It's tl;dr and all that....  I dated someone who ghosted me too...but he was an serious alcoholic who hid it from me. He had a DUI when I first met him, but I thought it was a judgment lapse on his part. I only found out about his problem from his father because he had to monitor him a lot. It didn't always work because he would just up and disappear for hours at a time. It was very stressful for everyone.   He knew he had a problem, and went to AA meetings and I went to one with him as support...and to be honest, as a non-drinker I found it really surreal. He got a sponsor, and they were going through the twelve steps, and the next thing you know, he ends things because he has to focus on sobriety. I was dismayed, but he had to do what he had to do. But I was expecting to at least remain friends and check in with him occasionally, but he cut me off entirely. He ignored my calls and texts, blocked me on facebook...and he had this friend that refused to let me talk to him. Nothing was going on between them because she had a boyfriend. She said I was too much for him...um, all right, I'm sorry, but why was I not informed of this? She didn't elaborate, and was pretty mean about it...it made me despondent for months after that because I had no closure. I ended up moving back home for a few months, but it took me a long time to get over it.   We never spoke again but I found out later that he had been dealing with gender dysphoria and had started living as a woman. That floored me, because aside from the drinking, he had given no indicators that he had been considering this...I guess I am a horrible person for thinking this, but I was like, 'well, fuck him for not telling me, he's a hopeless loser and beyond anyone's help anyway.' The last I heard, he had been in and out of jail several times...and all because he was found passed out on a park bench with alcohol on his breath. I couldn't help him because he didn't want to help himself."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3di41w,Odramabama,9,Thu Jul 16 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"I think you're someone who can't separate sex from feelings. That's fine, a lot of people are like that. You will meet someone who you are sexually compatibly with and wants to be with you. As a girl who was desperate for love from the wrong people, finding someone who actually wanted to be with me was great. (:  Also jumping from guy to guy after you are still have some residual feelings will just make you miserable. Maybe you got with this guy just too soon? Sexual experiences can create a lot of emotions and it might take you a while to figure out how to deal with those emotions. Everyone goes through it, just give it time."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3di41w,teaoh,5,Thu Jul 16 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"You miss what you had, not him. That's a very important distinction to make.  I think you are actually over him, but you've gotten a taste of a feeling you like and now you miss it. It's like eating an amazing desert at a restaurant overseas and trying to find something like it at home.  You need to understand that you may never find the EXACT same thing, but you'll find variations (better and worse).  You're 19. You've met a few guys out of billions. Calm down. I think you already know the answer/what to do for most of your questions, it's just a matter of controlling your emotions with your logic..because right now your emotions are crowding into your logical space.   I have opinions on other things in this post, but I don't think those are necessary/not my place to state. For your main problem...just focus on meeting others and not worrying about the few that didn't workout. It's part of life and life keeps going."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3di41w,meroyderp,3,Thu Jul 16 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of guys I really liked that I convinced myself I was okay with just being friends with benefits with. They would text me sweet things and be really cute and funny and smart and charming but they never wanted a date, just to come over at midnight. And for a long while I thought that's all guys would ever want from me. Just to collect their clothes and leave in the morning.   Then I realized that I wanted a relationship. And love. And actual feelings. And really, men especially respect you much more for that. They admire it and maybe even give you it if you're stern and you don't let them take advantage of your body and emotions. They naturally won't tell you, ""Gee, if you insisted on only a relationship with feelings I'd respect you a lot more and you could find what you want real quick,"" because then they wouldn't get what they want, which is sex. And MANY men will blow you off when they realize you won't fuck them unless you're dating them.   And many men more will love you and sex won't be so important to them. Especially when you know what you want and ask for it.  You're more than your body. It seems you have feelings and want a relationship but are suppressing it because you haven't met a boy yet who wants to give that to you. It's quite easy to find once you are honest with yourself. Some boys wait for sex for a long time, you know, if they really like the girl. There's no reason you're not worth that wait.  I hope this helped. This is what my personal journey was like anyway, and I'm only 20 and started being sexually active at 18. It's one of the best things I've ever done for myself.  PS: This doesn't mean you should not explore your sexuality. Just be more aware of what you want and are comfortable with.    Good luck. :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3difsc,A_Redhead,10,Thu Jul 16 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"Put yourself out there to make new friends. That was my biggest regret when I was in college. I had no roommate my first semester and ended up isolating myself and that isolation just stuck for the rest of my time in college. Since you'll be in a single dorm, make sure to join a club, talk to your classmates, start a study group, hang out with coworkers outside of work, keep your dorm open, talk with people on your floor, etc. Once you get a couple friends, you'll feel a lot less lonely. And just enjoy it! Try new things, meet new people.  I'm 29 and decided to go back to school this past year.

And yes for the first time EVER I think I will join some clubs! I feel that since I will have a single dorm I want to make it more fun so people can come over and I won't have a roommate who might get bothered with small parties.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3difsc,Gemmacupcake,3,Thu Jul 16 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"Congrats on going back to school! I haven't lived in dorms, but my semester abroad has taught me that when you're living alone, you definitely need to put in that little bit of extra effort to make friends. Maybe introduce yourself in the common room or to your neighbours if you can - that way, if you get sick, your neighbour might bring over some meds or tea. Learned this the hard way, but living alone, you need all the connections and relationships you can get.   When you first move in, make sure you have a toilet plunger, a first-aid kit, and some food that keeps well, the former because you'll never know when you need one, and the latter in the event that you're sick or otherwise unable to fend for yourself for a while.   •  On the subject of studying, it's definitely important to treat school as a full-time commitment. If you have 5 hours of class that day, you should be studying the other 3 hours. But then again, you probably already know this from community college.   Also, check out /r/getstudying  :)"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3difsc,miekal7113,2,Thu Jul 16 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"As a 22 yo there might be quite a difference in maturity levels between you and other newbies with whom you will probably get lumped. Look for activities / clubs / groups that will have upperclassmen that are closer in age to you.   Use your professor's office hours if you even think there might be a chance that you're confused on class material. Try to get to every professor's (or their TAs) office hours at least once in the first month or so of school. It sets a good precedent.   Based on your schedule, pick a time of week -maybe 3-5 hours- when you are ALWAYS going to study / work on homework. Thus should probably take place outside of your apartment, in a library or other study area. Then also pick a time of week when you are ALWAYS going to be doing something social (2-4 hours). (In college, there is definitely a culture of eating together, going places off campus together, etc., so take advantage of it.) Those times are sacred and inviolable. You are not allowed to go out when you said you'd be working. You're not allowed to be working when you said you'd go out. It might take some tweaking to make them really work, but it's a good idea to specifically and explicitly dedicate time.   Also. Your campus probably has a gym / fitness center that you can access for free or a reduced fee. Use it. I can't tell you how much I miss that easy access."

I use a 1 inch)  and each class I take gets a labeled tab. I only use one notebook at a time to avoid wasting a bunch of paper for classes who only use 1/2 a notebook. Each day there is class,  I write notes and then take the sheet of paper out of my notebook and place it in the corresponding section of my binder for that class. Once I go back to that class,  I take notes for that day on the same sheet. It eliminates waste a ton and if you're a thorough note taker,  you'll end up with a running dialogue of what you need to know for those classes,  in the order of how it was presented in class. If they give you a handout, just 3 hole pinch it and place it in right behind your divider. I would also label each hand out you get with the date you were given them so you know which material it is for. That way everything you need for classes is in one organized place. Just a thought. You may need to tweak it for your own life and organizational habits but I'm a senior in college (also graduated in 2012)  and it's worked well for me.   Good luck going back!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3difsc,moarplease,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"Congrats! With respect to studying tips, I def recommend downloading a free app called Self Control (if you use a Mac, but there are equivalents for Windows etc). You can set it to lock you out of certain websites for a certain length of time that you specify, so you can't procrastinate. There's also an online tutorial for how to set up an applescript to run Self Control automatically for you, versus you having to manually run it when you decide you want to get some studying done. I know this advice is kind of meh, but it literally changed my life in undergrad."

All I did was take tylenol for the pain as usual, changed my tampon before I went in and tucked the string inside a little so it wasn't visible and wouldn't get wax anywhere near it. It wasn't too painful really. I didn't say anything about being on my period to my waxer so I'm not sure you need to say anything unless you choose to."

My guess is they've seen MUCH worse than a woman with impeccable period hygeine. If I was doing it, as long as you showered (so no crusty stuff) and had a tampon in (so no leaks during the process) I'd be fine with it."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3djazk,moosamigo11,2,Thu Jul 16 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"As a side note, if you are on the pill, one of the possible side effects is hair loss. When I started, I panicked a little (there may or may not have been wailing ""I'm going bald!"" . . . I may have been adjusting to the hormones, too). Two years later, I still lose more hair than I did before I was on bc, but my fears of going bald were totally unfounded. Hair is everywhere in my house, but fortunately that still includes my head. You're good."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3djazk,Hassan_Amir,3,Thu Jul 16 22:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you're not going bald, but since you mentioned the pill, if you have the gene for androgenic alopecia (basically male patterned baldness in women, you prob have the gene if all the men and even women in yr family lost their hair as they aged), a bcp high in androgen hormones will trigger the onset of androgenic alopecia. it's what happened to me, and I'm only 22. I was on loestrin which has the highest androgenic index. I took it for 4 years and went to a hair specialist who diagnosed me with AA. So if you have a family history of hair loss, don't go on a high androgen index BC! I wish I'd known about this before so I take any change I can to warn others."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dk8o1,SunflowerInKashmir,3,Thu Jul 16 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"I would definitely be hesitant because of what happened last time.  I think it's okay to say something like, ""Are we dating/are we boyfriend and girlfriend? I'm confused because last time we did this, you said that you didn't know what you wanted and that's part of the reason I stopped talking to you. I was just wondering how you feel now.""  It's okay to date and not be BF/GF if it's okay with both parties. But if you want a boyfriend, you need to speak up for yourself. If he says no, then I have a feeling you will end things again, which is probably not a bad idea. If he says, ""Yeah, we're dating/we are boyfriend and girlfriend,"" then great!"

Just make sure you scrub yourself, with just your hands and some shower gel, and you'll be left looking bronzed! Before the tan though, you should exfoliate and shave around 24 hours before and use a tiny bit of moisturiser on places like your hands, feet, elbows and knees. If your hands turn out awful don't panic because it easily fixed with instant tan. I don't know where you are in the world, but sally hansen airbrush tan works the best for me!

It sounds like she needs an audience for her nasty remarks, but you getting angry just makes her defensive. It's typical middle school behavior. Tell her that the constant comments about strangers really disappoints you, and it's making you wonder what she says when you're not around. When she does it, tell her it saddens you to hear her say things like that, and walk away from her."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,teardrop87,17,Wed Jul 15 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!   You're right I often do get a little angry whenever she says these things, so I'll make sure to try this next time."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,teardrop87,27,Wed Jul 15 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"The first time will throw her for a loop, and then probably make her super defensive and pissed off. Don't react.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,imaperson25,9,Wed Jul 15 18:17:11 2015 UTC,This is good advice. Make it clear that you find it uncomfortable and will not be her audience.  She'll at least find a new audience... she may be your mom but you're not obligated to participate!

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,AlwaysDisposable,2,Wed Jul 15 18:59:00 2015 UTC,I'm sorry :(  It really sucks when a parent acts so inappropriately in front of their child.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,YeastInVagMakesBread,7,Thu Jul 16 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately am related to a lot of people like this and I've found that avoiding the person is the best option. However, that doesn't always work out.  I just try to remain calm and give disapproving looks and refuse to engage in the same insecure, childish behavior.   When my sister, who recently gained some weight and feels bad about it, said that a girl was grossly skinny and needed to eat a sandwich, I just told her that I knew plenty of girls like that who ate plenty of sandwiches and that being so skinny probably wasn't her fault. My sister immediately dropped it.   My grandmother honestly believes that overweight people are unlovable, and anyone in a relationship with an overweight person is just using them for some purpose and doesn't really love them. When I gained 30lbs around my divorce she told me no one would ever love me if I didn't lose some weight. She says all sorts of horrible things about how you won't get a husband if you're fat or how people don't really like you. If I say anything in reply it's something like, ""I don't know...I had a lot more friends when I was fat and my boyfriends didn't cheat on me.""  She's also incredibly racist. When she says something about black and white people being married or having kids and how awful it is, I just look at her and say, ""That's an incredibly common thing nowadays"" or ""People don't really think that's weird anymore"". She gets sort of flustered and just drops it.   My grandmother, like my sister, does these things because she is an insecure and unhappy person. Your mother sounds like an insecure and unhappy person. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE LIKE HER.   If anything, you can ask her to explain why she feels this way about people. It will probably embarrass her, which isn't a bad thing.  Just whatever you do, do it calmly."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,Amdir,2,Wed Jul 15 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's awful, especially what your grandmother said to you.

I'll definitely be sure to try this!  Thanks!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,Spokemaster_Flex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I'm always going to have some issues about my body, but I think that's relatively normal. I just focus on being healthy and looking good is a side effect of that.   As a teenager and young adult though, she really messed with my head. She started shoving diets down my throat and when I finally did lose weight (due to just not eating for months!) she started doing crazy crap like encouraging me to learn how to pole dance because 'those women are so empowered'. She would buy me big glitter platform shoes and stuff. I was like 15. My mom said she experienced similar bizarre behavior, like how she'd buy my then-teenage mom incredibly low cut blouses because she had D-cups.   Unfortunately my grandmother ended up watching my younger sister quite a lot when she was a child and she's all messed up too. She's already some spectrum of autistic and my grandmother filled her head with all her crazy BS.  It's been brought to my attention that my grandma has said things to her along the lines of ""Don't get fat like your mom or you'll always be alone"". When I was heavy again for about a year due to medication it was ""Don't get fat like your mom and sister. Look how no one loves them"".   At one point my sister was on the verge of being hospitalized for anorexia, because she was down to like 72lbs. I went to MyBodyGallery and printed out pictures of girls her height who were 110, 100, and 90lbs. I showed her the 110lb girls first and asked if she thought they were pretty, to which she said yes. I said then, ""Those girls weigh literally 40lbs more than you do"". I asked her if she thought I was fat, to which she said no, and I said, ""I'm TWICE your weight. Twice."" I showed her the 100lb and then the 90lb girls and then told her, ""I couldn't even find any girls your weight"". She just sort of got really quiet for a bit and then said, ""But...grandma said girls like that (very skinny) are beautiful"".   It broke my heart.   She's since gotten somewhat better, but still has some incredibly neurotic eating habits and sometimes flat out anorexia, and sometimes will get back down to about 82lbs. My stupid grandmother said, ""Have you seen her other half-sister? She's tiny. Your sister is just supposed to be little."" It made me so furious. Yeah, maybe she's not supposed to be like 130lbs but if she literally cannot walk more than a few feet and has a multitude of health problems and is in and out of hospitals, all due to her DIAGNOSED anorexia...maybe she has a freakin' problem. She's not beautiful. Her hair and skin look awful. She's always weird and bruisy. She's a shell of a beautiful girl.  This turned into a text wall, but the bottom line is, people need to realize that their actions have consequences and ESPECIALLY on impressionable children. There's no excuse for using every breath to put other people down and try to make them feel bad about themselves. And people shouldn't be surprised when other people don't want anything to do with them anymore. My grandma complained we didn't come see her enough and I finally just had to tell my mom, ""I absolutely do not have the energy to obsess over wearing makeup I don't like to wear, picking out an outfit, making sure I don't have any pimples visible, and praying that I haven't put on a single ounce since the last visit. I don't have the energy to be her punching bag."" So guess what? Now we never visit my grandma, period. And she deserves it."

Your grandmother sounds extraordinarily toxic, and I'm so happy you got away from her.    You also sound like a really good big sister, and I'm glad you defended her were able to help her through such a difficult time.    This turned into a text wall, but the bottom line is, people need to realize that their actions have consequences and ESPECIALLY on impressionable children.    I completely agree.  I was definitely impressionable three years ago, towards both my parents and my peers.  And although I thought I was only running away from my problems at the time, leaving public school for online school my sophomore year completely altered my life and my character.   I am a totally different person now than I was three years ago, and I don't know why, but I guess I thought my parents would be different people by now too.   But they're not, and I think that's why I can get so upset at them whenever they say cruel things toward other people.   Anyways, thanks again for your advice and for sharing your own story :)"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,cherrybomb921,4,Thu Jul 16 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"Have you sat down and talked with her about what you said in that last paragraph? That you want to start taking the higher road more and be less harsh to strangers? Even if it doesn't go over the best, having an ""I don't want to hear it"" conversation could help.  Other than that, the most sure-fire way to stop this is to make it not fun for her anymore. She's doing it A) to feel better than someone, and B) because it's fun. Once it's not fun, it's not worth the effort.  When she says ""look at her cheap clothing"" say ""she must shop at the same place as you."" When she says ""what a whale,"" say ""yeah, you could be twins!"" And when she gets mad, then you can fall back on ""it's a joke. What, isn't it funny anymore?"" Then suddenly you're not someone she can tell those jokes to. Eventually she either stops completely, or she stops in your presence. That heavily depends on the kind of relationship you have with your mom, but turning it around might make her think before she speaks."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3demdu,hesohi,3,Wed Jul 15 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"Just become an unrelenting wall of positive energy to counter her negativity.  If she says ""Hey, that guy is wearing a terrible hat"" respond with ""He has a lot of self confidence"".  Wear her down with your absolute refusal to join in with her attempt to tear everyone else down.  If she does say something nice, give her a big hug or whatever you think would reward that behavior (just like dog training).   If that fails, simply respond with a disinterested ""Uhhuh"" to what ever she is saying while making it obvious that you will only interact with her when she is being positive (just like dog training).  Edit- clarity."

You recognized your own bad behavior and managed to change- that is a really difficult thing to do and you should be proud of yourself. We can't help but look up to our parents, so it's totally reasonable to be upset and disappointed that your mom hasn't been able to make the same change you have.  As for your mother, I suggest being honest with her. If I were in your shoes, I would calmy tell her that the negativity really bums you out, and that you want nothing to do with criticizing other people. If she continues, I'd just deflect. It sounds like she wants an audience, and if her audience goes away her behavior might change. If she says something about someone in a store, walk away to look at something. If you can't get away, change the topic. You could also deflect her negativity with positivity. If she calls a woman slutty, say ""I think she looks great, I wish I had the confidence to pull off a dress like that."" Refuse to play her game, and she might give up."

I have no idea what the 'secret' is. I tend to hand wash and only air dry most of my clothing, so that may have something to do with it."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dg7vi,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:21:51 2015 UTC,How do you handwash everything? In the tub?  I have tried handwashing more than just delicates and find it exhausting.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dg7vi,SmellsLikeDogBuns,3,Thu Jul 16 01:28:50 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I will bring my clothes in the shower with me (usually my bras and shirts), but I also have a large plastic bin that I soak everything in, scrub the pits, rinse, and then lay over drying racks positioned in the tub. This happens every few weeks, as I can usually wear things ~3 times unless I get very sweaty in them. It can be time consuming if I let it go for a while, but I usually have free evenings with nothing better to do =p"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dg7vi,HouseDestroyer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:50:54 2015 UTC,"PS A little white vinegar in the rinse should help guard against soap build up, I believe. Makes rinsing easier and it's a fabric softener. Won't leave a smell, either after one more brief rinse.  Now I need a moment to be amused by your username in this context."

Almost all of my wardrobe is from there and I have built it up over several years, their bright color chino shorts and navy shirts have become a uniform of sorts of me (like seriously I have about 15 pairs of them).  I didn't know this until last year, but they do give student discounts f you show your ID and they have 30% off sales every so often. Its definitely quality clothing and classic styles that won't break the bank. And taking good care of your clothes really improves their life span, wash them inside out so they won't get beat up in the washer and I pretty much air dry everything.  For the few dark colored pieces that I really love and want to last forever without fading, I will splurge and wash in woolite darks."

Look up the best answers for tough interview questions like ""what is your greatest weakness?"". (Ex.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3df48c,nowayitsyou,7,Wed Jul 15 20:36:13 2015 UTC,Dress professionally. No matter what the job is dress for success. I used to work in a pet store and kids would come in with jeans and tank tops for interviews. Instantly made us doubt the seriousness they had. It may be just a job but will show that you are professional and take the interview serious. (now I'm not saying wear a suit but dress pants/skirt and a nice shirt works)
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3df48c,thatweirdfemale,5,Wed Jul 15 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"Think about what they are looking for in a candidate. They probably want to know how many hours you can do, whether you will work hours that other people don't want to work, whether you are reliable, how long you are planning on staying employed there, what your ambitions are within the grocery store, whether you have anything outside work that might conflict with your ability to be a good employee, whether you have good enough social skills to not scare off customers, etc. Play to those things."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,throwaway49dl398pfg,71,Tue Jul 14 15:08:09 2015 UTC,"Um...have you tried inviting THEM to things? You have no mention of it.  If you do, never mind, but if all you do is sit around and wait to be invited instead of inviting them sometimes -- of course the friendships will die...  Also -- do you ask them about anything personal? Seem involved in their lives at all? If they need help -- did you jump up and offer it? If they needed someone to talk to, did you sit and listen? When you had an issue -- did you ask them for help?  There are many types of friends -- but the types of friends you make for life are ones you show genuine interest in -- and they show it back. It's hard to find a balance between the two, but if you don't put in the effort, first, they're never going to know to give the effort back, a lot of the time.  It sounds like these were ""hang out"" friends. You were close, not disinteresting, and so they liked to hang out. But with you gone, they grew closer, genuinely keeping up with each other, helping one another, and figured since you didn't keep up with them, use them as someone to talk to, you didn't have any more interest in being very involved.  Friendships, like any relationship, are about showing love and appreciation for the other person. If you don't put in effort -- they won't either. If they don't put in effort -- you shouldn't, either. It's a difficult dance, but generally, most people want someone who cares about them and will do what they can, as long as you are compatible on some fundamental levels."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,Dr_Sylveon_PhD,10,Tue Jul 14 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I think I need to mull this answer over a little more and reflect on it.   I have invited them out but I feel weird about it because I almost feel like they hang out with me because they feel bad? I don't know, I think they enjoy my company but maybe I could have put more of an effort to stay close but at the same time I feel like no matter how much effort I would have put in this would have happened anyway, they haven't added friends to their group their whole lives.  The girl I was the closest with moved away as well so I only see her once a year but I message her every now and then but not too much. I am also a bit afraid of rejection too, with relationships (romantic and friendship) so that's something I need to work on as well."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,Dr_Sylveon_PhD,13,Tue Jul 14 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"The worst that happens is someone says no. What's so bad about it? It frees you up to find someone who may say yes, and very happily. The thing about rejection is that it saves you time and effort. You want people to reject you -- it lets you find more compatible people! If they say something bad about you during the rejection --well, I'd be twice as happy to know not to waste my time on them.  People generally don't go out to hang out in groups with people they feel sorry for. If you go in assuming you're someone no one wants to be around, you'll shut down and come off as YOU not wanting to be around them.  Don't focus on what they think of you -- focus on catching up. Asking how they are, if they picked up new hobbies, how work is. If you like these girls, show an interest. If they reject you -- you know it's not worth persuing.  Every relationship takes risk. And that's scary -- if you make it scary. It can also be exciting, fun, and a challenge. Relationships are about two people being happy together; if you assume you have nothing to offer, you will lose out on a lot of people who wish they had someone just like you in their lives because you're scared to open up. You'll also waste time on jerk-faces you could have gotten out of your life forever ago. Either way is time lost -- be afraid of that! Not rejection!  Good luck!!  And hey, if you need someone to talk to -- online friends are also possible. You can feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to.  Heck, it sounds like most people who commented on this post would be happy to have an extra person to talk to."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,sat52,25,Wed Jul 15 00:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think when it happened when you were 10 it was just girls being how they are at that age. They can just decide for whatever trivial reason they don't like you now and that is it. I had it done to me and I did it (ashamed to say). I don't know enough about the situation with the newer group of girls but when you think about it did you really make an effort to keep in touch with them as well? I have a small group of close girlfriends that I have been friends with for 10+ years and we are all friends however over time certain ones of us will be closer to other ones and then not as close. That is just how it works. But I always make an effort to be in their lives and they make that effort as well. Some years or months maybe not as much because someone might have a lot going on. And of course we have had some arguments and disagreements when we feel like someone isn't making the effort but we talk about it and always move past it. Girlfriends are super important to me and often I do get my feelings hurt in situations where I feel like someone isn't making an effort and I am so I understand if that is how you are feeling. I am also a coordinator/organizer of our group where I try to often set up group activities (dinners, brunch, get togethers at my house, etc) where we all get together. Some people aren't good at that and often I think, oh maybe I am being annoying, but then my friends will tell me thank you for coordinating things because they know they are bad about it. So my point is.... maybe you just need to be proactive about getting together and keeping in touch even if you feel like they aren't making the effort. Often times it isn't peoples intention they just get wrapped up in their own lives."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,SallyMRide,19,Tue Jul 14 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"it's cool, op, I've always been that girl. now my best friends are the kind of people who can go weeks without talking. I kind of don't like it, but it is what it is, and it works well enough. It helped to finally learn life wouldn't turn out like Friends led me to believe.  I guess you could even say 'no one told me life was going to be this way..'  okay, I'll leave now. :DD"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,northdakotanowhere,7,Tue Jul 14 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"I've always had the same issues. I was always the more hyper one that over analyzed things and never really fit in completely. I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago and it all kinda made sense after that. Add in anxiety and people just have a hard time relating. I guess I'm not an ""easy"" friend. This probably doesn't help you but you're not alone."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,MsAnthropic,6,Tue Jul 14 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"If these are your only examples, I think that you're overanalyzing things.  For the first example, you guys were 10 so there's no question that there could have been some immaturity there.  However, you do admit that you were an outlier among them and were a bit bossy, so it could go either way.  For your second example, you're the newcomer -- everyone else has known each other since preschool -- so it's not terribly surprising that they're closer to one another than to you.   What is it with these girl groups? Are they immature? Am I the problem?   The fact that you're having this crisis over these 2 examples makes me think that there's a deeper rooted issue going on."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,MsAnthropic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:19:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it a crisis but I just feel like I don't really ever stay within one group. I'm wondering in it's the group politics and maybe I am more of lone wolf?
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,MsAnthropic,4,Tue Jul 14 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"Again, your examples are pretty far apart.  It's pretty common for people to drift in/out of friend groups as they relocate for work and start families.  Are you wishing that you stayed friends with people from elementary school?  IME, that's pretty unusual."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,AzaleaDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree it's unusual, I don't wish I stayed good friends with the elementary school friends, I know we are very different so it's not like we ""click"" a lot. Maybe I am just in another changing period then."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,DutchGeekGirl,3,Tue Jul 14 23:15:33 2015 UTC,"All of the following is IME and spoken in generalities.  It gets harder to find people to ""click"" with as we get older.  When we're younger, we're less set in our ways and less judgmental so we form bonds with people that we wouldn't necessarily form bonds with today.  With that history to tie us together, we stay friends.  My closest friends are mostly from university, but I have a couple of others that I met via work.  Without school or work forcing you to interact with people repeatedly, it's harder for you to build up that history for people; thus, those friendships don't tend to be as deep.  In your case, you need an activity to put you in repeated contact with people so that you can forge those bonds."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,Lilusa,7,Tue Jul 14 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"People have already said a few things here, but I have one other thing you might want to consider. You wrote that you became friends with these girls AFTER you broke up with your boyfriend. My understanding is that you lived with them before that time too? I guess that can give off the impression that you are only interested in these girls when you are single. I know that I am quite hesitant to become friends with a girl who is only interested in me when she doesn't have a ""better option"", i.e. her boyfriend, because I feel like as soon as she gets another guy she will just disappear again. Maybe I misunderstood your post, but in case I got it right, this may be another thing to think about."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,tinnie75,5,Tue Jul 14 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like you described my life. I have difficulties picking up on when other women want to be casual friends or best friends or work acquaintances. I understand fictional characters waaaay better. I don't have any advice for you, other than keep inviting people to things and making yourself super visible socially. I know thats hard to do. I feel like I am the friend people come to when they have a problem or I happen to pop into their minds and ""oh yeah, she can be fun, lets invite her"". But you are not alone!!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,Crystal_Rose,2,Tue Jul 14 19:26:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah I think I (and maybe yourself too) need to cast our nets and then just see who actually responds to us.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,pcslady,2,Tue Jul 14 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"I can relate to you quite a lot. I've never had any super close friends, but I dare to say that I had a few friends in high school. But I finished high school a year ago and ever since then I've barely socialized with those so called friends. Yes, I'm introverted and I sometimes decline invitations because I don't feel like it, or people I don't like are going etc. but I still feel like I'm being left out of so many things.  People I've known for years and been friends with for just as long never really message me or try to hang out with me, even though I know that they're hanging out with other people.  Sure, probably I should try to contact them myself, but they moved away while I stayed here. So I assume they should let me know if they're back and feel like going out.  And sometimes even if we do talk online it's all ""We should hang out sometime."" but then sometime never comes.  Sorry for the rant. The point is, that unfortunately it's not that uncommon. And I'm afraid that sometimes it's just a thing that happens and we are not completely responsible for it. Of course, we could try to initiate some meetings, but that can be quite awkward if you feel like the people don't want to hang out with you.  I guess that trying to find new friends that for once won't push you to the side would be the best thing, but that's not easy either :/"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d9ejs,cupp95,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I think people lose interest in friends when they don't go out because they might feel like their connection is wavering so it's a hard balance for introverts (I am one too). It seems to me that people with close friendships are often extroverts that are game for anything.  Perhaps I need to concentrate on fewer friendships (the ones that respond more to me) and nurture those, and maybe that would work for you too :)."

I got it from etsy and it was engraved with his name and our wedding date on one side and a personalized message on the other side. He liked it a lot.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dafsg,jerzey516,9,Tue Jul 14 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"For my boyfriend I like to make him homemade things. He likes to know I took the extra time to create something, and I think it's a nice touch when it is personalized.   For our anniversary I built a treasure chest and painted it. I wrote him 50 ""open when"" letters, all of them written to be opened in different scenarios. Example being open when you're mad at me, open when you're thinking about our future, open when favorite football team loses, etc. I printed off lots of pictures of us and inserted a couple inside each letter. He loves it.   For Valentine's day I created a man bouquet for him. Just threw some of his favorite things into a beer mug.  http://imgur.com/1zCj16z"

But I think that, in of itself, illustrates how much sexism there is the way words are used - there's something a bit infantilizing about calling women ""gals"", for example. We have a hard time expressing a word that connotes an adult, capable, normal....woman. You have to wonder why.   (I'm not saying that everyone who uses other words to refer to women intends a negative connotation, I just think as a society, it's somewhat built into our vocabulary.)"

The issue is that ""female"" (and sometimes ""male"", as you've pointed out in one example; I think ""female"" is more commonly used this way, though) is used as a noun in and of itself to refer to a person, without any other defining characteristics. Not ""a female human"" or ""a female Redditor"" or ""a female underwater basket-weaver"" or what have you, just ""a female"", full-stop. What many people here are saying is that the use of ""female"" or ""male"" as a noun without any modifiers strips the person in question of any other qualities, denoting that person as being only notable for the sexual organs they possess.   Go to Twitter and search for the terms ""male"" and ""female"" and see for yourself how many times each is used as a stand-alone noun, and the context in which that happens, and you might understand a little more the discrepancy we're discussing here."

I guess it should be noted that this isn't really a response to you specifically as it is a response for anyone who thinks that women are overreacting when they ask to be called women and not females.   You are and will always be a female.   No shit. I am and will always be a human, as well, so why don't we try to include that part of me too?   If you drop this nonsense   It's not nonsense to us, though. It's not a big deal, really, but it's annoying to be dehumanized like that. To you, it might be a stupid thing to be upset about, but to us it's sort of the equivalent of just being called a ""thing with a vagina."" Imagine being called, ""a thing with a penis."" It's dumb, there is more to you than that. Female isn't specific to any species. ""Woman"" implies that ""Hey, at least you're a human being, too.""   you may even become a lady.   How can we get that far if we aren't even considered women? Christ. To be a lady, I'm pretty sure you have to be a woman first.   This mindset just undermines that great strides that females have made through out the last 100+ years.    How? How is not wanting to be a called a female undermining any of the previous work of feminists?   These type of statements really work against female equality.   Again, how? Don't you see it as unequal that men are called men and women are called female? The terms ""man"" and ""woman"" are specifically used for humans. ""Male"" and ""female"" are not. We are not asking for men to be called ""males"" because we don't want to dehumanize them. All we're asking is that we be humanized as well by being called ""women"" and opposed to being called ""females."" Is it so hard to ask for a change in vocabulary so we can feel like human beings, too?   me and my female friend are honestly cracking up at this and she 100% agrees with me.   I'm glad that it doesn't bother her. It won't bother all women, but it will bother some. The idea is that, even if it's not a big difference, it can make a difference to the women in your life who have been called ""females"" over and over to the point where they do notice it and it does annoy them. Not every woman may have these experiences, but for the ones who do, we really appreciate it when that little change of vocabulary is made.   Females like you just want to complain for the sack of complaining   It may seem that way to you, again, but it's not for us. We've experienced it so much that it absolutely gets on our nerves.    and are too lazy or dumb to actually do anything to achieve equality for all.   sigh Your entire argument is a straw-man. You never try to answer the question as to why men (and women) don't just start calling women ""women."" You just insult us for overreacting, being stupid, calling us lazy without knowing anything about us, insult us, insinuate that none of us really want true equality (which is pretty hilarious given the topic at hand), etc., etc. You don't have any good counterarguments as to why men and women can't call women ""women.""  tl;dr It's dehumanizing, it doesn't take that much effort to change your vocabulary, and the women in your life might appreciate you having the decency to recognize that they are also human beings."

Honestly reddit made me have animosity towards me being called female because when a woman is described in a derogatory way, 99% reddit will refer to them as a female.

This is not a forum for formal debate, this is a space for women to share their feelings and experiences with a subject. No one gives a flying fuck if you feel differently unless you attack and belittle those who do. I'm sure I could find an African American who doesn't give a shit if white people use the n word. I could find people who think that the n word is just a word and not harmful in any way. I could tell people that their argument is invalid because I've never seen a repeated scientific study proving that African Americans are harmed by the n word being used by white people.  But you know what? I don't use the n word. The people it refers to don't like it, and I have respect for them as human beings.  Is the word ""female"" the equivalent of the n word? Absolutely not. I just figure it might get through to you as an actual inappropriate word, since you think feminism is a joke and whatnot I figure you won't find any word that women feel is derogatory to be bad."

Reasoning: You yourself are guilty of illogical an fallacious arguments, when you offer any arguments at all.  Evidence 1: ""No normal person ever thinks that deeply about it?"" Incorrect because there obviously are people who think deeply about it. (Proof is in this thread and in the articles about it, as well as other forums.) Possibly fallacious because the tone and wording sound ad hominem, though not directly.  Evidence 2: That lovely little ad hominem attack telling your oponent that she's a disgrace to the feminist cause.  Evidence 3: ""Wow, you are a complete idiot."" Well that there is an ad hominem attack if I've ever seen one. In the opening line / ""thesis"" no less.  Evidence 4: ""Your arguments don't logically flow."" Ad hominem. No examples given other than the entirety of oponent's argument. (Lazy debating.)  Evidence 5: ""I'm saying the word female isn't derogatory. So that pretty much negates that."" Where to begin? She's saying it WASN'T derogatory at the time, so whether or not it is NOW is not a good enough counter argument. If she's wrong, prove it, don't assume your PERSONAL opinion negates her argument. (And I can think of at least 1 piece of evidence off the top of my head, and 5 different arguments as to why she may be wrong, or why that's not a good enough argument. You just chose to be lazy and not present proof or a logical argument.)  Evidence 6: ""You need to offer evidence that somehow the word female is used in a way that is sexist or whatever."" Okay. Where's your proof that it isn't? The fact that you don't like her arguments is not incontrovertible proof that you are right, contrary to what you seem to believe. A good debater would strive to find proof beyond their oponent being wrong in their own, personal opinion.  Evidence 7: ""I honestly just think you something something ad hominem something.""  Evidence 8: That lovely ad hominem attack where you present the thesis that your opponent is a ""moron.""  Conclusion: You do not know how to debate yourself (using ad hominem attacks and lazy / bad debating style where you assume your opinion that your oponent is wrong as proof you are right without any further evidence being introduced), meaning you are a hypocrite who cannot debate properly themself.  (As a side note, I have never claimed to be good at debate. I am just able to recognize blatant hypocrisy when I see it.)"

Reddit is something I occasion during my down time. People, females included, find these really small niche of things to complain about. Instead of complaining about the use of the word female, which I've never really heard used in a derogatory manner, maybe such people could donate their time helping the less fortunate among us. The fact that they spend their time crying about this only illustrates to me how self centered they actually are. Their isn't some intellectual argument here that would benefit society. It's just an idiot with a soap box. If they really cared about humanity, they would be to busy at soup kitchens rather than making an issue out of nothing that benefits no one. To call them crazy is a bit much. Naive; absolutely, border line apathetic; definitely. And what I find most disingenuous about this post and such, is that they are making up something that doesn't actually occur in a bias manner. I've never heard both sexes not be named in comparable fashions. My female friend that rofl at this last night kinda explained it better to me. Calling a ""woman"" a female ""removes"" the humanity from their identity or something like this. The fact that these female humans think that deep only means to me that that's the only deepest thing that's ever been in them. Take this shit to tweeter and stop ruining reddit. Also, if any one of these pro post people said this in public to the average person they would get laughed at. I dare any of the people that down voted me to spout such nonsense in public to male and females. Moreover, if that fallacy holds true for females, it holds true for males. What do guys think about this? Nothing, because we couldn't careless. The patriarchy that they complain about is just the dead horse they complain about to explain their short comings as a human.

I don't have a problem with it in most situations because it is easy, but I also don't usually refer to the males as guys, boys, or men in the same sentence where I refer to when as females.

Or in clinical/legal/scientific contexts, e.g. ""the patient is a 49-year-old female"" or ""the accused is a female, age 30 years, who knew the victim..."" or ""our sample consisted of 500 females with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer.""

I have no problem when it's used as an adjective for another word that is obviously human, and I think you commonly see male also used when it's not assumed to be the default gender for a word, which is a whole issue on its own. ""Male/Female athletes"" is a great example. I think most people would agree that saying men/women athletes doesn't make much sense. This also goes for male/females host, scientist, pilot, artist, and so on, at least in my opinion. Of course, we could just leave gender out, but when one wants to make that distinction, female and male seem to be okay."

Granted, they will sometimes say ""males"" as well, but since a lot of the research I see is focused on things like reducing the gap in graduate program admissions for men and women, men are taken as the default group and so it's a lot of talking about ""and then we see here the females have a..."" type of comment.

I will tolerate ""chicks"" because it's non-specific for ~15-late 20's. I could do without, but will tolerate, ""ladies"" although it's connotation suggests that it should only be used in business or formal situations for 20's-30's.

Like if I said ""chocolate chip is a type of cookie"" and you say ""nuh uh! lots of things can be chocolate chip"".   A better analogy for what you said up above would be ""chocolate refers to a type of cake specifically"".

Obviously, someone saying ""there's a lot of females here"" is not referring to the female spider in the corner and the female dog in the alley and the female bird sitting on the telephone wire. Understanding context is an important part of normal conversation.   ""chocolate refers to a type of cake specifically""   Or you could could use context clues to determine that the person saying this obviously understands that cake is not the only thing in the world ever that coulld possibly be made out of chocolate, and that they are saying (perhaps better worded, but still) that ""there are different kinds of cakes, one being chocolate, and when we work in a cake shop, and I tell you I want a slice of chocolate, you, as a fully-fuctioning adult person, should be able comprehend that I'm talking about fucking CAKE."""

As OP put it:   It's like they're describing an animal, or they're describing some kind of alien species. It feels dehumanizing and sterile.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d6qzv,ArcadiaRhodes,2,Tue Jul 14 03:31:34 2015 UTC,"This is probably the fairest and most well thought out reply I've heard on this topic. I understand the use of female as an assignation when trying not to make assumptions, which I think is a fair usage of it, but only when it's paired with the likewise 'male' assignation, rather than using 'men' or 'guys' and 'females.' In my experience the use of the word 'females' connotes all the stereotypically female things that men often complain about to the point where the word has started to grow into something of a pejorative so that I know when someone I'm speaking to says, ""I met this female yesterday ..."" or ""Females are always acting like that ..."" I can be sure that something negative is going to follow. It's this development of the assignation into a connotative negative that really bothers me."

Because obviously it's valid to hate it when men call women ""females"" like some sort of gawking idiot at a zoo, and the intent behind the use in those cases is important, but I worry about distancing ourselves from the word ""female"" to avoid the negative connotation, as it has some implications of ""I'm not like the other girls, I'm cool, like one of the guys,"" which is also problematic."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d6qzv,Healsforhugs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:48:59 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree with that last, trying to distancing oneself from femininity is not the answer. And this is not a new issue. It's just that the word 'female' is being newly brought into the fold as a negative terminology used to describe stereotypes and I'm cool with trying to nip that shit in the bud as hard as possible. It would really upset me if calling someone a 'female' started to become a slur the way people will call a woman a bitch if she exercises her opinion or power like a man would, or whore if a woman exercises her right to active sexuality. These are words that most people already know are slurs and see as slurs and can recognize are being used unfairly and as a generalization. The current and growing usage of 'female' in a negative context with the connotation that the woman in question is doing something that is a particular 'weakness' of the gender and is only present in women, could potentially be an insidious thing if we don't cut it off as it starts. It's easy to see how things could evolve from the completely impolite and recognizable slurs that are based in the female anatomy (Don't be such a pussy, dude!) to just using the word female to mean weak, cowardly, powerless. It's having that stereotype about women in general that is the root of these shifts in language and I am always support protesting a lingual shift that roots weakness in the female gender or otherwise stereotypes an entire group of people.   TL;DR - I refuse to let the term 'female' go the way of left handedness and the word sinister."

This is 100% untrue. Even people who look drop dead gorgeous can struggle with their body image. It's not about what your body looks like at all- body image is all about your mental relationship to yourself and your body.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dalw7,merediththecat,2,Wed Jul 15 22:34:46 2015 UTC,Always begin conditioning in the shower with your ends first and try to let your conditioner sit in your hair for as long as possible before you rinse it out.  And regular hair cuts.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3dalw7,Luniana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:16:49 2015 UTC,I have the same exact problems! Herbal Essences has a really good detangling spray that I use before brushing my hair. I also use a leave-in conditioner by Paul Mitchell that is a miracle for keeping my hair soft and mostly detangled all day. Also getting your hair cut regularly is really the best way to help with split ends. You can always trim your split ends one by one but that's tedious haha.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3da3e4,hogwartsishome18,5,Tue Jul 14 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"If your doctor sees no problem, then you should be ok. I used to get random discharge that color, just old blood filtering out.  If you're worried about pregnancy, take a test. And you gotta be more careful than that! Discharge like that could indicate miscarriage, but you said this has happened before so I highly doubt it. Your body just likes to clean itself out more often. Either way, you seem worried about it so it would be worth mentioning to your doctor again."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3da3e4,stop-saying-that,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:16:33 2015 UTC,Is this the first time you had it so far out from your period?   It's slightly possible it's a pregnancy symptom.  Both times I was pregnant I had discharge like you describe. It could be either implantation spotting - especially if you're two weeks out from your period as that is often ovulation time  - or it could be breakthrough bleeding which can happen during pregnancy.    Or it could be million other completely benign things... Like internal bleeding from rough sex like you said.

But some people aren't naturally demonstrative or communicative. So you compromise. I used to try to call, not get a hold of him, get upset, then he'd get upset because it's not something deliberate he was doing. So I asked him to call me when he's free. So he'll generally call between meetings and when he's on the way home.   You would be considered selfish if you forced him to go out of his way to do something for you, at great expense to him. A relationship is sometimes about compromise. Try and talk to him and work out a way to communicate at a level you're both happy with."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d86fr,sambeano,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:29:18 2015 UTC,I don't think it's accurate to label it as selfish but you might be a little demanding. You might want more affection than he is able to give you. There is nothing wrong with wanting attention but there is nothing wrong with him not being able to give you as much attention as you want.   Have you asked him if he thinks you're being too demanding?
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d5bzr,fellowfeelings,56,Mon Jul 13 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Back when I lacked confidence in my dancing, I would just find some girl on the other side of the room who seemed to know what she was doing and copy all her moves.   Every time I went clubbing I'd model myself on somebody else and each time I'd find some movement or other that I liked enough to repeat. Eventually I became confident enough to string them all together independently and became a confident dancer with a huge repertoire of stolen dance moves."

If anything, they'll try to dance with you and sort of help you or show you.   It sounds stupid, but your bf is right - just feel the music. When you let go of caring what others around you are thinking at that moment and truly allow yourself to feel the music, the dancing will come.   And not that I advocate drug use, but drugs really help me with the dancing. Or at least with the not-caring ;)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d5bzr,alickstee,13,Mon Jul 13 17:44:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't suggest drugs without trying them in a safe environment the first time. Everyone reacts slightly differently to anything that effects your brain chemistry.  I would suggest never trying a drug the first time in a huge crowd of people. Somewhere safe with someone you trust above all else for a first time would likely let you learn about the effects it has on you much safer and let you judge if you'd want to try it in a crowd of people more easily than being thrown into the situation.

Find someone friendly looking who's been doing it and taking a break, and strike up a conversation. Many are happy to show you the basics, and glowsticks/toys get passed around already, it's fairly high energy and breaks are needed. Usually I'd see 3-6 people trading off watching each other, and generally people are very friendly / social.

I haven't tried the herbal essences one, but it's because I had a friend who used it and said it wasn't great. It.may be because she and I both have thin hair that our heads are a bit pickier!

I'm glad you found a product that works for you!  I love shea moisture too, and I've got super thick frizzy wavy hair so it works well for me, but my sister has thinner and more oily hair. My mom has fine hair and shea moisture is generally too heavy for their hair, but they only noticed after using  SM for a while. My hair drinks it up though. We're chinese for reference."

And to start with the pill of the package.  So, if you're wanting a Tuesday, start with the pack's FIRST Tuesday pill.  I don't know if the brand you're using is a continual level of hormones or gradually changes through the pack.  So it's best to start at the beginning.  I mean, you would anyway.

It's kind of a shitty title, but the book itself is just full of practical perspective on our behavior.   Gottmann, the author, never gets gimmicky or makes sweeping statements about how men and women are different, yada, yada, yada. Instead, he just outlines pretty simple behaviors that people engage in that can be uplifting or destructive. Honestly, just recognizing those behaviors can bring self-awareness that makes a huge difference.   My Mom is a psychologist and this is the book she recommends to her patients."

They help you find a frame for the other person's behavior-- are you interpreting their actions correctly? Are their needs getting met? Is there a way you can meet in the middle? Etc.  So much bad stuff in people's relationships is because they misinterpret what is actually happening with their partner :(

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d70tw,Serae,2,Tue Jul 14 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"People process things differently. If she wants space, it has nothing to do with you personally. Extend the offer of a helping hand and tell her you'll be there when she needs you but don't overwhelm her more than she already is.   Sometimes people just need to take a step back to get real clarity and if you insist on taking that step with her, she might not be able to really disassociate her feelings from your advice, no matter how well-intentioned it may be."

I'm not sure if your tastes are similar to mine, or how much prep work you are looking for but, here are some of my favorite comfort recipes:  This beef stew is delicious, homey, and the closest thing to a hug that I've eaten.  Tip: instead of the 4 cubes beef bouillon and 4 cups water, use 2 cubes with 2 cups water and 2 cups of red wine (then drink the rest of the wine).  I guess soups are one of my favorite comfort foods.  This chicken noodle is quicker and easier than the beef stew.  I like to use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to make it even easier.  It freezes well too.  If you are looking for something that feels fancy but is pretty easy- treat yo' self to coconut shrimp.  This creamy garlic pasta also falls into the easy category and is so rich.  Now to desserts:  These whiskey blondies because whiskey.  These German chocolate pecan pie bars combine two classic flavors.  I've only made this once and my crust was a little hard, so maybe pre-bake it for less time.  It would be hard to go wrong with a black magic cake if chocolate is what you'd like.  I've made all of those before, so if there's any questions I'd be glad to help!  I hope things get easier and best wishes for the bar exam!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d1hxn,riverfaerie,2,Mon Jul 13 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"I think some of the great flavor of the stew comes from cooking the beef in the pan first, and that might be lost in a crockpot version.

Once I made a coconut/vanilla cake, and I toasted my own coconut flakes...like from a whole coconut.  (I'm really proud of that).  I've had some success with Williams-Sonoma desserts, but they can be a little hit or miss.  I particularly enjoy their flourless chocolate torte.  Also, bread.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d1hxn,thebankergirl,5,Mon Jul 13 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"Pasta is one of my greatest comfort foods, because any variation was a staple at my house growing up. This is by far my favorite:  Requires: 1 pound of Pasta (penne works well) Bacon 1/2 cup white wine 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream 1 or 2 can(s) of diced tomatoes (italian style preferred) Minced garlic Basil  Cook your pasta while you do this: First up, fry up that bacon. As much as you want.What you don't use you're gonna eat later, so make it all. Take some the pieces and blot them on paper towels. Shred them up into pieces and set aside.  Depending on how much bacon you made, you're gonna have a decent amount of grease in the pan. Dump some out if you have to, but make sure you have at least three tablespoons in the pan. Throw in your minced garlic (I believe the original recipe called for two cloves but I love garlic so I never use less than 3 and a half), and saute until it smells divine, like a minute.   Add the heavy cream, wine, and tomatoes. Stir. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and let it simmer until the sauce is reduced. The time for this varies, usually at least 10 minutes, but you'll know it's ready when its thick enough to coat the spoon. Season with salt/pepper/basil. Pour the sauce over your pasta and then add as much bacon as you want.  Instructions are loose/flexible because you seriously can't mess this up unless you don't reduce the sauce enough. I've used olive oil and chicken instead of bacon grease and bacon, red wine instead of white wine, no tomatoes, all of the tomatoes, only one can of tomatoes, and half-and-half plus a stick of butter instead of heavy cream, and it's always turned out great. It's rich, creamy, flavorful, and has just the right amount of tang from the tomatoes.  Happy eating, and I hope you get to feeling better."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d1hxn,alyssajones,6,Mon Jul 13 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"Pan seared steak. Go to your local butcher (a good one, not Safeway) and get one chuck eye steak. NOT a chuck roast; get a chuck eye. If they don't have chuck eye or think that's a weird question, turn around and walk out because that's not a good butcher. If they're out of chuck eye... Well I guess ask what they recommend for a pan sear.   Prep: put a cast iron skillet in the oven at 500 degrees. Leave it in there long enough for it to turn into a branding iron. Lightly oil, salt, and pepper the steak. Use an oil with a high smoke point if it's available (avocado oil works well and you can find it at costco). You can add a bit of seasoning if you like- I usually add a bit of garlic powder.   Cook: put your pan on a burner on high heat and add the steak. Cook 30-45 seconds on each side and DO NOT TOUCH it during that time. This will get a really nice crust. After you've flipped and cooked the second side, throw it in the oven for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes on each side (depending on the thickness of the steak and how long you left it on the stove). After you've cooked the second side, take the steak out and let it rest for at least 5-10 minutes.   Bonus: if you are looking for something really decadent, put the cast iron back on the stove but don't turn the stove on. Deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup of bourbon.  When the bourbon has stopped boiling, add 2 tbsp of butter. When that has melted, add an ounce of blue cheese. Stir until smooth and serve with the steak.   Recipe created by Alton Brown."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d1hxn,F0xyCle0patra,2,Mon Jul 13 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"chicken pot pie!!! especially skillet chicken pot pie.  if you have a cast iron skillet, you're gonna throw 1-2 tbsp butter into that iron, heat it up, with minced garlic, shallots, sweet onion. get it going, add chopped carrots. then add chicken stock and heavy cream, and some seasoning (thyme, salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp of soy sauce, a few tsp of Worstichire (sp?) sauce). You throw in some whole chicken breasts and cook em until theyre almost fully cooked. Take em out and shred em. Reduce the sauce and everything. Sometimes if you're getting close but its not going fast enough and you are worried about overcooking the veggies, throw in flour and mix until it gets thick enough. Then you throw the shredded chicken back in with fresh or frozen peas. Have a pie crust (just the top part) ready to go on top--can either be store bought or home made, i prefer to make it myself because the store ones are too sweet in my opinion. have that crust already baked a bit in the oven (just enough to get it turning golden colored). Throw it on top. Throw the entire skillet with the crust on top into the oven to finish it off. Shouldnt be in there long because everyhing is really already cooked. I keep it in there for like 10 mins or less depending.  Sorry I did very rough approximations it just depends on the size of your skillet and how much food you want to make. For my usual one I do 1 cup chicken stock and 1/3 cup heavy cream, so that gives you an idea of the ratio. And that's for kind of a medium-large cast iron skillet. It makes a pie big enough for 4 people to have a decently big serving. It is my ultimate comfort food. Rather simple, tasty, fulfilling  feel better!"

My faves are:   Sweet Potato Fries; cut up as many sweet potato fries as you want into frie shapes (try to keep them all about the same size) put some oil,  paprika, flour, salt and pepper in a bag or bowl and mix the fries in this so that they're completely covered. Cook for until edges are brown at 200C Dough Balls, kinda long but soooooo delicious,  Chocolate CupCakes Fudge Brownies Tomato Soup with grilled Cheese; you need an onion, 2 gloves of garlic minced, olive oil, a can of crushed tomatoes a can/tube fo pureed tomato ,stock cube thingys, water, 'erbs, a cup of red wine can skip if you must but it really improves the taste imo. Heat 2 tbspoons of oil in a pot. add onions, saute until translucent, season with salt & pepper to taste, add garlic cook for only a minute or so so it doesn't burn. add the red wine let it cook down for 2 or so minutes, then add in the can of ground tomatoes, and half your tube of tomato paste (you can add in more if you wish but it made the taste too strong for me) stir well. Then add in about 600ml of warm water.  (if your using  dry stock cube dilute it in the water as per the cubes instructions more or less water if necessary. I use the jelly stock cubes so i just plop it in to the pot after pouring the water in. Mix well. Season with basil, oregano, chilli, pepper salt whatever you want. Mix it again make sure everything is well incorporated. Let the soup come to a boil then leave it on a medium-low heat for like 30 mins, then eat. :)   Lazy bacon breadsticks; all you need is ready made puff pastry and bacon. Cut the pastry just a half centimeter thinner than your bacon, slap your bacon on top of your pastry then gently roll one corner until its tightly twisted and keep rolling until it's all twisted nicely. PRess on the bread stick gently so it keeps its shape then pop them in a pre heated oven at 180C or whatever you like for about 10 minutes, it should look golden brown."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d1hxn,Rosydoodles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"My favorite comfort food is baked chicken with mushroom rice. It's really simple but SO GOOD.  What you need: 1 chicken breast with skin on it (I like dark meat so I use thighs or 2-3 legs)  2-3 tsp butter  1/2 cup rice  1/2 water  1 can of cream of mushroom soup (Campbell's is good. You can also substitute with 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup milk. If you sub this way, cut out the other 1/2 cup of water.)  1-2 stalks of celery, chopped  5-6 large white mushrooms, sliced  Salt, Pepper, Garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika  Preheat oven to 425F.   At the bottom of a non-stick baking dish, put the rice, the can of mushroom soup, and 1/2 cup of water. Put the celery and mushrooms on top of the rice-soup mixture. Add a couple shakes of salt and pepper and onion powder. Plop in a couple pats of butter for good measure. Then on top of the rice, gently place your chicken. If it's a thick breast you want to definitely butterfly it, pound it, or cut it in half (otherwise it takes a lifetime to cook). Season the chicken with salt, pepper, 1-2 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of paprika. Top with a big ol' pat of butter. Extra points if you shove it under the skin so it gets all crispy.  Throw that shit in the oven for an hour for a breast, 45min for legs/thighs. Enjoy with a delicious salad or corn or peas or whatever delicious vegetable you like.  Hope you feel better soon!!"

This will save you the hassle of trying to find 1 cup from the kitchen box, 1 toothbrush from the washroom box, etc. Also pack stuff according to where you will unpack it. For example, if your shower towels used to be in the washroom but will be stored in the hallway closet at your new place, then pack your towels with all the other stuff that will be in the hallway closet (linens and such), rather than packing it with the washroom stuff."

Make sure you have hand sanitizer, though you might want to look into hand soap that's safe to use at a campsite if there's a water source. I hate the feeling of sanitizer on my hands and would always rather just wash with soap and water. Also make sure you have shoes like flip-flops that are easy to slip on and off!

Squatting is the more natural and comfortable way to poop and you get a nice view of the outdoors while you're at it. Keep in mind that wipes are not Porto safe. Only single-ply toilet paper is safe to throw in Porto potties. You may not care as you aren't the one having to pump the potties; but apparently wipes clog the pumper machine and often cause a poo spray for the pumper. Poo karma is the worst kind of karma. Otherwise, just close your eyes, don't breathe through your nose and have a way to wash your hands afterwards."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,PixelArmy,49,Sun Jul 12 07:52:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's time to sit down and have a long conversation about this. Tell him that you've been wanting to marry him for a while, and that you thought he wanted to marry you too. Tell him you feel like you two have been ready for that step, tell him that it's important to you. And then let him talk.  No more hinting on your end about your last name, and no more silence on his end. Be direct about what you want, and then make sure he communicates his feelings back. Don't let him shrug it off, and make sure you end the conversation on a concrete note. The note might be ""I just don't think I'm ready to get married, and I don't know when I will be."" Or it might be ""Once X life event happens, I will be ready."" Or maybe ""I've got the ring and I have been worried about finding the right time, but I will stop worrying and figure it out.""  With your family/friends: ""Hey, please stop asking about that. I promise that if there are any developments on that front, you'll be the first to know."" And then if they keep asking, cut the visit/phone call short and remind them that you asked them not to bother you about that. If they sat down and thought for half a minute, they would realize that they're potentially exacerbating a painful situation for you--there's no excuse for them to continue doing this after you set boundaries.  Good luck. I hope you feel better."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,not_rachel,7,Sun Jul 12 12:41:41 2015 UTC,"We've had a couple of ""point blank"" conversions where I do ask him ""is this something in our future, is this something you want?"" and he has told me yes... but then he still ""teases"" me by making comments about eloping or a courthouse marriage, I start looking up information and it isn't brought up again.  I guess the issue for me is that I KNOW he wants to get married, he has told me that several times, but I wish he'd take a little more initiative. A proposal makes his intentions very clear; making passing comments about a courthouse wedding and not bringing it up again doesn't."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,Perceptivestudent,29,Sun Jul 12 13:46:13 2015 UTC,"Please, please don't have kids with him right now. What worries me is that, since he's stalling this proposal so much, he'll stall the wedding even more. Don't do it until you're married. Engaged doesn't count. He is not making the commitment, for whatever reason, and he's hiding that reason from you. This is a bad, messy relationship in the making. Be strong, stand up for what you want, and stick it to him.   I've been in your place before. It DOES NOT get better, I promise you. When I was in my shitty relationship, the only thing that kept me sane and kept me from giving in was ""He can SAY whatever he wants, but ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS"" He's been saying he wants to get married, but his actions are saying the exact opposite. Stop listening to his mouth. Start listening to his actions. I'm begging you. Do something about it before it gets worse, because it always does."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,JustCallMeNancy,166,Mon Jul 13 18:04:33 2015 UTC,DO NOT have a kid with someone who is unwilling to marry you. There's problems here and a baby will only make them worse.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,zazzlekdazzle,47,Sun Jul 12 09:51:07 2015 UTC,"First thing I thought. Stop TTC until you work this out.  It sounds like marriage is a deal-breaker for you, so why have a child with him? If being married is important to you, and it is important to you the person you are with makes that commitment to you, then put it on the table. Be willing to walk away and find someone who wants the same commitment. 30 is too young to settle."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,NotAResponsibleHuman,3,Sun Jul 12 12:22:13 2015 UTC,"That's what I originally told him, but after a year or two with no proposal, I'm not getting any younger. My sisters are popping out kids which makes the baby fever even worse (and not just for me, for him, too!!!! He makes comments ALL THE TIME!). I worry that I'll be waiting forever for a proposal, and I don't want to have young kids when I'm 40."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,zazzlekdazzle,58,Sun Jul 12 13:49:09 2015 UTC,Then it's time to go to a couples counselor and find out if you two are really in the same place. And if you aren't in the same place then a timeline to get there or breakup.   Tossing a baby into the mix is just a really seriously bad idea and if he's got commitment issues now what is it going to be like when a baby puts your relationship on expert mode?
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,riverfaerie,3,Sun Jul 12 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"While I agree something needs to be addressed and a counselor would be a great start, I unfortunately find it hard to believe someone who doesn't want the attention of marriage will agree to the attention of counseling.  I'm not saying that is an excuse, however.  OP may end up in the same spot with a guy not wanting to get married OR go to a counselor and will now have another concern on her hands.  Maybe that is where this will end anyway, but if he doesn't agree to this, I still think OP should go to counseling herself.  It does Not mean something is wrong with you, it's just a way to come to terms with your situation and maybe find another solution tailored specifically to your situation."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,notovertonight,27,Sun Jul 12 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if this sounds harsh, but this is not a good excuse.  It's worth it to take out a loan and spend $5000 to freeze your eggs (and clinics hook you up with low interest loans for this sort of thing) rather than attach your life to someone if you are feeling unsure."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,ailweni,4,Sun Jul 12 14:54:01 2015 UTC,Good advise.  I wish someone had mentioned freezing eggs to me when I was thirty (or younger) and my then fiancé wasn't ready (school).  Contemplating it now at 34 (and single)...

Do it.   Quit waiting around for the proposal. It'll happen organically or not, but you can't force it, or pressure someone into it. If you feel you have to press for it, something is fundamentally wrong.  As far as conception, we all know that a child is NOT. a reason to get married.   You may need to live apart for a while, and re-evaluate why you are together. It's easy to get comfortable and complacent while living together, and stay habitually rather than because you have a good relationship. So, don't answer me, but take some time and think -- why am I with this person? Is the reason because it is financially better, because it is comfortable, because I am scared to be on my own? If any of those apply, it's time for you to spend some quality time alone with yourself.   You both have to examine why you want to be together. I really do think some time apart will help that immensely."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,LadyTarTar,21,Sun Jul 12 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"Why didn't you change your last name after the divorce? It may seem like a hassle to go through that only to have to change it again down the line, but I think it would be a good idea. It's possible he sees it as a reminder of your relationship with your ex and feels like part of you hasn't totally let that go. Or maybe he feels pressured into proposing just  so you'll change your name. Like you're using it as a bargaining chip. To him, it might say ""Hey see this reminder of my life with another man? I'm going to keep it unless you marry me."" It's kind of a losing battle for him because there's no right way to answer that. If he says ""Okay I'll propose"" then it's like he's just doing it because he was threatened, if he says ""Change it back to your maiden name"" it's like he's telling you he doesn't want to marry you. Maybe he does but he doesn't want it to be done because it's ""expected"" of him. Same goes with the friends ""having a talk with him"". It's just not their business and frankly I'd be pretty frustrated if I had people all over putting pressure on me to make a life changing decision.   That said, you deserve to know if this relationship that you're committing yourself to is at the stage you think it's at. And you deserve to be with someone who wants the same things. So to that, I say have one last conversation with him. Be civil, be understanding, and be open to hearing how he really feels. Even if it's not what you want to hear. Tell him that you'll stop asking, you'll stop insinuating it's up to him to change your name, your friends will stop bugging him, but you need to know right now if this relationship is on the path towards marriage and if he wants the same things. Tell him it's okay if it doesn't happen tomorrow, because you're committed to him, not a piece of paper but you just need to know if you're on the same page. Tell him that eventually you want a family, and there's no need to rush into it but you deserve to know if he wants the same things, and more importantly, if he wants them with you. If he does, great. Ask him for what an ideal time frame would be. Does he want a few more years of being child free? Maybe he wants marriage but doesn't want a wedding? These are important questions to ask. After you have this conversation, if you still want the same things then let him figure it out on his own about the how and when. Stop the hints. And most importantly, change your name back. It's a mild inconvenience on your part and it's huge gesture symbolically. Clearing your ex husbands name (and life) from your life is not his battle and pressuring him to change it when you hate it is not fair. It should have been changed 4 years ago. And the fact that it wasn't can say many things to him, none of which would be good."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,hollywoodshowbox,0,Sun Jul 12 09:33:16 2015 UTC,"Why didn't you change your last name after the divorce?    Because I was naive in thinking that it would be a hassle to change back my name on all of my financial stuff. I'm not saying it is a great excuse but that's my reason, and to change your name back without a divorce decree in my county is a huge hassle apparently where you have to petition in front of a judge, etc. I'm not saying it wouldn't be worth it, but I haven't a clue where to start, and if I'm being honest I don't want to change my name only to have him propose and have to change it again shortly after (without the hassle).  To clarify, I have never intentionally pressured him by using the last name as a bargaining chip to marry me. We have had several conversions about this, ranging from all time frames of our relationship, and every time he says that yes, this is something he wants. If he brings it up, I may make a comment, but I've never said ""I hate my name, you should marry me so I can change it.""  I ask point blank, I don't want you to feel obligated to do this just because you think it's what I want and it'll make me happy, but is this something YOU want? I just need to know if this is something in our future. He has always answered yes. I don't give a time frame because again I don't want him to feel pressured... but it's been years now."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,zazzlekdazzle,71,Sun Jul 12 13:37:43 2015 UTC,K so like... propose to him?  Maybe he just sucks at making the first move and he keeps over thinking it.   And if he says no... then therapy time. Or time for some long hard conversations.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,maniacal-seahorse,30,Sun Jul 12 10:35:14 2015 UTC,"Indeed, why should he be the one that proposes? You should be able to talk about such things together. The relationship just seems a bit shallow/childish if you can't talk about these subjects."

Not only are you short-changing yourself, but you are also sending him mixed signals.    If BOTH of you are happy with the current status of your relationship -- and I don't think you're as happy as you say you are, especially if you ""don't have the balls"" to leave him -- then there is no issue and you both need to stop talking about marriage, even in fun.    You are worth more than the run around he's giving you, and you should think about whether or not you really want to marry someone who repeatedly disregards your feelings.  Furthermore, marriages that begin with ultimatums rarely work out in the long run, so you need to do some serious soul searching and decide what YOU really want.  You DESERVE to have what YOU want, and do not settle for anything less."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czv52,Bear_Mustache,10,Sun Jul 12 19:33:43 2015 UTC,"I've read a lot of your replies here and here is what I advise: slow down, don't rush, decide what you really want and why, and then pursue it.  One thing that comes across is that you seem like you are in a bit of a rush.  I know you guys have been together for a long time, but it seems like you both passed a goalpost somewhere along the way and since then things have not been progressing at the pace you want. You need to give it some serious thought about whether this is really the man you want to link your life to or whether you are just in such a rush to have such a link that he is becoming less important in the equation.    I suggest you spend some time in the realm of other fantasy scenarios -- one where you are a single mother by choice, one where you are single and childfree by choice, one where you are single for a few more years and then meet and fall in love with a man who is divorced with two teenage children, etc.  Think of how you would build you life with each of these alternative routes that many women take and find rewarding.  I don't mean an afternoon, take a lot of time to do this.  Talk to, and find articles about, women who have made rewarding lives without marriage and 2 kids by 35 -- there are lot of them out there.  Think about all the things you could still do with your life and your dreams if you had three or four more years free of partnership and kids.  The reason I am saying this is because, from what you are writing here, you seem to see the only alternative to marrying this man, having babies with him, and spending the rest of your life together is childless, lonely oblivion.   Nobody finds it romantic to be pursued because you are the next best option from soul-crushing loneliness.  Explore your life and your options (in your mind) and come back to him as a true choice, your best option from a lot of other good ones.  Or not.  Or don't go back to him, and make that new life.  And tell your sisters and your friends who have made their bargains with life to settle with what they have so they can have a family on their chosen timeline not to force their decisions on you.  If you do decide he is what you want given these other options, then think of why and take him out for a nice dinner -- a quiet place with good food, good service, have some wine -- and tell him.  Tell him you want to marry him and why, how, and when.  Don't tell him like you are dictating it to him, but taking him and his wishes into account.  Tell him you don't need a big wedding or a romantic proposal or big a ring.  You just want him and his love in your life, and to make it legal."

Everyone is different, but I was with a man who acted this way too, back when I was 18-23. He never intended on marrying me. If he's like my ex, and I certainly don't know him at all but he sure acts like he doesn't actually want to get married, if I were you, I'd break up and move on. Don't get pregnant, take it from me (single mom, age 33), dating in your 30s with a child is very difficult."

Next time he says ""Let's go to the courthouse,"" say yes. My boyfriend of 6-7 years hates the idea of a wedding, but has no problem if we just eloped or went to the courthouse, knowing full well that I would eventually enjoy a wedding ceremony down the line. Separating marriage from the wedding has made him feel sooooo much more comfortable with it, because he hates formal parties. We're not married yet, and have no pans to tie the knot on paper anytime soon, but then again, it's no big deal to us at the moment because we're focusing on life. We probably won't get married for another 5-10 years anyway. That's a total of over 15 years together with no marriage, and you two have only been together for 4 years. Give it time, or propose to him."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d2l07,mayfairflower,3,Mon Jul 13 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"I got an IUD a couple of months ago, I switched from the shot to it. I hadn't had a period in 7 years on the shot. And surprise, I had my first period this week in years. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I knew it was a possibility. Upsides, it lasts for up to 10 years depending on which one you get and you get pregnant almost immediately after removal if that's what you want to do. That's why I switch, depo can take over a year to wear off and my fiance and I are looking at starting our family in a few years, and I am horrible with pills. I have to take them for a heart condition and other stuff and I did not want another pill to take."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d2l07,renee_nevermore,2,Mon Jul 13 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"I have the Skyla IUD (designed for younger, nulliparous women).    I had an uncommon insertion experience which made me rather uncomfortable for the first two weeks (no pain killers from doc, then got an infection that sent me to the ER for antibiotics - again, really uncommon), but since then I've had a breeze of IUD ownership. I was on the pill for 3 years prior to my IUD, and since insertion about 9-10 months ago I haven't had a period at all (if you don't count stressing myself out until I bled... but that's my fault).   Ask your gyno what kind of pain killer and how much you'll want to take prior to your appointment. Some women have very little pain, for some it's more uncomfortable, so it's good to have some aspirin or something in your system just in case. Do take the day off in case you are a bit sore/tender. Some women have periods with the IUD, some have lighter and shorter periods, and some have none at all. It's totally up to chance which woman you are.   Have someone you love/trust take you home after, too, in case the insertion is painful, so you don't have to drive home yourself (I did, and I was 30 minutes away and in great pain... not fun.)    The IUD strings will be relatively long (not enough to hang out from your vagina, but long enough to feel of you reach inside yourself and locate your cervix) when you first get it put in, but they will soften over time and just hang out behind your cervix out of the way. If you or your partner are poked by the strings you can choose to have them cut shorter, but sometimes that makes them more pokey, it's a balance.     After insertion, don't reach into your vagina for a couple days afterwards (to prevent infection), but once you're all good you'll wanna check every month or so to make sure you can still feel the strings inside you (so it doesn't shift or eject).     I love my IUD because it means I'm baby-free for 3 years, and I have no pills or periods to worry about at all. It's beautiful. My partner is larger, so some positions are more uncomfortable now than before, but with an average partner it may not be an issue. My only complaint is that I have developed infrequent ovarian cysts (which is possible on any birth control, and usually a non-issue except for some mild discomfort). They're annoying, but not crippling, and it's still worth it to have no periods or children, and they're uncommon so you might have no issues whatsoever.    tl;dr It's low maintenance! Just in case: Have painkillers and the day off when you get it inserted. Enjoy your years of pregnancy protection."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d2l07,AlaskanFeesh,2,Mon Jul 13 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely get the copper IUD, chances are the progesterone from the hormonal IUD will give you the same annoying, irregular periods as Nexplanon did."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d2l07,DancingDraft,2,Mon Jul 13 04:48:19 2015 UTC,Last month I had a copper IUD implanted. I chose this because I didn't want hormones and I also didn't want to lose my period like girls do on the Mirena (although for some that's a huge benefit). Just finished my first period with the copper IUD; it was a little heavier and cramps were fractionally more frequent but in the end I'd say it's worth it. Pain from the implant was about 3/10 and the pain increased to about 6/10 later in the day. But recovery time took 24 hours; I went on a four hour walk with a friend two days after it was implanted. I'd recommend it.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d2l07,alongstrangetrip,2,Mon Jul 13 07:20:26 2015 UTC,"My sister got the IUD (Mirena) implanted about 4 months ago and has not had a great experience. For the first week after it was implanted, she was in a lot of pain from cramps. Then the cramps went away, but she got her period, full force, about a week later. Her mood swings have been all over the place. One minute, she's laughing, the next she's pissed off at the world. She hoping to get it removed this week.  My understanding is that this is fairly rare for IUD users. Although my sister has always been a bit more moody than most, particularly around her period, the hormones in this particular IUD definitely intensified her mood swings. She also has a fairly high pain tolerance (she once had a golf ball size cyst in one of her ovaries and didn't really notice it except for minor cramps that never went away), so the fact that she was actively complaining about her cramps says a lot to me. I don't want to recommend you not to get the IUD, but do your research and talk to both your doctor and a gyno before you decide what you want to go with."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d2l07,BookLover24,2,Mon Jul 13 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"I've had a Mirena (like the Skyla it has hormones) since Feburary; I'd been on the pill for about 14 years previously but wanted something even more reliable and not have to worry about taking something at the same time every day, even though I never really forgot my pill.   Insertion sucked; lots of cramping, some nausea. But that passed after a few hours. Definitely get someone to drive you home and lay low for the rest of the day. A hot pack, pizza and Netflix helped.   I've had some irregular spotting and periods. I never had period cramps on the pill, but I sometimes get very mild cramps now. My sex drive is higher (yay!) and at most I get a bit of spotting a couple days/month. Those are both 'wins' in my book.   Basically: Insertion sucks, had a few months of cramping/spotting, occasional before my period (which is really just a couple days of spotting), but 10/10 would do it again. I don't have or want kids and don't need to think about birth control for 5 years. I love it!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d2l07,wickedweasel19,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"I've had my Mirena for about half a year now and it's the best.  The first time I had my period after insertion, I freaked out. My gyno cut the strings pretty long, and they almost hung out of my vagina the first two days, low enough that I could feel it. I didn't know, but your cervix hangs really low during your period, so it's pretty common to have to get your strings cut again."

Everyone assures me I look fine and looking back at pictures I'm not mad about what I see."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d22bx,MajorMuffinCakes,2,Sun Jul 12 22:10:47 2015 UTC,It could be the shape of the dress.  This dress shape would not flatter my figure because I have hips and slightly wider ribs.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d22bx,MajorMuffinCakes,2,Sun Jul 12 22:34:04 2015 UTC,Do you find wearing a jacket or something over the dress balances out the fullness?

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d22bx,AideenMongan,2,Mon Jul 13 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"Well, spaghetti straps tend to make broad shoulders look a bit unflattering. I have broad shoulders and I personally hate it, so I tend to avoid wearing thin strapped dresses or tops since they accentuate the broadness.   A good tip if you have broad shoulders is to wear thicker strapped tops or dresses,  (it balances out the shape of everything and makes it all look symmetric) scoop or V neck tops or dresses also look really nice.   If that isn't that, you may have a short torso, which can make some things not as flattering as they could be. Or you could have a long torso which can also make some things unflattering. But like another comment said, it could just be that you need heels. Some dresses look completely off if you don't have heels on."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3d27yi,VoldysGoneMoldyYo,4,Sun Jul 12 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"Last year when I was having a school day that lasted about 12 hours (with two bigger breaks at inconvenient times for lunch) so sometimes I would bring a little container with regular lunch and I just ate it at room temperature. So once I had a risotto, then I had chicken (cut into tiny pieces) with rice. It usually lasted pretty well throughout the day. I kept it in fridge overnight which probably kept it a bit cold for a few hours, but by the time I was eating it, it wasn't too cold.  Sure, it wasn't the best thing I could imagine for lunch, but it worked.  And of course you may try some regular lunches to go such as sandwiches, all kinds of pastry, maybe some salads.  It really depends on what you like and how much you can carry with you."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cytm9,AnnaBare,10,Sun Jul 12 01:38:53 2015 UTC,"How exactly do these work? Is it adhesive? If so, wouldn't the adhesive sorely become less sticky? Also, do they give enough support?"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cytm9,rvtjess,3,Sun Jul 12 03:21:33 2015 UTC,"It is adhesive. I've had mine for about 6 years, and it's no less sticky.

Too bad, because I'd recommend it to everyone.   I will say that the support is good but not amazing. I am not very chesty, so I don't need a whole heck of a lot of support. Any busty ladies here who have this bra that can chime in? For me, it provides enough support, but I'm a 32B."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cytm9,sympathyboner,3,Sun Jul 12 07:58:59 2015 UTC,They make them up to triple D's... Am I way too hopeful in wishing that my DDs could be held up by a half-bra? :( even a regular strapless bra destroys my chest because they have to make them so tight to support the twins.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cytm9,AnnaBare,5,Sun Jul 12 06:12:10 2015 UTC,"If you're actually a properly-fitted DD (and maybe under a 34/36 band), then I think they'd have a pretty good chance of working because properly-fitted DD cups aren't actually that big of a proportion - all these ladies here have DD cups with various band sizes! However, if you struggle with strapless bras and you feel you look different/bigger to the BraBandProject pictures of your size (select your band size in the left menu to see if there are any examples) then there is probably a better size out there for you. I'm a 28G and have no issues with my strapless bra, once I found one that I liked the look of! Check /r/abrathatfits and see what you measure as :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cytm9,patchgrrl,2,Sun Jul 12 10:06:12 2015 UTC,"Eh...You may be too hopeful with this. I wish I could answer for sure, but I'm a 32B and the support is sufficient. I'd say try one out and return it if it doesn't work.  And when you fit it, bend over so your ladies hang down. Then stick the cups (separately) on the outer and lower portion of each breast. Then clip them together. I find that method of application gives the most support and cleavage."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3czgv4,macellaria,2,Sun Jul 12 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"I used to have the same problem. Make sure you stick a pin through the holes near the top so that they are clear, insert the cup at basically 90° or as close to it as you can, try not to insert it pointing up towards you at all. Once in keep spinning the cup until it feels completely round, if it feels like it's bent at all its not completely open or the cup has been inserted at an odd angle.  I find that pushing the cup deeper into me and then spinning while pulling it closer to out of me works well to get it open.  Keep trying until you find something that works! It took me like 4 months to get it correctly each time, but it's very very worth it once you get it."

It's been happening for about 6 months and I've had it for 6 years with no problems prior. For me it happens when I have sex about 50 percent of the time. It's starting to frustrate me so I'm going to the doc. I'm wondering if it's some how not in the correct position and irritating things when I have sex. And it's not even rough sex. I mean I've had it so long now with no issues until now. The only thing for me that maybe changes things was I've had the diva cup stuck a few times on my cervix so I'm wondering if it misplaced it somehow
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cy2kp,oliviagailz,2,Sat Jul 11 20:33:33 2015 UTC,"I've not heard of it before but after looking up before and after pictures, I may be interested. I have relatively straight hair with some wave but I have a lot of it and it's...puffy? Like it doesn't lay flat, it's almost like each strand of hair is trying to repel the one near it. Wonder if this would do much for me"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cy2kp,stargirl142,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"That's how mine is naturally. The puffiness is because of the wave. Really, if your hair is even kind of wavy/curly you should treat it like curly hair, meaning lots of moisture and anti frizz products. Most importantly, NO TOUCHING OR BRUSHING. At least when you're trying to get it to lie flat."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,caterpillarbutterfly,32,Sat Jul 11 02:56:04 2015 UTC,"You realize that anyone inconsiderate enough to not even dignify you with a response isn't going to be a very thoughtful or considerate partner, and be glad you got a glimpse of insight at his personality now before things got more serious tbh. You deserve respect, and acknowledging your request is literally the least he can do."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,emmynine,4,Sat Jul 11 04:26:52 2015 UTC,Thank you. I realize it. But I guess it just takes a second to sink in. Especially when it seemed we got along well.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,charcoalslam,7,Sat Jul 11 15:00:35 2015 UTC,"All that's posted is great advice but what I do is paint my nails, paint my toes, put on a cute outfit, and then go out with my friends. Hell, even having a night in with my friends works. It reminds me that this isn't the end of my life, there are people who think I'm awesome. So what if this guy wasn't one of them. Fuck 'em."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,charcoalslam,3,Sat Jul 11 15:02:59 2015 UTC,Hmmm that does sound like fun. I'll put on nice make up wear something fun and go out tonight

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,kanooka,5,Sat Jul 11 17:25:25 2015 UTC,"When I was young, I dealt with it by NOT thinking of it as rejection.  It's like fishing - you can cast bait all day but that's no guarantee you're going to get a bite, or that if you do, you'll end up catching a fish worth keeping.  That shouldn't make you hate yourself, or hate fish in general.  Also, lets just take a moment to think about how fucking great it is that you had the confidence to ask a person out.  It is SO much easier to never take that chance.  Good on you for taking the risk.  Your reward is hopefully going to be that next time, it won't feel so risky!  You've been ignored and survived it.  You're awesome!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,kanooka,5,Sat Jul 11 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"Everyone has given you pretty good advice.  Here's my advice - next time ask a guy out face to face rather than text message.  That way you'll get a clear response, either way. They can't just pretend ""Oh, i never got your text!"" which is what I guarantee he'll say when you next see him if you ever ask about it (which i don't necessarily advocate, unless you're super confident).   I'm a very verbal person in my relationships though - if i like someone, they're gonna know, cause i'm going to straight up tell them.  if i'm in a relationship and have a problem, they're gonna know.  cause i'll say we've got a problem here."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,Sphinxia,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:37 2015 UTC,"We don't see each other often. And unless we for some reason run intoeach other this summer, I probably won't see him again until October. I thought of calling, but it took me a bizzillion hours to just press send on a text. I stutter when nervous so I'm not sure he would've understood me had I called. I'm working on the whole being straight forward thing."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,EverydayCait,3,Sat Jul 11 18:17:17 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to sound all judgy mcjudgerson, just attempting to give a little advice to make it so you don't have the whole gut-wrenching anxiety of ""did he ignore me, or just not see my text, or why hasn't he responded yet"" - cause I HATE that.    I totally understand the anxiety issue.  Next time drink a glass of wine before calling! You'll be just a little less prone to anxiety and it might help you out. :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,thirdknife,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:21:54 2015 UTC,I understand. I appreciate the advice. I'll take the advice in consideration next time.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,PembrdWelshCorgi,5,Sat Jul 11 19:16:15 2015 UTC,"I kind of wonder if you really are upset about the rejection in general (which is fine, any kind of rejection is not a pleasant feeling) and are just deciding that those feelings are only happening because he ignored you. I can't put a finger on why, but honestly I'm not sure if it really matters. Your feelings are hurt, and you want advice on getting over it.  You seem to already be aware that it's no fun to be with someone who isn't interested in you. That's really the important part. Trying to date someone isn't as enthusiastic about you as you are about them just can't turn out well.   It also hasn't been that long since you messaged him. Long enough that he's probably seen the message. I would think it's possible that he saw it and wanted to think about how to respond - and then forgot or has just been unsure how to proceed and anxious about it. Neither of those is really a good excuse for ignoring you for a day when you asked a difficult and important question, but I'll say he might not have been deliberately ignoring you or trying to hurt you.  You asked how to feel better. You're on the right track. You know now that it wasn't meant to be. If that feels worse than you thought it would, take a little while to be sad about it - have ice cream or wine, or go out with your other friends - and then continue with your life while looking for potential partners who are enthusiastic and interested enough to respond to your messages, because they're the ones who are worth your time!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,bamboombango,3,Sat Jul 11 06:25:32 2015 UTC,"This. Do you really want to be with someone who ignores your texts, or do you want to be with someone who actually wants to talk to you? Rejection sucks, especially when it's passive rather than a hard no, but it's an easy way to rule out the guys that aren't worth your time."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cvhfy,sarautu,2,Sat Jul 11 09:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with rejection. I've been rejected before. It just seems like ignoring is a lack of any respect at all for the person. But you're right. I'll try to not get angry and give the benefit of the doubt, more to relax my mind. I'll relax today and do things to get my mind off it"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,chnb,59,Fri Jul 10 08:51:13 2015 UTC,"Going through a break up is tough. There are feelings involved so no matter what happens someone gets hurt. Being told by someone you care for that they don't like your personality, which basically makes up everything special about you, can suck. You do deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are and remember that your whole self-worth doesn’t have to be wrapped up in whether or not someone likes you and wants to date you. Just because one person dislikes your personality doesn't mean you will never find someone who does. Being rejected might sting at first, but it also allows other opportunities to come into your life and can give you time to focus on your self and all the other great things going on in your life :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,letsgetlostinnature,146,Fri Jul 10 09:09:50 2015 UTC,"Ditch his lame ass.  There is someone out there that is going to love your personality.  Who is going to think you are the most amazing, funny, brilliant, beautiful person that they have ever met!!  You have to go through a lot of rejects before you find that person.  Women take it very personally when someone doesn't like us but what we really need to do is just say ""Wow!  Bullet dodged!"" and go find that one person who loves us like crazy.  Deep down, if you really think about it, there is probably a shit ton of stuff that you don't like about this guy.  He's not the one.  He is wasting your time.    I think it all boils down to the fact that most of us need an outside source to confirm our self worth.  So when this happens the person is taking that confirmation away from us.  Our self worth has to come from within.  If he looks at you and says that, you should honestly be able to say ""Bitch, get out my house then"" and move on.  You got shit to do now, because Mr. Right isn't delivered by Fed Ex."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,Silvercelt,8,Fri Jul 10 11:46:46 2015 UTC,This is the pep talk I needed.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,Silvercelt,7,Sat Jul 11 00:58:36 2015 UTC,Awesome!  You go out and find someone that is crazy (in a good way) about you and will treat you like you are the only person that could ever be by his side!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,Silvercelt,7,Sat Jul 11 00:08:44 2015 UTC,"Very important point about time - its rthe one thing we can never have enough of, and don't appreciate how precious it is until it's on short supply.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,goneharolding,33,Fri Jul 10 13:05:55 2015 UTC,"Been there! Just finally dumped mine after 7 years of that crap, and he's still confused! Lol I mean, of course there were many times when we got along, but then when he was in a bad mood (holy crap can that man do a bad mood!) suddenly I was a slob, my voice was annoying, on and on. I really think he doesn't understand just how nasty he gets, he keeps trying to play the 'But I was so depreeeeesssssed, you don't understand!' card. Thing is, after a while it just doesn't matter /why/ you're abusing someone, something just needs to be done about it. He wouldn't see a therapist with me, and he couldn't seem to understand that not everything I do is about him.  It was hard but I keep finding new reasons to be glad I finally did it. You do deserve better! Set yourself free."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,SamanthaRobot,30,Fri Jul 10 12:42:16 2015 UTC,"Just try to think of it like this: people are simple puzzle pieces. Sometimes you are totally incompatible, sometimes you can pound your fist and jam them together enough to make them a decent fit, and sometimes the pieces click together in a very exciting and satisfying way.  When you click, you treasure each other. You are both so excited to have discovered the right piece. Even eight years down the line, you should be laying in bed and if the thought crosses your mind you should be able to easily smirk at the thought that you found something so good.  Dont waste your time pounding a piece of a puzzle together, you deserve to feel cherished."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,lurkerish,8,Fri Jul 10 13:58:18 2015 UTC,"This is such a perfect analogy. I think we try so hard to be with someone and we justify that it's working because we're putting some much work into it. It took me a minute to realize that relationships don't always have to be so hard. When you find the right puzzle piece, everything clicks and the work doesn't turn into resentment."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,awkwardmumbles,6,Fri Jul 10 14:49:55 2015 UTC,This made me smile. Going to go tell my boyfriend he's the perfect puzzle piece.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,fellowfeelings,4,Fri Jul 10 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"This is so great. You just put into words exactly how I feel about my husband. We've been together for over 10 years, since we were 16, and I still feel like we fit perfectly together. Great analogy."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,riverfaerie,16,Fri Jul 10 19:19:55 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I felt with my previous boyfriend. I had low self esteem but finally one day I just was sick of it. I ended things and I've never felt more free since that day. I have a new boyfriend now who treats me with the most respect and loves me for who I am.   You deserve to be with somebody who is head over heels in love with you.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,Jess_Babblin,32,Fri Jul 10 11:43:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is plenty loveable about you -- and what he's doing sounds like emotional abuse -- the first part of an abusive relationship. Breaking you down emotionally is the next step to controlling you, physically, mentally, emotionally.   GET OUT NOW and know that you are WORTH SO MUCH MORE!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,PembrdWelshCorgi,15,Fri Jul 10 11:50:36 2015 UTC,"So I've read through your post history, and you genuinely seem like a nice person.  You are not pompous or pretentious, you seem very kind and accepting.  Also empathetic and understanding.  These are all truly admirable qualities in a partner.  And these are the things you should look at when judging your self-worth.  NOT what someone else who is going through a painful transition (because if you are on the road for breakup, it is a transition for both parties) is using to judge you and using as ammunition for his own motives.    As someone who caught only a small glimpse of your personality through pixels, I think you are a likable person.  No longer can you claim there is nothing likable about you, because I see it.  I can see in your comments that you sincerely want to help others!  I hope you like that about yourself too.  Hold onto that, be gentle with yourself and know that while you may not be perfect (because who is), your intentions are true.  You are worthy of being loved and deserving of it."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,ramsesshaffy,10,Fri Jul 10 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"I've been told that by a boyfriend before. Took a step back and realized it was simply a blip in a long line of abusive behavior. Google emotional abuse and gas lighting (not saying you're going through all that, but it might help out some things in perspective.) I used a throwaway and posted to /r/relationships genuinely unsure about if I was in an abusive situation, and the support I received there helped ground me (gas lighting had made me very unsure of my own perceptions. I'd been told no one would ever want me, he was only putting up with me, etc.)   I'm really sorry you're hurting right now. That is not something your boyfriend should ever say to you. I hope things work out best for you. Stay strong. <3"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,PembrdWelshCorgi,-3,Fri Jul 10 13:51:01 2015 UTC,I think you're really jumping the gun saying this guy is abusive (and many others in this thread).
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,Swissabella,6,Fri Jul 10 14:32:23 2015 UTC,"(not saying you're going through all that, but it might help out some things in perspective.)   Edit: I specifically said I wasn't saying he was abusive? I shared my story like OP asked.   The only thing I said about the boyfriend was that he shouldn't have said that to OP. And that's true. Saying they're incompatible, he didn't think their personalities matched well, almost anything would've been better than what he said."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,fastboots,6,Fri Jul 10 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"I know this is late to the party and will most likely remain buried, but I just went through a very similar situation. We were together for almost 5 years, and lived together for 1.5 years. By the end of it I felt so unloved. Even if I wanted a hug it had to be requested. Yet I put up with it, somehow thinking that his behavior was acceptable or would change in the future. He broke up with me in April stating that we didn't have enough in common (no surprise, towards the end he barely spoke to me). Break ups suck, but somehow even shortly after the break up I felt better. Slowly I realized how long I had wasted on a guy who barely seemed to like me. I know it probably doesn't feel like it right now, but you will probably be happier when you're single (even if it takes a while). Everyone deserves to be liked by their partner. Not sure if this helps, but it pains me to see someone in virtually the exact same situation. I hope you get out soon, I hope you find someone who loves you."

Your boyfriend is being a potentially abusive piece of shit and needs to get kicked to the curb. Get angry and use that anger to make the push to dump him.  I didn't realize how unhappy I was with my ex until I start seeing other guys and how wonderful they treated me. You deserve to be treated wonderfully. There are plenty of people out there that would give their left arm to be with you. That's what you deserve, someone who can't stop telling you what they like about you. Not someone who tries to pull you down. Go be happy without this piece of shit."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,Kerowyn202,9,Fri Jul 10 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"People come into your life for a reason / season / lifetime. Not every relationship is supposed to last forever. This is a powerful lesson you're learning right now - and I think YOU ARE making the right choice to not be with someone who will say such a hurtful thing. He's teaching you right now to not allow someone to treat you like this.   Hugs - the heartache sucks. But there are billions of people out there, and so many opportunities to be in a loving, supportive, and happy relationship. The key is being loving, supportive, and happy with yourself while being single. That is the single most attractive quality in another human being.  Have faith - you sound like  good person, and your guy sounds like he knows exactly what to say to cut you deep. You don't have to accept that. Leaving can be the hardest part. I know I was in a relationship where he said awful things to me - and after I left, I would conveniently ""forget"" the bad parts of the relationship and miss all the good parts so fiercely. Don't allow yourself to forget. Write down in a journal how you're feeling RIGHT NOW and remind yourself of WHY you're awesome. Stay angry about this for a little while, just to create some distance.  Good on you for realizing that you deserve better. Because you clearly do."

Before you can be with someone else successfully, you need to spend time with yourself and be okay without someone else. I love my fiancé. He's amazing to me and supportive. But I know what I would do without him. It would hurt, but I would be okay. You need the confidence in yourself to be able to exist without your SO, in any relationship. You need to know that if they stop or your relationship stops, it would hurt like hell, but it would be okay."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,balloon-loser,4,Fri Jul 10 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"Everything everyone else said, but also: don't be afraid to leave him. It is hard to leave an abusive relationship when you start internalizing that you are unloved and unlovable. But please, be strong for future you! You can do this! :) You CAN be alone and soon enough, you'll be even happier being alone! And then, when you're ready, you'll find someone who WANTS to tell you every day how amazing you are.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,vickylaa,4,Fri Jul 10 14:41:55 2015 UTC,"A close friend of mine had a guy say this to her once, not a boyfriend, just a friend. She says it's one of the most hurtful things anyone's ever told her, because if it was something like ""you're being too loud"" or ""you text too much"" you can change that pretty easily, but not liking someone's entire personality is just a total insult to who they are at their innermost level. It definitely really damaged her self esteem, which really sucks because her personality is actually awesome. She's the type who would drop everything and run to help a friend in need, and she's one of the most fun people to have around too, we can go on adventures and then sit around talking for hours afterward. Just goes to show that some people A) are really narrow-minded about how their comments will deeply affect other people and B) don't respect people for who they are. You need to go find someone who will love your personality, because I'm sure there are lots of wonderful things about you that this guy is just not seeing, and that is very narrow-minded and ignorant of him."

My ex didn't like things I couldn't change. Told me i was weak for having depression/anxiety. Made me feel bad for wanting to be around him. We made each other miserable toward the end. I cried all the time. But I loved him... He loved me, at least he says he does... And we were together for a long time. Its been about 2 months apart... I still cry. I miss him, but I don't at the same time. I logically know this is the right thing to do. I know that I will find someone else and be happier. I know he will too. But my emotions, my love for him, have not changed. Maybe it's just time that will heal, but I'm still broken hearted... In the end I know my suffering will be worth it."

Maybe they aren't as handsome as this dude, or there'll be other drawbacks, but being with them will feel like less work purely because you'll like them and they'll like you and you'll actually want to put in that effort.   Searching for that person will be less painful than trying to contort yourself into contentment with this guy, even if it takes years to find them.  Find something good about this done-for relationship and get it and you out. I had a bunch of bad relationships but with each one I learned something about me or about the person I wanted to be with, and that kept me from feeling like I was constantly failing at relationships.   It sounds like this relationship is making you sadder, and smaller, and that's not a good thing. You'll find someone who makes you feel happier and the best biggest shiniest version of yourself you can be, and it'll be better for you both. You deserve that."

He said he was never in love with me. I'm not sure it was ever love either. We would always get to the breaking point & then a few hours later- promise each other it would be better. There comes a point where you have to break out of the familiarity. You do deserve better and so do I."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,Lludra,2,Fri Jul 10 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've been there with my current SO over and over again. The first time you hear something like that it's very hard to digest and I resented him for it. I also thought that it the end of our relationship, because it was impossible for me to understand how to be with someone that doesn't like who I am. However, once my negative feelings settled and we discussed the reasons that he felt my personality was something he doesn't like it made more sense. I think a lot of times when we're in relationships we're unable to see that the person we're with might not love/like us with 100% intensity 24/7. That is a bad place to be but it's not necessarily the end of a line. Try to remember that one persons one opinion of you is not the something you should internalize. Maybe try to talk to him and tell him that this part of his personality is not good for you. I don't know your case in particular but what I do know from personal experience is that it's very hard to keep going and communicate but once you do that things are clearer. After having those conversations if you still feel that he's not worth it for you and that he's humiliated you beyond repair I would then make the decision to leave."

I too thought there was something wrong with me, but no, I was just with the wrong guy.  The thing is, right now you know it's over, you have realized it, but you are kind of in the denial stage of grief. Not denial that things will get better, but denial that you have to move on, and fear that you have to take that first step away.

You don't seem too oblivious as to what you should be doing or what's truly going on, most people would immediately fall into the trap of self loathing and then try to make themselves the personality your boyfriend would want. DON'T DO THAT.  Breaksups teach us so fucking much, it basically puts people into survival mode because quitting ""love"" is very difficult and tough to do but it gives you a lot of valuable lessons about yourself and life. I'm a little too tired to go into full detail, but seriously, ditch his ass, go find a new hobby youve been wanting to try or slightly considered, and just fill up all your free time with old/new friends old/new hobbies and you'll wonder why you ever even considered putting up with someone who ""doesn't like your personality"""
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,vonillabean,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"I just got out of a relationship with a guy I had convinced myself I was absolutely head over heels for. He constantly criticized the way I wore my hair and the clothes I chose to wear. He would call me lazy and justified it all because ""Hes just blunt, that's just who he was"". Despite seeing these messed up red flags I stayed because I thought deep down he truly loved me. I spiraled into a depression and cried myself to sleep more often than not. He broke up with me and I was devastated.   Putting in some time and space from that moment I realized what I had known all along: that it was messed up and unfair and that I didn't deserve to be treated that way. YOU deserve to be loved for everything that makes you uniquely you. There's nothing wrong with not matching up with someone's personality. However, he is cruel to lead you on and not to let you down easy. But it truly is him and not you. Let yourself mourn the loss of a relationship, but not too long. You have a lot to offer and the right person will see your personality in a shining light.   Please don't self-loathe!"

He's said countless hurtful things out of anger, including telling me he no longer finds me attractive and calling me a 'fat slut'. He always takes his hurtful words back and says he never meant them. That he never meant to hurt me. I forgive him every time because I feel so in love with him, but those words are etched permanently into my brain and I will probably never get over the hurt. You deserve better than to be in a relationship that is unequal, you deserve to receive the same amount of love you're willing to give.

It's not easy. It's not easy to see yourself as wonderful when you've been told day in and day out that you could be better. I will tell you that it's important to start pulling away emotionally and start being around people more often who you KNOW you are beautiful. They'll boost your spirit more and more and eventually, you'll start seeing how WRONG he is about you. If he straight up says he doesn't like your personality, get out as soon as you find your strength to do so. Sounds like you aren't the one for him but most importantly, he's not the one for you if he is blatantly telling you so in his own jerky way. You're right. You deserve to NOT ONLY BE LIKED but also to be appreciated, loved, cuddled and adored. Don't settle for less. The right one is out there and just think of guys like the one you're with as practice in finding what you like and don't like in a man. Eventually, you'll know EXACTLY what you want and all this doubting won't even exist anymore bc a good man who deserves you will feel like he doesn't deserve you and will strive to always try to make you feel like the most beautiful (inside and out) person in the world."

I can promise you that you deserve better than that, even if that means being on your own. Life is too short to spend it feeling humiliated and ashamed and broken hearted. Sometimes those feelings happen, and that's okay, but if there is a force in your life that is causing you to feel so much hurt then the best thing you can do for you is to remove that force from your life and begin healing and rediscovering the person you are apart from those feelings.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,ButTheBoobies,-3,Fri Jul 10 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"Being a shitty communicator about your own feelings, e.g. ""I don't like your personality"", does not make someone abusive. If there were absolute judgment statements made about her personality, like ""Your personality sucks"", that actually degrade her then that's one thing. But if OP's SO just said that he didn't like her personality, that's his feelings which he is entitled to and while it might hurt OP's feelings it's certainly not an abusive thing to say if it's just honest and not intended to coerce or degrade."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,alittleperil,2,Fri Jul 10 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"I think most of them are playing the odds that a girl in an off-again on-again relationship with someone who phrases things in the meanest way, who feels she can't leave and doesn't deserve better is either in a relationship with some flavor of abuser or with someone who sought out a vulnerable person. If he's not an abuser then op should still leave, but if he is then she's probably going to need extra strength that sometimes comes from being able to see abusive behavior for what it is. The guy didn't come here for advice and sympathy, she did.  And communicating things to your partner that meanly is abusive. Small petty abusive behaviors are still abusive. When you phrase things trying to hurt the other person, you're being abusive. And you can't say he didn't know ""i don't like your personality"" was hurtful, or that he didn't know better ways to say he wanted out."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,ButTheBoobies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to agree that sharing an opinion in the most straightforward way and without any vulgar vernacular is inherently abusive. If I say ""I don't like your pot roast"" when we're talking about your cooking, that's not abusive; it's honest. If the guy doesn't like her personality, what's he supposed to say? If he hasn't decided he doesn't want to be with her, but doesn't like her personality, then what do you think he should say? What nice way is there to adequately communicate that you don't like something other than 'I don't like _______'?   Yeah, maybe he could have devised some 3 minute sugar coated opening and then used a longer, more ambiguous sentence to sort of convey his opinion? But that's what people have to do now in order to not be considered abusive?  I'll put this plainly: Not walking on egg shells is NOT abuse.  Maybe OP's fella is abusive; we don't know him and we don't have context or his side to really say. But that statement on its own is not an abusive thing to say. ""I don't like your shoes"", ""I don't like your favorite movie"", ""I don't like how you style your hair"", ""I don't like your personality"" <---- honest opinions stated as concisely as possible."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cs206,ramsesshaffy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:02:53 2015 UTC,"""I don't like your personality"" is not equivalent to ""I don't like your pot roast"". ""I don't like your personality"" is the only phrase on your list that a person cannot change. You're telling your significant other that you dislike everything about them that makes them them, but that you haven't decided if you're leaving them or not. How could you possibly phrase it more calculated to hurt them?   The opinion is ""we're not a good match"" the mean phrasing is ""it's not me or us, it's all you"".  The concise statement was ""I want to break up"". You don't like her personality, how is that going to change? How are you doing anything other than twisting a knife by telling her that her personality is the entire fault-bearing part of this breakup? Blaming someone else because you're a bad fit with them is mean and dickish behavior. Someone who behaves in a mean and dickish way, people around here will probably label an asshole.  I've tried to explain how what he's saying is the asshole version of this conversation. You don't get why people here say he's an asshole and possibly abusive from the cues in her post, let it be. Trust that there are some hidden cues in this message that are hitting other people's buttons, rightly or wrongly. For better or worse, those cues aren't part of your dictionary.  If you're just uncomfortable labeling something you've done in the past as abusive, it's ok. Everyone has moments where they were trying to be hurtful and their shot landed. I've said shit to people when I was mad at them and wanted them to feel as hurt as I did in that moment, and I still feel bad for that years later. People can do abusive things without being abusers, because they grow and learn and apologize and move past that kind of behavior. You don't have to defend this dude to think of yourself as a good person, you're a good person because you're not inflicting that shit on someone and you're not going to intentionally or without catching yourself.  That's all I've got. This guy is being an asshole and phrasing things in near-to-probably abusive ways. You either can't or won't see that. This guy (and anyone else who says shit like this) isn't necessarily an abusive person, for having said something abusively, so you need not defend his actions in order to defend someone else."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3ctnko,MsDoodleBug,17,Fri Jul 10 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"For me, I knew my therapist was right for me because she made me feel like my thoughts and concerns were valid. A big portion of my anxiety comes from thinking that whatever I'm saying isn't worth paying attention to-- I always feel like no one is listening or if they are, they're scoffing at me. My therapist helped relieve that fear by being kind, open and never really interrupting me but also always providing helpful insight into things I didn't consider."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3ctnko,_okvic,8,Fri Jul 10 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"I sometimes like to think of therapy like dating...you go on a first date, and it might be a little awkward.  If you don't know your therapist very well, or are unsure if it's a good or bad fit--maybe you felt okay talking to them, but when you got home, you second-guessed it and overthought everything--please go back for the second ""date"".  If by 3 sessions, you don't feel like you're having a productive, non-judgmental conversation with them, you should think about finding a new therapist.  Also, I'm a big fan of 3--it's a magic number  :)  Session 1: Background, intros, it's gonna be a little weird.  Session 2: Starting to scratch the surface of issues, starting to talk about harder things, you should feel safe--but probably uncomfortable...we're taught to hide our feelings, so sharing them with a ""stranger"" can feel unnatural for some, liberating for others.  Session 3: Tipping point--I think at this point, you should be able to write down at least 3 topics that are directly related to your reason for seeking counseling (depression, in this case) that you want to discuss with your therapist, because that person seems like the right person to talk to about it.  Not because you're paying them.  Not because you think that's what's expected.  If the connection is there, you won't have an issue doing this. If it's a momentous task, it may be time to move on to another therapist.  Source: BS in Psychology, and a handful of counseling experiences (the good and the bad...no ugly yet)"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3ctnko,bomji,2,Fri Jul 10 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"I recently went to see two therapists through a walk-in clinic in my area. The first one didn't say much, and she was asking questions that made it clear she wasn't exactly listening to what I've told her. She was repeating herself with the same questions, and the session was only an hour; she just didn't seem to actually care about my feelings or help me find the logic in what I was thinking. When I cried, she seemed to tense up, and her advice for me were things that didn't work in the past. I told her I would try again, but she ended up scheduling me with someone else. That other clinician happened to call off the day of our first meeting, so I went through the walk-in clinic again. I met another therapist who seemed so much nicer and sincere with things. When I cried again, she was so motherly about it, and I honestly felt so relieved because deep down it's what I want. She asked much more questions and got me talking about a lot of things in the hour we met. When it came time to schedule another appointment, she told me I had the option of seeing someone else or staying with her. I chose to stay with her. She even gave me her number in case I felt the need to talk. If she was busy, I could leave her as long of a voicemail I needed. She gave me other resources, and really tried to work with my hectic schedule. I felt taken care of, and I didn't feel like I was left high and dry like the first therapist. I think for you, if you feel that sincerity and comfort in speaking with your therapist, then maybe you've found the right person to talk to. For me, at least, I really need my therapist to be someone who I can trust and feel cared for, because I will be seeing her and talking about very uncomfortable things. I feel very vulnerable doing this, so having someone who makes it appear that it's okay to be a mess in her office is fine and if she's able to reason with me to help me realize things then that's even better."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3ctude,cali_grown22,13,Fri Jul 10 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"It's very likely your butt will get wet, so I recommend a swimsuit bottom and some athletic or swim shorts. Unless there are waves or you're going with people who will likely splash you, a regular athletic shirt and sports bra should be fine. Make sure you wear sunscreen too!  Also, since it's your first time, I'd recommend wearing a life jacket. Depending on the water and the stability if your kayak (every type is different), it can really save you in case you tip over. Some states require a life jacket to be present in the kayak at all times by law.   I'd recommend putting your phone away in a waterproof container and not taking it out while kayaking so you don't risk dropping it. I typically leave my phone in the car, to be honest.   Bring something to drink, and make sure it has a lid that you can close (so no cans!). We typically brought granola bars as snacks, because you can eat them easily without ever really touching the food, but we also go river kayaking where the water is very unsafe to consume. I'd still recommend something easy to eat with one hand.  Here are the two most important rules of kayaking: DON'T get close to any fallen trees or anything that you can't easily go under, because it's easy to get trapped and if there is any current, you can get pulled underwater. Also, DON'T LOSE YOUR PADDLE. If you tip over, save the paddle first!!! Other people can catch your kayak easier than the paddle and a kayak without a paddle is useless.

Anyway, a zip-loc baggie, or any baggie, will not keep your phone dry. It might prevent moister if it's splashed, but in a dunk type situation, the bag will leak almost always. Try a small pelican case or otter box.   As for what to wear, bring plenty of sunscreen. The sunrays alone are enough to cook you, let alone the ones that bounce off the water. Wear a bathing suit under some comfy outdoorsy clothing. Bring a wide brimmed hat to keep the sun off your eyes, and, of course, bring sun glasses!!   Sounds like you're in for an awesome trip!

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cu65k,_okvic,3,Fri Jul 10 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"I duno about your parents, but mine are pretty old fashioned. No matter what happens in the world (ex, gay marriage becoming legal/more accepted, weed being more accepted)- it doesn't mean their thoughts and views will evolve with that of society.  I smoke weed roughly 3 times a week I'd say, for reasons similar to yours. There was a period of time when I broke up with my boyfriend last year and I had to live at home for a few months. I didn't smoke when I lived there because I figured it was their house, so their rules, and I respected that. I live alone now and do whatever I want, I am financially independant and they have no say in how I live my life. And they respect that. There is a huge negative stigma around weed and I think it will take a longer time for our parents to be so accepting of it. Our generation is so open minded and understanding, yet we aren't sympathetic to our parents when they take time to acclimatize to new ideologies.  I don't really have any advice on what to say to your mom, but if she isn't comfortable with it in the house, don't smoke it there. Or move out. That's just my 2 cents.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cu65k,pansy-ass,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:32 2015 UTC,"You live in her house, unfortunately, and so if she doesn't want you smoking there, you shouldn't.  So, have a conversation with her, and explain why you do (to deal with some depression, anxiety) and how infrequent it is (1.8 times a week isn't a lot). Then try to figure out what she's okay with. Maybe she doesn't want to be around you smoking; maybe she's okay with it as long as you do it in the backyard and not in the house; maybe she's actually fine with it as long as it's not more than X times a week. But if she still says ""No, not in my house"", then you have to respect that and go smoke elsewhere."

It turned out the paragard wasn't sitting right in my uterus, but regardless the insertion of Mirena and my current cramping discomfort right after is SO much better than it was when I had the paragard. Oddly enough, I left my insertion hungry just now whereas I didn't want to see or smell food for days after paragard. I really think it depends on the person, as I've read such a wide range of experiences with iud reactions in general. I already have moderate acne, so the fact that you mentioned that concerns me a bit, but I guess only time will tell. I wish I had more insight for you! Good luck."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3ctmg3,TheBabyBird,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:07:42 2015 UTC,I grew up with severe acne and I was put on Accutane (worth it!) and it got so much better but I still had a decent amount of acne for years after. I'm 27 now and I mostly use oil cleansing method to clean my skin and it helps wonders. I hardly have acne anymore. With Mirena I've noticed small red zits that come to a head quickly ( no big nasty cystic ones) just a couple around my chin and on my chest. Like I said it's not noticeable to anyone really but me. So don't worry too much and thanks for your reply!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3ctmg3,cali_grown22,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"I also went on Accutane and it was so totally worth it. I'm curious about your oil cleansing method that you use. I feel like I could be doing more to prevent breakouts.  In response to your actual question, I hadn't really thought of it before, but now that you mention it, I have noticed my appetite is less. I started losing weight on my own about a month before I got the Skyla (Mirena's little sister) inserted, so I kind of attributed it to that. But now that you bring it up, I've found I'm able to get to the point where I'm hungry before eating and that I'm not just shoving food in my mouth at a moment's notice. Like you, I'm also a food lover so I never have to worry about undereating, but still something interesting to think about."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,Skycakes,34,Thu Jul 9 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"DivaCup themselves don't recommend it, which I would take as gospel."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,monstersof-men,12,Thu Jul 9 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"They need to save their asses from lawsuits ;)  edit - so not that's it's honestly something you should never do, but because of rules and regulations and since if you're going to expel randomly, it's more likely to happen when you're on your period (and using the cup) so they need to base their recommendations on use, including how many years you can use the cup before replacing, based on what their lawyers tell them."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,sotepetsenu,8,Thu Jul 9 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"I have a Paraguard and I use Softcups (which is like a disposable Divacup). I have not had any problems with it coming out, but just to be safe I check my strings frequently. I didn't know when I got my IUD that it might be a problem, which is funny because I actually asked the nurse that inserted it about cups and she looked at me like I had two heads. By the time I found out it might be an issue, I'd had the IUD for a while.  I'd weigh the risks for you, the first few months are the riskiest for ejection so if cups are truly the best period option for you maybe you can switch for a while to pads / tampons and then switch back. My IUD made my cramps feel more localized to my cervix, so for the first two months after insertion it was really uncomfortable to use cups and I just used pads anyways. That leveled out, though.  (P.S. I really regret not waiting for my doctor to come back from vacation and waiting another month. So don't be like me.)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,BaldCanary,7,Thu Jul 9 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"I've been doing it for years, too. Never had any issues! For me, I need to release the suction anyway before I pull it out because otherwise it won't budge, so yeah.  If you're not comfortable with that, you could try the instead softcups. They are supposed to be disposable after one use, but you can also use one for an entire cycle."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,just_like_that,7,Thu Jul 9 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"I had the copper coil, and used a mooncup, and my coil fell out - whilst I was on my period. (At work. It was loads of fun.)  However, I had it in for about 2 years before that happened, always using a mooncup. I still have no idea if it was related.  I still use a mooncup, and am planning on getting another coil put in soon. Just going to be super careful about squishing out the seal before taking it out I suppose."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,superjujubean,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"Ooo... I didn't even consider the suction aspect of it.  I guess I'm used to ""breaking the seal"" so to speak anyway but yeah that sounds really uncomfortable."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,superjujubean,13,Sat Jul 11 06:03:45 2015 UTC,"I've been using the Lunette with my IUD for years now and never had a problem.  I make sure to release the suction before I pull it out (by squeezing the cup a bit).  If the IUD strings are left long, you might need to fiddle around a bit to get them inside the cup to prevent possible leakage, but I have no first hand experience with that (I had mine cut short)."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,MarrymeCaptHowdy,4,Thu Jul 9 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"This reply is pretty much word for word what I would say. My strings are short and I always take the suction off the cup before I remove it.  Never had a problem in the year I've had mine, and my gyno says everything looks fine."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,k4r3n,2,Thu Jul 9 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"I've had copper IUD for 2 years and I've been using a diva cup for almost a year.  No problems.  I'm super careful about breaking the seal before pulling it out AT ALL to make sure it's not suctioning out the IUD in any way.  I also waited a while for the IUD to ""settle"" in my body before I started using a cup.  Best of luck!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,protynie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, yup. The doctor who inserted my copper IUD had me wait until after my string check before using it and also told me about breaking the seal.

My uterus also like to sit down low onto my vagina, so it makes me...shallower than usual. I haven't had any issues so far!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,cityalien,2,Thu Jul 9 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"A colleague of mine had the paraguard and was using a divacup. She got pregnant. You have to be really careful about breaking the suction in a way that doesn't ""suck"" on your cervix and the strings so as not to shift the IUD. Hers never got pulled out, it just changes position.   I've always been curious about menstrual cups but I won't do it as long as my IUD is in, personally!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,Canicanelle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:05:28 2015 UTC,That is frightening. I was not aware that you could get pregnant from it just changing positions.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,riverloves2dance,2,Thu Jul 9 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"My friend did a paper on this! She said she found no evidence that expulsion and use of a menstrual cup are related.

When I used the cup for the first time after the insertion, I noticed the string was all the way down, like dangling outside my body and I freaked out thinking it was being expelled.  Turns out the doctor just left the strings super long and coiled up by the cervix so the cup moved them around.  She trimmed the strings and after that smooth sailing for the past two years."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,kitty_hawkins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"Of course, discuss with your doctor, but I did just get mine placed and asked my doctor who didn't see a problem with it.  This was just 3 weeks ago, so I have used it for a couple of days almost 2 weeks after placement when I started to bleed.  I'm a nursing mom so I'm not bleeding a lot, so I currently don't need more than a panty liner.  My string was left pretty long and stays curled around my cervix so unsure if that makes any difference whatsoever.  I didn't have a problem during those two days of semi heavy bleeding.  Of course, anecdotal and YMMV."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cp1n8,TheBabyBird,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"This is off topic from your question, but unless you are dead set on paragard, I would suggest looking into Mirena before making a choice. While some people do great with paragard, I had serious problems with pain and bleeding and just had it switched out for Mirena and it is SO much better for me. I definitely wish I'd researched and looked more seriously into Mirena the first time around instead of seeing 10 years versus 5 years and nothing else. Ultimately, you have to do what fits your needs best but I just want to encourage you to research if you haven't already! :) Your doctor might also be able to speak to the softcup use, though I'm unsure as I've never used them."

There are a lot of semipermanent dyes that are specifically designed to cover grey hair, so it should be easy to find.  The only downside is that as the name suggests, it's not as permanent as most hair dye, so you have to redo it more often."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cr30f,IrbyTremor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:02:37 2015 UTC,"Gray sucks up dye pretty well, some red or henna might make a really striking contrast. Some dyes are better for your hair than others, semi-permanents and hennas tend to be conditioning rather than drying. Since your hair is dark, if you don't like it you can always dye it all to match your natural color."

I've had anxiety issues all my life, but it made me go into full-fledged panic attacks out of nowhere.  For no reason.  Scared the shit out of me, and made me think I was legitimately going insane.  As soon as possible, I went back in and got a different prescription."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3crj2o,themostcasualjules,2,Fri Jul 10 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"It took me a long time to realize I have the same problem. I've always been a kind of anxious person growing up, but this past year I realized that my anxiety about things got way worse after I started taking BC like, four years ago. It was bearable at least, mostly because I didn't realize it was a side effect, but I got put on a different type of pill last year and I think I've gotten worse. I switched from the combo pill to the mini pill (for health reasons) and I feel fucking insane most days. I've had at least 2-3 mental breakdowns over some pretty dumb shit and I cry so easily. The only reason I haven't stopped/switched to something else is because, well, it's easier than using condoms all the time, and other forms of BC don't seem right for me. I think I'm going to stop taking the pill when I'm done with my current pack and see what happens from there. I'd like to get the implant but it's the same hormones as the mini pill, and if it happens to have the same side effects as the pill, then I don't want something that I can't just take out myself!  I'd see about switching your BC too though, that might help!"

I was never a real crier before being put on BC. Now my body is like ""oh you took the wrong exit off the freeway? Here, have a breakdown in your car!"" Way too easy and way too inconvenient. It sucks to feel trapped in your own body.  Have you considered doing a non hormonal implant like Paraguard? I'm planning to speak to my gyno about it soon.

The guy I was dating pre-BC said I was like a robot with no emotions, but really I was just good at not letting myself cry in front of others and didn't do it too much anyways. After that it was more often but could still control myself. But now with the mini pill it's super embarrassing because I feel like I cry in front of my fiance like every other day.  I have considered paraguard but it really freaks me out. I just don't like the idea of it, but it may be worth it anyways. Plus, I use the divacup and I've heard bad things about using it with an IUD. I'm not sure what I'm willing to sacrifice...going back to tampons/pads, dealing with crazy emotions, or using condoms."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,imyourdackelberry,149,Thu Jul 9 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"I think so, especially with the rug."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,whenuseeit,39,Thu Jul 9 02:17:41 2015 UTC,I think if you had a simpler/neutral-colored rug it would work well. It is a fun pattern.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,SaltyFresh,17,Thu Jul 9 02:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. I'd pick one of the bright colours from the pattern (the blue or green strike me personally), get curtains in that bright colour, and make awesome pillow cases to go over those throw pillows using the patterned fabric."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,Pickletonium,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"I second your notion. I think going with a neutral color would just be too bland, IMO. Picking a brighter color from the rug would look great and tie the room together."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,Neuro_girl,14,Thu Jul 9 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"The carpet and the curtains clash. Both patterns are different and don't compliment each other. They are both awesome pieces, just not in the same room."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,Mostly_Lucid,41,Thu Jul 9 05:07:09 2015 UTC,"You know... They are a bit busy, but my feeling is, as long as I like something, it's okay if it's a little loud or busy."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,AnnaBare,20,Thu Jul 9 02:45:12 2015 UTC,I love you. I need to cross stitch this on a pillow.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,spotpig,29,Thu Jul 9 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"I'd go with something neutral so that it doesn't compete with the rug. Also, consider hanging the curtain rod as high as possible, just under the molding, and wider than the windows if you can. It makes a big impact."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,PoniesRBitchin,8,Thu Jul 9 03:04:18 2015 UTC,"I love the idea suggested of book-ending the printed panels with a lovely turquoise. Also, if you can afford it, I've found that buying/making enough panels to have waves in the fabric even when they are shut somehow helps a busy pattern. Adding a third or even an additional half of the full width of the window will give you enough wave when everything is shut.   Another thing to do is extend your curtain rod out past the edges of the window. When the curtains are open, they should fit comfortably to the side of the window/door and it makes everything look really nice. Since you have a corner, the panels will have to cover a section on that side or you could eventually purchase a curved transition for the rods and use S hooks so the curtains slide around the corner. They'd still cover the window some in the corner but it would be a really nice smooth look."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,kanooka,5,Thu Jul 9 10:43:29 2015 UTC,"I think it is busy, but I think part of the reason it feels SO busy is because it's the only bright thing in the room. The walls and couch are neutral, the pillows and rug are a print but still more soft colors, and even the blue table (in my opinion) seems more cool than bright and bold. Depending on your funds, I'd suggest trying things like painting the room, getting a new couch or couch cover, or maybe buying some curtains like this that add color while complementing the neutrals you have now."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,teardrop87,5,Thu Jul 9 06:02:19 2015 UTC,"I love them, but I agree with the other poster who says to flank them with a solid color.  It's okay to have contrasting prints, in my opinion- they give your space a bohemian kinda vibe.  I'd try to get some natural fiber decorations, like some cool macrame wall hanging or something."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,KWITHI,8,Thu Jul 9 11:08:39 2015 UTC,"If you used them as the center panel on each window with a neutral on either side, then no. Hanging just that pattern over all the windows would be a bit much."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,djjazzysteph,3,Thu Jul 9 03:15:44 2015 UTC,I feel like they'd be fine if the rug was a more solid print like large stripe or large polka-dot. Having two noisy patterns together can make it look overwhelming.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,BallPointPariah,3,Thu Jul 9 11:05:13 2015 UTC,And excuse my mess!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,GLaDOs18,14,Thu Jul 9 01:57:43 2015 UTC,Are you for real? You need to see the inside of my car. It looks like a Goodwill in there.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,MarrymeCaptHowdy,3,Thu Jul 9 04:22:29 2015 UTC,I think it's lovely. And for whatever reason your question made me smile. Enjoy your colourful curtains!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,quaglady,2,Thu Jul 9 08:02:14 2015 UTC,"I love it! It ties in really well with the rug but is ""anchored"" by the wall color and the couch color."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,djjazzysteph,2,Thu Jul 9 07:22:55 2015 UTC,I think they look really cool and I also love the rug. Would move in (just kidding).
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,ParadisaeaDecora,2,Thu Jul 9 07:55:56 2015 UTC,Yes  If you're crafty you can get cheap neutral ones and make a wide border with the patterned one. It could save you a bit too.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,Lola1212,2,Thu Jul 9 10:25:53 2015 UTC,I think it looks precious. The room looks like Pottery Barn and Vera Bradley had a baby.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,Craylee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:23:09 2015 UTC,Either the rug needs to go or the curtains. It's too busy with both in one room. Maybe replace with a single bright color.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,laurenbug2186,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:53:46 2015 UTC,Maybe a bit more neutral or matching carpet? I think you're missing some neutral pillows and one with the same pattern if it's possible and something on the wall right next to them to balance the room. (like a painting or a small table/shelf? )
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,rubyred138,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:02:59 2015 UTC,"My thoughts: no, but you need some things up high near the ceiling. Tall bookshelves, attached bookshelves, decor? A tall lamp.   Though, the bordering with solid suggestion sounds easier."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,megalady,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:33:10 2015 UTC,"I think if they were half panels (one on each side of a window) that you pulled back, and they weren't so long, they'd be cute. Or maybe just a ruffle at the top and the long part is a solid color."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,stargirl142,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:45:04 2015 UTC,I don't think so but then again I'm not afraid of patterns and color. I love mixing patterns. Those are really cute
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,notovertonight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"No, those curtains are fabulous!   Others made some great comments--like making the rods round the corner, adding the solid panels, raising the rods a bit, etc. But I would also add that it might look better if the couch were pulled away from the windows a bit. It looks like you have the floor space.   Maybe stick a table behind the couch. A throw tossed over the back of the couch in similar colors might look nice and tie it all together as well. Maybe the same yellow that's in the print.   My two cents anyways.   Good luck with the curtains!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cmk0o,dioxazine_violet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:01:09 2015 UTC,Maybe? I like them though.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cq9i3,themostcasualjules,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:22:25 2015 UTC,I mainly wear jeans and as I'm quite short I always have to hem them. I use the excess fabric that I cut off and sew it onto the outside of the pants on the thighs so this fabric rubs and gets destroyed and not my pants.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3coerk,feedmewords,6,Thu Jul 9 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"From my experience, I stopped taking my BC for about 3 days... then realized I didn't want to stop taking birth control and took the 3 pills that morning which is what I thought seemed logical since if you miss 1 pill you just take 2 the next day at the same time ... biiiig mistake, I got super nauseous and ending up getting sick in the bathroom, puking for about an hour. Went to the doctor and she told me if you miss 3 or more days just wait for your period to come (it will come sooner because you've stopped taking BC earlier), then you start taking a new pill rotation the Sunday of  the start of your period ... i.e if you get your period on a Thursday, start taking the pill on that Sunday. Hopefully this helps :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3coerk,You_Aint_Low,5,Thu Jul 9 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry you had to go through that! I was going to do exactly what your doc said if no one replied, so thanks for the info!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3coerk,deniliese,3,Thu Jul 9 15:32:12 2015 UTC,My gyno suggested I try a SAM-E supplement to help with my anxiety/depression when my BC seemed to be the cause. It leveled me out pretty well but not in a zombie-like way (which had happened when I was on zoloft). It's a little pricey (~$40 for 60 pills)...you can find it in vitamin shops or convenience stores.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3coerk,sweetmelissa3,2,Thu Jul 9 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"I remember being on one pill and I got crazy mood swings. Thankfully, I switched. With that said, all pills are different and give you different side effects. How long have you been on the pill? Tell your doctor your symptoms and ask him to put you on a different prescription.   I'm not sure about starting with the same pack again. You can post in /r/askdocs. They were very helpful when I had a birth control question. Be sure to identify what pill brand you are on. It also helps to read your pamphlet as well!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3coerk,_minouche,2,Thu Jul 9 15:28:05 2015 UTC,"You should call your doctor if you're unhappy with your birth control. You can start in the middle but if you skipped three days you will get your period first. If you miss at least two pills, your period will start. Don't take three pills at once for each day you missed.  You should wait for your period to end and then resume the pills. But you should really call your doctor if you don't like the BC you're on and he/she can try you out on another one. You'd probably be better off with a very low hormone option."

Please don't forget about sunscreen! I'd also pack a couple of small makeup items (mascara, lip gloss) in case you want to go somewhere nice for dinner one night."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cnf9u,MetaBoob,5,Thu Jul 9 13:20:58 2015 UTC,"Now might be a good time to switch to a menstrual cup. You don't have to worry about (1) packing enough supplies for 3 periods, or (2) trying to find your preferred products in foreign countries. Honestly, if you're already practiced with applicator-less tampons, the learning curve won't be too steep. Before I got my cup, I had only recently mastered tampons with applicators, and I managed to figure it out with a bit of practice."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cnf9u,tehzephyrsong,3,Fri Jul 10 00:39:08 2015 UTC,"Some answers might change based on how remote you and your SO will be during these three months. Are you really out in the wilderness, finding your own food and water? Or will you be restocking at certain points? And how much you want to carry depends on your fitness level, quality of pack, and how far you plan to travel on a daily basis. So I'll try to give you some options that you may or may not have thought about...   If you have time, try experimenting with bar shampoo ( example ). I've heard it can take a while to transition and sometimes people experience having greasy hair before the scalp stops overproducing oils - which is often caused by our liquid shampoos with detergents in them. If you want a liquid shampoo, at least get one with minimal harsh ingredients if you are washing your hair in bodies of natural water. Less important if you are at a camp ground with shower houses.  Moisturiser, chapstick, and sunscreen. You can probably get a moisturiser with sunscreen built in. I've packed in face wipes for cleaning my face and neck. And I bring a ziplock bag to store that trash until I am somewhere with a trash can.  Minimal packaging. Like the OB's that don't have an applicator. Or look into diva cups/something similar. With cups you may not need a panty liner and that will save room in your pack for other things (like skin care or shampoo!). Edit: if you use tampons or anything that will have trash, bring a few large ziplock baggies. You'll need to pack out all that trash (well, you should... sometimes people don't...). If you are in a region with predators, you'll need to hang your food and trash well away from your camp each night.  You probably have a tent. I suggest also purchasing two hammocks that can fold up small (specific to hiking). For two reasons: It gives you separate sleeping space in case you need distance and it also gives you two nice lounging areas for times you might want mental/physical space. You each can be near the fire but doing your own thing in comfort (as long as you have trees). Also, if you want, you can just not take a tent and each sleep in your own hammock (not taking a tent will save weight and space - more room for little luxuries!). If you get cold easily, there are thin thermal insulators that you place between you and the hammock so it keeps your backside warm (where sleeping bags get crushed down and lose their ability to insulate). If it is hot weather, this is actually a really nice way to sleep with a light cover or even no cover. Often a good hammock will come with a tarp for rain cover and a bug net. Get one with at least the bug net. You can make a tarp or just buy it as an add-on if the hammock doesn't come with it. Avoid 2 person hammocks. Sweet in theory, okay for short use, not good long term. There are less expensive hammocks but Hammock Bliss is really well recommended and I have friends who swear by theirs."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cnf9u,spotpig,2,Thu Jul 9 11:12:39 2015 UTC,"how remote you and your SO will be during these three months.   I was kinda vague, because our trip is all over the place. For 10 days, we're living out of a combi van, then for the next 2 months its back packer hostels (in US and Canada, then on to Cuba), then its hiking Machu Picchu (Peru), and then back to hostels (Chile). We shouldn't really be that remote, but we will have serious weight restrictions for things like flights and comfort. But basically, I don't need room for food, water, tents, camping equipment etc.   Bar soap looks like an ace idea! It's cheap and I can test it out pre leaving! Thanks, I'd never heard of it. As is the ziplock bag plan.   I'm Australian, so none of our tampons are  sold with applicators. Are they easy to find without them?  But yeah, its not camping, I should have been clearer. It's on the road, moving, in foreign countries, and long long long travel times. I asked this because despite having lived together for over a year, we are both well aware we both need a couple hours a day to ourselves and to see other friends and stuff.   Thanks for your smart, detailed, thoughtful reply!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cnf9u,spotpig,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an amazing adventure! I can't say much for Canada and South America but tampons without applicators are relatively easy to get in the US.  If you are in safe areas, you can always go explore for an hour or two on your own if you need space from the SO. Or grab a good book and donate it/pick up a new one as you need on your travels. Unless you have an ebook reader, then you can just stock up and not have to worry about it."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cnf9u,heidiramone,2,Fri Jul 10 11:16:43 2015 UTC,"That sounds like so much fun! I went backpacking with my ex for two months a couple of years ago, and it was really great. You will definitely need dry shampoo, lots and lots of it!! Or not, depending on your hair type :P I love the ones from Batiste.  Also, get baby wipes. That's the most important thing. You can use it for pretty much anything; your underarms, face, and ""down under"" during your period.  When I went hiking I bought those super-tampons so I wouldn't have to change them a lot. Honestly I didn't feel like I had to change less, and they were just too big for me. I couldn't find a way to be sneaky with periods, so you just gotta take it as it comes.  Otherwise you'll just need sunscreen, moisturizer, deodorant (I bought some especially for people who sweat excessively, as they keep the smell away for longer, and you never know how much you'll sweat while hiking), maybe some toner and cleanser if you feel like you will need it."

In my daypack I carried my chapstick, hand sanitiser and a travel pack of wipes - Kathmandu have travel wipes often on sale, otherwise baby wipes will suffice.  I picked up a small tub body scrub from Lush in Las Vegas towards the end of the trip and that definitely made me feel more human!  Periods - I was already on the pill and just skipped them. Carry some liners with you just in case you have some spotting."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cnf9u,Hassan_Amir,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"It looks like you are well informed for hygiene! But I will add my two cents for #4:   In an area where you feel safe, take a sent amount of time and go explore separately. Take a few hours and see if each of you can find the thing in the city the other would like to see the most. Then meet back and decide where you want to take each other the next day. It gives you time apart, new conversation for dinner, and something to share the next day. Bring a deck of cards, a book, and a small notebook and pen. These give you great options for time together or solo activities when hanging out at homebase. Talk about alone time before you leave. Make a plan. Discuss boundaries, a plan for if you feel you need space, how you are going to bring it up, etc. Clear and calm communication before and during your trip will help everything go smoothly.   This sounds like a fabulous trip! Have a marvelous time!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cnf9u,vulnerasanentur7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:35:33 2015 UTC,"Periods- I've spent a decent amount of time in Central America and have never been able to find tampons there!!! Usually finding pads isn't difficult, although they can be pretty expensive depending on where you are. You probably won't be able to get tampons and might want to think twice about using a possibly sketchy/unsanitary tampon brand (if you find them). I highly highly recommend a diva/other menstrual cup, especially because a lot of the bathrooms I experienced were not places I wanted to swap tampons in. The cups give you more flexibility to choose when you empty them and such, and significantly reduce waste and the hassle of bringing enough products for the whole trip.  I also recommend packing some kind of anti-chafing powder/stick, moleskin, and duct tape."

You have to sort of play with it a little until it gets to an opaque yellow color, not transparent amber. There is a steep learning curve but once you learn it, you're good forever. I'd recommend you first go to a salon where sugar waxing is practiced, see and pick up tips, then do it yourself at home.  Another important point is that caramel is not used like traditional wax. Use small areas one by one, not spreading from your knee to your ankle for example. Also be careful with your thumbs/hands, the motion of kneading and spreading warm caramel used to give me huge blisters on my thumbs. If it starts hurting your hands, don't continue, because these will render both your thumbs unusable for about a week."

It's the best because introverts are drawn to this community but the events are HUGE and really social, so I love having a place to get away."

(if you don't know what a zine is, start here!)  for instance, at the annual Chicago Zine Fest, a huuuugee event with hundreds of people, they set up a room away from the hubbub.

So the conversation just keeps going as new stuff pops up.  But if someone messages me on facebook and we start chatting about something, but then we kinda don't have much more to talk about, I don't know how to end the conversation :/ Especially if it's someone I'd like to talk to again, but maybe not right now because I don't have anything new to say.

So you confirm the upshot of the conversation by summarising it, thank the other person, wait for their response, and leave. Don't rush it - just go through the motions.   Even in an informal context this can work. If you've been talking about some awesome new show you haven't seen, you can say ""I'll check that out! Nice talking to you!"" and they'll be all ""You too!"" and you can both move on.  Who knew chatting was like writing a goddamn essay. We are a weird species."

It is possible to do but you need to pack creatively.   For the flights, layers will be your friend. Try to pack shirts and bottoms that will mix and match well. You could probably get away with three pairs of shoes. Sandals, sneakers, and a pair of cute flats. Any of those can be used to go through airport security. Pack undergarments that are going to be easy to wash in the sink and dry in your room.   Don't go crazy with toiletries. Pack what you need, not what you might need. Same for makeup.   eBags makes some really useful packing cubes for compressing your items. I've had the most luck with the slim cubes.   Good luck with your trip!"

""Let me get back to you"" sometimes works as a deference. You could also fall back on ""I'm really trying to save money right now"" (usually true for me).  One thing to be cautious of: when you are ready to go out again, you might find that your friends have stopped calling. This doesn't mean they don't want to hang out with you, but rather that they've stopped trying to make plans since you're never available/interested. So it might fall on you to bring up the idea/plan the night when you are ready. Be prepared to be snubbed, though."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3clcqt,Me_in_KC,3,Thu Jul 9 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"I hope I can get to that point sometime soon. In the past I used to tell people that I just don't want to go/don't feel like going, but of course they would ask why and if I just said 'because', they would claim that it's not a reason. But it is. If you just don't feel like going somewhere or doing something, that's reason enough.  Saving money works in some situation, not so much in others. I guess it all depends on people. Some understand, some will keep bugging you. That's why I usually lie about not being able to go and having some sort of family thing, because people accept that better than just me not wanting to go.  I know just what you're talking about. But the thing with some people is, that they always tend to invite me when I don't want to go, but then they're organizing something that I'd like to join, but they don't invite me. And then after that they invite me again when I don't want to go. It's a bit frustrating."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3clcqt,notovertonight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:01:35 2015 UTC,"Frustrating to say the least. The family excuse is usually a good one, although you are absolutely right that ""because"" should be reason enough. Even a simple ""no thank you"" after an invitation that doesn't interest you ought to do the trick, but people sometimes take it so personally and get offended.   If you know of an event that you want to go to and aren't invited, you can always initiate contact with the host and say something like ""Hey, I'm free in the next few days [whatever time frame]...want to hang out?"" They might enthusiastically invite you to said event."

I think where you can really lighten your load is in the makeup bag/toiletries and pills you carry. Get a mini altoids tin. Not the regular size, but the itsy bitsy one. This will now function as your pill case. A little altoids tin probably carries 10-15 pills. If each pill is easily distinguishable (i.e. some are red some are white) just let them mix. Now for the toiletries, downsize to what either NEEDS to be reapplied throughout the day and what you have a 75% chance of NEEDING before you are home for the day again."

After I switched, running errands were exactly that rather than an arm workout."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgieg,kjeff23,12,Wed Jul 8 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"Start with your pills. Only bring what you will need that day. You can find some adorable pill cases on Etsy and I'm sure other places too. Take a minute each night or morning to fill the case rather than taking bottles to work. Note: prescription medication should be kept in it's prescription bottle. Do not take loose pills (even OTC) across country borders. Not worth the hassle.      Next, look at your keys. Do you need all of them every day? Stick your neighbors house key and the key to your dad's shed on a separate key chain so you aren't lugging it around all day.     Consolidate your makeup and toiletries bag if possible. Again, take only what you need that day/week.      You don't seem to have a lot of heavy things in your bag, just a lot of things, and yeah, they are all fairly reasonable to carry. The best way to lighten the load is to clean it out frequently and only take what is necessary. If you still find the bag is heavy, get yourself a decent messenger bag or backpack for work."

It has a card slot part and enough room to just carry my phone, keys (2 keys and 2 keychains), gum, headphones, pen, and Chapstick/lipgloss. I can cram a phone charge in there if need be. Then I have another bag which I put other stuff in. You can leave the big bag in your car or at your desk and only have to carry it in between those places  3) try having the second bag just be smaller.

One to keep me safe until I can get home, the second as a backup if the first fails. I stopped packing all my makeup when I realized I never re-applied it during the day, save for chapstick. Do you find yourself constantly re-applying makeup?  You listed Purse in there, are you carrying a second handbag inside your travel bag? Or do you mean a wallet? It might be that your wallet is too big. I condensed my 50-billion card wallet down to a coin purse and never went back."

I agree with the other comments that suggest using two bags. One of those bags should be for your ""just in case"" items and larger items. I would recommend using a smaller bag for the essentials, that way you won't be able to hoard any more items.   I have had the same problem as you. I use my bag for class, work, and everything else. I empty my bag out in between trips, eliminating the items I don't need at the moment. I also try to switch bags every so often, that way I gradually discard the stuff during the switching process. Any items i feel like i absolutely will need an in emergency (painkillers, mints, charger, etc) I keep in my car. If they are in my car, at least they are kind of with me."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgieg,higginsnburke,2,Wed Jul 8 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"As a reformed overpacker, a smaller purse saved me. I'm forced to only carry the absolute essentials. I was surprised at how little I actually needed to carry."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgieg,NotSoSouthern,2,Wed Jul 8 03:44:30 2015 UTC,"If you drive to work, keep the cardigan in the backseat or trunk of your car. That way you'll never forget it and you don't have to keep it in your bag. What kind of toiletries are you bringing/needing at work that really warrant a whole bag? I would go through this and your makeup bag and choose only the 3 most used items from each, the bare essentials that you really need and use on a daily basis. The rest you can leave at home or bring them by occasion. Use a small travel bottle (like this, or any small container) for your painkillers and another one for your allergy medicine, refilling them from the original packaging when the portable containers run out. I like altoid minis, they come in a really tiny lightweight tin and work very well for a quick breath freshening.   Doing all that should help lighten it up somewhat. Honestly the heaviest things you listed are your three notebooks. Paper is REALLY heavy. I would try to consolidate this the most, maybe instead of a paper planner you can switch to a digital calendar as others have suggested? I recommend Fantastical 2 and Swipes if you use iOS."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgieg,fizzyspells,2,Wed Jul 8 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"I have a separate tote for when I need to carry a lot of items for work (I know people are saying the notebooks/diary need to go digital but I personally like my notebooks and never have to worry about finding a power source). It is a cute canvas (lightweight) bag. My purse carries my phone, coin purse, wallet, keys, lady stuff, and can carry one ore two larger items if needed but I don't keep anything more in there on a permanent basis.  I keep a charger at work. I rarely am in a position to need to retouch my make up. So I'll toss that in the tote if and when I know I'll need it.   Every Monday bring a new cardigan to work and take the old one home for washing. Keep your water bottle at work (I'm assuming you don't share your desk much). You can clean it at work too. Do you really need water between home and work? Unless you have a medical condition or a hour+ athletic commute, you probably can go without water."

I can recommend you to buy a little bag, where you keep all your essential stuff like keys, allergic pills and so on. Then you can switch these things easily to another bag and you can sort out the rest of the stuff every morning, depending on what you need for the journey that day ;-)"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,SilvrSparrow,35,Tue Jul 7 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"I have an IUD, mirena to be specific. I love it like crazy. I've had it for almost two years and have barely had any problems. Pros: I don't have to worry about pills everyday, didn't make me gain wait, no moodiness, rarely any periods, don't have to worry about it for five years. Cons: Insertion sucked, but it isn't that bad. The first month or two I did have some spotting and bad cramps."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,Petite_Larceny,6,Tue Jul 7 19:46:09 2015 UTC,Same here! I recommend it to everyone I know if they're in the market for something. I was initially recommended the paragard but my periods before the mirena were already super heavy and the copper IUD tends to make them worse flow-wise.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,colonpuncher,4,Tue Jul 7 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"I recommend it to everyone! I work with young women, I've gotten many of them to get it as they inconsistent with the pill or condoms. I loved it when I had it, I had it for almost 3 years."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,canadamiranda,3,Wed Jul 8 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"I love my Mirena, but I do NOT love all the acne I got from it (or more likely, from the lack of hormones that I was getting from the pill). I have had my IUD for almost a year and I still get annoying zits on my face/back. It sucks but I can deal with it considering I no longer have a period or insane mood swings or have to worry about taking a pill every day."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,ajlm,2,Wed Jul 8 04:38:26 2015 UTC,I got the acne too! As well as a ton of water weight bloating and cramping. Ugh. People upvote mirena like its godly. I fell for it and its been really bad for me :/
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,FitnessNurse2015,2,Wed Jul 8 13:14:29 2015 UTC,I loved my Mirena but unfortunately it embedded in the side of my uterus. For about 2&1/2 years it was the best thing ever though. Now I've switched to the nuvaring which is also very good so far.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,Blazergal,2,Wed Jul 8 08:25:32 2015 UTC,"I'm getting mirena put in next week, would you be okay with answering a few questions I have about it?  Everyone says the implantation is not fun, but the stories I've heard range from mild discomfort to crying and kicking a nurse.   What was your personal experience? Should I take something like ibuprofen beforehand, to help with the pain? How long does the procedure usually take? Is there anything you wish you had known before the procedure?  Don't feel you have to answer anything if you don't feel comfortable telling internet strangers."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,ThrownMaxibon,3,Fri Jul 10 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"I know you didn't ask me, but I figured it'd chime in with my experience since I have the paragard, and its kind of similar insertion-wise. Yes, take ibuprofen. I had a very painful experience during my insertion. Screaming, crying and so on. However, I have a very low tolerance for pain and even routine pap smears hurt for me. Keeping that in mind, this was also my first time seeing that particular gyno. I don't really know if she was too rough with me or if I'm just a wimp about things going in my vagina, but she made it really quick. The whole thing took maybe 5 minutes? I've had my IUD in for about 4 months now and despite how things went, I'm glad I did it. I'm also glad I didn't know how awful it was going to be, or I may have talked myself out of it. I suppose the only things I would change about my insertion if I could, would be to be more heavily drugged."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,lindabelcher13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:19:33 2015 UTC,"How painful is a Pap smear for you normally? I only feel uncomfortable for a few seconds during mine, so maybe insertion won't be super bad."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,ThrownMaxibon,2,Fri Jul 10 06:24:05 2015 UTC,"Umm not too painful I guess, I'm pretty sure it partly has to do with me anticipating the pain. So I tense up and focus really hard on evening out my breathing until it's over. It hurts but it's manageable. For reference, during foreplay with my boyfriend: one finger feels good. Two fingers hurt."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,lindabelcher13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:31:54 2015 UTC,"I now have a huge amount of respect for you. I went in today and literally passed out from the pain.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,lindabelcher13,3,Tue Jul 14 04:44:51 2015 UTC,"Okay so my obgyn had me come in while I was on my period so my cervix would be dilated a bit already. Before I went I took a total of 800mg of ibuprofen, that's the prescription dose. The procedure itself didn't take very long, probably like 5 minutes tops, but before they put it in they had me take a pregnancy test and then explained the whole process of what they were going to be doing. Honestly, one of the worst parts was when they clamped my cervix (I believe that's what they did?). They did that before they inserted the IUD. While they put it in it felt like the worst period cramps of my life. I held the nurses hand while saying ""fuck fuck fuck"" under my breath. It was really weird because it felt like the device was moving around all the way up by my belly button. After they were finished, it was pretty much instant relief. There was still a bit of cramping, but nothing I couldn't handle. I was pretty worn out from the whole thing. Pretty much everyone I've talked to in person says their experience was similar, and that although it sucks, they would do it again because they love having an IUD."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,Petite_Larceny,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:18:03 2015 UTC,I am on my second mirena. I love it. And I think (can't find study right now) that female gynecologist use IUDs at a much higher rate than the public - meaning they know all the options and more often choose IUDs.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,eternal_clementine,16,Wed Jul 8 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"Nuvaring!   Pros:   Don't have to remember a pill every day Helps with acne I put mine in for 24 days, and put a new one in on day 28. My period is only four days that way (but it's so frickin' light, it's actually really only two days!) Hormones have less emotional effect (I haven't noticed any, actually, besides some typical PMS) because they're applied locally, like an IUD, BUT: Unlike an IUD, you're totally in control of it and can put it in/take it out when you need to. That part always made me nervous about an IUD.    Cons:   Sometimes you have to put the new one back in while you're still period-bleeding, and it's kinda gross-ish. :/ But you just do it in the shower and it's fine! It requires some thinking ahead. If you're going to be on vacation over the time when you're supposed to put the ring in, you need to fill the prescription BEFORE you leave, and that can sometimes get complicated depending on how your pharmacy does refills.    Tl;dr I love Nuvaring, I have not had any negative symptoms from it at all, and I recommend it to all my friends. Give it a try! Less commitment than an IUD if you wanted to give it a trial period!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,melodicstory,3,Wed Jul 8 00:25:04 2015 UTC,"I was on the nuvaring for a while and thought some of it was pretty good! At the start I was a little  freaked out about how big the ring was, and i worried itd come out when I used the bathroom for uh, strenuous movements (answer, no, it doesnt) or in sex (nope) but once I was used to it it was great. My doctor also told me that because, unlike the pill, it doesnt go through your digestive track, it is less likely to cause  stomach upset.  Unfortunately for me I ended up getting severe migraines in my ring-free weeks and so had to come off, leading to a horrific withdrawal period."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,dibblah,3,Wed Jul 8 09:09:53 2015 UTC,"You got the migraines too! I don't feel crazy now. I switched from it to the IUD. Argh. The IUD is awful for me, and the ring was so perfect minus the migraines :s"

Pros:   Not pregnant Won't die of a stroke or blood clot (ocular migraines + hormonal BCP = death, apparently) Don't have to remember to take a pill every day   Cons:   Weight gain Horrific acne for ~3 months after insertion, then bouts of horrific acne before and during period Period comes whenever the fuck it wants - 10 days, 30 days, 50 days, period don't care Period lasts for 10+ days Feel like a crazy person before/during period. Terrible mood swings.   Neutral:   Insertion hurts, but the pain lasts for all of like 15 seconds.   Overall thoughts: Hate it. Would take it out, but I don't have many other options (well, any other options that I can convince my gyno to let me do, because apparently despite 29 years of for sure never ever wanting children, I'm just minutes away from changing my mind, according to her).  THAT SAID, almost everyone I know has had great luck with their Mirena and loves it. Every form of birth control impacts individuals differently. You may have to play a little bit of BC roulette before finding the method that works best for you!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,octobereighth,3,Tue Jul 7 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"Ocular migraines are a bitch. Other than the pain, nausea, passing out, etc. the part that I hate the most is the fact that I can no longer be on hormonal BCP. I was on tri-cyclen lo for years, which helped regulate my periods, made them light, and totally cleared up my acne. But that all came to an end when I went to the ER and got diagnosed with migraines with aura. :'("
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,briwana,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:17:36 2015 UTC,Wait whaaaaat. I had my first and only migraine about 6 months ago (was not on BC at the time). It was an ocular migraine. It was the only one I've ever had and haven't had one since. I've been on BC for like 2 months now. Should I be worried? I just looked it up. Why didn't my doctor tell me this :(
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,extraphilestrial,2,Wed Jul 8 21:30:18 2015 UTC,"Are you on BC that contains estrogen, or is it the progesterone-only type? The second type is totally fine if you've had ocular migraines (from what my doctor told me), but people who suffer from ocular migraines who take estrogen-inclusive BC have an increased risk of blood clot and stroke, as well as more frequent migraines. It's not a huge risk, all things considered, but it increases your risk enough that the neuro doctor I saw and my family doctor both told me I needed to switch BC.  I'd talk to your doctor about it. It could be because you've only had one before (I'd had two), or something like that, but I'm definitely not a doctor, so go ask yours about it!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,FitnessNurse2015,2,Wed Jul 8 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"If the acne is really bothering you, you could ask your doctor about getting a prescription for a low dose of Spironolactone.  It's technically a blood pressure medication, but some transladies take it as part of their hormone replacement therapy because it's an androgen inhibitor.  Hormonal acne is often caused by androgen, so the Spiro helps with that.  It's also a diuretic, which helps with water retention!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,octobereighth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:41:30 2015 UTC,I was told that the mirena was local hormones to your uterus and shouldn't cause those things. By chance did you go straight from BC pills to mirena? Maybe the acne or weight gain is from the lack of pill hormones rather than mirena? I just got mirena and I am just starting to LOSE weight... so I'm definitely not gonna be happy if mirena makes me gain weight. :(

Suddenly after I had the mirena and I gained 15 pounds! I take care of my body, go to the gym and do cardio. I always had a flat stomach and it protrudes terribly. I am absolutely warning you - if you see acne you didn't have before (I never had hormonal acne - ever!!) and see watery-weight gain around your lower tummy/uterus, be careful! I also never cramped. I was a lucky girl in that respect. Now I cramp :(   I waited 8 months for side effects to even out and it hasn't. Sorry this comes off as harsh against it, but I HATE the mirena. I can't wait to get it yanked, I have an appointment this Friday. I have tried many kinds of birth control, and nothing has ever made me gain weight but the mirena. Heck, I have tried putting on weight for years (not around my stomach) and no matter what, I couldn't. Then poof this thing happened to me :("
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,FitnessNurse2015,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:45:09 2015 UTC,"Also - even thought the mirena is in your uterus, hormones released end up in the blood stream and can cause issues."

If you are done having kids, or don't want kids, it's a good bet."

It may be because birth control pills reduce cramps,  and so ladies stop taking birth control after their tubes are tied and the next period is suddenly worse than the previous one"

When I first started I was a little emotional but it only lasted a few days. There are two ways to use it. 1st is leave it in for three weeks, out for one and you get your period. The 2nd is you leave it in for three weeks and immediately put it a new one and you dont get your period. I use the 2nd method because I have severe, unbearable periods. Pros: helps with my acne, no period, no side effects for me, dont have to remember a pill everyday, and not painful for my SO during sex. Cons: every three months or so I have to give myself a period because I get bloody ""discharge"" and it doesnt go away unless I have a period. But hey Ill take a period once every three months than every month any day."

If you leave NuvaRing in your vagina for up to 4 weeks (28 days) you will still be getting pregnancy protection. Remove your old NuvaRing for 1 week (7 days) and insert a new NuvaRing 1 week (7 days) later.  From the Nuvaring website FAQs :) you'll save some money, too, if you do it this way!!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,AnaBananaFace,4,Wed Jul 8 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry for no bullet points. I'm on my phone which doesn't have the formatting options that I need. :/  I have the mirena iud. I've had it for about 9 months now.  Pros: I don't have to remember to take/insert/change anything.  It lasts for 5 years  My periods have completely stopped(your results may vary)  Getting it taken out is a quick process. As is getting it put but is much less pleasant.  You can start trying to get pregnant right away. No waiting for hormones to get out of your system.  Cons: it was unpleasant, but bearable, to get inserted.  Some places have a stigma about putting one in if you're under 18, have never been pregnant, aren't on your period, over weight. Don't go to these places, they are uninformed/biased.  Can be expensive(although you've said this isn't an issue for you)  Depending on which iud you get (there are 3 kinds) effective time, period heaviness, and hormone level can vary so do your research based on which type would be best for your body, not just blindly agree to what the doctor/nurse says.  In all, I am very happy with my choice to get an iud. I have been on two kinds of pills (lol and regular) and depo. Both were not a good match for me. I strongly recommend people to at least look into an iud because they may have gotten a bad reputation in the past but they really are a good choice."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,ikmkim,5,Tue Jul 7 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"I gained like 30 lbs in 6 months after getting the Mirena. Just switched to the copper one a few months ago and I've lost about 15 of it but the rest just doesn't want to come off. Most literature on Mirena will say the hormones are in such a small amount that they don't cause side effects, but I think some of us are really sensitive to them. I've never had anything but trouble with hormonal bc (pills, depo, etc). I'm really happy with the copper IUD and haven't had any problems with it. That said, I didn't have to deal with periods for 4 years, which was awesome!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,FitnessNurse2015,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:46:44 2015 UTC,omg yes. I have read everywhere I could about mirena and weight gain and I haven't seen anything until now. I have ballooned 15 pounds. Once flat stomach now is full and uncomfortable. I kind of want to get the copper now.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,FitnessNurse2015,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:41:11 2015 UTC,I too had the weight gain! I have always been tall and skinny with a flat stomach. I've had it for 6 months now and my lower belly/uterus area has ballooned! Everywhere else has stayed small. I feel pregnant and awful. I suspect its the mirena too in your case!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,Skycakes,6,Wed Jul 8 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"Well I'm about to get the paragard (IUD) inserted. I haven't experienced it personally but the pros are that it's hormone free, lasts up to ten years, has a high rate of pregnancy prevention, and you don't have to fuss with it once it's been inserted. The cons are that insertion can be painful, you have to go to the doctor to have it done, and it can cause cramps/heavy bleeding during your period and spotting for the first few months."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,Guckalienblue,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:17:08 2015 UTC,I love mine. 4 years baby free and I love that it's hormone free.

Its a lower dose pill, I'm still in the first 3 months, but things are pretty okay. I do have times where I just want to eat everything, but remembering that I'm not even hungry really helps lol  You have to find what works for you and your experience with any form of bc can be really different from anybody's here."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,FancyPhilanges,3,Wed Jul 8 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'm on Implanon Pros:  no period no dosage balanced out my hormones (no breakouts or freakouts) lasts 5 years  Cons: Its in my arm, so sometimes it gets itchy or irritated insertion was uncomfortable a 5-7 lb weight gain  So far (2 years) I love it. I like not having to think about it and the weight gain was so minor that I'd gladly trade it for not bleeding every month"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,toastedmarshmallow20,2,Tue Jul 7 20:45:01 2015 UTC,I've been considering getting Implanon. One of the biggest things I've read is that you can spot for awhile after insertion. Like some sources say months of light spotting every day. Your experience is nice to read. I'm doing well on the pill but I hate taking it every day. I'm hoping my lack of side effects with the pill will cross over to having Implanon.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,junjunjenn,4,Tue Jul 7 21:33:57 2015 UTC,I got nexplanon 9 months ago and I've had less days NOT bleeding. I've basically been on my period the whole time. Constant spotting. Ruined underwear. The gyno told me that in the studies women with the implant had the same number of days bleeding as women without it overall. I told her I would give it a little longer. I'm probably going to get it taken out.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,Idonthaveapoint,2,Tue Jul 7 21:38:39 2015 UTC,I took mine out years ago but   Pros:    I lost heaps of weight (partly due to effort but I also think implanon helped heaps but it was pretty much instant although I was the 1.5% or something)  I never had to worry about the pill  No cramps  lasts 3 years and was only $30 for me (I love you Australia)    Cons:    I got almost constant bleeding (this is about 1 in 4)  My periods were heavier than the constant bleeding  to stop it I took a mini pill and I'm not sure if it was that or the implanon but I became a bit depressed (could have been due to life in general though)    Neutral:    My pimples came and went less. Sometimes my skin would be flawless and around when my new horrendous period was I would be a design inspiration for a new polka dot pattern.  Libido didn't change.    I had a friend who never bled after the first month and had zero problems

I gained weight but I don't know how much of that was the pill and how much was outside factors. It itched sometimes (though I have sensitive skin, so that could have been the reason).   I had it removed because I felt like my sex drive went away and I didn't feel like me. Unfortunately my boyfriend moved away so I can't really tell if that was to blame or the relationship has issues... Time will tell I guess. Right now my birth control is 2000 miles!"

I do get a period if I'm particularly stressed, but otherwise either incredibly light spotting or no period at all. I still get breakouts, but they are much reduced after the implant. And I no longer have migraines every month!  I had no irritation at the injection site. But I did gain about 50-60lbs after I got it. I doubt all of that was the implanon, but some of it was."

Just had it replaced today (should have been in Feb 2016, but I did it 6 mos early)  Pros (for first two years after implantation)  -no periods  -no weight gain  -no mood swings  -no babies  -no acne  The past six months have been a little rough (with mood swings and crappy periods/cramps, anyway, which I never had before) which is why my doctor suggested I replace it. Apparently the hormone level drops after year 2, so even though you're protected from pregnancy still bodies are react kinda weirdly.   Overall I definitely recommend it though! Insertion is funky but not painful (they use local anesthesia and it's waaaay better painwise than the IUD, I've heard)."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,ghenne04,2,Wed Jul 8 04:47:35 2015 UTC,"Ortho-Evra/Xulane/the patch  Pros: I only have to change the patch once per week. I would never be able to remember a pill every single day. Also I get my period monthly, which is a pro as I wouldn't want to skip it in case I get pregnant and don't know it. I drink too much for that. Been on it just over 10 years and love it.  Cons: Higher risk of stroke if you have high blood pressure. Doesn't stay on well if you get oils in the area it adheres to. For example it almost fell off (I put it on my butt cheek) when I got a massage on my recent vacation."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,FuckingWanderlust,2,Tue Jul 7 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"The worst was the Depo shot. It made me hormonal and crazy. I took the pill for about 10 years from when I was 15-25, roughly. Those also made me hormonal, but I could never be sure if it was me or the pills since I was on them from such a young age. Once I got off of them, my mood really evened out. I got back on the pill recently (after 5 or so years), and sure enough, I became a hot hormonal mess. I'm going to get Paragard (hormone-free IUD) later this week. Pros for me: It's hormone free, plus I will continue to ovulate (aka, it won't disrupt my body's natural rhythm). Cons: Insertion might hurt, there is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and yeast infections, and a risk of it perforating my uterine wall. Despite the risks, I'm going to try it because the hormone methods make me not feel like myself."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,alana_r_dray,2,Tue Jul 7 23:06:38 2015 UTC,"I have the Skyla IUD. Love it!  Pros: my raised BP from oral birth control lowered to normal. Don't have to remember a daily pill. A weekly patch or ring. Or a monthly injection.   Cons: insertion isn't fun. Wasn't horrible. But not fun. Maybe 10-15 seconds of intense cramping no after effects. But took the whole weekend off just in case. Didn't need the time off though which is nice. And I know you're in Canada but for those not in the U.S. It's expensive if your insurance doesn't cover or largely cover it. (Close to $1000). My insurance did so I only paid $75 out pocket for three total appointments (initial exam, ultrasounds to measure uterus to determine which IUD size would work for me, and insertion appointment.) I have a small uterus and haven't had kids so I got the smallest, Skyla. It's low dose hormones and lasts three years. Wish I could have gotten the 10 year one. But three years is still great.   I didn't experience the possible side effects of my uterus expelling the device or ovarian cysts. But I understand that risk is fairly low.   I was 26 when I got it. If that helps. Had been on oral pills since I was 17."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,NotACorythosaurus,2,Tue Jul 7 23:08:56 2015 UTC,"I'm on the generic of seasonique. The pros are that I get my period once every 3 months, I always know it's coming, only about 2 days of heavy bleeding, I'm still covered if I miss a pill so even if I'm a few hours late there aren't any bad side effects. The cons are that I could miss more and be unprotected, but that hasn't really happened, and that I get some spotting around the end of month two. I still have light acne and I've been a little bit moodier since I started it. However I did start the pill last year when I went to college so that could be a factor in mood and minor weight gain.My boobs also grew, but I'm not sure if that's a pro or a con for you. While I like the sound of bc methods like an iud that you don't have to bother with, the predictability of my period is really reassuring."

It doesn't seem to affect my libido either so that's cool.  CONS: Worst forehead acne EVER. Although it's getting better. slight weight gain but not unmanageable, I've already lost it a couple months after starting. Also, I still get hormone headaches even though my headaches were the reason I started taking it...  This is my first birth control so I might have to try something else in a few months."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,shakyjellyfish,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:38:42 2015 UTC,"I have a Mirena IUD. Pros: will last for such a long time, idiot-proof (which I am), very low hormones, bleed less on my period.  Cons: hurt like dying to get put in, also it is still new (under 2 months) so I am dealing with daily cramping that makes it hard to exercise and means I'm taking tons of advil. I'm assuming that the cramping will stop eventually at which point I would have no cons at all."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,ronniejean1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:04:11 2015 UTC,"So it looks like the Mirena has been well-covered in this thread, but I thought I'd chime in about mine anyways.  This was my first hormonal BC. I've never been pregnant, and I'm rather small-framed, so I planned to get a Skyla. My doctor explained that the only significant difference between the Skyla and the Mirena is how long it's in for: 3 years vs. 5 years. The size and hormone level are nearly the same, and no tests have been able to prove that one is more effective for smaller or nulliparous women.   Pros: effective for 5 years, high efficacy rate, no noticeable side effects, no periods. Cons: cramps for 2 weeks after insertion, onn-and-off spotting for just over two months."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,kazaanabanana,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:28:32 2015 UTC,Implant   Pros: I don't get my period and I have no period pain.  Cons: I think it may leave a scar (nbd) and it doesn't help my acne like the estrogen pills did.  Pros outweigh the cons for me.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,crabbydotca,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:09:30 2015 UTC,"I'm on Nexplanon as evidently Implanon is not a thing (at least in the US) anymore. I think the only difference is that Nexplanon is radiopaque and can be picked up by an x-ray. I've only had it for about 3 months now, so I can't speak for any long-term effects.  Pros:   No pain in my cervix. This was the big turn-off for me when it came to Nexplanon vs. an IUD. I don't care what people say about being able to minimize the pain associated with it; I do not want uncomfortable things happening in my lady bits until absolutely necessary. Insertion was super easy. Other than my doctor going in a little too fast (wasn't totally numb yet) all I felt was pressure during the actual insertion. Obviously not having to keep track of pills/rings/patches/condoms. Mine's good for 3 years. I've only had one period in the last 2 1/2 months, and it was lighter than my already light period! I have not gained any additional weight since having it inserted. It didn't make me go crazy mood-wise like Lo Loestrin Fe did.   Cons:   My period lasted for a week and a half, which was annoying because it was too heavy for a pantyliner and too light for a regular thin pad. Ffffffffffff. Tiny tiny little dot (scar) at the insertion site. You wouldn't know it was a scar even from looking, though. It's like the size of a raindrop. I've been getting these tiny coarse facial hairs, but they're easy enough to pluck out. I've had like 5 since I got Nexplanon."

Does that count?  Lots of cons - not as effective, not as pleasurable, and it's usually a pain to have to stop and find a condom (""shit, we're out!""), carefully unpackaged it, make sure it goes on correctly. My period, though shorter, is much more painful and intense - as well as being less predictable. To top it all off, my high school acne is back.   The pros being that I don't have to take a pill every day, and it's easy to contain any... messes.  The situation is less than ideal, to say the least.   I'm covered again, and have been procrastinating getting a new prescription because I don't want to go back on a daily pill. So I find these kinds of posts so helpful!"

BUT after a few days I was okay. I bled about a week, and after that there's just been some weird spotting. I've tried just about everything else, and I was so sick of hormones. (The depo shot really scared me off). The first few months aren't supposed to be easy, but it last ten years! What's 6 months compared to that?!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,Ixiepop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:36:47 2015 UTC,I'm on Seasonique.  It's one of the pills designed for you to take 3 months straight so you only have 4 periods a year.   I haven't noticed side effects except for some spotting every now and then. I had a lot more spotting when I started it years ago but now I rarely experience it.  My period has gotten lighter as well.

I only get a period once every three months, the cramps I get have reduced in pain and frequency, less acne. I can't tell if it made me gain weight, but I'm certain that the weight gain was from just going through my freshman year of college. I've used three kinds of birth control in the past, and this one has worked the best and makes my life much less stressful.   The only downside is that it has made sex a bit more painful for me, but that's an uncommon side effect."

No weight gain or hormones to throw your body out of wack    Cons:    Painful insertion First few months took some adjusting.  My periods were A LOT heavier than they had ever been and the cramps were unreal.  My cramps were so bad that I would almost throw up. Spotting:  This was really bad for the first few months but isn't an issue any more unless I have just gotten off of my period This may be a TMI but my discharge has definitely gotten worse.  I know the iud thickens the cervical mucus so maybe thats whats happening  .    Let your body adjust to it and it really is great.  I'm going on 8 months with mine and really feel like I'm getting back to normal.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,MIchonne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"Skyla: LOVE IT!   Pros: very light period, it was free with my insurance, low hormones, and has not caused a dip in my sex drive unlike the ring or other pills. That has to be the best part- I hated the decrease in libido caused by other methods.   Cons: insertion was uncomfortable at most, not really painful at all. I felt a weird, sharp cramping sensation for about 10 seconds then it was fine. The rest of the day was just like period cramps, not distracting or anything. My sister actually went out dancing the day she got hers inserted."

I love the pill, I've been on different pills for 4 years now. Some made me a little more cry-y/hormonal, which is why I'm on the lowest estrogen dose they could get me.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,fannyrogers,-6,Thu Jul 9 05:00:19 2015 UTC,I don't think this is a very good question since everybody's experience will be completely different. You'll have to try a few out for yourself to find one that works best for you.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,octobereighth,-7,Wed Jul 8 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"tbh what i've found is most birth controls use the same hormones, so it's about gauging how your body reacts to them, and everybody reacts differently. I have an implant (the one that goes in your arm). Its fantastic in that, after one small insertion I don't have to worry about birth control for three years. A lot of people get freaked out about the insertion, but tbh my nurse didn't even inject anesthetic. She used a numbing cream and I didn't feel a thing, it was over in seconds. You are also completely unaware that it's in your arm unless you are deliberately looking for it. I've also watched my friend had hers removed, and it's much less invasive than one would imagine. hormonally; I reacted to it the same as I did the mini pill as they both use progesterone. However I don't need to remember to take it the same time everyday, or worry about drinking/sickness affecting it working. I still bleed, it's pretty irregular but only light, sometimes I go months with nothing, sometimes I bleed twice in a month. I've never had period pains with it, and I used to get the most insane, painful periods. I get bouts of being emotional. My appetite is ridiculous which has lead to weight gain and my sex drive has decreased massively. But that's all worth it to me because I'm not pregnant and I don't have to fumble around with condoms.  EDIT: I would like to add that they don't recommend IUD's to women who haven't childbeared. I had a friend who used it and it ended up ripping her, caused a massive infection and almost made her infertile."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cgna7,fannyrogers,9,Tue Jul 7 23:26:46 2015 UTC,"they don't recommend IUD's to women who haven't childbeared   This is a common misconception. I'm sorry to hear about your friend, but that had nothing to do with the fact that she never had children.   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the World Health Organization (WHO) both approve IUDs for people who have never been pregnant."

People suggest that I get a pixie. I didn't.  I had a small trim afterwards. Just to cut off the split ends. For restructuring the hair, I use protein-based shampoo and conditioner. I use a deep conditioning treatment once or twice a week. For moisture, I use argan oil and leave-in conditioner daily. My hair has since improved a lot in the span of two months.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3ci4am,comfy_socks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:40:11 2015 UTC,"I have a few tips that may help.   First, get rid of your normal shampoo and conditioner. Start using sulfate free shampoo partnered with silicone free conditioner- the sulfates are extremely harsh on your hair but are the only things that can remove the silicones from the conditioners! Leave in conditioners are really good for restoring the moisture as well.   Second, start doing a leave in coconut oil mask once a week. I bought a tub of coconut oil from the grocery store. I apply it all over my head before bed, wrap my hair in a bag and then a tshirt, then wash it out in the morning in my shower.  Third, go in for a haircut. It may not necessarily have to be a pixie cut, but perhaps your stylist can give you lots of layers (since you said it was mainly the top layer that was damaged) to get rid of most of the damaged hair.   Even if you don't have curly hair, go check out /r/curlyhair . They helped me so much with my damaged, awful hair and will be able to give much better tips than me :P"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cjhmk,imyourdackelberry,2,Wed Jul 8 12:29:52 2015 UTC,"It's generally advised that you contact your doctor (MD or Gyno) if you've been bleeding for more than 10 days straight.  Call and discuss the fortnight of bleeding, as well as your vacation concerns."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,TGSG_TA,71,Tue Jul 7 11:34:43 2015 UTC,Its Spegma. Perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. Just wash it out at every shower. Go clean up in a washroom directly before any spontaneous sex.  Edit: Uncircumcised men have it too.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,JadedFlowers,22,Tue Jul 7 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"Smegma:       Smegma (Greek smēgma, ""soap"" ) is a combination of shed skin cells, skin oils, and moisture. It occurs in both female and male mammalian genitalia.  Both sexes can produce smegma. In males, smegma is produced and can collect under the foreskin; in females, it collects around the clitoris and in the folds of the labia minora.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,autowikibot,15,Tue Jul 7 12:58:22 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for putting my mind at ease :)
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,JadedFlowers,9,Tue Jul 7 13:19:58 2015 UTC,No worries. :)
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,Spokemaster_Flex,22,Tue Jul 7 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"Most likely discharge, as other have said. Sounds a lot like exactly what I get. For me it comes and goes. Some months it's a little more, sometimes it totally disappears. No man visiting my downstairs has ever said anything about it.  Discharge is a natural product of your ""self-cleaning oven"" and just means your uterus and vagina are doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. However, if it changes (gets drastically smellier or changes greatly in amount or consistency), it might be worth an OBGYN visit to rule out bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,behvin,5,Tue Jul 7 12:53:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the reply, I'll definitely get myself checked if it's anything worse :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,comfy_socks,9,Tue Jul 7 13:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get this from time to time as well, usually right before shark week hits or when I'm on the dehydrated side. Make sure you drink lots of water or herbal tea throughout the day when you're approaching that time of the month. I keep wipes in the fridge this time of year to freshen up at the end of a sweaty day. Like everyone else has said, if it gets worse, changes color or odor, or has a pink tint to it, talk to a doctor to rule out any problems!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,behvin,13,Tue Jul 7 20:34:15 2015 UTC,I keep wipes in the fridge   OMG you are a damn genius.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,juliettwhiskey,12,Tue Jul 7 15:41:52 2015 UTC,Its probably just discharge=nothing to worry about and nothing disgusting :)
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cey7l,olivebrown,4,Tue Jul 7 11:44:40 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for clarifying! I have a ton of insecurities and this recently discovered makes me feel even more self conscious about my body :( Glad to know it's no big deal :)

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cj5ex,sugarpot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume you're seeing the gyno, not just a GP.   My doctor wants to take it out and put me on the implant. I really don't want the implant as it has a lot of hormones and I really don't want something with a lot of hormones.   I completely sympathise, I won't take any hormonal BC. I would go see the doc as scheduled and know there's options including to refuse a recommendation, and to go away and think about it. The way you write, it's as if you're being instructed what to do rather than options being presented to you, which is kinda strange but I know some doctors can be overbearing; in which case taking someone else (older than you) might well cause their attitude to improve.  In my area there are GUM clinics which are entities in themselves so that might be a route to a second opinion and/or getting that thrush sorted out.   Consider trying condoms made of a different material to what you've had difficulty with."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cj5ex,EarwormsRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"Hi :) Thanks for taking the time to reply. I'm going to see the GP again. I keep sort of being shunted between the two haha. Sorry, I just don't really know what to do, I've tried numerous GPs and a few Gynaecologists and they all just kinda of say ""this is what we can do and that's it"". I've taken my mom numerous times but nobody really seems to have any answers for me.  The thrush is, I believe, caused by the dryness/due to Mirena. Me and my boyfriend are currently trying out abstaining for a month or so while we both take courses of meds.  I've tried various typed of condoms and they all have a similar effect, causing itching and soreness, even non-lubricated ones :( I'm very sensitive to a lot of things down there I think haha! But thank you <3  Ps I've just reread my post and I apologise - it reads so terribly haha! I'm writing this in fits and starts at work hence the inability to string a sentence together hahahaha"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,3cj5ex,probably_a_bitch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:57:19 2015 UTC,"Hello, I am an expert on this matter. I have been through a very similar hell. The fact that you have ruptured ovarian cysts while on hormonal birth control is a very good indicator that you have endometriosis. Have you ever experienced painful sex? The laparoscopy is a good idea. Are your cysts hemorrhaging blood? Has an ultrasound shown fluid in your pelvis? If so, you need surgery sooner than later.  So I understand your doctors reasoning. The implant is progesterone only. Regular birth control contains estrogen which makes endometriosis worse. I tried the depoprovera shot which is also progesterone only and hated the side effects. I gained weight and started experiencing arthritic symptoms. These two options also cause osteoperosis. So I have settled on birth control pills with the lowest dose of estrogen possible. Progesterone only pills do not suppress ovulation well enough. That's what I was on when my cysts ruptured and I needed emergency surgery. Unfortunately, if you have endometriosis you will HAVE to be on hormonal birth control until menopause.   I know this is too late, but if you have any questions after your appointing I am here."
