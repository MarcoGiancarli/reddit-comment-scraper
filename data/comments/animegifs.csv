animegifs,3e1axf,mikaosol,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:21 2015 UTC,lol I worked on this gif harder than people would think. I actually tried matching Gohan's lips to the English words. I learned it from the guy who edits dbz abridged and wanted to see if I could pull it off myself.

animegifs,3dzt8m,O2mike0,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:24 2015 UTC,Highlander: The Search for Vengeance. Arguably the most recognizable part of that movie.
animegifs,3dzt8m,Asiansensationz,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:56 2015 UTC,Isn't there a video of this?
animegifs,3dwlw3,O2mike0,6,Mon Jul 20 03:31:15 2015 UTC,"Fun fact:  Same people who worked on Cowboy Bebop also worked on Samurai Champloo, Ergo Proxy, and the currently ongoing Gangsta."

animegifs,3dufiq,x-skeww,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, so immature. In the show, it was actually a rocket punch in the balls.  There were 25 frames and I just took the first 12. He moved too far to the left in the second half of that scene. I was surprised how seemingly well it loops.  Did nothing special with this one. Just pattern dithering and a selective palette. Original timing."

animegifs,3dm77l,Mepwn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:03:19 2015 UTC,"Hello, here's my first album of the series I'm planning to do called ""Random albums"" (horrible name, I know). This is where I post most of my albums that I've made since December in alphabetical order. This will be posted every three days to bridge the gap between my end of season albums. Here's a spreadsheet of this series for your convenience.  Fourth album is Chihayafuru 2. Pretty much same story behind this one as was for the previous. Just now with more and one gif of an actual karuta match! Oh, forgot. There are gifs for the OVA in this one as well. But their resolution messed up for some reason...  Next one will be Clannad + After Story.    Update: Will be adding Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei to the list. (Unfinished)"
