The owner, Altino, was the nicest guy, and he took us all over the island showing us all the hot springs, and recommended the best places to eat in town. 10/10 would absolutely stay there again. He even managed to get us a meal at a restaurant that was slow-cooked with geothermal heat for 6+ hours, with all locally grown and raised food! The local food there is amazing.

The island is based on piles of stones, that had to be carried there by the local fishermen in their boats. Between 1765 and 1767 it was turned into a military fortress by William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe. His vision was an impenetrable getaway in his own land. In 1772, the first German submarine, Steinhuder Hecht, was constructed on the island."

VillagePorn,3dc6dj,OWKuusinen,2,Wed Jul 15 08:06:58 2015 UTC,"Dead things tend to get gassy so I'd imagine they float. Since they still move, they will also swim."
VillagePorn,3dc6dj,Cidlicious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:10:23 2015 UTC,"This all starts to be highly academic, but I would expect that the zombies are unable to learn new skills? They just repeat what they knew in life -- poorly.   And I don't know anything about dead things being gassy, but human body floats because it's largerly water. Zombies would dry as they don't drink enough. Rotting meat isn't air-tight, so I'd expect possible gasses to escape.   So I'd say that zombies wouldn' learn to swim, and after few days dead, they couldn't swim as they used to in life, so that skill is useless."
VillagePorn,3dc6dj,OWKuusinen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:17:06 2015 UTC,At least they'll flounder around while floating. A lake full of zombies flailing their arms in water just feels comedic. OR they can walk underwater but I haven't put much thought into that.

Zombies don't seem to randomly start walking out into bodies of water, in fact I don't recall seeing a zombie cross water in any zombie show/movie I've seen.  Now if for some reason you could draw their attention from the island to the shore, then maybe they'd all start to try and cross the water making a zombie bridge of sorts."

You don't go in water over your head if you can't swim.  I'm going by what movies and tv shows show zombies doing because there hasn't been any other way to observe them.

Then I flew back home because school was gonna start and also probably my parents were sick and tired of being around a moody teenager :-P  Man, I hadn't thought about this in ages. It was 1983, I remember because I saw ""Return Of The Jedi"" on that road trip.  Spent a lot of time in movie theaters on that trip, watched ""Twilight Zone"" (SF), ""Private School"" (Eureka), ""Stayin' Alive"" (Coos Bay), ""Jedi"" (Salem), ""Jaws 3D"" (Portland), ""Psycho 2"" (Seattle), ""Trading Places"" (Seattle), ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" (Eureka), finally in Salt Lake City I saw ""Baby, It's You"", probably the best of the bunch now that I look back on it.  Bought a lot of music tapes, too.  Some of them good (Bowie's ""Let's Dance"", Genesis ""Three Sides Live""), some of them bad (Loverboy's ""Keep It Up"", Stevie Nicks' ""The Wild Heart"")."

VillagePorn,3cpgfk,trtryt,6,Fri Jul 10 01:00:07 2015 UTC,"For me, an American, I'd consider any town under about 15,000 a village. However, theres not really any such thing as a village here. Small places are towns, big places are cities. When I picture villages I imagine them either way out in the forests or in the mountains (which is where Jackson, Wyoming is)."

That's not representative of the town of Vang Vieng itself, which is more built up, but the countryside around the town looks just like that... nicer actually.  The town of Vang Vieng is mostly bars filled with European college students lying around on these giant couches watching TV, drinking red-bull and whiskey, and eating marijuana-laced pizza after a day spent floating down the river on inner tubes.  Fantastic place."

VillagePorn,3ckscw,Legendofsnack,2,Thu Jul 9 00:53:34 2015 UTC,Yeah but in the first place there may have been buildings where the train station is now. Maybe it's just less ugly when you're down in the town.

It definitely is giving me a similar vibe to the one in Spain with it's proximity to the Ocean. Beautiful place either way."
VillagePorn,3c398s,TomShoe,2,Sat Jul 4 13:00:39 2015 UTC,"Correct, Saint Sebastian of the West.   I wonder if that's a reference to San Sebastian in Spain   According to Wikipedia, in Mexico alone there are at least 11 towns named San Sebastian, 12 more in the rest of Latin America, 5 in Spain and 2 in The Philippines.  At least. These being primarily Catholic countries, all of these towns derive the name directly from Saint Sebastian, the early Christian saint and martyr, not necessarily as a reference to another town.   Beautiful place either way There's an official classification in Mexico for certain towns that meet special qualifications - Pueblo Mágico (Magic Town).  As of 2015 there are 83 such places, San Sebastián is one of them.   This is the fifth post in the last week of Mexican towns that I've been to, I'm only posting photos of places that I've visited, a nice little trip down memory lane.  In 1995 I was living in Guadalajara, drove to San Sebastián alone one weekend as a little adventurous road trip, 5 or 6 local boys followed me around the town on Saturday and that evening I ended up having dinner with them at the fonda (rustic diner), they didn't wanna eat, I bought them orange juices.  The next day before leaving we went to the local store and I bought them a soccer ball.  A local resident, member of the Huichol tribe, found me a couple of bottles of the legendary local moonshine, called raicilla.  Such a friendly, guileless place, I hope it remains that way forever."
