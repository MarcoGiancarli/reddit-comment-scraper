I'm not being sarcastic or intentionally dense.   Edit 2: It's not IGC's fault; it's just an exp. area game mechanic. I apologize if I accidentally implied it was IGC's passive. I meant to illuminate the reasoning behind lane players preferring to be left alone (for the most part). They also last-hit with a rhythm that is WAY more difficult to achieve when another hero with different stats comes up to ""help."" There is exp. and gold waiting for you in the jungle, where you aren't limiting your laner's resources."

Don't nuke self /  team with a bubbled Catherine nearby, or risk stun if you don't have reflex block.   Do give gift of wrath to heroes that synergise well (Saw, ringo, etc).

The most important thing I can recommend is to begin moving to the next camp before the current one dies. Once you move out of range of a monster and it starts attacking your jungler, you have a 5 second window of time where if that monster dies, your carry will still get the 25% gold bonus for letting you tank. The only thing you have to watch for is not moving out of range to get the 50% gold bonus for being nearby, but with a little practice, you'll always be several steps ahead of your jungler."

I think x retsu has a lot of potential to play around with  A full on cloud partical black  taka would be cool too. Except I'd do away with the box. The second you press his B the cloud shaped taka would instantly disappear and you turn into semi translucent particles. The smoke monster from LOST would be a good inspiration

vainglorygame,3e45r3,UnforgivenVainGlory,3,Tue Jul 21 20:36:03 2015 UTC,Map awareness I think is the best thing I think I've brought from league including the points you mentioned
vainglorygame,3e45r3,TehFawkes,2,Tue Jul 21 20:52:17 2015 UTC,Coming from a lot of lol playing I am really good at blaming my teammates when I die...  But really most important is trying not to die. Also watching the map constantly. Also knowing when and when not to go for map objectives (newer players always will want to do kraken over taking a free turret just cuz its the KRAKEN). I think overall just a sense of knowing when something is not worth the risk involved really helps me steamroll.
vainglorygame,3e45r3,ackshunpact,2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"Not a MOBA, but from PvP in World of Warcraft I feel I had an early advantage in understanding how teammates can coordinate their abilities for synergy, and also how to anticipate when enemies might use an ability so that I'm ready to counter it.   Also the idea of min/maxing stats - the efficiencies of the right build, managing cooldowns, health pots and infusions, that extra jungle creep kill or two, always staying active and doing something productive, etc. may not seem very significant by themselves but in aggregate they can add up to a significant advantage.   Plus map awareness."

And now I main a Catherine.  Also the idea of surrendering just seems to wrong to me since that game didn't have the option and I refuse to ever use it.

Counter-build to decide the order of your defense items. Atlas Pauldron for WP; Fountain for everything, crucible against stun-heavy team compositions or teams with powerful ultimate, Aegis against CP. Constantly buy mines/flares and create vision. Leave your laner alone and don't touch their minions. Barely focus on damage output at first, and you'll more easily use effective team reflex blocks from crucible."

vainglorygame,3e2pcm,SciDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:40 2015 UTC,Consider getting Ringo first since playing as him will help you better learn how to last hit lain minions over time. Glaive can be played as support or jungle but the second character I recommend is Cathrine because you'll learn about stuns. She can also help in learning how to be a good support since she doesn't do a ton of damage like Glaive. If you are going to buy all 3 of the 800 glory heros then I'd buy Cashka last since you will need only a few games to learn how she works right before jumping into ranked and most people play glaive similar to Kashka. I also sent you a friend request my IGN (in game name) is SciDog.
vainglorygame,3e2pcm,ThreeBlindMice_7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Vainglory!  Glaive is a very versatile hero. I only ever use him in the jungle because he's a bit easier to play with there, I feel, and it allows you to gank more consistently, as the enemy laner doesn't always have eyes on you. As for the cheapest heroes, I would definitely recommend giving them a try. Ringo is a ""safer"" laner in that he's a ranged carry who's burst is insane. At your level, people are less prone to focus and delete a carry, so Ringo's even stronger for it. Koshka is a jungle assassin that tends to go pure CP or CP with a few support items. I prefer the latter of the two. Catherine is a relevant support who's ability to disrupt the enemy team is crucial. Be sure to educate yourself on exactly how Ironguard Contract works before you start supporting, if you don't already know."

vainglorygame,3e4fo2,Malgus234,2,Tue Jul 21 21:53:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think this is reasonable. Unfortunate yes- however reasonable. Seeing as you were put into deserter queue, you either are relatively new or have deserted frequently in the past since typically it takes more than one incident to be put into the queue. Aside from that point, while it's unfortunate for you especially since it wasnt intentional, it's not fair to teammates who are not disconnecting to be with a player who abandons, intentionally or not, and the abandoner shouldn't be paired with players who don't abandon until they can show that they will no longer abandon matches. I used the word abandon a lot there."
vainglorygame,3e4fo2,Jajajack14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:43 2015 UTC,I had disconnected a few other games (also because of internet issues) but every time (including the last one) it was only for a minute or two and then I was back and finished the game to the end. It would be nicer if being put in the deserters queue was based more on the afk votes. Especially since it is a mobile game and phones have a but more unstable connections when compared to computers
vainglorygame,3e4fo2,Glory_DrEvil,2,Wed Jul 22 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah they already give you a two minute window to return.

And, I don't know about anyone else, but I downvote for afk even if the person returns.. You'd be encouraging more afk behavior if it was up to downvotes cause most people probably wouldn't use them."

It is completely possibly to get a skin from cards dropped after matches and from using glory boxes. This is the ONLY moba that I am aware of that even gives you any chance of getting a cosmetic option without spending any money. Of course, buying ICE speeds up this process, but that option is there for those that want to and are able to support SEMC. Plus, they want the Tier 3 skins to be more prestigious. People wouldn't feel as greatly about having a T3 skin if everyone had it, even if it is still an awesome skin.   TLDR: ""When everyone's super, no one will be."" -Syndrome (The Incredibles)"

vainglorygame,3e3v1d,Mattpalmq,20,Tue Jul 21 19:22:27 2015 UTC,Disagree. I always refuse to surrender and I hate all the people who keeps spamming to surrender. I won a lot of games who I thought It was over.  And the joy after this type of matches is great.
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,daniellidio,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:59 2015 UTC,But your team mates obviously have given up so why force them to waste their time?
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,halcyon400,5,Tue Jul 21 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"When a teammate offers to surrender, sometimes we are legit too far behind or out-skilled, but sometimes it's because they think that I or our other teammate made some mistakes and they have lost confidence in us.  Maybe mistakes were made but I am confident that we can play better. Or maybe they weren't even mistakes but this teammate misinterpreted some situations and is being impatient. In these cases I often think that if they'd just focus and start working together we can turn it around and possibly win. And sometimes we do.   Why should I waste my time already invested in a match by surrendering just because someone else was impatient or doesn't see the possibilities as well as I do?"

So, the concise answer is that I place value on different aspects of competition than you do.   Edit: I said ""not particularly enjoyable,"" not that those wins ""weren't worth it.""

vainglorygame,3e3v1d,-Avatar-Korra-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:29 2015 UTC,Agree. I just thought it was worth mentioning that I occasionally misread a game.
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,GSAGasgano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"Getting lucky happens. Why deny yourself the opportunity to get lucky? You'll just roll the dice again with the next match maker line up, and you'll more likely to be setting yourself up to get worse teammates."
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,Nexuslife,5,Tue Jul 21 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"Hi, i dont 100% agree with you. For me it is how much impact i can make in the current game.  For example if i was the Jungler/Carry and I knew with just one fight i could change the game i would never surrender!"
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,TSRodes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"This so much. I love plaything Catherine because who she uses her skills on can decide who wins the fight. Just had a game where the enemy got the Kraken twice, once during and ace and a second stolen. We were down without and turrets and they had 3 turrets. Was able to hold off a Koshka and Catherine long enough for teammates to Respawned and we got an ace. Wiped the floor afterwards, it was so satisfying.   Wouldn't have won if it wasn't for that one fight."
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,camahroon,3,Tue Jul 21 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"Strongly disagreeing here. And lately i face many people who want to surrender because someone taxed their lanes or didnt react properly to an invade or whatever. They just ragespam questionmark for one more minute and if they are still satisfied they surrender midgame where everything is still open. And then obviously we wont surrender, so they simply sit in base, doing nothing but pinging to annoy.  This is barely on topic, but i also dislike surrender because i feel thats not part of sportsmanship. you dont surrender in any sport i know except fighting sports, and never because you cant lose. You queued up for that game, so you play it until the end. no sissy surrender just because you realise midloss that there actually better things to do.  Edit: sry for poor englando. Being angry doesn't help."
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,Spratticus,3,Tue Jul 21 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. The bigger issue is the clowns who think it's time to surrender, and if their teammates disagree, they just sit in base, ping spam, spam smiley faces, make a half-assed attempt to help, or any combination of these.  I have won many games now where it looked like we certainly were going to lose. If you fight to the last second and help your teammates, you'd be surprised what can happen. One Ace in late game and that's all you need to come back."

vainglorygame,3e3v1d,ackshunpact,2,Tue Jul 21 20:46:35 2015 UTC,"Here's my guidelines for accepting a surrender vote verses declining one...  Accepting Surrender - Need two to surrender   We are down three turrets ( we have taken down 0, and we have 2 left ) Their carry has twice as many kills as our team Someone from my team deserted the match I have to leave ( *No I won't just leave a game, I will surrender so I don't leave my teammates hanging, if they say no, I just keep going until the game is over, sorry hun  )   Declining Surrender   Everything not covered above. Everything...   People maybe made at my lack of accepting surrenders, but I have had too many games turn around from one bad decision from my opponents to just throw in the towel, If they are close to winning, give them the satisfaction of taking their team all the way to victory."
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,upstart_crow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:19 2015 UTC,Those sounds like fine guide lines. I have my own:  Surrender Vote: YES   I'm not having fun (This only happens when someone is relentlessly ping spamming and spending more time on mocking/harassing his teammates rather than helping them)   Surrender Vote: NO   I still think I can learn something from the game. I want to give my opponents the satisfaction of seeing our vain crystal explode.
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,MacawsInMacau,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"As a person who nearly always refuses to surrender, I'm sorry you feel that way. The only time I surrender is when a teammate is being intolerable (usually ping spamming).   I've actually won games where a player DCed. It doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes they come back, and sometimes, the two remaining players can be good enough on their own, that they can actually pull out a victory.  I don't see learning how to play while you're down as a waste of time. I see it as a learning experience, and maybe the opportunity to pull off something truly glorious. Nothing feels better than an awesome comeback.  When I'm playing with non-toxic players, I find every minute of the game to be fun - even when losing. In short, I'd much rather see our vain crystal blow up due to the other teams ability than my own teams inability to get along and give it their all."
vainglorygame,3e3v1d,Devmax1868,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"No I disagree. If im having fun I won't surrender regardless of how much you, as my teammate, flood me with questions mark pings,  whine and spam surrender and plant scout traps in the base. Don't care."

Although it isn't a household name just yet, already having a world competition with major prize payouts is a grand feat in itself. You mention Hearthstone and LOL, but you have to understand that those are completely different situations. Hearthstone is backed by a major gaming company in Blizzard, and LOL already has an established name for itself. It's still a bit too early for VG.   I actually saw their outfits as very professional. I liked it much better than some of the casual wear by EVO broadcasters I saw this weekend. Their English grammar may not be the best, but they do have VG broadcasting experience from commentating ESL cup matches. This was their very first world tournament. Give it time."

They were pretty good overall.  Really what has always bugged me about esports commentating is they find people who are good at just talking nonstop but they never really say anything interesting. Very much quantity over quality. I really like the tastosis style from sc2 where they mix a lot of humor with the commentary as well as overall knowledge about the game, strategy, builds and whatnot. I pretty much hated every single LoL caster."

Forgive me saying so, but it is the way it comes across.   I wish the commentators would make less factual errors, which is why I find their comments sometimes not as useful as if it were coming from an actual pro player.   As a native German speaker I feel like defending Blueberry and DonJon, at the same time their English is really lacking in parts. However, especially because this is a World Tournament it almost should not be reserved for English native speakers to comment on an international event. No such prerogative should exists, merely because of a convention on a Lingua Franca.   What gives me cultural cringes about Germanic culture however is a certain blindness towards statements, which come accross as passive aggressive (a term which does not even exist in German) or when DonJon seems to be a bit of a know-it-all: “No I don't actually think so…”.   Overall I think they are doing an OK job, for game being young, and them being new to the whole shout-cast thing on an international stage."
vainglorygame,3e3tnu,theSDRexperiment,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:34 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with them being foreign English speaking commentators, heck they have this event commentated in four(I think?)

vainglorygame,3e2w72,cmikeb1,6,Tue Jul 21 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you're playing a good support! I could be having the same problem, but I have accepted that I sacrifice a lot of EXP in exchange for a very strong jungle partner. My job isn't to do damage; it's to stun, bleed, heal, block and create vision."
vainglorygame,3e2w72,TSRodes,4,Tue Jul 21 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"You're doing it right. It is normal for a well fed carry to rush lvl 12 while others lag behind, specially the support. You must stick to your jungle carry all the time. To maximize your earnings/XP, if by any means your jungle carry die and the teamfight is over, follow the laner until your partner respawns. TL;DR: not much you can do."
vainglorygame,3e2w72,DiamondtearLeo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"Totally agree here, when I run support, I try to make sure my jungle carry's level outpaces the competition vs. what my level is at. If I can stun and soak damage at level 4-5 and my jungle carry is at 7 while the competition is behind, you'll have a good chance in a team fight."
vainglorygame,3e2w72,nickmkats,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, it seems like you're doing it right if you're a level or two behind. The only thing I would add is those moments when your jugular is being successful in the lane and your teammates don't need you for 30 seconds or 45 seconds run into the jungle   and kill 2 or three camps  just for yourself especially if your jungle carry is already level 12.    it helps a little.   I find this especially true when I play Kochka support. Fortunately she can clear camps extremely quick quickly so I'm hardly out of action long"
vainglorygame,3e2w72,Malodourous,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"In a game the other day the jungler started to ping for me to take last hits once she was level 6 and I was level 5.  I'd never seen this before, is it a valid strategy? Common? She was Koshka and I was Catherine."

If I get jumped and my teammates die I'm usually headed for the turrets anyway.  There is a a situation where I know I'm not going to make it out safe and I have to choose between doing a little extra damage and continuing on to the turret anyway.  Traditionally I opt to do a little more damage, but if I have Ironguard it sounds like a better move is to try to position myself in the confluence of the lane."

vainglorygame,3e2w72,iOSJunkie,0,Tue Jul 21 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I think the idea of some characters being forced to level more slowly is a legacy MOBA concept that only makes sense to those who have played other MOBAs. To a person who's first MOBA is Vainglory, this concept probably doesn't make much sense.  I think this might be one reason why Heroes of the Storm (a newer MOBA) has a team level, rather than individual hero levels. When your team as a whole gathers enough experience points, everyone levels up at the same time."
vainglorygame,3e2w72,jklick,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:30 2015 UTC,I have noticed that most good supports end up around level 8 or 9 when the main jungler hits 12.  It would be nice if having IGC evened that out a little bit but its a sacrifice to make for the good of the team.  If you have a jungle team going like this you can oftentimes get your jungler up to 12 when the opponent jungler is 9-10 as well.
vainglorygame,3e2w72,jklick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"I make sure to always hit minions when my teams are taking them down. Naturally this happens when jungling, but even after a gank and pushing turret. Definitely don't last hit l, but snag a little bit of that sweet XP.   Once my teammates are level 12 and well fed, I'll start last hitting and opportunistically solo jungling."
vainglorygame,3e2uwg,oZiix,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"I do not want Vainglory to come to a PC. It's called, ""The MOBA perfected for touch."" If it's allowed to come to the PC, the devs at SEMC will be split in creating new features because a feature that works for tablets can be detrimental to the mouse+keyboard approach, and vice-versa. This means that the features will be released less and less frequently, which means an overall lower-quality game.  Then you have the problem of people being able to more easily modify the game, which could create some serious backlash for the game as a whole when suddenly 100+ people are suddenly Vainglorious Gold because of a bot.   Then you have the reason Vainglory is so popular in the first place and is one of the only MOBA's that doesn't have 10 million people yelling, ""Blah blah League of Legends clone, blah blah Dota clone."" It's only because it's conquering a previously untapped market, the mobile market. Its only competition thus far has been Heroes of Order and Chaos, which is a terribly made game, even by mobile game standards.  So, in conclusion, please don't bring the game to the Windows client."
vainglorygame,3e2uwg,Okami_G,5,Tue Jul 21 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"A Surface 3 is a touch screen that can be used solely like a tablet, that's why I'm asking.  I don't want to play it on my gaming rig with a keyboard and mouse.  They wouldn't have to make new features as Microsoft has pretty much made it that 90% of their code will work in Windows 10 and as long as they use Microsofts API it should be simple.  I understand the ""old school thinking of a PC"" but I've done a lot of reading on the features of windows 10.    There are a lot of touch apps for android that you can play on windows right now with blue stacks, ami duos, I think another is android Andy.    Vainglory happens to be in the 5% that doesn't happen to work I think it's because vainglory is solely on lollipop and not jellybean and ami duos lollipop is in beta right now.  The point would be moot anyway if ami duos will be able to run it when it comes out of beta and you would technically be playing against PC users anyway.     An official avenue would be better and I don't see why they couldn't make t touch only.     I have Xbox Smart glass on my iPhone, surface, desktop, and ultrabook(which is also touch screen).   On my desktop which isn't touch you have to use directional arrows to navigate the home screen.  On my surface and ultrabook I can scroll the touch screens, I can scroll with 2 fingers on the trackpad, but I can't scroll with a mouse because there is no cursor in the app."
vainglorygame,3e2uwg,Okami_G,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:23 2015 UTC,"I understand that you don't want to use a keyboard+mouse rig, I'm simply stating that a Windows 10 version will make it very easy for those who do want it to implement it. Windows is a well known system, and many people are able to rig the game to work with keyboard+mouse much easier if a Windows version was released. I just wanted to point out the potential backlash of a Windows version. And I am very sorry that you're unable to play the game as of now."
vainglorygame,3e2uwg,tcbringhurst,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:08 2015 UTC,Having to control your character through a mouse is actually a lot harder than touch. I tried playing heroes of the storm (MOBA by Blizzard for PC) and couldn't get past the fact that I can only use one mouse to control my character. Kiting was twice as hard. So I don't think there would be a significant advantage for people using a mouse.
vainglorygame,3e2uwg,upstart_crow,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:50 2015 UTC,Windows is and has been optimized for touch for years now. Maybe think before shooting people's ideas down.
vainglorygame,3e2uwg,Okami_G,0,Wed Jul 22 01:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it is also optimized for non-touch screen devices. Because of this, by implementing a Windows 10 version which can be supported by the Windows tablet, it also can be accessed very easily by normal, non-touch devices running Windows 10. Even if SEMC tries to make that impossible, it would be very easy to work around. I'm not trying to shoot someone's idea down, I'm simply stating why such an idea could have very real backlash among the general community."

Granted, that's a 1 out of 1024 chance. But there's 1.5 million players out there playing millions of games, so there are many opportunities for a statistically unlikely thing to happen. And if you were on tilt, then each event isn't even independent. Maybe your casual ELO had climbed too high by random chance and you were just falling back to your expected level.  It would be more helpful to provide specific examples of games where you think the matchmaker could have done better. Were you teamed with 2 ask again laters against a triple vainglorious party?   It would be even MORE helpful to critically analyze why you are losing and think if there's anything different you should be doing."

Every single game lately I've been wrecked. Are you trying to say I'm that bad? Or that unlucky? If I suck why aren't I paired against people who also suck? It all makes no sense to me.  I know I'm not the best but I'm DEFINITELY not the worst and this matchmaking makes me feel like I'm terrible.  Edit - here's the results of my latest match http://imgur.com/u88lmp4"
vainglorygame,3e3l06,dubiousatbest,6,Tue Jul 21 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Likely you've just been unlucky. You can't have a big win streak or lose streak without luck. Matchmaker can't screw everyone. I doubt SEMC has programmed the matchmaker to mess with you.   I'm not saying you're good or you're bad. If I had to guess how ""good"" you are, I'd like to know what your current ELO tier is--or really the running average of your ELO tier over the past 3 weeks. That's probably how good you are.   Those teammates you get matched up with--half the time they are better than you and half the time they are worse. If you think that the majority of them are worse, you are probably wrong. This is important so I'll say it again. Unless you are in the top ELO tiers (POA silver and up maybe?) the people on your team are likely just as good as you, maybe better, every single game. That means you can potentially learn something from at least one of your teammates in most games.   Here are reasons you might perceive them to be worse:  1) They may be better at some parts of the game and worse at others. Maybe they are better than you at team fight micro but bad at decision making. Their decision making pisses you off, but guess what, overall they are just as good as you.   2) You may not realize they are making the correct decision. I'm sure this has happened to you if you ever played with new players. They ?? you on something that you are sure is correct. They just don't know. Similarly, you don't know what you don't know. And you'll never learn if you don't keep an open mind and try to understand it.   3) They just had a bad game. Happens a lot.  I often see people complain that the only thing holding them in lower tiers is bad teammates. They think once they get to a higher tier, they'll be fine because they will be with players of their own skill level. This is patently ridiculous. If one is really that good, it's easy to level up when your ELO falls below its expected level.   TL;DR - It's mostly bad luck. But you'll improve more by analyzing your own play than thinking your teammates suck. The good news is your ELO has fallen so much that your next casual games should be easy."

Those people may be worse than you at knowing how to use the jungle shop, but they're better than you at something else.   If every game you're playing with people who don't know how to use the jungle shop, that means your ELO is generally as low as very new or inexperienced players. Rather than looking down on them you should use it as an opportunity to better yourself. If such players are consistently winning as often as you are, your play probably has many potential areas for improvement."

vainglorygame,3e3l06,jklick,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"I've found that when I get frustrated with the game, it's because my objective was to win. Once I learned to focus on making sure that every game I learned something new, not only did this reduce my stress level, but my skill level steadily increased and I felt like I had more control over the games I played. This led to more wins.  I'd encourage to focus less on winning and more on observing/learning - which, by the way, often leads to winning. Notice what the other team is doing to be successful. Notice what you can be doing better to prevent that. Notice what your teammates are doing well (or poorly). Notice what you could do to complement your team better, via play style or item build. The list goes on."
vainglorygame,3e3l06,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:27 2015 UTC,I think that may be your problem. Getting upset to the point of deleting the app generally points to you just being salty and not really learning much to get ahead.

I've had kind of better results in ranked (granted, i played with a really odd Joule today that seemed to be magnetized to the enemy jungle today) just because most players in rank are seriously trying to win and climb.

It has frustrated me so much that I've refunded any money I've spent because it just is unbearable. Short fixes that I do are constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the game, rebooting my device, and restarting my router. 200-300 ping sounds like a dream to me.

vainglorygame,3dzpfp,Swinerat,4,Mon Jul 20 23:25:42 2015 UTC,"Rushed fountain and crucible. Placed scout traps better. And, they needed to be all together. For Unknown, Vox was stuck farming lane for most of the match, while his jungle buddies got slaughtered. Armada never had the laner actually farming, unless strictly necessary."
vainglorygame,3dzpfp,srgjager,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:41 2015 UTC,Extra health counters the burst from Tension Bow. So everyone on NKN should have gotten a Dragonheart or Reflex Block (or even Armor) fairly early on.
vainglorygame,3dzpfp,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:44 2015 UTC,Precisely!
vainglorygame,3dzpfp,srgjager,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"Largely it was things that their support should've been doing better, like clearing scout traps and counter building more appropriately. Also, as was pointed out by the shoutcasters, they didn't use their bans effectively. They should've banned out Adagio in the second round.   Also, in the second round you saw Unknown parroting some of Armada's tactics, like the 3man-roam. But they didn't do it very selectively. I tried to highlight why and when Armada did what they did, and they only did that roam when they were pushing a lead, if they needed to get ahead, they farmed. When Unknown was doing that roaming, they cost themselves some farm.   They also should've been more aggressive themselves, in the second round they knew what they were up against and should've went with something that could've stood up in the early game (i.e., not Vox).   Once they got behind there wasn't much they could do, because Armada played really solid and made very few mistakes."
vainglorygame,3dzpfp,DiamondtearLeo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:03 2015 UTC,"Came to think that, what if they had the minion mine by their side earlier?

vainglorygame,3dzpfp,divergence-aloft,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"I believe they take the minion mine in one of the matches, but there's enough rotation happening that it's only give them more farm."

vainglorygame,3e2bzc,golf153,4,Tue Jul 21 12:28:50 2015 UTC,Generally it is good to start with a Fountain against mixed carries. I strongly recommend you to rush Atlas Pauldron if facing a Krul though. Krul must never be fed. He snowballs a lot to the mid-late game.
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,DiamondtearLeo,4,Tue Jul 21 12:45:24 2015 UTC,I build against whoever focuses me down in team fights.
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,WSBowman,3,Tue Jul 21 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know about other people but I build against what has the most kills.  If one character is WP and has more kills than the other two combined, I build armor. If two characters are CP and have more kills combined than the third, I build Aegis.   This doesn't hold up all the time because sometimes the other team has one character that does a lot of damage and another who comes in to finish off, but generally speaking it works."
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,ParadoxPenis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with that, but I think it's important to look to late game and see if that factors in to your build. Deciding to emphasize my build toward who the late game carry is and not so much who was doing the deeps at the beginning has saved me a couple times."
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,shweek,0,Tue Jul 21 13:38:35 2015 UTC,"Most kills isn't really a good metric. As an extreme example, I recently went 11-5 as a full tank Catherine. This was just because I happened to deliver the killing blows, not because I was an actual threat.   As a carry, you should build defense against your biggest threat. If a Koshka or Taka keeps bursting you down to 0 health, you should probably build shield defense. This is regardless of whether or not the enemy Ringo has the most kills.  As a support, you're trying to watch for what's killing your carries and building items such as Atlas Pauldron, Crucible, or Fountain to help protect them for their greatest threats. Sometimes your carry doesn't realize what their greatest threat is, so you need to figure it out for them and make sure to build accordingly."
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,jklick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"This was just because I happened to deliver the killing blows, not because I was an actual threat.   Yeah... hence why I said sometimes it doesn't apply. But the majority of the time it absolutely is the best quick way to tell what is happening.    As a carry, you should build defense against your biggest threat.   This depends entirely on how the other team is playing. Again, as I stated in my original comment, sometimes the rule doesn't apply.   Your post makes all sorts of underlying assumptions, and for someone who is just getting into counterbuilding, my method works very well most of the time."
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,ParadoxPenis,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"I find shield to be much more useful than armor except in certain situations/comps since abilities are where most of the damage comes from for most heroes except ranged weapon carries. Plus fountain is a boss item.  Sometimes the situation calls for armor, such as fed taka, vox, Ringo, and Krul for the Atlas pauldrons even though most of his damage is abilities. Also fed glaive I believe his cleave does weapon damage."
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,ackshunpact,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:16 2015 UTC,I usually go fountain + shield/armor for counter builds. Even Crucible if you don't feel like putting so much money into the defensive part of your build.
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,ChapterLiam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"As glaive, I build fountain plus pauldron since glaive already has high natural health. As taka, I'd go health and cp defense, because taka has low natural health and if you are being autoattacked down, you are doing it wrong. Other heroes vary similarly."
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,FinndBors,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"On carries I generally go for reflex block and upgrade it into either Crucible or Aegis if the enemy has a lot of CP or just single target hard CC that i can block. Fountain may still seem attractive but keep in mind: Takas or even Fortress lethal wounds will reduce the healing drastically, rendering it pretty much useless."
vainglorygame,3e2bzc,UnforgivenVainGlory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:06 2015 UTC,"Its useful to know who does what damage by what amount in general. By example a ringo will do more weapon damage to you then a fortress will do crystal damage. Easy example, but if you are able to realise who is the biggest threat in general you can make better adjustments. Step 2 would be to check in game build paths. Because if ringo builds crystal my example isn't true anymore. Step 3: who is likely to target you. Chances are that crystal ringo will completely ignore you if you play tank ardan. If you play vox with 4 offensive items, that brew will fly to you. And last, if it's still unclear, just build shield. Everyone does crystal damage even if they build weapon."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,jacksonfrostson,5,Tue Jul 21 08:35:49 2015 UTC,IMO every player in ranked should be able to play all roles. This would make it worse.
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,Ares-2,3,Tue Jul 21 12:59:15 2015 UTC,Exactly!
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,DiamondtearLeo,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:29 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of being able to play all roles. It's a matter of being able to play what role you want to play at all times and avoiding grouping up people that are going to fight over the same role, to the detriment of their teammate."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,Ares-2,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:07 2015 UTC,"Thats the instalock mindset. A player wants to play a hero, thinks he's better than his teammates and doesn't care about teamwork. Picking a good teamcomp is very important and new players have to learn this. We shouldn't make it easier for instalock SAWs and give them an option to pick a hero even faster."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"It may be a problem with the mindset, however, it still happens. This feature would help soften the blow of that mindset on the rest of the community.   All that said, I would also like to see a role called ""fill"" where you're game to play any role that is necessary."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,ChapterLiam,4,Tue Jul 21 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"That's not the OP's point. While I agree with you, I just find playing Lane worse than Jungle and Support. I main Catherine, Taka, and Celeste (for each role) and while I can effectively play each role very well, I don't find lane as enjoyable."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,Ares-2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"Thats fine, its normal to prefer some heroes. There's a big difference between wanting to play a hero and instalocking/locking before the hero select."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,Zaggaz,4,Tue Jul 21 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I think it would lead to 20 minute waits for lane and jungle, but immediate queueing for supports."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,kaivorb,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yup, and the way to fix this? Learn to play another role and choose it when you queue. If you want to ""stick"" with jungle, then you learn to have patience.   This is why I learned to play support in the first place. No one wanted it, and people loved me when I did it well.   And this would be just like playing a ""role"" position like Cleric in EQ or WoW. You always got groups super quickly. Unlike being a Bard or necro, which was more fun but not wanted as much.   Life is full of choices. I like this idea myself.   Oh, and I agree about being able to play all three roles. Would make the game so much easier if everyone did this. But they don't. And not everyone plays at ranked or high level. Some of us are lower level and have to put up with autolockers. This would help."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,SciDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:23 2015 UTC,I know this can take a while but find a group to play with and tell them you prefer if they didn't auto lock in.
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,GSAGasgano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"Well, LoL has this. And ass long queue times because there's little reason to go in that special queue if you want to support anyways. Because support lovers get their role in normal queue 99/100 times. But I feel like there are way more people okay with playing support in VG. For whatever reasons, because it feels like a LoL season 2 throwback where you would do nothing besides babysitting your carry and spending all your money on wards (mines).  I'm exaggerating, but yeah. Not a friend of these queues."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"There are at least two additional potential downsides.  One is that it would give the match maker a harder time trying to match folks, resulting in longer queue times. I've already seen a number of people complaining about how long it takes to find a group some times.  Secondly, it sort of enforces a meta on solo queue groups. Perhaps this isn't all bad for solo queue, but it definitely discourages any experimentation in solo queue.   If this feature ever does come to light, I would recommend that it NOT be implemented in casual queue. I see that as the safe place to experiment and learn."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,JekyllMD,-3,Tue Jul 21 21:38:43 2015 UTC,"I hope you're trolling, since this already exists."
vainglorygame,3e1ttk,TheeNinjaBanana,3,Tue Jul 21 08:46:23 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand him.

vainglorygame,3e1wcp,resto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:11:09 2015 UTC,single t1  base for calculation (23 armor with 741 hp vs 52wp)  52wp/1.23  = 42dmg   741hp/42dmg=17.64 hits  oak heart (+200 health)  941hp/42dmg = 22.40 hits  light armor (+35 = 52 armor)  52wp / 1.52  = 33dmg   741hp/33dmg = 22.45 hits  I'd go with health over armor early as it gives protection against both skills and basic attacks.  But when playing a squishy ranged character I usually go with shield as I'm more likely to take my damage from skills. Shields protect against a percentage of damage so the more damage is coming in the more damage it protects against.
vainglorygame,3e1wcp,zquid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:44 2015 UTC,Taking the above numbers and pretend that someone would have 911 wp (heh) that would kill in one basic attack 911wp/1.23 = 740.65dmg  one oak heart would leave you with 200hp one light armor would leave you with 600hp  So larger damage numbers makes damage specific protection more important.
vainglorygame,3e1wcp,zquid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the numbers. Seems to be common in mobas that health is more efficient early game, but that resistances catch up and surpass as the game goes on. But then again, penetration seems easy to get in VG"

vainglorygame,3e1pmz,DigitalBounce,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"Mine would be Ringo/Koshka, depending on their play style. Really fun heroes who are pretty easy to understand. Additionally, they can be bought with starting Glory."
vainglorygame,3e1pmz,ThreeBlindMice_7,2,Tue Jul 21 08:25:50 2015 UTC,"Koshka and Catherine. I don't find Ringo easy to master TBH.  In early stages of learning Vainglory, with a high likelyhood of the first 200 games spend in ranks pretty good and below, I would almost shy away from recommending any laner at all. Sentiment is: everybody can protect a turret, but jungle control wins a game.  My third recommendation would be: Fortress.  If you want a laner, I find Celeste fun to play. She is difficult though.  For a beginner I would say: Fortress, Koshka, Ringo.  With Catherine it is a typical beginner mistake to waste the stun quickly. Fortress' bleed and Attack of the Pack is very much a no brainer when it comes to team fight benefit."

vainglorygame,3dzqfw,nyadav,2,Tue Jul 21 22:02:32 2015 UTC,Increase her movement speed during her ult? Might be a start
vainglorygame,3dzqfw,Andys29,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"I play Rona and I agree that she could be spiced up a little. That said, when things are clicking with my team, and the enemy team is on it's heals, Rona can be a ton of fun. For instance, I love leaping into a fight for the gold miner, use her ult, life stealing and damaging the entire enemy team and the gold miner. The enemy team is forced to deal with her, leaving your other teams to (hopefully) focus down heroes one by one.   Or they pop a reflex block, you get focused and die.  Are far a suggestions on kit:   Make the second activation of the B ability have a short (tiny even) dash. All to often the enemy simply walks away.  Front load the A ability - move the slow to first tic. Increase the max distance of the A ability slightly.  And maybe reduce the cool down or the C ability if the ability duration was cut short."
vainglorygame,3dzqfw,iOSJunkie,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:52 2015 UTC,Good rule of thumb: new heroes will almost always be tweaked in the next update. SEMC knows Rona isn't doing well; they have all the data on matches with and without her. Give SEMC an update after a hero release and then complain.

vainglorygame,3e16t8,Axel_Foley_,5,Tue Jul 21 04:08:56 2015 UTC,If you're last hitting fine under turret why do you need to punish him solo? If he's pushed on your side of the lane just ping for your team to come gank him. You can always harass with the huge range of your A skill if you know your team is coming soon.
vainglorygame,3e16t8,qdcr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that it puts him in risk of gank, but hardly if the team is uncoordinated."
vainglorygame,3e16t8,extraclevername,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:15 2015 UTC,well then at least you are last hitting well under turret and staying safe without worrying about a fight breaking out on you.
vainglorygame,3e16t8,nyadav,3,Tue Jul 21 22:51:09 2015 UTC,Don't try to trade with him 1v1. Just poke with your A ability to slow him down and then rush out. Once you do his minions will chase you and you can take them closer to your turret. You team can have a better chance to hank him on your side. Your speed is what you need to rely on vs SAW.
vainglorygame,3e16t8,fredandersonsmith,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"I would advice you to always pick book of eulogies when facing SAW in the lane, that can cushion a bit of his bullying. Other than that, have your teammates ganking him all the time. A game against SAW is all about early ganking."
vainglorygame,3e16t8,DiamondtearLeo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:40:51 2015 UTC,"Don't try to trade 1v1 with SAW except when he's doing Suppressive Fire; that's his primary strength. As others have been saying, he's very weak to any sort of CC + gank.   But, if he's chunking away your turret and your teammates won't respond, you'll probably have to trade a bit and back quickly to get turret aggro. If SAW knows what he's doing, then he won't stand close to turret anymore if he doesn't want to get caught out in slow mode."
vainglorygame,3e16t8,extraclevername,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:14:45 2015 UTC,"I had this exact problem xD what I do as ringo is upgrade my second ability at level one so you can shoot fast when you play vs a saw you wanna move in zig zags don't make ur movements repetitive or he will get you , you wanna bait saws second ability move close to the minons movie up and down and when he uses it use ur second ablility you can take 2 shots and keep doing it . This is how it works for me idk how it will work for you but never hurts to try good luck bro ! 🍻👌🏼"
vainglorygame,3e16t8,I_Was__Drunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"Hi! I main Ringo so I thought I would chime in. To answer your question you don't 1v1 Saw on equal ground. Farm under your turret and let him over extend. This should lead to ganks and/or team fights. If saw drops his surpressive Fire and misses then feel free to tag him a few times but don't stick around.   Your goal as Ringo against saw is to farm up and wait for team fights. Your higher mobility can get you to the fight faster from lane.  You want to shut down saw early on by forcing his over extension and having the team come gank, or by forcing him out of lane due to him missing to many surprressive fires.   Once a turret drops he is less problematic, the key is surving till then without feeding. If you shut him down because you have a good team then he pretty boned late game, just be weary of his ulti."
vainglorygame,3e16t8,Lawlerfish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"I used to only play SAW until I got beat very badly by a Ringo in lane. He would constantly harass me with his A skill and would always keep his distance to avoid letting me Suppressing Fire on him. Eventually he would wear me down and then he would hard commit to a fight that I didn't have the health for. SAW can't escape from Ringo, so he really got to pick the fights.  Once he had killed me once I was very careful to leave energy up for Roadie Run, but then I lacked trading power. It's not an easy match-up for Ringo players, but it's definitely possible for Ringo players to win the trade and the lane.  Late game, having Ringo is still twice as good as having a SAW."
vainglorygame,3e16t8,adyendrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:26 2015 UTC,All of this is good to know as I main Saw. I don't tend to overextend for this exact reason. I have been ganked too many times to want to remember. I am glad I have changed my strategy now though.

I hold the phone in landscape and use both my big blunt thumbs to play.  It gets VERY hard to selectively target in congested team fights.  Specially when I play Krul, if I do the attack cancelling while fighting more than one opponents, I end up randomly putting stacks on more than one of them rather than targeting a single enemy. So I tend to settle down with simple auto attacking.  It makes me wish for a bigger screen. It really hurts when you end up wasting your burst on a tank when you didn't even mean to do that. I think putting the phone on table and playing with both index fingers might help, but I am so used to playing with the thumbs that I can't think about going back now."

I understand that sometimes dodging is just the best course of action, but I do also believe it's a bad behavior overall and should be discouraged. It's really frustrating to wait a long time for a queue and then get dodged."
vainglorygame,3e1d27,MrTouchnGo,3,Tue Jul 21 06:51:38 2015 UTC,"I know this subject has been discussed to death, and I always have the same answer to this statement.  Waiting a few minutes because of a dodger is 100% better than a one sided game with the possibilities of rage pinging.  It can also be a guaranteed ELO loss of in ranked.  I understand people have a main and can only play that hero. That's their problem though. I main celeste and will always soft lock her, but if needs be ill pick a Catherine or koshka.  But when I have an auto lock saw, Krul, Skaarf  ect.. (after I soft lock of course) I will dodge it.  Laners are important and i don't want to be worrying about having a selfish laner who never leaves there post to help out or pings ""?""

I feel like there is a certain number of abused pings that results in me wishing I had played a different title entirely.   That's nothing against SEMC, though. I just naturally resent people who do not consider MY wants.   My mistake probably lies in overvaluing my time, when the structure of this type of game seems most benefited from a selfless attitude with more give than take.   Thanks for the perspective.   ETA: I really hadn't ever considered the other team being affected by this. Since I have to assume they didn't auto-lock idiotic compositions, I shouldn't inconvenience three innocent people to escape two auto-lockers."
vainglorygame,3e1d27,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, really how much of a pain is it when someone dodges? Whenever I see a teammate dodge the match (bc our 3rd has autolocked or whatever their reason is), I almost all immediately queue right into another game. Like no more than 3 seconds out of queue before being back in.   Was this changed recently (like in the last patch or two?)? Or am I just extraordinarily lucky? Dodging doesn't really bother me as a teammate. Given I'm only doing casual (ranked still too screwy), but does that make a difference?   And the more I play bad games w frustrating teammates, the more I see a queue cool down as maybe a worthy thing to accept. I've never dodged a match yet, but after playing 25 minute games that I could tell were going to be painful after only the first few minutes... I don't know. Those 25 minutes just frustrate me, get me more minimal Glory and don't always make me better (especially when a teammate just feeds the opposing team like they're a marble in a game of Hungry Hungry Hippo). Waiting a few minutes for a better match-up? Might be worth it."
vainglorygame,3e1d27,cowaii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"Before the separate Casual and Ranked queues, nearly every game was a 2:57 queue for me. That meant that if my team got dodged just once, we would be each be waiting for a total of 8ish minutes. And we've been dodged consecutive times, too... one time we couldn't find a game for 40 minutes.  In casual it's less of an issue now, but we still usually wait 1.5 - 2 minutes. I haven't really been doing a whole lot of ranked recently, so I can't say much about it.  Again, I'm not saying you shouldn't dodge. I've done it in the past, and it's something that lets you get maximum enjoyment out of Vainglory. However, you do have to consider that it's a selfish thing to do and screws over the enemy team. If it weren't discouraged with a fairly hefty cooldown, it'd be a heck of a lot more common."

vainglorygame,3dznrc,jklick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:42 2015 UTC,"Unless this behavior is really consistent, don't worry too much about other players pinging you. A lot of people are just as new as you and don't know better. Sometimes, they prefer to solo the minions; a common misconception on new players about jungling.  About Scroll The scroll thingy is called Contract and helps supports/tanks (usually a jungler such as Catherine) earn gold and maintain hp while farming alongside the other jungler (usually a carry, Taka is really popular here). If you have scroll, then let your fellow jungler last hit, otherwise you should last hit.  About First Item/Builds I wouldn't say the Recommended items are bad but they are far from optimized. Your first item should really fit into your build which in turn focuses on your role. If you're a support, then go Contract/scroll thingy. If you're damage/carry, then usually pick a damage item, although this varies. Look at vaingloryfire for info on mainstream builds.   About Jungling At start you should head to the very center (where gold mine is) to farm the double camp near shop and then farm backwards towards base. Jungling works as a cycle and seeks to farm as much as possible and as quickly too, so make sure you're constantly farming. Otherwise, your farm could be stolen if you let it sit for too long."

vainglorygame,3e0ih4,GrandpaSkitzo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"For fortress I think its decent ish because of the natural lifesteal from the B skill, and the heroic perk which deals % of their HP after 6 hits, and you can go pretty tanky with Fortress for the sustain. Honestly though it didn't do as much DPS as I hoped because the fights never lasted long.  EDIT: Basically my goal was to be kind of Krul-ish while being an anti-Krul as well, but I just ended up being mostly playing the same role as I usually do with support Fortress but outputting a little more damage."
vainglorygame,3e0ih4,GrandpaSkitzo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"That's usually what happens to me when I try BP on him, I never get the stacks up enough. I opt for bone saw instead, although lately tension bow and aftershock make for a fun cleanup crew."

vainglorygame,3dz5ns,admiral_bulltraits,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"I prefer Ardan's play style by far, in that he feels very individualized with his skill set. Hitting that perfect bubble or popping a shield to save your buddy with a sliver of HP left is very satisfying.   That said, I almost always would rather see an Ardy over Cath for the opponent lineup. I haven't figured out how to play her effectively but she's far more popular in high level matches and can be an absolute nightmare to play against. Ardan feels like he is more easily countered.   FWIW Fortress is an absolute monster right now. Full defense builds commonly see double digit kills and assists with low deaths in pub games. I own all three but I play with the wolf faaaaaar more often these days."

vainglorygame,3e0cpz,eh-blank-space,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"I recently had a lot of fun when two people locked laners - and I was playing Glaive. I was able to take a full round of jungle camps before the enemy junglers realized that I was a lone, juicy target.   Expecting I was going to get invaded eventually, I had placed a couple of scout traps to give me forewarning. When I saw them coming, I made sure to quickly clear my most valuable camp (the double large in the back). I quickly navigated around them, sneaking along the bottom of the map and I proceeded to steal their jungle, including the double large at the rear. Then, I teleported back to base to shop and avoid dying.  By the time they had realized what happened, they were on their side of the jungle again and my most valuable camp (as well as other camps) were respawning. Wash, rinse, repeat.   Could the enemy team place scout traps to prevent this? Sure. However, if I'm in a game where I've got double laners, I'm also usually in a game where my opponents aren't too bright either."

vainglorygame,3e128r,ChapterLiam,2,Tue Jul 21 03:26:49 2015 UTC,Boots? T3 boots?
vainglorygame,3e128r,VGRedditSmurf,2,Tue Jul 21 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"Something tells me this is a low ELO game. Why not start with Fountain? Warhorn AND Shiversteel over an Atlas Pauldron or a dual Fountain? Tier 3 boots before a Fountain? No slot for vision?  You only built health here, no armour (Atlas Pauldron) or shield (Fountain).  Therefore it was be easier for the opponents to take you down.  Recommended build:  Pick 2:  Fountain, Atlas Pauldron (a must against weapon!), Crucible  Pick 1: Shiversteel, Warhorn   Pick 1:  Any of above mentioned items or: Clockwork, Aftershock  Take tier 1 boots, never upgrade, stay with to your team, so your perk is active. Consider selling boots late game, so you can fit in a 5th team defense item and stay close to team mates so your perk is active  Last slot: mines, flares, and a potential last item could be contraption. However the game will most likely be over, before contraption would be a good investment.   Also, it is not a bad thing necessarily if you die. It is OK to die as support IF your team got an ACE or a 2 for 1 trade over your sacrifice and could secure an objective: Gold Mine or Turret (not Minion Mine). Kraken in itself without taking down at least 2 Turrets is also not a gain.   Also: use your Ult right before team fights, for the health buff and do not waste it for vision."

vainglorygame,3dxv27,Kittizack,4,Mon Jul 20 12:49:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you're playing lane carry, jungle or support. for lane carry, always place a mine next to the bottom bush - this almost always will save you from being ganked. Also watch your jungle team mates and rotate down when they're near jungle shop so you can jungle rush the enemy or shop safely. If you're in jungle, as support, always carry flares (esp against taka) and place mines near shop, kraken/gold mine and near jungle minions for vision. I generally would not get the minion mine too early so to let your laner farm. Ganking techniques comes more with experience and who you play, some great heroes to initiate ganking: adagio's slow, glaives afterburn, joules rocket leap, catherine stun"

The earlier you get it the better, specially against Krul, glaive, Ringo, and vox.  A little less effective on taka cause his abilities deal a ton of damage on their own.  The meta changes fast from patch to patch, and the game right now is the most balanced it's been in a while. But some stand out strong heroes are Celeste vox and koshka who can really carry a team to victory."

Vox is probably a stronger pick than Ringo in lane, but besides that, you have a nice selection. Learning Koshka as a CP carry in jungle is important for the sake of diversity, and Taka is also a very good hero to learn because his kit makes him very independent, and therefore easier to carry with."

I honestly can't imagine him being nerfed anymore without falling off the top - Ringo is in a great place but doesn't have the utility Vox has, otherwise he's just as dangerous with very similar power/low health play type"
vainglorygame,3dz5bp,Malodourous,7,Mon Jul 20 18:37:35 2015 UTC,Congrats you've discovered stutter stepping.  For people who don't know there is a wind up animation an attack then a wind down animation for every auto attack.  When you move you cancel the animation so by canceling the wind down you can move and keep attacking.  When you do this as a ranged character it is called kiting.    A couple updates ago SEMC changed it so that you could not greatly increase your attack speed by stutter stepping (assuming they just made it so you can't start another attack when that wind down animation was supposed to be there).  However you can still get more attacks in because you stay in range longer as opposed to just clicking on the target which only moves your character when they are out of range.    Stutterstepping/kiting is an essential skill at pretty much any tier above PG.   TL;DR stutterstepping
vainglorygame,3dz5bp,neuken_inde_keuken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:03 2015 UTC,You still also get a slight attack speed increase when you stutter step.
vainglorygame,3dz5bp,eh-blank-space,3,Tue Jul 21 00:26:25 2015 UTC,Warhorn and jungling with Vox? I must be out of the loop.   Stutter-stepping works best with at least a Salvo; try to pick up a little attack speed and do it again. You'll love it.   It's also worth noting that you were blessed by a poor enemy decision. Leaving you alone with Kraken was basically a free 1200-1500 gold; way to capitalize on their oversight!
vainglorygame,3dz5bp,TSRodes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Will try it with Salvo, tx!"
vainglorygame,3dz5bp,KingQuet90,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:15 2015 UTC,"Haha yea its just called stutter stepping.  It allows you to attack slightly faster, in the past it allowed you to attack A LOT faster.  The more attack speed you build the better you are at it with Vox I usually have a bp and at least a Salvo building into something late game and may be infused so my attack speed is very high and he's a stutter stepping and kiting machine.  But I know this had to be amazing to discover on your own, you should do it with every hero (ok maybe not Celeste lol) but it works.  Also I wouldn't suggest warhorn on Vox, waste of gold get some more damage items instead or build some defense."
vainglorygame,3dz5bp,JekyllMD,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:00:19 2015 UTC,"You can stutter step with Celeste, but she needs to be WP. She can deal massive damage that way though."

vainglorygame,3dvynt,dubiousatbest,16,Mon Jul 20 00:01:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. My feeling is that there needs to be some kind of carrot for ranked queue other than just skill tier.  I don't think tying it into guild associations is a good idea though, since that still leaves out lots of solo queuers (Edit: I actually like the idea of some type of guild leaderboard, but an additional carrot would be necessary IMO). I like the idea of a glory bonus or a card drop increase in ranked."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,MrTouchnGo,7,Mon Jul 20 00:15:36 2015 UTC,My suggestion is a better drop rate for rare and better cards in ranked queue.
vainglorygame,3dvynt,SmellyPotatoes,3,Mon Jul 20 02:29:26 2015 UTC,I like the idea. I never thought about making it more attractive.
vainglorygame,3dvynt,_DelGriffith_,3,Mon Jul 20 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"I like the glory bonus idea. You could take it a step further by having a tiered ranked glory bonus -- higher tiers earn more glory/ match -- to further incentivize climbing. This would also help to dissuade higher elo players from sitting on their rank: if they don't put elo at risk, they can't get the glory bonus that comes with their rank.  E.g.,  Ask Again Later:           +0 Getting There:             +5 Not Bad:                     +10 Decentish:                  +15 Pretty Good:               +20 The Hotness:              +25 Simply Amazing:        +30 Pinnacle of Awesome:  +35 Vainglorious:              +40  Or something of the sort."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,sheridch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:09:52 2015 UTC,"I think your ranked rating should degrade over time if you don't continue to play.  The meta changes with every patch.  Just because you were awesome a month ago, doesn't mean you will be equally good today, especially if you haven't been playing.  This would mean that you can't just hit a high rating and stop playing to show off your rank."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,GilinDoesReddit,4,Mon Jul 20 14:18:06 2015 UTC,ranked q should have more chance of getting epic/legendary cards :)
vainglorygame,3dvynt,solid77,4,Mon Jul 20 07:13:16 2015 UTC,"They should add rewards based on what tier you are at the end of a ""season"""
vainglorygame,3dvynt,Malgus234,4,Mon Jul 20 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"But that'll mean the best players will always get the best prizes. Getting into tiers higher than Simply Amazing is extremely hard unless you're a pro. And then that means once you hit a high tier, you can just sit on it until the end of a ""season"".

Maybe if you play enough, they will even cover your college tuition, because SEMC doesn't need to make any money, right?  Unfortunately by doing this, you'd be making it even harder for super evil to make money. The cards and skins are the only way vainglory is making any money. I for one would like to see this game and the studio be around for a long time.  Edited to remove sarcasm since the vainglory subreddit community isn't a fan of it."

vainglorygame,3dvynt,ChapterLiam,3,Mon Jul 20 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably even more important to consider why people aren't going into the ranked queue and address that.   Dangling carrots on the ranked queue isn't going to make it more fun for those people, it's just going to annoy them."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,jacksonfrostson,2,Mon Jul 20 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think we just need a larger player base. I was worried that adding the casual queue would split the player base, but hopeful that SEMC had confidence in their CCU count that it wouldn't be an issue. It sounds like they have misjudged.  I think adding an incentive for ranked queue will likely defeat the whole purpose of casual queue and put them in a worse place than where they started. Perhaps the solution is to spend some advertising dollars on getting their name out there. So far the game has spread almost exclusively by word of mouth and while its growth has been impressive, it could still be better.  A temporary measure would be to limit when ranked queue is available. I'm sure they have the numbers of when most people are playing, they could target those days as ladder climbing days and by making it more scarce, it should encourage more people to play ranked at that time. Treat it like an event and maybe then there could even be special awards for things like having the highest climb on the ladder for that ranked window, and various tier prizes for being at specific ranks.  Essentially solve the ranked scarcity with simple supply and demand economics."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,KarmaAdjuster,3,Mon Jul 20 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"I think adding an incentive for ranked queue will likely defeat the whole purpose of casual queue and put them in a worse place than where they started.   I agree.   Right now, the only reason to play ranked is for skill prestige. The try-hards play there, everyone else plays in casual. Cool.   If you incentivize ranked, then everyone will play ranked, and casual will be relegated to the sub-level 10 noobies. Then you might as well rename them to ""noobie queue"" and ""normal queue"". Which is fine, if that's what SEMC wants. But it won't stop people from complaining - and everyone who liked the idea of ranked queue will complain that there's no longer any safe place to try hard."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,halcyon400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:37 2015 UTC,I think the glory award needs to be higher in ranked queues. This will make more people play ranked I think.
vainglorygame,3dvynt,Pokepig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:29:32 2015 UTC,I posted this to another thread..and I'm too lazy to rephrase...  Sounds like you need to entice people back into the ranked queue.  Ideas:   double glory in ranked (or maybe even ice awards?) or half glory in casual wins in casual don't count towards the daily bonuses or the sinister seven send people to the back of the queue if they haven't played a ranked game in a while.   I suspect there is a positive feedback loop you need to break.
vainglorygame,3dvynt,louche_goose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:25:20 2015 UTC,"These solutions seem aggressive. Overall, I think the biggest issue is that these solutions would indicate that people are wrong if they're playing casual. IMO, it would send the message that ranked is the ""real"" way to play VG. My issues with these ideas:  Idea 1) Not a bad solution for glory, but ICE really should remain the ""premium"" currency. Giving away ICE would mean most people wouldn't ever want to put down cash which would make SEMC struggle. They do need to make money to keep the game going. Idea 2) That's not really fair to people who can really only play one or two matches a day. Those are the people who gravitate towards casual. They play to relax and have fun. Forcing them to play ranked to get a ""daily bonus"" that they don't get even though they actually are playing daily doesn't seem right to me. Idea 3) This just seems mean to people who enjoy the game but don't play often. Not everyone is able to be as hardcore of a gamer as they might want to be. Additionally, when I'm on a losing streak and want to step back from ranked for bit, it would suck to be punished when I do go back by having a crazy long wait timer. That would just encourage me to continue to play casual and just never do ranked again."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,Shrklgs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that SEMC has divided their audience before it was ready for it. Pulling people away from casual queue by making ranked more enticing is just going to reproduce this same exact problem on the other side of the fence.  As I see it, there are two solutions to this problem:  1 - get more people to play Vainglory   2 - reduce the number of available ways to play the game  Solution 1 is expensive, and I'm not quite sure that there is enough content to purchase to make it a good business move, but maybe. It basically means that SEMC will have to stop relying on word of mouth and start paying for advertising on various websites, TV spots, billboards, and various other advertising hot spots.  Option 2 is would mean that they would have to scale back on some of their queue types, the best of which to scale back would be ranked. Essentially, on the days where they consistently have the highest CCU (probably the weekend), make ranked only available on those days. The rest of the time, people can only play casual queue or practice modes. Basically increase demand through simple supply and demand economics. Make ranked more valuable by making it more scarce."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"I think some sort of ""end of season"" reward would be good."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,BradChmielewski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:19 2015 UTC,I think having a biweekely season where instead of giving you prizes based on your rank you get prizes based on how many wins you have (since SEMC says they try to pair you up so that you have close to a 50/50 win percentage)    so in two weeks lets say you win: *1-10 games - get 2 common cards *11- 15 games - 4 common cards *16 - 20 games - 4 common and 1 rare *21 - 25 games - 4 common and 3 rare *26+ games - 4 common 3 rare and 1 epic card    That way you still need legendaries from really good luck or ice boxes but it can help you build up extra rare and common cards which you need so many of to get high tier skins.    This way to be regularly collecting epic cards for a season you'd need to play about 50 games every 2 weeks (which seems like a lot to me...)
vainglorygame,3dvynt,slackc3,0,Mon Jul 20 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"The current system is fine just as is. Going for ranked is not somehow ""better"" than going for casual, and thus should not entail greater rewards of glory or cards or anything else. Ranked is only good to the extent that it fits one's scope of bragging rights."

vainglorygame,3dvynt,I_Was__Drunk,5,Mon Jul 20 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"I understand the annoyance of having someone lock your desired position, but if you want people to enjoy playing with you, LOCK IN LAST.   Just soft-lock your desired hero, and if someone else locks in lane, play support or jungle. This issue is about half your fault, which is what the people down voting you are too busy or lazy to say. This is a sentiment reflected widely on all VG communities."
vainglorygame,3dvynt,TSRodes,4,Mon Jul 20 02:47:41 2015 UTC,Yep. Lock in last.  I tend to flip between LANE-JUNGLE-SUPPORT until the other two make a choice.

vainglorygame,3dvynt,I_Was__Drunk,2,Mon Jul 20 02:54:02 2015 UTC,"To which streamer are you referring? You are screwing your entire team out of good synergy when you do this, unless your teammates both work around your lack of flexibility.   ""Your champ [sic]"" doesn't exist. The hero you play should fit the role your team needs. When your teammates dodge, it's because you demonstrated unwillingness to play to the team.   The advice we're giving you is both strategy and etiquette. You don't have to take it, but every skilled player in queue wants you to. I like playing Vox the most, but I usually have to settle for support because selfish (and usually poorly performing) players auto-lock Ringo or Saw. Try to see it from our perspective."

vainglorygame,3dxg8v,jklick,2,Mon Jul 20 12:48:36 2015 UTC,Why not both? You have to unlock the skin with talent or x number of games but then must purchase the skin to use it.

vainglorygame,3e0mov,Nailo65,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:23 2015 UTC,Well the only time I would say a build is just bad is first of all it's in a ranked match and someone's randomly grabbing items. Ranked matches really shouldn't be the place for people to experiment with triple stacking Clockwork (just happened to me in a ranked match). Auto locking is a huge problem and one wouldn't expect it to happen in a ranked match. Yet it does. Repeatedly.

vainglorygame,3e0mov,TSRodes,-3,Tue Jul 21 03:10:20 2015 UTC,To me it is a way to vent. And I'm sure they'll get it figured out.

vainglorygame,3e0mov,TSRodes,2,Tue Jul 21 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"Don't bother advocating for chat. Devs have stated a ""hard no"" on that for obvious fear of exacerbating the existing toxicity levels.

vainglorygame,3e0mov,TSRodes,-4,Tue Jul 21 03:46:11 2015 UTC,No. I've spent at least $80 on the game. Taking abusive behavior from toxic players isn't something I should have to stomach.

As a support I have had my fair share of big ol' question marks dropped on my face by the jungle carry because I was close to them. Sadly it works both ways with newer players.   Just need to groan and move on, make the best of pings. I normally take Catherines A first so I can charge a camp if the carry won't wait. Usually with a friendly ping or two, when they see that bonus gold after a kill, they realize I am there to help, not hinder."
vainglorygame,3dw4q6,Nailo65,-3,Mon Jul 20 02:43:50 2015 UTC,Eh If I'm playing support I just go in and get separate gold it's never worth it dealing with the rage pingers my biggest rage playing support is pinging them not to face check a bush let me do it and they just go in anyway and get blasted down to 0 health by the awaiting predators.
vainglorygame,3dw4q6,TalkingWacos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:04 2015 UTC,I think it's because a pretty decent amount of new players come from other MOBA's like league where the support always sits in lane with the carry.  When I first started I quickly made the relation that Ringo and SAW where adc's and naturally I went into lane to help them out as their support.  I'm really glad I asked so I won't be bothering my team mates any more. :)
vainglorygame,3dw4q6,TalkingWacos,3,Mon Jul 20 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"That's awesome and makes a lot of sense, usually they do not like to be bother until both the jungler and support come up to secure a kill. Also a small tip for cath that you may not of noticed is her armor increases +1 with every stun!"
vainglorygame,3dw4q6,ThreeBlindMice_7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I'll try out the new build and play style suggestions.   When I am in the jungle as a support do I just help out my jungler take camps or do I take camps for myself?
vainglorygame,3dw4q6,Nailo65,2,Mon Jul 20 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"You do not take camps unless clearly indicated by your jungle partner or if you dearly need mana. Be familiar with how the passive of IGC works. You must take damage from the jungle monsters if you want to receive the health bonus and if you want your jungler to get their bonus gold. As such, you should be taking aggro first."
vainglorygame,3dw4q6,Nailo65,2,Mon Jul 20 01:22:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I always first hit and auto attack until about 50%, then do the support dance. You never know when your jungle will drop an ability  and you accidentally swipe a kill. And in situations where your jungle is absent, I usually wait for their return. We both get more gold that way."

vainglorygame,3dw4q6,NotRoosterTeeth,3,Mon Jul 20 01:29:18 2015 UTC,Always good to see people trying to improve their Support play!   Also unmentioned; it is usually the Supports job to provide vision on the map via mines. A few well placed mines can make a huge difference on jungle control and lane ganks.
vainglorygame,3dw4q6,PsychoProject,2,Mon Jul 20 01:32:31 2015 UTC,"I've been playing since Android release and hit the Hotness today maiming Catherine exclusively. As support I almost always rush fountain, followed by crucible or Atlas depending on the other team. Dont build tier 2 boots until you have fountain+atlas/cruc. Buy wards, and flare guns. Vision is crucial to winning and setting up favorable fights. If a team is CP/stun heavy build two crucibles, they Will save your team. Dont blow your stun early, save it for adagio ult, saw wind up, joule ultimate, etc... You are the tank. Also, time your ultimate carefully.  A well timed Catherine ult wins fights then and there."

vainglorygame,3dydw5,DankBake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:10:10 2015 UTC,If you make a mistake would you rather be able to learn from your teammate telling you what you did or be spammed with ? Pings? Also sometimes people don't understand for example my team went in to a team battle while my respawn timer was on I then spawned and headed toward the battle but my team had already died by the time I passed our first turret I then got spammed with ? Pings because they thought I was lane the whole time instead of going to jungle where team fight was. Wouldn't it have been better if I could have explained that I hadn't even spawned instead of being distracted by ? Pings.

vainglorygame,3dwbkt,hiphoptomato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:17 2015 UTC,"I love Petal after the update but she's really hard. You have to be really good at last hitting with an attack speed lower than Vox and Ringo's, and you're really dependent upon energy. From the posts you see on here, she's also kind of buggy, although I've never experienced bugs. Of course, if you are good with her, you can rack up a lot of CS and she does pretty well without too much crystal items, so you can build really tanky while still doing a lot of damage. It's pretty fun having an opponent like skaarf or celeste try to outmatch you with damage when you're really tanky and can also keep on healing your minions.   Glaive is probably a bit easier than Petal, and he's the first hero I bought, but his playstyle got really boring for me really fast."
vainglorygame,3dwbkt,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:28 2015 UTC,That's what I was afraid of him getting boring and I just got petal and it's a learning curve any build tips? What should I rush?
vainglorygame,3dwbkt,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"I usually get a battery as my first item. Then, I try and stay in lane as long as i can (battery + seeds is really good sustain). If the opponents don't gank and I don't need to help my teammates, I usually don't push hard and just farm near the turret, and I can stay in lane until I get almost 4000 gold (at around the 7 minute mark). At that point, I'm way too underpowered and I then buy a shatterglass and boots or clockwork, and go back to lane. With the shatterglass, it's a lot easier to engage, and I start pushing in lane a bit. Just signal your junglers to gank. You don't have to kill the enemy laner (bonus points if you do) but just make them recall and you can usually take that time to take down the first turret. After that, just kind of go with the flow. Help your junglers out in jungle, take the mines, gank the laner, etc.  This really all hinges upon your last hitting ability, or else you're not going to get anywhere near 4000 gold during the early game. What I usually do if I buy a new person is just play them in ranked and usually drop a few ranks until the opponents are about my level. Then, I climb back up the ranks again as I get better.  ... Of course, this is probably why I've never gotten past hotness bronze. Whenever I get there, I buy a new person and drop back down to pg bronze again lol."
vainglorygame,3dwbkt,zquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:58:46 2015 UTC,"I like going clockwork and aftershock then leaving the rest 4 slots for defensive items, allows you to spam out seeds so you always have a supply of new pets and gives you a spammable aftershock proc which is deadly with her long range."

Aftershock if I need the energy, Frost if we need a slow and they're mobile and hurting us with kiting.   Unfortunately I have never tried him as a carry so I'll let someone else take that.

I go sorrowblade and tornado trigger as well as boots. Then maybe one defensive, usually aegis or crucible so I can ensure to get the ult off. Breaking Point is a good one and tyrants monocle as well. Or a serpents mask.  You just really need to keep people aflame and keep yourself buffed with your B and you HAVE to kite and auto attack as much as possible. Do these things and he will wreck.  Especially early game you can harass almost anyone out of Kane and keep pushed up to their turret which will keep them from earning any farm. And make sure to put a mine in the bush right there to keep from being ganked. Your ult will be pretty weak, and it's usually better to just keep auto attacking for damage than hoping for a big kaboom, but it's still a very useful stun. Hope this works for you!"

My last item is usually a second Crucible, but I'll get an Atlas Pauldron instead if I can get close to the other team's carry. If we're snowballing and don't need more defense I'll end on a Warhorn. The Clockwork is especially important because Adagio has energy issues outside of the lane and you want to be able to spam your heal and damage boost. You could build an Eve or Shatterglass instead of Frostburn depending on whether you want damage, sustain, or slows. I don't recommend building Aegis or Metal Jacket because those won't help your team unless you're the carry. A few other items to avoid are Serpent's Mask, Tension Bow, Alternating Current, and Broken Myth. I see those a lot in public matches, but they really don't synergize well with Adagio's kit."
vainglorygame,3dv52v,SunOsprey,2,Mon Jul 20 00:37:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help! Seems like a logical build. I always use clockwork to help keep the abilities up and running. I'll try out your other tactics too!

Rank queue is broken, it teams people all across the board without much consideration. I was fortress, so same thing... Can't carry with that if the rest of your team just does their thing and ignores pings, over extends constantly and what not. My only guess is there is no one else playing ranked as soloq, or not nearly enough, so you get slaughtered."

vainglorygame,3dvd7a,NotRoosterTeeth,3,Sun Jul 19 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"I think A is just too broken. The passive is alright and the ult isn't that bad since you aren't doing damage and may easily be taken out after appearing.  As for as B goes, it doesn't seem too OP if the damage isn't big. But then again, if the damage isn't big, then it's kind of a pointless ability. Maybe larger damage but scaled down heal? Or maybe smaller damage and larger heal? (that would be interesting)  The A is probably the most broken aspect. By large range, I guess you mean something like Vox's zoom, which is humongous. What's ridiculous about it then is that it is essentially a stronger shiversteel (shiv only slows by 40%, and that's already huge) that can be used to chase far away enemies and has a lower (and scalable with a clockwork) cooldown. Even worse is that it's applicable to the kraken. To put this into perspective, you can build two clockworks to get a 6 sec cooldown on this ability. A third would make it 4 sec, but let's just say build a contraption instead and get 5 sec. Throw in some boots for chasing and a bp and you'd never run out of stacks (esp since the hero's also ranged). Throw on a mask as the last item along with the B and the hero would never die.   Assuming such a hero is released, you'd probably carry with him instead. You could rush bp and contraption (neither of which are really expensive items) and lay a bunch of mines in lane. You then invade their jungle, get maybe five stacks from bp and hopefully kill their first jungler. Assuming the other comes to help (since your first target can't get away due to your slow) you then use your B to sustain for a while longer and (with the help of your other jungler) finish off both of them. Then, you immediately teleport to lane. Assuming you got to 10 or 11 stacks while fighting the junglers, this leaves you with 7 when you get to lane. Immediately attack the laner (if he tries to get away, just slow him too) and you can probably get an ace.  Another problem is that it'd be kind of hard to aim that ult anywhere using our small minimap. Unless when you click the ult, a large map pops up on your screen. That'd be cool."
vainglorygame,3dvd7a,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:26:19 2015 UTC,The buffs from traps would not stack but I agree the slow would be rediculously overpowered. When I first thought of the passive and the ult I thought it would have to be only them with no other abilities (which obviously wouldn't work). Any suggestions on replacements for the slow?
vainglorygame,3dvd7a,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:32:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what to replace it with since it's a pretty unique part of the kit. Maybe remotely laying a mine? That's really strong just because it's basically a stronger version of a flare. I suppose you could make it so that it doesn't detonate until the enemy steps off and then back onto the mine, which I'm pretty sure are already part of the mine's behavior.  If you just want to fix it, I think a longer cooldown is probably the main thing. If you make the cooldown over 20 or even 30 seconds, you'd essentially have to save it for when the chase is actually integral to an ace or something, so you can't use it just to engage in every fight. That also keeps the hero from being able to act as an actual jungler and instead only as a support."
vainglorygame,3dvd7a,ChapterLiam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:43:51 2015 UTC,Changed cooldown to 35 seconds. Also adding the remote mine as an option

vainglorygame,3dtq25,zeroalexzero,7,Sun Jul 19 10:56:04 2015 UTC,"Krul is a much harder hero to play and learn, but if you learn him, you can have a lot of fun with him.  It's not often that Krul is free, but when he is, I'd recommend you read up on different guides for the different play styles he has, then trying them out to get a feel for him.   Both taka and Krul are definitely worth the investment and have the potential to help you carry your way to upper ranks, but only if you know what you're doing.   Gl on your choice, and remember it's double glory weekend, if you have the time you can get the 6k glory either this weekend or next, so don't stress too much about what you decide."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,Glory_DrEvil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:44:01 2015 UTC,I would add although to reach Keuls full potential is harder  he's a lot more forgiving in the stretch to his full potential. I think that Taka is more of a delicate touch. Learning Kroul first  would kind of aid in the transition to Takas play.
vainglorygame,3dtq25,Malodourous,3,Sun Jul 19 20:26:10 2015 UTC,Autocorrect is a Krul mistress.
vainglorygame,3dtq25,LordScolipede,6,Mon Jul 20 12:39:05 2015 UTC,Play free rotation and then decide. Both need loads of practice for different reasons and have a very different play style
vainglorygame,3dtq25,theSDRexperiment,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you go to the summary page for both heroes, you'll see they're classified as a hard difficulty. That's not to say it's a bad idea to buy either one, just that you should set appropriate expectations that it will be hard work and you're not going to be rockstar out of the gate. However, as for any difficult hero, the end result is rewarding and someone who has mastered Krul or Taka is a scary thing to face."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,jklick,6,Sun Jul 19 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"You've made 6k already?  Damn, I only managed to make like 2k.  Best of luck with your purchase."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,willwharper,4,Sun Jul 19 12:17:53 2015 UTC,"Well I would definitly take Taka! Great fun and viable (lets say decent rather :D ) on both WP and CP. Buuut if the enemy team knows what to do against you and buys flares you are usually screwed, same goes for Krul with Atlas though."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,UnforgivenVainGlory,4,Sun Jul 19 11:26:43 2015 UTC,"Take a look Here http://brokenmyth.net/tier-list-mid-july/ They do a great write up of the current Champs' playability with each patch. Plus Adyendrus is absolutely bonkers with Krul.   Spoke with a Dev about Krul and they said he was supposed to be a 1v1 champ, but Adyendrus manages to somehow string those together to 1v3 the enemy team on many, Many occasions.   Both are high skill champs, you should try each one and see which fits your playstyle, or which one you are willing to learn."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,Adskii,5,Sun Jul 19 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"This is strictly opinion-based, but I usually prefer to save my Glory. If you don't need Taka or Krul then keep saving your glory until you fall in love with a hero, even one that hasn't been released yet.   Otherwise, buy Krul and rule the world Fold."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,adyendrus,3,Sun Jul 19 20:02:08 2015 UTC,I prefer Krul mainly because of his sustain kit. But Krul will be absolutely demolished by stuns and silences.   Take is more mobile and deals a lot of burst damage. But he is also a lot more squisher than Krul. His mortal wound is very effective against fountains but like Krul he's also shut down by Stuns yet to a lesser degree.  It's up to you to decide if you want a faced paced mobile hero or a tanky sustain one
vainglorygame,3dtq25,dudethisis,3,Sun Jul 19 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"I recommend that you buy Taka because he's stronger than Krul in my opinion. They're two very different heroes, but they're both mostly played in the jungle, and if I were to chose one to have in my team, I would chose Taka.  While Krul offers great sustain and high 1v1 fighting potential, he's very item dependant and is not very effective if you limit him from farming by invading him, taking objectives, pressuring the lane etc.   Taka is stronger overall and does not have to scale as much. He's also very entertaining to play with his high mobility!"
vainglorygame,3dtq25,Pokepig,3,Sun Jul 19 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"Both have a crappy early game and great late game once you get your build going, but taka has the ability to burst down the entire enemy team in a few seconds of built right. However, I prefer krul cuz he can 1v5 teams ( 2 turrets ) but it's really a tough choice. I definitely recommend picking up both."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,NickThePang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"They are very different heroes, krul has no real escape mechanism, but can be pretty tanks with his A &B skill.  Taka on the other hand has one of the best escape mechanisms in the game.  They can both be very strong junglers..."
vainglorygame,3dtq25,_Joe39_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:17:27 2015 UTC,"I personally have more success with Taka, but it's really up to you to decide.  Play some games of both when they're f2p and see with which one you have more success."
vainglorygame,3duzuu,Raindawgify,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"Now everything I say could be wrong, but I've heard that the devs are almost constantly tweaking the matchmaker and servers, so it's possible that you've been adversely affected a few times.  Another source of error could be your method of testing. Your wifi's upload/download speeds on whatever site you use to test that are not as relevant as your wifi's ability to connect to VG servers. Different domains/servers get different treatment from your ISP. Some get better treatment, like YouTube or Google, but others, like blogspot address and potentially VG servers-- will be put on low priority for bandwidth usage. From personal experience, someone else on your network might be hogging it up with an Xbox Live update or some other garbage that could wait :)  Almost everywhere I look the best solution is always to play a full solo practice. Just farm by yourself and slowly push until you finish, and keep an eye on how you connect."

vainglorygame,3dunsc,fr0IVIan,4,Sun Jul 19 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with fr0IVIan:  1) Krul is huge now, until he gets knocked down a peg or four, you can't skip the undead giant. 2) Koshka is definetly not lame. The pros who are Vainglorious have always included her and definetly haven't replaced her yet. If the other team burns a reflex block on Koshka, that opens up opportunities for her teammates. If you're consistently being kited as Koshka or kiting enemy koshka's-- then obviously you have room to improve with your Koshka game."
vainglorygame,3dunsc,VGFierte,3,Sun Jul 19 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think Koshka is probably the strongest jungler right now. She works beautifully with Fortress, arguably the strongest support and complements WP Vox, probably the strongest lane pick at the moment."
vainglorygame,3dunsc,WSBowman,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:38:05 2015 UTC,"Yes you are right, I made the mistake of forgetting Krul, which I consider top medium tier because anyone using Shiversteel with a ranged carry will get away from Krul not to mention reflex block and considering his ult and and A ability are his only gap closer and both can be countered somewhat easily, I would rank him above Celeste.  I still consider Koshka low tier due to the fact that although yes you will be able to burn many things like a Fountain or Reflex, it could result in koshka being caught out and then just being killed which could lead to your team losing objectives like Kraken or Goldmine or losing her ult which could start a big teamfight where the Koshka team might not win   That's just my opinion on that and sorry for misplay without adding Krul my bad."

vainglorygame,3ds5kj,wolf_hands,2,Sun Jul 19 02:06:50 2015 UTC,there is no game sound settings. there is a setting for game music and a setting for the sounds that the UI makes.

vainglorygame,3dsht0,tehkyy,3,Sun Jul 19 15:22:51 2015 UTC,"I can totally see this. Most players today are used to less barriers being put up in terms of communication.

vainglorygame,3ds0cz,KarmaAdjuster,2,Sun Jul 19 07:12:16 2015 UTC,The total score is the build score of your team in total. And normally there should be a mark in the please read box.

Cool game notes though!  edit: I found your build score break down. I'm guessing the note tells people to scroll to the right :)"

If you scroll allllll the way to the right at the top of the first tab, he breaks down his build score for you.    eg: build with 3 tier 3 items, 2 tier 2 items and 1 tier 1 item will grant a score of 3*100+2*25+1*10=360"

vainglorygame,3dqkli,BlueDmon,2,Sat Jul 18 14:56:52 2015 UTC,WAT!?!? That sucks. Thanks for the info. But how did I shot myself in the foot? I racked up a lot of glory trying to win every day. Not to mention the experience.

vainglorygame,3ds6yv,dudethisis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:51:53 2015 UTC,Is there any sort of strategies that you can suggest? I know I have to harass the enemy laner but that's no simple job with such a squishy hero
vainglorygame,3ds6yv,dudethisis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:26:19 2015 UTC,"For the first few minutes watch your enemy laner and try to predict his movements. Once you get enough CP, you can spam your fireballs for quite a bit of damage and pull the creeps towards your side. And once you max your A, you can spam the fireballs every 3 seconds. Excellent way to poke the enemy.   Also during team fights you're going to be quite squishy so stay at the very edge of the fight and throw fireballs and goop at the enemy and if they start to fall back sprint up to them and use your ult. slows them down and speeds up your allies while doing so damage to the enemy."
vainglorygame,3ds6yv,dudethisis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"So what is the right progression for overdriving the skills? Which one should I overdrive first? Goop or Fireball?

vainglorygame,3ds6yv,shit-on-you,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:20 2015 UTC,"Max fireball first. As for the last hitting of minions, can't help you there. I have about constant 500 ping every game (sometimes worse) and it takes about 3 seconds for me to do the animation to attack and by the time I'm done with the animation, the minion is dead. That's why I rely on the fireball. Once you overdrive it you will kill all the 42 gold creeps with one fireball and the goop should take care of the 88 minion"
vainglorygame,3ds6yv,julianhxlim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:09 2015 UTC,"I used to overdrive goop first though, should I balance it or just put more on the fireball?"
vainglorygame,3ds6yv,plybianz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:27:01 2015 UTC,"I'd over drive fireball as you can spam it to farm, poke enemies and use as flares in bushes. In lane I'd aim fireball always at the opposing laner rather than  minions to annoy/ drive them back. his fireball is pretty lethal at the start and you will force enemy laner to pot/shop. Also makes last hitting a bit easier. I'd avoid using goop for farming, save it for team fights or escaping from ganks. In team fights always stay at the back, do not initiate a fight with your ult or get into the middle of a fight (you will be dead in 2seconds). Hang back and fireball the other team, wait for them to use their crucible then ult. Always aim for the carry. He's hard but fun to play in lane. His goop is perfect to secure kills if you have a taka/glaive/koshka to initiate gank in lane"

vainglorygame,3drg1g,An0therk,3,Sat Jul 18 19:08:48 2015 UTC,I think what it might be is a lack of players joining ranked queue
vainglorygame,3drg1g,Whodouknohere,2,Sat Jul 18 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I fully buy into that as the sole reason their are mismatched match ups. As soon as 1.6 came out, I attempted to solo ranked as a Hotness Silver and was immediately matched with a team of 2 PoA and one SA all in a party together with barely any wait time for queue. That seems ridiculous considering I'm not allowed to party with a PoA player but I'm allowed to lose ELO to him."
vainglorygame,3drg1g,WSBowman,5,Sun Jul 19 05:13:59 2015 UTC,It's funny because people don't join ranked queue because they think it's broken. It's broken because people won't join. Lol
vainglorygame,3drg1g,-Avatar-Korra-,4,Sat Jul 18 23:56:17 2015 UTC,If SEMC wants ranked queue to be taken seriously they need to make it so NO mismatches happen. NO EXCEPTIONS.  Am I the only one that thinks this?
vainglorygame,3drg1g,Mattpalmq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"That's impossible. How do you guarantee that you won't mismatch a player's when it's their first game? (Just the most extreme example to prove my point.)  What do you even consider a mismatch? If I get drunk and play a game, how is the system supposed to know that it should match me lower than usual?  Getting good matching is very hard. Getting perfect matching is not possible."
vainglorygame,3drg1g,glStelar,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:30 2015 UTC,Mismatch in regards to skill tiers. Like they will never match you with someone more than 1 skill tier above or below you just like they won't let you party up with people in skill tiers above or below you.

If I'm playing Petal and my teammates don't need much help in the jungle, I can get to about 150 by the end of a 18 minute game.

If you look below the star on your Ranked page you should see a bar that has bronze, silver and gold notated underneath it. This bar will move to the left or right depending on your results in Ranked matches. The color of the star ( or another symbol depending on the rank) will also change color to reflect which subdivision (bronze, silver or gold) you fall into within that Rank. The amount of movement that bar travels after a match is dependent upon the difference in Elo between your team and your opponents, so don't expect the exact same bump or slide after each game as you had in the previous one.

vainglorygame,3drh7c,xmanuw,3,Sat Jul 18 19:18:46 2015 UTC,I am one of the admins on team decentish.  Ranked for our members is split about 20/80. 20% of our members seem to not be able to lose. They get amazing team mates. No rage pings or anything. They fly up the ranks all the way to POA.   Then the other 80% has a hard time even staying where they are. Every game is a deserter or rage pinger. I've dropped over a tier and a lot of my games my KD is 2:1 and we push hard to get objectives but you always have an asshat ruin the entire game.
vainglorygame,3drh7c,eh-blank-space,2,Sat Jul 18 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like some more in-depth analysis would help. Do the 20% by and large have positive attitudes themselves? Do they have previous MOBA experience? Are they generally more skilled than the 80%?  If someone has a positive attitude, they are much more likely to affect their teammates to be positive as well, thus increasing team synergy and overall performance. Additionally, they're probably less likely to rant a lot about bad queue experiences. If they're more skilled, teammates are probably going to be more positive towards them.  If people are consistently seeing the same sort of games, there's probably something going on besides just luck. Food for thought :-)"

vainglorygame,3drh7c,MrTouchnGo,5,Sun Jul 19 20:01:25 2015 UTC,"An anecdote is not an argument.   Though, the rebuttal this, the developers have stated that there are issues with players at lower rankings playing in Ranked. The level requirement makes it so there aren't many of them available to play. Hotness and above are fairly exempt from this, and since you're a PoA, you were probably getting matches far below your skill level and stomping through them.  Ranked is legitimately broken and the developers acknowledge this, I'd expect that in the next patch we'll see incentive to play ranked as well as improvements to it."

Like I felt like I was watching a creepy pasta video from 2005.   If you can break away from the slideshow format, I would. I'd also try and make sure that the pictures you show are a bit more focused on your topic. I get that you tried to add a little humor, but it came off more as cheesy.  Also, some of the comparisons you made came off as slightly offensive. Namely using photos from mass killings and bombings of villages in Vietnam and comparing events from the lore to 9/11. I understand you were trying to show the devastation of the events in the story, but because the story is fantasy, it seems more like making light of the real events. I would recommend making comparisons only between fantasy tragedy and more well-known fictional tragedy.  Think you could do some really cool stuff with these videos, but there's some stuff you could definitely do better."

vainglorygame,3dofr7,Hic142,8,Fri Jul 17 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"Ringo - Tension Bow, Sorrowblade, and Tyrant Monocles are the basis for WP Ringo. Ringo a) Upgrade B first, and take it to overdrive. Do not max Ultimate unless you are CP Ringo. Ringo b) A fed Ringo is scary. Make sure to always get last hits and poke your enemy laner constantly. Ringos early game is very good, take advantage of that. You can harass the enemy laner to their death in the first couple minutes.  Koshka - I like to rush Fountain. For damage I will go Shatterglass and Broken Myth, followed by more defense. This is the standard build we have been seeing. Koshka a) Upgrade B first, and take it to overdrive. Do not max your ultimate. Koshka b) Just like Ringo, her early game is very strong. You are able to demolish the enemy early game if you are paired with Fortress. Ganks become easy when you get your ult.  Catherine - Your job is to support, so build defense. Fountains, Crucible, Atlas. Do not get Aegis or Metal Jacket as these are selfish items! A Clockwork is a good choice, as well as an Aftershock for the A burst. Catherine a) Start with A if you plan to invade enemy jungle. Overdrive A, and max your ultimate. Her ultimate is a great crowd control method with the silence, and surprisingly a good chunk of damage. Catherine b) Stun heroes out of their ults like Adagio, Ringo and Joule.   A good hero to buy in the current meta is Vox. A very strong laner at the moment. Keep in mind I am only PG Silver and my thoughts and opinions aren't the same as a higher tiers player might be. Just what I know :)"
vainglorygame,3dofr7,Musa_,4,Fri Jul 17 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with 90% of what is said here, and just want to add a couple things. Aftershock on Koshka is an excellent choice, and I'm loving Contraption on Catherine, especially with the abundance of Takas I've been seeing lately. You can never have too much wision!"
vainglorygame,3dofr7,Zaggaz,2,Sat Jul 18 01:52:46 2015 UTC,"Great recommendations except for the Catherine build. In lower tiers it works to build all defense IMO. Once you get to Hotness and above building all defenseless is useless as the enemy team just largely ignores you and focuses your carries as you are somewhat worthless without any damage output. That's why Fortress is such a devastating support good right now, because he can actually do damage as a support. I like to rush either fountain or Warhorn depending on whether or not we are winning early fights. Warhorn if we are and fountain if not. Then I go Clockwork. To me Caths stun is far and away her greatest asset. If you can constantly have her stun up and get off multiple stuns in one team fight it can be devastating. Then go Aftershock. Aftershock coupled with her stun is lethal. It makes the enemy team actually have to honor your presence  too many times I have experienced or seen the Tanky Cath get ignored until she's the only one left and see her retreat while getting focused 3 v 1 or they ignore her and move on to their next objective. All the while you are doing this you want to be be buying mines for that precious wision, of course"
vainglorygame,3dofr7,VATigerfan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:25:20 2015 UTC,"Ringo - TB only works if you can leverage it and then maybe an infusion to get a few consecutive kills in lane and set the other laner back while you build your SB.    don't max your A if you're building WP because a maxed A costs 104 energy for 380 crystal damage, and a maxed C costs 130 energy for 480 true damage upon impact and another 490 damage over the next 7 seconds.  if you're building CP, max A and C.  try to time it so that every time you successfully last hit and your perk becomes active, you can also pop B to rush in, auto followed very quickly by A, then stutter step enemy laner to death.  if you can walk in and auto THEN pop B, even better.  both A and B reset Ringo's autos, always keep this in mind.  the best Ringo bursts happen when you walk in with a crit, pop B, auto then quick A, then stutter step  if you build WP, keep in mind that your autos will soon do more damage than your A, which makes your A very energy-inefficient as you approach the late game phase.  at this point you should only use it to secure a kill, and not for additional DPS.  Catherine - start with A whether or not you plan to invade early game.  your B will do nearly nothing in a level 1/2 team fight."

vainglorygame,3dofr7,LordScolipede,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"I build the recommended build for ringo. It works unusually well for a recommended build, in my opinion. Max Twirling Silver and Hellfire Brew(second and third abilities)."
vainglorygame,3dofr7,BlueArcheopteryx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"Koshka: Terribly fun to build the holy trinity of CP on her: Shatterglass, Broken Myth, Eve of Harvest. Make sure to start building some defense towards the 10-12 minute mark (or when you start working on your Broken Myth-- whichever comes first). Max her B ability first, and as Musa_ said, don't max your ult.  Koshka is strong early game, and fairly easy to kill or be killed throughout the game. The key is NOT to initiate fights unless you know you can execute the target immediately, and generally hop in and out of the teamfights using your A ability, spinning, clawing someone's face once or twice and then using your passive's movespeed to run away and avoid taking more damage. This should reduce your A ability's cooldown to close to 0 seconds, so feel free to hop back in if you won't die. :)  As to your next hero-- I'd suggest playing Solo Practice games to discover which heroes fit your playstyle, try them out when they're on free rotation, and if you like them, absolutely save up for them!"
vainglorygame,3dofr7,VGFierte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"Vox (Lane): Super duper easy. Super duper powerful.  Start by rushing a Sorrowblade, T1 boots, some defense, and a barbed needle.   From there I recommend Bonesaw, Sorrowblade, Tornado Trigger/Breaking Point (depends on fight length).   Adagio (Support): Intuitive supporting, easy transition to carrying.  Ironguard first, then a T3 defense item, boots, and a ton of vision.   Depending on how the match is going, I'll either tank up (if I'm behind) or build some Crystal (to stay ahead). Breaking Point is a good option for a lead where fights are lasting a long time.   Tip: Pay close attention to details on abilities. If you managed your kit correctly you can easily keep your energy up and keep your enemies moving at a crawl.  Krul (Jungle): Not easy, but super rewarding.  Tank up, rush breaking point to stay ahead.  Buy boots early.   Tip: Only smite to execute, heal, or if they're leaving range. Your stacks debuff them and give you life steal."
vainglorygame,3dq2hb,devcmacd,3,Sat Jul 18 09:51:45 2015 UTC,I don't know what the others are talking about. Yes you basically need to weave T1 three times.  T1 has ABC cards required.  T2 has ABCD cards required.  T3 has ABCDE cards required.   Each skin uses a the cards required so you need to obtain ABC cards three times. That's why SEMC recommended buying the T1 because you'll just have to collect the cards you already own all over again.
vainglorygame,3dq2hb,eh-blank-space,4,Sat Jul 18 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, the cards are consumed. But no, you don't need to weave tier 1 three times."

We had them down to just their vain and they were pushing us hard and had us to our last turret.

The Blazing Salvo is upgraded to either Tornado Trigger or Bonesaw (depending on enemies' armor) whenever I need it. Throw in boots when you're building the Sorrowblade too.  It's a pretty expensive build, so it's not something I'd recommend unless you farm really well (but if you finish the build, it's so fun exploding enemy carries in 3 hits). If you don't, I'd probably go Sorrowblade, Bonesaw, Sorrowblade.  I want to experiment with some other builds, mainly incorporating Breaking Point, so we'll see how that goes!"

I'd start with a Book of Eulogies and rush Tension Bow for that early/mid game domination in lane. I'd build a Sorrowblade next to pack some power. And after that, I finish it off with a Tornado Trigger and a Tyrant's Monocle or Serpent Mask.  I've been trying out CP Ringo, and it's been a ton of fun! I don't purchase a Book of Eulogies in this build, but I still rush Tension Bow. Then, I build an Eve of Harvest to sustain some health in lane. I finish it up with an Aftershock and Alternating Current. His ultimate does a ton of damage with a crystal build, and the splash damage is pretty significant too.  In both cases, I'd get boots obviously. And for me, I always try to have at least one defensive item even as a carry. Hope this helps!"

The game is a team game, and everyone has those responsibilities. The biggest thing I can tell you is that if someone is slacking on their responsibilities, you need to pick up their slack if you want to be successful.   For example, if you're a laner, and your junglers aren't buying mines.. Don't leave it Unmined hoping they'll wake up. And you can't tell them to buy mines.. So what do you do? You but the mines and place them in the shop bush, tri bush, and your lane bush. At a minimum.   If you're laner isn't pinging question mark when his laner disappears, you should send him a question mark before deciding to invade. Etc.  When it comes to soloQ you can't sit there and say ""that isnt my job"" if it's not getting done, you need to do it or risk losing the game."

There's no thought that goes into it.   In the middle of a fight, it can restore every teammate's health by something like 30-40%, which is huge for gaining an early game advantage. Literally whoever finishes a Fountain first will probably win the game because it's so impactful, especially in early game fights.  The recent nerf wasn't enough (IMO) because people still rush it. It still makes the team who gets it first win fights. The change I suggested a while back was that Fountain's Shield be reduced so that you have to decide between massive team utility or personal tankiness (since, you know, you're the tank). Shift the focus even more to the heal that it provides.   Right now, if the enemy is heavily reliant on CP, you can easily stack Fountains for great heals and also great Shield. Yeah, the heal is less, but it's still better than getting an Aegis for yourself or a Crucible.  With all this Fountain talk, I wonder if EU meta has moved away from 10 Crucibles per game. I haven't watched tournaments recently - anyone know?"
vainglorygame,3dmqx6,MrTouchnGo,4,Fri Jul 17 16:57:17 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly agree with your proposal to the fountain change. I've even opted to a second fountain instead of armor because two fountains adds enough armor that two covers all your defense needs. It's still OP IMO.
vainglorygame,3dmqx6,GrandpaSkitzo,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"Even after the fountain nerf, it's still quite a bit OP. Especially when the enemy team has 4+ spread across their team"

I come from LOL, and an item like this would be broken beyond belief. This is not LoL, but it still feels incredible strong, especially in lower ranks where you can consistently bait your enemies with it."
vainglorygame,3dmqx6,GSAGasgano,2,Fri Jul 17 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"They though about this and introduced (or tweaked) the Mortal Wound debuff, which reduces all kind of healing. Fortress is very effective against Fountain-oriented comps. There's also Taka and Rona."

vainglorygame,3dmqx6,GSAGasgano,2,Wed Jul 22 00:49:50 2015 UTC,I think they need a new defensive item that grants a buff and armor. Like Aegis but for facing WP teams. Nothing as annoying as building AP or Metal Jacket and having to go back to get Reflex Block

vainglorygame,3dmqx6,VGFierte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:22:43 2015 UTC,"These coments below are my PERSONAL opinions:  a) Fountain got balanced in current patch. b) Considering the current build meta, I guess the answer is yes. c) Probably. Depends directly on the nerf/new feature. I particularly disagree with the Reflex Block/Crucible/Aegis nerf. d) If by utility you mean Warhorn and Contraption, I suppose it's very situational. I never used Contratpion since it was released. Too expensive just to save your earnings. So I prefer building Atlas, Fountain, Crucible over it. Warhorn is debatable. e) Maybe some new debuffs could be implemented. Like blindness, AP/CP suppressing. That would induce the creation of new defensive items maybe. f) I don't think so. Keep in mind though, that every newcomer coming from another MOBA has great advantage over a raw player."

vainglorygame,3dl0xg,MrTouchnGo,2,Fri Jul 17 06:32:31 2015 UTC,Increased KB? That would actually increase the reaction time people have to surprise gauntlets as they are running and cause them to be stunned less.
vainglorygame,3dl0xg,JekyllMD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:19:30 2015 UTC,"I meant have his next basic attack fling the opponent into the wall to stun them. Granted, that might actually help them escape though."
vainglorygame,3dl0xg,MrTouchnGo,2,Fri Jul 17 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"IMO, that would be pretty overpowered. Being able to reposition enemies is huge - look at how successful support Glaive was before Reflex Block was meta. And that was with only a 0.5 second (or whatever) stun on his Afterburn.  Being knocked (or walking) into the Gauntlet is a really, really long stun (about 2 seconds). Ardan being able to punch someone into the wall is much less predictable and thus much less blockable than Glaive's Afterburn, and would be followed by a huge stun.  I think Gauntlet is fine the way it is right now. It reshapes the landscape of fights or forces the enemy to burn a block, and often both. I think it's other areas of Ardan's kit that would need a tiny boosting :-)"
vainglorygame,3dl0xg,JekyllMD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:41:40 2015 UTC,"What would be a good way to buff him? I don't use him, but I thought his main issue was a lack of a good stun."
vainglorygame,3dl0xg,MrTouchnGo,3,Fri Jul 17 07:44:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think he's actually very weak in general. He was a great pick until recently, and his kit hasn't changed since then. Vanguard is by far still the best way to protect a teammate, but the meta has shifted away from a kit based around keeping teammates alive to a kit based around killing people very fast (hence Cath having gained favor with her amazing disrupting abilities, and Fortress for straight up damage enablement). The reasons for this are debatable, but I suspect it might be because of the nerf on health items and Fountain thus indirectly becoming more valuable. Mortal wounds reducing barriers may also have something to do with it (though probably less of an impact).  The fact is that Vanguard's AoE slow and target speedup are really, really powerful in the right situation, and its health barrier is invaluable for saving someone. I think a move to make health items more valuable again (also, another Fountain nerf, because let's face it, if every support and some carries are rushing it, the damn thing is still too strong) would make Ardan a happier camper."
vainglorygame,3dl0xg,osi42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:46:33 2015 UTC,"Regarding Fountain, when faced with the choice of Aegis or Fountain, unless the opposing team is really CP heavy, I'll usually favor Fountain because the active helps my team, not just me. This is regardless of what role I'm playing.   (just putting forth my motivations in the event that it helps balancing decisions)"
vainglorygame,3dl0xg,Ares-2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think that the HP, AS and Reflexblock nerf and mortal wound buff were really bad for Ardan. He has a great kit, just think of the OP Vox, Tankshka, Ardan comp. But Fortress is the better pick, he can also increase his teammates mobility and heal his team with fountains. He needs a Buff, to compensate all those nerfs. I'm not sure, if we need a FoR nerf. I really don't like how defense gets nerfed, we need more items for supports. There are only Crucible, FoR and Atlas, TBH Atlas is often better on the semi carry. Crucible is nerfed to a point, that's its only a situational item, IMO."

Is this the case in the higher ranks or lower ranks or everywhere? I feel like a lot of the game comes down to the last, critical team-fight or two.   I ask because my last two games we were definitely down turrets and money most of the game (I got tired and wasn't playing very well), but we ended up winning both because of the final skirmish that we just happened to outplay the enemy, get a wipe, push down 4 turrets, and the crystal before they resed. We were down to 1/3 of our Crystal.   Why would the game be over/decided by leek 6, if that's only 4 or 5 minutes into the game?"

It was later clarified that the Chinese understand the reason they are down is because they were beaten by superior skill, whether in champion select, or in individual roles. They realized that same skill is what they would need to overcome to win the game, but it would require someone better than themselves to make a mistake that they felt they wouldn't make.  It's a fairly deep thought, but ultimately, it's respect that the best players in this game will not make mistakes that let you back into the game once they have an advantage.  I still love epic comebacks in games, and I feel like they still do exist at every rank, but it's far less likely in higher tiers due to the players' ability to maintain a lead."

The idea is to farm up and not even thinking about engaging before level 4. Attack whoever you can get your undead hands on to build bp stacks and use clockwork for the quick cooldown on abilities so you can keep that health barrier as well as smite if need be multiple times in a fight.

vainglorygame,3dl0xg,a_wild_shiggy,2,Sat Jul 18 03:24:43 2015 UTC,"Here's an impromptu guide for jungle carry, Breaking Point Krul.   Starting item should be situational. If you see an early strong team comp from the enemy, start with shield or armor. If you see a weak early game and anticipate a passive match start, but a swift shooter. In all cases, I generally buy a scout trap or two.   Your first purchases should be x2 swift shooters, boots, two points t1 defense items or one t2 defense item.   Build two blazing salvos, then rush a breaking point and a t3 defense item.   From there tank up and buy t2 boots. Buy infusions when you think you're within 10 minutes of the match ending.   Be really responsive with this build; if you're behind, build defense instead of breaking point and wait to build breaking point until you're pulling ahead."

So, if you were unable to place scout traps too, then you could assume that someone on the map has placed enough mines to prevent petal from placing seeds."

vainglorygame,3dnvgd,Goonie_GooGoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"So if I'd try to place a scout trap and it didn't work then that would have told me it was someone trap-spamming me? Interesting. And frustrating.   I've heard of this happening but I didn't realize it was global. I just thought it was ""on screen"" in a location.   And this would have happened in the first ten minutes of the game and they didn't have traps in the normal for places.   So does this mean against a Petal I can just buy mines and fill our base with them to make their Petal useless and thus force a 2v3? I mean it is possible this happened against me as I started just fine and then after I went on a kill streak I started losing my ability to get seeds.   If so then this makes Petal useless. Why wouldn't everyone just immediately start spamming their base w mines and take out an opponent? Why would you even give Petal a chance to get going?  Frustrating."

vainglorygame,3dlhhw,TSRodes,9,Fri Jul 17 06:06:50 2015 UTC,"Minion mines generally give the enemy laner a gold advantage and weakens your own laner's positioning.  Ofc, there are positives such as the enemy laner being much less likely to rotate down to jungle, it being easier to push lane to take turrets, but it is generally meta in higher tiers to leave minion mines be until at least 8 minutes, and usually until at least two turrets are gone.  HOWEVER, just because it's meta doesn't mean people know about it. Lots of people do ""stupid"" things like auto-locking and taking minion mines and building Warhorn on Taka because they don't know any better. Hey, I did all kinds of stupid things when I first started this game, but I eventually learned and most people do too.  You did a great analysis, but not every player learns as quickly as you do! It helps to friend these people afterwards and (attempt to) tell them why certain things should or shouldn't be done. Education!"

To me, the hidden cost is choosing to forego the kraken (and therefore ~$600 in turrets, along with enemy kills when you see them use all their specials on the kraken)."
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,osi42,2,Fri Jul 17 15:43:57 2015 UTC,a pet peeve of mine is allies rushing to take the mines once kraken is taken.  People need to realise minions don't spawn once kraken is taken. priority one should be either jungle shop to update builds or follow kraken and melt turrets.
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,An0therk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:27:33 2015 UTC,"If the enemy has both mines, I always ensure we get at least one after capturing a Kraken so that the minions that are already in play get more balanced. I've lost a turret when following the Kraken due to this before."

vainglorygame,3dlhhw,kaivorb,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:34 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect description of a common scenario for me. If you don't back up kraken and distract the enemy team, they kill him immediately, take back the mine your teammates were focusing, then outspend you on build."
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,fmaBlots,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"agreed 100%. as with everything, it's situational. i'd only go for a mine if the enemy wasn't 3-strong. and i'd usually prefer the mine on their side since it's ""on the way"" for the kraken, especially if their first turret is already down."
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,fmaBlots,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:01:07 2015 UTC,Once we get Kraken I'll take a mine if we have minions en route to tower that will get there soon. Since mines now immediately buff all minions it can help burn down a tower. Opponents will focus on Kraken while you distract and try to keep them occupied. But the minions running free can do some real damage if pumped. Even better if you grab a candy at the shop then push. Those little beasts can become terrors while other team ignores them. It's worth looking into.
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,fmaBlots,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like the minion buff is less valuable than simply using that time to accompany the kraken and damage turrets/enemies as a team.   I have had a lot of luck with enemies out of position when they scramble to melt the kraken. When my team rides the kraken instead of taking the mine (rare), it SEEMS like we get one more turret down and we are much more likely to pick off at least one enemy for a marked advantage. Again, I'm not ultra-confident in this assessment."
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,fmaBlots,0,Fri Jul 17 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"When you get ahead in the lane and you're starting to roam (so the midgame) you want to have constant pressure on your lane so you dont lose CS while you're constantly roaming.  You get the minion mine to always have your lane pushed.  Get minion mine, force fights in the jungle, if the laner comes down for 3v3 you get tower and the laner loses cs. If they dont come down then you get a 3v2."
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,qdcr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:50:32 2015 UTC,"I am specifically referring to when we have at least one enemy down. They usually don't fight us at the mine and take it back shortly thereafter. Then, their dead teammates respawn before we can take a kraken.   Even in PG tier, my opponents won't 2v3 or 1v2 to protect a mine they can more easily take back in eight seconds.   I would personally rather take the kraken than the mine when we have an easy, clear shot at either with enemies (or an enemy) down."
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,DiamondtearLeo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:16 2015 UTC,"If you take their mine and they try to get it after, you know exactly where they are and can use their positioning for another objective like a tower.  Getting Kraken when they have 2 people up isn't 'clearshot'.  If you can get towers by yourself with an Ace don't get Kraken."
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,Deminish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"The positioning knowledge is helpful, but they'll just rotate up to the turrets and mitigate the situation until their third is back, right?  A ""clear shot,"" to me, means a very good chance, not guaranteed success. 2v3 situations match that description just fine. Your attempt at arguing semantics does not interest me.   I'm genuinely curious about your third sentence. I don't have the experience to work out the logistics of that. Can you explain why you'd go straight to turret instead of kraken on an Ace?"
vainglorygame,3dlhhw,louche_goose,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on how late in the game you get the Ace.   Kraken is only gold efficient if you get more than one tower with it because you're giving them 500 gold. If you can get 600 gold without giving them 500 gold, that'd be more efficient and a better trade. They then have to deal with the minion waves, and you can use Kraken as a bait for a team fight because they're forced to contest it.  Now a super late game Kraken (everybody is full build e.t.c) is super good because their death timers are really high making it extremely difficult to deal with it."

So either with a scout trap or just hugging it every few seconds to check  If the laner from the other team is missing, question mark ping in front of their turret to alert your support/jungler that they're missing and possible shenanigans might be going on.  If your minions are pushing and you don't want to overextend, it's always a good idea to check/hangout near the miner in case a battle breaks out and your teammates need some damage dealt.  For Celeste, try to really get a feel of how fast her normal attack travels and try to time your attacks/stars appropriately to get last hits on minions. Also, don't steal jungle farm, that's just poor taste."
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,robomoses,2,Thu Jul 16 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"I would say it's ok to take the one health minion closest to the gold miner if you are low on health and you feel it necessary to hang around in case of a fight. Just don't make it a habit. If you're able to, just port back to base and leave the jungle farm for the junglers."
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,GrandpaSkitzo,3,Thu Jul 16 23:45:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's of 110% importance for everyone to always be healthy and ready to fight. If you're healthy and you know the enemy isn't (you just poked the enemy laner to 50% or you saw the enemy Rona at 60% from farming, etc.), that's prime invading and pushing time. If you're healthy and the enemy is too, they're much less likely to push or invade, and even if they do, you have a better chance of fighting it off."
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,MrTouchnGo,5,Thu Jul 16 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"If you are farming near 10 minions a minute, you are rocking it. I always just try to keep my CS higher than the opposing laner through bullying, baiting, etc. to keep their farm/gold lower than me. I also prefer laning with Celeste these days. Especially early game, her last hitting is a little tricky, but totally learnable.   Just never overextend unless it's intentional bait for a coordinated gank. Try and communicate with your team before you ever go out of position, even for going back or shopping. It's your job to keep the turrets up and be the most fed character so ensure you tag-team for your rotations and keep ready to fight and carry your team."
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,Kraken_SEMC,5,Fri Jul 17 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't call my self an advanced laner but what i noticed:  good laners rarely miss last hits on minions and know how to poke and pressure the other laner so that they miss their last hits.  also map awareness is key for helping your junglers on invades. most laners in lower tiers almost never rotate down to help their teammates (when they need it). if i remember correctly, you don't really start consistently seeing this until around mid/upper hotness.  also, noticing jungle rotation timing, so you know if a gank is likely to  be coming. for example, if your junglers took the enemy jungle, there's a good chance they are hiding in lane because there's nothing better to do.  putting mines in the enemy brush for vision also helps to not get ganked. also, don't over extend while your escape tools are on CD, unless you have good vision/awareness of where everyone is, or you have backup hiding in the lane."
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,solid77,4,Thu Jul 16 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"Never overextend, if you find yourself moving too far forward then only last hit for a while, port back to the base to shop or go hang with your junglers for a bit to see if they want to invade the opposing jungle. Possibly not for celeste, but for less squishy laners I'd suggest standing on top of your minion with the least health. The opposing laner will target you and be denied the gold from the minion kill and take some damage from any remaining minions."

vainglorygame,3dk4wa,hiphoptomato,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:59:56 2015 UTC,Sometimes I find myself reaching over the midline a little in order to fire a heliogenesis and finish off a minion over by their turrett. Is this not a good idea? Should I just not worry about losing that farm and stay cautious in that situation? sometimes an enemy ringo or someone will stall the game near their turret for a little bit so I feel like I need to be a little aggressive in order to stay competitive in terms of cs numbers.
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,Axc3ss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"With Celeste you can helio into the enemy lane bush for vision. This way you can over extend a little bit for a few seconds and be safe from the enemy trying to gank you.   The trick to making sure you rarely overextend is to ONLY last hit the minions. Try to not continuously attack them to lower their health, just last hit when the health is low enough. This will make the enemy laner overextend and you'll always be safe."
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,DiamondtearLeo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:36:37 2015 UTC,Specially if you're laning with Joule
vainglorygame,3dk4wa,An0therk,4,Fri Jul 17 10:49:31 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Celeste main, i'll throw what I have learned at-cha.   Almost all of this applies to Early - Mid game when you will be on your own for most.  Hopefully it helps  always have at least 3 scout traps and health pots ( or one mine placed at the top of the bush by your turret and one at the edge of the enemy bush opposite. This helps immensely for ganks and harassing.) health pots are an obvious enough one, not so much for health but for the energy boost it gives and there's nothing worse than being one supernova away from killing your enemy laner and not having enough energy - *always plan ahead.   Harassment for Celeste in my opinion is her main strength early - mid game, especially against a Ringo and Saw. it's not so easy against a good Vox, who has been my bane lately, but you can still pull ahead of the opposite laner in Cs by not using your helio for clearing minions but placing it where the laner would be standing forcing them back until you supernova or it fazes out. For this though, you do need to master last hitting with her auto attack which is not easy. you can stutter step which helps but try to remember that once the creep's health glows red you can last hit it. Also when you are pushed back to your turret let the turret hit the small creeps first then last hit. I think it's one auto attack, one turret hit then last hit for the bigger creeps.  *a well timed core collapse goes a long way. I find that if i land 3/3 early game the enemy laner will rarely come too close to you helping to win that all important Cs battle!  Taka is your worst enemy! and it is crucial to keep vision on both of the bushes by the turrets when you are up against one. he can melt your health in a fowl swoop leaving the laner to take you out in a couple shots. when you know he's within range and an x-retzu is inevitable, wait for him to attack then land a core collapse on the opposite side of you and where he lands (hope that's explained well enough). He will always jump into his kaiten and if you time core collapse properly it will stun him when he lands and give you time to activate boots and flee to the safety of your turret. I will only ever activate boots in this situation when I'm up against a Taka  One more bit of advice, for any laner -kind of following up on what kraken said, Always let your team-mates know what you're doing.  Put an OMW ping at home base when recalling or at the jungle camp, so your junglers can cover for you- this sometimes leads to a successful gank. Also, try not to recall until you have at-least 1500 gold, I find the enemy laner will go back earlier (especially if you have been harassing well) giving you a huge advantage after you go back.  Edit - Don't be afraid to go down to the jungle and help out. When the enemy lamer is nowhere to be seen there is a good chance their team are planning something nasty."

vainglorygame,3dk4wa,Ares-2,2,Fri Jul 17 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"I try to get over 80 cs in 10min and more cs than the other laner. This means if I've to roam a lot and play a very aggressive lane, I'll end up with 80 cs. In a passive match, its possible to get over 100cs in 10min. Practice in Practicemode, you can get 100cs in 8min ;) my priorities are: my cs, denying farm, helping my team in the jungle to get more cs: stay alive, get last hits, attack the other laner to deny farm if he tries to last hit and/or to use minion aggro. Eg pushing the lane aggressive and using the aggro to pull creeps back to last hit safely. good laners will get most/all cs if you let them farm. Try to push them out or get a kill with heroes like Celeste or Ringo. Try to stay in the upper half of the lane, if you push. It's harder to gank you.  map awareness and positioning make the difference between a good aggressive and a bad overextending laner. know and use your powerspikes (ulti, overdrive, items...) especially to help in the jungle. rotate with your team. If your teammates are at the back camps a d you're at the shop, you might die in a gank. If you wait a few seconds and rotate down, when they're going back to the shop, you're safe and able to invade. if your comp has strong ganks, or if you're playing against an aggressive laner, gank and outfarm. help your team, keep in mind that if you rotate down, you may turn a good 2v2 in a bad 3v3 if the other laner is ahead. (most laners in your tier will react to slow, so don't worry too much) Its important to help, if you can get objectives. 2 kills in the jungle = goldmine, ace = goldmine+turret, early game = steal camps and get more vision. below SA you're able to outfarm the other laner. Focus on cs and you'll stomp them in teamfights."

If the other team has stun be careful, of the other team as two stuns, rushing reflex block might not be a terrible idea if they're really agressive.

vainglorygame,3dl6ev,WSBowman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:11:31 2015 UTC,I'd honestly say try them all out to get the feel for it like Bowman said koshaka is pretty good for cheap melee and is really good when you understand her. And also try watching all the spotlights is what I did. I'm with you on Krul thou ever since I tried it free on the rotation I loved him and bought him with ice. Also helps if you know what you like the most jungle or lane dps or support range or melee tanky or not. With krul you can just jump into fights head on and little worry but others you gotta pick out petal is another I'd recommend
vainglorygame,3dl6ev,Mcmerk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:24:56 2015 UTC,Welcome! Koshka is definitely solid. I recommend going into a solo match or two and try a bunch of heroes out to find what feels fun for you :)

vainglorygame,3dk341,Kraken_SEMC,5,Fri Jul 17 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"IMO, you should know your first buy just from the hero select. You know who your hero is, you know what your team expects you to do (lane, jungle, support), and now you've seen the heroes you're up against. That should be enough for you to lock in your first buy and as Kraken just said, race out there.  For new players this isn't going to happen, and that's to be expected, they're new, it's ok. However, if you've played enough to understand building, counterbuilding, team comps, and the heroes in the game, you should know what you want for your very first buy."

vainglorygame,3dk341,JekyllMD,2,Fri Jul 17 03:55:15 2015 UTC,If farming the first jungle camp is your goal than you are losing out on experience when people steal your last 2 jungle camps.

Playing in solo queue is a tricky thing, and regardless of skill tier requires you to always play selflessly and be ready to learn and critique yourself each match if you want to improve."
vainglorygame,3djwo2,Kraken_SEMC,2,Fri Jul 17 00:59:20 2015 UTC,I honestly think it is just that the match making is still broken. I was pretty good gold hotness bronze before and now I am pretty good bronze and i add people and I get not bads and decentish on my teams. It is absurd.
vainglorygame,3djwo2,KarmaAdjuster,2,Fri Jul 17 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's match making that is broken. It's the specific spot you are in that makes it hard. At the very low end, nobody knows anything, so everyone is at the same level. At the very high end, players all have a general understanding of how to play every aspect of the game, and it comes down to nuance and skill. In the middle, where the vast majority of us are, it's just a total mess.   In the mid range tiers, You've got players there who know one champ really well, but have a total lack of understanding of many of the other champs. There are some players who are mediocre to good at a variety of different champs that will work well in any comp, but probably are never going to carry a match. Other players here may have gotten to this skill level playing a variety of champs, but are still trying to learn new ones, and naturally aren't as strong with those champs yet. You even have players that are exceptionally skilled mechanic wise, but couldn't care less about their teammates.   All of these players will be able to make it to the mid range tiers, and sometimes they will work well together, and sometimes things will just blow up in their face. There's just no good way for a match maker to accurately predict how well a player will do because it doesn't have access to all the variables. For that you'd really need a psychic crystal ball.  So just blaming the match maker isn't exactly fair. You're really just expecting the impossible from it. However, there is something you can do. What I have found that works for me is when I'm playing at a level where I feel I can carry two players that are at least a full name tier or more below me, I will solo queue ranked. However, when I feel like I'm getting closer to where I need all players to be at least within two sub tiers of me (for example, if I'm gold and they are bronze), then I will only play ranked when I can party up with people I know and trust.  This accomplishes two things. First, you won't get stuck with toxic people who rage or afk (assuming you don't friend toxic people). And secondly, when playing in casual mode, you can take that opportunity to try new things and improve your game in an arguably less stressful environment. The key to it being not stressful is that you have to make every goal for the casual queue a lesson to be learned, and not about winning. For example, one casual queue game I decided to see if CP glaive was at all viable. Verdict: NO WAY. At least not in my hands. I lost that match handily, but won the learning lesson, and it didn't hurt my ranked Elo at all."
vainglorygame,3djwo2,jklick,3,Fri Jul 17 21:31:03 2015 UTC,"First, it's worth noting that others are having a little bit of difficulty with the ranked matchmaking as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/vainglorygame/comments/3dfr3l/what_is_up_with_ranked_right_now_dev_response_plz/  As far as having fun, try new things or practice things you're not good at which will make you a better player, thereby helping you climb further. You've got 3 roles (jungle, support, lane) and 16 heroes to learn. Many of those heroes can be built successfully as CP or WP, each usually having a different play style. Many of those heroes can be played in multiple roles as well. There's really limitless amounts of combinations for you to practice and get good at.  You could also shift some of your time allocation from playing to watching. Streamers often show me play styles and strategies I hadn't considered before. I often will go to ShinKaigan's or FooJee's Twitch channel and watch past broadcasts that I missed (they're all available on demand)."

vainglorygame,3djwo2,bananapatata,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:34 2015 UTC,"I'm only in Hotness but here's two things that helped me rank up (as a jungler/support player):  Don’t forget about the turrets. It's a great idea to keep power farming and earning gold if your minions are beyond the fifty and the enemy team is trying to push them back.   But if you’re in the jungle and you see that the enemy minions have made it to your turret or their  team is attacking the turret, then you NEED to move back if your lamer is not there. Come back for gold later. Defend the turret and do not let them destroy it. This gives the other team a large offensive advantage against you.  Conversely, if you’re above level 6 and a team fight breaks out and two of the enemy team members die, then push the turret if possible (i.e., as longs as you aren’t crazy low on health). Do not focus the single player that is trying to bait you towards their base. Focus the turret and on bringing it down. With two of you there you can probably bring it down pretty quickly and if someone has a reflex block/fountain you can honestly probably just take the hits. Aggressively go after the enemy turret if you have the strength in numbers and aggressively defend your own turret if you see them invade. The only way to win is by destroying these objectives - don’t lose sight of that. It's ok to leave the jungle. Just like it's ok for the laner to circle down for jungle invades.   My second tip is decide how to use their death timer. If the enemy dies how are you going to take advantage of their countdown timer. Go home and heal? No. You're gonna steal their jungle or farm and make use of that time. Potion up. If you can capture their whole jungle even just once you've basically just gotten yourself a free Tier 1 item the enemy won't have."

vainglorygame,3dlfal,MrTouchnGo,3,Fri Jul 17 07:09:23 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why they don't do something because ""people will be toxic""... Can't we deal with the occasional troll? I mean that's why they implemented the downvotes system.  I hate that the many get punished for the actions of the few."
vainglorygame,3dlfal,Mattpalmq,5,Fri Jul 17 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm not in favor of in game chat for a few reasons.    It's not necessary. Pings work sufficiently in most cases (if your teammates are experienced enough and trust you). In more serious games, you should be on a dedicated voice chatting client anyways.  It's not simple. Implementing chat, either voice or text, is no simple task. We've had a lot of issues with friend and group chat, but those were pretty necessary for the game. Hell, I still have issues with chat sometimes. I'm sure SEMC would rather dedicate their resources elsewhere.  Toxicity. Ping spamming is already annoying as hell. Lots of people complain about it. Now imagine voice chat with that sarcastic upthumbing and smiley facing SAW. He'd be screaming at you. You would be screaming at him. Not a fun time. People get salty as fuck in MOBAs. Even when you're winning. I think keeping toxicity as low as possible is a good idea at this point."
vainglorygame,3dlfal,MrTouchnGo,2,Fri Jul 17 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"It's awesome to hear the thoughts and concerns. Know that we are always looking to improve how players can connect and communicate with each other, but will always aim to do it in such a way as to help protect against toxic play."

vainglorygame,3dlfal,Tsar_MapleVG,2,Fri Jul 17 07:41:27 2015 UTC,VoiceChat is very unreliable when built in because the focus of the game is not the voice chat. You're much better off getting with friends and using Skype or Discord.

I just lost a rank game (im at rank5 gold) playing with someone who clearly was VERY CONFUSED as to how ironguard contract works.  I was taka and he was Catherine.    He buys ironguard contract as first item (ok good start..)--but then throughout the game he refuses to engage jungle creeps and pinging for ME to engage them.  He then continuously tries to steal last hits from me, and gets all temper tantrum ping-y when he doesn't get them.  Again--he had the ironguard contract, not me!    Oh, and my other teammate, solo vox in the lane, ALSO bought ironguard contract as his first item.  ?? Maybe he thought Catherine was going to join him in lane or something?  I dunno....

vainglorygame,3diyca,TakaCoffee_SEMC,2,Thu Jul 16 22:02:33 2015 UTC,Yup :) I already got to play lots of heroes in casual - I had already played before the level system was introduced and probably have more games than most others at level 9 (74 wins)  General Question though: Is there something like placement matches similar to LoL?

vainglorygame,3diha8,PR4X15,7,Thu Jul 16 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"I can no longer comfortably use her at POA bronze. I already preferred WP before the recent update, so I think CP is pretty much dead. It's tough to get enough money in jungle to feed the WP build.  So assuming you're WP lane, your job got much harder with the Book of Eulogies nerf. An aggressive traditional laner can really mess you up. But it's still possible to lane OK, and you can harass well once you get a few WP items. 1v1, as you say, isn't too bad.   To me, the problems come in the team fight stage. You have to get close to use thunderstrike effectively, but you have a big target on you due to the DPS you represent. You have one escape ability (jump), which is so much worse than sonic zoom (Vox also has to get close). Rocket Jump is slower, and you really want to use it offensively. If you use it to jump away, you've probably already lost that fight. Yes, the cooldown is low when you overdrive it, but that doesn't happen until level 11. Even on overdrive, by the time you use the 2nd jump, the fight is often decided one way or the other.   My experience has been Koshka/fortress/taka/Catherine/Glaive gap closing and killing me fast or me spending the first half of the fight just trying to survive. Taka especially is a problem, because of the thunderstrike hitbox change.  If you are a very good laner that can deal with the Book change and a great carry who can position to do damage when being focused by the enemy team, then you can thrive. I am not good enough to do that at my ranked tier. Or you could just go play Ringo/Vox and have more natural advantages for those situations."
vainglorygame,3diha8,dubiousatbest,2,Thu Jul 16 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"Your observations on her lane abilities are dead on.

vainglorygame,3diha8,JekyllMD,4,Thu Jul 16 22:39:29 2015 UTC,"Well. She's back on free rotation so you should see a lot more of her in Casual.   Her BRB is nerfed, so it's more of a utility than kill button. It's nice to finish off fleeing enemies and to kill stunned opponents. Hence, we don't see as much CP Joule.   I still see more Broken Myth CP Joule than crit build WP Joule. I don't know the consensus in higher tiers. I'm PG."
vainglorygame,3diha8,peterkeats,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"If I see her used in Hotness, SA, PoA, she's WP. People seem to replace one of the tyrant's monocles with tornado trigger. Otherwise, same old crit strike build. Haven't seen her in lane since the update."
vainglorygame,3diha8,WSBowman,3,Thu Jul 16 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"I still play her pretty often, and usually have great success with her too.

Still seems decent...but they made the right call bringing her down a peg. She was way OP before.

I don't think its ""rude as hell"" that the bonuses aren't exactly what you want.  As a consumer it is your choice how you spend your money. If you don't like it either don't buy it or spend more to get the bigger bonus.  Also everything in the game can be obtained for free which is a lot different than most mobile games (which aren't as good as VG)."
vainglorygame,3di02z,neuken_inde_keuken,5,Thu Jul 16 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"I would give them money if their system and pricing wasn't so ridiculous.  Make the skins as expensive as you want but I'm not paying $10 for one hero.  Let me pay 2.99 for a hero and I wouldn't have to think about it, I'll buy them right at the hero select screen.  Instead I'll just wait to get them with the free currency."
vainglorygame,3di02z,Deepmist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:05 2015 UTC,I honestly think their pricing is fair compared to other games. I just think their system from buying ICE could use a clean up.

vainglorygame,3di02z,Moofisilla,0,Fri Jul 17 02:30:40 2015 UTC,That was the 'free currency' mentioned above
vainglorygame,3di02z,BlueDmon,5,Fri Jul 17 15:06:55 2015 UTC,You have to understand that SEMC is missing out on potential dollars because the $20 option looks so unattractive to buy in its current state. I'm sure many customers have instead gone for the $10 knowing that the 860 ICE wouldn't grab them another hero or skin (and because the $50 option is too much for a lot of people). Offering a mid-range price point between $20 and $50 isn't unreasonable and neither is changing the bonus ICE at the $20 mark from 15% to 17%. I promise SEMC employees will still have food on the table.
vainglorygame,3di02z,nyadav,2,Thu Jul 16 18:42:24 2015 UTC,Well it's not just the league system that this pricing system is based after its fairly common with any type of made up currency to give odd numbers so as to either make you think it costs less than it does (the microsoft method where $10 was 800 points so you thought oh it's only like $8) or pretty much any f2p game that gives like 607 points n you need 610 or some shit. It was even in games like Maplestory back in the day.  Like you said part of it is to incentivize you to spend more money but the main reason is really to make basically buy something for more than it's worth. Basically this item is worth $11 they have a $10 package n a $20 package. You just spent $20 for something that cost $11.
vainglorygame,3di02z,celerityx,2,Thu Jul 16 15:28:00 2015 UTC,"Of course other games and platforms use this same business model, I was just pointing out League due to its popularity. Main point was they're going for this strategy as opposed to like... Heroes of the Storm where you buy content directly and without artificial currencies."
vainglorygame,3di02z,KingQuet90,2,Thu Jul 16 18:45:48 2015 UTC,If you buy only $100 ICE packs it's completely possible to get back down to 0 ICE if you only buy new heroes/skins and not card packs lol. Not that most people would do this.
vainglorygame,3di02z,peterkeats,2,Thu Jul 16 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"Well -- if you spend $40 (which I did), you end up with 5280 ICE.  So with that, you could buy 5 900 ICE cost heroes and 1 780 ICE hero and end up with 0 left over.  So it does make some sense.    Though I agree, it is frustrating and something of a turnoff.  I'm all for supporting the company, but the current pricing structure feels like something an ""F you"", especially if you just want to buy one hero -- the 1300 option doesn't even leave you enough ICE for a card box."
vainglorygame,3di02z,VATigerfan,3,Fri Jul 17 15:28:48 2015 UTC,They base it off the $5...which is 240 ice more than buying the $5 pack 4 times. Should they also reduce the ice in the other packs to make it so its only 100 ice more.
vainglorygame,3di02z,peterkeats,2,Thu Jul 16 13:08:57 2015 UTC,"The pattern they use is begins at the $20 price point. The 100 bonus for $10 is just random. It's 10% bonus for $20, 15% bonus for $50, and 20% bonus for $100. I'm just saying I think the bonus should be raised slightly for the $20 pp as having a price point in the 2700~ ICE range is infinitely more attractive than 2640 ICE unless they really want to make people choose between $10 and $50. Or at least add another price point at $35.  TL;DR: $20 price point feels bad. Increase $20 bonus % or add $35 price point."
vainglorygame,3di02z,JekyllMD,2,Thu Jul 16 14:17:21 2015 UTC,Maybe they can make it 2679.

vainglorygame,3di02z,lbcsax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:20:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's just me, but the main reason why I still haven't bought ICE yet is because I don't like the leftovers.  I kept trying to calculate different combinations and methods that allows my ICE to get back to 0 but it seems the only way is to buy 14400 and 16 heroes/skins, which is more than what I need, not to mention I can't buy ICE boxes at all this way.

vainglorygame,3dhxnu,An0therk,7,Thu Jul 16 12:28:11 2015 UTC,Since a lot of the skins released are of alternate realities of the Heroes including Catherine and Ardan I reckon celests will have something to do with her 'storm queen' legacy that was talked about in the lore.  I don't know what the storm queen would look like but I would assume along the lines of royalty.  A cool crown and fancy staff and storm guard colours and crests.  What do you think? Celeste is my favourite hero by a country mile so am exited to say the least about her skins.
vainglorygame,3dhxnu,peterkeats,4,Thu Jul 16 12:31:57 2015 UTC,"I think it will go in the other direction, with her leading the rebellion against the Storm Queen. Commando Celeste."

vainglorygame,3dj2sp,UniqueRaj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:10:46 2015 UTC,If I had one comment that is a complaint and a good thing at the same time it would be the amount I have to use my fingers. When I played Leauge I would hold down where I wanted to go so naturally I do it here. It leads to problems because I guess on Droid Mobile it only registers one press at a time. I main Catherine so that leads to some problems but I'm fixing the bad habit.   The reason that is good is because after a 20 minute game it feels like I've been playing for hours so I take short breaks in between games. Prevents me from spending 8 hours at a time on this game which I totally would if I could handle it.
vainglorygame,3dj2sp,NotRoosterTeeth,3,Fri Jul 17 01:57:12 2015 UTC,"We actually had the hold functionality in way back when, but it did encourage bad habits with players leaving their hands on the screen and occluding vision so we opted to force the tap only behavior. It's much more effective better for managing screen occlusion. When I first started playing VG I had to fight the same instinct though, I must say."

vainglorygame,3dfrr5,Mattpalmq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:47:27 2015 UTC,A few reasons. Chat would be hard to implement on a mobile game. For anyone on a phone they would have to pause the game to chat and tablet the best they could do would be have it take up half the screen.   They would also have to deal with trolls and ect. who plagued Leauge and similar games. Most communication I want to have with my team I can do through the amazing ping system.
vainglorygame,3dfrr5,NotRoosterTeeth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:04:10 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, a text-based chat system in an iOS/Android game takes time away from actually playing the game. Which would you rather have, a teammate who pauses for half a second to ping, or one who stops for a good 5-10 seconds to say ""Let's take gold mine."" Vainglory's ping system is certainly not perfect and in-person communication obviously works better, but the pings are absolutely fine for communication.  The other option I can see for chat purposes is a vocal chat client. This comes with its own share of issues, and I know that some of these would certainly include: playing loud and/or copyrighted sounds to drown out teammates and/or merely be annoying, verbal abuse (that is MUCH harder to track down and punish players for doing), and a extreme increase in server load (constant streaming of audio to you from 2 other devices would add a lot more to what you need to receive, perhaps not overwhelming your internet but certainly adding a large strain to the servers).  Go ask Fates Forever or Heroes of Order and Chaos about their chat systems. They each still have fans, but not near as many and I believe their way of handling team communication had a key element in that."

I start game with a weapon blade. First recall I get a book of eulogies and a swift shooter. Second recall I upgrade my book to the T2 life steal item(name is slipping my mind at the moment)  next is creating two blazing salvos. When the salvos are complete, heavy blade and a six sins. Get your serpent mask next. After serpent mask, I go sorrow blade, tornado trigger, tyrants monocle, and bonesaw. Keep buying weapon infusions after you have your sorrow blade.

I will usually get boots after finishing my fountain and before completing SB to help with ganks. The fountain is great at helping prevent getting burst down by Taka or Koshka, but if I am not facing either one I might just rush SB. Glaive is deadly when you get that SB on him, I dont bother with Serpent mask unless I am playing lane."

vainglorygame,3dfr3l,Andys29,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:28:32 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need to entice people back into the ranked queue. Ideas: - double glory in ranked (or maybe even ice awards?) or half glory in casual - wins in casual don't count towards the daily bonuses or the sinister seven - send people to the back of the queue if they haven't played a ranked game in a while.  I suspect there is a positive feedback loop you need to break.
vainglorygame,3dfr3l,louche_goose,5,Thu Jul 16 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think people should be punished for playing casual. Otherwise they will all come into ranked with their WP Celestes and Jungle Ringos. Everything should stay the same for casual but incentivise ranked, e.g. double the chance to get cards or new achievement like get 25% bonus glory for first daily win in ranked."
vainglorygame,3dfr3l,lcpdragonslayer,5,Thu Jul 16 11:37:57 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I've to agree. I think it's nearly impossible to play ranked soloq in high elo right now. The 10min queue feels much worse than the old 2:57. I don't play ranked anymore and I know other players who play only in teams or casual, because of the bad matchmaking. This obviously reduces the small high elo playerbase in ranked even more."

Seems close to impossible to get a decent even match in the lower-middle tiers now. I don't particularly mind playing exclusively casual, and my matches there have been consistently good, but it's hard for me to figure out how this new system is in any way an improvement on the old one.  My feeling is that if they want to split off new players while also providing enough player base to actually support a ranked experience the two queues should be ""New Players"" (Level 7 and below maybe) and ""Ranked"". I guess some people had issues before with players testing out new builds etc. in the ranked queue, but that issue seems dwarfed by simply not being able to get players at your own level to play with."

I came from playing League and DotA, so I had knowledge as to how the game should progress and used that to get out of the lower tiers and into mid-high.  You just need to grind through games until your Casual MMR matches you with same skilled players.  Casual it's not going to be the most serious since rank isn't on the line.  Granted I was able to completely skip having to play in Casual, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  Also, how long did that 40-2 game last?

You should have gotten an Ironguard Contract and supported the jungler, or if you insisted on staying in lane you would have at least made gold off of the Ringo's good last-hitting skills with IGC. You push the Lane when you have an advantage, not just constantly pushing to your own death. What skill tier was this? I may have to try and friend this Ringo."
vainglorygame,3dj48k,Zaggaz,5,Thu Jul 16 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, gonna have to agree with you on this one. OP seems like he doesn't understand the meta. Support chars should buy IGC and go help the jungle. Support chars should also allow the carries to level up faster so that they can...you know...carry. Support gets plenty of gold from the IGC to bolster his inventory in early game and then can finish his leveling in midgame during team fights."
vainglorygame,3dj48k,ballerstatusachieved,3,Thu Jul 16 19:25:17 2015 UTC,Hahaha...I'm still trying to figure out if troll post as well.
vainglorygame,3dj48k,DatAznOne,-6,Thu Jul 16 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"Not a trolling post. Ive double laned with Adiago and Ringo before and it was a beautiful dance that almost always lead to a powerful team. Support is supposed to help, yes. but Lane is also supposed to help Support and the rest of his team. This Ringo simply took and was selfish  im aware of how support characters work. the issue was i was simply unable to level up or buy any items because Ringo hung back and only showed face until it was time to reap rewards. so i stayed squishy and weak, making any support i could provide near worthless. By the time I figured out what he was doing, the game (easily 8-10 minutes in) was already skewed so hard the other direction.   this is ignoring the whole fact i selected ""Lane"" as Asiago at the beginning and Ringo was the last to choose their Hero. by the time i realized my Lane build of Asaigo isnt going to cut it, it was already too late   You push the Lane when you have an advantage, not just constantly pushing to your own death   You misunderstand. Its not that he didnt push when I thought he should push, he didnt push; at all. he literally just hung back and stole last hits and ran at the first sight of an enemy player. Its hard to support a character who isnt fighting. enemy players would pop in and kill a few minions from a distance so there was always a constant pressure on us to push back a little bit, he didnt push back at all the whole game. its not ""he took my minion kills, wahhhh"", he literally took 97% of the chances of me or anyone else gaining xp and gold and continued to do it even after he hit level 12.  its hard to say he was doing anything right when we lost very quickly and he walked away with a 4/4/1. enemy team had maybe 15 kills and us 6. It was in skill tier 3 (I was knocked down from 5 due to crappy matchmaking) so chances are hes not very skilled considering his actions from beginning to end were not team oriented.     Regardless, my whole point of this post was better communication in the game. not whining about this cats play style. I merely mentioned it because its what made me to decide to make this post. Im sure we all have storys about wanting to be able to tell a player something or to ask them a question but couldnt.  At least with better communication outlets, instances like this and others could be settled quickly. youd be able to tell the inexperienced Glaive to hide in the tall grass more often, or the Krul to sneak attack the moment you walk past a landmark. Or in this case, ask what the hell hes doing and to allow other players to buy items and level up."
vainglorygame,3dj48k,Ares-2,4,Thu Jul 16 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"Your problem isn't communication, it's knowledge. The support, Adagio is a good sup. hero but also an ok adc, should stay in the jungle with an IGC. The support shouldn't get last hits at all and give all cs to the semi carry in the jungle. Ringo did a good job, he froze the lane and got last hits. Thats what you should do, as a laner.  It wrong to play with two laners, but it's fine in your tier.  If you play a hero like Adagio, which is a great pick IMO, try to adapt to your team. It's possible that another player picks a laner, even if you indicated it. Buy an IGC as the first item and go in the jungle. There is an IGC video in the academy, if you're not sure how it works. I think that he's more skilled than you, he did a few things different (or better than you) but you had no idea that he's doing the right thing. Thats fine, just try to learn and if teammates do something different, chances are that they're doing it better."
vainglorygame,3dj48k,Ares-2,-3,Thu Jul 16 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"The support, Adagio is a good sup. hero but also an ok adc, should stay in the jungle with an IGG   i clearly stated i selected ""lane"" for Adiago, well before Ringo was selected or locked in.    The support shouldn't get last hits at all and give all cs to the semi carry in the jungle.    i was forced into the support role after I already started my lane build. As i stated. whats one to do when they dont have any gold and already spent it on items that dont contribute to whats needed?   Ringo did a good job, he froze the lane and got last hits.   no, the lane was not frozen, we were constantly being pushed back. As i stated. we lost the game in approx 10 minutes because he had two players who several levels behind and severely under funded.   It wrong to play with two laners, but it's fine in your tier.   Again, i picked Lane first and initially. theres no reason for me or anyone to think i am playing a support role.   t's possible that another player picks a laner, even if you indicated it.   yes, im aware. the issue arises when the other person (who chose second) decides to force you to play a certain way.   Buy an IGC as the first item and go in the jungle.   If I selected and intended to do jungle or support, i would have. but i didnt. i played lane. See where im coming from yet?   I think that he's more skilled than you, he did a few things different (or better than you) but you had no idea that he's doing the right thing. Thats fine, just try to learn and if teammates do something different, chances are that they're doing it better.   no no, you clearly did not read my post. I understand the role of support and lane, ive played MOBAs for years and VG for a few months. Ringo wants to lane too? great, lets do it, its usually a toss up on how well we do. but after i clearly expressed im doing lane, and to lock it in, for him to decide he wants me to do support instead is not team-play. that is, unless there were better ways to communicate (""hey fredman, i saw you picked lane but would you do support instead?"")  to steal your teammates kills for the entirety of the game so they barely collect 1k gold and only hit level 6 while you waddle away with over 5k at level 12 in the first 7 minutes of the game, is NOT advanced play style at all. leaving your teammates several levels behind the enemy team is NOT advanced play. its illogical to think anything right was happening when we lost in record time and the rest of the team was severely underpowered because of his play style."
vainglorygame,3dj48k,TSRodes,6,Thu Jul 16 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"I read your post. Yes it's not nice to pick another laner if someone already selected it. BUT you see that he picks ringo and you play a support hero! You should buy an IGC and DON'T go in the lane. You shouldn't get a single cs in lane or steal xp from your carry. He played the laner right and you played the support wrong. Sry, but that's your mistake. Try to learn all roles in VG, you obviously don't understand it. The academy videos and guides on vgfire are great."
vainglorygame,3dj48k,juanplusjuan,5,Thu Jul 16 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"This game is about teamwork and adaptation. I'm only at PG, and a lot of people play way out of meta. When teammates go rogue, get selfish or don't act in the team's interest, the best way to tip the scales is to calm down and play to the team MORE. The more you contribute to their style of play (when feasible), the more they'll contribute to yours.   The most critical problem (as stated) is that you didn't get IGC. It always pays for itself, and turns greedy teammates into cash cows. As an Adagio player, you should really familiarize yourself with when to buy it. It doesn't matter if you auto-locked lane (which sucks); what matters is that you could've seen gold off of almost every minion Ringo killed, but you chose to forego that investment. Having selected ""lane"" does nothing to nullify or refute Ares' point.   It sounds like you selected a character before the rest of your team (specifically Ringo). I suggest leaving your ideal character soft-locked, and making an informed decision after the other teammates lock in. Not doing this is about as selfish as picking a second lane or stealing your last hits.   I play support most of the time, and I used to feel constantly under-powered. Then, I realized that meant I was doing something right. If nobody else is playing support and you're freaking ADAGIO, it's your responsibility --that is, if you want to win (and reduce your salinity).   EDIT: To be honest, IGC isn't your biggest problem. The real issue is that you're demonstrating arrogance by refusing to accept the advice that every user is giving you in unison. Why do you think so many people thought this was a troll post?"

You don't get much gold as support compared to your teammates and by this time the game is already over.    I disagree about warhorn being unnecessary.

If you don't see a Krul, Glaive, or Vox that you think will be very problematic, rush Fountain of Renewal. If they do, get Atlas Pauldron. After that, Crucible's going to be your priority for a stronger barrier.  I would not purchase Warhorn or Contraption, as they aren't necessary for a support to be effective and are superfluous in most cases."

I used to build a dragonheart and then build tension bow.  This was great for early game and with Ardan's b-skill, it was very punishing since teamfights were long and the support is usually alive the longest.  After that, I'd build the rest of my support items (fountain, pauldron, crucible, depending on the situation). Unfortunately, after the update where skaarf was OP (I'm sure we all remember those dark days), Ardan's support wasn't as useful and fell out of the meta. When they fixed Skaarf, Fortress came out, so Ardan fell out of use even more.  I still use that build in casual from time to time - if you'd like, try it out."

vainglorygame,3dh1hl,peterkeats,2,Thu Jul 16 19:00:21 2015 UTC,Screen space and touch issues. Good luck typing out messages and having them responded to.
vainglorygame,3dh1hl,peterkeats,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"So apparently just mentioning ""why no chat"" causes some people to immediately downvote.

vainglorygame,3dfmdf,SizeNine,6,Wed Jul 15 22:01:16 2015 UTC,The best thing to do today is hop into a solo practice match. It's the best way to test your connection with the servers realistically.
vainglorygame,3dfmdf,Kraken_SEMC,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, we can do this and determine it, but out of everyone who plays vainglory, I'm sure only 99.5 Percent of players would do this. I'm sure bad games can be prevented just by adding a small, real time ping indicator. No one expects lag."
vainglorygame,3dfmdf,treboR-,2,Thu Jul 16 03:15:10 2015 UTC,"As simple as that sounds, it's actually a fairly complicated and costly thing to operate. The other issue is that network traffic is intrinsically fluid. So, even if your ping is near 0, a few moments later, out of your control, your network could spike for any number of reasons which would invalidate your data."
vainglorygame,3dfmdf,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:32 2015 UTC,I guess it's true that it can spike easily. I guess I'll go into practise mode before many of my games to test my ping to prevent unexpected lag.

vainglorygame,3dgsuc,Desolemere,6,Thu Jul 16 03:52:06 2015 UTC,I assume it's easier to make more skins based on a concept you are already working on than to start a whole new skin concept
vainglorygame,3dgsuc,juanplusjuan,6,Thu Jul 16 04:05:36 2015 UTC,Taka is already confirmed to have a skin in the next update.
vainglorygame,3dgsuc,ArcticJelly,6,Thu Jul 16 04:18:58 2015 UTC,"Do you want good skins, or just crap thrown onto Taka / Celeste / Vox that is technically a skin, but kind of sucks?   SEMC puts a lot of effort into making skins that aren't just eye-candy, but also have a story, context, and an ecosystem. Higher tier skins have special effects added in.   SEMC doesn't just make skins, they make inspired skins, they make awesome skins. They need time to make something that isn't just Taka in green, or Celeste with black hair. They are making something more.   I am being patient. It is paying off with Catherine. Look at Tier 3 Ringo, that one is amazing, and I didn't even think they were doing more than 2 tiers. Buff devil Adagio is badass.   Enjoy! I don't think you'll be disappointed."
vainglorygame,3dgsuc,peterkeats,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:29:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My mains (one for each role) are Taka, Celeste, and Catherine. I am so excited for my favorite, Taka, but wow, Catherine II looks amazing! I'm really pleased with SEMC's consistently awesome work and can't wait to see more of it."
vainglorygame,3degyu,thebrain_161,8,Wed Jul 15 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"I totally understand the idea, but there are a few issues I have with it that keep me from really going for it. First of, you would also need Utility as a selection option. It's not always a WP vs CP question. The next is around adaptation and flexibility of the meta. The meta is constantly evolving and with that, sometimes hybrid builds, or counter intuitive builds start to become strong and favorable, and yet, because it is a fluid entity, can cause great frustration of different team members have differing understandings of that meta. I see to many cases where this is either only true until you see the enemy's build, or causes internal team frustration before the match even starts by folks feeling lied to when another player starts evolving their build or trying something that differs from their understanding of the meta."
vainglorygame,3degyu,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I buy the players getting upset because a teammate ""lied"" reason. I would imagine that anyone who is concerned about having a balanced team composition would be more tolerant of teammates adapting to the other team.  And on the note of adaptation and evolving the meta, do players really get upset at each other when people who have selected jungle or support come to lane to gank, or vice versa? I would like to believe that most people would use a red/blue/utility notifier in champ select as their initial intention, not their set-in-stone-I'm-gonna-build-this-no-matter-what-come-hell-or-high-water build.  Regarding hybrid builds, I think that would be fairly straight forward to communicate to your teammates by alternating back and forth between red and blue.  I do agree that there should be a utility option as well. Go ahead and add that too assuming I've put your other concerns to rest ;)  If I haven't put your concerns to rest, here is an even better idea that addresses the same problem. Figure out a way to cram your teammate's builds onto the shop screen. That way you don't have to do the flipping back and forth and waiting to see what your teammates are buying. Also adding an undo purchase button would be super helpful for this as well as in other situations where lag causes an accidental purchase or just general misclicks."
vainglorygame,3degyu,KarmaAdjuster,2,Wed Jul 15 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"It's hard to determine what build you're going to use for certain heroes. Rona might build hybrid burst to counter Sustain King Krul on the other team, or she might be building 2x Serpent Mask for ultimate AoE sustain. A Ringo might go CP over WP in certain situations. Your teammates might not understand this and start raging when they think they've been deceived by a troll, when in fact you're just doing your best to be a flexible player.  Some heroes will have different builds based on the enemy team comp. Additionally, locking in CP or WP goes counter to being adaptable mid-game, which is something I definitely think ought to be encouraged."
vainglorygame,3degyu,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"I prefer designing game features for the positive team players, and not avoiding useful features just because they might be abused by toxic trolls."

vainglorygame,3degyu,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:56:31 2015 UTC,"The first thought that comes to my mind is the UI.  Lane/Jungle/Support selections are somewhat hidden as it is, and I realize this is likely being worked on for clarity, but while we don't have those selections clear as can be, I feel we shouldn't worry about WP/CP/Utility in the selection screen. Four out of five times, excluding hybrid builds, the first item a player buys clearly displays their build intentions to both teams. As for hybrid builds... they're pretty off meta and teams that choose to use them will have to deal with the consequences (good or bad) of that themselves."
vainglorygame,3degyu,VGFierte,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"I've experienced the same issue when other people play a hero off-meta and ends up creating a double weakness for the team. For example, said player plays CP Taka when I picked a mage and the other is a support. This would probably still happen if there was such option; the problem isn't lack of communication, it's differing ideas of the meta.  But sometimes we also need to the flexibility to change our builds based on the enemy and not just the team. This variability makes being flexible a necessary part. There are endless counter and re-counter possibilities at this point.   Simply adding this option doesn't mean everyone will respect the same meta and can lead to even more miscommunication without knowledge of the enemy team."
vainglorygame,3degyu,extraclevername,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:25:49 2015 UTC,Or mixed. Taka and Vox can play mixed really well.
vainglorygame,3degyu,ChapterLiam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:30:50 2015 UTC,"its a good idea but i dont think it really matters if your allies know what you will be building does it? it matters in game because you should be looking at the builds to make sure your whole team isnt all blue or red, allowing the enemy to easily counter build"

vainglorygame,3df77d,extraclevername,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah my team was down 2-5 innturrets and I got overdrive cp ardan and aced them for kraken, made the comeback and won"
vainglorygame,3df77d,Asa37,3,Thu Jul 16 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"They can also make it be based on the percentage of damage the teams dealt to the Kraken. Ex: Team B is taking Kraken, team A's whole team is there and steals it. Team B did 98% damage while Team A did 2% therefore Team B restores 98% while team A restores 2%."
vainglorygame,3df77d,treboR-,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:55 2015 UTC,"Isn't that the intended purpose of the kraken though? It's a very important objective for a reason, that's why capturing the kraken should be considered with more strategy and timing during matches so that it is not stolen or too imbalanced to defend against."
vainglorygame,3df77d,hardendapaint,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:02:36 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand the suggestion. the buff only heals you to full. you're suggesting that the buff be changed so it still heals you to full, but just faster? that would actually make it harder to fight with a Kraken buff active"
vainglorygame,3df77d,slightlyhorny,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:39:38 2015 UTC,It's like a high powered fountain over a slower time so it's tough to take someone down. I think OP is suggesting a faster health buff to full so the enemy team that got kraken is easier to kill? But not sure
vainglorygame,3df77d,Andys29,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"yes, but it only heals the difference between your max hp and your current hp, doesn't it? that's my understanding of how it works anyways  currently if you are bursty enough you can still burst through the heal and just kill them. if the heal were even faster they would be basically invincible for a few seconds while healing"
vainglorygame,3df77d,slightlyhorny,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:10:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've aced lots of kraken-killing adversaries. The slower heal is actually beneficial."
vainglorygame,3df77d,peterkeats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:37:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is balancing it: it has to be balanced so that a winning team doesn't become literally unstoppable by securing the buff, but so that the buff assists a losing team in coming back. Setting criteria in game for winning/losing from SEMC's perspective is almost impossible, as the number of turrets up and team KDA's don't always line up with who's really winning.  If the buff healed faster, winning teams wouldn't have that long-lasting fountain effect, and losing teams can challenge Kraken knowing that getting the buff means the other team will not immediately burst through the Kraken buff and ace them. I am not convinced that this is entirely necessary or even the right way to change things, but hopefully this clarifies my thoughts."

vainglorygame,3daln9,adyendrus,5,Tue Jul 14 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"It's less abrasive now, but I still want to provide some additional agency for players to help insulate themselves from overtly toxic expression."
vainglorygame,3daln9,Kraken_SEMC,2,Tue Jul 14 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"Having players that abuse the pings, like if I died and they keep ???? over the spot where I died. Or do the thumbs up after a death, its like dude we get it. Like I understand the functionality of it to communicate with minimal effort with your teammates, but some just push it. Especially since it's summer now and there seems to be a huge spike in trolls like that. An improvement on the ping system would definitely benefit the experience."
vainglorygame,3daln9,Kraken_SEMC,3,Wed Jul 15 00:27:15 2015 UTC,I totally hear you
vainglorygame,3daln9,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:06:28 2015 UTC,It's alright. Those people are merely wrong. :)
vainglorygame,3daln9,DeafSmithVG,2,Wed Jul 15 03:15:45 2015 UTC,"How many question mark pings is necessary in a 5 second window, really?   2 ? Pings every 10 seconds.  Seems simple enough.  i<3SEMC didnt happen, so I m hoping for a nerf on these pings.    -Ping specific mutes FTW please..."
vainglorygame,3daln9,KarmaAdjuster,2,Tue Jul 14 23:07:07 2015 UTC,Have you ever encountered a rage pinger who only used a specific set of pings to be obnoxious but was totally helpful with all their other pings? I find the ping spammers are too busying being obnoxious to be helpful. A full mute option seems like the most straightforward option to both implement as a developer and use as a player.
vainglorygame,3daln9,WSBowman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:18:13 2015 UTC,On the bright side your K/D was ridiculous! Nice job carrying despite that prick
vainglorygame,3daqry,Alkoholix,6,Tue Jul 14 20:39:34 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Ringo's perk is that each time he last hits, he gets a guaranteed crit for his next hit (that's the dice you see). Ringo is great as an ADC, but you may also want to try Vox as another option.   I also strongly recommend getting comfortable with at least one jungle and one support hero so as you solo queue you can fill in team roles more fully."
vainglorygame,3daqry,Kraken_SEMC,2,Tue Jul 14 20:42:26 2015 UTC,Ah ok thanks :) gonna try out vox when he is free to play. Any junglers/supports you can suggest? I just tried celeste but dont really like that playstyle
vainglorygame,3daqry,iOSJunkie,4,Tue Jul 14 21:04:22 2015 UTC,"Ringo, Catherine, and Koshka are a good core set of heroes to learn for lane, support, and jungle respectively. They are also low cost with glory or ICE, so they are easy to obtain."
vainglorygame,3daqry,glStelar,2,Tue Jul 14 21:41:22 2015 UTC,I just Tried out koshka and really liked it. But thanks :)
vainglorygame,3daqry,glStelar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"For support, you might want to try Fortress. He's an agressive support with a lot of mobility, like Koshka (when you're around teammates, which you should be as often as possible with him). He's also free to play this week!"
vainglorygame,3daqry,DoubleAyeKay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:19:50 2015 UTC,Yeah i've played him but was under the impression he is more of a tanky jungler.
vainglorygame,3daqry,iOSJunkie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:44:02 2015 UTC,"He is not innately tanky, but he is often built tanky with support items (fountain, atlas pauldrons, crucible, warhorn). He's considered support because of that and also the fact that he's usually the one that will (should) get IGC in the jungle, since support builds aren't as expensive as damage builds.  Another way to see that he's a good ""support"" is that his abilities do not need a lot of crystal power to be effective. It's not rare that he gets many killing blows even without any CP items. Thus he doesn't need CP/WP as much as other heroes and should build items that will support the team instead. The only CP items I would consider on Fortress are Aftershock (it does a lot of damage without needing a full damage build) or Clockwork (accelerates cooldowns and helps with energy).  That being said, feel free to try off-meta things and see how they work for you!"
vainglorygame,3daqry,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:55:18 2015 UTC,These 3 are the only 3 you will be able to afford when you hit lvl 10 for ranked. I am halfway through level 8 right now and I only have about 4k in total when most premium champs are 6k upwards. So sad I can't buy skaarf :(.
vainglorygame,3daqry,nyadav,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:52:09 2015 UTC,Be sure to maximize your playing and winning this weekend and following weekend. Double and Triple glory over the next with weekends.
vainglorygame,3daqry,KarmaAdjuster,3,Wed Jul 15 04:29:13 2015 UTC,Celeste is really another lane/carry hero primarily (though she can jungle). The top junglers today are probably Taka or Koshka. For support I think Catherine is probably top of the meta right now.
vainglorygame,3daqry,KarmaAdjuster,3,Tue Jul 14 22:28:01 2015 UTC,Btw Kraken (the guy above) is one of the awesome devs that tends to respond frequently on here :)
vainglorygame,3daqry,jatatcdc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"If you like Braum from LoL, you'll love Ardan. They aren't quite the same, but maining support in both games, those two are my respective favorites."
vainglorygame,3daqry,peterkeats,2,Wed Jul 15 03:07:30 2015 UTC,While I love playing support in lol I'm really not sure if i wanna play it in vainglory yet. I don't want to sound cocky or something but so far I hard carried all normal games (even went 30/2/0 or something while our whole team had only 31 kills.  ). That's cause I'm not New to the genre so it's kinda like I'm smurfing. But when I get into games with people better than me I'm excited to find out what supports do in this game :D
vainglorygame,3daqry,palusus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:12:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, you probably should stick to carrying until you start encountering some challenge from the other team. I suspect that will be pretty soon if you keep winning matches like that though. I feel like the vainglory matchmaking system is pretty quick about getting people to the ballpark of their skill level.  With regards to what supports do, they are responsible for purchasing items like the crucible, fountain, and ironguard contract. The first two can help save the team's bacon in team fights, while the contract is a huge money generator for the support player and their jungle partner. The contract is also the most complicated item, so be sure you check out the description and/or video tutorial in the tactics session. Some people will say that it's also the supports duty to place down mines, and while they aren't wrong, I believe it's everyone's duty on the team to place down mines - that are the League's wards (just with a little extra kick).  Edit: Hit save too early"

vainglorygame,3daqry,Lensjo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:22:44 2015 UTC,"If you like Vayne, try Vox. He is also a short range, high damage carry with a short dash for quick mid-fight repositioning."
vainglorygame,3daqry,adyendrus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:07:15 2015 UTC,I think I've tried him yesterday or the way before when he was free to play. If he's in the Rotation once again I'll be sure to check him out :)  Vayne is actually my most played champ since champion masteries came out :D
vainglorygame,3daqry,jatatcdc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:15:09 2015 UTC,"I also came to Vainglory from LoL. My 1# piece of advice is to practice mechanics. Coming from another MOBA-game you will probably get a good grasp of the game fairly quickly. What will harder for you is to get used to moving your character correctly, efficient kiting, walls you can jump over etc. I recomend you to go into either a casual game or just a guld rush (a gamemode). There you should look to practice mechanics. Try to kite jungle creeps, to look on the map while still controlling your character well. Hope I helped ya! IGN - Pokepig"

vainglorygame,3daqry,IdkwtS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:58:35 2015 UTC,I was always an AP main and ADC player in League. My friends actually complained because I never joined the tank meta of League. I play one of the tankiest characters in the tankiest way in Vainglory as often as I can. It's completely different from my experience in League.
vainglorygame,3daqry,IdkwtS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. In LoL I main Ashe and Jinx, both ADCs, but in VG I main junglers."

vainglorygame,3daqry,I_Was__Drunk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up on the meta - Don't 1v1 Krul, and don't chase Taka. Krul has too much lifesteal to 1v1 and Taka will turn around and take half of your health when his ult recharges after 12 seconds. Catherine and Fortress are the best supports right now, Joule is amazing, Taka and Krul are great junglers, and Koshka is deceptively tanky. Petal and Ringo and Vox are fantastic laners, Vox and Celeste are tricky to use but amazing late-game."
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,nyadav,2,Wed Jul 15 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"I just checked the activation range, and I didn't realize how massive it was. Standing in the center of the map allows you you aim anywhere, save for some spots behind the crystals and the sanctuaries. However, it would be pretty cool to snipe from anywhere. I don't thinks it's that necessary though."
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,JekyllMD,2,Wed Jul 15 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"I know it's not necessary in most cases, but in the case I described where I'm at base and need to ult the fight happening at the entrance of the enemy base (this has happened a few times in the past week) it's frustrating that I can't just point and click at that spot from base. This might sound like a one in a million shot to most people, but my sniping abilities with her ult are usually pretty good since I've played her so much haha."
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,IdkwtS,0,Wed Jul 15 01:00:14 2015 UTC,I've wanted this for a while but I thought it would be OP to implement that.
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,IdkwtS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:27:12 2015 UTC,How would it make it OP?
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,SizeNine,0,Wed Jul 15 02:57:50 2015 UTC,I just started playing LoL so I'm not sure if you're able to aim Ashe's or Ezreal's ult by moving the camera via map and clicking there but it seems a bit op to just be able to aim wherever you want from across the map and have your ult go exactly there.
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,IdkwtS,3,Wed Jul 15 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"Not having played for a good 2 months, I'm pretty sure Ashe & Ez's  ult have infinite range when casting; it wouldn't really make sense not to, considering their ults reach from base to base  Also, Xerath's ult has limited range, & you HAVE to direct around the map to use it to its full potential  [Edit: also, I don't see how extra accuracy would be a problem. It's all relative anyways, unlike a speed boost or an increase in damage]"
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,IdkwtS,-1,Wed Jul 15 03:39:36 2015 UTC,I would love to have the infinite casting on Celeste's ult! I just wasn't sure if people would think its too OP to just aim at Kraken and shoot there
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,jatatcdc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:58:46 2015 UTC,You can already hit kraken from base.
vainglorygame,3dbnqa,IdkwtS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about moving the camera there, clicking Kraken and sending your ult there. VG was my first moba and I didn't know this was standard in LoL until now."

vainglorygame,3dbnqa,JekyllMD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:11:10 2015 UTC,It would only be OP if her ult traveled at its old speed.

vainglorygame,3dd2w9,Ki11aBeez,2,Wed Jul 15 13:44:58 2015 UTC,"It's nice because it takes so much less time too. To really play dota you're looking at art least an hour and 20 minutes at any time to be done with the match, where with VG I can just whip out my phone while on the couch and be done in 30."
vainglorygame,3dd2w9,purekhaos,2,Wed Jul 15 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"yeah, i'll always play Dota but grinding out them ranked matches becomes so tiresome, the road to 4k can wait."

vainglorygame,3dcsfb,rocker248,3,Wed Jul 15 06:52:50 2015 UTC,"First of all, sorry if you had experience like this. I guess it is impossible to stop trolls in any online game.  However, I probably cannot agree on what you have said about your rank. It is very unlikely that you are the only one being matched with trolls, noobs and those kinds.   You will have bad matches, sometimes it is because of others, sometimes it is because of you. Suck it up if it is the first case and try to learn when it is the latter. Your opponents are playing under the same circumstances and people on higher tiers had to deal with that as well.  You have to know, that when you are stuck at a certain skill tier for a long time, then this might be your current skill level. It might be different when you play in a team match, but there are so many other factors which might bias the results."
vainglorygame,3dcsfb,nvrslnc,3,Wed Jul 15 09:31:26 2015 UTC,"The troll problem (and lag) is heinous right now. I believe OP; I'm having the same problems. It seriously makes the game no fun when laners refuse to lane/junglers stay in lane, trolls abuse pings/decide to run into turrets the whole match as 'revenge'. It happens most of the time in my experience."
vainglorygame,3dcsfb,octopusthe,0,Wed Jul 15 11:14:17 2015 UTC,"I know, I am not saying that there are no trolls. What I wanted to say is that everybody plays under the same circumstances. So when you are stuck in a certain skill tier, it means that you belong in that skill tier. At least under these circumstances.   I have recently picked up playing again and I have noticed that climbing is significantly harder. Partly because of trolls but probably also because of other reasons.  I was a steady POA two updates prior on my main but on my new acc I am only hotness gold or poa bronze. And this is probably my skill tier right now in the current meta."

vainglorygame,3dcs6i,octopusthe,2,Wed Jul 15 11:00:14 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue just yesterday. Auto-locker on saw, I soft-locked on Koshka, and the third player switched from Ringo to Catherine and chose support. As soon as I locked Koshka, they changed to Ringo and fought for gold in lane :("

vainglorygame,3dcs6i,halcyon400,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:35:41 2015 UTC,Adagio can DPS. But I'm guessing there were bigger issues with the team.
vainglorygame,3dcs6i,octopusthe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:06 2015 UTC,Yeah... the adagio stayed in lane and tried to solo the enemy team every chance he could. I think he was overestimating the power of  his healing ability.
vainglorygame,3dcs6i,nickmkats,3,Wed Jul 15 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'm feeling you right now. I'm not sure what is going on with the matchmaker in ranked. About 3 matches out of 10 are a complete blowout with our team just boat racing the other team which result in (predictably) very small Elo gains. THEN comes the losing skid. My team gets obliterated resulting in large Elo losses and loss of skill tier. I think if you are a solo-queuer like me (I don't really have time to find regular folks to play with) the game feels like I either get matched against a team of very low skill tier team or a very high skill tier team, there's just no consistency. I like casual queue well enough but there has been way too much randomness in both quality of teammate and consistency of game play to make it any fun.   That said, I actually get far less trolls lately in ranked vs. casual, I've had good teammates I feel. It seems like there is not a lot I can do in the game to influence the outcome. I do the exact same thing and kill it in one game and get crushed in the other.   tl;dr: VG is just a total crap shoot in both queues in the mid-tiers"
vainglorygame,3dcs6i,VGRedditSmurf,2,Wed Jul 15 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"Solo queue in either casual or ranked is impossible, even in (especially in) higher tiers. As far as I can tell, team balance is achieved by summing the skills tiers, then checking if the total is within 5; maybe the total is within 2, for ranked. But that's doesn't preclude POA, PG, PG (one should be so lucky) from running into SA, SA, SA."

vainglorygame,3dbhsb,midnightstriker,4,Tue Jul 14 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"Before answering your question, I'd like to say one thing that IMO is a massive and vital difference between Taka and Koshka's playstyles that newcomers to either hero from the other may not know right off the bat. Feel free to disagree, but I feel that the following is how you engage with each assassin. The main difference between Koshka and Taka is that Taka pounces to an enemy and uses the speed off of his critical strikes to keep up with and/or give chase to his target. Koshka, however, typically will use her pounce to get on top of an enemy, spin, and then either engage with her stacks or use that speed to hop out and back into the fray (with her pounce's cooldown being so short, she might just use the pounce to re-engage). Koshka can't turn invisible, so allowing your tank take as much of the focus as possible is even more vital than it is with Taka.  As to builds, in Koshka's current 1.6 shape, I heartily suggest rushing a Shatterglass, but grabbing tier 1 boots and an oakheart as you work up to that. I'd recommend grabbing a Broken Myth and Eve of Harvest after this, and then focusing some defensive items. Please note, the Shatterglass/Broken Myth combo alone is 6100 gold! Building these items will give you MASSIVE burst damage, but it's pricey, so you absolutely cannot fall behind on farm. Whether your team is winning or losing, you have to keep farming as much as you possibly can until you've finished at least the Shatterglass and one other tier 3 item.  As a final word, the biggest mistake with Koshka that I see out of new players, typically in lower skill tiers, is getting tier 2 or 3 boots too early. In most games you will not need and likely should never build your boots all the way to tier 3, and the 200 HP and move speed bonus from tier 2 is better for Koshka towards late game. Koshka is fast while she uses her abilities-- you don't need boots, so please don't rush them. You're just delaying your power spikes and overall effectiveness if you do that.  Good luck, and hope to see you soon on the Halcyon Fold!"

vainglorygame,3dbhsb,VGRedditSmurf,2,Wed Jul 15 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"In high-Elo games I see a lot of players opening Fountain first, before Shatterglass. But I can't tell you why or what it means, since I don't play Koshka. Just something to consider."
vainglorygame,3dbhsb,ChapterLiam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a Taka main (when I play Jungler, at least) and I usually get Lifespring as my second item, usually even before boots, because after picking off one person, I can go back to the bushes and let a team fight continue without me (thank you, B Skill!) and jump back in using X-Retsu/Kaku to steal another life. Becauswnof the invisibility skill, I am guaranteed to win a chase. That means I can get away to a bush and even just for a few seconds I can recharge life and my ult. It's so useful for characters that deal burst damage because our fights are so quick."
vainglorygame,3dbhsb,theSDRexperiment,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"I am only in The Hotness, but I see a lot of Vainglorious players on stream build Koshka like this:   Fountain Tier 1 Boots Crystal - Shatterglass or Aftershock - opinions vary Broken Myth   often - game over by then. Infusions 2nd Defense (Atlas Pauldron or Aegis) Void Battery Maybe Eve out of Void Battery  You can even lane like this, if you buy a book of Eulogies first and hold on to it.   With Taka I see a lot of early triple weapon blade and then early invades and the whole Sorrowblade, Bonesaw build."

vainglorygame,3d8zok,jimmytruelove,3,Tue Jul 14 13:03:57 2015 UTC,"There is actually truth to what you're saying. Countering abilities is especially important in the early games. Like if you're up against a taka before he builds a tension bow, building a tier 1 or 2 shield can greatly reduce the damage he does to you. That may not be true in the late game if he's building weapon.  The same applies to koshka and Celeste who have high base damage on their abilities.   This isn't a hard and set rule, more like a situational tool to keep in your arsenal if you ever need some small edge against a specific comp. you can play around with a few small tweaks to your build like this once you're comfortable with your hero and regular build."
vainglorygame,3d8zok,Glory_DrEvil,6,Tue Jul 14 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"I recently built Aegis against Taka, Fortress, Vox. Taka and Vox were both building WP, but I knew that I needed to keep my life sustained through the initial engage burst damage they would throw out. Once I had finished my Aegis, Taka would jump me, A skill, then run away because I was still at a healthy life total. Then I'd build my BP against Fortress, and then 1v3."

vainglorygame,3d8zok,Kraken_SEMC,3,Tue Jul 14 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"In my experience (Decent-ish Gold player, so take my words with a grain of salt) it's best to build against what your opponent builds. I don't care how much Taka (or whoever else) uses their abilities, if they go full weapon and you have no armor, those basic attacks are going to hit like a mack truck that learned how to fly at mach speeds.  Perhaps I'm being a bit hyperbolic, but it gets the point across. :p"
vainglorygame,3d8zok,Audiencefone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:13:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if you're squishy you need shield especially against taka early game or he will pop out and erase you while you're desperately trying to reach your turret."
vainglorygame,3d8zok,zquid,2,Tue Jul 14 23:48:33 2015 UTC,"I've played a ton of WP Taka. I've also played against a ton of WP Takas. If you build an Aegis, WP Taka will have a much harder time deleting you. The scariest thing about WP Taka is 1000+ damage (raw) that comes from an X-Restu / Kaiten combo. He just uses his weapons to finish you off.  In other words, if Taka can't get your health low enough from his initial burst, he's too squishy to stand toe-to-toe for very long and he'll have to abort the assassination attempt.  Twirling Silver has a 70% crystal ratio, meaning that while Twirling Silver is active 70% of your crystal power gets applied to the damage of your basic attacks. This bonus damage counts as crystal damage while the rest of the damage will be counted as weapon damage."
vainglorygame,3d8zok,jklick,2,Tue Jul 14 16:54:12 2015 UTC,Finally understand Twirling Silver. Also confirmed my hunch on building shield against Taka. You da man!
vainglorygame,3d8zok,srgjager,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"To further complicate things: crystal damage is often more bursty than weapon power. Not a huge factor, but it can tip the scale in some situations.  In my experience, I tend to have a slight preference for shield. Part of the reason for this is Fountain and Aegis.  I haven't done this rigorously but, to get a better feel for the sources of damage you'll encounter in game, just study the ability descriptions, looking for weapon/crystal ability damage, level of base damage and CP/WP ratios. The most important info would be whether the base damage is high.  Lastly, I'm pretty sure every ability does crystal damage unless otherwise specified. So Ringo's twirling silver keeps the weapon damage on each shot but adds crystal damage on top while the buff is active."
vainglorygame,3d8zok,glStelar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:24:24 2015 UTC,"Building shield/armor against crystal/weapon is okay but not good enough to fight against good opponents. Many players now buy piercing items so your shield/armor won't work very well. For Taka, Krul, and even Ringo, you might need Atlas to slow down their attack speed, even if they go crystal. Also larger health will give you more advantages than just shield/armor."
vainglorygame,3d8zok,wztprivate,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that Aegis also gives some armor and health, so it's not a complete waste against other types of damage that comes in."

The only advice I can give is to try and play very simple heroes until you are confident in playing through the lag.

Once you feel more comfortable playing with interrupting lag, upgrade to a slightly more advanced hero, such as Ringo. Ad infinitum."

vainglorygame,3d8tso,mono-olli,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:36:16 2015 UTC,Do you skip Warhorn and otherwise follow the build? I was playing Catherine with the Unbreakable build and it was really great to see your post!
vainglorygame,3d8tso,glStelar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:13 2015 UTC,"Good description.   I would add that Fortress can also do some soft crowd control by distracting the enemy with his wolves and by using his move speed to move in and out of combat and around enemies strategically.  While Fortress's main strength is accelerating things with speed buffs and more damage, Catherine incapacitates the enemy team through stuns and silences (and her damage reflection)."
vainglorygame,3d8tso,Kraken_SEMC,4,Tue Jul 14 18:14:18 2015 UTC,I think Catherine is pretty much at the top of the meta right now for support.
vainglorygame,3d8tso,RuhRoh235,3,Tue Jul 14 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"Ardan, Fortress, and Cath are all very good. I play fortress. The more important point is how you build your support. It pains me when I see supports which have picked items which do not actually help the team.  Generally, I think fountain of renewal is a must and I rush one."

vainglorygame,3d8tso,addinsolent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"Your typical supports are going to be Catherine, Fortress, Ardan and Adagio, though you may see Joule or Glaive, and maybe even a koshka, though her tank capabilities have been nerfed and is not as viable.   I would say the most important thing is finding good synergy between your support and jungler and to some extent, laner. You are going to be supporting your jungler most, so I think its more important to work on the synergy there.   I like Adagio and Cath with Taka right now, though I used to prefer Ardan with Taka. I see Taka paired a lot with fortress too, which gives Taka a stronger early game, though I don't like their synergy as much late game, imo.   I like Catherine paired with just about any jungler right now, though especially if they also have a stun (Koshka, glaive, Joule). Stun lock is real.   Fortress is really great with Koshka, I also like Adagio here too.   With Rona I like Fortress or Ardan.   Krul - Adagio or Catherine. Used to play a lot of Ardan with this pair but he has fallen off in the 1.6 meta."
vainglorygame,3d8tso,paredesacc,0,Tue Jul 14 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"Why don't people recommend Ardan anymore?   All you need to do is rush warhorn, then counter build defense.  Before the last update I climbed to PG with Ardan easily."

vainglorygame,3d963y,kaivorb,10,Tue Jul 14 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"Answer 1  You do not need IGC to get gold for an assist. Any player who is involved in the kill of an enemy hero will receive a lesser portion of gold, even if you died just prior to the kill being completed.  Answer 2  The base gold for a kill is 30 gold plus 15 gold per level of the enemy. That means a level 1 hero kill gives 45 gold and a level 12 hero kill gives 180 gold.  If the opponent you kill is on a kill streak - i.e. killed multiple allies without dying in between - you get a bonus of 50g for each kill in the kill streak, minus 1. As an example, if you kill an opponent who was on a a 5 kill streak, you would get a bonus 200 gold. This is a nice mechanic of the game because if your team is getting beat up really badly and you manage to ace the other team, there's often a lot of bonus gold for ending their kill streaks, allowing you to catch up a bit.  Lastly, if you are on a kill streak, you get progressively less gold for every kill. The first two kills in a streak are full gold. After that, each progressive kill gets 85% less gold. On the third kill of a streak, you'll get 85% of the base gold. On the fourth, you would get another 85% reduction, giving 72% of the base gold (85% * 85%). On the fifth, you would get 61% of the base gold (85% * 85% * 85%). And so on. This is another game mechanic that is meant to help out the underdog team by minimizing snowballing during kill streaks."

Unfortunately, for new players it will always be a big stumbling block and a source of frustration.  I know that SEMC has taken steps to improve it, and it is better than when it was originally implemented, but it seems like more steps need to be taken.  Here are some further potential improvements:   Add a contract icon next to the gold pop up when being awarded gold from the contract. Have a mandatory tutorial at the start of the game that teaches players how to use this item. When purchasing items from the shop, find space to show your teammates items, possibly even highlighting contracts to bring extra attention to them. Call out how much gold you've earned from the contract somewhere in the UI, even if you don't own the contract. Somehow make the icon and description more clear that this item requires teamwork (for example, call it the ""Buddy Contract"" or ""Gold Harvester"" or something better that what I can come up with in 10 seconds) Any time someone purchases a support item (Contract, Fountain, Crucible, etc), your whole team is notified with voice over. League of Legends does this and it's pretty helpful.   All Many of these are design band-aids though, and as painful as it may be, the best route might be to scrap the Ironguard Contract and replace it with a more straight forward support item. Sadly, I can't think of anything at the moment that would fill this need in the game while incorporating the same amount of teamwork.

vainglorygame,3d5559,Audiencefone,5,Mon Jul 13 16:34:16 2015 UTC,"I was astonished by the response my Vainglory-inspired set of Hearthstone cards received (Vol. 1 Available here). You all came by to have a look, and many of you decided to stay and talk about them. You told me what you liked, what you thought I did wrong, and suggested things of your own.     One person even went off and created a Pokémon variant of Vainglory heroes. That was pretty awesome to look through.    I said that I'd do it all again when it made sense. Well, I recently had to download a few programs from Adobe. I figured that while I had the 1-month trials was as good a time as any to revise the set. It also gave me the chance to add in Rona, the Kraken (as requested) and revise some stats and abilities.    Thank you for reading through and looking at the set. It's be great fun to work on and explore new options for these cards. I'd love to hear what you have to say about these, even though I don't think I'll be putting out a vol.3 for some time. :p  EDIT: On a request, the following is a list of changes from Hearthvain vol.1.   General:    Updated graphics. I had got some design programs through a 30-day trial and made use of them. I hated the way the old set was just the cards in imgur. Now we get to look at the Halcyon Fold at the same time and I got to use the Northwood High font!  Added Rona, The Kraken, and Skaarf's token spell Spitfire.   Heroes:    Adagio gained +1 Attack on account of how much damage he can put out if he builds attack or crystal. Placed in the Priest class due to his ability to heal and aid other minions. Ardan was modified based on some feedback from the first set. He recieved some well-deserved criticism for having lower health and being overall 'meh'. He now has more health, his battlecry now gives Charge in addition to Divine Shield, and he costs a whole lot more. I gave him the Paladin class on account of his ability to protect allies. Catherine got a slight buff in stats (+1/+1) and nerf on the Freeze ability (it now only takes effect when SHE attacks. Not when she deals damage). Her mana cost was also raised by one, because she is insanely good. Celeste was completely redone. I didn't like her old ability. Now, she creates minions (Heliogenesis) for the oppenent. She can either attack them and deal limited AOE damage or attack the face. Her spell damage increase was inspired by the fact Celeste is an excellent glass cannon, and her spells hit hard. I figured that the player's spells should hit hard if she's in play. I gave her the Mage class because, well, she's a mage. Fortress was mad a Druid card, which made complete sense when I did it, because it allows you to choose the style of play you want from Fortress. Either you can charge in with some extra damage to help out offensively (Truth of the Tooth) or you can summon a pack of wolves that deal bleeding damage (Attack of the Pack). Glaive is unchanged aside from his ability. Now, his turn-1 attack vs. a minion doesn't deal damage, but acts as a Sap. It just puts the minion back in the opponent's hand. No damage is dealt. That might be hurtful in some scenarios, but in others it might heavily set back your opponent. You can always go face, though. I gave Glaive the Warrior class because he's an axe-toting cat. It just screamed warrior. Joule got a nerf/buff. She gained +1 Attack in Vol. 2 and lost her AOE battlecry. Now, instead, she gains a potential to deal 2 more damage when you use a spell (my variation on her potential for her B to hit critical strikes). I gave her the Shaman class because of her ability. Shamans have a lot of 50% or a range of damages.  Koshka...this one is tough to work with. I didn't want another AOE mechanic (I already made so many), so I chose to reference her Pouncy Fun (Charge) and her passive Bloodrush (+1/+1 after dealing damage. The effect is almost the same as it was in Vol.1, but she's been buffed from a 4/2 to a 6/4 and costs a bit more. I gave her the hunter class because she fits the flavor–as I understand her she believes herself to be nearly the same as a cat, and Hunters have lots of Beast synergy. I briefly considered giving her some beast synergy, but it just didn't make sense looking at Vainglory. Krul now heals the hero rather than himself, and gained 1 Health to compensate. Now, though, you have to discard a card when you are healed by Krul's effect. It's the trade-off for his great stats combined with that ability. Since that effect already belongs to a Warlock minion (Mistress of Pain) and he's a zombie, I put him in the Warlock class. Vol.1 Petal was OP. She showed up and instantly had 3 Munions (arguably better Boom Bots). I nerfed her. She lost 1 attack, and the munions come on your next turn (she has to plant the seeds first!). I put her in the shaman class because Shamans are built to empower lots of minions and fill their board. Petal fills the board pretty darn well. Ringo was fixed, as his ability (a reference to his passive that builds crits on kills) added too much damage to his attacks. It was reduced from +5 to +2. His cost was also lowered by 1, and he was given a 2-damage combo ability (I think of it as Achilles Shot). He was given the Rogue class due to his Combo effect, as well as his art. Gunslingers seem to fit the rogue archetype in my mind. Rona's a new addition. Her abilities encourage her to keep in combat (as her Berserker's Fury encourages it) and her additional AOE damage is a reference to the A and C abilities she has. She was given the Warrior class because she's a berserker. That's just French for ""badass warrior who gives no fucks"". (Disclaimer: I don't speak French). SAW was kept the same. He was given the Warrior class due to his Enrage ability and high damage potential. Skaarf was redone. Instead of burning enemies himself, you now get two token spells to cast that do it. He enables you to cast them a bit easier as well. His cost was also raised by 1. He's a Mage because he's a mage.  Taka was given -1/-1 and lost his inability to be targeted by spells and hero powers. In exchange, he gains a combo ability that takes him out of stealth and destroys an undamaged enemy minion. I gave him the Rogue class on account of Stealth and Combo abilities. Vox is also unchanged aside from his placement into the Mage class. I put him there due to his resonance, passive damage bonus from crystal power, and Vainglory classification as a mage.   Tokens/Neutral Cards:    Heliogenesis and Spitfire make their debut. Both are token cards from Celeste and Skaarf, respectively, encouraging new ways of combat and making references to each heroes' abilities in Vainglory. Reworded the feral wolf's card text. No change in what it does. The Munions now randomly deal their damage (1 at a time) if they are not killed by a minion. The Kraken makes its debut! It's been designed around its inability to attack players (I imagine it would see minions with Taunt as some form of turret, though...) and the fact it's easier to get when more players are working on it (it's cost reduction)."

vainglorygame,3d5559,WhatsEngrish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"The card already had a lot of text. I'm not sure if The Kraken could have that additional effect. Besides, as a Hearthstone player, I wouldn't want a card like that (though I likely wouldn't want The Kraken as it is now either...)  Interesting idea, though.  Thanks, and I'm glad you enjoyed the update! As for working with the existing cards, I run into a few problems.   Getting the art. It's not really anywhere (that I notice on a quick glance) on Google, and I don't have a way to screencap my ipad. They have no traits, just flavor text. Turning such a thing into a playing card that interacted with various characters would be difficult. I'd basically have to make up new values and abilities.  Knowing my history, if I had all the art, I'd probobly try to make them all spells. But then what do you do with so many cards that have values such as ""OONTZ OONTZ"" (Koshka legendary card)? Well, I'd probobly ignore Hearthstone all together and go into Illustrator/Photoshop and make my own card game/rules. I've done it before. Weeks later (again, assuming I had the art and a version of these programs that didn't run out in a few weeks) I'd be posting a brand new card game with an eight-page ruleset. with enough content to be diverse and playable.   Dammit. Now I want to do that."

Yea I didn't think about the fact that the art for the cards isn't really just that easy to get...it would be really nice if the devs gave you some of this art so we could get this game going lol"
vainglorygame,3d89cu,Lensjo,6,Tue Jul 14 07:39:20 2015 UTC,"Stun/Silence with burst. A coordinated Catherine-Joule combo will make Krul their b%tch.  The whole team should target Krul when he gets stunned/silenced. You'll realize how fragile he is.   Denying farm and eating up his farm helps too. Once Krul finishes his build, it's extremely hard to stop him.  Atlas Pauldron is another item that is universally great against Krul. If you have encountered those crazy stutter-stepping Kruls, you know what I mean.  Either you or your support should rush AP. Makes a BIG difference.  Always have your sprint boots ready. Sometimes you won't have any other option but to run away. It's great to have an escape option when you enter a fight. Also know that Krul has no legit escape option except for boots.  It's also very useful if you make Krul switch targets during fight. If you are getting high on his stacks, just run away with your escape options. Don't wait to get max stacks though. He will have to start from scratch and start building stacks on someone's else. The point is, don't let him focus one person.   Keep good vision of bushes with flares and mines. A Krul initiating with his heroic+Shiversteel is a pain in the ass.   Against BP Krul, disengage if the battle is prolonging. Unless you are really sure you can kill him and get an ace. With enough BP stacks, a Krul with little health can take your team down. His each hit will be like a meteor and you are only making him stronger. Let him lose his BP stacks and then get back on him and he is dead.  If someone manages to Shiversteel him, it gets easier for a ranged carry to kite him to death. Kiting is another very effective thing against Krul. If he can't get his hands on you, he is good for nothing."

vainglorygame,3d89cu,VGFierte,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"One addition I can make is simply: scout traps. Proper placement and baiting of Krul onto scout trap(s) can absolutely turn around early-to-mid game fights with him, and as was already mentioned, destroying Krul's already weak early game is a great method for countering him. I've even found that even during fights you can drop a scout trap in front of his face and get him to activate it merely because Krul believes the damage isn't a deterrent enough for his undead hands. My experience says that he SHOULD have been turned away, but that respawn clock says ""Tsk-tsk."""

Celeste can do that but you need to be at a high range and accurate, so it's hard. Taka needs to use X-Retsu and Kaku immediately and then vanish to run away and wait for Krul's lifesteal thing to wear off. Stay near Krul so you can keep up the damage once his stacks lessen. Catherine has an easy time fighting him because all of her skills directly counter Krul. Stun, shield/burn, silence."

vainglorygame,3d5xvf,iwanttobeadog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:05:56 2015 UTC,"No, because that's common vernacular and widely accepted. 'Gonna' is in the dictionary and perfectly sound grammatically."

vainglorygame,3d5xvf,iwanttobeadog,3,Tue Jul 14 05:00:08 2015 UTC,So her name is Skye and she wears a pilot's uniform and uses some kinda mech armor suit thing. I'll be so disappointed if one of her abilities doesnt turn (part of) her into a jet of some kind. even the legs pieces looks like the wings of a plane.
vainglorygame,3d5xvf,BlueDmon,2,Mon Jul 13 22:25:52 2015 UTC,"Dammit, I shouldn't have bought Rona. She's pretty terrible right now, really needs a buff of some sort. I main Joule so I'll probably enjoy using Skye too."
vainglorygame,3d5xvf,devlindisguise,2,Tue Jul 14 01:39:03 2015 UTC,The first thing I noticed is that she has no harness. Her only interface with the suit is her hands and feet.   I winder if she will have some extra-vehicular abilities.
vainglorygame,3d5xvf,xmaveric,3,Tue Jul 14 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a hater, but...meh. Second hero in a row that looks closer to a skin of an existing hero than like something completely new. Really hoping her kit has something new and creative."
vainglorygame,3d5xvf,thenamestsam,7,Mon Jul 13 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"rona=skin of glaive. He just had to take off his old skin first, and suddenly it became a woman that stole some of his throwing axes. Flawless."
vainglorygame,3d5xvf,LokiaScythe,4,Mon Jul 13 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"Not really sure how you think Rona looks like a skin... I mean her and Glaive both uses axes, but that's still quite a stretch.   This one reminds me of Joule, but looks pretty dramatically different. This is like a suit, whereas Joule's mech is a mount."
vainglorygame,3d5xvf,jatatcdc,2,Mon Jul 13 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm obviously exaggerating somewhat, but for Rona it's not just that they both use axes. They're both WP based, melee junglers that are very strong in close proximity, but extremely kiteable, have an A that's a dash plus CC, and a C that's a twirling ball of death. Oh and they both use axes. Also I can't help but point out that I didn't have to say it was Glaive for everyone to know exactly what hero I was thinking it was a skin for.   Like I said, maybe I'm a hater, but for a game with <25 heroes, my expectation was to see the bounds pushed a lot farther with each new hero. Those expectations were met with Vox and Fortress, and maybe they still will be when we see more of Skye's kit, animations, etc. But for now, I'm sticking with meh."

Buy crucible to help keep your time alive and block stuns.  I rush fountain, then crucible. Then i buy contraption or sometimes atlas pouldron depending on what the enemy is building. At the end i buy shiversteel or warhorn. And of course, don't forget to upgrade your boots regulary.  Learn how to use IGC. it is more convenient to jungle togehter."
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,Lensjo,4,Mon Jul 13 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"Good advice.  I always rush fountain, but either go Clockwork or Crucible next.  It's completely situational though, if they have a good Taka I'll go Contraption.  If my jungler doesn't know how to ICG I'll rush warhorn.  I also think it's important to get her ability cooldowns low, because her stun is one of the most amazing abilities in the game."
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,Come_on-Man,3,Tue Jul 14 00:27:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is how it's done. Versus taka, always buy contraption"
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,Lensjo,2,Tue Jul 14 07:35:58 2015 UTC,/agree
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,Kraken_SEMC,5,Tue Jul 14 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"Remember that k/d ratio isn't so important with Catherine since she is a support. I don't know how you play, but since you are playing as a support your main role is to assist your team team members.  So try to never be alone, stick with the jungler unless the laner needs assistance.   Oh and stun and silent the shit out of the enemy xd."
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,ogurin,3,Mon Jul 13 23:36:30 2015 UTC,"Didn't see your build there first.  Try get clockwork and aftershock and also the eye of harvest. The eye of harvest will basically make your shield heal, clockwork for obvious reasons, aftershock is almost like a combo of the clock/eye.   The fountain is really good. Keep it, don't think you need two tho but haven't tried it before.   Once you are 12 or your jungle/lane partner is 12 I usually drop the iron guard contract/banner in favor for more defense or offense, or upgrade it for a warhorn if I notice we need more mobility in the team."
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,ogurin,2,Mon Jul 13 23:48:16 2015 UTC,Ooooh. I've never tried building her with crystal. I'll have to try that.
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,mcdeezel,5,Mon Jul 13 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"I'd refrain against building eve of harvest unless your team is way ahead. It is fairly expensive and not all that useful for a support build. Aftershock is good as an offensive item, but I would first focus on building at least 2 tier 3 defensive items to support your team (fountain, crucible, atlas, shiver).   In the particular game you posted, I'd suggest an atlas pauldron instead of the aegis. The atlas would greatly cripple Taka and Adagio.  As far as gameplay, try and stun their main damage dealer and stun heroes out of their ults. Another useful stun scenario is for when the enemy is diving your main damage dealer. Also, only use your shield if someone is actually attacking you.  Good luck!"
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,ogurin,2,Tue Jul 14 00:34:48 2015 UTC,Don't forget to boost her health and eventual defense tho ;)
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,ogurin,3,Tue Jul 14 00:13:24 2015 UTC,The reason I mention k/d is that im starting to spend less time reviving and more time stunning. Armor stacks son!
vainglorygame,3d6ov9,LokiaScythe,3,Mon Jul 13 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's good to try reach a high stack of those. Combined with defensive items it can make you really hard to kill."
vainglorygame,3d6tzc,Worst_Kha_NA,4,Mon Jul 13 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"Unless you are going to prevent a full jungle takeover (or helping make that happen), or preventing (or causing) and Ace, it's best to farm IMO."
vainglorygame,3d6tzc,Kraken_SEMC,2,Mon Jul 13 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"It's tricky to find the right balance of fighting and farming, especially early. It sounds like you're talking from a laners perspective, so I'll offer my opinion at least.   What I like to do personally is try to rotate as much as possible early, and participate in every fight that breaks out jungle vs jungle. If you can get there before the other laner, your team should win the 3v2. Once you've done that enough, your jungle will be ahead of them and will be able to 2v2 and win without you, allowing you to focus more on farming. However, fighting to try to steal jungle camps is different than fighting just to fight. If your guys are fighting just for no reason at all, ping then to back off so you can all go back to farming- that's what's important early on. As a final note, when invading the enemy jungle (assuming you're chasing or you won a fight) it's perfectly fine to take some of the jungle minions in place of those you're missing in lane from your rotation, hopefully your junglers will understand."
vainglorygame,3d6tzc,Jajajack14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:21:57 2015 UTC,"From a jungler's perspective, I really love laners who help out in early fights, but obviously I want him to farm his/her lane more so than fight in the jungle. I'd also say that if the other laner is MIA, get down there immediately, and that map awareness and communication are key: the laner should take a look at the fight regardless to evaluate if he/she should engage, and should ping what they are doing. Likewise, the jungle can certainly glance at the map and decide if they think their laner can/should help and ping their desire. Mistakes will be made. But the teams that play smart, and more importantly, play together, tend to... win. :) Edit: Clarity improved and grammar errors removed"

vainglorygame,3d4jvu,asamr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:15:21 2015 UTC,It is called Stutter stepping. Look it up its Very important in MOBA's. In this game it's important to improve you positioning so you move between attacks. It also slightly improves your attacking speed. Good luck.

If they cast spells, crystal. Realistic physical stuff, weapon! The third row, first item is the highest raw power in there. Btw, that trait of clicking everywhere a million times is either ADHD, Stutter-stepping(/orbwalking/kiting) which slightly increases attackspeed (only in vainglory) by removing the unnecessary animations after the damage is fired off, and also allows you to move until your attack is ready to play it's animation for another hit again, or it's an old habit from the RTS days where everything needs to be clicked constantly. It's basically getting warmed up and allows you to be more precise/slightly unpredictable when going somewhere, but only until you feel satisfied with how you'll pathfind. Blahblahblah...meow P.S. Once you're really used to stutterstepping with both melee and ranged people you can probably consistently start the animation and literally stop it RIGHT as the hit registers as fired and get a pretty noticable boost out of it while looking like you're not actually attacking/glitching :P"

vainglorygame,3d82dg,juanplusjuan,7,Tue Jul 14 06:14:35 2015 UTC,"My best advice is to play her like her description; an assassin. Most people make the mistake of leaping into combat as the initiator, but in reality she's too squishy for that. Wait for someone else to initiate, then leap in, do your damage, and get away.   Stay close, close enough that you can still jump back into the fight with your A ability, and pick off enemies who are low and/or running away. Koshka is not meant to soak up damage, even if you build her with defensive items."
vainglorygame,3d82dg,Okami_G,2,Tue Jul 14 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"When I play Koshka I normally build boots, 3-4 CP items, and 1-2 defensive items depending on the comp I'm facing.  The CP items I normally choose from are Aftershock and then a combination of Eve/BM/Shatter.  I see enemy Koshkas building a Clockwork a lot of the time, but I feel that it is unnecessary since you can normally get 2-3 rounds of cooldowns off before you have to back out just from hitting stuff.  When the support and I are heading to lane or an objective like to always have at least one stack from Twirly Death's passive, so my next attack after jumping in hits harder.  Plus if you pair this with having Aftershock's effect active then you can really chunk out the enemy laner or jungler to half health depending on the point in the game.  Using Yummy Catnip Frenzy really depends on your support.  With Cath/Ardan/Glaive, wait for them to initiate while you'll probably want to initiate with Adagio/Fortress.  Krul/Vox can be either one of you since the other can follow up.  Also don't be afraid to use your ult to save your laner if they get jumped on by someone.  Doing that has turned a team fight around for myself many times."
vainglorygame,3d82dg,Koozaza,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:09:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe my way of playing her is not optimal (still, I do very fine at SA with her), but I often find her almost more effective late game. Maybe it has something to do with how I build her... I usually get an Aftershock pretty quickly, building t1 boots and starting t1 or t2 of some defensive items most often. Once I have Aftershock I'll complete at least one defensive item, probably two, and then add a bit of CP.  I see many people successfully playing her with very agressive builds though. Those absolutely need to be played very assassin-style."
vainglorygame,3d82dg,glStelar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"Koshka is extremely viable late-game, but on CP heavy builds (which I highly endorse) she tends to gather a lot of focus in that late game. This is typically because she's squishy but everyone in the game has realized the damage she's dealing. Just by playing with more, for lack of better words, ""ebb and flow"" (jump in, run away, re-engage, etc), Koshka can still deal horrific amounts of damage but cannot be focused because she simply is not present at the moment."

vainglorygame,3d645k,Twiggled,4,Mon Jul 13 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"The difference is you can't prevent your lane minions from wandering off and dying to the enemy laner, so they are getting experience and gold, eventually. However, the 2v1 situation could result in your jungler not getting any gold or experience. Then this becomes problematic.  I recently played against a comp that tried running a 2v1 lane against us. I marched into the enemy jungle, pushed their jungler out at level 1, and took his farm. All the while my laner was doing his best to farm safely under turret. He was a lane Glaive against Adagio and Skaarf, so it wasn't the easiest situation, but he came out WAY ahead."
vainglorygame,3d645k,adyendrus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"^ This.   Vainglory is a numbers game. The team with the most gold gets the biggest guns. Those who have the biggest guns often win. All jungle camps are neutral and can be taken by either team. If one team gets a larger portion of the jungle camps, then that team has more gold (and experience) as a result of it.  Additionally, control of the jungle effects your ability to go to the jungle shop. If you don't feel the jungle is safe, then you have to teleport back to base, which takes more time away from you farming.  Additionally, if you don't feel safe in your jungle, the other team will probably control the gold mine as well.  The reality is that most any laner who is worth their salt should be able to sit under his tower in a 2v1 lane and time their last hits between tower shots, thus getting plenty of farm and experience while preventing the tower from going down."

vainglorygame,3d645k,Kraken_SEMC,3,Mon Jul 13 22:58:33 2015 UTC,This. It's also really only theoretically viable if you have a solo jungler that has great escape and superior clear speed.

vainglorygame,3d645k,lcpdragonslayer,3,Mon Jul 13 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"You need the support person in jungle in case yours gets raided. The laner can fall back on the turret. Your jungler can't. Once the opposing team sees two people in lane they will come charging into your jungle and force your jungler out, so you end up with one support laner getting crap gold and your jungler can't jungle safely without getting ganked."
vainglorygame,3d645k,Ares-2,2,Tue Jul 14 10:00:58 2015 UTC,"A good laner (SA+) can get 90cs in 10min and a jungler 60. That's 3600 gold in lane and 2400 in the jungle.   with 1cs = 40 gold Lane sup. 3600+1080+2400 = 7080 Jungle sup. 3600+ 1200+ 3000 = 7800 your team has less gold and your junlge can get invaded. keep in mind, that an average laner will get less cs. In most low-mid elo matches the laner gets out farmed by the jungler."
vainglorygame,3d645k,kaivorb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say I somewhat support this. At least at he lower ranks. Not all of us get to play at the high ranks where all 3 'mates are intelligent and know the game. Sometimes in the lower dregs this could be a very viable option.   Playing Catherine I'm sometimes supporting a very weak jungler. One who rushes and dies despite my best efforts to rein them in or save them when that doesn't work. Since as a Cath I don't have a ton of offense and if my jungler isn't worth supporting, then I'll go and support Lane. Keep them alive. Drop mines in all bushes. Stun any incoming attacks. We have to forgo jungle gold but the third teammate kind of made that a foregone conclusion anyway.   So if I can support Lane w Cath, then why not a stronger offensive one too. It's not meta, but in the dreg ranks, most people seem to scoff at the idea anyway.   Just a thought since I don't always get to play the way I want to anyway. 😉"
vainglorygame,3d645k,peterkeats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:47:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I used to love jungling alone. With Joule especially. She clears it fast and gets to level 6 fast alone. Not as fast as with a jungle support, but jungle minions only respawn so fast.   Anyways, I've seen dual laners work our pretty well. One laner tends to starve, though, even with IGC. They always end up In the jungle. The Lane doesn't seem to have enough gold for two. Unless you can get an early turret.   I also see jungle supports spend most of their time in the lane (usually Catherine) and their games end up okay.   So, Lane support might work. It requires a good solo jungler, and good coordination among teammates."

I honestly do pretty well. Last game I actually ended up carrying instead of supporting somehow. Of course, sometimes I end up being the laner this way, because the person who would normally be laning is... I don't even know.  I'm sure I'll have to switch my strategy later on, but for now I'm doing well, and having fun."
vainglorygame,3d645k,fmaBlots,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:03:32 2015 UTC,"For such a drastic change in the meta you'd have to find a way of making 2 lane 1 jungle more beneficial than 1 lane 2 jungle. If you can't make it drastically better the change will never happen.  With junglers like Taka and Krul they basically have to be babysat. You pull experience from your laner (he's supposed to be ahead, so he puts more pressure in roams) and pull away pressure from objectives (gold mine, minion mine).   There's nothing beneficial about 2 laners at the moment. The reasoning behind this is even though you may have a chance of setting their laner back, that's not nearly as bad as setting a jungler behind.   The 2v1 would make the other jungler have virtually no farm, when you only have potential of setting their laner back. All the laner has to do is play safe, maybe even go book for the poke."
vainglorygame,3d645k,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:57:26 2015 UTC,"I think double lane is just too easily countered, especially depending on how the other team's laner is. Take three games I played yesterday as an example (idk why, I just met a bunch of double laners yesterday)  1: I was playing Joule, had a support fortress and an amazing Adagio laner. The Adagio was great at playing cautiously. He didn't advance far from our turret and mainly just protected the turret. I don't know if he got that much gold, but he certainly did very well protecting the turret. We would take our far jungle camps and then invade immediately. Even though we couldn't completely prevent their Taka from getting minions, we got in the way of his farming a lot, stole some kills, and killed him a couple times. We ended up completely destroying them.  2: I was playing lane petal, which I'd say I do pretty well with. I also just stayed by my turret and planted seeds, but I'm also pretty good at getting last hits. As such, I came out quite ahead. The problem was, my junglers didn't really get what my ""target"" pings in the enemy jungle meant. They didn't really invade, and the enemy's jungler (I think it was a joule) got pretty fed. However, my junglers did pretty well and farmed a lot, so we ended up ahead (I was making a lot of money, my junglers had decent amounts, whereas their Joule had a lot of money, and their laners were being starved of kills.) As such, we still won.  3: We had a vox in lane, and I was playing joule with a fortress again. The vox didn't really know how to work against a double lane. He overextended often and had to ping for help a lot. As such, we couldn't invade, and even worse, we couldn't even farm our own jungle well. We were completely crushed in this game.  So, the main problem is that you'll put your jungler in a lot of danger and starve yourselves. The only bonus is that you have more of a chance of pushing the enemy laner away, but this isn't that useful, since if you're close to his turret, it becomes a pretty even fight. Plus, if the enemy's laner is at all smart, you're quite easily countered."

vainglorygame,3d3e1g,UniqueRaj,3,Mon Jul 13 14:41:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for this!   I normally encounter Tank BP Krul a lot.   In that case, should I go for a Bonesaw to get his armor down if I have a WP Teammate or an aftershock to chunk out some of his HP?   Note : This is after buying an Atlas.   Also, what about Energy? Do I need to get a clockwork in every game?"
vainglorygame,3d3e1g,KarmaAdjuster,3,Mon Jul 13 11:13:43 2015 UTC,"I have noticed BP Kruls to be harder to beat, but you have to rely on your teammates to dish out most of the damage. Best thing for you to do as Fortress is to apply your bleeding to him and try and max the stacks to get the mortal wound and to cut his healing. Never let Krul stay in the fight for a log time, as that's BPs power.  Bonesaw will help you cut his armor down, because BP Krul is usually building lots of defense. I find it works best with teammates like Vox or Ringo.  Aftershock helps with the energy issue if that's your preference.  I don't find a need to buy clockwork. If you don't waste your abilities in the late game on minions, try to stay cryatal infused, and steal the kraken or get the ace buff, you'll not have energy issues. Don't be afraid to recall and have your team meat up by your turrets.   It really helps when your teammates help you take advantage of your movement speed buff. I've noticed more people will come back or wait for me so I can run with them and get ahead."

vainglorygame,3d3e1g,fmaBlots,2,Tue Jul 14 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"No problem!  I've been trying out aftershock a lot more lately just to test the burst out. If I do go aftershock, i wait to get blazing salvo or anything else until it's complete. I've been enjoying aftershock a lot more and may be making that my priority item.   Also, Shiversteel is really good on him too! I'd recommend that against fast opponents like Taka, Koshka, vox, or Ringo. It works well against Krul too, caus it allows you to run away when neccesary."

vainglorygame,3d4rb9,1996chaos,6,Mon Jul 13 14:50:24 2015 UTC,"I solo Q'ed to POA (tier 9).   Biggest help for me was adapting to teammates style (eg aggressive vs passive, your support isn't building fountain --> build your own fountain, support isn't creating vision --> create your own vision, support isn't building atlas pauldron vs an enemy Breaking Point krul --> build atlas pauldron asap). Even if you think their strategy is suboptimal, oftentimes the best option is to go with the flow.   Try to coordinate as best you can with pings and DO NOT feed/become the troll by overpinging. Map awareness is crucial. Fast jungle rotations early game can help you steamroll and gank weaker and slower enemies.  Watching high ELO (POA or VG tier) streamers that play RANKED games and talk to viewers or their teammates about strategy. My favorites are foojee [he hasn't been streaming lately ): ], xenotec, etc. I don't get anything out of watching viewer games so I skip over those streamers.  I was stuck in SA (tier 8) for a long time. Once I started to play support when other teammates were adamantly soft locking jungle/lane carries, I got to POA.

vainglorygame,3d4rb9,ChapterLiam,0,Tue Jul 14 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"For Taka, you want a mixed build. Rush Tornado Trigger or Aftershock, both are amazing for Taka. After either, get the other + slowly build Lifespring and boots. After all four, you should get Tension Bow/Shatterglass/Clockwork/Sorrowblade. You will live in the brush, and make sure your Ki stacks never dissapear. Early game, you will target your entire half of the jungle strictly. Do not fight Glaive or Krul if they are your opponents in the Jungle early game, unless Fortress or Cath is your support. Use your BSkill to keep your stacks up. Utilize the bush around the Gold Mine, right next to the front turrets to ambush squishy laners. Celeste, Vox, and Skaarf are all perfect targets before they can get Armor and Shield. Ringo is a risk because of his slow skill, and he can turn around and destroy you before you have X-Retsu available. Catherine, Krul, and Glaive are your nightmares. Do not engage them 1v1. Really, you could 1v1 Glaive but only if he's last-alive. Don't try to do it with his team up. It's really just too risky. And, yes, Taka can Turret Dive, but only if you have X-Retsu available. And remember X-Retsu has a DoT on it, so don't preemptively turret dive. Kaku can be used to turret dive but it's not as reliable. TL;DR: Ambush. Build a mixed build with Boots and Fountain of Renewal. Prioritize Tornado Trigger and Aftershock. Use the brush to your advantage. Use BSkill to keep Ki stacks alive. Don't 1v1 Krul, Glaive, or Catherine. Turret Dive with X-Retsu. P.S.: Good teammates are Catherine or Fortress as support, Petal or Ringo in lane. One of the best team comps in this meta, in my opinion, is Taka + Petal + Fortress. Petal is somehow amazing in this most recent update, and Fortress is so good when the player can stay near teammates and initiate team fights properly.

vainglorygame,3d443z,Mcmerk,6,Mon Jul 13 10:55:24 2015 UTC,"This weekend I played a ton of games with GreenRanger with a specific build in mind. If my team has an Adagio I've stopped buying Health unless it gives me a Reflex Block.  This morning I was against tank Fortress, WP Vox, and WP Taka. I built Aegis. Taka can't stand and fight a Krul, any Krul will tell you that. Vox always tries to kite Krul. All three of them had Atlas Pauldron. If Taka's burst from his ultimate and Fortress' bite chunks me to a point where I can't fight, then we lose. All of those abilities are CP. By building Aegis I was able to tank the upfront burst, and even though I was weaker to them in the long run, they would run when they didn't see my health drop immediately. A well-timed Aegis to block (one of the many) Atlas Pauldrons, and I would start building my BP.  I almost always go double Salvo to start now. It's much too efficient for jungle clear times, and shutting down anyone on the other team. I buy tier 1 boots relatively early, because they can be the difference between life and death in the early game.  I wouldn't build Aftershock. In fact, the only CP item I would consider intentionally buying is BrokenMyth. It makes B skill hit for over 1k. You get in combat with the tank for two seconds, then A skill the enemy carry and immediately trigger your B skill. The fight is now 3v2 in your favor and the enemy carry is scratching their head, wondering what happened.  If you need a second offensive item, Bonesaw is probably your best bet. It works great with the lifesteal from B skill. It provides a bit of flat weapon, which otherwise Krul doesn't get in his build.  The real secret to winning is a Weapon Infusion. Buy one the second you hit level 12, or the last team fight of a game you would have otherwise lost.  To quote /u/MrTouchNGo AdyEndrus 2:57 ""Make thyself a bastion of stone, for the power of Breaking Point shall be yours to wield."""
vainglorygame,3d443z,adyendrus,2,Mon Jul 13 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try the BrokenMyth. If you survive the initial burst then you'll have the 3 stacks of it anyways.  Usually I don't buy aftershock and will go more tanky, but I'm really interested to try the BrokenMyth"
vainglorygame,3d443z,Hoppscott,2,Mon Jul 13 21:22:16 2015 UTC,"I very rarely ever buy it. It usually works well when the whole enemy team is buying armor or Atlas, and I'm already durable enough to survive in a fight.  What you do is you tell yourself that you'll play better in the early game, so that you're ahead by so much that a BrokenMyth won't lose you the game. If you don't play it well then buying BrokenMyth is just giving the enemy team ~3000 gold."
vainglorygame,3d443z,adyendrus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:02 2015 UTC,Thank you I must try that I do run with brokenMyth +400hp   Then rest are usually all offensive and boots.   And I can drop anyone I just wondered why I did so poorly in more then 1v1 fights and others do fine. But 1v1 other krul I usually come up on top. I'll have to run these and see thanks again
vainglorygame,3d443z,adyendrus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is I build defensively until I can survive the burst from three people.

vainglorygame,3d443z,Hoppscott,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:11 2015 UTC,Okay and is it worth having 2 breaking point idk if they stack so always ran with one
vainglorygame,3d443z,kaivorb,5,Tue Jul 14 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"I main Krul in SA Silver. I usually have 2 objectives: Get as many stacks on the enemy carry as quickly as possible, Stick around long enough for my breaking point to get going.  To do this I'll typically start by building 2 blazing salvos, and getting boots. Also if the support is not laying scout traps I'll lay some of those down because Krul is weak early game, so if you get invaded it can be bad news.  Once I have the blazing salvos I'll build into a shiversteel which gives you a nice pad of 500 health plus has the slow bonus.  Once I have that I'll buy 1 or 2 tier 1 (or maybe tier 2) defensive items depending on the enemy team. If they are Weapon I'll build armor, if they are Crystal I'll build shield.  After that I'll build breaking point by using one of the blazing salvos.  After that it is all situational. If you need to last longer, build more defense. If you feel like you want more damage I would build an aftershock.    TL;DR  My typical build is Blazing Salvo, Boots, Breaking Point, Shiversteel, Fountain, Atlas Pauldron"
vainglorygame,3d443z,Hoppscott,2,Mon Jul 13 12:44:31 2015 UTC,Thanks. I've been experimenting with Krul builds lately and this is a method I will try. I like it. I got destroyed the other night by a fellow Krul who just built attack speed. And multiple versions of the same item. It frustrated and impressed me. He went through me like a buzz saw.

vainglorygame,3d301i,GEOpdx,3,Mon Jul 13 03:56:41 2015 UTC,Yes Auras would be an amazing idea. Great post
vainglorygame,3d301i,fmaBlots,3,Mon Jul 13 08:38:20 2015 UTC,"The game currently emphasizes active abilities from items to help teammates. As it is, if I want to block an attack on my teammates, or give them a health boost, I have to be near them and it requires more skill.  Different heroes teach different skills. Krul teaches waiting in the bushes and not always engaging the enemy with an ability. Taka teaches how to weave in and out of bushes to lose the enemy. Fortress is the hero who most teaches staying together. That skill can be transferred to other heroes in different contexts.  Edit: This is to say, I don't think those auras would require enough skill as presently defined."
vainglorygame,3d301i,oldboldmold,0,Mon Jul 13 11:45:55 2015 UTC,Coat of Plates really needs a passive that does this. Just providing your allies a nice armor buff while in range of their support.
vainglorygame,3d301i,jatatcdc,4,Mon Jul 13 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"I think the logic with abilities so far seems to avoid the whole just be near someone for a buff.. Seems like it too easy to get a bonus and reduces the skill required for the game. Fortress is the only hero that gets a buff being near someone... Just think about that.  Maybe if they made it an active, so you get the armor buff for x amount of time, it would be more in line with active items in game. Like crucible or fountain that require the right timing to be useful."
vainglorygame,3d301i,Glory_DrEvil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:55:32 2015 UTC,I agree with the active. And it should come at a cost.  Buffing armor for the team results in a similar temporary reduction of weapon speed.  Essentially encouraging support character play over carries buffing the team continually.
vainglorygame,3d301i,yourMOMvg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:49:01 2015 UTC,Right? I feel like the game shall change dramatically when you introduce auras.

vainglorygame,3d3xxp,MrTouchnGo,2,Tue Jul 14 00:20:36 2015 UTC,I agree. Once I got good at last hitting It was easier to rush SB as Ringo. Also getting two two three tier 1 items instead of one tier 2 item first has helped be rush any item.
vainglorygame,3d3xxp,fredandersonsmith,-6,Tue Jul 14 01:54:44 2015 UTC,Because you don't understand TB lol

I don't see any point in building TB when I can finish a Sorrowblade by the time the enemy Ringo is finishing his TB. Hell, even a Heavy Steel and a Six Sins does more damage than Tension Bow over time."
vainglorygame,3d3xxp,MrTouchnGo,-3,Tue Jul 14 03:35:23 2015 UTC,"""condescending"". alright  If you use Tension Bow correctly and efficiently the other Ringo won't even be close to a Sorrow Blade.  If you're winning lane (lets just say you're 1 kill up and you have a strong CS advantage, huge lead) Tension Bow solidifies your lead in the lane. If he's getting Sorrow Blade before you finish Tension Bow, you've fucked up somewhere and are not putting any pressure in the lane and somehow getting out cs'd big time.   Tension Bow does more damage in a trade then Sorrow Blade does, even over time.  Tension Bow Proc -> Auto -> Auto -> Auto still does more than 4 autos of items of an equal gold value (Heavy Steel, Six Sins, Weapon Blade is like 50 gold cheaper than TB).   Tension Bow is a greed item, you only build it when you know you have a heavy lead. I'd never tell someone who is behind in lane to build Tension Bow.  If you're fed enough to get Sorrow Blade before Tension Bow, by all means go Sorrow Blade, but at that point you're so fed it doesn't even matter.  I wasn't being condescending I was being honest."
vainglorygame,3d3xxp,fmaBlots,2,Tue Jul 14 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"Sorrowblade (or components) outtrades Tension Bow (or components), I do it all the time. Perhaps it's different if you can use Tension Bow effectively by poking the enemy with the proc every time it procs, but... no one does that. I've literally never seen anyone use it to poke effectively in lane. Ever. From Getting There to Vainglorious, I never once encountered a Ringo who maximized the potential behind Tension Bow.  TB + AA + AA + AA does more than HS and SS in 4 hits, yeah. HS+SS in 4 autos is 488, TB is 502 (/u/Gadianton's WP calculator). That difference is so small that it actually doesn't even exist. Your crit proc from your passive will actually probably close that gap.  Also, the components to a Sorrowblade will allow you to outtrade anyone building a Tension Bow and prevent them from farming well. I use this advantage (plus Ringo's amazing early game 1v1 ability) to bully people in lane every game I play Ringo. You don't get the same trading power from the components to TB."

vainglorygame,3d1fhe,VGRedditSmurf,6,Sun Jul 12 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"I'm in PoA solo queueing most of the time and I agree with your thought processes, but I still think you missed the overall problem.  Even if you're an amazing carry, I think it's more appropriate to communicate with your teammates with soft locks.  I personally am comfortable playing any hero, so naturally I tend to pick the ones that are strong in the meta - as I'm sure is the case with most people in higher skill tiers.  So for example, I have a very high win rate currently carrying as Taka, but I never auto lock him right away because I wanna see what my teammates do.  So I select jungle first, then soft lock taka (or select lane, and soft lock my first pick), and then I see what my teammates do.  Usually there will be some sort of communication and from their method of communication I'll get a feel for my team and act accordingly.  Almost every time, if someone blatantly auto-locks a player/position right after it's been soft-locked by someone else, that creates tension and signals an unwillingness to cooperate, which 9 times out of 10 will always end up in a frustrating game (bad coordination, falling behind, and inevitably rage pinging ""???"")  On the other hand, when teammates are willing to cooperate with you, more than likely you'll coordinate better and stick together instead of going off and doing your own thing out of rage.  Worst case scenario is you guys lose (which you might have done anyway) and ping ""cheers.""  No frustration or unnecessary tension."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,muriouskind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"If you're comfortable with all the heroes, then you don't need to (and shouldn't) auto-lock.  I don't think auto-locking is better than a coordinated team selection process, when all players are flexible.  I do think auto-locking is better than soft-locking when a player can only play one hero effectively, and will hurt the team more if they do not get to play that hero.  I'm curious to know how you would select if you know, from personal experience, that someone is bad at carrying, but they have already soft-locked lane. Would you soft-lock lane as well, hoping that they change? What if they don't?"
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,muriouskind,4,Sun Jul 12 23:54:13 2015 UTC,"You can kind of tell a player's attitude by their behavior in char select.  If they soft lock and then as soon as you throw your soft lock suggestions around they hard lock, then that's kind of like ""I don't care what you're telling me, I'm doing this hero.""  If they soft lock and while we're throwing our suggestions around stay soft locked, then I get it, they really want to play that hero for some reason, and I take it more as ""I really want/need this hero, and if you don't understand I'm not gonna be playing this back and forth with you,"" which is a lot better than ""fuck you I'm gonna be Ringo whether you like it or not.""  And this is just drawn from experience but if they first soft lock their desired position (lane, jungle), and then their desired hero, for some reason those people tend to be more understanding.  I am a big fan of dodging when a player's character is not cooperative because it's better one person have a cooldown than have a match that's frustrating for everybody. If I stay soft locked with a player for the same hero I'll often let them have it before time runs out.  If they have that ""fuck you"" attitude, I dodge (which really has a negative connotation to it which I think it shouldn't, cause on average, it saves everyone the trouble of a toxic match).  I almost never end up having a toxic match when I follow those general guidelines, and thankfully, it seems a lot of high-tier players will let you have your pick if you stay soft locked"
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,FollowMyRuin,3,Mon Jul 13 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"LOL'd at the ""fuck you I'm gonna be ringo"" part"
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,muriouskind,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:11:56 2015 UTC,"That's perfectly reasonable (although I think some aspects strike me as brinkmanship). I also think that most players are not that reasonable, in which case the equilibrium choice is to lock in as fast as possible, either before or after soft-locking.  What's funny is that people dislike auto-lockers because they don't trust them to play well. But I used to auto-lock because I didn't trust myself to play other heroes, or other people to carry me. Which is to say, they're both solutions to the same information problem."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,muriouskind,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:34:49 2015 UTC,I majored in econ so you're talkin' my language ;)
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,jklick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"Also, I still want to know what you'd do if you know the other player can't carry, but wants to. Let's even pretend that you know they're a great support player, and that's the role they'll have if you lock in. Would you lock in laner? Would you dodge? (No judgment as to either--I've done both.)"
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,jklick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"I might try to negotiate laner and make sure I'm ready to jump into the jungle at a moment's notice, but picking up the slack for your junglers is an unnecessary burden. Lots of times when I have played with someone before and I know they're bad, I might dodge.  I get cooldowns up to 30 mins sometimes, but I don't mind.  I would rather do something productive for 30 mins versus going through a toxic match where I then feel worse later about losing Elo/rank after ignoring the red signs (to clarify, this mainly applies to ranked matches).  So yeah, if I know a match is gonna go bad, I'll dodge.  if I don't, I'm just counting on the other team being bad, which is a dumb gamble to make.  What would you do given that information?"
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,jklick,0,Mon Jul 13 01:51:34 2015 UTC,"If I can lock in before them, I will. If I can't, I'll probably dodge. But I think both of those options (or at least the former) are consistent with my feelings about auto-locking."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,zmancArl,8,Mon Jul 13 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything wrong about what you suggested here. In fact, I'm pretty sure many instalockers I see are already using this same rationale.   The flaw with your philosophy is that it relies on players having a correct perception of themselves and their skill level - i.e. not thinking they're way better than they really are. And if you have been playing games and reading threads as long as I have, I think we can safely say that a large portion of the player base has perception issues. To be fair, people simply don't know what they don't know and they believe they will be a much better carry than their teammates, when in reality they're making an honest mistake (to the detriment of their team)."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,jklick,3,Sun Jul 12 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a huge information problem. But nobody knows if they are misinformed about their own skill level, and/or if their teammate is misinformed about their skill level, so you might as well act consistent with your beliefs, because at least that will be done in good faith, if nothing else."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,Goonie_GooGoo,2,Sun Jul 12 20:30:17 2015 UTC,Valid point. Now it just sounds like we're setting the foundation for a player base with entitlement issues. :D

vainglorygame,3d1fhe,halcyon400,2,Mon Jul 13 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"This could be easily treated with in-game information per hero. W/L and +/- ELO per hero. So if I lock Fortress in Ranked, my teammates see that I have say 31-16 win ratio and sizable +ELO and such character, they would feel confident let me play that hero instead of me. Unfortunately VG is very lacking with such info even for my personal use :)"
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,_DelGriffith_,0,Mon Jul 13 12:20:56 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea, particularly because I want my teammates to be forgiving when they see it's my 3rd time playing a hero."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,Ares-2,3,Mon Jul 13 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"But by that reasoning, how is someone supposed to learn other characters if they always autolock Taka (or whomever)?  If another Taka (for example) player instalocks before you (metaphorically you, not You specifically), and you suck with any other hero because you never bothered learning, you and the team are screwed.  In casual queue now, it's no biggie and you can try out another character.  In ranked queue, thanks buddy, you just made me lose some rank again by no fault of my own."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,WSBowman,0,Sun Jul 12 20:34:10 2015 UTC,"I think people should learn other heroes. I think they should do that in casual. I think that the 3 hero requirement for ranked is intended to mitigate some of the problems of auto-locking.  But if another player auto-locks Taka before I can auto-lock Taka, my guess is that the team would have been just as screwed if I had locked in first--which is why I say it takes at least two people for auto-locking to be a problem. And if I really can't play any other heroes, my response would probably be to dodge. Because, like the rest of the people on the team, I don't want to lose a ranked game."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,ChapterLiam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"Is there a 3 hero requirement for ranked?  Or can someone go in having only 1 hero?     it takes at least two people for auto-locking to be a problem   But then doesn't that make the practice of autolocking inherently bad?  If only I do it, it's a good thing, but if someone else does it too, it's a bad thing?  That's odd reasoning.  Plus it's selfish.  Which is the core of what's wrong with instalocking:  it's indicative that you don't care about the team composition at all, nor for that matter the team, but just your own self.  Which is evident in the actions of many (not all) instalockers, as mentioned in other replies here.  If autolockers in general weren't an issue, nobody would be complaining about it.  As it is, a significant majority of the time they're bad teammates, and thus lower your theoretical 50:50 chance of winning.  These are the same people who in an FPS would pick a sniper because they're cool (even though there's already 4 or whatever), then go sit in a bush/corner all day and ignore the objective."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,WSBowman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"You must unlock 3 heroes to play ranked.  I'm not saying auto-locking is good when I do it, but bad when we both do it. I'm saying that neither person should be angry in that situation--it's about negating blame, not finding someone to put it on. And I don't think it's selfish; I think it's consistent with the team's interests. See above.  Look: It's fine to be angry with someone for being bad at the game, but first, that's not a problem with auto-locking, that's a problem with people being bad. They might correlate with one another, but preventing auto-locking (how?) would still leave you with a terrible teammate. (I'd like to think I helped a lot of people rank up back when I was auto-locking.)  Second, people have a tendency to attribute their team's failures to other people instead of themselves, and auto-lockers are an easy target.  Third, people get angry because they want to carry, and everybody thinks they'd do the job better than the next guy."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,MARSpu,3,Mon Jul 13 01:24:43 2015 UTC,"So Krul, Rona, and Taka should all auto lock on the same team because they think they play really good with that particular character.   Got it."

They don't have a right to bitch at anybody about their team comp. That said, I don't think anyone should bitch at them. And if that's all they can play, they weren't going to win anyway.  (3) 3 auto-lockers at once is uncommon, to say the least. But extreme hypotheticals are easy, I guess."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,Tsar_MapleVG,2,Mon Jul 13 07:10:12 2015 UTC,"An example:   You play Taka with skill 80, and Catherine with skill 30.  Your teammate plays Taka with skill 90, and Catherine with skill 70.   You should auto-lock Taka. Even if they are better at Taka than you are, your team's net skill is lower if they carry and you support, because you suck at Catherine. You should take the time to improve at Catherine (in casual), but that doesn't affect your decision this game."
vainglorygame,3d1fhe,Tsar_MapleVG,2,Sun Jul 12 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The first thing I think when someone insta-locks is, ""This person feels significantly more comfortable with this hero than any other, so I should probably just let them do their thing and I will adapt as I can to help them.""  Of course, 9/10 times this leaves me playing support, and then I get blamed if they fail to carry. But that's a different thread. ;P"

I only pinged to signal hidden enemies, when I had to retreat, if I wanted to go anywhere near overextending...and maybe a couple of frowniez when I died.

The set-up was me soloing lane with Cath and Krul at the jungle shop. I over-extended past the 50 yard line to try and love tap Ringo past his last couple HP points he had remaining when I was ganked right on their turret (destroyed a couple minutes prior) by their Taka and Skaarf. Popped a pot and healed for the arcane with my ult up. With all 3 in range, I used a reflex block and stunned the three. By this time I had pinged to get Krul and Cath up to lane but Krul was having a blast farming so it was just me and Cath once the stun had worn off. Taka was especially squishy with his health already at 2/3 when I ult'd so he and Ringo were almost dead so they started to GTFO when I focused Skaarf with my damage boost- Cath activated war horn and we almost had them with my arcane when we ran over this shitton (and I mean shitton) of scout traps. After checking builds later I found out Taka only had a tyrant's and spent the rest on these mines. So I immediately bailed but Cath activates her shield with 2 shatterglass and a frostburn- with all three burning with arcane her shield projectiles picked up all three kills for the ace.

vainglorygame,3d14zj,Iamchinesedotcom,7,Sun Jul 12 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"Support usually gets blamed even when the carries made mistakes too, because rude people usually don't play support. Don't sweat it.   Story time: I was Catherine in a match the other day when my Ringo and Koshka kept overextending and getting themselves killed. I could tell they were partied together because they shared the same prefix in their names. Both of them, but especially the Ringo, started ping spamming me and refusing to coordinate with me - resulting in, you guessed it, more deaths and a loss.   Afterward the Ringo friended me and called me trash and told me to delete the game, then unfriended me.   So I friended the Koshka, and surprisingly, she accepted. I said, ""Is your friend always this polite?"" She actually apologized and said her friend is just trolling and she had told him he was overextending. We wished each other GL and went on our ways.   (Bonus: I was higher ranked than both of them.)  There was another time when a teammate friended me after a loss and berated me for having ""zero knowledge of the game"" and couldn't believe I was ranked a full tier higher than him. He wanted to know ""who carried me"" since I obviously lacked any skill whatsoever and I was completely to blame for the loss. Interspersed with vulgar insults, of course.   Man, people sure do get caught up in A) caring about the outcome of a video game, and B) looking for someone to blame other than themselves.   Lesson: Trolls be trolls. Don't try to make sense of them. They are everywhere on the Internet, hiding behind their anonymity, thinking that none of this is ""real"" anyway so being a dick doesn't matter. They are twelve years old. Try to laugh about it and troll them back if it makes you feel better, and ignore them, and shrug it off, and keep around friends who are more respectful."

Skill tier has gone from nearly Hotness Bronze down to decentish silver all due to the ridiculous people I'm getting matched with. I want to lose tier due to actual skill differences, like if I get destroyed by someone better than me, fine, but just about EVERY loss in the last 48 hours was because of either an AFK or someone trolling/otherwise.   /end rant   Please allow reporting.

vainglorygame,3d12gx,WJSlugger,4,Sun Jul 12 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"I play fortress often in ranked solo at POA level. I agree with most of what KingQuet said, but I would be careful using his B first because the bleed might take away some last hits from your jungle carry and the first couple rounds of jungling are crucial for your jungle carry. This isn't as big an issue at higher tiers bc your jungle carry will be more aware of the bleed and will time the last hit better.  I usually rush fountain then counter build. I also tend to get boots later in the game with fortress than I do with other heroes. I max out his B & C abilities. Just keep in mind that you are giving the enemy team 150 gold every time you pop your ult.  Ardan used to be my hero of choice when playing support, but I don't play as him often these days because I feel his ult is too easily countered and he doesn't bring as much utility to the team as fortress."

I usually start with my B and I'm pretty aggressive since he doesn't have a stun or slow you want to start starving the enemy team and slow ball a little so you are way ahead late game, or better yet there is no late game. I max his b first as it does a good amount of damage and provides DOT, lifesteal, and can inflict a big burst of damage and mortal wound.  Its great against heroes with health barriers or life steal built in (looking at you Krul) and if you have a hero on your team with high attack speed he can build those stacks quickly. Also try to save your A for chasing down the opposing team and its great when farming if your jungler is separated or died you can use it on a jungle monster  to speed them up.  As far as builds I usually do a fountain or two first items although be sure to counter build if your going against a heavey wp team crucible and shiversteel are also great on him.  Warhorn even though he has that built in speed is an ok item if you don't get shiversteel and I personally haven't done it, but clockwork is very annoying on him as his ult is always up, but I would make this a last late game item and would prefer to just get a cp infusion . I honestly have played about 40 or 50 Fortress games and only once have I built aftershock so building any damage isn't very necessary other than infusions. I honestly buy boots pretty late on him and may not buy them at all b/c of his perk.    His ult is great for initiating as well as that global flair kind of option.  Just don't use his ult every time its up save it for initiating a fight as the opposing team no has to decide to kill you or the wolves who also do decent damage and inflict bleed and mortal wound damage.  He's a really fun hero and he does a good amount of damage with out any items built on him, I hope you enjoy playing him."
vainglorygame,3d12gx,KingQuet90,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! Really appreciate it.   Other than that, do you think he will be nerfed again?   I don't wana blow my glory on him if he gonna get nerfed a lot.. Might as well try rona then"
vainglorygame,3d12gx,KingQuet90,2,Sun Jul 12 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm not sure if he's getting nerfed again, he feels strong to me but he doesn't really feel OP.  Its all about your play style, Rona is a good hero, but I find I need a really good support with me."
vainglorygame,3d12gx,halcyon400,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:29:14 2015 UTC,"He already received a slight nerf in 1.6, I'd be surprised if he gets nerfed again.   I suggest Fortress over Rona as there is usually more need for support than for carries.   You can play him to suit your style. I agree with the other commenter that you shouldn't need any offensive items with him, just defensive items, a mid-game chronograph, and late-game clockwork can be nice. With that I usually max his A and C skills, sometimes those wolves can kill very low-health enemies by themselves. I highly recommend shiversteel, too, unless you are facing melee enemies who have to stick to you anyway, such as Glaive and Krul.   Recommended build is warhorn first but I usually save that for last since his A skill is sort of like a warhorn and, as support, you should be sticking by your allies instead of farming on your own.   This strategy has been pretty successful for me and I've been maining Fortress in ranked."
vainglorygame,3d12gx,nickmkats,2,Sun Jul 12 20:05:23 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you as a Krul jungle carry, I do a little happy dance every time one of my teammates selects fortress as a support. He rules the roost with Queen Catherine in the support business these days in my opinion."
vainglorygame,3d12gx,ChapterLiam,2,Mon Jul 13 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I actually prefer him. I'm a Taka Jungle Carry, mixed CP/WP (usually Aftershock + Shatterglass + Tornado Trigger + Boots + Fountain of Renewal + Tyrant's Monocle) and and Fortress is really fast and is really strong in team fights. Hooked up with a Warhorn, maybe a Frostburn depending on the build, he really does feel like a true support character. In some way he feels like what Adagio should have been. Plus he seems so peppy early game, hopping around, slightly but consistently faster than everyone else."
vainglorygame,3d12gx,melbtown,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"In terms of playstyle, I'll build super tanky, and run in and out of the fight. Mark as prey, get bleed on target, walk out taking hits while my carries nuke the target. repeat as needed. I always get IGC first, then rush either Warhorn or Fountain depending on enemy comp. get t1 boots and energy battery. Rush other of warhorn or fountain. Enemy team makeup will decide either pauldron or crucible for next item. T2 boots then clockwork. Final t3 defence item if battle still going on. Max A and B, and remember his ult can be used to scout out enemy team location if you're fearing an ambush, or to sniff out a taka that just vanished in a team fight. Don't bleed minions that you want your teammate to kill, and if you're helping in the lane between jungle clears make yourself the first thing the lane minions hit so your laner gets slightly more gold."
vainglorygame,3d12gx,melbtown,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:13:09 2015 UTC,Why max A and B over B and C?
vainglorygame,3d12gx,thecayco,3,Mon Jul 13 04:34:33 2015 UTC,"The overdrive on A makes the speed effect last longer (2 - 3 seconds), as well as hitting like a truck. Overdrive on B means the % health drop is bigger when the stacks are maxed. Yes C overdrive does a bit more damage and adds more health, but since your A and B are your bread and butter I'd rather max those instead."
vainglorygame,3d12gx,thecayco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:27:58 2015 UTC,"I used to play Ardan support but since he seems so useless now, I now main Fortress support. I rush Warhorn first since the speedy farming benefits both me and my carry. I rush Crucible next, and then Fountain, then another Fountain or some other individual defense item next. In some cases when enemies seem too ""slippery"", I sneak in boots to help chase.  I usually go B first, then an A, then pour all of the next stats on my B and C."

The gold could have been spent better in all three cases. When all three teammates are building sub-optimally, you're gonna have a bad time.   (Koshka was probably the worst offender, and she paid the price for it in deaths. It's easier to rationalize the other two builds than it is to rationalize a melee carry with zero defense or lifesteal, though I still think all three could be improved.)  Plus that support Adagio had a good build, I've been experimenting with that myself, it works well when the team coordinates and plays aggressively."

vainglorygame,3cxjlv,Vector-Spyder21,3,Sat Jul 11 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of something like that. You could have two characters, one controlled by the player and one that moves in front of you to absorb directional damage (leaves you vulnerable if targeted, similar to Joule). When you're targeted it could auto-attack the enemy, so you would see a slight uptick in damage when being attacked, but minimal because the bot is primarily there for defense.  It could be targeted to destroy it, on a timer for respawn or actively respawned with an ability that otherwise gives it regen (like petal). The special could see it become a mount that moves you rapidly towards the target enemy and causes a debuff.  Hell, maybe you have all of the abilities function through the bot. The actual hero is a programmer or something, very vulnerable to attack. One of the abilities could be a toggle that switches between attack mode and defend mode. Stats for the bot adjust accordingly and there's a visual indicator (e.g. blue accent lights when in def mode and red with extended arms when in atk mode)."
vainglorygame,3cxjlv,oldboldmold,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"You sir are a genius. I was thinking something like a pair of two heroes, one npc and one controlled, on a mount.

Your idea though makes this seem more realistically possible."

Laners should just stay away unless they're throwing in their ultimate. Petal + Taka can work, but it has to be a combination of Petal taking the focus and using their ultimate, and Taka having overdrive on his A Skill. Krul is basically impossible to 1v1, so have stuns ready! Best bet at a 1v1 is a laner with Frostburn or any slow abilities.

vainglorygame,3cxc02,CheshireCaddington,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm guessing you mean a Serpents mask quick draw SAW and a Krul with clockwork and the sense to build at least 1 defensive item.   Stun + stun + burst focus kill. It's not easy to coordinate that in solo queue.   With Saw, his stacks get deleted with a stun, I think. That means he has to start all over again. He's going to be squishy enough to burst down.   With Krul, you have to be patient. Kite him, even if you are melee. Keep your distance. Let him rush you then run away. Make sure he's already used his ult. if he has high HP, hope you have an aftershock on your team. It takes either a stun + silence, or a stun + stun to kill him. You let him chip away at Joule or Glaive, then stun him when his stacks are high. He'll recover, but hopefully whoever he ran away from is far away now, so he'll chase them, that's when you stun/silence and burst him.   Play Catherine or Vox or Joule for reliable stunning / silencing.   These aren't full proof guides, but they work for me often enough not to get frustrated.   Two tips: (1) Saw is slow, and is insecure about it. Also, you can reset his stacks with a stun. (2) Krul players have to be confident. Sometimes it's a game of chicken. The thing is, once an amateur Krul chickens out and runs, he's toast. But overconfident Krul is also a detriment, because overconfident Krul will put himself in bad situations. When he does, teach him a lesson."

It would be great to know you've got a guy from two tiers above you on your team and you should follow his lead, or a guy from two below that you should alter your gameplan around or whatever.  Even better, if you knew the skill tiers of your teammates and opponents before locking in it would at least give you dodge pointless mismatches (at the cost of the cooldown timer to deter overuse).  Even if the devs really want to obfuscate how bad the matchups are, they could do something to at least give you a chance to opt out, like if the elo difference between the two teams is beyond some range, show the weaker team a warning ""Opponent is much stronger, if you win you'll get lots of elo.  If.  You probably won't though.  You'll probably just die faster than puppies tossed into a jet engine.""  The only argument against this sort of thing that I've heard that makes any sense is ""then people in the top tiers where the air is thinner would have too long a matchup time"", which never made any sense to me.  If you let terrible matchups happen, you piss off tons of people.  If you let queue times get a little longer for the top tiers, you piss off a much smaller number of people."

It's a very weird question, so much so that I can't say no for sure because I've never tested it, but I've certainly never noticed anything of the like.  Have you by any chance got Krul mixed up with SAW? SAW loses movement speed the longer he is in combat (and gains attack speed to compensate)."
vainglorygame,3cygjm,Twiggled,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"I thought when I started playing, before they added scaarf, it said like the longer he stayed still, he would lose movement speed or something"
vainglorygame,3cygjm,Twiggled,4,Sat Jul 11 23:10:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, are you referring to his passive perk?  If he stays still in a bush for 1.5 seconds he gains a movement speed boost for 2 seconds (and his next basic attack slows the target)."
vainglorygame,3cygjm,stakkar,2,Sat Jul 11 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Late game there are many things your enemies will have that can slow you down...  Everything from shiversteel/frostburn/skaarf goop/etc.  So it may appear that you get slower, but that applies to everyone.  Also, if you don't get boots and everyone else does, then it'll appear you're slower."

vainglorygame,3cxioi,calltothelostboys,5,Sat Jul 11 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"Defense does work. If you have someone going full WP and you are the same character but instead of 100% WP, one of your slots is a metal jacket, you will win 1v1 every time.  Full defense doesn't work that well, IMO, unless you are relying on your teammates for damage and the enemy isn't mobile/smart enough to ignore you and go for your teammates first. As support, I always build a damage item or two; breaking point is one of my favorites because the longer they ignore you, the more powerful you become."
vainglorygame,3cxioi,FinndBors,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on two things: your support and gold earned. If a Catherine rushes items like Fountain or Crucible then it gives you some time before you need to build your own defense. They'll have their abilities to back you up in addition to heals and block.  At the same time, if a team is farming more than you, they will be able to counter build that much easier. Just played a game where I was Joule in lane and had Adagio and Rona in Jungle. Enemy team was Vox in lane and Ardan plus Ringo in Jungle. I saw their first purchases and built Armor fairly early. Turns out my teammates weren't building any defense so I was the last man standing after every fight. Then Ringo started building Bonesaw and it was GG.   TLDR: When you have good Support it gives you more time to build defense. Keep your CS/farm high so you can counter build against the enemy team easier."
vainglorygame,3cxioi,RaifetheRenegade,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:36:49 2015 UTC,"If you are down by a lot that means your opponents have a ton more gold than you. Its truly an uphill battle.  The way i see it this game (and other mobas) have two components. One is your skill and actual realtime playing like laning and teamfighting. The other component is your build which is entirely match-dependent. Sometimes building defensive will win the game, other times lose it. Its all sjtuatinal"
vainglorygame,3cw0gd,thehippiekayey,4,Sat Jul 11 06:19:45 2015 UTC,Yeah.every time I'm in a party with a friend we will be in a 6-game losing streak because we will get matched up against players at least 1 whole tier above us. It's absolutely ridiculous and takes the fun out of the game.
vainglorygame,3cw0gd,lcpdragonslayer,3,Sat Jul 11 14:27:23 2015 UTC,Stopped playing friend games for this reason - it's something that has consistently happened since I started last year

vainglorygame,3cy249,treboR-,5,Sat Jul 11 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's a counterable situation. I happened to face Krul+Glaive BP+Defense built several times, and got beaten most of them, but learnt how to deal with. I was successful by focusing krul, since he weakens someone in your team and doesn't need much WP to deal damage. Glaive, on the other hand, will take a little time to shine. Also, you support must rush Atlas Pauldron immediately as the first item, and try to hit'em two, or at least Krul. If you have it in your team, make good use of your mortal wound character to reduce Krul's DMR barrier. An Aftershock helps dealing with tanky dudes. Last but not least, KITE! Kite these guys."
vainglorygame,3cy249,DiamondtearLeo,2,Sat Jul 11 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"They are beatable. I know that, sometimes I can beat them. And yes, I still build atlas and kite them but it still doesn't work when they catch you out of nowhere, shiversteel you until they get at least 10-15 stacks and then take out your team. I usually win when we have 2 or more stunners since I can take them, but I still don't like the fact how spider twin things can only be countered if you choose characters. It's just hard to kite them and take them down as once again they just build a bunch of defence.  I don't know. It just feels like the only massive counter is stuns and even then it doesn't feel effective. Thanks for the response though."
vainglorygame,3cy249,Jajajack14,4,Sat Jul 11 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"The most important thing being missed is the truth, if the game gets to the point where an enemy has a BP as well as four defensive items, there is very little hope of a comeback. Against heros that are going to build that path, they're sacrificing a weak early game for this dominant late game youre experiencing. It's good to focus them when it gets late, but it's usually hopeless at that point. The way to stop them is to play aggressive early and push your lead, otherwise Krul will get to late game when he truly is ukillable."
vainglorygame,3cy249,GEOpdx,3,Sun Jul 12 01:15:25 2015 UTC,"They have to stay in combat with you, avoid stuns, and not get focused. It is not easy to succeed but if they know what they are doing they can. That strikes me as balanced."
vainglorygame,3cy249,Twiggled,2,Sat Jul 11 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"I mean they do shiversteel you to slow you down so they can stay in combat with you. I just did a game before and if you play smart, you will wait until they use their debuffs then strike against them. But yeah, sometimes it can be balanced but you need to have a lot of team effort for it to be useless against your team. Btw did I mention that they always have and aegis and Crucible to stop the stuns?"

vainglorygame,3cumqg,BvB_Titan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:10:40 2015 UTC,I've noticed that the few AFK that I've seen all appear to be because of connectivity - just stopping in the middle of lame or next to the jungle shop.

vainglorygame,3cumqg,KarmaAdjuster,0,Sat Jul 11 05:37:01 2015 UTC,I don't know those words
vainglorygame,3cumqg,CarlosSpicywiener007,3,Sat Jul 11 13:26:19 2015 UTC,"Spamming - repeatedly sending something unwanted, in this case ""ping spamming"" refers to using the communication buttons in the upper right and upper left of the screen as quickly as possible creating a cacophony of noise that is unhelpful and often frustrating for the other players.  Smiling - there is a button on the upper left side of the screen that allows you to send a happy face image to your teammates. This is usually used to show positive support or appreciation of your teammates, but can be used to mock if used as if to take pleasure in a teammate's mistake.  Thumbs Ups - there is a button upper left side of the screen that allows you to send a 'thumbs up' image to your teammates. This is usually used to show positive support or appreciation of your teammates, but can be used to mock if used as if to take approve of a teammate's mistake.  Feeding - dying (usually repeatedly) to an opponent, thus granting them additional gold for each death allowing them to increase their lead over you.  Toxic - in this context it refers to negative behavior that that makes the game completely unpleasant to play, and often ends up not only ruining the current game but also stands a chance at impacting following games of other players as they are now in a bad mood. Attitudes are contagious, and especially negative ones, thus the actions of negative players are called ""toxic"" as they can contaminate their teammate's moods with their unsportsmanlike conduct.  If there are other confusing words let me know and I can explain."

vainglorygame,3cwny8,ChapterLiam,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it might be difficult for any character. Since other players will continue to move when you lag. The Noob Trio (Ringo, Koshka, and Catherine) all have abilities that lock-on or don't require you to aim so they'll do better than others."
vainglorygame,3cvrib,TheRedditGod,6,Sat Jul 11 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"At the four minute mark, objectives will spawn. Do not take any of them at that point. The circular bar at the Gold Miner depicts how long until he's full and, if he belongs to a team, pays out. As such, you want to wait until he's nearly full to take him, if you can. A big mistake newer players commit with the Gold Mine is taking it back right after the enemy has taken it. If they're smart, the enemy will wait until it is near paying out and take it right back. They would've gotten one big payout, you would've gotten a minuscule payout, and then they would've gotten a huge payout that you essentially gave to them.  Additionally, Minion Miners do buff your minions to make them more durable, move faster, and do more damage to turrets, but keep in mind that this will force your laner to push farther into the lane if they want to farm, make it harder for them to last hit, and, since stronger minions are worth more, will give the enemy laner a bit more gold. Wait until you are ready to push or want to make it harder for the enemy laner to rotate before taking a Minion Mine."
vainglorygame,3cvrib,ThreeBlindMice_7,3,Sat Jul 11 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"Dont stress so much about what you're doing in game! Most of us complaining about Taka players are upset because they do something foolish, die very quickly, and then display toxic behavior by pinging the question mark repeatedly. As long as you're just learning and being kind to your teammates, you'll have very few problems.   Learn to stick with your team once the game gets to the 15 minute mark, only take objectives like the Gold Miner and Minion Miners when they're going to be beneficial to your team and you have some teammate backup should the enemy show up while you're low on health.   If you want any tips at all about Taka, let us know! I'll do my best to help as a Taka main :)."

For that reason, characters that can deal ""burst damage"" (notoriously, Taka) is great for ambushes and stealing. When the enemy is about to take the gold mine or Kraken, you can wait nearby and use a powerful attack (X-Retsu) to try and take it for your own team. Let them do the work!"

vainglorygame,3cut1l,dubiousatbest,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"Not to be too much of a noob, but which heroes would you recommend for jungle and support? There's so many that it's hard to know who to focus on."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:02:10 2015 UTC,"Support: Catherine, Fortress, Adagio, Ardan - Catherine is probably easiest. Fortress and Adagio are arguably stronger but more complicated.  Jungle carry: Taka, Koshka, Rona, Glaive, Krul - Basically the melee people.   Those are traditional roles, but people can change things up."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:40:57 2015 UTC,"My own preferences for Jungle:   Koshka if you need CP damage Joule if you need WP damage (or you're not sure which way your laner is building - Joule is also great with CP) Krul if your support is Fortress - they work well together   and for Support:   Ardan - he's just too much fun and so tanky he's nigh unkillable. Koshka and Glaive can also be great supports in a pinch, and I'll often choose one of them if I'm not sure if the other jungler is actually intending on going to get the contract. Fortress works great if your jungler is going with a high mobility champ like Krul, Koshka, and Taka.   Your mileage may vary. I've also seen great Celesete, Vox, and Ringo junglers if you want to try something a little different. And on the non-standard support side, there's always Skaarf and Adagio (even though his kit seems to be all about support).  Experiment in casual queue and see what combinations work best for you. For example, I've seen plenty of awesome Takas, but I am not one of them."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,filibustier,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:48:31 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you like to play, but Vox and Krul are super fun and very different flavors of jungle play. For support, Catherine is probably the best first support to learn."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,Cacao_Cacao,5,Mon Jul 13 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"SAW is a hero that dominates lower levels but tends to not have a place in the meta once you reach Hotness/SA (though I've certai ly seen him occasionally at these levels--and usually auto locked).  He gets wrecked by stuns and is an immediate target in team fights--tends to get melted immediately. He is slow on rotating due to his heroic perk so he suffers to join mid game team fights / invades in the jungle.   Crystal SAW is a ton of fun though. I'm sure he can be viable at higher levels of play in the right hands. Also, learn to stutter step with him when he's got 12 stacks."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,Cyb3rfr3ak,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, stuns are the bane of my existence! And anytime more than one of the enemy are on-screen, chances are they're going to target me because I'm slow and vulnerable. So he definitely has some draw-backs. I've done pretty well when I can position him on the fringe of battle and fire back toward the action with SF, it drains enemy health pretty quick. I think any player that runs SAW in ranked is going to have to be conservative and calculated in their gameplay.   Thanks for the stutterstep tip! I haven't tried it. Is it just so you can squeeze a shot off to prevent from losing your spin up?"
vainglorygame,3cut1l,Cacao_Cacao,3,Sat Jul 11 00:35:34 2015 UTC,"Crystal Saw was the hero I first fell in love with back in November. He was a different beast then. In Hotness and SA I've found players have a general dislike for him and frequently dodge if you lock him in. If the enemy team has any two of these: Koska, Glaive, Celeste, Joule or Catherine you'll be in for a rough match due to the frequent stuns. Build a reflex block and stick by your teammates.   I don't use him in ranked but he is a lot of fun in SoloQ. Also his skins are my favorite."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,adyendrus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm still a couple levels away from 10, so I haven't tried running him in ranked to be honest. And you're right, some matches I just feel completely outmatched by other characters when using him. I'll have to keep trying to get better, see if I can make him a viable option in ranked!  I don't expect it to take too much longer to reach 10. Are there any particular characters you recommend for that level of play?"
vainglorygame,3cut1l,adyendrus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:32:35 2015 UTC,"Something I tried quite often (with success!) in the last few games:  As a team, set up an ambush. If you see the enemies coming, stay two-three steps behind your teammates. Use the 2nd skill but NOT in the direction where your opponents are coming so chances are higher that they won't focus you first.  Assuming that in this moment your teammates chain their cc perfectly, you're gonna be a nightmare for the enemy team. Pop out your ultimate, crit them to death. If someone is trying to run, show him your shiny boots and how maxed out your roadie run is..  (https://flic.kr/p/vzZaaP not the best ""proof"", as these opponents probably were all newbies, since a huge wave of new players came with the android release of Vainglory but I just need one or two more games until I can try Saw in ranked games..)  Edit: Finally got to Level 10 and tried some ranked matches..  https://flic.kr/p/vT9gKD  https://flic.kr/p/vSwuw9"
vainglorygame,3cut1l,adyendrus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:55:28 2015 UTC,"I have transitioned to Celeste. She has great range like saw, a decent stun and a vision advantage . I build eve of harvest, broken myth with boots and a situational defense item (usually reflex block). Frostburn is a great addition if you have the gold. Because of her squishyness I find upgrading boots more important for her so she can stay away from the carnage and will go to tier 3 towards the end of the match. Max your A and B skills so that you have great range (with A) and can stun to keep enemies away from you (with B). Celeste is very squishy and is not able to burst down opponents so she takes some practice to get sustained damage. The learning curve with her is that you can't burst and you can't sit and fight. I find I spend a lot of time running away while dropping helios and stuns until they realize they can't catch me and turn around or get killed. A very efficient combo is to drop a helio, drop a stun then two more helios. They'll be hurting and if your teammates are nearby (hopefully) they won't make it out alive.  Apologies for the late response."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,adyendrus,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:32 2015 UTC,"Hi friend! Most of my initial games were as SAW, and he's always been a very fun hero for me as well!  Stutter stepping is where you rapidly move in a direction (either with your target, or away from them, whichever is more beneficial) and tap back on the target you'd like to attack. With SAW's natural attack speed you can move seamlessly while continuously laying down damage.  That's an interesting sacrifice you suggested: Clockwork, for energy regen and 50% CDA, rather than boots. I must admit, I like it. It almost gives SAW a 7th item slot, considering how effective his RR is for mobility.  I was raised in the WP meta, so I never actually played as CP SAW. WP used to be very fun. I would quickly get a Sorrowblade, but then found myself building 1-2 Reflex Blocks because my attack speed was my survival. I think picking one up would still be very relevant in the current stun meta, especially on a hero like SAW, who needs to channel his SF, and needs his stacks for his ultimate to decimate teams.  If you have something that works for you then (roadie) run with it. Don't let people tell you something is good or not. Also, reddit automatically hands out downvotes, so don't think people are just downvoting."
vainglorygame,3cut1l,adyendrus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:47:09 2015 UTC,"That stutterstep tactic is great! That's always been my biggest complaint, that moving from point to point around the battle keeps me from being able to attack. I'm getting ready to jump in and try the stutterstep method now. Thanks for explaining it so clearly!  I'm glad you think it's a reasonable trade, the boots for the clockwork. I've tried a lot of different items in its spot, including Eve of Harvest, but I feel like crystal SAW depends so much on his specials that the cool down boost is pretty necessary.   I didn't mean to sound riled up about the downvotes, sorry! I don't mind. I've been a redditor for several years now, but stopped logging on or posting for the better part of this year. Once I started getting into Vainglory and found this sub, I couldn't resist logging back in, because I'd love to be a part of a larger VG community. I just wanted to make sure I'm not ruffling any feathers or retreading old ground, which is why I edited my post to apologize.  Also, thank you (and everyone else!) for replying.

I have a Note 3 (android), and normally I can use the stylus to take a screenshot by holding it against the screen for a few seconds. It doesn't work on VG though for some reason. I think someone posted a link yesterday on how to do it on android, so let me try to find that. I had a 16-0-2 game for the first time ever earlier, and was so pissed I couldn't screenshot it.  How many matches do you want result pics from? I won't cherry pick, I promise. I'll run through them now and post the results.  Edit - Also, if you want to play, add me on the NA server please!

vainglorygame,3cvhot,mowmail,7,Sat Jul 11 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"1) Glaive, Adagio, Koshka, Joule  2) No need to rush Aftershock as a Catherine. a defensive item would be better, and to answer your question - boots are usually the 2nd or 3rd item I buy.  3) Yeah this is a problem in lower tiers. Best option is to try to choose a laner rather than support, but if you must go support just try to make the best of it and follow your jungler around.   4) Don't believe they reveal this. Ranked and Casual ELO is different. Neither reflect each other.  5) I'm pretty sure they do.  6) Depends on the hero you're playing. Some heroes are better weapon while some are better Crystal. One example I find is Crystal vox being better than weapon vox in the late game.  7)You could probably use some sort of recording application. The spectating is only available in private games."
vainglorygame,3cvhot,Musa_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:37:19 2015 UTC,"regarding #3, one thing that you can try is to ping the jungle camp you want your jungler to attack (especially if they are leaving), and also do the ""support dance"" where you just take the first hit, and then go back and forth indicating that you don't intend to take the camp. Hopefully your jungler will figure it out. If not, then maybe go help the laner. You'll at the very least benefit from all the minion kills he makes."
vainglorygame,3cvhot,KarmaAdjuster,2,Sat Jul 11 06:38:08 2015 UTC,"Support heroes: Pickles, Catherine, Ardan, Adagio, Glaive are all common supports, occasionally Koshka too (less frequently now than in the past due to balancing).    Boots should be one of the first purchases you make as a support, unless you are playing Pickles, his heroic perk can substitute for boots most of the time allowing you to pickup other items first.   In solo queue and while still new (meaning you are being matched with newer players) some players don't understand how Ironguard Contract works, the best way to do this is to stop attacking and ping ""Go"" on what you are tanking. It is generally considered best to have two in jungle and one in lane (aside from when rotating to lane to gank an enemy laner).    ELO is the system used for matchmaking, from what has been stated/speculated there are two separate values for each account, one for casual and one for ranked. Casual ELO has no display, just remember the more you win the harder opponents you will end up going against.    Yes, flares and mines can reveal enemy mines.    CP/WP depends on a lot of factors, some heroes do crystal better than others. The most notable of these are Celeste, Skaarf, Koshka, though many others have viable builds using crystal power as opposed to weapon. It all comes down to what is being built on both teams. It is generally considered a decent idea to have both weapon and crystal being built by different heroes on the same team to make it harder for the enemy team to defend against with a single item.    Recording gameplay can be done with a capture card or using AirPlay. There is a lot of information on this on the official Vainglory forums and also at www.killthestreamer.com (note: some of this applies to actually streaming but the info can be used to record gameplay without streaming as well).    Hope all this helps!"

vainglorygame,3cvhot,SugarVenomSEMC,2,Sat Jul 11 17:25:23 2015 UTC,"Krul is great as support. He is very durable and can solo objectives with his lifesteal. Though I prefer Catherine at the moment.   I rarely get aftershock for catherine. Always IGC, 2 potions first. When I go to shop for the first time since the game began I almost always have enough gold for hourglass, boots and oakheart.   Jungle first. Always. In higher tiers even your laner comes jungle first. Help your laner as and when necessary but jungler benefits from you more. The laner has a turret bodyguard - the jungler only has you."
vainglorygame,3cvhot,lcpdragonslayer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"WP only heroes: Glaive, Krul (both   could   go tank + Aftershock).  CP only heroes: Celeste (!), Skaarf, Koshka (very few build WP on Koshka)  Both: Joule, Taka (WP better), Vox, Ringo, SAW, Adagio, Petal (CP probably better), Rona  Support (Fortress, Arden, Catherine): they neither have enough CP scaling to turn their abilities into enough DPS, nor do they have an aggressive heroic perk. Therefore you should never build them too aggressively WP or too crystal heavy An Aftershock or Breaking Point needs to be sufficient. It is much better to add an early chronograph and a late Clockwork into the mix and make your abilities count. There are exceptions: Frostburn on Fortress can be good, e.g., Eve on Catherine, but I consider those luxury items on a support."

vainglorygame,3cvhot,Lensjo,2,Sat Jul 11 10:39:25 2015 UTC,"Krul's ability base damage is already really high. Broken Myth works well to enhance it. More crystal is not necessary. On the other hand you want to go attack speed and make the most out of his natural life steal of his B ability. A breaking point is almost a must. Mix in a Bonesaw or a TornadoTrigger or both. Shiver Steel does wonders. Cool down acceleration is a good idea too. Compromise needed, as you really want to have at least two defensive items."

vainglorygame,3cx27a,Dinimuetter,17,Sat Jul 11 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"If the enemy is in a position where they can steal the kraken, it's your own fault. It's like deciding to do the Red Baron when the entire enemy is alive and coming for you. You take the Kraken after a wipe, a big team fight, or whenever else you know you have an advantage and the enemy team can't get it (some characters can ninja-solo it, but it's risky).   While killing the kraken you should have vision on the enemy in some way, either through mines, flares, your allies, checking the bushes, or their death timers.   TL;DR it's perfectly fair, and if it gets stolen from you, you only have yourself to blame."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,ReamusLQ,-1,Sat Jul 11 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"The thing is, how would you cover the whole jungle with vision? It's not like there's a small choke point like in the other games. Also it should be possible to take the Kraken when you have a big team fight advantage/ be able to sneak one in due to bad enemy positioning such as when 1 of them is on the other side of the map. If you describe it like that, then it's basically a big game ending move that's only possible when you've killed at least 2 of them, not when you have an upper hand. Access from both jungle to the Kraken is also very fast unlike in the other ARTS."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,ReamusLQ,3,Sat Jul 11 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"You can pretty much only steal from the bushes on either side of the kraken. It's smart to either drop mines there, or keep poking your head in while you attack the kraken from there. Heck, your ranged carry could just be attacking the kraken from the bushes to hold vision over it.   Also, the kraken is strong, but not a complete game changer. It's really only strong if you can push with it so that the enemy has to split its focus. I played a game yesterday where my other teammates were killed and the enemy started on the Kraken. I was really low in health, but a well placed skill shot got me the last hit and we got the kraken.   I high-tailed it out of there because I was dead if they so much as breathed on me. The enemy team was able to focus the kraken and killed it before it even took out the first turret."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,ThreeBlindMice_7,2,Sat Jul 11 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"As you move up and builds get better, a whole team can take down Kraken in a few seconds. Ninjaing gets a bit more common... and really, the only places they'll go to steal Kraken from you are the tri bushes, which you can easily mine for vision."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,iaortega657,3,Sat Jul 11 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"There are a few tips to go about this    Taking on the Kraken immediately after wiping out a team, especially in the late game when regen time is longer. Well placed Ardan ult Have high dps heroes attacking while another hero checks the immediate area for enemies (and if the enemy team isn't that skilled, have that scout run away from the Kraken as bait and distraction) Petal's seeds, flares, Contraption for vision and much more   And /u/ReamusLQ  is spot on: you only have yourself to blame if it gets stolen from you."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,KingQuet90,4,Sun Jul 12 05:58:20 2015 UTC,If the Kraken is stolen from your team you probably shouldn't have been going for the Kraken.
vainglorygame,3cx27a,BlackCaesar,2,Sat Jul 11 19:09:10 2015 UTC,"Kracken itself seems a bit too powerful but I think it makes sense in the context of this being a mobile game. At 20mins an ace and a Kracken usually lets you finish out the game, so it's nice have a defensive strategy if the agreeing team doesn't take proper precautions on set up."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,ReamusLQ,4,Sat Jul 11 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"As I said above, it's only powerful if you can push with it. If the team sends it in alone, the enemy can easily kill it before it even kills a turret (assuming later game when they have their builds mostly done)."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,ackshunpact,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:18:32 2015 UTC,"Don't do kraken when its possible you can get aced/stolen. Actually don't do kraken most times, unless you need it to push down the last two towers.  Really, if you only manage to destroy one tower that's giving your opponent 500g for the 300g you get for the tower,not counting for player kills while contesting it."
vainglorygame,3cx27a,Jajajack14,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:08:25 2015 UTC,"As another note, typically stolen krackens occur by one enemy. After that, assuming your team focuses and kills him, you now have a 2v3. The enemy won't be able to escort a kracken 2v3, which results in an easy kill for you and a free 1500 team gold. If all three of the enemies come and steal it, well, you shouldn't have tried in the first place."

vainglorygame,3cwhp5,Elxroid,2,Sat Jul 11 10:55:24 2015 UTC,"Your suggestions would make it even harder for higher ranked players to climb when there are already posts about how little rank is gained when advancing I the higher tiers.   Also by ""ranked xp"" I assume you are referring to their rating. It's not really ""experience points"" like in RPGs. And are you familiar with how the Elo system works? To th best of my knowledge, SEMC is using a modified Elo system that does take into account the disparity in ratings between the two teams as well as throwing in some game skewing based on an individual's performance.  Matchmaking in MOBAs is something I've been thinking about for a while, and it's a very tricky problem, that I don't think any MOBA has solved yet. A lot of games just use a basic Elo system that only takes into account wins and losses and rating discrepancies, and that only works if you have extremely large number of played games to analyze. I like that SEMC is experimenting with skewing the Rating adjustments based on a player's stats in a game, but I think it could be taken further.  I've been working on my own match making system that completely ignores wins and losses, and it seems to be doing pretty well at predicting outcomes for matches."

It could be gold earned, it could be damage taken divided by deaths, it could be KDA, it could be objectives taken, it could be something else, or a combination of some/all of these. Whatever it is, I think it's a smart move not to reveal it so the player focus on playing the game, not gaming the system."

Secondly you can try mobizen. I believe is has the option to mirror through wifi now. It's basically a mirroring option for andriod but can be frustrating to figure out.

Maybe I should dream about being a doctor and I'd get super good at that and actually be of use in this world. No way! Too many heroes still to learn!"

vainglorygame,3cv6i8,solid77,3,Sat Jul 11 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"This. In solo queue i dont go in expecting to play whatever i want to try. I just fill the role left from the two instalockers ( usually taka and krull this week) And even if you do have a good team comp, good luck on your taka sharing the jungle or knowing what an igc does. I played as a cath the other day with a vox and taka against a skaarf, vox, and ringo. We were humiliated."
vainglorygame,3cv6i8,b0nGj00k,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:43:39 2015 UTC,"People should be forced to watch an informational video describing the igc before playing their first match.   Edit: And also yeah, never quick lock in on a character. I usually soft lock until I see everyone else have done the same or a hard lock."
vainglorygame,3cv6i8,ogurin,3,Sat Jul 11 05:31:41 2015 UTC,"In general, locking in before your teammates says one of two things: ""I can only play THIS character,"" or ""I don't care about team composition."" If #1 isn't true, then I assume #2 and pick whatever I feel like. And it can still work! I've won in (and been beaten by) teams of all jungle or all lane plenty of times, working together and playing smart can overcome any team comp disadvantage :)"
vainglorygame,3cv6i8,NespreSilver,2,Sat Jul 11 13:12:10 2015 UTC,It's ok not to have a ranged laner. Just go up and clear the wave from time to time.
vainglorygame,3cv6i8,GEOpdx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:15:48 2015 UTC,"Two junglers and a support can be a good comp as long as you work together. Try pushing the jungle hard to force the laner to spend more time out of lane. Take the mines to put more pressure on their turrets. If the laner is in lane, and they're moving forward, rotate up together for a gank.  If that doesn't fit your play style, pick your hero last so that you can make a comp that works for you."

vainglorygame,3ct5sp,FinndBors,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:59:07 2015 UTC,It really is. Ridiculous in solo queue for ranked. I've gone from SA silver to Hotness bronze and my loss/win ratio has increased for some reason.
vainglorygame,3ct5sp,Sa10aep,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Another very possible reason: the influx of new players (must be big, since it seems to have played a part in the big outage).

vainglorygame,3ct5sp,BlueSentinels,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:21:32 2015 UTC,A lot of stuff isn't balanced in these early stages of the game so you'll find a lot of strange comps the higher you go.

vainglorygame,3ct2oc,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting. If it gave you the deserter screen, it sounds like a bug. You might want to send an email to support with your in game name and the time of the match to help them track the issue."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,eh-blank-space,17,Thu Jul 9 21:09:09 2015 UTC,I definitely want to put together a challenge map for playing support and another for playing with a support
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,Kraken_SEMC,3,Fri Jul 10 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't be bad at all. Even though we have got an IGC video. I was playing Cath today in ranked solo and went jungle with koshka. She was waiting on a minion to spawn, at the beginning of the game. She saw me standing there and spammed ? All over me, then when the minion appeared I hit it, and pinged the green mark, she got the last hit. And gave me a thumbs up ping. She then proceeded to wait for my instruction and we farmed together, I think she realised how support works. That game we all had negative K/D and our team went 26 kills against 37 for the other team. But we still won it. So yes, I would love to see a support video made, 'cause that would help not only support, but junglers and laners too!"
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,PsychoProject,3,Thu Jul 9 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like those who choose to play support generally have a decent understanding of the game.  It's definitely not the most glorious role, and I think most new players prefer ADC/APC characters compared to playing characters who have to ""babysit.""  I often play support because I wait to lock-in last, but it gets really frustrating sometimes.  Nothing worse than saving your team from death multiple times, only to have them rush back in and then die because they suddenly have a little bit more health.  Or even more frustrating, helping the team get a wipe, head to their crystal, and realize that your team has all backed or is taking minion mines, while you can only hack away at a turret for 60 damage a pop because you built all defense. (This just happened in a game...we wiped the enemy team three times, and each time my team fell back and did nothing instead of ending the game...it was a 40 minute game before we finally lost)...sorry, still salty about that one."

vainglorygame,3cpzx4,jatatcdc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:20:19 2015 UTC,Do you mean IGC in particular? There's a tutorial video for that. I think the jungled needs to understand it just as much.
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,peterkeats,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah but video tutorials are not forced tutorials. Having even more forced tutorials might not be a great idea, but IGC should at least be mentioned in one of the other tutorials.  I hate getting pinged right from the start, just because our jungler doesn't understand that I'm not going for his creeps."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,Galef,0,Fri Jul 10 12:17:18 2015 UTC,This was going to be my question as well. There's a ton more to being a good support than using IGC though.

vainglorygame,3cpzx4,Swinerat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:15:34 2015 UTC,I think it would be similar to Gold Rush which you can practice last hitting.
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,BlueDmon,0,Thu Jul 9 22:36:43 2015 UTC,At least in gold rush you can do things. How would a support tutorial work? By waiting for some bot to finish a monster?
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,Swinerat,0,Thu Jul 9 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"Man I agree. When I download a game I want to play the real deal as soon as possible, not go through a bunch of tutorials."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,dizzyhomie,0,Fri Jul 10 03:49:05 2015 UTC,Played as support for the first time today...did not go well. Followed the rec. build order + IGC

vainglorygame,3cpzx4,baaallllllin,-4,Fri Jul 10 20:12:03 2015 UTC,If support rushes warhorn can we put them on 72 hr cool down?  Or just permaban?   Any objections?
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,xmaveric,0,Fri Jul 10 02:20:40 2015 UTC,Warhorn is very viable for support. I'm sorry that you feel your way of building support is the only way.
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,adyendrus,2,Fri Jul 10 03:39:17 2015 UTC,"He specifically said ""rushes Warhorn"" which isn't as bad as it used to be, but isn't great by any stretch of the imagination!  A 72 hour ban seems appropriate. ;)"
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,xmaveric,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:26:59 2015 UTC,I submit to you that I've saved more teammates with an early Warhorn than with an early fountain/crucible/atlas. I've also caused more aces.
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,adyendrus,3,Fri Jul 10 13:45:08 2015 UTC,"I really like Warhorn. I'm not a huge fan of it as a first item, because the recipe is too expensive for the passive that it grants. However, there is a comp that I've speculated on before that uses Warhorn. Maybe someday it will become a thing."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,baaallllllin,2,Fri Jul 10 14:29:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. Warhorn gives great utility but as a first item rarely makes sense.
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,xmaveric,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:59:41 2015 UTC,That's a great point. But Warhorn makes it like every team has a Fortress! :-)
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,baaallllllin,0,Tue Jul 14 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"Of course it's viable.  When ""rushed"" it's pretty terrible.  When I see it on solo queue I know the ping war is coming and our jungler is going to get starved."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,louche_goose,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:42:10 2015 UTC,"Soooooo, let's just say some noob wanted some help here....  What do I...I mean the noob... need to rush as a support? Clockwork? Health? Crucible?  I'm asking for a friend.  On a related note: why is support given such a low status, I'm really enjoying support Fortress lately."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,ThreeBlindMice_7,3,Fri Jul 10 13:16:38 2015 UTC,"In my experience, rushing a Fountain or an Atlas, but only an Atlas in very rare cases, will give you the best results. From there, add a Crucible if they have at least one effective stun, an Atlas if the enemy team is attack speed based or has at least one devastating carry who is attack speed based, or another Fountain. Flares and mines need to be bought throughout."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,baaallllllin,2,Fri Jul 10 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"There's no one to one right answer. (I made the warhorn comment bc I've had innumerable Catherine's rush warhorn then starve jungler).    Early you need to give vision (scout traps mainly) every game. That's the only constant.   I don't usually ""rush"" anything when I support. In general,  t1 & t2 pieces of cooldown and fountain are logical choices. If a team is heavily weapon power then I'll try to get an atlas pauldron asap.   I think the lowly view of support is because most people prefer to be the rockstar with 20 kills. It usually doesn't show on scoreboard, but support can be the most important role.   Hope this helps...I'd offer more advice but I'm not exactly a support guru."
vainglorygame,3cpzx4,louche_goose,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll keep this in mind as I support my way back up the ranks...."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,LuceAurum,14,Sat Jul 11 03:48:56 2015 UTC,"It's already been said in the comments, but you're really exaggerating this.    SEMC is a company; employees need to get paid.  Taka was given out for free for Android users who pre-registered, and as much as I like Apple, Android probably doubled or tripled VainGlory's audience. That is a lot of Takas (see every other post on the front page of the subreddit).  Skins are purely optional. 100% not required. Only cosmetic.  Tier 1 can be bought with ICE, so you don't have to go all out, $100, to show some support for SEMC.  Want to help the devs more and have extra money? Get a higher tier skin.  Skins, in my opinion, act more as way to show players that you're committed to this game and support SEMC.  People that buy heroes during Early Access are typically good players, so when the hero is released, SEMC can have access to data on how games are doing with (experimental) and without (control) the new hero, although I do not know if they do in fact do this.  If cards weren't consumable, then common cards wouldn't have a purpose. In the current system, if cards carried over, a player would just need to buy an entire Glory Box and be done with half of all the skins."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,iaortega657,-2,Sat Jul 11 05:55:28 2015 UTC,"Hi! thanks for taking the time to rebutle! So, SEMC is a company, that is a fact. And skins are purely optional, that is also a fact. Now, the biggest thing with Early Access is that Taka, Skaarf and Ardan had no such thing. Then Vox came and it was a 4 day EA period, followed Fortress and Rona on a 7 day EA period. The way SEMC is changing it's treatment of consumers is worrisome to me. I did suggest in my text that maybe to compensate for EA, new heroes are launched at the 10k glory mark, some people on the forums have even gone and said 14K, and 2 or 3 weeks later it goes down to 8k. I feel this is a better model, as people who will buy the hero will buy him/her no matter what, and people who can't buy the hero and maybe don't have a means to keep injecting money in their store accounts have a means to grind for them. I love that you bought a shirt man! It's a great way to support them. But my problem with the ICE boxes is that We had the devs on stream come out and say how good the system is, and how much they've impoved the way we can complete our sets... and that's just not true. I did a little math on the forums, but to condense it all in a reply: The Glory Box only gives you 2 out of the 6 necessary legendary cards, meaning you need to by 2 full glory boxes, and get lucky with the 3rd one to get all the necessary cards. Lets average that to 2 and a half glory boxes, okay? So 749 (glory cost) * 50 (2 full boxes and one half box) = roughly 37.450 glory in total to get one tier 3 skin. To put that number in perspective, if we were to play for win 63 games in a row for 21 days (in a way that evenly distributes the Glory dailies), we'd have 8.1k glory. Sp by doing 37.450/ 8100 means that it'd take more 4.6 weeks and a couple more days to get that much glory. That averages out to around 2 months for only 1 tier 3 skin, excluding the Karma bonus and double glory weekends. So you can do that, or drop USD$ 100.00... that's a pretty steep grind, and it's very daunting for the average consumer that would've otherwise spent around 20-50 USD$ on a tier. I think that price range, being more accessible, would generate much better sales for SEMC, than the currently saturated USD$ 100.00."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,hlprmnky,5,Sat Jul 11 08:13:37 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of assumptions about who the ""average consumer"" is, how much people will or won't spend on something they enjoy, and the majority perception of an ICE-only early access that don't seem to have any actual research or data backing them up. I suspect, given only my own limited and anecdotal evidence as backing, that most of these assumptions are wrong, with the consequences you would expect that to imply for the arguments you derive from them.  You also seem to proceed from the presumption that everyone should be able to get a tier 3 skin quickly and either easily or cheaply; I'm going to suggest that neither SEMC nor the player base at large wants that. Seeing a t3 skin in the wild should mean something. Owning one should mean something. Otherwise, why would SEMC spend all that time and money lovingly crafting them for us to drool over?"
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,iaortega657,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:00:26 2015 UTC,Exactly. Scarcity adds value to a product. There is prestige in owning a tier 3 and awe in seeing one.
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,iOSJunkie,2,Sun Jul 12 05:39:46 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people are dropping serious coin on new heroes and skins. I don't believe these people are suckers, but want to support for SEMC and have sweet skin.   If players are paying the current prices, why should SEMC lower them?"
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,iaortega657,-2,Sat Jul 11 13:37:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not calling people suckers, I'm trying to raise awareness to the fact that from patch 1.3 onward SEMC has been slowly adopting more exclusive business practices to the pay-only side of their market. I'm trying to bring forth an agruement that a more consumer friendly practice could generate more prosperty on both the side of consumer as well as SEMC. If you would like, I can go into further detail, but I also recommend reading some of my other replies, if only to save me a little bit of Ctrl C, Ctrl V time :)"
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,DeafSmithVG,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:25:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't buy a shirt. Please use paragraphs or bullet points. I've read your post and comments, and while it doesn't hurt your argument, it would have been much better to do so considering your audience is against what you are presenting. Is a company allowed to change? Do they need to retroactively give Taka, Skaarf, and Ardan and Early Access so they can be in good conscious with Early Access for new heroes? Your basing your argument on the assumption that SEMC created Early Access because they are... Super Evil. My opinion is that they aren't, but there is a small chance that they are, and your entire post is held by this assumption. You said that it takes an average of 2 months to get a tier 3 skin. Well, for players that have been with VainGlory since launch, they either have all the heroes or all the heroes they are interested in. So now they have a new goal in mind. I'm not a game developer, but it seems obvious that you need to keep the player busy if you are going for a long lasting game (see CoC). Don't forget that Card Boxes do not contain only the cards necessary for a single skin, but also for other heroes. So that $100 might be for the first tier 3 skin, but subsequent skins will be cheaper. You really do need to take into account karma bonuses, double (and triple!) glory weekends, and the Sinister Seven bonus to get an accurate figure. Your calculations gives a max rather than an accurate figure. It would be like finding out how much Christmas is going to cost you, basing your total costs on pre-Black Friday prices and ignoring shipping, taxes, and other fees. I'm really interested on how you got the average amount a consumer is willing to spend on a tier. Not being mean at all. Is this number based on other mobile games? PC MOBAs? Skins or various IAPs? Buying a tier 3 skin is not for the average consumer. It's for the hardcore fan, the YouTuber showing skin gameplay, the people dedicated to the game. The average consumer that wants the skin but can't buy the skin is able to get the skin through dedication and insta-locking SAW or Taka rage-pinging decent skill."

I bought a few skins for both my accounts, happily to support SEMC.  I admit, i am Deaf and unable to hear  or judge the PR/Stream stuff outside of BrokenMyth liveblogs.."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,jklick,-2,Sat Jul 11 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry about your condition man, the stream is incredibly fun to watch. Maybe once youtube gets a hold on their CC option you'll have the chance to watch the stream on the Vainglory Casual channel a couple hours after it's over!  So, onto the ""It's still not pay to win"". I've argued about this on the forums, but not here. The text I posted isn't supposed to be a trade off between PTW and grossly over charge, in fact, I'd go so far as to argue that a MOBA can never be PTW, as MOBAS are inherently competitive in nature. The moment ompetition on how big your wallet is, then you are not going to sell a game! you will not have the 99% end of the spectrum customers to buy your products, and when the 99% shifts to a new game that offers better retail price and value, that 1% of people that pay tons of money will shift as well because the community for said game will become quasi-in-existent. What I did try to put forth is that us consumers are getting an extremely anti-value deal with ICE and glory boxes, and in the last couple of paragraphs I actually try to give some suggestions as to how to better the current consumer/producer relationship. Selling 1 tier 3 skin for US$ 100.00 is extremely taxing on a lot of the customer base, as very few people have the means to justify dropping more than US$ 100.00 on a tier. Sure, it's better than the old system, where we only had a completely random chance to get a card that MAYBE was part of the tier set, but it's still extremely swayed. I'm not saying ""Why not let people drop loads of money on cosmetic items"", rather, why are we letting this happen? When MOBAs on the PC market charge at most US$ 10.00 for a new skin? I get that it's a different platform, but it's the same genre and same payment models."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,hlprmnky,8,Sat Jul 11 07:51:42 2015 UTC,"I thought with the title of being a bad business you meant that you were worried they would lose money and eventually fold (I sure as hell do hope not). I mean everything in the game can be obtained for free, the game is not pay-to-win, and skins are optional and only cosmetic. I've enjoyed the game since the Android beta without spending a cent (though I plan on buying a skin for Joule once Google Play lets me (error within the app)) so I have no qualms with how SEMC runs its business."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,Zaggaz,2,Sat Jul 11 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the post turned out to be a long winded complaint with some potential solutions tacked on at the end. It doesn't look like he has SEMC's best interest in mind, only his (and the ""consumers"")."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,safetywerd,-2,Sat Jul 11 10:04:01 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/jklick ! I'm sorry that's what you got from the text :( I'm not an native english speaker, nor was trying to be long winded.  In regards to not looking after SEMCs best intrest, a good consumer/ producer relationship is absolutely in SEMCs best intrest. When i mean anti-value, it's actually scewed towards SEMC and not the consumer. The main point of the post is that a lot of what is currently being added to the game is inaccessible to the majority of people that maybe can't justify USD$ 100.00 skins, or feel as if they are being punished for not buying ICE to support the devs and the game. In various replies, here and on the forums, I went into further detail, and even math, to explain why lowering that daunting price down would help out not only with the inclusion of people willing to pay, but also with the sales that SEMC can gain from it. I currently think that SEMC is charging their Supply much more than the Demand is willing to offer, and price adjustment, along with better value on our purchases, leads to better sales. If you would like for me to go futher into detail on that side of the subject, I'd be more than willing too, but thank you anyways for at least reading the text and going into the suggestions area. I see a lot of people replying that perhaps hadn't read that part, and it's good to hear that even though you disagree, you at least took the time to read.  As to /u/devlindisguise , I'm sorry you were mislead by the title, and my response being so late, the forums are much more active than I though they would've been. I actually thought most of the traffic would be here on Reddit. So in the edit above, I adressed the ""At least it's not PTW"" argument, but since you posted before the first edit, I'll copy it for you: The ""It's not Pay to Win though"" argument. So, since I've been replying to his same arguement here, on the forums and on /r/vainglory these past few hours, my counter for this is: It's actually a logical fallacy to think ""Well, companies need to overcharge their PRODUCT X, because otherwise they'd have to make the game PTW to compensate!"". That's a big no-no. MOBAS can't be PTW by nature. If the only competition on how big your wallet is, then you are not going to sell a game! you will not have the 99% end of the spectrum customers to buy your products, and when the 99% shifts to a new game that offers better retail price and value, that 1% of people that pay tons of money will shift as well because the community for said game will become quasi-in-existent. We see this on a very similair scale in MMORPG servers. Most people pay to play for the social aspect, but when their guild leaves or their community transfers to another server, sometimes people leave the game, most of the time they follow the community.  I'm not here trying to tell SEMC how to run their business, or tell us consumers what we should or should not support. But I am voicing my opinion in that every update has generated more anti-value, whether it be longer waits on EA heroes, the current box system, the rng involved in said systems, etc. I think that as a consumer, even though the game is FTP, we still have the voice to say ""this isn't okay"" or ""these boxes aren't filling the purpose in which they were being marketed as"". It's really just my opinion, and the best thing about us people is that we can agree to disagree!"
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,jatatcdc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:28:23 2015 UTC,"I understand that ""zomg $100 skin!"" is a really easy talking point for your argument, but I really don't think SEMC intends for people to spend $100 to get any particular tier 2 skin - though I'm sure that if someone has that money to burn, and wants a certain skin right meow, they wouldn't be turned away at the shop door.  Spending a huge sum of money on ICE is the only way to guarantee that you get the cards you want on the schedule you want, but there's another way to get those cards too - actually playing Vainglory."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,iOSJunkie,11,Sun Jul 12 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more. SEMC has every right, and in fact needs to find ways to monetize the game to the best of their ability. The simple fact that there is absolutely no pay-to-win in this game is all you need to know that they are dedicated to making a fantastic game with a level playing field. I have been able to afford Taka, Ardan, Vox, Celeste, Fortress and Rona as soon as they were available with only Glory from actively playing. They are certainly not too expensive. Also, there is nothing forcing you to buy a skin. If it's too expensive for you, so what? Let those with more money available for such things to spend it on something purely cosmetic like skins. Personally, I really wanted to support the game that has given me many hours of joy, but skins were of little interest to me, so I ordered some Tshirts. I just want to help support this Dev team any way I can, and try to keep them successful for a very long time. Just imagine, if this masterpiece is just their first game, what might come next?"

And yes, you actually can afford all new heroes with glory when they come out! I did the math in my post, were it takes 63 evenly distributed games across 21 days to get 8.1k glory, excluding the karma bonus and double glory weekend. This is actually swayed in the consumers favor, as us dedicated fans will not only always have enough glory from winning at least 3 games a day, but we'll also have some spare glory depending on the karma levels!  So, in conclusion, I'm not trying to say ""this game sucks"" or ""SEMC is a money whore!"" I'm trying to point out, especially in the last couple paragraphs of my original post, that consumer benifits directly lead to developer benefits, but when the Devs make teir 3 skins cost three digits of USD$, then it alienates a large base of the consumer that would've otherwise spent around 20-50 USD$ on a tier."
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,divergence-aloft,7,Sat Jul 11 07:59:24 2015 UTC,"Well, you win for posting the dumbest thing I've read so far today, but I'm about to head over to a bunch of right wing blogs to read what they have to say about Bernie Sanders, so that glory might be short lived.  So, let's see, we have a game that is free to play, hero's that you can unlock through not a lot of grinding, skins that you can unlock after an epic shit ton of grinding.  Skins aren't an enhancement of abilities, so they are completely optional and totally unnecessary to play or to achieve the highest pinnacle of play.  So, at no point during play, are you required to fork over your burger king paycheck to play at any skill level.  Yes, there is a period of exclusivity for new heroes.  A whole entire week.  Sweet jesus what are they thinking??"
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,Koozaza,-2,Sat Jul 11 05:06:10 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/safetywerd , sorry that we disagree to point of you insulting my text and I, but I feel as if I need to clarify myself in regards to this post.  So, your first point is that the game is FTP, yes? A game being free to play doesn't mean its not bullet proof to criticism. If that were the case then all other MOBAS on PC are also immune, along with other free to play apps on the App Store. We are still consuming a product, and as consumers we need to always try to point out to the producers when either the quality of the product is subpar, it if the product itself is not worth the price that is presented. Us consumers need to keep a healthy relationship with the devs to make sure that both sides are always prospering!  The grind to unlock heroes is actually swayed in the consumers favor! Like is said in my post, If we were to maximize these to geting 3 wins a day, for 21 days, we would get 8100k glory! And that's without considering double glory weekend or the karma bonuses we get! So we could, on new accounts, always buy a new 8k hero every 21 days and have 1k glory left over. I also never argued the necessity of skins, but rather that we have devs come on twich and stream, and tell us how good the new ICE or glory boxes will be, but that's just not true. In comparison to getting a random chance to get a card, yes, it's an improvement, but it's not a deal us consumers should be thrilled about or defending. A little math I did over on the forums, and on a reply a here a couple minutes ago tells us to some extent how big the grind is for one teir 3 skin. And it averages out to 2 months of getting all single win dailies, triple win dailies, and sinister sevens in that time period. Thats considering every game we get a card from the same tier 3 set, and excluding karma bonuses and double/triple glory weekends. It's incredibly daunting for the average consumer to grind that long for one 1 tier 3 skin, and it's either that or drop USD$ 100.00 on an ICE box. Onto exclusivity, the biggest thing with Early Access is that Taka, Skaarf and Ardan had no such thing. Then Vox came and it was a 4 day EA period, followed Fortress and Rona on a 7 day EA period. The way SEMC is changing it's treatment of consumers is worrisome to me. I did suggest in my text that maybe to compensate for EA, new heroes are launched at the 10k glory mark, some people on the forums have even gone and said 14K, and 2 or 3 weeks later it goes down to 8k. I feel this is a better model, as people who will buy the hero will buy him/her no matter what, and people who can't buy the hero and maybe don't have a means to keep injecting money in their store accounts have a means to grind for them.  All in all, I'm not trying to start a riot, or boycott, or anything. I do really love this game. But the biggest thing is that SEMC have been adopting more anti-consumer business practices every update, and we as consumers, fans, or casual followers need to keep a healthy relationship with the devs to make sure that both sides are always prospering!"
vainglorygame,3cvmuq,Koozaza,7,Sat Jul 11 08:30:10 2015 UTC,"I, like many other, legitimately worry about SEMC under monetizing. It's the first time I've ever worried that about a company.

You seemed to ramble for a while and then say something ridiculous. I don't mean to insult you, but this was a terribly phrased argument.

I should say that my main point here is not to try to start a riot, but rather encourage a better consumer/producer buisness practice. It's somewhat infuriating when the devs go on stream and market the new Ice box or glory box system to us as if it were anything but anti-consumer. In replies on the forums I did do more math relevant to sales or how much grinding is necessary, etc."

It was very helpful advice because I was in the same spot as you as a support! You might have had a bad couple of teammates this particular time.

Support will take all of the hits for Taka and really just wants Taka to get Level 6 ASAP.   I stopped using my Stormguard when I use Cath support so I don't accidentally get a last hit.

It is shortsighted to try to get the supporting if the jungle. Yes you miss out on XP, but you get 25% more gold if your support first hits with IGC.  I do need my support to drop plenty of mines.

I carried my butt off, and died right at the end securing the Ace after taking both Vain turrets. I thought I had the game of my life. After the game, my allies add me. Getting There. Decent-ish. I took screenshots. I was shocked. I gained zero elo from that match. I couldn't even see a pixel move in my rank bar.  I think too few people in PoA are willing to play solo, so we get matched down.  TL;DR: I had the same experience as you."

So could theoretically match from Hotness gold to POA gold.  But even if it was a team...  if it was SA bronze and 2 POA bronze, average is about SA silver. SA silver is within 1 tier Hotness gold. I don't know what they were. I'm just trying to apply what I think I know about the matching algorithm.   So yeah it kinda sucks, but ELO loss was probably minimal. I may have even been on your team?"

I don't mind the ELO loss but it just seemed an example of ranked being not what it was supposed to be. I expected to play with other Hotness players against Hotness, SA, and PG players.   In response to you being on my team, I doubt it. I partied with two Hotness Golds I had never played with who spent the entire matching rage pinging each other and myself. You seem like a really nice person and highly doubt either one of them was you :)."

If so, then yeah, it's Bluetooth. Does it act the same when paired with a different Bluetooth device while you play?  The obvious... Have you tried rebooting everything (your router, your device, etc.)? Maybe try unpairing and re-pairing you headphones?"
vainglorygame,3cryt1,grawrz,3,Fri Jul 10 08:04:13 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend always getting a fountain. The passive keeps your health topped up because you don't have lifesteal, and the active is great for team fights. It also gives you nice amount of shield and some armour so it's the kind of item that works against any team comp.  After that... yes, all the defence you really need is HP and your bubble. But no, I wouldn't recommend getting WP/CP if you're playing her as a support. Cooldown acceleration is your friend, and a double hourglass plus boots is my favourite early game build.  Warhorn is a solid choice, but I wouldn't rush it. Ideally you'd want a stormguard banner once Kraken is up, and if you're doing particularly well you can finish the warhorn. It doesn't benefit you that much until you start going for towers and taking/defending kraken.  Also traps. Lots of scout traps. It doesn't matter how good your build is if your team has no wision."
vainglorygame,3cryt1,Twiggled,2,Fri Jul 10 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"Realistically as support, in this case Catherine, all you're really expected to contribute is your stun, silence, and defensive support items. I strongly suggest that you never build a metal jacket or atlas, since those items only benefit yourself. Instead I'd focus on building at least one fountain and at least one crucible, in order to have items to activate to save your team. If the game gets late and you have a lot of money, you can even invest in a clockwork for more energy and more frequent stuns.  Edit: Pauldrons are awesome too! Oops!"
vainglorygame,3cryt1,Jajajack14,3,Fri Jul 10 08:47:01 2015 UTC,why shouldn't you build an atlas? your team can benefit higly because of it. It can change a fight.
vainglorygame,3cryt1,Lensjo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:57:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I actually left that out unintentionally. I personally (when laning or jungle carry) Prefer a fountain in most all cases except Vs Krul (then let's break out the pauldrons).. Pauldron just slows down their damage, while fountains give me life. That's just what I'm used to though, to some pauldros are the way to go as well!"

vainglorygame,3cryt1,solid77,2,Fri Jul 10 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"Buy team defence first: Crucible, Fountain or Atlas Pauldron depending if you are up against e.g. Adagio, or other combos. Atlas is great against anybody who relies on basic attacks. You might even want to get two of them, depending on your opponents.  And Clockwork helps, but I would add it rather later than earlier. Maybe an early chronograph."
vainglorygame,3cryt1,theSDRexperiment,2,Fri Jul 10 09:32:50 2015 UTC,"Cath rarely needs extra CP or WP. The only time she may is if you are not getting Aces due to a high-HP support, and nobody on your team has a build to take them down, then you consider getting Aftershock.   High HP is great to have. But 2 x Fountain may be situationally better than a Fountain + Crucible. I usually buy more HP when I find that I am getting focus-killed for some reason, so 2 x Crucible or Crucible + Shiversteel.   The worst is when you build a great support Cath but your teammates don't build effective damage. Like, they all go CP and the other team all built Aegis."
vainglorygame,3cryt1,peterkeats,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:18:47 2015 UTC,"I always buy Warhorn and Crucible as Catherine. Usually when were about to die in a teamfight that we have no chance of winning, I activate crucible then Warhorn, works 95% of the time especially with a fountain."

She's a very well-rounded tanky support and her stun is amazing whether you're using it to catch someone that's overextended, peel for a teammate, or just lock down their sniper in a team fight. Strong at engaging and disengaging, exactly what I look for in a moba hero."
vainglorygame,3co8ow,Skua09,3,Thu Jul 9 13:31:22 2015 UTC,I agree.   Though recently the glitches with her are insane.. I coudn't stun more than HALF of the time I tried to stun :(
vainglorygame,3co8ow,UniqueRaj,10,Thu Jul 9 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"No one has mentioned Krul and I believe its because people do not build him correctly.  The standard everyday builds you see are silly rush tornado trigger to build stacks for his B ability.   The real way to play Krul is to rush Shiversteel, and a counter build tanky item then Offensive items : youre a tank and an assassin."
vainglorygame,3co8ow,paredesacc,6,Thu Jul 9 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"A tanky Krul is just about impossible to *kill.  I (personally) rush Breaking Point, then build 2-3 defensive items (usually Crucible and either Aegis or Metal Jacket/Atlas Pauldron depending on opposing team comp).  Krul is all about sustaining in a fight and tons of armor/shield make it near impossible to burst him down, then add to that his burst health regen and Krul does very nicely."
vainglorygame,3co8ow,Logic_85,4,Thu Jul 9 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"Just as a little extra tip, since armor and shield increase Krul's EHP they synergies really well with his vamp and healing. Health on the other hand doesn't do much for him, and should only be built for actives/passives associated with the item."
vainglorygame,3co8ow,jatatcdc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:03:43 2015 UTC,Good point - I only build health for the crucible/aegis.  The armor/shield goes a lot farther than the health for Krul.

vainglorygame,3co8ow,paredesacc,2,Thu Jul 9 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"The boss feeling when you 1v3 the entire team. And blocking someone's Ult with your Ult like 'STFU and let me get my stacks'  Okay now I need help with one thing. Can someone explain the Krul vs Krul mechanics? Considering both the Kruls have same build and it's a pure 1v1, what would be the mechanics that you use? What I can think of is timing your DMR barrier when the other Krul redeems his stacks. What else? I have problems surviving early to mid game. Krul gets bursted too fast.  My usual build path in order: Blazing Salvo T1 shoes Another Blazing Salvo (farming is so fast with attack cancelling!) Chronograph Shiversteel Clockwork Situational defensive item T2 boots T3 boots/infusions  It's a great late game build (almost invincible, barring stun+burst) but I usually start the game 0-3, 0-4 etc. Insight?"
vainglorygame,3co8ow,Vet24,2,Fri Jul 10 14:29:11 2015 UTC,Its simple : don't rush Salvo first.  You should easily be able to get 2-3 kills within the first 5 mins / early game.  Start out with oakheart and then grab boots.  Enemy laner pushes too far?  Jump out for a kill.  Let me know what you think!
vainglorygame,3co8ow,paredesacc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:08:47 2015 UTC,I'll give it a try. But how would you get the stacks to get a kill?  I know using Krul's heroic perk helps with sticking but you need a long time to get sufficient stacks if you start with Oakheart.  I usually avoid engaging till I reach level 6. I don't have confidence until I have a medium build.
vainglorygame,3co8ow,Vet24,2,Fri Jul 10 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"Your early game krul with just oakheart and boots will be much stronger than most enemies at that stage.  Don't worry about stacks, just hide in brush, dead mans rush, and then throw a few stacks on, use boots to finish them off with a smite.  Just play around with it and you'll get a feel."
vainglorygame,3co8ow,paredesacc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, yes with heroic perk and boots sprint, I should get enough stacks to finish. Sounds doable. I will try."

Chacet did a good job summing up why he the premier laner in the game.   Jungle - Taka. His burst damage is unmatched.

vainglorygame,3co8ow,chacet,3,Thu Jul 9 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorta new at mobas, what's a Poke and a silence"
vainglorygame,3co8ow,chacet,4,Thu Jul 9 13:21:18 2015 UTC,A poke is when you can harass an enemy with out taking damage back. His A is a dive and fire two auto attacks making it a poke as you can dive away from the target to poke. and a His ultimate is a Silence when he hits the enemy team with his ultimate they are unable to activate items or use ability's for a brief time.

vainglorygame,3co8ow,Lebrontasaurus,3,Thu Jul 9 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"I love Skaarf and Ardan very much. Skaarf is cool because every single one of his moves requires aiming and takes increasingly better reflexes to deal damage and survive as you climb higher and higher in tiers. Im not saying he's the best hero, but he is by far the most rewarding damage dealer by difficulty in my opinion. And then Ardo is awesome because of his unique A and C abilities. I have a friend named Decayless who I queue with often, never met in real life. But when we're in the enemies team top bushes, Ill signal OMW under their turret and Decayless will, as Taka, go into his box, light up their carry, and then right before the last turret attack gets him, I vanguard him and he slips away unharmed. Its fun maneuvers like that is why Ardan is so intriguing to play with for me! Also with enough experience, Ive gotten to the point where I can stun an incoming Skaarf ult or Joule button with the positioning of my gauntlet, and THAT feels pretty cool too me. Also being able to lock down objectives while we capture them is also a handy little utility to have with the Gauntlet."

I build zero damage items on him and he's a beast of a tank for the team.  What I like most about him is ip the flexibility of his kit. Pretty much all of his abilities can be used as an escape or an engage. He's got CC. He's got sustain. As long as he's buddied up with a teammate, he doesn't really need damage."

With all the tankiness, I would get to high BP stacks and I almost took out the entire opposing team! They used to target my teammates first and most of the times I would end up as the last man standing."

Neither takes contract even, and they fight for last hits continuously and smiley ping when the other dies   I know there are good Saw players out there, but this is why I have to queue dodge Saw instalockers.  I know I should Shinkaigen them to glory for whatever, but it's just not worth it.  I'd rather queue dodge them and eat the cool down timer.  P.S.

It will be called ""Karm Uh???"" and will depend on how infrequently you use the ? ping in an aggressive or derogatory manner.  Fun side story: I played as Vox last night and had a bit of stuttery lag in the enemy base that I'm sure made me look real dumb.

vainglorygame,3cr7r5,ogurin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:09:02 2015 UTC,"I've had the most success with weapon builds. Rush sorrowblade while building a salvo and boots along the way. Attack speed reduces the cooldown on your B, so a clockwork is unnecessary considering Joule rarely has energy issues anyways.   Next, build a serpent mask or tyrant monocle. I prefer serpent mask because you get lifesteal with her B as well, but her B can crit as well, so both items are nice. Finish up your salvo into a tornado trigger, bonesaw if enemy is building heavy armor, or breaking point if fights are lasting over 5 seconds.   Defensive item is situational -- crucible, aegis, or fountain is usually your best bet.  With a weapon build I usually max A and B because her ult really doesn't hurt much without crystal power. Make sure to land your B as frequently as possible to benefit from the pierce."
vainglorygame,3cr7r5,mcdeezel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:40:32 2015 UTC,"Actually in my opinion, CP Joule is more powerful than WP, esp in the current version. For laners, I don't think you need any items to speed up your melee since your 2nd spell is fast enough to kill the minions. I saw many high-rank Joule players and they did as well as Vox and Ringo for lane minions. Also don't just go for all crystal items. Joule really has to take so much damage since you need to run into your enemies to deal your damage. So I rec one fountain or crucible to help you stay longer in team fights. And broken myth. Never forget that. It is so important for Joule."
vainglorygame,3cr7r5,wztprivate,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:13:58 2015 UTC,I guess cp joule shouldn't upgrade B to overdrive?
vainglorygame,3cr7r5,wztprivate,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"Yes probably. Doesn't matter very much. B is just to clear minions and catch escaping enemies.

vainglorygame,3cr7r5,peterkeats,2,Fri Jul 10 04:10:50 2015 UTC,This is a great build. It's hard to go wrong on any WP crit build on Joule after a Sorrowblade and Tyrants Monocle.   Keep in mind that increasing attack speed actually lowers Thunder Strike cooldown on Joule.
vainglorygame,3cr7r5,WSBowman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:06:43 2015 UTC,Good point! It'll also help with health regen if you're farming lane with a Book; you can last hit with the basic attack and get more health regen out of it. I've been plugging a swift shooter in there just so I'm not harassed out of the lane.
vainglorygame,3cr7r5,peterkeats,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"Your build makes sense, but is a little scattered. A hybrid WP/CP Joule can work, but shouldn't be your meta. Focus on WP or CP depending on what your Laner / Jungler counterpart is building. When my lane is WP, I usually go full CP.  My hybrid Joule is a Sorrowblade, Alt Current, and a Shatterglass. Then a Broken Myth or Frostburn. I'll overdrive Thunderstrike and BRB."

I started a game where the other two players selected Catherine and Taka, so I grabbed Celeste to hang in the lane.  Game starts up to the other team having a Celeste of their own, a Krul and a Saw.  I figure, Catherine will come to the lane leaving the Taka and Krul to enjoy their solo jungles, right?  Nah, Catherine goes with Taka leaving me 2 on 1 with Celeste and Saw.  I'm trying to do the usual Celeste v. Celeste helio slap fight thing but with Saw helping her I have to hug turret pretty hard.  Soon Saw is popping up to join them for ganks.  I ping the rally here repeatedly with my two junglers usually only showing up after another turret has gone down.  Insult to injury is their ? pinging my corpse when I'm fighting 1 on 3 in the lane and my starts are something like 1/8/3.  My karma dropped slightly after we lost.

You can then buy Tyrants Monocle (?)  serpents mask."
vainglorygame,3cp033,UniqueRaj,3,Thu Jul 9 16:54:53 2015 UTC,Monocle is wasted on Taka if you play him right. He has 100% crit with full stacks. You might as well go straight for serpent mask for your 3rd item.

vainglorygame,3cpy1c,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:56:51 2015 UTC,It does start where your ranked queue was when we made the split.

The way the Elo system works is that you gain more rank for beating someone higher ranked than you and you gain less rank for beating someone lower ranked than you. Losing follows similar logic.  The result of this system is that when you are at the top, there are far fewer higher ranked players for you to compete against, thus making it very slow to climb further. Unfortunately, I don't know of any good way to climb once you're at one of the top tier ranks short of organizing all the top players to be on at the same time.

vainglorygame,3cmuuz,Nexuslife,4,Thu Jul 9 03:25:10 2015 UTC,"One reason why losses involving desertions need to be punished the same way as any loss is that if they weren't, people could manipulate their ELO by having one teammate desert when the game isn't going their way. More generally, there would be social pressure for the ""worst"" person in a losing team (even if they're not explicitly coordinated) to leave so the others' ELO aren't affected by the loss.  And then there's statistics saying it will happen at least as often on the other team (more often actually if you personally never desert)."
vainglorygame,3cmuuz,glStelar,2,Thu Jul 9 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"Okay this makes perfect sense. Seems like the way it is is the ""happy medium"" of sorts."

vainglorygame,3cmuuz,autowikibot,2,Thu Jul 9 06:16:25 2015 UTC,"Law of large numbers:       In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.  The LLN is important because it ""guarantees"" stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. It is important to remember that the LLN only applies (as the name indicates) when a large number of observations are considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be ""balanced"" by the others (see the gambler's fallacy).    Image i - An illustration of the law of large numbers using a particular run of rolls of a single die. As the number of rolls in this run increases, the average of the values of all the results approaches 3.5. While different runs would show a different shape over a small number of throws (at the left), over a large number of rolls (to the right) they would be extremely similar.

vainglorygame,3cjz09,tcbringhurst,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:40:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Fortress is Team specific. He and Celeste are probably mid-top.

vainglorygame,3cjz09,KarmaAdjuster,3,Wed Jul 8 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd call any of these posts the meta. They are all about champion preferences. How I would describe the meta (and it will likely vary from tier to tier) is one laner, one support with a contract, and one jungler. Then the match plays out by the laner holding the minions at bay and farming up while the junglers get fat on jungle creeps but waiting to take their minion miner until ready to make a push.   Team comps vary based on which players are strong with specific champs and I don't think there is a clear winner there. Some champs work better together than others though.  Maybe my post is just off topic and the title is just misleading. Everyone seems to be talking about which champs are regarded as top tier, and not the current meta of the game."
vainglorygame,3cjz09,Lebrontasaurus,3,Wed Jul 8 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with your post is that it's generic. It describes every Vainglory meta that has existed since the beginning, basically."
vainglorygame,3cjz09,kawarazu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:52:42 2015 UTC,"There have been two laner metas and laner, jungler assassin metas, and all jungle metas. Also, before the minion miner changes, the meta for when to take them was much more flat than the current meta. You are correct that predominantly, it's a laner, jungler, and a support. However I still stand by my statement that meta is not the same thing as miss popular champs."

vainglorygame,3ckkax,Twiggled,6,Wed Jul 8 17:08:56 2015 UTC,Yeah it doesn't matter that she gets bloodrage as she gets hit - you're the support with IGC so you need to tank to get health buffs and your share of gold. Sounds like a low tier game where the Rona just didn't know what she/he was doing
vainglorygame,3ckkax,Andys29,4,Wed Jul 8 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"You can get the full bonus of the IGC by initiating against the minions and letting them hit you just once, walking just out of leash range, and returning to help beat them down.  That way the Rona would get hits too and fuel her rage. As Krul I sometimes wish I could take some hits for my support when they start to run low on health, considering I lifesteal plenty along the way, but there is no good way to communicate that with pings, so I don't even try. I'm guessing that might be what the Rona was attempting to say."
vainglorygame,3ckkax,Zaggaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:18:42 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  If I was playing with a Krul I'd usually do that on the back double camp. I'm not sure how well that works with Rona, unless she buys a book. Generally don't have trouble clearing the jungle in time, but perhaps if it sped things up and let us take one enemy camp or spend more time harassing lane... Hmm."
vainglorygame,3ckkax,Kraken_SEMC,3,Wed Jul 8 18:48:00 2015 UTC,Rona should let you tank as the Support. She can jungle clear like a beast and stays plenty fed with Blood Rage without any aggro. It sounds like they probably didn't know how IGC worked or maybe bought one themselves (which is a bad idea for her generally speaking).
vainglorygame,3ckkax,baaallllllin,2,Wed Jul 8 18:08:29 2015 UTC,You're implying unjustified pings from a low level player. I've never seen this so I dunno.

vainglorygame,3chtzc,Dolomyze,5,Wed Jul 8 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"Congrats! Seems like you certainly had a dominating performance. :)  Admittedly, 27 minutes is really long for a game that appears fairly one-sided. For future growth and learning, I'd focus on what you can do to close out such games much more quickly; otherwise, you often give your opponents a chance to get some farm or flip the game on its head with an ace."
vainglorygame,3chtzc,jklick,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"I know it seems it was one-sided but it was evenly matched regarding kills and turrets until the very end. We lost our jungle to a fed koshka early on and I couldn't push the lane against dual-laners with teammates that didn't really come up to gank, which was difficult for me. The enemy team even got a kraken and 2 turrets on us before I finally was able to start hitting their first turret. It helped in the long run that none of the other team got defensive items except crucible and were really aggressive for a dual laning team and solo jungler. I played cautiously while farming lane and moved to jungle whenever I could to help. The only time we ever got an ace was at the very end, and at that point, the enemy never wised up to focus me down first, and I had all 6 items slots upgraded to T3 (first time with T3 boots) with both weapon and crystal infusions on me. I don't think my teammates were trolling or bad, but got outplayed by an aggressive koshka early on and lost momentum. I managed to keep the dual laners in check and avoided the koshka until I was able to kill him easily one on one. It was a tough but fun game, and I even got the ""close game"" badge at the end screen.   edit:grammar"

vainglorygame,3cf6mn,adyendrus,3,Tue Jul 7 15:39:19 2015 UTC,"“Attack speed reductions such as Atlas Pauldron will never reduce the attack animation below base attack speed. Attack cooldowns are still able to go below base speed.”   This still confuses me. Is it saying there is a cap to how low you can reduce someone's attack speed or not?  If you used an atlas pauldron against a Joule, would her attack cooldown go down to 1.4 / 0.35 = 4?"
vainglorygame,3cf6mn,Twiggled,2,Tue Jul 7 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"to expound upon what jklick said,   when you increase you attack speed, your attack animation will play faster (as well as a shorter time between animations).  when you have your attack speed decreased, your animation won't get any slower than a base speed, and the duration between animations will increase."
vainglorygame,3cf6mn,osi42,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:37:50 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks, that makes sense"
vainglorygame,3cf6mn,Twiggled,2,Wed Jul 8 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"For the first part of your question, the attack animation will never be slower than 100% attack speed. Suffice it to say, the time between attacks increases, but the attack animation itself will not decrease further in speed. See the video link below to illustrate what that looks like.   That math you provided is spot on; however, I have to admit that 4 seconds between attacks seemed a little crazy, so I did some play testing.    It seems that Atlas Pauldron reduces the time betweens Joule's attacks to around 2.6 seconds, rather than 4. While this seems more reasonable, this would make her effective attack speed around 54%, rather than 35%. I wonder if /u/SurpriseBirthdaySEMC could shed some light on this.  Here's the video so you can see for yourself and make your own observations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL9jy16tBJM"
vainglorygame,3cf6mn,Twiggled,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:39:36 2015 UTC,Oh that's really odd. I'll watch vid when I get a chance. I was wondering how you worked out so accurately that the actual speed reduction was 46% but I guess the vid may help explain that
vainglorygame,3cf6mn,GrandpaSkitzo,2,Wed Jul 8 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome article!  I was curious if fortress attacked faster than most at level 12. Not that it was a hge difference, but I did notice it."
vainglorygame,3cf6mn,tehkyy,2,Tue Jul 7 13:53:16 2015 UTC,"Good stuff! Curious why you chose to omit the 50% attack speed bonus from Rona though. You did mention this, but I suspect because of the extra maths required to understand the impact of +50% Atk Speed -80% Dmg since it's not as straight forward compared to the rest of the heroes. Do you have any conclusions on building drawn from this or is that coming in the future? Keep up the quality work."

She is, IMO, the most fun hero to play in the game right now, and she can be hella powerful if you play her right.  In the end its up to you. She plays a lot like an assassin, so if you a good Koshka player I would recommend her to you.   Double Serpents mask plus red mist is a meat grinder."
vainglorygame,3cipsk,ifuckinglovekatara,4,Wed Jul 8 05:42:19 2015 UTC,"You're taking a risk with Rona. If you want a more conservative jungle carry/warrior, I'd try to take up Glaive, although his early game is decidedly weak. Koshka has fallen out of the limelight as of late as a premier assassin, but she's very cheap."
vainglorygame,3cipsk,ThreeBlindMice_7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:31:16 2015 UTC,"I took back Koshka my last few games after a long long break away from her (I was practically married to her for some 300 games when I started). She still feels very powerful to me. Even more than when I had stopped playing her.  That being said, Rona is a lot of fun! But you nailed the risk/conservative thing, she's more prone to have great/awful games than others. I see her as very team, item and context dependant."
vainglorygame,3cipsk,glStelar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:02:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. Glaive doesn't suffer from the kiting problems Rona has; he has twice her range.

vainglorygame,3cipsk,paredesacc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"If you have an aggressive (and by aggressive I mean borderline reckless) play style, I'd absolutely recommend her.  Her play style is to dive into battle, take tons of damage, but have double serpent masks to steal it all back. People usually all clump together in team fights which makes her Red Mist + Dual Masks combo nuke down enemies and bring Rona to full health.  Her weakness is being stunned out of her Red Mist. If she is targeted and can't deal damage via her Ult, she will easily drop. I've seen this a few times and I try to use her Into The Fray over walls to escape, but unfortunately that scenario doesn't always present itself.  I haven't yet played a Ranked match with Rona just yet, but from my test play in Casual Mode against worth opponents (Simply Amazing Silver), I might bring her to ranked play if my team comp would compliment each other!"
vainglorygame,3cipsk,Andys29,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:02:56 2015 UTC,What's a good team comp for Rona?
vainglorygame,3cipsk,4atefifteen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"I'd say working with a Krul probably works well (a lane Krul at high elo) since both heroes want to stick to their enemies. With Red Mist and a sticky Krul using shiversteel, it's quite a one two punch!  If you're not playing with a lane krul like most people, I'd say any sniper to chase down your initial damage once they run should work (Petal, Ringo, Vox).  For support, it's crucial to have a stun like Catherine so you can sit on top of the enemy, or also an Ardan that can Vanguard speed you up when you're in Red Mist mode!"

His smileys are his admittedly poor way of reacting to it.   Many people would find that loss to be frustrating. I've been on every side of that situation: the person that dies stupidly, the teammate of the person that dies stupidly, and the team that got the lucky ace comeback. I was trying to win in every single one of those situations. The only gripe I'd have is the smileys after dying can be irritating, but it doesn't change the intent or outcome in any way.

vainglorygame,3cgwmw,GEOpdx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"I really love casual mode. Worrying about my rank was so stressful that I stopped playing for a while after I hit SA. The fact that you can actually see your progression in a tier now is my favorite part of 1.6. I really wish it was there from the start. When I'm halfway towards the next tier, I no longer have to worry about dropping a tier if I lose that one. It's also great to have a rough idea how many wins you need to rank up as well."

Your follow-up to the question:   or should I look forward to getting a higher and higher cool down whenever my WiFi goes out while match making?

Since each box features 2 heroes, I was able to get the T2 of 1 hero and T3 of the other hero and use the left over cards for the next box.   I like that I have my lane character, jungle carry, and support bases covered.  I think the only character's skin that I would like to have now is Taka as I like to play him also."

vainglorygame,3chc2b,g1w,2,Tue Jul 7 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"Although its a bit subjective, I would say yes. Even a slight slow down to an enemy hero could mean the difference between a kill and a getaway.  It's also more cost effective than say Shatter glass.    I know what you mean,  but I notice that in a tight 3v3 match,  every 0.5sec and delay counts.   My 2 cents.  GG and play on!"
vainglorygame,3chc2b,major153,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:40:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I definitely like the reduced cost. Do they stack? Maybe 2 FB might be a good route, independent cooldowns?"
vainglorygame,3chc2b,GrandpaSkitzo,4,Tue Jul 7 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"The frostburn slow effect doesnt stack, but the cp would. You'd be better off getting a SG or BM instead of a second Frostburn.   I use frostburn on Koshka, joule, and adagio."
vainglorygame,3chc2b,peterkeats,3,Tue Jul 7 23:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's 1% slow for every extra CP. So if you have FB and Shatterglass, it's 25% slow. When you put that together with BM, you get a 30% slow and a scary big red button :)"
vainglorygame,3chc2b,jklick,2,Wed Jul 8 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"The slow starts at a base 15% and adds another 1% per 10 CP. With just a Frostburn, you're at 25%. Adding a Shatterglass would bring this to 40% - in theory - but the slow is capped at 35%."
vainglorygame,3chc2b,osi42,2,Wed Jul 8 03:04:57 2015 UTC,"It is effective.   As Skaarf, it is useful for fleeing enemies, because I can fireball while running away to increase the gap. (assuming we all have the same level of boots)"
vainglorygame,3chc2b,lcpdragonslayer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:39:08 2015 UTC,Depends on the enemy hero - more effective against some like Krul and SAW. Or if you're playing someone like Vox.

vainglorygame,3ciaye,jklick,3,Wed Jul 8 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"First, Adagio support doesn't work as well I've found with more squishy junglers like Taka, cp Koshka, etc.  I'm not even convinced he's good with Rona.  With Jungle Vox, Glaive or Krul though he's fantastic, primarily because these heros benefit heavily from targets being snared.    Normally how I do this in solo que is to spend the first part of the match aggressively using your a ability to snare opportune targets.  The primary goal being to condition your team that when you snare the squishy target, they need to go kill him.  So then later on in the match you can use this conditioned action to effectively use your b.  You run in and a, your teammates see this and correctly attack the snared targets, and you pop your b on your biggest dps carry right as they start to attack.  I normally build Adagio as a tank though, I also keep my boot tier ahead of the opposing team so that I can quickly get to the appropriate target to snare them.  If you are playing some cp heavy healer/support Adagio my above strategy won't work as well."
vainglorygame,3ciaye,romenglish01,2,Wed Jul 8 08:25:24 2015 UTC,"I'll usually wait until my teammate is already attacking, or at least moving in for the attack.   It's a nice buff but they are still vulnerable, it's not like Ardan's Vanguard. So I think it's normal to have some of it ""wasted"" due to your teammate needing to disengage to save themselves, or at least carefully choosing when to engage, even if the buff is ticking away while they wait.   That being said, I think it's also an issue of awareness. I didn't really think to look for that buff from Adagio until I started playing Adagio myself."
vainglorygame,3ciaye,halcyon400,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:49:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, support Adagio wasn't very popular and many players don't have the awareness to see the buff. IMO you've to guess when your teammates attack or wait a second. Don't cast and expect them to attack."

There could have been a rage pinger or that player could have been forced to make up for another player resulting In a bad score.  You should only have the option to upvotr the enemy.

vainglorygame,3cepuu,dr3wd3zi,8,Tue Jul 7 09:40:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly support is just luck of the draw. I believe for supports, there comes a skill plateau where you can't improve drastically and alot of your fate is in your carries' hands to win matches"
vainglorygame,3cepuu,Lebrontasaurus,3,Tue Jul 7 11:31:37 2015 UTC,"That said, I carried as a support last night where I had the best KDA, we won, and it all worked out. Granted, I've had it go the other way plenty of times, but even in a lopsided skill team, it can totally work out even as the support."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,Kraken_SEMC,2,Tue Jul 7 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"I completely I agree with you. Can't deal out much damage when you're trying to keep the team alive, so you gotta trust the other two to execute. And when that doesn't happen, especially when the match reaches late-game, there's no chance. It's just tough sometimes."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,halcyon400,6,Tue Jul 7 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"Not a whole lot of love for supports out there. When your team loses, your carries blame you for not having big numbers. And even when your team wins, you don't get honored as often because nobody noticed all of your smart, subtle decisions and quick reactions that saved those team fights.   ""Well of course your death count should be low, you're the support."" Yes, and did you notice I have as many assists as you have kills+assists? How do you think that happened, hmm?  /rant"
vainglorygame,3cepuu,RedHerringxx,7,Tue Jul 7 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, but recently changed my own mindset to follow along this general rule:  Even if you disagree with the course of action your teammates have chosen, the fact that they are doing it together means you need to join them.  So while I'm not saying that them going for a teamfight invade is a great idea, you chosing to not join them makes it a worse idea. Should you choose to go with them (ie: go with the general actions of the team) then they have a greater chance of survival - even if it was a bad plan to start off with.  Sometimes, you just gotta let go and do what the team wants to do, even if you don't think it's the best move. This, for me at least, is the essence of being support."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,fibonacci12358,5,Tue Jul 7 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"It's a good point.  Sometimes when the team is not playing together, and especially if there is one member who is off doing their own thing during late game.  I'll just go follow that member.  Staying together is better than being alone during final game moments.    And too many battles lost because two of us are doing something and signaling the goal, and one member doesn't listen or is off doing their own thing.  But the pinging... ugh... that drives me nuts."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,nickmkats,2,Tue Jul 7 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you because a three man team can only succeed when everyone is on the same page. The only issue I had with this idea was the fact that our Lone Ranger last night would go off and do his own thing, even if it meant putting himself and the team in harms way. I suggested him to avoid hazard areas with caution pings, but he continued anyways. 1v2 breaks out, and I can't get there in time before he dies. Then, the onslaught of pings rain down. I'm all for doing what my teammates believe is best. But I feel like this idea goes all three ways as a laner, jungler, and support."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,HouseOfTeeth,4,Tue Jul 7 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"Something I'm having trouble with lately is playing support for Taka's. They get so fast that they just start going on their own and I can't keep up (Grandpa Ardan) even with boots. Also, Taka's will often go way over the 50-yard line and I am really hesitant to follow because I don't have a handy box to slip away into and escape. Any suggestions from Taka players out there? Not singling out Taka players here BTW, I don't hate on them."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,WSBowman,3,Tue Jul 7 14:30:11 2015 UTC,if he is doing ok go support your laner. you can push hard with ardan in the lane and I find that the more you have pushed early in the game(if you can) the better chance you have to win. Had a particularly nasty Vox in the last game I played and they just rolled over us like we werent even there.
vainglorygame,3cepuu,hlprmnky,3,Tue Jul 7 15:02:35 2015 UTC,"Taka carries work great with Adagios! I highly recommend him as a support. I'm also quite aggressive when playing support and usually let my Taka lead the charge. If he wants to invade and wreck face, I'll stick around buffing him, lighting enemies on fire, and healing him from the fringe of battle (very long range on Adagio.) Also, I usually don't mind dying if he secures a kill on a carry; I often don't have any kills anyway so the enemy doesn't really get a high gold bounty and all the important people on my team are still on the map."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,langleylang,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"It's hard to speak for all Taka players, of course, but when I play him one of the big challenges is managing ki stacks. Any time I'm not landing autoattacks, a pretty short timer is ticking down that ends with a good chunk of my combat effectiveness evaporating.  Sometimes, I will pop a Kaku to keep my stacks up. Other times, I will take a quick jog into the enemy jungle to find a creep to stab. I wish there was a good way to use the ping system to say ""brb, knives are thirsty"", but I certainly wouldn't expect a support to put themselves in a dangerous position when I'm the one who can disappear and sprint back to them."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,roguemicrobe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"It's usually a great time to help out your carry with a little pressure in the lane. When I play taka I take some risks in clearing enemy jungles  that I wouldn't expect a teammate to, considering the problem you posed of a much more difficult escape. Stick around and help out when it's obvious he needs it but don't put your neck on the line unnecessarily."
vainglorygame,3cepuu,fibonacci12358,3,Wed Jul 8 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad that I am not the only one. I too was plagued by the infamous question mark krul last night. New players don't realize that a death hurts your team much worse than a kill will help it. They also don't realize that there are specific roles in the game: laners work the lane, junglers work the jungle, and support bounces between both backing up the players when they get a chance to push. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely times in the game when laners have to drop down and help in the jungle, but for the most part, you do your job, and try to stay alive. This is a strategy game not a run-and-gun fps."

vainglorygame,3cb7l7,BlueDmon,3,Mon Jul 6 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: Vol. 2 is out! Click here  Sincerely, thank you all for the kind words and interest. It means a lot.  Now, because it seems there's going to be some debate on the effectiveness of these cards...  I did balance them in terms of stats and abilities to the best of my ability (though I didn't linger on each card too long). I did not balance in terms of the Hearthstone meta etc...this was just a quick thing I decided to mess a round with, since I was curious about how each would look in Hearthstone.   That said, feel free to debate which is the best/worst, etc. It's quite interesting to read.  Now, I'd like to go into my thought process on why each card is the way it is. Perhaps it will be of some intrest or help explain why things are the way they are:  Adagio: The ability references his A and B abilities, allowing him to both heal and buff damage output from the sidelines.   Ardan: A bit underwhelming, maybe, but I chose to reference his role as a protector (taunt) and A ability (Divine Shield). I messed with variations that referenced his C, but it always felt awkward.  Catherine: She may be one of the best, IMO. She freezes enemies (her A stun), has divine shield (she's a support/protector, also her passive that gains armor/shield), and she has taunt to protect her allies. All that, plus good Health, damn...I want her in my Hearthstone.  Celeste: I play a lot of Celeste. That said, she was tough to make a card for. I ended up referencing how when you chase her, she's usually dropping Heliogenesis along your path. The other variations were all quite complex or strange for Hearthstone.  Fortress: Charge due to the A ability. The wolves due to the C. I added the bleed effect to the wolves as well, making them a bit more than the 2/2 pawns they originally were.  Glaive: Not going to lie, I'm a little proud of this one. The charge and effect both reference his A, where he knocks a target back and stuns them.  Joule: The effect is a reference to her C, Big Red Button, and how in 1.5/1.6 an entire team can be decimated by it. The health is higher than attack due to her passive Armor Plating.  Koshka: Charge is due to her A ability, and the buffs come from the buffs she aquires from her passive and B ability. Easy to take out quick (as an assassin can be), but if you let her build up...may your gods have pity on you.  Krul: Krul has lifesteal. End of story.  Petal: Lower stats to make way for some munions. The deathrattle on the munions referenced her C, where they explode.  Ringo: The ability is a direct reference to the passive.  Skaarf: All of his abilities burn his foes. So, I added a burn to his Hearthstone attacks.  SAW: The ability comes from his passive/wind up. Once he gets going, he can be a monster in damage dealing. Here, that takes the form as an Enrage effect.  Taka: Lies in wait for the right moment, then eliminates targets. The stealth is a reference to his B, as is (to a lesser extent) the immunity to hero powers/spells. High attack because of his high damage output in Vainglory.  Vox: Has charge because of his A and movespeed. Because of his resonance/B, he hits multiple targets."
vainglorygame,3cb7l7,BlueDmon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"On glaive. I think since his A only charges then stuns one enemy that maybe his ability could have been more along the lines of ""Charge. The first enemy minion damaged by glaive is returned to owners deck"" kinda using the recycle spell making it slightly more of a one use more powerful ability then one that can be more harmful if used on a minion with battle cry"

vainglorygame,3cb7l7,baaallllllin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:11:09 2015 UTC,Stops them for replaying it the next turn. for example (bad example but still) the enemy plays dr balanced you play glaive and send it back to his hand he can then play dr balanced again next turn for a second use of his battlecry where as if you put it in the deck he may not draw it again.   Tho in all honesty why would you play it simply to have it deal damage to itself and return an enemy minion to the hand without destroying itself or straight killing the minion

Ringo should have +2 attack, because crit is only 150%, and this guy don't round.  Catherine is perfect. The rest of them were spot on as well. Ardan seemed like the most likely to be created. There are already 3/6 taunts for 5, and there are already minions that give divine shield when they enter. I really like the idea of creating a taunt shield AND a divine shield; double protection, much like Ardan's kit.  Very nicely done!"

vainglorygame,3cb7l7,BlueDmon,2,Tue Jul 7 01:28:37 2015 UTC,I notice Taka is the only one that isnt BGH proof. still none of these would probably see too much play (maybe petal or the chargers) because they all seem too slow against the current aggro meta. :P that being said good job
vainglorygame,3cb7l7,ChapterLiam,4,Mon Jul 6 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't really make them to work in the game. Just to reflect their Vainglory characters.   Still though, glad you liked them. :D"
vainglorygame,3cb7l7,RuchiZ,0,Mon Jul 6 15:52:56 2015 UTC,I just found it funny that alot of them have 5-6 attack putting them out of BGH range except taka (tho at least he has stealth)
vainglorygame,3cb7l7,RuchiZ,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah. As I worked on these, a sort of formula came up. None have less than 4 health (excepting Koshka, who can buff it) and the only reason any have very high costs is due to an ability rather than stats.   The classic 2x(mana cost)+1 formula was used as well for stats, though with such unique abilities, that was only a very loose guideline from time to time."
vainglorygame,3cb7l7,MrTouchnGo,0,Mon Jul 6 16:17:31 2015 UTC,"Indeed at first I was looking just at stats alone I was thinking ""man these cards cost way too much for the stat block"" tho abilities are usually a hard thing to completely judge worth on and I'm no expert but it seemed fair. Tho one question. Based on the wording of Glaive's text I would sound to mean like even if it did enough damage to kill an enemy it would still be sent back to the hand?"

vainglorygame,3cb7l7,KingQuet90,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:47:57 2015 UTC,well as I said the Charge people might see some use as they have an instant impact on the board so yes i can see Vox being used some (hell i love Foe Reaper but he is too damn slow). Skaarf I think I'm failing to see the combo.
vainglorygame,3cb7l7,krazay88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"For Skaarf, he could be used well because you could give him one of the cards that boosts health and gives taunt, and then enemies are forced to attack him, then they get burned, too. He could also be great in a Rogue deck where he hits someone and then use a spell that makes Skaarf go stealth. Basically, force him to be hit or hide him."

Especially if a Shredder messes up and drops a Lorewalker Cho when it dies.  In the end, I didn't spend a lot of time balancing them. I just wanted to reflect the abilities/characters in the cards. Koshka, for example, has Charge (due to her A) and gains stats (due to her passive and the B basic attack buffs)."

You played Skaarf and I did a lane CP Adagio. Frankly, I did not expect how great is both Skaarf and Adagio viability. I got wrecked, but didn't have a bad match at all. Eve+Broken Myth makes Skaarf a real Powerhouse. Perhaps I should've tried an Eve in Adagio. But anyway, I'm also glad how SEMC is balancing stuff. Maybe SAW or Petal still need some twerking for real. I also think Ardan is being underused for a 8000$ hero. Anyway, GG!"

If I'm not mistaken, your team was Skaarf and Krul. Adagio's CP Ultimate really hurts. I think that an Eve on him would be really good, for sustain in lane and if you ult caught up a team your regen would be really good.  I'm loving Skaarf this update. He was my main when he was released, but Celeste and Vox got me hooked after that. Now that he is not broken (Tank Skaarf) and not bugged (CP not applying to his perk), he is very fun. I just think that his Spitfire is a little bit too slow.  Edit: grammar."

Just play with your fellow guild mates and they will casuel with you to level 10. I have enjoyed casual a lot more than rank. I was SA Silver and played rank and just got a bunch of trolls and afks that dropped me to Hotness Bronze. If the lost was because we didn't play well i would not have cared as much but to have trolls sitting at base and pinging the whole game is brutal. I will not solo q ranked anymore.

I don't know why the restriction is so high.   I tried a few casual matches. Haven't gone back to casual queue after I got teamed up with a jungle Ringo and lane Glaive. I feel for you. But you'll get to 10 eventually and honestly it's not that much better in ranked - but at least you don't get as much time-wasters as you do in casual.

Sometimes I think I am not only fighting my enemy team, I am fighting my own team.  I have been playing for 6 months, rated decent, and since the summer this has been happening: 2 player teams where I am the third party ""support"" not allowed to eat jungle or minions.  This is about 2 to 3 out of 7 games. The other jungler has chosen joule or kasha or Catherine - picked jungle on the little board going in, I have picked wisely for my team - like a Krul or such and been instructed, chastised or whatever to get to the lane and stay and not to eat. Lately my only recourse is to not listen, eat jungle anyway minions whatever and be pretty miserable- getting spammed the whole time or die trying to do this until I'm strong enough and hope they see the light.  I think these are all 11 year olds because it seems they think 2 strong players working together and 1 weak player is a good team. Oh summertime! I love being rated on this kind team! What joy!  Sometimes I just start committing suicide just so the other player will come to the lane and I can go the jungle. This works a lot. I feel so bad doing it, but it is about the only thing I can do so I can stop being spammed with stupid stop eating marks, can do my job, maybe begin a good strategy game where everyone is not in the lane, and have a hope of winning.  I just got thru playing a game where ringo actually abandoned as I was getting the kracken and I could tell the Kashka called him as we were down halfway through the vain and he ran down to help us.

You know each ping has a meaning. Using the blue one on base means ""going to base"", and the other 3 you're suggesting can also be said through pings, either the green or white ones."
vainglorygame,3cdsxe,glStelar,0,Tue Jul 7 04:00:20 2015 UTC,I know but the one I'm suggesting are much clear and people will get it right away even if you are a new player so when people see the 'wait here' instead of using the green ping or white 1 it can save time and teammates :)
vainglorygame,3cdsxe,IdkwtS,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:11:48 2015 UTC,"I suggested something similar to this recently:  There can be a small button in the corner of your screen that you can tap and it expands into several transparent (so that they dont obstruct the gameplay) preset commands such as ""Don't/Do get minion mine"", ""Capture Kraken?"", ""Help in lane"", ""Push enemy jungle"", etc.   Some say this can be communicated with the pings but I don't think it works with everyone and it wouldn't hurt to implement a better way of communication without opening an opportunity for toxic behavior/hating."
vainglorygame,3cdsxe,ifuckinglovekatara,3,Tue Jul 7 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"a simple question mark on the minion mine or kraken does the job just fine, then either a thumbs up for yes or a caution sign for no.   the target ping works for pushes. Pings work fine the way they are IMO."
vainglorygame,3cdsxe,IdkwtS,2,Tue Jul 7 04:49:43 2015 UTC,"I already try this all the time and no one responds. Question mark ping is used for so many different things atm so that doesn't help to get your point across all the time. Sometimes I'll ping the caution sign on minion mine and people still kill him, a simple do not icon can help lots with that."
vainglorygame,3cdsxe,ifuckinglovekatara,2,Tue Jul 7 04:53:05 2015 UTC,"I like that do not icon. I too have had many experiences with teammates not listening, maybe that would make it a little more clear"
vainglorygame,3cdsxe,IdkwtS,2,Tue Jul 7 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"I do too! If the preset chat commands aren't implemented, I'd love a new Do Not icon"
vainglorygame,3cdsxe,Rievone,0,Tue Jul 7 05:22:06 2015 UTC,"There was orignally a ""Do Not"" ping before. Wonder why they removed it.  Back then there were only 3 pings: Go (green ping), OMW (which means On My Way, it's basically the Blue ping), and Avoid (red 'Do Not' ping)."
vainglorygame,3cfqm8,6F6A9O9,7,Tue Jul 7 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"Good thought to limit it, but you've allowed 15 too many characters. Outside of the normal, it'll be too toxic argument (it will) one main factor for me is, I can hardly say coherent things in pre-game party chat let alone in the heat of things. I don't want a giant keyboard taking up half of my screen in game. Fumbling around only to see a gank coming for me as I try to type ""WE NED TP PSHSFD…"" (ded) does not sound like a fun time. The only time anyone would have time to chat would be when they are dead at base, and we all know where that's going…   Use the pings. Use them wisely. Use them sparingly. I think many people get caught up in control, and forget that even if I could say X or Y it probably won't matter. These are other people not units for you to direct, they may not agree or even listen. Go with the flow, and try to control the situation less, be the sun not the bitter wind."
vainglorygame,3cfqm8,tehkyy,-4,Tue Jul 7 15:59:33 2015 UTC,If you hate the keyboard don't activate it. And if you're scared of toxicity maybe you should read past my first point and take a look at the second one?
vainglorygame,3cfqm8,tehkyy,5,Tue Jul 7 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"I get it, that you really want to communicate and I agree that whether or not you add chat a block function is necessary but I really think the idea of a keyboard on a mobile game is too much. It's trying to cram a giant square peg into a small rounded rectangle hole. I don't think there is anything wrong with you personally and you're definitely not the first person that has seen a need for better communication, but I don't think that chat with a keyboard is the solution here. Personally the pings work just fine, I can see an argument that says if you have to adapt too much to something it's not good usability but I stand by the ping system. I could see limited pre-set text being an option even, but typing is a big nope in my book."
vainglorygame,3cfqm8,tehkyy,-5,Tue Jul 7 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"If you honestly think the pings work ""just fine"" then you're delusional. Do you not see all the complaints on here about rage pingers?

vainglorygame,3cbvvy,lcpdragonslayer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"I think the point of his B is for if you build him wp...at lv 5 its a basic attack with 190 additional cp added on and a 95% cp and 25% wp ratio.  With some attack speed you can have it pretty fairly often.  I wouldn't really reccomend building a wp Ardan, but it can be fun if you team up in casual queue. But as far as when playing support your right its very meh...its just extra damage and works pretty good with bp or aftershock."

vainglorygame,3cay86,osi42,3,Mon Jul 6 14:48:50 2015 UTC,I don't care if my thumbs up give less karma. IMO Karma isn't important if you're not a toxic player.

vainglorygame,3cay86,lastsynapse,2,Mon Jul 6 14:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in the lower bowels of the tiers, so I thumbs up my teammates when they play appropriately: reserving pings for useful communication, display skill in killing the opponent, and play in a team-oriented manner.    I thumbs up the opponent if they were a difficult opponent that played well (hard to kill, unstoppable killing machine, etc).  I also will thumbs up the entire team if we have a particularly well matched game where the other team seems to have their stuff together, resulting in a heart-pounding long game that goes back and forth.  I try not to thumbs down, unless it's an AFK or a relentlessly selfish high frequency pinger.  I'm hoping that that will make the thumbs down mean more.  Some games nobody receives thumbs, other games multiple people will.  I also think we should get notification of thumbs downs (not by username).  Similarly, we should not be able to thumbs down opponent players except for AFK.  Poor play should be determined by the teammates not the opponent."

No thumbs up if all of that was true, but the build was shit. Thumbs up for enemies who were annoyingly good and made my life difficult and managed to dictate team fights on their terms. I love giving thumbs up to enemy support, if they played annoyingly well."
vainglorygame,3cay86,jklick,2,Mon Jul 6 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"I typically give a thumbs up to everyone after every match, except when there's obvious exceptions. And I don't care about the diluted value of my opinion. Here's the method behind my madness.  I have five options available to me:   Thumbs down (afk) - this usage is kind of obvious Thumbs down (toxic) - this usage is likewise kind of obvious Thumbs down (low skill) - if they're not supposed to be in a certain skill tier, their Elo score will decrease naturally as they lose more matches. Giving a thumbs down isn't going to change that. Besides giving SEMC somewhat unreliable feedback on how well their matchmaking is doing, I'm guessing this option is just a ventilation outlet for people who are frustrated with teammates. Also, I can't say that I don't make mistakes, so ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone.""  Do Nothing - I guess I could do this if I was completely indifferent, but it's rare that I don't have an opinion regarding a teammate. Meh, boring.  Thumbs up - It's rare that I find teammate who is trying to lose. I would almost always assume they're doing their best, even if their ""best"" isn't up to my standards. More often than not, they simply don't know any better and there's no way to teach them differently in the game. Nonetheless, they're doing the best they know how, so kudos to them. ""Thank you for giving your best, not giving up, and not rage pinging. Best of luck in your next game.""   I think the most important effect of thumbs up is mental/emotional - i.e. not the pretty karma bar. I'm fairly competitive and if I just had a horrible game and my team (or the enemy team) gives me thumbs up, it actually helps soften the blow a bit. It's almost like a virtual, sportsman-like pat on the back. I hope I give that same feeling to other players.  An unexpected effect of giving thumbs up was that of my own attitude and mental state. In particular, when I have teammates that are really terrible and I get frustrated, it's somewhat cleansing and therapeutic to recognize those players weren't intentionally trying to make my life miserable and that they were doing their best. It helps me to chill out a little before my next match."

I very rarely thumbs down anyone for Low Skill unless they are giving points away. Usual reasons for thumbs downing is one of my team mates pinged the entire game and affected my game (annoying me is not fun, I play for fun, losing is still fun!) or they've AFK'd out of the game.  When the system came out, I thumbsed up everyone, now I very rarely give anyone a thumb unless they really stood out for whatever reason."

I don't really think they need to drop her price, I think they just need to take an all skill shot hero out of initiation and put Catherine back tbh.  They have one laner, jungler, and support why change that?"

vainglorygame,3ccjr6,NickThePang,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:19:01 2015 UTC,I understand were your coming from however it's no lie in the right game right build joule is a monster. She is one the best heroes in the game not trying to sound rude or off put anyone I don't think it would be fair if they sold a top tier hero in my opinion for such a small price. personally her current price is good it proves you really want to unlock her proves you know how to play to grind that much into the game. however I do see your point being they should spread good and maybe the not as good heroes around so the best ones aren't obviously more expensive. however I don't think it would help to lower her cost if people really want her that bad they'll pay the ice up front or grind through the game and who knows maybe while grinding they'll fall in love with one of the other heroes? just my opinion great topic though!

Learn how to support your team and you will be shocked at the rate you climb the ranks. its always great when getting yourself out of a losing streak too.  especially in the lower ranks where people don't really use Catherine, Ardan or Fortress to their potential.  at the end of the game you might be 1-2-15 and your team mates wont think you contributed much, but trust me.. it was all you baby! Look up game plays on youtube, and builds on vaingloryfire.    every vainglory player should know how to support.  Edit: Celeste is a great choice for your next glory purchase but i would wait and go for Catherine.  i main celeste and she got me from ""Not Bad - Hotness"". but without Catherine I wouldn't have gotten here.  The amount of times i was stuck because of auto lockers or needed a break from Celeste due to a losing streak.  Catherine is my unsung hero and without her my Ipad would be in pieces, thrown out my window."

vainglorygame,3cb1bp,lastsynapse,8,Mon Jul 6 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"Best move would have been to IGC yourself and let him take last hits. If a player doesn't understand the support role, competing for jungle farm with him doesn't help your team at all. Try taking it upon yourself to adapt to your team, and you'll likely find a great deal more success."
vainglorygame,3cb1bp,Zaggaz,5,Mon Jul 6 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Ran into this a few times in casual games (support PETAL!!).  Don't let it bother you.  Run back and get an IGC and than focus on being support.  Tanksha is a little off meta, but still viable.  I understand, the dude said support and had no clue (or ignored it).  But, sometimes you have to alter your game play to mesh with your teammates.    One thing this game has taught me is that from game to game, you (not your teammates) have to be adaptable."
vainglorygame,3cb1bp,ronslie,2,Mon Jul 6 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I ended up doing.  Even as he pulled the creeps away from me.    In hindsight, I should have gotten more mines, because my team wasn't paying much attention to each other in midgame.  For example, Saw and Joule went for the gold mine with all three opponents up and hanging in the tribush.  Had to face check the tribush to show them they were there and got pummeled 3v1, but we got the gold mine because Joule turned to the opponent and Saw was fully spun up on the gold mine.  Joule probably thought I was a dummy getting killed like that."
vainglorygame,3cb1bp,ronslie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:03:30 2015 UTC,"Good on you.    Also, he probably ignored your friend request because 9/10 times those friend requests go more like 'you f@#$ing moron' vs 'hey, next time just say you're jungling and I'll get an IGC as first item'...I've only had one constructive friend request out of the many.  Even that one was a differing of opinion on whether I should have gotten another fountain vs crucible.  it was interesting as they believed they didn't need any defensive items and that I failed as support because I built 2x fountains over 1 fountain and crucible.  Interesting convo."
vainglorygame,3cb1bp,MARSpu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to get better insight into what he was thinking.  I think it helps to know where your teammates are coming from, so you can start to make sense of the pings.  I mean, I get that he said he was support but got all mad at me for taking the jungle farm.  The ""?"" on me in the jungle was obvious. As were the thunderstrikes on me afterward. I didn't understand the rest of the pings, which didn't seem to communicate any team plan.  I think that if I knew what he thought I should be doing, we could have done way better."
vainglorygame,3cb1bp,HouseOfTeeth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"The issue is, and this is something I'm experiencing firsthand, when you move to a support role, you lower your own gold income. This might seem like a selfish issue but it really isn't, because it forces you to change your build and your playstyle. Many people are not used to the change of pace and they feed. This is something I've noticed myself, where now, when I go into a game as support Joule or Taka(bad supports, I know, but perfect examples) I have to remind myself not to play as I normally would.     Being support means you're behind one level. As Joule, the level 5-6 range is when the Gold Mine is above 50%(often 75%) full. Joule's ult is a fight changer in terms of capturing objectives; by gimping yourself, you are actually gimping your team. Likewise, Taka does not get his X-Retsu until 6. While I still do great as Taka anyways, it's also important to note how important his C skill is to his kit.     I'm a great player when I jungle or lane with these characters but I have trouble supporting. People who lock in ""support"" and don't support are literally weakening their own team. It's happened to me plenty of times now and has been a good reason for my feeding in the said games."
vainglorygame,3cb1bp,fibonacci12358,2,Tue Jul 7 06:08:07 2015 UTC,I had an auto lock catherine ( my main) that built not one but 2 tornado triggers.... I had to default to joule (who I have played quite a bit of but am still not comfortable playing). She just ran around and was actually a little effective but never quite teamed up properly and in the end got just was part of the problem (as was I)  update: she accepted my friend request. She is in pretty good silver!!! WTF! cant wait to find out what she was thinking
vainglorygame,3c9hqh,Audiencefone,11,Mon Jul 6 03:34:53 2015 UTC,"I'd rather it give an even more desirable benefit: card drop rates boosted by your level, similar to how Karma boosts Glory rates."

vainglorygame,3c9hqh,Andys29,2,Mon Jul 6 14:54:29 2015 UTC,I totally agree! I love vain and I do spend a lot of time playing but I do feel like there isn't much of a motivation to level up I mean the real reason people level up karma is to get more glory through matches I think glory would make more since as a prize for leveling up rather then cards just to keep the cosmetic thing still difficult so not just anyone can power level over a week and get the needed cards but glory and maybe the higher the level you pass the overall more glory you receive would be awesome!
vainglorygame,3c9hqh,zeroalexzero,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'd like that as well, but I don't think it would happen. There is already a system to get more glory in place, one that rewards good play, or at least not going AFK. I think they'd increase it's effectiveness before adding a second modifier.   Still though, if I got another Glory boost, I wouldn't complain."

I buy tier 1 boots VERY early, and then look to upgrade about the second or third time I've used my boots and I don't want to wait the 150 seconds to catch someone out again. It might be more worth to sell my boots for 150 and buy new ones for 300. It's the same as buying three Scout Traps, but a boots activation can be the difference in a kill.

Between and 2874 and 9580 to get the 16 rares and 8 epics needed from ICE packs.  If my math is right, it would be on average 9311 ICE (a little more than 19 draws/packs). 77% of the time it's gonna require the full 20 draws, and 99% of the time it's gonna require at least 18 draws.  If all you want is a single T2, it should cost less when we get ways to trade cards. Right now, you pretty much need to open a full ICE box to get all the cards needed purely from ICE. You then also get a T3 plus 26 other rare cards. If you don't have the T2 required for the T3, then you get 2 T2's plus 3 legendaries and 26 rares."

vainglorygame,3c9oc1,LokiaScythe,2,Mon Jul 6 08:24:13 2015 UTC,"I only read the first few posts, but I definitely have an opinion :P I'm an economist, I have an opinion on everything...  See also this thread for an actual dev reply on this, and a lot of mine. Also this post and replies for ICE/glory costs that should prevail in the long run, when we'll be able to trade cards and/or have more than one skin. I also replied at the end of the thread of the forums.  While SirYe raises legitimate concerns, it's entirely possible that SEMC made the right decisions.   The question of pricing is probably what most people will have the hardest time ""understanding"". SEMC seems of course to be aiming for the people who can spend a lot on the game. Where I think SirYe could be getting it wrong is in being so sure there aren't enough people willing to spends 100's and 1000's of $$ on the game. One or two players spending 2000$ on the game will make up for 200 people spending 10$... Plus keeping the prices high makes the T3 skins exclusive, luxurious, which they are supposed to be. The concern about the tier skin has some good points, but I don't see it being much of a problem. The point of the system is that and T2 skins are expensive not only because of their own card requirements, but also because you need to get lower tiers. The progression makes sense, and I don't think I'll feel horrible having all 3 tiers and only using T3. RNG ""not a great choice in terms of business""? Totally disagree, it's the right choice particularly business-wise. Entices people to spend more, creates an addiction like lotteries. Finally, on a more positive note, I think one ""problem"" right now is that the system for trading cards is not out yet. When that happens, a lot of the frustration will go away, I think. I also think we will have promotions/sales eventually. That would make sense business-wise in order to get the customers who aren't willing to spend as much. But that will have to wait a while and then not happen often in order to maintain the special feeling of the skins."
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,glStelar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"On the third point: I think the confusion around the system, shown throughout the thread, is actually being a deterrent.

vainglorygame,3c9oc1,glStelar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:30:12 2015 UTC,ok so is there no option to just buy the tier II skin with ice the same way that you can purchase tier I skin with 900 ice?
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,glStelar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:45:09 2015 UTC,Nope. The way to get a guaranteed T2 is to buy the full ICE box of the hero you want the skin.
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,i_make_doors,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:46:18 2015 UTC,It's semi random based on how lucky you get from ICE Boxes (the themed boxes will allow you to get all cards for a couple tier 2 skins). I've done two full ICE boxes and have tier two adagio ringo koshka and tier 3 ringo
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,glStelar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:44:05 2015 UTC,"And you're somewhat close to T3 adagio I guess :)  But.. I wouldn't qualify it as ""semi"" random. I understand that it's random, given the cards that are left in the box. What do you mean by semi?  (see my other reply in this thread for some probabilities :P)"
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,i_make_doors,2,Mon Jul 6 07:01:10 2015 UTC,Because each box you can see the content beforehand so you know if you spent ~9000 ICE you will be able to get all 80 cards in a box. So it's random if you get enough to finish a skin quicker than emptying the entire box. Oh and I will be able to get koshka and adagio tier 3s with the right box (koshka legendarys and adagio epics).
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,nyadav,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:12:42 2015 UTC,"It's random up until the point where you are buying the entire box since its contents are set. Each draw will get you random cards out of the 80 selected cards, but if you buy the entire box it is no longer random since you know you are getting all 80 of those."
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,glStelar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"Right. It's just that very technically speaking that still qualifies as random because there are probabilities involved, right until the 20th draw of 4 cards which is entirely deterministic.  Semi random could lend to misinterpretation, maybe. But that might just be me. :p"
vainglorygame,3c9oc1,theSDRexperiment,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:11:31 2015 UTC,You need to buy a complete ICE box! And not buying the whole box means your probability is waaaay lower and you'll spend more.  A complete ICE box will cost you around $80 and will give two skins.

vainglorygame,3c96la,LuKun14,3,Mon Jul 6 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"The meta is technically supposed to be 1 laner and 2 junglers (1 support and 1 actual jungler) but people dont always adhere to this. If done correctly, it usually ends up being one bulky support keeping the laner (carry) alive in late game and the jungler just dishing out damage and support however he can.   However, I find trying to 'carry' or 'lane' when playing alone extremely frustrating at times because teammates can be very bad or selfish and it can get you killed. Then, the enemy laner farms up and passes you or the other team feeds off of your teammates deaths and it snowballs.  When I play solo, I actually find great success using more 'tanky' builds where you can keep yourself alive as well as teammates by using fountain of renewal, crucible, etc. For heroes, I think Joule is a great balance between offense and defense when playing solo as well as Glaive and Krul (if played correctly).  You can also look up ShinKaigan's series on getting to high elo via solo queue, he gives great tips throughout the videos."

But I can see a sustain build doing really well. Get some lifesteal and maybe 2 defensive items.  Heroes.. Ringo, Vox, Glaive seem popular. Celeste, Koshka and Taka are riskier to play but can dominate some games. Fortress is an agressive support with which I often end up with a relatively high KDA (even not building anything offensive).. He can do some work and is less team dependant than Catherine and Ardan IMO."

If you've used the Reflex Block or know about it, its basically a RB for you and your teammates. After you use it, you have to wait 45 seconds to use the shields again but the +600 health stays"
vainglorygame,3c96la,IdkwtS,0,Mon Jul 6 14:35:30 2015 UTC,Does the +600 health and other passive affects stay after respawning? And 1 second? Really? How would you even time that for being worth it?
vainglorygame,3c96la,lightningboltkid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, the +600 health stays after respawning, it's permanent until the match ends or you sell the item. Although 1 second sounds very short, it can mean the difference between life and death if used correctly. It prevents debuffs and can block a chunk of damage which means you can escape from Ardans Gauntlet if need be, block a Catherine stun, Ringo or Celeste ultra, etc. Being able to block one of those can really make a difference in staying alive or winning a teamfight :)"

Fortress is also a great pick, but you'll probably need to use real money to buy him, since he's brand new and still costs 8,000 Glory.

It is the way it is for several reasons and a big one is money. This is one of the few way to collect from us chumps. It's very generous for SEMC to even consider the option of earning skins in the first place so I'm not bent out of shape about the cost of some of these things. I do however see the argument for, ""I just want to buy the stupid thing!"" And your methods olives that. Maybe it will be addressed later on but overall I prefer this system. What's the point of cards if I'm just buying the exact ones I need?"
vainglorygame,3c85je,tehkyy,2,Sun Jul 5 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"(Novelty worth?) Problem is, from what I remember last night it can take a full year to get a tier 1. Not sure how they mathed it out. But it COULD be true, math or nay, because of rng. RNG is actually a very big turn-off for many people. RNG is not fun if you're trying to get something with a set value. Tier 3 skins have no set value because of the boxes. You buy the entire box out or you don't/get super lucky. I heard some arguments pop up telling people the boxes are to fill in the last cards you need... but the boxes do NOT take your current cards into consideration in the first place. Also a big deterrent. Then there's some currency complication stuff in page 12 of the thread by aerestoplanes...  p.s. The cardlist doesn't need to be such a simple ""buy all you need naow"" thing, it can be fleshed out from a concept. It'll probably be considered as a resource dump when you're left with like 300 ice and want to work a little towards a skin."
vainglorygame,3c85je,BlueDmon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:48:42 2015 UTC,Not sure if typo but you state RNG is no fun when trying to get something with a set value then state that the tier skins have no set value. Wouldn't this mean your saying that buying these boxes is indeed fun then?
vainglorygame,3c85je,tehkyy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:55:35 2015 UTC,I think that he means on the one hand they have a set value based on the value in each card derived from the value of the box of cards etc. etc. but on the other hand you cannot just out right purchase them right meow.
vainglorygame,3c85je,BlueDmon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:56:32 2015 UTC,"The issue is that a full ice box, guaranteed to get the tier 3, means you need 75€ in packs, or 70€ if you have at least 40 ice left over. WITHOUT RNG, this cost can be a chunk less. The 75€ is the threshhold. Threshhold as in, once you cross that line you're guaranteed to get your goal. Anything less is up for grabs. Someone told me the value of a skin comes averaged onto 19 Dollars, $. But that's probably taking the cards in account, and this was over his experience of buying 3 different? boxes out. I forgot what I wanted to say, so take a:  tl;dr: Unless you buy it out fully, it's going to punish you (box will expire and change, and is resetted with that), and you probably won't get the tier 3 you want(ed). If you just put the straight up 75€ ice into it, you're going to get what you want but it has to be at once and 75€. Playing to get it is NOT feasible. Extreme amounts of time. Threshhold=75€. Any less is a risk if your goal is the tier 3. Risk for such a high price=very very very gambly and discouragingly scary."
vainglorygame,3c85je,BlueDmon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"Well i wouldn't necessarily say a skin is 75 € since in buying out a box you would be getting cards for many skins. Sure each box only has one set of legendary cards for one tier 3 but you can use the others for tier 2s n whatnot which might motivate a person to play a character he doesn't play as much more often to show off the skin.   For example i spent about $50 on the koshka box trying to get the cards for her. Now i was pretty lucky n got all her legendary cards but i didn't even have her tier 2 yet n I'm still one card off getting it (a smoke n lasers) but I'm the process i managed to also get enough cards for tier 2 adaigo n now that i have that i feel like playing him more. Which might tide me over until another box with more koshka cards is available (which because RNG I'll get more candy f'n necklaces i already have 13 of.)  This could also include even more RNG since at least there is only a set pool of cards n you can't get 50 candy necklaces from one box like you can in traditional card packs. They did also mention an upcoming system that would allow you to do ""something"" with all your extra cards. Tho it's possible it will simply be turning them into glory.  TL/DL while i would love to buy individual cards i think your fixating too much on the negatives n not trying to look at any benefits or think of the companies point of view."
vainglorygame,3c85je,BlueDmon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"You're bending too far. If you put in 50€ and you don't even get to tier 2 of the character you bought those boxes for, that should leave you with a bad taste. You didn't get lucky, by a SINGLE card. Granted, you got tier two Adagio. But you were aiming for tier 3 Koshka. What if you were a player that avidly hated playing Adagio and don't like his skins either? then you literally wasted half your money and still didn't get what you wanted.  I know this is a VERY negative outlook, but it's a very POSSIBLE one. It's gambling. You shouldn't want to put more money in a system that doesn't give what the customer wants if it's INDICATING the main prize you will get. It's not like hearthstone where everything is random, this is you trying to get a skin for which the ice box is giving all you need, but then proceeds not to give you nearly enough. Sorry if I come off a bit... idk."
vainglorygame,3c85je,BlueDmon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:01:39 2015 UTC,I guess i could say i was lucky if i had all the cards needed for $50 (tho really less because i did use some to buy rona) but i guess it could have taken me until i emptied the pack to get the last card i needed. Tho your right it is completely gambling and that might be partly why i am ok with it. Because i like gambling n most likely have a problem with it. Learned that at my first job where they sold scratch off tickets. One reason I'll never go to Vegas lol. But i do allow myself similar forms of it like hearthstone n the like.

Sometimes, a person will lock in a hero that can be lane or jungle and they don't select the lane label.  I've been burned by that.  I'll select their character and the lane label... sometimes that works just to make sure they chose lane.  Or I'll choose an obvious non -laner like Taka and select lane.  If they can't communicate they are taking the lane, they probably aren't that great a communicator in game or player.  Dodge.  If it's saw or ringo and they don't select lane, I'll usually go in the game.  But I've been burned by a jungle saw.  If they don't want to lane that's fine, I can change to lane.  But I like having a balanced team and try to fill in what isn't taken.  (lane, jungle support)    Example: was just getting ready for a match.  Fortress locked in, I soft select Taka, they lock in Adagio but don't select lane.  I dodge the match because they never selected lane.  If they select Jungle, I select a ranged hero for lane.  If they select lane, I go with Taka."

vainglorygame,3c8gbv,An0therk,2,Sun Jul 5 21:49:07 2015 UTC,I think casual has an hidden ELO so it will go up and down independently and we can't see it at all. I noticed by playing a lot in casual that at the first few games the lvl of players was not too high and I got lots of wins. Now it's much harder and I see most other players with me and on the opposing team are POA silver and bronze. I'm only SA bronze on This account. Maybe someone can tell us we're it starts. Have fun.
vainglorygame,3c8gbv,Sheldor77,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:39:52 2015 UTC,It would make even less sense without any form of ELO. So I assume it is there.
vainglorygame,3c8gbv,DeafSmithVG,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:38:38 2015 UTC,Devs have confirmed there's a hidden MMR/ELO for casual that is independent of ranked ELO.  So the rank you see for yourself and other players is determined by games played in ranked queue only. Whereas the matchmaking in casual is determined by games played in casual only. There is of course a relatively strong correlation between the 2 in general.

If you need a reflex block and you are up against WP I would build Crucible, if you are up against CP, go for Aegis. If you are up against WP with attack speed (any Ringo build (B ability), any SAW build (heroic perk!), other Heroes with attack speed items) then take Atlas Pauldron.

Never attack Catherine when she has her shield up. If your stun bugs you, reflex block it, don't try to kill her. By the time her stun is up a second time, the rest of the team should be dead (or you), so you can kill her off slowly, despite her defence.  I am not saying that I would be able to block the stun, but I see people doing it."

If you/your team needs more defense, go for AS, Defense and BM for late game."

vainglorygame,3c6ht1,Ares-2,2,Sun Jul 5 11:29:32 2015 UTC,"I think, I've seen Frostburn once in vgl by R3D. Clockwork is useless for Koshka IMO."
vainglorygame,3c6ht1,theSDRexperiment,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:33:37 2015 UTC,Because of her heroic perk and the added speed Koshka has no problem catching up with fleeing heroes. Which renders Frostburn a bit useless. Back in the day when Void Battery was build into Frostburn it had more utility.
vainglorygame,3c6ht1,Ares-2,3,Sun Jul 5 14:14:07 2015 UTC,You use Frostburn for an aoe slow to help your teammates. Either for kiting or for melee heroes without gap closeres.

vainglorygame,3c7st6,I_Was__Drunk,3,Sun Jul 5 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"I believe there are other, possibly better ways to deal with the potential problems you have mentioned without outright banning facing the same people 2 games in a row. (That could seriously hurt matchmaking times at some ELOs and it's not necessary IMO.)   It's unlikely that you get matched with a team significantly better (or worse) than you, that's what ELO is for. Normally you shouldn't get matched with people who are of very different skill, but if you do, each game that is won by the better players will help lower the probability of them matching against each other in future games. I believe the thumbs down could and should be used (by the devs) to avoid, when possible, matching together people who don't like each other. But if they're the only players of similar skill available, then they should be matched, otherwise no matches could start."
vainglorygame,3c7st6,glStelar,2,Sun Jul 5 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"I've experienced a similar situation yesterday, which I don't mind at all. The one thing that I do mind is all of the inexperienced players who constantly rage quit (abandon) the game during a match just because there are players better than them. It ruins the match for the team that has to make up for the loss.   I had to play a few matches of 2 vs 3 usually with my team on the losing end. It really kills the experience and makes me really wish rage quitters would get serious consequences for abandonment.   It's simple: If you hate being killed all the time, get better!

vainglorygame,3c5v9d,EdTheShred_SEMC,5,Sun Jul 5 06:31:06 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the report. We've monitor server performance and average ping times super closely and we actually quadrupled capacity ahead of this weekend with the Android launch. The game is growing rapidly, but the good news is that we have plenty of capacity and server performance is good currently:  What you are seeing is likely a combination of a bunch of things.   Firstly - after an update we frequently get complaints of ""lag"" that mostly fixes itself with a device restart. We truly have no idea what's going on there other than that it appears to happen in particular to older devices. So pls try a device restart and see if that fixes. It's not super intuitive why it would fix. But it often appears to do so. Vainglory still today remains sensitive to packet loss. So it doesn't matter if you have a 1Gb fiber to your house, if you have WiFi / radio interference of any kind, you may see ping spikes. It's always worth trying to reboot your router, and if it persists, it's worth trying a different WiFi channel in case the one you are on is crowded. Sometimes being closer to the router also helps. When a lot of new players come in we always see a spike in drop out rates. You now have to complete the tutorial and two bot matches before you get into casual queue. But even then it appears to take a while for the drop-out rates to stabilize - likely a mix of learning game rules and learning not to play on unstable connections. This should stabilize in the next few days. There are a whole bunch of esoteric issues which also cause lag. Like some bluetooth devices appear to interfer with Vainglory, some chargers cause Vainglory to lag while charging. We're finding these things out as we go along. If anything has changed on your home setup I'd experiment with reverting it to see if it has an impact on Vainglory. Finally, we have a long term R&D track to ensure network quality and stability. Sometimes we have interconnect issues, like a few days ago Comcast traffic was lagging. Just yesterday a telco in Indonesia made the game unplayable. We are working to figure out how we can both detect, minimize the impact and ulimately avoid these. We will also likely revisit the networking layer of Vainglory to see if we can become more resilient to packet loss. The end-to-end network quality track is an important track that we will likely never stop working on entirely.   Know that we're all players ourselves and take ping issues super seriously. Appreciate the report and hope that one of the above helps fix your specific issue!"
vainglorygame,3c5v9d,EdTheShred_SEMC,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, have you guys compiled a list of various chargers, devices, and whatnot that other players have reported? If so, maybe you could release it so me and other players that are experiencing this can see if we we are using something that's been acknowledged to cause interference.   I don't know if this is legal, but maybe even give a list of telecom companies known to have issues with the game?  Thanks for all the troubleshooting options! I appreciate all your guys hard work. This has been the first iOS game that I haven't deleted off my devices. Truly amazing."

vainglorygame,3c6arj,Tiramidasu,3,Sun Jul 5 06:14:43 2015 UTC,"The next ICE box with Koshka's legendaries is probably gonna be two boxes from now.  If I understood wolf_hands' comment on the thread for this current box correctly then it'll be Ringo's Tier 3 with another Tier 2 then Koshka's Tier 3 with a different Tier 2 again since there are only three Tier 3 skins so far and I don't think another is going to be released before then.  But honestly waiting another 4-5 days for Koshka's legendaries isn't that long of a wait.  I doubt that the current Tier 2/3 skins will be directly available for ICE because the ICE/Glory box are supplementary to the card drop system.  This is pure speculation on my part, but if they ever did make the current skins available for ICE is once we have more skins in the game."

vainglorygame,3c4buj,GentleBarbarianConan,8,Sat Jul 4 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, usually this. Generally the support floats between lane and jungle, but is generally in the jungle until mid-game."
vainglorygame,3c4buj,Kraken_SEMC,6,Sat Jul 4 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"Normally the laners are Heroes with a long range like Ringo, Vox or Celeste.  The junglers are mostly played by Glaive, Krull, Taka and Koshka.  The support is mostly played by Catherine, Ardan or Fortress  When playing support or jungle, you need to know the use of Ironguard Contract! If you don't play lane!  But! These Heroes can also be played in different roles and often melee heroes will lane and range heroes will jungle!"
vainglorygame,3c4buj,Lensjo,7,Sat Jul 4 18:15:40 2015 UTC,The first two comments are right on. For a resource you may have missed: Go to the 'Academy' tab in the Vainglory app and look under 'Tactics' and you'll see a video called 'The Team'. Real basic info there.
vainglorygame,3c4buj,RaifetheRenegade,3,Sat Jul 4 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"In the simplest terms, 1 laner and 2 junglers.   1 of the junglers plays support though which means that they buy an ironguard contract (there's a guide on this item in the academy in game) and they will generally stick with the jungler, occasionally roaming to lane to gank.  That's in the early game though, later on your team should be roaming the map as a 3."
vainglorygame,3c4buj,Twiggled,2,Sat Jul 4 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"Even if you are a laner, sprint to the middle brush for 2 extra hp pots and a flare at the start of the game before you head to lane. The flare protects yourself against the 2nd rotation of clears (the jungler and support usually clear the jungle twice and then gank lane). This way, you can push just a bit before you go back for your tension bow. (Because everyone on the internet has perfect cs)"
vainglorygame,3c4buj,Orianntal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yup 2 junglers and 1 laner. After the first wave of jungle minions are toast, you go up too the top lane for a few seconds to either gank or whatever"
vainglorygame,3c6tvv,endi78,4,Sun Jul 5 11:52:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've been positive about ranked play recently. But I am on board with you. The people in ranked play can really suck. It's like the super-pingers need to be extra jerky to play ranked. People tend to be super independent, or super bossy. The idea of cohesive team play is sidelined by their need to win by leading the charge.   I downvoted this ping-troll the other day, then got matched with him again the very next match. I actually dodged the match and called it quits in Ranked for the day.   I'm sure they are pretty good players, otherwise they wouldn't be with me in Ranked play. But boy, they can have really twisted views of what constitutes teamwork.   That's my rant. I like playing casual. I'll probably get a lucky batch in Ranked next time I play. Good luck."

vainglorygame,3c6tvv,autowikibot,2,Mon Jul 6 09:28:50 2015 UTC,"Law of large numbers:       In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.  The LLN is important because it ""guarantees"" stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. It is important to remember that the LLN only applies (as the name indicates) when a large number of observations are considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be ""balanced"" by the others (see the gambler's fallacy).    Image i - An illustration of the law of large numbers using a particular run of rolls of a single die. As the number of rolls in this run increases, the average of the values of all the results approaches 3.5.

I've been playing a lot of fortress and normally I buy two tier 3 tank items before anything else( recently it's been fountain and war horn first) and then continue to focus defenses. As a support character the main thing to do imo is to keep the team alive so they can do all of the damage."

vainglorygame,3c3yy6,thevietfunk,2,Sat Jul 4 19:08:15 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll try this out
vainglorygame,3c3yy6,cowaii,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:41:26 2015 UTC,I main Adagio and I usually use all that you listed except I generally use alternating current instead of shatter glass. Mostly because it's a lot cheaper and easy to get either early or late game.
vainglorygame,3c3bwr,Silency,5,Sat Jul 4 10:32:29 2015 UTC,I agree. I also always double-check that I clicked the right one. I would like to see the word casual or ranked in the waiting screen...  So far I have not seen too many trolls or afks in casual though. Surprisingly better than pre 1.6.
vainglorygame,3c3bwr,xmanuw,3,Sat Jul 4 11:55:08 2015 UTC,"I'm splitting my play time between both and I'm still seeing a lot more trolling, afking and general toxic behavior in ranked than I am in casual."
vainglorygame,3c3bwr,PsychoProject,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"Isn't it because people want their team to purposely quit to lose ELO though? It feels like it is, you gain and lose more ELO in ranking don't you?"
vainglorygame,3c3bwr,oldboldmold,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:08:24 2015 UTC,You mean they're trying to lose ELO so that their game in casual is less challenging or something? I don't get it.
vainglorygame,3c3bwr,PsychoProject,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"Possibly that too. What I meant was, if they troll or desert the match. The allies will be more likely to surrender/lose or quit, leading them to lose karma and/or ELO, if that makes sense."

You can still play public matches with people, just not ranked play until you have account level 10 and strong Karma. It's a way of helping to stem back on account smurphing and make the matches you run into much more accurately even matched rather than facing off with a PoA player that is just posing as a Pretty Good player."
vainglorygame,3c520a,Kraken_SEMC,2,Sat Jul 4 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. Kind of sucks for me wanting to rank up again but I'll take the hit and go for it! Gives me a great chance to catch up on the new heroes I guess. Was it like this for everyone when the level system was introduced? As in, having to play a bunch of I ranked games? My karma's 17, just wondering what determines the level someone's placed at? Number of matches?"
vainglorygame,3c520a,Whodouknohere,2,Sat Jul 4 21:58:44 2015 UTC,Account leveling started awhile ago but ranked matches are brand new so most people already were at level 10 by the time it was released. I'm already level 17 for example

Effectively ""locked out"" of ranked matches for like a month now. And that's if I start playing consistently again. Really seems like a bit of unfair way to have done it. It does kind of put me off playing to be honest, the skill tier movement was a huge motivational factor for me. Now I know that's not even going to budge one bit until I've racked up about 10 hours more gameplay."

It is a great way to play. At least half of the games I play now are Casual."
vainglorygame,3c4gkj,Lensjo,6,Sat Jul 4 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"You could note down your current skill tier for casual games. If it ends up not lending itself to any significant interpretation you can always ignore/hide it later. Number of turrets left for winning team. (Maybe losing team also for games surrendered.) Whether losing team surrendered or crystal was destroyed. Keeping it to a minimum, I think the opposing team's composition is very relevant (about as much as your own team's IMO). Game duration! A data obsessive person (such as myself) could note down the full end of game builds, gold accumulated, KDAs. Without writing down full builds, you could should the level of detail you want. E.g. (1) weapon/crystal/tank-support, or (2) number of items of each color (red, blue, yellow, green, bronze, purple) or (3) items of each color and tier, could code the tiers as tier3=100, tier2=10, tier1=1 to limit number of data fields, or (4) you might as well make up some abbreviation for each item and note the whole builds down :P Maybe it would be more convenient to use abbreviations for hero names rather than the full names. You could also make drop down lists for heroes (and items?) if that's your kind of thing."

vainglorygame,3c4gkj,glStelar,2,Sun Jul 5 10:42:03 2015 UTC,"Looks good. Of course it depends what you want to do with it also.  You have a lot of the data useful to learn from your games. The comment is also interesting because it allows you to add your impressions and develop your skill by synthesizing things you think were important.  If you were to gather data for many many games, it might be more useful to have all the data for a game on a single line to make it easier to analyze statistically. But that can probably be done later also (reformatting it ""automatically""). Although I might still suggest that you have all games on a single sheet (one below the other) to make eventual further manipulations easier. If you want to do this, I would suggest selecting cells A1:M11 of the empty form sheet and dragging down to make some copies of the form. You can then copy that over to the first sheet and work from there.  Total gold and Total score could be calculated from formulas, if you want to avoid doing the math manually."

vainglorygame,3c2atj,IdkwtS,3,Sat Jul 4 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"I think that SEMC wants to see how the current thumbs up/down feature plays out before they make changes.  I don't think that we, as players, will ever see the numbers for how many people lose karma through being thumbs downed or lose all the weight in their reports from constant reporting.  I think they could add some things in such as a mute button that could help the reporting system.  Like if someone is muted, but not reported then that probably means they were trying to direct the team and got a little overzealous with pings.  If someone got muted and reported by both teammates then that probably meant they were rage pinging/trolling and making the game unpleasant.  It's kind of the plus and minus of not having a chat system.  With League of Legends, the troll/rager will normally be toxic in chat, then Riot has the logs and ban accordingly.  While we don't have to deal with toxic chat I don't think SEMC can easily look into things like that with the size of the team."
vainglorygame,3c2atj,Koozaza,2,Sat Jul 4 04:57:34 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with this. One of the nice things about VG is that if you mess up, you wont have to deal with being hounded and insulted in the chat if someone is upset. Though this comes at a price and that's not allowing players to communicate with each other if need be.  I think the mute/report system would work well and hopefully things such as pinging are improved. I'd even welcome a small icon in the corner of the screen where, if pressed, expands to a few (transparent so you can see the gameplay still) pre-made commands/communication sentences such as ""Please help in lane/jungle"", ""Don't/Do take minion mine)"", ""Get Kraken"", etc."

vainglorygame,3c1rjr,Malgus234,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:50:04 2015 UTC,"The pinging is pretty bad sometimes, I get spammed with (?) pings when a teammate dies and I cant finish off the enemy or else they'd get a kill via turret/teammate.   Although, I've used the question ping for different things. Sometimes if a player is doing something really random that might be detrimental to our team, I ping (?) or I ping (?) on minion mine asking if our laner wants us to take it."
vainglorygame,3c1rjr,IdkwtS,-1,Sat Jul 4 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"I've been guilty of this in the casual games today, but listen to my reasoning and tell me if I'm wrong.  I always wait till the other two players have chosen their characters to choose mine. I then pick the role that they haven't filled. When they both pick characters that can do either lane or jungle, without declaring which, I choose Ardan so I can play support.   When the match starts I buy a contract. When the other two players both head to the lane and stay there for the whole match, you can bet I'm pinging question marks and green crosshairs all over the jungle trying to figure out why they're playing the way they are and I, the support with the contract, am forced to jungle alone. I have to alter my entire build to compensate for their stupidity.   Just as bad is when I choose saw and indicate I'm going to lane and another player decides they are going lane full time as well. If they'd indicated lane at the beginning I would have gone Taka or Ardan depending on the third player's character.   In short, when people are playing like ignorant and selfish pricks, I spam them with pings to try and communicate what they should be doing."
vainglorygame,3c1rjr,xEl33tistx,7,Sat Jul 4 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"While your frustration can justified at times, you're trying to play meta and they're not, excessive pinging will not achieve better team performance or cohesion. You're just as bad as your teammates if you resort to spamming pings when they play different than what you thought they should be doing. In fact it's probably worse to be the ping spammer because your teammates were probably acting out of ignorance and you were acting out of arrogance that you are better than them.  Next time you're stuck with double laners.. Take advantage of the jungle XP and gold you're getting. You have a tough job ahead trying to protect the amateurs, but the good news is that they're giving you more gold and XP than you ever dreamed of getting as support. So yeah try to communicate for one of them to come down to jungle, but if no one listens, then have a plan b aside from ping spamming."
vainglorygame,3c1rjr,Glory_DrEvil,5,Sat Jul 4 05:29:06 2015 UTC,There is nothing worse than someone who thinks they know better than you and pings the whole match. They might have an excuse of being a new player who is learning; there is no excuse for being an asshole. Don't be a Ping General.
vainglorygame,3c1rjr,redditor29198,2,Sat Jul 4 06:07:08 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it helps to ping the green ""go"" ping. Yesterday I played a game in casual with double laners. When I pinged, Ringo came down to help in the jungle. He understood IGC mechanics. Might just like playing Ringo and, since it was casual, didn't mind going with an off meta comp. Pretty sure we lost that one but it was a good game.  Most of the time you have to adapt. Also, being the person who positively pings on objectives, which enemy to target and to initiate/check bushes if you're not the one who ought to to do it should be considered a part of the game if you want to climb ranked. When I'm on my ping game, or I have a teammate who is, we usually steamroll the other team. I'm still not very good at pinging the enemy to target in the middle of a team fight though. It's also a matter of balance. If you've got cohesion without pinging then don't do it much. And don't ping negatively. I'm starting to get into the habit of negatively pinging people who negatively ping and honestly, it accomplishes nothing. Those people might not play like I do, or they might not know how to play well, but they either know what they're doing and it's not a strategy I'm recognizing or they think they do. Negative pings only hurt your team cohesion and morale.  Edited to add: One other thing, be willing to compromise. If you ping to go one way and another person pings to go another way, and you need to stay together, go with them. You're better off that way. Consider the pings as suggestions, not orders. You're working with these people. In some cases you will be the leader because the other people on your team are inexperienced and they recognize that. In other cases you'll find yourself on a committee. Other times still you'll be following someone else along."

As much as it sucks to have to deal with an OP meta, a fix can just as easily break something else if it's not done properly.  That's why SEMC has started bringing in actual players to test future patches"
vainglorygame,3c0mfq,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:32:24 2015 UTC,What I meant is to revert the hero back to its original state for temporary amount of time before the actual balance? It obviously takes time to come up with how but why not just revert them temporarily. After the Tank Skaarf stuff he ended up being arguably worse than before the buff anyways I miss the original Skaarf. Sometimes there isn't even a way to revert it such as with Tank Koshka. That was simple her B gave her too much damage without even any damage items. Her perk gave her 64 armour also. Most of the time it's easy to balance but they just save it for the next update which is irritating since people get carried up the ranks with those heroes.
vainglorygame,3c0mfq,treboR-,5,Sat Jul 4 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"Skaarf is in a weird spot.  He's my main, and I will always return to him every update and have fun playing him. But he just needs too much to stay strong throughout the game keep that in mind when you play him. His early game is weak so don't expect to accomplish much in jungle early and focus on farming until you can feel your pokes hurt.  With that said here's how I build him now: Starting item swift shooter and two potions  Farm lane and try to get about 900 gold before shopping.  If you can do that uninterrupted get: a second swift shooter, a battery, and boots. Return to lane.  Next start building your shatterglass. Once it's done you should feel your pokes become much stronger.  After that build an eve and broken myth. If you have money for an ac build it otherwise build defense according to how the game is progressing.   The hardest things about skaarf right now are 1v1 fights and farming. Farming early game is a pain, and essential to keeping him relevant throughout the rest of the game. If you get too farm behind on farm, you'll feel it. Focus on not dying and keeping up with the enemy laner.   In 1v1 fights, the spitfire is so easy to dodge now it can spell your doom. If you miss you need to get back to your turret, if you don't follow up with a few auto attacks and goop.    Your ult isn't gonna be super strong levels 6-9 so don't rely on it. Practice landing those spitfires and use goop. Also sometimes it helps your team more to drop a goop without burning it for the slow. Keep that in mind as a great zoning weapon.  I can go on and on about this.. So I'll leave it as is right now, but if you have questions I'd be happy to answer them!"
vainglorygame,3c0mfq,Glory_DrEvil,2,Fri Jul 3 19:37:55 2015 UTC,Do you foresee any future slight buffs to Skaarf? I miss playing him dearly.
vainglorygame,3c0mfq,neurotoxicguitar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:31:44 2015 UTC,"Well the devs are constantly looking at heroes viability both in high tiers and low tiers. They'd also rather a hero be unviable than have them be OP and toxic. So that's where skaarf is. They know he needs some changes and improvements, but considering how toxic he was recently, he wasn't a high priority for this update.   I definitely expect them to bring him back to the fold, he's in a place right now where his late game is good and balanced, but his early game is just terrible. So hopefully some minor changes to his early game will bring him in line.   In the meantime, I'm enjoying him in casual, but I don't expect to see a lot of him in ranked or competitions."

vainglorygame,3c0mfq,DeafSmithVG,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:45:31 2015 UTC,Haven't built that in a very long time. Since the eve Nerf. I see people still build it occasionally with varying levels of success.. But personally I don't see it as strong as it used to be
vainglorygame,3c0mfq,Glory_DrEvil,0,Fri Jul 3 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing is his spitfire now. I can see the drastic lowering of speed when his hitbox was huge, but now it's incredibly slow and it feels half as big so skill shots are extremely hard to hit, especially in the jungle when enemies can choose all kinds of angles to dodge with. There are times where as a S kaarf main I'll just flat out whiff shots that were once money. Another thing is that it feels like his slighlty weak sauce and until level 11 or 12 it's alot more of a risk than a reward. For now I'm just practicing and trying to improve, but it just feels like with a reliable stun, easier to land helio orbs, and a devastatingly destructive ult, Celeste is almost a no brainer when choosing from the current mage options. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, his spitfire is nice and powerful and they made a cool feature where it passes through enemies and does lowered damage for every hit and this has made farming in the lane much more gold efficient to where a swift shooter may be a luxury and not a lane necessity. I will always love skaarf and that's proven by my purchase of his AWESOME tier 1 skin. Currently he gets torn apart in POA tier,but he's very fun in casual and I can't wait to play him now and I'm future updates!"

vainglorygame,3bzfgr,Furniss8u,6,Fri Jul 3 11:44:01 2015 UTC,"Aftershock is a must have on Koshka always make it your first item.  It synergizes really well with the bonus damage from Twirly Death to chunk out a target.  If you don't build her tanky then you have to play her as hit-and-run.  Jump in on a target with Pouncy Fun, use Twirly Death for the bonus damage and hit them.  If you have the follow up from your teammates then stay in the fight attacking to lower the cooldowns on your abilities.  If your teammates got chunked out then use the speed you got from Koshka's Heroic Perk to get out.  Yummy Catnip Frenzy should be used on the enemy laner or jungle carry, whichever one is easier to kill.  Sometimes it's fine to use it on the support/tank if they are caught out by themselves.  Also, don't be afraid to use your ult to save someone instead of using it as an initiation tool.  I also max out Pouncy Fun instead of Yummy Catnip Frenzy to make chasing/doing damage that much easier with the lower cooldown.  Personally when I play Koshka my item builds differ depending on how well I'm doing and my team comp.  If I'm with a Cath/Ardan/Fortress then I'll build one or two defensive items, boots, and the rest would be straight damage.  If I'm with Taka/Krul/Rona then I'll normally default to the support and build straight tank after I get Aftershock.  It gets to be a toss up with Adagio/Glaive/Joule, depends on whether they get rolling faster or not.  My general item build is: 2 Health pots/Crystal Bit or IGC -> Eclipse Prism/Hourglass/Boots/Reflex -> Aftershock/Void Battery/Crucible -> Eve/T2 Boots/Another CP item or defensive item.  I like getting Atlas Pauldron when there's a Ringo or Krul to slow their attacks since I'm gonna be jumping in anyway.  Fountain is good to get if your support doesn't already have one.  I like getting Broken Myth as my third CP item since if I'm getting to that point the enemy team is probably being smart and building shield.  I usually don't get Shatterglass unless the enemy team isn't building any shield."
vainglorygame,3bzfgr,Koozaza,0,Fri Jul 3 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"I would not reccomend eve on koshka, shatterglass and broken myth are both items that are a much better fit for her. Eve is most useful on CP laners like celeste, vox, Joule, etc..  My typical build for Koshka is as follows  rushed aftershock  Boots  Shatteglass  Broken myth  Defense (counter built)  Situational, either more offense or more defense for the last spot.  Also, crystal infusions are very helpful before major teamfights"
vainglorygame,3bzfgr,ifuckinglovekatara,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:31:13 2015 UTC,I find Eve useful because at times you can find yourself low on energy and it has decent CP while also giving energy regen.  The lifesteal can help you stay alive when you jump into the middle of the fight.
vainglorygame,3bzfgr,Koozaza,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:38:02 2015 UTC,Eve hands down over BM in this situation. You're going front lines with a melee character so you know you're going to eat some punches. It's the same reason I stick a SM on my Joule right now.
vainglorygame,3bzfgr,MARSpu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:49:16 2015 UTC,Honestly she doesn't stay in fights long enough for a broken myth and the energy regen is nice as /u/Koozaza pointed out. I could see going for shatter glass but the eve helps longevity especially if the other team is hitting hard.
vainglorygame,3bzfgr,FireZeMissiles,2,Mon Jul 6 03:22:11 2015 UTC,"The above said tips are great.   Also you can go between a group of lane minions, do a Twirly Death (TD) and get good amount of TD stacks.  Now you are free to use these stacks in the jungle for some fast farming, or you can use them against enemy heroes. Each TD stack is a free boosted attack. You can see the TD stacks number and Heroic perk stacks on the bottom left side of the screen.  Lane serves as a good escape in some situations. Your A ability is a gap closer. You choose a minion and do your A ability on it to gain separation from chasing opponents. Also doing a TD between minions gives you huge speed boost which can be even bigger than the boots sprint. That's because of Koshka's heroic perk.  It's always good to do TD between a group of enemies. You damage everyone with your TD and you get extra stacks which means extra boosted attacks. Back in the days, this used to be Koshka's bread and butter during level 1 team fights.  When you have high TD stacks, don't hesitate to use them on your chosen target, say Celeste. Keep up the auto attacks and watch them melt. Just watch out for their team mates.  Koshka is superb at taking down the turrets. Specially when you have Aftershock and TD stacks. You can take down a turret very fast. Don't hesitate to use the TD stacks on turrets if you feel safe.   Other than that what I see a problem with Koshka's at low to mid tier is impatience. You don't HAVE to use your Ult if it's ready, be patient with it. Never jump into 3 enemy heroes. Let your support initiate the fight. You are gonna eat all the burst damage if you jump first and you'll be dead in the blink of an eye. Learn to stay under control.   Koshka's ult can save lives if you cancel someone's ult with it. Specially Skaarf, Adagio and other area-of-effect ultimates. And it's very easy to do that, if your opponents don't use reflex block. The biggest utility of Koshka's ult is the stun.   Always pick your targets based upon the enemy team composition and build. Mostly as an assassin, your target should be the enemy laner or any other squishy character with high damage. It's your duty to take care of Saws, Ringos, Celestes, & Voxes.  If you have built AS, and the opponent support has built a lot of health (Ardans?), then you are the perfect counter to them. AS does %health damage and lifesteal making it a perfect counter to HP items. But still, your target should be the squishy ones.   An ideal Koshka sequence is when you enter the fight, do the damage to your target, and run away when you are getting low on health. Chances are your opponents will try to chase you because you are close to getting killed, but because of your heroic speed boost and preferably boots sprint, they can't keep up with you. And by that time, your teammates take them down.   Do not waste your burst damage on a face-checking Catherine/Ardan/any support. I come across so many trigger happy Koshka players who spam their Ult at the very first sight of any moving thing.   Do not go 1on1 with Krul unless you have a huge level advantage. Krul is your kryptonite. Always prioritize having boots and reflex block ready if you have an opponent Krul. Atlas is a good counter build item against Krul. In team fights, your ult with its stun can help taking down Krul. Stun is Krul's weakness.   Other than that, learn how to use IGC and don't steal your laner's minions!"

vainglorygame,3bzfgr,Goonie_GooGoo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:40:36 2015 UTC,"I do agree that aftershock is a great item on her, but I build a more sustainable damage output on her than the AS approach.   My build is 3-4 crystal bits into two heavy prisms and an eclipse shard with boots, then into Shatterglass and Broken Myth. From there I build one defense item and more damage, either with AS or Frostburn.   Max A and B, and use your C ability when focusing down the carry or stunning someone out of an ult. Don't try using your C near an enemy turret as you'll get sling-shot way too far and probably die.  Try not to get caught by yourself as you are quite squishy, at least until you get a feel for her speed perk and can run away reliably.   Your tactics should resemble an assassin, hit and run! It's always best to play it safe with her at first, leaving the risky moves until you're comfotable."

vainglorygame,3bzfgr,GrandpaSkitzo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that Twirly Death makes her subsequent basic attacks stronger.

Krul isn't super strong early game, but he can become a beast later on. If you invade the enemy jungle right off he bat with everyone and are able to steal their jungle, that's a good sign. Just keep stealing their jungle creeps and starve them of money in their own jungle. Krul can't become strong if he doesn't have any money, and I really like early game Rona for those invades.  Also, people are always saying how Ardan Rona works so well, but I have found that Fortress Rona works just as well if not better.  As for red mist and stuns, try to make them waste their stuns before hand. Dont jump into a teamfights and immediately rely on red mist. Try and fight without it and use it towards the end of he battle, or to finish off your enemies while their are running away."

vainglorygame,3bx9ca,Dolomyze,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:29:53 2015 UTC,Yea that's what I meant. A solo practice but you could have up to three bots with like easy medium and hard levels of difficulty on the bots
vainglorygame,3bx9ca,Musa_,3,Fri Jul 3 21:45:50 2015 UTC,I would love for this feature to be added for Co op against bots. This way you can try any hero with actual teammates and go against bots (even though they are very easy) to test out which heroes you want to buy. Like an actual field-test to practice a hero that's not in free rotation.

vainglorygame,3bw12h,Kraken_SEMC,3,Thu Jul 2 18:43:48 2015 UTC,"What about a post-game chat with every player? I'm guessing the main reason not to implement this would be fear of toxicity, but I don't think that would be such an issue if you can leave with a single button tap. Most of the times I'd love to tell both my allies and enemies gg, regardless of the outcome, and it could also lead to some interesting analysis beyond that."
vainglorygame,3bw12h,teddim,10,Thu Jul 2 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"Even if people could leave if they felt it was toxic, the effect has already happened - their experience has been greatly degraded from it. That said, I do have some plans that should scratch this itch without it being as easily abused."
vainglorygame,3bw12h,Kraken_SEMC,6,Thu Jul 2 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. What about having to manually tap a ""join chat"" button?"
vainglorygame,3bw12h,teddim,6,Thu Jul 2 20:25:41 2015 UTC,It's not a bad idea. I'd rather not spell out all of the details of my in-progress design since a lot can change as we build and test it.
vainglorygame,3bw12h,Kraken_SEMC,2,Thu Jul 2 23:54:12 2015 UTC,Wasn't trying to have you leak any information! I just hope your concerns regarding toxicity don't limit the feature set of fair players too much. :) I'm sure you'll eventually come up with the best way to handle this.

vainglorygame,3bw12h,Sa10aep,8,Thu Jul 2 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"So many thumbs up to this. It also feels sort of presumptuous to invite somebody to be your friend based off a single game. But I would love to be able to volunteer to party up and then if we're still getting along well after a couple games you add them to the friends list.  Furthermore, it could help SEMC differentiate between actual premade teams and ""teams"" that are just three friendly solo-queuers. I know a lot of people (myself included) feel that the bump to your team ELO when you party up after a solo queue match is overly harsh. The matches tend to be really difficult because the matchmaker assumes you're a real team when in actuality you have a single game of experience playing together. Perhaps the ELO-raise could be smaller for partied-up groups who meet in solo-queue than for those that are actually friends."
vainglorygame,3bw12h,thenamestsam,8,Thu Jul 2 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"+1 to this, that would be fantastic."
vainglorygame,3bw12h,adyendrus,3,Thu Jul 2 17:42:04 2015 UTC,"This sort of happened for me in my first experience in casual queue. I was playing solo, and had one of the guys from my team on my friend's list. He messaged gg, and we partied up, and enjoyed ourselves for a few more games just naturally. We were around the same skill level (ok, so he was much better than me, I'll admit it), and we were on the same page in the game before. I think the suggested feature would make it even more painless."

vainglorygame,3bxj9p,pilgrimnl,6,Thu Jul 2 23:46:56 2015 UTC,Two members of your team having a Bonesaw would simply allow you to get to 5 stacks more quickly. The Bonesaw stacks are a debuff on the target and the target can never have more than 5 stacks no matter how many Bonesaws the opposing team may have.
vainglorygame,3bxj9p,jklick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:20:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you've done the math, is it any good to have two Bonesaws on your team?"

vainglorygame,3bvoye,addinsolent,18,Thu Jul 2 15:13:07 2015 UTC,Totally agree with you. This is a high priority fix I want to get in.
vainglorygame,3bvoye,Kraken_SEMC,3,Thu Jul 2 18:44:28 2015 UTC,I also sometimes fat finger what I'm thumbs downing for...a player afk'd and I accidentally hit something else.  Also lets say in theory I play 10 games and in all 10 games somebody afk's and I thumbs them down every time...does my thumbs down get ignored or does the system recognize that I'm doing legit thumbs down?
vainglorygame,3bvoye,KingQuet90,3,Fri Jul 3 00:04:46 2015 UTC,The more you thumbs-down the less it counts.
vainglorygame,3bvoye,Kraken_SEMC,3,Fri Jul 3 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"Does thumb down for ""Unskilled play"" affect people's karma too? Seems kind of arbitrary, like lots of factors can go into ""unskilled play"" someone might have an off game, or get auto-locked out of heroes they normally play.   Obviously abusing this thumbs down can go against you too, as you said, it counts less."

vainglorygame,3bvoye,KingQuet90,2,Fri Jul 3 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I dunno, I am little scared to thumbs down too much because I don't want it to affect me, but yesterday I went 0-4 in casual q and 3 of those 4 games I had rage pingers, so I feel obligated to call it out, but I don't want to dilute my thumbs down worth either."
vainglorygame,3bvoye,FightasticMG,2,Fri Jul 3 00:48:59 2015 UTC,Yea I've been sparing with rage pingers...but i usually thumbs down afk's on either team...Its not every game like my example...but I don't want it to be too many times.
vainglorygame,3bvoye,redditor29198,3,Fri Jul 3 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"I would rather hit the rage pingers with it rather than the AFKs.

With rage pingers, you know what you're getting. I'd rather thumb those down."

vainglorygame,3bvoye,KingQuet90,3,Thu Jul 2 17:21:08 2015 UTC,I think it would be nice to atleast go back one game and fix thumbs up up and thumbs down as well as add a person or just review the game in general...sometimes I wanna screen shot a match and forgot.

vainglorygame,3bx2pe,upstart_crow,4,Thu Jul 2 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"Few games back we had a Taka who wanted to surrender as soon as we lost our 1st turret. He was pissed at the lack of coordination. We declined it, so he sold all his stuff and sat at the base.  Meanwhile me (Krul) and Vox kept playing and we aced the other team twice. We stole the kraken after and finally, the game was left with no turrets for either team.  Our Taka realized we had a chance so he bought boots, warhorn and clockwork and tried helping.  He sneaked into the enemy base and if he had even one sorrowblade, he could have shattered the vein. We ended up losing. I hope that Taka learned his lesson."
vainglorygame,3bx2pe,Vet24,2,Fri Jul 3 09:41:13 2015 UTC,If he has a sorrowblade he would have only done 50 extra damage. Still a dick move to AFK because a surrender was refused.

vainglorygame,3bx2pe,Vet24,8,Sat Jul 4 08:11:33 2015 UTC,I like playing 2v3 until I see there is no hope.   I deny surrenders if all it does is prevent us from watching our vain collapse. Seems like sour grapes to an earned perk of winning.
vainglorygame,3bx2pe,peterkeats,4,Thu Jul 2 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those people that would rather not surrender. I like the 2v3 matches. I often lose those, but it's a fun challenge and I learn from them. However, I'm often conflicted on the matter because I hate to feel like I'm holding my teammate hostage. If my teammate starts to give signs that he's given up or he's ? pinging me, I often take the hint.  Once upon a time, I had a game where a teammate abandoned and I was expecting my teammate to propose a surrender vote, but it never came. It was really nice to find a like-minded person in the Fold. We proceeded to do our best to choose our battles carefully, particularly when an opponent got out of position or got greedy. We were able to barely pull off a win due to some late game mistakes by the opposing team which resulted in us rushing down a bunch of turrets.  Win or lose, I think 2v3's are great learning experiences."
vainglorygame,3bx2pe,jklick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:43:11 2015 UTC,"As I said in another comment, its not your right to hold your remaining teammate hostage just because you feel like being a tryhard. Respecting your teammates also includes respecting their desire to surrender, and an afk game is not the time to exert your will too strongly. Its very reasonable to surrender an afk game and start up a new fair match. As I said in my original post, its not about winning or losing, at least not for me. I don't find 2v3 games satisfying, even if I'm on the winning side. There's nothing wrong with wanting to restart a balanced match and save myself 30 minutes of my life."
vainglorygame,3bx2pe,peterkeats,-4,Fri Jul 3 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"I think considering seeing the vain collapse as a ""perk"" of winning is a bit ridiculous, maybe even childish. The game itself is far more interesting than a silly time-consuming graphic effect at the end."

If it seems like you are surrendering just to beat them to your vain, then I won't surrender. If we're just getting owned and we still have towers, but somehow they are clearly the better team, and we all keep getting Aced, I agree with the surrender.   The thing is, I have been part of so many comebacks where teammates are insistent on surrendering that it's hard to really judge when you are inevitably losing, or just giving up."

vainglorygame,3bx2pe,DigitalBounce,3,Thu Jul 2 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"Sometimes those ""expert"" players who want to surrender are just being petulant and/or impatient because their teammates aren't playing the way s/he wants them to.   Especially in this game, the longer the match goes, the more chance you have of catching the enemy team in a mistake, acing them, and turning it around.   IMO you shouldn't surrender until you are all dead and the enemy team is on their way to your vain. And then it's more a matter of being a good sport by voluntarily conceding to the enemy team since you're not really saving much time.   In a highly competitive match where you KNOW the enemies aren't going to make mistakes and you can clearly tell they are better than your team, I can see your point. In that scenario, you team will also know each other well and you will all agree to surrender together. But I don't think that applies to most VG matches."

But I'm not sure if that just means trading your character cards for cards of another character.   I am a little dissaponted in the ICE card system. $1 per card seems a little steep to me. I wish they could just put a price tag on a skin as well as being able to obtain them with cards.   Perhaps having a price tag to finish a skin and that price goes down for each card that you obtain. So if a skin is 10,000 ice. Which seems to be what it is if you buy ICE card packs and I have 1/2 of the cards needed to build the skin, then the price of the skin could go to 5,000 ice.   However I'm guessing that SEMC knows what they're doing. It seems like they are going after the 0.02% of the player base that will spend a lot of money on the game and trying to milk them. The card system just seems silly to me.  I would rather just buy a skin and not mess with cards. Tier 1 skin is $10 right now, so make tier 2 $20 and tier 3 $50, or whatever."
vainglorygame,3bwp43,_DelGriffith_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:59:59 2015 UTC,The card system makes it fun though. It distinguishes this game from other mundane transactions.

It distinguishes it from other games that you can earn the skins through loyalty.   This game is casual, though, so unless you play for about a year, you'll never be able to get a tier 2 or 3 skins without the Get Cards function. I think Rare card requirements are way too high to be feasible, even with the Get Cards function.   I like the idea of blind random trades; you put your card into a pile, and pull one out. No clue what you'll get, but put in a Legendary and get a Legendary. Costs a little Glory per trade."

vainglorygame,3bxa7f,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:22 2015 UTC,I agree with this especially with the addition of the Card Boxes and requiring you spend glory for common cards. Even if it was just a 2x glory multiplier. That way you still have to play games and work to get glory just at dbl the pace.
vainglorygame,3bxa7f,BlueDmon,-2,Thu Jul 2 22:53:00 2015 UTC,"Why do this I don't like how players with ice can get glory faster than us if this gets implemented. If this ever gets implemented  that is when I think it is starting to turn into a purchase based game and I really dislike it. And no I'm not saying it's turning into ""Buy this and be better than everyone else in the game."""
vainglorygame,3bxa7f,treboR-,2,Fri Jul 3 13:39:00 2015 UTC,"Except, buying ICE to get a double glory multiplier does not impact your skills at the game at all. You could have all Tier 3 skins and own all the heroes and still suck like your first day of playing. Implementing a Glory Boost will in no way make this game Pay to Win. For those that don't want to spend the large amounts of time it takes to grind glory (because most people have lives) this would be a welcome addition to the shop."
vainglorygame,3bxa7f,nyadav,0,Fri Jul 3 21:19:24 2015 UTC,I just don't like the idea downvote me all you want. It's not hard to farm 800 glory which is enough for one skin.

vainglorygame,3bxa7f,treboR-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"First off, I didn't downvote you. Secondly, I'm not sure what you've been looking at but there is no way to get a skin for 800 glory. All tier 1 skins can only be bought with 900 ICE or weaving cards, no glory purchase option. And the tier 2 and 3 can only be weaved with cards. Now that they have the card boxes, it makes it easier to get a skin (even though it will still take a long time to get the tier 3 without spending a ton of money)."

I can never SoloQ anymore because someone either afks, feed, or has a skin (these people are almost always bad).

vainglorygame,3bv3bx,An0therk,3,Thu Jul 2 11:51:45 2015 UTC,"As someone who tries to play support in the lower tiers, I usually start off with IGC, but every once in a while, I end up with a team of fools.  I think a better PSA would be to check the scoreboard before you leave home base, and also continually check the scoreboard to see how you can help your teammates and maximize your bang for your buck."
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,yourMOMvg,2,Thu Jul 2 12:27:35 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to clarify that only two hits matter: the first hit and the last hit.   Support takes the first hit, carry takes the last hit = max gold + health rebate. It doesn't matter who's ""tanking"" it in between.  As a support in early game, if I'm missing some health, I'll often poke the creep with a first hit, then run away and let my jungler tank it for the kill. In the course of clearing our jungle, I get healed up a bit by IGC while any damage my carry takes is healed by the health creeps. Combined with a fountain, I rarely ever need to go back to base as a support.   Not all junglers understand this, though, and ping me if I try to let them tank it. And some of them don't even understand that they'll get 30% more gold if they wait for me to hit first.  And yeah, buying two contracts for junglers seems redundant unless you really do have trouble coordinating with each other for those first & last hits, which is why I usually assume people don't know what they're doing when I see two IGC's at the start of the match.   Granted, hanging out in the lane will always make a contract pay for itself, but it seems that having a regularly rotating jungle clear would earn gold more efficiently."
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,halcyon400,3,Thu Jul 2 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"A single ironguard purchase isn't enough to lose the game for you. In fact, it always pays for itself. It just delays your power band.   Likely what you are experiencing is low skill play and attributing it to ironguard, which is a symptom.  I would argue that in a high-Elo match that if both kinglets got ironguard they would make it out of early game just fine."
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,xmaveric,2,Thu Jul 2 12:34:07 2015 UTC,"If they are both laning, then it is beneficial for both to get ironguard. That way an extra 50% gold on kill will be awarded to the other laner. And with both ironguard, it won't matter who gets the last hit"
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,dudethisis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:00:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry I meant to say junglers, but I still disagree.  The whole point of ironguard contract is your support is supposed to soak up creep damage while the carry last hits and stays full health.  Then the gold is equally shared while your support is given health.  If two laners or junglers get IGC then there is less money shares between and you will instantly have a disadvantage to the enemy team. And be at a disadvantage in firepower as you get no attack benefits against enemy heroes."
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,dudethisis,4,Thu Jul 2 12:05:15 2015 UTC,The gold is not shared between the 2 laners.  When one laner kills a minion he gets 100% of that gold. The second laner next to him gets 30% bonus gold. That's how the Ironguard works. On average two laners will earn 130% of lane gold if both have ironguard. In the long run it'll definitely be worth the initial 300 gold spent  That said it's a lot less beneficial for both junglers to both have the IGC.
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,ThreeBlindMice_7,2,Thu Jul 2 12:22:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the IGC gold granted to he person who does not kill a minion/camp is 50% and that the bonus gold for the person last hitting is 30%... I might be wrong there.
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,ShinakoX2,2,Thu Jul 2 17:34:42 2015 UTC,The bonus gold for last hitting is only awarded if the person with IGC is tanking the minion
vainglorygame,3bv3bx,theSDRexperiment,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:53 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it happens accidentally when neither jungler is sure which is taking contract.  Both people watch the scoreboard for a moment looking to see if the other took contract, and then simultaneously decide ""fuck it, I'll take contract then"" and end up with double contract.  Outside of early invade weakness it doesn't make much difference in the long run, and on the bright side it makes clearing jungle waves very smooth.  No worrying about accidentally stealing last hits or whatever."

I know it's hard because this game is awesome and addicting but you should only be playing 2 ranked games a day.

Another thing I've been trying to work on is trying to figure out how I can help my foolish teammates better.  I've realized that my fool for a teammate thinks he's helping, and that I'm the problem.  For example, he's pissed that I'm not pushing the lane with him, even though I see that every time he does that he's walking into a 3 person gank.  He sees it like I'm leaving him out there to hang with no support, and where did my teammates go? You're not gonna change this guy's mind, so you've got to come up with a better strategy to help.    Personally, I get a kick out of winning games when I've got a teammate spamming question marks on me and our mutual teammate - ""no buddy, you're the problem.""  But what makes the game addictive is that you want to replicate the feeling when you get 2 other teammates who ""get it,"" so we're willing to suffer through bad games to get to the awesome ones where you stomp the other team.

vainglorygame,3buyc3,yourMOMvg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:59:05 2015 UTC,"Breathe and count to 10.  But seriously if in ranked you are matched with 5 random players (2 on your team, 3 on the other) that should all be around your current skill level, maybe sometimes you get matched with slightly worse players, but it is equally likely to get matched with slightly better players. Given this, the determining factor is your skill over a long period of time. Also, as for afks and disconnects, if every other player has an equal chance to afk, then (and I'm assuming)  since you don't afk/disconnect, you will have a greater chance of an enemy afk than one on your team, 50% more likely. So if you continue to play well then it will be fine anyway.   But mostly remember it's a game and try to have fun, I now it can be frustrating depending on your team so much in a game like this and there are probably some general anger management techniques you can use, but your rank ultimately will reflect your true rank after enough games anyway"

vainglorygame,3buyc3,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:05:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the sunshine and rainbows crowd giving you all this good general advice about controlling your anger and suggest something different.  Assume the worst.  Imagine that this is a game designed to give you the two most incompetent ""allies"" it can find and that they and the three opponents are all working in unison to ensure you never succeed.  That way the rage pinging saw instalocker that wanted you to join his 1 on 3 suicide mission will make sense; it's not an anomaly, it's just normal.  Then, when you get a good team that works together like a unit the high will be much higher.  When your laner drops down to the jungle to tip the balance on that 2 on 2 you just wandered into you'll be so surprised that you'll experience a strange emotion you've only heard about before: joy.  This is how I play ranked now.  I go into it thinking (I prefer to imagine it in angry comedian Lewis Black's voice for some reason) ""Now how will these idiotic assholes fuck me this time?  Oh, look, we're starting double off-meta laners again.  Isn't that perfect."""
vainglorygame,3bw2ol,adambware,5,Thu Jul 2 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"I think typically Petal isn't going to be your ironguarder. But yeah, it does make it harder to stop attacking at will whenever you want your teammate to get a last hit. Just have to be more careful with it I guess."

vainglorygame,3bw1a0,selftaster,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:34:32 2015 UTC,All I learned is that krul is ridiculously op. Me and my two teammates were going at krul for a good 30 seconds and he almost got us killed but we were finally able to kill him.  Isn't that a little to powerful?  Idk this game gets me so upset sometimes with its unbalanced heroes  Edit: down voting is not a disagree button.

I noticed that I got matched down in all my games so I was playing with The Hotness and SA players. I just assumed that player elo was rounded down slightly.   Keep playing and you'll end up playing against players around your skill level or you'll get better. Either way, you'll win more later."

So you may be been against a PoA a not bad and a hotness and been paired with similar rankings. It's more like scales in casual, and they just make sure that the comp balances on both sides even though you have 3 different sized objects."

vainglorygame,3bw1a0,ThreeBlindMice_7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:34:24 2015 UTC,It's no fun to get wrecked though. At least for me it's not. All these simply amazing/PoA/vainglorious people that can't take on someone their own size goes to casual just to wreck us casuals who can't play 10% of the time they play.
vainglorygame,3bw1a0,solid77,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:36:21 2015 UTC,"We don't go to casual to wreck on low tier people. We play casual because we don't want to be try hard or to experiment. And if there's enough high tier people, we get paired with them over people in lower tiers... But occasionally, I find myself matched with or against someone in hotness or pretty good. It's not usually a bad game, but it happens.   Go ask anyone in high tiers, a lot of them feel bad when matched against someone in low tiers. Yeah it's sucks being in a game you have no chance of winning, but try to take it as a learning experience of either what to do, or what not to do."
vainglorygame,3bus3u,coasttocoastkid,2,Thu Jul 2 09:14:17 2015 UTC,Is anything happening specifically like your team getting aced or them chunking out one or more people?  Some extra details would be helpful to try and help you.
vainglorygame,3bus3u,Koozaza,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:23:01 2015 UTC,"Usually it'll become a 3v1 and I won't be sure what I should do against the whole team, but being aced did happen once or twice that was also a major turning point. Another thing that changed the tides a lot was the other team getting Kraken or my teammates not joining to get Kraken."
vainglorygame,3bus3u,Koozaza,4,Thu Jul 2 09:25:56 2015 UTC,"Kind of sounds like your team as a whole doesn't know when to disengage a fight, but you can't really fault anyone for that since it's Casual yoloqueue.  Try to make use of the caution ping if you see your teammates moving towards bushes when you don't have vision or a turret nearby.  Also, don't be afraid to buy a few scout traps and place them in bushes to avoid ganks.  Vision will help out immensely when you want to take an objective like a Minion Mine/Kraken/Turret.  Now, your teammates might not keep an eye on the mini map, but you should make it a good habit to do.  If you end up 1v3 then the best thing you can do is to try and defend your turrets as best you can by taking out the minions, so the enemy team has to choose between taking the turret hits themselves or backing off.  It's kind of hard on Koshka if you haven't played her a bunch and know the limits of the hero, but that will come with more games.  Petal is easier to defend 1v3 since she has a longer attack range and Munions to kill the minions/attack enemies.  If you find yourself 1v3, but they aren't pushing a turret then that either means they are taking all of your jungle or they are taking Kraken.  Placing a scout trap in the Kraken pit off to one side will help you figure out what they are doing since you'll either see them pull Kraken out of the pit or stay and fight it.  If you don't see them doing Kraken then stay out of your jungle and go to the nearest turret for safety.  Or they could be doing the worst thing and backed to shop/heal...never do that if you find yourself 3v1, always push your advantage.  Getting Aced at 15+ minutes into a game is something that will snowball the game away from you even if you had a huge lead before that.  It basically allows a full bar of health/mana for each enemy that survived and lets them take Kraken followed by another round of regen.  Even if they don't stay with the Kraken at first, they will meet up with it after taking everything in your side of the jungle.  Another thing I'm just gonna guess at is that you/your team aren't building enough defense to limit the amount of damage taken during a fight.  It's not too bad when it's early and not too many items are finished or no one is that high of a level.  However, once the carries start getting 2-3 items and hit level 8-12 then it gets to be really bad when you don't have any defense or the right defense to counter the damage type they are building.  Shield for CP and Armor for WP.  TL;DR - Know when to disengage a fight, have vision, be aware of enemy movements, build correct defensive items."

vainglorygame,3bus3u,PYKNICS,2,Thu Jul 2 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"By late game the other team has probably figured out who the glass cannon was on your team and either focused on them during team fights or counter built defense...at that point it really turns into a team game, stick together (behind your tank), don't engage if you can't take a hit and if all else fails straddle your turret until you can take one or two of the opposing side out and burn down their objectives during their respawn timer."
vainglorygame,3bus3u,ThreeBlindMice_7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"In addition to other comments below, although this doesn't help you ""finish things,"" keep an eye on the enemy's comp. Heroes like Krul, or CP Vox, or WP Joule, etc. all have very powerful late games, and there are others I just can't think of right now. If you're facing them, you either have to shut them out early, which it sounds like you're having little trouble doing, or focus them on the team fights, which is much harder to do, as they'll still have the power-spike advantage."

I had a ranked this morning where I accidentally took a last hit with Fortress and my team's Taka proceeded to throw a hissy fit every time I went near a jungle monster.  Transcript of me going near any jungle monsters with him after that:  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?   I played three games in casual after that debacle ended, and they were all pretty good games.

vainglorygame,3btldo,Come_on-Man,5,Thu Jul 2 01:14:02 2015 UTC,"I've found her early game to be god awful, but mid to late she is a bit OP. I've been dominating with her since the release (a lot of games I'll kill above 10 and die 3 or less). I build frostburn, shatterglass, broken myth, fountain of renewal, and tier 3 boots. Then go for crystal injections super late game. I think she requires a lot more skill than people realize. Just cause she's an extreme sniper doesn't mean you can hang back and just sit there. My strategy is using crystal power minions, attack a hero (and getting close enough so that they start following you), then run away. But your minions will be auto locked on them until they're out of sight doing crazy damage mid to late game as long as the enemy can't catch you (she synergizes really well with cath and ardan in the jungle!!) If it's a squishy hero you can kill them in no time. Tanks are a bit trickier but you can eat away at them pretty well. I also only jungle with her. Lane petal isn't that great anymore especially against vox or Celeste."
vainglorygame,3btldo,divergence-aloft,9,Thu Jul 2 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Petal myself, but I have played with a bunch of petals since the update, and have seen kinda the same stuff.

vainglorygame,3btldo,MrTouchnGo,3,Thu Jul 2 02:34:12 2015 UTC,"Had my support Catherine paired up with a jungle Petal earlier, and maybe it was a lopsided matchup, but we (mainly she) dominated the jungle, with her minions ripping stuff up.  I play alot of support Cath, and that was the fastest jungle clearing I've ever(?) seen.  I forgot her exact build, but it was mainly support items (including Contraption), health, and boots (and maybe one shatterglass/CP item late game?).  I haven't touched Petal for a while, but I'll be trying it out in casual.  Actually, looking on vgf, I think it was pretty similar to this build, but definitely with a Contraption in there somewhere."
vainglorygame,3btldo,Goonie_GooGoo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:51:02 2015 UTC,"My buddy and I have been running a version of this to great effect.  He plays Fortress and I play petal and we jungle.  I build her as a hybrid glass cannon that dishes damage and we generally fight ambush style, with him engaging as I lurk.  We usually end up with 20+ kills between us, and we try to avoid chasing unnecessary kills early (farm till you drop is our thing).  It doesn't work well for yolo queue, though, because if you mark jungle petal a lot of folks just think you're brain damaged.  Together with a buddy, though?  Petal + a solid support can wreck the jungle if you do it right."
vainglorygame,3btldo,Phatgoat24,2,Thu Jul 2 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"I have been playing her consistantly and I do think she needs more buffs. The munions die so quickly a crystal petal becomes usless as soon as a team fight starts. My idea for fixing this would be giving the munions a percentage of the shield/armour petal builds, giving them more survivability in the late game."
vainglorygame,3btldo,cuervomalmsteen,2,Thu Jul 2 04:11:05 2015 UTC,i haven't lost any game with Petal yet...  i find that going WP is better against players but CP is incredible againt towers. Just detonate your minions there. They just delete the buildings.
vainglorygame,3btldo,xBalutNinjax,2,Thu Jul 2 08:02:55 2015 UTC,I've been hit and miss with Petal. Either I dominate the lane early and snowball or I don't get any kills and end up dead in the first few seconds of a team fight. I might have to take her to the jungle and see how that fairs.
vainglorygame,3btldo,redditor29198,2,Thu Jul 2 09:43:57 2015 UTC,"WP Petal has been and continues to be underrated. She has incredible range and now munions are even better since the patch. CP Petal is crap because she's so expensive to make useful and then she's paper thin. She is best played as an WP attack support or an off-carry WP.   She is best played like a Warlock from WoW, always focusing on being a bit out of the radius of battle, taking advantage of her long range, buying debuff items to make her a total nuisance, and picking off running enemies. Even with WP her ult can be useful in team fights when the enemy bunches up.   You absolutely must be good at positioning and keeping out of danger too much while also engaging the enemy. Early game you want to try to bait the enemy into stupid positions, and onto traps. Now that munions are better at chasing they're even more useful. You should absolutely never be between your team and the enemy, always be a bit behind them.  Don't waste time on popping out munions unless you're engaging an enemy. Seed a lot in side bushes that don't get a lot of travel, and remember where you put them so you can suddenly munion. They're useful as distraction and a finisher and a surprise ult, especially around the small bush by tri-bush.   I almost always start with Weapon Blade into a Heavy Steel, then Blazing Salvo, then usually some kind of defense. It's most often a Life Spring because she is out of combat a lot and it helps. Usually depending on both team's composition, I'll build either a Breaking Point or a Bone Saw. I usually end up with a Shiversteel, it makes a big difference for kiting and killing enemies and 600 health is huge. I also tend to buy Weapon Infusions early, like around level 10, and a ton of potions most of the game for energy/quick healing. You rarely need more than one Tier 3 weapon item because you can kite with debuffs, and support your team with Fountain at appropriate times. I also buy lots of traps, because she can get away with not having much weapon or defense if you play her well. This build is consistently powerful from the Heavy Steel to the end of the game."

vainglorygame,3bt68a,logan5_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:36:21 2015 UTC,"That's if you buy the tier 1 with ICE. If you were to get it with cards, add 12x2 commons and 12x2 rares. Currently, unless you play a lot, it's more efficient to get it with ICE."
vainglorygame,3bt68a,Koozaza,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:47:28 2015 UTC,"No, I was calculating it without buying Tier 1 with ICE.  Maybe I should've said each instead of both, my typos didn't help either, but it made sense in my head at the time.  Each tier needs 8 of each common, so 24 of each common.  Same goes for the rares, so 24 of each rare.  4 of each epic for Tier 2/3, 8 of each epic and 3 of each legendary for the Tier 3."

There's a 99% chance they can still see you, so don't pull an ostrich.  You could check the score screen and then focus the correct person based on their name. I used to have a chess board where all the pieces looked the same, but we discerned the pieces by using a letter that we drew on them. Visually, it was very confusing at first, but then it was to my advantage when other people played on that chess board against me for the first time. However, no one will ever play on your ""chess board"" in this example, so it might not be a skill worth pursuing."

(Why don't these freakin parties enter ranked games and match up against legit teams?!) And our team mostly is just a bunch of people trying out new characters. No one gives a shit about team play. Everyone is busy farming. Most of the times, I encounter the scums of vainglory in casual mode.  I know winning is not the point in casual mode, but getting manhandled by the other team always leaves me salty.  I have had bad experience with the casual mode. But if you strictly want to use it just to test builds, then it's amazing. You are not losing your ELO so you can't even complain.  Winning should not be your first priority in casual play.   The thing I don't like about matchmaking is when you solo queue and get matched against parties. I know it's a necessary evil and there aren't enough players playing sometimes.

It wasn't even like ""Oh I just want to kill it for the money or to have both minion mines"" it was more like ""i hate this fuckn minion mine more than the enemy team and you are the number 1 priority for the rest of the game."" I spent my time as a smart taka and picked off the enemy while they were killing my teammates who never stopped for anything to kill the enemy side minion mine. Eventually the enemy team got smart and just started focusing on me letting my teammates double team the minion mine. We eventually lost and they added me because I had 23 kills.

If we aren't doing as well I will get more defence, either Crucible, Atlas or Fountain, depending on the enemy.   If we are still going then any money goes toward fusions.

After that, I base my next defensive item on the other team's comp. I'll build a weapon item very last to add a punch during crucial late game team fights. Not only are you supposed to be the team's tank, but you also have to help keep the team alive. And that's what Fountain does for you. Hope this helps."

vainglorygame,3bu8c3,calltothelostboys,10,Thu Jul 2 04:53:49 2015 UTC,"Here's my theory, take it or leave it, doesn't really affect me any.  Playing ranked solo (especially in lower ranks) is like putting Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James on the same basketball team. You have three individually great players who want to be play-makers to prove themselves. When the game doesn't look for games to be 3v1v1v1.   Everyone in solo ranked queue has the mentality that they are leading the team. No one works together, and then the ping spams start happening, which nullifies the only useful tool the game has for solo queue players to communicate with their team mates.   With communication obliterated, and all pings now raging hate, all three players on your team are now flustered and making bad decision after, bad decision. ""It's not my fault. My team mates are terrible"", ""they have such a bad attitude!!!"" so on and so forth...  Thing is, they feel the same way about you. Now, I don't know if you are a bad player or have a bad attitude. But your post leads me to believe you have at least poor attitude, which leads to frustration, which leads to poor decision-making skills, which results in your teammates thinking you are a ""shit teammate"".  When I queue ranked solo, I play passive, I don't take charge. Heck I usually have one or two others on the team that will do that work for me. I have learned to watch their playstyle the first 2-5 minutes so I know if they are aggressive, passive, or sneaky. I then adapt my playstyle to play with them and we usually do well.  Of course it doesn't happen every game, and there are toxic players out there, but I can confidently say, the people I play with almost always toss a ""thumbs up"" my way after a game, win or lose. This is a game, if you can't have fun playing it, don't play. Complaining to everyone saying the people that play this game are bad players and have bad attitude only paints the picture of yourself (as you play the game as well)  TL:DR - Don't force your playstyle when you are playing solo-ranked. You will end up playing 3v1v1v1 and you will lose. Learn your teammates playstyle, and most importantly... HAVE FUN!"
vainglorygame,3bu8c3,Spratticus,2,Thu Jul 2 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Really well said! Isn't the running theory that the downvotes would eventually weed the toxic players out? I wonder if this is just going to take some time in ranked? I've played a few games in ranked which do feel tight and many more games in casual. I've just found that folks are far more forgiving in casual so far. It seems that you should see the opposite. People in ranked would be more patient knowing that the downvotes would kick them out of ranked queue so misbehavior would be minimized. I just see in ranked that fewer players are worried about 'what do we need to do to win?' vs. criticizing a misstep. And to be frank, where I'm at in skill tier, missteps are going to happen."
vainglorygame,3bu8c3,nickmkats,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Casual is a place where you don't lose anything in a loss, so who cares if you lose? You can do pretty much whatever you want. Ranked, however, has something on the line. There, you're probably expected to follow the meta, put on your tryhard pants, and work to win games, thus resulting in less patient teammates when you make mistakes that they believed to be preventable."
vainglorygame,3bu8c3,ThreeBlindMice_7,2,Thu Jul 2 17:43:25 2015 UTC,"Great post. It seems to be a common attitude that what it means for someone else to be a ""good teammate"" is that they're doing exactly what you want at all times. Nobody ever stops to ask themselves whether they're fitting that criteria for their teammates.

Late game suggestions:  If they're down one or two teammates, immediately go for their turret, or miner/kraken, or jungle farms.  If you get an ace, immediately take as many objectives as you can, prioritizing turrets. Don't waste time shopping or farming. Don't bother clearing the lane for minions to catch up - have your support tank the turret while your carries kill it.   Prioritize farming their jungle over your own. Place mines in their jungle so you know where they are. Make their jungle your jungle.   If you die, head straight back to the front lines when you respawn, don't waste time catching up on your own jungle's farm.   Always move together whenever possible. Never be far from at least one teammate, preferably near both. If you are threatened, fall back to them, and fall back together to your turrets.   Be extra careful in late game team fights. The strategies you used to kill them earlier may no longer work as they've got better gear and/or have adapted to you.  Whenever you get a kill, immediately move to do something that you wouldn't be confident doing if that enemy was still alive. Take advantage of their momentary weakness.   If you consistently work together and push the advantage, they'll never have the opportunity to catch up to you in the late game."

I'm not big into LoL or DOTA 2 but of my friends that I have that are and that play VG they have told me the one thing that they didn't get at first is how important defense is on a carry."
vainglorygame,3bt56y,tehkyy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:21:56 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the brunt of my question: 10-15 minutes isn't late game. But if I go way ahead early, what's the best thing to do?   Options: Steal their minion mine Early gold mine + optional candy  All 3 lane Invade jungle by myself, 2 in lane, ie I can hold my own Invade 2 in jungle, one in lane, ie steal some jungle, run when lamer comes down/jump him Invade 3 jungle, oppress 2, shut them out of the game ie kill anyone cause you all run in a pack and one of you is ahead.   To me, the best options at any given moment to push a lead come down to gold suppression against the other team. Make it hard for them to farm (especially in the jungle side that's shutting down 2 heroes). The worst thing to do early, it seems to me, is abuse your advantage and lose it. Don't turret dive (but for the ace, and even then...), don't try for a 15 min kraken (though you can totally nail it).   Said another way: don't be stupid about being ahead, just gold starve them until it's hopeless."
vainglorygame,3bt56y,halcyon400,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's largely situational. Usually you want to go for whatever objective is closest to you, unless it's going to slow you down too much in claiming another more important objective. Judge where you and your teammates are vs. where any remaining enemies are vs. the relative health of everyone vs. how much time you have before the enemy team is full strength again. Sometimes it makes sense to split up if you think your team can claim two objectives at once that way.   I've been in many games where one team has an early lead via successful invades and whatnot but I think it can make that team cocky and force the other team to play more coordinated and cautiously, which can backfire on the invaders. That's always the danger of being too successful too fast: getting sloppy.   When in doubt, rule of thumb: Never be the first to die. :)"
vainglorygame,3bt56y,Orobobo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"halcyon400 made some really good points, to add to that- I've noticed that I get focused sometimes when I carry and the opponent realizes that I need to be focused so I counter build up defense. But the really important part is to just push. You have an advantage, use it to let it snowball."
vainglorygame,3bt56y,ChapterLiam,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:55:06 2015 UTC,"Walk with minions and take put enemy minions. If you're ready to close out the game, you need to have a buffer between you and the enemy turret. You can't really solo a turret unless you're a Protector (still not really) or have minions with you. Plus, Turrets fall way faster as a Laner so don't walk up to a turret as Cath lmao. Anyway, for example, Celeste needs minions with her to be effective. Have the protector in the lane with you. Jungler should either be getting a minion mine or sitting in the bushes for an ambush, leaving some scouts in other bushes if they have money/time to spare. A goos comp. for this setup would be Celeste/Cath/Taka"

The only thing we have in common is our penchant for getting weaklings out of the trouble they inevitably find themselves in. While you lumber around with your misshapen armor, grunting, sweating, flexing your sweat-glistening muscles ... I have lost my thought. Ah yes, while you lumber like a prehistoric Rangor, I lead confidently, turning the tide with skill, precision and poise.  We share one other thing is common, and that is regret over the death of the ""love of your life,"" Julia. Unlike me, however, you will never know the feeling of a rapid heartbeat fading away through the vibrations on your blade.  As it is, Celeste and I have more in common. She, unlike you, is graceful and powerful. True Stormguard material. She is lithe and elegant in her flowing green tunic, her sun-colored braids whipping through the air ... I've lost my thought again.   Alas, if this is neither a trick nor sincere, then I must presume that this is a joke. I highly doubt someone such as your would reduce yourself to such a simpering fool. So, I laugh.

vainglorygame,3bsciw,WJSlugger,3,Wed Jul 1 19:25:14 2015 UTC,"I usually start with Aftershock. Its build path is very good for Koshka's early-mid game, and coupled with her short cooldowns, it can deal a lot of damage.   I often follow that with a Clockwork to double-down on the aftershock damage.   Round it out with an Eve for sustain and she becomes quite powerful in late game. Maybe a Broken Myth instead if they build a lot of shield. Frostburn if they keep slipping away.  Working in a Reflex Block > Aegis helps her avoid being chain-stunned or otherwise focused by enemies, and T2 boots for chasing or escaping.   Don't initiate with her stun in teamfights, you'll only get yourself killed. Save it for catching fleeing enemies or interrupting ults. Max out the A and B skills instead."

I think it's fine, but it's too early to talk about balancing IMO. Ringo can also get 3 autos + a slow in a very short time. There are many counters to WP Vox.

I had a sorrowblade, Tornado trigger and Shiversteel as Taka, I X retsued him while he was stunned by out catch, so the he uses his ult to silence but I Use my A to avoid it. After they will use their A then attack and have their 4 stacks by now and regenerated most of the damage with his serpents mask, then I start attacking him with 5 stacks of my passive but he just simply restored half of the damaged I dealt to him and death a good 370-450 damage/shot."
vainglorygame,3brcx2,BlueDmon,2,Wed Jul 1 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, WP Vox is still the best hard carry IMO. But I think that Vox needs burst to compensate for his small range. I see two builds on WP Vox, SM+BS or SM+BP, sometimes both combined. But it creates an interesting element in the midgame, if you can create a burst build or a sustain build only with the atk speed item. You should be able to kill a stunned Vox with taka, if he kills you, it's his individual mechanical skill IMO."
vainglorygame,3brcx2,Goonie_GooGoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:15:47 2015 UTC,Maybe you would need to reflex block the silence then use taka's A to avoid vox's A thus negating the bonesaw stacks

Coat of Plates is the only T3 Defense item without an active. Atlas Pauldron is nice, but very situational.   Part of why fountain got so popular, was because it was one of the few items that could actually bring some utility to your team.   I suggest adding more defense across the board for a small plethora of scenarios. Also, Coat of Plates needs an active/passive. Probably something that buff ally's armor."

If you play a reasonable amount of games and spend some Glory on boxes, you should unlock a Skin fast enough.  I agree that Ice Boxes are waaaay overpriced. Glory Boxes are on a right place.

vainglorygame,3br1pf,daniellidio,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:38:11 2015 UTC,I don't know.  they are all rare or better. But point taken.
vainglorygame,3br1pf,GEOpdx,3,Wed Jul 1 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"We are aware that because the ICE box doesn't have Commons, people who spend money end up short on Commons. We're addressing this with a feature that let's you turn unwanted cards to craft the exact card that you want. Until then, we're looking at other solutions such as a cheap glory box that contains only Commons."
vainglorygame,3br1pf,SurpriseBirthdaySEMC,2,Wed Jul 1 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"You do know that there are only a certain amount of cards per box. They get refreshed every two days.  The ""tap to peek inside"" option even shows you what cards are in the box.  Also once you unlock all the cards it tells you this and refreshes the current cards back into the box.  Either you haven't paid attention to this or you didn't spend $100  Although if you did, maybe SEMC will give you a skin for your generosity :)"

vainglorygame,3bp8ed,VATigerfan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:00:30 2015 UTC,I think this is an ok idea but if you play in a party than you can set the rules on the chat screen and it's not really an issue. If they did incorporate this for public matches (which is the only real need for it) than that would further split the player base and the wait times would be longer as a result.
vainglorygame,3brdt0,JimBrownGOAT,11,Wed Jul 1 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"That's how it's intended. You can only use purchased heroes in Ranked mode.

vainglorygame,3bnkmj,Kraken_SEMC,2,Tue Jun 30 23:48:50 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I will update my post accordingly.
vainglorygame,3bnkmj,tehkyy,2,Tue Jun 30 23:54:12 2015 UTC,"I just played my first casual game since the patch (I've played several ranked games) and it was clear these guys didn't know what was happening. I friended a couple after the match just to check and the guys that accepted were not bad/decentish and I'm SA. Is the Elo mirror not working correctly on all accounts? Could be a bug, or just a fluke. Thought I'd alert you though."
vainglorygame,3bnkmj,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:42:16 2015 UTC,"The matchmaker will try to balance the Elo between the teams, so since you are SA, it might have needed to grab some lower tier players to balance the lower skill of the opponents.

vainglorygame,3bnkmj,keldegar,3,Wed Jul 1 19:07:31 2015 UTC,I'd appreciate some dev response but this does not seem to be the case.   You absolutely do not start at Not bad casual MMR. I think it's just that the matchmaker in casual is MUCH more relaxed in terms of Elo.   I played last night a bunch of games on my PoA and faced PoA's in casual queue.
vainglorygame,3bnkmj,DeafSmithVG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:55:24 2015 UTC,You can't search for matches in ranked if your party is too many ELO tiers apart.  This significantly impacts both casual and ranked play experiences
vainglorygame,3bnkmj,polygonarsenal,3,Tue Jun 30 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"There may be two sets of ELO, but I believe they may be linked somehow, because Chainsaw mentioned on the stream yesterday that switching to Casual after gaining a tier in Ranked will help 'acclimatize' to the new rank. Dev input here would be great."
vainglorygame,3bnkmj,Orobobo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree and I do remember him saying that. Also, I have played in a smurf account once (in not bad and decentish) and from experience, the players I was going against and on my team in my smurf were WAY less skilled than the people I went against in casual queue (the hotness tier)   There is no way it's at Not Bad for casual, I think it's tied to current rankings but more relaxed. I played a ranked match (in hotness) and while we won, it was a very close match. Compared to casual, I played 4 games and easily won all of them."
vainglorygame,3bnkmj,Deminish,2,Tue Jun 30 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"The point is that everyone starts at Not Bad in casual, that means all those PoA and Hotness people are Not Bad too, whereas in Not Bad in ranked on your smurf you are matched with a party of true Not Bads"
vainglorygame,3bnkmj,_DelGriffith_,2,Tue Jun 30 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"But what about the dev saying ""switching to casual after gaining a tier in ranked will help acclimatize you to the new rank""?

vainglorygame,3bnkmj,nickmkats,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:10:56 2015 UTC,I remember chainsaw saying in the dev stream that you could 'get used to your new tier' by playing in casual after you had risen (or fallen) in ranked queue. That gave me the impression that the ranked and casual tires were linked. Does anyone else remember him talking about this? Maybe I was just distracted by Finn and his big gun shows :)

The point is to play heroes you already know, that is why SEMC made it so the free rotation doesn't matter. Unfortunately, I guess the early access encourages people to purchase and then are able to use her right away in comp q. :/  I was really hoping that Comp q would make casual q less toxic, since it doesn't affect your elo, and trying off-meta is encouraged. Unfortuantely, I have had some of the most toxic players I have ever encountered in Casual q so far.   I am happy the down vote actually does something now, but I wonder what happens to your karma when you are downvoted for poor play."

I know it's not a one size fits all kinda thing. But I think it's a good descision.

Cutting that group out of ranked is going to leave more higher Elo players with more hours of game time under their belts in the ranked pool. I've been seeing a lot of AFKs in my matches in ranked. Not a ton of rage pinging though which is good. Ranked feels different though. This is in the PG/Hotness levels, not sure about higher/lower tiers though. I've only played one Casual queue game (doesn't quite give me the same buzz as the ranked queue does) and everyone played well and was well behaved. I'm hoping now that the thumbs up/down feature has more of a direct effect we'll see a lot of the troll folk get weeded out. It's really great to see the rank bar too love that addition."
vainglorygame,3bnt0q,WSBowman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:17:47 2015 UTC,I'm 2 wins off hotness bronze.

vainglorygame,3bnt0q,WSBowman,3,Tue Jun 30 22:53:01 2015 UTC,I haven't had much of a problem. I've been ranking up a lot faster. Went from hotness gold to SA silver in maybe 7 games.

vainglorygame,3bpuf0,Denni_,4,Wed Jul 1 04:37:42 2015 UTC,but giving someone who doesn't have a lot of Glory 2 days to earn enough to try and open a few packs seems fair. Not everybody has 10k+ glory just sitting around  theres arguments both ways really.
vainglorygame,3bpuf0,ifuckinglovekatara,2,Wed Jul 1 04:43:01 2015 UTC,I do like the idea of 1 day rotation. I've seen a couple people complain that they didn't realize the boxes reset with the same cards and dumped a ton of glory or in 1 case (that I've seen) a ton of ICE only to get a bunch of duplicates that hasn't gotten them any closer to the skin they want. If it was the difference of 1 day vs 3 I might agree there is something going on behind the scenes like glory building period or whatever but the difference between 1 and 2 is just the agonizing wait. I say they need to be either 1 day or more days (with more possible cards in them?) 2 feels like a strange in between to me.
vainglorygame,3bpuf0,tehkyy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree, either it rotates daily for fresh cards everyday, or longer rotation to like 4-7 days so people can save glory and play to get what they want in the rotations. Atm, it an awkward wait for a new rotation and not enough time to save up in two days if you wanted. Although, I would prefer daily rotations to keep things fresh and new everyday :)"
vainglorygame,3bp3o4,Kaast,6,Wed Jul 1 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"Dont rely too heavily on my examples, a lot of heroes were just adjusted yesterday so there may be more viable heroes than just the ones that I mention  1 laner, Top choices have been CP Celeste and CP/WP Vox and WP Ringo from what I have seen. Glaive can also play this role  1 jungle carry, popular choices have been WP Taka, Krul, CP Koshka (Possibly Rona, she just came out yesterday though so we really have no idea where she will end up) Glaive can also play this role  Joule can play both the above roles, CP Joule was overpowered before yesterday, but as of the new update she is more balanced, so WP seems to be the way to go.  the last role goes to a support. A character that builds tanky and team saving items such as Crucible, Warhorn, Atlas, etc… The best supports IMO are Catherine and Fortress,  though Ardan, Glaive, and Joule are all viable options as well. These guys just try to soak up damage and divert the attention from their damage dealing allies in team fights. The support always buys and Ironguard contract at first, and jungles along with the teams jungle carry.  Team fights decide games, and often times a teams jungles will come up to lane to try and force a quick 1-3 and kill the enemy teams laner, making it easier to push and take out that first turret."
vainglorygame,3bp3o4,ifuckinglovekatara,6,Wed Jul 1 00:50:01 2015 UTC,Everyone else covered it well. Just thought I'd add that Adagio is back in a big way. He's viable as a CP carry or a support.
vainglorygame,3bp3o4,WSBowman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Still 1 Lane, 1 Jungle, 1 Support.   Support = Fortress or Cath, must get Ironguard first.   Celeste, Joule, Vox, Ringo in lane, should start with Book of Eulogies. Not sure who the meta in the Jungle is these days.   People are starting typical junglers in the lane to good effect, such as  Glaive.   Not sure who the meta junglers are these days. I think Taka is the main guy.   We just got an update, so I'm pretty sure this meta is actually outdated. Maybe Petal, Scaarf in the lane. Rona in the jungle. Somebody correct me, please."

With the new Broken Myth, her late game can get very strong, as her ult does a ton of damage and is hard to mitigate. However, pretty much every potential jungler has a strong gap closer/way to get close to her, so... it's a risky pick. The support's gotta know what they're doing and they need to be able to peel HARD pre-BM purchase."

vainglorygame,3bpqv2,mcdeezel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that Joule didn't land directly on Rona. Her leap was changed in the most recent update to only cancel abilities for direct hits. And Catherine possibly suffered from the occasional stun big issue.  I haven't encountered any issues with her ult, but maybe someone else has seen the same issues as yourself."
vainglorygame,3boi6d,Andys29,7,Tue Jun 30 21:30:14 2015 UTC,She's super susceptible to stuns during her ult (like many heroes). I think she's a good candidate to hold onto the Cath stun with.

If you wanna read a little more in depth you can check that out.  Il just say that she has been a ton of fun. As Kraken pointed out, Cath is a bitch to play against, as well as celeste I might add, due to their stuns being able to ruin Rona during her red mist and making it so much harder for her to run away.   The other thing I have had trouble with is chasing. I am so easy to run away from.  Besides that, double serpents mask and breaking point has worked wonders, and iv won a vast majority of the games that I have played with her. She is a very strong jungler and even a decent laner."

vainglorygame,3bmeod,UniqueRaj,7,Tue Jun 30 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"Support Adagio main here. He's been significantly buffed. I've found the following works with reasonable success. More competitive players will assuredly have better builds lined up; pay attention to their recommendations over mine!   Rush Crucible  Scout Traps  T1 Boots  Atlas Pauldron  Fountain of Renewal  CP Infusions  Situational:    Need more sticking power: Shiversteel Lots of stuns: another Crucible Pure weapon power: another Atlas  Damage starved: Aftershock   The fountain rush I find isn't really necessary unless the enemy team is going full CP. His slow on the A ability and the buff for teammates with the B is super strong even without any CP. if I can afford it, I try to infuse before every fight after the 12 minute mark or so; you can devastate with your A+Ult. The infusions function well for both cool down acceleration and boosted CP power so you don't need to use item slots for a Clockwork or CP damage items. If you really need more power and are running out of energy, an Aftershock isn't a bad purchase later in the game, but only after you have built enough to effectively protect your teammates.   Play aggressively. Adagio's slow is very effective and when paired with a fast, high damage dealer like Taka  or Koshka, feel confident invading together consistently. I really like finishing a fast clear and rushing the enemy shop bush with an A ability burn followed with a B buff for my carry. It surprises the enemy and keeps them from fleeing effectively.   Be with your carry at all times. You're completely useless at damage dealing on your own and can get focused down relatively quickly.   Keep scout traps and potions on you in the early/Midgame. Having potions helps you keep your energy up so you can keep healing your carry and winning invades. Keeping mines in your inventory helps with vision after successful invades; you can see the enemy rotation and start being even more aggressive with invades while knowing when to steer clear (if the enemy laner comes down.)"
vainglorygame,3bmeod,WSBowman,3,Tue Jun 30 13:34:07 2015 UTC,Do you think with the changes it would be worth buying a shatterglass to give your teammates more heal/do more damage?
vainglorygame,3bmeod,Hoppscott,2,Tue Jun 30 16:53:42 2015 UTC,It would certainly be effective! The problem is that it's a little expensive for a support. I feel as though Aftershock and/or CP infusions give the best bang for buck.
vainglorygame,3bmeod,WSBowman,2,Tue Jun 30 18:01:31 2015 UTC,Agreed. Faced the same player twice yesterday who rushed Shatterglass after Fountain and Clockwork. His heals were decent but his team had no defensive items and were getting torn apart. Glad to see Adagio back in the mix though!
vainglorygame,3bmeod,RaifetheRenegade,3,Tue Jun 30 19:23:55 2015 UTC,I'm really glad to have him back too!   May have been the same one I had just now: he rushed a Clockwork and was building Shatter to go with his fountain but went down like a ton of bricks every time I got even near him. I went the standard WP Vox build and he just melted. I think Adagio desperately needs the defense; the slow is good enough until you can afford some CP much later.
vainglorygame,3bmeod,WSBowman,2,Tue Jun 30 20:11:34 2015 UTC,Oh definitely. The most skilled Adagios  I've played were able to wade right into the thick of battle and disrupt us because we couldn't just burst them down.
vainglorygame,3bmeod,RaifetheRenegade,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"I love doing that with him. Once you're tanky enough they either ignore you or do very little to you. Then it's one A ability, Ult, and quick reflex block to mopping up the team fight."
vainglorygame,3bmeod,WSBowman,2,Tue Jun 30 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"I'm really thankful for this!   I always thought I was getting stunned by cath out of my ultimate and rushing a crucible should help with that, one question. Should I build energy items early on? Sometimes I'm just to careless and lack energy at crucial times."
vainglorygame,3bmeod,WSBowman,2,Tue Jun 30 14:11:48 2015 UTC,"No worries! Hope it helps!   The Crucible is really helpful against multiple stun comps. Honestly I have not yet built Adagio with any kind of battery and/or cool down acceleration this patch. Early game, I rely on potions if low on energy and simply save my abilities for team fights throughout the match. Consumables are cheap and let me focus on keeping my teammates alive with defense items.   You certainly can get energy sustain items but I always seem to be struggling to afford what I need as is so I wouldn't recommend it unless you really are desperate for it."
vainglorygame,3bmeod,addinsolent,2,Tue Jun 30 14:15:44 2015 UTC,"I usually rely on pots for energy too, but I do really suggest an early battery. It helps in the mid-game team fights, when you're low on energy and your abilities cost more to use, a pot is at most going to give you the ability to use 1 ability, maybe 2, and that is no bueno for a support adagio.   Also I suggest trying a Breaking Point over an Aftershock some time. I usually go for one of the two.   Also not sure that double atlas is worth it, even situationally. I would take another fountain or crucible, personally.   My build goes: Contract, 2 pots. Don't select A or B ability until you get to mid-jungle and see what you are facing. Early invade? take A. No invade, time to farm? Take B to help with your clear time. First shop I take a oakheart and boots if I can or in the next shop. If I am facing a koshka or someone with strong CP early, I rush fountain. Someone with lots of stun or Joule, Crucible (was more of a 1.5 precaution with her ult). Around level 4, I'll buy a battery for energy sustain. If I notice I am getting wrecked by WP, I'll get light armor, forgo the battery and rely on pots until I complete my 1st T3 item.  Mid game my build will usually look like Fountain,  Boots, Crucible, Energy Battery, Coat of Plates. If I am trying to keep up with a taka in the jungle, I might have travel boots so I can stick by him and keep him healthy, which means I might only have light armor. I usually start building Breaking Point after I get my first 2 green T3 defensive items."
vainglorygame,3bmeod,Ognissim,5,Tue Jun 30 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, building after a certain build every time is wrong, especially as support, where the magic is all about counterbuilding the enemy + giving your team proper vision with Scout Traps and Flares.  For example, you won´t need an Atlas Pauldron if there is no WP carry in the enemy team. Just my 50 cents."
vainglorygame,3bmeod,addinsolent,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:14:29 2015 UTC,"Of course I always build my support builds based off the feel of how they perform in team fights and what my team needs at that moment vs. what my team will need in the future. I also take into account the make up of my team and their team when deciding what to build and what to prioritize. This is just a rough build scaffolding. I would liken it to building by a mental flowchart, rather than having a set build benchmark and goals.  I wouldn't build weapon defense (orange items) if the team is building all blue offense. Instead,  I would build a couple of fountains (not aegis), because you get the shield and it supports your teammates. The boots and battery are fairly essential because Adagio is slow as fuck, and if your jungle carry dies you most likely are gonna need to get the hell out of there (heal yourself to slow the other team to get away helps too). He is super energy hungry so a battery is almost a necessity in late game, but I have had many times where I went all match with no battery, and did just fine. However, mid-game where you have team fight after team fight (usually over an objective), a battery is going to help you immensely get from fight to fight in a way that a pot won't. Sometimes the match is snowballing for you and you can put money towards offensive items over defensive items earlier. Other times your team just barely scrapes by in a battle so you need to keep focusing on defensive items. None of this is lost on me."
vainglorygame,3bmeod,WSBowman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"Cannot believe I forgot the Contract. Definitely that first. Tried the fountain on him but have found the A ability heal is so much stronger it's less of a necessity early unless there's tons of enemy CP like you mentioned.   I think I'm using abilities less for jungle clear; I rarely have energy issues unless our teamfights are extended or we're chasing and I'm having to slow a fleeing enemy constantly. As a support, I really struggle to afford enough scouts in addition to all the defense if I do go with a battery let alone Tier 2 boots! How do you do it?"
vainglorygame,3bmeod,fmaBlots,2,Tue Jun 30 16:30:25 2015 UTC,I agree with this.   Why so late on fountain though?
vainglorygame,3bmeod,WSBowman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:15:28 2015 UTC,"I find that unless there's a lot of CP on the enemy side that I need to protect myself against, my a ability is good enough in terms of team protection until late game, when team fights decide everything and fountain heals can have a big resurgence impact."

vainglorygame,3bmeod,fmaBlots,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:34:41 2015 UTC,Your build sounds fine  Fountain -> Crucible -> Fountain/Clockwork  It's all about positioning.
vainglorygame,3bmeod,Okami_G,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"I find building a Frostburn to be very beneficial to your team in certain situations. If your team is generally in the lead, but can't secure kills because the enemy had good escape, Frostburn is key. Because your Arcane Fire triggers the Frostburn slow, you'll be able to slow enemies even if you aren't in auto-attack range, which puts it over the Shiversteel in that regard. The slow isn't as powerful, but if the enemy is just getting away and you have an ally on their tail, it makes the difference."

vainglorygame,3bossd,fusionash,10,Tue Jun 30 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"If you want to communicate, go find yourself some teammates and Skype with them or something.  You see how much toxicity there already is using 1 simple ping icon, just imagine a whole entire keyboard.  I understand its frustrating to have teammates do the wrong thing, I really do, but I do not think its worth it to implement a chat system to try to solve this. The payoff would not be worth it, and it would guarantee a fix for the problem."
vainglorygame,3bossd,ifuckinglovekatara,-3,Tue Jun 30 23:02:23 2015 UTC,Having the game almost force you to play with friends and leaving solo queue a 50/50 chance at a good or bad time WILL cripple the future of the game in regards to its potential playerbase. All I'm saying is it isnt good to antagonize newcomers to get friends or gtfo.  Also if you read what i said about a mute system with the chat just implement a button that says mute everything except pings which will basically be what we have now.
vainglorygame,3bossd,ifuckinglovekatara,3,Tue Jun 30 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"but it doesn't. I don't know if you have just been getting really unlucky, but getting good teammates in solo q is much for than just a 50-50 chance. If you are a good enough player, you will rise is ranks. Once you get to Decent-ish, theres no way in hell you will ever see a tank Celeste. Also, WP Koshka is viable. Not as good as CP Koshka, but WP is still usable.  I don't know, you have a few points in there, but I think I'd much rather just stay with without the chat system, thats just me."
vainglorygame,3bossd,Kraken_SEMC,5,Tue Jun 30 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the feedback. Just some quick thoughts: FWIW I have seen tanky builds on Celeste work amazingly well in specific situations, it's not my favorite, but that's fine. WP Koshka maybe not as much.   I have a lot of plans to try and improve communication in the game, and anything we consider has the limiting of toxicity as the first step in design viability.   One other thing to keep in mind that if the matchmaker is working successfully, you will only win 50% of the time. It's designed to have you play close matches, so it is intrinsically set to ride that razors edge."
vainglorygame,3bossd,Kraken_SEMC,-3,Wed Jul 1 01:58:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure how to say this to a dev but if you look at any decent team based game thats popular now, they all have a chat system. And even if it does increase toxicity, notice how there haven't been any posts in any game be it dota, lol, cs, etc. that vote to drop the text/voice chat system to lose flaming.  Removing the basis of communication in a game that relies on teamwork is kinda like saying ""i dont wanna deal with taxes so lets just not get a job"". You kinda need said job to make things work and just find a way to deal with the problems that come with it through other means.  Also like I said with a working text chat just implement a mute button to mute said chat but let pings through. This system works very well with dota already, and people who opt to mute would be playing as if the chat doesnt exist.  Also Im aware of the forced 50% winrate in matchmaking but it should be ""lose coz you got outplayed by better opponents"" and not ""lose coz your team is stupid""."
vainglorygame,3bossd,DashBlue22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"I totally hear your take on it, and thanks for the feedback. We'll always be working on better ways for teams to communicate, but will also balance that with our desire to keep toxicity down. In the meantime, since you clearly desire the more rich communication, I recommend utilizing a 3rd party app for voice chat with a party you join or create. This is what most of our awesome Twitch streamers are doing."
vainglorygame,3bossd,nyadav,2,Wed Jul 1 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"The absence of a chat system in-game is what makes this game great. I don't think it will cripple the playerbase at all to not have a chat. Also, this is kind of a big selling point for them, the fact that you don't have to deal with as much potential toxicity. Some people play the game just for fun, and don't want to be hassled by someone that wants to ""teach"" them how to play. I'm actually looking forward to a mute feature to pings for when you have that guy that spams at you (I believe SEMC said they would look into it in a post a couple months back). Just let them have their fun, if they want to get better they'll probably do the research on their own.  Just try to have fun with the game, and get some friends to play with if you want to be competitive.

Imagine if being on fire was indicated by a little campfire icon, instead of actual flames. I think Skaarf and Ringo players would be pretty disappointed.    Generally, I'm just in favor of a depiction of status effects rather than a symbol. It adds a lot to the fantasy-fulfillment aspect of the game. Of course, this is am fast-paced, competitive game, and information communication is crucial. I understand that the previous bleed effect was hard to read, sometimes. But the new icon doesn't look like the character is bleeding at all. It tells you that the character has bleed on him. But it doesn't show it. This interrupts the cool fantasy aspect of the game, which I think is equally as important as the practical, competitive aspect. A huge part of the draw for  Vainglory is the beautiful graphics, not to mention the cool character design supplemented with the intriguing lore. Not nearly as many people would play if it was a bunch of black and white stick figures.    I wish a different solution could have been found. And I'm not sure it was all that big a problem in the first place. After all, Fortress is just a few weeks old. I certainly got much better at recognizing bleed with experience and once I knew what to look for.  And the old graphic was just really pretty (albeit rather gory). The colors and imagery were quite aesthetically pleasing. The new icon is fine, but pretty lackluster. It's just a cartoonish symbol."

vainglorygame,3bkl5f,resto,5,Tue Jun 30 05:38:36 2015 UTC,I thought Taka was fairly balanced. Needed a few adjustments. But the feeling I got was that a LOT of people felt he needed the nerf.

Adagio and Petal became a bit stronger, but I don't see these changes to be as groundbreaking as Scaarf and Joule's were. Joule's nerf was also much more lenient than I expected. I mainly use weapon Joule, and her weapon builds weren't even nerfed at all (aside from the stun, but I feel like my stuns are usually very spot on or far off, to the point that I don't think the 5% actually makes a difference).   I'm mainly curious on how Vox's buff will work out. I usually have enough attack speed by level twelve that that nerf will barely affect me, but his early game buff might push him back to a really nice place in lane, and he was already a decent laner.  I do wish there were larger changes, just so that the game feels truly different after a patch, but the fact that nothing seems super overpowered at a glance suggests that the great folks with SEMC are improving at balancing, which is good seeing as the game is being officially released soon. :)"

But now, in 1.6, they have handled outliers nicely and brought everyone (Hopefully, we shall find out in a week or so if people start ranting with the word OP all over the place) to the middle.

Honestly, while I'm not the strongest player, I didn't feel much of a difference from 1.5, which is to say that I don't think he's top tier as a laner.  His lategame is still extremely strong as it was in 1.5, but while his wave clear is a little better in the early levels than it was in 1.5, his teamfighting presence is still very low at that point.

I feel like boosting his cp gives him an option to build crystal and also allows him to deal with Petal if she's super strong in lane and keeps poking him.
vainglorygame,3bm5fh,KingQuet90,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:27:41 2015 UTC,"WP Vox was definitely top tier, but I didn't see many CP Voxs at all. I agree with you that WP will continue to be very strong, but I was addressing CP specifically. I still don't think it's as good as WP, and will be more of a niche counter to specific things (like Petal for example as you say)."
vainglorygame,3bm5fh,thenamestsam,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok I thought you meant Vox in general wasn't a top tier laner. Yea we'll see how he performs, seems like they want him to be very strong with both builds."

vainglorygame,3bp0pk,VATigerfan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:29:24 2015 UTC,That's modern microtransactions for you. Just about every game with a hard currency does this to tempt people to spend more... and it usually works.

I would of purchased a couple had they not been $5 each. However just means I'll settle for a T1 or T2 skin instead.

vainglorygame,3bje60,Ciderhelmet,10,Mon Jun 29 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"First of all, she looks awesome fun to play!   Anything you can tell us about the inspiration for Rona? Did you have a specific goal when designing her? Filling up a spot in the meta, etc.? Did her design pose any particular challenges? How long have you been working on her?"
vainglorygame,3bje60,glStelar,7,Mon Jun 29 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Anything you can tell us about the inspiration for Rona?   In terms of character (not gameplay), I actually came into Rona a little later in the process, and credit really belongs to Chainsaw and Sugarvenom for Rona's inspiration. I know one of our biggest goals was to explore more of the ""old world"" in our setting.   Did you have a specific goal when designing her? Filling up a spot in the meta, etc.?   The focus is first on finding what feels ""signature"" for a hero, which abilities really mesh well and fit the fantasy we're aiming for. For what it's worth, Rona had a really sweet defensive ability that we cut b/c it didn't match the barbarian fantasy at all, but when this kind of thing happens it means we have another ability we know works and can hold onto for a future hero.  Designing around a meta is a very dangerous thing as it can cut a lot of good ideas out before they can be tested, so this isn't something we usually do. We do consider the boundaries on the game as a whole, though, such as how much mobility we're comfortable with, etc.   Did her design pose any particular challenges?   Yes. The barbarian and berserker are well-traveled territory in gaming and people have a ton of expectations when they see these heroes.  The Red Mist whirlwind was one of our more controversial because whirlwinds need to be extremely powerful to fit the fantasy, but also need to not break the game in terms of balance. We didn't want it to be a watered-down version, which is pretty typical in mobas, so we spent a lot of time getting it to feel powerful while still giving opponents agency in reacting to it.   How long have you been working on her?   Rona was about 3-4 weeks for gameplay design, although concepting and modeling had taken place prior to this."
vainglorygame,3bje60,puddul,6,Mon Jun 29 20:04:31 2015 UTC,What made you have a different energy source for her and Ardan ? Why don't use the same energy we use for other heroes?
vainglorygame,3bje60,glStelar,12,Mon Jun 29 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"The decision can be boiled down to a couple simple questions. First, do we want the hero to be able to use any of their abilities very frequently? Second, do we want to gate any abilities in a unique way that doesn't make sense to do through cooldowns?  Ardan and Rona don't use different systems because we hate energy, but because we want to gate abilities in a unique way for these heroes. Ardan's Blood for Blood is a reward for using his other abilities well, and Rona makes a decision between her Foesplitter burst and her Red Mist ultimate.   Getting into design-speak: Mana and energy systems are typically negative. They exist to prevent you from doing things.  When you buy weapon or crystal power, you deal more damage. When you buy cooldown you can cast abilities more frequently. But energy and energy regeneration don't allow you to make flashier plays, they simply lift a restriction on your hero and allow you to avoid the occasional unpleasant recall.  But from a gameplay perspective, energy serves a really important purpose. It allows us to gate ability usage and power while still allowing the player to choose which specific abilities they use. Instead of the old tabletop game approach where you have to camp before you can use a big ability, which is very binary, energy turns it into a currency.  Energy is good for many heroes, but it's not good for all heroes. Using alternate energy systems allows us to lean into different gameplay and pull themes together a little more cleanly."
vainglorygame,3bje60,Henberg12,2,Mon Jun 29 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"Fascinating to see the many very deliberate decisions that lead to a ""simple"" final product in game, all the thought required to produce elegance."
vainglorygame,3bje60,jatatcdc,3,Mon Jun 29 19:31:03 2015 UTC,"Answering a couple questions that came up earlier:  Red Mist deals base weapon damage, scales with weapon power, and can also deal crystal damage if you purchase crystal items.  There were three main motivators behind having Red Mist deal primarily weapon damage. First is thematic - the weapon is the heart of the barbarian fantasy, as well as a lot of surrounding fantasies (e.g. Riddle of Steel from Conan).  Second is because of its role. Red Mist is definitionally sustained damage, similar to basic attacks, and using it prevents you from basic attacking. When building to the weapon fantasy it felt awkward to be giving it all up to deal crystal damage.  Finally, giving it any significant base crystal damage made it harder for opponents to counterbuild, as your damage types would be heavily mixed even if you built all red.  Bloodrage has a lot of fine tuning that we haven't published anywhere else. These numbers may be off a little, apologies if so.  Max 100 rage. Begins decaying 7 seconds after leaving combat, loses 12 per second.   Incoming damage, about 1 rage per 3% of health lost. This is calculated before damage reduction, so you don't generate less if you happen to build defense. Energy from items, 1 rage for 100 energy (each second in combat) Energy regeneration from items, 0.35 rage per 1 energy regeneration (each second in combat) Rona's basic attacks, 9 rage, crits give a bit more but I don't have the number off hand Leap, 20 rage for heroes and large creatures, I believe 10 for jungle monsters and 5 for lane minions   Foesplitter and Red Mist numbers should show in-game."
vainglorygame,3bje60,ChapterLiam,3,Mon Jun 29 20:53:21 2015 UTC,How is your thought process when making heroes? What makes you focus on doing that idea and not the other? Do you make the hero out of life first or from what role you want next and fit lore later?
vainglorygame,3bje60,ChapterLiam,4,Mon Jun 29 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on the hero! Inspiration for a hero can come from either the artistic or story end of things, or from really good kit concepts."

I am planning on buying ICE for the first time and getting her as soon as she is available!  Anyway!    What are your favorite heroes to have on your team as a Rona? Where did the idea for bloodrage come from? she looks badass, I can't wait for more of her lore. Was Rona herself inspired from anything, or did she the idea just come out of nowhere? As someone who doesn't often play WP heroes (Celeste, Koshka and Cath) what do you recommend building on her first? In the hero spotlight you mentioned Serpents Mask was a good choice for her ult, but would you recommend building something like Tornado Trigger first to synergise with her other abilities better early game? Also, as her Into the Fray ability deals crystal damage, would building an Aftershock into a WP build be a bad idea? or would that gold be better used on something else. Who are your least favorite heroes to play against as Rona? (who counters her I guess) I can see Celestes Core Collapse being pretty annoying.   Thanks so much for your time, and for Rona as well! I apologize if any of my questions are amateurish, as Im really not an expert on the game quite yet!"
vainglorygame,3bje60,g1w,2,Mon Jun 29 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"What are your favorite heroes to have on your team as a Rona?   For me it's no contest, Ardan and/or Adagio. I've seen a lot of other awesome comps but having either of these on your team is wonderful.   Where did the idea for bloodrage come from?   The long or the short? Let's do the long.  We put together the bloodrage system initially as a way of gating Red Mist and making sure opponents knew when it could happen.  At that time, Foesplitter only had one activation, and it spent a good chunk of your rage rather than generating it. Practically speaking, this meant you really never used your Foesplitter any time you might want your Red Mist, so fights were boiled down to basic attacks.  When we tried Foesplitter as a rage generator it felt much better, but then we had a problem where, prior to level 6, Rona had no way to spend her rage. I believe it was Alex who then had the idea to try reactivating abilities to spend rage.  Foesplitter's reactivation is effectively the same as it was after that. Into the Fray also had a reactivation where Rona would rupture the ground by throwing her axes into it. This could be used anywhere, not just where she initially lept, so she had a couple seconds to reposition. But that ate up animation time on a hero that's already vulnerable to kiting, and it didn't feel right, or particularly tactical. So we tied that extra effect into the initial leap and it worked a lot better, b/c now you were making a decision whether to leap into enemies for damage reduction, or leap ahead of them to cut off their path, etc.  Anyway, bloodrage finally became a system where you balance your single target or multi-target damage depending on how you spend it.   she looks badass, I can't wait for more of her lore. Was Rona herself inspired from anything, or did she the idea just come out of nowhere?   For this question, the people you'd want to ask are Chainsaw and Sugarvenom!    As someone who doesn't often play WP heroes (Celeste, Koshka and Cath) what do you recommend building on her first? In the hero spotlight you mentioned Serpents Mask was a good choice for her ult, but would you recommend building something like Tornado Trigger first to synergise with her other abilities better early game?   It just depends on what you're trying to do! Attack speed and crit have zero effect on her Red Mist, but they're wonderful for Foesplitter, so getting a Tornado Trigger, etc., is something you should decide on based whether you want AOE or single-target damage.  Serpent Mask healing with the ultimate is real, so I'd just dive in on it as one of your first items regardless.   Who are your least favorite heroes to play against as Rona? (who counters her I guess) I can see Celestes Core Collapse being pretty annoying.   Catherine, hands down. A good Catherine can not only stun you out of your ultimate, but also silence you to prevent you from canceling your ultimate, which can leave you moving slowly at the worst times."

In the tests you guys have run, have any crystal builds for Rona emerged? What damage type (i.e. weapon or crystal) is the base damage of her Red Mist, minus the WP/CP ratios? I only ask because the description seems to indicate it's weapon damage, but my understanding is that all abilities do crystal damage and only add in weapon damage if there's a WP ratio present. How large is the window of time between the first activation of her B ability and the second activation? If greater than 1.5 seconds, could she get two procs out of Aftershock? How exactly does the damage reduction from Into the Fray work? Is it ""true mitigation"" that cannot be pierced or shredded? Does this mitigation take place before or after shield/armor gets factored in? Does Rona have the standard 1.4 second attack cooldown as other heroes or does it differ from the norm (e.g. Taka has 1.65 seconds)? What is the conversion ratio for energy and energy regen to in-combat bloodrage generation? Is the bloodrage generation for taking damage a flat amount per attack against Rona? Or does it scale based on how much damage she takes? What types of attacks against Rona trigger her bloodrage generation (e.g. attacks, abilities, scout traps, monsters, minions, etc.)? What is the actual time of the ""short delay"" between the impact on Into the Fray and the rupture?"

However, we (hopefully) erred on the side of caution given crystal Vox's release state, and I personally feel weapon is the stronger path right now, unless enemies won't bother to move out of the second burst on Into the Fray's rupture.   What damage type (i.e. weapon or crystal) is the base damage of her Red Mist, minus the WP/CP ratios? I only ask because the description seems to indicate it's weapon damage, but my understanding is that all abilities do crystal damage and only add in weapon damage if there's a WP ratio present.   Deals weapon base damage and scales well with item. Can also deal crystal damage if you pick up some crystal power. (If I can I'll take a moment somewhere here to explain why that's the case, but want to work through as many questions as possible atm)   How large is the window of time between the first activation of her B ability and the second activation? If greater than 1.5 seconds, could she get two procs out of Aftershock?   Yes, and I believe yes.   How exactly does the damage reduction from Into the Fray work? Is it ""true mitigation"" that cannot be pierced or shredded? Does this mitigation take place before or after shield/armor gets factored in?   Yes, it cannot be pierced or shredded. This was a difficult decision, but because we want new players to be able to play Rona at a basic level, I wanted to make sure that a player could feel awesome for a few moments if they successfully lept onto an enemy team and began whirlwinding. They may die but they'll at least felt like they did something, even if opponents have built piercing.  Unless I'm mistaken, the way damage reduction works, it actually doesn't matter where it's calculated in the process as the result of multiplication will come out the same.   Does Rona have the standard 1.4 second attack cooldown as other heroes or does it differ from the norm (e.g. Taka has 1.65 seconds)?   I'd want Surprisebirthday to chime in on this, as we had a bit of confusion surrounding terms in the office. If we're talking about how long it takes between attacks (rather than animation time), she's hard coded at a much faster base attack rate than any other hero.   What is the conversion ratio for energy and energy regen to in-combat bloodrage generation?   Low but not negligible. If I can get details on this prepared today I will (again depending on answering as many questions as possible).   Is the bloodrage generation for taking damage a flat amount per attack against Rona? Or does it scale based on how much damage she takes? What types of attacks against Rona trigger her bloodrage generation (e.g. attacks, abilities, scout traps, monsters, minions, etc.)?   It scales based on how much damage she takes without factoring in damage reduction. Same as above, will get details if possible!   What is the actual time of the ""short delay"" between the impact on Into the Fray and the rupture?   1 second. Travel time is ~0.5 seconds on leap, so a total of 1.5 seconds before the rupture. It's intended to be avoidable by quick players."
vainglorygame,3bje60,ifuckinglovekatara,2,Mon Jun 29 19:34:19 2015 UTC,I am also very curious about Crystal Rona
vainglorygame,3bje60,Ares-2,2,Mon Jun 29 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"Theorycrafting-wise, this is what I'm thinking:   Aftershock will be pretty awesome for damage output (if you get two procs off of B) Frostburn would be cool for sticking power and for keeping enemies within range of the rupture on Into the Fray and Red Mist. Alternating Current to create a steady stream of damage outpu, rage generation, and cooldown reduction on B. Plus, the attack speed from her perk will synergize with AC, creating more AC procs. Broken Myth - a generally powerful item on CP builds to increase damage output, particularly for all the Aftershock procs you'll be getting."

Can you explain the mechanics of red mist? How does the damage work? Is it possible to move in and out of range without taking dmg or to block dmg with a well timed kaiten?

Can you explain the mechanics of red mist? How does the damage work? Is it possible to move in and out of range without taking dmg or to block dmg with a well timed kaiten?

vainglorygame,3bje60,TechnologyFetish,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:38:22 2015 UTC,"When I first saw Rona, my initial reaction was ""Oh, it's female Glaive"". Obviously it's not a perfect comparison, but she's a WP Jungle character who seems pretty slow, she has a leap on one of her abilities, her ultimate involves spinning in a circle and dealing AOE damage. Obviously not having had my hands on her I can't say whether that initial impression was right (sounds like it wasn't based on you saying she plays more like Taka), but my question is more general:  How much do you worry about heroes being unique? You mentioned in another post that you guys don't really try to design to the meta, but how ""new"" does a hero need to feel to make the cut?"
vainglorygame,3bje60,MrTouchnGo,5,Mon Jun 29 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"How much do you worry about heroes being unique? You mentioned in another post that you guys don't really try to design to the meta, but how ""new"" does a hero need to feel to make the cut?   Heroes being unique? Absolutely necessary.  During Ardan's development, he was criticized for being too much like Koshka; after all, he was using basic attacks to get his Blood for Blood up much faster, just like Koshka does w/ her abilities.  During Vox's development, he was criticized for being too much like Skaarf; in his case, he was using his abilities to apply a debuff to enemies, then needed to attack them to keep crystal damage going.  These examples both probably seem strange, because in-game you'd never mistake these heroes for each other. I believe that's where Rona is going to fall in relation to Glaive. Yes, she's in the same general family of heroes, but her presence in a fight is a completely different beast.  I'll also say this: I place zero value on making every ability or kit mechanic unique between every hero. I'm ok with re-using something that worked well on a previous hero if it makes a new hero awesome. The core value for me is that the hero - taken as a whole - must be a completely unique experience."

After messing around with Rona in practice mode, I wanted to ask how did you decide to make the cooldown for Red Mist fairly short?  I know that it's tied to having enough rage, but it seemed that with one or two attack speed items it was possible to pop ult, use Foesplitter, use the second activation and still build up enough rage before Red Mist came off cooldown."

It's strange looking back at those videos, for a lot of reasons. :p   After messing around with Rona in practice mode, I wanted to ask how did you decide to make the cooldown for Red Mist fairly short?   Interestingly, from my perspective the Red Mist cooldown is fairly long. It was originally 6 seconds and was increased because I wanted to make sure enemies had at least some downtime that they could make plays in.  The goal for Red Mist is that you're essentially toggling your slow AOE mode from your quicker single-target mode. It's not meant to be particularly restrictive."

vainglorygame,3bmjfr,SonicServices,2,Tue Jun 30 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"Not for me atm. Maybe because some older played who haven't played in a while saw the update and decided to whip out Vainglory again. Although, longer times should be normal, theoretically, the player base has been split in HALF. Pretty significant, this is why SEMC waited so long to add in because they didn't want to make the small player pool smaller (In the first couple months after release). Hopefully, with android, the player base will grow, and Vainglory is on the App Store charts now, players numbers will grow increasingly. And also, new maps or modes will further divide the player base, so everything is possible, but this brilliant growing game needs time. :D"

vainglorygame,3bk6wi,ifuckinglovekatara,5,Mon Jun 29 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"I guess I'l start this off with my few rounds of experience!    Builds  so far I have found great success with WP, life steal with her ult is unfair, my typical build so far has been as follows.   Tier 2 boots Serpents Mask Serpents Mask Bone-saw  Defense (counter built) Consumable/extra WP   The build revolves around using Rona's Red Mist with the life steal. You are damn hard to kill while twirling those axes with 2 serpents masks backing you up, and you deal out loads of damage. I have had trouble chasing admittedly, but Iv found that Fortress's Truth of the Tooth helps immensely with that.  If you guys have any other builds please feel free to post the here as well.    Abilities  Basically the order in which you update the abilities.  I have been taking Foesplitter at level 1, then at level 2 taking Into the Fray, and maxing that one out first. I am thinking about possibly trying out an Aftershock instead of Bonesaw in my WP build to possibly increase the effectiveness of Into the Fray, as I haven't seen it really make too much of a difference late game. I really think that they should up the range on her slow area, but thats just me.  I have been taking the overdrive on Into the Fray and Red Mist.  The reason for taking the overdrive on Into the Fray is to reduce the cool down for chasing and escaping purposes. I often find that Foesplitter gets the job done even when its not completely maxed out, so Into the Fray is where I spend that point.  Seeing as my build revolves around Rona's ult, Maxing out Red Mist is a given. I really love this ability.    Other Random Stuffs  Alright, she looks fucking amazing, I just love the way her Into the Fray looks. She is a badass berzerker, thats really all there is to it.  I really like the idea of bloodrage, and I find it so much easier to measure than energy.  Her Heroic Perk is interesting, but I like it. Her damage over time is great, even though her burst isn't amazing.    Overall  She may be my favorite hero, she is just a bundle of fun. I have only played a few matches with her, but I can already see her being my main.   Thats really all I have, Im thinking about taking a lot of this information and then breaking down the more technical part of her game in a Hero Analysis, if anyone has any interest on that, please let me know.  Thanks for reading if anyone took the time!"
vainglorygame,3bk6wi,icecreamsandwich,2,Tue Jun 30 00:40:39 2015 UTC,"This hero feels completely useless half the time and stupidly overpowered the other half. I either jump in, hit a couple heroes, use foesplitter, and end up with enough rage for red mist or I jump in, don't hit anyone and don't have enough and die in seconds.  Lifesteal is a must. Maybe two or even three Serpent's Masks. Rona seems extremely teammate dependent. Your allies abilities are crucial for getting a good spin.  Fun hero. I'll keep trying to make it work, but I'm having a really hard time ever landing a good into the fray."
vainglorygame,3bk6wi,glStelar,2,Tue Jun 30 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting, as she has been extremely useful for me. I haven't lost a round since I bought her actually. I'm able to dominate the jungle, and if paired with a good Catherine or a good fortress, I'm unstoppable. Double serpents mask + red mist is amazing.  I do agree that into the fray is more of an escape method than a combat move, but it's really helpful nonetheless. I try to keep my blood rage as much as I possibly can, and then an into the fray plus foesplitter guarantees me a red most even if I don't have any blood rage. Her abilities are super useful for splitting apart enemies and forcing them to scatter, making it easier to win team fights and forcing enemies to retreat.  She's been great for me so far, but that's just my experience."
vainglorygame,3bk6wi,GEOpdx,2,Tue Jun 30 17:04:26 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree with you, but I think we just need to get a feel for her.  She is very fragile whenever she's not life stealing and/or protected by her dmg reduction from A.  After 2 games with her, it feels like you either need to be very agressive in a fight or very evasive. You often can't get kited for more than 2-3 seconds without dying. But if you get on them, they could be done in 1-2 seconds and you can heal back up to full.  More generally, I've seen and had many fights where Rona has ~10% health left, but she sticks to her target(s) and survives while demolishing everything around her because of her lifesteal (and A).  It's just a lot of quick decision making and intuition I think.  She seems designed as quite ""volatile"" though! She's probably gonna be hard to balance, particularly for high ELO."

vainglorygame,3bl4du,SurpriseBirthdaySEMC,2,Tue Jun 30 03:04:32 2015 UTC,"Am I correct in understanding that the calculated CS is literally the number of gold the hero earned from killing minions, divided by 40? And if that's the case, why don't you just display the amount of gold earned rather than the creep score?"
vainglorygame,3bl4du,teddim,3,Tue Jun 30 11:33:18 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly gold from creeps/40. Gold varies as creeps are on the map longer (they level up). Gold count also includes the gold gained from killing enemy heroes, turrets, and gold from gold mine. CS still tells you how well you're farming. Gold tells you more how well you're doing overall."
vainglorygame,3bl4du,MrTouchnGo,2,Tue Jun 30 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly gold from creeps/40. Gold varies as creeps are on the map longer (they level up).   In practice mode, I didn't farm the double minions at the back of the jungle for about 10 minutes, and when I finally farmed them they were both worth 187 gold. The first one added 5 to my CS, the second one 4. This lead me to believe that the displayed CS is simply total gold earned from creeps divided by 40.  The other factors that decide the total gold earned are kills/turrets/miners, which are all known to each player in the game (except maybe the exact gold bounty for a kill). So, knowing someone's CS (if it's indeed gold from creeps/40) is almost equivalent to knowing someone's total gold earned."
vainglorygame,3bl4du,teddim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:02:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know that. In any case, gold bounties can't be predicted or really kept track of because of how much they vary of the duration of a game. You can kill me 5 times early game and only get 400 gold total for it, but I can kill you once at fifteen minutes and get 500 gold for it because you were on a killstreak and max level.   Also, a low CS is easier to remedy than bad overall performance. It's generally easier to farm more/better than it is to stop giving up objectives and teamfight better. I think a CS that's separate from total gold is valuable because it tells you what you need to be doing better. You may not realize you're farming badly without a CS, but it's fairly easy to tell that you're dying a lot or losing objectives. That's my take on it, at least."
vainglorygame,3bl4du,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:32:22 2015 UTC,"Also, a low CS is easier to remedy than bad overall performance. It's generally easier to farm more/better than it is to stop giving up objectives and teamfight better.   True, but objective control (such as taking turrets) leads to jungle control, leads to more easily stealing minions. Meaning that comparing your CS to the corresponding enemy (if you're a jungle carry, for instance) still won't tell you how well you're doing regardless of objectives."
vainglorygame,3bl4du,teddim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:12:08 2015 UTC,"You're thinking in terms of high Elo play though. In high Elo, you should know the standing of each team without ever looking at CS or total gold.

vainglorygame,3bl4du,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"That's correct, IMO it's better this way because it might be confusing if builds are worth more than the gold amount displayed on the scoreboard."

vainglorygame,3bik83,maloik,9,Mon Jun 29 15:08:46 2015 UTC,It's the full update. This is just an early preview to help squash bugs.

vainglorygame,3bik83,IdkwtS,3,Mon Jun 29 15:32:03 2015 UTC,Sounds like you have it! 1.6 will be fully unleashed today and if you discover bugs let us know so we can stomp them out!

vainglorygame,3bkol1,Ares-2,2,Tue Jun 30 01:36:39 2015 UTC,This isn't correct.   Your casual mmr is based off your ranked mmr. I played casual queue with PoAs and we fought against PoAs.

SA with ask again later, etc. The thread about casual and ranked mmr and Zekents answer.   This isn't quite how it works. You can think of the Casual and Ranked queues as two separate matchmakers which are each affected by their own MMR- If you win a lot in Casual Queue, your Casual MMR will increase, NOT your Ranked MMR. The other way around works the same way."

(EDIT: per other commenters, this is a known 1.5 bug rather than having anything to do with server downtime)  By ""server downtime to begin at about 12pm PDT"", it appears they actually meant ""10am PDT"".   Finished a game at about 10am and was immediately sent to a blank hero selection screen to start a match, despite the fact I hadn't queued up again, nor even seen the post-match glory screen. There is nothing on the screen but the boxes (the hero art doesn't load) and the Select button does not respond. The app seems stuck there. Restarting, rebooting, waiting for several minutes doesn't fix it; the main menu may flash briefly, but then it immediately comes back to that blank hero selection screen.  I presume it's being used as a way to lock players out from starting new matches prior to the server downtime, but a message or something to that effect would have been nice, rather than a blank hero selection that makes me think the game is bugged.   iOS 8, VG 1.5, iPhone 6, server: NA  EDIT: Seems to have fixed itself after about 2 hours."

vainglorygame,3bodd2,tehkyy,6,Tue Jun 30 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"I concur! I've had multiple games being down to our last two turrets with the enemy team having all theirs at full strength, and we still comeback to win. Sometimes it's luck. Sometimes it's a critical mistake by the other team. Either way, you still have a chance.  Edit 1: Changed a few words.  Edit 2: I'd also like to mention that this is more likely to happen when the game reaches the later stages of the match and respawn times are much longer."
vainglorygame,3bodd2,dr3wd3zi,3,Tue Jun 30 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I have had many more comeback wins than snowball wins and now to never surrender. Just one mistake by the enemy team (such as overextending while pushing Kraken) and you could get an ace and push all the way to their crystal. After feeling completely helpless for the first fifteen minutes make that win after catching the enemy team off guard is unbelievably gratifying.  Win or lose there is still the chance to learn something from the enemy. What weaknesses are they exploiting? Where is your team lacking? By playing out the match while losing you have the opportunity to learn something you never could from a win.  One last note, heroes like Vox or Krul don't really begin to shine until late game. Krul finishing his BP and Shield or Vox finishing his AC/Eve/Broken Myth completely turn the game around - if given the chance."

vainglorygame,3bms5c,MrTouchnGo,10,Tue Jun 30 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"This is intentional, Wolves have always followed Taka, and Petal's minions are new with the 1.6 update.  The times that heroes can see you may also be because of petal, I believe her seeds grant vision that can impair Taka"
vainglorygame,3bms5c,ifuckinglovekatara,6,Tue Jun 30 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"As said in the stream by /u/zekent, the munions are now aggro. They are smarter vicious little buggers that bite your ankles if you are nearby, without Petal targeting you."
vainglorygame,3bms5c,peterkeats,-4,Tue Jun 30 15:22:58 2015 UTC,They attack me inside my box. That's not fair and should be removed. It's part of his kite. It's what makes taka. Taka. How is destroying his only escape fair
vainglorygame,3bms5c,KarmaAdjuster,8,Tue Jun 30 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"Do you really think any character should have a frequently useable ability that has zero counters? Using Taka's box well should still require some skill. Invisibility is a HUGE ability to give a character and requires that it be counterable in some way. Fortunately for the rest of us, the developers realize this. I'm afraid you're going to be waiting a long time for your requested feature (and by long time, I mean forever).  Take a look at it from the other side. How would you expect players to be able to counter a champ that can turn invisible AND invincible every 25 to 21 seconds? At max level, assuming you have the energy for it, you would be able to be invincible for over 20% of the time."
vainglorygame,3bms5c,dudethisis,2,Tue Jun 30 15:40:54 2015 UTC,He's not invincible by any means. Any AoE attack still damages him and reveals him. Also it is easily countered by flares/mines. Furthermore a Taka usually uses the Box to escape and is close to near death so it's not like he's automatically at full health when he uses it.   That said I understand the wolves follow in but the munions are a bit too much. Most of petal's Damage comes from those munions. With Munions being able to attack Taka when he's inside the box and invisible makes it impossible for Taka to escape. And it requires absolutely no skill to get Taka out of the box. All Petal has to do is just sit there and her Munions will do the job
vainglorygame,3bms5c,NespreSilver,2,Tue Jun 30 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think this is just an attempt to make Petal relevant again. Now her ult actually works on Taka, which must have been frustrating in the past.   But it still requires people to select Petal to begin with ...."

vainglorygame,3bms5c,NespreSilver,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"The boom part IS AoE, but typically the minions pick a target and charge it before exploding. If Taka was Boxed when Petal was sending out minions, he could theoretically avoid being attacked by them. Not anymore."
vainglorygame,3bms5c,LordScolipede,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:45:13 2015 UTC,"Aw. That sucks. I dont play Taka, but it does kinda suck for them. Imo, if Taka vanishes, the Munions or whatever should just keep going in his general direction he was going in before he vanishes so if makes a full U-turn, the pets don't follow."
vainglorygame,3bms5c,KarmaAdjuster,2,Thu Jul 2 05:52:01 2015 UTC,"After playing some games In the current build, I think I see what you mean. Playing as Ardan, I was able to select the enemy Taka, and then after he had gone into his box, I was still able to use my punch ability on him even though I couldn't see him. I actually managed to kill a couple of Takas this way.  Taka's box has definitely been nerfed for escapes with this latest patch. For people intending on playing Taka this patch, I recommend that use only use his box for setting up attacks."
vainglorygame,3bms5c,zquid,7,Wed Jul 1 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"Wolves have always done this, petals minions is new though. Consequence of the new ai chasing people into bushes I guess?"

vainglorygame,3bms5c,PrudeJesus,3,Tue Jun 30 15:23:50 2015 UTC,Turrets and npc critters have always been able to follow Taka while he's invisible. The minions were updated to fit in with everyone else.

If somebody is pinging a ton, being really bossy, multiple question marks after every death, that's super annoying, but I don't consider it toxic behavior.   When somebody gets so mad they start pinging question marks constantly for the entire game except when the take a break to smiley face and thumbs up after you die while not even trying to win the game, that's toxic. Just my 2 cents."

Remember when you first made your account, you played a game or 2 before you were put into a rank, then you leveled up or down from there. Casual queue starts up like that as well (as far as I know) and for lack of better phrasing, you simply have an ELO rating separate from your tier in ranked mode. The only difference is that, your casual queue ELO is hidden, so you don't have to stress out about losing or gaining ranks. It's like this to put players in fairer matches, and also to let them play stress free.  Your Ranked mode tier has no influence on your casual mode opponents (as far as I understand, I could be wrong here, if any dev wants to correct me feel free to) and that's why you might see a few higher ranked opponents at first, but it will even out soon enough.  I hope this helped at all, if you need any clarifications, let me know"

Edit: From what I understand, the casual queue works just like the old queue did but without gaining or losing elo. So if the PoA player was in queue for 2:57, it will match him against the next available team regardless of rank (although I think it still tries to choose the closest rank). The 2:57 queue is not a thing in the ranked queue, but you might run into longer queue times. That's the sacrifice you make to get paired up with equal tiered opponents. :)"

I'm on incredibly slow internet right now, so I can't dig it up for you, but it's in the patch notes. It mentions something about matching you against harder opponents if you tryhard all the time. Your ranked MMR is your tryhard tier, so it would make no sense to throw you into casual at the same tier immediately.

vainglorygame,3bitrw,Kraken_SEMC,2,Mon Jun 29 17:30:25 2015 UTC,I have a question that deals with movement. I feel like movement should be continuous as you continue to have you finger pressing on the screen. For instance in LoL when you have your mouse clicked down and as you drag it across the screen your character follows. And what it lets you do is sort of spin around in a circle on a point. I feel like this would allow for better movement and more advanced plays. Is this something you are planning to add?  I just played for the first time over the weekend and it was pretty awesome. I had to play on my friends iPad so I can't wait until it comes out on Android. Keep up the great work!
vainglorygame,3bitrw,logan5_,2,Mon Jun 29 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"It's a cool idea, and we go back and forth about it.

This is contrary to how everything else on your OS works: When your finger touches ""down"", it highlights the thing, then when you release ""up"", it commits the action.  Everything in Vainglory is on-down, which is way faster. But we pay a price for this choice...if we register your action on-down, then the moment you begin ""dragging"", you'll also issue a move-to command to that location, which interferes with gameplay. This is why panning is enabled only when you are dead!  This is also why we don't really do multi-touch (besides it being really gimmicky): There is no way humans can place two fingers down at exactly the same moment, so most two-finger tap will end up triggering a single-finger move-to before the two-finger command can be recognized."
vainglorygame,3bitrw,eh-blank-space,5,Mon Jun 29 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"Here's my thoughts on this.   In short I love the idea but I don't want it to happen. Here's why.  VG is growing because of 2 reasons.  1. It's a quick game that doesn't eat your whole evening.  2. It's easy to learn and because it's on mobile. A lot of things are taken care of you.  The issue I have with giving an option to unlocking your screen to advanced users is that because vision is such a huge edge that if the casual users don't learn it. They are at a major disadvantage. That then leads to the meta of unlocking your screen and if it's overly complicated then the casual user won't want to do it. So the community won't grow.   VG is awesome because it's beautiful, quick, and easy to play on mobile. If you remove the easy you might lose casual players."

vainglorygame,3bgymc,Koozaza,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"She feels like she will need to deal a lot of damage with her autos to maintain usefulness and with only a small AOE slow, I would find it hard to run strong comps with. I guess with a good arden, she has a lot more damage potential in a teamfight but she could be lackluster if she can get kited with Shiversteel.  Her ult seems really strong and hopefully, does the damage to have huge impacts in teamfights that we don't really get to see, either that or she can tank hard enough to where the shred creates a great window for clean up."
vainglorygame,3bgymc,tehkyy,2,Mon Jun 29 04:48:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely going to take time for her to be used efficiently in solo queue.  I agree that the team comp will make or break Rona.  If she's the jungle carry then you really need the Support/Roam to have a stun/speed up.  Into the Fray isn't that bad since it can be used offensively or defensively with the slow zone.  It's her ult that kind of has me iffy on Rona.  Her ult is very reminiscent of Gnar from League of Legends and how his ult can only be activated when he hits 100 rage and transforms.  People took a while to be able to learn how to play around the rage bar/transformation, so you could get that nice stun from Gnar's ult.  It won't be too bad for people that team up and play with voice comms, but it's gonna be hard in solo queue to communicate that.  It kind of sucks that Rona isn't going to be able to sit in a bush with the other jungler to try set up a gank.  She basically has to come running in from the jungle and hope her teammates can land stuns or slows.  Even if she wants to use it in the middle of a team fight it will probably be hit or miss depending on the level of your opponents.  Opponents with good awareness will always be keeping an eye on Rona's rage and most likely disengage a fight once they see it getting close to full.  On the other hand, she'll probably wreck face in low tiers once those players that like her switch to her as their main."
vainglorygame,3bgymc,Orianntal,2,Mon Jun 29 05:33:29 2015 UTC,"I think an obvious support for her is Fortress, he has the speed and slows she needs and she has the attack speed to proc his bleed on Law of the Claw. And a smart pick for laner would be Celeste for the stuns and strong laner status. But honestly I think any of the supports we have now will fill different roles for her and the same goes for lane, especially in this CC heavy meta. Play her like a taka, and you'll be fine.   I do think she might make an interesting support though… Just spit balling here but she can jump and slow folks, put a shiversteel on her and whirlwind since it deals wep dmg it should slow them and slow at wep rates… Maybe either a bone saw for shred or a serpents mask for sustain and then fountain x2? Might not be smart, but stranger things have worked better.  Edit: Mixed up my Fortress abilities."
vainglorygame,3bgymc,tehkyy,2,Mon Jun 29 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Cele Fortress was the best comp I came up with and shiver steel tank was a build I was looking foreward to playing. Interesting stuff! I just hope Rona can survive the soloq experience when you don't have the cc to put in any damage, even if you build like taka."
vainglorygame,3bgymc,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"Further thought on potentially off meta builds and comps if she tanks an excellent junlge partner might be Ringo. Speed, att speed, kiting potential and range. If the two of them are romping around in the jungle and you get caught unawares you could be achiles shot, foe split and then when you think you've gotten away she can into the fray your ass… And if she's got a bonesaw that makes Ringo that much more deadly. Paired with a Joule lane, Into The Fray plus Rocket Leap and BRB… GG."

vainglorygame,3bgymc,Ciderhelmet,0,Mon Jun 29 17:40:20 2015 UTC,/u/SurpriseBirthdaySEMC - Red Mist says it deals continual weapon damage to nearby enemies. Is this the first ability in VG whose base damage is not crystal?
vainglorygame,3bgymc,Kraken_SEMC,2,Mon Jun 29 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define it, but yes! I'm starting up an AMA momentarily for any other questions along these lines. :)"
vainglorygame,3bgymc,jklick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:19:40 2015 UTC,There are a number of abilities that scale more towards WP or CP. It's case by case.
vainglorygame,3bgymc,tehkyy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken, the base damage of every ability is crystal damage and then weapon damage may get introduced if there's a WP ratio. The description of Red Mist leads me to believe the base damage is weapon and then there's a WP and CP ratio on top of that. If this is true, it would be a Vainglory first."
vainglorygame,3bgymc,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"I believe that Joule's Thunder Strike works the same way, I know that it increases with WP and it's cooldown is affected by attack speed items."
vainglorygame,3bgymc,tehkyy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"That's not what he's saying though. The base damage on Red Mist, meaning with no other items, is Weapon Damage, so it will be reduced by Armor and not by Shield, and, additionally, will lifesteal with Serpent's Mask and Barbed Needle. The base damage on Thunder Strike is Cyrstal. Both abilities have Weapon and Crystal ratios which add additional weapon and crystal damage, respectively."

vainglorygame,3bgjpw,Silency,2,Mon Jun 29 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, if i'm right damage from reflection is capped with more tick = more damage"
vainglorygame,3bgjpw,Twiggled,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that before. As far as I can see, this just doubled the damage of Joule's laser against Cath's bubble"
vainglorygame,3bgjpw,Silency,2,Mon Jun 29 03:09:18 2015 UTC,No they just doubled the number of cath reflection :D she will be better than before against joule
vainglorygame,3bgjpw,VGChicken,8,Mon Jun 29 03:48:47 2015 UTC,"At level 12 Cath's shield reflects all damage over ~150.  Let's say Joule's ultimate nets 1200 damage.  With 3 ticks, each tick does 400, of which Cath will reflect 250 (400-150), for a total of 750 (250 * 3) damage back; Cath will take 450 (150 * 3) damage. But with 6 ticks, each tick does only 200, of which Cath will reflect 50 (200-150), for a total of 300 (50 * 6) damage back; Cath will take 900 (150 * 6) damage.  Doubling the number of reflections is bad because that means more damage is coming in under what the shield protects.  It's the reason Skaarf's ultimate hurts Cath more than Joule's, even though the base damage is lower--Dragon's Breath deals damage through a large amount of small packets."
vainglorygame,3bgjpw,Silency,2,Mon Jun 29 06:26:12 2015 UTC,K thanks youre right :)
vainglorygame,3bgjpw,Twiggled,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:50:25 2015 UTC,Yup this was basically my understanding. 6 ticks just means Cath takes 450 more damage and reflects 450 less damage

vainglorygame,3bgjpw,VGChicken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:13:59 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great fix, but I'm curious to know what the design philosophy is behind Joule.  Or rather, CP Joule plays a lot like Skaarf did before 1.4, only stronger--she has better survivability/mobility, better CC, and an ult that is both hard to dodge and deployed quickly.  After the nerf, she will still retain all of these features.  Yet Skaarf's play style was dramatically altered in 1.4 (and effectively neutered in 1.5) because you didn't want players to become too reliant on only landing their ultimate, even when that ultimate was harder to deploy effectively.  So what changed?  And/or will Skaarf be returning to form in 1.6?"
vainglorygame,3bgjpw,ketzusaka,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:07:40 2015 UTC,I'm kind of surprised by this. In 1.4 there was a trend of moving power from ults to other abilities. Why didn't that happen with Joule?
vainglorygame,3bgjpw,puddul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"That's still on the table depending on how CP Joule plays in 1.6. I do think her A + B and more useful than 1.3 Skaarf, who was much more of a one-trick pony than even 1.5 CP Joule."

vainglorygame,3bijue,Lebrontasaurus,10,Mon Jun 29 14:48:50 2015 UTC,Turrets deal damage that is mitigated by both Shield and Armor. This is to prevent turrets from influencing the way you build defense. The damage turrets do also increases with the number of consecutive hits they have on you.
vainglorygame,3bijue,MrTouchnGo,3,Mon Jun 29 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"This is correct. It's not true damage, go into a private and stack metal jackets and you'll see. Additionally, while it does increase per shot, it has a max number of increases that it caps at before dealing continuously the same amount of damage."
vainglorygame,3bijue,Jajajack14,2,Mon Jun 29 17:47:15 2015 UTC,You're correct. In 1.6 scout traps will deal that kind of damage as well.

vainglorygame,3bijue,ifuckinglovekatara,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:19:04 2015 UTC,"Either Crystal or Weapon, I'm not sure."
vainglorygame,3bijue,jatatcdc,3,Mon Jun 29 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"Turret damage is complicated...in order to make it uncomplicated. Bear with me:   Turrets deal ""compound damage"", which means they take the average of your armor and shield Turrets then pierce 25% of your armor and shield Turrets base damage scales with your level Turrets also deal some amount of % health damage   Overall, this whole thing is complicated so that you don't have to decide between building armor/shield/health to tank turrets. They are all roughly equally good."

vainglorygame,3bj9rh,as1mo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:03:22 2015 UTC,You may have just answered a question for me.  I have always wondered if your tier can go down after a win. I didn't think that was possible. I assumed that it could only go down after a loss. In five games or the first loss where your Elo score falls below the threshold. It is mathematically possible if you loose to a very low tier team and win against low tier teams.   Kind of improbable though.
vainglorygame,3bj9rh,GEOpdx,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:23:55 2015 UTC,"Kind of? I think it's very improbable. You'd have to lose to a very low ELO team, then win against 5 other very low ELO teams."

I only use Helio to poke the enemy and try to stop him from last hitting. every time they come in for a last hit they eat a helio. All i can say is try to freeze lane on your side always have mines in your and enemy lane bush to keep an eye on ganks or atleast helio it often to check. and farm farm farm. if you have a Catherine on your team wait for her stun to do your stun. Good builds on Celeste are Shatterglass Broken Myth tier 2 boots Eve of Harvest or Clockwork and a defensive item. i usually rush Heavy prism t1-boots reflex block and than get shatterglass and Broken myth

vainglorygame,3bj1bq,ifuckinglovekatara,3,Mon Jun 29 23:11:15 2015 UTC,In order to LH good with autos you have to be really close to the minion cluster which can be a problem. I'd say spam Helio is the way to go.
vainglorygame,3bj1bq,LordScolipede,2,Mon Jun 29 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"Try learning to throw an auto attack and then time a Heliogenesis to land on your target at the same time the auto attack will, this will help you miss fewer until you know how to properly time it with only autos."

vainglorygame,3bfuir,zmancArl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:15:58 2015 UTC,"I had debated adding a TL;DR of the sort. I think I will, if you don't mind, but...  It's kind of misleading because it could be up to ~75$ if you only want few specific skins and are unlucky. And even on average it will be less than 40 because you have to play some games to get commons/glory and thus you'll get some rares/epics.. But that 40 number does make for an easy to digest conclusion ."

vainglorygame,3bguqf,WeedTooLoud,4,Mon Jun 29 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"This was my first MOBA so I can't help you here. ShinKaigan and FooJee are personally two of my favorites. They both play very well, and Shin's stream is pretty educational. They'll often answer questions you post in chat. Shin also has a series of solo queue videos (among other videos on YouTube) which may be helpful for new players. There have been several tournaments, including ESL and multiple VGLs. Top guilds include Unknown (EU), R3D (EU), Nemesis (NA), and GankStars (NA). Obviously there's a lot of other amazing talent in Vainglory too :)"

They are compact, intense, and thrilling games. Unlike most other MOBAs, the character selection is limited, there is only one map, it is only 3v3, and there is one lane. Roles include Lane, Jungle, and Support/Roam. Good Laners are Ringo, Vox, and Celeste. Ringo is always in Free Hero Rotation. Good Junglers are Taka, Koshka, and Krul. Good Supports are Catherine, Fortress, and Glaive. The top of the meta, as of 1.5, is Joule. Behind her are Krul, Taka, Vox, and Celeste. Towards the bottom of this meta are S.A.W., Skaarf, and Ardan. Mess around with all of the heroes! I main Taka, a Jungler, but experimented with Celeste, a Laner, this week in Free Rotation. I love her now! I'm sure you know to try everyone, coming from LoL, but with a limited cast, it's important to try different builds and different roles for plenty of the characters.

One thing that I have noticed on my iPad Air 2 is that the device playing Vainglory will use battery faster than the apple charger can charge it!  After playing for several hours while plugged in I checked my battery and noticed that it had actually drained.  I've since switched to a charger with a higher amperage to alleviate this issue.

vainglorygame,3beq6k,Ru1Sous4,13,Sun Jun 28 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"We will definitely dedicate a video and or more UI explaining how this system works. The boxes rotate so that at any given time, you are not drawing from the entire universe of cards, which makes it nearly impossible to get the cards you want. Instead, the boxes contain a focused set of cards, which you are free to peek and see exactly what is inside before you buy. Also, we will add features for you to make use of duplicates, so they don't become $$ down the drain.  You are absolutely right that instead of having a pay-to-win system, we instead have a ""luxury skins"" system in place as our business model. That was the design intent from the beginning. This is a bit scary for me TBH, because pretty much 99% of other mobile/tablet games are startups or small companies like us, but rely P2W as their main business model. Meanwhile PC MOBAs are not P2W, but are all backed up by massively successful game companies (Riot, Blizz, Valve). That means we're the only ones in the ""small company"" camp trying to build a serious business around non-P2W, and this skins system is the way we're attempting to achieve it."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,SurpriseBirthdaySEMC,4,Mon Jun 29 00:48:55 2015 UTC,This sort of business model transparency is really useful to me as a fan of the game who also has an invested interest in your success. Thank you for sharing.

vainglorygame,3beq6k,diathesis,3,Mon Jun 29 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"For a Tier 1 skin you need 16 common cards and 16 rare cards. For Tier 2 you need 16 common, 16 rare and 8 epic cards. My account is lvl 17 and I've 71 common, 23 rare, 4 Epic cards, just to give an idea of the drop rates. the rates in a glory box: 80% common, 12,5% rare, 5% epic and 2,5% Legendary (pretty close to the ingame rates) ICE box: 72,5% rare, 20% epic and 7,5% legendary Tier 3 Skins will be still hard to get you can get Tier 2 reasonably fast it's better to spend more Glory/ICE on one box, than spreading it among different boxes."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,Ares-2,2,Sun Jun 28 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"Seems like the ""bottleneck"" for tier 2 skins is really gonna be epic cards:   T2 skin requires 16 commons, 16 rares and 8 epics (rare:epic ratio is 2) commons are very easy to get from game drops (and glory boxes) the ratio of rare:epic drops from games is about 3  ratio of rare:epic cards from glory boxes is 2.5 (the closest to 2), but glory boxes are a lot less efficient than ice boxes for getting epics ratio of rare:epic cards from ice boxes is about 3   In your case, in order to get 4 more epic cards (you would then have 8, the bare minimum for a T2), you would need to open about 16 glory boxes or 5 ice boxes.  (by ""open a box"" i mean buy a set of 4 cards from it)  I guess for T3 skins the bottleneck will be legendary cards.  I'm eager to see what sort of card trades we'll be able to do, both between heros and tiers, because it seems like we'll have a huge surplus of commons, and probably rares, and even with targeted boxes, we'll still have extras for heroes we're less interested in (or already have the skin)."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,glStelar,3,Sun Jun 28 19:01:37 2015 UTC,Was it just me or does the numbers just seem so weird for these boxes like 749 glory? I'm just asking who came up with this number it makes little sense to me
vainglorygame,3beq6k,Captain__White,2,Sun Jun 28 18:49:38 2015 UTC,The ICE packs don't seem worth it to me. That's so much ICE! And you can't even get the commons you'd need from that.
vainglorygame,3beq6k,jatatcdc,3,Sun Jun 28 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"You should get commons from glory boxes or ingame, I think we'll have more commons than we know what to do with eventually.  Ice boxes will very probably be the best way to get epics and legendaries.   I'm also not surprised that they're relatively expensive. SEMC has probably had huge costs to get the game running and to continue operating and improving it, they need to get even bigger revenues from somewhere. I think I like that they're relying on the ""luxury"" of T3 skins (they're probably gonna be very expensive). That way it's not ""pay to win"", and T2 skins aren't completely out of reach. But if you really need to get every T3 skin quickly, it's totally reasonable that SEMC asks you to put in big money, and it's totally reasonable that few people will be able to do that.  I know I'll be happy to get a T2 when I can, and then work towards an awesome T3. Probably getting getting a bunch of glory boxes and a few ice boxes along the way. And if I have to choose between using my ice and glory to buy heroes or cards, I'll probably choose to buy heroes with ice and save up my glory for cards."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,glStelar,2,Sun Jun 28 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"I'm all for T2's and T3's being hard-to-get symbols showing dedication, but the rates are just too high. I was expecting half the cost for these (and at the time, people were telling me my guess was expensive)."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,jatatcdc,2,Sun Jun 28 21:31:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's expensive. I just think that it's reasonable that most players can't afford buying more than a few packs. By making it expensive, they will maximize the amount of revenue they get out of players who could afford practically any price. Some players will spend thousands of dollars on this game.  I also wouldn't be surprised if there were sales, price reductions or other special events eventually that allowed us to get skins for cheaper... once the rich players have spent all their (relatively) easily earned money."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,glStelar,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:47 2015 UTC,"I think about spending ICE not so much about if it is worth it for that particular skin or hero but more in a way to give money to SEMC, the company that give us hours of fun for free :]"
vainglorygame,3beq6k,eh-blank-space,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:10:28 2015 UTC,10000 ice is over $80. For a skin. That's a bit much.
vainglorygame,3beq6k,glStelar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"It's a bit much for you (and me)...  But I think one of the business models that makes the most sense for free2play games is relying on a minority of ""rich"" players to spend a lot on the game. So I'm happy that other people will be able to spend hundreds of dollars to get all their T3 skins and keep the game running for me at whatever price I'm willing to pay (free, a few T2 skins, one T3 eventually?). I'm also very happy that by playing, I could eventually get for free some of the luxury (T3 skins) that others paid a lot for.  We'd be right, I think, in viewing 1.6 as the moment when SEMC starts making money. It had to happen some day, some way. For now, I like the way they've chosen."

vainglorygame,3beq6k,treboR-,0,Sun Jun 28 19:57:14 2015 UTC,I'm just saying it would be dumb to buy a skin as opposed to buying a new game.
vainglorygame,3beq6k,glStelar,2,Sun Jun 28 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"That's very subjective. I don't play console games and atm, there is no other game on which I'd rather spend money on my iPhone. I probably won't buy a T3 skin because that is a lot of money for me, but I might get some ICE packs to get the skin faster, at least in part because I want SEMC to succeed and I'm happy to be part of the initial momentum. When the audience gets big enough and rich people are spending a bunch of money on the game, I'll take a back seat and just enjoy things for free, mostly."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,treboR-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a bad thing I'm just saying, It's not worth it regardless since on most of the packs you still wont get the 6 rare cards you need with 60$. At least according to the in game footage where it showed 4 rare cards."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,glStelar,2,Sun Jun 28 21:29:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I calculate that with 6900 ICE (60$?) you can get 14 ICE packs, which will on average yield 41 Rares, 11 Epics and 3 Legendaries. Still expensive, but not impossible.  Edit: if you saw a box with 4 rare cards, it must have already had some cards drawn out of it. Both types of boxes have a total of 80 cards when full, and if I remember right (too lazy to look up right now) glory boxes have 10 rares and ICE boxes have 58."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,JekyllMD,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:35:27 2015 UTC,"True, after all, why buy an option in a game when you can just get another game? But since VG is free, some want to show appreciation for the quality game they got buy spending money on it."

About repeating, don't make sense, since in the streaming you could see exactly how many cards are remaining in the box each time they open a pack that number decrease and even more, it shows each type of cards are still there (rare, epic, etc.)"
vainglorygame,3beq6k,GEOpdx,2,Sun Jun 28 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"Going off the recap from BrokenMyth.net, it seems the boxes are on rotation because they will contain cards for only two skins at a time. So first box might only have rares and up for Ringo and Adagio or something. That way you can save your money for a pack relevant to the skin you want."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,UniqueRaj,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:26:22 2015 UTC,The rotating card thing is goddamn confusing.
vainglorygame,3beq6k,Koozaza,2,Sun Jun 28 16:47:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. I wish there was some video clearly explaining this Box system
vainglorygame,3beq6k,KingQuet90,2,Sun Jun 28 18:14:53 2015 UTC,For the ICE box it's probably gonna rotate between having the cards needed for whatever Heroes have Tier 3 skins.  So it'll be like Koshka/Ringo for a set amount of time then it switches to Ringo/Adagio then Adagio/Koshka and back to Koshka/Ringo.  I suspect that the ICE box will have a longer duration since at the moment there are only three Tier 3s announced.  The Glory box will probably be on a shorter rotation since most of the heroes have at least one skin.
vainglorygame,3beq6k,Koozaza,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works...it rotates every 3 days and they probably will have 2/3 heroes with T3 skins first.  However it's going to have cards needed for T2 and T3 keep in mind you can't just get all the cards for a T3 and weave it, you need a T1/T2 as well.  The box will probably rotate now to give you cards you need for a T2 or T3 of a hero so this will include all heroes that have T2 skins but not T3 skins like Glaive.  The glory box will have synergy with the ice box and contain commons, rares and above for heroes for the heroes skins form the Icebox.  Keep in mind that commons work with multiple heroes."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,KingQuet90,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"I based what I wrote from what I got from the screencaps from the Brokenmyth recap they did from the reveal.  I probably misunderstood from just the pictures since I haven't been able to actually watch the stream, but I think I was only wrong in forgetting that Tier 2 skins all need epics, so they could rotate the box to always have Koshka/Ringo/Adagio along with the others.  And did the devs actually say that both boxes are on a 3 day rotation?  Cause the ICE box shows '7 days left' in one cap and '4 days left' in another.  Again not sure if that was an early build they showed or not since I haven't been able to watch it myself."
vainglorygame,3beq6k,baaallllllin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:05:41 2015 UTC,hmm...I have to look back at the stream and hear what they said again...but I was talking about it with others and we were all under the assumption that it was 3 days.

Some of the player base is actually requesting MORE aggressive IAP schemes than are available.  Sure vainglory has borrowed from a lot of other successful MOBAs, and why shouldn't they, but saying they have shoehorned every single mechanic from other MOBAs is ridiculously false (it wouldn't be hard to name dozens mechanics not included in vainglory), and also the jungle camps work differently from any other MOBA I've played.

vainglorygame,3bgz94,jklick,4,Mon Jun 29 09:38:47 2015 UTC,"Building CP Taka does have a lot of fun burst, but a warning that before level 6, most of that CP goes to waste and leaves you with very little power to defend yourself. CP Taka is incredibly weak in the jungle and you're probably setting yourself up for failure against an opponent that knows what they're doing.  If the enemy team leaves you alone and let's you farm until level 6, consider yourself lucky.    If I check the scoreboard and see Taka is building CP, I take advantage of this everytime. I setup camp in his jungle and steal his jungle monsters over and over again because he can't really defend himself. Then, by the time he hits level 6, he's so far behind that he's irrelevant to the game."
vainglorygame,3bgz94,plybianz,3,Mon Jun 29 11:01:59 2015 UTC,Cp taka is too easily countered all the enemy has to do is build a couple fountains
vainglorygame,3bgz94,plybianz,0,Mon Jun 29 11:21:43 2015 UTC,Also -- fountain doesn't work because CP Taka is all burst barely any sustain. Your measly 100 heal isn't going to help much when I do 800-900 + 500 on my flip and kill you in half a second.
vainglorygame,3bgz94,jklick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:45:45 2015 UTC,You might be forgetting the kinetic shield built into fountain. Also if you wait for taka to use his x retsu and then pop your fountain you'll heal while taka waits on cooldown. I'm in hotness/simply amazing and 99% of takas I see rock weapon power for the sustain that is key for team fights
vainglorygame,3bgz94,CynicalFire,0,Mon Jun 29 11:52:16 2015 UTC,You're also forgetting that the key to this taka build is SO MANY DAM PIERCING SHARDS its crazy. Shield doesn't do much! It's just way too much burst. Same way that a fountain can't do much if you get caught in a CP Joule's BRB.
vainglorygame,3bgz94,CynicalFire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:34:41 2015 UTC,"It's not terribly weak actually. If you have a good support set up with scout traps, you can defend using the power of your Kaiten + scout traps. And if all else fails, BOX + BACKDOOR always works 60% of the time, every time. That box is super useful against jungle invades to try to backdoor."
vainglorygame,3bgz94,CynicalFire,3,Mon Jun 29 11:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a full gameplay video of you doing this against opponents that are your skill tier. It looks really good on paper, but doesn't work like that. Opponents lay their own scout traps and will see you entering their jungle. Likewise, once they've cleared your jungle, they're not going to twiddle their thumbs - they're going back to their own jungle while yours respawns. Also, abandoning your jungle leaves your support in a bad spot and makes your laner very susceptible to ganks from his own side of the jungle.   In summary, it's a lot of trouble and risk for a small chance of success."
vainglorygame,3bgz94,UniqueRaj,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:35:26 2015 UTC,"This was on my main which is SA Silver. Yes, I realize abandoning the support gets him ganked. That's not any issue to me as long as I get to level. The support just needs to build his fountain while I level quickly solo and counter their invasions by backdooring.  Let me explain the benefits of backdooring. Taka can counter early invasions by boxing, running through the tri bush where most of the scout trap defenses are, and taking their backs. Like you said, by the time they finish clearing our jungle, I'll be done clearing theirs. Unlike them, I get the full benefit from clearing solo and I level much faster than if I was running with a support. This is only vs. invading teams."
vainglorygame,3bgz94,dr3wd3zi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"So many things wrong with what you just said lol. You would clear your own  jungle much faster with support and you would earn more gold with how IGC works now. What youre doing by invading the enemy is risky and doesn't work. If they have scout traps they will see you, if the enemy is starting with back camps, they will see you, if the enemy starts in the front, it's likely they will see you. In addition, your support is left alone in your jungle, slowly trying to clear camps.   And if you start with a level 1 box, you will never clear as fast as any jungle combo in your jungle. They will finish before you. Also your level isn't affected if you're taking all the last hits like jungle carries should be doing.  /rant"
vainglorygame,3bgz94,dr3wd3zi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, you level faster when you solo with no support around. Test it yourself. I'm not saying this is something that i do every time. This is a tactic reserved for when the enemy invades and as a CP Taka I can't do shit about it except backdoor. Chill."
vainglorygame,3bgz94,jimmytruelove,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:48:49 2015 UTC,CP Taka just isn't a good choice. WP always wins out with a tension bow.
vainglorygame,3bgz94,CynicalFire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"It's actually not too bad of a choice. I'm not denying that WP is better, CP is a good and often ignored alternative though especially if you want WP/CP balance on your team and the laner is going WP."

vainglorygame,3bdd4t,WSBowman,2,Sun Jun 28 04:02:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like this cycle comes around every week; people make posts about their experiences in solo queue and then people make posts complaining about the complaining.   Very rarely does it seem that there's any animosity directed toward SEMC (thankfully) but mostly toward other players (and for good reason.) certainly some of it is just whining (I can certainly fess up to my share of that) but a lot of it leads to reasonable discussion.   So in the end, what's the harm? It seems to make the aggrieved feel better and get some validation from the community and some people get to solidify their stance on what to do about it in the future. Everyone seems like they're trying hard as it is but they're discouraged by other players. It's a little hard to just push right through that time and time again."
vainglorygame,3bdd4t,NespreSilver,3,Sun Jun 28 04:07:14 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when I look at the trending posts, more than 50% of the posts are solo queue complaints.

I'm always one to support reporting game issues to the game makers, but at this point it's just people crying. I'm not complaining that people are complaining, I'm suggesting not to complain and look at the game differently.  I want to see a healthier variety of posts.

You can populate different items and see how each individual number changes in the spreadsheet. This will give you a better idea of how the numbers work but also allow you to see which items are most optimal under different circumstances.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wxiRRjYfP7sfgoXZlHccsp1JDzlEf9Anca-k7vt_n08/edit?usp=sharing  The link only allows you to view the spreadsheet, not edit it. Just make a copy of this to your own Google Docs and you'll be able to do anything you want with it. I suppose you could save it to your computer and open with Excel, but I haven't tested to see if that works.   A key principle is that you should only ever change numbers or fields that are in white.

That said you could build a Crit Vox with almost guaranteed Crit (Two Tyrant Monacles + a Tornado Trigger or a breaking Point) but it'd be at the cost of overall DPS and probably defense."

I tend to only queue dodge now when both teammates instalock the same role. I know there are very heated feelings on both sides of the discussion (and both in the community as well as at SEMC).  There will always be queue dodgers, but but the reasons why people queue dodge could be reduced. There are a variety of ways to address instalocking but I feel like SEMC has made their call on which side of the fence they are on.  All that said, if SEMC's plan is to not address the symptoms, then acceptance is the only option, for both SEMC and the players. SEMC must accept that there will continue to be queue dodgers. Players must accept that both instalocking and queue dodging will continue to go on. If the cost of playing with an instalocker is deemed to be to high, then continue dodging and good luck. If you think you can cope with the risk of playing with an instalocker, then good luck to you as well.  Regardless of which side of the discussion you fall on, I hope your games go well and for those trying to get into a game, you don't have to wait too long."

Therefore I can't make up for that saw dying over and over.  I have much less time to play than him. I can play maybe a game or two a day. I don't follow him closely but I feel like he plays more than that. Therefore I value those 2 games and don't want to possibly waste my time with someone who has no respect for his fellow players.  I enjoy this game for the team aspect of it. Maybe I could play the round anyway and carry and mostly win by myself despite the auto locker but that's not the game I want to play and I don't think it's how it should be played. We should play as a team from beginning to end and all share in the victory or loss. If we choose a bad team comp and lose then so be it. Anything less than a team victory or loss isn't nearly as satisfying.  I don't like reinforcing bad behavior. Perhaps I'm a hypocrite because I'm dodging (which is bad behavior as well) but my action is only a response to mr autolockers initial selfishness. Perhaps if there were better communication in the select screen I could ask the person why they autolocked and explain to them why that's rude and if they were just not aware then I could continue the match but that's not possible currently so I have one way of communicating this, highlight the character and role and hope they get the hint."
vainglorygame,3bbf4o,redditor29198,5,Sat Jun 27 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"I also think another part of the problem is that the effects of queue dodging are much greater in higher tiers, where as the problem of instalocking seems to be greater in the lower tiers.   At the higher tiers, because there are fewer players, it just takes longer to match players, and when you throw in queue dodging, it just amplifies the problem to unmanageable levels. Another factor to consider is that at the higher levels, the other players are likely able to work around an instalocking playe much more successfully than a lower tier player could, so instalocking isn't seen as such a big deal.  However at the lower tiers, everyone is still figuring out the game, looking for patterns in their losses, and hopefully trying to do their best to work as a team. Lots more mistakes are being made at this level of play, and the mistakes aren't just in their gameplay, but in the analysis of what went wrong. Because of all these factors and more, people are more likely to both queue dodge and instalock, and the prevalence of both just feed on each other.  In the mid tiers, where I suspect most of the player base are, it's a total mess as far as player knowledge. Some players only want to play the one character they have mastered. Some players are wanting to try out new champs, and are likely going to do poorly for their skill level. Some are just going to instalock because they don't care about team comp and think they can carry by destroying the other team without the help of their teammates. And just like there are a variety of reasons why people are instalocking, there are a variety of reasons why people are dodging. Most all of the reasons for both dodging and instalocking are based on assumptions.   Perhaps the solution to both problems is allowing for chat in the champion selection screen. Instalockers could explain why they are instalocking. Queue dodgers could explain why they are dodging. Everyone else could better coordinate and establish their plan for the match."
vainglorygame,3bbf4o,NespreSilver,3,Sun Jun 28 01:43:26 2015 UTC,"I think this is a spot-on analysis and explains both why this conversation is more complex than it seems on the surface, and why Pretty Good is a karma nightmare."

The match begins at hero selection, and if you abandon at that point you let down both teammates, including the other one that didn't instalock. Nobody should have to requeue and wait for another match just because of your self-centered preferences. Additionally, you know nothing of the reasons guiding the player's decision to instalock and cannot prove that the player will perform poorly on the sole basis of this information. Maybe it's time to stop blaming others if you find yourself losing often.  You queue dodge, you abandon your team. It's that simple. Therefore, do the right thing, adapt, learn and soldier on."

vainglorygame,3bbmbx,Cheines,16,Sat Jun 27 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of Taka - he's my main.  However, I'm also very accustomed to countering assassins when I'm playing a squishy laner - probably because I know what I would do to counter myself.   Positioning with Celeste is really key against assassins. If you make yourself an enticing, risk free target, they will take advantage of it everytime. If you're below 50% life, often good positioning will not help because they can easily dive you, delete you, and get away. Become very acquainted with the range of Taka's X-Retsu so you know when you're at risk.   That being said, the burst from Taka's Kaiten and X-Retsu are often the greatest risk. This is sometimes overlooked because you see a WP opponent and assume you need armor. However, the base damages of Taka's abilities are pretty high (without any additional crystal power) and they're on fairly short cooldowns. Often he just uses his weapons to polish you off. If you were to mitigate that burst damage with shielding, Taka's assassination attempts become more difficult. If you were to build armor, that'll help somewhat against his basic attacks, but a lot of WP Takas will often build a Bonesaw anyway.   Assuming you're able to shrug off the burst from his abilities and he resorts to basic attacks, a good Celeste player can often pick apart a Taka in a toe-to-toe matchup via Heliogenesis, a well placed Core Collapse, and a little kiting. Don't underestimate your own burst potential. Eve of Harvest can help with sustaining you through the encounter and a Frostburn can help with the kiting.   It's often easy to predict where Taka is going to land after an ability, particularly his Kaiten. There's been numerous times where a Celeste sees me using Kaiten and has a Core Collapse waiting for me when I land - this is very annoying to a Taka player. Also, if he tries to stealth, your basic attacks act as mini flares and you can spam your Heliogenesis in the direction you think he went.   Let me know if this helps at all or if you further questions."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,jklick,2,Sat Jun 27 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"That actually helps a lot, thanks. I never thought about learning the range of x-retsu. But your right, the additional shield would help with the initial burst, and then some frostburn to help with the getaway."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,jklick,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as one example, I've often seen squishy players standing in front of their turret, guarding their lane, and feeling like they're safe because the turret will protect them. With the range on X-Retsu, I can dive in, follow up with Kaiten, then maybe an attack or two, and you're dead. I can then hit my Kaku and run away with maybe two hits from your turret. If i happen to have an Ardan, Catherine, or Fortress support, it's even easier.   TL;DR - When defending your lane, stand just behind your turret or just above it to increase your distance from a would-be assassin."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,dr3wd3zi,2,Sat Jun 27 23:22:22 2015 UTC,I would build Pauldron to slow down his attack while negating some of the damage and have boots ready for a speedy escape.

vainglorygame,3bbmbx,WSBowman,2,Sat Jun 27 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"Another Taka main here. Scout traps, even with a Celeste on your team are very helpful. If you have vision of him even near the shop bush or moving up through his tri-bush, back up and head North. Knowing his rotations will keep you safe. After the laming phase, your A has excellent range so if you can stay out of the fray in teamfights, Taka is going to either use his B to get up in your face (at which point your team should collapse on him since his escape is gone) or he will try to speed boost his way to you and you can simply kite him and deter his advances.   Unfortunately countering Taka with a Celeste has a lot to do with teamwork but when executed right is devastating for a Taka player."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,NespreSilver,2,Sun Jun 28 00:43:39 2015 UTC,"Upvote from a fellow Taka main. I can't tell you how useful it is to grab some scout traps whenever I lane. I mark both bushes up at center lane. Even just putting them in the center of he lane lets you see Taka when he's invisible and sneaking in to initiate. For 100 gold, two scout traps will give you the advanced warning that could save you and your turret.  Edited for sloppy typing."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,WSBowman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:24:43 2015 UTC,Good point! And there's less likelihood the mines will be popped if they're in your lane as opposed to the mustache bushes.
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,NespreSilver,2,Sun Jun 28 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"And even if they are popping them, it's one more thing they have to do instead of focusing on more important things."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,theteejman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:24:30 2015 UTC,I would say try to stay on the edge of team fights somewhere safe-ish. I main taka and sometimes it's harder to get to a ranged enemy if they can stay back and still do damage. Also if you can stun him the team needs to focus hard on taka because he'll go down quickly if he doesn't have an escape. The most frustrating thing as taka is to be stunned and killed almost every team fight
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,Twiggled,6,Sat Jun 27 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"The best advice to ""How do I deal with X hero"" is usually to play that hero yourself.  I'd also add though that a frostburn will be a good way to keep distance with celeste. That should deal with the WP portion of taka."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,Zaggaz,2,Sat Jun 27 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"I've tried playing as Taka (and Koshka), and I get mowed down every time. I don't mesh well with the assassin play-style. I'm also fairly consistent at keeping my distance, and marking bush with HG. But, frost burn does me no good when Taka pops up directly on top of me. Which defensive item would be best to give me more time with a frostburn/stun getaway..."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,theteejman,2,Sat Jun 27 18:21:29 2015 UTC,"An underrated strategy is to use some mines in lane. That way you can see if Taka is trying to sneak up on you, and you will certainly surprise him when you do. I try to keep a couple near top bush and lower bushes, as well as on my side of the 50 yard line."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,xmaveric,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"Probably armor, maybe an atlas pauldron to slow attack speed? Or just metal jacket for better defenses"
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,GEOpdx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"Health and reflex block can give you the sustain you need to burn him down in a pursuit, assuming you have good aim with HG and CC. Crucible offers both of these, but most Celeste players would balk at this item because it takes gold away from raw damage.   The suggestions above are great, especially from the Taka players. Distance, vision, and monitoring your health are key.   Play Taka over and over on a smurf account and you'll get the feel for him. This is always the best way to counter any hero."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,Malvix_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:55:52 2015 UTC,"Have your own assassin take him out. I play koshka and when he strikes my ranged friend I more or less wipe out a major chunk of his health. Mines help. Also, help invade the jungle with your palls when needed. He tends to snowball if left alone."
vainglorygame,3bbmbx,JekyllMD,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"As Celeste, you should be periodically placing stars in the enemy lane bush to make sure you're not being ganked, and/or placing mines there when the enemy laner isn't paying attention. Your team also needs to invest in mines in the jungle so you can see taka coming. Taka's an assassin, his biggest counter is having vision on him."

vainglorygame,3bahww,Zaggaz,2,Sat Jun 27 13:19:27 2015 UTC,did you have both mines? bc now that the minions gain the benefit of a newly capped mine right away they are really effective in big swarms.     usually when I see the second mine captured I'll run up to the lane and rush a tower with the minions. Especially  true if I'm playing support and I have the banner or the war horn.
vainglorygame,3bahww,Malodourous,2,Sat Jun 27 10:13:12 2015 UTC,nah he only had one...but somebody should have cleared that minion wave from the other team...and since those minions are so low health and you don't spawn minions when Kraken is up seems like they destroyed a tower and still went unchecked.

vainglorygame,3bbwc6,Silency,3,Sat Jun 27 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"Every hero has a base attack cooldown of 1.4 seconds, with the exception of Taka, which is 1.65 seconds. Skaarf used to be 1.9 seconds but was recently changed to 1.4, so I'm hoping they do the same for Taka so it's the same across the board.  As a side note, it still appears you can truncate this cooldown a bit by stutter stepping and clipping the attack animation, allowing you to attack a little faster.   Every hero starts at 100% attack speed, meaning they attack every 1.4 seconds. As they gain attack speed via leveling and items, the adjusted attack cooldown is:  Base attack cooldown / total attack speed  Let me know if this helps or if there's additional questions."
vainglorygame,3bbwc6,jklick,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"Oh man thanks so much, it's all i needed to know. SO Rona should have a 2.1 attack speed (+50%) then ?   Edit nvm i miss read it's 1.4 cd -> 0,714 attack speed -> 1.06 for Rona then ?"

vainglorygame,3bahq7,NothingDoom,0,Sat Jun 27 09:41:53 2015 UTC,"Wrong. Additional attack speed is added to SAW regardless of whether or not he has 12 stacks. And there is currently no cap for attack speed. The way I see it is additional attack speed after ~100% is not nearly as affective as adding more Weapon Power.  Edit: I'm wrong, there is a maximum on attack speed. My bad"
vainglorygame,3bahq7,TheeNinjaBanana,2,Sat Jun 27 09:53:03 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure OP is right about the fact that SAW's attack speed at 12 stacks doesn't get increased my attack speed items.
vainglorygame,3bahq7,teddim,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:03:23 2015 UTC,Is this because of attack animations? I've never fully understood attack speed because of this. I wish attack speed instead got displayed as an attack interval.
vainglorygame,3bahq7,Twiggled,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:08:09 2015 UTC,I think in this case it's simply by design.

Long story short, the marginal benefit of your gold depends on what you have already and the enemy's build"

I'm just worried they'll do to him what they did to Skaarf.  Edit: Welp, I went through their updates, and you're right I don't see any big changes. More the emergence and fixing of bugs that changes his gameplay, plus the alter for flares that hoped his invisibility. I only looked at the main updates (eg: 1.5 not 1.5.4). Going to keep looking because I could have sworn he had something debuffed. Something about a shift in his criticals/life steal? Ehhhhhhhhhh"
vainglorygame,3b8pn2,NespreSilver,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"Taka has been my main since December of 2014 and I've tracked him pretty carefully. As far back as I can remember, the player base claimed he needed a buff and that he was too easily countered. He was considered one of the worst heroes and many people would queue dodge if they saw a Taka lock on their team - yes, that bad.   Believe it or not, Taka became awesome because they fixed his heroic perk that had been broken for around six months. However, many people didn't realize the perk was broken and the rest overlooked the bug fix. I ended up writing a series of articles on the topic to bring awareness to the community. Once people were aware, Taka quickly went from bottom rung to top tier.   You'll probably find this interesting: http://brokenmyth.net/the-incognito-taka-buff-everyone-should-know-about/"

Not only that but it feels like he's squishier now than he was in the past.   I read that article! I actually started paying attention to his stacks and wow, 5 stacks can make a huge difference. Is the 1.3 update what I'm thinking of? (probably not)"
vainglorygame,3b8pn2,NespreSilver,-2,Sun Jun 28 20:50:51 2015 UTC,Very slightly to SEMC means they only hit him once with the nerf hammer. He's going to be utterly useless again.

Also, just had a great match with a Saw who fed early, but never pinged unless it was important, and still somehow managed to 1v3 their entire team. By standing in one place. It was glorious. Didn't even get to finish the Kraken when he killed the Vain."
vainglorygame,3b7ipn,LordScolipede,2,Fri Jun 26 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"I would call myself a functional Krul player. Lately, I have had really good luck going with breaking point then straight defense (e.g. Aegis, double Fountains, Shiversteel, Atlas). If you get your stacks up you can definitely 1v2. It can be a match swing build late in the game. I've also had great games with very good SAW players too, when done well, it is a sight to behold :)"

vainglorygame,3b7ipn,VGChicken,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:28:24 2015 UTC,Broken Myth is more assassin build. So I'd pick Broken Myth/Breaking Point based on how long the fights are lasting.

vainglorygame,3b7ipn,Come_on-Man,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"I usually prefer to go defense first. Unless you're up against someone with a lot of hit points (e.g., Glaive), Smite does more than enough damage to kill. But Smite and BP won't help if you can't sustain.  I think this is especially true given how popular Taka is right now. If he's in the jungle with you, Shiversteel should be your first T3 (and should probably be prioritized over any T2). Unless you hit him with your passive and have a really good support, he's too hard to stick to otherwise, which means you won't build stacks for either BP or Smite. Plus, 6 Smite stacks is usually enough to kill him, even without BP."
vainglorygame,3b7ipn,prettymatthew,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:17:14 2015 UTC,"I find clockwork to be an important part of my build. I get to spam DMR so often.  My first upgrade is Blazing Salvo.  Then I buy T1 boots. 2nd is chronograph and reflex block.  Then I work my way up to BP.  Then clockwork.  And start building defence after that.   I'm almost invincible by late game, barring the stuns. But this build shines in the late game only. I get bursted most of the times in early and mid game."

vainglorygame,3b7ipn,UniqueRaj,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"If Ringo or a WP Vox in lane can get a TB super-early, I'm fine with it. It has a strong impact on early game lane pokes & fights, which can help to secure objectives like the mines, but then drops off as sharply as a cliff. Get it if you know how to use it effectively, and also know when its usefulness is going to end so you can sell it and transition into your actual build."

vainglorygame,3b8b1p,as1mo,2,Fri Jun 26 19:52:20 2015 UTC,I thought that's what we have reflex block for
vainglorygame,3b8b1p,ShinakoX2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:22:01 2015 UTC,Works differently. Reflex Block you have to activate it and only costs 400. This item in league when purchased puts a shield around you that everyone can see when it is up. Once an ability is used against the person that has it the shield is removed. This means you don't have to activate anything. If that individual doesn't receive damage for 40 seconds it is up again. This of course isn't something that costs 400 gold. It is a final item and provides the ability to survive an assassination for just a little longer.
vainglorygame,3b8b1p,ShinakoX2,2,Sat Jun 27 03:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I play LoL. I like reflex block better because it requires more skill, and you can block which ability you choose. BV can be easily blocked by poke."
vainglorygame,3b8b1p,ShinakoX2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:01:08 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you mean by BV can be easily blocked by poke. You mean if you position wrong it is easy to pop someone's BV?
vainglorygame,3b8b1p,ChapterLiam,2,Sat Jun 27 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry, that's what I meant. BV can be popped easily.  Either way, reflex block is VG's equivalent of BV, it's meant to block skills. I think RB is better because it has a higher skill cap due to being an active item."
vainglorygame,3b8b1p,JekyllMD,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:48:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For example in VG, if you're fleeing and have this item up, then I as a Celeste could use my A Ability which has a one second cooldown in a good build and pop the shield, and killing you moments later with my ult."
vainglorygame,3b8b1p,Ares-2,2,Sun Jun 28 06:39:09 2015 UTC,This sounds too OP if you think about it. A nerfed version of this is literally just reflex block or crucible though.

vainglorygame,3b6by7,WSBowman,2,Fri Jun 26 13:31:53 2015 UTC,I doubt they are SA parties. Maybe one person was SA on their team but they might of put an SA on your team as well.

vainglorygame,3b6by7,WSBowman,2,Sat Jun 27 02:38:20 2015 UTC,"It's the same for me! In SA they like to pair with hotness because I think it gives opportunity to A.

vainglorygame,3b5tq3,ChapterLiam,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"Adagios are frequently mean because Adagio'a role is completely worse than other Supports, mainly Catherine, sometimes Fortress. Furthermore, his ultimate is usually stunned (the circle of pain thing). It has so much start up that he usually is stunned and can't do it. Basically, they're salty about Adagio having so much potential lost due to the nerf. Also, good Adagios don't know where to go. As the roam, it's hard to know whether you should support the Laner or the Jungler as Adagio."

vainglorygame,3b5mj2,baaallllllin,0,Sat Jun 27 19:12:10 2015 UTC,It's what everyone thinks after they get to a higher skill tier. It'll wear off eventually lol. I got to Hotness Gold and I started messing with a few characters I've never played before and went down to PG bronze at one point. Always somehow came back up pretty easily to hotness. Eventually climbed up to SA silver and I have no qualms in playing except I'm on vacation my wifi here is beyond terrible (imagine a team fight occurs and the screen lags a bit and everyone is dead)
vainglorygame,3b5mj2,dudethisis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:17:38 2015 UTC,"Good point! I have dropped once to decentish silver before but I easily came back to pretty good. Would the hotness be considered a high skill tier or medium? I know there's vainglorious, poa, and SA from highest to low, but I don't really consider vainglorious or poa to be reachable because I don't know anyone that I can team up with and I feel most players there are in parties."
vainglorygame,3b5mj2,dudethisis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:26:11 2015 UTC,I'd say it's medium. Your teammates are much better than the toxicity of PG so you'll have better games and most of the time you'll have a support on your team.   Edit: Put the other one in the wrong place :<

First as you can see, the Catherine was worried you would be in battle and she would be too far away so the only viable option was to by 6 pairs of boots in order to maximize her sprint activated abilities, while also being cost effective and not fully upgrading. I say she's B+ troll.  Next is the Vox, who seems to be a master due to his complex strategic purchases. Any respectable vain player could note that the latest update made the minions stronger and with more health. Clearly this Vox saw the in depth statistical advantage of the minion buffs and is capitalizing on them. With a minion candy he can order minions to do massive damage without any damage to himself (ie petals munions). I say Vox A- trololo"

Koshka and I tried to save Ringo from being ganked, not even 3 minutes into the match, and he ended up dying. He then preceded to ping (?)  at Koshka and I at the respawn point for the remainder of the match. He didn't even desert, so we were stuck doing 2v3 the WHOLE match until our crystal was destroyed.

vainglorygame,3b5evx,Orobobo,7,Fri Jun 26 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"Because SAW clears waves really fast. He naturally pushes lane, so people who don't know better just follow the pressure until they're kissing the enemy turret."
vainglorygame,3b5evx,MrTouchnGo,6,Fri Jun 26 04:04:20 2015 UTC,"I would also add that late-game Saw in the hands of even a half decent player can be impressive as hell. So newer players to VG (and MOBA in general) see the raw damage Saw does and decide to try it out for themselves. They know they were decimated by a Saw, now it's their turn! Saw pushes lane, advances forward, and they don't quite know how to reign themselves in yet. Oops, early game Saw doesn't do enough damage to solo a turret? Must have been a fluke, let's try again!"

vainglorygame,3b57q8,IronguardVG,3,Fri Jun 26 01:53:10 2015 UTC,"So keep in mind that an IGC effectively adds 80% gold to all jungle kills if used effectively regardless who has it to your team. If there is no obvious support and your teammate doesn't buy it, you should get it to increase your teams gold. After each jungle clear go hang in the jungle next to the lane while you wait for the jungle mobs to respawn. You'll make up most of your gold shortfall from soaking up your laners kills, and you might get the opportunity to gank the other teams laner if they over-extend."
vainglorygame,3b57q8,melbtown,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"if used effectively   If you use it like you've described, you're only adding 30% gold from the lane, as you're not taking hits to give 25% back to the laner.    If your teammate won't jungle with you, you don't get extra from the last hits either, which is the critical part to used effectively."
vainglorygame,3b57q8,yourMOMvg,2,Fri Jun 26 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"There's several useful tips in here if you haven't seen it already:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhDJoNuCaPk  I had a situation last night where someone selected Glaive. However, Glaive could be played as a roam (i.e. support) or as a jungle carry, so before I locked in, I kept toggling back and forth between the roles of jungle and roam until Glaive selected one. When he selected jungle, I selected roam, then I knew I'd be the one who would be going IGC.   Likewise, if it's still unclear who would be going IGC, just check the scoreboard at the beginning to see what your ally picks for a starting item. If we doesn't select IGC, then you should do so.   In an ideal world with a way to communicate effectively with your teammates, I would say the hero that is the most effective with only defensive items should be the IGC holder. Defensive items are the least expensive and the IGC holder will get a smaller portion of $$$. Heroes with a lot of utility abilities fit this profile nicely. As an example, Catherine's stun, shield, and silence do just fine without offensive items. Likewise, heroes that naturally have great base damages (i.e. not item dependent) also can fit the profile of an IGC holder. Glaive and Koshka are both examples of heroes that have a little utility, but are able to dish out a fair amount of damage with only defensive items."
vainglorygame,3b57q8,jklick,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:58:07 2015 UTC,"Consider a) who can effectively tank without losing enough health to be a disadvantage b) which hero will bring the most advantage from leveling more quickly by last hitting.  In the example of Koshka with Krul, Koshka can't really tank the minions too easily early on (anymore), but the boost of having Krul gain the extra level in exp in only the second jungle clear is massive. Therefore, Koshka should tank and get IGC, stock up on potions, and Krul should last-hit. If your opponents have split the jungle, vs using iron guard contract, they and Koshka should be level 2 and Krul should be level 3/4 with twice a jungle's worth of gold + IGC bonus."
vainglorygame,3b57q8,NespreSilver,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"You don't have to tank the minions with the new ICG. You can get aggro, let the creep hit you once and give the aggro to the tanky jungler."

vainglorygame,3b57q8,NespreSilver,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:03:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe you were too far away. However, there is a 5sec limit for the 25% last hit bonus."
vainglorygame,3b57q8,Ares-2,0,Fri Jun 26 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter imo. If you're jungling together, just make sure one of you has one, but if you're not (2 camps per person), no need to get IGC."
vainglorygame,3b41k1,juanplusjuan,2,Thu Jun 25 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, every time I've played triple lane we've won. So maybe it is. ;)"
vainglorygame,3b41k1,jatatcdc,2,Thu Jun 25 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen this in the lower tiers a lot lately. It mainly works because, as Ch1ldplea5e said, they're not taking advantage of the empty jungle. I'm guessing the enemy junglers kept coming up to lane to try and help but got ganked. Be glad they didn't have a smart Krul on their team, leaving him alone in the wide open jungle is a recipe for disaster."
vainglorygame,3b41k1,RaifetheRenegade,3,Thu Jun 25 21:39:46 2015 UTC,Fed Krul is an absolute nightmare... Tanky while dealing massive damage...
vainglorygame,3b41k1,_matrix,3,Thu Jun 25 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"I would say no. First off, they didn't have a real support. Sure I guess koshka could've bought support items. Secondly, for them to have such little gold when 3 people laned, it tells me they didn't try taking advantage of your empty jungle. But triple laning you are splitting gold and exp into thirds (assuming you all last hit equally). Even if you shut down their solo laner, you got two junglers who are/should have more gold and exp then anyone on your team.   It worked this game for whatever reason. Weird games happen. Weird team comps win. Crappy players sometimes beat the better players.   Anything can happen in mobas, but I would say 3 laners is most certainly NOT OP."
vainglorygame,3b41k1,Ch1ldplea5e,2,Thu Jun 25 20:27:57 2015 UTC,Lol this is satire. The other two auto locked laners so I locked ringo to get back at them.  We got lucky and the other team had no idea what to do.

This works on Vox because Serpent Mask is a very viable item for him (unlike for Ringo, for whom Serpent Mask doesn't provide enough damage) so your gold spent on these early survival items are not wasted.  Also, it's okay to be 5-10% behind Ringo in last hits, you can outscale him later with a Bonesaw + Serpent Mask / Sorrowblade build."
vainglorygame,3b3pyr,SurpriseBirthdaySEMC,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:59:36 2015 UTC,Yup! Serpents mask was what I was going to suggest too.  Ya it's better to get less CS and not give him free trades/kills.
vainglorygame,3b3pyr,fmaBlots,3,Thu Jun 25 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty consistent theme when playing against Ringo in lane, no mater who you're playing!   Life steal helps you sustain so a Book is a good bet early game. I usually stock up on potions and just try to freeze the lane on my side. When he pokes his head too far, I call for a gank. Usually that deters him from poking too much."
vainglorygame,3b3pyr,WSBowman,2,Thu Jun 25 19:02:06 2015 UTC,I buy Barbed Needle very early against aggressive laners. Focus on last hits and you should be fine.

vainglorygame,3b4xvw,Laugh_ing,5,Fri Jun 26 00:25:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not too caught up with their latest news, but I assume it's because they are going live on the Android market place out of beta. iOS and Android hold the largest market for mobile devices, so going live on the Android marketplace is a pretty big deal. Minus those on Kindle and Windows devices, it's technically a worldwide release and constitutes them truly being officially launched.   I helped found a mobile tech company and we had two official launches: one on iOS and one on Android. It's a pretty big deal when you take in consideration the market share both mobile OSs have.  But it's also good marketing. Like /u/Finndbors said."

vainglorygame,3b4xvw,FinndBors,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"I would love some more information here,   How is 're launching' a marketing technique?"
vainglorygame,3b4xvw,UniqueRaj,6,Fri Jun 26 04:45:59 2015 UTC,"When you re-launch you're basically making a big deal about it all over again. Which honestly they haven't really made a big deal of much, the original push that most people saw was an apple push not SEMC. When you make a big announcement like this and you place your name/product in as many channels as possible you get more people to see you and trying you and writing about you (which is part of the marketing device of a launch) which in turn gets more people to see and thusly try. This could also mean they are ready to start advertising (external, not ads in game) or they are open for more investment (I wouldn't know anything about that, just speculating the full possibilities of what a ""launch after the launch"" could mean) or a whole slew of other more active marketing tactics that they have not been able to focus on since they have been so diligently trying to make this a better game. As /u/AuchnotOuch said effectively doubling (more really) your potential userbase and opening the game up to a whole lot more people worldwide (could be wrong here, but I don't think iOs is as popular abroad) is a big enough deal to warrant a LAUNCH after a launch. Also Edtheshred was quoted somewhere saying that he sees this launch as us all leaving an extended beta experience and now this is the real deal."

A week from today will be the commercial launch of Vainglory, with the Android launch and the release of 1.6.

I see people praise SEMC for not having pay-to-win or other mobile game gimmicks, but in my experience, that's pretty par for the course as far as MOBAs are concerned.  IMO the MOBA crowd is far less casual doesn't work with pay-to-win, ads, or social media marketing. Even though VG is a mobile game, I find that it's like many other MOBAs and not regular mobile games."
vainglorygame,3b0lwc,ShinakoX2,2,Thu Jun 25 05:39:42 2015 UTC,"Few MOBAs exist on touch platform, so we're often times compared to  other mobile games. Yes, they buy a lot ads. Yes, they have aggressive paywalls / p2w.  That said, we're about to launch globally + Android, you might see us turning on the hype train in full gear. We do buy SOME ads, but it's a negligible portion of what we spend on stuff like...you know...paying people's salaries to make the game better."

vainglorygame,3b5r9f,ShinakoX2,5,Fri Jun 26 04:53:39 2015 UTC,...  CP Krul and CP Saw are actual things. CP Saw is pretty fun to play
vainglorygame,3b5r9f,dudethisis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know they exist. They're also inferior to their normal WP builds"
vainglorygame,3b5r9f,dudethisis,3,Fri Jun 26 08:08:18 2015 UTC,A full CP Saw is much more mobile than a WP saw.   2nd ability allows for 300(400?)% CP ratio on top of a 1000 damage and slow. His Ult will wreck when building CP but is actually bad to use if going WP. His 1st also gives him insane speed so he can catch up to any fleeing enemies and deal the death blow.  Krul relys a huge amount on his abilities making CP a better option than WP. A Clockwork + Aftershock + Attack speed + Health is enough to dominate most heroes  Edit: PG silver. Keep in mind that they are in the same tier as you so they must be equal to you to get there
vainglorygame,3b5r9f,lcpdragonslayer,-1,Fri Jun 26 08:37:41 2015 UTC,"Idk man, every once in a while I'll see CP Saws that do well, but in those cases a WP Saw would have been just as good. Most of the time when I see CP Saw he'll use his B once during a teamfight while the rest of his team dies."
vainglorygame,3b5r9f,Kraken_SEMC,4,Fri Jun 26 09:19:09 2015 UTC,"On the rare occasions I play SAW I usually go WP, but I tried CP the other day. Skill C killed enemy Celeste in 2 hits, Krul in 3 hits, and then my teammates finally caught up to 3v1 their Catherine. Aced and won. CP SAW is insanely good - but only if you have the gold to deck your inventory out. And you'll also die in 3 or 4 hits.  WP is more forgiving, but not necessarily better.   Having said this, I think your teammates expect you to join in a 3v3, not leave them to 2v3. As support there's not really a point in running. They may be playing random builds but your team was systematically picking off the enemy team one by one rather than attacking the closest red hero you should be fine. But I agree that attacking the enemy Catherine first is kinda dumb."
vainglorygame,3b5r9f,Kraken_SEMC,0,Fri Jun 26 09:47:56 2015 UTC,"I was in the teamfights, I ran away once they all died cause I can't do anything 1v3. Sure, I might finish off a kill, but it will also give them the ace."
vainglorygame,3b5r9f,peterkeats,3,Fri Jun 26 10:01:56 2015 UTC,"Clockworkx2, Shiversteel, boots, Altlas Pauldron, and attack speed on Krul is quite good IMO"

vainglorygame,3b5r9f,chacet,-1,Fri Jun 26 08:27:18 2015 UTC,"I could see that working, it's using his attack speed and low CDs. Most of the CP Kruls I see just build straight CP and are completely useless."

vainglorygame,3b1xcg,theAceAaron,5,Thu Jun 25 08:40:17 2015 UTC,More Heroes for now and then once the game gets popular enough a different map and games modes. I think a 5v5 and a quick match (5 minutes) would be great additions. Sometimes I would like to play but can't spend 20-30 minutes so something that has a timer and different objectives would be fun for a quick fix. I know this would take the game community getting a lot larger but if it does I think this would give the game enough variety to keep people coming back for more. I'm sure SEMC has already thought of most of this though haha
vainglorygame,3b1xcg,VATigerfan,4,Thu Jun 25 11:59:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone keeps saying 5vs5. I don't think people understand the resources required for a 5vs5. At the moment. I'm not even sure the air 2 could handle a 5vs5 map given the particle effects and monster spawn that is unique to VG.   All I want is draft pick and 2x the hero base. Once it's at that level then it will feel like a real moba, not saying it's not fun right now but it's still a mini moba to me.   Also you claim you can't spend 30 minutes on a VG but you want a 5vs5? You do realize some Dota and LoL games last upwards to 2 hours of you have equal teams."
vainglorygame,3b1xcg,eh-blank-space,6,Thu Jun 25 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think a 5v5 would require worse graphics and perfect connection from all players. I'd love to see more heroes in one archetype rather than adding more. For example, Taka and Koshka are the only two assassins while Fortress was just added into a whole new group of ""Initiators."""
vainglorygame,3b1xcg,ChapterLiam,2,Thu Jun 25 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"With the new power released in the updated Metal engine, I wouldn't doubt VainGlory's potential. Keep in mind that even though Modern Combat 5 has different gameplay mechanics and graphics, it still offers pretty high quality content with up to 12(?) players on a server.   I think it'll definitely take some time to nail down, and I don't know if Metal has the resources needed for a game with the quality needs that VainGlory has, but there's always hope!"
vainglorygame,3b1xcg,Tsar_MapleVG,-1,Fri Jun 26 11:51:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, perhaps reading comprehension isn't your strong suit. I said SOMETIMES I don't have time for a long game so a quick match option would be nice. Sometimes I also have 4 hours to crap away playing Vainglory"
vainglorygame,3b1xcg,VATigerfan,0,Thu Jun 25 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"Don't be rude. This topic is raised here twice a week and the same answer is told.  Yes 5vs5 would be nice but it's doubtful it's possible. It's also not what VG is about. It's not suppose to be LoL it's suppose to be it's own thing which is small teams, and small maps of action packed moba experience instead of the slow build LoL and DotA have being such large maps."
vainglorygame,3b1xcg,eh-blank-space,2,Thu Jun 25 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"I think new maps are the first order of business. Casual/Ranked gaming to separate out some of the crappy games. I like the idea of a 5-10 minute game mode--but then again, SEMC has shown that they are very invested in a well-balanced game above all else, so I'm really happy with letting them make the big decisions as they see fit--they have given me no reason to think they won't. Although the sheer number of cards you need to win a skin is ridiculous."
vainglorygame,3b1xcg,wittier_than_thou,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:57:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I would like to see an unlimited gold mode where people can just go nuts on each other without farming. At least in private matches if both teams agree would be great fun especially with ultimate bravery builds.

vainglorygame,3b1dqi,UniqueRaj,3,Thu Jun 25 04:51:13 2015 UTC,Yup
vainglorygame,3b1dqi,KarmaAdjuster,5,Thu Jun 25 05:22:05 2015 UTC,I'm unfamiliar with draft mode. What is the difference between pick order and call order?
vainglorygame,3b1dqi,Ch1ldplea5e,3,Thu Jun 25 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"It's more prominent in League.  Champ select in league has chat, so in normals (casuals) you call your position (mid top jungle supp adc) and whoever calls first gets whatever position they called first for.  In League ranked you have Draft Mode which has an order to who gets to pick what they want. Like only one person can pick at a time (2 if you're second pick) so even though you call something, if someone is above you in pick order they have priority."
vainglorygame,3b1dqi,Ch1ldplea5e,2,Thu Jun 25 05:46:09 2015 UTC,How is it decided who will be above or below me?

He's got the highest health stats in the game and is super versatile; able to be run as a Jungle Support, Jungle Carry, or a Laner. He is very viable right now. If anything, his main drawback is his rabid consumption of energy. If you're having trouble getting countered by Reflex Blocks, wait to use your Afterburn after they've popped their Reflex."
vainglorygame,3b1kru,WSBowman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:12:24 2015 UTC,"Reflex blocks aren't even really my problem, the players I'm up against 95% of the time aren't good enough to know to use them.

vainglorygame,3b1kru,Kraken_SEMC,2,Thu Jun 25 08:37:39 2015 UTC,I see Glaive played quite a bit in highly competitive play. I personally play him quite a bit. I think he's one of the best heroes to play honestly.
vainglorygame,3b1kru,WSBowman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"Gotcha! I the lower tiers, being able to carry as opposed to support seems to help you climb quickly. Maybe try a pure carry like Joule, Vox, or Taka? Glaive can be tricky if you don't have a solid team behind you."
vainglorygame,3b1kru,mcdeezel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"Glaive is a beast. Though, I agree with you on the energy consumption issue, especially for afterburn. Joule can pretty much spam her abilities the entire game without having any regen items...although this just might be a separate, Joule issue."
vainglorygame,3b1kru,WSBowman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:58:33 2015 UTC,Good point. I feel as though Joule abilities are no more devastating than Glaive's. Although it would be interesting to see what Glaive would be like with Afterburn always available!
vainglorygame,3b1kru,Ares-2,5,Thu Jun 25 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"Many players said that Glaive needed a buff, but BestCelesteEU played an awesome Glaive in the ESL Cup and CullTheMeek played him also very well in VGL NA.

vainglorygame,3b1dcd,halcyon400,4,Thu Jun 25 04:40:51 2015 UTC,Sounds like a healthy response.   I should practice that instead.  Thanks for the thoughtful and constructive feedback!

vainglorygame,3b1dcd,lcpdragonslayer,5,Thu Jun 25 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"You should try and familiarise yourself with at least 3 types, 1 lane, 1 jungle and 1 flexible, like the cheapest heroes Koshka Ringo and Catherine, so that you always have an option if someone comes in and locks what you wanted.   Usually if someone instalocks what I soft locked, I confirm last so I can fill in the gap. I'd rather let someone who instalocks a character have it because they may not know how to play any other character. If you try and lock before them it's just going to ruin your game."
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,goodthropbadthrop,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:07:29 2015 UTC,"That's a good point on waiting to pick last in that situation. I've had a few games where someone will hardlock my hero and I'll fill in the blank based on our other teammate, only to have them switch their softlock and select a second Lane or Support."
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,NespreSilver,3,Thu Jun 25 16:28:29 2015 UTC,"For myself, it's situational if I pick another hero or dodge. Insta locking suggests two things - a reliance on one and only one hero and/or poor teamwork skills. I basically assume insta lockers are not going to be the best players, so can our team afford them as a handicap? I consider: Is the disputed pick a more difficult hero to master (Krul, Taka, Celest) or someone easier and therefor less likely to damage our team? Did the other team mate insta lock too, or were they considerate and help me build the best combination?   I'd say out of the 4 or 5 times this has happen to me, I dodged only once. And if I'm remembering it right, most of those grabby teammates were pretty awful players :\"
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,NespreSilver,2,Thu Jun 25 17:24:25 2015 UTC,"I main Krul, so usually if someone is doing a delayed instalock, I've already soft-locked Krul.  It just seems like if someone isn't going to be a team player from the start, they won't be the best team player during the match.  I don't mind waiting one minute to match up with someone else who would be better bet for the team."
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,melbtown,2,Thu Jun 25 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Krul and Saw are the two ... 'problem' heroes in my solo queue. If someone instalocks Krul while a teammate had softlocked, it means trouble. Chances are I've softlocked jungle support to match Krul, and what that third person is saying is ""I don't care about team comp, I'm not going to lane regardless of what my teammates need.""   Top it off with Krul NOT being an easy hero to master. They really don't know how to play someone else? Then I don't really trust them to know how to play Krul.   As much as I hate to say it, I would dodge if the softlocked Krul didn't."
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,Malodourous,2,Fri Jun 26 02:59:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenter that it's a dick move when you're trying to be a cooperative player, but if it does happen you can also take it as a learning opp. The other play might have a better build, or have a trick up their sleeve you don't know yet."
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,ifixputers,2,Thu Jun 25 07:41:17 2015 UTC,that usually makes me upset but I don't get angry.  I tried to offer alternative heroes in case I see someone who picks the same hero that I wanted. But yeah there seems to be no shortage of people   Who have no respect for the soft lock.
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,Moofisilla,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Right. I don't get angry.  However my thinking is that if this person is thoughtless enough to instalock, what is their gameplay going to be like?  I'd like to avoid toxic players as well."
vainglorygame,3b1dcd,nvmxxx,2,Thu Jun 25 23:28:49 2015 UTC,Soft selecting a character should make it unpickable to teammates. Pretty simple

vainglorygame,3azouj,Jayblipbro,5,Wed Jun 24 20:13:37 2015 UTC,This topic comes up frequently enough I should post a full write-up rather than quickly responding with the same thing.   The long and short of it is that the real issue is about encouraging and making new players feel comfortable picking more than one hero and improving overall education about how to play as a team even from hero selection. Most of the suggestions that generally float up from auto-locking would either have no or negative impact on the overall experience.
vainglorygame,3azouj,Kraken_SEMC,4,Wed Jun 24 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"Well it's hard for new players to play different heroes when many of them cost 6000 or 8000 glory. By the time they farm enough glory for their favourite hero they're fixated on the one they've been using.  And then all of us who just go along with complementary/support heroes for the team don't teach autolockers that they're doing anything wrong - if anything we'll win and they just carry on as per usual.   Before the training mode there was just the intro tutorial and the Ringo last hit thing which then gives newcomers the mindset that you master the one hero like stutterstepping with Ringo and you'll be sweet. You're alone in the tutorials so there's already that individualist mindset. The tutorial doesn't even explain what the pings mean so people are facechecking those ! triangles thinking a map objective has emerged.   I think rather than punishing instant locking, diversification should be incentivised. Maybe there can be achievements where you can get bonus glory or a card or something if you have played 5 different heroes in a week like the daily win thing."
vainglorygame,3azouj,lcpdragonslayer,2,Thu Jun 25 09:31:12 2015 UTC,This
vainglorygame,3azouj,Kraken_SEMC,3,Thu Jun 25 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, and when thinking forward about it, casual and ranked would actually seem to solve most of these problems."
vainglorygame,3azouj,Techopath,2,Thu Jun 25 05:51:10 2015 UTC,"What if we had a 2 stage select screen. Lock in role, then move to locking in hero."
vainglorygame,3azouj,Techopath,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that sounds interesting. Can you expand on any details?"
vainglorygame,3azouj,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:49:40 2015 UTC,"The first screen would be a picture of the map with 3 options. Lane, Roam, and Jungle. Multiple players could choose a spot and everyone would be required to lock into a position before moving onto the hero select screen.   This would give your team a chance to hash out strategy, whatever it may be."
vainglorygame,3azouj,ifuckinglovekatara,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:59:11 2015 UTC,"I wrote this in another thread, but I think it's very relevant here:  Everyone complains about instalockers, but consider why someone might instalock. Not all the reasons are ""bad.""   It's the only hero they're comfortable with. They're tired of others instalocking the same hero. They're trying to practice with a hero. They don't know any better. They're selfish.   I used to instalock when I first started. At first, it was Cath, then Joule, then Glaive, then Krul. I continued instalocking Krul until I hit the Hotness. Why? Because I was good at Krul, and I also had no idea that instalocking was bad. Only after several rounds of teammates hovering on characters and waiting for everyone else to do the same did I clue in on ""Oh, making sure we have a good team comp is actually useful.""  It's a process and not everyone browses Reddit and the forums and realizes that instalocking is bad. Instead of complaining on Reddit about instalockers and other ""toxic"" behavior, take a step back and realize that maybe they just don't know any better. Try and educate them! Explain why X is bad and why they shouldn't do it. Maybe they'll listen and you'll make a difference.    Also, this suggestion has been made many times before. Here's one thread where SurpriseBirthday responded: http://www.reddit.com/r/vainglorygame/comments/34g6d5/add_a_wait_limit_to_prevent_instalockers/  I don't think adding in-game restrictions will help much. Instalocking is an obnoxious behavior, but can easily be solved by educating people on why it's bad. If someone is instalocking and they know it's bad, chances are they're not going to stop just because of a mandatory soft-lock period (or because your teammates ask nicely)."

As for the content of what I'm trying to communicate, often it is more than ""GG man, play again?"" Sometimes it is just catching up with people. Sometimes it's trying to share tips on what we could do better next game. Coordinating with two other people using a 3rd party app is just as inconvenient as fixing blind auto-correct errors.  I just feel that this chat fix is important enough to bring up one more time. It may seem like a minor inconvenience to the game as it doesn't impact game play directly, however, it is the one issue that has been causing me the most grief since the last patch.

vainglorygame,3ay3bg,joineanuu,3,Wed Jun 24 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"The instalock vs dodger debate seems to be a big one inside SEMC. One of the main arguments I've heard in support of instalockers is ""maybe that player is only good at one champ, and he knows he is really good at it, so he wants to give his team the best chance at success by instalocking it in."" And a stronger argument against dodging I've heard is ""by dodging, you are asserting that you know this other person's ability better than they do and then you are not just imposing your will on them, but you are also posing your will on the other 5 players in the game and wasting all of their time.""  As far as I can tell, the reason why they are coming down so hard on the queue dodgers and not at all on the instalockers is two fold. One: Their data shows that queue dodgers are wasting a lot of people's time with all of the requequing that is happening as a result of the dodging. Two: The team is stretched super thin and it is much easier for them to implement a deterrent for queue dodging than it is to do something about the instalockers (especially when not every instalocker proves to be a drag on their team)  I want to point out that these are not my views on the problem, but just the best arguments I've encountered when talking with the SEMC developers.  I'm actually for arguably more harsh punishments for queue Dodgers while at the same time addressing the actual problems, not just the symptoms. Some quick features that I think would help, but I've not yet been able to convince SEMC are the following:   a dodge button that allows Dodgers to dodge faster, making the process go faster for the rest of the players (the game will always have dodgers, so why not just speed up the process if wasted player time is your biggest concern) a required soft lock window, that at the very least has the potential to create the illusion of teamwork in champ select. I suspect that the biggest problem with instalockers is a perception problem. Not all of them are bad, but because of the ones who do have bad games, people group all instalockers as bad."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,KarmaAdjuster,3,Wed Jun 24 18:52:13 2015 UTC,What about a 'Dodge' button that has a cool down? Just to prevent abuse?
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if a dodge button should have a cool down. It shouldn't excuse you from any punishment though. Instead, it could provide you with a bit of text saying ""Are you sure you want to dodge? you won't be able to join another match for X minutes, and all 5 other players will be forced to requeue.""  That way it reminds the player that their choices aren't just affecting themselves."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"Another idea I've had (which is why I'm replying as a different post), is to make the punishment for dodging be that you can't play another match with people until everyone who was in the game that you dodged has had been placed into a new game, perhaps with some high upper limit for people who only had time for one game that day/week and don't get placed into a new match for days/weeks. I'm not sure how high that upper bounds should be (maybe a couple hours), but I think it would start to help make people understand how their dodging affects the other players."

vainglorygame,3ay3bg,sheridch,6,Wed Jun 24 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"Said this on another post about this topic, but I think playing with instalockers has made me a better player by forcing me out of my comfort zone with respect to hero, play style, build, and decision making. I don't find that I lose a higher percentage of games when I play with instalockers vs. playing with courteous teammates. I agree that instalocking often doesn't dramatically alter the calculus of the selection process (vs. softlocking). Moreover, instalockers are not always terrible on the hero they choose, and if you have to play a hero or role you wouldn't under normal circumstances, then why not treat it as a low pressure game to improve your own skill off your main?"

If a game is well balanced you should have a chance to win with any lineup, even if it is not ideal. Dodging a game because somebody picked their favorite hero quickly is a way more childish thing to do.   Somebody has to pick first, and this game doesn't even have text communication, so how exactly do you expect them to coordinate with you so everyone is happy?"

The point is that if you are quitting games before they start because the composition doesn't exactly match what you expect it to be, you will never truly learn or improve as a player. Playing from behind is just as important a skill as any other. Also, you might actually discover a new way to play a hero."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,ChapterLiam,5,Wed Jun 24 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with you. I used to get really annoyed by instalockers, but ultimately what I've realized is that somebody has to make their hero choice first. Lets say hypothetically that instalock Saw had softlocked it instead. How would that have changed anything? Unless he's willing to play something else (and he probably isn't) you can softlock lane Vox as long as you want, eventually you're going to switch to Catherine if you want to round out the comp. So if we're being honest it isn't the instalocking that's the problem, it's the fact that he's getting what he wants and you aren't getting what you want. That's a bummer for you, but there's no reason he should be punished for that, and if you're willing to keep resetting games until you get exactly what you want you deserve the cooldown."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,yourMOMvg,8,Wed Jun 24 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"Auto-locking is idiotic because it disregards your team. What if everyone auto-locked? Now you have a team of Vox, Ringo, and Skaarf. Everyone auto-locks, you got a team of Ardan, Catherine, and Adagio. Auto-lockers: team of Krul, Koshka, and Taka. The point is, soft-locking shows what you want to play. If Adagio, Taka, and Koshka get soft-locked, all that's needed is for Taka/Koshka to switch to a laner. It's rude, ignorant, and inconsiderate to auto-lock. Choosing first is fine, but there's a difference between first pick and auto-lock."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,ChapterLiam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:11:33 2015 UTC,"But what's the big deal? If you're someone who gets mad that someone auto-locked, aren't you also someone who soft-locks?  Thus, this hypothetical scenario never plays out.    The other extreme is that everyone cautiously picks the same 3 current meta players, and every game you play you face the same team comps.  That would get boring pretty fast too."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,thenamestsam,2,Thu Jun 25 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"A) Soft-locking isn't team-breaking and isn't rude. B) That basically happens anyway. Last week, every enemy team comp was Taka/Koshka/Vox or Taka/Koshka/Ringo."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,WSBowman,0,Thu Jun 25 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a good thing, and clearly if two or more people auto-lock you have a problem. But the reality in games I've played is that it's very rare you get two auto locks who make for an incompatible composition. Much more frequently you get one person autolocking.   Is it annoying? Yes, because it means I have to work around them to build a good comp rather than them working around me as well. But ultimately it doesn't prevent us from having a good comp. I agree 100% that it's rude to auto-lock. Where i disagree is with the idea that it deserves punishment or that it's worse than wasting everyone's time by dodging. I find that far ruder."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,thenamestsam,5,Wed Jun 24 17:16:21 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I'm on my mobile and can't see what tiers you play at. Autolocking seems to be the norm when I play. I cannot tell you how many times I've had 2 laners autolock in PG and even Hotness. How do you work around that? How do you know those two won't spend the entire game rage pinging each other and fighting over the lane while you die alone in the jungle? I fail to see how it's more rude to make them requeue (which will take about 2 minutes) as opposed to making yourself go through that game after game. I'm quite frankly fed up positively reinforcing people who display bad behavior by giving them the satisfaction of a match.
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,WSBowman,2,Wed Jun 24 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"Two laners is unfortunate, and I think the situation you're describing actually could be helped by a 10-second no-lock period. Yes a lot of insta-lockers would become 10-second lockers, but I think in some cases at least they'd see someone else going for the lane and decide to change up.   Still I have to disagree with your last point. It's not just those two people on the other team you're inconveniencing, it's also the 3 people on the other team. So that's 5 people whose time you're wasting so that you can have a (maybe) better experience. That seems pretty rude to me."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,WSBowman,3,Wed Jun 24 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"That could really help, good point!  That's true, at least there's a period in which they HAVE to see what you would like to play and reconsider their choice.  That makes sense.  It certainly is selfish but I still stand by my stance that wasting 20+ minutes of my time is a little more egregious than 1-2 minutes of other folks'."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,thenamestsam,2,Wed Jun 24 18:33:23 2015 UTC,"I used to wait until everyone chose their heroes and try to fill in the gaps with my hero choice. Now I dodge. Like he said, if you're starting off with Saw and Celeste as your damage dealers, you're probably not going to have a wonderful game. Moreover, those two autolocked; what is the probability they're going to dual lane the whole game and leave your Catherine pick to get zero farm and die repeatedly in the jungle? I feel slightly ashamed about it, but I agree with OP. I would prefer to waste the time of those who are inconsiderate and inflexible rather than my own."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,WSBowman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"I really don't have a problem with dodging the worst comps if that's what you want to do. If you're sure that the game won't be fun for you then not playing it is probably the right choice. I just disagree with the idea that autolockers deserve some form of punishment, or that the cooldowns for dodging autolockers should be reduced in some way. They're being rude by autolocking (although they may not realize it), you're choosing the nuclear option, you should accept the punishment."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,thenamestsam,2,Wed Jun 24 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you entirely but there should be at least something to steer players away from autolocking characters. Particularly in the low tiers it's a rampant problem; you get 3 autolockers and essentially start at a huge disadvantage. And as folks climb, they have to rapidly change their ways as they finally learn that a comp of all ranged heroes isn't ideal. Maybe something you have to go through in the bot match or tutorial in the academy might help.   My main issue with it is that many people only have time for one game a day or even less. It's not fair to those people that autolocking is the norm."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,WSBowman,3,Wed Jun 24 17:27:47 2015 UTC,If you're getting 3-autolockers in your game I have some very bad news for you...  You might be part of the problem
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,thenamestsam,2,Wed Jun 24 18:15:29 2015 UTC,What I mean is that everyone does it in low tiers. My girlfriend bounces b/w getting there and not bad; she thought autolocking was totally normal and she did it every game because every teammate she had did it too. That's a problem! It's teaching the wrong thing.
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,WSBowman,2,Wed Jun 24 18:18:52 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with you there. Maybe in the academy video that explains team comps they could add some more info on proper selection etiquette.
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,yourMOMvg,2,Wed Jun 24 20:50:40 2015 UTC,That would be wonderful! So much of what makes a player a pleasure to play with is just implied and unwritten. It would be kind of nice to outline what qualifies as good behavior!

vainglorygame,3ay3bg,BrianGlory,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:56:01 2015 UTC,"That's your fault. You got 2 laners auto locked on? Only buy one pot, wait a few seconds after game starts, and buy a scout trap for the jungle store area. Keep you eyes on the minimap and if you see the enemy junglers cross, just abandon whatever you are doing,a nd run to your lane and ping your jungle. Most insta-lockers are competent enough to help and you pick up an early two kills. And anyway, even if things do go wrong, early game doesn't matter at all in VG.  Got two assassins jungling? This is a niche pick, but I usually just get Glaive. Start with energy battery and pots, rush Clockwork, and then build full support from then on. Max your Afterburn first, let the enemy push, and whenever they gank, just throw a squishy into your turret."

I've literally been unable to find a game for 40 minutes before due to a perfect storm of repeated queue dodgers and party queue glitches.   If you want to dodge, fine. I can understand the reasons behind dodging (I've certainly done it before), but stop whining and just take the penalty - it's in place for a reason.   Additionally, there's really no way to prevent people from instalocking. People have suggested making you unable to lock in for X seconds, but that just turns the instalocker into an X-second-locker."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,peterkeats,4,Wed Jun 24 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"Re the soft lock window, it doesn't JUST turn an instalocker into an X-second-locker. It also changes the perception of that would be instalocker. By everyone getting a chance to see what your teammates intentions are, you give EVERYONE on the team a chance to rethink their choice. Sure, some players still won't change their choice and instalock as soon as they can, but I think there will be fewer of those matches and way more people who are willing to build around a comp that they would have otherwise dodged because someone locked in before they even had a chance to look at their options.  It is a subtle change, but a change that will have a much bigger impact than a lot of people realize."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,KarmaAdjuster,0,Wed Jun 24 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say instalocking will definitely be at large in ranked as people won't want to play as a hero who they're not used to so will autolock their main.  And as for wasting 5 people's time, by queue dodging you would be saving your two teammates from wasting 20-30 minutes playing a one sided game and saving your ELO."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,peterkeats,3,Wed Jun 24 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"I've won just as many games with autolockers as I've lost.   Sorry you have such a bad taste for them. Dodging is your solution, but it hurts the other people who are willing to play the game.   Not all autolockers are shitty. Also, part of becoming a better player is learning how to win despite shitty players on your team."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,KarmaAdjuster,3,Wed Jun 24 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"This post right here is why I think the enforced soft lock window will help the problem of instalockers. It's the perception that instalockers are bad players that is causing the problem for a lot of people. The reality is that some people who instalock will be good, some will be bad. Some people who don't instalock will be good, and some will be bad. The tempting mind trap that people fall into is to look for a pattern in the bad player behavior, and they will find a pattern, even if that pattern doesn't exist. In this case, the pattern is that instalockers are bad players, and whenever they see another instalocker that plays poorly, they add that data point to support their cause while unconsciously not adding data points that contradict their cause. /u/peterkeats is NOT doing this here though (or probably not doing this - I can't know for certain), but I think he is being more realistic in acknowledging that instalockers aren't all universally bad.  The real problem is that people don't feel like they have time to work with an instalocker. They only have the option to work AROUND them, and that is frustrating. By creating a enforced softlock window, many players will feel like they were given that opportunity to work WITH the would-be instalocker."
vainglorygame,3ay3bg,iwanttobeadog,5,Wed Jun 24 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"I played about 50 games and kept stats. I noticed that I benefitted from AFKs more often than I lost from AFKs. I also noted that I won and lost as many games with instalockers. Rarely could I determine that the instalocker was the reason I lost. The noticeably lowest skill players were never instalockers, and they usually picked Glaive.  Instalockers usually at worst played a bad version of Krul / Taka / Celeste / SAW / Vox, but were not unskilled. Sometimes they were rather good. I didn't keep stats on this, but I don't recall Instalockers trolling.   These were done on a smurf as she went from the low tier up to about PG Silver in approximately 50 games.

vainglorygame,3azga4,DeafSmithVG,0,Wed Jun 24 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"I do, and it's difficult not being able to play on a solid device. So I hurry out and get a new device ordered (it will be here tomorrow) and I was set to play, stream, and have fun/rage at my casual games!  Now I have to wait who knows how long (no confirmed release from support, just a ""very soon"")  I would do terrible, awful things to get added into the beta late though. turrible thangs..."
vainglorygame,3axyn6,lcpdragonslayer,5,Wed Jun 24 11:57:16 2015 UTC,"this is normal, you capitalized on a mistake the enemy team made and when you capitalize on a mistake in the late game, it usually translates into a win. good job for holding on that long!"
vainglorygame,3axyn6,lolremy,3,Wed Jun 24 12:05:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, one misstep late game and your whole team in gone for 45 seconds. Next thing you know all of your turrets are gone and by the time you spawn back in there's nothing you can do."
vainglorygame,3axyn6,ifuckinglovekatara,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:09:34 2015 UTC,Ok good to know. Most of the time when this happens it feels like we lucked out!
vainglorygame,3axyn6,VATigerfan,4,Thu Jun 25 08:52:30 2015 UTC,Catherine is very strong late game when she has a full support build so maybe early the other teams are taking advantage of your early weakness and then once you start getting stronger you end up winning those fights you would lose early.  Also like someone else mentioned the late game Ace is a game ender in most situations. Usually lower level ELO teams will get way too overconfident from their early game success and make mistakes late which cost them. It's normal. You will be on both sides of it many times while playing this game. Enjoy it when you make the swing and try and laugh it off when it happens to you and learn what you did wrong
vainglorygame,3axyn6,SugarVenomSEMC,2,Wed Jun 24 12:20:53 2015 UTC,This! My late game Krul makes up for all my early game sins.
vainglorygame,3axyn6,LordScolipede,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:37:59 2015 UTC,Isn't that why you made Koushka? So you can pound pounce faces no matter what time of the game it is?
vainglorygame,3axyn6,SugarVenomSEMC,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:58:13 2015 UTC,Koshka is a whole other playstyle. A playstyle that I am not much good at :D
vainglorygame,3axyn6,FinndBors,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"This. Sometimes a team has a bunch of late game heroes like vox and krul, and the other team has strong early game ones like koshka and adagio. If you hold out, the tides turn. Also sometimes a team gets some dominance early on (possibly due to the above) and gets the level advantage early. You got to hold out to level 12"
vainglorygame,3axyn6,ShinKaigan,4,Wed Jun 24 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"I actually like the way the game is right now. That way no team ever gets too complacent with how they play. If you make a big mistake like getting caught out, or engaging in an unfavorable fight then you deserve to lose even if you were ahead. It also makes it more interesting because the victor isn't decided so early and there is always that hope of a clutch comeback."
vainglorygame,3axyn6,thunderskain,2,Wed Jun 24 16:33:46 2015 UTC,You can't say that you dont deserve to win. The enemy team could've won the same way too but they made mistakes along the way giving you guys the opportunity.   They could've secured the kraken by getting more detection They could've secured the kraken earlier They could've hunted you guys down before going for the kraken   Games that last that long falls entirely on which team getting kraken.
vainglorygame,3axyn6,ChapterLiam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:06:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of my team is ever going for Kraken I always hunt down - at the very least - the burst damage character, which is usually Koshka or Taka."
vainglorygame,3axyn6,thenamestsam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is if your enemy was actually ""dominating"" the first 20 minutes then the game would be over. If the game is stretching past the 20 minute mark on towards 25 it's a relatively close game by definition. Your opponents may have been outplaying you in the teamfights to that point, but if they can't turn those wins into objectives to snowball their way to victory then their play is also seriously flawed.   Then at the point you've made it to the lategame a teamfight is supposed to be definitive. If you can defend your base well enough to bring the game to that point and then you have enough in the tank to win the critical teamfight you deserve to win. Give yourself some credit."
vainglorygame,3axyn6,divergence-aloft,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:29:37 2015 UTC,"i've unfortunately noticed a lot that if one team is getting a bunch of kills early on, they won't buy any defense which becomes detrimental late game"
vainglorygame,3axyn6,nvrslnc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"This is actually quite important, when you think about it.   The tendency for carrys is to buy defense only when it is needed. Assuming the extreme and imagining that one team is basically crushing the other till mid-game, a lot of people won't find it necessary to buy defense item. The problem is that you may die in early to mid game quite safely or even get aced but in late game you will be punished harder. Sometimes even by losing the game."
vainglorygame,3axyn6,wolf_hands,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with what everyone has said here. Early game success does not always translate into late game wins.

I could not imagine we would won, cause there jungler had the whole jungle for like 10 minutes.   Love the game, great controls! Hope to see some cool updates soon!

vainglorygame,3awani,DrAquafresh,3,Wed Jun 24 06:28:00 2015 UTC,"IGC = Ironguard Contract.  It's a support item that can result in two junglers getting significantly more gold than without it. How it's used is that the player with the IGC (Ironguard Contrat) initiates the attack on a jungle camp, but lets the other jungle get the last hit.   As long as the jungle monster hits the IGC holder once and another player kills the monster while the IGC holder is nearby, they are awarded about significantly more gold for killing that monster than if just one player killed it without the contract.  Edit:  Check out this video for more detailed info on using the Ironguard Contract"

vainglorygame,3av6sg,Ch1ldplea5e,2,Tue Jun 23 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely buy Krul. Once learned and mastered to a degree, Krul is one of the best champs in the game. His skin in game and splash art look amazing. And he is viable.   Adagio, not so much on all those things above.   So what I'm saying is, but Krul, he's worth it. Wait for adagio to become more viable and let SEMC find what his best role is then buy him. It's sad cause I love his skill set. But yet he doesn't have a best role that fits him. I always believe full support was the way to go for him."

The way the impact seems to spread out and then the slightly delayed pulse of heat(?) from the middle, along with the extended duration that the mark is visible may indicate an Ult.   I speculated that it was potentially her B skill, due to the overall size of the impact area being small when compared to Ardan's Gauntlet, or Adagios Verse of Judgement. However, that may just be an indication of how powerful the effect is."

vainglorygame,3au3ud,adyendrus,4,Tue Jun 23 14:58:09 2015 UTC,I think once they get to 18-20 Heroes a draft mode for hero selection can be implemented which will make the game much more balanced
vainglorygame,3au3ud,plybianz,2,Tue Jun 23 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"Very interesting post. Some thoughts coming at it in particular from a spectator perspective:   Completely agree with you on the draft+ban mode. Not only does it help balance the game but it also makes for much more interesting games because it really increases the diversity of comps you see. I'm curious whether you think there are enough heroes for ""exclusive"" picks (i.e. if Team A picks Glaive, Team B can't). My feeling is that there are just about enough, but it's right on the edge. 2-3 more heroes and we should be good to go in that respect. Vision: Do you think they just need to fix the ""bugs"" in the current system (not sure if they're actually bugs), or would you like to see some additional vision items as well? One change I'd really like to see is an increase on the flare price and a corresponding increase on the amount of time it grants you vision of one area, or alternately, the addition of some kind of ward item that would give you perma-vision of an area until it was cleared in some way other than just stepping on it.  One thing you didn't mention is the state of announcing in the game. I think PlayoffBeard and Zekent have done a really great job when I've heard them cast matches, but I have been less impressed by the non-SEMC casters I've heard. Particularly in terms of analysis I often find them lacking - not enough breaking down the relative strengths of diff't comps (i.e. you mention lots of games being decided by early invade comps but rarely have I heard casters discuss which team has an invade comp etc.), not enough detailed discussion of builds (frequently casters just list the items each player has), not enough discussion of in game strategy. Good casting is pretty critical to making high-elo matches approachable to the lower-elo players who make up the vast majority of the playerbase as the games look very different at the two levels."
vainglorygame,3au3ud,thenamestsam,4,Tue Jun 23 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"1) I think there are enough heroes that are considered tier one to allow for exclusive picks. Celeste, Vox, Glaive, Joule, Koshka, Taka, Catherine, and Fortress are all broadly considered to be top picks, which means that even with bans, each team would get three of those heroes. People are still open to pick any of the other heroes, I was just listing the most-popular ones in the tournament.  2) Yes. And yes. Fix the existing bugs. Add additional vision items as well.  3) I was really pleasantly surprised with the casting from Jason Kaplan, and I've loved the casting from DonJon and bluberryz. I think they will only get better with time. I actually found myself appreciating that DonJon knew the names of different abilities, like Merciless Pursuit, etc. I verbally acknowledged when he referred to a ""pot"" or ""potion"" as a ""Halcyon Potion"". It was the most correct term, and I really liked the added touch. That shows that they understand the game, and they are casting in their second (or third?) language, so you really have to give them credit. I have cast tournaments and I'm fairly sure that they are doing a better job than I would have done!  Thanks for the thought-provoking questions!"
vainglorygame,3au3ud,peterkeats,3,Tue Jun 23 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"The casters are getting there. I remember when Kaplan and DonJon kept calling Joule ""Julie."" Sacrilege."
vainglorygame,3au3ud,thenamestsam,2,Tue Jun 23 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answers. On the casting note I just wanted to clarify that I generally find their play-by-play casting to be pretty solid which is what you're mostly addressing. As you say they know the names of the abilities, the heroes, and they do a great job of really presenting things porfessionally given the newness of their operation. I find that they generally describe the action quite well. I agree that those guys are doing better than I would do (certainly).   I think that it's maybe not a matter of replacing those guys as much as supplementing them with a really high-elo player. As a mid-tier player myself I often feel like my more complex questions aren't being addressed. Zekent does a great job with that in the SEMC casts and I feel like his role is the one maybe not being filled to the greatest extent possible."
vainglorygame,3au3ud,KingQuet90,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:17:59 2015 UTC,"I think with the hero pool we have now we could do 1 ban from each team and do a draft mode w/o mirrors on the other team.  I like the idea of draft mode and can't wait to see it implemented, I like how you said they should just take care of it in chat before the match.   I also think that they do have a 2-3 min delay on the game...I think twitch delay is a little longer than 30 seconds...I think it goes up even more if your a twitch sponsor...not sure if VG League or Vainglory's channel is.  I do know its a couple minutes, or at least that's what they've claimed multiple times."
vainglorygame,3aw5n5,ReamusLQ,5,Wed Jun 24 00:00:21 2015 UTC,maybe you beat a few teams that were pg/hotness level so u got a big jump. your tier updates every 5 games.

Quick edit: If you want, you can buy Catherine for 800 Glory once the free heroes change. New accounts start with 1200.  Glaive's ult deals damage in a circle around him when activated. The damage dealt depends on the number of Bloodsong stacks you have, which cap out at 20.   You got his passive; his crits become AOE. From my understanding, though, they don't deal full damage. It depends on how far you've upgraded his B, but I'm not sure.  Generally, you shouldn't take the mines right away because it can lead to your laner overextending, making it easier for the enemy team to gank. Stronger minions also provide more gold and EXP to the enemy team. I think the best time to take them would be when you want to push the lane.  Hope I helped. :D"

I know I will reach level 10 until the update comes, but a lot of people who took a time off of the game will have to play a lot of casual till they reach level 10, so they can play ranked.

Towards your comment about meta and items, I kind of agree with you. But it's just silly that you have to level up till 10 if you are Vainglorious or PoA. The changes are not that big that justifies all that leveling up.  It's an awesome system for low elo players. But when you got higher the less toxic player will have in those ranks. But it is what it is, just my two cents hahaha"
vainglorygame,3atv49,daniellidio,3,Tue Jun 23 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"You can play with friends as long as they're not more than 1 tier away from you, otherwise you just have to rank up with others, I can understand the frustration there though.  I think it still matter if your POA or VG that you level up, if you've been gone for a while your still a little rusty and don't know how to defend against newly balanced heroes and/or new ones.  I just look at it as a way for SEMC to try to guarantee that ranked mode is really competitive and gives better teammates and games."
vainglorygame,3atv49,KingQuet90,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"The problem is that games before 1.5 does not count toward your account level, but that will only be a problem until everyone who's been around for a while reaches level 10."

That week a ran into a string of super toxic kids that I was unable to cope with, and I went from hotness (probably bronze hotness - it was before the gold silver bronze rankings) to bronze decentish. It was an extremely frustrating week for me.  I wonder how much of my mind set going into those games was tainted by my own experiment."
vainglorygame,3at26c,KarmaAdjuster,2,Tue Jun 23 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"Exact same here (including the low pre-gold/silver/bronze hotness).  I used to dodge alot (oddly, rarely got penalized), then after reading all the anti-dodging posts a while ago, I tried not dodging for a while.  Took a huge nose dive down to decent-ish.  Yeah, you can try filling the gaps in your team comp (instalock Saw/Ringo + Taka again, eh?  Guess I'll have to play Cath yet again), but there's only so much you can do when you get:  kamikaze laners, I-don't-need-no-stinking-defensive-items players, try-hard junglers who push way too deep, AFKers, trolls, etc.  On top of that, as you fall down in skill tier, you get teamed up with crappier and crappier players, which creates a really bad feedback loop.  You basically end up at the mercy/luck of the matchmaking system, even with 20 karma."
vainglorygame,3at26c,Goonie_GooGoo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"Matchmaking in MOBAs (or any team game for that matter) is super tricky. I don't think any game does it quite right. It's an interesting problem though (at least to me).   The problem as I see it is that most matchmaking systems take the Elo system which was built for chess, a 2 player game, and are trying to apply it to games where a side is made up of a teammates who potentially have a variety of different skill levels. The big problem with going this route is that it is entirely possible for good players to lose rank due to lesser skilled teammates and conversely, lower skilled teammates can be carried by players who are more skilled. Sure over enough games, the Elo system will work, but it requires tons of games to work out the noise. What this means for MOBAs is that to advance in solo queue, you need to not only be skilled enough to reach your projected skill level, but you also need to be skilled enough to carry everyone else who isn't as good to your projected skill level. In other words, if you are a Hotness level player, you have to be able to carry a team of Decentish players through Pretty Good before you can make it to Hotness. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ACCUSE YOUR TEAMMATES OF SUCKING OR BLAMING THEM FOR LOSING. This is just a problem with using Elo for ranking team games.  I've been working on a better system that takes into account the stats of each player in a game and then determines how well they played that game, and it completely ignores whether the player won or lost. So in theory, you could lose 10 games in a row, and still go up in rank with every game if you were the strongest player on your team or the whole game.  Right now it's based on a small sampling of League of Legends games, and I hope to eventually turn it into a matchmaking system, not just a rank evaluating system, but so far, when I use it to evaluate how games should have gone, it seems pretty accurate. For example, if I have a game that goes terribly one sided, and then compare each teams cumulative player ranks, it shows that yes, the team that one did have a significantly higher combined rank. And for games that are pretty even, comparing the ranking scores shows a that each team's combined rank scores were also pretty even.   So I'm pretty happy with how it's progressing and while I'm sure there's loads of room for improvement, it certainly feels like it's heading in the right direction.  And that's probably way more info than you were expecting or cared about. >_< I feel your pain though. Good luck with solo queue."
vainglorygame,3at26c,KarmaAdjuster,3,Tue Jun 23 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"Determining how well someone played a game is really hard to get right and cannot be made public info or easily calculated lest it be gamed.  Semc did mention that they do attempt to do this and factor it into the elo change calculation, but they aren't making the details public because that would be stupid. During a few stints of my elo drop I have considered whether my style of play is a factor in my elo dropping even though I felt like my win loss ratio is even."
vainglorygame,3at26c,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all accounts. I would like to think that if you pick the right stats to track, it wouldn't matter if they were made public, but it's still better to leave it a mystery if only so the players are focusing on playing the game and not how their ranking is determined."

vainglorygame,3at26c,_matrix,2,Tue Jun 23 12:48:48 2015 UTC,I have absolutely no idea how people drop so hard. If you drop that hard... I don't even know. How is it even possible to go from like (ex) SA to Decentish?

vainglorygame,3as83q,Musa_,7,Tue Jun 23 02:21:35 2015 UTC,None of the builds make any sense. I honestly have no idea what any of these people were doing. Why is there so much pierce from both sides when there's almost no defense?
vainglorygame,3as83q,jatatcdc,3,Tue Jun 23 02:24:53 2015 UTC,what pierce? are you confusing barbed needle with piercing spear?

vainglorygame,3as83q,peterkeats,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:06:02 2015 UTC,Yeah. It gets you closer to doing true damage.
vainglorygame,3as83q,peterkeats,2,Tue Jun 23 13:43:05 2015 UTC,"My team consisted of me trying to be a support Koshka, and 2 insta-lockers. Of course, Krul and Saw - only the most popular. I thought this would be a sure win... boy was I wrong. 3 supports... beat us, by not supporting. Catherine kept stunning only me, Her and Ardan had too much health to kill, and our focus was all off (shouldve been focusing the main damage dealer - Fortress). Overall I was pretty stumped, but this stuff happens, and there's nothing I can do other than to improve my own gameplay."
vainglorygame,3as83q,dubiousatbest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:24:21 2015 UTC,"You were probably focused because you had an Aftershock and were the biggest threat to them. Maybe you should have started building armor and tanked up a little more.  When supports become carries, just like when carries become supports, it throws off the game. You want to focus on the carry, but when there is no carry the focus is awry. This is just a live-and-learn game. You probably won't see this combo much in the future (but I could be wrong, I suck at anticipating metas)."
vainglorygame,3as83q,theSDRexperiment,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"How is your build support koshka? Did you already sell your contract? You have one support item (fountain), which is the same amount that Saw has. Their carries built weapon. Maybe you should have built pauldron? Crucible to stop the silence?   You should be happy if Cath is stunning you instead of Saw. You'd think Saw would crush lane farm in this game. I'd guess he got ganked a lot."
vainglorygame,3as83q,Heitred,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess 1 Fountain doesn't exactly make me a support. I tried my best, I know I needed more defense but we still needed more DPS."
vainglorygame,3arkne,TheeNinjaBanana,2,Mon Jun 22 22:59:03 2015 UTC,Can devs confirm this or is this like blowing on my Nintendo cartridge?
vainglorygame,3arkne,fredandersonsmith,5,Tue Jun 23 03:20:01 2015 UTC,"This works, but it's not ""calibrating"" anything, it's just not sending any new commands into the server allowing your client to catch up. It will position you where the server thinks you are, and once the client knows that your character will move there this syncing the client and the server.  It's not a fix, nor is it calibrating, it's just allowing your client to catchup."
vainglorygame,3arkne,swordstoo,3,Tue Jun 23 03:32:37 2015 UTC,"Calibrating means to adjust, or compensate. Waiting for your client to catch up is not calibrating."
vainglorygame,3arkne,swordstoo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:08:43 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's a matter of speed. The reason I said ""Calibrate"" was because it was quickly fixing the issue by making a brief comparison. But it's less of that and more of how much latency you have, so yes, I'm wrong."

Also, WiFi channels affect it extremely. If your WiFi is on the e same channel as your neighbors and your neighbor is streaming video right now, lag will be drastically higher  If you have DSL internet, the delay will be longer (I can explain why if you want to)."

vainglorygame,3as2e3,fredandersonsmith,4,Tue Jun 23 01:32:35 2015 UTC,you only get a one minute penalty for dodging the first time. hopefully you don't get two autolockers in a row.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,solid77,6,Tue Jun 23 01:34:22 2015 UTC,I get auto lockers 4 out of every 5 games.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,autism-lord,3,Tue Jun 23 01:55:10 2015 UTC,It gets better in higher tiers. Most people are quite courteous or flexible.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,autism-lord,5,Tue Jun 23 02:33:14 2015 UTC,I have see this. I got to hotness by dodging bad comps and auto lockers. But now that I am forced to play with them I went down to decentish and I just got back to PG.

vainglorygame,3as2e3,NespreSilver,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:53:34 2015 UTC,You went from Hotness to Decentish? I am pretty sure you're exaggerating.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,ChapterLiam,2,Tue Jun 23 18:10:54 2015 UTC,It didn't happen in one game. I think it happened in one weekend.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,ChapterLiam,2,Tue Jun 23 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"I mean in general. If you were good enough to get into Hotness, wouldn't your skill itself keep you in at least PG?"
vainglorygame,3as2e3,sheridch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:28:36 2015 UTC,You would think. The thing is I am not that good and neither were was my team. Dodging helped a lot to get me to higher tiers because having a decent team helps that much. I was at PG for a while till I found out that there was no penalties for dodging.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,SonicServices,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"Nope, had the same thing happen. Terrible teammates won't ruin every game, but they can ruin enough that it's easy to drop and even harder to climb back up. Mediocre players (and I'm including myself in that group) can get to Hotness just by not being stupid. But a toxic teammate or dedicated feeder can make the difference between a match being a challenge and a match being outright unwinnable. Get enough of those teammates in a row and welcome to Low Teir Purgatory."
vainglorygame,3as2e3,glStelar,3,Wed Jun 24 17:54:36 2015 UTC,"Be ready to play in any position. I have Taka, Skaarf, and Adagio ready to play in case of auto-lockers. Other than that, put in a chat system pre-game."
vainglorygame,3as2e3,xmaveric,2,Tue Jun 23 02:51:41 2015 UTC,That is what I do. But sometimes I want to play my preferred hero too.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,kaivorb,3,Tue Jun 23 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"In that case, immediately soft-lock. It doesn't beat auto-lockers, but wait thirty seconds and lock in if no one else has taken you role."
vainglorygame,3as2e3,Kraken_SEMC,3,Tue Jun 23 10:45:51 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Dealing with autolockers will make you a better player even if it's annoying.   I agree that it's mostly an issue of of poor etiquette among players who haven't learned the finer points of hero selection yet. It's annoying sometimes, but it's hardly a rampant menace ruining the game. I play most of my games in the PG to Hotness Gold range, so I encounter my fair share of autolockers. I never dodge, and I'll make three points in support of that position:  (1) If someone autolocks, I take it as a challenge. Especially if the hero in question is a jungle carry. I main supports. If I can ensure that a player of suspect skill/ decision making on a given hero is able to farm effectively and deploy his/her damage on the opposing team with some degree of efficacy, then it's a sign that my skills are improving. Skill tier is not the only way to derive satisfaction or confirm improvement.    (2) Although I don't keep sufficiently detailed statistics to quantify this, my impression is that my record in games involving autolockers is not significantly different from my record in games that don't involve autolockers. In other words, autolocking is no guarantee that the player in question will, in fact, display suspect skill. The weak link on the team proves to be me or the third teammate almost as often as the autolocker. Maybe my experience differs from others'; maybe the relevant stats would bear out a different conclusion. Maybe the other team is just better and would win in any case.   (3) When someone autolocks the role I main, I take it as an opportunity to practice my skills on carries or to experiment (within reason). I behave exactly as though someone has softlocked a hero in my role (I let that player have it if he was first). That way, I can be a better, more versatile player when it counts."
vainglorygame,3as2e3,kaivorb,5,Wed Jun 24 05:03:55 2015 UTC,SEMC have been pretty clear on their stance with this issue. If you want to choose other peoples characters then join a party.... don't shoot the messenger...
vainglorygame,3as2e3,Kraken_SEMC,2,Tue Jun 23 12:47:29 2015 UTC,"Ignore the problem, hopefully it will go away. Nice. I understand the recommendation. Thanks for the info."
vainglorygame,3as2e3,Kraken_SEMC,2,Tue Jun 23 13:00:48 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it's not necessarily a problem. The problem has to be better defined (than just labelling it ""instalocking""). Maybe others have some experience as to whether this is a problem in other MOBAs and the possible solutions.  IMO it's not that big a problem. And if it were a problem, the solution would probably require huge changes to hero selection, and then it would not look anything like what it is now. It would have to be a big, pervasive and very toxic problem to justify such big changes by itself.  I wouldn't be surprised though if it were solved in the future as a side effect of new hero selection modes, such as draft picks."
vainglorygame,3as2e3,Kraken_SEMC,4,Wed Jun 24 03:31:06 2015 UTC,Deal with it. They help you get better at selecting complementary heroes.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,kaivorb,2,Tue Jun 23 13:11:53 2015 UTC,Why not have a 5 second window where no one can lock in or no one can lock in till all have soft locked.
vainglorygame,3as2e3,An0therk,5,Tue Jun 23 03:16:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with the ""delay"" mechanic is that it won't change anything. ""Autolocking"" is a mentality thing. It is either someone who is new and scared to play anything else, someone who just bought a shiny new character/skin and really wants to use it regardless, or just a person who is selfish.  .  Regardless, it is their thinking that won't change. As soon as your delay is done, they will then autolock. Same concept, just pushed back. No matter how long you make them wait, they will just do it once the window opens.  .  Heck, I'd probably be a autolocker if I didn't know better and spend my time reading on boards about all the hate they receive. People new to MOBAs have no idea. It's a whole new play style than what they're used to. As a relatively new player myself, I had no idea until I read about it.  .  My guess, once again coming as a new player, is that 80% of autolockers have no idea what they are doing is bad. They play this as a very solitary game. Don't go to reddit. Don't read the boards or listen to the 'casts.  They just play. They need to be educated. Heck, it's what saved me.  .  My best solution: a delay of 20 seconds and make a ""chat feature"" during character selection. That way people can talk and educate and come to a consensus. Help guide the new people so they can see why things are happening. I'd bet it would solve the issue more quickly.  .  And then take off chat during the actual game (SEMC has said they don't want in game chat to avoid rage trolls). Only allow it for a short window at the beginning.  .  Anyway, just a (long) thought.  Thanks.  .  [Edit - attempted to format on mobile to ease wall of text]"

vainglorygame,3arx03,teddim,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"A CP adagio is still very much a support adagio. Adagio in general is just a support character based on his kit.  As Adagio support, you will build a defensive item or two first, and a shatterglass."

As far as WP and energy goes, the whole point of WP builds is that you're reliant on basic attacks. That means you have to manage your energy wisely and just not spam your skills at every opportunity, since your energy won't regen back very quickly (if you don't want to waste a slot on a battery or Chronograph).   While interesting, I think the items we have now are fine.

vainglorygame,3ap067,An0therk,9,Mon Jun 22 09:28:46 2015 UTC,I agree that I never surrender when the other team is about to smash the crystal because I think they've earned the right to crack it.   However I've had some teams lately in the hotness and SA that have such a gold advantage that they just completely destroy us and refuse to do the final hit on the crystal. They just camp our base and keep wiping out our team.   So like any other change that seems minor and seems like a good idea it can also lead to trolling. So for that reason the surrender needs to stay in the game.

vainglorygame,3ap067,Avenue745,3,Tue Jun 23 15:35:00 2015 UTC,No. For trolling. The object of the game isn't to get as many kills as possible. It is to destroy the vain crystal. That sort of behavior is just griefing. The truly better player person would end it as soon as possible.
vainglorygame,3ap067,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:00:17 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The only time I ever surrender is when I've got a teammate that's being completely unbearable (like a ping spammer). I've even stuck it out to see how long we could survive a 2v3 and even come close to winning sometimes!  It is unfortunate when the other team denies you the opportunity to destroy their vain crystal. Mandating that everyone be a good sport though seems a bit much. It's hard enough trying to keep people from being blatant asshats on the internet.
vainglorygame,3ap067,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:02:44 2015 UTC,"So you are saying players should not be able to surrender, just because you want to destroy the crystal?   It is generally never a good idea to restrict someone for the sake of other's entertainment."
vainglorygame,3ap067,nvrslnc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:35:52 2015 UTC,It's hardly restricting when It's the main objective of the game I understand if your team is getting destroyed 20-5 and there's no hope. But in late game after an exiting match an ace can lead to a surrender which feels like an anticlimax.
vainglorygame,3ap067,nvrslnc,5,Mon Jun 22 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"So what? Why should the team who lost the game be forced to stay in the game just because you feel like it?  This should be, as it is right now, the choice of the opposing team and not yours. Maybe it is BM if they leave and good sportsmanship if they bear up against the urge to surrender, but nonetheless it is not you to decide.  Further, how are you going to distinguish between situations where surrendering is allowed because it is one-sided and the balanced ones?"
vainglorygame,3ap067,KarmaAdjuster,0,Mon Jun 22 14:08:30 2015 UTC,"I would say that it's forcing everyone to be good sports about the game. Although I do think that forcing that level of sportsmanship is a little extreme.  I would argue that there's a net loss of fun by surrendering before the crystal is destroyed. A loss is still a loss, and I don't think you're saving yourself that much pain by surrendering a few seconds before the match is over. However, it's very satisfying for the other team to destroy the crystal, and there's even the possibility for some post match revenge killing on both teams.  All that said, players should still have the option to surrender and remove that last bit of fun from the game if they feel they can't tolerate it. It's just a shame that not everyone can be a good loser."
vainglorygame,3ap067,RaifetheRenegade,2,Mon Jun 22 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"Of course, this is assuming everyone in the game feels the same way you do. In some people's minds it may just be a matter of effencieny. Surrending may lead them to their next match quicker. Regardless I don't agree with a blanket statement saying that all players who don't let you destroy their Vain are bad sports."

vainglorygame,3aoz8a,JekyllMD,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:14:13 2015 UTC,"There's some good tutorials on YouTube on what it is and how to kite. In words, kiting is attacking an enemy and running from them all at the same time. Pretty much any ranged champ with a slow on their attacks can do this and once you learn how to stutter step it can be used to devastation. Melees can kite, but it isn't anything like what ranged can do. Ringo is the best at this IMO"

vainglorygame,3aoi3t,sheridch,2,Mon Jun 22 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"You can probably play everyone as a tank, but it does not make sense for every hero.  Looking at the overall package the game has given to Saw, I don't think that he would be a good tank. You will do have the surprise effect, when you are playing against a team that rarely looks at the scoreboard. I mean, it is basically instinct that you attack a Saw first, when there is one in the enemy team.  But his slowing perk is not really helpful. The increase fire rate might be sexy with Bonesaw, but then you are pretty much useless against an Atlas. His A might be a good finisher, but if this is what your Saw is focusing on then why play tank? Roadie Run is also good for running away, but yeah.. not really helpful. His B is okay. AOE with slow. Only helping when the enemy team is maybe chasing your team or the other way around. But after using your B in that scenario, Saw is either too slow to follow the crowd or he is forced to use his A. His Ult has AOE but probably no damage. You can look flashy with the awesome skins but that's about it."

vainglorygame,3aoi3t,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Its possible, but if it were ""viable"" then somebody would be doing it already.  Would have to recommend a breaking point then all tank items so at least you can build damage if not being focused.  Thing is you really only have one move (suppressing fire) that has any utility to your team and you are immobile so its hard for you to be there to support the team.  Better build would be to build serpents mask, sorrowblade then a couple defense items IMO.  You'd be tanky and could deal out a lot of damage"
vainglorygame,3aoi3t,neuken_inde_keuken,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"I've wanted to try him as a tank that just stands his ground and dishes out damage. That's kind of what he's built for, and it makes me wonder if an end game build with no boots could work on him. I was thinking of something like an Aegis, Metal Jacket, Sorrowblade, Serpent's Mask, Bonesaw, Breaking Point. The high armour and shield boosts the value of his lifesteal, and the high damage which scales up over time thanks to BP would make him pretty much unapproachable.  If the other team has no stuns I can't imagine how you would counter him, but goodluck trying to complete that build."

vainglorygame,3ao3fg,TeznaDZN,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:46:28 2015 UTC,Good idea
vainglorygame,3aocxj,MattDamonInSpace,5,Mon Jun 22 04:17:00 2015 UTC,It's definitely Weapon Power
vainglorygame,3aocxj,TheeNinjaBanana,2,Mon Jun 22 04:28:43 2015 UTC,It's weapon power. It also gets 15% pierce. It is added after crit.
vainglorygame,3aocxj,keldegar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:44:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's weapon, but it would be very easy to test in practice mode."
vainglorygame,3amj1f,calltothelostboys,7,Sun Jun 21 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"I think his ult is in a good place, though I would like to see his A scaling with additional HP- similar to ardan. This way he can play the role of protector while also being tanky. (CP Support adagio is much too squishy to actually charge into fights)"
vainglorygame,3amj1f,Jajajack14,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea, Adagios heal against sustain dmg and Ardans vanguard against burst. IMO only the heal over time should scale with HP."
vainglorygame,3amj1f,Ares-2,6,Mon Jun 22 02:05:42 2015 UTC,"I feel his abilities are good, all he needs is a better heal, which is really viable Late game"
vainglorygame,3amj1f,UniqueRaj,2,Sun Jun 21 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"He's the closest thing to a healer we have, and it's not the best healing ability, so I tend to agree."
vainglorygame,3amj1f,peterkeats,6,Mon Jun 22 02:57:34 2015 UTC,"Make the A heal % of life pool like the Fountain, and let it scale up with crystal, instead of a set number and give the snare effect for all friendly heroes, not just adagio.  Make the B apply a ""thorns"" style buff that reflects % of damage received (while keeping its current damage add).  Reduce animation timer on C.  Fin"
vainglorygame,3amj1f,inkwell84,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:58:25 2015 UTC,Fountain doesn't heal %. The amount it heals is based off of the % health you're missing (2 per missing % health per second).
vainglorygame,3amj1f,MrTouchnGo,3,Sun Jun 21 19:40:15 2015 UTC,I agree. Maybe shorten the channeling time on his ult by a bit.
vainglorygame,3amj1f,majorlaxer,2,Sun Jun 21 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this, in my opinion his ultimate is the most balanced part about him. A well-timed Gift of Fire on himself can slow and trap enemies. Besides, a Crucible can seriously mess him up."
vainglorygame,3amj1f,autism-lord,3,Mon Jun 22 03:36:20 2015 UTC,He needs to be a SUPPORT. I'm tired of WP adagio. He had everything. His ULT should be super short build but do almost no damage. A simple stun mechanic. Then his WP should be nerfed even more. Followed by his heal greatly improved.  I want to see the support adagio that he should of been from day one. Not this WP crap.
vainglorygame,3amj1f,eh-blank-space,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"He's actually very strong, just not in the current meta.  Basically he was really good when 2v2 jungle Skirmish was SUPER heavy after triple invade.  He did more than Ardan level 1 so that was abused.   Now Catherine is top tier because we're relying on CC to stop Joule/Taka. And Fortress is better for Skirmish in 90% of fights.  If they buff heal a bit and this new Hero turns out to be a hero who scales well with Attack Speed, we can see Adagio return as a strong pick."
vainglorygame,3amj1f,fmaBlots,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"Adagio used to be scary, I never figured out how to play him though.  Out of my hundreds of game I probably played him twice.  I barely see him in games anymore, so if he gets buffed I'm screwed because I know nothing of him."

vainglorygame,3aomd8,solid77,-1,Mon Jun 22 09:18:49 2015 UTC,if you're looking to climb play the ops. that's the best way to climb and not have to worry about learning the ins and outs of a more complex hero.
vainglorygame,3aomd8,MrTouchnGo,0,Mon Jun 22 09:19:31 2015 UTC,it also can be the best way to lose tier when the next patch comes out and the hero gets nerfed and the player no longer has a op hero to play to artificially inflate their elo. i saw quite a few players on my friends list sink a full skill tier that played the op skaarf and now they can't climb back up.
vainglorygame,3aomd8,Jajajack14,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:18:33 2015 UTC,There's always going to be an OP hero.

vainglorygame,3apml0,treboR-,7,Mon Jun 22 14:01:48 2015 UTC,Someone asking for a Petal 1.5 nerf. That's something you don't hear everyday.
vainglorygame,3apml0,_DelGriffith_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:15:48 2015 UTC,It's not really a nerf. I mean it should be something that shouldn't happen. I would like it fixed since they are about to buff her next patch and this abused with whatever buffs she may possibly receive will make her become a turret shredder.
vainglorygame,3apml0,Come_on-Man,3,Mon Jun 22 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"I always hated it the other way around...I think it changed one or two patches ago.  Munions actually take agro from the turrets now, which is amazing because that's what they are built for.  I questioned why the Munions didn't.  For how weak Petal is now it's a small upside.  By no means is she op (yet), look how janky her Heroic perk is.  Also, soloing he Kraken with Petal takes forever - It's not like Joule or Krul who can murder him in under 30 seconds."
vainglorygame,3apml0,Come_on-Man,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"She honestly isn't as bad as people think. If you do a tornado trigger, sorrow blade and are good at stutter stepping, it's gg. She is insane with a breaking point also, just add a crucible and Shiversteel and your just destroying teams. It just sucks that she gets destroyed so easily."
vainglorygame,3apml0,WSBowman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Petal was my main for months until Vox and Celeste came out.  WP petal was insane.  But now, you are right she is soft.  I haven't had any luck with WP petal at the moment, Celeste, Vox and Joule are killing me in the lane and Jungle Petal is just not that viable anymore.  Hopefully she will be amazing again in the next update."
vainglorygame,3apml0,nvrslnc,5,Mon Jun 22 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, Petal has always been this way and this simply part of her kit. The Kraken attacks her munions in leu of her as well."
vainglorygame,3apml0,nvrslnc,-6,Mon Jun 22 14:05:36 2015 UTC,I'd just prefer if it wasn't even a part of her kit. It's a bit OP that she can solo Turrets and Kraken. Without taking damage.
vainglorygame,3apml0,nvrslnc,3,Mon Jun 22 14:16:08 2015 UTC,Is it really OP? There are several heroes who can solo Turrets and Kraken at a certain point of time. Think of it as one of Petal's ability since her A is basically just a preparation for her B.
vainglorygame,3apml0,adyendrus,0,Mon Jun 22 14:24:12 2015 UTC,"I think of it like that. I mean regardless, Krul still can die while soloing turrets. I just don't like how she doesn't even need to take the hits at all since in all other situations, a hero will have to tank it while being hit."
vainglorygame,3apml0,KingQuet90,3,Mon Jun 22 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah but is this really OP? I mean, something being OP and gamebreaking are heavy things.  There are a lot of things what only certain heroes can do. This makes the heroes unique and distinguishes them from others. But that is part of the game and probably not OP.  You might play a hero because of this property and your enemy has to find the right answer for this."
vainglorygame,3apml0,peterkeats,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:31:20 2015 UTC,Hence why I wrote possibly Gamebreaking in the title. Try it out for yourself in single player with a decent build then try it without. You'll see how fast you destroy the vain compared to waiting for minions.
vainglorygame,3apml0,KingQuet90,2,Mon Jun 22 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"I can do a lot of things in practice mode. Doesn't mean I can do the same stuff in competetive play.   People know that Petal is somehow safe from turret shots and Kraken aggro. Similarly they know that Krul can solo Kraken and sometimes turrets. It is part of the game that you prevent it as the opposing team and build strategies such that these things don't happen.  It is not OP and it is not broken at all. Nobody exploits this mechanics, not because they didn't till you have mentioned it, but because it is not really easy to exploit."

This is why you shouldn't give it, cause when never know when a team will just throw the game.  Also you guys had a huge advantage over the krul, not sure if you realized it, but the kiting potential between your vox and ringo, combined with your slow from the wolves should bring down krul fairly quickly. If krul can't auto attack, then he's pretty squishy.   Lastly, for anyone faced with the same scenario of vox and ringo in lane, either one of those should've dropped down into the jungle carry role. Both of them do pretty well in jungle, specially against a krul since they can keep distance from him fairly easily.  In the end, you guys won cause you didn't give up, and they lost probably because they got complacent and thought it would be an easy win so congrats :)  Also, one correction, you said life spring a couple of times, I think you meant fountain of renewal. The life spring is the tier2 item that builds into a fountain."

I don't think they need to give them less Elo, just take away less Elo from a soloQ team if they lose. Once 1.6 comes out and you can visually see your loss/gain I think these issues will resolve themselves.  When you get steamrolled and see you didn't actually lose a lot of Elo for it, you wouldn't feel bad about the loss and focus on the positive, which is that you can learn their strategies and techniques and implement them in your games."
vainglorygame,3amomj,Glory_DrEvil,4,Sun Jun 21 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"The system already prioritizes party vs. party matches. You only match against a party if another party isn't up.

vainglorygame,3amomj,Tsar_MapleVG,6,Sun Jun 21 19:21:32 2015 UTC,I agree. The only time I get mad is when it forces a match that's 2 tiers above you.

vainglorygame,3ajri2,treboR-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:12:28 2015 UTC,Taka has a steep learning curve and really is not a 'free to play' type of character to me.
vainglorygame,3ajri2,DeafSmithVG,4,Sun Jun 21 17:46:31 2015 UTC,This is why I don't feel bad about dodging.  If I get an auto locker I just don't play the game and go do something else.

No, I will not deal with that today."
vainglorygame,3ajri2,WSBowman,2,Sat Jun 20 21:59:37 2015 UTC,Don't you get penalized for dodging?
vainglorygame,3ajri2,ScrewTheMoose,5,Sat Jun 20 23:53:30 2015 UTC,You lose one minute cool down and another one or two requeueing. Compare this to wasting at best fifteen in a game like the OP described.  I know which I consider more of a punishment.
vainglorygame,3ajri2,SleepyHarry,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"It actually goes from 1 minute up to 5, 10, and then 30 minute cooldowns for consecutive dodges.  By consecutive, I think you have to play 2 or 3 games in a row without ""dodging"" (that also includes cancelling queue right before 2:57 and not hitting ""accept"" on matchmaking).  It might not even reset until the next day."
vainglorygame,3ajri2,muriouskind,6,Sun Jun 21 03:11:37 2015 UTC,First time I hear about cancelling queue before 2:57 being counted as a dodge.. You sure about that?

vainglorygame,3ajri2,nyadav,2,Mon Jun 22 17:21:27 2015 UTC,Probably but unfortunately I only had time for one game this afternoon. I believe all that happened is that I had a minute then 2 minute cool down.

vainglorygame,3ajri2,SizeNine,3,Sun Jun 21 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"To complete MacRizzo's explanation, I'll just add that it's not recommended. Maybe under extreme circumstances but then again.. I've played >600 games and never felt compelled to dodge.  It's penalized by an increasing ""time out"" and it ""wastes"" other people's time. If you decide to not lock in a hero, everybody has to wait 1:30 for the game to be cancelled then requeue and hope the second game won't get dodged."
vainglorygame,3ajri2,glStelar,4,Sun Jun 21 05:09:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, it isn't something commendable but I've begun to reason that I would rather waste the autolocker's 1:30 and save myself and the other considerate non-autolocker from 15-30 minutes of our time being wasted. I'm just so frustrated and fed up dealing with people as described by OP: pinging like crazy and being toxic towards others AFTER they've just started the match by being inconsiderate and selfish."

vainglorygame,3ajri2,BradChmielewski,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:25:34 2015 UTC,I always auto lock Krul. Am I a bad person?  He's my favorite and I'm not really that great at other characters.
vainglorygame,3ajri2,NOAHCONSTRICT0R,3,Sun Jun 21 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"Not a bad person, but you aren't being a considerate teammate. Branch out to try other characters that will fit the team composition. You can always soft-select Krul and play him if he fits well, but you'll have a lot more success if you understand how all the characters work better by having played them, and you will likely win a lot more games with a balanced team."
vainglorygame,3ajri2,Zaggaz,2,Sun Jun 21 16:31:18 2015 UTC,Man but I just really like Krul and his play style. Plus I really want that skin. I do like ringo too. Just not a whole ton of time to play and learn every character and play style I guess
vainglorygame,3ajri2,NOAHCONSTRICT0R,3,Sun Jun 21 16:47:33 2015 UTC,You can get his skin even without playing him. Try just soft locking him from now on. Odds are people will let you select him.
vainglorygame,3ajri2,peterkeats,2,Sun Jun 21 16:55:19 2015 UTC,Cool thanks for the tip
vainglorygame,3ajri2,NOAHCONSTRICT0R,3,Sun Jun 21 16:57:25 2015 UTC,Only way you'll get better at the game is if you understand as many heroes as possible. If you learn how to play a hero well you also now how to play against that hero nom sayin?

vainglorygame,3ajy6c,Jajajack14,3,Sat Jun 20 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"This is a good idea. Similar to the way valve handles holidays with TF2. SEMC should jump on this right away. Halloween resonates with gamers so there should be enough time to plan and implement something like this.  And  then be rolling it out with ease each holiday.   I can see new catch phrases for Petal at easter time like, ""And you thought the Easter bunny wasnt real"". Or  maybe a Krul  Santa Claus heavy-metal costume with the catch phrase, ""you've been very naughty"".     i'm thinking maybe a Halloween costume for Taka could be Koshka default costume  with the catch phrase ""tell koshka to stop calling me""  or maybe ""what, you never lost a bet?"".   or another good skin might be a Heavy like skin (from TF2) for saw and something about Vegemite sandwiches as a catchphrase  celeste naturally lends herself towards the classic stereotype witch costume and maybe a catchphrase like Im quite a witch, arent I?"

vainglorygame,3ai6om,_matrix,7,Mon Jun 22 02:41:33 2015 UTC,I mostly play catherine or glaive. Both in support role. I just line to help my team with some healing and protection.
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Lensjo,8,Sat Jun 20 12:34:29 2015 UTC,Bless you. Not nearly enough willing support players in the Fold!
vainglorygame,3ai6om,WSBowman,2,Sat Jun 20 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"lol, i don't mind, then i can always play the char i like :D"
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Lensjo,4,Sun Jun 21 11:24:04 2015 UTC,As support I've fallen in love with Ardo but unfortunately he's WAY out if the meta and I've discovered how awesome and fun to play fortress is!
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Lebrontasaurus,5,Sat Jun 20 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"Jungle WP glaive, i love the cleave damage and his afterburn!"
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Malgus234,5,Sat Jun 20 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"I love Petal; there's something about a creature so cute killing heroes that appeals to me.  I don't play her much because she's pretty much never the best option for anything now, which is sad.  I also really like Joule and Fortress.  I have my highest win rate playing Fortress, but I used to play Joule a lot even before the buff just because I think she's a really cool hero with neat skills and cool looking animations.  I'll miss her when they destroy her in 1.6 to quiet all the whining, just like I miss Petal now.  :("
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Natras,4,Sat Jun 20 15:37:10 2015 UTC,My favourite character is Catherine as support. It's so much fun to support my team and beeing almost invincible at the same time with her huge versatility. You can just mess so much with the enemy team with her.
vainglorygame,3ai6om,neurotoxicguitar,5,Sat Jun 20 14:35:22 2015 UTC,"I was a Skaarf main, even before the OP support Skaarf era. Now, after his compete nerf, I enjoy playing Celeste. My A skill with a clockwork is a lot of fun. I enjoy having a stun. I LOVE sniping with my global ult.   Just please stop targeting me haha"
vainglorygame,3ai6om,NespreSilver,3,Sat Jun 20 15:02:34 2015 UTC,"Jungle carry Taka or CP support Joule. Skaarf can be fun to play, but I tend to be a little skittish with him since he's so squishy.  Back when Skaar was OP Burnanator it was entertaining to watch the other team run around on fire while the real carry decimated them."
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Twiggled,3,Sat Jun 20 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much an exclusive Cath support, it's like the only hero I can play  I'll play jungle Krul or CP ringo in lane if the situation is really dire though"
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Okami_G,3,Sat Jun 20 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"I play either a support Glaive or a non-bursty Taka. I love Glaive because I love being able to kill enemies and protect teammates in equal measure, also because it's super fun to bat people around and interrupt ults. As for Taka, I love juking with Kaku and love being able to run alongside an enemy, dealing more and more damage as we go."
vainglorygame,3ai6om,WSBowman,2,Sat Jun 20 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"I prefer to carry in the Jungle but have started to gain confidence in the Lane. Respectively, I prefer Taka, Vox, Krul, Joule, And Ringo as carries and either Adagio or Glaive for support. Taka is my far and above favorite. He was the first hero I ever played and continues to facilitate my favorite play style. It's tons of fun dancing around skillshot heroes like Joule and Celeste while they frantically try to keep you away from them."
vainglorygame,3ai6om,dankreefingbud,2,Sat Jun 20 15:17:51 2015 UTC,My favorite hero and imo one of the most fun heroes in this or Dota is koshka. She is the best jungler and the sickest carry
vainglorygame,3ai6om,ReamusLQ,2,Sat Jun 20 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"My favorite is AD/Lane carry, but I usually have more fun playing a support because then I know my team will have a good support and protector :P I win more when playing as a support than anything else."
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Quezno11,2,Sat Jun 20 17:17:35 2015 UTC,Every couple weeks I have a new favorite.
vainglorygame,3ai6om,hardendapaint,2,Sat Jun 20 19:04:08 2015 UTC,I've been able to have great games as a lane CP ringo. So much fun to go 1v1 against other laners and surprise them with crystal damage
vainglorygame,3ai6om,asamr,2,Sun Jun 21 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"My favourite hero is definitely Vox!  I love his skills, excellent later!  But i have managed to master Saw and Catherine is well!  /met0ri"

Krul is second for his good offense and sustainability.   I used to play Koshka exclusively, before and after buffs and nerfs. Now she is too squishy for my (risk loving) playstyle."

I'm not familiar with these types of games, so I'm doing as much reading to learn as possible.  I'm playing exclusively with Cath to learn the character and game as much as possible.  I really enjoy being a support, especially if I have an experienced player to help, but I will take a nit of a lead if it's clear the other players on my team are a bit scattered.  I plan on moving through each character, reading, learning, and practicing with each until I'm familiar with all of them.  That will help so I can choose a character that will best help whatever characters my team chooses."
vainglorygame,3ai6om,Quezno11,2,Sat Jun 20 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"Catherine was my first and still favorite hero. If you're new to MOBA, make sure to watch Twitch streams and listen to The Fold. It helped me greatly."

Lane is just so much fun and with his ult and his abilities sniping players is sooo fun. And Taka still gets hit when he hides by Ringo's ult! Hence the love
vainglorygame,3ai6om,jatatcdc,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:14:49 2015 UTC,I've been playing fortress as my main lately. 90% of the time it gets everyone to work as a team. He can control the fold and assist so much. Defiantly one of my favorite heroes. I usually go to saw if the jungle and support are full
vainglorygame,3ai6om,setchy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"I have respect for support players. I used to be a main thresh on LoL and I realized that supporting in this game is not my cup of tea.  That being said, lane and jungle are my roles.

This is what I gather from logic, I haven't gotten to reading the lore. So I might be wrong on the role, but what I know is that they're family."
vainglorygame,3ai1jr,cestislife,4,Sat Jun 20 11:10:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's what I get for not reading the lore lol. That's pretty cool, making some heroes family members."

vainglorygame,3ajira,plybianz,3,Sun Jun 21 03:09:35 2015 UTC,Petition to name them bunnies and eggs
vainglorygame,3ajira,Lebrontasaurus,6,Sun Jun 21 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"Just have to point out that specials are actually called abilities, eggs are seeds, and bunnies are munions. As for most of these tips, most are known. The only tip you mentioned that no one uses is the one about using SAW in the jungle. SAW is not a jungler, because he's too slow at clearing jungle camps. He's a pure laner, so they stay out of the jungle unless your team is trying to capture the Kraken."
vainglorygame,3ajira,JekyllMD,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:14:29 2015 UTC,"You are right about the bunnies, however I wish SEMC would make an Easter themed petal that dropped eggs out of her basket and the turned into bunnies.

vainglorygame,3ajira,g1w,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"I would prefer for it not to be a tier 3 skin. However, it would be cool to make holiday themed skins that unlock on the holiday."

vainglorygame,3ag739,Lebrontasaurus,3,Sat Jun 20 01:31:59 2015 UTC,Alright I personally am not a huge Catherine fan but that tier one skin is so cool. Reminds me of the gold armor they wear in Thor!

vainglorygame,3ag739,Natras,3,Sat Jun 20 03:25:27 2015 UTC,Finally! A skin for my favourite hero. You guys rock SEMC!
vainglorygame,3ag739,lcpdragonslayer,5,Sat Jun 20 10:28:53 2015 UTC,"I love this skin and I'm going to buy it when it comes out. That said, her waist looks disturbingly tiny even for a corset-style look. I'm sure us female players are in the minority and Catherine is already semi-sexualised but a slightly anorexic look is slightly perturbing in a way that white uniform and cleavage isn't.   Anyway it's no big deal in-game since you don't get the same level of detail in the concept art. I'm glad she's not been reduced to a Victoria's Secret poster girl."
vainglorygame,3ag739,Peter_Rotten,3,Sat Jun 20 11:59:49 2015 UTC,"Catherine does look like her waif-foo is strong.  But most of the characters are beefcakes or beauties with exaggerated proportions (Ardan, Koska, Glaive, Ringo, Saw).  But that new barbarian, though, breaks the hour-glass-figure-mold, doesn't she?  And Vox and Taka aren't your traditional He-Man builds.  And Celeste isn't that bad, right?"
vainglorygame,3ag739,lcpdragonslayer,2,Sat Jun 20 13:14:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely. I just thought I'd nitpick on the Catherine skin since we're on that topic but other characters deserve attention and commendation too. I'd seen some other threads about whitewashing and the overly muscular boys or the bishounen prettyboy look and whatnot. Sure it's just a game and everyone is going to be good looking or skinny or buff or whatever, but you could say ""it's just a ..."" for most of the media we're exposed to."

vainglorygame,3ahh2e,eh-blank-space,6,Sat Jun 20 05:36:53 2015 UTC,Chamelon/octopus skin taka. When this skin is on. taka will change his colors similar to his surroundings. Similar to the MGS4 camo suit.  I think x retsu has a lot of potential to play around with   A full on partical black taka would be cool. Except I'd do away with the box. The second you press his B the cloud shaped taka would instantly disappear and you turn into semi translucent particles. The smoke monster from LOST would be a good inspiration

vainglorygame,3ajkkx,Laugh_ing,5,Sat Jun 20 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"After update 1.6, you'll need karma level 10 to play in the ranked queue, and thumbing people down for afking will make them lose karma."
vainglorygame,3ajkkx,Twiggled,10,Sat Jun 20 20:54:16 2015 UTC,I understand the frustration of the occasional AFK/Disconnected player. Unfortunately even someone at karma 20 doesn't guarantee something bad won't happen causing them to have to AFK. Just remember at the end of the day it's just a game and to have fun with it win or lose!
vainglorygame,3ajkkx,i_make_doors,5,Sat Jun 20 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"First of all... Have fun, win or lose. If you only have fun when you win you're missing out on half of the fun ;) (since 50% of your games will be losses when you reach your true skill tier)  Unfortunately it's impossible to completely prevent AFKs ever happening. Trying to do so a lot more harshly than the system currently in place (e.g. banning after 1-2 afk's) would probably decimate the player base (like really).  That Vox may very well have been at 20 karma also, and his device just died. If he afk's too often (and the threshold is small I think) he gets put temporarily in a separate queue.  It sucks that it happened in a game you were very invested in.. But IMO the best thing to do in that situation is to hi-five your remaining teammate with a beer and either play it out or move on to the next game.   Edit: Btw, temporary bans are in place (separate deserter queue), i think it just takes more than one afk to trigger (i think it starts at 2, maybe not even consecutive)"
vainglorygame,3ajkkx,glStelar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:28:50 2015 UTC,If a player leaves early into the game and joins back towards the end does the game register they went afk? I had a player do that and his name wasn't crossed out or anything. Look into this devs

vainglorygame,3af05o,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"That's too funny.   Question- if you weren't in range of the minions to see the enemy attacking you, would they have still gone for the enemy or the crystal?  If they don't see you being attacked and they go for the crystal instead of the enemy, maybe this could be your tactic. ;)"
vainglorygame,3agxru,PYKNICS,2,Sat Jun 20 02:05:03 2015 UTC,"Generally no, but it's situational. IGC only costs 150 gold after you sell it back, and could pay for itself in 1-2 rotations of going up to lane for a gank (while you wait in the bush). I might consider getting it as jungle carry if I'm playing someone like Krul or Glaive who are really good at lane ganks, then selling it back later.  Wouldn't get it as first item though, but likely would if I see that the enemy laner is overextending."
vainglorygame,3agxru,Twiggled,2,Sat Jun 20 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I suppose it's terrible for initial triple invade purposes, but I sort of love double IGC otherwise.  You clear jungle and invade faster if both of the junglers are free to hit away.  I was on the wrong side of a blowout in which the entire other team started with the same items, IGC and two potions.  They triple invaded, killing my Krul and my Fortress teammate, then popped up to the lane to triple team our Vox.  Oh, and stole the entire first wave of jungle monsters.  The entire game they stayed clustered together, whether they were killing jungle monsters or lane minions.  It was like my team was a group of fluffy bunny rabbits being fed into a wood chipper.  I remember that match fondly, though.  A team working together in unison can really dominate."
vainglorygame,3agxru,teddim,2,Sat Jun 20 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"Totally makes sense, I never factored in the speed in which we can clear the jungle lets us setup for ganks more often. Thanks for shedding some light, much appreciated."
vainglorygame,3agxru,Twiggled,2,Sat Jun 20 02:27:43 2015 UTC,Double IGC doesn't actually increase the jungle speed though. Since 1.5 (even more so than before) it is completely useless to get two contracts if you're aware of how the item works.
vainglorygame,3agxru,jklick,3,Sat Jun 20 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"It can. What he was saying is that when only the support takes an IGC, kills are slower because the support stops attacking to let the jungle carry take the last hit. If the synergy isn't that great, it's likely the support will stop attacking sooner than necessary leading to slower kills. If both people get it, then you can be a bit more carefree without wasting any gold."
vainglorygame,3agxru,peterkeats,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but probably not. Two reasons:   A good IGC holder will typically start making his way to the next jungle camp before the last jungle creep is dead and start on the next camp. In other words, he's not sitting on his hands or slowing down the jungle clear.  When the jungle carry purchases an offensive item (e.g. weapon blade, swift shooter, or crystal bit), this speeds up the jungle clear, oftentimes significantly."
vainglorygame,3agxru,peterkeats,2,Sun Jun 21 12:01:34 2015 UTC,"You were probably playing a party, which can have the advantage over solo queballs any day. There were also probably smurfs on the team. When this happens, run away fast, don't fight, and sneak into their camp. Ping a Go to their camp to invite your jungle buddy."
vainglorygame,3agxru,ShinakoX2,3,Sat Jun 20 02:29:12 2015 UTC,"Tbh I have only ran solo, I'm too nervous to party with people. I know what I'm doing but I'm afraid to let people down, and from what I've learned from reddit - performance is everything."

I even added the opponents and none of them were premades..."
vainglorygame,3agxru,melbtown,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:20:23 2015 UTC,"The support should get the IGC and give all last hits to his jungler. But many players don't know how to use the IGC. Some junglers want to get gold, even if the support is stealing farm or if they wait in lane for a gank. It's not perfect, but you can buy it, if you think that the IGC will give you more than 300gold."
vainglorygame,3aebz0,An0therk,-1,Fri Jun 19 12:50:49 2015 UTC,"I actually think it would be a lot more detrimental to the game. If I am solo queueing in higher tiers and I see that the other team is a party I might assume that they have an advantage and give up a lot sooner, or one of my team mates could consider it hard match.  What I would like is separate party queue. You should have an option to not get matched against a party if you are solo queueing. There should be an option where you CAN try to solo against parties. This wouldnt matter much in casual mode, but it would really help in Ranked Mode."
vainglorygame,3aebz0,__init__2nd_user,12,Fri Jun 19 13:40:10 2015 UTC,That's why OP said that we should be informed After the match is over.

vainglorygame,3aebz0,__init__2nd_user,4,Fri Jun 19 15:54:40 2015 UTC,Not if you are partying yourself. You either risk players with random players or have a good player on your team.  Party should be matched with party. Solo should be matched with Solo unless the player selects otherwise.

vainglorygame,3aegjd,VATigerfan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:32:55 2015 UTC,Couldn't you just create a nerf account like everybody else?
vainglorygame,3aegjd,stakkar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"I guess.  But then he'd have to remember passwords/login info.  I've never played a smurf account or really been worried about my skill tier and I only do solo queue (no parties).  Although I might start.  I just played an infuriating match (hotness bronze) where I switched from a soft locked krul to catherine after my teammates locked SAW/Joule.  Joule proceeded to race to all the minions attacking them before I could there to initiate/IGC.  He didn't get it even tho I kept praising him with happy pings the times I got there first, and sad/avoid pinged him when he got it wrong.  I ended up going 5/4/14 and was able to grind out a win thanks to the overpowered big red button.  At least the Joule knew to launch that right after I went in for the stun and we'd get kills every time.  It's just infuriating when people don't understand IGC.  I don't even know why I'm ranting about this to you.  But I feel better now."
vainglorygame,3aegjd,VATigerfan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:10:21 2015 UTC,"Haha it's all good. I'm in the same mindset as you. I don't have a nerf account and think it's dumb for people to. What do you actually accomplish by beating up on weaker players?  I get much more satisfaction by playing a great match against similar skill levels. If I win great, if not it's not the end of the world. I think people care way too much about their ranking. I got stuck in PG hell for a long time but instead of bitching (like most on here) or creating a nerf account to make myself feel better I just learned to play better and I worked my way up. Currently I'm in SA silver and I think I've plateaued. Eventually I hope to work my way up to POA. If not than I will have countless hours of good gaming against people of similar skill levels. Not like ranking up is going to get you paid or something. People take this way too seriously sometimes. There's no end game where you beat the game or anything or SEMC crowns you ultimate champion. The whole point is to play individual matches and have fun playing them."
vainglorygame,3aegjd,teddim,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:39:28 2015 UTC,This here is exactly the reason why they won't give you such an option.
vainglorygame,3aegjd,teddim,2,Sat Jun 20 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure they won't, as the current matchmaking is already ranked. The biggest difference is that we just don't have a casual queue yet."
vainglorygame,3aegjd,Twiggled,2,Fri Jun 19 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know then how casual queue will work for new players? Since they all start in ask again later, does that mean all their games will be in the bottom tier until ranked games are unlocked?"
vainglorygame,3aegjd,Malgus234,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:50:36 2015 UTC,Casual will have to have some form of separating players based on skill. Other wise Vainglorious players would put in matches with new players.
vainglorygame,3afpkf,FinndBors,6,Fri Jun 19 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"People always complain about the thumbs down doing nothing, but it seems to me that there is one obvious, simple use for it that would be easy for the devs to implement.  I was curious if giving someone the thumbs down for trolling would prevent you from being teamed with them again.  It seems like an obvious counterpart to the friending option; clearly the database is able to maintain relationships between accounts so that it knows who I like.  Why wouldn't they configure the opposite, I wondered, maintaining a list of folks I've thumbed down for being toxic/trolling types to not pair me with.  Call it an enemy relationship in the database, opposite of the friend relationship and use it to avoid matching me up again.  I started keeping a list, only putting the douchiest douchenozzles on it, to see.  Yesterday I had my answer--the matchmaking system, it turns out, will happily pair you up with the guy you thumbed down for being the worst troll you ever played with.  Keeping the paper list paid off, though, as it was totally worth it to queue dodge having another game with ip******, as he was an epic douchenozzle indeed.  IMO, having the game maintain relationships not just for your friends list, but for your enemies list (via the existing thumbs down for trolling) would be a great feature.  I don't see how you could abuse it; at worst you'd thumbs down everyone and eventually not be able to get matched up as quickly as other folks (and the game already screws you with the 2:57 garbage, so it could just ignore your enemies list if it had to to make an urgent match).  What do you think?"
vainglorygame,3afpkf,FinndBors,3,Fri Jun 19 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"First I thought it was a good idea because trolls couldn't exploit it to downvote normal players, but then I realized that if you do this people will start downvoting people that didn't play well in their opinion. I don't think that would be a positive thing."
vainglorygame,3afpkf,xmaveric,3,Fri Jun 19 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know; does it really matter why someone doesn't want to play with someone else?    Also, like I said, the game is already willing to shaft you when someone hits 2:57 (oh, this PoA organized team that's chatting on skype needs a match, here let's give them this group of fluffy kittens, two of whom are blind and the other of which is prone to seizures) so it could always ignore your preferences and give you someone you marked as someone you didn't want to see again."
vainglorygame,3afpkf,Zaggaz,3,Fri Jun 19 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"Well if it is to a point where people do it often rather than once in a blue moon, the matchmaking will become absolute shit due to a ton more constraints.  IMO, if someone plays poorly, it doesn't make sense to blacklist them or even get pissed at them. It could be unfortunate matchmaking, someone having a bad day, someone derping, trying a new hero or any combination of the above. A good percentage of the raging done here on reddit is because of ""poor teammates"" instead of toxicity."

While playing against bots, I had my  CP Joule build  almost done (2 SG, BM) and of course the bots had nothing built.   I found Catherine in the jungle and decided to ult her. She was level 9, I was 12. She popped her bubble before I ulted and I lost nearly 3/4 of my health and she had 1/2 of her own left. Without any crystal items to bounce off my damage or any defense items.   Try out Catherine if you're getting pissy at Joule."
vainglorygame,3aegva,Tsar_MapleVG,7,Fri Jun 19 18:07:45 2015 UTC,Cath is amazing against her.

vainglorygame,3aegva,dudethisis,2,Fri Jun 19 14:20:25 2015 UTC,There is a damage zone right on top of Joule and slightly behind and around her. The AOE range is very small but its there.

vainglorygame,3aegva,solid77,3,Fri Jun 19 14:51:06 2015 UTC,cp joule is op period. every vainglorious tier streamer has said the same thing.
vainglorygame,3aegva,dr3wd3zi,2,Fri Jun 19 20:34:09 2015 UTC,"Everyday there's at least one post on this board about Joule, and I understand her ultimate is pretty strong. But it is so simple to avoid. If you're matched against her and she's building crystal, then it should be automatic to build a reflex block and boots. Once the character hits level 6, know that she has the ability to fire any second. So keep those boots ready to escape. If she tries to stun you with a rocket leap before firing, better keep that reflex block handy. And if none of those options are available, simply walk out of it! Yes, you're gonna take a major hit. But you can still escape behind a turret and retreat back to base. I've had my fair share of experiences where she's melted my entire team, but that was entirely our fault. In most cases, she wasn't the primary target. And we didn't have stuns ready to prevent her from firing. Anyways, I'm getting tired of seeing these posts because they sound like a bunch of nagging and complaining. Learn to counter it or continue to melt in the fold.  Edit 1: Added and changed a few words.  Edit 2: Also, when the match goes into late game and you have to roam together try staying spread out in brushes. When team fights break out, don't group together. If you have the discipline to exercise these tips and everything stated above, then her BRB will no longer be that big of an issue."
vainglorygame,3aegva,JimBrownGOAT,2,Fri Jun 19 20:22:51 2015 UTC,"Oh please, don't nerf joule, I started playing two weeks ago, and it was the first hero I bought, I didn't knew it was so op, I just watched the spotlight and though ""man this is gonna be fun to play"", spent all my points and got it, gotta say has been a ""blast"" (see what I did there) playing with her. About the ulti, i think sometimes its really op, but sometimes it isn't, in every game I play I go cp joule in the lane, i farm really quick, get levels really quick, and unlock the ulti really quick, when u get the ulti and everyone in the other team is like level 3/4, yeah that will be gg, but in late game it isn't that op imo"
vainglorygame,3aegva,Treddy101,2,Fri Jun 19 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"My Problem with Joule is that while I feel confident enough to dodge her ult and only take a tick at max, I can't help my teammates dodge it, and I'm not going to win a 1v3."
vainglorygame,3aegva,Shrklgs,2,Sat Jun 20 01:09:55 2015 UTC,"Besides the basics of avoiding grouping or funneling into narrow passageways, there are easy ways to mitigate Joule. I play a lot of Krul and I love playing against a CP Joule how is BRB dependent. The key is to be extremely patient with you From Hells Heart. As soon as she hits it, chick that sword in her face. You'll still get melted a bit, but it should be enough to focus her down. Hopefully you have a fountain or two on your team. If you got one, pop it after the BRB. If you have two, pop one during the BRB and then one while trying to clean up the other two teammates. The fountain strategy takes team coordination, so may not be viable for solo queue but on a team it's doable."
vainglorygame,3aegva,Shrklgs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:21:22 2015 UTC,I play a lot of Krul too - maining him now.  I normally build Shiversteel first and then an aegis and dragon heart and sometimes its still not enough.
vainglorygame,3aegva,Sa10aep,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"Because of her insane CP ratio aegis doesn't protect enough and building health can be a waste. I build shiver steel on krul often too, but it really should be treated as an offensive item to keep people close enough to build stacks of Weakness on them. Interrupting the ult and then healing is really the only way avoid the power of the BRB. Having hells heart ready or some other stuns is crucial."
vainglorygame,3aegva,UniqueRaj,4,Mon Jun 22 17:04:20 2015 UTC,she is perfectly fine where she is imo. Enough with the calling of nerfing a player who fits the meta.
vainglorygame,3aegva,GrandpaSkitzo,6,Fri Jun 19 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"IMO, she is a bit overpowered, just a bit.   Her ult has so much crystal ratio, She can entirely delete a team even if they are building shields.   Yes everyone says don't stay in a line and dodge her ult etc, but honestly it's really hard to coordinate like that in soloQ and the beam fires so quickly you'll definitely get hit for 1 or 1.5 secs however fast you can be, and that's enough to delete your HP while her teammates finish you off.   And this can happen to EVERYONE in your team."
vainglorygame,3aegva,UniqueRaj,3,Fri Jun 19 14:00:14 2015 UTC,This EXACTLY what I've been experiencing.  I couldnt care about her first two abilities but her ult with a few shatter glasses is insane.

vainglorygame,3aegva,UniqueRaj,2,Fri Jun 19 14:07:57 2015 UTC,Shouldn't an ult be able to delete a carry when it's built properly?
vainglorygame,3aegva,ifixputers,4,Fri Jun 19 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Yes but.. If the carry spends some gold to get a defensive item (Aegis) while compromising more offensive items and still gets one shotted, something is definitely wrong.   Edit -  Also, it deletes the entire team"
vainglorygame,3aegva,Vet24,2,Fri Jun 19 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Actually on further thoughts an Ult shouldn't really be able to delete the entire enemy team (even the carry), it should do lots of damage, but not completely destroy them.

Personally I have found that if a CP joule knows what she is doing, then there is nothing you can do about it.  You work your ass off in the lane and build SBs, TMs, TTs, bonesaws, and you ultimately end up staring at your build when you are waiting to spawn again"
vainglorygame,3aegva,UniqueRaj,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"Celeste? VGL games have many games where Joule is handled fine. They are aware of Joule positioning to avoid getting lined up. They have stuns ready.   It sounds like Joule will be nerfed, but a lot of what I've read suggests the damage will be shifted towards the later ticks. Also in VGL, note that Joule is often not banned. Often not banned and not picked."
vainglorygame,3aegva,i_make_doors,5,Sat Jun 20 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"If someone builds her CP, then they are pretty much relying on their ult. To do the ult requires a lot more skill than with other characters, so those who pull it off deserve it imo. Yes, when she is built for her ult and it comes off it is devastating, but it should be. The same can be said for Celeste's ult, which they did nerf, but if you build the same way, the same kind of damage can be done"

vainglorygame,3aegva,Sa10aep,0,Fri Jun 19 20:19:00 2015 UTC,Is that really how it goes for you? Because when i play Joule i do that probably 30% of the time and i am SA Bronze.

It's not like the BRB is a automated attack.   The only fix I would do is make it to where the first person hit takes 100% damage, 2nd hit takes 66% damage, and the 3rd takes 33% damage."

I play with my girlfriend too and it can be really frustrating for someone new to have to play against Hotness players.

There isn't any item recommendation due to the fact that it is just far too subjective. It would quite quickly be a source of discontent between teammates."
vainglorygame,3acl20,teddim,2,Sat Jun 20 01:14:04 2015 UTC,If you select Lane it doesn't mean youmre supposed to stand in lane 100% of the time; it means you're the one that wants to farm the lane minions and let a teammate farm the jungle minions. Having a Roam option only makes things overcomplicated.
vainglorygame,3acl20,SurpriseBirthdaySEMC,16,Fri Jun 19 02:38:01 2015 UTC,"Even if we implemented any kind of chat (voice or text) we would never enable it for communication between strangers. We've seen what happens in other MOBAs when this feature is enabled.  You think you'll tell someone to build defense and they'll happily oblige, but in reality they will give you the finger and curse you out for telling them what to do. On the internet, anonymous communication is a tool for rage and anger, not constructive criticism and coordination. For parties, on the other hand, we are actively working on new features. I suggest you start friending the good teammates, building a list of 50+ reliables so that 2 of them are online whenever you play."
vainglorygame,3acl20,RedHerringxx,3,Fri Jun 19 11:18:33 2015 UTC,Thank you! Someone who sees in-game chat between strangers for what it really is: a sure-fire way to introduce anonymous internet toxicity into a game. Glad to hear you're looking at improving party comms though.
vainglorygame,3acl20,SleepyHarry,2,Fri Jun 19 06:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think this is an excellent compromise, and I wholeheartedly agree with the idea."
vainglorygame,3acl20,Avenue745,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:42:56 2015 UTC,"How about a list of preset communications.    E.g ""iron guard contract?"" ""Support"" ""carry"" and then answers like ""me"" or ""I will"" ""yes"" ""no"" etc"
vainglorygame,3acl20,MrTouchnGo,2,Fri Jun 19 10:47:29 2015 UTC,"That's what pings are for. Granted, they're not super specific, but if you add too much in the way of communication to the game the screen will quickly become cluttered."
vainglorygame,3acl20,Avenue745,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:36:30 2015 UTC,"No ping can be a substitute to say IGC support or carry , even then it's difficult to say you will be doing something aswell"
vainglorygame,3acl20,MrTouchnGo,2,Fri Jun 19 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think an IGC ping would be useful, personally. If someone is going to ironguard or let you ironguard, there's no need for the ping. If they're not, well, they probably don't know how to use IGC properly, so the ping would be a waste then. Negotiating the valuable real estate vs. the value of a ping is something you have to consider. Is that particular ping worth making the screen more cluttered?"

vainglorygame,3acl20,oldboldmold,3,Fri Jun 19 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot like a post I made yesterday!  I agree with the pre-game communication, but I have to agree with SEMC's choice to to allow for voice chat in game. The potential for griefing is just way too high, and an obnoxious percentage of the current community is already hell bent on abusing the ping system.  That said, some sort of video explanation of how the ironguard contract works made easily accessible from within the game would be great.  Another thing that might be interesting is to allow other players to recommend items for teammates through the match details in game and shop UI. This idea just popped into my head so it is most certainly half baked, but there may be some merit to it."
vainglorygame,3acl20,wolf_hands,6,Fri Jun 19 23:39:03 2015 UTC,A way to recommend items to people when shopping would be excellent. I thought of it myself but it would be a bit difficult to implement.  Maybe have a thing where if you click fountain it shows up for your teamates and they say ok.
vainglorygame,3acl20,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe when you're in the shop to select items, you're allowed to select items to suggest for your teammates. They get a number showing how many items have been suggested on the shop button (or an exclamation mark or something) and when they go to the shop there could either a) be a tab for player suggested items or b) those items have a slight halo or other visual indicator to make them pop. Or you do both, because the redundancy would only make it easier to find.  You could also have some sort of ping to let teammates know if their suggestion was picked. Even if the person chose an item they would have built anyway, the positive reinforcement would strengthen morale and group cohesion.  Another thing that could work for this, is the option to select an item that you can't currently afford in order to alert your team to your build path, with some visual indicator showing your selection to your team when they're shopping. It could be a problem if it leads to more rigid approaches toward building, but it could also help if you want to indicate that you're building super tanky, or as a glass cannon, or weapon, or crystal, or hybrid."

Her skills had huge base damage and her heroic perk offered her a LOT of early game tank. She was literally the best jungler by leaps and bounds and could afford to build tank items and still dish out a ton of damage.  Since then, her base damage has been nerfed fairly significantly, and her heroic perk's defense boost has been removed. So she's much less viable now as a support than before."

And then building support I barely get to make any weapon item buys and then im way behind and do nothing in a team fight.

To you and OP: stop playing like your way to play is the only way. And for the love of God, don't be toxic when your teammates don't go along with you. Stop being smart by directing everyone what to do and where to go. It ain't helpin. Instead, adapt yourself to the situation. If someone is refusing to ironguard, go get it yourself or just jungle alone. Or go to lane and leech. There's a lot of options that don't include antagonizing your teammates."

I called the shots when I saw the opportunity, and my teammates followed up.  We aced them and stole Kraken, pushed hard, and even though they killed her at their Crystal turrets, wtf are they gonna do with 500g when they're full built? We just backed off, bought our own items, and we won a team fight in lane as they were pushing, then pushed for a win. Team-Comp: Full Crystal jungle Koskha, Full Weapon jungle Taka, and tanky support lane with clockwork and aftershock for max cooldown Glaive (me).  All I did was dash around the fight, sending tank flying away while ally-ooping their Skaarf into my teammates, and then shortly doing the same with their Taka. It's about using your creativity."

vainglorygame,3acdpv,Cacao_Cacao,-4,Fri Jun 19 15:57:54 2015 UTC,I think you're just wasting people's time refusing to surrender.  That's probably why those people hate you.

You always have a chance to come back, and even if you don't and they're at your crystal, surrendering forefits the hard fought glory bonus. Literally nothing to gain from surrendering. With an early afk, then it becomes reasonable- otherwise may as well give the other team the satisfaction of shattering it."

It is about the time spent waiting for me to see ""Defeat"". It is before that when I'm thinking about the game I just played. I think about my team and their actions in accordance to my actions. I couldn't care less about ""having a great game"". When I play, I'm playing to destroy that crystal but more importantly, prove to myself how good I am at this videogame. When you waste my 30 seconds, I am not thinking about hurrying to the play the next game, I'm thinking about you, OP.   I understand how you feel it is selfish to quit early and surrender (for the gratification of the crystal) but winners get their wins no matter what. When you choose to lose,however, is up to you. Your team wants to make the decision that's already in your head, but by choosing ""No"",I even call that as an insult to your teammates who you won't mercykill.   I know a Roman Solider would back me up with that statement too."
vainglorygame,3acdpv,MrTouchnGo,8,Fri Jun 19 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"Do you not feel annoyed when your enemy surrenders as you're rushing into their base? Do you not feel like you're missing out on the satisfaction of seeing their Vain explode into smithereens? Because I certainly do. That's why I don't surrender in the last 30 seconds. It's a waste, it doesn't change anything, and I think the opposing team deserves the satisfaction of blowing up my Vain. It's sportsmanship.  Losing sports teams don't throw in the towel when the last minute comes around, no matter how badly they're being thrashed. I don't see why I should, either."
vainglorygame,3acdpv,stakkar,-1,Fri Jun 19 00:20:56 2015 UTC,I'm just explaining why they're angry pinging you.  30 seconds over the course of 50 matches is the equivalent to a typical game.  It adds up!

vainglorygame,3ab3ud,joineanuu,11,Thu Jun 18 17:42:17 2015 UTC,PG is by far the hardest tier for matchmaking.

vainglorygame,3ab3ud,ShinakoX2,2,Thu Jun 18 22:08:05 2015 UTC,The Devi said there are at the moment due to smurfing no actual _skill_tiers in the lower tiers. It is more random and progressed to less random and towards the higher skill tiers only it is devided by skill.
vainglorygame,3ab3ud,theSDRexperiment,14,Fri Jun 19 12:09:27 2015 UTC,"Last night we had a Kraken waltz into our base and destroy both of our last two remaining Vain crystal turrets before we took it down. The enemy team had a Joule and a Glaive. We knew they would come to jump our base wall. Instead, they unleashed another Kraken, one we definitely didn't have the damage to deal with. So we fought them and aced them near Kraken/Gold miner, and proceeded to sprint at their base. We had a ticking timebomb of Kraken lumbering towards our exposed Vain crystal. We had to tank each turret, but we knew if we missed ANY damage we would lose the game. Every ability possible was used as the Kraken reached our Vain. We watched the health bar of the Vain drop lower and lower, and then it burst. We panned over to our base to see our crystal with just a fraction of its bar left. Our hearts were pumping, players were screaming, and we were rejoicing. It was glorious. I know not every game ends like that, but it had been a close game throughout. Both teams played hard, and the game was snatched from the jaws of defeat.  TL;DR: not every game will be close, but when they are it makes it very worth it."
vainglorygame,3ab3ud,adyendrus,3,Thu Jun 18 20:03:30 2015 UTC,LOVE games like that. They are the ones I continue playing for. Even if it's a loss they're still so fun and worth it.

It has only been 7 months since the VG launch in NA, so we have to play through these growing pains. I also go through waves of bad match-ups but overall it has actually been pretty darn good. Consider League of Legends, starting 2009, at 2011 they had 3,000,000 players, and today ~70,000,000. We're the foundation for that ever growing and thriving community and things will only get better. Do yourself a favor, don't look at your tier but only develop your ability to guide/lead the teammates that you're matched with. Small shifts can win you games. That mindset got me back to winning and climbing tiers. I dropped from Hotness to Decent Silver getting ever more despondent but climbed back to PG Bronze in less than two weeks, playing one or two focused games per night. FWIW. Hang in there. :)"

vainglorygame,3ac2tt,ShinakoX2,6,Thu Jun 18 21:58:17 2015 UTC,"Just ignore and carry the game. If you deserve to be in a higher bracket then you can carry yourself out. For example I used to be Decent-ish (bronze). I'm currently in Pretty Good (gold) and I'm stomping 4 out of every 5 games with at least 2k gold more than anyone else by simply taking objectives, being there for teamfights and farming my ass off (either in lane or jungle).  Don't be burnt out by the stupid games where the game is literally unwinnable due to skill difference. On average you should climb just by playing consistently better than your enemies."

Joule, Vox, or Ringo are probably safer, the first two more than the last.   Other than that, as others have suggested, find a guild who will take you. Many of us know what you're going through, and it can be frustrating, but stick it out.

vainglorygame,3abpo1,Jayblipbro,5,Thu Jun 18 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are describing a very erratic network connection issue. The player not found would only show up if you have completely de-synced with the servers. The high pings you are seeing in matches would also speak to this.   Unfortunately, there isn't anything the game can do to improve this. I would recommend a few things. One, make sure you don't have other apps running or trying to update that might be eating up your bandwidth. Two, make sure no one on your network is doing things like streaming video that could also eat up massive amounts of network space. And lastly, just make sure the network setup itself isn't the issue (modem/router, etc.)   You can also try using some peripherals to hardwire your device into your network.  Good luck though, it's super frustrating to try and play when you are on an unstable network."

vainglorygame,3abpo1,westonwasking,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"This may or may not help but my ISP (Comcast) supplied us with an AWFUL router that consistently has spiked my latency as soon as I log into a game.   All three of my devices; iphone, tablet, macbook; exhibit the same behavior for the last two years: 30-100 ping as soon as I connect to any game, followed by spikes within the first few minutes of 300-5000 latency. Yes, 5,000. Until I disconnect from the game and repeat the cycle.   This has applied to all online gaming for at least two years. I bought an Apple router about a year ago to extend my network (through an Ethernet link to the modem) and consistently have great ping times. Oddly Comcast has tested the unit multiple times and found no issues.   To this day the Comcast shit-router still spikes latency really badly. I know because I tested it yesterday. Same network, apple router that's further away from me physically? Works perfect.   I apologize for the long rant but I thought I'd post it in case it helps you or anyone else."
vainglorygame,3abpbw,Playback2337,7,Thu Jun 18 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Watch ShinKaigan soloQ on you tube there is a lot of great info for climbing tiers. Also watch some Twitch streams like Foojee, ShinKaigan, ESL ,VGL To learn the current meta which is ever changing. Also try not to blame your teammates as bad ones will come and go on both sides. You can learn more from a loss then you would from a win.  To climb you have to play the meta well or learn how to counter it well (I recommend both)  Also try to only think in a team state of mind by choosing the hero that will work best for your team. Also I will rarly buy items like agies and instead go for fountain for team wide benefits. Vision is key so buy scout traps no matter what position you play. I think watching twitch mainly ShinKaigan helped me get from Hotnes to SA. Have fun is the most important thing and don't forget things will be changing soon with 1.6 with casual Q  and especially now that devs get no sleep anymore as TheRealKrul confirmed :D Good luck"

The match making is just messed up right now.  I'll go from having matches with teammates who actually know what they're doing to teammates who don't even know how to build support.
vainglorygame,3abexk,mcdeezel,6,Thu Jun 18 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"It's possible a higher Elo team had maxed out their queue wait time and the matchmaker needed to extend the range to find a match for them. It's a bummer, but it can happen occasionally. We have some things we are working on that should dramatically help situations like this though."

If you are used to/ more comfortable playing with your fingers, then the bigger screens are probably the way to go.  Players coming from console and portable backgrounds, however, might be more comfortable or faster using thumbs. If this is the case, the 6+ (or similarly sized android device) is an excellent choice.   It seems like the majority of VG players -- especially those used to playing other MOBAs with a traditional keyboard/mouse interface -- prefer to use their fingers, but I've always felt more comfortable playing on my 6+ precisely because I play faster with my thumbs."

In the more unusual cases, this is an even larger problem because someone may have seen something like Ringo, and assumed that the team's WP damage was covered and then went with Koshka.  The point is that without a way to indicate, you can only assume. And everyone knows what happens when you assume...

vainglorygame,3a97fe,Ares-2,2,Thu Jun 18 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"Why either/or? Why not both? If you WP Ardan instead of Support, then I suppose you'd call it Roaming.  My thought is that Roam means something in between Jungle and Lane, meaning roaming between Jungle and Lane. Right? That's what it seems to imply.

I guess I'm forming my ""support"" mentality around my league of legends experience where the support player supports by letting the carry take all the last hits - and this is how the contract roughly works. Although I can see that a more World of Warcraft centric view could imply buffing and healing.  Given that, I think I'd still go with support as LoL currently has a larger player base than WoW. Maybe there's an even better term.  Bad Idea Bucket: Maybe we should just call the role ""Ironguard"""

vainglorygame,3a97fe,JekyllMD,2,Thu Jun 18 11:52:35 2015 UTC,"A Vainglory player will know that Roam means   So who cares about people new to Vainglory?   Choosing a word that has an existing definition to use as jargon when there is already an existing word with the definition people understand the jargon to use is just confusing.  Just call ""Roam"" ""Support"" if that's what people are using it as.  Edit:  I've also encountered Vainglory players who DON'T know what Jungle vs Roam means, and it resulted in some really odd team comps that ultimately didn't pan out."
vainglorygame,3a97fe,JekyllMD,2,Thu Jun 18 13:12:50 2015 UTC,"That's why I asked Ciderhelm ;) IMO a MOBA 101 in the academy would be great for new players. If Roam and Support are confusing, are lane and hard-carry, or jungle and semi-carry also confusing?"
vainglorygame,3a97fe,JekyllMD,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:41:26 2015 UTC,"Good question. I feel like Lane and Jungle are more straightforward because they are indicating places for you to be, and Roam follows that standard as well. Unfortunately, people don't use it like that, thus the confusion.  Adding terms like Hard-Carry and Semi-Carry would be more confusing to the new player because the term ""Carry"" is jargon that is pretty specific to MOBAs. Also, often the player who turns out to be the hard-carry in a match isn't always the one you'd expect to due to either the other team's composition, or just player skill, and often the best strategy is to adjust.  You bring up a good point though, and Support is potentially confusing since it doesn't specify a location like Lane and Jungle and more focuses on the role aspect. Arguably though, one could see the position of a support player as being by the side of another player.  I'm interested to see how SEMC's experiment in the next release will affect player psychology between the different role options."
vainglorygame,3a97fe,celsmore,2,Thu Jun 18 19:30:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree. Lane and jungle are more straightforward and also more popular in low elo. New players might learn faster that a good teamcomp should have a support, if they see that they can select lane, jungle and support. I don't think that it will solve the IGC problem, but it's a step in the right direction."
vainglorygame,3a97fe,Come_on-Man,2,Fri Jun 19 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"For lane and jungle, I generally associate more than just positions on the map. For me, laners deal high damage, are ranged, and focus less on defense and more on destroying turrets; junglers deal burst damage and can either be tanky or fragile, depending on the hero. Unfortunately, that's just my thinking, so others might not see them the same way."
vainglorygame,3a97fe,Come_on-Man,2,Sun Jun 28 02:25:40 2015 UTC,"Before VG, I didn't know anything about MOBAs. Imagine the confusion I had when hearing about ganking. Since I had no prior experience, this term confused me. However, it wouldn't make sense to completely stop using that term and replacing it with ambush. Sometimes, certain genres and games have unique lingo that you have to get used to."
vainglorygame,3a97fe,iwanttobeadog,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"This feedback is golden. I suspect that most if not all of the developers are too familiar with MOBAs, and especially their own MOBA, so feedback like this from someone who is new to the genre is super useful.  I agree that keeping the term in some form is useful, because it still refers to a role that is viable. However, I would also like to see a way to communicate to your teammates that you are intending on taking a support/tank role where you intend on building mostly items that will help your teammates (for example: Ironguard Contract, Crucible, Fountain of Health, Pauldrons).  I think a side effect of offering more than three roles to choose from would make it more clear to players that they should be more open to different types of team compositions. With just three roles, it tacitly implies that each player should take on one of the three."
vainglorygame,3a97fe,iwanttobeadog,2,Sun Jun 28 02:05:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't the majority of SEMC for Riot though? I thought that's why they left to make their own MOBA.  As for figuring out what her teammates are building tanky or whatever, I just check their items. It gets a bit tedious though, so having an option to choose certain roles before the game starts would be great. It would be kind of difficult to communicate effectively though with so many options to figure out.  If there are more options added before game, I feel that only a simple build indicator, such as a red or blue orb, would be sufficient. The rest should be able to be determined on what hero they chose."

vainglorygame,3abhwi,GEOpdx,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:56:28 2015 UTC,You gain points on wins and lose points on losses. The amount of gain or loss depends on your teams average Elo score vs your opponents. It's my understanding that your tier can only change every 5 games. I have also come to believe that your tier can only go down after a lose and up after a win. (perhaps someone can verify).  So if you mix wins with loses it will take a very long time to go up depending on the Elo of your opponents. If you go 5-7 games in a row with wins against quality opponents you could go up quickly

vainglorygame,3abdcm,Okami_G,2,Thu Jun 18 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"why ""hate to say it""?"
vainglorygame,3abdcm,Okami_G,4,Thu Jun 18 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"Because I personally dislike LoL and highly favor Dota. Both have its merits, but LoL just wasn't fun at all for me."
vainglorygame,3abdcm,Koozaza,4,Thu Jun 18 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has said League will be the easier transition to the PC MOBAs.  Plus since a good number of the devs actually came from Riot it makes League a better fit.  Even though it's the easier mechanical game, it's still gonna be a big leap from VG.  You have things like Masteries, which are talent trees, Rune that affect basic stats, Summoner spells, which are long cool down spells used situationally to gain an advantage in a fight or to try and escape.  Roles are probably the bigger change from VG.  You only have one jungler, one mid champion that is either magical or physical based, one top champion that goes fairly tanky, for the most part, and a bottom duo that consists of and AD carry, same as the sniper role, and a support that makes sure they don't die.  The support can help out the top laner in a lane swap, but for the most part stays with the ADC.  Since you're starting out going as a duo bot lane with your friend would probably be best.  Even though you play junglers here, in league it's one of the more complicated roles.  Mid would be another good position.  As for champions, I would avoid the assassins even though you like Taka. They are the champions with the highest skill ceiling in League and Taka's abilities correlate more to the duelists than the assassins.  I would recommend try looking on the LoL wiki to see what champions sound interesting to you.  The only down side is that unlike DotA2 you won't have all the champs unlocked at the start so it'll be hard to just try out to see if you'll like it or not."
vainglorygame,3abdcm,nyadav,3,Thu Jun 18 22:57:24 2015 UTC,LoL will be an easier transition. Dota2 has way more mechanics to learn than league. I tried playing Dota after 4 years of league and didn't get very far because I didn't want to relearn all new mechanics and more.
vainglorygame,3abdcm,icecreamsandwich,3,Thu Jun 18 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"LoL will feel more similar. I have to recommend Dota personally though! It's a staggeringly complex game.

vainglorygame,3abdcm,Kenshin1340,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:15:45 2015 UTC,"This is very subjective but I've put over 800 hrs into league (probably closer to the 1k range) and about ~500 (Steam actually keeps track of these) and to be honest, if you find yourself being an above average player, DotA will be more fun for you. The doldrums of DotA are much worse than those of League and the advantage of DotA is that everything in game is unlocked, so you can focus on gameplay.  The gameplay /is/ harder, but people like Purge have created easy guides that help you ease into DotA. I'd personally be willing to help you out because I love DotA a ton; I've always been the type that sinks money into games and I've done a lot for both mobas but all of it for DotA has been cosmetic, whereas in LoL I find myself buying gameplay advantages sometimes.  IMO, DotA will be more worth it in the long run.  Ninja: not that LoL is a bad game (I've put so much time into it so I've forced myself to love it) but DotA's complexity has its own charms. LoL feels stale after playing DotA tbh."

vainglorygame,3a88eo,KristinaWilkes,2,Thu Jun 18 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"You just started, so it's normal that some things feel awkward to you.   Learning when to go in and when to retreat is very important, but it's also something that takes a lot of experience to get right.   Since Koshka is fragile, it's usually better for her to fight alongside teammates. If you find yourself in a fight that isn't going your way, run away (with the speed boost you accumulate from your abilities).  Also, I strongly suggest that you try many different heroes. They each have a unique play style to which they are more suited and you might find some more natural to you than others."
vainglorygame,3a88eo,glStelar,2,Thu Jun 18 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"Hope you're enjoying VG! There's a casual player podcast called The Fold out there, if you're interested! Another great place to learn some things are on the Vainglory Casual YouTube channel or by watching the daily twitch streams! :) Game on friend."
vainglorygame,3a88eo,Justin_TheFold,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:51 2015 UTC,With Koshka its best to have map awareness and look for the enemy team who might be low health so you can jump in and speed dash out very quickly. Youre not mean to stay in prolonged team fights. Koshka is all about targeting the carry and eliminating them and then help your team clean up the the remaining enimies.
vainglorygame,3a88eo,SaberSix_,2,Thu Jun 18 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"One of the most important tips is to always earn gold. Whether jungle or line, dont stop earning gold. As you pass minions in the jungle, kill them. (unless you are rushing to aid teammates).   Mines are very important. Lower tier levels rarely place mines all over the map. Vision is extremely useful and can win games.  Watch some videos. I suggest Shinkaigains solo que video. Its amazing and full of great beginner tips.   Koshka is a bit weaker. Your advantage should be that you are the fastest jungles. Which means you can rush to the enemy creeps by the store and take them out first. then go back to your side of the jungle. Dont engage the enemy right away, but jungle like crazy.  A lot of Koshkas start with extra life. Always a good purchase. You may find more luck if you learn a player that is a little stronger right now. Also, many people dont play support at lower tiers. Learning how to play a good support character can often win games."
vainglorygame,3a88eo,RuhRoh235,2,Thu Jun 18 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"When you're playing Koshka, never engage by yourself unless you are extremely fed and have a 1-2 item advantage over someone else.  Usually, when I find myself in that position, I don't find myself with more than one defensive item since I can blow up the enemy before needing to blow all my defensive cooldowns.    The main thing you need to be able to do with Koshka is adapt your play style based on who the other jungler is and how they are building.  Playing with an Ardan/Fortress/Joule then you're the carry in the jungle and you want to wait for them to initiate first with you following up.  When you have a tank it's easier to stay in the fight and make use of your Heroic Perk to help you get your abilities off cooldown faster.  If you're playing with an Adagio/Taka/Vox/Krul/Glaive then it kind of depends on who gets rolling more.  Although, with Koshka it doesn't hurt her if you only get a couple damage items, such as a combination of Aftershock/Eve of Harvest/Frostburn for CP Koshka, and then go full tank to counter your opponents.  Try to save your Pouncy Fun for catching a low opponent instead of using it to initiate, at least in the early game.  Since you should be focusing on maxing Twirly Death first, the cooldown for Pouncy Fun will be longer and sometimes you can find yourself just barely out of range when it comes back up.  Trying to catch an opponent on the run with your ult can sometimes get you in trouble as you can slingshot past your opponent while locking them down.  Save it for when you are with your entire team and use it to tie up their laner or jungle carry, so they can get blown up and you have a man advantage afterwards.  Some tricks that I've found help me play Koshka more effectively are to always make sure you have at least one stack of Twirly Death's attack boost for that extra damage before a fight breaks out.  That extra 30-150 damage does help out especially if you are able to get right into multiple enemies and get to add more stack.  If you already blew all your abilities then hit something and back off until you can get something off cooldown since every basic attack reduces all your cooldowns by 2 seconds (1 for your ult). This will probably take a while to get the hang of, but try to always keep up your Heroic Perk stacks when heading into fights or when chasing down low targets.  Nothing is worse then having that extra movement speed drop off and then your target pops their boots."
vainglorygame,3a88eo,Koozaza,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:04:04 2015 UTC,That's exactly what you have to do. Maybe you need to practice the execution a little. Koshka is an assassin so she's fragile but can do some serious damage.

vainglorygame,3a88eo,Koozaza,2,Thu Jun 18 00:59:46 2015 UTC,The pink cat is actually saying Koshka's basic attacks are hitting harder than normal because she hit at least one target with Twirly Death.

vainglorygame,3a88eo,JekyllMD,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:53:27 2015 UTC,"I used to main as her, so I know some stuff. First, have someone with you when you're trying to take on enemies. You can clear the jungle solo, but she's too fragile to take on enemies alone. She also shouldn't initiate. Have allies lead them to you so you can help take them down. Koshka plays best by using abilities then running away."
vainglorygame,3a88eo,Kraken_SEMC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:13:56 2015 UTC,"Welcome! I recommend taking some time to practice bot matches or solo matches with your Koshka, but also try and practice with a few other characters so that you can help fill in the blanks for your team. It can be tricky if you get randomly partied up and all three of you have only practiced with Koshka ;)  Another helpful thing to do is watch streams on Twitch. There are loads of amazing streamers at this point and it's always a great opportunity to both meet more players, but also see how they do what they do.  VaingloryFire.com is also a nice resource as it can help you learn different build paths, etc.   This sub, the forums and some of the podcasts (The Fold, and Shatter the Vain) are also loaded with great info on how to improve your game."
vainglorygame,3a88eo,InfernapeGamez,0,Thu Jun 18 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"I think Taka is a god starting point. Mastering Koshka is a pretty hard task. Taka's Heroic Perk (basic a passive ability that is in effect at all times) is amazing and can give Taka a huge burst in damage to do large amounts of a hero's health in  a small amount of time. His abilities have a short cooldown which is accelerated even further with his perk. They do a lot of damage and can get him out of battle quickly and stealthily. Just use his recommended path for him; it's the first tab on the shop. I use a small alteration of it and I once got 23 kills and 3 deaths in a game, as well as securing the win for my team. Stay in the jungle until about level 10, where you can easily kill many in a 1v1 fight. attack the large healing monsters first, then go on to attack the camps of two smaller monsters. Good luck in the Fold, and try as many different characters as you can to see which one you like the most!"

That sort of cheeriness comes off as sarcastic, especially when they do the open mouth smiley. That just looks like they are laughing at you.  It's a hard balance to find, but when your teammate replies with a ! Or an OKAY x 10 it might be an indication that the smileys aren't coming across as a ""cake in the car"" smile of solidarity.

However I know this is easier said than done, so if I really can't stand a teammate, I will throw the surrender vote - even if we are winning. I never give up and afk though."
vainglorygame,3a77cn,thenamestsam,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:00:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some that at least some of those people were trying to antagonize you. My only point is that you don't have to let them get under your skin. A smiley face or a thumbs up is only ""toxic"" behavior if you let it bother you. On the surface it's not particularly harmful (as opposed to ping spamming for example, which is much more annoying even if you try to ignore it)."
vainglorygame,3a77cn,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"Sarcastic pings are no where near as bad as ping spamming, but it's still pretty rude. Just because something is tolerable, doesn't mean that it should be tolerated. Ignoring in game is good, but if they keep it up and it's clearly not smiles of encouragement, then I think reporting them as toxic is totally fair.  I don't think /u/dubiousatbest is reporting people for a one time smile after a death. The sarcastic pingers make themselves pretty clear as they seem to rejoice after each time you die. There are definitely better ways to show your support of your teammates than smiling after each time they die."
vainglorygame,3a77cn,ronslie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:05:55 2015 UTC,"I get annoyed with the sarcastic pings.  I've come to ignore most pings except the green and white ones.  As a Cath player, I do die early fairly often if my team engages and it's apparent we're going to lose early on.  The amount of '?' or smiley faces you get for helping them escape is amazing.  Last night died 7 times before 10 minutes just taking one for the team and letting the carries escape so that they can maintain gold farming.  Endless spam pings.  Well guess what?  Eventually we won because they were able to survive.  The thing that bothers me is that they'll think they're so great and that going 3 vs 1 is the right call because it worked last game."
vainglorygame,3a77cn,celsmore,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. I see ridiculous pings a lot, though I'm down in the lower tiers. Perhaps that's why.  At least there isn't actual typing chat allowed. Idiots can still be jerks with pings, but at least I haven't been called a body part or a racial slur like back in my LOL days."

vainglorygame,3a8ylo,muriouskind,2,Thu Jun 18 04:14:59 2015 UTC,"How clueless would they be? Like, would they even know about abilities or ganking? That can make a major difference."
vainglorygame,3a8ylo,JekyllMD,2,Thu Jun 18 04:40:38 2015 UTC,Over 9000.
vainglorygame,3a8ylo,Ares-2,2,Thu Jun 18 05:03:43 2015 UTC,"The number would increase exponentially as the game goes on. This is because the trio of experts would be able to farm, thus getting more and more fed. I think it would take 6 people at the beginning (lv1) and more than 20 at lv12 (assuming the trio are lv12 and the others are like 8-9 due to their lack of farm).  Eventually, the number would plateau and decrease as everyone starts filling their 6 slots with tier 3 items."
vainglorygame,3a8ylo,_matrix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"Probably about 10, as 10 vs 3 should be able to just overpower them since their numbers will be too high"
vainglorygame,3a8ylo,setchy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:29:28 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough I think the number would have to be astoundingly high. Resources are limited on the fold so it's not just a matter of throwing more people into the game. Everyone will be underfarmed while the team of three will probably know how to optimally get gold to become practically invincible. Not to mention the level advantage they will have.  This is of course assuming the new players are in fact very new, don't have a firm grasp of tactics or how to make the best of their situation (everyone buy ironguard)."

vainglorygame,3a8ylo,_DelGriffith_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:43:48 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's the right answer. It would be endless or at least until the VG team died from exhaustion.   To expand on this point. The 3 VG players, once dead in real life could have just parked themselves on the spawn platform and never die."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,Silency,14,Wed Jun 17 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this too, the only way I could see it actually being fair is if he was only allowed to Roadie Run out of Suppressing Fire. That way he'd still have to have the ability up and energy available to escape."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,Zaggaz,9,Thu Jun 18 01:33:03 2015 UTC,I think this is a nice compromise to an outright cancel that could make a real difference for him.
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,tehkyy,3,Thu Jun 18 07:03:09 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting one.   You're right, he would be played competitively!  Sadly, it would be because he'd be over powered. You could just cancel it and get an instant 12 stacks, making it impossible for anyone to trade with you. Then if you need to get away, just use your A."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,fmaBlots,0,Thu Jun 18 08:02:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, without it he wouldn't be assassin bait/burned to death by Ringo/Skaarf. There's no reason to play him in comparison to other laners because he has no escape options and, like you said, can't trade kills."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,ChapterLiam,4,Thu Jun 18 10:35:57 2015 UTC,He does have an escape option: roadie run.
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,oldboldmold,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:41:22 2015 UTC,"Well, he has an escape (Roadie Run), but unlike Vox, Saw is completely  useless when he uses his escape.  One of the main reasons he's not played in NA is because he's an objective based hero. You have to play around him and play around pushing the lane for him to be any good. Unlike SEA, NA is super heavy on jungle Skirmish. You'll see it in SEA, but over all they like the objective based gameplay. Saw fits well in their meta. Same with EA"
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,fmaBlots,2,Thu Jun 18 18:15:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting. So he can just quit out of his suppressing fire at any time?  Does Joule quit her BRB any time? And Koshka quit her ult any time? Can Petal retract her exploding munions?  I think there has to be a drawback to SAW's suppressing fire, which is very powerful, especially early game, as it slows and can take off a lot of damages when he's CP. But I see where you're coming from."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,peterkeats,2,Thu Jun 18 00:02:57 2015 UTC,"not immediatly, but 1 - 1,5 sec after he pressed b for example"
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,PrudeJesus,2,Thu Jun 18 00:11:57 2015 UTC,"Its not a bad idea, perhaps less stacks of spin up based on when you quit surpressing fire?"
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,solid77,2,Thu Jun 18 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"they would have to nerf the slow then, it would be too good."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,Tsar_MapleVG,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:27:11 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen here, what sounds very reasonable would be having his B build up stacks per duration, say 4 stacks a second over a duration of 3 seconds and increasing the ability time to 3 seconds. That way, he wouldn't be overpowered by instantly having 12 stacks when canceling the ability."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:48:50 2015 UTC,"But even at 8 stacks, you get the last 4 very quickly. It's the first 5-6 that are pretty slow."
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,Tsar_MapleVG,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"Feel free to manipulate the number of stacks and the amount of time in what I said, as that basic idea should help give people some grounds to ponder"
vainglorygame,3a7ux6,Malgus234,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:41:47 2015 UTC,I think they should divide the total time by 12 and depending at what interval you interrupt it at you get that many stacks. They of course should round up.

vainglorygame,3a69xy,GEOpdx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:14:08 2015 UTC,Been noticing that in the last week I have had a whole bunch of great jungle partners as teammates.  I tend to play Catherine as support and had some great times terrorizing the jungle.  Once someone picked a support so I went Koshka and my fellow jungler Taka even bought an ironguard contract and got me to level 6!
vainglorygame,3a69xy,Furniss8u,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"Last night, I was just enjoying myself with a few games with randoms. I normally main Catherine, stun-locking anything I can, tanking everything else.   While about 5-10 minutes in, one of my teammates abandoned the match. Initially I was a little annoyed (as one would expect), but then my teammate (Vox) and I started to aggressively push the lane. We continuously managed to ace the enemy team, to destroy all the turrets and then eventually win the game, 2v3. I was astounded, one of the best matches I've played so far.   So yeh, good teammates are a thing! Who would have thought?"

vainglorygame,3a6fyn,LowEloVGPlayer,4,Wed Jun 17 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly this happens across all levels of play. You can go on the official game forums and read post after post of people ranting and raving about bad teammates and at the end they post ""Oh by the way, this is in Not Bad Gold"".  People always bring up the Dunning-Kruger effect (unskilled people tend to overrate their own competence), but I think the fundamental attribution error also plays a huge role in this. When people see their own mistakes, misplays, missed skillshots etc. they see ""Oh the other guy dodged"", or ""My hand slipped and I misclicked"", or ""I thought my teammate was going to zig but he zagged"". When they see the same mistakes in others they conclude that the other person is just a bad player who doesn't know what he's doing.  I try to remember that outside of weird matchmaking things my teammates are the same rank as me. That means that for every thing they do worse than I do they probably do something better, and for every mistake I see in their play there's probably one I'm missing (or noticing but underrating the importance of) in my own play."
vainglorygame,3a6fyn,thenamestsam,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:54:14 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm hesitant to say that most of the people I encounter who do this are ""unskilled"" because, at SA, they're still better than 80% of the player base. (Also, there are SA smurfs.) But it's still generally presumptuous to think you know better than players one or two tiers above you. You might, but that shouldn't be the default reaction."
vainglorygame,3a6fyn,Logic_85,6,Wed Jun 17 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"Adaptability...  If I am with teammates who don't do group fights well (focusing the tank, not responding to engagements, etc) I play way less aggressive and wait for them to make clear engaging moves before I jump into a fight.    Same with jungling: if someone is clearly not responding to my attempts to co-jungle, I just go it alone.    Knowing how to take care of yourself, despite the skill (or lack of skill) of your teammates can still help win games.  If you can hold your own for a while and wait to take advantage when your teammates do well, you can still win games."

I went from Hotness to low Decentish in the span of a week in the most painful way, but I've managed to work my way back, mostly through solo queue. The best advice I have for you is to accept these two facts:  1 - You are the only player that you can control.  and  2 - You must play with the hand you are dealt.  What I mean by this is that if you see that your teammates don't have any clue how to use the IGC, then for the rest of the game, expect that they won't figure it out. Don't try to teach them, just play the best game that you can without maximizing the IGC.   On the bright side, you're playing at a level where your opponents will be making lots of mistakes as well. Focus on capitalizing on your enemy's mistakes, and not your teammates mistakes. Otherwise, you'll get so frustrated with your teammates that YOU will start playing poorly and making poor decisions out of rage.  I realize that all of this is easier said than done, but with practice, it can be done. I'm still working on accepting those two facts in every game I play, and I believe it has made my over all experience better, regardless of whether I win or lose.."

vainglorygame,3a74nc,InfernapeGamez,2,Wed Jun 17 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"I just played an absolutely astounding game as Taka. 21-3-6, won on Ace with a weapon/crystal infused Vox. It was just using his recommended. I had great teammates, especially Vox (the Koshka was good at fighting but his items were bad so he died frequently).  It was Ringo, Joule and Koshka vs me (Taka), Vox and Koshka. No AFKs, no trolls, just full-on fair gameplay, and I have never done so good in not just Vainglory but in any MOBA. I think I'm gonna try to use Taka and his recommended."

However, I bought Joule after checking the new rotation, and she's a monster. I would suggest saving up for either her or Krul.  You can't really carry with assassins, but using CP builds and healing items should help you out somewhat."
vainglorygame,3a74nc,_matrix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:18:51 2015 UTC,"If Krul can out farm others, he can carry (3vs1) a team until maybe Decentish Gold+.   This may only be for higher skilled players (I stay around SA Silver), but who knows, maybe you can do it too.   A couple weeks ago, I made a smurf to see how quickly I could climb. I soon learned that lower tier players do not farm a lot, and tend to focus on kills. Most games, I would be level 8 (overdrive A or B ability) while others would be 5 or 6. Not to mention that I would have a tier 3 item before them. I could easily gain a huge lead in gold, and I would be able to easily destroy 2vs1 due to the tanky nature of Krul. As I climbed tiers, people eventually learned that farm > kills, and I relied more on my teammates than my selves. I suggest that you do this until PG (or until whenever you feel like you have competent teammates).   I went for the standard Aftershock build for Krul, but often went the Breaking Point route if the enemy team was tanky.   Hope this helped, and I hope you can climb using some of the information I said."
vainglorygame,3a74nc,ifuckinglovekatara,0,Thu Jun 18 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"While they certainly can be annoying. It's not going to get you anywhere by simply blaming every loss on your teammates.  It's much better to look at a match you just lost, and ask yourself what you could have done better that match. Nobody has ever played a perfect game, and there is always something you can learn from a loss.  I get that solo queue can get annoying. I get it. It does get better at higher tiers, though there still are some people who don't know how IGC works, or make rookie mistakes that cost their team a fight or a kraken.  If your going to continue solo queuing, it's really luck if the draw, you just have to aim to be the best teammate you can be all the time. Good luck in the future!"
vainglorygame,3a74nc,ifuckinglovekatara,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I will admit a couple of times I didn't do my best (my most recent match I did terribly, 2/7/5 or so), and there are some times where solo queue does screw you over. I've been trying my best to help them out, but sometimes they'll just ignore, or even be a higher level or have more skill, so when I try to help I get killed and they get double-teamed.   Do you have any tips that can still help us have a fighting chance even on the chance of some things getting in our way, or should I just hope for the best and keep playing despite what may go on in my team, whether it be me or my allies?"
vainglorygame,3a74nc,GEOpdx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd recomend playing the carry if you can at lower tiers, odds are the enemy team doesn't have a support, so whoever can do the most damage faster wins. Team fights are also less common at lower tiers, so be sure to pick your individual matchups carefully.   Put scout traps next to the gold miner/kraken so you can have visibility. If the kraken or gold miner moves out of sight on your minimap, it's being taken by the enemy team.  I can be your teammate if you want sometimes. I have a separate account I use to play with my friend who is new to the game, my IGN is BloodEyeMiata and I can be a Cath for your Koshka if you need it!  Edit: I also forgot, when building a high damage hero like Crystal Koshka, make sure you have at least one defensive item near the end of your build. If the enemy is building crystal damage, go for sheild. If they are building weapon, build armor. Counter building is something you should get used to, it helps a lot at higher tiers."

She hits fast and far, and her explody munions can sneak up well in a teamfight. She is the master kiter.  I think the mixed success just has to do with the fact that a lot of people have forgotten how to play against a Petal since she's so off-meta. Wiser players remember how she's just another squishy laner that has trouble dealing out and dealing with burst damage."

vainglorygame,3a4sin,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:09:07 2015 UTC,In this patch I've rushed Fountain then Clockwork with Catherine and seen a lot of success. You can build situational after that. Works well for Fortress too.

If you're playing support with another jungler then warhorn is usually a wasted slot. Those caths are usually useless for too long of the game, unless the player is really good. Usually a fountain is great to start.   edit this is wrong! Also according to another thread building straight hp (crucible) worsens your shield so defense is usually better. Unless of course you need that reflex block for your team.   I never built a clockwork because I always beat out the enemys who did. They usually don't have enough tank but with the new meta I think its a must have item now. Lots kf stuns and your shield is always in use"

Double fountain and crucible is a good core build. Maybe an Atlas if you go against attack speed. 3 damage: normally your teammates deal the damage. If you must: Aftershock, breaking point, bone saw if you have a WP carry, the new broken myth maybe?

The cooldown acceleration means you can rack up the armor from her passive by stunning as often as possible. I usually go clockwork next so that I can keep the stuns coming. Only then will I buy aftershock to do a little extra damage with those stuns. Also build a defense item depending on enemy team builds. Get a shatterglass last to do as much damage as possible with your aftershock. In terms of levels, max out your A ASAP, and use it whenever possible. With this build, Catherine gets lots of armor from the stuns, and keeps enemies locked down for your teammates to kill. Don't expect to get lots of kills or do lots of damage though- you're playing support here."
vainglorygame,3a4sin,GEOpdx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"I always build warhorn and upgrade my boots these days because the hp and regen bonuses since 1.5 make armor and shield work very well ( I like tanky). I then build one of a couple of ways.  Enemy team is mostly crystal = fountain, clockwork, fountain  Enemy team is weapon power or attack speed dependent = atlas, clockwork, altas  Enemy team has lots of stuns or ults = sub a crucible for one of the above scenarios  Your team is light on damage = sub an aftershock for the cockwork  Enemy team goes heavy shield and yours is light on damage = add a heavy steel.   I have found being flexable to be a key.  I have completely turned around loosing games with double atlas or fountain."
vainglorygame,3a4sin,solid77,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"i usually rush fountain and get t1 boots early (first item is igc). after that it's mostly counter building. if they got a wp laner like vox/ringo i might go atlas next (really depends on how well they are doing). if they got a comp that requires a crucible i might build that next, or just build another fountain. i usually build 2-3 support items then start building for aftershock or even clockwork. also, the whole time i'm buying a ton of mines/flares. other than that your job is to stun/create vision/use support items etc at the right times. don't waste stuns on low priority targets like their tank or support.  since joule is so popular right now, it might be good to wait for the ult and stun her. if you have a team that's great at moving out of the way of her ult i usually just bubble and walk into her ult, it does a ton of damage back to the enemy :p"

vainglorygame,3a4sin,GEOpdx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:24:51 2015 UTC,I honestly liked the old warhorn with the energy regen bonus on cath. It solved so many relevant problems. now I have to build a clockwork or aftershock earlier to get energy and cool down accel.  The contraption kinda sucks.

The next error is that there has been more time to collect rare drops and common drops than there has been to collect epics. This error will decrease over time, but will also affect data on legendary drops.  There's also the level up which provide specific card rarities. Another minor skewing factor.

vainglorygame,3a3dlr,chacet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"The best way to stop a stunner is to stun the stunner with your own stunner's stun. What?  Stuns only hurt when it's 3 v you/your team. If it's 1 or 2 v you/your team, you usually have enough time to escape.   Who are your mains? If you don't see a stunner on your team comp, try to pick one to round things out. Cath is most effective, then Joule, then Vox (that's a silence so not exactly the same), then Celeste, then Glaive, then Ardan, then Krul."
vainglorygame,3a3dlr,_matrix,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"Against teams like that you have several options.  1) early game, play more aggressive. Fortress loves to initiate, and boosts everyone's damage thanks to his bleed. If he's on your team, pray he's initiating early and often.  Look at the people you mentioned, aside from Celeste who has a strong early game and a stun? No one! And Celeste is super squishy. Recognize the weakness in the comp and counter it  2) Mid game, if they somehow manage to remain a threat, beware of traps. Vision is key here to avoid traps. And vision doesn't mean Celeste stars, that puts her at a very big risk even when at max range. Vision means mines and flares. If you know when they're coming before they come, the likelihood of your survival increase a billion fold! (I did the math :)  Also if they have a joule, constantly be on the look out for corridors and line ups. If the three of you guys are chasing her, it's likely none of you will be alive in 5 seconds. Ping avoid turn around and steal farms or objecives.  3) late game. Crucibles and reflex blocks are critical. You normally only have to block the first stun to avoid the chain. And if they burn all their stuns on a person who blocked the first one and ran, then it's now safe to engage and wreck someone. Make them pay for that mistake, don't just sit back and let their abilities come off cooldown.. Hint: all stuns have about 1/4 the cooldown of a reflex block... So they'll be ready for the next fight faster than you."
vainglorygame,3a3dlr,ShinakoX2,0,Wed Jun 17 09:10:45 2015 UTC,1 option Joule BRB and delete the team before they stun you gg. Try to always have a stunner on your team and since you cannot communicate with your team at select dont lock in until they choose someone who can stun or you chose the stunner. Simple.

vainglorygame,3a1yhm,hiphoptomato,5,Tue Jun 16 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"Gold you grab in jungle is gold denied for the enemy.

vainglorygame,3a1yhm,MrTouchnGo,0,Tue Jun 16 23:55:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not making the case for abandoning the jungle for the lane. What I'm saying is all players need to be more set to ""roam"". I leave the lane if need be all the time to help a jungler in trouble and vice versa. It's never good to just assume your teammates have a conflict under control and keep farming.

Farming puts you ahead in experience, too, and a lot of fights can swing depending on who gets their ultimate or overdrive up first. And going to lane puts you behind in experience, not only because of the opportunity cost, but also because you leach more experience from your laner."

vainglorygame,3a1yhm,MrTouchnGo,3,Wed Jun 17 12:40:34 2015 UTC,"I have 2 counter points, please correct me if I'm wrong, I just started playing recently:   Depending on the situation (my heroes health, their dive potential, etc.) I will abandon a turret, rather than give them another kill, an ace, and most likely the turret too I think going for a 50% or over gold mine is better than a turret because the gold mine is limited. It will only pay out 1200 (?) Gold over the course of the match and it's on a timer. If you take that gold, then you're getting double effective gold by denying it to your opponents. Turrets can always be taken later, and the enemy team can destroy your turret in return and balance out the gold difference. Also destroying the first turret too early makes your laner more vulnerable to ganks since he has to push out farther to farm on their side of the map."
vainglorygame,3a1yhm,ShinakoX2,3,Tue Jun 16 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"I agree gold mine > turret specially if it's early enough in the game when you really can't burst the turret fast enough. As the game goes on you can kill a turret in 10 seconds or less. Early game, it'll take too long and the respawn timers are too short to guarantee you the turret."
vainglorygame,3a1yhm,Glory_DrEvil,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"The first I suppose is situational. But if you can hang back a little behind the turret and think you can survive always do that. I was mostly frustrated at a player who had nearly full health and fled back to base!   Gold mine almost never works how you plan it to. Although I guess i never considered gold vs effective gold. I've just never found the immediate 300 gold that beneficial? Also if it's after 6-7 minutes, it's not too early to take the first turret."
vainglorygame,3a1yhm,ShinakoX2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"It's still situational, but my biggest concern is that if we take the turret, but then the enemy team takes the gold mine, then the gold from the extra turret doesn't matter. If they take our turret later, they're still ahead from the gold mine.  I find the incremental gold leads to matter more into the late game then the map control from taking down a turret."
vainglorygame,3a1yhm,tehkyy,3,Tue Jun 16 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"True, but taking a turret early isn't just a gold bonus it's a morale bonus, and a tactical bonus. The other team's mental state though not shattered will be at the very least effected(affected?) and you'll have a much easier time ganking them in lane. For me 9/10 go for the turret but everybody is different so it's rarely a unanimous decision (soloQ) where we should go with our ace. Me and my swirly reds vote for the turret (almost) every time!"
vainglorygame,3a1yhm,Quezno11,3,Tue Jun 16 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"And I'll be right next you focusing that turret. Like you said, taking it down = gold, morale boost, and easier ganks."
vainglorygame,3a1yhm,VGChicken,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"If you capture the gold mine early enough, it's usually worth at least a second pay out as well, since teams don't have the DPS to burst it down before maybe 12 minutes (and so risk getting aced again)."
vainglorygame,3a1yhm,MindYaBidness,2,Tue Jun 16 20:22:42 2015 UTC,It amazes me how many people try to kill the tank first. It's not a one time thing either. If they do it once then they're going to do it all game.

vainglorygame,3a0rgo,Lensjo,6,Tue Jun 16 09:27:09 2015 UTC,There comes a time when I stop sharing gold since I mainly use Fortress as a Jungle/Support. I let my Jungler have the gold until they reach level 6. But when my team is lvl 10 and Im only level 6/7 ; I start farming hard to try and catch up :(

vainglorygame,3a0rgo,jatatcdc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, I wanna say, I enjoy your stream but don't worry about falling behind as the support. That's totally okay. As a support you should be buying mainly defense and utility items which are generally cheaper than offensive items. You won't need as much gold as your carries need, so feed your carry and make sure they have all the gold they need."
vainglorygame,3a0rgo,SaberSix_,3,Tue Jun 16 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"Haha thank you :D Yes I do try and feed the carry and it seems like a lot of the time it balances itself out because I tend to get the kills early game by making the target bleed and them dying beyond their turret from the bleed affect. However, I like to have my first two support items (Warhorn and Foutain) fairly early in the game because in order to get the most damage from my bleed I need 4 total hits and I need the sustain from foutain and warhorn for the fast getaways if I'm turret diving!"
vainglorygame,3a0rgo,jatatcdc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually try not to worry about who gets the kill on heroes. It's obviously preferred that a carry does, but the important part is that they die, the gold from a kill is typically meager.  I don't play as much Fortress, so I can't give you any knowledge specific to him. But keep in mind that to get that bleed damage, it can be any of your allies, not just you."

vainglorygame,3a0rgo,yourMOMvg,7,Tue Jun 16 12:59:14 2015 UTC,there is an excellent video here on reddit that explains perfectly how it works. Here is the link: http://brokenmyth.net/ironguard-contract-the-complete-guide/
vainglorygame,3a0rgo,6F6A9O9,5,Tue Jun 16 13:07:20 2015 UTC,"Say you're Koshka and your teammate Catherine has Ironguard.  Let Catherine hit the minion first, causing it to attack Catherine.  While Catherine takes the hits, you kill the minion.  If you do it this way, Catherine gets to share the gold from killing a minion near her, and also gets extra for absorbing some of the hits.  She also gets some life back.   And you get the same gold.  And you don't get hit by the minion, so you have all your life.  The wrong way to do it: Ping ? on Cath as you pounce on the minon, drag it away from Catherine, and take the gold.  Then Catherine gets nothing.  Doing it this way means you also take the hits from the minion, making you weaker.  It also takes longer to kill the minion, because Catherine hasn't hit it.  This weakens the team, because you're gold starving a teammate that can be helping you.  If you're really not understanding the ironguard, then late in the game you'll keep pinging ? on Catherine because she keeps dying and isn't helping during the team fights.  Generally, if your teammate is walking over a minion you're killing without attacking it, they have the IGC (check the scoreboard), and want you to kill the minion. Let them attack first, so the monster doesn't get mad at you."
vainglorygame,3a0rgo,ShinakoX2,2,Tue Jun 16 14:21:48 2015 UTC,Great response.   Thanks!!
vainglorygame,3a0rgo,jdc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:00:54 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify:   the person with IGC gets a bonus 50% of the minion bounty gold for being near the kill If the IGC is tanking/ has aggro, the teammate who kills it gets 20% extra bonus gold. IGC can increase gold up to 70%"
vainglorygame,3a2g84,FightasticMG,4,Tue Jun 16 18:29:46 2015 UTC,I think adding a fourth tick would make it level. Adding that extra time required to get the full blast makes it all that more important to stun instead of just getting caught off guard.
vainglorygame,3a2g84,eh-blank-space,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:32:39 2015 UTC,I'm confused. Could you clarify what you mean? I don't see how adding yet another tick would make Joule more balanced.
vainglorygame,3a2g84,ShinakoX2,5,Tue Jun 16 19:35:32 2015 UTC,"Make the ult longer, and split the damage between the ticks. Same damage, but requires longer channeling, and gives more time for people to react.   Example: Skarff with Myth can destroy a team just like Joule, but his ult takes longer to complete, giving people time to react."
vainglorygame,3a2g84,solid77,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:52:03 2015 UTC,Ok that makes a lot of sense! I was thinking along the lines of -- more ticks = more damage but more ticks = same damage seems pretty decent.
vainglorygame,3a2g84,osi42,2,Wed Jun 17 04:30:32 2015 UTC,the ult will be fine as long as they remove the ridiculous cp scaling imo. wp joule ult damage feels fine to me.
vainglorygame,3a2g84,WSBowman,2,Tue Jun 16 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"Rather than this (more complex) change, I'd do the simple thing of tweaking (perhaps even reverting) some of the 1.4 buffs she got:   Laser charge-up time reduced from 1.0s to 0.6s. Telegraph time increased from 0.5s to 0.6s."
vainglorygame,3a2g84,osi42,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:16:36 2015 UTC,Do you think this would put a stop to CP Joules altogether or just force her to use her ult after a successful stun?
vainglorygame,3a2g84,keldegar,3,Tue Jun 16 19:23:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that increasing the telegraph makes it way easier to render CP Joule completely useless. That was the problem with old CP Joule, because people could easily stun it or move out of the way. I think reworking the Ult altogether would be better. No character should be able to eliminate a team with one skill. By focusing it down to a one person burst that also weakens the rest of the team if it hits, it makes it a little more...balanced imo."
vainglorygame,3a2g84,nyadav,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, it gives the enemy more reaction time. But that also puts more skill back in the skill shot. If you do it in a narrow corridor, the opportunity to move just isn't really there.  People were not complaining about CP Joule prior to 1.5. And the big change in 1.5 was the new Broken Myth.  If there was more reaction time, people would have the opportunity to get partially or fully out of the way, which would make shield a more viable counter. (When your shield might save you from 1 or 2 ticks but not all 3)."
vainglorygame,3a2g84,keldegar,2,Tue Jun 16 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to fix Joule's ult.  1) Make the damage split among heroes it hits. If it hits more heroes, each one takes less damage.   2) Or keep it the same, but have damage increase per tick. Kind of like a turret. first tick does 20% of damage, then 33%, then the last tick does 47%"
vainglorygame,3a2g84,nyadav,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:21:13 2015 UTC,"For 1) because of the way this laser appears, this wouldn't really make since it is just a solid beam of damage  For 2) I like this except in reverse, CP joule still wants to be a burst hero so you'd want the highest percent tick to go first and decrease from there. This would still allow enemies who at least dodge one tick to still not get completely demolished, while not taking away the majority of damage from her ult in this type of build."

You know the type; this is the player who gives continuous orders to the rest of the team (usually stupid ones) for the entire match.  He pinged so frequently he had to constantly be on cooldown, and he didn't stop even during frantic full blown team fights.  He was using his abilities and moving and fighting and somehow still continuously pinging.  He was terrible, but I was mesmerized by his ability to both fight and ping brain-damaged orders at the same time.  I should have known he was bad news; having a player name that is a misspelled version of an opiate wasn't promising.  Even though we won (in spite of the general and his moronic orders) and his ping multitasking skills were incredible, I had to add him to my list of toxic douchenozzles to dodge if I get teamed with him again in solo queue."

Accept he wouldn't let me get a single jungle kill. He stole ALL the jungle creeps. I was pinging sad face because I didn't know what to do. I bought contract and then tried to follow him but that didn't work either.   Second game I locked taka he hovered krul and locked and I thought great. A roam support. Came into game. He expected me (taka) to be the support. I was again pinging ??? But I didn't want to lose again so I went support -.- full tank taka. Tanka?? Anyway. So stupid. Be barley won.  Man my luck with krul is horrible lately.
vainglorygame,3a1ak6,jatatcdc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"I was playing support ardan and like he was trying to ""teach me how to use a contract"" like I know to let you last hit stfu.

Worst of all, I've seen them follow the recommended build...  My tip is to never let someone play Krul in solo queue. There's a 99% chance that their build will be so garbage that you will actually begin to weep."

vainglorygame,3a5al8,Ares-2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:30:45 2015 UTC,"IMO the most important difference is the map. The jungle is very important in Vainglory. The lane is static and most of the time matches are won or lost in the jungle. You can deny farm in the jungle, but not in lane. Jungler and support have to decide if they rotate up in lane to gank, or if they invade. Laners have to decide if they stay in lane as much as possible to be a real late game hard carry or how often they rotate down to help in the jungle. IMO the goldmine is more important than the kraken. A 300g payout is 900g for your team if Kraken destroys 2 turrets its 300 gold for your team. (23003 - 500*3; but also pressure on the lane)"
vainglorygame,3a5al8,Tsar_MapleVG,2,Wed Jun 17 12:04:30 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the gold mine being insanely important, unfortunately my teams seem to not understand that when it's nearly full you need to grab that shit Asap or defend it... Plus people never ever seem to understand that as a support I should tank jungle stuff ect, at the start of like every game I get pinged away from the camps ect because I'm standing with them, very frustrating at times"
vainglorygame,3a2dt5,FightasticMG,4,Tue Jun 16 18:13:24 2015 UTC,So unfriend them. Or just keep rejecting party invites.  I don't think they'll be as torn up about it as you seem to be.  Everyone on my list is just randoms anyway

If I unfriend them, there could probably be some consequences outside of Vainglory in regards to our relationships, or kind of make it a little awkward. I'm pretty sure there are others in the same boat.  I've told the certain people multiple times that I'm busy or that I'm trying to tier up, but it just doesn't help.   EDIT: Not to mention I do enjoy playing with them on my smurfs and I do occasionally get on my smurf when they ask maybe once a week, but having to deal with this every day is slightly annoying. It's kind of like why people requested offline modes on Facebook back when people actually used FB."

At least one where you don't care about Elo. you can use that account to teach them and get them to improve, and if there's a skill tier difference, just explain to them that if they are more than a full skill tier lower than you, then no one in your team will get enough elo to make worthwhile.

The problem was that most parents didn't understand it and couldn't help their kids.  I just think its pretty hard to implement this nation wide here, people have enough problems with the systems we have.  I wish we would though."

vainglorygame,3a1eyj,fmaBlots,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"Think of items as having a potential damage output.   Would you do more damage going full WP with no defensive items on Glaive? No. You would do less damage because you'd just get one shot.  Now with serpents mask it's the same thing, just trickier.  Do you have a fountain? Do they have more fountains? Are they tankier? Those are factors that change the length of a team fight. The longer the team fight, the longer YOU have to stay alive, making Serpents mask a pretty good pick in that situation."

vainglorygame,3a1eyj,jklick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:36:52 2015 UTC,its not as gold efficient.   a bunch of tier 2s will never be as efficient as their tier 3 full built items.  plus serpents mask can yield you more health (total) than some defense items if you can kite.
vainglorygame,3a1eyj,glStelar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"Some rough thoughts:   When measuring the gold efficiency of an item, you need to so by comparing similar statistics; otherwise, you're comparing apples to oranges. Make sure the objective of your theorycrafting is consistent across items. Are you trying to do deal more damage or are you trying to sustain yourself in team fights? Is SB more gold efficient for damage? Yes. Is SB more gold efficient for lifesteal? No. Math often doesn't trump reality. If you need the sustain in team fights, no amount of math is going to change that. There is, however, the potential that if you went with a Sorrowblade, the additional damage could allow you to burst your opponents down before they can kill you and then you could regen off of the ace buff instead."

vainglorygame,39ym7n,SugarVenomSEMC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:32:27 2015 UTC,Thank you!! Though hanging out in the Fold basement is hardly work.
vainglorygame,39ym7n,RaifetheRenegade,6,Thu Jun 18 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"I was actually just wondering about this. I have a feeling the SEMC team is saving her story for a new hero or a huge lore reveal. For a few reasons.  First, in the Hero Spotlight video for Catherine, Ciderhelm introduces her as a ""ronin stormguard"". iOS definition of ronin is:(in feudal Japan) a wandering samurai who had no lord or master.   SPOILERS FOR ARDAN LORE FOLLOW  Next, we know from 'Catherine's Mission' that the Storm Queen indicated that she wanted Julia left alive. Her words were: ""There are laws against royal murder, no matter how justified...I should execute you where you stand for suggesting it.""  Then, in 'Impossible Decision', Catherine disobey this and murders Julia. ""'Such a Shame,' whispered Catherine as she pressed her sword against Julia's chest"" and three heartbeats later, Julia's light is extinguished.  What I found odd about Julia's murder is Catherine's relative indifference towards the twins. They were her primary target after all. She could have easily snuck in and taken the twins while Ardan & Julia were distracted fighting thus completing her mission without disobeying the Storm Queen.   Finally, there's no mention of Catherine in 'Vanguard Up!', 'Escape to the Fold: Part 1', or 'Escape to the Fold: Part 2' even though the Stormguard are present. From 'Vanguard Up!': ""White-clothed Stormguard...10 years...still the Storm Queen would risk her best soldiers..."". Why would the Captain of the Guard not be there?  All this seems to point to some kind of break between the Storm Queen and Catherine. Maybe we'll receive lore about the same story from her POV or a flashback of when she was recruited to see what happened. My main theory right now is she's allied with the Technologists out of necessity and this will cause conflict with the Family Trio and Gythians later."
vainglorygame,39ym7n,peterkeats,2,Tue Jun 16 00:36:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for remembering this. I don't know if there's speculation out there as to what the rift was between Cath and the Storm Queen, and what happened between Cath and Julia, but 10 years have passed. I'm sure we'll see the continuation of it soon.  Cath is described as a former Stormguard I think in her game description.   Keep in mind that /u/SugarVenomSEMC expressed regret that Cath was taken in such a bad light after Cath allegedly killed Julia. I have my theories.   Catherine is innocent! Innocent, I say! Pure and beautiful and innocent! Down with the Storm Queen!"
vainglorygame,39ym7n,peterkeats,2,Tue Jun 16 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"Did she? I kind of looked at her negatively too after the lore, saw her as evil.  I like her though, every story needs a villain."
vainglorygame,39ym7n,RaifetheRenegade,2,Tue Jun 16 01:43:43 2015 UTC,It was during the live Friday twitch feed some time after the Ardan lore dropped. She said she'd address it eventually ...
vainglorygame,39ym7n,SugarVenomSEMC,2,Tue Jun 16 03:42:23 2015 UTC,"Wow you really did your research catching and researching the ""Ronin Stormguard"" part.  I did figure that she wasn't on good terms with the queen adn she wasn't in any of the other lores so I did kind of think another hero would come of it.  Devs have kind of hinted at the fact more heroes may come form there lores eventually, but  think they just want to open the world up a little bit more first."
vainglorygame,39ym7n,eh-blank-space,2,Tue Jun 16 01:40:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah I enjoy looking for connections in the lore to see if it's about new heroes or story implications. I'm just eager to see how things play out.
vainglorygame,39zni2,plybianz,2,Tue Jun 16 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"If I'm playing Ardan I think my strongest builds tend to be the ones where I'm extremely tanky. A fountain plus a crucible/fountain plus a atlas/metal jacket/aegis and potentially another tier 3 if it's a long game. Somewhere after the third, if I have a mainly CP team, I love building a breaking point because at that point i'm basically indestructible in team fights and I go from dealing negligent damage to really dishing out DPS. With catherine I don't tend to build as tanky because it's harder to reach that indestructible stage, and I usually build an aftershock or something around 2/3 tier 3 defence items."
vainglorygame,39zni2,NothingDoom,2,Tue Jun 16 03:52:43 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, I realise that it's probably not the smartest thing to do. Thanks for the advice! I guess I've always liked it because I often bait enemies into ganks or into attacking me during team fights by running in with low health (when in reality I'm very tanky.) It works fairly well in lower tiers, but you're probably right about focusing on team wide protection."
vainglorygame,39zni2,NothingDoom,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:34:12 2015 UTC,I like your style! I personally love to build towards mobility after my second health item. Warhorn and shiversteel are spectacular on Ardan due to the fact that his Blood for Blood counts as a basic attack (Ganks all day). Also it seems like there's a slight resurgence of Saw so a warhorn can't hurt his cause!
vainglorygame,39zni2,Lebrontasaurus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:50:04 2015 UTC,I really need to begin experimenting more with warhorn and shiversteel. Thanks for the advice.
vainglorygame,39zni2,NothingDoom,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"It depends. On Catherine, once I feel like I have enough tank and need to build damage, I do it. I have to be super survivable against the other team at that point. The earliest would be 2.5 tier three defense items, plus travel boots. These days, likely Warhorn, Fountain, and half way to Atlas Pauldron or another Fountain.   My go-to offensive items are either Aftershock for high-HP opponents, Bonesaw if I want to tear down turrets, or Breaking Point if I'm feeling very invulnerable and aggressive."
vainglorygame,39zni2,peterkeats,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:10:39 2015 UTC,"Extremely tanky. If the game is pretty equal-ish i'll build at least 4 defense items on my support -- usually two fountains, an atlas (vs WP vox/taka/krul), and a crucible"

vainglorygame,39xdkv,Glory_DrEvil,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:30:25 2015 UTC,I wonder if it would be less toxic to use the Caution on home base then the Go on the jungle shop?  Avoids using the ? Since everyone hates it so much.
vainglorygame,39xdkv,vanillaacid,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:08:59 2015 UTC,Well it might be because they want to shop and are out of energy or more likely (at least if you're playing with me) it's because there is not enough jungle vision and they fear being ganked while they shop. I've opted for the long walk of shame because either my spidey sense is tingling or I'd rather not get ganked at the jungle shop for the 5th time this game… Hopefully you have better spidey sense than me :/
vainglorygame,39xdkv,tehkyy,2,Mon Jun 15 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Ya, there is also the point that depending on vision, match phase, etc. it may not be worth the risk to go down to the jungle and get ganked."
vainglorygame,39xdkv,Kraken_SEMC,2,Mon Jun 15 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, it was just a bad match up. I'd check for all those before pinging. Talked to him after the match and explained it to him. He just didn't consider the time saving when shopping in jungle.  Also for clarification, i only did it the first couple of times. When I saw him do it a third time I figured it just his way of playing and it's easier to explain outside the match than in the middle."

Better to have made a slightly poor decision with regard to what you bought rather than spend 30 seconds at base and buy the perfect countering item. Don't leave your teammates in a 2v3 situation.  That is the goal. Buy your item fast as possible and get to fighting. Also, ping as much as humanly possible without damaging your control. People need to communicate to win."

If your teammates are in a 2v3 situation, perhaps playing defensively over playing aggressively might be the wiser choice overall, and picking the proper counter-item will allow the buyer to forcefully make that 3v3 a 3v2."

vainglorygame,39xdkv,nyadav,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:27:09 2015 UTC,i do main Taka :)
vainglorygame,3a25k0,Lebrontasaurus,5,Tue Jun 16 17:17:23 2015 UTC,"CP Joule is OP for sure but there are two ways to counter it -  1) If there's a catherine or a taka on your team, they need to dash close to it and stay in range. Taka can deal massive DPS to the Joule and when he hits BRB, Taka can flip over and run.  Catherine can practically babysit the Joule and the second a good Cath sees the red outline on the ground, a stun should go off. Most Joules don't build reflex block.  2) Don't stay in a straight line. I know this is hard for solo queuers, but even if one person stays alive they can potentially kill the Joule or run to avoid the game swinging ace. Position yourselves to where you split the Joule away from his team or kill the Joule first.  Those are the two ways to counter Joule however yeah, he need to be nerfed."
vainglorygame,3a25k0,FightasticMG,3,Tue Jun 16 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"Unless they fix BRB's hitbox, that's not a good strategy for Taka. Kaiten lands him in the hitbox, so he'll take one tick on initiation and the third on landing. He can dodge one tick, but it usually only takes two to kill him. Even if he can run after, his health will be low enough for a support to pick him off. Even reflex blocking the last tick is rarely enough to save him. X-Retsu puts him outside of BRB's range, but it has no i-frames so he'll take at least one tick on the way in. Fixing the hitbox would make a huge difference though. Because Joule has less defense in the back, BRB should be a huge risk because it leaves her open. Right now her ult makes her invulnerable to melee heroes because the laser hits behind her. That makes no sense and it's why BRB still feels really unbalanced."
vainglorygame,3a25k0,SunOsprey,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, you usually get a speed buff right after you use the flip. I normally just run until it comes off -- at least whenever I'm able to actually execute this strategy."
vainglorygame,3a25k0,FightasticMG,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:30:35 2015 UTC,"I think one of the coolest things about this game is how the meta changes when different balence implementations are made. Like how Catherines showing up in almost every match to counter the Joule meta is a really cool facet of the game. So even when something seems a little off, the devs have put in enough work to offset it with the various different specialties of different heroes!"
vainglorygame,3a25k0,nyadav,0,Tue Jun 16 22:20:01 2015 UTC,"Catherine is both a part of the problem and the solution in the Joule meta which is annoying. She enables Joule by having a point and click stun on a short cd, and she counters Joule by using her point and click stun to stop Joule's ult. It's pretty interesting actually haha"
vainglorygame,3a25k0,Jajajack14,4,Tue Jun 16 22:49:45 2015 UTC,"We've all been frustrated (read: decimated) by this Big Red Button, however unlike skaarf and Vox in previous patches, I really wouldn't classify Joule as broken. Unfortunately, she is highly popular in lower/mid tiers where countering Heros is less common, however if you look at higher tiered games (VGL/ESL) You see teams are doing fine without her even when she isn't banned, similarly teams are chosing not to ban her and do fine when she is played. Look at skaarf- that worm was banned in 90% of competetive matches in 1.4. I understand the frustration and sometimes it feels as if the BRB is unavoidable, however watching higher tier players play around it can teach you a lot!"
vainglorygame,3a25k0,WSBowman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"It can be frustrating for sure but are ways to counter it. Look at Unknown v. Kollab in ESL; Iraqi was CP Joule and Kollab still lost pretty badly. To melt all 3, Joule has got to line up your entire team. Don't let that happen! Save your stuns. Use a Taka to flip over it. Get creative. It's not a perfect solution but it can help alleviate that frustration."
vainglorygame,3a25k0,eh-blank-space,3,Tue Jun 16 17:33:05 2015 UTC,Takas flip doesn't work on joule. You still get 2/3 ticks because she moves backwards.
vainglorygame,3a25k0,WSBowman,2,Tue Jun 16 17:45:08 2015 UTC,"Actually I like doing it from the side and force her to decide which teammate(s) of mine to focus down. Then as she's going back wards, you can crit strike and kite without worrying about taking ticks of damage."

vainglorygame,39v1yl,FollowMyRuin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, I get the idea of The contract now, but if you're not actively killing stuff in the jungle, won't you level up slower?"
vainglorygame,39v1yl,BrianGlory,2,Mon Jun 15 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"Whether in lane or jungle, you gain 66% of the experience for dealing the last hit and 33% for being nearby. This means that if you're doing your job effectively as a support, you will level slower than your jungler.   Your jungler will hit level 2 before you do When your jungler hits level 4, you'll probably be just hitting level 3. When you're jungler is level 7, you'll probably be around level 5. And so on.   This is okay though. Your objective is to get your jungler as powerful as possible. If possible, you want both your jungler and laner to be able to do TONS of damage.  An ideal support hero tends to excel without having a lot of gold or levels. Also, defensive items (which are core to support builds) are more gold efficient than offensive items. It was intentionally designed this way by SEMC."
vainglorygame,39zxa1,hiphoptomato,3,Tue Jun 16 03:32:03 2015 UTC,"I've sometimes been that jungler, it's situationally dependent. If you think you're teammates and a turret can hold off a push by the entire team, going for jungle creeps means one team is farming and the other team isn't. The motivation is to build your team a lead (and punish the other team for being overly aggressive by stealing their creeps). That said, if things look bad, then yeah, help defend the turret."
vainglorygame,39zxa1,filibustier,2,Tue Jun 16 08:56:23 2015 UTC,I'm confused. Are you targeting takas? Or anyone in jungle? Because I main taka and am kinda offended that you summarize us all like this and think your clever by making a meme out of it.   To be honest I find there isn't a particular hero that is more of an ass than others.   The only asses I see are you guys generalizing us because of one bad game.
vainglorygame,39zxa1,eh-blank-space,5,Tue Jun 16 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not exclusively a taka problem-- but there's a well-earned stigma associated with taka, in part because of his abilities.   Don't let yourself be defined by a character. You should be playing more than one proficiently anyway."
vainglorygame,39zxa1,zedsmith,2,Tue Jun 16 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"I see you play Taka a lot. This wasn't geared only towards Takas, it's just an issue I've come across with a lot of junglers lately. It was meant to be far more light hearted than I think you took it to be. We all make mistakes, I'm just venting."
vainglorygame,39zxa1,eh-blank-space,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:59:14 2015 UTC,Alright then. It's forgiven. And I agree with you. I just don't think it's a hero in general. I just had a krul go full support. Zero weapon items but stole all my jungle kills. I wanted to throw the phone.
vainglorygame,39zxa1,ChapterLiam,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:01:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really get this. My mains are Skaarf and Taka, and usually, I'm the one saving people in team fights.

I of course would like to think that I'm doing my best to be a positive team member, and it certainly seems that way given the fact that I usually see people honoring me post game, but maybe that's just my own selective bias.  As a player, I think it might be valuable to have some sort of bigger picture of how the community sees me. Perhaps someday SEMC will be able to offer profile pages, one version visible to the world, and one version visible to the player only where they are allowed to see things like percentage of players who report/honor them vs the average, and maybe other details like how often they win when they are the highest ranked person on the team vs lowest."

There might be a small gray area where it would lead to more toxicity probably around hotness/pg but imagine if you're low tier and see your ally is SA and wants to lane Joule, are you going to insist on taking her or are you going to say hey this guy is better than me I should let him have his pick.  I've been solo Qing a lot in recent days and my pick always gets taken. If I'm lucky, I'd get to jungle carry, but most games I had to play support because my allies weren't budging in hero select.

Because I was good at Krul, and I also had no idea that instalocking was bad. Only after several rounds of teammates hovering on characters and waiting for everyone else to do the same did I clue in on ""Oh, making sure we have a good team comp is actually useful.""  It's a process and not everyone browses Reddit and the forums and realizes that instalocking is bad. Instead of complaining on Reddit about instalockers and other ""toxic"" behavior, take a step back and realize that maybe they just don't know any better. Try and educate them!

vainglorygame,39uoxh,peterkeats,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:05:06 2015 UTC,"I hope they change this, but I understand how it might affect popular players with lots of ""friends"". Maybe it can be opt-in."
vainglorygame,39uoxh,Ares-2,2,Mon Jun 15 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"I like your mindset. I actually climbed to poa in a match with 2 laners.  It was the normal OP 1.4 Vox, Kosh, Skaarf comp, we logged in assuming that skaarf would go in the jungle. He didn't, but we had no ping wars, I bought an IC and Vox rotated a lot in the jungle. We stomped the other team and had a great match.  Adapting to different or new strategies is one of the most important skills in MOBAs, in my opinion."
vainglorygame,39uoxh,ShinakoX2,2,Sun Jun 14 23:41:14 2015 UTC,I kinda wish we had an ingame chat for situations like the first one.  Or so I could teach noobs what Ironguard Contract does
vainglorygame,39uoxh,KarmaAdjuster,2,Sun Jun 14 23:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah.... I've struggled to teach people how to use the IGC in game, and now I just wait to see how they treat the first jungle camp we encounter and then accept that this is how the game is going to go. Trying to teach someone how to use the contract in game is more likely to frustrate them and you and ruin any team harmony you might have had.  As for adding chat, I think SEMC has done the right thing with disallowing chat in game. The potential for harm is just way too great. There are just too many advantages to the ping only communication system. Sometimes when I go back to play LoL, I find myself missing Vainglory's ping system."
vainglorygame,39uoxh,Joemaloneyjoe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:22:00 2015 UTC,"I try to teach them through interaction about the contract. Can be frustrating for sure.   Usually, I just shadow them attacking their minions until just before the minion is killed then walk away. They kill the minion, we both get the little symbol above our heads and then give a thumbs up. Usually it's effective and we all get more gold."
vainglorygame,39uoxh,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"I've tried teaching people various mechanics about the game through the ping system as well, but due to the potential frustration, I try a little less hard now. If I see that they aren't getting it after the first time I try to explain, I just accept that this is how this game is going to go and do my best with the cards that I've been dealt. If they happen to add me post match, I'll explain via chat, but I find that trying to explain something more nuanced like when to take minion miners or how the contract works is more likely to destroy your team harmony than reinforce it."

Last game, I almost queue dodged because a player soft-, then auto locked Saw after the other player hovered over Krul. Then I let go of my preconceptions and chose Catherine. Won without losing a single turret. Sometimes you can get jaded being a solo queue ronin so it's important to take a step back before assuming things."
vainglorygame,39uoxh,VATigerfan,2,Sun Jun 14 23:59:38 2015 UTC,Great post. It's great to see a positive post on here from someone with self awareness. I grow tired of all the Decentish all stars that think everyone but themselves suck (if only they could team up with some other all stars they would be Vaingloruous in no time).  And those that have a few random matches with bad teammates and bitch and moan and exaggerate about having them every match.

It's fantastic when you're all defeated, the other team just got the Kracken. And then the surrender vote is two nos, then cheers or thumbs up pings from the whole team.  I had a 40 minute game once where we ended up winning, but had three surrender rallies. It was like 'hell no, we're going down swinging.'"
vainglorygame,39uoxh,KarmaAdjuster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hear you that different players may have different strategies, and sometimes, while those strategies may be different from your own, they can also be superior to your own. However, the ""strategy"" of ping spamming your teammates is never a valid strategy, even if your original plan was the best option. Also you can be a more skilled player and still be jerk. These aren't mutually exclusive. However if you are a jerk (especially one that ping spams teammates), you're going to have to work that much harder at carrying the team. Harassing your teammates just makes them play worse.  Also, while I am replying to your post with this comment, it isn't so much directed at you as it is directed towards other players who feel the need to ""?"" ping spam their teammates. Please. No one ever do this. There is NEVER a valid reason for it."
vainglorygame,39uoxh,monwidadan,0,Mon Jun 15 04:17:04 2015 UTC,This is the worst part of the very limited communication system in VG.
vainglorygame,39uoxh,ronslie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:47:06 2015 UTC,Very valid points in this thread.  The one thing that bothers me the most is after a game the need to add someone as a friend just to tell them to F-off and that they're terrible.  I think stuff like that is what generally turns people off.  I've more or less have stopped adding frds just to save the aggrevation.
vainglorygame,39uoxh,SaberSix_,0,Mon Jun 15 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"I like how you approached it but sometimes thinking logically isn't always going to help. I had a game where I was in lane and our jungler kept coming up to lane (not even to gank) but just to steal minions so I pinged him off once using the triangle one. Instead, he followed me around the entire game. When I would back, he would too. If I went to take a jungle camp he would steal it from me. There are people whose goal is to troll from the start. Maybe if we had more pings/a different want to communicate with people we could understand more what theyre trying to do or what they want"
vainglorygame,39x3js,creardon19,2,Mon Jun 15 14:43:50 2015 UTC,Yea that's sort of what I was thinking as well. They probably wouldn't release it before the tournament because that would be unfair to teams that prepared for it on 1.5
vainglorygame,39x3js,Nailo65,2,Mon Jun 15 14:53:22 2015 UTC,A lot of reddit speculation and general assumptions say they will try to drop it before July 4th so they can all relax for a bit.

Do you think great games are ones where you beat the crap out of the other team which gives no competition? Those are bad for them because they got embarrassingly stomped, and you because you learned nothing but how to brag.   The best games are competitive and close, no matter who wins."
vainglorygame,39yu61,peterkeats,3,Tue Jun 16 01:55:49 2015 UTC,SoloQ was bad for somebody there - just not you!
vainglorygame,39yu61,Peter_Rotten,2,Mon Jun 15 23:14:14 2015 UTC,Yeah super great if you were the other team.  That is the kind of comp that burns me out at the Hotness - PoA Tiers. When you get a Comp like Adagio and Skarf in their current state and it is so rare that they are played as effectively as other characters. I feel like if you choose the winning team based on comp you could be right a solid 80% of the time and that is sad. There was no way that other team was going to win unless the Skarf and Adagio were a hell of a lot better than the average Skaarf and and Adagio I keep getting.  I get that ppl don't want to just play the FOTM and Meta characters but team comps matter and it sucks when you end up on a team that can't compete.
vainglorygame,39yu61,ArjenKatiye,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:23:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. It really sucks when you get to character select and your teammates INSTANTLY pick their hero without any regard to the team comp. Such a frustrating waste of time.

vainglorygame,39xwki,MrTouchnGo,2,Mon Jun 15 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"That may be true in bigger subs, but /r/vainglorygame is pretty dang small, and almost all posts are quite visible."
vainglorygame,39xwki,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree that its small enough to have those post easily visible. Again in relation to my first reply, it saves the main sub from multiple posts asking about the same thing when most people frequenting here are checking for game content/news/updates. This benefits the player and moderators. As this sub grows, which i'm sure it will cause this games awesome, it'll only be more convenient."
vainglorygame,39xwki,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:40:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not against the sub. I'm just saying that right now, it's not necessary. Look at your own post - it's got negative points right now, and is still on the front page of the subreddit. In the future, as the player base and /r/vainglorygame grows, it'll be much more useful, but for now, those posts can easily fit on this subreddit."
vainglorygame,39xwki,MrTouchnGo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:30:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see how, by that logic, that the subreddit shouldn't exist. It's not a matter of whether the posts can fit, the whole point of the place is to have an area specifically for people to find others to play with and keep that separate from content of and about the game here. The two things do not need to be in the same place, and are only an inconvenience for each other. Yes it'll be even more useful as it grows, as I stated before, but it's still equally useful to people looking for others to play with right now."

Joule can still get a nice hit in with the first tick regardless, but only if she ulted smartly (while the enemy was stunned or in a difficult to move position) or if the opponent didn't buy boots, then the second and third ticks get their damage in. If you are smart, you are hurt but can avoid being destroyed by joule, but her ult isn't as useless as before."

Also more heroes, but that's just because it's a new game they'll come in time, and item sets, man id love that because as a new player finding items in the shop can be annoying haha, oh and the game needs a timer before it starts, say 30 seconds, because sometimes I look away for a moment, look back and I have to buy and move and by the time I do the games already in progress, since the movement time to get to the jungle or lane too, pretty annoying...

Say you are hotness and you get match with PG and Decentish well if you win 3 or 4 games your elo will rise only a little bit but if you lose to them than your elo will take a massive hit. vice versa, if you play against hotness gold and SA and win 3-4 games than you are likely to rise since you are beating players better ranked than you."

He just becomes a black cloud that moves around. His ult and Kaiten would be him projecting himself through his enemy. So when his skills happen you instantly see a frozen version of him on the other side and then his black cloud quickly meeting the other one becoming the real taka well the old one quickly vanishes into a cloud.   A guy can dream ;)

vainglorygame,39tpec,eh-blank-space,2,Sun Jun 14 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Getting many, many more matches lately like this, as well as ones where when an ally deserts they just sit in base and spam surrender (every minute.) Many times the 2 of us were perfectly capable of winning the game, but they had to be selfish about it. Wish there was a way to punish players like that. It should at least be treated as being AFK if you sit in the base during the game for an extended period of time.   http://imgur.com/lcc9XOe"

vainglorygame,39tpec,djcody,-1,Sun Jun 14 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"You only think people are trolls because you're getting better at the game. I myself have only encountered TWO OR THREE TRUE TROLLS in the game which didn't even cause my team to lose every time. The matchmaking system isn't bad, but remember you can always get cued with someone like a 7 year old and such, so they may not have a developed sense of teamwork and higher thinking, and that isn't SEMC's fault. They are merely trying to keep you with your tier. I think when causal cue comes around like they said in last dev stream the matchmaking problem will vastly shrink but never go away. Matchmaking is just part of any games that have team vs team and will always be partially flawed, especially considering the pool of players willing to play at the exact moment you want to. Give it time. The casual cue should alleviate a lot of the problems."
vainglorygame,39u8r1,Twiggled,4,Sun Jun 14 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"True damage Skaarf's burn deals crystal damage, so the % health is then mitigated by enemy shield Aftershock is also crystal damage. Basically, % health damage never guarantees that %, due to defenses. To guarantee a %, it would be called ""% health TRUE damage"", which currently does not exist in the game...because it's very hard to balance and has no defensible counters. The damage reflected by Cath bubble is BEFORE Cath's defenses. So as Catherine, buying defenses will not hurt your reflect damage."
vainglorygame,39u8r1,SurpriseBirthdaySEMC,2,Sun Jun 14 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"Can you end the debate about getting defense hit-points (like Oak Heart) and Catherine?  Is it worth it, or does it actually make her shield weaker?  Specifically I've seen people argue that her shield is less likely to reflect damage when you add to her health.  For example, if Catherine has 1000 health (numbers used for argument's sake and I'm too lazy to look up her actual health), her shield will reflect 100+ dmg, correct?  But if I buy an Oak Heart, she has 1200 health.  Will she now only reflect dmg over 120 points?"
vainglorygame,39u8r1,Peter_Rotten,3,Sun Jun 14 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"Isn't Cath's shield reflection based on concrete damage numbers (something like 80?) instead of a % health threshold now? I can't check the stats right now, but that's what I thought it was."

vainglorygame,39u8r1,Apathie2,2,Sun Jun 14 20:55:06 2015 UTC,Skaarf is not true damage. That's all I know though. That's why you always give three levels into his Ult because it provides pierce

vainglorygame,39sug3,_matrix,3,Sun Jun 14 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"Nice kda, good for you!  You will get to where you stop caring about kd ratio and only worry about winning, though.  I had a game yesterday where we lost the initial triple invade and then blundered into two early aces that put us way behind.  My team (solo queue randoms) pulled together and fought our way back into it, though, and turned it into a real game.  At the end of it, the enemy beat us on kills 33 - 20.  They out-farmed us as well, 26,581 to 23,113 gold.  The other team's Ardan went 4/8/12, their Skaarf went 12/4/14, and their Krul went 17/8/10.  My team's kdas were pretty sorry.  Our Petal went 5/8/9, our Glaive went 9/13/10 and I played an underfunded, roaming, got-behind-early Joule and went 6/12/10.    We all had negative kd ratios, and we were out-killed and out-farmed by a solid margin, but we got the win.  The other team had better stats all around, but they lost elo and we gained it, we got more glory from the match and they got less.  Winning counts; kda is an interesting set of stats that don't matter a whit in the end if you lose.  Screenshot that shows just how bad my team sucked, based on kda, yet we won (in reality we were very organized in the second half of the game, and we pushed in the right spots at the right times):  http://i.imgur.com/KhAEkCi.jpg"

vainglorygame,39sjut,setchy,4,Sun Jun 14 10:03:05 2015 UTC,"For Krul, generally you rush attack speed (blazing salvo), then build defense items, and you finish a Breaking Point, Bonesaw, or Tornado Trigger. Life steal is pretty bad on him because his innate life steal is just so much higher that additional life steal is pretty worthless. For energy, hourglass -> chronograph is ideal (because of the cooldown acceleration) but if you need more energy, build battery instead.   Cards are for weaving skins. You can see card requirements for skins in the market.   Level doesn't really do anything at the moment besides handing out cards at specific levels. However, it will likely become more important in the next update.   And yes, matchmaking tries to match you against people with the same skill tier as you."

vainglorygame,39sjut,BaconGobblerT_T,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can save 1.600 gold if you only buy t1 boots. A very popular Krul Build starts with 2x Blazing Salvo, t1 boots and shiversteel. It costs 3,15k gold and you get +70% atk speed, +500hp, the shiversteel slow and a bit more mobility. If you buy t3 boots for 1.900 gold a Blazing Salvo and a minions foot you spend 3k gold. You have less attack speed and no slow. You can buy the t2 boots after your 2nd t3 item if you want the mobility. Mobility is great but you don't need that much in the early game."
