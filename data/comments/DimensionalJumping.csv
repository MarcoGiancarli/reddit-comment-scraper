DimensionalJumping,3e3fe4,Pixelsummoner,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:53:10 2015 UTC,In one post from /R/nosleep (before this sub existed) someone mentioned jumping multiple times and the one jump he lost his dad. When jumping you can gain something by losing something else from the past dimension. It's the risk you have to take.

However, it doesn't have to.  There is an infinite matrix of possible events. It's all too possible to jump into a different trajectory without actually changing anything in what you'd consider your memory of the past or the record you're keeping of the events of the world, such as your reddit post history. In fact, such continuity-preserving jumps tend to be the easiest to start with in order to prove to oneself whether this timey-wimey-jumpey thing one read on the internet is actually legitimate or if it's some elaborate digital prank.   It can be counter intuitive to think about at first, but... History? Time? Linearity? Cause & Effect? Such concepts melt in the face of multi-dimensional thoughts."
DimensionalJumping,3dwj4e,Pixelsummoner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:18:34 2015 UTC,I would say you need to keep in mind that all versions of you are very very similar and exist at the same time.  Therefore when you do jump most of everything may be the same including your post history.  The differences are going to be a word or sentence here and there but when you go back through your post history yo wont notice that.

DimensionalJumping,3du9dh,singularity_pet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"Not solipsism, because ""you"" aren't actually a person, what you are is a conscious perspective that is ""before"" the experience of separation. There's not ""only you"" because you are in effect taking on the shape of all people; it's just that your sensory experience is from a particular vantage point.  In effect we experience a private copy of the world, and so does ""everyone else"". The nature of the overlap between us isn't like the sharing of an ""environment"", it's more like the sharing of a ""resource"", a toy box of possible patterns and experiences.   This is  difficult to describe in words, because in this view space and time are parts of experiencing - so we can't actually talk about different perspectives being located relative to each other or occurring at the same or different times, but language presupposes such ""parts"" and ""locations"".  The Hall of Records metaphor is one way to approach it. Basically, all conscious perspectives will turn out to be the same perspective in the end."

So if I think as if I'm back to a point before this thing, or think as if this event never did happen...   As you see and u/TriumphantGeorge said below, those are the very same thing, because the reason why we want to make changes in the past is because we want to be in a different situation right now, and whether it would be made possible by going back in time and changing a couple of things or by deciding right now that the things have always been that way, your desire would be fulfilled anyway: right now you would have a different set of memories and you would be living a different outcome.  If something you want to change is only one single event that you clearly remember, then you might want to experiment the revise and repeal technique of Neville Goddard, it's in his workbook The Law and The Promise:   Man and his past are one continuous structure. This structure contains all of the facts which have been conserved and still operate below the threshold of his surface mind.  For him it is merely history. For him it seems unalterable — a dead and firmly fixed past. But for itself, it is living — it is part of the living age. He cannot leave behind him the mistakes of the past, for nothing disappears. Everything that has been is still in existence. The past still exists, and it gives — and still gives — its results. Man must go back in memory, seek for and destroy the causes of evil, however far back they lie.  This going into the past and replaying a scene of the past in imagination as it ought to have been played the first time, I call revision — and revision results in repeal.   Changing your life means changing the past. The causes of any present evil are the unrevised scenes of the past. The past and the present form the whole structure of man; they are carrying all of its contents with it. Any alteration of content will result in an alteration in the present and future."
DimensionalJumping,3dfl7a,invisiblemongoose,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"I think I get what you're saying.  In order to change my past, I could ""Travel back in time"" so to speak and relive the past and change events ""manually"".  Or I could get in the mindset that those things I'm trying to change already happened how I want them to.  But either way, I'll get the same result? Edit: By same result I mean that my outcome would be different from the one I'm experiencing right now.  My present then will be different from what it is now."
DimensionalJumping,3dfl7a,Aroha11,2,Thu Jul 16 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"If you have an idea, and you probably have, of specifically how you could have avoided or changed the particular event you have in mind, so yes, the result will be the same, because either way you will be thinking from the idea of how-it-should-have-been or what-I-should-have-done in order to get a different outcome, and the whole change in your present reality will be primarily caused by that change in that specific event."
DimensionalJumping,3dfl7a,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:37:08 2015 UTC,"I see.  I'll probably try to travel back then and fix it manually, as it's easier for me to manifest a thought of that, than to think about it as it should have gone.

DimensionalJumping,3deg35,anonymous_being,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:54:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm.    The definition of forgiveness varies by person.  In my opinion, however, ""forgiveness"" is not something that can be forced.  It is something that naturally has to repair itself over time if given the reason.     With that said, no one has the right to truly judge the heart and mind of another.  However, if you do not trust someone to be honest and fair with you, you should be honest about it with them and not try to pretend otherwise."
DimensionalJumping,3deg35,olololoy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:35:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean that someone who has done wrong shouldn't be punished, or at least stopped. It only means that you are releasing yourself from this person and the painful memories they have caused on you. It's more like freeing yourself from them. No more ties.   By the way, you can heal yourself if you open your heart chakra (not abruptly, by meditation, by balancing your charkras with time). And forgiveness is a good start. I once tried to forgive during meditation, and I felt some pressure in my ears. I don't know if it was resistance, since I still had feelings of unfairness deep inside; but setting the intention is always good. It starts a process, and this process is mainly works in unconscious/subconscious. So, with time you can heal yourself."

You can't just evade them that way.  You would be better to start work healing it.  Chronic illnesses point to consistent, long-term denial of a problem in your life.  That's why it's chronic.  You have to face it eventually."

DimensionalJumping,3deg35,uhasnicelegs,2,Wed Jul 15 21:34:58 2015 UTC,It might be a fine point to you but let me ask this:  Are you seeing this (that reality is determined by mentality) or is that what you've just read here?  To me there's a rather vast difference.  Is this demonstrated to you otherwise in your life so that you're gaining this understanding otherwise as well?
DimensionalJumping,3deg35,uhasnicelegs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"It is something I've begun to start seeing recently (can also be attributed to mentality). Like if I am at a red light and I begin to think it will turn green, it does, not because I have the power to change stoplights but because the way my thoughts were working at the light were towards it changing and not wondering when it was going to change.

When performing the technique, I see the blackness enveloping me and can kind of see my reflection move but I don't really notice anything different in the universe (i.e. a different tag number).  On the other hand, I have no clue exactly how this works if what I'm jumping for is a personality change. I have been going out more for the purpose of meeting girls during the day and to eliminate my anxiety while talking to girls. The feeling to do this was always there but now I feel more motivated to do so. Maybe that's an indicator for how it works.  There's no pressure to do this, but if you could, could you share what exactly you are changing about your life? Whether it be a material or emotional change?"

DimensionalJumping,3cl5sg,Ramo796,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think that the reason life might seem shittier is because your particular focus on your doppleganger was to be thinner which in turn manifested by the amount of weight you lost the next morning.  What I'm saying is, you might have bit off more than you could chew by jumping with all of these changes you wanted in mind especially during the first jump. Usually, when beginning dimensional jumping, it's recommended that you start with one thing you want to change at a time. In this case, the only thing you were able to change was your weight."

DimensionalJumping,3cd3kw,SacredRose1024,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:17:35 2015 UTC,"From elsewhere   The notion is that when you make a change to the pattern of your experienced world, it shifts as a whole. If you write down an ""anchor number"" or ""universe ID"" then perhaps when you generate a shift, that might shift too. If it did shift then you'd know for certain. (If it didn't you couldn't tell either way, except from other observed changes.)  So the number itself has no inherent meaning, necessarily; it's a change of number that matters."
DimensionalJumping,3cd3kw,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:06:35 2015 UTC,"So I should write down any arbitrary number on a slip of paper and keep it in my wallet.

DimensionalJumping,3bymc6,WoolenWolf,3,Fri Jul 3 05:44:27 2015 UTC,"See sidebar link for non-mirror methods, particularly Neville Goddard.  Daydreamy detachment plus strong intention is the basis for all so-called techniques for redirecting your experience. That's what you did. And you got what you asked for (your SO to ""show his affection more readily"").  You might want to recall how exactly you thought about this.  The problem is, you need to be pretty clear about what you want to happen - because in general it will (seem to) happen by using whatever other patterns are contributing to your life, providing a ""plausible story"". In this case, your SO recognising ""anxiety"" and that recognition being the springboard to release and express his feelings.  So - what do you want to change now? Be very specific about it."
DimensionalJumping,3buo28,jminnie01,5,Thu Jul 2 08:11:41 2015 UTC,"So - it's about dramatically changing your experience rather than literally traveling somewhere else, although the experience can be ""as if"" that happened.  It's like every object and person in your experience is an aspect of an Extended Object or Extended Person. By shifting, you are seeing other aspects of things (be that Reddit or Yer Maw) which may or may not be preferable. A good reason to carefully decide what you're trying to change, then!  See The Hall of Records metaphor for another way to think about ""selecting desired experiences"".  Sure, there's no going back - but there's no going back to yesterday either. Even if you time-travelled back to yesterday, you would now be different so you wouldn't actually be returning to the same state. You just continue forward towards a better experience.  Meanwhile, the numbers thing is just an idea: If that number did change, then things obviously shifted. However, lots of changes could occur and that number would be the same.

I don't want to leave some people behind for their copies but there is some stuff I'm hoping to find the truth to. Sorry if this didn't answer your question, also correct me if I'm wrong."
DimensionalJumping,3buo28,mztw777,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:33:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. :)
DimensionalJumping,3buo28,inspectoralex,6,Thu Jul 2 08:37:28 2015 UTC,"There is no reason not to leave, there are billions of 'dimensions' where your parents for example are exactly the same, with the mirror method some 'jumps' are just not good coordinated, this is the reason why I choose a more precise way (look at the links in the sidebar). There are no copies of people, people in other 'dimensions' are as real or unreal as in your current world. So you can't get back to your 'home dimension'? Still no problem, you can go to a dimension where everything is the same as your home dimension but for example you just own a pair of socks more."
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,Default_Admin,9,Thu Jul 2 01:16:59 2015 UTC,"So... things got a whole lot worse, how?"
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,NinjaJellyfish,3,Thu Jul 2 13:10:06 2015 UTC,I'd really rather not get into it just incase someone knows my reddit account. But let's just say it involves a pregnancy and I'm not the father.
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,alkemical,4,Thu Jul 2 16:24:40 2015 UTC,Perhaps...Perhaps...this is an event that sucks now...but is way better from a future standpoint.
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,KallistiTMP,3,Thu Jul 2 20:07:59 2015 UTC,Perhaps you're right. I can see that in the end this will result in a happier me. But it's causing me lots of distress currently.
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,OfficialGameCubed,2,Thu Jul 2 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's entirely possible you just jumped from a dimension where she was still cheating on you, but the baby was yours and you just got roped into a lifetime of child support payments and/or a hateful relationship raising a kid with baby momma. And then jumped to a dimension where, after cutting her off, you meet a much better woman."
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,TriumphantGeorge,3,Wed Jul 8 09:02:39 2015 UTC,Damn
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,BloodyEyeProductions,4,Thu Jul 2 16:44:25 2015 UTC,"(Don't worry about the number thing. The thought people had fun with early on is that if you used an ""anchor number"" and after a jump it changed, you'd definitely know you'd shifted your experience. But of course, there's no particular reason the number should be one of the changes that happen!)"
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:34:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks George. It probably won't affect me much, but I did write it down and put it in my wallet. Just to see if it works. I plan to jump again eventually."
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,steelgreen,5,Thu Jul 2 06:04:24 2015 UTC,Poor thing... I hope everything turns out okay for you.
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,Wolverent,3,Thu Jul 2 17:35:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it likely will. But I had no intentions of getting a divorce at 20 years old."
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,steelgreen,2,Thu Jul 2 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"That's crappy. But on the other hand, no matter how things play out, better it shakes itself out now than after 10-15 years."
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,King_Groovy,3,Fri Jul 3 10:19:01 2015 UTC,Jupiter/Venus thing?
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,King_Groovy,7,Thu Jul 2 02:50:20 2015 UTC,Jupiter and Venus are closer to each other now than any point in the last 3000 years or something
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,jminnie01,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:47:46 2015 UTC,Jupiter/Venus thing?
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,mztw777,6,Thu Jul 2 02:49:58 2015 UTC,They got close to each other. It's been all over reddit. It wasn't happening before.
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,King_Groovy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:30:10 2015 UTC,what number do you have and what number did you have before you jumped?
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,King_Groovy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:12:21 2015 UTC,I guess I forgot to write down a number.
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,King_Groovy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"well you're in 982 now. Write it down on a slip of paper and put it in your wallet, glove box, sock drawer, porn stash, or wherever. The next time you jump, the number will chnage"
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,ThePikafan01,3,Thu Jul 2 04:02:50 2015 UTC,I've lived in 982 my whole life and I never plan to leave. :)
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,sinwarrior,3,Thu Jul 2 08:04:32 2015 UTC,"You can't be sure, I have never (knowningly) jumped, but before I moved out and was going to the university this sub was called dimension jump and not dimensional jumping (at least for me)"
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,loggedIn123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:37:30 2015 UTC,"What? I thought I made up a number, do the universes have numbers?  edit: Maybe in my previous universe the number was personal. I don't remember a specific number ever."
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,sinwarrior,2,Thu Jul 2 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"look over at the sidebar.... 982 is where you are. I have a specific number I'm searching for as well. When I make my first jump, I will be jumping until I find it"
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,loggedIn123,2,Thu Jul 2 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of people in this sub more knowledgeable than I when it comes to jumping. I've not made my first jump yet, but I think that may happen soon.  But I did make a thread about numbers when I first found this sub. Check it out HERE. I hope this can help you"
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,sinwarrior,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:15:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. I checked it out and I wish I knew what number I had before this. But I don't think in my previous universe there was a designated number.
DimensionalJumping,3btlpp,BlueAnt138,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:21:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it. The way I understand it is that the number is just an anchor point to let you know where you are today instead of relying on any change you think you've noticed. The most innoculous things can seem so significant when you're searching for significance.
DimensionalJumping,3bu9f9,Amariel_,5,Thu Jul 2 05:05:32 2015 UTC,"Be sure to read the stuff in the link in the sidebar.  Generally: keep your intentions clear and framed in a what-you-want rather than a what-you-don't want light. If you can imagine your current experience (the 3D sensory world right now, including the room and your body) dissolving and being replaced by one where  what you want has already happened, then that's a good guide."
DimensionalJumping,3bu9f9,TriumphantGeorge,5,Thu Jul 2 05:32:13 2015 UTC,"It seems to follow basic ritual principles, so if you get the mindset down you can do it anywhere, but this one is a hardcore version because it dissociates you from everything, allowing a larger sphere of influence. Are we jumping, IDK, it could just be LoA style stuff on crack unleashed. A buddy of mine died the day after I ""jumped"", not a super close friend, but one I really admired and will miss, this in turn lead me on a chain reaction which destroyed my depression, and gave me new passions to life, also some changes in relationship goals. Did my actions lead to his death, no, and it happened post jump, but the desired outcome came about. So its a shitty means justify the ends question, you have to decide what's more important to you I guess. On top of that the whole gay marriage thing popped up fast and I've been given a lot more interesting and fun jobs at work. Is this a better universe? Maybe. Is my personal existence better even considering the cost? Yes. I wasn't tied down, I wanted the change at all costs, you can find a home in any reality, if you're adaptable. Depends. First a quick surprisingly relevant video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_qvy82U4RE Finally here: you don't even need to jump; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/01/kevin-smith-weight-loss_n_7704282.html He didn't even exercise really. Ok I think you need to make very specific rules, otherwise you could be visiting a funeral where a buddy died from a heart attack or something (not joking). I jumped with the rules, anything goes. At the time, I was resolute. But it truly does mean anything goes. If you have something you want to hang on to, you have to include it in the rules. I assume the more strict the rules, the more difficult it is, because it becomes a larger more intricate jump. The way you make a larger jump is by releasing yourself from your current reality more, it's a paradox because you're holding on to something, you have to find a sweet spot. A reality where it will happen in the future is easier than jumping to one where it already happened and the past is different.  Would she know afterwards? Yeah. Would she be the same eve as when you began? No. Could she be identical to the eve you left behind? Yes. You seem hung up on keeping things the same, this will actually fuck with it because the whole point is to dissociate from everything and let it go. If you hang on it's not going to do anything, you're just going to be staring at the mirror with a candle going with your BFF Eve. If there is a multiverse, with every possibility happening an infinite amount of times, should you care? Its pretty much a one way street to losing all fucks. No matter what you do, all those horrible things are happening to an infinite amount of Eves, and at the same time, all the amazing things are happening to an infinite amount of eves as well. You're skinny, obese, hot, ugly, your friends hate you, they love you. The you experiencing this right now, are you happy in your permutation? Yes? Stay, work a little harder. No? Find your paradise. Jump. It may even save your life."
DimensionalJumping,3bp4yt,Demotay,3,Wed Jul 1 00:39:11 2015 UTC,"See previous answers here and check out the Active Metaphors links in the sidebar (which basically say: there is no other ""you"", you are just observing a different part of your potential experience)."
DimensionalJumping,3bp4yt,TriumphantGeorge,3,Wed Jul 1 05:34:08 2015 UTC,I think an FAQ added in the sidebar would really help .I'm pretty sure this question has been asked millions of times.And probably some more common questions.
DimensionalJumping,3bp4yt,insaneseeker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, might tweak it up a bit, but was trying to stay away from a definitive description for now - the ""other you"" and ""other people"" explanations depend on which one.  We could just declare that it's  ""private views / extended persons"" and be done with it."
