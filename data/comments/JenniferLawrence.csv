JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,jessebuynothing,8,Sun Jun 28 05:28:22 2015 UTC,Probably just drew on her face so the paparazzi didn't have a flattering shot to sell
JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,CrypticCraig,9,Sat Jun 27 19:15:59 2015 UTC,Well IMHO that's stupid cause Lawrence with drawings on her face would probably sell for more than normal shots of her..
JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,dragonsky,14,Sat Jun 27 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"Hate to say it, but I got a weird feeling she's on the verge of losing it. Anybody else got the same feeling?"
JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,theground2,10,Sat Jun 27 22:52:30 2015 UTC,I don't think so. She has always been a goofy goober and atm she does some stuff in NYC with her parents and some friends which probably delights her mood a lot :)
JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,w4ynepain,8,Sat Jun 27 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but she has always been a bit goofy.  And her career seems to be going ok and she is having fun.  So far not a lot to really worry about i think."

JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,ScotchAnne,3,Sun Jun 28 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"This the the second post to this sub in the past 24 hours where JLaw is hamming it up. And she has long hair. Are these pics recent?  If these are recent, she's really smart for handling the paparazzi this way. And did she get extensions? Or does her hair just grow super fast? If so, anybody know her secret? 'Cause my hair needs some length."
JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,w4ynepain,2,Sat Jun 27 20:11:53 2015 UTC,I think it's her natural hair she just let it grew out the last months. It grows fast I guess!
JenniferLawrence,3bbhm5,GldRush98,-9,Sat Jun 27 20:38:58 2015 UTC,These pics are really old.

JenniferLawrence,3b30kz,Emmersom,5,Thu Jun 25 22:21:35 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they be able to sell these pics? The only way these wouldn't be sold is if she was flipping them off.

JenniferLawrence,3b30kz,Emmersom,5,Fri Jun 26 01:24:17 2015 UTC,I can think of a ton of magazines that would buy and print them. She's being cute and silly and that's exactly what they want to print because that's what image of her sells. Yeah the paparazzi look for rage and outbursts but if that's all they were looking for then they wouldn't sell as well.

JenniferLawrence,3axnuh,PacoTaco321,45,Wed Jun 24 16:23:59 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this is the most unflattering picture of her.
JenniferLawrence,3axnuh,MC_Carty,2,Wed Jun 24 15:22:02 2015 UTC,Agreed. She looks like a deer in headlights. Imo it isn't sexy unless they're consenting to the photos. The girl should have her privacy.

I walked around in heels with a thinner heel and a pointy-ish closed toe for about 7 or 8 hours in NYC when I was 15. If you get the right kind of heels and are used to wearing heels (which I'm sure she is), it's not that uncomfortable."

In my country fur is pretty much only worn by middle aged till old ladies who have seen better days. A young woman wearing fur doesn't look classy at all more like a stereotype of an Eastern European hooker.
