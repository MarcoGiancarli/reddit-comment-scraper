yankees,3duexe,paperfisherman,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. Much rather see what he can do than have a mediocre veteran like Brendan ryan(who's always hurt anyway) on the team. Refsnyder already looks like a better hitter than Ryan

yankees,3dgoxp,TheZooBoy,10,Thu Jul 16 03:16:43 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm ALWAYS weary of NL pitchers coming to the AL East.    Don't see the Yanks getting any of those pitchers, mainly because I don't see Cashman willing to package 2-3 of Yankees top prospects.  Also, maybe it's me but I just don't see why people are so big on Samardzija.  He's very AJ Burnett-esque to me.  I wouldn't give up any Top Prospects for that.  I'd much rather put Warren back in the Rotation."
yankees,3dgoxp,Badswitch,2,Thu Jul 16 05:02:14 2015 UTC,Yes living in Illinois I have seen a lot of Samardja and he's just not that good.  He'd be a 4.00 type of pitcher for the Yanks
yankees,3dgoxp,ClintEastwood41,2,Thu Jul 16 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"He really isn't that good, yet people constantly bring his name up in trades like he'd be some sort of a savior to a rotation.  He's a guy that's maybe a 5th starter, 4th at best.  I'm sorry but I'm not giving up anything but a bag of used batting practice baseball for that."

yankees,3dgoxp,ClintEastwood41,6,Fri Jul 17 14:07:38 2015 UTC,The real question is if Girardi has enough balls to finally bench cc.  Dude is pretty much worthless at this point.
yankees,3dgoxp,kubes069,2,Thu Jul 16 05:36:02 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear. If the Yanks need a better arm, put CC in the bullpen and let Warren pitch every five days. He's one of our best."
yankees,3dgoxp,iurocky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:36:46 2015 UTC,His innings are limited this year. If he stayed in the roto he would've need to be shut down in September
yankees,3dgoxp,Badswitch,2,Thu Jul 16 22:02:42 2015 UTC,Why are his innings limited?
yankees,3dgoxp,kubes069,2,Thu Jul 16 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"Never gonna happen.  The Yankees essentially need to pray to Babe Ruth that CC is injured and spends about about a month on the DL.  If he spends 45 days on the DL then his Player Option for 2017 doesn't kick in and the Yanks could finally be rid of that ugly contract, which is even uglier now that he's a bum."
yankees,3dgoxp,FishstickIsles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:57:22 2015 UTC,"It hurts knowing he's making over 20 million and producing a 5+ era.  Pitchers are sent to the minor leagues for that shit, but because he's cc he stays.  It's so frustrating watching him give up a Homer or 2 a game.   19 dingers,  what a joke ."
yankees,3dgoxp,Badswitch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:54:13 2015 UTC,"It has to be a left shoulder injury though, and if CC misses time at this stage in his career it will probably be his knee acting up.  The most upside he has IMO is in being injured as the Yanks can at least collect some insurance $$ that way.    I think they'll keep trotting him out there as a starter hoping that he either finds it, which I don't think will happen, or until he hits the DL.  They should make him a LOOGY, he might still get hurt and he'd do less damage to the team's record."
yankees,3dgoxp,FishstickIsles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"As a LOOGY, he would be the most expensive LOOGY in history.  I'm sure the Yankees don't want to make that kind of history.  LOL  Whatever the case, I'd just like him gone."
yankees,3dgoxp,leiner63,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:18:49 2015 UTC,Just as expensive as being the worst starter in baseball.  But doing less damage to the team's record.   And there's still a chance he'd get injured for insurance $$.
yankees,3dgoxp,shane727,3,Sun Jul 19 12:22:03 2015 UTC,Was listening to wfan and heard ref is on the no fly list. A trade is unlikely.
yankees,3dgoxp,wcurl8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:36:17 2015 UTC,"Yes I believe they said that they heard Severino, Judge, and Ref are on a no fly list which makes it unlikely we land someone like Cueto."

yankees,3dgoxp,fatmike63,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:17 2015 UTC,I feel like losing Warren would be the same mistake we made last year with Phelps and Greene.

yankees,3dgoxp,Badswitch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I feel that when the Yanks finally have someone to permantelly play 2B, they should hold on to that. Steven Drew almost certainly won't be resigned, so who will play 2nd then? Petit? Ryan? Pirela?"
yankees,3dgoxp,BusinessSavvyPunter,2,Thu Jul 16 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"He's played 2 games and is a disaster in the field.  Not sure why you think he's such a keeper.  He could be, and I'm personally a fan.  But if we can get established value for him, do it.  Remember when we balked on getting Cliff Lee because we thought Eduardo Nunez was a piece to hold on to in 2010?  Yankees lost in 6 games in the ALCS and Hughes had 2 bad starts in the series.  Nunez went on to get DFA'd.  Maybe it goes down differently, but untested prospects are a huge risk, and someone like Cueto is not.  Maybe the Starlin Castro rumors are real and we'll have Castro at 2B and Cueto on the mound in the playoffs."
yankees,3dgoxp,02TJ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"Well the error in the 9th was just as much Andrew Miller's fault. And I doubt that Cliff Lee would have signed with the Yankees anyway.  You bring up good points, though. I guess we'll have to see what happens."
yankees,3dgoxp,02TJ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  People bring up Ref's error in that 2nd game, but from my POV I thought it was Miller's fault.  The throw was off target.  Could Ref had made the catch?? Probably, but to blame him as if he Ole'd a grounder is a bit much.  BSP does make valid points re: Prospects.  But the thing is that some of the guys we have up, we already know who they are and what they can do.  That's the love afraid with Prospects.  You see the numbers, or watched them play at the farm level and know there's a ceiling and you are hoping that this guy can reach that potential.    Which is why I'm all for dumping Eovaldi now, and bringing up Severino.  I already know who Nate is.  He's a guy with 97 MPH heat who doesn't miss as many bats as he should be missing.  Record looks like, but it's a misleading as he's been hit hard."
yankees,3dgoxp,revamps,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:01:54 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better myself, although I do disagree with your last paragraph a bit.  I wouldn't dump Eovaldi yet, I still believe he has potential. And I think that Severino would benefit from more time in the minors as well."
yankees,3dgoxp,Badswitch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:47:01 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you see in Eovaldi?  Because whatever some ppl keep telling me, I just don't see it.  Yes, he's got a 97 MPH fastball...but he doesn't miss many bats with it.  IMO, he'd probably benefit more from a move to the bullpen where his 97 MPH Fastball could potentially consistently hit over 100 MPH.  Re: Severino, He just doesn't have anything left to prove at the farm level.  He's completely dominated every level his been at.  He needs to be challenged now."
yankees,3dgoxp,brooklynbotz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:26:45 2015 UTC,"I just think that he hasn't reached his peak yet. There's still more to see from him yet. The Yanks have been trying to develop him. And yeah, I can see him maybe working from the bullpen since he usually only lasts five innings anyway, but the problem is that he doesn't have an experience there."
yankees,3dgoxp,limprichard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:27:27 2015 UTC,"That's where all failed starters end up, so I don't see any sense in prolonging the inevitable.    We're going to have to agree to disagree.  I'm going full Denny Green here, ""He is, who we thought he was"".  Hell I'd rather see Warren in the rotation over him."
yankees,3dgoxp,Nebkreb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:17:34 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that, I'd much rather have Warren over any of our starters besides Tanaka and Pineda."
yankees,3dgoxp,ShrimGods,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:37:30 2015 UTC,"Eovaldi is a solid back of the rotation piece.  Rothschild sees something obviously.  He likes to take raw talent and develop, and hope for results like we saw in Brandon McCarthy.  He's working on his change.  He's young and under team control.  You gotta let him play it.  You don't know who you thought he was YET IMO because he is 25.  Lots of pictures hit their stride in their age 25 - 28 seasons.  And if he does he is such an asset at that price tag.  You have to let him work it out.  He has a long leash.  Severino threw 113 inning last year and is already at 88.  Not sure of his limit this year but probably around 140 I would think.  Basically he doesn't have many innings left this year.  They are avoiding calling him up before September.  Hopefully he has a 180 or so innings limit in 2016 and can break camp with the club.  Manage it like we have done with Pineda and give him an extra day here and there.  Pull him out a few games in the 6th with 80 pitches thrown.  That type of stuff.  And 2017 (his age 23 season!) he will have no restrictions."
yankees,3dgoxp,Badswitch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:02:27 2015 UTC,Castro is the other player who I have my eye on. I think it's clear the Cubs would deal him but what would we have to give them for him? I'm assuming refsynder would be involved in a deal for Cueto rather than Castro
yankees,3dgoxp,Nebkreb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:17 2015 UTC,what about moving didi to second and going after a stud SS (tulo?)
yankees,3dgoxp,Badswitch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"I would love to have Tulo, but the problem with Didi going to 2nd is that ever since Cano left, Yanks have been putting SS at 2B, and it hasn't really worked out for them that well."
yankees,3dgoxp,throdon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:11:29 2015 UTC,if we pick up tulo we'd have to keep another back up 2B/SS for when (not if) he gets hurt and is out for a long period of time/season. as great a SS as he is he just can't seem to stay healthy for an entire season and we've already got enough old timers/injury prone players on the. we should be looking at someone who is going to lock down second and get a relationship going with didi
yankees,3dabcx,frankspinkled,6,Tue Jul 14 18:55:17 2015 UTC,Yes you are able to walk around the rest of the stadium from the bleachers. You won't have much luck moving into other seats though. The ushers are tough.

Nothing else the government wastes money on manages to bring millions of people together throughout the year to spend money and hang out at local businesses. This guy's an idiot.
yankees,3d561n,RedditardLogic,14,Mon Jul 13 18:32:19 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if your username explains your comment or if it's actually your opinion
yankees,3d561n,thisguyyy,15,Mon Jul 13 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"If you watched the whole segment he provides examples at how building a new stadium is not always an economic benefit to the area.  Granted with a proven dynamic like Yankee Stadium and the Bronx there will always be an economic upturn on gameday, but citing his example with the Marlins and their stadium your point is totally moot.  Also John Oliver is the furthest thing from an idiot."
yankees,3d561n,bottleguy1,4,Mon Jul 13 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they also interviewed that local bar owner who said that his business sees huge downswings on game days.   They also go and talk about some cities where the teams can afford the stadiums but use taxpayer money bc it's a stupid business decision to pay for something the city can fund for you.   I love his show and his pieces always include a ton of research.

I can see a stadium bringing extra people to an area which could certainly help local businesses, money wise. I just have to think the net effect has to be low, since the city/state pays for these stadiums or the ground they're on yet the team is the one that makes the money."

yankees,3d561n,vader177,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"thanks, I;m sure if I dug around google I could find a source that says the exact opposite, that's how the internet works.  Do what should win when a discussion becomes a battle of sources? Common sense. You tell me, using your common sense, why would building something like a basketball stadium, which hosts a minimum of 41 games a year, seats 20,000+ people be a bad idea? That's roughly 820,000 people migrating to one area of a city a year. Think it's safe to say each of these people spend at least $2 on travel, tickets, food etc? That's $1.6 million in just one season. In just the months of May through August the AA center in Miami had 10 events. That's 100,000 people if they only sold 10,000 seats for each event, there's another 300,000 people coming a year minimum. Just do the math, you have over a million people coming to your city specifically to spend money each year. If these stadiums stay alive for 20 years, which the average age is currently 16 in the NBA, the money just keeps adding up. This isn't even including the taxes on the arena or the jobs created that go into maintaining the structure. The most expensive NBA stadium is $1.1 billion. Do the math. It pays for itself in attendance alone, and that's not even accounting for the nightlight that flourishes in these towns as a result."

I am thinking that's a sportswriter making a guess that he hopes makes him look like he knew what he was talking about rather than a legit story.   My thinking is that they are serious about developing from within and NOT trading all their prospects...I'm sure Refsnyder could be had if a deal made sense but I don't believe for a second they're just showcasing him with no plans to give him a shot long term.

yankees,3ctdc4,HastyPackedHoboSnack,9,Sun Jul 12 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. Mattingly was one of the best hitters in the game, if not the best hitter, for 6 straight seasons, Nettles was a league MVP, something Gardner will never do. Willie Randolph by stats alone isn't that impressive but the fact that he's a hometown kid and was beloved by fans and the front office shows why he was chosen as a co-captain. I'm not hating on Gardner but he just doesn't possess any qualities that a player should have to be a captain of the Yankees."
yankees,3ctdc4,BOO00M,-7,Fri Jul 10 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. Mattingly was one of the best hitters in the game, if not the best hitter, for 6 straight seasons,    And yet never topped the WAR Garden put up in 2010, and likely will put up this year. Theres more to the game than just batting average. Also that notion that Mattingly was the best hitter in the game is ridiculous.  Gardner is beloved as well, and a homegrown kid who came through the farm system. He plays hard, carries himself the right way, and is a terrific player. There's no reason for him to not be captain, other than for some people who don't understand that there is more to the game than batting average and RBIs"
yankees,3ctdc4,hardcorelegend43,6,Fri Jul 10 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"He just doesn't cut it. He's a great dude. But he's not filling jeters shoes. Bottom line, were New York. A career .260 guy with less home runs than Arod has had in 1 season isn't going to be named captain, to only retire in 5 years."
yankees,3ctdc4,HastyPackedHoboSnack,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:21 2015 UTC,"Did you ever see Mattingly play? I'm so sick and tired of people using WAR as the end all be all of player rankings. I understand it's place in statistics but a player simply having a higher WAR is not enough evidence to show me who a better ballplayer is. Mattingly absolutely dominated the American League in batting in his prime and without injuries would go down as one of the greatest hitters of all time. Of course injuries are a part of the game so you can't discount them. But Mattingly displayed more talent during his time in the league than Gardner has ever showed me.  And I know it seems like I'm hating on Brett but I just can't believe that a Yankee fan is discounting how great these players are. Brett is great in his own right but to compare him to those who have had the honor of being named captain is just ridiculous. These players were a part of Yankee history, not just being good for a few playoff runs. Argue all the stats you want but when you look at captains you'll see one thing, they won. Be it Gehrig, Munson, or even Guidry. In the end you can't be a captain if you didn't lead the team towards winning it all."
yankees,3ctdc4,BOO00M,-3,Sat Jul 11 02:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yes I did, unlike you. And you don't need to watch someone play to understand how good and what type of player they were.

Then you're in the minority   Mattingly absolutely dominated the American League in batting in his prime and without injuries would go down as one of the greatest hitters of all time.   We fucking know. Everyone knows Mattingly was a better hitter. Gardner is better at everything else   But Mattingly displayed more talent during his time in the league than Gardner has ever showed me.   So? If you don't realize your talent it doesn't matter. Eddy Curry was talented as fuck, didn't amount to much   And I know it seems like I'm hating on Brett but I just can't believe that a Yankee fan is discounting how great these players are.   I'm not doing that. I'm just propping up Gardner. Mattingly was fantastic throughout his career. Gardner is just better   Brett is great in his own right but to compare him to those who have had the honor of being named captain is just ridiculous.   Captaincy is not an argument for why someone is better or not   . Argue all the stats you want but when you look at captains you'll see one thing, they won   Winning has almost nothing to do with how good a player is, and Gardner won a title with us anyway"

How could you think this guy is worthy of being the captain? Yankee captains are rare and reserved fir future hall of fame type players. Think how great guys like posada, bernie, Paul oneill, tiny Martinez etc. None of those guys were worthy, why would a medicore player like Gardner warrant it?  Yes he's killing it this year but his whOle career has been average until now  The Yankees don't just name captains just to do it. And while I like Brett, he's not even close to worthy"
yankees,3ctdc4,BusinessSavvyPunter,7,Fri Jul 10 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"Went overboard there.  I don't think he should be captain either but to call his whole career average is disingenuous.  Lots of numbers to consider, but if we look just at WAR as a blunt summary, he has never had a full season where he wasn't comfortably an above average player.  He had a 7.3 WAR season once, something Jeter barely did only twice, and probably should have won MVP in one of them.  Excluding 2012 where he only played 16 games, he has at minimum doubled the output of a league average player on the field every year since 2010.  They said on the broadcast yesterday that he is 4th in the AL in WAR since 2010 as well, though I haven't verified that on my own.  You're underselling big time.  Also, we have had 6 captains since Gehrig and none are in the Hall of Fame, though Jeter is going to go of course.  Finally - who cares if the poster is a teenager?"
yankees,3ctdc4,BOO00M,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"He had a 7.3 WAR season once, something Jeter barely did only twice   then it's pretty clear you shouldn't judge a player based on WAR alone. Look, I'm not against sabremetrics at all. Almost all stats have their value. The problem is that certain people take sabremetrics as the gospel and trumps ALL other stats. To the point where you're arguing a clearly average major league like brett gardner is even comparable to a first ballot hall of fame yankee legend like Derek JEter.   Yes, he is an average player at the end of the day. This is a guy whose career high batting average is .277 with absolute 0 power(until last season). He usually hits between .250-265 range, with a .269 career average(again, with very weak power numbers). When you consider he's hit in some stacked yankee lineups with plenty of protection....it's underwhelming. He is a good to great fielder but not elite as he has an average arm, and he isn't as good at tracking the ball as some of the truly elite outfielders.  His main contribution before last season was on the basepaths--and he doesn't seem to be able to put it all together, now that he's finally an effective hitter, his base stealing ability has dropped considerably.   I'm sorry dude but sometimes you gotta use your sense and not just look at one sabremetric stat--I'm sure his ridiculously high SB numbers earlier in his career and his plus defense are what had his WAR so high, because he has been a below average hitter most of his career. WAR is a nice stat but it's not some end all be all--there are super star players with incredibly low WAR numbers, and blue collar guys who have major weaknesses with great WAR numbers. Like any other stat it can be skewed and misinterpreted. In this case I believe his outrageous stolen base numbers were a huge contributor, as finding a guy who can steal 40-50 bases is rare.   You are correct--none of the yankee captains since Gehrig has made the HoF--however, all of them have hall of fame numbers except Randolph and Nettles, who still made 6 all star teams EACH and NEttles won an MVP award and homerun crown--guys who's production still dwarf Gardner's.  I don't care if the poster is a teenager--I'm asking to try and understand why he would think that. For a teenager it would make sense because all he saw was the back end of Jeter's career which would leave one to believe that A. The yankees have captains normally and B. Only decent players are worthy(since Jeter kind of fell off with age). It wasn't a condemnation of him being a teen, just trying to understand the logic."
yankees,3ctdc4,quigs17,3,Fri Jul 10 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"You don't like WAR.  I got it.  But you should reconsider.  Advanced metrics are a great tool.  We have the numbers of baseball worked out pretty good by now.  Such a huge sample to pull from.  We know the best ways to create runs.  When you get on base at a good clip, average matters less.  You're right, when his bat was light, he stole more bases.  And now that he has more pop he steals less.  That doesn't mean he wasn't an above average player through it all.  I'm not saying he's a Hall of Famer... obviously.  I'm saying that any way you look at it, he's not average.  Do you also not like stats like OPS, or OPS+ which are really just combinations of classic stats.  PURELY at the plate he has been above average 5 of the last 6 seasons.  That would of course be ignoring his speed on the bases or his plus defense.  So if he is above average at the plate, above average on the bases, and above average in the field, what does that make him?  All those factors combine into new stats like WAR, which, grade him out correctly as an above average player.  Besides, I called WAR a ""blunt summary"" when I first mentioned it.   you're arguing a clearly average major league like brett gardner is even comparable to a first ballot hall of fame yankee legend like Derek JEter.   You're misrepresenting or perhaps misunderstanding my point.  I compared a single season by Gardner to some of the best of Jeter's.  Not their careers.  I did this because you said:   Yes he's killing it this year but his whOle career has been average until now   Every season since he has been a full time player has been above average.  One season (2010) he was elite.  Perhaps the best defensive outfielder in baseball, got on base 38% of the time (same clip Jeter had when he hit .324 and should have won MVP) and stole 47 bases.  That's not average.   He usually hits between .250-265 range, with a .269 career average   That doesn't make sense, just mathematically.  And even if I was going to ""use my sense"" and ignore the numbers.  My perception of Gardner has been that of a consistent catalyst for the offense and a plus defender for many years, and one of our best players.  I've gotten the sense that most people feel similarly, but I guess who knows?  Any way you slice it, he's not average."
yankees,3ctdc4,BOO00M,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:22:22 2015 UTC,"You don't like WAR. I got it.   I specifically said this isn't the case at all. I'm fine with advanced metrics, I just think it's silly when people take one advanced stat and throw out the rest of a players ordinary numbers as if they mean nothing.  I'm sorry, BRett Gardner was not elite in 2010. This is just pure unadulterated homerism. I mean cmon dude. .277 with 8 homeruns is elite? No. No it's not. He is a great fielder but at no point has he been the best outfielder in baseball, that's ridiculous. He has an average arm, and while he can go get the ball better than most, I've seen him have tracking issues more than most centerfield/speedy outfielders. Because of hsi small stature, he can't recover a lot of the time, and is usually a non factor in climbing the wall on top of that. I realize this is a high standard and he's still a great outfielder--but if you're saying he's the BEST fielder at his position? You have to have higher standards, especially in center field. There are certainly better outfielders out there.   I guess we have to agree to disagree--he has been average at best at the plate most of his career. Hitting in the .255-.270 range with 0 power is not an above average hitter to me. If that is to you then..that's cool. His OBP has been pretty good, no doubt, but nothing consistently eye popping. I get that he is a great feidler and great on the basepaths---but hitting is still a huge part of the game. Look at Billy Hamilton for the Reds--dude's probably the best base stealer in baseball and is a great defender--but he's arguably the worst hitter I've seen at the major league level--to me he's still a below average player.   I'm not saying BRett Gardner is a bum, or even before this year. I'm saying he was a averagish player who had game breaking speed. He's kind of busted out the last couple years and raised his game for sure, so that's great too. I'm just syaing when it comes to all time yankee greats/captains? He's not even a blip on the radar."
yankees,3ctdc4,fuckyourcatsnigga,2,Sat Jul 11 00:03:34 2015 UTC,"Why do you say things like .255-.270 range?  It's just inaccurate.  If his average is .269 then that number needs to lay in the middle of whatever range you make.  I don't know who you think you're fooling.  I used this word before, but it's very accurate for the type of arguments you're making but, disingenuous. ""Derek Jeter hit in the .260 - .310 range.""  Makes no sense.    The issue is that my claims are supported by all the stats when looked at together.  You keep chirping about average.  That tells PART of the story.  OBP is there.  And with his steals it's like more than half his walks that year were doubles in some ways.  You look at his average and 8 HRs and for you the conversation ends there.  2nd in baseball in steals matters.  OBP matters.  OPS+ is a very accurate way to judge a hitter.  Or wRC+, where it also is clear he is above average at the plate.  I don't get it man.  You're being willfully ignorant.  Why is is wRC+ and OPS+, known and confirmed metrics accepted by 99% of writers/bloggers (it seems) as an accurate way to judge a hitter... why does that mean nothing to you?  Neither takes into account his steals, so it's even more impressive.  And his fielding metrics at the time back up my fielding claims.  He was off the charts.  Billy Hamilton?  He actually does grade out as an average player, Gardner does not.  If you look up his WAR or OPS+ you'll see your feelings on him are accurate.  I can't help you if you just want to ignore numbers.  Still waiting for your examples of superstar players that have bad WARs.  I'd like to know great hitters with bad OPS+ and bad wRC+ as well."
yankees,3ctdc4,BOO00M,-4,Sat Jul 11 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"The problem is that certain people take sabremetrics as the gospel and trumps ALL other stats.   That's because they do. You are still using a stat like batting average... a stat that is basically worthless. The beauty of saber stats is when you realize guys like Gardner, who 20 years ago would've been considered a lower end starter, is actually an allstar because of his defense, baserunning, batting eye, etc...  Neither Randolph nor Nettles had a peak that was better than Gardners. Even Mattingly's highest single season WAR didn't match Gardy's  There are no superstar players with low WAR"
yankees,3ctdc4,quigs17,3,Fri Jul 10 22:17:11 2015 UTC,"How is batting average worthless? High batting average means making less outs, putting the ball in play more often,  giving your team a chance because ur getting HITS.  baseball is about hitting a ball and scoring runs.  Last I checked the As  who started this whole money ball Saber metric craze haven't even made it into the world series since they started."
yankees,3ctdc4,BOO00M,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"Because people are dismissing Gardner for having a mediocre batting average. It tells you so little about a player and is given far too much weight by people who don't know baseball.   The teams that are high on analytics are faring far better than the teams that don't, and the A's have been consistently punching above their weight. I seriously thought this lack of understand of stats was behind baseball at this point, but I guess it isn't.  Gardner hit .277 in 2010, a solid batting average. Despite having a solid batting average, Gardner was an MVP candidate, because baseball is more than batting average"
yankees,3ctdc4,quigs17,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"Not dismissing him. Just saying he's not worthy of being captain. Not even close to good enough, and he's not some elite player. I don't know where people are getting this idea lately because he's having the best season of his career at age 31. I love gardner but I have no allusions about him. He's a good player at this point in his career, but most of his career he has been average to above average. His average also concerns me because of all the protection he had in stacked yankees lineups, and he still hit pretty low with 0 power. It's not as if he was the star of the lineup and every pitcher was giving him their best stuff and/or pitching around him---he was the soft spot in the lineup who would get the best pitches to hit, and he still was only a ""meh"" hitter   Gardner was an MVP candidate, because baseball is more than batting average   Yeahhhh, no he wasn't. Just because you say that doesn't mean it's true. He was never in the conversation for MVP outside of a few irrational yankees fans...he didn't receive a single vote and I never even heard a whisper of his name in the MVP conversation."

And he's been better then previous Yankee captains   His average also concerns me because of all the protection he had in stacked yankees lineups, and he still hit pretty low with 0 power   Average is a near useless measure of a player.

We could also have the option of adding either Cueto and/or Chapman, which would obviously require a lot more, probably a big prospect like Refsnyder, Severino, Bird, etc, and probably 2 big prospects plus other guys to get both.

And at times it does look like what he's doing is keeping the hitters off balance, not because he has the stuff to do so, but because it's different than what they're used to from CC.  But at other times, the hitters look like they're just dying to get at CC.  He gives up tons of loud outs and home runs, and that says that at times, he's not fooling anyone - he goes in to BP Sabathia mode.  If all he can give is about 5 or 6 innings per start and his ERA is going to stay over a 5, with lots of games where he just gets straight racked - then he's going to keep losing more than he'll win, and he'll also put a CC-sized strain on the pen."

yankees,3cgztq,Brendan42,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:31:18 2015 UTC,"I've heard that about his book as well. Joba was a beast out of the pen that year. Then they try to stretch him out into a starter, why? Torre was an all time great but he had his fair share of head scratching decisions as a Yankee."
yankees,3cgztq,Hokeis,3,Wed Jul 8 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"Well he was a starter all in the minors.  He only went to the pen to manage innings.  I was all for Joba the starter, but not the stupid rules."
yankees,3cgztq,xKronkx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"Forgot about that. Regardless, I didn't like the ""Joba Rules"" either.  IP limit almost always comes back around to hurt a team."

That aside... there are many reasons why Joba went downhill overall.  Primarily, it was the way they handled him.  The ""rules"" played a role, but the main thing was that the Yanks mishandled him.  He's a reliever... no he's a starter... no he's... we don't know what to do with him....   Also, it has to be said that he was dominant when he came up because no one had seen him.  Once batters had faced him more than a few times, they were able to lock in on his heat, and smack him around.  To be fair, Yankees (and we Yankee fans) do have a habit of hyping players up..."
yankees,3cgztq,Jersey2Bronx,0,Wed Jul 8 08:08:14 2015 UTC,They prefer to be called dwarfs.
yankees,3cgztq,crocodial,16,Wed Jul 8 08:04:52 2015 UTC,"I think the effect of the ""Rules"" is overblown but I still think the Yanks ruined this guy. He came out of the pen in 2007 and struck out the world and they couldn't leave well enough alone. Imagine what he could have been if he'd stayed in the 8th inning and spent five years learning at Mariano's feet. What a waste."
yankees,3cgztq,Brendan42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:41:15 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I think the Joba rules didn't allow him to grow and develop his second and third pitches as needed.  He never got a chance.  Cashman and Co. ruined him.
yankees,3cgztq,Badswitch,6,Wed Jul 8 06:29:39 2015 UTC,I think the effect of the Joba rules was overblown. He had a few injuries and wasn't really the same afterward. Never regained that 2007 slider. Hopefully he can catch on somewhere...just not with the Yankees.
yankees,3cgztq,heckleberryfinn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:45:02 2015 UTC,Yeah especially since he pretty much said he hated everything about NY.

yankees,3cgztq,AgentZeroGA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:16:07 2015 UTC,This is so sad. It makes it even worse that he's a genuinely good person.
yankees,3cgztq,sorryidontdoreddit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"He may be the worst managed player I have seen in any sport. But, part of it was his fault bc (if i remember correctly) he asked to be made a started when he was a reliever.   IMO making him a starter was a big mistake mainly bc having a ~70 MPH slow pitch and a ~100 MPH fast pitch is such a devastating advantage, his roughly 25 MPH speed difference, is lost if you are trying to pitch a 100 pitch 6 inning game. You can't throw as hard."
yankees,3cgztq,Bay1Bri,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:19:29 2015 UTC,He had some good moments as a starter.  I always remember this game in particular that made me think he def should be a starter.  http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS200807250.shtml
yankees,3cgztq,xKronkx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"He had a lot of potential to be a very good pitcher in any role. But a reliever can get a bit more out of a fastball than a starter can, and with his low 70s changeup (i think) he had a devastating combo, which he didn't have without the fastball being as fast as it could be. Just my opinion though."
yankees,3cgztq,Bay1Bri,0,Wed Jul 8 19:13:42 2015 UTC,You're mistaken. He was a starter when drafted and a starter in the minors. They Yankees brought him up in a relief role in 07.
yankees,3cgztq,brooklynbotz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, they brought him up as a reliever, and then asked to be made a starter again. Like I said."
yankees,3cgztq,Bay1Bri,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:47:03 2015 UTC,they brought him up in a relief role to manage innings.  They may very well do the same thing w/ Luis Severino this year.
yankees,3cgztq,xKronkx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:51:04 2015 UTC,"He didn't have to ask to be made a starter again. The plan was always for him to be a starter. Many teams bring up their best young starters as relievers to get their feet wet. Happened with Wainright, Yohan, and many others. I don't see why everyone wanted him to stick at reliever. A guy who pitches 70 innings a year is never going to be as valuable as one who pitches 200."
yankees,3cgztq,brooklynbotz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"Unless he is great for 70 innings and mediocre overall in 200. I said above, personally, I wanted him to stay a reliever because he was great for an inning or two, partly because his fastball was 100 MPH as a reliever, and not many people can throw as fast as a starter as they can for an inning or two. The difference between his pitch speeds was around 25-30 MPH. This was not the case with him when he started. And throughout his first year as a starter for the Yankees, they said he wanted the change, even if they wanted to also. He also was against it when people started talking about putting him back in the bullpen, because starters make more money than relievers."
yankees,3cgztq,Bay1Bri,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:36:09 2015 UTC,I'd take him back.
yankees,3cgztq,sweber011,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:10:05 2015 UTC,I still remember some dude bunted against Joba and Joba laid out and caught it mid air.  That year we won the championship.  Loved his fire and passion
yankees,3ciubm,Badswitch,3,Wed Jul 8 06:32:58 2015 UTC,"Hes not wasting away. How old is he, 21? Thats still early to be in the majors. Not many players that young dominate MLB lets get that straight. Its also not like he is unhittable either. In AA this year he was 2-2 with a 3.59 era. He has actually been much better in AAA though since his promotion, going 4-0 with 1.99 era. Deep breaths man, itll be OK."
yankees,3ciubm,agingbythesecond,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. The kid has been in AAA for a month. He's nasty yeah, but he's 21. Eovaldi is just 25 & if he can control his stuff has potential. You know tanaka & Pineda are top 2 starters, & nova has been great as well. The 5th starter is CC who isn't going to get dumped yet, & then you have warren as a 6. The org looks too highly at Severino to dump him. I know I've been hyped about him for over a year now, but he's a kid! Let CC retire, then slide in Sev to the 3 or 4 spot."
yankees,3ciubm,hardcorelegend43,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"Pineda and Tanaka haven't exactly been pitching like Aces for over a month.    Pineda's been good, but he's been inconsistent.  He got ripped in June.  Tanaka, has been ok and I'm sure he's going to need TJS and don't see why the Yanks keep waiting on it.  Just do it already.  Eovaldi, I have no confidence in.  I'm going full Dennis Green on him; ""He was who we thought he was"".  Nova's been good, but still recovering IMO.    CC is signed for next season and if he doesn't miss more than 45 days, his player option kicks in for $25M.  Yikes!"
yankees,3ciubm,theeighthwonder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:39:23 2015 UTC,"I say he's wasting away because he has nothing else to prove at the Farm level.  Hitters are hitting .195 off him. His three pitches are above average.  A pitcher toils at AA-AAA until he's mastered 2-3 pitches and Severino's done that.  He's got nothing to prove at this level.  While he might not ""dominate"" in the Bronx, I have no expectation of that.  I'm about him getting the experience needed to reach his ceiling.  I'm almost certain that if Severino was in say STL, NYM, PIT, MIA, BOS he would have already reached the Majors. It's just something about the Yankees FO that fails to see when a kid is ready for the next step.  My biggest fear is that the Yanks trade the kid for a summer of Cueto."
yankees,3ciubm,agingbythesecond,2,Thu Jul 9 05:31:44 2015 UTC,"Would you rather have his first year in the bigs be terrible and ruin his mindset? Or maybe 5 years from now, the biggest issue with him will be that we say, wow imagine if he had just come up in 2015 vs 2016. Why rush it? This kid could pitch for a long time, no need to bring him up the minute we ""think"" he can get it done."
yankees,3ciubm,yankeesfan13,2,Thu Jul 9 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"Agree, plus hes really not needed. What we need is Sabathia in the BP and Warren the #5. Ill take Tanaka/Pineda/Nova/Eovaldi/Warren right now. The worst thing we can do is enact some sort of Joba-esq thing rushing him up."
yankees,3ciubm,TheZooBoy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:37:09 2015 UTC,"More than likely, someone will get hurt. Having 6+ capable starters allows us to fight through that. If we trade away starters and then some get hurt, we are stuck with someone starting who isn't good enough."
yankees,3ciubm,TrynaCatchTheBeat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:35:00 2015 UTC,"Warren deserves to be a starter so much. He's better than half our rotation. I'd rather Eovaldi try going to the pen. Sabathia, while he should be cut, won't be, so I guess we're stuck without Severino for now. REALLY hope he doesn't get traded. And Tanaka either needs to either pitch better or have Tommy John.  Ideally, our rotation SHOULD be Tanaka, Pineda, Warren, Nova, Severino, but I digress.  Also, as a sidenote for Sabathia, I don't understand why he doesn't move to the pen and at least try. He's down and out as a reliable starter, and that's okay. He was once the best pitcher in the MLB, but just like everyone else, he got old and injured. No shame in that, one day down the line, Kershaw will be old and have a 5.59 ERA too."
yankees,3ciubm,TheZooBoy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think Sabathia needs to realize that the best thing for the team is for him to volunteer to move to the pen. Who knows, it might revitalize his career. It's not unheard of."
yankees,3ciubm,Sirotto18,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it could work out better for both him and the team. It's like Niese for the Mets (and Gee before that). Better to try out the pen."
yankees,3ciubm,TheZooBoy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:46:45 2015 UTC,Difference between Eovaldi and Warren is upside we know who Warren is he's an average to below average starter realistically and he's needed in the pen right now. Eovaldi has a upper 90s fastball and good movement on breaking pitches he's either gonna be traded at some point (probably not) or they will try to continue to build him up because he has the stuff just needs to learn how to pitch and put it togejer
yankees,3ciubm,Sirotto18,2,Wed Jul 8 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"True, and thats exactly why Warren was moved to the pen. He has experience there. Eovaldi doesn't. Hopefully they can build him up to be at least last year ""Masahiro McCarthy"" level. I still have faith in him."
yankees,3ciubm,TheZooBoy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:45:57 2015 UTC,True what I've seen from Eovaldi is good stuff but the control and command isn't there which worries me but if you get that under control he would be a good pickup. I think I'm more of a fan of these offseason moves than most
yankees,3ciubm,Sirotto18,2,Wed Jul 8 19:15:34 2015 UTC,"You and me both, mate. I really was excited about Eovaldi, and while he hasn't turned out to be as good as I had hoped, there's still room to improve."
yankees,3ciubm,TheZooBoy,2,Thu Jul 9 03:36:31 2015 UTC,I like the upside and I like Didi too they didn't lose much for either of them but I can't understand why Stephen Drew is playing over Pirela
yankees,3ciubm,Sirotto18,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"I think Steven Drew is the ""best worst hitter"". He can't hit the broadside of a bar, but when he DOES manage to, it's a homerun.  As for Pirela, I think he might be traded once Refsnyder is brought up."
yankees,3ciubm,brooklynbotz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:20:30 2015 UTC,He's only 21 and has only 4 starts in AAA he has time. As for Warren right now he's needed in the pen and with their health situation in the rotation a spot could open up at anytime. Also they have been in a lot of trade rumors so a pitcher could be on the move
yankees,3ciubm,Sirotto18,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:18:21 2015 UTC,The Sabathia contract drives me nuts. Whenever a player opts out I say let them walk. I can't think of one instance where a player opted out of a deal and was resigned that worked out well for the team.
yankees,3ciubm,brooklynbotz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:01:15 2015 UTC,I mean as ugly as the Arod thing is they at least got a ring out of him most of the times that doesn't even happen
yankees,3ciubm,Sirotto18,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:14:03 2015 UTC,Yeah but who knows that they wouldn't have won even more without him? That money could have been better spent elsewhere. Hell we might have even ended up with Cabrera if we let him walk.

Still it's worth it to have the whole field in play.  I just picked a random upcoming game - July 22 vs Baltimore - Wednesday, will be less expensive on a weeknight vs. a weekend day.  Section 420, right behind home place, all the way up in the Grandstand, tix start at around $35.

yankees,3cc15c,symbologythere,2,Mon Jul 6 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"I've been reading Buster Olney's ""The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty"" and this post reminds me of what Olney says about George Steinbrenner's philosophy in the 80s. George was always afraid to bring up homegrown talent. When the Yankees changed this philosophy they created the dynasty. Around '03 they changed the philosophy back to hiring mercenaries (think Giambi, etc.) and stopped developing from within. Obviously we won again in '09, but we've lost our young core. I'd personally love to see some of our young AAA talent get a shot, but i think it's a bit risky while we're clinging to first place."
yankees,3cc15c,bkeschhh,2,Tue Jul 7 18:29:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I think Severino is ready right now to be called up. He has top of the rotation stuff and has been one of the best in the minors this year. CC has been a shell of himself and it's time to give the young guy at least a spot start already.  As for Judge he's not a finished product but is raw power could help us win games right now. I know we don't want to rush things but I doubt a stint in the bigs right now would hamper his career.
yankees,3cc15c,rockyroad99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Severino come up now too, but I'm not sure who he'd replace in the near future. Nova is the closest of our five starters to free agency, and that wouldn't even be until after the 2016 season (CC could also be a free agent after '16, but only if he spends significant time on the DL; otherwise, we're paying him $25 mil in '17). So I think we would have to trade someone away, or just give up on CC."
yankees,3cc15c,TrynaCatchTheBeat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:27:42 2015 UTC,Many of them only just got called up to AAA. Let them thrive there first. Especially with Ellsbury returning soon why rush judge. Refsnyder you can make a good case for I guess. But Sev has no room. It's a September call ups thing at this point barring injury imo
yankees,3cc15c,hardcorelegend43,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"Judge just arrived at SWB and baring some major injuries I don't think you'd see him in the Bronx this year, unless it's in the stands.  Severino should already be up, even if it's out of the bullpen.  Hell, I would love to replace CC's dead arm with Severino.  Or I'd be open to trading Eovaldi to an NL team to give Severino a shot now.  He's ready.  Bird, I don't think he's ready yet.  He's struggled a bit this season.  Also keep in mind he was a Catcher who transitioned to 1B. So he needs innings at the position."
yankees,3cc15c,Badswitch,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"More or less what I just said haha. Yes, you could dump C to the pen but they've already said they won't do that. I'm glad they won't too, hes been my favorite guy on the team since he joined. I wanna see him go 10-10 this year. To trade Eovaldi wouldn't be wise I think. I know his ERA is huge, but hes getting wins and to trade that for a question mark isn't too wise."
yankees,3cc15c,hardcorelegend43,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:58:14 2015 UTC,"$25M for a .500 pitcher with an ERA over 5.5...yuck.  LOL I'm hoping CC comes down with a sudden injury that puts him on the 60 Day DL.  :)  I would trade Eovaldi to insert Severino, because I know Eovaldi's track record and he's still young with slight upside.  There's value in that, meaning Cashman could get back a decent prospect or two.  While Severino would be a question mark, there's a hell of a lot more upside than trotting Eolvadi out there and giving us what he's been giving us.  At least with Luis you're building towards a guy that could be a No. 1 or No. 2."
yankees,3cc15c,Badswitch,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:06:24 2015 UTC,"Refsnyder is still at AAA because his defense is beyond awful.   Judge just got promoted to AAA, and the Yankees don't want to rush him.

yankees,3cc15c,DarthReilly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:22:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion all of those guys need to be ""untouchables"", especially Judge and Refsnyder. It's time to get back to the days where the majority of our team was homegrown talent. Spending hundreds and millions of dollars on over-the-hill vets has gotten us nowhere.  Let Refsnyder get used to his position. I think he'll end up being miles better than drew. Judge is going to be a beast when he hits the majors. (Glad they're not rushing him up). I really like Servino, and you can never have enough southpaws.   Really, the only guy I see as expendable at this point is Gary Sanchez simply because there's a backlog of catcher depth between McCann, Murphy, and Romine."

yankees,3cc15c,TheZooBoy,-1,Tue Jul 7 14:09:24 2015 UTC,Yeah it's pretty pathetic that we won't call up prospects unless they have 1 1/2 + 2 years of AAA experience. Other teams move along there prospects much quicker than us.   Specifically: Severino should have already been called up. He's dealing can't pitch much better in AAA. He needs the MLB pitching staff's leadership to help him take his game to the next level more importantly he needs to face MLB hitters and find out what he needs to work on. Judge should be up on his raw power alone. Even if he hits for a shit average he could hit 25 HRs easily now. Refsnyder it's about his defense but the way we are hitting the ball I think we can sacrifice a few errors for quality everyday ABs. Bird has hit major slumps so he needs to time but I agree stop holding guys back. Players need MLB experience they need time for growing pains lets get that out of the way now not at age 26...please.

yankees,3cc15c,westernpaul,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:16:34 2015 UTC,"Refsnyder and errors? Our 50 million 3rd baseman leads the league with errors and is hitting a powerful, 250 or so. Didn't Cashman just sign a ""major league infielder and he is in the minors, you know off someones trash heap . There is no reason the poster suggestions are not forthcoming, except, we are the Yankees and will look to the dumpster for help, I see Ackerley from the M's is on the list. I live here in Seattle, and if not a long time Yankee fan, I would say take him, he would fit right in with Drew, a .175 hitter."
yankees,3cc15c,Badswitch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"Funny thing about Ref's defense...Early on in Jeter's career, he  made almost 60 errors during a season at the farm level.  There's going to be growing pains.  Ref's defense isn't above average yet, because he's been a OF for almost his whole life.  He was moved to the infield because he doesn't have enough pop to be a Major League RFer.  The good thing is that his defense has improved and right now I think he'd be a significant upgrade over Drew.  (Well just about anything would be.)"
