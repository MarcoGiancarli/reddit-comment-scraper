PoliceChases,3cn39h,benijuice,5,Thu Jul 9 04:43:07 2015 UTC,Why is the res thumbnail of a British police car?
PoliceChases,3cn39h,StumpyMcStump,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:19 2015 UTC,Clickbait?
PoliceChases,3cn39h,StumpyMcStump,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:13:28 2015 UTC,Or maybe the video was culled from a compilation of humvee stealing supercriminals
PoliceChases,3cn39h,dropkinn,3,Fri Jul 10 11:53:47 2015 UTC,"well, at least he bothered to signal"
PoliceChases,3cn39h,Semyonov,2,Fri Jul 10 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"Man they're lucky he didn't go head to head with the police and try to really get away, that thing is hard as hell to stop and I don't think you can PIT it."
PoliceChases,3cn39h,FatherStorm,2,Thu Jul 9 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"Just wait for it to run out of fuel. It may get where it's going, but it's not gonna get there particularly fast and it's gonna eat the shit outta some fuel getting there. Just grab a Wrangler and tag along."
PoliceChases,3cn39h,Semyonov,2,Thu Jul 9 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"Hahaha that's true, if he had decided to go offroad though the cops wouldn't have been able to track him unless they had something offroad capable (and not a lot of departments do)."

PoliceChases,3ck66r,Schemes011,7,Wed Jul 8 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"The logic of these ""free man on the land"" people is just baffling. I would love to see him pull that crap with US cops... There would be no calm talking to him after he didn't stop for them, just 50 cops with guns drawn."
PoliceChases,3ck66r,WestonP,6,Wed Jul 8 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"""Am I under arrest?"" ... ""WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!""   Odd, he seemed familiar with the process a second ago."
PoliceChases,3ck66r,terminalzero,5,Thu Jul 9 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"Brilliant. ""Am I under arrest?!""  Smash! ""Yes, you are under arrest!""  Twat, haha!"
PoliceChases,3ck66r,cooltom2006,3,Wed Jul 8 18:45:40 2015 UTC,Australian man discovers one weird trick to never get arrested. Cops hate him!   Yea.... that didnt quite work out aye
PoliceChases,3bz32z,snorting_gummybears,6,Fri Jul 3 08:59:40 2015 UTC,This video sucks....
PoliceChases,3bz32z,HammyClamshanks,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:16:04 2015 UTC,"the police did that cutting on purpose, to make it harder to see that the passenger was not carrying anything.  Its tough to see, but the passenger gets out and has nothing in his hands, and starts to move his hands up, but they open fire anyways.  Bad policy in action."
PoliceChases,3bz32z,chubbysumo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:47:05 2015 UTC,"It's really hard for me to see what's going on.  All I know is that they blurred the officer and there was a lot of gun fire on the police/trooper side.  I can't even make out if the guy had his hands up or what.  Dude's right, that's a sucky video."

PoliceChases,3b6n60,GKU,2,Fri Jun 26 12:00:31 2015 UTC,The chase ends with a PIT manoeuvre to avoid further danger after the suspect tries to get on the highway in the opposite direction
PoliceChases,3b6n60,drewniverse,3,Fri Jun 26 12:05:35 2015 UTC,That was pretty ballsy pit maneuver in front of all that traffic.
PoliceChases,3b6n60,Airazz,3,Fri Jun 26 17:16:51 2015 UTC,The cop saw an opportunity and he took it. Quite impressive.
PoliceChases,3b6n60,Freddy216b,2,Fri Jun 26 19:22:23 2015 UTC,Yeah indeed. They said they couldn't risk him getting on the highway against traffic
PoliceChases,3b5spy,Delirium101,0,Fri Jun 26 05:08:39 2015 UTC,"For supposedly being a professional driver, ghostrider holds the steering wheel like an asshole."
PoliceChases,3b5spy,xpurplexamyx,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:47:00 2015 UTC,I don't even know what that means.
PoliceChases,3b5spy,xpurplexamyx,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:37:49 2015 UTC,"Well, in the video you posted, he's driving at high speed, steering one handed with his hand resting on the middle of the wheel half the time and elbow resting against the window. Not exactly what could be called precision driving techniques, but I guess motorbike skills don't necessarily transfer to cars."
PoliceChases,3b5spy,1337Heretic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"You only see one hand in frame. His other hand is likely on the wheel off-frame also. Also, the next time you drive on a track, take a look at your own technique. If you are up shifting and down shifting constantly and you still manage to keep both hands on the wheel, you have a third hand. This guy clearly knows how to drive professionally. I suspect this is staged. Certainly edited as the engine revs often don't match the tachometer."
