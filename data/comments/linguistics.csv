linguistics,3e3tel,notgrandiloquent,17,Tue Jul 21 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"You might be interested in some of the sources in    Joseph & Newmeyer (2012 [PDF]) 'All languages are equally complex': the rise and fall of a consensus   published in the journal Historiographia Linguistica, which is an interesting account of how this idea of all languages being equally complex began to be something which was emphasized but also how recently you have linguists working on trying to figure out how to measure complexity and see to what extent languages measure equally on whatever metrics they use.  It's worth emphasizing that ""complexity"" means something different to non-linguists, and that ""all languages are equally complex"" is something that often gets emphasized because there are pervasive folk notions that some languages just inherently are ""primative"" or ""not developed"" -- that there's something inherent to the grammar of African American Vernacular English instead of a historical accident and socio-policial pressures why it's not used to write articles in Cell or Nature.  So, if McWhorter (2001) wants to define a metric of complexity involving how marked a language's phonemic inventory is, the processing of more syntactic rules (his examples are matrix vs subordinate asymmetries and split morphosyntactic alignment systems), the extent to which it ""gives overt and grammaticalized expression to more fine-grained semantic and/or pragmatic distinctions than another"", and the presense of inflectional morphology, and then figure out a way to measure these components and compare languages based on this, that's all well and good.  But it's a very different sense of complexity than what most people have when they want to ask if Mandarin is as complex as German. Whatever specific metric McWhorter or others might have to determine ""complexity"" is a different thing entirely from saying that some languages are less expressive or sophisticated or well-suited to particular domains than others. And it's this latter sense of ""complexity"" that people emphasize no languages is inherently ""better"" than another.  The Joseph and Newmeyer paper talks about some volumes from the last decade such as:   Miestamo, Sinnemäki, and Karlson (2008) Language Complexity: Typology, contact, change  Sampson, Gil, Trudgill (2009) Language Complexity as an Evolving Variable   the introductions of which you might be interested in looking at as well.   I don't work in language complexity so I don't know how well received these papers, books, or similar ones are in the field as a whole, but it's more than just McWhorter at least. It's still a relatively recent research question -- figuring out how to even figure out what you want to use to determine ""complexity"", or how to measure it, let alone to the extent languages differ.  You linked McWhorter (2001), but you may also be interested in the commentary to that paper by Hagège, Seuren, Arends, Kusters & Muysken, Lefebvre, DeGraff, Ansaldo & Matthews, Gil, Trudgill, Dahl, and Wurzel.   Anyway, again, I do not work on creoles, on information theory, on complexity, on typology, or anything super related to this; so take my ramblings with some grains of salt. There are people in /r/linguistics who have much more informed things to say on the topic."

How you'd seperate a language's grammar from a language itself is simple, so long as there is some part of a language that is beyond its grammar. Basically, if you were able to produce an absolutely perfect and complete grammar and lexicon of a language, would this be sufficient to use the language in a perfectly native fashion? Or is there something more to  the communicative context? I would say there is, but whether that thing is part of ""a language"" or a part ""language"" as general thing is a bit hairier. It's that thing that's key when some linguists talk about all languages being equally complex, since some discuss complexity relative to communicative capacity.   So, are all languages equally complex in their grammar? While over the last hundred years the field has been leaning more and more toward ""yes"", and most intro textbooks and the like will still say ""yes"", there are some researchers who are producing findings that seem to point to the contrary. It's a question in need of further study. Are all languages equally complex in regards to their ability to communicate relevant ideas? The consensus is yes, though this is also not completely unanimous."

Creole languages seem to have similar grammars, which I think can fairly be characterized as ""bare bones"" in many important ways.  You could call them less complex; from his generative perspective, Bickerton says instead that they're, if anything, unspoiled, ""springing pure and clear from the very fountain of language"", unmarred by historical excrescences and random cruft.  An important caveat is that, even though I think it's reasonable to define some metrics by which some languages may be grammaticaly ""simpler"" (intuitively, with less moving parts), all languages still seem to be equally expressive.  Tok Pisin grammar may be simpler than Hungarian, but you can still translate László Krasznahorkai into Tok Pisin (or any other natural language)."

He said that he once noticed that when you watch old cartoons from the 40's and 50's, all the old people are portrayed as talking like hillbillies. He was confused by this and did some research, and it turned out that old folks back then did actually tend to talk with country accents, because an overwhelming majority of them had been born and raised in the country, only to move to urban centers for jobs later in life. I would bet that the same shift would be partly responsible for what you describe."
linguistics,3e16c3,Singaporecane,22,Tue Jul 21 04:41:21 2015 UTC,"Which seems like it's also a big factor in unique city-dialects slowly dying out, dialects that come from immigrant communities who settled in cities upon immigration and whose dialects mixed with other immigrant communities to create new accents specific to certain areas, especially over generations as long as the communities stay mostly insular. When city areas become less insular and less multi-generational the accents die out, many children whose parents had the accents learn to talk both with and without it much like second generation immigrants who learn their parent's home language and also the common language. And the accents they learn outside their accented parents and communities are going to be the most homogenized ones available to them.  Television and mass electronic media also almost definitely plays a big role as well in promoting a common accent, as well as making people identify more with mass culture and identity than the local identities of previous generations."

Also recording media have exponentially improved since the days of magnetic tape recording which degrades slowly in storage.  All of this means that we are now used to hearing a much wider range of frequencies in our recordings with much less distortion.

In terms of phonology, I suspect that the two main factors in play are widespread, ""global"" changes in American speech over time, and the rural influence that Singaporecane mentions. In the first category I might put things like a more constricted pronunciation of /eɪ/ and /oʊ/ (the ""Canadian"" thing you mention), and a higher realization of /ɔ/, around cardinal [ɔ]. (Modern GA speakers are likely to be cot-caught merged, or to have a comparatively subtle [ɑ]/[ɒ] distinction.)

This is probably the worst example ever, but listen to this voice acting in Call of Duty: Black Ops made in 2010, which is set in the 1960s.  When I played this game, I was completely unconvinced by the voice acting.  They TOTALLY sound like voice acting that has been popular in the movies only in the last 10 or so years: extremely (IMO exaggerated) deep, gruff, and tough-sounding voices for the males.  They do not sound like people from clips from the Vietnam war and that era in general at all (I agree that people from clips (which of course is another ""filter"" that changes what we hear of the pitch of their voices) from the 60s sounded more high-pitched and nasal in general).  I haven't seen that many movies that were made in the 1960s but I don't think any of them have male characters with voices that come close to that ""exaggerated"" gruffness either - with the big exception of Westerns, I'd say.  It's a bad example because 1. It's about voice acting instead of regular real life speech and 2. I'm using war or ""masculine"" genre movies/video games as examples, which is also far away from regular life.  And it may be due to the huge influence of just a few actors on Hollywood's image of the ideal tough guy, like Clint Eastwood and Bruce Willis or something, instead of something much broader in society.  But still, I wanted to bring it up since it's still what a certain age imagined was the speech of a certain type of person, and that may be indicative of what was going on in the language of broader society.  I doubt the average player of Call of Duty felt anything was off, but I really gotta say that the voice acting in the game took me out of the moment every time and made me super conscious that the voice acting was really trying to sound like what we today think of as tough-guy voices, not what we think tough-guy voices were like in the 1960s."

I've dealt quite a bit with the whole determinism/relativism argument and the original paper infuriated me to no end — especially because of the attitude many academics have towards linguistics, namely that it's something everyone can do, no training required because they use language all the time which automatically makes them experts, right? Same reason that Jules Davidoff and Lera Boroditsky are my academic archenemies, only they haven't revised their claims in spite of heavy criticism from many linguists.  Paul Kay is one of the more prominent linguists I know of that have changed their viewpoint radically over the years. He's gone from strictly universalist (when he co-authored Basic Color Terms with Brent Berlin back in 1969) to moderate relativist recently after doing some super interesting research in the color domain with Terry Regier and others.

It appeared to be amenable to common sense, so he didn't realize he really need to consult an expert.

Therefor, we attempted to say them as fast as possible. I tested out all of the ones that I've come across and saying them as fast as I could, the one that forced me to wait an amount of time closest to 10 seconds--while saying it 10 times--was hippopotamus. Here are my scores for each one.   one-thousand: 5.61 (3 syl.)  alligator: 5.65  (4 syl.)  crocodile: 6.69 (3 syl.)  Mississippi: 7.16 (4 syl.)  Piccadilly: 7.18 (4 syl.)  elephant: 5.65 (3 syl.)  hippopotamus: 9.25 (5 syl.)  I also learned from this that sound combinations also play a big role in how long the word takes, alongside number of syllables. 'elephant' and 'alligator' have different numbers of syllables (3 and 4), but took the same amount of time to say. 'Mississippi', 'Piccadilly', 'one-thousand', and 'alligator' all have four syllables, but the first two took over seven seconds to complete, but the second two were both 'alligator' was well under 6 seconds.

Jackendoff’s support of Behme&Evans (2015) shows that he also does not share the views defended by Adger (2015).   The most natural interpretation is that Jackendoff has come out to say that Behme and Evans are right. Does anybody know if he ever said that? It could also mean that Jackendoff has said something that Behme and Evans take as support for them, does anybody know what that could be?

linguistics,3e0tu0,babelbubbles,8,Tue Jul 21 05:01:37 2015 UTC,"That just couldn't be any more false.  There isn't much use to debating these issues, as discussion over the ""physical reality"" of entities used by chemists in the 19th century (atoms, etc.) wasn't of much use.  All the work done on Newton's model wasn't useless. Pre-Keynesian economics wasn't useless. Our early work on atoms (which assumed they were indivisible units) wasn't useless either.  Whatever turns out to be the case, work on GG has already brought about major discoveries about restrictions on many a language's syntax. The world of theoretical syntax will just never be the same after Binding Theory, islands, Relativised Minimality or Cinque's functional sequence. Just as the world of physics was never the same after Newton's equations, however fundamentally wrong they were.  The same goes for cognitive linguistics and functionalism. I'm not going to enumerate their achievements as there's simply no way I'll do it right, but I can at least mention that CxG set a new standard for how to describe non-compositional semantics and functionalism gave birth to phonology as we know it.  That's not to say we shouldn't try to find evidence for and against an innate Faculty of Language distinct from ""general learning mechanisms"" (if such thing exists). But we clearly don't have convincing evidence yet. Not evidence as convincing as, say, the one we have for the actual existence of atoms.  Until then, theoretical linguistics can try different paths, and whatever we do, if we're analysing the data, describing it and trying to explain it, it's not useless work.  Edit: Obviously reinventing the wheel isn't too useful. It might be in some cases, but it can be overdone. I'm not arguing for having a divided field. I'm just saying that whatever turns out to be the case, our work on theoretical linguistics has already been eye-opening, and it's certainly going to influence future science, just how you can see the influence the work by Bloomfield and Z. Harris had on GG.  The same can be said about GG and cognitive linguistics. Let's not forget cognitive linguistics came to existence as a sort of extension of generative semantics, and was populated to a great extent by Chomsky's students."
linguistics,3e0tu0,greenuserman,8,Tue Jul 21 05:57:32 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt there's a lot to learn from each other. Generativists are typically perfectly happy to borrow from other approaches, though not always ecumenical enough to seek them out. Talmy, for instance: his work on the Figure/Ground distinction, and on verb-framed vs. satellite-framed languages, has been hugely influential. Needless to say, Evans is not exactly helping the prospects for this kind of fruitful exchange in the future.  There is a basic asymmetry though, that you don't mention. Namely, generativism is compatible with a good chunk of the functionalist literature. We don't deny that there are functionalist/domain-general explanations for some things, simply that they exhaust all of the facts about the language faculty. So we're quite happy when there's a good functionalist explanation of something; we just happen to focus on areas where we think they are less likely. It seems like the majority of  functionalists/cognitive linguists/etc do claim that functional/domain general explanations tell us everything about language. Which entails, of course, that generativism has to just be completely wrong. Correspondingly, you see more attacks on generativism than vice-versa, and very few examples of generativist analyses being borrowed by functionalists. That is my impression, anyway, maybe this is restricted to the more prominent functionalists. I'd be interested to hear of generativist analyses being borrowed by functionalists, if anyone has any examples."

There's a huge difference between fiery debates in single field (like GG work in the past) and having very different citation streams, like now.  I don't know many in functional or cognitive work citing MP much, and don't know anyone in MP with deep knowledge of other approaches (I'm sure plenty exist).    That's not to say we shouldn't try to find evidence for and against an innate Faculty of Language distinct from ""general learning mechanisms"" (if such thing exists).

linguistics,3e0tu0,babelbubbles,-3,Tue Jul 21 08:14:20 2015 UTC,"I felt bad for saying that we need even more debate, and then not debating. So:   Given that Adger is one of the foremost experts on the Chomskyan framework one could conclude that currently no empirical evidence supporting the biolinguistic claims is available.   Evans basically points out that Adger didn't provide any mechanistic idea of how UG works in the brain (Hiding behind Mars levels is just that.)  Has there been progress in this in the UG community that Adger just didn't mention?  Do people think they'll ever have one, or any inkling of what it would be?    In any event, Adger’s quibbles seem rather pointless because one data analysis can suggest universals and one can propose a universal based on the study of one language.   Some people have read CHF 2005 to imply that if a language didn't show a universal in UG, that doesn't disprove it as a universal.  Do people in the UG camp here take that position? If a magical language shows up that really provably has no recursion, would you doubt UG because of it, or just dismiss the language as an outlier?   It is curious that Adger would comment that “paragraphs [in Behme&Evans (2015)] are packed with citations as though that counted as an argument” without providing specific examples of instances where citations were used as arguments and not as supporting evidence for arguments.   General question- do people that hate on these Evans and Behme attacks ever read the cited material?  Or do they just their eyes and assume it's all drivel?"

Has there been progress in this in the UG community that Adger just didn't mention? Do people think they'll ever have one, or any inkling of what it would be?   If the Marrian approach is on the right track, then generative research just is evidence for 'how UG works in the brain.' The multi-level approach assumes that computational theories are abstract theories about the brain, and this is one of the most crucial methodological foundations of generative linguistics. Now maybe you think Marr's levels are a waste of time, and maybe Evans does too. But his book doesn't mention Marr once, and I don't think any of his articles do either. He can't claim that there is no evidence for 'how UG works in the brain' without giving an argument against Marr's levels.  Such an argument would deal with the examples from the history of science that support a top-down approach, as /u/greenuserman mentions. I always use the example of Mendel because it makes the case very clear. Was Mendel wrong to formulate the Law of Independent Assortment without providing a 'mechanistic idea' of 'how it works in the body?' Should we have said that there was no 'biological evidence' for genes, which were, at the time, abstract hypothetical posits? We can see in retrospect that this would have been disastrous- how would DNA have been discovered without some idea from genetic theory of what to look for? As Gallistel (a neuroscientist) points out, the analogy holds perfectly for the relation of computational cognitive theories (like linguistics) to neuroscience.  You can find a more extended argument along these lines here (which, I think, pretty much captures the attitude of generativists towards neuroscience and the prospects for unification with linguistics). Again, maybe you disagree with this, and maybe Evans does too. But if a very well-regarded neuroscientist (and Poeppel's not the only one) is saying this, Evans really ought to deal with the arguments. And he doesn't. It's not that he argues against them badly, he just flat out ignores them.  Incidentally, here's a recent-ish example of this kind of approach having some success. Note that it doesn't really tell us anything about linguistics- we've known about distinctive features since at least Jakobson. But taking what phonologists said seriously, and looking for their computational posits in the brain, turned out to be very useful; just as taking Mendel seriously was useful in discovering DNA. This is really saying nothing more than that we have to know what the brain does, to know how it does it.   General question- do people that hate on these Evans and Behme attacks ever read the cited material? Or do they just their eyes and assume it's all drivel?   Do you mean the material that Evans and Behme cite? Yes, most of it's been around for a while, and I'm reasonably familiar with it. It's not what they cite that's the problem. It's the persistent mischaracterisation of our views, and his unwillingness to engage with the actual arguments, that upsets me. I think my feelings are representative.  Look at how Evans deals with Adger's claim that he misrepresented Chomsky. Adger points out that Evans quotes the first part of a Chomsky paragraph (saying that you can propose a universal on the basis of a single language), but leaves out the qualifying context (where he says that you have to check other languages). So what does he do? He quotes the first part of the Chomsky paragraph again, leaves out the second part, and asks where the misrepresentation is! It's disagraceful scholarship. Who would like being called a cult member by someone who is unwilling or unable to even characterise our positions fairly?"

Has there been progress in this in the UG community that Adger just didn't mention? Do people think they'll ever have one, or any inkling of what it would be?    Well, obviously, if you're acquainted with Jackendoff's work, that's what he's been doing for the last twenty years. The Minimalist Program has also been a big step in that direction for mainstream GG. The arguments there are mostly arguing for plausibility. By minimising what's specific to language, MP tries to leave the question of how the sensory-motor and conceptual-intentional systems are implemented in the brain to other sciences.  We're far from finding unification, though. *That said, do note that macroeconomics was for a long time not founded on microeconomics, evolutionary theory wasn't always founded on genetics, and chemistry wasn't always founded on physics --in fact, they used to be incompatible. But don't worry: we all dream of the day we can have a theory that at the same time deals elegantly with sloppy reading in instances of ellipsis in Japanese and can tell what's happening in the brain. But it's not true that explicitly building our theories bottom-up from our current knowledge of the brain is guaranteed* to work. (Hint: that's not how it worked for chemistry, biology or economics)   Some people have read CHF 2005 to imply that if a language didn't show a universal in UG, that doesn't disprove it as a universal.   Some people have been using some pretty interesting mind-stretching techniques when reading anything even partially written by Chomsky. That doesn't mean their conclusions make sense.  An important thing to note is that UG isn't a ""set of universals"".   If a magical language shows up that really provably has no recursion, would you doubt UG because of it, or just dismiss the language as an outlier?   I'm not going to be nitpicky, and I'm actually going to answer what you meant to say instead of what you said. Sadly, the answer is still no. I'd doubt recursion's status as a fundamental property of human languages, and its status as a part of UG, but disproving one consequence of a current model of UG hardly disproves UG itself.

linguistics,3dujkp,wurrukatte,22,Sun Jul 19 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that this isn't just an Old English phenomenon or even restricted to Germanic, but is basically true of all Indo-European languages that make that case distinction.  Modern German, for example, obviously closely related to Old English, still does the exact same thing: Ich fahre in die (accusative) Stadt 'I'm driving into the city / going downtown,' but Ich wohne in der (dative) Stadt 'I live in the city.'  Supposedly, the historical reason that accusative frequently has an allative (motion towards) meaning hearkens way back to ""early"" PIE, when an actual separate ""allative"" case existed but later merged with the accusative (but is still distinguished in Hittite, for example)."
linguistics,3dujkp,odd-as-he-is,4,Sun Jul 19 17:32:32 2015 UTC,"Is there a similar thing with Latin?  Some prepositions in Latin take the accusative, and others the ablative.  The accusative ones have a theme of going to something, a directive sense, as you say, whereas ablative prepositions are either ust plain locative, or, well, ablative.   Compare ""super"" [acc] over and ""super"" [abl] above, or ""in"" [acc] into, and ""in"" [abl] inside"
linguistics,3dujkp,sje46,8,Mon Jul 20 00:01:07 2015 UTC,"Aye, that's what /u/odd-as-he-is meant to point out.  In Latin the PIE locative and instrumental cases fell together with the ablative, so the ablative had to work as two different locational cases, but three cases in total.  A similar thing happened with Germanic, where the ablative seems to have fallen together with the dative, but there are ablative uses with the genitive in Gothic. This could point to the fact that the ablative didn't merge with the dative cleanly, or it could just be Gothic following Greek usage, as in Greek the accusative, dative and genitive serve as allative, locative and ablative, respectively."

linguistics,3dtsk1,Prince-Cola,11,Sun Jul 19 11:40:45 2015 UTC,"(Anecdotal evidence incoming. Leaving it here anyway as there isn't a better answer at the time.)  I took a class last year on Nordic Literature. My professor was Swedish and she said that translations to non-Nordic languages of the Eddas were quite bad in comparison with translations to Nordic languages. So we'd read the texts in either English or Spanish (because most of the students didn't speak any North Germanic language) but she'd often mention some lost nuances and read the original version for us to listen to. She'd also read the Swedish version sometimes as she felt more comfortable reading it.  To my ears, the ""feel"" you got from listening to the Swedish version was very similar to the one you got from listening to the original version. In particular, the alliteration and consonance in the original often translated directly to the Swedish version.  Of course, I'm not entirely certain whether this applies to Norwegian, but I'd guess so."

Adding to what greenuserman said, I've read some of the prose Edda translated to Spanish by Borges and I felt he took a few liberties, I would expect the same in English given how much non-Germanic vocabulary there is.  I can read some Bokmål and less Old Icelandic (enough to follow the prose Edda with a lot of help). Since you're Norwegian you could try having the Norwegian text next to the original; the grammar is quite different, the main thing being the cases, if you have studied German you will have an easy time comparing the two texts.  I found the Eddas to be fun, and finding things that are obviously references in recent texts added to that. If you have read The Hobbit it's a gold mine."

There are definitely similarities between the families, and that's why people like to group them together into Altaic, but the relationship hasn't been proven by reconstructing a proto-language and convincingly showing regular sound correspondences. Because there's no solid evidence, most linguists assume they aren't related and that the similarities are due to coincidence or sprachbund.  Sorry, I don't have any sources for this, but I'm fairly certain this is the common view in mainstream linguistics, but anyone can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."
linguistics,3dse9g,Spitalian,10,Sun Jul 19 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"To expand on that a bit – the ""traditional"" form of the Altaic hypothesis comprises Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic (the language family of the Manchus and some Siberian peoples), but nowadays most of the pro-Altaicists also include Korean and Japonic. But either way, those who accept it are a minority among historical linguists.  On the other hand, many general reference texts (written by non-historical linguists) do accept Altaic – and other speculative families such as Khoisan or Australian – somewhat credulously, giving the impression that they're better established than they really are."

Generally, the more ""up to date"" a person is on their historical linguistics, the less likely it is they accept Altaic.  What frequently happens on Wikipedia is that the page for the hypothesis itself is decent, because it attracts a lot of attention (and knowledgeable editors), but pages which reference the Altaic hypothesis do not get as much attention. So what you get is a lot of pages that state that such-and-such language is (possibly) member of the Altaic family, or whatever, because no one's scrutinizing them as hard.   This happens with a lot of theories/hypotheses on Wikipedia tho; it's one of the shortcomings of the model."
linguistics,3dse9g,millionsofcats,5,Sun Jul 19 11:51:18 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna keep it in broad stokes because this is more of a side interest than an actual research focus for me, and also I'm lazy today.  The Altaic hypothesis is mostly based on typological similarities, rather than historical reconstructions. Unfortunately, typology is not a very good basis for a proposed relationship. Proposed proto-Turkic typology and proposed proto-Mongolic typology have similarities, but so do many others. There are only so many possible combinations of typologies, so finding similar adjacent ones isn't at all surprising, and so isn't necessarily meaningful.  If they are related, they diverged longer ago than the several thousand year ""expiration date"" on typical historical linguistics methods. That's really at the root of the debate. Phonological reconstructions can determine relationships with a high degree of certainty, but they can only go so far back. Typological proposals reach further back, but aren't as established.  One interesting recent contribution is 2015 Robbeets ""Common denominal verbalizers in the Transeurasion languages: borrowed or inherited?"" where he challenges the conventional interpretation of a set of grammatical markers with similar forms and similar meanings in proto-Japonic, proto-Koreanic, proto-Tungusic, proto-Mongolic, and proto-Turkic. Assuming his reconstructions are valid, I'd say it's fairly persuasive that these markers were inherited from a common source (suggesting that theses languages were all related), but I'm a bit outside my area so I'm waiting to see some responses to it before i drink the kool-aid."

There is evidence of a link in typological reconstructions but not really in phonological reconstructions. Phonological reconstruction techniques are well understood and believed, but have a horizon problem if we try to go back more than a few thousand years. Typological reconstructions say they see similarities and can see back further than phonological comparisons, but the validity of the technique has yet to be completely accepted or measured by the academy."
linguistics,3dse9g,laughingfuzz1138,2,Sun Jul 19 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"Just a couple corrections (could be the fault of my explanation):  There are observed typological similarities, but typological reconstructions aren't a thing, though typological comparisons are often made based on the proposed typologies of reconstructed proto-languages.   Typological comparisons as a tool for proposing genetic relationships has been tested and proven to be unreliable, when used on its own. You can have a cluster of languages that are VERY similar typologically, but provable as unrelated, partially because it's difficult to distinguish between shared descent and borrowing in typological comparisons, and in part because there are only so many possible combinations of typologies"

The combinations that sound especially un-Japanese are things like:  をい (woi, I can only think of one word off the top of my head that actually begins with ""wo"", and most of the time people write and pronounce it as ""お/o"". In general it's extremely uncommon to use in actual words, it's almost exclusively used as a grammatical particle, and that particle never comes at the beginning of a sentence)  えーる (eeru, it sounds close to ""eru"", an actual Japanese word, but the elongated vowel makes it sound foreign)  ぬっあ (nu'a, glottal stops are typically only used before consonants, or at the very beginning or end of a word in casual or emphatic language.

linguistics,3dsn5o,salpfish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:31:45 2015 UTC,"TIL there's more than one type of stop. Neat.  So it turns out it is indeed a geminate before consonants, but otherwise little tsu does function as a glottal stop (ipa symbol ʔ). It's commonly used in emphatic written language or interjections, such as in things like はーっ (haa'), えっっ (e''), or んっ (n'). It's sometimes even used on its own (typically in graphic novels or any other text that attempts to directly mimic spoken language and utterances) to symbolize a sort of throat hitching type of noise.  It can technically be used before vowels since it would function as a glottal stop in such a position, and most Japanese people would quickly figure out how to pronounce it correctly if they saw it like that, but it's just not something that's done in Japanese. So while there's technically no reason Hawaii couldn't be written ハワイッイ, it's just not, and is instead written ハワイ like you said.

linguistics,3dsn5o,itsudatte,0,Tue Jul 21 08:35:53 2015 UTC,"Transcribing utterance-final cutoffs with っ is one thing, but that still doesn't mean っ actually represents a phonemic glottal stop in any meaningful way. ハワイ couldn't be written ハワイッイ any more than it could be written ｑヴぇｒ０ｑ, since that's simply not how the Japanese orthography works. Maybe a Japanese speaker would figure it out, but similarly in English you can attempt to pronounce ""hsjebsjsjbdjs"" as used in the OP and you'll probably get something coherent out. But the result either breaks the phonotactics of English or twists its spelling rules enough, so we call it ""unpronounceable""."
linguistics,3dsn5o,salpfish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:25:31 2015 UTC,"Saying little tsu does not represent a glottal stop in ""any meaningful way"" is like saying ""th"" in English does not represent θ in any meaningful way because it can be pronounced ð. っ is equally a geminate and a glottal stop, and its use as a glottal stop is vital for representing certain utterances and styles of speech. If you don't believe me you're welcome to look it up for yourself as I did with the geminate thing. We're all here to learn and discuss, not to argue~  As for why Hawaii is not ハワイッイ, that's because it simply isn't. Orthography describes what generally is and is not written, not what can and cannot be written. ""ｑヴぇｒ０ｑ"" could be a word in Japanese if they decided both on a way to pronounce it and that it was worthy of being a word, but it's extremely unlikely since the spelling completely flies in the face of even the slangiest of Japanese terms, and the pronunciation would be very strange indeed (considerably more strange than ハワイッイ).  Speaking of, if you search up ""ハワイッイ"" you'll find that a small handful of people do appear to write it that way despite it not being ""proper"". In fact, looking around it seems there are millions of instances of people using little tsu before vowels despite it not following the generally accepted way of doing things. See, unlike with English, the phonotactics of Japanese cannot be broken by virtue of the way the language is structured. What Japanese lacks in phonetic flexibility, it makes up in stability. That's why you can twist Japanese any way you please and it will not break, because it can only be twisted so far before it simply cannot be twisted any further no matter how hard you try. English on the other hand is so flexible that you can just keep twisting and twisting until you end up with things that cannot be pronounced reasonably by any human mouth."
linguistics,3dsn5o,itsudatte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:36:31 2015 UTC,"When looking up ハワイッイ, all I could find were people using it as a pronunciation guide, followed by an explanation of how the ッ is pronounced there. I'm very much aware of the utterance-final glottal stop representation, but I've simply never encountered it anywhere else. (Though I'd love to see some of the other examples.)  I'm not sure I agree with the comparison to the English <th> either, since both pronunciations can actually be found in pretty much any position. It'd be more like saying a word like <ic> could be pronounced /ɪs/. Yes, <c> sometimes represents /s/, but it's never used that way word-finally.  And ""flexibility"" and ""stability"" aside, this would already be an example of the Japanese phonotactics being broken. Some people do analyze っ as a phonemic /ʔ/, but this is disallowed before vowels. So a glottal stop before a vowel expressly breaks the rules. It's certainly pronounceable, but it's not something Japanese allows any more than it allows [θ] or [ð]."
linguistics,3dsn5o,salpfish,7,Tue Jul 21 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yep! In a way at least. Everything is almost possibly pronouncable at least with some liberty to assume epenthetic vowels or glottal stops, so what I'm going to assume words that sound ""wrong"" or violate phonotactics.  It's cheating in a way but Japanese itself has a syllabic (moraic), assimilating nasal (uvular by default) that develops from a historical non-initial mu. As such the N'-kana can't itself begin a word. Additionally geminate consonants can't begin a word, so anything beginning with chibii tsu is not a word as well  But for actually violating phonotactics in a pure CV language Old Japanese had a rule which didn't permit any of the r-series of kana to begin a word, so for it a word like *rase wouldn't have really sounded like anything other than maybe someone took out an a from a word like *arase."

linguistics,3drxsj,Choosing_is_a_sin,2,Mon Jul 20 08:24:30 2015 UTC,"Just from the top of my head: under a control-as-movement account, could it be that the copy of ""James"" at TP is deleted and Spec/TP functions somehow as an escape hatch in infinitival clauses? On the other hand, finite-clauses have their Spec/TPs occupied by the clause's subject.  Compare (1) and (2).   What did James wonder [CP whether [TP <what> to <James> discover <what>]]? *What did James wonder [CP whether [TP Richard <Richard> discovered <what>]]?   Whether Spec/TP can somehow function as an escape hatch depends on your theory of locality, but it seems to be the most conservative explanation of the facts."

Under exclusively Phase-theoretic accounts of locality, it doesn't seem to help much. That said, the PIC is rarely taken to be the only locality condition in current work.  Spec/TP as a middle step might still avoid some locality effects. Exactly which (if any), as I said, depends on your theory of locality. I can't think of any Relativised Minimality effects that apply to this case. Spec/TP as a middle step could be part of a* strategy to skip a criterial position in the left periphery as in Rizzi and Shlonsky (2007)."

This is licensed by the presence of there in English and null expletives in other languages.   What do you think that there is <what> in the box? *What do you think that <what> is in the box?   Apart from that article, you should probably read Shlonsky (2014), in Aboh et al. (2014) Locality, which deals with the same topic and likely cites relevant recent sources.  (1) I say ""seems"" because it's been quite some time since I read that article, so I don't remember if they somehow made their approach compatible with the PIC.

linguistics,3drg01,mamashaq,3,Sat Jul 18 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"Abstract:   Vibrant online communities are in constant flux. As members join and depart, the interactional norms evolve, stimulating further changes to the membership and its social dynamics. Linguistic change --- in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the norm --- is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates individual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective identity.  We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as it happens and for understanding how specific users react to these evolving norms. By applying this framework to two large online communities we show that users follow a determined two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to linguistic change: a linguistically innovative learning phase in which users adopt the language of the community followed by a conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving community norms pass them by.  Building on this observation, we show how this framework can be  used to detect, early in a user's career, how long she will stay active in the community. Thus, this work has practical significance for those who design and maintain online communities. It also yields new theoretical insights into the evolution of linguistic norms and the complex interplay between community-level and individual-level linguistic change."

He looked at a bunch of transcribed telephone conversations, most of which occurred around 2003. And in his ""I feel like"" post, he describes the ways in which men and women use different kinds of phrases to hedge their claims.  He found that women use ""I feel like"" and ""I think"" more than men do, but this fact doesn't support the notion that women hedge more often than men.  Men preface their claims with the phrases ""I guess"" and ""I believe"" more than women do, plus they use inter-clausal qualifiers such as ""seems,"" ""somewhat,"" and ""probably"" more often than women.  When you look at the numbers, Liberman concludes, men hedge just as often as women do, they just use slightly different words to do it. So the fact that women say ""I feel like"" more than men only suggests what everybody in linguistics already knows, which is that women tend to lead language change. In this way, their use of ""I feel like"" is a kind of leadership, not a sign of passivity.  So it appears as if I only felt like the women in my classes were hedging more often than the men. I wasn't listening closely enough to hear the sneakier qualifiers that the men were using within their sentences. When I think back, I don't remember ever saying, ""What do you mean Eliot is 'probably' using the metaphor of the crab scuttling against the floors of silent seas to describe his loneliness? He's either doing it or he's not doing it, Eric! Be more direct or they'll eat you alive in boardroom!""  My urge to ""help"" women ""lean in"" was misguided, given that men lean back just as much.  When I confessed this to Dr. Matthew Gordon, he put me in my place like only a linguistics scholar can. He said, ""The general effort to get women to avoid hedges is certainly well-intentioned but also part of a long tradition of advising women to reshape their linguistic behavior to be more like men's."""

You should ""hedge"" only as a clarification that you don't know something as a fact.   ""Is this model the fastest car this brand makes?"" ""I believe it is.""

But if the question was something answered with an opinion, it's automatically assumed to be something the second speaker believes.  Much like with all grammar, the entire purpose is that you are able to convey your meaning to the other person in a way that they are able to understand it.  By using ""hedge"" words when it isn't relevant, a part of the conversation you're communicating is that you're not confident in yourself.  Listening to someone who isn't confident in what they're saying is very frustrating, because in the back of your mind, you assume they don't know what they're talking about.  Rich isn't wrong that trying to get women to change their patterns to more closely emulate a mans is part of the whole gendered language problem.

The bar is telling you the vowels are not each given their own syllable. Without it, if this is a truly narrow transcription, you would assume two adjacent vowels are not a diphthong but are instead a case of hiatus. Further complicating things, the breve below a vowel also marks that the vowel is not syllabic.   So the vowel with the mark below followed by two vowels with a bar should ideally be either three vowels with a single bar over them, or two with a bar over them and then also a long-vowel mark.  However neither of those will render well on a computer.  So, assuming there's not something else weird going on (which is always possible), /ɑ̯ɑ͡ɒu͡ɯ/ should probably be /ɑ͡ːɒ.u͡ɯ/.

linguistics,3dppxg,keyilan,8,Sat Jul 18 10:17:14 2015 UTC,"To me, Marshallese looks like Georgian with all its consonant clusters replaced by vowels.   😂   Could someone please explain the function of the ties between the vowels and the breves below the vowels? I'm not sure if whether long vowels, a vowel following another separately, dipthongs, or tripthongs are being indicated.   I've wondered about that before, too. From what I can tell, there is no difference between a breve and the tie1; they're just diphthongs - or triphthongs, like in 'America' [ɑ̯ɑ͡æ].  Now, I'm not an expert on Marshallese, but the Wiki page gives a pretty good overview of the phonology. As you already see from your examples, all consonants have some secondary articulation.2  According to the analysis presented there, this secondary articulation plays a huge part in vowel allophony. So between two consonants with different secondary articulations, vowels turn into diphthongs, resulting in a huge phonetic diphthong and vowel inventory, even though there are only four phonemic vowels specified for height. So for example, a word like /tʲɜkʷ/ is realised as [tʲɛ͡ɔkʷ], with the vowel appearing as its ""palatal"" allophone [ɛ] next to palatalised /tʲ/ and as its ""labialised"" allophone next to labialised /kʷ/.  What adds to the confusion is that there are probably underlying glides /j/ /w/ and /ɰ/ which don't appear on the surface, but work just like the secondary articulation feature, coloring the vowels as well, so e.g. [mʲææ̯], [mʲæ͡ɑɑ̯] and [mʲæ͡ɒɒ̯] would be analysed as /mʲaj/, /mʲaɰ/ and /mʲaw/.  So, from your examples, something like [kʷɔ͡ʌmˠːʌ͡ɔː͡ɛlʲ] would probably be analysed as phonemic /kʷɜmˠːɜwɜlʲ/, with the vowel /ɜ/ being realised as [ɔ] next to a rounded consonant, [ʌ] next to a velarised one and [ɛ] next to a palatalised one, and then you just get combinations of those between different consonants.  TLDR: Secondary articulation on consonants turns small vowel inventory into huge mess when transcribed phonetically.   1 Except that the tie is not a standard way to indicate diphthongs...  2 I think the way the IPA expresses these further adds to the visual weirdness. Got phonemic secondary articulation? Sorry kid, your language is gonna look weird."

If you pick up a copy of Timberlake's grammar of Russian, you'll see he adopts a clumsier practice for a similar goal. Instead of using two separate vowel letters suggesting different targets for one vowel, he uses the IPA fronting subscript offset to one side or the other, so that in a word like /matʲ/ ' the fronting diacritic would be offset to the right, and in a word like /mʲat/ it would be offset to the left, and in /mʲatʲ/ there would be two diacritics next to each other. It's a pain in the ass to input and read, however--I really wish he'd just used a scheme like you see in Comrie, Stone, and Polinksy's The Russian Language in the 20th Century."

linguistics,3domp8,cronos844,4,Fri Jul 17 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"This is linguistic form that is common in Semitic languages called a genetive construction.  Virtually all languages have some form of genitive construction.  I'm tempted to say all, but there is undoubtedly some language in Papua New Guinea with 300 speakers and no genitive construction.    This particular usage is referred to as a superlative genitive and the idea behind it quite intuitive.  You have, for example, the Song of Songs (i.e. THE song of ALL songs, therefore the best song).  Most Semitic languages haves several different ways of expression comparison and superlatives.  Hebrew, unlike English (and Arabic) has no way of changing the adjective to mark comparative and superlative (e.g. great-> greater-> greatest) and so uses other words and constructs like this one to indicate this.  Oddly, Arabic, a related language does have a comparative form (called by grammarians the elative).  It can mark both the comparative and the superlative depending on the syntax.  For example, in Arabic you would say (literally translated) ""This is best of the songs in the world,"" or ""This is best of song"" (it sounds really awkward in English).  See here for a very brief little write up on the superlative genitive in Hebrew: ""William's Hebrew Syntax""  Stealth edit: You see a lot in the Old Testament and it has carried over into English: Holy of Holies (the Holiest Place), King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Greatest King and Greatest Lord), God of Gods (Greatest God) etc."

The most problematic thing about reconstructing PIE is that it's quite implausible that all the phonological and morphological features variously ascribed to it existed at the same time and in a single particular dialect. There's an old saw in IE linguistics that what gets reconstructed as ""Proto-Indo-European"" is too kitchen sink-y and sometimes internally inconsistent to be an actual single lect. The lesson is that you need to be careful what you're referring to when you throw around a word like ""PIE.""  Even so, there are some long-held traditional aspects of reconstructed PIE that are controversial--like the status of voiced aspirated plosives; see glottalic theory on this. Linguists are somewhat variable with regard to how far they want to take ""phonolgoical realism"" in their reconstructions."

Tonality isn't different from aspiration, voicing, length, etc. - it's just a feature a language's phonological system can use to differentiate phonemes. There's no ""extra variable"", it's just a question of which ""variable[s]"" are worth paying attention to in a language."
linguistics,3dgsai,MalignantMouse,33,Thu Jul 16 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"Your perception of tone languages as being unnecessarily difficult is because of your background speaking a non-tone language. In reality, tones are just another kind of phonemic distinction, and a slight majority of the world's languages use tone to distinguish between different words.  Someone learning your language could just as easily say: ""To me it seems like voicing distinctions make a language much more difficult than it needs to be. They seem to just say the same words in different ways instead of using new ones.""  This is because it is hard to learn new contrasts, regardless of what they are. If you speak a non-tone language, tones can be hard to learn. If you speak a language without a voicing distinction, the voicing distinction can be hard to learn.   And, you might not consider voicing to be a ""real"" difference, just like you don't consider tones to be a ""real"" different. It's all a matter of perspective. In a language with lexical tone, bá (high tone) and bà (low tone) are just as different as ""pat"" (unvoiced) and ""bat"" (voiced) are in English. They're not the same word said different ways; they're different words.   English also distinguishes between words based on more than just the vowels and consonants. Consider ""object"" (noun) and ""object"" (verb). We have contrastive stress; where we place the emphasis can make the difference between words. In English, this is a fairly limited phenomenon and is often derivational (it turns a word of one type into another type), but if this difference makes sense to you, then it might help you understand tone languages a little better.  Or, for another example - just the other day a Spanish speaker asked this subreddit if speakers of American English really distinguish between /ɛ/ and /ɪ/, i.e. the difference between ""bed"" and ""bid."" In Spanish, these vowels are not distinguished and they can be very difficult to learn to perceive and produce. It seems like Americans are just saying the same word! But they really are different words."

Sarcasm was near impossible as they did not understand when I spoke in an inflected manner that I wasn't being serious.

It is also easy to fall prey to confirmation bias. For example, English speakers will often say that we use a rising intonation for questions, while not noticing that many questions do not have that rising intonation. Compare the intonation for a neutral reading of:   You went to the store? Why did you go to the store?   However, (some kind of) rising tone for (some) questions is a common feature across languages. One potential functional explanation for this is that it is an obvious contrast to a falling intonation. A falling intonation is, phonetically, ""more natural""1 - a lower differential between supraglottal and subglottal pressure leads to lower pitch. This lower pitch becomes grammaticalized as the statement contour.   Many languages do not have this rising tone for questions, though, as has already been mentioned.  1 quotes because I don't want to open this can of worms"

Now, I don't know if that is actually true, and I don't know about the exact vowel inventories of these Judeo-Romance languages, but I think having a Romance substrate would in general be a pretty good basis for abolishing vowel length distinction and front rounded vowels, and possibly even mid-height distinction (although I think plenty of Romance varieties did not merge these?). Just my two cents as somebody who doesn't really know much about Yiddish.  EDIT: Yes, it's a wiki link, and no, I'm not an expert on Yiddish, but the article cites this book for the Judeo-Romance claim, so I'd say it's an educated guess at least.  EDIT 2: Another possibility is that the functional load of an earlier length distinction was shifted to a primary distinction ""tense"" and ""lax"" vowels (e.g. /i/ and /ɪ/) in the German varieties that Yiddish was based on. I would still expect the same result from Romance speakers (oh god the generalising), i.e. merging the pairs."

Also as he said, there are big revitalisation efforts happening. it's too soon to tell, but I would not be surprised if the decline slowed or reversed in the next 20 years, but it's too soon to tell.  There's a lot of talk of inevitability in this area. That's good if you're trying to motivate people to do something about it, and I also agree that, if we stay on the path we've been on it may be true, but things are changing. We just won't know how they're really changing overall until it's already happened.  Anyway, the best numbers you're going to get are from the government. That's where the people writing your cited papers are generally getting their data.   The most comprehensive paper (Sandel et al 2006 ) says that the language shift is still happening, though. And yet it's been 9 years, so I'm not sure what the deal is now.   It takes more than 9 years. It might only decline about 5% in a generation, give or take based on a large number of variables. It can go much quicker if there's some intervening government policy or another significant motivating factor to choose one way or another, but generally, all else being equal, 9 years isn't really enough to see a big difference."

linguistics,3d4qo2,elsani,13,Mon Jul 13 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"When I asked my cousins living in Taiwan about Taiwanese Hokkien, they described that Hokkien was dying out.   A reasonable statement to make...   When Mandarin became a national language, all the younger generations learned Mandarin.   ... and this is also true, but it happened before your cousins generation, but not learning Min/Hoklo/Hokkien isn't quite directly tied to Mandarin becoming official. Your youngest cousin could just not be interested, simple as that. Mandarin became official in the 1940s, and before that Hokkien was still outlawed in a later stage of Japanese language policy in Occupied Taiwan.   From my observations, Hokkien is only spoken with very old generations now and some relatives to keep in communication with them.   This really varies from place to place. Further south you'll hear it a lot. Tainan has no shortage of young people that speak perfect Hokkien. In Taipei, even among people who are not 外省人 (those whose families came over in the 40s), the picture is a little different.  tl;dr: Yes Hokkien is on the decline, but not to the same extent everywhere in Taiwan.  Now more information for those interested:   I work in Language Planning & Policy as well as minority language rights & preservation, specifically in Taiwan and China. I give talks on this sort of thing somewhat regularly, and recently gave one on the successes of various Mandarin promotion efforts by the governments of Taiwan, China and Singapore.  Taiwan is an interesting case because it has neither the small size nor mix of people of Singapore, nor does it (presently) have the authoritarianism of China and Singapore. Singapore in particular has been incredibly successful since 1979 when they started their own efforts to get ethnic Chinese to speak Mandarin. China's had a little more difficulty just because of their size, but that's been changing lately, especially among the 90後 generation of which you're a part.   Back to Taiwan: Not long ago, use of languages like Hakka, Hokkien/Hoklo and the indigenous aboriginal languages was not allowed. Until 1987 you would be punished for using these languages in public. They couldn't be broadcast on tv or radio until 1993.  There have been lots of reasons to think that Taiwanese was on the way out in the past 50 years. Even ignoring the prohibition of its use during the Japanese Occupation period.  What's been interesting is that that is not happening on the scale that it's happening in places like China where oppressive policies and general disinterest in ""heritage"" languages among speakers is leading to a much greater increase of largely monolingual Mandarin speakers. Meanwhile in Taiwan (as /u/Invisible_girlfriend pointed to) the decrease is a little less striking, at least once you get away from Taipei. In that chart they linked, you can see there's actually an increase in Southern Min speakers for people aged 25-44, in large part the result of a shift away from the ""Mandarin Only"" policies of Taiwan in the latter third of the century.  It is still decreasing. The numbers are still going down. Mandarin is still the prestige language, and the language of trade with the mainland, and the language of education, the military and so on. In fact the military has always been a major point of Mandarin promotion since the 1940s since Mandarin is the only language to be used. Early on it was the mandatory military service that first pushed Mandarin into such widespread use. Even for some Hokkien speakers, Mandarin still ends up being a common language, since the Hokkien varieties still vary somewhat considerably from place to place.  So what's happening today then. That chart is from 99年 and we're now in 104年. The non-Mandarin (usually called ""Indigenous"") languages have gotten a boost from the Ministry of education, and also taken a hit from the Ministry of Education. Like all government ministries, Taiwan's MOE is not of one opinion all the time. Funding gets cut for indigenous language education, and then the same year they make the languages compulsory for school children.  Hakka is doing somewhat well, and a lot of Hakka are teaching their children the language and sending them to Hakka classes at a young age. Annual culture festivals and regular speech competitions for all ages, as well as a close-knit community, is keeping the language pretty stable. Hokkien isn't quite there, but then it's also a much larger percentage of the country so there's less pressure to do these sorts of things. Language communities don't much care about preserving their language when they don't have a sense that it's somehow endangered.  The really interesting question is what's going to happen down the road. If Taiwanese identity keeps increasing among the Taiwanese the way that is has, and if someone like Tsai Ing-wen gets elected, we might see greater protectionism toward the language as a facet of cultural heritage. I don't think we'll see the Legislative Yuan switch away from Mandarin, but, with a less China-focused government and a Ministry of Education that reflected that, we might not have to wait for Hokkien to become endangered before steps are taken to strengthen its position. This is all just hypothetical, and who knows what's really going to happen, but it wouldn't be impossible to see a shift in Hokkien's favour in the near future.  One can dream, anyway.  edit: I replied to your comment think it was the original post, because my mobile app didn't make it clear that that was happening. Sorry. I'm just going to leave it up though."

The article I posted states that it seems that they're teaching dialects to connect with the older generations.   Interestingly enough, the new movement now is encouraging learning and speaking those dialects due to the awareness of local culture. Schools have programs to teach these languages for the younger generation and a great effort is being undertaken from the media to produce channels and programs to promote all these dialects.    Edit: After further contemplation, it seems I have made a mistake. 4 out of the 5 speak Taiwanese.

Northern areas (e.g.: Taipei, Taoyuan, etc.) are where most of the former-mainlanders (who came with the KMT in the late 40s) settled. These people spoke Mandarin, thus their offspring speak Mandarin. I had a summer scholarship at a university in Pingtung and spent some time in Kaohsiung and Tainan, too, and the people there all spoke Taiwanese or Hakka to each other, though nearly everyone could speak (accented) Mandarin. These southern areas didn't get as many civil war refugees, so the average southerner's ancestors have lived on Taiwan for centuries. Somewhat related, this difference in heritage shows up in politics, as well: up north, the KMT is the dominant party; down south, the DPP is king. The KMT favors closer ties with the mainland, since this was actually the ruling government on the mainland before the communists won the civil war. The DPP, made of the more-historical population (dominant in the south), has been there for centuries, so they don't give a damn about the mainland."

However, there are far more jobs in the cities so the population shift necessarily must contribute to the language shift.   I only have anecdotal evidence of this as a Mandarin speaker raised in Taiwan myself, and while I was in my undergraduate studies I looked into this language shift and found not many people are doing research on this, at least at the time.

Anyway, I visited Taipei a few years ago and could barely understand anything people or announcements said in Hokkien, although I consider my listening comprehension of Medan Hokkien to be perfectly acceptable. This could be due to some bias since my parents aren't about to, say, announce the next station on the subway. Singaporean Hokkien is much more understandable to me but is still not really that easy to understand. I guess what I'm trying to say is that since the language is so fragmented, no 2 communities of Hokkien speakers really communicate with each other in any form, so there isn't a large corpus of media or a large population to speak with to sustain the language in the same way as, say, Cantonese."

It can be a real hassle if you're trying to get around in the language and you know you should be able to tell what's going on, but then the word just isn't right.

A smaller but still very significant percentage use Hakka, mainly around Hsinchu/Miaoli but there are some pockets in Taoyuan, Taichung, and Pingtung.

Toward Taichung you get 大埔 which is mostly isolated to that area, and Yunlin County has 詔安. Hualien is 海陸 and Pintung is 四縣 with some spillover north into Kaohsiung County.  The Hakka moved around a lot, replacing Aboriginal populations that were moved out by the Japanese or otherwise. Places like Neiwan, for example, which were not traditionally Hakka settlements are now quite distinctly Hakka.

Quite a number of Taiwanese singers continue to sing in Hokkien and I think the reason is mainly to preserve the language.  On another note, maybe my experience with Shanghainese is relevant. My parents are fluent in Mandarin and Shanghainese, but I grew up learning Mandarin in Saturday Chinese School, mainly because my parents considered it more useful. The thing is, I don't speak any Shanghainese. I've only picked up some from being around my parents so long. Obviously my experience isn't the same since I grew up in the United States, not China, but I think there's a similarity in that people feel sad that their dialects are dying out.

The abstract:   The mathematical model for language competition developed by Abrams and Strogatz allows the evolution of the numbers of monolingual speakers of two competing languages to be estimated. In this paper, we extend the model to examine the role of bilingualism and social structure, neither of which are addressed in the previous model. We consider the impact of two strategies for language maintenance: (1) adjusting the status of the endangered language; and (2) adjusting the availability of monolingual and bilingual educational resources. The model allows us to predict for which scenarios of intervention language maintenance is more likely to be achieved. Qualitative analysis of the model indicates a set of intervention strategies by which the likelihood of successful maintenance is expected to increase."

[ɵ] occurs allophonically (edit: maybe it could be considered phonemic because all cases of the diphthong are fronted?) in my dialect, and I believe yours as well (I think you speak a variation of Midland American English). The diphthong broadly transcribed as /oʊ/ is fronted in North Midland American English to [ɵʊ̯]. You can probably tell whether you use [oʊ̯] or [ɵʊ̯] because the former starts in the back of your mouth and the latter starts in the center.  The difference between [ʊ] and [ɵ] is that the former is higher and backer, while the latter is almost just a rounded schwa, though possibly a bit higher (its cardinal position is higher than the schwa, but I think that symbol often denotes a rounded central vowel)."

Certain parts of names might be common within a generation, or certain themes related to political goings-on (e.g. names like ""Founding-of-the-Nation"" as a given name, basically nonexistent outside of those born in the late 40s), but more generally in the country/language area names just don't repeat as often.

You do see this with, for example, typically ""African American"" names, and to some extent you see it among White Americans in the sense that most Americans are likely naming their kids not for what the name means, but for how it sounds. Granted they might not be just making things up completely, but that's how you get people with names like Madison in the generation before Madison became an incredibly popular girls name.

The patriotic names (e.g. 建國 jianguo or 紅旗 hongqi) were in large part a way of showing the government how patriotic you were to name your kid that at a time when it might have mattered, or just because you're actually that patriotic. Other than that, they tend to just be poetically nice names. There are certain constants, and some names are clearly girls names while others are clearly boys names, but other than trends changing from generation to generation, they're not actually that tied to events.

I also took  a few advanced seminars, these were mostly about cognitive linguistics and pragmatics since that's the ""specialty"" of almost all of the lecturers here.  Since I really only took seminars about cogling, the only thing I learned about generative grammar/UG was, at least in my opinion, a skewed view of the whole subject. It seemed like a slightly mad theory at the time, but seeing as a lot of people (not only Chomsky) did work in that field I wanted to know whether it is as mad as it seemed or if it is equally valid (which is my guess).  I scoured a few threads about generative grammar and the criticism some people have voiced and found a few pointers, namely Poverty of the stimulus: Revisited and Government and Binding Theory. I have started reading the former and came across some things I really don't get.

linguistics,3d4f52,Choosing_is_a_sin,2,Tue Jul 14 05:36:53 2015 UTC,"That sounds right. I looked through all my history of French books, and most of them don't even mention it. The one that does (Peter Rickard's A History of the French Language, 2nd Edition) mentions that just before the Revolution, a quarter of Parisians used it, and Paris was (and is) quite close to the then-capital Versailles.  This site gives a reference that I checked independently that says the uvular trill (a transition consonant from apical trill to uvular fricative, now merely a less common variant of the same phoneme) was used in the court by 1689, in other words, a century before the Revolution. It doesn't speak strictly to an origin at the court, but rather to no known precursor before the court (though it could have been an innovation from the Paris region that found favor at the court). I'm not sure what you mean by 'Gallic', so I'm going to assume you mean Gaulish and you'll correct me if my assumption is wrong. Aller is straightforwardly derived from Latin ambŭlare 'walk, go', in the same type of paradigm fusion that melded go and wend in English, in this case fusing ambŭlare and ire. Liaison is a product of the progressive loss of final consonants long after any contact with Celtic languages. Most word-final consonants were lost, but since resyllabification was the norm, the /z/ in words like les did not end up being word-final, but word-initial, since the relevant type of word that we look at is the prosodic word. So certain consonants, due to their frequent resyllabification, ended up surviving in those limited contexts. The end result of this was a syntactically-governed phonological phenomenon, known as liaison.    Celtic influence on French is not known to be great. If you look at the Peter Rickard book that I mentioned above, the first few pages deal with Gaulish influence-- the book preview cuts out just as he stops talking about Gaulish. One might find some local features of Brittany French that also bear influence from Breton, but I don't know of any studies on it."

I know the coal mines of Aoji in North Korea derives its name from the Manchu word(s) for the coals.   Manchu has a lot of words for stones. That's not an Eskimo/snow thing.

Why did Chinese toponyms stick in Korea?   I don't have a specific answer w/o doing some research, but things fall into fashion, and sometimes fall out, but without a strong motivation for the change, they can get stuck. It's hard to change placenames, and even if it's done officially, people can resist for a couple generations. Seoul still has plenty of remnants of it's old names (Hanyang University, for example) or references to them (Wangshimni, one station over from the uni, which references the founding myth of the city, then called Hanyang). ""Wangshimni"" is absolutely a Chinese phrase (往十里).  There may be an interesting story behind Daejeon's name, which itself would be worth looking into. Your Korean is undoubtedly better than mine though so you might find an answer quicker than I can.   Is Waxiang a descendant of Old Chinese   We don't actually know. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences does include it in their maps, and we include it on Phonemica as Sinitic, but the jury is still out. It may be a creole, or just a small isolate that's fundamentally still Sinitic. Why it's not on the maps is because it's absolutely tiny, and most Chinese probably haven't ever heard of it.   is Manchu salvageable or is the language doomed beyond a doubt?   It still exists as Xibe/Sibe, spoken in Xinjiang by Manchus that left Manchuria. I know a few people who do work on Manchu, either translation or scholarship. I actually wrote one of my term papers in my first grad program about Manchu translations of Chinese classics. but other than Sibe, it's probably not salvageable. People take classes in Manchuria, but they're not huge or too popular, and what comes out of it isn't going to single handedly bring the language back.   How much of an influence does Mandarin have on Tibetan, Uyghur, or Laimongu Mongolian? Is there a marked difference between Chinese and Mongolian Mongolian?   Oh man a lot. I mean Laimongu is Mandarin but maybe you did that on purpose. But yeah a lot. Common words are often used from Mandarin in the Uyghur of Ürümchi or in various Tibetan dialects. The words for things like phones, currency, common goods words and the like. My colleague is a Tibetan linguist working on his own language sub-group and he's constantly pointing out words that are Mandarin derived, and any intro to Uyghur text book is going to have a lot of obvious ones too.  I don't actually know much about Mongolia Mongolian, but if it's anything like Tibetan or Uyghur, you can be certain there's a stark contrast once you hit the border."

Moe 뫼 is completely gone, even as a generic word for ""mountain"" independent of toponyms. It's curious, because as late as the 19th or early 20th century many rural toponyms were still native (Hanbat instead of 大田, Byeolteo instead of 星峴, Soseom instead of 牛島) while today (besides some touristy areas) all toponyms are Hanja.

It tends to get discussed as Sinitic, but we don't actually know, and some people, e.g. Cuī Róngchāng*, make the argument based on syntactical structure that it's definitely not Sinitic, but rather something related to Ngwi (aka Lolosih). There are other similarly syntactical arguments for it being Sinitic based on extant poetry by Chinese authors using Bashu in their poems.  I personally don't think the arguments are terribly strong on either side, but being in lieu of much evidence to support the Ngwi connection, I don't see a particularly strong reason to think it isn't Sinitic. But I've also not spent nearly as much time reading the literature on this as I have other subjects, and maybe if I had a week to spare to actually track down all the scholarship it might change my view.  For Jiangdong there's also not much scholarship but what there is is looking at records from around the Jin period and working out the sound categories. A scholar by the name of Xiè Róng'é has done some work on this. Things like substrata are also used to assess this sort of thing but that's also potentially problematic as it's often hard to verify that the substratum you think exists really exists.    * in 《巴蜀语言的分化、融合与发展》"

ISO standards cause a lot of trouble that I think many people are unaware of. Moving outside linguistics for a second: As someone currently with residency in Taiwan I find it to be utter bullshit that ISO codes for country names are based on UN status rather than on political realities, and as such, my country of legal residence simply doesn't exist in many systems. So that should give you further insight into how I feel about ISO codes being the standard for so many things in the world today.  Or I can take the point of view of a software developer working with language-related applications (which I also am) and totally understand the value of ISO codes (well, of having some sort of standard, be it ISO or otherwise, for getting things like a text messaging app in ones native language into the hands of the masses. You've got to have some kind of a standard abstraction if you want things like rigid computer systems to support these things at all. We need something. Is ISO in it's current implementation the answer? I'm less certain.  Wikipedia needing an ISO code before having the site in a language, well if you look at Wikipedia for Wu Chinese (ranked 168th despite having ~90 million speakers), it's crap. There's nothing there. So I guess my feeling is, unless there are more people willing to write articles in  languages with millions of speakers, maybe needing ISO codes isn't Wikipedias biggest issue regarding less common languages.  Note that Tosk Albanian has a code gsw when Albanian has sq, nevermind that Tosk is the standard, and Gheg, the other major dialect group, has no ISO code.

So then you can look and see whether the noun occasions any of the changes that take place in the plural, such as liaison, the alternation between word-final /al/ and /o/, or the conjugation of the simple future tense (parlera vs parleront).

The same sound might be transcribed /s̪/ by one person and /θ/. Theoretically they're different, but in practice it's not always the case. There's some debate about if /ɲ/ is the same thing as /ȵ/ in certain case, and anyway why have <ȵ> when it could also be written <n̠ʲ>? The answer to the last one is because holy cow n̠ʲ is a hassle to write and read.  The deal with /ɕ/ vs /ʃʲ/ is that you're going to be seeing it based on differences in the phonology of the language. You have a language like Mandarin where /ɕ/ is phonemic and /ʃ/ is not. You have English where /ʃ/ is phonemic but /ɕ/ is not. If English /ʃ/ were in a position to undergo palatalisation, you'd likely be writing it with <ʃʲ> especially in a phonemically-oriented transcription. You'd never write <ʃʲ> in transcribing Mandarin dialects.   Are [ɕ] vs [ʃʲ] pronounced exactly the same? It's gonna depend on who you ask. If you speak a language that doesn't distinguish between /ʃ/ and /ɕ/, you'll probably think so.  Remember that IPA is not actually transcribing exactly what's going on. IPA is a shorthand. It's an abstraction. Even the most rigorous transcription is going to be missing something, and since there's no exact value of ""ɕ"", it's all subject to the transcriber's interpretation anyway.  Assume it's all just convention and an attempt to get close to reality without actually being able to perfectly describe reality. Embrace it as an abstraction and you'll have a much easier time."

In the context of ""stress-free jobs""  The argument goes like this: By definition, the use of 'stress-free' in the above context is figurative, because there could be no such thing as 'stress-free jobs' as 'job' is defined.  A job is called a job because it requires work or effort. Or because it has certain duties or responsibilities, most commonly in exchange for compensation. All of which is physical or mental tension or pressure and is in other words stress.  But it can be literal because there can be jobs that require effort so low that the person  does not detect or experience any stress.

So I think ""age"" works better for the consonant sound, though ""idge"" works better for the vowel sound. The problem is that combining them into ""garige"" would make a word likely to be pronounced ""ga-ri-gey"" or ""ga-ree-geh"" or something similar. And garig is clearly two hard /g/ sounds to an English speaker... or at least to me.  edit: should've mentioned I originally wrote ""works perfectly"" but then edited it to say ""works well"".

linguistics,3d1bpp,gnorrn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"In fact, they did use a digraphic orthography prior to this reform.  First, a primitive orthography was used since the 11th century, where for writing sounds which are foreign to the Latin alphabet, letters with similar sounds were used:   i ſuiatemu ſcepanu ſe duema duſnicoma  [ɪ swi̯atɛːmu ʃt͡ʃɛpa:nu sɛ dwi̯ema duʃɲiːkoma]   Then in the 14th century a digraphic orthography was used:   i zzwiatemu ſſchzepanu se dwiema duſſnikoma   This orthography was very confusing because a single phoneme could be written with many different letters or digraphs and a single letter/digraph could present several phonemes, e.g. /tʃ/ could be written as ⟨cſ⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨cz⟩ or even ⟨ſſ⟩. OTOH digraph ⟨cz⟩ could represent both /tʃ/ and /ts/.  Therefore in the 15th century John Huss (or at least most probably it was him) introduced a new orthography, where he used acutes to mark vowel length and dots above consonants to mark their softness. The dot was later changed to caron for better readability.    i swiatému ṡċepánu se dwiema duṡníkoma   later:   i swiatému ščepánu se dwiema dušníkoma   in present day Czech:   a svatému Štěpánu se dvěma dušníkama   in English:   and to St. Stephen together with two church serfs   Source: The Capitulum of Litoměřice founding charter  This system was reformed several times since then but basically the principle is still the same today."

Since language is democratic, you can choose between the universally accepted standard that has been there for centuries, or the one some linguist came up with and that no one likes. It's not a hard choice.  There have been exceptions, of course; Spanish has had some strong issues with its Academy because they started to make descriptivist reforms (removing disambiguation marks and stuff), so they were forced to take it back to how it was. But it requires a strong majority of people disagreeing; say, every important author or every school teacher. Some other instituitions like the Dictionary of Spanish of Mexico have appeared, but they pretty much say ""do what the Academy says except with this list of words"". Currently Spanish has been undergoing some controversy with hispanification of English terms like Googling or hashtag, so time will tell of the Academy system stays or if it's replaced by a descriptivist one.

linguistics,3d1bpp,pixelypunto,5,Mon Jul 13 04:42:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really know much about French, but I know about Spanish, and both Academies work on more or less the same principles, so that could help. The Royal Spanish Academy, or RAE in Spanish, publishes its own dictionary, the DRAE. This dictionary is held my many as the ultimate ruling on Spanish; it's like the constitution of language. There are other dictionaries, like the Larousse or the Dictionary of Mexican Spanish (DEM), but centuries of tradition make the DRAE the most respected dictionary. Whenever a new edition comes out, the main literary and linguistic magazines publish all the major reforms, and the publishing houses that sell the DRAE in all of the world start producing the revised edition.   I'm genuinely curious because as was pointed out in a higher post part of the change in English pronunciation has come with its globalization. Garage is pronounced differently in England than in America. The same differences in pronunciation or word choice is seen in Spanish and French among their ex-colonies. So are the Academies only regulating written language?   This is the main problem with linguistic prescriptivism. Spaniards, and particularly the RAE members, believe their Spanish to be the One True Spanish, sort of how in the 50s received pronunciation was supposed to be the norm in English (when it comes to which dialect of Spaniard Spanish is correct there's a never-ending battle between the major cities, but that's a tale for another day). If you go to Spain and tell the average Juan that you learnt Spanish in LatAm, there's like a 90% chance they'll treat you like your Spanish is inferior and brute. In the best of cases they'll try to re.educate you, but sometimes, especially if you're Latino, they'll just look at you like you'd look at Forrest Gump in a physics trivia contest. I've heard the same is true about Parisians and French, but that I can't testify. The point is, the RAE's guides for pronunciation and word choice are tipped towards the Spaniard side of the scale, and when words come out of LatAm they tend to be dubbed ""barbarisms"". That's one of the main reasons the RAE has started to lose its credibility and why Spanish is turning more and more descriptivist with time."

I can see some issues of amateurism in it already, e.g.   edition noun an issue of a newspaper  “ They read it in yesterday's edition of the newspaper.Times”  So this person has changed the example sentence to include part of the definition, so if the example sentence has to make the ""of the newspaper"" explicit, why include ""of a newspaper"" in the definition at all? This should prompt reflection about the nature of the definition. Is it really something that applies just to newspapers? or to a larger class, such as periodicals? But do people even use the word periodical in their everyday language, or do we expect them to look it up? Should readers have to look up the main word in any definition, or should it be aimed for a low-proficiency readership and use only simple, plain English in its definitions?  These are the kinds of editorial questions that those greedy corporations who think they ""own the language"" when they have the gall to copyright the fruits of their labor have to decide on when producing a dictionary. Perhaps you can tell that I think Wordset's potshot at professional lexicographers is unwarranted, and reflects either an ignorance or indifference to the pervasive role of plagiarism in the history of English-language lexicography. I think it also oversimplifies the work that lexicographers do in crafting definitions appropriate to their target audience. Indeed, it's the phrasing of the definitions and example sentences as well as the structure and presentation of entries that are in need of copyright protection. I can't imagine any lexicographer working for these dictionary companies actually thinking that they own meanings, or that they decide what is and isn't a word.   So, in place of any sort of editorial oversight and vision, Wordset proposes to let just anyone contribute, regardless of whether they favor a descriptive or prescriptive approach and regardless of whether they have any understanding of lexicographic best practices. I can't find any sort of guidance on the site to help people either, or to lay out what sorts of definitions they favor. How are senses supposed to be ordered, particularly when the dictionary appears not to distinguish between polysemy and homography? Why, in the entry for minute, is the third sense ""distance measured by the time taken to cover it"" and the eighth sense ""a unit of time equal to 60 seconds or 1/60th of an hour""? What was the principle that led them to such an ordering, and how will they ensure that future entries will follow the same principle?  I am very much in favor of letting people contribute to an open-source project. It can result in great things, like Wikipedia. But Wikipedia offers guidance to its editors in order to maintain a certain style, which in turn helps users to navigate and understand the entries. This just seems like a poorly thought out attempt to do something great by being ever-so-slightly more rigorous than Urban Dictionary, that is, by imposing a low bar.  P.S.

It was my intention to quickly go and build a searchable Wiktionary app while I worked there. However, it turns out that that's nearly impossible to pull off.  Wiktionary is written by skilled, contentious, and thorough editors.  The software that runs behind Wiktionary is absolutely ill-fitted to the task. Mediawiki is basically a big text pad that you can edit. And, while it's possible to write anything, it's unstructured in it's nature. It's impossible to search, sort, or analyze.

I can take the blame for the sentence of 'edition' as I replaced Times with the newspaper.  I was attempting to remove a proper noun that implied a bunch of contextual knowledge with a more generic phrase.  It seems like the definition is lacking but I was focused on the sentence, when it appears I need put more effort into considering both.  I've personally considered recommending multiple (proficiency-level based) sentences, but haven't been able (in my very brief ) research to determine where those level are determined. I will probably have to collate some state vocab lists but haven't figured out a concrete plan as yet.    I think that lexicographers are doing good work that deserves protection (and am vehemently against plagiarising such), but I would personally like a version that is more free (copyright-wise).    I think that stupid article that comes around every year about which words were 'added' to the dictionary would make it seem to the general public that such companies are actually deciding which are and aren't words.   The original source for these definitions and examples was wordnet, so while those may not be the best basis, one has to start somewhere. The definitions, their ordering and the example sentences are all open to improvement.  Not to be a dunce, but what principle(s) normally order senses? My untrained eye has never noticed anything more complicated than frequencey, though maybe I need better dictionaries!  Thanks again."
linguistics,3d2i6c,Choosing_is_a_sin,2,Mon Jul 13 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"Well, the Times is a common name for important newspapers on either side of the Atlantic, and they are quoted in lots of English-language newspapers even outside their home countries, so I wouldn't worry about that too much.  As far as wanting something open, that's all well and good, but I'm not exactly sure what you think will be the result without guidance. Unless that changes, I'm skeptical of the quality that will emerge.  Yes, adding words to dictionaries is considered a big deal, and yes, the public does get the wrong idea at times, but the manifesto on the front page very clearly takes aim at the publishers and not the public. I found it gratuitous and somewhat hurtful.  And it's fine that Wordnet started the project off with the seeds, but then where's the information about how future entries, these things that everyone's going to be writing, are supposed to be structured in order to match the example of Wordnet's definitions?  As far as sense ordering goes, one can order them on frequency, on centrality, on affinity, or on history. Frequency is fairly straightforward. Centrality means you start with the most basic, concrete meanings and move toward less common or more metaphorical meanings. Affinity is grouping related senses together, unlike, say, the entry for caper having its related noun and verb separated by a wholly unrelated sense. And history is ordering the senses in order of when they were first attested in the historical record. This doesn't even bring up the matter of homonymy vs. polysemy, which this dictionary doesn't seem to bother distinguishing. With no pronunciations, there's no indication that minute is actually a different lexeme when it's an adjective versus when it's a noun.

Of course it is always important to weigh your options, and research the school at which you will attend. However, I will say that I did my UG - Bachelor of Arts in Applied Linguistics at a regionally accredited (although, for-profit school), and it did not prevent me from entering grad school - 3.45 GPA (semantic-pragmatic overlap writing sample, 3 page statement of purpose, no references).   Some individuals would have you believe that an online degree is less valuable. While some employers and possibly school recruiters may still be of this mind, the pendulum is certainly swinging in the other direction; in the sense that it will become more acceptable in the future.  Make sure your school is regionally accredited (traditional/theoretical based), not nationally accredited (career/trade based).

Really from the information I've gathered there's a lot of ways to start in translation as long as you know more than one language. Problem is that if you want to have a higher chance of finding work and having higher rates it obviously helps to have a degree on your resume. I've already started getting some small jobs here and there, but if I want to have an easier time finding work and charge more for my services I need a degree. Linguistics seems like a good choice to start as it's basically about how languages work.

The commonalities in poetry performances is only an interesting quirk if those commonalities are specific to that format; if they're just facts about English (I assume you're only dealing with English, which is another factor), then they're not facts about poetry or performance at all. Also, if you want to claim that these commonalities, if they are indeed specific to this sort of poetry performance, are the result of influence from the academy, then you might also try to back that analysis up: look for that style in academic lectures, for instance, as evidence that that's the source of this style."

Also comparing natural speech to reading aloud is interesting, but probably not going to show you what you're looking for. This is in part because we don't have the same restraints of grammaticality when we produce natural speech as we impose upon the written language, so you'll have big structural differences.

linguistics,3crkll,folran,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:06:41 2015 UTC,"Well, ""borrowed into"" is probably a poor choice of words in this regard. And I also understand the explanation, so thanks.   So, what you are saying is that early borrowings changed the Latin -a and -ia to -en or just -n due to regular sound change? This probably applies to Preußen, Bayern, Polen, Ungarn, Kärnten; and perhaps some places like Spanien, Italien, Kroatien, Syrien. But then that later borrowings like (I'd imagine) Rumänien, Slowenien, Algerien, Australien, etc., which had to have come in centuries after this change took place, must have been formed on analogy with the older ones, right?  I thought about words like Forum/Foren just getting the default plural, sort of like how English uses forums, but if you notice, English doesn't parse the singular word as consisting of two separate morphemes, and German does (i.e. it's not ""Forumen"", but recognized as ""For- + -um""). Yet with other ""Fremdwörter"" like ""Fokus"", they just pluralize it as ""Fokusse"", which doesn't parse out the -us ending."
linguistics,3crkll,Brotten,2,Fri Jul 10 22:22:00 2015 UTC,"The term you're looking for is 'loanwords'. How the names of peoples came to be is more a question for a historian than for linguists. My gut feeling is that -ia is unlikely to turn into a form without an /i/, since it'd be a random deviations from the pattern - which is not impossible. Latin Prussia cannot become German Preußen, the name goes back to some Prussian or Polish word like *pruci or *prusi or the like. Bayern is fully Germanic and a regular development from original *bajowari as well. They were a Germanic tribe and did not randomly adapt the Latin name for themselves. I've no idea about the rest. Lastly, the words Fokus and Status are noteworthy for keeping their ending in the first place. More naturalised loans like Frucht , Vulkan and Kampf just drop the ending completely."
linguistics,3crkll,Brotten,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"At least Frucht and Kampf were borrowed at a much earlier date, and are barely perceived as ""foreign"", though. The English versions fruit and camp don't have an ending, either (volcano ceomes from Italian, but we also don't have the -us in the name of the god Vulcan). Fokus, Status, and others like it would have been learned borrowings from the early modern period, like they are in English.  You're probably right about the names in and around Germany itself, though in some cases, the German name is certainly derived from the Latin (Pfalz, for instance). And you're probably also right that the -a > -en thing doesn't happen without the i.   Still, the names of the other countries listed would have come into the language long after West Germanic had split up into separate groups – the early Middle Ages at the earliest. Names like Romania, Slovenia, Algeria would have just not been around until well after that time, right? So would the -en in this case simply be by analogy to the more ancient place names?"
linguistics,3crkll,Brotten,2,Sat Jul 11 06:58:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're not perceived has foreign, hence they are 'naturalised'. The situation for English fruit/camp is different, as those are French loans, not Latin. For Romania etc. I'm not sure what you mean by 'the -en in this case'. All these countries have -ien in German. Rumänien, Slowenien, Algerien. As said, weak nouns ending in -ə were smoothened to always end in -ən, no matter which vowels or consonant before that."

A grammar of constructions still needs some sort of mechanism to combine and embed constructions into each others, which ends up looking very much like a generalized phrase structure grammar. And no one denies that some things do need to be handled by constructions when their meaning is really non-compositional.  The big problem to me is that I feel that construction grammar is on the losing side of literally the oldest argument in linguistics: the analogist-anomalist debate of classical antiquity.

Take for instance little v. What does it do? For starters it introduces a new argument (usually the agent) to a verb, and I would say that little v by introducing the agent  also introduces the element of agency to the meaning of the verb (so I would argue that ""the vase broke"" doesn't have a little v (or perhaps a different little v) and therefore the verb has no agent, where as ""the vase was broken"" in its passive sense has a little v and therefore has an agent, even though it is not expressed). Why do we have a head called a little v in Minimalism? Well that is because we believe that all phrases are headed so we must assume a little v head if we assume a little v phrase. But what if we let go of this assumption? (and I have seen David Adger argue for this) Then we could have a vP consisting of an agent DP and a VP, and this vP has a particular meaning (of introducing agency).

This is the difference between 'mann' and 'menn', from earlier *mann- pl. *manniz.  If the plural were due to ablaut, the singular would be o-grade, and the plural would be e-grade, and this would have given Old English '**minn', not 'menn', because of the nasal followed by another consonant.

There's an important distinction to be made with having a lexeme in use and having all paradigmatic forms of the lexeme maintain continuous distribution in the same uses. While many speakers prefer brothers now over brethren in contexts where they want to talk about more than one male sibling, brethren's use is maintained in high registers of English when referring to segments of mankind or segments of religious orders. A statistical analysis of English corpuses might even show that brethren is more commonly used than oxen, especially considering the urbanization of most English speakers since the last century.   And as for why oxen specifically, I'd say why not? There is no reason. Attrition in the lexicon is a normal byproduct of grammaticalization of new productive morphology.

I'll reproduce my original comment below.    One note of caution is that the researchers may simply be backing winners, as sensory metaphors that were true failures would be unknown, and wouldn’t make it into their set of stimuli. To address this, the next study included each and every sensory metaphor found in the corpus of Jane Austin – 226 in all – including such gems as ""clamorous happiness"" and ""delicious harmony"", to see what characterised the phrases that succeeded versus those that did not. One hundred and thirty-five students studied, rated and recalled these metaphors, and those that enjoyed a rise to popularity in the Google dataset were, again, those rated higher in sensory quality and associations, and more easily recalled by participants.   Wait, so both studies just found that more frequent phrases are remembered better? We've known this for decades. They need to match the sensory and non-sensory phrases for both unigram and bigram frequency before they can come to the conclusion that the sensory aspect is driving the memory recall. If this is an accurate representation of their methods, then this is an incredibly shitty control experiment.  The question they seem to be interested in here is why sensory metaphors have become so frequent, and looking at how people remember frequent phrases as compared to infrequent phrases won't help with this.  I wish I could find the paper to see what their methods were. Google Scholar'ing the title & journal didn't bring up anything, which probably means it hasn't passed peer review. It's also unclear why this is in a social psych journal, somewhere where referees are unlikely to have significant background in psycholinguistics (which is exactly what this study needs)."
linguistics,3co4g4,el_gringo_exotico,5,Thu Jul 9 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"First off, speech acts aren't unique to English: all language users act while speaking, as speaking is an act. We speak with intent (so that intent is meaningful) and our speaking has effects on those who hear it (so those effects are meaningful).  So if you're introducing ideas about speech acts (though I'm not sure how this comes up in an ESL/TOEFL class), perhaps the best thing to do would be to introduce the concept (and some examples) in a more familiar language first, and then move to English examples later.  As far as introducing them goes, I wouldn't go right for performatives, even though they're neat; I'd start by just brainstorming with the class on the question ""What can we do when we speak?"" The students should have enough priming to say things like: describe things, issue a command, make a request, ask a question, give advice, etc. (Fun possible answers that might lead to discussion include also: mislead people, frighten people, inspire people, etc. This latter category can also help you talk about perlocutionary force, if you're getting there. It's still not clear to me why your teaching speech act theory at all.) Then you can give examples of each of these things in the familiar language, then fill in any gaps they didn't mention (like performatives, which they probably won't come up with), and only at the end give English examples."

Speech act theory has had a seminal influence on ELT training and materials, and if you look at any coursebook from the past 10/15 years, you will see this in the 'language functions' parts of the syllabus. Indeed, the whole Common European Framework is explicitly based on what students 'can do' with the language. When we teach students conditional structures, we do so so that they can express regrets, or give advice etc. When we teach students modal verbs, we do so so that they can make polite requests, or talk about things that need to be done etc.  In other words, speech acts, or language functions, are part of the everyday practice of ELT.

When referring to an OS command, they generally include the asterisk as part of the name, for example *RUN, *CAT, *SPOOL etc., although only the part after the asterisk is the command itself.   ...   The MOS command line interpreter features a rather unusual idea: abbreviation of commands. To save typing a dot could be used after the first few characters, such as *L. for *LOAD and *SA. for *SAVE. *RUN was abbreviated to */ alone. *CAT, the command to catalogue (list) a cassette or disc, can be abbreviated right down to *.   source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_MOS"
linguistics,3ckaoi,logicalmaniak,3,Thu Jul 9 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, in this case, the full stop is the abbreviation. The star just tells Arthur/RISCOS a command is coming.  *FORMAT  (format a disk)   *DISK  (shift to drive)   *CAT (catalogue like DIR or ls)  And then you could abbreviate with a full stop. Eg.  *FO.   The CAT command was the one represented by total abbreviation, so it could be written *."

I speak French comfortably, but not fluently, and my husband doesn't speak French (or any language other than English) at all.  Several times during the trip I've commented on something (often an English word or phrase) I've heard---something on television, for example, or something someone said to us.   In each case my husband was right there next to me and he swears he didn't/couldn't hear it.  It's like he turns deaf when anything other than standard British or American English is spoken.  For example, there was a television news piece on these flying skateboard/hoverboard things and the journalist said, as clear as day, ""Marty McFly"".  Now, my husband loves ""Back to the Future.""  He knows all about Marty McFly.   Yet he swears he can't hear the journalist say ""Marty McFly"".  I wonder if his difficulty learning a second language is tied with his inability to keep his earns open, so to speak, when a non-English language is spoken?    For the record, I find myself listening even when I'm in a place where I can't speak/understand the language around me.  I can feel myself actively listening, trying to pick out things or discern patterns.  My husband, however, seems to do the opposite.  It's as if he reasons, ""This isn't English.

One of the first things I do when I start learning a language is to study its phonology and do a lot of listening just to get an ear for it. This approach melds an understanding of IPA with its practical use quite liminally I think :)  Take advantage of the pretty extensive IPA resources on Wikipedia! Although hearing a vowel in isolation can be very helpful, it can sometimes be difficult at first to differentiate between like sounds. One thing I particularly find helpful is going to the vowel page itself and scrolling down to see examples of its uses in other languages. More often than not, there will be sound clips of at least a few words. (And if you have no luck, you can always copy and paste a listed word into a search on Forvo.com for a sound clip!)  Finally, just have fun with it! Try sliding between the sounds that you do know, listen to how sounds change with a mere rounding of the lips, stuff like that. Vowels are very nuanced and often quite obscure, but that's what makes them so fun! There are likely infinite amounts of vowels hiding between each of those listed on the vowel chart so don't be too hard on yourself. It's a mere approximation but its still a super helpful and strong system!  You'll get it in time! :)"

As much as I love Cantonese, that notion is problematic and highly political.   Regarding regularity, if one language had a regular and systematic set of rules, but that set includes a lot more rules than a fairly irregular language, which one is more complex?

I can't seem to find the article at the moment, but I remember reading one along the following lines: What's interesting is that even in a highly regular language, like Turkish, children are able to acquire certain aspects of the language (like plurals, case markers, verb endings, etc. that are all completely regular) and use them faster and more correctly than children acquiring a language that doesn't display such high regularity in that area, but the Turkish children had problems in other areas (something with relative clauses maybe) that, say, an English child masters earlier. So, the prevailing evidence seems to suggest that children all over the world acquire their language at roughly the same speed and take the same amount of time to master their language.   So, really, to claim that one language is ""superior"" to another is downright ridiculous. All languages allow for the exchange of information in a way that is suitable for the community that uses it.

linguistics,3cfs9u,mailmanq,17,Wed Jul 8 00:19:30 2015 UTC,This was news to me too. Here's some info about Anglo-Saxon runes:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes  Pretty interesting.
linguistics,3cfs9u,BenevolentCitizen,5,Wed Jul 8 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"In theory, can it be adapted to suit modern English?"
linguistics,3cfs9u,Bugisman3,12,Wed Jul 8 12:52:49 2015 UTC,"I suppose anything can be adapted to modern English, but runes were not an alphabet. You'd have a lot of adapting to do, though I sure someone into ""Anglish"" has attempted it.  OP's statement that ""really old English wasn't even written in Latin script"" is highly misleading. There was very little writing in England before the introduction of Latin script, because Anglo-Saxon culture was primarily oral. There are zero texts that can be said to be ""written"" in runes. Runes appear as inscriptions on material objects (e.g. ""Breca made this sword"") and they appear alongside the Latin alphabet.   The futhorc, what is referred to as a runic alphabet, was fashioned after the Latin alphabet. Each rune refers to a single word: the rune ""æ"" is pronounced ""ash"" and means ""ash tree."" It was included in the Latin alphabet to express Old English sounds there were no equivalents for, in addition to other runes like ""eth,"" ""thorn,"" and ""wynn."" These runes could be used to refer to the sounds they made, so they could function like letters, but they also still stood for the ""words"" they referred to. he only complete version of anything looking like an alphabet is a seax (knife) dating from the 9th century, and writing in Latin had been completely dominant in England for about 300 years at that point - it was produced on the model of Latin script.  There are amazing examples of runic writing, produced on the model and alongside writing in the Latin alphabet, including the Franks Casket and the Ruthwell Cross. Both of these runic inscriptions blend ""Germanic"" cultural expressions with Roman and Christian stories.   Runes were often used in riddles and for wordplay. Anglo-Saxon readers seemed to have regarded them more as mysterious symbols than as proper letters, and you will often see them appear in Old English literature to create double meanings within the text. A great example of this is the author Cynewulf, the only named author of Old English poetry we know. He embedded his own name in his poems in the form of runes that have to be spoken aloud as words to fit the meter and meaning of his poems. The way runes appear in riddles indicates that they were only partially understood by most readers in our extant literature.  We can always speculate that a true runic alphabet would have existed, but there is simply no evidence that there was a runic alphabet before Latin script came along and provided a model for one. There simply was no emphasis on writing, as the culture of the time was so oral rather than textual. It is a mistake to regard the dominance of Latin script as a part of an overbearing Christian/foreign culture wiping away a runic/native alphabet - there wasn't one. This is why writing takes off in Norse, Old English, Old Saxon, etc. in Latin script with some runic additions, and that's why all of our texts in these ancient Germanic languages were written with Latin letters."
linguistics,3cfs9u,CorneliusNepos,2,Wed Jul 8 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry, still trying to get my head around runes. Were they more similar to Chinese characters in concept?"
linguistics,3cfs9u,Bugisman3,4,Wed Jul 8 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say they are similar, and the reason why is because runes were a part of a society and culture that was primarily oral.  By primarily oral, I mean that things that are transmitted in writing in a textual culture, like poetry, law, history, etc., were transmitted without writing and by recounting these ""texts"" orally. This was also the case in many other societies, like the Ancient Greece that the Homeric poems were composed in, for instance. You can read about this different way of creating, transmitting, and recounting these texts here. Chinese characters were a part of a very literate society and culture.  It's best to think less about what these runes were, than about how they were used. Thinking about what they were forces us to understand them in ways we have be conditioned to understand them through our hyperliterate culture. This was also the case in Anglo-Saxon England when the literary men who composed and copied literary texts used them in their poems. We tend to look back to Anglo-Saxon England and feel that they must have been closer to these runes, so they were entirely comfortable with them, but they weren't entirely. They understood them through the lens of the alphabet and the written word too. Of course they had a better sense of them than we do, but they still fit them into what they understood: books.   But runes weren't for books, they were for objects. They were inscribed on combs and swords, as well as staves and trees. In fact, one Old English word for letters is ""runstafas,"" literally ""rune-staves"" because there was a tradition of transmitting messages by carving a run on the end of a staff and sending a messenger with the staff to convey the message. We would expect an envoy to carry a written letter (which they often did after the introduction of books), but that's not what the ancient (even to the literate Anglo-Saxons) rune-staff was for. The rune-staff was carved merely to show the origin and so the authenticity of the message that would be conveyed orally by the messenger. The rune in this case isn't ""literary"" and doesn't function like a letter does. It is a symbol, but not exactly like what we conceive of as a letter.  This is very hard to convey, because we are talking about a very alien culture. We write all day every day, and that greatly affects our perception of the world. We tend to see things like runes then on the model of things we understand. And so did the literate Anglo-Saxon who made an alphabet out of runes in the 9th century.  If you want to read about orality, a fundamental book is Walter Ong's Orality and Literacy. It is older, so much has been refined, but it remains a brilliant and highly enjoyable book. I can't recommend it enough if you are interested in this topic. For a scholarly account of Old English runes, take a look at Raymond Page's An Introduction to English Runes."
linguistics,3cfs9u,CorneliusNepos,2,Wed Jul 8 20:32:23 2015 UTC,I suppose anything can be adapted to modern English   What about languages like Arabic that have sounds that are not in the English language? I understand it's difficult to romanize accurately.
linguistics,3cfs9u,releasethedogs,3,Fri Jul 10 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"The problem you'd run into with the Arabic alphabet (technically called an abjad) isn't the characters that represent sounds not in English; it's the sounds that English needs that Arabic doesn't represent.  The standard Arabic abjad doesn't have characters for sounds like /g/,  /p/, or /v/. Certain languages that have these sounds have adapted the Arabic abjad by using diacritics, in the same way many European languages use diacritics on Latin characters: for example, in the Persian alphabet, /g/ is represented by the /k/ character with a line over it, and /p/ is represented by the /b/ character with three dots under it (instead of the one dot under the /b/ character).  The problem you'd really run into, though, are vowels: the Arabic alphabet only contains characters for three vowels: long /a:/, long /i:/, and long /u:/. Short vowels (which are crucial for many morphological distinctions) are determined by context. The /i:/ character doubles as the /j/ glide, the /u:/ character doubles as the /w/ glide, and the /a:/ character doubles as glottal stop (though this last one is typically disambiguated with a diacritic as well).  Phonemically (at least according to traditional descriptions, and Modern Standard Arabic textbooks), Arabic only has these three cardinal vowels (well, six if you're counting vowel length, though, as I noted, short vowels are not written). Phonetically, they end up taking up plenty of vowel space due to phonetic context -- /a/ can be [æ] or [ɔ], /i/ can be [ɪ], /u/ can be /o/ -- but these differences rarely (if ever) create lexical or morphological minimal pairs..  English, on the other hand, has a ton of phonemic vowels. Mainstream American English has somewhere in the neighborhood of 11 vowels, most of which create minimal pairs. For example, since Arabic /a/ can be pronounced as either [ɔ] or [æ], both ""caught"" and ""cat"" would probably be written the same way in Arabic. That's not a problem for Arabic, but would be a problem for English.  (I should note, though, that Urdu also apparently has 11 vowels, and somehow makes do with the Arabic alphabet)  I suppose you could repurpose some Arabic characters with no English phonological equivalent to fill in for the missing vowels: both epiglottal fricative characters could be used, as well as the uvular fricative and uvular stop. But that wouldn't really be in the same spirit as using the Arabic alphabet to write English. You'd end up with something like the Cherokee syllabary, which largely uses Latin- and Cyrillic-looking characters to represent sounds completely differently than the source alphabets.  Of course, there's always diacritics. You can always romanize Arabic with enough diacritics, or arabicize English with enough diacritics. The problem isn't so much that it's ""difficult"", it's that there are several different competing systems that people can't agree on."

linguistics,3cfs9u,Lexinad,2,Wed Jul 8 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"The alphabet was a Gothic innovation transmitted to the other Germanic tribes, based off of a northern Old Italic alphabet.

Other than common decent, the techniques for writing encouraged a similar appearance (the old Turkic alphabet almost looks like runes itself due to the same inscription technique, even though it's almost completely unrelated, being descended from an Assyrian script through the Sogdian scripts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Turkic_alphabet )  Later on the alphabets of the Mediterranean saw new techniques and tools get used leading to the Trajan(-influenced) capitals and the development of the rounded uncial scripts even later.

Traditionally of course it's just another typeface; but it did lead to the creation of a number of ligatures that were brought into the humanist scripts as distinct letters, notably German's ä, ü, ö, and ß.  English used it from about the 12th century until using both scripts from about the 14th century until its utter abandonment by the 18th century. Germany and some of its (especially northern) neighbors however continued to use it until the 1940s - the Nazis declared them ""jewish letters"" (likely just to encourage the abandonment of Fraktur to ease communication in occupied territories), after which it didn't catch on again because everyone else was using antiqua typefaces and the countries wanted to ""modernize""."

Language Log has remarked on this on this (e.g. here and here):   I heard a radio piece about pregnant high-schoolers in which a girl said something like I think if someone in my class was pregnant I would be sympathetic to them. In such cases it's not the inability to assign sex to the referent that drives the selection of singular they, it's the mere fact of the antecedent being quantified or headed by a noun like person that can in other contexts be used of either sex. Mere inferred sex of the referent is not sufficient to force a choice of either he or she."

Any prescription dealing with grammatical elements is going to face a tougher battle than those dealing with lexical items, and I don't think people have any illusions about that matter.  The key thing to take away is that even if your description of how things are is right (and it's definitely not right for all speakers), it's not an indication of how things can be organized if speakers align their performance in a particular way, setting up the next generations of speakers forming their grammars on the basis of this altered input to have what you find ungrammatical as perfectly grammatical in their mental grammars."

My sense is that it's not representing /ȵ/ just given where it is and my assumption that the text is describing Japanese something Japonic. I think it may well just be /ɴ/. This looks like an older printing and a lot of the glyphs were not standardised (or rather, standards were not followed and often are still not) so you would often find printers using different options.  If you can give some more context or larger photos I can probably tell you with more certainty what you're looking at. Non-standard IPA in older East Asian texts is a bit of a hobby of mine, after all these years of dealing with it for Chinese languages.  edit: if /u/limetom is around he's probably pretty familiar with Amami phonology and probably eve this specific text."

linguistics,3ccvzn,limetom,6,Tue Jul 7 00:55:39 2015 UTC,"Given the positioning, I would assume that it's an alternative notation for the moraic nasal, which is usually written /ɴ/ or /N/ in modern texts on Amami. Across most Japonic languages, the moraic nasal is an underspecified nasal whose place of articulation will vary depending on the sound that follows. It mostly only occurs in syllable coda and usually represents a full mora. I strongly doubt that it's /ȵ/.  Edit: I found an article that uses the same symbol. See my update here."
linguistics,3ccvzn,limetom,11,Tue Jul 7 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"I think this is really a case of standard Japanese orthography influencing how Hirayama approaches other Japonic varieties. He does some of the best work (and certainly some of the most expansive in terms of coverage for Japanese/Japonic dialectology), but I've seen and heard in other cases where Japanese has influenced his perception of nonstandard varieties of Japanese and the various Ryukyuan varieties. Remember that these would be in the syllable-final nasal position, which is written with a its own syllabic character. Often it is given special status, when it probably doesn't really deserve quite as much as it gets.  While the syllable-final nasal in Japonic languages has a variety of realizations, I don't think it's ever postalveolar, as /u/mamashaq suggests based on the symbol Hirayama uses. I'm most familiar with Japanese and Okinawan, but I don't think Amami is too different.  It likely has a variety of realizations: a nasalized continuation of the preceding vowel, some sort of coronal nasal (speakers likely vary  between dental and alveolar), some sort of further back dorsal consonant (often written with a uvular nasal symbol, but honestly, I've never seen any good evidence for it being quite that far back).  Edit There is a small online dictionary of Naze dialect Amami which has some sound recordings. Here's the word /miigin/ 'new clothes', which has a syllable-final nasal."

Somehow نخیر (na-xayr) became a polite expression of disagreement. (It's basically ""no good"".) The ""na"" gets dropped frequently, so telling someone xayr in Persian is often understood mean that you're saying ""no"". This is why in Anatolian Turkish, where they cannot pronounce ""x"", the formal word for ""no"" is ""hayır"".  Here in Tajikistan people actually use ""xayr"" correctly to signal the end of a conversation. (Like saying, ""Well."")

Languages don't suddenly disrobe for no reason; if we're able to massively reconstruct our community's grammar in our mind on the basis of input with general success as children, we shouldn't expect to see lots of affixes or phonemes or whatever disappearing. If we're seeing a lot of simplification, there must be some outside reason, such as non-native speakers who have much more variable success in acquisition coming in and providing a lot of input for the community's children.   I think his argument is too new for there to be a consensus on it, but I find it persuasive (which I don't often do with McWhorter's arguments)."

With a plausible assumpion that regular forms are more likely to spread to other communities than irregular ones, it follows that languages with more communities will tend toward regularization more than languages spoken in only one village. Basically my assumption is that dialectical variation causes some averaging of irregularities over time.   So for me these hypotheses about number of speakers really don't trigger my bullshit-meter.  I remember some sociolinguistic works using sociological models of social networks to study spread of variation. I wonder if anyone has modelled networks with subnetworks that weekly interact among themselves but strongly interact within themselves, vs. Networks that strongly interact all over."

linguistics,3caqfx,keyilan,2,Sat Jul 11 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"Well in the case of English a lot of words are ultimately derived from Latin primarily because of the influence of French on Middle English. Since Norman French was a Latin-derived language and therefore nearly all the words were or Latin origin, when those go transferred into English they of course kept their origins.  Modern languages taking on English influence is a little different because it's not anything like military conquest and then English becoming the official language of the State. So it's a little different. A more similar example would be the spread of Mandarin influence on non-Mandarin Chinese languages, where they don't speak Mandarin at home, but because it's the national language it creeps in to their home languages."

I've seen this a couple of times now in comments/videos online where the person speaking says of something that was particularly good ""They fucked that up!"", or ""They fucked that shit up!"".   I've only seen it in the past year or two, and I haven't seen a lot of it, which makes me wonder if it's something that's common in AAVE, or a new linguistic feature. If it's new is it restricted to certain parts of the country?  (In this video the guy doing the commenting uses the phrase a couple of times and also uses it in other videos.)   It also appears in a comment left on this video.   I'm assuming it shares the same linguistic space as the phrase ""They tore that shit up!""?   Edit:  Related to this is there a specific linguistic term for when negative expressions are used as compliments? Eg.""That's bad!"", or ""That was really ill!"", or ""That was sick!"" or ""That was the shit!"" or the usages here of ""They fucked it up!""?"
linguistics,3caqfx,Infrastation,3,Mon Jul 6 23:18:34 2015 UTC,"So when an AAVE speaker says that someone ""fucked that shit up"", they're not saying that the action or actor is ""fucked"", but the object being acted upon has been ""fucked"", with ""fucked"" meaning ""to do/finish with flair"".  It's also used in the phrase ""get fucked.""  So, ""fucked that shit up"" means that the ""shit"" has been done with flair, or to a great extent.  So yes, it is a compliment.  Possibly a backhanded compliment (especially if emphasis is put on ""up""), but a compliment."
linguistics,3caqfx,smileyman,3,Tue Jul 7 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if I was unclear--I realize that it's a compliment. My questions were more about how and where it's used. Is it something that's recent? Is it widespread among AAVE users? Is there any real data on the etymology of the phrase?   Another question I thought of--I've only seen it used in reference to someone performing something, but my data pool is incredibly small. Is it a phrase that's associated with specific actions? Like would an AAVE speaker say to someone who restored their car ""Man you fucked that car up good?"" (To my ears that sounds entirely negative but I don't speak AAVE and I'm not around AAVE speakers very often.)   Or how about something like ""You fucked that test up good!""? Would that be considered a positive usage of the phrase or negative? To me it could go either way, whereas the first example seems to me to be negative.  Am I wrong?"
linguistics,3caqfx,Infrastation,5,Tue Jul 7 02:18:34 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that makes more sense.  I thought the original statement seemed a little obvious on how it was a compliment...  It is widespread, yes.  I've heard it used outside the AAVE community to a great extent too.  It mainly refers to an action being witnessed by the speaker and being done by another person.  For instance, I would say it about my friend Bobby.  It also usually refers to actions which are quick, such as doing a dance move or executing a video game combination.  Working on a car or sailing a boat might be too long-term for the phrase to really apply.  As to ""you fucked that test up good"", it might really depend on emphasis.  If the emphasis is constant, it could be saying that the test went bad.  If the emphasis is on ""fucked"", ""up"", or ""good"", it could be a positive thing.  Again, though, a test might be too long-term for the phrase to typically be used as a positive."

The way I've worded it in the past is like this:  Anyone purporting to have the answer as to whether something is a dialect of a language versus a language related to another language is someone who has an agenda. That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Maybe your agenda is figuring out the most efficient way to get people around the world to know about Jesus. Maybe your agenda is to make it so the greatest number of people have access to native-language education, knowing you can't print books in every since language variety in the world. Maybe your agenda is you just like the idea that Serbian gets to be its own language. These are all reasonable.  In the case of the number of languages, it's useful to be able to say to someone ""Look we have about 7000 language right now, but they're dying and we'll be down to 5000 in a generation and if you care about diversity and people having a voice then you have to recognise that's a bad thing"".

The words you list are also minimal pairs that speakers of GA can distinguish.   Do the position of the mouth and tongue differ in any way when pronouncing these two phonemes in General American?    They do differ - if they didn't, they wouldn't differ in sound either. The problem is that with vowels, it is very hard to perceive how they're pronounced because you receive less physical feedback. I can feel when I make a closure for a /k/, for example - but it's much harder for me to tell where my tongue is when I pronounce an /ɪ/. Generally speaking, the tongue is higher and more forward for /ɪ/ than for /ɛ/, but I would not expect someone to be able to ""feel"" this.   You might want to consider training yourself on minimal pairs by listening and repeating them - to learn new distinctions through synthesis, which is what a lot of field linguists do when confronted with novel contrasts.

We could discuss underlying features, but phonetically, the difference is not just vowel height. I'm not sure where you're getting that from, based on the chart you linked.   So based on the chart I linked, what are the other differences apart from vowel height? If you mean vowel backness, the difference is almost negligible."
linguistics,3caqfx,Matt2411,2,Sat Jul 11 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"The general rule is that a thread is for something which has a chance of sparking more discussion than just people giving the answer, I think. General American makes a difference between /ɪ/ and /ɛ/. Both merging into something one vowel is a feature of Southern accent. (Note the capital, this is referring to the cultural area.) I know it as the pin-pen merger. I do not know the actual realisation of the vowels, but they're not tooo far away from the cardinal they're normally rendered as. (Unlike /ʌ/, which for British and Austrlian accents does a marry hop around the regions of [ɐ~a].) Also, please us which language you natively speak. Purely out of curiosity."

I didn't know there was a merger in the south.. maybe I should try to acquire a Southern accent and that'd be the end of my troubles, don't you think? Hahaha. Anyhow, I swear I can hardly perceive it in the Standand American accent. Check the Cambridge dictionary pronunciation for both RP and GA - I pasted the links below - in ""sit"" and ""set"": don't the vowels sound approximately the same in GA? I can't seem to hear a short ""i"" sound at all in the word ""sit"", it sounds more like an /e/ or /ɛ/. Maybe it's just the fact I lack both of these sounds in my mother tongue, which is Spanish by the way. Both of those ""e""s are in between my mid front unrounded vowel (/e̞/), so it's probably natural I can't distinguish them at all.  Off-topic: It sucks to have Spanish as your mother tongue when it comes to linguistics, because it only has FIVE vowels out of the many more you can find in English, Portuguese or French. I've struggled so much when learning the IPA vowel chart. Luckily though, I think tackling the /ɪ/ - /ɛ/ difference is my last serious unresolved issue. Do you know of any detailed resource that can help me pinpoint the subtleties of both vowels? If not, I could just stick to the British distinction, and make my ""i""s in ""bit""/""sit""/""pin"" closer to an /iː/ than to an /ɛ/.

And sorry, I was unclear: Learning Southern speech won't do you much good, since the pin-pen merger only happens before nasal consonants. (And, stereotypically, Southerners don't like Spanish-speaking people much.)

Except, of course, when you have a Standard ""neutral"" Accent you can imitate, as with General American which is the accent I want to approximate to at least (I know this is really the Midwest accent... but it's the one mostly used on TV and media).  I've tried to distinguish the sounds by taking into account this difference in vowel height, as you say. They're both unrounded and with the tongue in front, so vowel height is the only factor of the IPA vowel chart that appears to separate these two sounds apart. But when it comes to listening, I can hardly perceive any difference... so I figured out there was maybe another detail I was missing.  Thanks for your help anyway, much appreciated."

linguistics,3caqfx,kingkayvee,2,Mon Jul 6 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"So, this is something I've wondered about for a while.    Why is it that the noun class markers for singular and plural of bantu are treated as separate? I know it has to do with Meinhof, but I recall at least two professors saying his views aren't really used anymore (along the lines that a language like Spanish would have 4 classes, rather than two). Why do we still follow this convention?"
linguistics,3caqfx,Jafiki91,2,Tue Jul 7 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"Can you clarify exactly what you mean as 'separate'?  Are you asking why isn't Spanish considered a language with 4 classes (masc.sing, masc.pl, fem.sing, fem.pl) over gender while Bantu languages have multiple classes even though there is a relationship (more or less) between which one takes which plural?  If I can start, I don't think anyone doesn't use Meinhof's Noun Class system. It is still the norm, as far as I'm aware, when discussing the grammar of the languages and also within language pedagogy (just spent a year studying Xhosa in South Africa and can confirm this personally).  Now, the way the Noun Classes work in Bantu languages is not as straight forward as the 2 classes of Spanish, where there is a productive way of producing plurals (add an /s/). That already discredits any claim for why there aren't 4 classes. Secondly, we must look at concordance which does not exist as much in Romance languages like Spanish as it does in Bantu languages. Each noun class has a set of matching prefixes used in various ways whereas the Spanish only has noun-adj agreement.  I guess what we really need to know from you is what exactly you mean by 'separate' and if there is any reason to insist that there is no reason for them to be considered as different groups (just because Group 2 is the plural of Group 1 does not mean Group 2 = Group 1)."
linguistics,3caqfx,kingkayvee,2,Tue Jul 7 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"I guess what I was getting at, is that if (in some hypothetical Bantu language) Class 1 and Class 2 both refer to people (doctors, farmers, man, woman, etc etc), and the only difference is plurality, why not just call them both Person Class, with 2 being the plural form of 1?       But your answer makes sense. I'm not overly familiar with Bantu languages (something I've really been meaning to study up on), so I was unaware of the various forms of concordance. I know that verbs agree based on these classes, but that's about it. Could you maybe give some examples of other places where these matching prefixes and suffixes are used?"
linguistics,3caqfx,Jafiki91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the reason for it is simply the matter of the concordances, as well as certain inconsistencies (for example, depending on the language, there may be no plurals, or there may be shared and unexpected plurals). For the most part, the classes simply refer to the morphology so it is useful to have them as separate.   The prefixes also occur in numbers, adjectives, pronouns, nouns, etc.  Swahili Ki-tabu ki-kubwa ki-naanguka. cl.7-book cl.7-big cl.7-PRESENT-fall   Basically, the reason why is simply for organization. We could say that there are fewer classes, but things would be less analyzed than splitting them into singular-plural pairs as there are no productive way of deriving them from each other. Systematically, though they refer to the same abstract concept, they are very different."

No other information about how it could have started is given. Since the pronunciation is more variable near Limón, where the largest population of West Indian speakers of English and English-based creoles are, it would probably be a stretch to imagine that the retroflex pronunciation of /r/ is due to contact with English, particularly since the government made it illegal for these black people to move inland toward the Central Valley."

linguistics,3cbhdy,Brotten,7,Mon Jul 6 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"Japanese grammatical markers' pronunciation is based on the word they follow. E.g. whether the accusative marker is pronounced /wó/ or /wò/ is dependent on the preceding word. The pronunciation is an inherent feature of the morpheme itself and independent of the tone/stress of the syllables preceding the marker.    I would say there are five homophonous grammatical markers all pronounced の no:   The genitive case maker の no  The indefinite pronoun の no The copula の no (often treated as just a version of the genitive case marker) The nominalizer の no And the evidential の no   For instance, the genitive:   太郎の本  Taroo=no hon Taroo=GEN book 'Taroo's book'   The indefinite pronoun:   小さいのが欲しいです。 Chiisa-i=no=ga hoshi-i desu. small-IPFV=one=NOM want-IPFV COP.POL.IPFV 'I want the small one.' (Makino & Tsutsui 1986: 316)   The copula:   友達の学生 tomodachi no gakusei friend COP student 'the student who is my friend'   The nominalizer:   雪子さんがビールを飲むのを見た Yukiko-san=ga biiru=o nom-u=no=o mi-ta Yukiko-HON=NOM beer=ACC drink-IPFV=NMLZ=ACC see-PFV 'I saw Yukiko drink beer.' (Makino & Tsutsui 1986: 318)   And the evidential (often reduced to just ん n):    結婚したいんだ kekkon s-i-ta-i n da marry do-INF-want.to-IPFV EV COP.IPFV  'I want to marry you.' (Makino & Tsutsui 1986: 326)   According to Martin (1975: 23-4), in standard Japanese, の no can be the locus of pitch (the syllable after which pitch will fall). Further, all of these can replace the pitch accent of a word when the locus of pitch accent falls on the final syllable.  So for instance, we end up with:   犬の inu=nó LLH   Compare:   犬が inú=ga LHL   As Martin notes, there are a number of complex exceptions. And I think since he doesn't split up the various の no like I do, he actually misses capturing some facts about them. It's probably the case that only the genitive behaves like he describes here, while all of the others do not alter the pitch accent of a proceeding word.   Also, the particle /wa/ is mostly pronounced [hä], with [h], if I'm correctly informed, being an intervocalic allophone of /w/, which does not get triggered across morphological boundaries.    As others have noted, the topic particle は wa is pronounced [wa]. Historically, it was pronounced something like [pa] in Old Japanese. It is a clitic rather than a suffix, and is relatively ""attached"" to the word it modifies. So during Middle Japanese, the rule that said f [ɸ] between vowels becomes w [w] applied to it, and although the pronunciation was altered, the spelling was kept. In modern Japanese, if it was spelled like it was pronounced, it would use わ [wa], not は [ha]. (And this is a common mistake by second language learners of Japanese.)   Why then do we get taught that these are particles rather than noun declension endings?    Part of the reason is that they are not as ""attached"" to the words they modify as, say, Latin or other ""Classical"" languages' case endings are. They are much more predictable, as they are much more invariable. You only really have the equivalent to one declension class in Japanese. Compare this to Latin where you have five.   Can they ever be used as something else than a noun-postclitic?   It is probably the case that in standard Japanese, the locative case marker に =ni is the same =ni that can occur after verbs marking purpose. For example:   村井さんは昼ご飯を食べにうちへ帰った。 Murai-san=wa hirugohan=o tabe=ni uchi=e kaet-ta Murai-HON=TOP lunch=ACC eat\INF=LOC home=DIR return-PFV 'Mr. Murai went home to eat his lunch.' (Makino & Tsutsui 1986: 297)   In older varieties of Japanese, を =o could be used similarly, but it has lost this function in modern Japanese (Vovin 2005: 158)."
linguistics,3cbhdy,limetom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:53:27 2015 UTC,"Excuse my ignorance but what distinguishes particles from noun classes?  When I say ""Ashita-e"" why am I using the word ""ashita"" and the particle ""(h)e""? Why not some declension of ""ashita"" that ends in an ""e""?  (I'm more comfortable with Hindi than Japanese so the example might make sense in Hindi:) For example you can say (in Hindi) ""मैं घर पर हूँ"" ""Main ghar par hoon"" ""I am at home"" where ""ghar"" means ""home"" and ""par"" means ""at"".  What makes ""par"" a postposition/particle and why isn't it just some declension of the noun ""gharpar ""?"
linguistics,3cbhdy,JoseElEntrenador,2,Tue Jul 7 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"So to be clear, I'd say a noun declension is just a shared pattern of marking agreement for things like person, number, and gender across a set of nouns. And really to talk about one meaningfully, you need more than one.  Especially outside of Indo-European languages and some other languages of the Old World, ""declension"" isn't a term that is used. For languages like Turkish or Japanese, it really doesn't make sense. There's just one set of ways to indicate agreement with stuff like number, gender, and person on nouns, and these things rarely--if ever--change. The nominative case marker is always =ga in Japanese.  Consider how different this is in Hindi. You have two different patterns (declensions) across nouns: those, like लड़का laṛkā 'boy' which share a common ending for their direct singular forms (for masculine nouns, -ā), and those, like किताब kitāb 'book', that don't share a common ending  for their direct singular forms. (Or so Wikipedia tells me; don't know Hindi.)  Hindi घर ghar 'house' is actually in the second declension of nouns. While it doesn't change in the singular, with a postposition like पर -par 'on', as I understand it, it will change forms in the plural, to घरों पर gharõ-par 'on the houses'.  Getting more in-depth, we would look at how ""attached"" these things are to their host nouns. As is one of the realities of linguistics, it's not always as clear-cut as we might like. Adpositions are quite tightly attached, while clitics are almost independent words. On the other hand, we have cases like Latin, where while they are similar across all noun declensions, it's hard to really get a tidy representation of just what something like the accusative singular. Rather, it's easier to refer to nouns by the pattern they belong to rather than some really abstract suffix, like -Vm for the accusative singular (which can end up as -am, -um, -ium, etc., depending on which declension the noun belongs to).  Particles are generally on the independent word-like end of the spectrum. But they're actually a pretty fuzzy thing. What people regularly call particles in Japanese are actually a number of things (suffixes like plural たち -tachi, clitics like nominative case が =ga, etc.)."

But for yet another typologically distinct language, we can look at Fataluku (a Timor-Alor-Pantar (i.e., non-Austronesian or ""Papuan"") language of East Timor). It is relatively isolating, and when it does have synthesis, it is all usually aggultination.  Fataluku basically does not change nouns to mark the kinds of agreement ""declensions"" are usually taken as being patterns to mark. For instance, there only appears to be a marked nominative case marker -a. This form does not vary across nouns. Nominative and accusative are usually unmarked, but in some situations where subjects are more ""subject-like"" than usual (definite, specific, topical, etc.), than we'd have a case marker.  For instance, the name Tom, according to my Fataluku-speaking friends, only ever shows up in the form Tom. We do find it with the marked nominative case marker -a, as in:    Tom-a malai. Tom-NOM foreign 'Tom is a foreigner.'   But all nouns behave like this. There's only one declension class. It either has a (""perfectly"") regular affix, or nothing at all. Many of the Classical languages of the Old World, again, are not like this.  Basically it is a quirk of fusional languages, and not even all of them.   How would you even measure that? Like how likely it is for a particle to change to match the root noun (like incredible vs. impossible?)   Yes. There are a number of ways to do this.   Instead of writing it all out, though, there's a really important (and fairly accessible article) written by Arnold Zwicky and Geoffery Pullum that is easily availible from Zwicky's website published in 1986 in the journal Language that deals with some ways of distinguishing this ""attachedness"".

linguistics,3cbhdy,dom,3,Tue Jul 7 09:53:53 2015 UTC,"So basically you're asking, how do we know that =ga, =o, etc. are clitics (syntactically independent) and not suffixes (morphologically dependent)? I.e., since Japanese noun phrases all have the noun at the end and the particles attach onto the noun, and furthermore the tone of the particle (high or low) is dependent on the pitch accent of the word it attaches to, can't we just say it's noun morphology?  The thing is =ga, =o, etc. don't just attach to nouns, they attach to noun phrases. E.g. /u/limetom gives the example ""[Yukiko-san=ga biiru=o nom-u=no]=o mi-ta"" ('I saw Yukiko drink beer'), where the =o attaches to a nominalized clause.  Others have also mentioned this, but just to summarize: the spellings ""ha"" and ""wo"" are just spelling conventions, the forms are really ""wa"" and ""o"", so the issue of phonological alternations that you brought up is actually not an issue at all.  Finally I'm not sure what you mean about the pronunciations being an ""inherent feature"" of the morphemes... You also say that the pronunciations are ""dependent on the preceding word"", and those two statements seem mutually exclusive (the particle's tone can't be both inherent and completely dependent on the preceding context). In any case, most of these particles have no inherent pitch accent (the exception being the genitive =no that /u/limetom points out), and whether they're pronounced with high or low tone is indeed completely dependent on the preceding word."

You mention the internal inconsistencies, could you mention where they are so I can improve my understanding of PIE?   Well, I see <kludi>, and I assume I'm looking at a very late (pre-Celtic, maybe) reconstruction of PIE, since *dʰ has become *d. But, I look around further and you've still got *bʰ as <bh> and *gʰ as <gh>. Did voiced aspirates lose their aspiration (like in Celtic, Germanic, etc.) in this dialect or not? It can't be both.  You also render *gʷʰérmom 'warm (acc.)' as <ghermom>, implicitly arguing that in the stage of PIE that you're working on, labialized velars (e.g. *gʷʰ) have become unlabialized (e.g. *gh). This happens in the Satem languages, like Sanskrit, hence Schleicher's. But in <kludi>, with *ḱ merging with *k, you've already told me that you're reconstructing a Centum dialect and NOT a Satem dialect. You CAN'T have both <ghermom> (without w) and <kludi> (without indicating the palatalization) in the same dialect, because no such dialect existed (that we know of; it's not impossible). This (and other reasons) is why Schleicher's version is no longer considered the best reconstruction.  You're also missing the tone accent and vowel length (incl. syllabic sonorants), which are extremely important.  You really can't do a PIE reconstruction without thinking through all the phonology (and morphology) first; you can't just go at it word by word, because you'll end up making a lot of implicit arguments that contradict each other.

""Written in Stone"" appeared to put all that to one side and make it all seem more straightforward, without a need for accents and superficially unpronounceable consonant clusters.   I could see the book wasn't right in places, but I don't think I realised how far adrift it is from mainstream academia.   Googling further, I've found this soundcloud file which I can listen to as I read Byrd's fable above, and even the laryngeals make sense now as pronounceable sounds.

There are plenty of modern languages, like the Salish family or the Kartvelian family (which latter are spoken tantalizingly close to the proposed PIE ""Urheimat""...), whose consonant clusters make reconstructed PIE sound like Hawaiian by comparison.

The speakers were all old and selected for their isolated accents. In many ways this makes the samples non-representative of the current accents spoken in those places. The Yorkshire accent featured rhoticity for example which is unheard of today. It's not really fair to use a Yorkshire accent that was probably more prominent in the first half of the 20th century and compare it with a modern accent really. I think some were taken from the British library that has an excellent archive of accents but I don't think they're quite as old or traditional. I felt like some of the accent didn't really do justice to the areas, the Kent accent didn't feature an alveolar tap for example. Some accents like Scouse and Brummie have changed massively over time, and some like Kent, Sussex and Suffolk have been supplanted by varying levels of Estuary influence."

However that's partly because the video includes some quite obscure and old-fashioned accents while omitting some much more nationally 'famous' ones.    Most people can easily divide England up into about 7 or 8 accent areas along with several additional well-known, highly localised urban accents like Scouse or MLE. Within those areas local people tend to have more precision than this video implies.

linguistics,3c86b8,Datuzal,7,Sun Jul 5 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"There is evidence of an original two-way distinction between animate and inanimate nouns. The original animate class would have been made up of later masculine and feminine nouns, and all of these were inflected similarly.  Then eventually, the neuter plural (likely collective) ending, *-h2, came to be used as a singular ending for abstract, and then feminine, nouns, and there was suddenly a three-class system.  As the connection between nouns of the new class and the idea of natural gender grew stronger, original animate nouns referring to female humans or animals came to be treated as feminine as well, despite often maintaining their original inflections (though, of course, many would later have their form changed, as well, in various daughter languages).  I'm no expert as to how exactly this is possible, but it seems likely to me that at this point the genders of other nouns could change just as easily as those of Latin's were able to do so in its process of developing into the modern Romance languages.  Some of the specific assignments could maybe be attributed to the natural genders of gods associated with nouns, as well. The original religion of PIE's speakers seems to have been somewhat animistic, if the existence of both animate and inanimate forms of some words is anything to go by (note the difference between *péh₂ur and *h₁n̥gʷnis)."
linguistics,3c86b8,TrigintaSeptem,2,Mon Jul 6 21:10:35 2015 UTC,"This is not my specialist subject, but what you've just described cannot be the explanation how the feminine gender arose. Rather it is an explanation how the *-h2 ending became a new inflection class. The definition of noun class is that it is an agreement class, that is that it controls agreement. Any account on how the feminine arose in PIE must explain how the feminine came to control different agreement markers, if not it isn't really an explanation how the feminine arose."
linguistics,3c86b8,merijn2,2,Tue Jul 7 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. The singular feminine endings for adjectives are identical to those used for nouns, and to those that would already have been present in both as the collective neuter. The plural endings were obviously innovated to fit the new pattern. As new feminine nouns with no *-h2 ending came to be viewed as part of the same class, they just started to be used with those adjective inflections."

linguistics,3c86b8,TrigintaSeptem,2,Tue Jul 7 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I thought you meant that it was just the ending that was used for abstract and feminine nouns, but not the agreement pattern. But what you are basically saying is that neuter plural was used for abstractions, and later plurals, so that you could say that that at some point abstractions were morphosyntactically neuter plurals, in that they have neuter plural morphology and also that they are triggering neuter plural. That is a much more believable story. A problem that I can see is that you would expect that feminines always trigger the same agreement as neuter plural, certainly in the nominative. However, what you see is that in Latin and Greek the same form is used for both the masculine and feminine for many adjectives, and for many other adjectives and determiners in Greek, including the article, there is a different form of the feminine, but it is different from the neuter plural forms. How do you explain that?"
linguistics,3c86b8,merijn2,2,Tue Jul 7 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know a whole lot about the developments of these languages specifically, but the Greek definite article seems to be the result of several kinds of analogy. The demonstrative it derives from was already pretty odd in PIE, with nominal *so, *seh2, and *tod, but other forms all with *t- for each gender. Anyways, *seh2 was created from the root of *so after the development of the feminine to match other words ending in *-h2. I wouldn't expect the neuter plural (regular PIE *teh2) to be similar to it.  I'm interested in the other examples you've mentioned, though. Could you maybe list some specific words that demonstrate a lack of feminine-masculine distinction?"
linguistics,3c86b8,TrigintaSeptem,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"But the question is, if the feminine is originally a neuter plural, why is the form of the demonstrative not the same in both cases in PIE? Why was there a need for a special form for the feminine?   The Latin example I was thinking about is here. You can find the Greek examples here"
linguistics,3c86b8,merijn2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:29:10 2015 UTC,"The neuter plural/collective forms came to be used for feminine singulars before *seh2 was created. It could be that the neuter form still carried the idea of ""it"", which wouldn't have been acceptable for referring to a human, hence the new *seh2. Because it's present in all three genders, the spread of *t- probably happened after this, so that the distinction between the *t- forms and the *s- forms would have been at the time much stronger."
linguistics,3c86b8,TrigintaSeptem,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"As for the adjectives... It might be worth noting that those in Latin appear to owe their lack of masculine-feminine distinction to the derivational suffixes that they were formed by. I'm not sure how we'd account for these, and I'd like to find out, but I don't think they're necessarily problematic to this theory of the genesis of the gender system."

The thing to keep in mind is that what you're proposing is nothing like Universal Grammar. UG is a set of conditions placed on rules. If it were analagous to UG, Universal Lexicon, which is what I'm calling your proposal, would have to be conditions placed on learnable vocabulary.

The other side of the coin is ""pragmatics"", which studies how meanings arise from context. So where semantics takes, for example, a sentence like ""it's cold in here"", and tells you about what it means to be cold, and how that combines with all the other words to produce a literal meaning for ""it's cold in here"", pragmatics tells you how we might reason that, in certain contexts, what the speaker of the sentence really means is, ""hey close the window"". That scratches the surface, but of course it gets complicated and the lines get blurred sometimes.  Both semantics and pragmatics study how meaning is conveyed by language. Semiotics, on the other hand, studies how meaning is conveyed by symbols more generally, not necessarily by language in the strictest sense."

linguistics,3c74re,BreadBathAndBeyond,3,Sun Jul 5 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"A standard view of what meaning is is the one formalized by Grice as ""non-natural meaning"". Natural meaning is things like symptoms in the semiotic sense: signs that convey information based on a natural association with the referent, example hints at a crime scene: ""this wound means a blunt weapon"" for instance. Non-natural meaning is what one has to intent to say by manipulation of signs that refer but are not caused by their object.  A simple view of the division is that Semantics studies the literal, context-less, truth-conditional content of a sentence, and how this content integrates with itself in a syntactic structure, while Pragmatics studies everything else in meaning-nn: the non-literal, the influence of context, the effects without truth-values, the enrichment of the semantics, the integration of all these forms of meaning into a unitary meaning in a syntactic (or other) structure, and of this meaning into a unitary discourse.  For instance, if I say ""John is either at work or in his car"", I convey more than the semantic assertion about the world relative to John's position, I also convey that I don't know where he is. The sentence would still be true if I did know, but no one would say that, so it conveys meaning beyond its bare assertion about the world.  If I lower the volume and say ""John's birthday is tomorrow"", I convey more than the semantic assertion about John's age, I convey that I want this conversation to remain somewhat secret.  If I say ""I just sold my car"", it will have a unitary semantics, but its affect may be very different if I say it in a happy tone vs. a sad one."

Irish has 5 different distinct stages of its evolution, being:    Primitive Irish Old Irish Middle Irish Early Modern Irish Modern Irish   However, Primitive Irish is the earliest known form of all the Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx).   Early Manx would be quite intelligible from its predecessors (not as far as Primitive, but close), as Manx was almost a dead language not so long ago, much like Hebrew and Sanskrit - simply because they aren't spoken any more, so I don't think that counts.  So to answer your question, it wouldn't be possible to understand early Irish easily as a Modern speaker now, but all Irish universities provide courses in Early Irish etc., so learning the language isn't impossible.

linguistics,3c30zp,kanadskiy,25,Sat Jul 4 07:34:55 2015 UTC,"I think we need to clarify the question.  Clearly the rest of the world contains more different writing systems than does India.  What is unusual about India is that a large number of closely related but distinct writing systems are found, often one script per language.  Masica explains this situation in his chapter on writing systems in The Indo-Aryan Languages as follows:   political fragmentation of India between the fourth and seventeenth centuries lack of an institution to ""maintain the unity of the written word"" (as, for example, the Roman Catholic Church did for the Roman alphabet). when printing was introduced, this ""froze many minor differences"" rather than eradicating them a widespread feeling in the region that a separate ""language""­ demands a distinctive script."

I believe there were even times when you would see, for instance, Latin expressions written using an italic typeface in the middle of an otherwise blackletter German text.  Obviously that trend in Europe was undone, whereas in India it was fully codified."

As dialects evolved, there was probably a need evolved for writing down things so that the teaching-learning experience could be smoother.  It is interesting to note that Vedic Sanskrit, despite its great antiquity, was written down rather late in history (the teaching-learning experience being largely around memorizing very large texts). This was a consequence of the orthodox position against 'opening up' of these texts. Local languages/cultures had no such prohibitions, and developed writing systems to express themselves.  Finally, the fact that almost all the Indic writing systems are Brahmi-based would indicate extensive interactions amongst these language groups as they evolved their scripts."

And most ethnonyms tend to be derived from a word that means 'people'. This is true for Germans (tjhey call themselves and their language Deutsch, which comes from a word that meant 'people'). Outside of Europe, plenty of Amerindians named themselves this way. A language I worked on was Yokuts, which is derived from the Yokut word for people ('yokoch' '), and we use that word for the language and the people. They don't have a native word for their language, though. They just call it 'speech'.  I wouldn't be surprised if many languages didn't have a native name for themselves. Hopefully others will chime in with other examples.

linguistics,3c22tn,Brotten,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:45:20 2015 UTC,"It's late here so forgive the poor phrasing.  Central kingdoms are kingdoms, plural, that are central. You could say middle realm, if by realm you mean region and not political entity. 中華 gets more complicated, but gets back to 華 meaning ""splendour"" or ""gloriousness"" which is an allusion to Civilisation, with a capital C, being Chinese at the time, and what was perceived as the highest form of civilisation. Instead of having various forms of civilisation, the concept was treated as more linear, and China was considered to be the most refined.   Later on, you do find Korean sources referring to Korea as 中華, as an intentional statement that China (under the rule of foreigners i.e. the Manchurians during the Qing) has lost its status as most civilised, and Korea, by maintaining Confucian culture and the corresponding refinements, is therefore the Central Splendour and not China. This view was not widespread, but the fact that it existed at all is telling of how the term 中華 was conceptualised in the wider region (of which China was just one part).  As for Wiktionary, the problem is that you cannot take a Chinese word, split it up into the component characters, look at those characters meanings, and then expect to get an accurate translation of what the concept means to the larger culture. It works sometimes, but can't always be trusted. This is especially true when dealing with older or more literary terms for which the shared cultural background from which they were derived is understood to those who were originally using them, but not well represented in Wiktionary or other dictionaries. There's also a lot of folk etymology surrounding characters, propagated by passing on stories of word origins that are not fact checked and often incorrect."

That's fine, but it's still not either the etymological or intended meaning. You can call America ""Beautiful country"", but that's also not what the name really is.  Putting all that aside and looking at this purely linguistically: Either way, ""中国"" doesn't actually mean ""middle""+""country"". It just means ""the big country in East Asia which has Beijing as its capital city"". It just means ""China"". We don't store these items in our mental lexicon as broken down etymologies and component parts. It's just a word, and a Chinese kid learns that they're in ""zhongguo"" before they ever really start to think about the historical baggage of that term, and many people may be forever unknowing of even the folk etymologies (say for example an illiterate person in the mountains down south). We can talk for days about these etymologies, either real or imagined, but in the end it has very little if anything to do with how most people engage with the terms themselves.

In Schuessler (2006)'s system, it's something like MC *ʔuâB. And in Starostin (2006)'s reconstruction (from the Starling database), it's something like MC *ʔwấ.  It's not clear what the ultimate source of this word is. Several other Chinese terms for foreign cultures and places are actually loans. For instance, in the 史記 Shǐ Jì, Khwārazm is given as 驩潛 (Mandarin Huānqián) OC *xʕar-dzem (Baxter & Sagart 2014: 260-1). So 倭 could be a loan from Japanese. But as it doesn't appear in other sources, it might just be a Chinese term.  If that's the case, it probably didn't actually mean 'dwarf'. Rather, it more meant something like 'bent over' or 'subservient', referring likely to the fact that Japan at the time had a tributary relationship. (Though, of course, certainly not like the tributary relationship established later on.)  There is another term used to refer to Japanese in the 三國志 Sānguó Zhì, given either as 邪馬壹 (Mandarin Yámǎyī):   Baxter & Sagart (2014)  MC yae maeX 'jit Schuessler (2009)1 MC jia maB ʔjet Starostin (2006)2 ja mạ́ ʔjit   This is often regarded as a manuscript error for 邪馬臺 (Mandarin  Yámǎtái):   Baxter & Sagart (2014) MC yae maeX doj Schuessler (2009)1 MC jia maB dậi Starostin (2006)2 MC ya mạ́ dʌj   The later is what we'd expect given how Old Japanese and Middle Chinese phonology would have lined up at the time, so it's pretty clear that the Chinese did indeed have contact and borrow the OJ word Yamatö (prob. pronounced [jamatə] in OJ).

linguistics,3c53a4,ThePeopleYes,8,Sat Jul 4 21:36:58 2015 UTC,"As per /u/mamashaq 's comment, here's a excerpt from the FAQ.   Is gender inherently sexist?  No. In fact, it's probably better to think of these as noun classes, rather than as genders. It's easy to confuse the two when your language only has two noun classes, and they happen to split male and female humans. Instead, realize that some languages have many noun classes, such as Swahili with sixteen, many of which have nothing to do with biological sex. Noun classes merely categorize nouns for more efficient communication and say nothing about sexual roles.   Also   One mistake people tend to make when learning a language with gender class is to assume that grammatical gender necessarily corresponds to sex. It does not. Instead, these categories are better thought of as grammatical classes rather than genders.  The term ""gender"" is a bit of a misnomer. The term began because the first modern linguists were students of Indo-European (IE) languages, languages where the grammatical gender closely matches the actual gender of animals. This is a coincidence. For instance, Swahili has 16 gender classes (!), and only one or two of them could be described as mapping to a ""male-female"" binary.  Even within IE tongues, the description of gender is incorrect; Spaniards don't think of a bridge as a ""male"" (el puente, masculine) nor do Germans think of a little girl as an androgynous child (das Mädchen, neuter). The grammatical gender assigned to the noun is best interpreted as coincidental rather than intentional (though coincidental is not the most apt term because it's really the product of language evolution, but that's a discussion for another time) By the way, this ""problem"" is almost always created by English-as-a-first-language speakers because English is a genderless language system. English grammatical gender was lost in the Middle English period and what is left is actual gender, where declaratives and even metaphors must correspond to a gender (calling a ship a ""she"" necessarily invokes a feminine aspect whereas the same would not be true in Catalan, it would only be thought of as grammatically incorrect or poetic). In other words, English speakers are foisting their language upon another's to create problems that did not exist in the first place.   The languages you've studied all have similar kinds of grammatical gender. Other languages don't classify nouns in ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" but as ""animate"" and ""inanimate"" for example.   ingrained in any one language   While most languages do not have grammatical gender, most languages do have words for men and women. Many cultures have pretty well defined roles for women and men which can be reflected in language even if there isnt grammatical gender."

I can see the point, but this statement sounds incorrect misleading to me. I'm a Portuguese native speaker, and mandatory gender demarcation in our language is a problem for a number of people, especially when you are referring to mixed groups or to readers whose sex is unspecified. It bothers some people, for example, that when referring to groups people will tend to use the pronoun eles (they, masculine) rather than elas(they, feminine). Where I study it is common in written texts to substitute gender suffixes o and a for symbols like ""x"" or ""@"". E.g. elxs or el@s instead of eles/elas."
linguistics,3c53a4,anewkindofpokemon,3,Sun Jul 5 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"I made a somewhat relevant post something like a year ago. I'm linking it because it'll save me some writing, but do note it's directed to English speakers, so you might find it too obvious.  I don't know about Portuguese, but I've always argued in the case of Spanish that the ""problem"" seems to stem from over-rationalisation of what the noun classes are, caused partly by the infelicitous name given to the ""masculine"" gender.  What I mean is that ""masculine"" gender isn't just used as a catch-all when talking about groups of people, it's also used as an equivalent to English ""it"" (which is inherently sex- and gender-less) as in (1). Compare with (2).  1. No digas lo que estás pensando.  2. *No digas la que estás pensando. (Acceptable only in a context in which we can expect a feminine noun that's being elided as in la cosa que [...] or la película que [...]. The equivalent with ""actual"" masculine gender would be el <something> que, not lo que.)  As we can see in (3), (4), (5), (6), lo can replace both ""masculine"" DPs and genderless syntactic objects like full clauses, but la can only replace feminine DPs.  3. Voy a hacer [CP que se calme] I'm going to make him/her/it calm down -> Lo voy a hacer.  4. Voy a hacer [DP_M el papeleo] I'm going to do the paperwork -> Lo voy a hacer.  5. Voy a hacer [DP_F la cama] I'm going to make the bed -> La voy a hacer.  6. Voy a hacer [CP que se calme] I'm going to make him/her/it calm down -> *La voy a hacer.  That is, thinking that we're using the ""masculine""-gender for mixed groups is backwards thinking. Anyone thinking straight would reach the opposite conclusion: what we've been calling ""masculine"" gender is actually a catch-all for anything that doesn't perfectly fit the feminine category.  Language tends to work like that. Think about singular and plural. It's not that we actually have singular and plural. Rather, we have singular on the one hand, and not-singular on the other hand. We know that because we treat nothingness as plural (unless there's a special ""nothingness"" marker, in which case we mark it as singular). So, (7), (8) and (9). Some languages treat 0 as singular, if my memory serves me right.  7. Tengo cero manzanas. I have zero apples.  8. No tengo manzanas. I don't have apples.  9. No tengo ninguna manzana. I don't have no apple.  All of this said, people might still feel more comfortable using @, x or whatever to avoid assuming gender. It's a perfectly reasonable decision, more so given the fact that it's a very touchy topic nowadays. Whether or not it makes full sense to say that the non-feminine gender in Spanish is a masculine gender, and whether or not using it only implies not assuming that antecedent or referent is of feminine (gender); no one gets to be an asshole.  The most reasonable option is always to use what people feel comfortable with. It's a simple rule, and theoretical linguistics doesn't get to override it."

I'm a Portuguese native speaker, and mandatory gender demarcation in our language is a problem for a number of people   I didnt write that comment, it came from a link in the FAQ. Personally, I agree. In French, there's a bit of a debate over the feminisation of terms for historically male only professions. It partly depends on the geography (Quebec/Canada tends to have more neologisms that are feminsations of professions while in France, people tend to use the masculine term but put ""madame"" in front of the term) and personal background and conscious decisions.  But I do think that often times English speakers (or others who dont speak grammatically gendered languages) tend to get overly fixated on the semantics. Generally but not always, grammatical gender is like the difference between ""a"" and ""an"" in English. They both mean the same thing, you just use one for certain nouns and the other for the rest (obviously not a perfect comparison since). Grammatical gender is most of the time like that. You use a particular article/adjective form/pronoun set instead another set because that's just the way it is done.  TL;DR: Yes, I agree. People debate over the use of grammatical gender forms when refering to people. But, most of the time grammatical gender is separate from semantics."

We also read Sag and Wasow's Syntactic Theory which was an introduction to HPSG, a competing Generative framework, but that is probably also very much out of date by now. However, I feel that a lot of misunderstandings about Generative Grammar comes from reading just textbooks and not understanding that obviously things are simplified, data that complicate the analysis are left out, and controversies are glossed over. For instance, Haegeman's first example is the pro-drop parameter, which explains a range of differences between Italian, a pro-drop language, and English, a non-pro-drop language. However, what she left out is that not every language falls within these two categories, for instance, Hebrew has pro-drop in some cases but not in others. Generative linguists know these problems, and some  have come up with solutions to these problems, others have criticized these solutions,  and so on. This is all glossed over by Haegeman, and linguists who are not familiar with the discussion because they aren't generative linguists but who are familiar with Hebrew might read Haegeman and think that Generative Linguists have all these grand theories without looking at languages such as Hebrew when that is not the case."

Another thing that's important to note is that as we try to be more precise with our theories (say, accounting for Principle C effects, or being able to explain what's happening when a certain question can't be formed with question words having such and such scope), we'll necessarily get farther away from the intuitive notions we have about our object of study and our ontology will get more complex.

linguistics,3c1x54,KeisariFLANAGAN,7,Sun Jul 5 21:35:36 2015 UTC,"He compared 2,274 words between both languages and found similarities in 70% of them.   Too bad there's a lot more to linguistic relatedness than just 'similarities' among words.   is that the Basque language originated from Dogon   From Dogon or from a common ancestor of Dogon? This is like saying English originated from German.   He decided to research applying scientific criteria, because the resemblance “couldn’t be coincidence”   Despite the fact that there are quite a few coincidences like this among the languages of the world?   On linguistic structures, Dogon and Basque concur in sentence placement order, with the subject at the beginning, the verb at the end – which is the biggest difference from Romance languages – and the direct object in the middle.   So they're SOV. Guess what? So are approximately 45% of the languages we know about. What makes this special about Basque and Dogon, instead of, say, Basque and Japanese? Very light topological correspondence... still not proof.    found 1,633 similar pair, which represents 70% of the total.   How does he determine 'similar pair'?   According to the author, comparative linguistics from a %50 of similarity one can talk about a relationship between two languages.   Perhaps if there's regular sound changes. Not just if two words look alike.   Ten examples of almost identical words: bede/bide (path in Dogon and Basque, respectively); soro/soro (agricultural land); beri/bero (hot); gara/garai (high); bana/banandu (to separate); gogoro/gogortu (to hold on); kwiye/kuia (pumpkin); pipilu/pipil (bud); togi/toki (place); kose/gose (hunger).   Are these pronounced the same? There's no IPA, so for all we know he honestly coulda just looked at spelling.   Also Mbabaram has a word, <dog> that means, well, ""dog"". But it's not related to English at all. Coincidences like this aren't all that uncommon...   He also found Basque words made up of two Dogon terms, such as “senide” (brother), which is “sani de” in Dogon.    Now he's just grasping at straws to try and find similarities.    Furthermore, he noticed that most of the words were older in Dogon that in Basque.    Uh, what? How can one language have 'older' words?   All that has taken him to the conclusion that the Basque language originates from Dogon.   So, a few similarities in words? That's literally all his evidence, and he can now claim Basque originates from Dogon. Of course, Dogon, not a common ancestor...   He is not the first comparing Basque with other languages; as Martin points out, Koldo Mitxelena – the most famous Basque linguist – denied the correlation between Basque with African languages.   And I dare say he was right, at least with our current methods.   Tovar only found up to 7% of similitude with Berber, very little, but pointed out how similar Basque sentence structure was to other languages.   Well, shit. 45% of languages are SOV. Of course it's  going to be similar.    Jaime Martín contacted the Basque language awareness service at the University of the Basque Country and Auñamendi publishing house to present his work, but was unsuccessful. “It hurts me to say they didn’t get back to me”.   He has literally no evidence. Just a bunch of comparisons of words.   Now, he plans to get in touch with Euskaltzaindia or interested philologists because Martín claims he tried to carry out a rigorous linguistic investigation, with no preconceptions, and that he “has no problem” corroborating it.   But he didn't. He just compared the (modern) form of a few (and some of them not all that common!) words, and said ""Hey, these look alike"" (who even knows if they sound alike!) and posited a relationship. That's not how this thing works...    TL;DR: Man claims relationship because some words look alike, and the languages are SOV. Claims Dogon has 'older' words and is the parent of Basque. Methodology is wack."

Don't believe everything you read about distant language relationships; there are a lot of people doing shoddy work, using methodologies that lead to a lot of false positives. Historical linguistics is still dealing with a legacy of less-than-ideal practices. It's getting better now, but you will still come across stuff that appears to be credible (e.g. published by someone with an academic position), but is not. It is really better to look to peer-reviewed academic articles in reputable journals.  This particular argument - that Basque is related to Dogon - doesn't hold water. The work is based on finding ""similarities"" between words, not reliable correspondences, and does not control for chance or contact. This is the same type of methodology that people like Ruhlen use to try to establish Proto-World. Basically, you find what you want. I could ""prove"" that English is related to Japanese using the same.  (As a side note, ""the languages of Mali"" belong to multiple families. Dogon is one language family of Mali, and not even the one with the most speakers.)"

Whereas pretty much every linguist would agree which languages are Proto-Indo-European and even which are most closely related, you could speak to a dozen Nostraticists and get twelve different answers.    Indo-Uralic is a more specific proposal, but as with Nostratic there is simply not enough evidence to come to a conclusion."

Does that make sense? The fact that Proto-Indo-European is the first node on the tree means that it's the limit at which we have any conclusive evidence for relations to other languages; its own origins and possible sister languages are unknown."
linguistics,3c1x54,tripwire7,2,Sat Jul 4 12:18:23 2015 UTC,"Language probably didn't arise as one thing either.   As animals speciate generally the process is very gradual, and critically, almost transparent at the individual level. Biological evolution is study of allele frequencies in populations over time. And because it's the relative differences in alleles across populations that make the species, it's never the case that suddenly from, say, non-elephants the first elephants male and female are born. Instead what happens is a population of Proboscidea emerges from another population of Proboscidea, and over time the allele frequencies change such that the emergent population can no longer reproduce with the cousin-population.  My point is - this is probably also true of languages. It's more likely that the first languages emerged from a population of unrelated or distantly related proto-languages.   It's also worth noting that PIE is sort of the same thing, 45000 years later - there was never a language corresponding to PIE, but rather a dialect continuum (population) united by mutual intelligibility and common features (roughly corresponding to alleles)."

linguistics,3c1x54,100dylan99,5,Sat Jul 4 02:29:49 2015 UTC,"Well, it was when the original languages spoken back tens if not hundreds of thousands of years ago emerged. But this was several orders of magnitude between us and PIE and us and the speakers of those - since then everything's become so mixed we can't tell if anything from the original sets of languages remains in ours.  Think of it like dropping a drop of food coloring in a glass of water - at first you see shapes of the coloring bending and taking different paths in the fluid. But after some time it becomes so mixed that you can't tell where a sample of the coloring was a second ago - that's a problem linguistics has to deal with, and with the methods we have we can only reconstruct up to about 10K years ago, because of how mixed languages are. For comparison, we're talking about languages spoken anywhere from 50K to 200K years ago, much much farther back in time, before modern humans ever even left Africa.  Just a sort of illustration, this is a sample of English 1K years ago: ""Hwæt! We Gar-Dena, in geardagum, þeodcyninga, þrym gefrunon, hu þa æðelingas ellen fremedon.""  Imagine that difference x6 and you have an idea of the amount of change that occur just from PIE to English. Imagine that difference x50 and you get the difference between English and the languages of the exodus from Africa. Imagine that difference x200 and you get an idea of what languages were like when anatomically modern homo sapiens emerged.  I don't think so much as a single morpheme is left of the original languages. When it comes to the Afroasiatic, Indo-European, or Sino-Tibetan language families, each of them arose as populations within wider unattested but diverse linguistic environments, it's just the information about their neighbors, ancestral populations, and unsuccessful or unattested cousins information lies beyond the threshhold of what we can reconstruct. The water's too mixed already."

Whoever would espouse such a view is saying nothing more than speculation. We don't know if Homo sapiens neanderthalensis had language or not. All we know is that based on their anatomy they could theoretically make every sound that Homo sapiens sapiens can make (they had a lowered hyoid bone as well), and that they also had the two mutations in their foxp2 gene in the 7th chromosome that Homo sapiens sapiens have. So we have no reason yet to say that they didn't have language, and no reason yet to say that they couldn't have had the potential to have language, however, we also have no proof that they did, so it remains a unanswered and unanswerable question."

Unlike, say, Eskimo-Aleut, where we have two groups of languages which go back to a common ancestor (Inuit-Yupik  or ""Eskimo"" on the one hand, Aleut on the other), this isn't really the case for the ""European"" portion of the Indo-European languages.  The ""Indo-"" portion could certainly be thought of as the Indo-Iranian subgroup, but the ""European"" portion doesn't really correspond do any language grouping. Instead, it's better to think of these as geographical groupings. The modern languages span (""indigenously"") from Europe to South Asia.  A better linguistic division might be something like Anatolian-All Others, as really only the Anatolian languages (Hittite, Luwian, etc.) are distinct enough early enough to talk about separate groupings like you seem to be implying.  But I think really, the top level daughters of PIE, with few exceptions, probably just slowly globed off from one another, and you're not going to get nice tree-like division as you might expect."

Slightly different question; would the Greeks and Persians (coming into contact/conflict relatively soon after the IE expansion) have thought of themselves as at all similar? what about to the Armenians or other IE peoples in the middle, like Kurds (were they around then? or did they ""evolve"" after the classical/age of antiquity?)"

linguistics,3c2rzo,adlerchen,2,Sat Jul 4 13:53:44 2015 UTC,That would be the late satem split hypothesis right?
linguistics,3c2rzo,TrigintaSeptem,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Most indoeuropeanists agree that the first two branches of IE to split off were Anatolian and Tocharian. Before the Anatolian split, the language was apparently much different, in at least morphology, from the ""PIE"" most often reconstructed. After the split, the verbal (and to a lesser extent the nominal) systems began going through a set of large changes. Based on the stages of this change exhibited by the earliest attestations of each other branch, we can make some assumptions about the relative order of their splits from the main group. A summary of changes in the verbal conjugation system can be found here.  But anyways, the stage of PIE represented by most reconstructions is what Donald Ringe has termed ""West IE"". It's important to understand that this wasn't necessarily one proto-language, but a collection of closely-related dialects; already in West IE there were likely differences in vocabulary and pronunciation comparable to those we see between dialects of modern English.  Proto-Germanic, Proto-Indo-Iranian (the ""I part""), and the other daughter languages are simply the result of the spread of and eventual loss of contact between these original dialects (and are themselves more accurately described as dialect groups rather than protolanguages). While some closer relations between these branches have been proposed (Ringe suggests that an Italo-Celtic clade split off third, leaving a general grouping of everything else, which he calls ""Central IE""), all that can be said for sure is that while still probably mutually intelligible, they underwent a set of common changes, in sometimes very different orders, and then likely just ""slowly globed off from one another"", as limetom put it.  So, TL;DR: pre-Proto-everything-that-isn't-Indo-Iranian was nearly identical to pre-Proto-Indo-Iranian anyways, and most reconstructions of ""PIE"" end up describing this language very well already, except maybe in the case of phonology, where they try to show distinctions (namely, that between the three laryngeal consonants) probably lost very quickly in West IE."

linguistics,3c1bpe,JamesTreddit,6,Fri Jul 3 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"Lancashire accents in and around Liverpool from a few generations ago would've been rhotic too. They still are in the top half of the historic county. As such it's unlikely that Liverpool English wasn't rhotic at one point. Whether that changed before the Irish influence or after isn't so certain. The big influx of Irish immigration in the 19th century coincides with roughly the same time period rhoticity is receding from the urban North West.   Anyway, loss of rhoticity was/is part of the general trend sweeping across England in the last couple of centuries. Being an urban centre might've accelerated the importation of non-rhotic speech relative to surrounding smaller settlements. A survey from the 50s shows rhoticity preserved in rural accents in Merseyside, although my guess (and it is a guess) would be those samples were closer in character to rural Lancashire than Scouse."
linguistics,3c066h,mamashaq,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"Abstract  In American Sign Language (ASL), conjunction (‘and’) and disjunction (‘or’) are often conveyed by the same general use coordinator (transcribed as “COORD”). So the sequence of signs MARY WANT TEA COORD COFFEE can be interpreted as ‘Mary wants tea or coffee’ or ‘Mary wants tea and coffee’ depending on contextual, prosodic, or other lexical cues. This paper takes the first steps in describing the syntax and semantics of two general use coordinators in ASL, finding that they have a similar syntactic distribution to English coordinators and and or. Semantically, arguments are made against an ambiguity approach to account for the conjunctive and disjunctive readings; instead, I propose a Hamblin-style alternative semantics where the disjunctive and conjunctive force comes from external quantification over a set of alternatives. The pragmatic consequences of using only a prosodic distinction between disjunction from conjunction is examined via a felicity judgement study of scalar implicatures. Results indicate decreased scalar implicatures when COORD is used as disjunction, supporting the semantic analysis and suggesting that the contrast of lexical items in the <and, or> scale plays an important role in its pragmatics. Extensions to other languages with potential general use coordination are discussed.  Keywords  conjunction; disjunction; experimental pragmatics; coordination; sign languages; external quantification; alternatives; scalar implicatures"

I'm going to buy that book, but I couldnt find a preview on google books or amazon to just read a bit. Any help in that regard?   I found this book online, the 'Longman Dictionary of Language Teaching and Applied Linguistics' - how does that look ?  Does Trask's book really make things clear ? For example when I look up 'conjugation' in the Longman text, the definition is :  ""a class of verbs which follow the same pattern for changes in TENSE, PERSON, or NUMBER. For example, in French there are four regular conjugations as well as irregular verbs. The verbs donner “to give”, parler “to speak”, chercher “to look for”, etc., are described as belonging to the -er (or 1st) conjugation.""  And that just made me more confused. I realize this may be because to understand and apply linguistic terms one needs to have a basic familiarity (and you can't build on nothing) - so advice and a 'gentle learning curve' would be greatly helpful.

Do you consult the user guide at the beginning of the book that explains the layout and structure of entries? Do you know how to follow cross-references?

By ""this text"", I assume you mean the Longman book, and as I said, I think you need a dictionary of linguistics, not of language teaching.

linguistics,3bz9on,paolog,2,Fri Jul 3 10:29:57 2015 UTC,"First, keep in mind that not all varieties of English have the same kinds of dictionaries made for them. As far as I'm aware, only the UK, the US, Canada, and Australia have their own 'complete' monolingual dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that seek to define not only the regionalisms of a territory, but also the other pan-regional lexemes of a language. I'm in the process of trying to change this fact in the Caribbean, but it will certainly not happen in the next couple of years. In any event, you won't be comparing like with like, so you won't find cash in every dictionary (and not in the Caribbean ones-- I checked!).  That being said, each dictionary has its own practice.    The Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage, which covers 18 English-official territories of the Caribbean area (including Belize, Guyana, Bermuda, and the Bahamas, any of which are sometimes excluded from definitions of the Caribbean), is not necessarily consistent, but seems to follow the same practice as the  Dictionary of Jamaican English, which is to put pronunciations only when the pronunciation diverges from RP.  The Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English marks all its headwords for pronunciation and seems to use the Australian vowels from what I can tell, and adopts non-rhotic pronunciation such that pat and part differ only in vowel quality.  The Dictionary of New Zealand English mainly just gives pronunciations of loanwords, but following the NZ pronunciation guide in the front matter.  In A Dictionary of South African English, they aim for the speech of educated South Africans whose home language is English, but there is great diversity in this group, including people descended from Dutch settlers as well as 'people descended from Indian labourers, and it seems that they use the IPA of whatever that group's vowels would be.  In the Dictionary of English/Creole of Trinidad & Tobago, only pronunciations are given for non-English-origin words, and the rest are assumed to follow the pronunciation guide in the front matter.  Finally in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, pronunciations seem to be given only for words with unpredictable pronunciations as well, and the symbols are explained at the bottom of each page, indicating at the very least an acceptance of nasal vowels (not nasalized vowels, though) and Canadian Raising.   I'd need much more time to actually survey these dictionaries carefully to see how well they do with pronunciations, and would probably need an expert in World Englishes, which is definitely not my specialty. But I have all these dictionaries I mentioned in my office, plus the Dictionary of Bahamian English which is being used by my secretary at the moment, so if you have specific questions, I might be able to answer."

Here is the blurb:   This book presents the first cross-linguistic study of the phenomenon of infixation, typically associated in English with words like ""im-bloody-possible"", and found in all the world's major linguistic families. Infixation is a central puzzle in prosodic morphology: Professor Yu explores its prosodic, phonological, and morphological characteristics, considers its diverse functions, and formulates a general theory to explain the rules and constraints by which it is governed. He examines 154 infixation patterns from over a hundred languages, including examples from Asia, Europe, Africa, New Guinea, and South America. He compares the formal properties of different kinds of infix, explores the range of diachronic pathways that lead to them, and considers the processes by which they are acquired in first language learning. A central argument of the book concerns the idea that the typological tendencies of language may be traced back to its origins and to the mechanisms of language transmission. The book thus combines the history of infixation with an exploration of the role diachronic and functional factors play in synchronic argumentation: it is an exemplary instance of the holistic approach to linguistic explanation. Alan Yu's pioneering study will interest phonologists and morphologists of all theoretical persuasions, as well as typologists and historical linguists."

It's not infixation, because the affix is not placed inside a stem. It's also possible to place an expletive in the middle of a sentence, but since most Mandarin syllables are either standalone (though bound) morphemes or capable of being used as shorthand for multisyllabic morphemes, it's hard to argue infixation.  This sample fragment of a sentence pulled from a blog via Google:  如果.你.他媽的.每.天.都.加班  if.you.eff.every.day.even.work overtime  'If you frigging work overtime every day'  In this case, an expletive splits a sentence, but it still doesn't cut into the middle of a morpheme.  If I try to construct a sentence and place the expletive in the middle of a polysyllabic morpheme, it sounds wrong.  他媽的.蟑螂  'F***ing cockroach'  *蟑-他媽的-螂  'Cock-f***ing-roach'  Second one would be an example of expletive infixation, but it's ungrammatical in my judgement.  However, if I place the expletive in the middle of a polymorphemic polysyllabic word, it sounds okay to me. Both of the following sound acceptable to me.  他媽的.誤會  'F***ing misunderstanding'  誤-他媽的-會  'Mis-f***ing-understanding'  One could perhaps consider the final example a kind of tmesis or expletive infixation."

It says right there in the article, ""American Theater Standard is similar to English Received Pronunciation (RP).

In concrete terms, American Theater Standard is non-rhotic, and General American is solidly rhotic, as are the overwhelming majority of Americans.

Though more importantly, it is what I was taught, and it is what most every other acting friend I have was taught as well.

There are languages with mutually unintelligible dialects, such as German, Hindustani, and Arabic. There are pairs of languages that are considered separate but are highly mutually intelligible, such as Norwegian and Danish. There are creole languages that are difficult to separate from their vocabulary base, and form a continuum across social strata, such as Singlish. There are languages inconsistently classified as dialects or separate languages, such as Serbo-Croato-Bosnian or whatever it's called these days, or the entire family of Chinese languages. There are language families that form a really neat but really wide dialect continuum, subsets of which we treat as different languages, such as the family of Inuit languages.  Language-ness is very relative. This makes it hard to create diagrams based on them, because we're not sure whether we need to write just ""Arabic"" or also write ""Moroccan Arabic"", ""Egyptian Arabic"", and ""Lebanese Arabic"". As an example here, people disagree with whoever made the above diagram's segmentation of the Chinese languages (namely, none at all). There are ways to get around this, such as dividing up the population into units of 1 million people or so and coloring them so that more differently-colored units can understand each other less well, or using your own semi-arbitrary divisions but indicating homogeneity on them somehow, but it's not a great position to be in, trying to diagram it."

linguistics,3bqjg7,watwat,6,Thu Jul 2 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on which variety is compared to which. The general gradience goes from north to south. Varieties that are spoken farther away from each other become increasingly less intelligible. Allemanic, especially Swiss German, is not mutually intelligible with Plattdeutsch. Other northern Germanic varieties like the Frisian languages and Dutch are officially considered different languages from Standard German, which is essentially based on the central high germanic Saxon and East Franconian spoken in the area around where Luther wrote his translation of the bible. But the other low germanic varieties in the north like Plattdeutsch are not really intelligible with Standard German or any other high germanic variety. Neither are the Austro-Bavarian varieties that intelligible with Standard German. Basically, central high germanic varieties are the most intelligible with Standard German, but southern high germanic varieties are more intelligible with Standard German than low germanic varieties, except for maybe certain Alemanic varieties spoken in Switzerland which are especially less mutually intelligible.   If you speak German, I'd suggest taking a look at Boasch 2002 - Die deutsche Sprache – eine Dialektlandschaft."

A speaker of any Low German dialect (here including Dutch and Afrikaans) will get many though not all Low German varieties but High German is unintelligible. Same applies the other way around. And even then within those two groups diversity is way to high to actually understand everyone.   For an idea, listen to 'die heuwels fantasties - leja', 'skik - op fietse', 'eefje de visser - de stad' and 'het zesde metaal - ploegsteert'. These are all Dutch, but most speakers of standard dutch will only understand the text of one of these songs, depending on the region they are from. (Another song 'Droemvlucht - Nynke Laverman' showcases both a dialect of Low German and Frisian sung in duet, really awesome, again neither is intelligible to a speaker of standard dutch).

Even Limburgish has quite a few High German characteristics."

linguistics,3bqjg7,folran,2,Thu Jul 2 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I know it doesn't validate my opinion, but speaking a fair bit of Limburgish I don't agree. While the isogloss you're after does make it more High German it still hasn't participated in much of the High German consonant shift, as t-/->s and f-/->b for the most part.  But being a layman, why do you feel that is the determining isogloss? As subjectively Limburgish is more like Dutch in everything but that isogloss, so I wonder where your reasoning comes from?"
linguistics,3bqjg7,Brotten,2,Thu Jul 2 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"My opinion is simply that anything that has participated in any stage of the High German shift is High German. Because that's mainly what the ""German"" dialects have in common, really, otherwise they can differ quite notably. So instead of saying: ""You have to have participated in so and so many steps to be High German"", I just go the full way, if you will, since if you want to draw the line somewhere in between, one spot within the fan is as good as any other. There are some variants which are separated by an isogloss of the consonant shift but otherwise do not differ at all, so the consonant shift in itself is not useful to make a statement about the difference or similarity of dialects anyway. It seems to me that something like that might be true for Limburgish and outer Ripuarian, but I know very little about Limburgish. (And yes, I'm aware that calling Limburgish 'German' is politically difficult, but it's called the High German shift, and I didn't make these terms up. shrug I'd've gone with 'southern West Germanic' or something.) As for the demarkation of Low German, the Benrath line simply is identical with the border of dialects descending from Old Saxon and those descending from some sort of German or Low Franconian. The real trouble is drawing a definitive line between Low German from Low Franconian, since there barely are any features which only appear in one of them. ps.: Most of High German has -b- > [v] and western High German also has -b > [f]."

And yes I disagree. They are way too indescrete (undescrete?) to be accurately represented in a graphic. The concept of ""a language"" as an entity is totally human-made and not even present in all cultures. Languages are made up of the idiolects of its speakers and the way they use them in colmunication with others. These idiolects are ever-changing, both on the long (speaker-internal language change) and the short term (short term accomodation, change of register/variety/whatever). I don't think a mass of partially not necessarily mutually intelligible idiolects, of which no two are completely identical, and who constantly change depending on what other idiolects the host comes into contact with, is concrete and palpable enough to accurately be reduced and represented in a simple graphic."

We don't have Japanologists wondering whether the native dialect of Cairo working class is or is not within their scope, because languages are so fuzzy. When dealing with languages, one should be just as able to see all the fine details, interactions, and transitions as one should be able to accept a certain blur in order to be properly able to talk about a subject. People ask about languages on this very forum every day and when someone comes and asks you if Finnish has vowel harmony, I'd bet you (personally) would not tell them ""there is no Finnish, only a mass of millions of idiolects riding on reindeer"" either."

It could be seen as ""invasive"" in the same way that you view Arabic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. If you go back far enough, presumably no language is really native to the area it is spoken in, and the Indo-European language that we're currently exchanging messages in is no exception. Indo-European wasn't originally spoken in America where I live, and it wasn't originally spoken in Europe proper. Geographical borders are abstractions we use to categorize chunks of the surface of the earth. Borders don't really exist in the real world, they only exist on maps and in people's conception of the world. They're not a good objective basis for determining what is rightfully where it is or not, especially because that sense of rightfulness is another nonobjective culturally informed metric."

For example: in the Hasidic Jewish section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Yiddish is the language of the community and it's the one children grow up speaking, only (possibly) learning English later in life. If you tried to speak to a Hasidic boy under the age of 10 he most likely would not speak any English, even though he was born in the USA to parents who were born in the USA. And he if stays Hasidic, Yiddish will be the first language of his children. Interestingly enough, young girls learn English much earlier than the boys do. I'm not sure why that is though for sure, but it may have something to do with gender roles in the Hasidic community."

linguistics,3bomzb,tripwire7,3,Fri Jul 3 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"Some have theorized that it could be classified as a derivative of Hindi, however this is not the majority view. Most view it as a close sister language to Hindi, but some classify it as a Northern Indian rather than a Central Indian language because it also shares many Northern features, notably in places such as the numerals and basic grammatical endings. It also has many similarities to Northwest Indian languages as well as Iranian languages like Persian, giving Romani an unusual apparent blend of Indo-Aryan features, in addition to certain sound changes like /d/ > /l/ in some roots like /pʰral/ brother (c.f. Hindi भाई bhā'ī, Sanskrit भ्रातृ bhrātr, PIE *bʰrā́ter, Eng. brother [and also the English loanword pal]).  It has indeed been conjectured that Romani could have emerged as a sort of creole or at least featurally-mixed offspring of both Central and Northern Indian languages (and possibly Northwest as well), and others place it into a group of its own because it shares so many features with so many other subfamilies, similar to Albanian (which shares significant numbers of features with the Germanic, Balto-Slavic, and Greek-Armenian branches in addition to being part of the Balkan Sprachraum and thus does not cleanly fit into any category but its own)."
linguistics,3bomzb,jesushlincoln,0,Fri Jul 3 03:03:21 2015 UTC,I guess the question of whether the Romani language was created due to the migration out of India or if it represents a mass movement of a pre-existing separate people remains unanswered then.

You could expand this to n generations if there was some sort of rule of thumb for how many generations a language remains mutually intelligible.

The Incas practiced a system of forced relocation, Mitma, aimed at destroying cultures and languages and replacing them with the Quechua culture of the heartland. In fact, that's why Quechua is so succesful today. Without this system you'd likely see a patchwork of different languages across the current range of modern Quechua, or perhaps, without the same linguistic and cultural unity, many more monolingual Spanish speakers. I wouldn't be surprised if a few smaller languages ended up being totally replaced by Quechua in their core region while this was in practice, any surviving speakers dispersed across the Incan frontiers in small family units and communities.  Also, while the Spanish certainly treated natives better than the U.S. and English colonies of the north, that's not a high standard to be held up to. Quechua was banned for a time in Spanish Peru following a rebellion, and they were quite zealous when it came to religious conversion. What prevented the same sort of genocide and cultural destruction in Mexico, Central America and the Andes as in North America was the larger native population after European diseases, the smaller amount of colonists, and the early mixing of native and European blood."

The modern Maya language family encompasses more than thirty separate languages; many are spoken today, but not in the same locale in which they were spoken pre-contact. This is not due to imperial relocation such as was practiced in the Inca empire, but rather due to a wide variety of practices since contact which have moved indigenous populations from one type of settlement to another.  The scale is not the same; we're not talking about speakers living on a separate continent from that of their ancestors.

I also have an excellent relationship with my future advisor. In fact, I am working in his lab for the summer.  The thing is: he is gone until the end of July. Then, we'll attend ICPhS. In the meantime, I am working on a project on consonants.  The amount of literature to read is frightening me, especially since I don't always understand it. I am alone in the lab and the project is quite exploratory, my advisor being specialized in vowels and sociophonetics. As a result, I am reading through complex spectrum analysis books and math formulas that I do not understand, not having a background in that.  I am starting to panick and to think a masters is really going to be too hard for me, despite what everyone seems to believe. Is that a common feeling or am I just realizing that I have reached my maximum level of study?  tl;dr: Good relationship with advisor, successful undergraduate until today, not feeling adequate for higher studies despite general opinion.

I have been labeled a, ""heritage"" speaker, because I heard and spoke Spanish extensively in my childhood.

Something that I have noticed is favoring technical, ""big"" (you can have fun trying to define that), scientific, or specialist words from English.

""Wegen den..."" is either uniformly correct (dialects) or uniformly wrong (standards). It is conceivable that some regiolect might have consistently used the dialectal phrase in its formal language for just this very one case, but if that ever was the case...I've never heard of it.

linguistics,3bi8ac,keyilan,5,Tue Jun 30 06:39:59 2015 UTC,"Just listened to the /r/AskHistorians podcast on language policy in East Asia, which was fantastic   Hey thanks!   I'm curious as to what changes were made by regulatory bodies and how much they impacted the speech of Mandarin speakers.  Was there a sort of process of selecting specific phonological, grammatical, or lexical features?   Kinda. One of the important aspects of the history of change in Mandarin over the years, especially since the fall of the Qing and the various social movements in the following decades, is that a lot of things happened on a more grassroots level initially, and a good number of the changes were made by consensus rather than government-issued guidelines.  For example there's considerable influence from the early vernacular writers such as Lu Xun and Hu Shih where it was their choices of grammatical structure that pushed written Mandarin in the direction that it's gone, which has of course also had influences on the spoken language.  As for phonological choices, I may have mentioned this in the podcast but in the early 19-teens when the first official ""pronunciation"" dialect was being developed, there was a significant attempt to have the national standard accommodate various other Sinitic varieties. The decisions were made by committee, and generally amicably. However this new standard didn't work out well and was scrapped by the 1930s.  As for whether or not Classical Chinese counts as an artificial language, this is really a matter of how you draw the distinctions. There is not one Classical Chinese but rather many, separated both in time and geography. The Classical Chinese written by the Ryukyus wouldn't necessarily be the same as that written by the Chinese of the same time period, and then from period to period we also see changes, though some of these can be written off as stylistic. Still, some can't, and there were semantic shifts going on where words started to have slightly different meanings from one period to another. 戎 rong was used around 50BCE to refer to barbarians in the west, but two hundred years later we find texts using it to mean things like ""military matters (as just one example).  Still, you could say that it's artificial in that any liturgical language is not a natural living language by it's very nature of being liturgical. And of course the claim is even easier to make if we're talking about places like Japan or Ryukyu or Korea where it was a 'liturgical' language foreign origins.  Hope that helps. Let me know if you have follow up questions."

So Standard Chinese is based on Mandarin, specifically the Beijing dialect. You mentioned in the podcast that Mandarin was already the most common language, and that Cantonese was never in the running as the state language. Do we have any sources on how many people spoke Mandarin as opposed to other Sinitic languages? Apparently Nanjing Mandarin was most prominent, at one point, and Beijing came to dominate over time, but Mandarin in any form was still the dominant language (at least post-Middle Chinese)?   When modern students (native Chinese or laowai) learn Classical Chinese or Literary Chinese, which form of the language do they learn? Does it depend on what period they're studying? To be honest, I thought Literary Chinese was fairly consistent throughout history because people based their writing on the Ruist classics. Is it somewhat accurate to say that Classical/Literary Chinese was initially closer to some vernacular speech, and that it stayed relatively consistent while vernacular speech changed immensely?"
linguistics,3bi8ac,keyilan,3,Thu Jul 2 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"Do we have any sources on how many people spoke Mandarin as opposed to other Sinitic languages?   Not exactly. The numbers for population in the various regions exist, but to my knowledge it's not all collected in one accessible location where we could then make some assumptions about what people spoke based on where they were.  We do know that Mandarin was the court language going back quite some time, so that even someone from the far south who wanted a government job would have had to learn Nanjing Mandarin. Point being that even if the numbers weren't drastically in Mandarin's favour based on regional populations, the scales were still heavily tipped in that direction just based on the history of China's lingue franche.   Apparently Nanjing Mandarin was most prominent, at one point, and Beijing came to dominate over time, but Mandarin in any form was still the dominant language (at least post-Middle Chinese)?   Nanjing was for quite some time even after Nanjing had stopped being the capital. I wrote about this in more detail over at AskHistorians so I'll skip repeating myself here. But yeah you can safely say that Mandarin was the prestige variety at least since the 14th century.   When modern students (native Chinese or laowai) learn Classical Chinese or Literary Chinese, which form of the language do they learn?   Usually they learn it more generally, covering a range of variation. Books will include examples from throughout the classics, so they just end up learning the different meanings a word can have. I've got in front of me (coincidentally since I just happened to be at this office today) four books on Classical Chinese. One is a textbook for foreigners (Paul Rouzer's), one is a reader from the early 1980s that's aimed at foreigners but published domestically in China, ones a reader for Chinese speakers (explanation etc in Mandarin) and one's a grammar text aimed at Chinese speakers. All four are pulling from a very wide range of time periods with their examples and texts.   To be honest, I thought Literary Chinese was fairly consistent throughout history because people based their writing on the Ruist classics.   This really just depends what your threshold is. It is mostly consistent if you're looking at the big picture. For example you wouldn't mistake two variations for being separate languages.   Is it somewhat accurate to say that Classical/Literary Chinese was initially closer to some vernacular speech, and that it stayed relatively consistent while vernacular speech changed immensely?   This we can't say. We don't know what the vernacular was that far back, so we really have no way of knowing. There are efforts to work out Proto-Sinotibetan syntax and the like, and if that's successful then we'd have a good idea. But for the time being we just have no way of knowing if Classical Chinese was once in fact reflective of the spoken form."

linguistics,3bi8ac,marmulak,2,Thu Jul 2 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"OK I have one that I've been thinking about for a while.  In some languages there is a ""nominative sentence"" form where you can make a statement without a verb. You find this is such languages as Arabic, Turkish, and Russian. For example:  Я Мармулак (""I Marmulak"") = I am Marmulak  Compare to Polish: Ja jestem Marmulak  So here's the deal. Every single Indo-European language I know personally seems to have a rule that such sentences must contain the verb ""to be"". Of those I'm most familiar with, English, German, Persian, Spanish, and apparently Polish as well.  My question is this: Is it very unusual for an Indo-European language to have such a nominative sentence form like Russian? Is it natural to Russian, or did Russian acquire this feature from another language family like the Turkic languages, who seem to me to all possess this feature. Is Russian unique among Slavic languages to have this feature, or do its close relatives have it? I know Russian is East Slavic and Polish, which seems different in this regard, is West Slavic.  Furthermore, to what extent has Russian been influenced by Turkic languages? Russian is also the only IE language that I know of whose word for ""father"" (otets) appears to have a non-IE root. (It resembles the word for father in Turkic languages.)"

Turkish definitely can, though, and I say this as someone who's studied the language for a few years.   WALS cites Lewis (1967)'s grammar of Turkish in its claim that Turkish cannot have a null copula construction. However checking Lewis's grammar (at least the 2nd edition which I have), it clearly says it can:   -dir is placed in parentheses in the following table as a reminder that in Turkish (as in Arabic and Russian), simple' A is B' equivalences are expressed without a verb.  [...]  In ordinary speech -dir is not used in such simple 'A = B' sentences; one says kızım adı Fatma; enerji kaynaklanmız bol.  [...]  Otherwise, the use of -dir in informal speech is either for emphasis or, more often, to indicate a supposition. Whereas the written words belge kasa-da-dır mean 'the document is in the safe', the same words in informal speech mean 'the document is surely in the safe, must be in the safe', or, less commonly, a confident 'the document is in the safe'; only the tone of voice shows which of the two is intended. If the speaker is stating a simple fact, which he does not think it necessary to emphasize, he will say belge kasada.   You really can't trust everything WALS says at face value."

linguistics,3bi8ac,marmulak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Depending on the sentence, Turkish may or may not have a copula. To say that it's ""impossible"" to have zero copula is probably not technically correct."
linguistics,3bi8ac,mamashaq,3,Tue Jun 30 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"Always take WALS with some grains of salt, but you might be interested in feature (120: Zero copula for predicate nominals (map))  WALS says that a null copula in Polish is possible, citing:   Brooks, Maria Zagorska. 1975. Polish Reference Grammar. The Hague: Mouton.     Anyway, from Clancy (2010:91-92):   It is unclear why the zero copula is so prevalent in Russian, whereas the other Slavic languages all make use of the conjugated forms of ‘be’. The general tendency in R has been to reduce the forms of ‘be’ to a single form in contexts where ‘be’ is still expressed explicitly as a main verb (R est’ ‘(there) is’) and where it is used as an auxiliary in the conditional (R by ‘would’). The other tendency has been simply to eliminate the forms of ‘be’, as in most present tense copula sentences and in the expression of the past tense with no auxiliary verb (see 5.1.1.1 for auxiliary functions). Jakobson (1935/1971) suggests that the loss of the forms of ‘be’ is connected with the general loss of clitics in Russian. Just as the formerly enclitic reflexive R -sja directly to the verb, so it has lost its present tense forms of ‘be’, not only in the auxiliary use of the Old Russian present perfect, now the past tense, but also in the use of ‘be’ as a main verb. Some also suggest that Russian lost its copula forms due to language contact with Finno-Ugric groups (see 6.3). Since both the zero copula and the explicit forms of ‘be’ were available in Common Slavic, we might further suggest that the central Slavic languages generalized the copula expression with ‘be’, whereas the most peripheral Slavic language, Russian, failed to make this generalization, moving in the direction of a zero copula in most uses (with some transition between Russian and other East Slavic languages stretching into Polish speech territory). The use of the zero copula in Polish is interesting in light of Isačenko’s comments on Polish as a transitional language between the be-languages and have-languages of Europe (1974: 44). Is the use of a zero copula connected to the use of ‘be’ as have in Russian? The geographical contiguity of Polish to the East Slavic languages may have made it subject to the same developments regarding the use of the zero copula. Whereas most of the Slavic languages outside of Russian have regularized the expression of be and have verbally, Russian still utilizes a syntactic construction which juxtaposes two items in the copula and a have construction which makes use of a metaphorical understanding of the relationship between objects and their location. Perhaps Polish has been under the influence of these Russian constructions.  Polish has also demonstrated a partial loss of the forms of ‘be’. The present tense forms of ‘be’ underwent increased phonetic reduction to the point of becoming suffixed personal endings in the past tense (see 5.1.1.1). This phonetic reduction had consequences for the copula forms as well, leading to the reformation of ‘be’ with the stem of the 3sg form P jest- ‘is’ + the reduced forms of ‘be’ in the 1st and 2nd sg and pl forms: P 1sg jestem, 2sg jesteś; 1pl jesteśmy, 2pl jesteście, but the retention of the original forms 3sg jest and 3pl są. The loss of the 3rd person forms with the past tense could also be connected with the loss of the copula in P to ‘that’ expressions of be. Perhaps this reshuffling of ‘be’ regarding auxiliary and copula provides further evidence that the auxiliary uses were not considered entirely separate from the copula use, therefore the forms of ‘be’, whether auxiliary, copula, or verb of existence, were sufficiently linked to undergo the same phonetic developments. As Andersen (1987) argues, the 3sg form of ‘be’, P jest, had become an emphatic marker. Russian shows both loss of auxiliary and copula ‘be’ and Bulgarian has the same treatment of both main verb and auxiliary ‘be’ as sentential enclitics. Despite these different treatments of the explicit forms, all of the other languages besides Russian, and even Russian in some contexts, make use of an explicit copula, as discussed in the following section.   Maybe that quotation's of interest."
linguistics,3bi8ac,marmulak,2,Tue Jun 30 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"That is very interesting indeed, thanks!  Also the page you linked had some quotes of particular interest to me:   Regarding the distribution of zero copula encoding across the world’s languages, the first thing to be noted is that there appears to be no major linguistic area in which the use of a zero copula is completely excluded. However, the areal distribution of zero copula encoding is not completely random either. The map shows a number of linguistic areas in which zero copula encoding is highly conspicuous. In particular, a zero-strategy is used almost uniformly in the Pacific region (Australian, Papuan, and eastern Austronesian languages), and it is highly prominent in South America, as well as in the northern part of Africa. Opposed to this, we find areas in which a zero copula constitutes a minor or marginal option. This is the case in Europe and the Middle East (covering Indo-European, Semitic, Turkic, Caucasian, and Uralic languages), northern India and the Himalayas, sub-Saharan Africa, North and Central America, and East Asia (covering China, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines).   And especially:   It should be added that, quite often, the distribution of zero copulas within a language family or area is rather unpredictable. Languages which are closely related areally or genetically may differ considerably in the extent to which they allow zero encoding.   So it appears, this feature can occur randomly within any language family or area."

Perhaps children in different speech communities are, for whatever reason, cognizant of what features are salient of ""baby speak"" in that community are are actively able to utilize those features in an attempt to sound more helpless, innocent, or cute.  Maybe American media -- you do say you're basing your perception in part due to media -- more often uses these sorts of articulation disorders or cues of an early stage of phonological development as a shorthand to note a young child is meant to be adorable, cute, or if of an adult, is used as a way to signal the audience should think that the character is perhaps a bit of a dunce (cf Elmer Fudd).  Maybe you're listening to some speakers of Boston English or New York English whose dialects have labialization and you're associating it with it being childish speech since in many other dialects of American English it does mark an early stage of phonological development or a potential articulation disorder.  Perhaps you're just more aware of /r/-labialization having a connotation with childish speech, and maybe similar linguistic cues in other speech communities are less salient to you and go unnoticed.  I mean, it's really hard to even begin to answer why you might have this perception or if this perception has any basis in reality.

linguistics,3bi8ac,UnderwaterDialect,2,Sun Jul 5 06:46:13 2015 UTC,Is it true that irregular verbs tend to be 'older' than regular verbs on average? Can you point me to a citation?
linguistics,3bi8ac,normaltypetrainer,3,Mon Jun 29 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"No, not really. Well, it depends what you consider older.  Irregular verbs tend to follow older patterns that are no longer productive, i.e. new verbs are not formed on those patterns.   In English older forms are based on an ablaut system and the suffix -n: see - saw -seen. The newer pattern is -ed: google - googled - googled.  However does this make them older? Help used to have irregular forms based on ablaut: help - holp; but later was regularized to helped. So I think you can argue that ""helped"" is a newer form than, say, ""saw"" but help is still a verb right out of the Proto-Germanic.  Also some verbs gain new irregular forms via analogy:   strive - strived/strove - strived/striven; compare: drive - drove - driven.   Bring (compare sing): -brought/brang - brought/brung  Native speakers still coin new irregular forms sometimes: dranken; boughten; spatten, etc  These forms are newer and irregular.  tdrl: some irregular forms are older but that doesn't mean the verb isn't old just because it has regular conjugations.

I've only heard ""strong"" and ""weak"" used just in reference to the Germanic branch; not in reference to Indo-European as a hole.   Do you know how Proto-Indo-European verbs worked?  Quote from Fortson (2004) if you do:   15.23. Strong and weak verbs. Germanic verbs belong to two broad classes, termed strong and weak, according to how they make their past-tense forms (preterite and past participle). The distinction has its origin in PIE. Germanic (or pre-Germanic) verbs that could form perfects used the perfect as their past tense; these are the strong verbs. They show ablaut of the root in the formation of the tense-stems and form their past participles with the nasal suffix *-onó-. Strong verbs include most of the present-day ""irregular"" verbs like sing sang sung or German singen sang gesungen. By contrast, those verbs that did not form perfects (typically secondary verbs such as denominatives and causatives) developed an entirely new kind of past tense with an innovated suffix in *-d-. These are the weak verbs, and they typically do not ablaut. The great bulk of verbs in any Germanic language are weak (the ""regular"" verbs in today's grammar), such as Eng. settle settled settled or its German equivalent siedeln siedelte gesiedelt.   See also Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_weak_verb#Origins_of_the_weak_conjugation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb#Origin_and_development  If you're not referring to just Germanic when you refer to ""strong"" and ""weak"", you might want to make that clear."

See if there are perception studies which look at Nth generation Americans of East Asian descent and see if people can reliably guess their race / ethnicity. See if the same cues keep getting mentioned.  I'm not a sociolinguist, but I found this paper:  Newman & Wu (2011) ""Do you sound Asian when you speak English?"" Racial identification and voice in Chinese and Korean Americans' English"" American Speech 86(2):152-178.   In paired dialect identification tasks, differing only by speakers' sex, New Yorkers were asked to identify the race and national heritage of other New Yorkers. Each task included eight speakers: two Chinese Americans, two Korean Americans, two European Americans, a Latino, and an African American. Listeners were successful at above chance rates at identifying speakers' races, but not at differentiating the Chinese from Koreans. Acoustic analyses identified breathier voice as a factor separating the Asian Americans most frequently identified from the non-Asians and Asians least successfully identified. Also, the Chinese and Latino men's speech appeared more syllable timed than the others' speech. Finally, longer voice onset times for voiceless stops and lower /ε/s and /r/s were also to be implicated in making a speaker “sound Asian.” These results support extending the study of the robust U.S. tendency for linguistic differentiation by race to Asian Americans, although this differentiation does not rise to the level of a systematic racial dialect. Instead, it is suggested that it be characterized as an ethnolinguistic repertoire along the lines suggested by Sarah Bunin Benor.   Hanna (1997) Do I sound ""Asian"" to you?: Linguistic markers of Asian American identity. PWPL 4(2):141-153   The question remains, do I sound Asian to you? The preliminary data presented in this paper support the hypothesis that some Asian Americans have distinctive linguistic features that are reinforced by social interactions with the same ethnic group. The present study attempted to gather data from a wide range of Asian Americans to stimulate research into more specific features. The diversity of the sample group proved to make the process fairly complex, but was necessary to characterize such a heterogeneous group. One possible direction to explore is the study of a larger sample group of Asian Americans who associate primarily with other Asian Americans to look at their suprasegmental features. The present experiment was performed in Philadelphia; it would be of interest to perform a similar study on the West Coast, where there are a greater number of Asian American ethnic enclaves. A claim of one Taiwanese American female judge from Voorhees, New Jersey who spent a summer in Berkeley, California that ""[Asian Americans] speak totally different there"" supports such a prospect.    But! At the same time you have so many studies where people will perceive someone as speaking differently if they (think) know the speaker's of East Asian descent:  Rubin & Smith (1990) ""Effects of accent, ethnicity, and lecture topic on undergraduates' perceptions of nonnative English-speaking teaching assistants""   The most common response to perceived lack of English language proficiency among nonnative English speaking teaching assistants (NNSTAs), has been to set up workshops to remediate their linguistic and instructional skills. However many factors other than low levels of communication competence may contribute to negative perceptions of NNSTAs. Some of these factors may be more germane to North American undergraduate & stereotypical attitudes than to NNSTAs’ classroom talk. A matched guise study of undergraduates’ comprehension and attitudes toward NNSTAs revealed that 40% of undergraduates avoid NNSTA instructed classes. However, measured outcomes manifested few direct effects of actual accentedness in NNSTA speech. Instead, factors like instructor ethnicity and lecture topic, extraneous to actual NNSTA speaking proficiency, tended to be more potent determinants of undergraduate attitudes and comprehension. On the other hand, when students perceived- whether rightly or wrongly - high levels of foreign accentedness, they judged speakers to be poor teachers. Results warrant collective ‘university community” training programs that focus on undergraduate attitudes and listening skills as weI1 as on NNSTA competence.   Rubin (1992) ""Nonlanguage Factors Affecting Undergraduates' Judgments of Nonnative English-Speaking Teaching Assistants""   In response to dramatic changes in the demographics of graduate education, considerable effort is being devoted to training teaching assistants who are nonnative speakers of English (NNSTAs). Three studies extend earlier research that showed the potency of nonlanguage factors such as ethnicity in affecting undergraduates' reactions to NNSTAs. Study 1 examined effects of instructor ethnicity, even when the instructor's language was completely standard. Study 2 identified predictors of teacher ratings and listening comprehension from among several attitudinal and background variables. Study 3 was a pilot intervention effort in which undergraduates served as teaching coaches for NNSTAs. This intervention, however, exerted no detectable effect on undergraduates' attitudes. Taken together, these findings warrant that intercultural sensitization for undergraduates must complement skills training for NNSTAs, but that this sensitization will not accrue from any superficial intervention program.   Yi et al. (2013) ""Reduced efficiency of audiovisual integration for nonnative speech""   The role of visual cues in native listeners' perception of speech produced by nonnative speakers has not been extensively studied. Native perception of English sentences produced by native English and Korean speakers in audio-only and audiovisual conditions was examined. Korean speakers were rated as more accented in audiovisual than in the audio-only condition. Visual cues enhanced word intelligibility for native English speech but less so for Korean-accented speech. Reduced intelligibility of Korean-accented audiovisual speech was associated with implicit visual biases, suggesting that listener-related factors partially influence the efficiency of audiovisual integration for nonnative speech perception.   Babel & Russell (2015) ""Expectations, alignment, and speech intelligibility""   Listeners use information about a speaker’s identity to help parse the speech stream. While indexical cues are often beneficial in speech processing, this is not always the case. In this study, we show how expectations about what Chinese Canadians sound like reduces the intelligibility of sentences produced by Chinese Canadians who are native speakers of the local variety of English. We show this by comparing the intelligibility of Chinese Canadian and White Canadian voices in a face priming task. Our results indicate that Chinese Canadian voices are less intelligible only when listeners know they are listening to a Chinese Canadian."

Focusing on the Chinese and Italian communities, our analysis of two sociolinguistic variables shows that speakers may vary in overall rate, but linguistic conditioning remains largely constant across and within ethnic groups. While there is evidence for language transfer in the first generation, differences between generations suggest that transfer does not persist.

I've had similar inqueries in the past so through research and my own observation, I have found no specific Chinese Canadian dialect or any form of Chinese Canadian culture that exists separately from Chinese culture.  At this point in time, newcomers, especially oler adults, generally retain their customs, beliefs, and mannerisms from the old country.  Many of these older adults and first generation immigrants have learned english in China and so still have an accent in terms of pronunciation and grammatical errors. I would not call this a dialect since it does not follow its own set of rules.  Also, second generation immigrants (first generation Chinese Canadians) who may or may not speak Chinese at home will generally learn English and adopt Canadian culture more so than their parents.  You can go to /r/AsianParentStories for a first-hand account of what conflicts first generation Chinese Americans have with their parents.  I think over a few more generations we may see a regional dialect in populations where there is a high proportion of Chinese and Asian Canadians/Americans, such as in Richmond, BC where 50% of the population is Chinese and ethnic minorities are the majority at over 70% of the population.  However, nowadays there is no definable dialect or culture distinctive of the Vancouver Canadian community.  You mostly just see the  immigrants and the assimilated.

I am not sure how common this is for an academic review, but about 80 % of his review is his own case against Chomsky rather than a review of Christina Behme. One thing that I found weird, and I hope other people here can help me find out what his argument boils down to, because I don't think I will read the articles he quotes (many of them by himself), but at one point he argues that languages that haven't been in contact with western society differ from western language in the kind of logic they can decode. What does that mean? What are the logical things that they can't decode? And did those languages suddenly change when in contact with western society. I study a non-western language, Zulu, albeit one that has been in contact with western society for about 150 years, and I never felt that there was fundamentally something different about the semantics of Zulu. There are interesting things happening in the meanings of some quantifiers (my favorite thing is that the quantifier meaning ""other"" is the same as the one meaning ""some"", the thing they have in common in my opinion is that in both cases you are introducing an entity that hasn't been discussed before in the discourse, but I am not a semantician, so this analysis may be wrong) but nothing that makes it less easy or easier to model formally imho.

I disagreed with him, but to counter his arguments (which were reasonable) in my head I had to think about why I want to do linguistics the way that I do. In other words, that article made me a better linguist, an its arguments and my answers to them still inform the work I do today. But Sampson is not out to highlight where he differs from Chomsky and give his reasoning why, but rather it seems that he sees Chomsky and everything he stands for (and in Sampson's case that means almost anything he stands for, including Chomsky's politics) as a big wrong that needs to be righted, so he sets out to demolish him with all rhetorical means that he has.

A quote from Chomsky figured quite prominently and that quote was that you should assume that two languages are similar unless there is evidence that they are different. Haspelmath argued that that assumption made people biased towards certain analyses (such as one where there is a Noun-Verb distinction). I think however that it is a very healthy assumption; you assume that the world is simple unless there is evidence against that, and also with that assumption you can find ironically differences between languages that you may not have found otherwise, precisely  because you are expecting languages to be similar."

As for sign writing, it's more of a novelty. There are a couple different ones, showing that no one can agree on one fitting for the language (further more, they pertain to American Sign Language and I don't know if applicable to other signed languages, since some have handshapes not present in ASL (just like how some phonemes aren't present in English)).

As others in this thread have pointed out, signs are characterised by five main features ('phonetic elements'): hand shape, hand orientation, hand location, movement path and nonmanual components (facial expressions, mouthing etc.). The usual way to notate a sign is a series of symbols describing each one of these components for both hands (if both are needed). In most sign languages, there are lots of additional components, such as performance speed, and their notation varies among systems.  Of course, since it's rather cumbersome, such 'phonetic' notation is only used scientifically. Everyday transcription and dictionaries usually make use of lexical glosses (along the lines of HOUSE IX(a) MY BIG_inanimate)."

People who actually know what they are talking about, please chime in!!   In phonology, phonemes are defined by some group of features. So for example, /o/ is [+syllabic], [-low], [-high], [+round], etc etc. Sign language phonology proceeds much the same way, except the features are different. IIRC the features are handshape, orientation, movement, and location, but there might be more.

I guess that's because the mouth isn't capable of making subtle movements like our hands and arms can. For example, openness has four categories (open, mid-open, mid-close, close) because the mouth can make subtle differences in openness (which are used to distinguish phoneemes and hence meanings). On the other hand, as for roundedness, you either round your lips or don't. There are no phonemes that are pronounced with, say, half-rounded lips or something because it's anatomically impossible for humans to round some parts of the lips and others unrounded."

Some people like it and push for it, but that's just an abstraction anyway, and there are many cases where the application of a binary distinction has caused more problems than its solved."

The bigger problem, however, is when you get into having more than 5 vowels. And this applies to Ryukyuan as well. For example, some Amami variants have 6-7 vowels, which means needing to use extra characters to represent certain sounds. For example, <mï> (roughly /mɨ/) might be written メィ, while <më> (roughly /mə/) would be メゥ. This gets a little cumbersome when you have sequences like <ɸï> (/ɸɨ/) or <ɸë> (/ɸə/), which you would have to write it as フェィ and フェゥ.  I don't know if that applies to many Polynesian languages, but that's something to consider. Another one would be the glottal stop. If the language has no consonant gemination, you might be able to use っ, otherwise you'd probably have to add a symbol.  This all said, there's nothing saying you can't mix hiragana and katakana to get a larger array of sounds, and there's nothing saying you can't extend the system to add symbols, diacritics and characters as necessary.

However, that space would generally be used for annotation or glossing. Alternately the ruling of the lines could also be generously spaced for interlinear glossing. For medieval continential Latin texts-- and continental vernacualr texts from a certain period-- arguably even less space was used with the pages being ruled in two columns, with a clear demarcation between.  The creation of a book tended more towards aesthetic considerations first, though obviously this varied by use as well as the finances of the person who wanted said book."

The exclamation point shouldn't be used either.  In answer to the OP's question, I would point out that Japanese punctuation isn't all that much like the usual punctuation used by Latin languages. Its various parantheses and quotation marks are quite different in appearance and use, and their orientation depends on whether the text is vertical or horizontal. The Japanese period and comma are somewhat different as well. Japanese people are also inordinately fond of the kome-jirushi symbol (※).

Imagine the Toot 'n' C'mon motel is being excavated in the year 4022 when English is a long dead language. What would we know about it, despite all the detritus lying around?   In ""The Way We Think"" there is an illustration using Milton from Paradise Lost, which describes his ""unholy"" trinity. Satan begets Sin from his brow, and together with her begets Death; and with her in turn, Death begets all the other vices. We have parallels with Greek mythology (Sin from the brow of Satan), and the Fundamental Sin is the creation story of evil in at least one other pantheon.  But what is all this to an unbeliever? It's just fairy stories right? Even Christians may not accept this addition to their tradition, but it still demonstrates something - what Milton, and the people of his time, appreciated and thought deeply about (and I'm sure there are many who would argue its relevance to our time). It also reveals how they used their imaginations, which is something we use everyday for other things as well.  What would someone gain from reading Milton in the year 4022, or ""The Way We Think""? I cannot say, obviously, but people writing the Old Testament of the Bible likely didn't realize that their work would one day be used in discussions attempting to establish the truth of bicameralism, for example.

I'd say there were similar social implications with that transition, and an IB grader may find a transcendental comparison very insightful. There are, however, fewer English sources on those topics.

My paper ended up being too watered down for me to be particularly proud of (I didn't have the guidance you are getting about narrowing scope), but I think another of the aspects that was super interesting to my classmates was the demonstration of AAVE linguistic features. AAVE has clear grammatical and phonological features just like American English, and spelling those out led to a really engaging conversation (for example, what is the difference in meaning between ""He goin' to basketball"" vs. He be goin' to basketball). In short, I found that people were generally just really ignorant to the history and linguistic features, which led to them having negative perceptions of AAVE. (This was in Idaho, for context.)

In the end, they came to be seen as a necessary part of saying a simple 'no'. By the time of modern French, only one of them, pas, remained in regular use, and it has no fishbone of emphatic force left in it. It simply means 'no'. If you are tempted to think that this tale only reflects Gallic hyperbole, you may be surprised to know that the English negative marker 'not' is the result of exactly the same process. The original negation marker in English was ne, as in French. The modern word 'not' started out as a full-bodied ne-a-wiht 'not-ever-thing', or in other words 'nothing-whatsoever'. This phrase was added to the simple 'no', in order to create an emphatic `no way', 'not a jot' type of 'no'. By the tenth century, ne-a-wiht had already contracted to just nawiht, but it still retained its former meaning, so that a phrase like 'is ne seo nawiht' still meant 'I not see nothing whatsoever'. Later on, however, as this emphatic type of 'no' started being used more and more often, attrition set in. In form, nawiht was reduced to nawt, and alongside this erosion of sounds, there was also an inflationary weakening of meaning[...]"""

Having had experience with both Brazilians and the Portuguese, and knowing all other Romance languages, I can tell you that the two varieties of Portuguese are indeed the same language. There are regional differences as one would expect with any living language. The standard, educated languages also differ quite a bit, but not to the point that communication is hindered. There are spelling as well as grammatical differences between the two standards. You can be from Portugal, and read a Brazilian book, magazine or newspaper with little to no problem. Same goes for Brazilians approaching Portuguese literature. You'll notice some differences, and strange though they may seem to you, you'll understand the text and recognize the language as the same as yours.  The issue gets complicated once you steer away from non-standard speech, in which case you will even find arguments in favor of creolized forms of Brazilian Portuguese in some regions, and these forms differ even from the Brazilian standard.  The point being: yes, both languages are the same, especially when you look at the literary standards in both countries. Once you get into substandard speech, in both countries again, difficulties in communication may arise. This would be similar to having a college educated American in California speaking and writing English vs. going to a rural farm in the south of Kansas and hearing a farmer speak and reading his writing. Both variants are English, and both are valid -- the difference is that one variant has gained prestige socially, and the other one hasn't.   To summarize: 1) you have the Brazilian standard which differs from the European standard, but both standards are entirely intelligible, spoken and written; 2) you have Brazilian regional variants, which differ from the Brazilian standard itself, and these may be more difficult for Europeans and even some Brazilians to understand; same goes for European regional varieties that Brazilians, and possibly even some Portuguese, may have trouble understanding it."

Most movies that are dubbed into Spanish, for instance, generally will have a separate dubbing in Spain and Latin America, especially movies for children. Same goes for Quebecois French and European French (2 different dubbings are generally made).  In English, we see this to some extent, though albeit less since so much media is already produced originally in English. Look at the some of decisions to localize certain successful shows from one English-speaking country to another; ""The Office"" is one that comes to mind (a case in which, instead of airing the original UK show, a brand new one is made in the US named The Office)."

I do not think this subreddit should be strictly limited to professional / academic linguists. Lots of people have taken an active interest in learning and learning about language/s. As long as they express themselves well, that is fine by me. Besides, plenty of professional linguists talk rubbish on here too. Just because you have read a lot of literature which agrees with your views does not make you right or even knowledgeable in any real way. For example, there are people here insisting that UG is a scientifically proven concept - it is not, it is an ideological construct. We can argue about the merits of different positions and hypotheses, but to claim that an academic or professional status automatically makes your views more legitimate is an ad hominem / appeal to authority argument. Content is content, logic is logic, opinion is opinion. This subreddit is not a professional organisation. It is a public forum.

Like for example that Icelandic has remained unchanged for a thousand years and is the original language that the Vikings spoke, and other nonsense like that.

As long and 'King' and 'Egbert' are in the same case, it's obvious that they go together. But yeah, the title often comes second, like Tolkien's use of ""Theoden King"", which is a bit redundant because Theoden actually means king.  Here's the first line of Aelfred's Preface to Pastoral Care:  ""Ælfred Kyning hateð gretan Wærferð Biscep his wordum luflice ond freondlice.""  Even the Bishop has his title after his name."

There were three Gothic kings named Thiudareiks, more Frankish Theodorics than I can count, and even some Anglo-Saxons. Now we have Thierry in French, Dietrich in German, and even Tewdrig in Welsh.

Chinese compounds, esp 2 hanzi compounds which can then be used as nouns or verbs tend overwhelmingly to be formed from an initial verb followed by an object. The only difference from Classical Chinese to Modern is that while previously this would have been construed as two different words, presently it is not so.  跑步 - to run, from 跑 to 'run' 步 'step' = to run (quicken) one's step  说明 - to explain, from 说 to persuade, to speak 明 bright, clearly = to persuade/advocate/explain clearly  So first of all, what I am trying to show here is that the basic structure of the way word formation occurs in Chinese has not really changed from classical to the present day, at least not in this aspect.  Furthermore, even were you correct, this would not explain why the word order differs in Japanese, because Japanese hanzi words, even new ones that are created in the 21st century, are created according to these same Chinese grammar rules as I outlined above. I think that there must be some misconstruing perhaps on the Japanese part of which character was the object and which was the verb, OR that the Chinese got confused and reanalyzed several verbs so that they now differed from those previously imported into Japan."

What I mean is that in a lot of Kanji/Hanzi compounds, especially adjectives, the order of the two characters is pretty much arbitrary from a semantic point of view. For instance, using your example of 喜歡 vs. 歡喜, both of the constituent characters have roughly the same meaning (happy) and rearranging their order doesn't affect the meaning. Here are some other examples, off of the top of my head: 憤怒，悲哀，恐懼，清澈，寒冷. Granted, you cannot reverse the order of these due to convention, but that's just the point. There is no semantic reason NOT to reverse them so if the inertia of convention is overcome it's not inconceivable that one or more of the above might get ""flipped.""  Contrast this with compounds were order is semantically relevant: a computer could only logically be called a 電腦 not a 腦電, since this compound has a semantic structure reflected in the order of its constituents (roughly speaking, 電 modifies 腦)"

Most irregular verbs exist as remnants of historical conjugation systems. When some grammatical rule became changed or disused, some verbs kept to the old pattern. For example, before the Great Vowel Shift, the verb keep (then pronounced ""kehp"") belonged to a group of verbs whose vowel was shortened in the past tense; this pattern is preserved in the modern past tense kept (similarly crept, wept, leapt, left). Verbs such as peep, which have similar form but arose after the Vowel Shift, take the regular -ed ending."

However, because it's an unattested language, we have no way to know what those were, and many of our basic verbs are actually derived from PIE verbs that likely weren't originally irregular.  Take, for instance, the verb 'have' in English, and its cognates in Spanish and French: 'haber' and 'avoir', both of which are derived from the Latin verb 'habare', which meant 'have'. Those are all originally derived from the PIE root *gʰh₁bʰ-, meaning 'to grasp', which was likely a perfectly regular verb in PIE that over time became irregular in its descendents as it changed meaning.  This process isn't unusual. Taking Spanish again, 'haber', has been supplanted by 'tener', which itself once meant 'to hold, grasp', though even in Latin, it was already shifting in meaning towards meaning 'to have'. 'Haber' hangs on in Spanish for existential statements (in the form of 'hay', 'había', &c.) and as an auxiliary verb, but in all likelihood it will end up completely grammaticalised and disappear as an independent verb.  Basically, we have no way of knowing for sure."

Sometimes they end up being mashed together other verbs with similar meanings: this is what lead to the verb 'to be' in English having such a weird paradigm.  For an example of grammaticalisation, take the French future tense. Latin had a future tense, but the modern French future tense is only vaguely related to it. The modern future tense is derived from the future perfect, formed from the infinitive of the verb plus avoir/habare. However, you'd never think about it that way as the auxiliary verb has ended up ossifying into endings. This is also why the future tense in French is so straightforward compared to the other tenses, even with irregular verbs.  Some verbs that were almost certainly irregular have survived, but they're few and far between. The most obvious examples are the PIE copulas.  Edit: Just to clarify, I'm using French as my example language because, of the Romance languages I'm familiar with, it's easiest to see the relationship there. The construction actually originated in Vulgar Latin, IIRC, and most of the major Romance languages use it, with the exception of Romanian, though there could be a number of other minor Romance languages that use another construction too."

It is also necessary to consider whether or not there is a final dental, that is, whether the verb is inflected by adding (or replacing) -ed/-t/-d. The problem is that an originally clear system (in proto-Germanic) has become more arbitrary over time.   The term was coined by Grimm, a German early linguist. Generalised to non-Germanic languages, ""strong"" verbs are verbs that are inflected in a specific way that is opposed to another way of inflection, which is called ""weak"". This doesn't have to be about tense, either. You could have a fictional language that inflects verbs by count, so for example ""see"" would be ""bar"" if one person saw something, but ""bur"" if more than one person saw something; this we would then call ""strong verb"". The verb for ""sit"", by contrast, is inflected by affix: ""foo"" if one person is sitting, ""afoo"" if more people are sitting.   And even more general, strong and weak inflection categorises any kind of inflection: verb conjugation, but also noun or adjective declension. You could have strong and weak inflection of nouns according to mood in our fictional language. ""Dog"" is ""trog"" in that language. If you like dogs, it's ""trog"", but if you don't like them, it's ""trug"". That we will call strong inflection. But for ""cat"", ""frump"", it's different. If you like cats, it is ""frump"", and if you don't like cats, it's ""frumpa"". That we will call weak inflection.  edit: There is no rule that says that strong inflection is always inflection with an ablaut, and weak inflection always inflection with an affix. There is a degree of arbitrariness here.  I'm looking forward to turning up on /r/badlinguistics now. Apologies."

Edit: Of course, the preterite-presents give us verbs like 'shall', 'may', and 'are'. One interesting fact is that the preterite-presents in older English usually preserve the original Proto-Germanic 2nd person singular strong preterite ending *-t very well, likely owed to its disassociation from the preterite, archaic 'thou shalt' and 'thou art'. This ending was replaced in the other strong verbs by the time of Old English.  In the weak verbs, there were verbs like *wurkijaną, whose preterite stem lacked the -i-/vocalized -j- characteristic of other weak class 1 verbs. This gives us the archaic simple past 'wrought' to the verb 'work' in English, alongside the past participle of the same form, from PG *wurhtǭ and *wurhtaz, respectively.  There were the weak suffixless verbs, that were functionally strong in their present, but formed their preterite with the dental suffix. PG *bringaną, ""to bring"", is extra special because it formed its preterite with the dental suffix and ablaut.  And for strong verbs proper, there were some that took a -j- suffix in the stem, giving a superficially weak appearance in the West Germanic languages which experienced gemination before light syllabic -j-, like Old English strong 'sittan' ""to sit"", beside weak 'settan' ""to set"", from PG *sitjaną ""to sit"" and *satjaną ""to cause to sit, set"", respectively. The Old English strong verb would have been **setan otherwise, from PG **setaną, and giving English **set, ""to sit"".  Also, in strong class 2 verbs, an artificial monophthongizing occurred, in which -eu- was in some cases realized as -ū-, modeled after the monophthongization of strong class 1 -ei- to -ī-. But where the shift -ei- to -ī- was universal in Germanic, the monophthongization of -eu- was very limited. According to Kroonen, it mostly occurred in back-formed strong class 2 verbs.

Lesser-used verbs will follow these changes predictably, but, for those very common verbs, those forms are so driven into the brain, so people will hypercorrect themselves in an attempt to speak ""properly"" even when the form should have changed. And so the common verbs end up looking funky because they're caught between natural language evolution and people trying to be correct.

Sound changes take a long time to go to completion, it's not as if people have to suddenly relearn how to speak halfway through their lives. A bigger reason is sound changes themselves creating irregularities.  For example, in Japanese, the word for ""say"" used to be ipu, and the past tense was iputa. A sound change caused the central u to get deleted, resulting in ipu/ipta and then a further simplification of the consonant cluster to ipu/itta. This was still regular: compare kapu/katta meaning ""buy"". But then when the Japanese p was lost between certain vowels, the resulting present tense form was the awkward iu, which then became yuu. So sound changes created the irregular conjugation yuu/itta.  In fact, if sound changes were allowed to go by unchecked, pretty much every word would end up irregular. But since humans like patterns, a lot of these irregularities are simply ironed out and forgotten (consider when a child says ""I taked"" instead of ""I took""). Thus, only the most common words that are used often enough not to be forgotten end up keeping their irregularities — though even these will eventually disappear as well, with other irregularities in other words taking their place."

However, do you think you're going to wake up one morning and start conjugating the verb ""to eat"" differently just because your language is going through changes? Not at all. The common verbs were more conservative, ""speak"" ""spoke"", ""take"" ""took"", ""drink"" ""drank"", ""think"" ""thought,"" etc. And some other verbs that sounded like those verbs came to be conjugated similarly. So, even though ""sink"" isn't too common of a verb, it reminded the speaker of ""think"" so ""sank"" became the popular way to conjugate it. I do the same thing with the verb ""shit,"" ""shitted"" to me sounds wrong because it contradicts with the ""sit"" ""sat"" convention, so I hear ""shat"" as correct. Now, if a majority thought the same way, we'd see ""shat"" as past tense of ""shit.""  And that's only one way it can happen. Sometimes different tenses of the same verb can come from more than one entirely different verb ( see. ""to be"" ""is"" ""was"" ""are"" )."
linguistics,3ay6ja,dommitor,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"English verbs are actually pretty damn regular, at least in the present tense. Past tense gets a little wonky at times, but isn't that bad."

Obviously there's more going on here --- bare nouns can be fine in generics; not all determiners play this nicely (*The is pretty) --- but the data needs an explanation, and one such strategy is to call the determiner the head of these sorts of phrases, and so the noun is optional in a way the determiner isn't.  $ There's some room to argue that determinacy and definiteness are distinct, so we might want to have more fine-grained categories in here.

linguistics,3az8ca,greenuserman,5,Thu Jun 25 11:45:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Why is that?   That was me explaining what I meant with ""well established in GL"". In this video Prof. Heycock gives a good simple explanation for why the DP-hypothesis was first adopted in Government and Binding. You might need to watch some of the other videos in the list to understand it properly.  I'm probably confusing you by telling you this, but sadly many of the arguments in the video can't be formulated in current minimalist theories of syntax.  The reasons why the DP-hypothesis is still adopted are plenty and hard to pin-down. The main reason is simple: adopting the DP-hypothesis has lead to a big amount of interesting work and hasn't created many problems, so GLists1 weren't hard-pressed to abandon it when some of the initial arguments supporting it went sour. That might sound like a bad reason to accept a hypothesis, but me and my understanding of Lakatos' philosophy of science would argue that it's a normal and perfectly understandable thing to do. (Think about the atom-hypothesis of the 19th century, for example. There was very little independent evidence in favour of it, but it lead to a much neater theory, so it was accepted).  For examples of how the DP-hypothesis has been fruitful, see the work on the cartography of the DP2 (first volume of The Cartography of Syntactic Structures, edited by Cinque, 2002) and all work on Phases, including but not at all limited to Chomsky's work (2000 et seq.) and Gallego's (2012) collection of articles.   Can you give me a nutshell version of what you mean? That is, how would the analysis of determiner phrases lead to a more logical analysis of complementizers and prepositions?   For independent reasons, GL has given both prepositions and complementisers head-status in the theory (sort of). Thefore, we say that a full sentence is a CP (complementiser phrase) and not just a projection of the verb (i.e. not a VP). By analogy to clauses, it's not weird to assume that nominals work in a similar fashion, having a ""core"" in which thematic roles are assigned (VP/vP or NP/nP) and a sequence of functional projections adding more information to the core. Determiners seem to be more on the ""information added"" side of the distinction, as they don't appear at all to be the noun's arguments.  In other words, because GL already doesn't conflate the idea of ""head"" with some concept of ""prominence"" or ""importance"", the idea of determiners being heads of nominals isn't seen as weird. They're not saying determiners are more important than nouns or that they hold the ""main meaning"" in nominals, or anything like that. They're saying quite specifically that determiners aren't part of the noun's maximal projection but are rather part of its functional sequence, which are the parts that add little bits of meaning, like complementisers, auxiliaries and adverbs in the case of clauses.   (1) I'm not saying ""generativists"" because that would include non-transformational generativists, but they normally don't accept the DP hypothesis. As I already said, GL stands for ""(transformational) generative linguistics"", at least in this series of posts by me.  (2) I don't mean actually try and read it. It's far from being introductory work."

And 3) people telling the stars that they are wrong because they have ideas of how stars should behave and the stars do not conform to these preconceived ideas.

It is completely silly for a person to ""tell stars how to behave"" because we cannot control stars. We can control words. Because words have a real effect, shouldn't we be prescriptive to a certain degree? I mean, if other fields were completely descriptive it would be silly. Someone in biomedical engineering might write a descriptive paper about how a certain new technology works, but the overall purpose of such a paper is to improve the technology-- and we already have a prescriptive idea of what the technology ought to do: improve human lives. What is the point of linguistics if it is not going to be used to improve the world in some way?"
linguistics,3b1v9z,millionsofcats,9,Thu Jun 25 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"Because words have a real effect, shouldn't we be prescriptive to a certain degree?   Well, language isn't a technology; for the most part, it's not something that we can engineer to be better by inventing new rules. If it was, perhaps the discipline of linguistics would be very different.  Linguists aren't philosophically opposed to prescriptivism. What we're opposed to is bad arguments - those based on ignorance, prejudice, and faulty reasoning. Prescriptive arguments about the structure of a language are bad (don't use singular ""they"" because it's illogical), because they simply aren't supported by what we know about language. When we say that linguistics is descriptive, not prescriptive, it's because a scientific, prescriptive approach to grammar simply doesn't exist.  But some prescriptive arguments that relate to social impacts are reasonable (don't use racial slurs because they're hurtful). When it comes to this type of argument, you'll find that linguists have different opinions on where they draw the line between expressing a personal viewpoint and expressing a viewpoint as a linguist - because, after all, the person and the linguist are the same and cannot be completely separated.   Public education is almost universally agreed upon as a good thing, though. And you will find, for example, many sociolinguists who have published pieces in which they argue for a change in language attitudes or policies. It is probably confusing to conflate this with arguing for an actual change in the language, but you can find pieces like that as well (e.g. bri-an's example of a linguist using the history and impact of redskin to argue that we shouldn't use it).    What is the point of linguistics if it is not going to be used to improve the world in some way?   A lot of scientists and other people engaged in academic inquiry think that improving our knowledge about how the world works is itself a way to improve the world. But also, we simply don't know what kinds of improvements our studies will lead to, anyway."
linguistics,3b1v9z,veritate_valeo,7,Thu Jun 25 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think zoology might be a better analogy. A zoologist learns about organisms by studying them in their habitats, subjecting them to tests, etc., but the purpose of zoology is not to ""improve the natural world"" or to ""improve"" animals, but rather to understand them, to shed light on how to live with them, to explain to people who are afraid of them why what they are doing is natural and safe, etc. It would be downright silly for a zoologist to say ""look at the design on this water buffalo, it could be so much more efficient, we should try to breed them to get rid of this feature and that feature"" etc.   Or if a zoologist said ""this new mutation is just going to be harmful to the species in the long run, we should stop it from spreading"" - the zoologist would have to be sublimely arrogant to assume they know how that mutation is going to spread and affect that species generations in the future. Rather, there is so much more to be learned by seeing how that mutation arose, how it interacts with members of the species without the mutation, and how it ebbs or flows across generations. By doing so the zoologist can aspire to make models and predict trends of how such things might happen in the future. If engineers want to then take that knowledge and those models and apply them to other fields, that is their domain, but not that of zoology."

Imagine if a prescriptive zoologist took a book by Linnaeus and declared that we had to maintain the animal kingdom as it is in this book and deviations from it are wrong and should be eradicated. This view is wrong on many levels: first Linnaeus' work is meant to describe the world, not say what animals are right. Second Linnaeus obviously missed a lot of things: animals that were not discovered, animals that changed since his days, animals that are now known better than in his times, entire classes of animals that he didn't have the technical knowledge to study (e.g. microscopes). It would be ridiculous to raise Linnaeus' work's incompleteness to the status of rule.  Criticizing today's English based on discrepancies with old dictionaries is just the same. Not only that things change is normal, but also many of the things likely didn't change and simply escaped the attention of the dictionary makers: different dialects, words in little use, etc."

I have no doubt that many prescriptivists do see themselves as fighters in a just war. I do wonder, though, how many of them are in it to protect, and how many of them are in it because it's a socially sanctioned outlet for the desire to shoot people. In other words, do they prescribe to protect, or is protection the guise that they must adopt since their true motives (a desire to correct, cajole, shame, or otherwise look good by comparison) would be viewed as suspect? These are, of course, unanswerable questions, at least from my limited understanding of what we can discern through psychometric investigation. This is why I took issue with the idea, rather than outright reject it. It's a problematic thing, getting into the mindset of others, but I think that prescriptivists come in all shapes and sizes, and I'm not sure that prescriptivism itself is intended to improve anything, at least inherently. I think the intent of prescriptivism is to encourage uniformity; this may be good or it may be bad, but I think overall, it does not represent a positive (or even necessarily negative) intent."

Is that not a way to prescribe appropriate attitudes toward language?    Prescribing attitudes towards speech is not the same thing as prescribing speech itself.   Would it not also be appropriate for linguists to make public certain types of prescriptive arguments? For example, a linguist might write a piece about why the term ""redskin"" is seen as offensive and why it should be retired?    A sociolinguist might justifiably be interested in describing the connotations and cultural moors associated with some such term.

We know that we would get funded better if we had clear applications - more so if we could churn out MBAs, but we also know that a world in which we know stuff is better than a world in which we don't. We also know that whether there are clear applications now is a fairly unreliable heuristic for whether there will be clear applications in the future.

When I think about it, I suppose linguists are stubbornly holding onto being descriptive as a matter of scientific principle. In order to be a science, it must necessarily be descriptive. There are moral questions when it comes to science (like, for instance, should we genetically modify humans?) but such questions themselves are not the science part. Likewise, ""should we keep the redskins as a mascot"" is not a scientific question, but it can draw from science. Either way, we still need to be able to do the science in order to even run into those questions."

But if you want, we can put that aside. Instead of trying to justify the existence of all fields of inquiry that don't have obvious practical applications, it might be better to focus on what kinds of linguistics topics are interesting to kids. Kids don't always care about what's useful, anyway. (See: dinosaurs.)   The age of the kids probably matters a lot though, because that will determine how complex you can get and what approaches will work. Questions based on pop-culture can also get them interested (why do we say ""craycray"" but not ""zyzy""), but again - you might run into a problem if the kids' problem solving and attention spans aren't up for it.

This is ignoring aspects of linguisyics like speech pathology, spell checkers, grammar analyzers/checkers, natural language processing in things like Siri, etc... curricula development, pedagogical improvement, language revitalization (which is whole other can of worms) and the like.   I'm the same way that a chemist can create a drug to help heal a disease, linguists can create material to help bolster a language and help other learn a language. We also can help create products that make our lives more intersting and perhaps easier.

Another practical application came from phonetics research, which helped to optimize speech detection in telephone systems (and Bell Labs is still active to this day in this research).   It's fair to say that most research in any field doesn't ever result in implemented technologies that positively effect the lives of everyday people though. But most people agree it's better to know than to not know, even if it costs money."

First year classes are all about getting everyone up to speed (assuming your program works similarly to mine).   What I do suggest is, if possible, to move a little early and give yourself some time to settle in, unpack, and explore. Walk around campus, scout out some good places to get coffee and/or work, set up your desk if you get office space. Generally, get comfortable in your new surroundings. Moving and grad school can both be stressful, so I recommend some special time to deal with the first before you add on the second."

A government survey carried out by the Minister of Public Instruction in 1863 revealed that in 22 percent of all communes French was not the language in everyday use."

On the other hand, he is claimed [here] to have said that French is the only language used in only 15 out of 83 départements, so you can deduce that minority languages and regional variants were still alive and well at that point.  Other figures quoted here from the Abbott's report:    Less than 3 million people (out of 25 million) can be said to speak fluent French, 6 million are completely ignorant of French, Another 6 million only have the most basic understanding of it   Those last two figures are likely underestimations, since another report published 70 years later lists 7.5 million people who cannot speak any French. Given the vigour with which the linguistic unification was pursued, it's likely that Grégoire's numbers were much lower than reality."

linguistics,3aukdj,wildeye,-2,Wed Jun 24 06:29:42 2015 UTC,"From a more grammatical than specifically linguistic perspective, this construction is quite explainable. The present perfect tense is formed, in various languages, primarily with (the word for) ""to have"". So we have ""I have eaten,"" ""J'ai mangé,"" and ""Ich habe gegessen.""  But with certain verbs of motion and completion, the same tense is formed with (the word for) ""to be."" This is quite standard in other languages, as in ""Je suis allé"" or ""Ich bin gegangen."" But in English it is optional: we can say ""I have gone"" or ""I am gone"" and mean very nearly the same thing.  The weirdness in your usage is introduced by the transitive verb. The ""to be"" construction of the present perfect is elsewhere exclusively used with intransitive verbs. Your dialect allows it to be used with transitive verbs (even though ""to do"" and ""to finish"" could in other circumstances be intransitive) whence the confusion."
linguistics,3aukdj,cheezburga,0,Tue Jun 23 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"To me it sounds perfectly normal, like saying, ""I'm finished my homework, now,""   Just to be perfectly clear, outside of your dialect, ""I'm finished my homework"" sounds exactly as wrong as ""I'm done my meeting"", but you phrased it as if you expected the homework one to be widely judged as acceptable.  Nope. They're both the same pattern, and both are equally acceptable in your dialect (from what you're saying), and both are equally unacceptable in other major dialects.  Incidentally it's not at all uncommon for various dialects, including the major ones, to drop words in various contexts, but clearly it varies as to which.  That general phenomenon is the subject of vast amounts of theoretical linguistic research."
linguistics,3awx8e,roan180,5,Wed Jun 24 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, ""la cara"" is the direct object, ""se"" is the indirect object in that sentence. Spanish doesn't distinguish direct and indirect object reflexive pronouns, but some languages do. For example, in Czech the sentences would be ""Objimají se."" but ""Myje si obličej."". Edit: So does Russian with себе vs. себя."
linguistics,3awx8e,payik,2,Wed Jun 24 08:32:17 2015 UTC,"But what would account for this change? Because in a sentence like ""se abrazan"" (they hug each other), ""se"" is the reflexive and thus, what I would assume to be, the DO. Whereas in ""Él abrazó al perro"" (he hugged the dog), ""el perro"" would be the DO. However, in my example when these two are combined that's when everything gets screwy.  And also, The notion of an indirect object reflexive pronoun isn't part of Spanish as with Russian since the only reflexive pronoun in Spanish acts as a clitic to the verb. Russian has an unbound reflexive pronoun (себя) as well as a verbal suffix that changes based on phonological environment (-ся, -сь). Spanish only has the second one but its realized as a cliticized pronoun. Also, could you please morphologically parse your Czech example? I'm curious about it."
linguistics,3awx8e,payik,2,Wed Jun 24 10:27:06 2015 UTC,"It's the same with Spanish, it just doesn't distinguish the two and uses ""se"" for both.

linguistics,3awx8e,zxjams,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:26:37 2015 UTC,Your own example? Why do you think reflexive pronouns should only be used for DO? They can be used for anything except the subject.
linguistics,3awx8e,zxjams,3,Thu Jun 25 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"Similar to what u/payik said, French works in the same way as Spanish.  Most of the time, indirect and direct object pronouns are identical:  Je me lave = I wash (myself) Je me lave les cheveux = I wash my hair Elle se regarde (dans le miroir) = She looks at herself (in the mirror) Elle se maquille le visage = She puts makeup on her face  BUT, the 3rd person (not reflexive) IO and DO pronouns are different, both singular and plural, and you can see the difference when using them:  Je le coupe = I cut it/him Je lui coupe les cheveux = I cut his/her hair Je les coupe = I cut them Je leur coupe les cheveux = I cut their hair  We can imagine that since the structure is exactly the same (subject + object pronoun + verb + complement), the reflexive pronouns serve as indirect objects when accompanying a direct object.  Edit: les has two different meanings/functions - it's the plural definite article (the hair = les cheveux; the children = les enfants, etc), as well as the plural direct object pronoun when used with a verb (Stop them! = Arrêtez-les ! I'll stop them = Je les arrêterai, etc)."
linguistics,3awx8e,Kyle--Butler,2,Wed Jun 24 12:06:59 2015 UTC,"So what syntactic test could one apply to show that the reflexive is becoming a IO with reflexive verbs that have a complement?   In Spanish you could say ""me lavo la cara a mí"" (I wash my face) and usually ""a"" accompanies IO however, if the DO of a verb is a person, then it also gets accompanied by ""a"" ergo if it were direct or indirect is not distinguished. Does French have the same ambiguity?"
linguistics,3awx8e,zxjams,2,Wed Jun 24 12:29:25 2015 UTC,"No, French doesn't have this ambiguity. You can say j'ai lavé son visage à lui (I washed his face - not someone else's), but direct objects don't get a preposition, whether or not they're people - only indirect objects do. J'ai vu Mathieu au bar hier soir (I saw Matthew at the bar yesterday evening), but j'ai vendu ma voiture à Mathieu (I sold my car to Matthew)."
linguistics,3awx8e,Kyle--Butler,-2,Wed Jun 24 13:24:01 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. In french, in ""je me lave les cheveux"", ""me"" isn't IO of ""lave"".  First of, I see no reason to assume that the function of ""me"" in ""je me lave les cheveux"" is any different from the one of ""lui"" in ""je lui lave les cheveux"".  And in ""je lui lave les cheveux"" = ""je lave les cheveux de la fille"", it seems to me the only way to parenthesize this is [je] [lave] [les cheveux [de la fille]] and not [je] [lave] [les cheveux] [de la fille].  I mean ""de la fille"" is the answer to ""les cheveux de qui ?"", not ""*à/de/pour qui je lave ?"".   Sometimes, there can be some ambiguity e.g. ""je reçois le telephone de mon père"" which can be either understood ""[je] [reçois] [le telephone] [de mon père]"" (from my father)  or ""[je] [reçois] [le telephone de mon père]"" (my father's phone). But in ""je lave les cheveux de la fille"", i can't see any ambiguity of this kind."
linguistics,3awx8e,zxjams,2,Wed Jun 24 13:38:24 2015 UTC,"I see no reason to assume that the function of ""me"" in ""je me lave les cheveux"" is any different from the one of ""lui"" in ""je lui lave les cheveux"".   You're right, it isn't any different.  But lui / leur are the standard 3rd person indirect object pronouns. You use them in cases like:  je lui ai vendu ma voiture - ""I sold my car to him/her"" mirrored with elle m'a vendu sa voiture  as well as verbs which by definition only take indirect objects in French:  le repas leur a plu - ""They liked the meal/The meal was pleasing to them"" mirrored with le repas nous a plu etc  I'm not sure about your reasoning for why it's not an indirect object, because the grammar shows that it is, especially with a feminine or plural subject in past tenses. The past participle has to agree with the subject in the case of (reflexive) direct objects, but not indirect objects, which is why you'll see:  elle s'est lavée - she washed (herself) - with an e. But elle s'est lavé les mains - she washed her hands - no e.  Same with things like:  ils se sont écoutés - DO but ils se sont parlé - IO  You see what I mean?"
linguistics,3awx8e,DieFlipperkaust-Foot,0,Wed Jun 24 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you just said.   What i was trying to say is that ""je lui lave les cheveux"" cannot be analyzed the same way ""ce repas nous a plu"" can.  The fact that it's not a DO does not suffice to prove that it's an IO. And my point is that ""lui"" in ""je lui lave les cheveux"" is not an object of the verb at all. It's not a DO, but it's not an IO either. It's nothing for the verb. It's the genitive (""complément du nom"") of ""les cheveux"".  I can think of two tests to see that an IO analysis doesn't add up.   Clitics   If ""de la fille"" was an IO of ""lave"", you could cliticize the DO ""les cheveux"" and leave the IO ""de la fille"" untouched. For example, ""Jean a donné le cadeau à Pierre"" --> ""Jean l'a donné à Pierre"".  But ""*Je les lave de la fille"" is clearly ungrammatical.   Passive transform   Under passive transformation for affirmative declarative sentences, IOs remain unaffected : S V DO IO -> DO V par S IO.  Hence ""Marie a vendu la voiture à la voisine"" -> ""la voiture a été vendue par Marie à la voisine"".  But the passive of ""je lave les cheveux de la fille"" is ""les cheveux de la fille ont été lavés par moi"" and not ""*les cheveux ont été lavés par moi de la fille"".  There's no relation whatsoever between ""de la fille"" and the verb ""lave"" : ""de la fille"" is nothing for the verb ""lave"", it's only the genitive of ""les cheveux""."
linguistics,3awx8e,Kyle--Butler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:23:33 2015 UTC,"I understand the reasoning now, but I'm still not sure that an IO wouldn't be valid. In certain cases in standard French, you do say à to indicate ownership, as well as in many more cases in spoken French which prescriptivists wouldn't necessarily consider correct.  La voiture à Marie a été vendue à sa voisine  On the other hand, les cheveux à la fille ont été lavés sounds a less natural since it's not an owned object, but a part of the body. You could still say something like ses cheveux à elle ont été lavés at some point, though.  At any rate, I'm assuming it's just the way French (along with other romance languages, maybe?) works - you use something which has the same surface form as an indirect object. There has never been anything resembling a genitive since French became noticeably distinct from Latin - just subject and oblique case in the earliest stages for nouns, then the typical direct object, indirect object, and possessive pronouns."

The get passive is really remarkable because it's actually only typically used to indicate adverse events (e.g. get killed) and while you can construct positive/neutral examples (get paid), these are actually quite rare in context.   The semantic picture is much more rich and complex than that, but that's a general and growing trend with the get passive. Perhaps in a few hundred years it might look more like the adversative passivea of east asia, (/though likely not, considering the large topicality differences that make those systems possible).   edit: also, I'd actually look for papers on the 'kriegen' passive in german. Dutch also shows a similar construction but I'm leas familiar with it. I'd honestly look more closely at adversative passives as an areal feature of east asian languages. The japanese adversative passive is by far the most famous, but most of the languages in the region have this sort of passive. That's not to say there aren't differences in semantics and usage, but much of that seems to be due to other areal features, specifically that passives dont have the same functionality as indo european languages because of differences in the encoding of topicality. I could potentially suggest other similarities in constructions across languages (and even within english), but I'm not fully done with that work. I will say, as a general cognitive/diachronic trend, constructions that are resultative typically take on adversative meaning when they're paired in a contrast with formally and semantically similar constructions."

It differs from the non-manner translocative e.g. get home, get to school.   Get passives are the specific class of constructions that occur when the be in a be-passive is replaced by 'get'. to make sure you've got a passive, check to see whether or not you can add an agentive by-phrase.

linguistics,3ar98g,Brotten,8,Mon Jun 22 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"No.  It's just common in languages for passive constructions to be tied to situations with negative outcomes in the minds of speakers, which is sometimes called the adversative passive. And this interaction makes sense when you think about the motivations involved for using valency changing operations to emphasize what has happened to topical (usually non) agents from a agent. In some languages like Japanese, a adversative interpretation of the use of the passive is heavily implied by default, so unless a positive outcome is made explicit it will be the more likely interpretation."

linguistics,3ar98g,Tornadorally,3,Tue Jun 23 01:02:29 2015 UTC,"It might have one with German.  Get in English also means to become: to get sick, to get taller, coll. ""let's get buck/weird"".  In German the verb ""werden"" to become is used in the formation of the ""Vorgangspassiv"" (as opposed to the ""Zustandspassiv"" which some Germanists claim doesn't really exist as a passive...)  However in German you would never use ""kriegen"" or ""bekommen"" (which mean to get in the sense of receive) to form a passive."
linguistics,3ar98g,normaltypetrainer,6,Tue Jun 23 09:47:45 2015 UTC,"""bekommen"" or ""kriegen"" are most definitely used in German passive constructions. Especially in nonstandard varieties of German the so called ""bekommen-Passiv"" is used a lot. You are right however that this is a relatively recent change. Here are some examples to show the process behind this change:  Take these two sentences:  1) Ich bekomme ein Auto. (I get a car.)  2) Ich bekomme ein Auto geklaut. (I get a car stolen.)  In the first sentence ""bekommen"" is used as a main verb with the semantic content of ""to get in possession of sth."". In the second sentence ""bekommen"" is semantically void. It only acts as an auxiliary to the participle ""geklaut"". In other words: In the first sentence ""ein Auto"" is an argument of the simple predicate ""bekommen"", in the second sentence ""ein Auto"" is an argument of the complex predicate ""geklaut bekommen"".   Now how do we get from sentence 1) to 2)?  Most likely there are several steps involved. The first step is the misinterpretation of a syntactic structure:  3) Ich bekomme ein Auto leihweise. (I get a car on a loan.)  4) Ich bekomme ein Auto geliehen. (I get a car lent.)  Sentence 3) is the same as sentence 1) only with an adverbial added. The function of adverbials can also be expressed by participles as shown in sentence 4). In both sentences it is still possible to interpret ""ein Auto"" as an argument of the main verb ""bekommen"". This can be illustrated by adding more stuff to the sentence:  5) Ich bekomme ein Auto, und zwar geliehen/leihweise. (I get a car, in fact lent/on a loan)  The problem with constructions like 4) is that they are prone to misinterpretation because they look like a an auxiliary construction.  But that's not enough yet to justify the existence of the ""bekommen Passiv"". After all, in constructions like  6) Ich kaufe ein Auto gebraucht. (I buy a car used.)  ""gebraucht kaufen"" is not going to be interpreted as a complex predicate. Let's take a look at what happens when you put a sentence with a direct object (accusative case) and an indirect object (dative case) in the passive voice.  7) Du klaust mir ein Auto. (You steal [from] me a car.) -> Mir wird ein Auto geklaut. (Me becomes a car stolen.)  As you can see the passive construction in 7) is structurally similar to sentence 4) but not to sentence 6). These things combined lead to speakers interpreting ""geliehen bekommen"" or ""geklaut bekommen"" as a complex predicate in which ""bekommen"" is semantically void. An extension of the sentence as in 5) is not possible anymore:  8) *Ich bekomme ein Auto, und zwar geklaut. (I get a car, in fact stolen)  I hope this is somewhat understandable, I basically copy/pasted that from my bachelor thesis and it is a subject I haven't really touched in some time."
linguistics,3ar98g,kl1no,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:03:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! So I live in Austria and have never heard this (but I'm not a native speaker and totally believe you!). How common is it? I mostly speak German at Uni (So obviously Standard) or with my boyfriend or his friends who all speak Standardish or Upper Austrian.  Edit: Asked my German boyfriend and he said he would not expect this from native speakers at all and it sounds like a mistake an English speaker would make speaking German... is it regional?

I don't have any corpus data to back it up right now. The example I chose is probably not something you would really hear, it was just used to demonstrate the semantic difference between ""bekommen"" as a main verb and ""bekommen"" as an auxiliary. In the context of ""geklaut bekommen"" this becomes quite clear, as ""beklaut werden"" is semantically basically the opposite of ""etwas bekommen"". What you would hear are sentences like:  Ich hab heute die Haare geschnitten bekommen.   But it's definitely limited to spoken German, it's not something you would see in a written form. Maybe  it's regional, I'll try to find some sources. Where I'm from (south western Germany) it's definitely pretty common."

linguistics,3ar98g,normaltypetrainer,2,Wed Jun 24 13:42:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it qualifies as a passive, but in German, you can use the verb kriegen (which is most similar to ""get"") in a construction where the third (indirect) argument of a verb becomes the subject.  Tim schenkt Peter ein Auto ""Tim gives Peter a car""  Peter kriegt von Tim ein Auto geschenkt Peter gets   by Tim   a car      given ""Peter is given a car by Tim""  Since kriegen means ""receive"", this is probably the prototypical context where this construction originated. But it can also be used in constructions where the third argument is not a recipient, but a beneficent (is that the right term?):  Peter kriegt von Tim die Haare geschnitten ""Peter gets the hair cut by Tim"""
linguistics,3ar98g,qwertzinator,4,Tue Jun 23 10:24:46 2015 UTC,"It's interesting because ""get"" has so many uses. There is a particular sense of ""get"" as ""become"" (i.e., ""get bigger,"" ""get older,"" ""get wiser,"" ""get wet,"" ""get ready."" Notice that this construction is generally ""get + adjective""). So, considering participles occupy a strange place between modifier and verb, it could be that this sense of ""get"" was what was originally meant - so, ""John got eaten"" = ""John became eaten,"" or ""John's state changed from uneaten to eaten;"" ""Ted got shot"" = ""Ted became shot;"" ""Jill got stuck"" = ""Jill became stuck.""  In German, the passive is formed with the verb ""to become,"" ""werden,"" so that might be a parallel.  Edit: for the real answer, see /u/MTG5's explanation below"
linguistics,3ar98g,wiled,7,Mon Jun 22 23:09:12 2015 UTC,"Actually the use of get as meaning ""arriving into a situation or state (beyond one's control or intent)"" parallels German geraten, as in ""außer Fassung geraten"", ""außer Kontrolle geraten"", or ""in Brand geraten"". It's used to mark all kinds of statives usually with a sense of the state being caused outside of the agency of the salient effected referents."
linguistics,3ar98g,adlerchen,3,Tue Jun 23 07:20:48 2015 UTC,"The inchoative get did in fact lead to the development of the get passive but not by the mechanism you're suggesting. The inchoative takes an adjective (get sick) so the change occured in adjectives that were formally and semantically related to passive participles i.e. the adjective 'married' led to the interpretation of a past participle 'married'. The same happened woth the modern passive. For example, 'We were married' could describe a state in the past (married last year, but the ceremony was a decade ago), or could reference an event by its result (married by a priest). This ambiguity would not have been possible with a verbal past participle like 'eaten' as in your example.   It is important to keep in mind that semantic changes and constructional development spread unevenly through the lexicon. It's not like neogrammarian sound change (or at least, the classic all or nothing categorial shifts) where a shift occurs though the lexicon 'all at once'. The construction developed into a passive with verbs like 'married' and once developed, eventually spread to 'eat' as a (more or less) 'typical' passive. No fancy synchronic footwork necessary...in that case at least.   edit: also,  this can be really finicky and it catches a lot of people, but just to point out 'get stuck' is not a get passive as it's not syntactically passive. It cannot take a by-phrase, it has no be-passive paraphrase, etc."

The first one is the simplification of the consonant cluster mg to just m, resulting in a form that you might spell Imana. If you listen carefully, you can hear people say Imana all the time, although if called upon to write down what they said, you'd probably just write it as ""I'm gonna"" (or ""I'm going to,"" depending on your acceptance of gonna). From Imana, it's a short step to Imna, as the unstressed middle vowel drops out. This process is called syncope, and also happens in words like choc'late, veg'table, and int'resting."

As for your other questions, judging by that wiki page there seems to be some disagreement in its classification. I've personally seen no usage of the term ""Torlakian"" outside of linguistics discussion since it is not standardized or anything, more like an umbrella term for a group of dialects. The Esperanto comparison doesn't really work for the sole reason that this isn't a constructed language, but I mean, I understand what you are getting at in terms of the whole mutual intelligibility thing. As a Serbian speaker, I can understand this speech almost in its entirety, and I imagine it would be similar for a Macedonian speaker. As far as Bulgarian goes, if the eastern dialects aren't too different from Torlakian, then it is quite possible that it could be used in the case you describe, but I couldn't really say."

Sanskrit has a very predictable system in which the ones place value is prefixed to the tens. Over time, development through the Prakrit, Apabhramsa, Old and New Indo-Aryan stages has made the numbers 1-100 for the most part unpredictable in languages like Hindi and Bengali and each number has to be learned separately."

But you're probably right, it's just base-10 with irregular words (but so many of them). My reasoning was maybe it could be said that they've evolved some base-100 system traits, much like how we look back on decimal systems today that have remnants of vigesimal systems.  Interestingly, in India, numbers are grouped by 1000s, then every two places after. The Anglicised forms of Hindi names ""lakh/lac"" (Sanskrit lakshya) and ""crore"" (Sanskrit koti) are used even in Indian English to mean 1,00,000 (100,000) and 1,00,00,000 (10,000,000), respectively.

linguistics,3apgj5,Brotten,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"It's really half the battle. For many languages there are computer measurements of how vowels and consonants are pronounced by native speakers, and these measurements are broadcast to the world in IPA. So yes, it will definitely help you, since it tells you exactly, what you have to do to sound native. With the knowledge of IPA, even Wikipedia alone (the better articles anyway) can already get rid entirely of any accent you have. As Folran points out, this all supposes that you are perfectly able to produce those sounds, of course. And therein lies a trap, because uncareful or purposefully broad translations might give you a wrong idea of what sound a letter represents. It'd be advisable to learn the sounds themselves from a source on phonetics rather than learning the sound from its incarnation in a specific language and mentally elevating that to the paragon of the IPA character."
linguistics,3apgj5,FiliusLunae,2,Tue Jun 23 09:17:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find IPA is most useful when making comparisons -- either within the same language, distinguishing phonemes and allophones, and being able to sightread those differences on paper; or, comparisons between languages, knowing that French has a uvular /r/ while Spanish doesn't, for example.   You run into trouble, however, if you rely only on IPA transcriptions to pronounce words. IPA transcriptions are only approximations: although the same symbol can be used for different languages, the actual sound produced is actually different in each language (for instance, compare IPA /a/ or /e/ or even /s/ across languages). This is true even when a very narrow transcription is done -- there will be differences that will be difficult to capture in IPA.  As an example, even with a training in linguistics, it would be difficult for me to sightread IPA transcriptions of Mandarin, and pronounce glosses with a native-sounding accent. I just don't have experience with Mandarin at all, and don't know the exact contour of the tones, the compression of the vowels, the interaction of tones and sounds with each other, etc.   But, say I had taken at least 1 class of Mandarin, I would already be already familiar with its phonology, and this is when IPA shines.  Point being: if you become familiar with the language's phonology, IPA is a very powerful tool. If you don't have experience with the language, you'll sound OK reading off IPA transcriptions, but it will be hard to pull off a native-sounding pronunciation."
linguistics,3apgj5,fromupeast,2,Fri Jun 26 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"So the IPA shouldn't be used alone with studying languages, but in tandem with other resources?"
linguistics,3apgj5,FiliusLunae,2,Sat Jun 27 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   Sometimes people will assume that IPA is an exact representation of sound; that reading IPA, you can pronounce Swahili, Hindi, or Mayan like a native. IPA is only an approximation of the sounds it represents. Only way to know exactly what those IPA symbols represent in the context of the language you're working with is to listen to native speakers, and learn the exact sounds that correspond to those IPA symbols in that language."
linguistics,3apgj5,Spitalian,2,Sat Jun 27 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"Learning IPA is very helpful for this. Ever since I've learned it, I've been able to pronounce things in other languages and dialects very easily (assuming I can find a transcription!). I'm sure my pronunciations aren't perfect, and IPA isn't perfect, but being able to read a transcription and produce an accurate pronunciation a few seconds later is well worth it. It's way better than the kind of listening and approximating that you have to do if you don't know IPA."

Does that mean a language with ks should be expected to have a second k- phone (or a second -s phone)   no, thats not what i mean. i would encourage you to look up more in-depth the concept of minimal pairs, but ill give a brief explanation. when i say that a sound can be a phoneme its distinguished with another sound, i mean that sound has a minimal pair with another sound. for instance, in my english dialect, /i/ and /ɪ/ are phonemes because theres a minimal pair--<sheep> /ʃip/ and <ship> /ʃɪp/.   if a minimal pair were to exist with a [k͡s] cluster, for instance to words like [k͡sa] and [ka], then [k͡s] would be a phoneme. however, the existence of this minimal pair doesnt necessarily entail that a [k͡p] [t͡s] phone is expected, since the minimal pair doesnt need a certain ""set"" of sounds to contrast with--""any old sound will do"", so to speak."

linguistics,3apgj5,Woodsie_Lord,2,Wed Jun 24 08:35:38 2015 UTC,"Even if many words come from Latin sources (either directly or via Romance languages), English still has Germanic grammar, morphosyntax and phonology. Vocabulary is just a small part of what makes a language what it is. It could be said that English is just a Germanic language with a Romance/Italic shell or outlook.  For starters, English shows certain sounds which are results of Grimm's law, a set of sound shifts which phonemically seperate Germanic languages from other centum Indo-European languages like Greek, Latin or Irish. There are other specifically Germanic sound shifts which English definitely underwent like grammatischer Wechsel (ever wondered why there's a consonantal discrepancy between forms 'was' and wer'e?).  Grammar is still strongly Germanic. The infamous irregular/strong verbs English has like drive/drove/driven, eat/ate/eaten. Some patterns are even shared with other Germanic languages, compare German singen/sang/gesungen with sing/sang/sung or leiden/litt/gelitten (to suffer, digraph ei is pronounced as diphthong [ai]) with slide/slid/slid.  Even if English regularized most of its noun plurals, it still has quite a few plurals which have Germanic endings. Few examples are ox vs. ox-en, child vs. child-r-en (a double plural here), foot vs. feet (German Fuß vs. Füße) or man vs. men (compare German Mann vs. Männer).  Apart from just a handful of Romance/Latin influence like endings -al (recreation-al), -able/-ible (do-able, suspect-ible) or -ance (deliver-ance), word derivation is still Germanic too, there are tons of endings like -ish (brown-ish), -ly (strong-ly), -ing (thicken-ing), -y (fat-t-y), -dom (free-dom), -ness (sad-ness), -er (sing-er), -ed (play-ed) which, again, are of Germanic origins. I'd even say that there are more Germanic prefixes in English (un-do, over-lord, with-draw, out-house) than there are Latin prefixes (re-write, en-compass)  And these are just few examples I can recall from the top of my head. Apart from some Germanic vocab, there are tons of things in grammar, morphosyntax and phonology which make English a Germanic language."

He left behind his trusted steadholder Marc Antony, biding him to mend the goods onstand and get him more wyemen quickly. Knowing, however, that Pompey was brooking every heartbeat of holdup to gather fultum and broaden his strength, Caesar could not wait; at the head of his now twenty-one-thousand-strong hera he strided to gouth.  The two heras met on the fields of Pharasulus, with Pompey's harmen outdoing Caesar's by more than two-to-one. Albeit the odds, Caesar was the winner, his shining headmanship making up for his drawback in tally. Pompey fled the field, and shortly thereafter was backstabbed and murdered by the Egypters. Now unmeted overseer of Rome, Caesar went to Egypt, where he put his lover Cleopatra upon the highsittle after a short but bitter fight.  Back in Rome, Caesar began a broad foredraught of mends. He began to lessen the Romish owing; he settled his afanded abroad, giving them the land they craved but not gainsaying others (other Romish, that is). He mended the Romish daybook, wielded folkly backing and strengthened the middle flock. His deeds greatly bettered life for the mean townsman, but angered the highbred, the leftovers of the Optimate thede.  In Solmonth of 44 BC, the pawn Eldermoot chose Caesar ""dictator perpetuus,"" or tharlreve for life. For the first time he began wearing woad clothing, a hue betokening at that time kings and overlords. Moreover, he let his castmen be decked like the castmen of the gods.

linguistics,3aqfka,adlerchen,3,Tue Jun 23 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"Isolating morphology tends to approach speech production periphrastically with preexisting lexemes, so when specific formulations become themselves lexical items (fireman from fire + man) you have a obvious vector for synthesis. One of the elements in a phrase may phonetically elide, which can lead to (new) speakers no longer drawing the parallel that element has etymologically with its isolated form, which can lead to partial semantic bleaching or semantic shift. The effected element thus completes the transition from ""word"" to affix. Now it can be reanalyzed as a result of the semantic change, leading to potential productive use in morphology in new phrases. Consider Latin habēre eliding to form various affixal reflexes by the time of early Spanish. It became the source of Spanish's various future tense verb affixes, as explained here along with other historical morphological developments along the way.   This is also seen as a key vector pattern for synthesis in van Gelderen 2011 - The Linguistic Cycle, if I recall correctly."

No other variety of English is relevant to assigning a word to Wells's lexical sets.  The Wikipedia article used to explain this clearly, but unfortunately some well-meaning editors have added extra information that makes it a lot more confusing.

linguistics,3anc3b,grog23,13,Sun Jun 21 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"From another comment of mine:   Separable verbs are made of a preverb and a verb. Preverbs are on a cline with prefixes, particles, prepositions, and adverbs. Prefixes are inseparable parts of a verb, and they form a complex verb. Preverbs are separable, and they form a complex predicate. Particles form a complex verb but cannot be joined to the verb (e.g. *putupped is not an acceptable past tense of put up); they usually double as prepositions. Prepositions are independent syntactically, though they often are specified by the verb (e.g. English dream of vs. Spanish soñar con 'dream with'). Adverbs make up kind of a catch-all class, but one class of adverbs are basically unaccusative prepositions, that is, prepositions that need no object following them.  Lots of Indo-European languages have them. English doesn't have them, although it has things that look like them (turn over vs. overturn) (EDIT from June 2015: it may also show traces of it in derivations, e.g. outgoing vs. go out). Old French had a number of them, including re-, which could raise from the lexical verb to an auxiliary. Re- was also linked semantically to the particle ariere 'back'; so while German preverbs look the same whether they are in prefix form or in particle form, Old French preverbs could vary in their allomorphy. If I recall correctly, Old Irish had preverbs, as did Sanskrit. Just search for preverb in Google Scholar, and you should find stuff. I drew on the following articles when researching preverbs for a paper I did on the history of re- in French.  Dufresne, Monique, Fernande Dupuis & Mireille Tremblay. 2003. Preverbs and particles in Old French. Yearbook of Morphology 2003, 33-60: Springer Netherlands. Booij, Geert & Ans Kemenade. 2003. Preverbs: an introduction. Yearbook of Morphology 2003, 1-11. (and see other contributions to this book)   So it's quite likely that these could have been present in PIE, and that other languages lost them, with Dutch and German holding on to them to the present day.   Insofar as the mechanisms are concerned, one of the papers in that book I cited talks about how basically the preverbs end up in a spot where a verb would go in a thoroughly SOV language; that is, the preverbs are the part of the verb that is not shifted into the V2 position and occupying the head of the verb phrase node in the syntactic structure. You might find then that by looking into the development of V2, you will understand the development of separable preverbs in Germanic (but you may not be able to generalize it beyond the Germanic languages, as Old Irish was not-- to my knowledge, though I have no real sense of the history of the language, so take this as a hunch -- a V2 language, yet it had at least the separable prefix ro-)."
