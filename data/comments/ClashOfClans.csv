ClashOfClans,3dydd4,jkimtrolling,43,Mon Jul 20 17:36:08 2015 UTC,Well it's not that she breaks too few walls as she has a tendency to not enter the base even when walls are already broken.  It seems some units have a preference set for outside even when there are targets closer inside the base even when not blocked by walls.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,Pahnage,26,Mon Jul 20 20:11:00 2015 UTC,Like pekka? Yeah.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,TheWoodenPipe,11,Mon Jul 20 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I was trying out some pekkas and a jump spell. Put down the spell and then drop all four pekkas at once in theexact same spot  (hold and drop) even though the 3 or 4 buildings near them had all been cleardd by the king and queen that were outside the walls, only 1 pekka actually went over the walls. They all went into the spell, but only one actually used it. Very frustrating."
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,purpleclouds,4,Mon Jul 20 20:37:44 2015 UTC,Jump spell needs some attention after the recent update. It tends to be ignored with this new AI.

ClashOfClans,3dydd4,starsdust101,2,Tue Jul 21 10:43:38 2015 UTC,Barbarian King is the master at infuriating you by going around the base rather than through the empty path created for it towards the TH

ClashOfClans,3dydd4,aasteveo,3,Tue Jul 21 00:22:56 2015 UTC,That was the main unit i was thinking of.  Since this patch I have seen wallbreakers not run to a wall 5-6 tiles away that has buildings behind it but instead run like 20 spaces away to blow up a compartment without buildings.  It seems determined to blow up every outside compartment before going inside now.

ClashOfClans,3dydd4,atomicbob1,11,Tue Jul 21 15:12:22 2015 UTC,This isn't a case of people whining no matter what.  It's about AQ AI still being broken.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,Malcheon,14,Mon Jul 20 22:56:16 2015 UTC,Which is now becoming a viable war strategy. Lets make this happen!
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,lunchboxhero,62,Mon Jul 20 15:56:33 2015 UTC,Idea - use funnel troops to kill the buildings around the funnel so she doesn't do that.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,KnowsTheLaw,54,Mon Jul 20 17:43:32 2015 UTC,the funnel needs to be a quarter of the map though.  it is kind of ridiculous.  i did a gowiwi attack with 4 earthquake spells last war.  every single troop funneled into the core except the AQ.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,Claclink,22,Mon Jul 20 17:50:09 2015 UTC,Yes! I will drop a troop and it will walk right into the base. A millisecond later I drop the queen in the same spot and she dips off half way around the base to shoot and exterior building.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,ChiefChiefertons,20,Mon Jul 20 18:19:51 2015 UTC,that's just the downside that comes with her huge range
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,GoAraJjang,9,Mon Jul 20 20:07:15 2015 UTC,I don't think they intentionally made her this hard to funnel.  I think they overcorrected for her shooting at walls too often and now we are stuck with this.  I think they will tweak her AI in the next update and we will get some kind of happy medium I hope.  The gameplay in this game encourages players to predict where the troops will path.  the queen AI is by far the most difficult to predict and no one knows where she will go every time.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,Claclink,17,Mon Jul 20 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Even if you funnel, she will still do this. Like you can clear all the trash buildings outside the walls, and she will still walk around the walls shooting the first layer of defenses behind the walls."
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,WeenisWrinkle,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"Guys, adjust your funnel. Hit the a few of the outside buildings on each side to form a funnel break, then let your AQ/Pekkas kill the few buildings directly in front of the wall before heading into the base."
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,CaptainObvious1906,3,Mon Jul 20 22:17:55 2015 UTC,"Like you can clear all the trash buildings outside the walls, and she will still walk around the walls shooting the first layer of defenses behind the walls.   Did you not read my comment? I'm aware of how to funnel, but she still walks the base with an incredible funneling job."
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,WeenisWrinkle,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:12 2015 UTC,an incredible funneling job   Obviously it isn't?
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,Omamba,-46,Tue Jul 21 00:48:53 2015 UTC,Hmmm its kind of like how Hogriders wont go for townhalls during war until the defensive structures are gone..almost like....each troop...has different strategies.....and almost like they arent meant to be tactically genius troops? HMMMMMMM /s  EDIT: DOWNVOTE ME TO OBVLIVION YOU DEVOID OF STRATEGY MONGOLOIDS
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,MrJonHammersticks,7,Mon Jul 20 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"Well actually it's because the AQ, unlike any other troop in the game, can shoot over 2 squares(so if you had a structure surrounded by two sets of walls like an idiot, the queen will still be able to destroy said structure). Although this can be extremely beneficial some times, it allows her to go for structures she considers closer(Aq goes for the closest structure), and no one will follow her because they cannot (or they consider another thing closer because of they can only shoot over 1 wall) shoot over 1-2 walls layers."

Giants, wallbreakers, wave of barch, heroes, wave of barch, optional goblins... the giants destroy rows one and most of two, your heroes and barch are enough to take the core. Goblins move around the useless stuff and are surprisingly good at cutting through bases (Since they ignore most structures and move quickly). Heroes are wasted on outer layers, you want them and their abilities to snatch the loot and destroy the toughest defences."
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,ShouldersofGiants100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:32 2015 UTC,"I usually just use barch exclusively, so giants aren't a troop I usually have on me."
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,WeenisWrinkle,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:49 2015 UTC,You should. Core diving is where the real loot can be found and giants let you hit much higher bases with the only cost being elixir. Giants are actually faster building than archers on a per housing space basis.
ClashOfClans,3dydd4,ShouldersofGiants100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:21 2015 UTC,"I actually core dive with barch really effectively.

ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,-kemosabe,38,Mon Jul 20 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"Depending on what your long term goals are for the game, you might be better off upgrading now.  If you are war only, maxing th9 (or going 9.5) might make sense.  If your goal is to max heroes and your base in general ASAP, I think you're in an awesome place to start TH10.  It is true that gold and elixir are worse, but farming DE is so much easier at TH10.  It is much easier in my opinion to keep both heroes upgrading as a th10 than it is as a th9.  Besides the improved DE farming you can keep all your builders and your lab working.  As someone else said, heroes are the largest bottleneck, but every minute that your lab isn't going and your builders are slacking of is another minute that max th10 gets farther away.    The most important thing to remember is that this is a game, not a job.  If grinding at th9 for another 6+ months doesn't seem fun and going th10 now does, well then I recommend you do what keeps the game fun."

ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Rijjle,3,Mon Jul 20 19:55:37 2015 UTC,As someone currently grinding lavas... they do have one major edge. They are an absolute nightmare for barchers. It takes three wallbreakers to destroy them or a lot of time. Either of those can either break a raid early or make them skip entirely. If you don't mind the grind... its got definite advantages.
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,ShouldersofGiants100,3,Mon Jul 20 20:08:16 2015 UTC,I yesterday saw the light (the truth about walls). If you upgrade from lego to lava; your defense behind the walls gains 1500hp. Just think about it.  Edit: and the animations man!
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Lanceloet,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. Lavas are a massive deterrent. High level walls make average defences imposing... if you have high level defaces, you can turn it into an all out slaughter for anything but a war army. Walls are basically only weak against air attacks and hogs. Against normal people doing normal raids... unless they are willing to drop every spell, they're not getting much."
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,ShouldersofGiants100,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"Of course its an advantage,  everyone knows that but not everyone got time for that.

ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,GoAraJjang,0,Mon Jul 20 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure farming de is easier at th10. Most of the easy de farm is from core diving th8s, and since th10s get a 50% penalty on th8s you won't be able to hit them for as lucrative of a gain anymore. Sure, you get a bit more army space and an extra drill, but overall I think th9 is better for de."
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Rijjle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"But th8s have so little de. Best case scenario, how much de can you make as a th9 core diving a th8? 1500 maybe?  Against a th9 or th10 1500 de is the absolute minimum I need to see before dropping a troop. If there is a way to farm th8s for more de than th9s and th10s that is news to me."
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Syll0gism,16,Mon Jul 20 21:32:23 2015 UTC,What makes farming DE easier at th10?
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Josh3415,16,Tue Jul 21 01:55:24 2015 UTC,3rd drill and better troops
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Rijjle,12,Tue Jul 21 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"A few very major things.   Higher level troops.  Whatever farming army you use at TH9, it gets way better at TH10.  Barb, arch, giant, minion, wizard and goblin all get much stronger and farming in general gets much easier. More camp space.  The extra 20 spaces helps a TON, especially with the improved troops.   Extra spell.  When farming for DE, expect to use a lot of spells, and the extra spell space helps a ton. Your Heroes are upgrading so the above becomes really important.  One of the biggest complaints about farming DE is that Heroes are essential to farm, but you need to farm to upgrade heroes, but it is hard to farm with heroes upgrading...  having the improved offense offsets this a ton. Better defense.  It is easier to keep your DE if your defense is better. Extra DE drill. Loot penalty doesn't matter.  This is where things get interesting.  Penalty against TH8 and below makes it pretty useless to attack them for loot, and that is the correct argument for gold and elixir.  However, TH8 and below have so little DE that it doesn't really matter.  TH9s and TH10s have all the DE and that penalty can be ignored.   So you have a better, bigger army, with more spells, you can better defend your DE and you make more as well.  Plus, the people you are farming DE off of, you don't suffer a real loot penalty against."

ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,redditM_rk,3,Mon Jul 20 17:24:21 2015 UTC,Third drill is a huge help and for myself and most of my clan mates that pulled the trigger farming DE has been a lot easier at TH 10 than 9.  If you don't upgrade defenses and just do offense it will really help you in wars too.  Only draw back is if you don't personally have the same luck we've had at TH 10 you can't really turn back.

ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Shawn_Spenstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:06 2015 UTC,Valks just aren't that specialized. They are a decent mix of tank and attack power... but they don't really fill any niche that other units cannot fill better. With the DE cost better put to other uses... they're always going to get neglected.
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,vI_M4YH3Mz_Iv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:18 2015 UTC,"Max valks are core exploders. At th9 there is no base that can't be 2 starred with mass valks and very few bases that can't be 3 starred with them. The only thing that stops valks are infernos and since th9 don't get infernos they can literally stomp an entire base with just 2 heals. I'm curios what niche other units fill better? Pekkas cost more housing, are slower and only hit a single target and do less damage. Giants tank a tad better and target defenses but are far slower do single target damage and no splash. Hogs are good but get raped by double giant bombs which do not even phase valks. There are other good units, but anyone who says valks aren't worth upgrading either dont know how to use them or still have level 1/2 only."
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,Lincolnius,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"It's not individual units so much as combinations. Gowiwi has all the benefits of valks without the main disadvantages (Fewer units=fewer targets). Plus... their main disadvantage is that they aren't useful until heavily upgraded. Gowiwi with level 1 golems and witches is viable and the upgrades just make they tougher. Lower level Valks aren't useful and the simple fact is that having to pay 100 K DE just to make a unit functional is a bit steep. If you have extra DE, definitely worth it... but there are better investments that pay dividends immediately."
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,ClashIsLif3,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:37 2015 UTC,"Gowiwi with level 1 golems is absolutely not viable against th9s unless they are brand spanking new or you consider 1-2 stars max viable. A gowiwi with level 1 golem against a mid to max th9 would get decimated.   Plus... their main disadvantage is that they aren't useful until heavily upgraded.   Kind of like balloons? Which are useless until level 5 when they become ok, then at max they become amazing...   Lower level Valks aren't useful and the simple fact is that having to pay 100 K DE just to make a unit functional is a bit steep.   Once again just like balloons or giants, up to level 5 giants and loons are pretty trash, once you get to that big jump at 5/6 they all of sudden become useful. Im not saying its not harder to farm since its de instead of elixir, but they are definitely worth the investment especially if done at th9."
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,allthegoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"Ballon upgrades are cheap and use elixir. They get done just to get rid of Elixir at early THs when you can't do so fast enough. Giants are still quite useful at lower levels, just not phenomenal. These upgrades are cheap and using a relatively plentiful resource... Valks require sacrificing upgrades that provide more immediate benefits. TH 9 has massive costs of DE already... any upgrade that doesn't immediately net results isn't great."
ClashOfClans,3dyp4t,mahchefai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"Lvl 2 valks is a th8 upgrade. Upgrading to level 3 provides an immediate net result, upgrading to lvl 4 provides even bigger results. Yes they take de to upgrade which could be used for heroes or other things I'm not saying your first upgrade at th9 should be valks to 3 then 4.

ClashOfClans,3dycev,S3AN10,2,Tue Jul 21 06:53:03 2015 UTC,Drop trophies. C2 is pretty high for a TH9 without max defenses IMHO. In lower trophy ranges you will get sniped.

ClashOfClans,3e03lp,beer_nachos,2,Tue Jul 21 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"Right I mean now. I kinda figure champs 3 is a perfect farming spot now. Going from masters 1 to champs 3 is +40k+40k+300 whereas another 300 trophies to get into champs 2 only nets an additional +10k+10k+100. It's the best bang for your trophy push.  For that reason, pretty much anyone going above champs 3 is pushing for even higher. People sitting down here in champs 3 are farming for the sweet loot bonus. Farmers (like me) often leave the th out for the snipe even at champ 3.  I've been doing this a while now (pretty much since the update) and have found that it's amazing to just snipe up here. I always carry troops capable of tanking traps just in case, but usually it's clear. I only snipe. I don't even look at the loot and consider whether I can take the base. Faster just to click through if I see a center th so I can do this while watching tv, browsing reddit, etc."

When comparing to masters 1, I think the difference in the number of snipes will be minimal so long as you stay under 3200 trophies while you keep your champion tag.  Earlier today I had to chain-surrender from 3430 trophies all the way back down to under 3150 in order to keep the snipes at a good level. I made a bunch of people very happy. lol"

If you're unlucky, you build up loot only to get steamrolled for loot and for trophies. TH 8 and 9 you're probably better off in the 1900 range... high enough you can get the crystal loot bonus (Hit 2000, drop slightly once a season, as long as you don't drop below 1900, you keep the bonus), while still heaving plenty of TH 8s and 7s you can take loot from. It's also paradise for shields... any decent base with and exposed TH is more likely to get sniped by trophy pushers than raided. As you go higher, there are fewer bases you can actually hit and more people who can 2 or 3 star you for trophies and loot."

He can start working his way solidly into C3 as he goes. I avoid going over 2050 though. There is a precipitous drop in loot. Too many pushers sniping all the bases with loot... but just below that, you have the bases too low to get matched with C2 and too tough for the TH 7s and 8s in Gold to consistently beat.

I recommended our th8s live in gold or crystal for loot bonus and always offer the th. the higher you go, the quicker someone is willing to shield you when you log off.   I spent the entirety of my 50%-95% completion of Th9 at masters 3-1 raiding for loot bonus. 50%, snipes, collector raids that show up occasionally. it's the most efficient way to get the de you need for leaders and upgrades while maxing defenses since the real throttle necks are leaders, walls, and research"
ClashOfClans,3e03lp,Ellorindas,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with shoulders and would like to add an additional caveat.  As a maxed TH8, if you have any loot at all you need to expect to get 3*ed every time you log off.  This means that you cannot casually play for a bit of time, get a snipe, and log off without dropping in trophies precipitously.  This play style will only work if you have extended periods of time where you can be on to get a bunch of snipes so that can manage your trophy level.  In contrast, a mid-late TH9 with an exposed TH will more than likely just get sniped.  So at TH9, you can log on, snipe a TH or 2, and log off.  It makes the game much more casual."

Reason being you'll still get sniped with your TH outside the vast majority of the time in M2 as a TH9n(just because the loot bonus is worth more than using an entire army to go after your loot and the 2nd star on a TH9 base). However all TH9s can 3 star a TH8, so they'll generally prefer to steam-roll a TH8 when they see it for the trophies."

I'm surprised that just a 100 trophies should make a difference!  Edit: I should also add that this adds to one of my previous posts - my confusion over the lack of exposed town halls in masters. I don't understand why people are trying to defend so high up, since people will next over your base until someone sees you who can smash you to bits. At the very least, if you protect your Town Hall someone will probably go for 50% and take a chunk of your loot. Expose your Town halls people!"

ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,theelement6,17,Mon Jul 20 13:21:29 2015 UTC,"Looks like a nice base, I think the best way to attack it would be a shattered laloon from the north to east line, but that's a hard attack to pull off unless you have nicely leveled royals. I'm unsure if your bombs would both set off in your double sets with a surgical goho so I'd like to see that, but still. Nicely done."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,amessofamind,7,Mon Jul 20 14:23:52 2015 UTC,Thanks! My edited base (see the original description) hopefully addressed that pathing issue.
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,ddbb1105,19,Mon Jul 20 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"So I decided I'd try my hand at building my own anti-3 star base. I have problems at the moment with wiz towers being in range of the air defenses, but can't adjust that without putting wiz towers on the perimeter, which I also don't want.  Features:   Surprise tesla DGB trap Heavy HP buildings to the south (to hopefully slow down anyone going for 2) Pretty hard to lure CC (might need help making it ""UNlureable"" CC) ""Death Funnel"" set up behind the TH. That came about accidentally as I needed an extra wall. Took one away and realized that any defense-led troops would walk down the tunnel to the sweeper, getting fired on by all sides.   What do you think?  Edit #1: Version 1.2 (Pathing adjustments for dgbs, harder lure, and other minor adjustments.)  Edit #2: Attacker's View if interested"
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,HHH_TexasLights,10,Mon Jul 20 13:25:27 2015 UTC,"looks pretty sweet! one thing for your DGB spots. Make sure hogs have no other option than triggering both at the same time because they have to cross them at the same time. right now the might get triggered once at a time.  northern dgb: WIZ tower-->tesla. trigger 1 bomb southern dgb: AS-->tesla-->Xbow/AT, might also just trigger 1 bomb.  Also is that 1 Xbow set to ground?  Hope that helps ;)"
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,HHH_TexasLights,4,Mon Jul 20 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"It does, quite a bit thanks! A clanmate noticed the same thing. Hopefully that fixed the pathing. Check out my edited post for the new version.  Also, yeah the south xbow is set to ground. Laloon is pretty rare these days and I think most attacks will be ground attacks from the south. I want to get as much dps pointed in that direction as I can to melt it all down, hopefully preventing 50%."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,californiapie,3,Mon Jul 20 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"No one would attack from the south if trying to 3* this base.  The attack would come from the north west.  If you're trying to defend against hogs, you might want to concentrate your spring traps to better defend against surgical hogs.  Similarly, you may want to separate your king from your queen for similar reasons.  King is pretty useless against a kill squad but can sometimes shine when left to hit hogs."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,30gd4n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:27 2015 UTC,"Good call on the BK. I'll see what I can come up with.  Nobody is going to come from the south for a 3 star, I get that. Spreading the HP out wouldn't make much difference in preventing a 3 anyway, so I put it all down there to slow people down going for 2."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,quantumjello,2,Mon Jul 20 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"Spreading the HP out could make a huge difference preventing a 3*.  You want your CC/AQ to hit an incoming kill squad while the kill squad is occupied shooting at one or more storages and/or when separated from tanks.  Similarly, you want defensive structures hitting the kill squad while the kill squad is shooting storages.  IMO, putting all your storages on the S/SW side makes this base easier to kill than if you had them spread out a bit more.  I think you can come up with a bit better arrangement on the north west side.  Specifically, try to setup your defenses/storages to separate the tanks from the Wiz/heroes of a kill squad."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,quantumjello,6,Mon Jul 20 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"I think your base is falls into the traditional anti-3 if there was such a thing. It's better than 9/10 bases, but if you want your base to be exquisite, you have to make some adjustments.   For one, having a centralized AQ isn't necessarily the best option. Since any attacker is going to take her out beforehand, I find that your best bet is to offset her toward one side so the attackers only have one half of the base to approach her from. If you put her smack in the middle, attackers can theoretically approach her from any angle because it's the same distance to her. This makes your base more vulnerable to every type of attack because it gives the attacker options. Maybe you put those 4 teslas and BK to prevent a shattered golaloon from the SW, but then it makes your base really weak to hogs because someone can dump 3 golems and take out a lot of defenses and a DGB, or two.   Secondly, I think your DGB are outdated. With surgical hogs becoming more and more prevalent, good attackers likely won't lose 5+ hogs to a DGB. Furthermore, if your DGB are in the core of your base, but the hogs destroy all the surrounding defenses by the time they reach it, even if they all die to a DGB it won't matter if your KS stays alive because they'll be able to handle cleanup and the 1 or 2 defenses that stayed up. When defending hogs, think how you can kill them in chunks and where the attacker has to heal. One DGB isn't going to blow up 20 hogs, and if it does, then they guy has no business hogging anyway. Single GBs/WTs/teslas/springs/BK are all other really great defenses against hogs if combined to make little 'anti-hog' sections. Surgical hogs fail, when one section of the base fails to get taken out because all the hogs have to backtrack and kill defenses that they weren't supposed to have to deal with. If all your 'sections' are the same, then it makes your base pretty straightforward to hog. Dragonflower sucks because all the DPS is evenly dispersed. But when you find the guy who puts all his teslas in one quadrant, then you just send in your KS with 3 golems from that angle and it's over. In your base, you only really have 1 defense against hogs which is the springs. All your teslas, BK, DGB would be taken out with 3 golems making the rest of your base pretty easy to surgical hog.  I would recommend offsetting your AQ and putting the BK and teslas away from her so the KS won't take them out.   Your base is good, but I just think your missing out some of the newer meta aspects. It's too predictable and it gives attackers too many options. If you put all your storages and BK by the two most accesible AD, then that should be a red light to any attacker NOT to golaloon from that angle. You obviously expected them to send in their hybrid from that angle which means you should have baited the rest of the base, like having SAMs on opposite ADs, which you do. It's so easy to spot the SAMs on some anti-3 bases (dragonflower) because they're usually just opposite the TH or all the storages. If they realize you baited the SW, then why not just do a shattered golaloon from the NE? There's not much DPS and it's a great tradeoff (2 WT, 4 SAMs).   Any other questions, feel free to ask."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,cmun777,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to put together such a detailed response. Validating that this is indeed a good base in need of some adjustments helps more than you'd think. Reading some other responses, it feels like I just spent all that time developing something a blind monkey could gowipe for 3*.  Anyway, I hear what you're saying. I'd love to see an example of what you're talking about though. To do what you're suggesting would require either a) an entire overhaul of the base or b) a weakening of the base elsewhere, giving it a lesser grade than what you were helpful enough to give.  tl;dr Thanks for validating my own impression of the base. Not sure how to implement those modifications without causing a critical fault elsewhere."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,michigrind,2,Mon Jul 20 21:40:33 2015 UTC,As Cheif_ddbb1105 said your DGB spots are not good at all; make sure that hogs will trip both bombs at same time. Also CB/shattered strats will likely come in from W or N side since there are too many high HP buildings in S; as a consequence this may annihilate either one of your DGB spots or a double SAM protected AD => not good for protecting against hog or laloon backend !  Last point is that you have too much point defenses which can be aggroed with one giant on outer ring => easy surgical hogs !
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,tikiibob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"I just uploaded ver. 1.2 that addresses the pathing issue. Many (most?) bases I've seen like this have used the point defenses on the outer ring. Without them, the CC becomes too lurable imo."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,tikiibob,2,Mon Jul 20 14:51:08 2015 UTC,"Very easy shatter from the northeast compartment containing your AT/WT/Mortar.  The only point defense attackers really need to deal with is a single AT, and then the xbow when jumped into the core.  Both ADs are taken out here with a WT and the only air target Xbow, making a LL very very easy.  I see your double airmines are also on these air defs, these would be neutralized.  When your queen is so centralized, you give up forcing the attack from a particular angle; instead attackers can come from any angle they want to hit you  Also a jump spell can go here and reach all the way into your queen/CC compartment http://i.imgur.com/6G9tZs5.png  There are really no fake DGB pockets so both packs can be guessed very easily; also since they are both almost directly on top of the queen they can be taken out by the hybrid part of the attack  I would also advise on spreading your high hp storages more around the ring of your base, you really have them clustered down by your town hall and almost no dps to punish anything attacking them anyways"
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,ImJustLurkingBro,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure why you'd want me to pull the most important defense out of the core. Moving the AQ anywhere would mean it would be easy to kill.  Jump spells do not cross both walls where the gap between them is 4 blocks. Jump's reach across 5 only.  There are plenty of fake dgb spots, though yes, only 2 really make perfect sense. Even then, 1 of those spots isn't visible to the first attacker because there's a tesla there."
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,ImJustLurkingBro,3,Mon Jul 20 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"Attackers are going to get your queen no matter what, so you have to make it so they don't get much of anything else with her.  Base meta at th9 lately has been offset queen to force attacks from one particular angle; centralize her and attackers can come from any angle they want to get her"
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,JCBDoesGaming,4,Mon Jul 20 18:14:06 2015 UTC,What quantumjello said as far as th9 base meta as well as you have a misunderstanding of new jump spell mechanics... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ0NOUuTOf4
ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,Ayr1,4,Tue Jul 21 01:24:36 2015 UTC,"This is looking very good already. I know how hard it is to come up with such a base and how much time it takes to make adjustments over and over again. So good job!  Despite you said you think air attacks are unlikely, I'd still set the 2nd X-Bow to air & ground. Also I'd change the position and direction of your air sweepers so they cover a bigger part of the base. I found out that the air sweepers are much more effective somewhere in the center than on the outer side of the base. Located in the center they slow down an air attack and if set up correctly they might also push air troops off track. The way you have them now they just shut down one side of your base which is not that big of a deal for the attacker in my opinion.  Edit: Oh and I saw another thing which might be a weakness of your base: If I were trying to hog your base, I'd send in my queen kill squad from 10 o'clock. This would let me set off the DGB with my king (or other troops). So in order to prevent that you might want to move your DGBs out of a possible queen kill squad path..."

ClashOfClans,3dxyhd,zach22zach22,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"If they aren't the first attacker, they would simply replace the poison with haste to help their loons out then.

ClashOfClans,3dziic,eyewideshut,2,Mon Jul 20 21:26:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the podcast link. It really opened my eyes on how the war community looks like and is at. It's unfortunate to how it got but I can understand both sides of the argument.

Him and Hulk constantly say that if theres a top war clan, their th10s most likely mod. It's been in the dark before, everyone was aftraid to talk about it, it was always an issue and clearly it wont go away any time soon, they shed light on this subject its pretty much out of the question now, most top war clans cheat, clean clans have no chance to compete with them."

ClashOfClans,3dziic,Moonlight6,8,Mon Jul 20 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"There's two threads on the supercell forums that rank top mixed war clans. The first is the slightly more popular one that ranks clans that war with 8+ th10s, found here. Unfortunately, due to the state of the game, all of those clans, except maybe one or two at the bottom, have at least a few modders. I think Kara's Heroes and Siddiqui's might be clean, but I wouldn't bet on it. The rest all mod. If this is news to you, I'm sorry; it sucks and I hate it too.   The other thread ranks 'lightweight' mixed clans, or clans that war with less than 7 th10s regularly. That's here. Of those clans, I know North Remembers, OneHive, and OneHive2.0 have no-modding policies, so you're probably looking at those as the top clean war clans. Winternvrcame is also pretty good, although still getting on their feet after the CrystalWarrior thing, and I'm pretty sure they have a policy against modding. Not sure about the skyrim clans."
ClashOfClans,3dziic,SSOLM,5,Tue Jul 21 02:11:42 2015 UTC,Kara Heroes are not clean. How do i know ? I used to be in that clan

I honestly wouldn't mind having modding clans and clean clans that even occasionally face each other, but the problem is the guys who use but don't admit it.  I don't u derstanding their motives first off, but that's beside the point. If this game wants to stay around for awhile, super cell has to figure out how to handle these issues. The only way it will last is in the competitive sphere. There is a reason every top pmtriphy pusher always quits after, because they get fame (I guess? Idk) and then have nothing else to do.   Organized, competitive clan action is the only thing that will keep people here for years plz, SC"
ClashOfClans,3dziic,mastrdestruktun,2,Tue Jul 21 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"I understand their motives.  In terms of reputation, they want to look better, like elective plastic surgery for people who otherwise look normal.  People often base their self esteem too much on how they appear to others.  In terms of ability, it's like athletes using steroids.  They are willing to do whatever it takes to win, even if it's against the rules, even if they are not actually good enough to compete at a high level.  I don't mod, but I empathize.  Who doesn't want to be more awesome?  If you want it more than you want to follow the rules, then you mod."
ClashOfClans,3dziic,zskuld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"I empathize too, and I know that as long as supercell isn't banning people then they will continue doing it.   As soon as the banhammer starts coming down, people will probably just find other ways to cheat in sandboxxed servers, though. It's unfortunate"
ClashOfClans,3dziic,this_is_notmyopinion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound harsh, but I don't empathize. In too many ways, we make apologies for people who cheat. In sports, we make excuses for those who use banned substances. We'll say that he has hit the most home-runs or ran the fastest time, that you cant take that away from him, even if he/she got caught. We'll mark the record down but add an asterisk. We'll make excuses about how much pressure there is, about how everybody does it. We value the thrill of the win more than the honesty of the person. In business and politics, we'll make excuses for those who break the rules to gain an advantage. We accept that as normal.  We shouldn't.

ClashOfClans,3dziic,this_is_notmyopinion,3,Tue Jul 21 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree. They're all great attackers and strategists, no doubt.  But I'm just wondering if some of their abilities might not be as strong as those who don't mod, precisely because they're not used to doing it cleanly. I'm not sure. I'm nowhere near that level myself. I'm just wondering if creating another forum for battles where no modding could be done (like the ClashCon or in-person tournaments) could help to take the glory out of modding because there they would be clean wins."
ClashOfClans,3dziic,Architectron,0,Tue Jul 21 18:06:11 2015 UTC,At first I thought you meant clean as in language...

What makes us ahead of everyone is our ability to 3 star maxed th10s. You can micromanage everything else but you can't take that away from us.   Now I'm also an YouTuber and let me tell you bunch of those strategies start at my channel,you can see them one day at mine channel and few days after on so called clean channels. But one more important fact is if you saw a th10 3star on a maxed df design base let me tell you it's modded. It's almost impossible to do it without any help. All you that say it's possible well its not. Bunch of oh people are known modders now, and few of people that left willingly are in ch now and they're racking 3s as mad.   Hate it, love it, its part of game now. If you want to be a top clean clan toss out all those th10s out and then u can be one, although that's not fun :)  You can dislike it as much as u want, we don't gloat around, we just keep doing our thing.

This is not something you can possibly get an answer to. Of course, lots of clans will say they are clean, but often they don't know. Until you go to everyones device and check, you can't tell if they are using a mod program or not. It's quite easy to hide it."
ClashOfClans,3dziic,Arestheneko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Of course no clan can guarantee that none of their members are cheating, but if a clan's leadership is publicly fair play, and does everything they can to kick anyone who's caught cheating in their clan, then that's the best you can do.   Also modding and other forms of cheating is either openly endorsed or purposely overlooked by basically all of the top mixed clans in the game. I think this could actually increase the amount of truly fair play clans out there, since I believe most people who want to mod are just going to go to a clan that is alright with it.  Also since things like practicing on other bases are enhanced if you get someone to help you cheat (where they build the base with the traps so you can practice on it), this form of cheating is seriously nerfed in a fair play clan no one would be allowed to openly speak about it."

Would look sick to see that armor glisten with war fire and explosion...also the rage. Think about it, he rages and his battle scars begin to heal as the old wound flesh peels and flies away while his new one instantly settled in, along his booming war cry. I would love to see the final. He just slams the tip through the other king's chest and armor, and out the other end after a fight of punches, sword swinging (and perhaps some damage to walls or structures nearby after some missed moves), with a grim, bloody result before it shows his impalement, the stern and slight look of discomfort of the slayer before joining up with his army. Then black, the dead barb King is up on his feet after a good overnight rest :) **edit: wanted to put out what imagined instead of just a brief summary."

She barely batted her eye as a tesla melted the P.E.K.K.A next to her. She was the symbol of victory to any attacker. She was hope. Her attention was only caught when the enemy x-bow activated and began a steady but vicious volley against the Larrys. It was time. She could hear the deafening cheers of the men behind her as she slowly raised her own bow. It was time. The dragons quickly got into position in preparation. It was time. With a great shout she aimed her xbow, and fired against the wall. Her men cheered! The wall crumbled like it was nothing. She aimed at the next wall. and the next. and the next. and the next. FUS ROH DAH!!!  Blinded by her war rage it was a while before she looked up again. All her men were dead. The archer tower stood standing. The Wizard tower stood standing. The tesla tower stood standing. There was a cold silence as they all aimed at her. At least she got all the walls. She felt complete.  You and this army."

Make sure you destroy the buildings surrounding the bottom, as the pekkas with the new AI will go around the base rather than going to the core.

ClashOfClans,3dv6n2,sassythecat,48,Sun Jul 19 20:25:59 2015 UTC,problem is that most of these knockoffs dont get popular enough to warrant a suit. The companies that make these knockoffs just constantly scan for rising/already popular games and then create their own almost carbon copy and skim some profits before moving onto the next project. They spam the app stores with these copied apps and that's how they can get by.

My wife's an IP attorney, so she just basically buries anyone that tries to sue him in paper such that it's not worth their time to respond to all of his shit.   It's kind of a shitty business model, but it's also hilarious, sometimes I file the responses and shit for my wife, or if someone actually wants to go to the IP courts in East Texas to fight her motions in person, my wife will send me out there because I'm a barred attorney, except I'm mostly a stay at home husband, it's really hilarious, and I also have nothing better to do so I just go out there and argue it. If I lose, no biggie, we just settle it for basically nothing anyway.   My wife's firm is pretty hilarious though, her partner at the is pretty much a professional patent troll, dude is a fucking genius, has Ph.D in EE and a law degree and that's what he does instead of being productive with his life. He has been buying huge books of patents since probably the 80's, and then hires these other dudes to essentially figure out who is using what parts of what patents, and then he has a team of paralegals that just send out letters telling people they need to pay him a royalty.   I asked him why he didn't actually desire to make or build something, like of value, and he said ""well, all the money I make is valuable to me."" lol."

ClashOfClans,3dv6n2,dahui9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"Prof. Marc Galanter actually had some really interesting papers on this phenomenon; he basically referred to these types of lawyers as ""repeat players."" Generally speaking ""repeat players"" are basically industrialists playing around in the legal world, and they get really, really good at basically ""mass producing"" law or legal work product, if that makes any sense. I think most people that work in ""creditor's rights"" tend to be these kind of motion factories, but there are many areas where it is the case. Most civil defense firms are similar, so are insurance practice area attorneys, and oddly enough criminal prosecutors. I can't remember if it was Galanter or someone else whose law review article I was reading that noted that the rise of ""word processing"" led to greater and greater ""returns to scale"" of this type of work, and posited that a rise in computing power and data manipulation would really lead to more. I think whoever it was that said it was definitely right.   You can basically create situations where you have programs that can essentially take client questionnaires and create various claims forms, without a lawyer getting in the way. Then you just need to be barred to file them. Over and over and over again.     Anyway, you know what's really weird, people like that end up knowing the state's rules of ethics and professional conduct better than virtually anyone else.   I've got a buddy that got tired of the criminal law game because you pretty much can't try to collect on clients without getting a complaint to the ethics board; he ended up learning the rules of ethics to defend himself so well that he ended up making it his practice area. He's like a lawyer for lawyers."

ClashOfClans,3dz3e7,Roddy14,4,Mon Jul 20 18:40:22 2015 UTC,Jackie planned his hog pathing so that a massive pack of hogs would end up at that junction.

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Rioben,8,Mon Jul 20 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"yeah really just handling the deployment better I guess. I just didn't notice as many drags in the CC before so it wasn't much of an issue, but since the level 5 update seems like showing up a lot more and I've been fucking it up."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,SamsquamtchHunter,9,Mon Jul 20 16:13:21 2015 UTC,I think it has more to do with the poison spell wiping out cc troops than the level 5 drags being available.

This basically puts the dragon into a situation where his aoe breath is useless and he has to kill archers 1 by 1 abusing his re-target delay."

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,dharasick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"Dragons are fairly easy to kill as long as you have the troops, and have the space on the map to do it (where your squad isn't getting picked off, or targeting buildings instead)  TH9 should bring 2 witches, 2 wizards, few archers.    If witches aren't an option, you'll probably need 20 level 5 archers, and a couple wizards.  You'll lose most/all of those troops, however, which is why witches are by far the better way to go.  Once the dragon is dead, you'll still have those witches alive.    If you only have level 4 archers, you're better off raging through it with your own dragons."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,CD_4M,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"I bring a lvl5 drag in my CC with 1 max wizard and 1 archer (I'm TH8)   Lure out the drag and bring it away from the base a bit, then drop your CC.

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,dharasick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I might start doing this, sounds more valuable than the 5 extra hogs in cc"
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,bradpifff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yea I've tried both and find the drag in my CC better than the 5 max hogs. Lvl4 hogs are enough to take down 95% of TH8 bases anyway, and the lvl5, or even lvl4, dragon in my CC makes killing the enemy CC a slam dunk."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Praising_the_Sun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:34 2015 UTC,Drag might not be the best clean up troop.
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,bradpifff,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"The dragon isn't for clean up, it's to kill the enemy CC.   But, if the dragon survives with a bit of health it's actually a good clean up troop, doesn't get stopped by walls and deals quick damage to large storages.   For clean up I bring 5 wizards, 10 archers, 10 minions."

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,ShouldersofGiants100,4,Mon Jul 20 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"I bring 2 witches and a Barb in my CC.

That's the standard IMO."

As well as 40% of their war participants coming form other top clans such as troopers and onehive and more. The matchup was a complete surprise to everyone in Viper. All they had to do was ask for a matchup and a smaller war without pulling from other clans could have been organized. Instead they decided to go the route that will systematically destroy their reputation and any respect the community has for them. They acted like douchers through the whole thing."
ClashOfClans,3dxtsk,aeroaggie2003,10,Mon Jul 20 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"The spy thing was a surprise and a disappointment, but to his credit, after we let him back in he made two solid attacks for us before leaving.  Lithium didn't get us all on the first try either, so I believe them when they say they didn't take screenshots or use that to their advantage.  As I've said before, when you put up 139 stars in a 45v45, that's impressive no matter who you are.  They uncovered weaknesses in our own bases and put a lot of really strong attacks on display too.

Bringing in better players: We brought in one TH9 (that being Paris from OneHive 2.0), for the sole reason to match the weights. The rest of the 40% were TH8s and 8.5s who did not perform well at all, and I'd even go as far as saying they performed badly. We got them simply because we didn't have our own to participate.  Had a spy: A spy to get war weights, simply put, which was the only reason. Viper leadership let him back in to do his attacks, which he gave his best effort in and out performed other Viper players. He was kicked during prep day, but Viper leadership agreed to let him back in to do his attacks and kicked him after he had finished attacking. As we've also said before, we did not see their bases, as it wouldn't even be fun knowing where everything was on the first attack. Half of the excitement in a first attack is scouting the base and finding out if you're right or wrong on where you guessed the bombs were, or the teslas, or whatever it may be.  Fun: Not a war against a clan with 22 TH10s while we have 3, all with infernos in which they don't try and we have two days of boredom. Which we happen to be going through right now.

It sucks too, because when you plan out an attack, how many troops, what are their purpose in the raid, where are they going to go after they kill a building; it doesn't leave room for error, and when their is that one thing that can go wrong, I end up with a 0-1-star.

ClashOfClans,3e0sci,Boratkan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"I did loonion with a mix of 20 lvl5 balloons and 50 lvl3 minions to get trophies.  I went for town hall 8s through crystal 2ish, but once you get to crystal 1 it's pretty much impossible to find good town hall 8s that give good trophies.  instead I hit bad town halls 9 for 2 stars and about 20 trophies.    The key I found was finding good bases with 30 trophies that had offset town halls, low queens, or Xbox facing down, or some combination of those.  Take poisons for cc obviously.  Somebody suggested boosting for the last 100 trophies and that helped.  As far as  defense.  I had a defensive base but rarely rarely won a defense, so instead I would leave your town hall out and lose trophies to sniping, or do a trap base.  I heard those work but maybe not nearly as well as they do for th 9s.    Good luck though.  it sucked when I did it, especially because I don't think sniping for 100 nexts is fun, and that is what a lot of people suggested.  It's rough as a town hall 8 though, so I hope you can do it."

Someone on here mentioned that they GoWiPed to push to masters and I tried that, and made it within a day. Go for guaranteed 10+ trophies and leave your townhall outside and pray you get sniped. In that case you're only losing 1-4 or so. It's not ridiculously fast but it doesn't require being logged in for hours on end, which is kind of nice."
ClashOfClans,3e0sci,RememberTheFattening,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:28:49 2015 UTC,Make it near the end of TH8 with the elixir and DE surplus. There is nothing I can spend mine one so I cook drag and hog armies and go for 3 stars. It takes longer to cook but its quicker going for 3 stars than sniping and improves war attacks on the way. Thats how I'm at Masters as a th8. Just leave town hall outside untrapped and decorated. You lose 1-10 trophies but then attack and gain 20-30. Its a paddling. 8 drag 8 loon 3 lightning 31/3 hog 4 wiz rest barch 3 heal  If I don't have elixir or DE barch th7 or 8 for 50%.

ClashOfClans,3e0sci,CynicScientist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:48:02 2015 UTC,"It's possible, because i did it as a th8. I would recommend cooking up a war army twice a day and going for the biggest trophy offer that you know you can either 50%, take the town hall, or both. Eventually it will reach a point where the offers you can win against dry up. This strat has the benefit of getting you solid experience with the war army against tough bases which might be harder than you're matched against in war.  It becomes a lot easier as a th9, because of the access to level 6 giants who are effectively mini golems, and can be trained quickly and cheaply."

Give it another month or two for people to start upgrading them and using them regularly to really gain a grasp of it.  The best thing we can see so far is that it works well when you don't need the damage boost from rage (so xbows wouldn't be viable for haste as much as rage would). Otherwise, use haste. Compacted defenses? Drop a haste on it. Spread out defenses? Haste.  It's viable so long as you don't need the damage boost rage offers. That's the main difference, and I think one of several reasons they up'd the building HP. Plan accordingly."

ClashOfClans,3e1umq,aasteveo,4,Tue Jul 21 08:47:02 2015 UTC,"we call it ""weight""  Each building, from elixir pump thing to air defense to xbows gets a corresponding number/weight. Same goes for troops, walls, everything.   The system adds the numbers up, does the same for your clanmates, then searches for a clan with similar numbers for a matchup..   The longer the search takes, the greater the difference between the numbers is allowed.   As far as ""fudging"" the numbers go, yes, this is done. Defenseless accounts, TH8.5/9.5, these are essentially just for favorable war matchups.   A defenseless account has an artificially low weight because it has nearly no guns, but offensively can deal a good amount of damage (hit higher)  TH9s do the 8.5 route because it allows them to catch up troop wise while being rated closer to a max TH8- xbows and infernos carry a great deal of weight, so holding off on building those as long as possible is a good thing for wars.."

ClashOfClans,3e1umq,Bml2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:09:52 2015 UTC,"This video by Moskri might help explain it. Like /u/The_Black_Inside said, defenses, walls, heroes and traps all contribute to the ""weight"" of your village, but also your troops and their levels, though to a lesser extent.  Hence upgrading or building new things will increase your weight, and thus the general strength of opponent you will face. This obviously shows that you can't just gain an advantage over your opponent by standard progression, since you'll get getting stronger opponents too. However, the TH #.5 strategies try to game the system to get an advantage.  You can see your war weight by looking at a replay of an attack on your base in war - it's the number of gold and elixir available to be stolen in the attack."

ClashOfClans,3dv6n2,dahui9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"Prof. Marc Galanter actually had some really interesting papers on this phenomenon; he basically referred to these types of lawyers as ""repeat players."" Generally speaking ""repeat players"" are basically industrialists playing around in the legal world, and they get really, really good at basically ""mass producing"" law or legal work product, if that makes any sense. I think most people that work in ""creditor's rights"" tend to be these kind of motion factories, but there are many areas where it is the case. Most civil defense firms are similar, so are insurance practice area attorneys, and oddly enough criminal prosecutors. I can't remember if it was Galanter or someone else whose law review article I was reading that noted that the rise of ""word processing"" led to greater and greater ""returns to scale"" of this type of work, and posited that a rise in computing power and data manipulation would really lead to more. I think whoever it was that said it was definitely right.   You can basically create situations where you have programs that can essentially take client questionnaires and create various claims forms, without a lawyer getting in the way. Then you just need to be barred to file them. Over and over and over again.     Anyway, you know what's really weird, people like that end up knowing the state's rules of ethics and professional conduct better than virtually anyone else.   I've got a buddy that got tired of the criminal law game because you pretty much can't try to collect on clients without getting a complaint to the ethics board; he ended up learning the rules of ethics to defend himself so well that he ended up making it his practice area.

Pumpkin duke is a requirement in the game to succeed and some other of the game's strongest heroes are only gotten through gemming, which is 100% luck based. I've played for a few years and have not gotten a pumpkin duke, so I was weaker than someone who played for 1/4 of the time but got the lucky roll. I spent a good deal of money on the game as well. Something like that should never happen in a game.  There are many other reasons why the game is terrible. But the hero rolls are the most frustrating."

As I've said before, when you put up 139 stars in a 45v45, that's impressive no matter who you are.  They uncovered weaknesses in our own bases and put a lot of really strong attacks on display too.

Bringing in better players: We brought in one TH9 (that being Paris from OneHive 2.0), for the sole reason to match the weights. The rest of the 40% were TH8s and 8.5s who did not perform well at all, and I'd even go as far as saying they performed badly. We got them simply because we didn't have our own to participate.  Had a spy: A spy to get war weights, simply put, which was the only reason. Viper leadership let him back in to do his attacks, which he gave his best effort in and out performed other Viper players. He was kicked during prep day, but Viper leadership agreed to let him back in to do his attacks and kicked him after he had finished attacking. As we've also said before, we did not see their bases, as it wouldn't even be fun knowing where everything was on the first attack. Half of the excitement in a first attack is scouting the base and finding out if you're right or wrong on where you guessed the bombs were, or the teslas, or whatever it may be.  Fun: Not a war against a clan with 22 TH10s while we have 3, all with infernos in which they don't try and we have two days of boredom. Which we happen to be going through right now.

It sucks too, because when you plan out an attack, how many troops, what are their purpose in the raid, where are they going to go after they kill a building; it doesn't leave room for error, and when their is that one thing that can go wrong, I end up with a 0-1-star.   I like these videos because it gives me ideas, I get to see how plans are executed."

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,aglaeasfather,-28,Mon Jul 20 13:59:39 2015 UTC,did I miss something? Video is standard cc kill..?
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,CallMeQuartz,27,Mon Jul 20 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"he drops two wiz, then keeps dropping one archer directly under the drag so it keeps attacking the archer right under it instead of the wiz that are killing it"
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,CallMeQuartz,6,Mon Jul 20 14:07:39 2015 UTC,ahhhh ok this is interesting. This whole time I thought dragons attacked based on the order of the troop that was dropped if they are all in a relatively close area. Continually dropping an archer underneath is brilliant.  I learned something today!! Thanks!
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,kcply,-69,Mon Jul 20 17:46:53 2015 UTC,So then... standard cc kill.

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Darkperl_,-26,Mon Jul 20 15:56:06 2015 UTC,"Glad you got your answer. It just sounded like you were looking for some special tactic for L5 drags, as opposed to L4 or L3. But really you handle it the same."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Rioben,8,Mon Jul 20 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"yeah really just handling the deployment better I guess. I just didn't notice as many drags in the CC before so it wasn't much of an issue, but since the level 5 update seems like showing up a lot more and I've been fucking it up."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,SamsquamtchHunter,9,Mon Jul 20 16:13:21 2015 UTC,I think it has more to do with the poison spell wiping out cc troops than the level 5 drags being available.
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Randy_Bo_Bandy,0,Mon Jul 20 17:10:07 2015 UTC,This might die down -- a lot of people are just playing with their new toy (higher lvl dragons)
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Baron_VI,3,Mon Jul 20 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like someone else pointed out the poison spell makes wiz arch CC's pretty useless, so these high hp troops might be the new thing to do."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,SamsquamtchHunter,0,Mon Jul 20 19:38:11 2015 UTC,It's still a dragon ffs....
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Randy_Bo_Bandy,5,Mon Jul 20 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"I drop a single archer right below the dragon while i drop 2 or 3 wizs a little bit farther (in this video i kinda fuck up a little and lose 1 wiz but welp, still efficient), once the dragon kills the archer you drop another one just where the other one was so the dragon re-target on the archer instead of the wizards.  This basically puts the dragon into a situation where his aoe breath is useless and he has to kill archers 1 by 1 abusing his re-target delay."

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,CD_4M,7,Mon Jul 20 14:12:57 2015 UTC,"Just to elaborate on this tactic - this works for regular raids, too.  When barching, drop a line of archers around what you want to destroy, then keep dropping 1 barb in front to draw all mortar fire."

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,CD_4M,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"Standard kill squad of 2 barb, 2 witch, 2 wiz + queen works just fine for a dragon. The barbs die, and the summoned skellies, everything else should still be alive as the dragon will spend the entire time trying to attack skellies."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,dharasick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"Dragons are fairly easy to kill as long as you have the troops, and have the space on the map to do it (where your squad isn't getting picked off, or targeting buildings instead)  TH9 should bring 2 witches, 2 wizards, few archers.    If witches aren't an option, you'll probably need 20 level 5 archers, and a couple wizards.  You'll lose most/all of those troops, however, which is why witches are by far the better way to go.  Once the dragon is dead, you'll still have those witches alive.    If you only have level 4 archers, you're better off raging through it with your own dragons."
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,CD_4M,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"I bring a lvl5 drag in my CC with 1 max wizard and 1 archer (I'm TH8)   Lure out the drag and bring it away from the base a bit, then drop your CC.

ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,Praising_the_Sun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:34 2015 UTC,Drag might not be the best clean up troop.
ClashOfClans,3dy1xw,bradpifff,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"The dragon isn't for clean up, it's to kill the enemy CC.

For clean up I bring 5 wizards, 10 archers, 10 minions."

Distance of wiz towers from air defenses. Ideally, you want to attack bases where wiz towers will mindlessly attack lava hounds and not your balloons.  With a CB opener, can you take out an air defense, CC, and AQ? With shattered, can you take out 2 air defenses and some extra defenses (ideally an xbow)?  If all conditions are met, you have a green light to laloon. Otherwise, stick with hogs or valks (again this depends on a different set of factors)."

Picking the right base is also a skill. You can't just turn up with lavaloon trained then expect to attack any base. It just won't work on some bases.

ClashOfClans,3dzdx8,Tcraw487,3,Mon Jul 20 19:39:25 2015 UTC,"Most people say barch.   Don't use barch. Its main advantage is cost, but it is 100% reliant on collector raids. Especially early, when they aren't tough enough to effectively core dive. I recommend Gibarch. Basically you take standard barch, add 12-16 giants and 6-8 wallbreakers. This army lets you take abandoned bases with standard barch, but also gives you the ability it core dive on rushed TH 9s and lower TH 8s. Grind elixir as fast as possible. Get your offence and as soon as you have the three main troops (barb, archer, giant) upgraded and your camps, get both your drills built and to level 6. Ideally by then you should have your Queen. Gibarch has a nearly identical build time to barch, costs more, but is able to be a lot more effective against a lot more bases. It's ideal if you are able to find a sweet spot where elixir is plentiful. Especially since core diving means more DE which means you get your queen far more easily, which combined with level 6 gi-barch can hit most TH 9s for a core dive."
ClashOfClans,3dzdx8,ShouldersofGiants100,3,Mon Jul 20 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"Second the gibarch.  Without giants you won't be able to hit 9s with xbows and you won't be hitting 7s anymore either.  Be prepared for a little heartache until you get your tier one troops up.  Barbs should be your first upgrade and the fight starts here. -Archer 6 can survive a shot from a gold mortar (and was my second troop, no regrets) -Giant 6 is one of the largest stat increases in the game. -Loon 6 IS the largest stat increase in the game... but not ideal for farming in gold.  Better if you plan on warring or heading up to masters.  I barched primarily and had no problems getting the queen upgraded quickly but the addition of giants means you can hit collector raids (and core dive) on bases with xbows."
ClashOfClans,3dzdx8,FreeColdBeer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:28 2015 UTC,I got my giants up as one of my first upgrades at TH9. Barch was done a lot later and i had no issues farming the most expensive upgrades (keeping 5 builders busy) with level 5 barch with level 6 giants added in.
ClashOfClans,3dzdx8,slyburger,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"I suspect that when people say ""barch"" they're not literally saying ""only barbs and archers"".  but above is correct - if you're only training barbs and archers, and you're a TH9, you're limiting yourself to collectors unless you're prepared to use rage + heal on a pack of barbs to push through one or two walls.  You'll either hit next a lot, and bitch about loot, or you'll fail at hitting deep storages because you ran out of patience.    I usually run with +/- 8 giants, 8 WB, 45 barbs, and the rest archers.  I don't always use all the giants, and I rarely use all the WB, but they are always there in case I need them.  CC full of barbs and goblins, because people are always willing to donate them, and it's a good tool for cleaning out storages once they're exposed.    Absolutely do giants to level 6 first.  Both because they wreck through bases, and because individually they're great at tanking in lieu of more barbs.  To hit collectors on built TH9 and TH10 bases, they are a must!"
ClashOfClans,3dzdx8,CountDoofu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:07:51 2015 UTC,"I'd go up to 16 giants. The cost is greater... but 16 giants alone can steamroll halfway through most TH 8s without breaking a sweat. Back them with barbs, archers and heroes, you can take basically any non-maxed TH 8 EASILY  and most early TH 9s... once they start maxing, it get harder, but you can still core anything other than a max.. I also use more barbs... 44 archers, 20 goblins, 16 giants, 8 WBs, rest barbs. They're simply a lot tougher and archers tend to bunch up when they enter bases (Going through small openings). That makes them vulnerable to a mortar instakill."
ClashOfClans,3dzdx8,ShouldersofGiants100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:43 2015 UTC,"This question comes up in my clan quite a bit, and everyone has a different ""recipe"" for barch.  I think what it comes down to is that there is no ideal barch composition - only barch compositions that match a certain range of bases.  You're definitely not wrong, and I've done up to 12 giants before, but when you trade off giants for troops you can spread around, your spectrum of collector base targets actually narrows.    You'll crush a TH8 no matter what, but 16 giants won't help you hit a tough TH9 or TH10 base with full collectors - you probably won't get them all.     You will be better at hitting deep for storages, though.    TL;DR what I always tell my clan is to pick an army and then get VERY GOOD at knowing what it can and can't do!"
ClashOfClans,3dzdx8,CountDoofu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:44 2015 UTC,True enough... but my comp has never really failed with collector bases either. Release giants in groups of 4-8 as tanks and the rest is irrelevant. The only collectors I ever miss are surrounded by high level walls or nearer the centre. Any normal collector setup is easy prey.

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,this_is_notmyopinion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"Just attack and attack a lot. Trophies don't really matter until later in the game so attack bases with lots of loot that you can steal, not bases that you can totally destroy for stars and trophies.   Also, I'd say the most important thing to do is to work through your lab upgrades. They will be the hardest thing to catch up on if you rush to the next level of TH because they take the most time.   Lastly, join a clan if you haven't already. A good clan can make your clash experience much better. And warring can be fun when you're ready for that."

You'll want to upgrade your lab as soon as you get there so you can keep it upgrading troops.

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,S0rC3r3r9,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:20 2015 UTC,Hello.  I'm a near-maxed TH8 with BQ10 and Pekka at 3.   I'm now collecting DE for Golems to level 2.   I've been in a fair number of wars and I get about 5 stars per war.  All of my 3 star attacks are mass dragons + lightning spells.  My question is: Which attacks should I master before moving to TH9?  P. S. I've tried GoWiPe in wars with moderate success (read 2 stars regularly and 3 stars once).
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,slyburger,4,Mon Jul 20 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"Hogs! They're a great 3 star strategy at TH8 and TH9.  GoWiPe is a pretty safe 2 stars against any TH9, but will rarely get you 3. Still its a decent strat to practice as it will 3 star the right kind of base. Adding back end troops (hogs/bloons) can turn this into a 3 star strat. It will also help you get familiar with GoWiWiXX once you hit th9."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,S0rC3r3r9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:09 2015 UTC,So I should definitely practise with hogs and GoWiPe until I'm sure I can do it well before I move to TH9 right?  I ask repeatedly because I don't want to be one of those guys who can't perform basic attacks and has a TH9 base.
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,slyburger,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:43 2015 UTC,"Sure practice what you can but I wouldn't let it hold you back from upgrading unless you're in a serious war clan. The war game changes a lot at TH9, you just need to get in there and get experience."

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,allthegoo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"Being in a clan adds both a social and a strategic element to your gameplay. Social in that you have a group of people that you get to know, through chatting and working together in attacks. Strategic in that you can have clan wars between your clan and other clans. So you have to coordinate targets, attacks and donations. In return you get more loot, better war benefits like donations,  and added game play in the sense that your team wins.  The hard part is finding the right clan. There are active clans, not so active and then dead clans. Some clans are total war oriented while others are more casual. The only way to really know what you like is to try it out, join up and say hello. Just tell them you are new and need pointers, most clans love to help out. And if they are jerks, just find another one. There is no shortage of clans. While you can start your own, I'd suggest you join another instead at least for a while. Running a clan is a whole different skill set from being in one."

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,mastrdestruktun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:45:00 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the game.  It is a ton of fun.  When I was new, I read Flammy's tutorials and the clash of clans wiki.  Both are really good sources of info.  The biggest thing to remember is to not upgrade your town hall to the next level until you have upgraded all of the defenses, walls, and other buildings to the max that they can be at that TH level.  There are times when rushing makes sense, but you need experience to make an informed decision about that.  Up to town hall 7 it is easy to recover from rushing, but it gets progressively harder after that."

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,michigrind,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"Hello  I just unlocked witches and I was wondering if lvl1 witches are worth the 12 housing space or do I have to get them to lvl2 asap in order to use them for war attacks?  edit: I know I could just try them, but it's usually difficult to say whether it's a troops fault or just a bad attack..."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,mastrdestruktun,2,Tue Jul 21 10:45:14 2015 UTC,The level 2 upgrade is significant.  I would prioritize it before relying on large numbers of witches in a gowiwi attack.
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,zebano,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:00 2015 UTC,They're certainly usable at level 1. Especially if their primary purpose is CC kill/cleanup.
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,The_Real_JS,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"So this, is my current war base. No idea how good it is, kinda casual player. Just wondering what I should be doing now. I've only got a few more defences to go then I've maxed out TH9, although it'll take ages for the walls.   Any advice is appreciated."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,Boratkan,2,Tue Jul 21 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"There are many problems with that base being the biggest one the fact that is too compact, with no dgb spots and very very easy to hog.  What you are looking for in a th9 base is: - CC centralized - Queen centralized - Ads and AS well placed - various dgb spots, so you will have 2 dgb spots and some fake dgb spots to trick the attacker.  The th doesn't have to be centralized, you are looking to build an anti-3 star base. This means that you put the th closer to the edge and place all traps and teslas close enough as it's gonna be from where most of the attackers are gonna come from."

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,bushypeepee,4,Tue Jul 21 13:07:55 2015 UTC,"In short, I suck at wars. I took a long break after reaching TH9, and started warring again as a late TH9. All my troops and spells are maxed except valks and drags. Royals are BK19 and AQ21. I've been using 3 star comps and I plan a lot in advance, but I almost always mess up on the execution, and that often results in 1 star attacks.  Where might the problem lie? Given my troop and hero levels, I want to be 3 starring late TH9s left and right.   EDIT: Any inputs or suggestions at all will be very greatly appreciated!"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,Robespierre8,6,Mon Jul 20 16:02:21 2015 UTC,Best thing that has helped me is watching YouTube vids. Onehiveraids is the one I like the most. Their how to vids really helped me out a lot. I usually get 2 or 3 stars pretty regularly now on th9s.
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,bushypeepee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for replying.   Yeah I do watch Youtube videos such as Onehiveraids and JohnnyRaids among others, and it has helped a lot with my planning. I just always mess up the execution, such as BK or AQ taking a walk despite my funneling efforts, golems ignoring my jump spell.   Perhaps playing on a tablet instead of an iPhone 4, or joining up with a war clan that can point out my errors can help.."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,Robespierre8,4,Mon Jul 20 17:19:56 2015 UTC,That stuff just takes practice. I spent a good 2 weeks just farming with a war army. Hopefully your clan mates will give you golems and what not for practice.
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,this_is_notmyopinion,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. Using war armies in multiplayer will help a lot. No stress. Try and climb trophies so you can match up against relatively hard opponents.   Also, watch a rewatch your replays. Zoom in, zoom out. Pause. Deconstruct it."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,casinoble,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the nail on the head with your last paragraph there. For me, the difference between playing on my phone and playing on my tablet was huge (both android platform devices, but that's neither here nor there). Maybe it's my fat fingers, but the amount of misplaced troops/spells went down significantly when I started playing on the larger screen, which reduced the number of miscues during my war attacks. Also, being a member of a war clan with experienced th8's and th9's made moving up and trying different attacks easier, since they (very freely) offer advice/critiques on attacks...successful attacks...unsuccessful attacks...there is always room for improvement. lol gl-"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,jkimtrolling,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:01 2015 UTC,since they (very freely) offer advice/critiques on attacks   Sounds like our clan :p
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,infiniteloop33,3,Mon Jul 20 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"I want to be 3 starring late TH9s left and right.   That's your problem! You have to crawl before you sprint an ultra marathon. Start by attacking lower level TH9s and getting the mechanics right (lure vs. no lure, spell placement, dealing with enemy queen, getting the cc kill, hog/loon pathing, etc.) Once you build up your mechanics, you can transition to more powerful bases."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,bushypeepee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:39 2015 UTC,"Not to shift the blame or find excuses, but my current clan assigns targets (normally mirrors or +1), and it isn't really working for me I feel. It's one of the reasons why I'm contemplating joining another clan.   And yes, I often 3 star my clean up base with the benefit of knowing cc troops and trap placements. I'd really like to improve my first attack though.."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,FreeColdBeer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"Two bits... First I've found that I suck WAY harder if I mess up drawing out the cc.    Second (and it sound like I'm just going to rehash what was said above), mirrors or +1 are great if you've been a rock solid war expert your whole time but if you're still learning/practicing war attacks that probably won't benefit you OR your clan.  You'll have to work that out with your leaders.  One bit that's helped me quite a bit is moving up to masters to practice war attacks.  You shouldn't be practicing your war attacks in war.  I don't always stumble across full CCs of witches and wizards in masters but it DOES allow me to try out war attacks and get something in return."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,DoomBread,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:46 2015 UTC,You shouldn't be practicing your war attacks in war   Wars are the only place you can truly practise your attacks.
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,jkimtrolling,3,Mon Jul 20 21:36:09 2015 UTC,"Wars are the only place you can truly practise your attacks.   Although that sounds edgy and is emotionally appealing I disagree.  Just because we call it an attack, it is not one singular masterpiece. It is made up of much smaller elements, and they flow together in phases.   By 'practicing your free-throws' so to speak, and working on fundamental skills during raiding you can indeed truly practices your 'attack'.   Someone who has used Iron Fist and Royal Cloak +5000 times will obviously be more comfortable than someone who only uses them six times a week during war.  Someone who raids over and over again perfecting their Jump/Rage combo spell drops and honing their skill healing the different types of troops will find more success than people who only heal in the sanitary test tube environment of the war map.   There is much to be gained attacking bases which are only partially active defensively and where the CC remains a constant mystery.  Anyways, while there is definitely a lot to be said for any specific war attack veteran/specialist its not the full truth to write off the benefit that frequent raiding can have on your war attacks  This quote pretty sums up my attitude to war attacks:    Act like you've been here before"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,DoomBread,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:54 2015 UTC,"The examples you are giving aren't of war attacks, but instead of aspects of war attacks. While you can practise them in matchmaking it is still not the safe as in a war where you have ample planning time and are facing tougher bases."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,FreeColdBeer,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"If it is in war, it isn't practice.  That's war.   Though doctors practice medicine and lawyers practice law..."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,DoomBread,3,Mon Jul 20 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"If it is in war, it isn't practice   This statement is completely untrue. All practise is is performing an exercise in order to improve at said exercise. How is doing an attack in a war not war practise?"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,infiniteloop33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"Without knowing all of the particulars of your situation, I would think that finding a new clan is probably your best bet. I'm fine with certain bases being off limits except for heavy hitters and/or requiring a scout before a 3 star attempt is made, but i think it it's ludicrous for you to have to attack your mirror+1."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,HawkEye0701,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:26 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am a TH8 but I might be able to help. I'd recommend practicing every strat you use at crystal 2 and 1. There are a lot of late TH9s up here. You'll be able to share the replays with your clan mates who might be able to help you out. Other than that you can always watch how tos. There are a lot of YouTube videos for TH9 strats. Hope I am able to help. Good Luck :D"

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,FaceBlast30,2,Mon Jul 20 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say without being able to watch any replays.  Are you in a clan that has experienced clan war attackers?  If not, and you aren't too devoted to your clan, it might be a good idea to seek out a new one that can help you with planning and critique your execution after the attack.  Even if you are in a clan that you want to stay in, maybe you could go and visit another clan for a few wars just to get practice and help.  The other option would be to post up videos of your attacks, and see if people on here are able to help point out what went wrong.  If you do that, it would also be helpful to have your plan for the attack as well, since it could be a planning issue or an execution issue, or both."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,bushypeepee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been thinking of seeking out a new one, cus I feel like I'm not improving here. There's not much feedback here, while I prefer tips and suggestions on how to improve. I do have another clan in mind, so I guess I'll see how it plays out. Thanks for your suggestion!"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,zebano,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:38 2015 UTC,How many times do you watch your failed attacks? Do they match up with your planning or are you forgetting a step during the attack? Most of my failures are poor plans rather than poor execution though I have gotten flustered by a tesla popping in the spot I planned to kill the enemy CC.
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,bushypeepee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:15 2015 UTC,"I always watch all my attacks, fail or not, at least 10 times I think. Hard to follow the plan after something's messed up, like AQ taking a walk on a CB laloon, leaving all 4 ads up instead of 3 ads..."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,zebano,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:46 2015 UTC,yeah those are the hardest cases and honestly why I prefer GoHo to GoLaLoon.   edit: AQ are more likely to take a walk since the update. Treat her like your king and create a good funnel.

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,jokersan4,3,Tue Jul 21 07:38:06 2015 UTC,"Hi guys! It's been long theorized that the Haste spell would effectively counter lavaloon from being blown about by the second sweeper, while providing the critical speedup effects of Rage but at only half the cost (albeit it at a smaller radius).  Yet when I check out everyone in the Titan league, who long ago gemmed their dark spell factories to max, the de facto standard still seems to be 3 Rage 2 Freeze 1 Poison. It's not often I'll find anyone in the top global players with a Haste spell, and when they do, it's only one. Why is this?"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,bballdude53,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"No one really knows how to use them yet. Once more people unlock and try them, we will start to see more and more attacks with haste spells in them."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,jkimtrolling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:29:49 2015 UTC,Because people in Titan are only shooting for 1-2 stars. Also people may not want to spend dark elixir on their raids

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,thegianttaco,3,Tue Jul 21 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"If you are trying to farm for resources it is best to keep your town hall on the outside and your storages on the inside.

Another good layout for TH4 will be this design  Other than layout, you need to max out your current level before upgrading your townhall. Check what building is available in the shop and what could be upgraded, concentrate on those first.   To looters, your base is an easy base to attack and that is why you get attacked so easily. At TH3 and TH4, though it may be easy to three star opponents' village, you want to make it difficult for them."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,mastrdestruktun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:49 2015 UTC,"In addition to what the others have said, it is a good idea to try to put storages in different compartments from each other, and in compartments that don't have defenses in them (because giants will bore through the walls to get to the defenses, allowing barbs or goblins to follow through the holes).  Ultimately you won't be able to make an impregnable base at TH4; TH7 is when you get enough walls to have really sophisticated bases."

Farm that shit out of it.. raid liek crazy.. raid even though you have a shield.. and highly suggest to upgrade your walls to level 7.. mainly because people start using GoWiPe at TH8.. and if your walls are tough.. its really all about your base placement for people to 3 star you...  anyway.. my favorite strategy for farming.. is 8 giants.. and rest archers.. and 3 heal spells.. IF you are feeling good.. i use 8-10 hogs.. and 8 giants and rest  archers.. however.. i have level4 hogs to mess with.. so i suggest getting those up too..ive been dealing with TH8 for a bit and getting antsy but fight the urge..i can help if  you need strategies or upgrade paths.. im down

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,this_is_notmyopinion,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:34 2015 UTC,"Couple things.   Always keep your lab going. Troop upgrades don't take long for you now, but they will get longer and your lab will usually be what takes the longest to complete.   Keep your builders busy, too. When you can avoid it, don't log off with lots of loot in your collectors. Lots of clashers like to keep one builder free at all times so that they can buy/upgrade walls with whatever's left before logging off.  Attack and attack a lot. Trophies don't really matter until later in the game so attack bases with lots of loot that you can steal, not bases that you can totally destroy for stars and trophies. Try different army compositions. Barbarians and archers (Barch) is the most basic (and it is used even when you get very very advanced in the game) but mix it up. Add some goblins. Use a dozen giants and a healer. Drop one troop at a time. Drop five troops at a time. Drop troops in a line by dragging your finger...   Join a clan. Find the right one for you. There's tons of clans looking for people. They'll put troops in your CC that will help you a lot. They'll provide advice. When you're ready, you can war with them. And most importantly, they'll be nice people to chat with while your clashing.    Lastly, don't follow any advice that you don't like. If it's ruining your clash experience, just don't do it. In the end, it's all about having fun."

Do not neglect your walls -- when some people say 'maxed' they mean 'maxed everything but walls' -- however it's important to keep these at the highest level possible so you don't have to play catchup at higher TH levels.  Having mean looking walls also deters many potential attackers into pressing that NEXT button  Keep those builders busy, save gems to get 4-5 builders, and keep moving up in TH level when you are ready.

Also, make sure you save loot while your TH upgrades, should be easy if everything is maxed.. walls are annoying but as others will agree, dont forget about em, as they are very important later on.

There is no way to see all your buildings current levels at once.  A lot of people create an alternate base where they line up all their buildings in terms of upgrade priority (so put all your mortars in a line with the most upgraded to least upgraded;  then your archer towers, walls, etc.) and move them up as you upgrade.  If you do this, be careful never to make that your active base!"

It's basic common sense: get your offense going as quickly as possible, and make sure that you can beat whoever you pull into the war.

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,mastrdestruktun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"Loons and hogs are both great early upgrades for war purposes, and I find farming with loons to be a ton of fun as well.  People who upgrade dark barracks twice in a row right away can sometimes upgrade loons first, then lava hounds to 2, but I was slower on my dark barracks upgrades.  I did loons 6 then barbs 6, because I was short on elixir from upgrading camps and DB, and because barbs are such a huge upgrade for barch.  With loons6 I could basically 3 star any TH8 in war (since I did my CC right away and could take a donated lava hound), and being able to handle the toughest couple TH8 really helped my clan out.  After that I think I did hogs 5 and lava hounds 2, but I don't remember exactly.  I may have put jump 2 in between to compensate for insufficient DE.  (Jump 2 is a good upgrade for early TH9 because it is inexpensive, so you can slot it in if your lab frees up when you are poor,  and it dramatically increases the usefulness of jump.)"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,JayDubya09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"How far did you go into the 8.5 strategy? I know walls n teslas n trap upgrades are mentioned for 8.5 which I planned to do, but I also seen the 8.75 mentioned to which mentioned upgrading everything you have from th8 to max th9 before adding the additional defenses. Ofc xbows last due to heavy weight."
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,mastrdestruktun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:19 2015 UTC,"Well... I went far, and then farther, and then beat the concept to a pulp.  My first TH8.5 I actually conceived of before I had learned of the term.  I had an alt at almost max TH8, except for walls, and on my other alt I was maxing TH9 walls, and I realized that I needed to do something different, because I don't have the attention span to grind out max TH9 walls on more than one account.  So I decided to rush to TH10 and max my offense.  At TH9 I added all the non-xbow defenses and maxed my war offense (except for golems and witches) and went to TH10.  Now that account still has no xbows and no infernos, but has pretty decent offense.  The opponents my clan draws in war seem unable to 3 star it, even though it should be easier than a TH9.  It weighs in at 62k, and all of our TH9 with xbows are above it on the war map.  Then I started a defenseless alt.  Defenseless is like .5, but taken to the extreme.  Then I got tired of always losing, so at TH7 I added only anti-air defenses.  Now that alt is at TH8 with no additional cannons or mortars, and it weighs in like an early TH7 in war, but can defend against TH7 and inexpert TH8 mass drag attacks.  Now I am debating rushing to TH10 for infernos, but I have some time to think about it because I'm maxing offense.  With infernos I would weigh in at about 45k, which I think is late TH7 / early TH8 territory."

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,FerdThePenguinGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does definitely matter. Xbows are one of the most heavily weighted buildings at town hall 9; if you build one, you're not going to be a th8.5 anymore.   Also, the level 1 xbow has the same DPS as a low level archer tower. They aren't useful as defenses at all until they're about level 3. You'd be messing up your war weight for a mediocre defense."

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,mastrdestruktun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:20:22 2015 UTC,"Nobody knows exactly what each building weighs.  The best approximation for defensive war weight is the loot offered to an attacker from your storages.  We observe that xbows increase this by 2000 each (and at TH10, infernos by 3000 each).  The amount is rounded to 1000 so upgrading smaller defenses or walls or traps often results in no change."

With 5 builders I would do lab, sf, dsf, cc, and then use the last for misc small buildings (like the new storages) and for dumping gold into walls.  As builders become free I would do camps and dark barracks.  You might want to stagger their start times to make sure that they don't all become free simultaneously."

The first thing to do is to get your raiding army good enough to keep getting resources, so max barbs, archers, giants if you use them, and camps.  Then pick one war troop, probably dragons, and get enough barracks able to make them so that you can conveniently make a dragon army.  Probably 2-3 barracks at level 9.  At that point you can beat any TH7, and rushed or poorly designed TH8.  Defensively, if you have three lev 6 airdef, then you can hold your own against TH7 dragon attacks even if your other defenses are underleveled.  So I would prioritize airdef above all else.

ClashOfClans,3dyatb,IcyNuttY,2,Tue Jul 21 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly I paid for my 4th builder and with extras from trees and bushes. Sniping for 8-9 hours a day for a week would roughly mean I can earn SGD$300-400 easily, paying a measly $12.99 doesn't seem so bad"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,behlski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:41:20 2015 UTC,"How difficult would it be for me to hit Master's league as a TH6?  I want those gems so I can get another builder.   My TH7 upgrade is in process, but I have nothing else to do or upgrade for the next few days.  Should I just wait until I'm TH7 with another army camp?"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,Sleepydark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"I would wait it out, it would be near impossible to hit masters league as a th6, unless you are an extremely active clasher, i'm talking 8 hours a day of solid play, sniping up to crystal 1/2 shouldn't be too difficult but after that it will become much, much harder, especially on defense you will be getting a long line of non stop 3-Stars, losing trophies every time you log off, as soon as you log off! It would very quickly turn from a challenge, its a job, into something that just takes the fun out of the game, so i would wait it out! One thing i would suggest is maxing your storages before your town hall finishes upgrading so you can get the most out of the good loot as a th6, becasue every town hall you go higher the harder it is to find loot, also so you can start your new defenses going asap! It would be noticeably easier at th7, although it would still be quite the challenge! But with perseverance and a sportful clan you should be set! Clash on and have fun m8!  Hope i could help!  -Sleepy"
ClashOfClans,3dyatb,behlski,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  I'll wait till I have higher level troops.  I guess there's probably not nearly as many TH snipes available after getting past gold.

Worst case scenario you won't be able to attack for 6 hours until he gets kicked off for being online for too long"
ClashOfClans,3e14xo,myownredditacc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:56 2015 UTC,I'm by no means a specialist or even that good at attacking th9's but I'll tell you what I would try.  Lure cc with a giant and kill  next you need to kill queen use some minions or wall breaker and raged king  to finish base I'd use mass hogs DGB if any will be beside the mortars (they're prolly tesla with one giant bomb)  take out north archer tower and lower east with ballons to tweak hog pathing so they don't run over the potential DGB spot  deploy hogs in a group of two or Asian wall style at the west two archer towers   they will go from mortar to wiz tower skipping those DGB locations heal around xbows or as necessary
ClashOfClans,3dzw64,Acisthebest,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:33 2015 UTC,Hmm... So that's what the sound effects are like
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,Logics10,2,Mon Jul 20 23:43:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an internal battery problem, which could have been caused by not using the official charger and third party ones. Return it to the seller and get something new instead, Nexus 7 2013 tablets are pretty cheap now on Amazon and its still doing fine for its hardware and age."
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,Asa37,3,Tue Jul 21 00:02:24 2015 UTC,What is the rating on the charger? Should be a 2A usb charger. That's what mine came with and it gains charge while i play.  (Mines a 2012)
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,Ultimate_Bliss,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a 5v 2A charger, so i'm pretty sure the issue is with the device. I also tried another charger and cable with no luck."
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,Alatar1313,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:14 2015 UTC,Yeah this is what I came here to ask. It might be worth a shot to try different cables and chargers if you have other 2A chargers around for other devices before assuming it's the device...but yeah it's probably the device.
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,JayDubya09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:15 2015 UTC,"check what it says either in the quickdrop pane, or under battery in the settings, if is says ""Charging (USB)"" or ""Charging (AC)"". In order to get full draw, you want to see (AC).  based off this as i have opened up a few generic cords and my samsung cords, this will help to deliver more amperes to your device to my knowledge"
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,Asa37,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:43 2015 UTC,"I heard its not recommended to go over the amps of the official charger as it could fry the battery, based off what I've heard. Correct me if I'm wrong."
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,JayDubya09,2,Tue Jul 21 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I did not mean it as going over the amps of the charger. But afaik the voltage is what can fry the battery if the voltage is upped. the amps is just how much can be pulled from the power source at a given time. That picture was showing the difference between generic cords and specifically samsung. I cannot verify other cords like provided for the Nexus line and such, but I consistently use samsung cords for all my devices and have always had a faster charger to upkeep with Clash or other heavy games of the likes."
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,zskuld,2,Tue Jul 21 02:55:07 2015 UTC,I have the 2012 and its the same way. I pretty much keep it plugged in all the time for clash. It is a battery hog...
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,zskuld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:04 2015 UTC,Does it actually stay at 100% though when its plugged in? I don't really care if I had to keep it plugged in a lot but my current problem with this one is the battery drains even when its plugged in and i'm playing.
ClashOfClans,3e0b6s,ThisIsThunderclap,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"Whoops, sorry wasn't clear. I lose 5-10% per hour with it being plugged in and clash open. I've had to just switch between phone and tablet while farming. I primarily use the tablet for my war attacks"
ClashOfClans,3e0afk,79MattG,5,Mon Jul 20 23:37:19 2015 UTC,To simplify-  OP dropped his quake spell on TH to try and clutch the star.  Quake spells will finish off a building when there is a certain percent of HP left.  OP dropped t too early so Queen couldn't do enough damage to get beneath that instakill percentile.
ClashOfClans,3e0afk,TwofuTF2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, thanks.  Update: We lost the war by one star :'("
ClashOfClans,3e0afk,smalaki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:17 2015 UTC,"A building must have 20% hitpoints left for it to instantly destroy a building (needs confirmation).   Hmmm TIL.  but the wiki says that it needs confirmation, where are we getting this info that it would instakill?"
ClashOfClans,3e0afk,zskuld,2,Tue Jul 21 03:22:09 2015 UTC,What am I looking at?
ClashOfClans,3e11oy,chrissystone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:19 2015 UTC,i usually look to see if anyone below me can get the 3 stars on the lower base. If not I use the second attack to clean it up.
ClashOfClans,3e11oy,jetski76,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:47:32 2015 UTC,Ask your clan. Communication is key to winning wars.
ClashOfClans,3e11oy,slyburger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:06 2015 UTC,"Any TH7 can be 100% with dragons 2+. Look If are people with these conditions and talk to them. Communication are the key. Before go after 3* the #4, look If all the other villages have at least 2*"
ClashOfClans,3e10cq,singergiant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:35 2015 UTC,Lure out the cc to the queen side. Kill them. Then I think hogs would work very well against this base.
ClashOfClans,3e10cq,jaws22089,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:26:09 2015 UTC,Could you give me a detailed list of the suggested troop loadout? remember 200 spaces. EDIT: And potions (its been a couple months since ive done war attacks)
ClashOfClans,3e10cq,TJack303,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"I like 8 wiz, 5 barbs, 8 archers, 31 hogs. Lure cc to queen using barbs to initiate then archer to draw towards queen. Use remaining barbs and king to tank while archers and however many wiz you need kill queen and cc.  Use remaining wiz to cleanup behind hogs. If cc is still outdated and uses archers/wiz use poison to instakill them and take king to kill his quern and use remaining troops for cleaning up after hogs. Bring 3 heals and plan on dropping them as your hogs approach the only 3 logical giant bomb spots"
ClashOfClans,3e10cq,TJack303,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:57 2015 UTC,Easily a hog base
