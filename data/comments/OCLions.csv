OCLions,3e2aug,paintballpmd,4,Tue Jul 21 12:17:31 2015 UTC,It's an interesting situation and I hope that it works out for Orlando City that we at least get the money owed to the club from São Paulo but preferably the player since we NEED some attacking players right now.    Any idea how we're going to make room for him in terms of roster space and salary/DP slots?  Do we buy down Rivas's contact below DP level or did we give that new Targeted Allocation Money to Kansas City in the Okugo trade?
OCLions,3e2aug,j_andrew_h,5,Tue Jul 21 13:48:25 2015 UTC,"No TAM money in the Okugo trade, so that is safe.  I'd imagine Estrella, Conor Donovan, or Tommy Redding will be loaned to create the roster space."

OCLions,3e2pq1,daguru9,4,Tue Jul 21 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is one of the better refs we could get. Collins red a while back was rough, but its not as crazy as other reds weve gotten."
OCLions,3e2pq1,mikesicle,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:47 2015 UTC,I think the 3 diving calls are what killed me in the 1st game... he also hasn't called a single yellow for diving since.  So either teams know he's going to call that super tight so don't give him an excuse to call it; or he was smacked on wrist for those bad calls and told to chill on the simulation calls.
OCLions,3e2pq1,j_andrew_h,7,Tue Jul 21 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"This was the ref of the first game, who gave Shea a yellow for diving within minutes and gave Collin the red card..."
OCLions,3e2pq1,DarkSchnider,6,Tue Jul 21 14:33:09 2015 UTC,"gave Collin the red card...   To be fair, it was a stud's up challenge and actually the right call. Much more contact than the Larin stud's up red."
OCLions,3e2pq1,j_andrew_h,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:50 2015 UTC,I don't have an issue with that Red from the 1st game. Villa sold it for sure; but it's going to be called a red most of the time.
OCLions,3e2pq1,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:54 2015 UTC,Stay on your feet boys!  Both on offense (Kelly likes to call simulation calls on us and only us) and no sloppy slide tackles to give them an excuse to give us a 4th freaking red card in a row.
OCLions,3e2pq1,Disorted,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with this. He's a good ref. While I'm still going to say he sucks during the game, and I hate him for giving Collin a red, he's still a much better choice than many other options."
OCLions,3e2pq1,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"I don't hate him for the Collin red, I hate him for the 3 yellows for diving/simulation."
OCLions,3e2pq1,Disorted,3,Tue Jul 21 16:04:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be in the minority here, but I don't mind those yellows. He set a precedent that he's here to ref a soccer game, not direct a theater performance. I'm hoping this game will see fewer players rolling around on the grass.  I really, really hate simulation/acting for the referee. I hate seeing players on the ground with puppy dog eyes waiting for a call to be made. Get up and play. /rant  edit: And the red on Collin was the right call, but that doesn't mean I like it. :)"
OCLions,3e2pq1,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:17 2015 UTC,I thought the were harsh and wrong calls and gave our boys a horrible reputation on day one.     The call on Shea was harsh but he fell awkwardly and there wan't a ton of contact so I understand though I thought is should have been a no call and he never even looked at the ref; he went down got up and started running back only to be shown yellow.    Molino was getting knocked from behind and then clipped from the side; was absolutely fouled and the only thing he did was look back at the ref with his arms out... which I prefer asking for the call to pretending to be insured like we just saw Sacha Kljestan do to us.    Higuita is the one that most people said was a dive; but he was running at full speed and had his foot clipped by Brovsky.  There was no way he was keeping his feet after that.  When I played football (the other kind) there was a small defensive back that would dive and slap the ankle of the ball carrier since he was too small to tackle them head on.  A little slap to the side while running can make people go flying in amazing and unpredictable ways.
OCLions,3e2pq1,logjam13,0,Tue Jul 21 16:27:14 2015 UTC,$20 says Rivas gets a yellow for diving
OCLions,3e2pq1,j_andrew_h,3,Tue Jul 21 15:22:34 2015 UTC,Kelly didn't get Rivas for one in the 1st game so you know he's dying to give him one.
OCLions,3e2kmp,Turtlespeed22,8,Tue Jul 21 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"Figured borg would side red card on Larin.  And I'm OK with both their goal counting and higuita getting the dogso red.  As was coach Heath in his post game.  But.. where the hell was the flying dragon kick to Collin's head?  If Larin's was debateable, that one was a definite red."
OCLions,3e2kmp,spikebaylor,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:39 2015 UTC,"Inconsistency from the ref aside, Larin's studs were up.  Isolate that foul, and it's a red by the letter of the law and league mandate.  I really don't get the controversy."
OCLions,3e2kmp,GiveMeSomeRaptorNews,4,Tue Jul 21 15:28:23 2015 UTC,"His leg wasn't straight out (contrary to Borg's analysis), and he made no contact until he tried to get up.  Not only should the appeal be upheld, but Sacha Kljestan should be fined for embellishment (which Borg also completely ignored)."
OCLions,3e2kmp,manelandjeff,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:32 2015 UTC,I'm not happy about the red. But I think what puts things over the top was his embarrassing flop. He throws his head back before Larin even makes any contact and starts falling. Larins contact was the equivalent of my yorky brushing past me on the way to his food bowl.

I can't speak for the Ruckus TIFO that went up this weekend, but both of the ILF ones have had very talented local artists, who are also members of the ILF, do the design and we turned their work into the TIFO.

OCLions,3e0wwj,spikebaylor,3,Tue Jul 21 03:01:49 2015 UTC,Agreed. All in. We wouldn't have against Columbus unless Heath had his sights set on winning the tourney. Maybe Collin gets a rest since he is still coming back from injury but besides that I see a very strong lineup for this match.
OCLions,3e0wwj,jmoney0999,3,Tue Jul 21 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"All in at the cost of the NYCFC match.  Of note, Ashe can not play for us in the Open Cup but Servando Carrasco may be able to as he never took the field in the 4th and 5th rounds."
OCLions,3e0wwj,pvdfan,3,Tue Jul 21 11:07:33 2015 UTC,"Correct, Ashe can't play because of being cup tied.  Carrasco is not cup tied, but I am not sure he will start or be ready for this game.    This Higuita sitting this Sun, I think he will get the start, possibly with Estrela besides him.  If Larin's red card is upheld (should know today), they he will start this game (sitting Rochez for Sun).  If his card is overturned, I think Rochez starts.  Here are my thoughts:  Edwards  Turner - Hines - St Ledger - Boden  Higuita - Estrela  Avila - Kaka - Rivas  Larin*"
OCLions,3e0wwj,daguru9,3,Tue Jul 21 12:12:38 2015 UTC,"I expect Collin over St. Ledger simply because the roster rules. If the Red card is upheld, Larin, Higuita, and Kaka are all locks for the roster. That only leaves 2 more ""foreign player"" slots. Ramos, Rochez, Rivas, Ribeiro, and Estrela all are foreign as well."
OCLions,3e0wwj,ChemE_nolifer,2,Tue Jul 21 22:03:27 2015 UTC,Agree with you all around minus Estrella.  They seem to not trust him this year and he has only seen action once since the season started.  Maybe as a sub for Ceren in the 2nd half.
OCLions,3e0wwj,pvdfan,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"They had him below Okugo and Heath, but with both gone now (trade and injury), he moves up.  Just not sure if the new guy will be ready to start this game.  Maybe come in as a sub, but personally I would give the start to Estrela.  He looked really, really good against WBA and Coach did praise him after the game."
OCLions,3e0wwj,daguru9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"I agree on the lineup but unless Ramos is carrying an injury, I see him starting over Turner.  I think he has the fitness to play both Wednesday and in NYC and will start like he did against Columbus."
OCLions,3e0wwj,daguru9,3,Tue Jul 21 13:45:29 2015 UTC,"Dunno, give Turner his shot and see what happens.  If necessary, bring Ramos in later as a super-sub.  But in the long run, it won't matter because NO ONE has been able to predict Coach Heath all season... :)"
OCLions,3e0wwj,daguru9,2,Tue Jul 21 14:06:07 2015 UTC,Good point.  I like Turner certainly and I feel okay with him in there; but Ramos has been much scarier for other teams and I'm concerned that Avila and Turner on the right will equal ZERO attack from that entire side of the field.     You are 100% right about predicting Coach Heath... I can't do it.
OCLions,3e0wwj,daguru9,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"I would also rest Ramos as much as possible, will be needed at 100% for NYCFC..."

OCLions,3dzqus,Wheaties466,5,Tue Jul 21 13:59:04 2015 UTC,People called me crazy when I was saying Avila and Okugo had no right being in the lineup with the way they had been playing.  I did not watch okugo in philly but here he just seems like hes out of place and not clicking with the team the whole season. I'm glad to see that contract off of our books.
OCLions,3dzqus,Wheaties466,4,Mon Jul 20 22:27:23 2015 UTC,Okugo just didn't fit in our system. We ask a hell of a lot out of our dms defensively and attacking wise and I think he was just uncomfortable and lost being asked to do so much
OCLions,3dzqus,jmoney0999,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I thought Okugo needed to go. But honestly, I'm fine with Avila. He definitely isn't a spectacular player, but he also hasn't been responsible to for too many groans on my end.   If we could trade him for a better player, should we? Yes. But I'm fine with him on our roster for now."
OCLions,3dzqus,Widan,4,Tue Jul 21 00:17:57 2015 UTC,Avila is good as a rotation option but not a a regular starter. I think that's what got people upset about him. Injuries are just a bitch. I guarantee if he had only started maybe 5 or 6 matches this year as planned no one would be upset.
OCLions,3dzqus,jmoney0999,4,Tue Jul 21 01:10:42 2015 UTC,No Dom Dwyer? ;D This could be good though. Hopefully he proves influential during games to create and finish chances.

OCLions,3dzlny,zrowny,10,Mon Jul 20 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"Both are top options in the MLS. But I think it will have to go down to form and the matchup.   Luke is more physical and at least 6 in taller. Ashe is the speed. So going up against someone like Fabian Castillo, Ashe is a no brainier. A team like nycfc who is much slower I think Luke would be a better option. Just my thoughts and sorry if the format sucks. I'm at work still"
OCLions,3dzlny,jmoney0999,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Depending on USOC games, I could see either one being used based on game plan.  Ashe is faster and may be better on the defensive side, but Boden has the physicality, size, and an amazing touch on crosses.  If it is a team that is very good on the wings, I could see them going with Ashe.  If it is a team that is weak on the wings or weak on defending crosses, I think they would use Boden.  Either way, this is a very good problem to have!"
OCLions,3dzlny,daguru9,7,Tue Jul 21 12:17:57 2015 UTC,I say play both. Keep Boden on our already strong left side and play Ashe on RB to strengthen our right side. I think fast Ashe with fast Ramos could be an amazing combination.
OCLions,3dzlny,TheWhaleGamers,10,Mon Jul 20 20:55:32 2015 UTC,So move Ramos up to RM? I'd be down with that
OCLions,3dzlny,spikebaylor,9,Mon Jul 20 21:02:11 2015 UTC,Sort of DeAndre Yedlin him?
OCLions,3dzlny,j_andrew_h,3,Mon Jul 20 21:08:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. Someone else mentioned switching him and Avila once before.  If not for the injuries and timing I'd have loved to see that at the West Brom game.
OCLions,3dzlny,spikebaylor,3,Mon Jul 20 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"'Twas I!  I stand by it, that Ramos could be a solid winger for us, and Avila is more defensive oriented with experience playing RB for Chivas."
OCLions,3dzlny,74656638,5,Tue Jul 21 17:42:41 2015 UTC,Tough call.  I was gonna say Ashe in open cup but think i remember he is cap tied.    Boden for a couple games and then evaluate where Ashe is with the team style and chemistry.  Maybe you make the decision based on need ... speed vs height?
OCLions,3dzlny,spikebaylor,4,Mon Jul 20 20:48:02 2015 UTC,Ashe is cap tied to Houston so it will have to be Boden in Chicago and then maybe Ashe in NYC for fresh legs?
OCLions,3dzlny,j_andrew_h,3,Mon Jul 20 21:07:17 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too.  Get Boden some time to sit after the open cup.. especially after that string of games a couple weeks ago.
OCLions,3dzlny,spikebaylor,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"Ashe for league games, Boden for Open Cup and Friendlies.  Ashe is making far too much to be a backup at this point."
OCLions,3dzlny,pvdfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:23 2015 UTC,Adrian might experiment with having them both play with Larin probably going to be out this week and just put rivas up top. He seems to try and work the best talent into the lineup one way or another.
OCLions,3dzlny,Wheaties466,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"Boden all the way, though I like what I've seen from Ashe."
OCLions,3dynwl,meeerod,9,Mon Jul 20 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"Okugo was always going to be our best trade piece given that he's talented and expendable. Carrasco is a cheap backup on 80k, so if we're getting allocation money and clearing $200k+ in cap space, a high profile signing must be imminent, no?  Also, we're becoming the 2014 Dynamo. Carrasco, Hall, Ashe, and Cascio now. Solid group that's played together"
OCLions,3dynwl,logjam13,6,Mon Jul 20 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"Even if no one is coming in, he was making way too much for a bench player."
OCLions,3dynwl,pvdfan,7,Mon Jul 20 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"Thank god, Okugo was getting progressively worse and frequently looked lost. Anyone know anything about Carrasco other than that he's married to Alex Morgan."
OCLions,3dynwl,KubaBVB09,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:31 2015 UTC,I liked Okugo defensively; but he wasn't a good fit for us and didn't link up well enough in the attack like Ceren has.    Carrasco appears to also be a DM; which is not great for us as we have plenty of those (and really need some attacking players) but is a good and experienced player which will help and certainly a lot less expensive than Okugo.

OCLions,3dynwl,Widan,6,Mon Jul 20 17:21:07 2015 UTC,If we don't receive that much in this trade it will likely be to get allocation money to buy down a DP to make another signing.  Hoping for Ganso.
OCLions,3dynwl,Wheaties466,3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:41 2015 UTC,Hoping for Ganso as well. Especially if his club still owes us money.
OCLions,3dynwl,buddadabaptist,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:23 2015 UTC,That and to clear his wages as well. He was on 300k and for a bench player in the MLS that just can't happen.
OCLions,3dynwl,jmoney0999,7,Mon Jul 20 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"It will be sad to see Okugo go, I was so hyped and excited for him at the beginning of the season.

He's not going to injure anyone like that so it shouldn't be called (which I think is what he's getting at) but in the technical sense, yes it's a tackle, and yes the studs are up. The issue is where you draw that line. This obviously shouldn't be called, Larin's probably shouldn't either, but it's more of a gray area."
OCLions,3dxytg,Popcornshrimpeater,9,Mon Jul 20 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a handball and should have been a PK; but not a studs up tackle.

Intent and context matter, which is what we're all trying to say about Larin's red card."

And just because it touches his arm (which I don't think it did) that does not mean it is a handball. His arm is in a natural position to make a tackle. The ref was brutal, particularly against OCSC but this was the right no call."

OCLions,3dugtu,Parallelcircle,4,Sun Jul 19 16:39:35 2015 UTC,If it's not overturned Larin is suspended 2 games...  Considering that PRO accounts for 1/3 of the votes needed to overturn. And they don't like to admit that one of their refs screwed up... It's a very real possibility.
OCLions,3dugtu,Deathxrays,3,Sun Jul 19 17:49:40 2015 UTC,I don't think merely not overturning it gets him suspended for an extra game.  If they find it to not just be a red but excessive they will add more.  There is a fine though I think if it's not overturned.

OCLions,3dugtu,ftx437,7,Tue Jul 21 12:53:03 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, according to the ref on the kaka incident the step did not account into his decision to give kaka a red card. It was his force of running down the man not playing the ball.  Larin is clearing going for the ball and does not touch sacha until the very last moment where he hits his left ankle while sacha is already starting the dive. This is a much more justified appeal in my eyes."
OCLions,3dugtu,74656638,3,Sun Jul 19 16:31:34 2015 UTC,They ought to suspend Sacha for diving/simulation.
OCLions,3dugtu,LiamLiamLiamLiam,4,Mon Jul 20 12:58:39 2015 UTC,"""Malicious intent"" is nowhere in the laws of the game. ""Serious foul play"" or ""violent conduct"" is, and so is ""striking or attempting to strike"", ""hitting or attempting to hit"". The laws are written vague enough that PRO will have no issue denying this appeal.

OCLions,3dugtu,spikebaylor,2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:18 2015 UTC,"that's not at all what I remembered him saying... no way was the force of running down the man worth a red card.. not in a million years, certainly a yellow.  He specifically said it was for the stomp."

OCLions,3dugtu,zrowny,7,Sun Jul 19 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Here's some GFYs for you:  The full play in realtime (notice that Larin is intercepting the ball, not tackling it away from Kljestan)  Replay One  Replay Two  Really wish I could find a better angle on this one, because it's almost impossible to tell how far away Larin really is when his stud is up. It's almost 100% clear that Larin's boot never touches Kljestan, that the only contact was after Kljestan gets caught up with Larin. Just took a look again, and it looks like Larin makes some contact right here, but Larin's alright got his foot back down by then. I can't issue any judgement on how heavy the contact was, but Kljestan's reaction could've sold that he was shot.      On the other hand, how the hell is this not a red card?"
OCLions,3dugtu,vorpib,2,Sun Jul 19 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"Good replays. We can't win this appeal. He went in for a tackle off the ground, hence with no control and lead with studs up. Doesn't matter how much contact was made, it's a dangerous play. That can break bones."

RSL has had both shit luck with some calls and some seriously dumb fouls to get to the top of that list."
OCLions,3dtw9x,ChemE_nolifer,3,Sun Jul 19 16:34:11 2015 UTC,Reminders of the earlier red cards  Collin -probably deserved Ramos- definitely deserved Shea - I never saw a great angle but he showed studs and San Jose's Nyassi did some great acrobatics to sell it
OCLions,3dtw9x,SoulOfDragnsFire,3,Sun Jul 19 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"Kaka and Larin are the two that seemed pretty egregious.  I understand Collin, Shea but don't agree.  That's fine.  The issue is that the expansion teams do not get any benefit of the doubt and, as we have seen, the ref has often been overruled by the 4th official.

OCLions,3du2rq,SuperBOOTH,6,Sun Jul 19 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"There was this report out of Brazil a few days ago:   Ganso won't join Orlando City, according to São Paulo's VP Ataíde Gil Guerreiro, he did confirm Orlando City wanted to sign him though.   Not sure if that means Ganso doesn't want to come or São Paulo didn't accept our bid. If they need the money so badly we might as well push to sign him. Might as well up the bid and ask them to throw in another player for free. I wouldn't be against Pato but he still belongs to Corinthians"
OCLions,3du2rq,logjam13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah the reports of what Orlando City SC offered and what São Paulo FC want for Ganso started flowing out after Ataíde Gil Guerreiromade made those statements.  I have a feeling that was a reaction to Round 1 offer. The fact that São Paulo owes Orlando City money for Kaka still means business is not closed.  They have a debt and haven't repaid it, so I imagine this will be drawn out until they do pay for his Loan.  From the looks of it they don't have the money to do it.... so player plus cash will be the most likely solution. Just a matter of time and possibly what player if not Ganso.  I completely agree with you on Pato. Pieced together reports I've got from more Brazilian sites and at the mercy of Google Translate have sort of pieced this together on Alexandre Pato:  Corinthians is in WAY OVER their head on his contract. They have him loaned out to São Paulo FC, they can't afford his contract, and payed AC Milan €15 million for him. AC Milan has made an offer to buy him back for €9 million. As you can see financially Corinthians will come off that deal looking like fools. AC Milan will profit €6 Million for letting them take Pato's contract off the books for 2 years. So they are desperately looking for another buyer to move Pato. QPR has turned down the offer (Can't tell if this was original offer or there was a 2nd attempt to sell him to QPR) and only other offer on the table for Pato is Lazio. However, Lazio is offering only €7.17 - €9 million. (read 3 different amounts on Lazio offer)   So Brazil media thinking Alexandre Pato is stuck in Brazil until they take an offer and eat the loss. Also wouldn't be surprised if a MLS deal is struck, only league they can think of that is willing and capable of taking the financial risk."
OCLions,3du2rq,logjam13,4,Sun Jul 19 15:08:09 2015 UTC,"I've read reports that Corinthians' owner is praying to sell Pato. He hasn't been great in Brazil, but he's still got some skill. Wouldn't be as impactful as Chicharito, but I'm not sure how many options we have at striker"
OCLions,3du2rq,logjam13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed... but especially after last night I really feel OCSC needs a right winger.  Alexandre Pato fills the ideal situation of a Striker w/ Right Wing flexibility. Paulo Ganso has right wing ability but more of a facilitator at AMF spot.  Either player would be a VAST upgrade for the squad, but it's just a matter of closing the deal with financially desperate clubs trying to save face.... best of luck with that Orlando City."
OCLions,3du2rq,churwifg,2,Sun Jul 19 15:30:39 2015 UTC,"Well ESPN Brazil had this to say about Ganso:   And the player, who lives bad time in the São Paulo club, like what was proposed   And about SPFC:   the proposal is very interesting to Tricolor. Also according to one of these people, ""the São Paulo only accepted if it is not crazy.""   So it sounds like Ganso would come if São Paulo would accept a bid. Transfermarkt has his assumed market value at $10.8m, so I can see if they value him similarly that $4.8m is a low offer. If they do owe us $2m, maybe we can meet in the middle"

Everyone in the wall needs to play a part in self policing the section so that we don't lose privileges.   We also had some issues with RBNY fans sitting in the wall area, some wearing purple."

OCLions,3dslmm,Whitegoldteeth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:51:10 2015 UTC,You can see the moment the crowd realizes whats happening. So awesome.
OCLions,3dslmm,catch_th3m_all,15,Sun Jul 19 15:29:01 2015 UTC,"Well that was very frustrating to watch. We had great possession, even while playing with only 10 men. We had a lot of successful attacks, but like much of the season thus far we struggled to finish. Mostly I'm disappointed because when we lose I want it to be because we were the weaker team, not because the ref decided we should lose in the first half. That could have been a really great game."
OCLions,3dslmm,AnInsanityHour,2,Sun Jul 19 01:45:38 2015 UTC,"Given that the Lions were playing with 10 men, that match could've been a lot more boring."
OCLions,3dslmm,misanthropicbuddha,16,Sun Jul 19 02:22:04 2015 UTC,"MLS refs 2 - Orlando 0  Ps. On a serious note, we cannot finish."
OCLions,3dslmm,TheBrutalLad,18,Sun Jul 19 01:37:05 2015 UTC,Yeah when the ref took off our starting striker I wonder why we couldn't finish...
OCLions,3dslmm,AdolfTheBenevolent,2,Sun Jul 19 01:44:07 2015 UTC,Or cross. Those crosses were absolute shit.
OCLions,3dslmm,whtge8,2,Sun Jul 19 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"on a serious note, we do not take shots."
OCLions,3dslmm,Wheaties466,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah we don't, that hesitation or one too many passes at the top of the box is so frustrating. Like for fucks sake someone just put their laces through once, test the keeper out."
OCLions,3dslmm,TheBrutalLad,2,Sun Jul 19 04:57:52 2015 UTC,"The Ref needs to be the New Jersey Energy Drinks Man of the Match  Ps. On a serious note about the finishing, is it just me or does Larin just stand around after taking a shot or something doesn't go his way?"
OCLions,3dslmm,OCSC407,3,Sun Jul 19 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"He's 19, he's still learning. Remember that the plan was for him to be loaned to Louisville this year and start Paterson up top.... he's done as well as we can expect if not better.  Still has a ways to go obviously; but he's done well considering."
OCLions,3dslmm,j_andrew_h,-6,Sun Jul 19 02:55:08 2015 UTC,"So.... I'm just curious... at what point do you guys start holding the players accountable for being reckless and giving the refs the opportunity to go for a card?  Was there a reason for a studs up challenge in midfield?  I love the fan loyalty, but I hope our players are holding themselves accountable, even if the fans aren't."
OCLions,3dslmm,secretlyadog,7,Sun Jul 19 04:17:42 2015 UTC,"We hold them accountable for all their decisions, but as almost the whole majority of other people say, it wasn't a red card foul(A yellow at most), even Red Bull supporters saying so. There was no malicious intent from Larin in the tackle. He didn't even touch him with his studs and he pulled back his other foot to avoid the tackle. The officiating has been extremely poor in the past weeks so it is leaving us frustrated so it may seem like all we do is complain, but we will hold all players accountable for bad things they do."
OCLions,3dslmm,TheBrutalLad,-8,Sun Jul 19 04:30:58 2015 UTC,Was there a reason for a studs up challenge in midfield?
OCLions,3dslmm,secretlyadog,0,Sun Jul 19 04:41:02 2015 UTC,"I've been saying that all season. Brek, Collin, Kaka, Larin, all those tackles were unnecessary. I know the referee went too far and extended the red when a yellow was sufficient, but stop with these silly tackles, save it for the when we need a goal saving foul like Suarez did in the 2010 World cup"
OCLions,3dslmm,LiamLiamLiamLiam,0,Sun Jul 19 10:52:15 2015 UTC,"All of the fans cry and cry about how unfair the refs are and I'm OK with that (the downvotes are a little sad, but w/e, they're just fans they're entitled to be a little naive).  But when the players start doing it instead of taking responsibility for their stupid and reckless play I just can't take it.   Someone needs to send this guy into the dressing room before the game."
OCLions,3dslmm,secretlyadog,6,Sun Jul 19 22:03:24 2015 UTC,"Alright, I started giving my opinion in my ratings post, but it's better if I give it here, obviously.  I thought this 0-2 performance was a lot better than the 0-2 performance against Dallas.  The Lions looked more put together than last week and played some pretty good football.  The first goal was a shot into the upper 90 in which I was surprised Tally even got a touch on it.  The second goal was a bit crap, but I felt like Collin and St. Ledger were gassed at that point.  My big criticism tonight was not really finishing, rather the set pieces from the corners.  I thought more could've been done with those, but I also know what I ask for is a difficult thing to do.  Even though the finishing could've been better, I think Rivas is looking much better and all of his shots tonight were either blocked or veered just wide, no Pluto shots.  I do hope Rivas keeps up his non-MLS performance against Chicago.  Oh yeah, I should probably comment on the cards: Higuita needs to have more self-discipline (which is easier for me to say than do) as he's now gone for the next match, and Larin's red was...how do I elegantly write this...a tad harsh.  Clumsy challenge?  Yes.  Yellow?  Yes.  Red?  A little too much in the ""bullshit"" department for me to accept that.  Oh well, off for my nightly Guinness and a sad nap.  Have a good one mates."
OCLions,3dslmm,misanthropicbuddha,3,Sun Jul 19 02:29:17 2015 UTC,"I believe the only reason he got a red was due to acting. Had he touched the player with his studs I would totally agree on a red card, but since he completely missed him should have been a yellow. I still don't get why Collin getting kicked in the back of the neck with studs and bleeding didn't get a red. That is a dangerous way to play and should be harshly penalized."
OCLions,3dslmm,arabidpolarbear,2,Sun Jul 19 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the acting was spot on since that resulted in Larin's red. As for Collin, I believe a yellow was only given because the ref told the guy that if I don't yellow you, this place will riot.  Also, I believe the ref's reason for the no-red was that since Collin led with his head, the boot to the head wasn't malicious."
OCLions,3dslmm,misanthropicbuddha,7,Sun Jul 19 15:01:10 2015 UTC,Once again a horrible referee dictating the game.   On a positive note Ashe looked really good on the pitch and it is wonderful to have Darwin Cerén back from the Gold Cup.   Let's hope for the best against ChIcago midweek and NYCFC next weekend
OCLions,3dslmm,sault9,2,Sun Jul 19 01:57:36 2015 UTC,Ashe looked fucking spectacular.  But our players are going to be gassed after playing a man down for 60 minutes...   Hopefully Chicago is gassed as well after playing CBus 2ce in 4 days.
OCLions,3dslmm,secretlyadog,3,Sun Jul 19 04:21:38 2015 UTC,How did Heath get sent off? My phone died right before halftime and didn't get to a computer until the 90th minute just in time to get my heart ripped out.
OCLions,3dslmm,TandBinc,6,Sun Jul 19 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"He was arguing the shot taken by Hiquita. Also, Ted Unkel told the other ref to pull out the red on Larin."
OCLions,3dslmm,Whitegoldteeth,2,Sun Jul 19 02:37:42 2015 UTC,i saw them consulting over their wireless mics. Good to know the side ref didnt make the call as he wasnt even signaling a penalty.
OCLions,3dslmm,Wheaties466,5,Sun Jul 19 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"I just want to watch and participate in a fair game. If we lose because we got out played, then so be it, but this is getting horrible."
OCLions,3dslmm,whtge8,7,Sun Jul 19 04:16:56 2015 UTC,"Man, we are gonna get a shit reputation for blaming the refs every game, but it feels like EVERY FUCKING GAME WE GET FUCKED or we win. Also, why the hell were fans doing the wave in the 80th minute? Nothing pisses me off more than bullshit red cards and fans doing the wave."
OCLions,3dslmm,ChemE_nolifer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:58:11 2015 UTC,"Why does someone else's enjoyment of the game piss you off?  There were like 25000 people that enjoyed it, there's absolutely zero reason to hate on it. Do I like the wave? Not really, but I'm not going to rain on their parade for doing it"
OCLions,3dslmm,-Champloo-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"In this instance it was pretty simple. Literally 5 minutes before Heath had asked the crowd to get fired up. The announcers described it as him saying ""Let's get behind these boys, lets get behind our team....He's looking at the crowd saying we need you now""....instead, they do the silent woooooo of a wave.   The wave is the only mass fan interaction that draws attention away from the game for participants and non-participants. Ramos had an amazing tackle during the wave, one that normally garners a roar from the crowd, but sounded like half the fans missed it. After playing a man down for 50 minutes and hauling ass like Ramos did all game, the crowd was too busy paying attention to the wave to acknowledge Ramos' hustle and heart which is what the team needed.   I don't feel as if the wave is ""someone else's enjoyment of the game"". I feel as if it is someone else's lack of enjoyment of the game. As if the battle in front of them is not entertaining enough that they want to do something else for fun. Have you ever been in the section that starts the wave? Afterwards they are never like ""Oh boy this game is so fun, the players are probably really fired up about the wave."" Instead they are like, ""look how cool we are we got thousands of people to pay less attention to the game and more attention to us.""   /end rant"
OCLions,3dslmm,ChemE_nolifer,2,Sun Jul 19 17:33:56 2015 UTC,Fuck these ARs and 4th officals deciding we need reds.  That is at least the 3rd time this year and there is zero excuse for it.

OCLions,3dslmm,Widan,12,Sun Jul 19 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"He's on pace to break the rookie scoring record, he's Canada's hope at striker, and he's been our most consistent finisher outside of Kaka.

Why are they making the same mistakes they were making week 1?   • Quit giving the refs and excuse to red card you. I know it's fun to play Red-Card-Roulette and see if you can try your luck, but you don't have any. No luck. Quit it.  • Shoot the fucking ball in the direction of the fucking goal. We were attacking the whole damned time for 30 minutes before Larin went all slidey-slidey and ruined the game and we had like 2 shots. Quit trying to pass it in all the time. If you shoot from outside teams will actually open up because they have to try and defend those. At this point I think they should just start taking random people from the crowd and seeing if they can shoot on frame.   FUCK"
OCLions,3ds62r,secretlyadog,4,Sun Jul 19 01:19:00 2015 UTC,How is that red on the coaching?  There was barely a yellow card in that much less a red.  He didn't do anything worthy of the card... what do you want to do?
OCLions,3ds62r,j_andrew_h,0,Sun Jul 19 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"The players keep giving the refs chances to make bad calls.   Don't want to give up a PK, don't go to ground in the box.   Don't want to get a soft red, don't slide in with your studs showing, don't throw your arms up on a guy on the counter, don't shove a guy from behind and then step over him.  Don't want to get called for handball then don't hold your hands away from your body.  This is basic soccer stuff here guys.  I'm not saying they're good calls. I'm saying our players are naive and unprofessional for repeatedly giving the refs opportunities to make bad calls.  Kaka petulantly shoves a player and then accidentally steps on him.   Larin dives in studs up.  Repeatedly giving the ref chances to fuck us is naive and unprofessional. Heath can whine all he want about the bad refs, but at this point it is coming down to bad coaching.   At this point the ""refs are out to get us"" shtick is as tiring as the players. The refs aren't out to get us, they are just bad, and we're terrible at managing their badness."
OCLions,3ds62r,secretlyadog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:13:01 2015 UTC,I disagree with every single point.
OCLions,3ds62r,OCinNYC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:14:59 2015 UTC,Then have fun whining about how unfair MLS is as we miss the playoffs because of constantly playing down a man.  MLS officiating has been this way for 10+ years. Heath being upset is not going to change it.
OCLions,3ds62r,secretlyadog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:17:13 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about??  Your points are absurd. You are literally saying that a slide tackle in the box shouldn't happen. That larin's tackle shoudn't have happened despite the fact that the even the Red Bulls feed thought it was ludicrous and will be overturned.   Soft Red? its a soft yellow.   People aren't mad at mad about how bad MLS officiating is, which it is, they are mad about the inconsistent administrations of said officiating. Your points address none of them, and your response to me addresses nothing other than whining that I haven't made and bitching about a team's performance that has nothing to do with what I said or anything else."
OCLions,3ds62r,OCinNYC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:28:03 2015 UTC,"(Sorry for wall of text)  I'm saying if you go to ground in the box you risk giving up a PK.   If you stick your arm out, even in in the act of running, or to maintain balance, you risk a handball.  If you go studs up, even if you fail miserably to make contact, you risk a red card.  Sometimes the ref calls it, sometimes he doesn't, but you run the risk.  If you can't grasp that I don't know what to say. These are basic indisputable facts of soccer.   My points do not address the inconsistencies of the officiating because that is completely out of our hands, but not making stupid mistakes is within our control, and everyone would rather blather on about the refs and stick their heads in the sand when it comes to the players.  Our fouls are obvious, and pointless.  There was no need to go studs up in a challenge there.   There is no need to flail your arm out on a counter-attack like Boden did last week.  There is no need to petulantly run down the RSL player that Kaka stomped very gently grazed with his foot.  These are obvious and pointless fouls that give the opportunity for the ref to fuck us, and also the play itself benefits us not at all. This is the first part of what I'm trying to say: We do dumb stuff that risks getting us fucked by the ref and we do it for very little gain.   In fact, if you look at the entire season as a whole, we are getting schooled in the art of cheapness. While our players are committing clear as day fouls, and then getting red carded for it (deserving or not), Kaka is getting tripped off the ball and the refs just wave ""advantage"". Little cheap shots go unnoticed.  I understand where you people are coming from.   In the opening day game Villa earned a red card for Collin because Collin went in studs up (noticing a trend?) and Villa rolled around on the ground like he'd been shot.   Then two games later Collin gets a studs up challenge and immediately jumps up and screams at the ref, resulting in a yellow card for the Vancouver player. We might have won that game had the rule been applied equally. We might have won that game if Collin had acted like he'd been murdered in the same way Villa did.  Here is the crispy center of what I'm trying to say: The refs suck, we know the refs suck, the whole league knows the refs suck. THAT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE BITCH.   Other teams use it to their advantage. Their fouls are generally small ""chippy"" fouls that stop play and don't get you a straight red, and when we do something they absolutely play act as hard as they can.   Did you see Robbie Rogers dive last night vs. San Jose? Got a free kick, didn't it. We can't even dive properly.   Literally every team in the league cheats the refs, but we make it easy for ourselves to be cheated.  You want the perfect example?   Ramos vs. Cbus. He gets fouled, obviously fouled, and then gets up clearly angry and goes in hard on a challenge. Referee pulls out the yellow and Cbus swarms the ref and Ramos gets red-carded and we get fucking shit-pounded like a Mexican gang initiation.   Why did he go in hard? It was 20 yards from Cbus goal. No need.   Why did Kaka run over Saborio (who definitely drew that by slowing down and falling) when he was by the touchline?   Why did Larin go in studs up near midfield?   The refs may belong on OBT, but we belong on a webcam site because we are fucking ourselves in front of thousands of people."

I am not trying to be a cunt with Rivas, and I understand the other examples I used are not the same position.

I would only say that with our offensive injuries, Kaka is the only player that get's our offense going; so while Ceren has been great for defense and transition to the attack, without Kaka the attack would end pretty quickly.    I really hope we bring in another attacking player or two to get through the rest of this season and playoffs (hopefully); but I'm also excited about next season where hopefully we'll be starting over in terms of health and our young players will be more settled in here."

The squad really looks up to him and tries to emulate his work ethic. He is the heart and soul of this team. Don't get me wrong - I think Ceren is an absolute monster and is extremely underrated. I just don't see how you can compete against a guy who completely changes the mind set of your entire team."
OCLions,3dnhjd,beefncheez712,4,Sat Jul 18 06:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think I totally agree here.  Ceren is by far and away my mvp for the first half.  A couple costly mistakes but no more than anyone else.  But his upside is just crazy.  Those passing stats say a lot (although we do a lot of back and lateral passing).  Ceren is everywhere on the field, constantly causing issues in midfield, great tackles, and is probably the main reason our defense has done so well and our possession numbers are so high."

OCLions,3dmtdj,Generalparks,2,Sat Jul 18 12:21:26 2015 UTC,"I know Carlos Rivas' purchase price from Deportivo Cali raised him above the Designated Player line. Also heard that is why Christian Higuita was ""thrown in"" the deal to break the purchase cost over two players instead of one.  However, I've read he is making WAY MORE than $60,000 annually.  I can't find the post report I read back in late may that stated it was a 5 year deal. However, I did find the report that matched the dollar amount of other report.  Both reports had him making £16,923 weekly ($26,438) and £880,000 annually ($1.374,784)...  The one source I can still find says it's a one year deal, but other one I can't find had same numbers but contract was 5 years long.  Are these reports wrong? Seems to me that the contract they are reporting of $1,375,000 a year for Carlos Rivas is more likely than the $60,000 a year a contract the Sentinel is reporting. Especially since Orlando City SC had to out bid other European Clubs for Carlos Rivas.  http://sportspayroll.com/carlos-rivas-salary-orlando-city-sc/"
OCLions,3dmtdj,logjam13,5,Fri Jul 17 16:09:34 2015 UTC,I'm more inclined to believe the 60k number since it came from the MLSPU today when they released salary information for each club.  It does seem like he should be making more though.
OCLions,3dmtdj,Squiggyrocks,4,Fri Jul 17 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"Tenorio said it's possible that Deportivo Cali is still paying him with some of the transfer fee, so he's probably making more, but MLS is paying him $60k"
OCLions,3dmtdj,SuperBOOTH,2,Fri Jul 17 21:34:49 2015 UTC,Is anyone not noticing Ribeiro's pay? I'd say he's higher than that.
OCLions,3dmtdj,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"I COMPLETELY agree with you he is worth WAY MORE than $60,000 a year, and I'm sure that will change next year. Right up there with Darwin Cerén, he should be making Okugo money, and if Orlando City SC doesn't give him a huge pay increase I wouldn't blame him for leaving.... REALLY hope he doesn't.  Back to Ribeiro, the contract is not too surprising to me.  I don't think Philadelphia knew what they had. He is a phenomenal athlete, but coming up through Coastal Carolina it's hard to get great scouting in that Conference.  Doesn't matter if it's basketball, football, baseball, or any other sport... scouts are really reliant on word of mouth and distributed video, which is usually team video used for training and game study.  Outside of Coastal Carolina the other Big South Conference ""Powerhouse Teams"" are as followed, Liberty University, Radford University, Campbell University, Charleston Southern University, and Winthrop University has been known to make some National noise with their basketball program. Easy to see how a soccer player's true potential can go unnoticed in that situation.   Now Philadelphia drafted Ribeiro and he bounced around the field from midfield, to backline, and to forward... and bounced back and forth between MLS and USL.  It was bad scouting and bad management on Philadelphia's part.  Now here he is in Orlando and they knew exactly what they wanted him for and I think surprised them too with his effectiveness as a forward. As much fun as it is watching him attacking, I say the position he is destined for is AMF, especially after the West Brom match.  His lack of break away speed is null and void. He has the ability to control the ball while being engaged by a defender, the size to see the field above defenders marking him, and the strength to move defenders while they're draped all over him.   This is just my humble scouting of Pedro Ribeiro. If I was trying to explain the type of athlete he is to a non soccer savvy person... I'd say he has: ""Ben Roethlisberger's field management with Zach Randolph's back-to-the-basket game""  I'm not sure when his contract is up, but like Cerén he is due a pay raise.  Perfect back-up to Kaká and in an emergency can play up front.  As important as the AMF is in Adrian Heath's 4-2-3-1, Pedro Ribeiro is easily worth $110,000 - $150,000 in MLS.  At least if I was his agent I would just look at payroll and say my client is worth more to this team than Martin Paterson, Tony Cascio, and possibly Lewis Neal (Age Factor)... he should be payed as such"

OCLions,3dmzer,AThievingStableBoy,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:37 2015 UTC,Here is the link to the game on StubHub if you don't like Ticketmaster.  We usually have one or two looking to sell so keep checking back here if you don't find any on StubHub that you like.
OCLions,3dmzer,Generalparks,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:03 2015 UTC,Hey thanks! If it comes down to the wire I'll probably go with stubhub.  Whats the scalper situation like in FL? Is it easy to find tickets by just showing up to the stadium with a little cash?
OCLions,3dmzer,Generalparks,3,Fri Jul 17 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"There's usually some outside doing the whole ""Anybody need tickets? Anybody selling tickets?"" thing.  Not sure if they have legit tickets or not so I'd be wary about buying from them.  You could also just buy tickets from the box office if you wanted when you get there.  At least you'll know those are legit haha."
OCLions,3dmzer,Generalparks,2,Fri Jul 17 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"ahhh yes the old box office, sometimes I forget those exist. Do you guys sell out a lot though?"
OCLions,3dmzer,Generalparks,3,Fri Jul 17 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"We ""sell out"" but the beauty of being in the Citrus Bowl is they just open more sections.  Just looking at the Ticketmaster site you shouldn't have issues being able to buy walk up tickets."

Another great option is to park in downtown Orlando and enjoy the block party & bars around Church Street Station then follow the crowd to the free busses over to the Citrus Bowl.

OCLions,3dkqqv,1899cule,3,Fri Jul 17 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"They leave from a spot across from the Church Street Station location closer to the Amway Center arena.

OCLions,3djibx,Bdog98z,3,Thu Jul 16 19:48:44 2015 UTC,I'll just copy my post from the thread on /r/MLS: This would be a nice addition. Player in his prime (25) that can play on the right wing and spell Kaka next year when everyone is healthy. Agree that striker is still a concern but if Larin can keep form and Rochez gets back in form I think we could be ok up top.
OCLions,3djibx,Generalparks,3,Thu Jul 16 19:55:32 2015 UTC,"I'd still like us to sign a proven striker. Larin has been in outstanding form and Rochez has shown he can score well for Honduras, but we can't rely on 20 y/o to carry the whole load and perform consistently. Paterson hasn't proven he can stay healthy"
OCLions,3djibx,logjam13,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong I'd love a proven striker as well, I'm just saying the potential exists up top to be really good."
OCLions,3djibx,Generalparks,3,Thu Jul 16 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"Another update... possibly not completely shot down: http://citysoccertalk.com/rumor-ganso-linked-to-orlando-city/   UPDATE (July 17, 2015 – 1:35 pm): According to a piece published by terra.com in Brazil, Orlando City has inquired about Ganso in part due to financial obligations still owed by Sao Paulo to Orlando City from the loan of Kaká. The piece states that Orlando City has asked for the player in exchange for the debt still owed to them. The article detailed the loan deal was brokered as such that Orlando City would receive around $125k per month for the length of the loan plus the proceeds from two matches – the first Kaká game in Sao Paulo and another friendly with Orlando City that never took place. Because that income was never able to be transferred to Orlando City, the report has the Lions asking for that to be settled in part with the transfer of Ganso.

OCLions,3dilhd,daguru9,5,Thu Jul 16 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"Would never say no to a player of his caliber, but central midfield is the last position we need to strengthen right now.  Plus, we can't sign anyone until we make a roster spot available"
OCLions,3dilhd,logjam13,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:28 2015 UTC,"They are not going to announce loans or send anyone away until they have someone actually signed...  Easy to loan three more to LCFC...  Plus I thought maybe they might consider shutting Casico down for the rest of the season (IR), this would free his roster spot.  Also haven't heard the latest on Heath, so not sure about his health either..."
OCLions,3dilhd,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't just be loaning players to Louisville to free up spots and probably couldn't.  They're not going to take a player they don't need just because we say so and if they're going to ride the pine they might as well do it where they can train with the 1st team.  Putting Cascio on the IR would free up a roster spot, but his salary would still count against the cap and it would limit who we could bring in.  If he's going to count against the cap and could have an impact this season, might as well keep him active.  Heath will probably be out for 4-6 weeks so that won't open up a spot either.  Regardless, we can't register a player until someone moves so we're definitely doing work behind the scenes on both but we'll announce a departure before a signing, just like with Ford and Ashe"
OCLions,3dilhd,SoccerTalker,0,Thu Jul 16 17:42:04 2015 UTC,"If you loan someone to a USL team he is still considered to be on your MLS roster & doesn't not free up a spot to my knowledge. That's why MLS team are able to recall the players from loan. Unless the player is on an interleague loan (cascio w/ the dynamo last year), which is different. That is my understanding at least."
OCLions,3dilhd,logjam13,5,Thu Jul 16 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"Rivera is on loan to Louisville City and does not count against our roster cap. We have 31/28 players and Molino (IR), Ford (loan), and Rivera (loan) don't count towards the active roster. Loaned players don't have a salary cap hit either, but Molino's salary still counts against it"
OCLions,3dilhd,SoccerTalker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:04:53 2015 UTC,You are correct. I fucking hate MLS... Guess then at the end of the loan you would just have to loan again or cut players by roster compliance deadline.
OCLions,3dilhd,SoccerTalker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:15:12 2015 UTC,Also if you had any interest in recalling the player during the season then you couldn't replace them on the roster if it would cap your spots... That makes more sense I guess.
OCLions,3dilhd,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"At least next season we'll have the USL squad so Rivera, etc. can stay with the club. Kind of excited to have a whole 2nd team so we don't have these issues"
OCLions,3dilhd,SoccerTalker,0,Thu Jul 16 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, makes it easier to get around the around the rules and have more players in the bag. Only issue then is you can't recall them up from loan because you would have filled their roster spot with someone else? Unless you can loan another player back down, but I feel like at some point MLS rules have to prevent against doing this constantly, no?"
OCLions,3dilhd,logjam13,2,Thu Jul 16 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"Ideally, we wouldn't need to fill all 28 spots so we could loan up at our leisure"
OCLions,3dgjup,Whitegoldteeth,5,Thu Jul 16 02:31:44 2015 UTC,completely agree with the statement that he looked much more like his 2007 form. I think we are about to see Kaka show everyone why he is the best player in MLS the next few weeks.

OCLions,3dgccd,Generalparks,3,Thu Jul 16 01:29:33 2015 UTC,Hoping for the best for Heath but it sounds like he'll be done for the year.  Nice for all 3 DP's to get on the score sheet but these mid season friendlies are a no win scenario for us.
OCLions,3dgccd,logjam13,5,Thu Jul 16 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, they're not no-win. Estrela, Turner, Redding, Donovan, Edwards, Mwanga and Rochez all got some playing time that they haven't been able to get. With the USL squad next season we could theoretically loan up some guys to play so we're not risking key players. Plus it's Premier League competition, albeit preseason, and they'll get better from playing against some of the best"
OCLions,3dgccd,logjam13,4,Thu Jul 16 02:13:55 2015 UTC,"True, no-win wasn't the best phrase to use there.  I always like playing the younger guys and getting them experience.  I meant it as there is a lot more to lose than there is to gain as has been demonstrated with both Molino and Heath going down in a friendly game."
OCLions,3dgccd,Popcornshrimpeater,5,Thu Jul 16 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if Heath has a non-contact ACL tear like Molino did it could have happened at any time. Kevin probably would have torn it that same month. If it was a tackle or something that was a direct result of the match I'd be more inclined to agree. But still, if we could just play our U23s and end of the bench guys I'd be happy"
OCLions,3dgccd,spikebaylor,4,Thu Jul 16 02:22:52 2015 UTC,True.  Next year I wont make such a big deal about it since we can call up younger guys from the USL team and give all our starters and contributors a break.  I just hate seeing guys go down in non league/cup matches.
OCLions,3dgccd,TheBrutalLad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"According to coach Heath though it's just a dislocated patella, so he shouldn't be out long-term like Molino"
OCLions,3dgccd,spikebaylor,4,Thu Jul 16 12:14:34 2015 UTC,"Just my thoughts from the game.  Estrella looked great.  I'd feel better with him coming in than Okugo at this point.  Although Okugo had a decent game for himself as well.  Redding looked pretty good too.  Certainly not enough to come in and take over as a starter, but solid enough to come off the bench if we need him.  Donovan and Redding looked really good together.  I could see that partnership blossoming into something really good in a year or two.  Rochez looked promising.  Probably still needs to work on some fitness after his visa debacle, but very promising.  We REALLY REALLY need to work on getting off those through balls and over the top balls much quicker.  We're offside half the time because the passer takes an extra touch or two when the forward is making his run.  Rochez made a lot of nice runs and either never got a look, or the ball was held for far too long.  That last play to setup his goal was perfect, we need more of that.  I've said it before, but Mwanga hasn't looked half bad the past couple times he's gotten minutes.  I'm not saying he's making waves but he hasn't been the lump of rocks he was at the beginning of the season.  Edwards Jr is #2.  Absolutely no reason in my mind for Ricketts to be in the 18 over him.  The defense had a bad lapse on WBA's goal, but Ricketts just stood there and watched it roll past him and into the goal.  It wasn't a rocket or anything, it just... rolled in.  Edwards still has some learning to do, but he is aggressive when he needs to be, fairly quick and assertive with his judgement.  He's going to be very good.  Rivas... you confuse me.  At times he's amazing.  Great off the ball work, fairly decent service into the box, fantastic left foot.  Other times we get the Rivas who can't complete a pass, or hit the broad side of the citrus bowl.  I want the good Rivas, for a full 90.  I want more of that goal from Kaka.  I know he's a nice guy, and he doesn't want to be selfish.  You make almost 3 times as much as the rest of the team combined, be selfish and put that ball in the net!"

OCLions,3dgccd,TheBrutalLad,4,Thu Jul 16 01:31:29 2015 UTC,Estrella looked great.  We have arguably the best Def mid in the league especially with our depth.
OCLions,3dgccd,shulmand,0,Thu Jul 16 01:37:06 2015 UTC,One of my biggest surprises when I was at mid field for the Dallas game was how quality of a player Estrela was. I could see him surveying the whole field and knowing what he was going to do before he even touched the ball.
OCLions,3dgccd,jmoney0999,4,Thu Jul 16 03:24:39 2015 UTC,Estrella didn't play against Dallas tho?

We ended up talking them down to $50 for 2, but we got into the Citrus Bowl ~10 min into the match. Keep in mind, that game had bad weather (started around 30 min after kickoff), was a team that wasn't as big a draw (FC Dallas), and it was without Kaka.  Your best bet may be to go to this Facebook group if you can't find anything on Craigslist or Stubhub."

OCLions,3de4ag,daguru9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"One of the issues that we have is that we can't bring trialists in. We wanted to get one or two of our players from the academy an opportunity to maybe step up and play this time but the league won't allow us to do it. Something to do with the CBA, which is an issue.   can anyone explain this? how would trialists conflict with the CBA?"
OCLions,3de4ag,babacristo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"It was explained some where else, but can't find it...  I think basically the issue is that if they play in friendlies, the player has to be paid.  If you used a trialist, you would have to contract them and they would have to be on your roster.  Which would be counter to them being a trialist...  If you tried to use an academy player (from the OCSC U23 team), they would have to be paid which would kill their amateur status.  Which means they could no longer be an academy player and would be ineligible if the are in or going to college.  If we had a local USL team, this would be different.  We could ""loan"" the players from that team and play them.  Then return them after the game..."
OCLions,3ddlg5,Jhiguera,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:06:26 2015 UTC,"I am not sure that would be the best move to be honest, the man is nearing 35 and despite any chemistry he could possibly have with Kaka his age would hinder most of his performance. Focusing on younger talent, someone maybe older than Larin with some experience would be a way better asset to the team."
OCLions,3ddlg5,TheBrutalLad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not comparing him to Stevie G, Lampard, or Pirlo by any means, but it is going to be evident how players with experience make a team better. I just feel that if we can get him at a low price, he might not be a bad asset to have to teach and guide Larin or Rivas or any player for that matter that are struggling to find the back of the net.

OCLions,3ddlg5,connermost,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure if Luis Fabiano is the answer.  In his day he was a great # 9, but may be too old now.  I really wish that O City had more Brazilians for Kaka to play with.  You can see that he and Ribero have an innate understanding of each other that may not exist between Kaka and other members of the team.   Brazilians play in a certain eyes-in-the-back-of-their-heads style with a lot of organic anticipation that you just don't see everywhere.    I notice when watching the USMNT that there is a definite lack of vision in their movement.  It's as if they have to see a situation, then think, then move rather than be moving in anticipation of the situation developing.    I think two or three Brasilians would help Kaka and the team greatly."

Checking in because I saw OP post in our sub before I suggested this would be the best place to ask.   224 is where away supporters sit. I haven't been there myself so I can't speak to the view but I do know it's a covered section so no need to worry about sun or rain.   Food & drinks are expensive so be warned.   If you're trying to figure out how to get to the stadium use Google maps and hit the transit option. It gets you all the train times.   Most of the guys who traveled down to Orlando said aside from a few individuals everyone was really nice. Hope you guys like it here!

OCLions,3d9zkb,-kemosabe,2,Wed Jul 15 02:56:59 2015 UTC,I think there's a pretty good chance of that happening.  Cuba hasn't looked super at all.
OCLions,3d9zkb,Generalparks,2,Wed Jul 15 00:13:55 2015 UTC,counter argument to that would be that im sure that there is going to be plenty of players that are going to play wednesday that will play a full 90 on saturday.
OCLions,3d9zkb,Generalparks,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:48 2015 UTC,Valid point.  All depends on how long they play tonight and when they are able to get back in town if they are eliminated.

It is basically in his court to decided to move to the MLS and take the OCSC offer or stay in Europe.

OCLions,3d10s5,sault9,4,Sun Jul 12 17:17:02 2015 UTC,I would agree.
OCLions,3d10s5,j_andrew_h,3,Sun Jul 12 19:54:47 2015 UTC,They were a better team than a starting line up consisting of mostly 2nd string MLS players.  Tally Hall was the only proven MLS starter in our lineup last night.  Obviously our guys that weren't in MLS previously it's hard to judge; but you get what I'm saying.  We literally had no attack other than trying to spring Rivas's speed and hoping for the best which isn't much when we can't do anything else and he's shooting 20 rows up still.
OCLions,3d10s5,daguru9,2,Mon Jul 13 01:27:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love some of the potential some of our players do have and I love that the program sees that, but that being; their consistency is lacking. Yes, it appeared as we were just hoping for the best like spraying and praying sort of thing."
OCLions,3d10s5,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:40 2015 UTC,"The only one at there that was not a regular starter or featured sub was Heath.  Everyone else had been a regular start for several weeks, so we can't really use that excuse."
OCLions,3d10s5,daguru9,2,Mon Jul 13 12:11:18 2015 UTC,"I certainly understand that; but Avila, Neal, Ribiero were all bench players for other MLS clubs and none of them were expected to be starters here either.  The only reason they have been starters is because we have no other options.  The difference is that we usually have Kaka that makes the players around him better in part because he draws the attention from the defense and because he has that rare ability to manage the game.  Without Kaka on the field our current lineup is exposed for what it is; mostly backups and unproven players.    Please take this the right way though; I think they have played amazingly well all things considered and I love the heart and team play they have given us but we are in dire need of some luck on the health front and new blood coming in as well."
OCLions,3d10s5,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jul 13 12:56:58 2015 UTC,"If we are going by what happened last year, then nearly all of the team were bench players last year or minor league guys; including Shea.  Most of these guys have been regular starters this year and did not play up to even those standards, so IMHO I would not say they played amazing.    I agree that most are not who were expected to be the starters or ""stars"" of the team, but it is what it is and these guys have been our starters and have performed much better in past games.  But I do not think that they were the biggest reasons for what happened in this game:  1) Bad game plan/tactics for first half 2) Bad formation for first half 3) Less than stellar on-field performance  I think Coach and the staff was hoping/wishing for more from some of them and have been disappointed in some of the performances.  They are doing the best that they can, some are just not up to the challenge... I do agree that we need some luck on the health front and definitely need some new blood.   I think we could all agree about this... THANK GOD WE ARE IN THE EAST!  :)"
OCLions,3d10s5,daguru9,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:50:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't mean that we played amazingly Saturday night; that was pure crap... I was referring to being about 4th in the East (yes thank god for the East), that we've been able to get results while still not having anywhere near an ideal line-up.      I agree that it was too optimistic that the 11 out there for the 1st half could play the 4-2-3-1 well enough and pulling Harrison at the half is bad because it shows he never should have been out there in the 1st place.    I was sure that we would come out in something more defensive like the 4-3-2-1 with Higuita and Okugo & Avila (or Neal) across the DM line and then some combination of Ribeiro, Rivas and (either Neal or Avilia) in the top three positions.   It still wouldn't have been pretty soccer; but probably a better lineup given what we had available."
OCLions,3d10s5,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:59:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure what is going on with Okugo, but it def seems that Coach does not see anything in him.  I think he is probably trade bait now..."
OCLions,3d10s5,daguru9,2,Mon Jul 13 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"I just don't think he's a good fit.  Philly fans loved him and early in the season when we were probably playing a more basic game; he looked solid on defense and didn't expose us offensively.  Once things started getting more complex it just looked like his passing and ""going forward"" skills just weren't the right fit as much as the combination of Higuita and Ceren.  They are both so good with the ball at their feet for DMs and outside of his usual 1 terrible giveaway a game Ceren has been outstanding.    I'd love to see Okugo get a trade and find a club he's a better fit for and hopefully get us some fresh legs in an attacking mid or something."
OCLions,3d10s5,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jul 13 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"He def seems to be suited for a pure DCM, when Coach Heath prefers a more modified DCM, who can move forward if/when necessary... Almost more like a pure CM who can cover defense if necessary.  Seems to struggle moving forward..."

OCLions,3cz0fd,Wheaties466,9,Sun Jul 12 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"Posted this in the /r/MLS match thread but figured I'd post it here as well.  So that was rough.  1) was anyone else upset when we got a penalty because they knew Rivas was going to take it and rocket it far left? How can coach not foresee that? All you have to do is put it on frame?  2) Boden is the number one worst person who could've gotten a red in this match if you ask me.  3) If Ribeiro was as quick as Larin or even Ceren, we may have had some better looks tonight..? As much as I like Pedro, he doesn't seem to be fast enough to play up front if you ask me. I do like his size but I don't see him pressuring the way he should be, and Kaka not being up front feeding him shots just amplifies that problem.  Either way, we will move on and hopefully play a good game against NYRB. Not losing at home since April had me spoiled."
OCLions,3cz0fd,checkonechecktwo,6,Sun Jul 12 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"Rivas has been consistent enough at PKs. I was not expecting him to miss it that hard, but I did get a pang of hesitation when I saw him going up to take it because he was obviously exhausted and frustrated at that point. He deserves more credit than a lot of people are giving him, but he's definitely not a full 90 player yet.   can't agree more about Boden. Ribeiro needs a little work, but to be fair he was robbed with that offsides call. I think he can find a real place in the center up top without being super fast-- we've seen some great dribbling and technique from him."
OCLions,3cz0fd,babacristo,8,Sun Jul 12 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I am all about Rivas. But he should be playing left wing where Shea was and he should be using his speed and crossing skills. If he wants to take a volley he should. But I don't think he's proven accurate enough to be taking penalties in a match like this."
OCLions,3cz0fd,checkonechecktwo,4,Sun Jul 12 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"Coach Heath is literally trying to field 11 guys right now.  There are a lot of guys starting regularly that should be no more than versital backups on our squad.     We've done amazingly well considering everything, but we seriously need to catch a break real soon and get some healthy players & some new blood in this transfer window."
OCLions,3cz0fd,j_andrew_h,5,Sun Jul 12 03:08:16 2015 UTC,But do you think Rivas should be taking penalties? I'm not convinced because literally everyone was groaning that he was going to boot it to the moon and he did. I would've rather seen just about anyone take it.
OCLions,3cz0fd,checkonechecktwo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:17:28 2015 UTC,I was actually excited for him to take it.  I really thought he'd nail it (like he did in the US Open Cup) and get that monkey off his back in terms of a goal in MLS.  I really thought it would be a great relief moment for him... obviously I wasn't right on this one and it back fired completely.
OCLions,3cz0fd,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jul 13 01:19:19 2015 UTC,That's fair. Obviously I hoped he'd make it.
OCLions,3cz0fd,checkonechecktwo,2,Mon Jul 13 04:31:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying this ! Somehow people don't realize that due to our unfortunate circumstances he is literally having to piece together healthy lineups.   My only thing though was why not start okugo tonight ?
OCLions,3cz0fd,jmoney0999,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:54:44 2015 UTC,"I think Okugo gave up that second goal. Maybe I'm wrong, but he didn't track the runner who then got the assist."
OCLions,3cz0fd,Brodiaq,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:24:36 2015 UTC,I'm really shocked how Okugo has been playing... he's been poor for the last month or so.  I really like him and he seems like a GREAT guy; but I can see him as trade bait this transfer window.  DM is the only position we have depth and he proved in Philly he can play; maybe he just isn't a good fit here... I don't know.. I'm a bit stumped.
OCLions,3cz0fd,j_andrew_h,3,Mon Jul 13 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"The only thing about #2 is that Brek is only expected out 3-4 weeks and its been 2 1/2 so there is a chance he could be healthy enough by the 18th. I'm not too worried about the friendly, but hopefully he can do something."
OCLions,3cz0fd,trumpetblast,10,Sun Jul 12 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"Boden's red card might be more damning than the outcome.  Ramos and Turner have played LB before, but if we thought we were hurting for depth before...yikes"
OCLions,3cz0fd,logjam13,3,Sun Jul 12 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"yeah particularly that it was in stoppage time, and when you watch the games he is ultra important"
OCLions,3cz0fd,mushypeanuts,3,Sun Jul 12 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"St. Ledger can also play LB, but he might be hurt too..."
OCLions,3cz0fd,OCinNYC,6,Sun Jul 12 12:20:09 2015 UTC,"Before I go take my sad nap, here are my thoughts:  Not since Toronto have the boys played this poorly.  Dallas was all over Orlando; they out-passioned them, played like they were eleven best friends.  Orlando just could not get the ball out of midfield from the way Dallas applied pressure from the first minute.  Also, Rivas went back to Old Rivas by being offside or kicking the ball everywhere around the net like it had a force field of space (I'm not going to even get into his missed PK).  Boden is now out.  St. Ledger will probably be out.  Brek is not going to be fit by the time Orlando plays the New Jersey Energy Drinks, and Orlando can't clone to Collin.  I am worried.  Also, I say all this because I'm slightly irrational and drunk on Mountain Dew.  Anyways, that's it...time for my sad nap.  Go rate would ya?  EDIT: WAIT!  As I put my head down on the pillow as tears were streaming down my eyes, I also wanted to make a point that this is what happens with missing Kaka.  Because of who he is, midfielders always have to keep him in check, which usually leads for someone else to be open.  Not having that fail safe let Dallas run wild all over the field.  Alright, I'm done.  Back to the sad nap. Sniff"
OCLions,3cz0fd,misanthropicbuddha,5,Sun Jul 12 02:42:44 2015 UTC,"I am sure Kaka was cringing as hard as we were. We get pissed about it now, regret it tomorrow and move on. We stay strong and together, we are Orlando City."

OCLions,3cz0fd,5heepdawg,4,Thu Jul 16 00:42:41 2015 UTC,I was at the game and the goal that was taken from us off Ribiero didn't look off sides to me. Can anyone verify that was off sides that was watching the stream?
OCLions,3cz0fd,Owtlaw1,8,Sun Jul 12 02:08:05 2015 UTC,He was onside when it was passed to him and even when it got to him. He was never offside at all.
OCLions,3cz0fd,checkonechecktwo,5,Sun Jul 12 02:11:34 2015 UTC,He looks offside here
OCLions,3cz0fd,moxthebox,3,Sun Jul 12 02:59:36 2015 UTC,"oh fuck he really is  Edit: the replay they showed on TV was criminally misleading, cutting it off until he was played back onside about here"
OCLions,3cz0fd,zrowny,2,Sun Jul 12 03:30:37 2015 UTC,Freeze framing when the ball is two thirds of the way there should have been a dead giveaway
OCLions,3cz0fd,moxthebox,7,Sun Jul 12 15:37:59 2015 UTC,"It wasn't offsides, that or the lines in the turf are not straight. If that goal counted, would have changed the whole momentum of the match."
OCLions,3cz0fd,TheBrokenTurret,3,Sun Jul 12 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"Poor night , happens we move on to the next one"
OCLions,3cz0fd,LarryisLegend,3,Sun Jul 12 01:53:18 2015 UTC,The entire second half it felt like we were playing with 30 seconds left in the game or like we were winning 8-0
OCLions,3czd9w,updog4sale,6,Sun Jul 12 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"Heath said that he hopes to have Larin back next week, and I think that's pretty realistic. Canada is close to be eliminated, and he only played the first half today. He might not play at all in their game on Tuesday. If so, he should be able to play on Saturday.   Having Kaka and Larin back is more important than any other players on the team. We can field a decent enough defense with Collin back, but tonight (and in the second half of the RSL game) we had no one who can reliably score. I think we have a pretty decent shot against NY next Saturday at home."
OCLions,3czd9w,hawaii5bro,3,Sun Jul 12 05:06:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw what happened to RSL. I guess we could be in a deeper hole.
OCLions,3czahk,arabidpolarbear,5,Sun Jul 12 03:32:59 2015 UTC,"They should play all replays. Regardless if it's a ""debatable"" call."
OCLions,3czahk,ghornett,5,Sun Jul 12 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, I shouldn't have a better viewing event at home. It is already frustrating not to know where we are with stoppage time. Not seeing the replay was beyond frustrating last night."
OCLions,3czahk,NCarolinaSoccer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:44:10 2015 UTC,I stopped watching the replays on screen halfway through the night because I figured it would cut out halfway through and frustrate me more
OCLions,3czahk,TheBrokenTurret,8,Sun Jul 12 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"To prevent a riot against the ref. After the England incident at the World Cup where the ball crossed the goal post but the goal was denied, they played that replay on the jumbo screen and people were furious. This is used to keep the people in the stadium thinking that the refs are smart."
OCLions,3czahk,misanthropicbuddha,5,Sun Jul 12 03:36:47 2015 UTC,But they had been playing replays.  They just stopped for no reason.
OCLions,3czahk,SoulOfDragnsFire,5,Sun Jul 12 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"They will show less controversial replays to the crowd, but whenever there is one that incenses the crowd in any way, then they don't play it.  From what I know, this is a common practice at other grounds as well."
OCLions,3czahk,misanthropicbuddha,4,Sun Jul 12 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous, I have been to just About every other type of sporting event and have never had that. If they want everyone to have respect then they need to treat us as adults. This isn't a country known for rioting at sporting events. Maybe after a playoff win, but never during."
OCLions,3czahk,TheBrokenTurret,3,Sun Jul 12 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"Every other sporting event has some sort of ability to overrule a call... If it's a coaches challenge, a booth review, or going offsite for other refs (hockey goes to Toronto for questionable goals), so in the end rarely will blatantly wrong calls stand.    Soccer has the ""human factor that we love so very very much"" according to FIFA, so if a call is blown, there is no way to reverse it.  Might as well let us just question the ref instead of knowing he belongs on OBT."
OCLions,3czahk,updog4sale,2,Sun Jul 12 15:59:25 2015 UTC,I agree that showing a replay will probably not incite anyone as replays are shown in football and basketball all the time that incense home crowds.  I think this is just a rule adopted from Europe is all.
OCLions,3czahk,-kemosabe,3,Sun Jul 12 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"It was a debatable call, only calls that are definite where the ref can say they were ""100% right"" are displayed"
OCLions,3czahk,synmo,2,Sun Jul 12 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. He's right. The ref made a lot of questionable calls tonight. For us and them. And then if you take a 30k strong attendance and give them a reason to chant ""the ref belongs on OBT""... It would just get worse and worse. Best to not shoe the replays.   Especially Pedro's goal."
OCLions,3czahk,SoulOfDragnsFire,2,Sun Jul 12 04:05:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the stadium shows the live television feed and the TV broadcasters will replay everything. However if the replay shows us in a bad light the stadium will cut away from the feed because we don't want to help the ref penalize our team. I believe it's just part of home field advantage as I've seen them stay with pro OCSC replays in the past    Basically if the ref is wrong we want him to know it, and if he's right, we want 30k people to tell him he's wrong and hopefully give him some doubt"
OCLions,3czahk,synmo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:00:15 2015 UTC,The crew for the big screen was pretty sloppy all night. How am I ever going to know how Boden finished up in the RC car challenge!?
OCLions,3czahk,synmo,2,Sun Jul 12 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"OMG yes!  They were leading up to saying he was the first to have a single digit score, even WITH his second penalty!  ugh..."
OCLions,3d1836,Ronaldmethot,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"The Lions offense finally had a through ball threat and the ability to get behind a defense. The opposition was forced to shift extra help to deal with the pacey Rivas and this opened up more space for the other midfielders and strikers.   Rivas' job didn't change because of his positioning. He was supposed to stretch the back line and play in tandem with Ribeiro. That connection could have payed off had Pedro been onside. We were playing defensively, every single one of our attacking players was a backup, Heath knew we weren't going to be creating much. Ribeiro is better in the AM role than Neal is and we were trying to play tight. We weren't looking to take the game to them, just survive and get the ball to Rivas on long balls. Higuita gave up a pen at the death of the first half and we had to change shape. I don't think the formation was the reason we lost, just the personnel. And Heath didn't really have a choice in that"
OCLions,3d1836,logjam13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"Higuita's foul that caused the PK at the end of the half hurt, but the biggest factor in that game was the overall game plan we had during the first half.  Basically no one was allowed to cross the midline except Rivas and Ribeiro.  Ramos and Boden both would get the line and deep cross to Rivas.  Dallas saw this in the first 5 mins and started a high press, because they knew they didn't have to worry about an attack.  They kept 2 or 3 on Rivas and everyone else was attack.  Regardless of the formation, this is why the first half was so bad.    Second half was better, especially right after the whistle, because we were more aggressive and played our normal style.  The change of formation helped a little, but just the change in tactics made the bigger difference.  Rivas is better on the wing, instead of at Forward.  Because he plays on the wing, he normally doesn't have to worry about being on or offsides, which is one of this struggles when he plays forward.  The second half formation is what they should have started with, but if they tried to play the same tactics, would have been the same results."
OCLions,3cz4ws,misanthropicbuddha,7,Sun Jul 12 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"Every time we have a crap game I think Hall should be winning MotM because I've yet to see him ever do poorly. 2 goals scored against him of course, but one was a penalty and the other was because we suck ass at marking at the top of the box. A save by Hall against that would've been insane"
OCLions,3cz4ws,zrowny,3,Sun Jul 12 02:38:59 2015 UTC,"He even got a hand on the PK! (I think, the stream I watched was pretty shit in quality) Tally has been superb for us so far this year. I dont think there has yet to be a game where his performance could be linked to a poor result."
OCLions,3cz4ws,TandBinc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  A PK is a PK.  I don't blame the keeper if he misses that, and I agree that the second goal was due to shit defending.  I thought Collin looked pretty good as well for being out a month.  Also, this match was the first shit performance from the team since Tally has been in net, if that means something."

OCLions,3cyh7y,tauzins,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"The difference there is that you can learn and practice consistency, but you can't learn and practice that innate game changing talent. Rivas is very young too."

I don't know how many people are brand new soccer fans that jumped on the bandwagon or are just completely biased and making an excuse possible, but please understand how shit we played tonight. Little to no pressing, barely any connection in midfield whatsoever. Our players are widely inexperienced, many completely on this level, and haven't quite developed that natural click that you see from senior players. Without Kaka and Brek, we lack any authority. That foul from Higuita was an easy penalty, there is no excuse for him to be doing that at all save for just having not been in the situation enough to understand how to act in it.   We've shown enormous improvement, and honestly the team has surpassed my expectations immensely. We're currently without Brek, Molino, and Kaka, and those are the three stars of our team so the fact that we're functioning is a bit surprising. Don't get me wrong, the ref belongs on OBT, but we aren't blameless on this."

OCLions,3cx2px,updog4sale,2,Sat Jul 11 15:31:05 2015 UTC,They still sell parking passes online (for $27.50 after all the fees). The go on sale about 2 weeks before the game and generally sell out 3 or 4 days before the game
OCLions,3cx2px,-kemosabe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I appreciate it."
OCLions,3cvsi3,McMarston,7,Sat Jul 11 04:46:41 2015 UTC,We need a finisher. Chitarito is a great player. My big question is what about parity? Do we have to give anyone up?  And the rumor $10 mil includes a transfer fee possibly paid by the league.
OCLions,3cvsi3,qoou,5,Sat Jul 11 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Rivas would most likely be moved into Core DP status, and that opens it up for Hernandez."
OCLions,3cvsi3,mikesicle,3,Sat Jul 11 16:33:44 2015 UTC,Thanks. I guess I'm still fuzzy on the DP rules.
OCLions,3cvsi3,qoou,7,Sat Jul 11 16:44:35 2015 UTC,You're not alone.
OCLions,3cvsi3,mikesicle,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"I'd expect Rochez to be bumped down to Core DP first before Rivas, if not both."
OCLions,3cvsi3,babacristo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:24:01 2015 UTC,Rochez is on a young DP contact with counts even less against the cap already.  Rivas would likely be the one to pay down with the new allocation money.
OCLions,3cvsi3,j_andrew_h,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh, so we'd free up more money if we paid down Rivas? Didn't put that part together."
OCLions,3cvsi3,babacristo,2,Sat Jul 11 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well a little bit, but more importantly if the club used the new allocation $$ to pay down Rivas's contact then he wouldn't count as a DP, so we'd have a new DP spot available. He would get paid the same amount so no negative impact on him.  To sign a big DP, we only need the cap room for the first $375K and a DP slot available... Whatever Flavio wants to pay above the $375K is up to him and doesn't impact $$ available to pay other players."
OCLions,3cvsi3,j_andrew_h,7,Sat Jul 11 20:58:51 2015 UTC,Maybe MLS said they'd pay the transfer fee? Giving Chicharito $30m over 3 years is a good value for investment when we're giving Kaká $21m over the same period. And if Kaká signed an extension I would imagine that he would get a raise down the line
OCLions,3cvsi3,logjam13,7,Sat Jul 11 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd LOVE to see him play for us, that seems like too much money. I'm honestly not sure if this rumor makes me happy or sad."
OCLions,3cvsi3,wonder_chicken,20,Sat Jul 11 05:32:34 2015 UTC,"It makes me happy. We NEED someone who can score goals, and he has proven he can better than any current MLS player. Kaka and Larin carry the team in terms of scoring, and I feel like the three of them could be such a deadly combination.   It would be so huge for the team, league, and sport in this country to get a player of his quality in his prime."
OCLions,3cvsi3,hawaii5bro,3,Sat Jul 11 06:24:48 2015 UTC,"oh god, if we got Kaka feeding Cheech I'd almost be happy with no other transfers for the summer."
OCLions,3cvsi3,babacristo,2,Sat Jul 11 18:37:27 2015 UTC,I kinda feel like you'd get more out of Ribeiro + Hernandez up front.   Either way I say sign him.
OCLions,3cvsi3,secretlyadog,3,Sat Jul 11 21:10:58 2015 UTC,I feel like if we have that kind of money we should be investing in 2-3 players instead of one player whose been a super sub for a year
OCLions,3cvsi3,acidtwiggy,14,Sat Jul 11 07:14:58 2015 UTC,Problem is we can't with DP rules nor can we get one with the same name value.
OCLions,3cvsi3,pvdfan,2,Sat Jul 11 08:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah this actually makes the most sense In terms of salary cap, DP's and implementing the new CP"
OCLions,3cvsi3,updog4sale,2,Sat Jul 11 15:29:10 2015 UTC,instead of one player whose been a super sub for a year   a super sub for Man U... which would be a starter for us. Don't forget Kaka was a super sub in Europe for a few years before he came over.
OCLions,3cvsi3,babacristo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"That's the thing about DP money, one DP player only counts something like $375K against the cap no matter how much you choose to pay them.  So it's not like we even can get 3 players at $3M each...  So we might as well go for UT and bring in a huge player like this if we can (that's a huge ""if"" obviously)."

He'd fit in as a RW, which is one position we're hurting for at the moment. He's got a Brazilian (and AC Milan) partnership with Kaka, so I'd love to see them work together. He's quick, has a ton of skill, and is a decent finisher. And at only 25, he's still in his prime and will be for a few more years. I haven't really kept up with him, but I know he's been playing in Brazil for the past few years and, as far as I know, staying healty (for him at least)."

OCLions,3crhna,pvdfan,6,Fri Jul 10 06:31:00 2015 UTC,I think a win against Dallas on Saturday will provide enough motivation to propel our team through the rest of the month. This game specifically is a real opportunity to show what kind of team we are even without our star player.
OCLions,3crhna,shulmand,3,Fri Jul 10 05:34:17 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. In a way I think Kaka being out for a game COULD be the best thing for us.  Even better if we play our normal 4-2-3-1 without Kaka, and beat Dallas, we can prove that we're a great team and its not just about Kaka.    Of course it'd be better if we weren't as short changed everywhere else as we are."
OCLions,3crhna,spikebaylor,2,Fri Jul 10 10:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about NYCFC or any 1 team specifically. We just need some guys getting healthy & an injection of talent as soon as possible to get through this window. It will be tough even if we were playing the worst teams every week.     As for NYCFC,  who know how that will ultimately turn out  but historically mid season DPs from Europe haven't done well at first. We'll see what happens."
OCLions,3crhna,j_andrew_h,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:22:50 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how much longer Brek will be out? They shut him down over 2 weeks ago and said probably 3-4 so it might not be too much longer.
OCLions,3cqi9i,pvdfan,7,Thu Jul 9 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"So we have 1 available true forward in Danny Mwanga, who has not scored in MLS play since 2012, and Rivas, who has not scored outside of the Open Cup. Or we could recall our rookie who has been all right at best for Louisville. That would also fill up our active roster and prevent any new signings until he's re-loaned, which depending on Ribeiro's injury could be a bit  We had 5 strikers for a 1 forward system in March and it's come to this"
OCLions,3cqi9i,logjam13,6,Fri Jul 10 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"Rivera needs to come back for Saturday and sent right back down on Sunday or after the friendly if no one is signed before then.  Then again, I'm all for Ian Fuller getting a one week contract to stop the bleeding."

OCLions,3cr205,Widan,3,Fri Jul 10 03:40:39 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree, but I don't see anyone trading for him given his injuries.

OCLions,3cpu4k,pvdfan,3,Thu Jul 9 20:42:55 2015 UTC,"F@#King A! So at this point do we just play for the draw? I mean Dallas FC is a pretty strong team and with our current depth I only see us being able to play 2 options really, both of which are a 4-3-3: Usual back 4(is Colin still out btw? I should probably just assume he is at this point) with Neal, Okugo, and Higuita in the middle and then Rivas Mwanga and Avila making up the top, but that is assuming that Rochez is at least fit enough(and Adrian trusts him enough) to at least be a sub at 60. If not than we literally don't have another striker on the roster and Rivas has to play up top with neal and avi making up the wings and Heath gets the start in the middle. I don't like our chances to get a dominant win with either one of those, but honestly, the defensiveness and possession abilities of those two options aren't that bad either and with Rivas' speed who knows if we get lucky and get a late goal for some home magic! Either way, I think Adrian has to start Okugo at this point and despite how poor his form was I am a fan and am happy that he is going to get a decent shot to re-integrate himself in the lineup"

Maybe that rules out Brazil, Mexico some Central/South American countries then?   We’ve talked to teams, but nothing that’s really intriguing for us.

OCLions,3co1la,andrewthemexican,12,Thu Jul 9 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"Weird. Here it is:   Orlando City Soccer Club spent an estimated $5.9 million on July 1 to buy the only privately owned parcel on W. Church Street that lies in the footprint of its future stadium, according to county deed records.    The 2.08-acre parcel, located at 655 W. Church St. on the corner with N. Parramore Avenue, was formerly owned by Northbrook Properties Inc., a local affiliate of real estate investor Bixby Bridge Capital out of Northbrook, Ill.  New Orlando City Soccer stadium bidding delayed New Orlando City Soccer stadium bidding delayed The stadium’s footprint will encompass 10.58 acres across 12 parcels that lie between W. Central Boulevard, W. Church Street, Glenn Lane to the west, and a point midway between N. Parramore Avenue and S. Terry Avenue to the east.  Eleven of those parcels are city-owned. Orlando City Soccer spokesman Lenny Santiago told GrowthSpotter Wednesday the club is working with city government on buying the remaining land of the stadium site. Those discussions could be finalized as soon as this month, he added.  A parcel that sits in the middle of it all, the 0.44-acre Faith Deliverance Temple at 625 W. Church St., won’t be bought by the soccer club and will border the stadium to its east, Santiago said.  Ten small parcels directly to the east of the church and to its north are city-owned land totaling 3.77 acres, which Orlando City may also acquire for parking or fan space. Santiago declined to discuss ongoing negotiations for city-owned property.  The estimated $5.9 million purchase price for the vacant two-acre parcel is based on deed taxes paid to Orange County. Santiago declined to confirm the price paid, or how the club is financing its land acquisition.  Orlando City Soccer plans to build a 290,000-square-foot stadium with 28,000 seats, at an estimated cost of $110 million. The club announced in June it would privately finance the stadium.  Construction bids for the project are set for Aug. 27, with an estimated start date of Sept. 28, GrowthSpotter reported in late June. Barton Malow Co. is the stadium’s construction manager."

OCLions,3cjl7v,mcg1848,5,Wed Jul 8 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"I wonder what we'll hear about first, players moving out (loans or releases) or a player coming in."
OCLions,3cjl7v,j_andrew_h,5,Wed Jul 8 13:07:36 2015 UTC,"You will get the signings first, then based on who signs, who will get loaned...  My guess is that Redding & Estrela are prob the first ones to get loaned.  Next group would be Ricketts, Mwanga and Heath...  Turner and Donovan are needed for depth in defense, unless they sign more than one defender... But I see LB a bigger depth need than CB or RB (a LB who can also play CB would be ideal).  Could see Cascio being released..."
OCLions,3cjl7v,daguru9,3,Wed Jul 8 14:25:37 2015 UTC,I can more or less agree with everything here.  I know they'd love to get Redding & Estrela playing somewhere; so a loan would be great for sure.    I also agree that a backup LB that can play CB would be ideal for the back line.  They don't really need anything else back there.
OCLions,3cjl7v,j_andrew_h,2,Wed Jul 8 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"Think Josh Ford is the first to go. Have a feeling his loan to Ft. Lauderdale was a ""try before you buy"" situation. If they don't want him, he's probably getting the axe"
OCLions,3cjl7v,logjam13,3,Wed Jul 8 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I though Ford's loan was already extended.   I have a feeling he sticks around and ends up as the GK for the USL franchise."
OCLions,3cjl7v,logjam13,2,Wed Jul 8 17:14:38 2015 UTC,I think we'll see Edwards as the USL keeper. Ford could be a solid 3rd keeper next season or backup if Ricketts leaves

I don't know enough about Amorim to have a strong opinion really; I just feel that we need a RM & Forward above all else.  I'm sure for depth we really need an additional CB and LB; but we need starting quality players at RM & FW.  I'm not saying to take Larin out; but we need another guy who can start there if needed and so far Rochez has been MIA.    I feel bad; but I unless Cascio is almost ready and the club still has faith in him; then I think he has to be released.  If so; let him get healthy and hopefully restart his career in the USL or NASL, but we can't afford a roster spot for a guy that hasn't played in that long and is still somewhat unproven even when healthy."

OCLions,3cgnsp,Whitegoldteeth,9,Tue Jul 7 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this leak to the media is a negotiating tactic. Maybe OCSC leaked this to the Sentinel to show CH14 how ridiculous his asking price is, especially when compared with the other big names that have recently been acquired. As a Mexican I'm bummed that we won't be seeing him in Orlando, especially after seeing how many Tri fans came out for the recent friendly. As an Orlando City fan, fuck this he's not worth 10m a year + the transfer fee."
OCLions,3cgnsp,meeerod,7,Tue Jul 7 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, it may be Chicha's way of saying no to MLS. He'd come, but only for a fee he knows no one would pay"

I understand that his presence and draw in CONCACAF is important, but I can't see us shelling out more than $8m when these legends for their respective countries are taking less"
OCLions,3cgnsp,logjam13,3,Tue Jul 7 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"I think that the club would do it for the $10 if they could get the transfer fee knocked off or picked by by MLS... with the both combined though, it's just too much for almost any player based on where MLS is today."
OCLions,3cgnsp,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Jul 7 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"Like Tenorio said in the article, with the transfer fee, his contract would be nearly double Kaka's... I think it is the transfer fee that is going to kill the deal..."

I own the authentic versions of both the home and away jerseys (short-sleeved and long-sleeved respectively).  They are definitely a little tight around the stomach (I'm a bigger guy), but not restricting in anyway.  I feel like they are very durable and even though they are a little expensive, they are worth the money.  However, the replica shirt is just as high quality and are about $20 less.  Hope this helps a little."

OCLions,3cak4f,daguru9,2,Mon Jul 6 11:55:08 2015 UTC,"300k-500k salary? That's a lot of money for a player who seems to be a rich man's Eric Avila. If he plays RM, who sits when Molino comes back? Would he be our Core Player, thereby extinguishing Chicharito rumors? And would we let our CP ride the pine?"
OCLions,3cak4f,logjam13,3,Mon Jul 6 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"I think he would be more than just a ""rich man's Eric Avila"".  This guys has lot more experience, in Europe and International Duty.  While he could play RM, he can basically play any other position in the midfield.  So he would probably start at RM this year and could be a very good, quality sub at ACM, DCM, and RM next season.  And he could help with Molino's development next season.  With a salary range of 300k-500k, he would be right at the roster/contract limit.  If I remember correctly, the line is around $425k... so if they can sign him for less than that, they are good and he would not need to be a DP or CP.  If he signs for more or has a big transfer fee, then they could buy it below the DP threshold.  This will still allow the team the flexibility to loan/sell an existing DP or re-classify one as a CP to sign higher salary players (like Chicharito).  Since it is Benfica and we have a partnership in place, I could see him coming for a lower transfer fee or maybe even a loan.  Loan might be a better deal for OCSC, then the club wouldn't be on the hook for next season."
OCLions,3cak4f,logjam13,2,Mon Jul 6 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"He's solid in defense and all right in attack. He can play RAM, DM, and RB just like Avila but on twice the salary. I think Eric has been a solid backup. The only way I see this as a solid decision is if Santos Laguna wants a high fee for Avila because Ruben is free. Even then it's a big hit to the cap for a role player"
OCLions,3cak4f,ljergens,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Article says he would come as a free....so no transfer fee to worry about. He is coming off a bad injury, but if healthy would be a HUGE upgrade at RAM.  I keep hearing chicharito won't happen. A signing like this would make more sense as chicharito would break the bank."

OCLions,3c9h8y,mcg1848,3,Mon Jul 6 13:26:02 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but does anyone else think a friendly (west brom) at this point in the season does more harm than good? I understand its great publicity for the team and the league, but its taxing enough trying to compete in the open cup and more importantly put together a strong second half of the season. For a team as banged up as ours, I just hope we see a very different starting 11 for this game."
OCLions,3c9h8y,blou10,2,Tue Jul 7 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"Logically, a friendly is almost never a good idea.  As the last friendly the Lions had resulted in losing Kevin for the season.  However, the friendly should be entertaining in terms of we get to see a team that we would normally never get to see, we get to see the big names play for a bit, and Orlando can use this as a scrimmage for the younger players as well.  As long as Inchy doesn't go full strength for the entire 90, then I think this friendly will serve its purpose."

I know we're performing well but we're still a young expansion team. 70% of our team had never played together in February and here we are in July in solid playoff contention.  The reason we haven't been making subs is our ridiculous injury list and the resulting youth of our bench. It's frustrating when Avila isn't producing or when Neal looks exhausted but who on our bench can come in and provide a better spark? Most of our current bench is DMs, CBs, and GKs. Kind of sucks that our injuries have mainly affected the wings. Transfers will have a big impact on how we do for the rest of the season, more so than Adrian"
OCLions,3c86ag,logjam13,11,Sun Jul 5 21:06:02 2015 UTC,There's a reason those fans aren't working in professional sports.  Inchy has been great.  This is basically an entirely new team that he's stitched together and things are really starting to click.
OCLions,3c86ag,beerinthedark,4,Sun Jul 5 20:57:57 2015 UTC,I think he has done a very good job. I think last night they said we have 15 different nationalities on the team. Only carried over like 7 players from the previous year. I think people underestimate how hard it is too bring together a expansion team. Sometimes a turnover of 5 players alone can ruin a teams chemistry. We are in a good position at this point to make the playoffs and I think that's what everyone wants in the end.   The only negative I have is his substitutions but in the grand scheme of things it's minuscule complaint. Sometimes players are obviously gassed in the 80th minute and he just rides it out.   But in all I love the guy and we are lucky as hell to have him leading our team.

OCLions,3c86ag,Wheaties466,2,Mon Jul 6 05:30:41 2015 UTC,"Id agree on how he has treated injury/late subs/etc.  Its really been my only conplaint about Heath.    I do t always understand his decisions sometimes but im not a coach and im rarely looking ahead.  For a lot of the weird decisions on who to play and at what position, the results end up showing themselves weeks later.  I love that we're trying so hard for Open Cup.  A playoff spot is far from a lock just yet but i think we have a good chance if we continue to play well.  We dont even need to place high, just enough to make it in.  So putting some effort into winning the USOC is a gamble i think we can take for high reward if we win.  Not to mention the boost in confidence that would bring.  Even if we beat Chicago and go on to the semis to lose, id be happy.  Thats a decent accomplishment for such a new team and gives them more games together."

Heath knew Shea was tweaked but trusted his judgment. As far as playing full strength against Ponte Preta, I was under the impression that he was trying build the team chemistry since it was so early early in the season, and had Molino not gone down with an ACL injury it wouldn't have been a subject to talk about at all. But I love my coach and I love my team. It sucks that we are down so many players at our halfway mark in the season. I'm excited to see the team healthy come playoffs!"

OCLions,3c5wbr,m_shet21,16,Sun Jul 5 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"If you watch the replay, Kaka appears to ""step"" on him somewhat. I highly doubt it was intentional and there wasn't any malicious intent on it, but they said this ref has given out 18 red cards in the past 36 games. Crazy."
OCLions,3c5wbr,EASports_MUT,13,Sun Jul 5 03:11:35 2015 UTC,"The argument probably stems from one of two things here:   Did Kaka have enough time to avoid the ""stomp""? Did Kaka piss off the ref for not coming back to the ref when he whistled him back over to receive the yellow and Kaka didn't come back over?   Personally I feel like the second is more likely which would have been a yellow for the tackle (agreed; obvious yellow tackle) and a yellow for dissent for not yielding to the ref."
OCLions,3c5wbr,gatorBlahz,4,Sun Jul 5 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely think this is what happens. The ref has the yellow out but kaka doesn't immediately go up to him.

This is his 3rd Red(first str8) in MLS if I am not mistaken.  He lost his cool, but he wasn't malicious on any level.  If anything he pushed him and AVOIDED stepping on him intentionally(in other news, Clint Dempsey scored a PK...lol).  GL;HF MLS officiating."

OCLions,3c5wbr,gabot045,4,Sun Jul 5 06:24:11 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion warning: The only replay where it looks like Kaka is going for ball is the one where you can see his eyes. The ref saw it from the side/back, and it totally looked like Kaka was trying to wreck Morales from that vantage. The whole thing seemed extremely reminiscent of Ramos' Red against Columbus. Reckless abandon in the heat of the moment + completely ignoring the referee = early red card. I don't think any of this ""stomping"" nonsense even factored into the decision. Shitty time to lose Kaka for a game, but shit happens."
OCLions,3c5wbr,j_andrew_h,4,Sun Jul 5 05:14:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Especially when you consider how Kaka had been struggling to get the ball just before and then he had paused...but then he rushed in.

OCLions,3c61dl,logjam13,3,Sun Jul 5 04:11:44 2015 UTC,Beat his man. The defender blatantly grabs his shoulder and pulled him down. Rivas didn't flop or embellish at all.

OCLions,3c61dl,nautika,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really thought he gave him the red for walking away and ignoring him for so long at first.  Someone suggested the ref probably saw the replay on the screen and decided to give a red instead.  I'm not sure that's the case though since they don't ever show replay of fouls at the Citrus Bowl, so I doubt they show it there.  Also, I'm not sure about the appealing the 1 game suspension from a red that people have mentioned.  I always thought the appeals were if there were additional suspensions.  I'm not 100% on MLS rules and feel people are misinterpreting the appeals that you hear about."
OCLions,3c61dl,zrowny,2,Sun Jul 5 04:31:26 2015 UTC,"Here are the rules regarding appeals: http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/appeal-review-red-card-decision  You can appeal a red card regardless of any additional suspension. I think the last two lines there make it clear why this wouldn't be overturned:   Remember the Ruling Body is not re-refereeing the game; it is rectifying obvious errors in the referee’s disciplinary decisions.  Therefore if it is not OBVIOUS it does not need to be rectified.   The only way this could get overturned is if the red is specifically for ""stomping"" after the initial foul. Again, it's not clear if there was a yellow card first before the red, or if the ref just waited like 20 seconds to give any card at all (talking to the assistant ref maybe?)"
OCLions,3c61dl,Disorted,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:45:38 2015 UTC,"On the radio they guessed the Red was for dissent.

OCLions,3c61dl,zrowny,6,Sun Jul 5 04:45:20 2015 UTC,"According to the ref himself, the red was for violent conduct. And he outright fucking lies for no reason saying that his decision to increase the card to a red wasn't influenced by the assistant ref"

The second is a basic deal, walking in front of the free kick...it's a foul but not usually enforced like that unless it's persistent or the ref needs to get control of the game (I'm only looking at those 13 seconds but it looks like the other player kicked it into him on purpose or was trying to rile things up). It happens all the time...honestly, of these 3 the red from today seems most deserved.  I think I could've seen a yellow for what Kaka did, but I also could see it not having been called."

OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"I find it more interesting that Collin is not on the bench.  I'm inferring that they want to make sure he is 100% healed for his return, which is good given Orlando's backline has looked solid without him."
OCLions,3c5p9q,gatorBlahz,3,Sun Jul 5 02:20:58 2015 UTC,Same injury as last time i think? So probably playing it safe.
OCLions,3c5p9q,nautika,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe it was the same hamstring, and I know hamstring injuries are very fickle and very prone to return.  The longer he sits in order to heal the better."

OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 02:40:14 2015 UTC,Higuita and Boden are getting beat badly so far.
OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 02:38:54 2015 UTC,I think the half couldn't come at a better time.  Orlando needs to calm down as their composure is starting to falter.  I'm confident Inchy can get them back on track.
OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 02:45:30 2015 UTC,That red was complete bullshit.
OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 02:47:03 2015 UTC,"Isn't retaliation an automatic red card?  From behind it looked like retaliation from Kaka, but the replay from the front doesn't look so bad."
OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 02:46:38 2015 UTC,I believe so.  I think the accidental step was what caused the red.  Though that was a bullshit and Kaka just stumbled.
OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 02:59:25 2015 UTC,It's too bad he couldn't keep his cool :(. Let's hope OC can hold up.
OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sun Jul 5 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Kaka definitely lost his cool, but I don't want to believe that Kaka intentionally stepped on that guy.  I do absolutely think he wanted none of that ref though."
OCLions,3c5p9q,misanthropicbuddha,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:14:30 2015 UTC,I don't really see what kaka could have possibly be retaliating against. Maybe because the guy stepped into him to draw the foul?

OCLions,3c2mmx,McMarston,12,Sat Jul 4 04:36:42 2015 UTC,Id prefer not. Our team chemistry seems pretty great. While he would easily be a top 10 maybe even top 5 talent in the league once the honeymoon was over it could easily destroy our team. Look at his track record elsewhere. Complaining about having to defend showing up late to training or not even going at all. Just not the type of player we want.
OCLions,3c2mmx,jmoney0999,5,Sat Jul 4 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"Even if there was interest from both sides, I feel like Heath wouldn't allow the signing based off his personality alone.  From what I understand, he hasn't been playing Rochez because of his locker room antics (though, my source on that is just other reddit posts, so who knows the validity there)."
OCLions,3c2mmx,SoulOfDragnsFire,4,Sat Jul 4 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"Not to mention not signing ""the fridge"" during pre season for mucb the same reasons.  Our team is finally starting to gel and i genuinly like everyone on the team even if their playing is questionable at times.  They all seem like good guys.  Id rather have a decent guy who fits in well than a a superstar who brings everyone down.  When i was hired for the company i work for there were 4 people in my final interview.  Maybe a quarter of the interview was about my field.  The rest was them just seeing the type of person i was.  Telling stories, laughing, discussing relevant topics etc.  To them it was more important to hire someone that fit in and had the right atittude than asking more questions to determine my knowledge (which had been determined on a phone interview already).  With the types of evironments we sometimes have to worm, comraderie and being able to roll with the ups and downs, work as a team, etc, is vital.  I imagine a sports team is similar.  Every game can be very stressful.  You have to do your very best while also relying on your teammates to do their best, cover you when need be, letting it go when things dont go right."
OCLions,3c2mmx,spikebaylor,4,Sat Jul 4 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"I love the Boateng Brothers, but KPB wouldn't work. His work ethic is questionable, temper is hot, and loyalty questionable. Sure Kaka could have a positive influence on him. But there's a lot of work to be done in regard to his behavior and attitude. Orlando is trying to set a standard, and KPB wouldn't uphold it at this point in time."
OCLions,3c2mmx,dssx,3,Sat Jul 4 13:40:17 2015 UTC,I've never heard a raving review of him. Seems like he'd bring petty squabbles and a mercenary attitude into the team.

Also, Ruckus seem to be more spread out - Treasure Coast, Seminole County, UCF area, etc.  Both have a pretty good downtown presence.    Agreed that ILF is more South American-style...Ruckus is a pretty good mix of South / Latin American, UK, and Americans.  Personal preference really."
OCLions,3c1dsd,mcg1848,3,Sat Jul 4 01:37:29 2015 UTC,"Go to your first game in the supporters section and decide for yourself, you'll see the differences. ILF are more south American style. Hit up the tailgate in Lot 11, everyone is pretty welcoming. Also bring beer, that helps."
OCLions,3c1dsd,mikesicle,3,Sat Jul 4 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"3 time season ticket holder in the supporter section for ILF. Honestly, I hate it. They both have their flaws. ILF gets hammered drunk and Ruckus doesn't curse. Take your pick but I would suggest staying wherever you sit now."

They also have started chants against OC in games that we were losing."
OCLions,3c1dsd,NinnyBoggy,4,Sat Jul 4 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"They also have started chants against OC in games that we were losing.   Yeah, no we don't. We have the ""full price papa johns"" chant which is a spin on our ""half price papa johns"" which is just playful ribbing"

OCLions,3c1dsd,ragewu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:18:45 2015 UTC,I'm ILF and despite what you might hear on r/mls we're very welcoming. Our only want is that you stand and chant with us for the entire 90 minutes. We have a lot of great people in here who are always down to help put and give advice. Just be courteous to others in the group and learn the chants. I really can't stress learning the chants enough.
OCLions,3c1dsd,longboardingerrday,3,Sat Jul 4 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"So I am going to piggy back here... I have opted out of joining a supporters group because I do not find your statement to be accurate.  I chant and sing as loud as I can as often as I can... And yet I still get yelled at for taking a small break. I have seen new comers yelled at and insulted because they were new and did not yet know all of the chants. I have witnessed chants that were directly against the rest of the stadium. I have seen people yelled at for chanting while a ocsc player is on the ground hurt... Yet the very next time this occurred it was ilf doing the chanting.   All in all, it is not a friendly experience unless you are known by the ""top"" people. I don't support a group who doesn't support every fan at the game and therefore I cannot throw my support to ilf.   OP, if you are reading this, go to a game yourself. You'll quickly see why ilf has a bad rep."
OCLions,3c1dsd,puto_ergo_ego_sum,0,Sun Jul 5 22:07:26 2015 UTC,Go to at least a few games in the supporters section right in the middle and look around and see who you like more.
OCLions,3c1dsd,MrBilld0zer,-2,Sat Jul 4 00:37:04 2015 UTC,"The ILF has a wide range of Age, Income, nationality, but we have one thing in common: our passion for Orlando City. The ILF is the place to be heard, not seen. If you wanna stand, jump, chant, yell  at the refs for 90 minutes,  then the ILF is for you.   If you're just going to stand and take Selfies or snapchat the whole match, then supporters culture may not be for you.  Come by Lot 11 next Saturday. Hope to see you there!"

OCLions,3bw321,daguru9,6,Thu Jul 2 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"The first half of the Major League Soccer season has brought plenty of excitement.  There hasn't been a game this season anyone has been able to predict with any reliability, making nearly every game a must-watch. And some of the league's marquee players are living up to the hype.  Orlando City's Kaká has scored in six of his past eight games and is beginning to look more like the player everyone thought he could be in this league. Not coincidentally, the Lions are 6-1-2 during that span.  New York City FC's David Villa has four goals and an assist in his last five league games, with NYCFC rebounding from an awful start to go 3-1-1 in that span.  Toronto FC's Sebastian Giovinco is the league's halfway MVP. The Italian is third in the league in both goals (8) and assists (7) and appears to be the catalyst that will finally get Toronto to the playoffs.  None of those players lead the league in any category — Columbus' Kei Kamara leads in goals (12), while his teammates Ethan Finlay leads in assists (10). And the likes of Octavio Rivero, Clint Dempsey, Chris Wondolowski and Fabian Castillo are all providing plenty of fireworks.  Sporting KC's Benny Feilhaber is a close second in the MVP race, with nine assists to go along with five goals for a Sporting team that sits third in the league in points per game.  But here's where things get crazy. The second half of the season could be a completely different look for MLS.  Three of the world's biggest stars are jumping into the fray this month. Former Chelsea and Juventus greats Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo are joining NYCFC, while Liverpool icon Steven Gerrard will play for L.A. Galaxy. All three are game-changing, league-altering players who have competed on the world's biggest stages and won some of the most important trophies in soccer.  All three sell jerseys. All three fill stadiums. All three should immediately prove to be among the best players in MLS.  MLS is a growing league, so much so that even in the midst of a season the league can up its star status significantly and reinforce its aspirations to become one of the top leagues in the world. If the first half of the season was about how far the league has come in 20 years, the second half is about where it wants to go in the next decade.  It's going to take time — signing players like Lampard (37) and Pirlo (36), have short-term, not necessarily long-term impact — but this is more about the league's owners showing a commitment to spend on a grander scale.  Of course, that commitment can't have tunnel-vision, focusing solely on aging European stars.  The spending must include the infrastructure of MLS academies and USL affiliates, which will provide the future American stars. And it especially must include paying the bright, young American stars like Bill Hamid, Wil Trapp, Jose Villareal, Gyasi Zardes, Dillon Powers and Luis Gil.  Yes, an exciting second half to 2015 is just starting, but if MLS makes the right steps, it could be an even bigger second half to the decade.  MLS power rankings  While D.C. United has put some good distance between itself and every other team in the East, the West remains a wide-open race and everyone else in the East probably still feels it has a shot at the playoffs. That doesn't even include a potential change to MLS player acquisition rules that could lead to the signing of Mexican stars Giovani Dos Santos, who has been linked to the Galaxy, and Javier ""Chicharito"" Hernandez, who could wind up right here in Orlando."

OCLions,3bv9x8,Whudevs,2,Fri Jul 3 15:09:42 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind a short drive, ILF has watch parties in Daytona as far as I remember. I usually go to World of Beer in Port Orange as one of the bartenders there is a big fan. As for NSB, I'm not sure. Maybe Pub 44 like another poster said."
OCLions,3bv9x8,Disorted,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not trying to drive that far. I found a place called Peanuts, it's on Flagler Ave. I'm thinking I'll give that place a try."
OCLions,3bu0ge,J_Bone007,13,Thu Jul 2 03:34:43 2015 UTC,So Real Madrid will be our feeder club? I can live with that.
OCLions,3bu0ge,herbsgotmelagging,4,Thu Jul 2 12:57:26 2015 UTC,He was loaned out to Real Madrid for half a season. Although I will still take a player from Manchester United.
OCLions,3bu0ge,TheBrokenTurret,2,Thu Jul 2 16:57:32 2015 UTC,"im the opposite, Im a lifelong Liverpool fan so until he puts on a lions jersey nothing is forgiven....:)"
OCLions,3bu0ge,beansley,18,Thu Jul 2 18:39:27 2015 UTC,He just broke his collarbone. Not even on the team yet and he's already joined the rest of our squad on the injured bench.
OCLions,3bu0ge,Widan,11,Thu Jul 2 03:52:46 2015 UTC,Hey I don't care get him in and get him signed!!
OCLions,3bu0ge,Widan,5,Thu Jul 2 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"I'd really, really like to sign him, it's just a shame that he gets injured right before we even do so.   At least he can join Paterson on the injured striker list.   E: and our bigger list of injured players, and our even bigger list of players who've gone M.I.A."
OCLions,3bu0ge,clear_haze,2,Thu Jul 2 03:59:12 2015 UTC,We would not have had him until August due to the Gold Cup. Reports I read indicate that he is expected to be out from four to six weeks with a fractured clavicle. If we sign him I hope it's true.
OCLions,3bu0ge,pm2562,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:00:37 2015 UTC,Hey it will be really cool to see him put on some purple soon!
OCLions,3bu0ge,mikesicle,8,Thu Jul 2 04:06:24 2015 UTC,"Clickbait article.  Once a real website reports it, I will buy it."
OCLions,3bu0ge,j_andrew_h,10,Thu Jul 2 14:08:59 2015 UTC,Despite his injury tonight HUGE pickup for city in long run!
OCLions,3bu0ge,mikesicle,9,Thu Jul 2 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"Even with him out 3-4 weeks, that still gives him plenty of time to play."
OCLions,3bu0ge,MacAndSpam,2,Thu Jul 2 11:46:20 2015 UTC,3-4 weeks recovery would be a no brainer to still sign him.  If he's out until October.... It depends on how long his contract is for.  Enough years then sure; we'll have him next year and beyond.  I personally think you sign him any way you can; but it's a tougher call if he's out for months instead of weeks.
OCLions,3bu0ge,macaco_gordinho,6,Thu Jul 2 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"We get to sign an incredible player, AND piss off Mexico? Count me in!"
OCLions,3bu0ge,mikesicle,6,Thu Jul 2 11:45:33 2015 UTC,"Is this a trusted source? I just got done dealing with the short-lived Millsap rumor, I don't think I can take any more heartbreak."
OCLions,3bu0ge,macaco_gordinho,3,Thu Jul 2 10:46:30 2015 UTC,"The article says 60%.... How about we wait till it's 100%... Let's not pull a Pirlo if you know what I mean. NYCFC blew their load way too early on that (regardless if it did actually happen).   Also, Atletico Madrid has a bid on him as well."
OCLions,3bu0ge,mikesicle,3,Thu Jul 2 13:42:50 2015 UTC,Pirlo signed. So.... they were right.
OCLions,3bu0ge,David21538,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:51:31 2015 UTC,the end doesn't justify the means lol
OCLions,3bu0ge,randyc87,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"Well, except in this case since he actually signed. I understand where you are coming from, but nothing NYCFC did negatively impacted the signing right?   If he doesnt sign we look dumb (weve looked dumber), if he does, we have one of my favorite strikers of the last few years!"
OCLions,3bu0ge,QuietFlight86,3,Thu Jul 2 14:35:16 2015 UTC,If he does sign I expect there to be a boast in the attendance since more Mexicans will be coming to the games to watch him and based on the Mexico vs Costa Rica game that would be an awesome boast for the atmosphere at games
OCLions,3bu0ge,randyc87,2,Thu Jul 2 15:05:58 2015 UTC,Hopefully only the good kind of Mexican fans.
OCLions,3bu0ge,mikesicle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:39:53 2015 UTC,interesting comment... kind of shitty TBH...
OCLions,3bu0ge,randyc87,5,Thu Jul 2 17:13:14 2015 UTC,Why is that shitty? Do you know when the usmnt went to Azteca they threw bags of piss at players? Surely don't want those type of fans at our games. Again I'm not saying I don't want Mexican fans if that was the impression you were getting.
OCLions,3bu0ge,mikesicle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"I get what you are trying to say, I think the wording just comes off all wrong. I personally worry about the increase in puto chants and laser pointers, but you have to be careful when generalizing all of them.  Plus, there is a big difference between piss bombers at the Azteca and the normal Mexican supporter who would come to our games here. The people who stick around with our club will adapt to how we support, and I guarantee you any misbehavior on behalf of any fans regardless of nationality will not be tolerated."
OCLions,3bu0ge,manelandjeff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:18:10 2015 UTC,You're probably right it was worded poorly.
OCLions,3bu0ge,coachhawley,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:37:48 2015 UTC,"Want to know how I know? I said on the MLS sub that the people shining lasers at the LA game were Mexicans. I got railed, then I realized it sounded like I was saying Mexican as a slur. Its tricky. I just say El Tri fans now..."
OCLions,3bu0ge,Bolivia_USA,0,Thu Jul 2 21:42:20 2015 UTC,We don't need more green lasers.
OCLions,3bu0ge,shulmand,6,Sat Jul 4 20:37:30 2015 UTC,I just want to know where he'll fit in really. Larin has been stellar upfront. Kaka is obviously in the center. Rivas has been coming along so well the last 4-5 games. Does he play on the right?
OCLions,3bu0ge,Bolivia_USA,6,Thu Jul 2 03:44:27 2015 UTC,"Larin is a rookie though, he runs the risk of plateauing (sp?) and we want him to develop. Either we go 2 strikers or Chicharito up front"
OCLions,3bu0ge,shulmand,10,Thu Jul 2 03:49:51 2015 UTC,I think a two striker system would be very favorable for Kaka and in turn incredibly effective.
OCLions,3bu0ge,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:11:04 2015 UTC,"But then who gets benched? Do we stay with two CDMs, and play 2 CAMS and limit wing play, or move to 1 CDM and have wings. Higuita and Ceren have been very important to that midfield"
OCLions,3bu0ge,MrSantaClause,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"Ideally I'd say move to one DM and have wings but I guess that style of play wouldn't work too well with Boden and Ramos possessing a more offensive role. As weird and FIFA-ish as it might sound, a 5-2-1-2 with wingbacks might be an interesting option if we pick up another solid CB."
OCLions,3bu0ge,QuietFlight86,0,Thu Jul 2 04:26:50 2015 UTC,"We've already got Hines, St Ledger, and Collin who are all excellent. But that would take away from our strength which is our midfield. With Chicha's injury we'd be looking at playing Larin up front for a month or so anyway when he gets back from the Gold Cup. He'd be a great supersub"
OCLions,3bu0ge,MrSantaClause,7,Thu Jul 2 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"He's a world class playmaker you can't turn this down! I'm sure he fits anywhere however, Larin becomes late game striker IMO Pedro becomes backup plan, same for Pato or Rochez possible loans as well."
OCLions,3bu0ge,TYPE0N3,3,Thu Jul 2 03:49:18 2015 UTC,World class is an exaggeration.  He is a great player though and will definitely help the team.
OCLions,3bu0ge,MrSantaClause,4,Thu Jul 2 13:03:28 2015 UTC,he is LITERALLY world class...
OCLions,3bu0ge,daguru9,6,Thu Jul 2 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"HAHA...jesus people don't understand what world class is nowadays.  It's considered being in the top 4-5 in your position in the world.  Chicharito is a very very good striker, but he isn't close to ""LITERALLY"" world class."
OCLions,3bu0ge,beansley,3,Thu Jul 2 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, world class is a top 5 striker. He is very good player but definitely not world class. Worth noting that I also support Man Utd."
OCLions,3bu0ge,Bolivia_USA,2,Fri Jul 3 19:48:29 2015 UTC,"Because people hear the term ""World Class"" all the time nowadays and assume it applies to anyone that has ever done anything significant in world football.  Which isn't the case of course.  World Class is the best of the best."
OCLions,3bu0ge,Bolivia_USA,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think the formation would change all that much, I think Chicharito would be the primary striker with Larin as the primary sub.  Everything else would be the same.  This would free Ribeiro to play at RW or act as a sub for Kaka at ACM."
OCLions,3bu0ge,ljergens,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:49:18 2015 UTC,"I understand the thought here, but I think id take chicarito over any of our current strikers....Yes our players are awesome and really progressing but having a seasoned european player who has been proven to score goals has to be better than most players we can put up front."
OCLions,3bu0ge,logjam13,5,Thu Jul 2 18:42:08 2015 UTC,Hopefully it is true! Would be huge for us and the league. How trustworthy is the source?
OCLions,3bu0ge,macaco_gordinho,2,Thu Jul 2 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"No clue, I just saw thought I should share! He's been linked here a lot, and with Gio Dos Santos linked to LA I'm sure this is all worked out with MLS. However you never can be sure til papers are signed and press is out for the conference! Still, its ok to get excited!"
OCLions,3bu0ge,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:47:09 2015 UTC,"It definitely is good to get excited over, I have heard various rumors surrounding this for a while now. I just want him to sign already! haha"
OCLions,3buc22,McMarston,2,Thu Jul 2 05:34:55 2015 UTC,MLS live is the way to go. And they just dropped the price to $37.99
OCLions,3buc22,-kemosabe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:26:27 2015 UTC,Do you know where there are full replays of regular season games? I wouldn't mind watching the wins against LA and DC again.
OCLions,3buc22,Whitegoldteeth,2,Thu Jul 2 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"If they were on ESPN (don't remember), you may want to try the WatchESPN App; but I'm not sure they keep games that long.  Maybe MLS Live?"
OCLions,3brdv9,DemonSpeed,2,Wed Jul 1 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"Man, I love this guy"
OCLions,3brdv9,blou10,2,Wed Jul 1 23:53:49 2015 UTC,Really liking this team too!
OCLions,3bqtw3,macaco_gordinho,8,Wed Jul 1 12:15:33 2015 UTC,You're god damn right he does! I cant stop watching this goal.
OCLions,3bqtw3,mikesicle,7,Wed Jul 1 14:13:51 2015 UTC,Out of nowhere Rivas shows up!  I like how Ribiero ducks out of the way because he knows that Rivas is laying the hammer down.
OCLions,3bqtw3,mikesicle,4,Wed Jul 1 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the cropping of the shot makes it even better, Ribeiro loses it- BOOM!"
OCLions,3bqtw3,MaximusFSU,5,Wed Jul 1 14:51:27 2015 UTC,NOW WITH MORE GIFFY GOODNESS!!
OCLions,3bqtw3,KrishnaDirty,2,Wed Jul 1 20:39:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for this!  I've been dying to see a replay!
OCLions,3bqtw3,mikesicle,4,Wed Jul 1 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"Me too, since the dumbasses at the Citrus Bowl entrance held me up when I was already late. I got inside, got 5 feet from the stairs, and heard the roar of supporters when Rivas scored.   At least I got to see St. Ledgers save, thats the same as a goal for me!"
OCLions,3bqtw3,j_andrew_h,2,Wed Jul 1 14:50:59 2015 UTC,Here is the replay if you haven't seen it yet.
OCLions,3bsp87,spoonman33,2,Wed Jul 1 20:55:35 2015 UTC,You're not that far from the SC Ruckus.  We'll be watching the match at Liam's Irish Pub in Lake Mary.  Just an option.
OCLions,3bsp87,mcg1848,2,Thu Jul 2 14:05:05 2015 UTC,I thought about that...unfortunately we already have a hotel room in Deland and since its the 4th I don't really want to be on the road that night. Thanks for the offer though!
OCLions,3bpw1c,DiFaz07,9,Wed Jul 1 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, did not expect that kind of reception. Thank you! As you can see I no longer use team logos of any kind so they can be printed and, I won't get in trouble if they were to be sold. As for prints, I've inquired with a friend whom works at a print shop about what it would cost to run some prints and at what sizes so will keep you guys posted. Worst case, I will upload a printable version and share via google docs that you can have printed on your own.    The original pieces themselves are a solid 8750x13521px at 300dpi in CMYK. This put's them around 29x45 and can easily be cropped and ready for print, with a few minor tweaks. I try to keep print constraints in mind, but slip here and there.   Thank you again for the comments!    #ForeverALion #ForeverOurCity #LifeLibertyLions    Edit: Talked to my friend and gave his honest opinions about their print quality and it's not worth the trouble. So tonight I will be making some tweaks and will add a google drive link to this comment where everyone can download the image to use.    Edit Edit: For those that want to download a higher quality version you can find an 11x17 300dpi version here. Just an FYI I have it saved as a PDF file so google docs might not be able to preview it. Also, due to the size and quality is it sitting around 96MB. Otherwise feel free to use the jpg version in the post. Vamos Orlando!"
OCLions,3bpw1c,daguru9,3,Wed Jul 1 15:47:18 2015 UTC,I would totally buy a print of the Uncle Sam one... awesome job!

OCLions,3bpw1c,sault9,2,Wed Jul 1 11:26:28 2015 UTC,The Uncle Sam poster is amazing!  What are the dimensions of the file?
OCLions,3bpw1c,GoPackGo09,2,Wed Jul 1 12:04:09 2015 UTC,I too would buy a print. Serious talent!
OCLions,3bpw1c,boom180,2,Wed Jul 1 12:30:22 2015 UTC,I would seriously buy this print and frame it. Awesome job.
OCLions,3bpw1c,fuzzysmilez,2,Wed Jul 1 13:37:34 2015 UTC,My God...

OCLions,3bpw1c,estuhbawn,2,Wed Jul 1 19:11:14 2015 UTC,the Uncle Sam one also works pretty well as a phone wallpaper!   http://i.imgur.com/gByXJcU.jpg
OCLions,3bpd5n,McMarston,7,Wed Jul 1 02:02:17 2015 UTC,That's awesome and sad at the same time
OCLions,3bpd5n,coachhawley,6,Wed Jul 1 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"yeah it is sad and awesome, I hope it gets hyped if we make it to the final."
OCLions,3bpd5n,PersianImm0rtal,7,Wed Jul 1 03:51:11 2015 UTC,I don't think many new fans have been properly introduced to the US Open Cup and confuses us.
OCLions,3bpd5n,Armyless,7,Wed Jul 1 04:15:29 2015 UTC,It's all about that Champions League Qualification baby!
OCLions,3bpd5n,PersianImm0rtal,2,Wed Jul 1 04:18:14 2015 UTC,I'm sure it will. We've marketed big games well so far.
OCLions,3bpd5n,coachhawley,3,Wed Jul 1 12:15:55 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that this would be the only Open Cup game that we would host, regardless how far we advance."
OCLions,3bpd5n,AquariusSabotage,2,Wed Jul 1 13:53:00 2015 UTC,I think that extends to the semi final. Not sure how the final is decided though
OCLions,3bpd5n,jmoney0999,5,Wed Jul 1 20:50:54 2015 UTC,I think that is pretty good considering it was a Tuesday game and Women's world cup was going on. Anyone know what day the highest attended game was played on?
OCLions,3bpd5n,arabidpolarbear,2,Wed Jul 1 11:06:20 2015 UTC,"it appears the highest attended game so far this year was on tuesday the 16th in Kansas, against SKC vs St Louis (a little over 19k)"
OCLions,3bpd5n,goosec524,3,Wed Jul 1 12:30:59 2015 UTC,"Kinda surprised there was that many, was really afraid it was going to be much lower..."
OCLions,3bpd5n,daguru9,2,Wed Jul 1 11:48:43 2015 UTC,The Open Cup deserves more attention. It qualifies you for the Champions League just as well as the MLS cup.
OCLions,3bqnr9,apitimizer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:55:28 2015 UTC,I would contact the ILF about that. They have a Facebook page and a website. As a ruckus member who only talks to a select few of them I can't really help you there.  Edit.. Why the fuck was I downvoted for that? Sorry for trying to help?
OCLions,3bqnr9,HesitantlyYours,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"Cheers, tried to contact them but no reply. Would you happen to know the chances of a ruckus scarf shipped to AUS?"
OCLions,3bqnr9,mikesicle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"Super long shot, but if you're a Brisbane Roar fan I'll be at a game in November. I'm not ILF but I'll trade a scarf!"
OCLions,3bphcz,TheBrokenTurret,9,Wed Jul 1 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"The last time we made it to the quarterfinals (our deepest run) of the Open Cup was 2013, when we lost 5-1 in Chicago.  We may not have Long Tan this time, but I have a feeling this time will be different"
OCLions,3bphcz,logjam13,6,Wed Jul 1 03:40:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely, we are doing far better than them in MLS this year and I have lot of confidence for this quarter final!!"
OCLions,3bphcz,charizard77,4,Wed Jul 1 03:42:06 2015 UTC,"That score is a poor reflection of that game.  We were playing great until the second red card.  Hell, I remember over hearing a Fire employee telling the ball boy to kill time when giving the ball back to Sean Johnson after their second goal.  I even called him out on it.  He just responded that it's a smart move and ran off.  Also not having Long Tan is a plus."
OCLions,3bphcz,beerinthedark,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:43 2015 UTC,Might also take Shea off the roster if JK decides to call him up as a replacement
OCLions,3bphcz,David21538,6,Wed Jul 1 03:05:15 2015 UTC,Not likely since he's hurt and at best may just be getting back to playing around that point.

OCLions,3bou9s,jmoney0999,4,Tue Jun 30 23:54:27 2015 UTC,So this ref really wants this to be about his so far.
OCLions,3bou9s,rqsmuckles,5,Tue Jun 30 23:55:13 2015 UTC,Ribiero with all the work and Rivas with the fucking cannon ! Yes!!!!!
OCLions,3bou9s,DaPhoenix93,5,Wed Jul 1 00:12:56 2015 UTC,Well done Lions! And a clean sheet too!
OCLions,3bou9s,burajin,3,Wed Jul 1 01:30:35 2015 UTC,Let's goooooooooo Orlandooooooooo!
OCLions,3bou9s,babacristo,4,Tue Jun 30 23:35:16 2015 UTC,when did Rivas stop being shit?!
OCLions,3bou9s,Whitegoldteeth,6,Wed Jul 1 00:20:54 2015 UTC,he was never shit
OCLions,3bou9s,burajin,2,Wed Jul 1 02:07:13 2015 UTC,Everyone wanted instant results. Wouldn't let the poor kid settle in and find his grove. Fear the left leg!
OCLions,3bou9s,babacristo,-3,Wed Jul 1 18:16:01 2015 UTC,Oh come on now
OCLions,3bou9s,daguru9,3,Wed Jul 1 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"sorry man, you're wrong and i think your attitude is a little fair-weather and kind of ignorant of why we signed Rivas in the first place. like seriously, what were your expectations for this player? he makes a few ambitious mistakes as a 20 year old international rookie signing on a totally new team and he's shit?   he's shown serious potential from the beginning and tore up Colombia. he's only played 400 minutes (about 30 mins per game played), and if you really break down the stats there are worse examples of off-target shooters and off-sides drawers on the team. the difference is that Rivas has always shown aggression and ambition which is everything you should want in a rookie."
OCLions,3bou9s,Ruslan124,2,Wed Jul 1 05:36:14 2015 UTC,"Plus his early games he was playing at Forward, which is NOT his natural position.  He was having issues with being offsides, because at his normal position, LM, he doesn't have to worry about being past the last defender.  It was something he was not used too and had trouble adjusting.  Once they put him back at LM and allowed him to play his game, he started to gain confidence, some chemistry with Kaka and started to really shine..."
OCLions,3bou9s,Banthrau,4,Wed Jul 1 11:51:51 2015 UTC,about 3 games ago. I think some of the pressure to perform was relieved in the last round of the cup. 3 penalties must have helped boost his confidence.

OCLions,3bou9s,nautika,3,Wed Jul 1 10:38:05 2015 UTC,I fucking love ceren. He works so damn hard. What hustle !
OCLions,3bou9s,nautika,2,Wed Jul 1 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, we got a serious lineup."

OCLions,3bou9s,jnwallac,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:59:23 2015 UTC,I'm happy about this lineup but really hope kaka comes out early. Only problem is we don't really have any attacking players on the bench besides mwanga
OCLions,3bou9s,jmoney0999,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:38:18 2015 UTC,Really wanna see Dovovan play.  Love me some Wolfpack Nation.
OCLions,3bou9s,jnwallac,2,Tue Jun 30 23:47:40 2015 UTC,Me too. Last I heard though he hurt his elbow/arm and out for 6 weeks at least.
OCLions,3bou9s,jmoney0999,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:54:42 2015 UTC,I think he's on the bench though.

OCLions,3bou9s,spikebaylor,2,Wed Jul 1 00:02:14 2015 UTC,Hey he's an international starter !!!! Lol. But seriously thanks.
OCLions,3bou9s,Ruslan124,0,Wed Jul 1 00:13:30 2015 UTC,Those watching at home.  Are these legit fouls or is CLB flopping/going down too easily the way it looks out here?  We're a very physical team so im sure contact is there but not enough to warrant some of these.
OCLions,3bou9s,5heepdawg,3,Wed Jul 1 00:31:42 2015 UTC,I think the ref is being harsh. He needs to play more advantage and keep the flow of the game.
OCLions,3bpaid,coachhawley,7,Wed Jul 1 01:40:52 2015 UTC,St Ledger may have been our best player on the pitch tonight. If not for him they had at least 2
OCLions,3bpaid,logjam13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:54:20 2015 UTC,He and Ceren for me. Both were vital to this win.
OCLions,3bpaid,mikesicle,7,Wed Jul 1 03:45:09 2015 UTC,Anyone got some gifs of the goals? I missed both of them flipping back and forth to the WWC in another tab.
OCLions,3bpaid,rqsmuckles,3,Wed Jul 1 01:47:00 2015 UTC,If you go to the YouTube stream you can rewind it to the time they scored 21st and 35th minute.
OCLions,3bpaid,jmoney0999,2,Wed Jul 1 02:11:51 2015 UTC,You are awesome! Thank you!
OCLions,3bpaid,rqsmuckles,2,Wed Jul 1 02:30:30 2015 UTC,Did they announce the attendance?
OCLions,3bpaid,McMarston,4,Wed Jul 1 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"Apparently, 13,684.  2nd highest attendance for an Open Cup match."

OCLions,3bpaid,mikesicle,2,Wed Jul 1 11:36:27 2015 UTC,Looked like he got his ankle trampled.  Came off not long after but im sure he is fine and coach was just being precautionary aince Shea is out for a while.

OCLions,3bn00d,laser-TITS,9,Tue Jun 30 18:33:16 2015 UTC,Wow! Sad for the relationship with Louisville to end so soon; but having a close to home side to develop your young players is really necessary at this point and is the right step for Orlando City.
OCLions,3bn00d,j_andrew_h,8,Tue Jun 30 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"Bets on where they go?  Tampa and Jax both have NASL teams.  Miami is probably out too.  Tallahassee?  Gainesville?  Lakeland?  Maybe go out of state to somewhere like Mobile?  Edit:   Orlando City officials have been exploring where the team will play – they have looked at Eastern Florida State College in Brevard County and other options on the Space Coast – and what the team will be named – the source indicated that it likely will not be called Orlando City II, the moniker many MLS teams are using for their MLS affiliates.  With a team in the local area, players would be able to train with the first team day-to-day and drive for games nearby when not expected to play in MLS contests.   Well...that eliminates most of my list."
OCLions,3bn00d,DemonSpeed,8,Tue Jun 30 15:43:58 2015 UTC,It'll be local.  Tenorio's article that /u/daguru9 linked to said they have looked at some sites on the Space Coast but I would expect that to be the farthest it would be from Orlando for the sake of continuity and player movement.
OCLions,3bn00d,Generalparks,3,Tue Jun 30 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just saw that."
OCLions,3bn00d,DemonSpeed,3,Tue Jun 30 15:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'd guess Cocoa, Sanford, or Kissimmee"
OCLions,3bn00d,KubaBVB09,2,Tue Jun 30 16:11:10 2015 UTC,Kissimmee would be perfect with the sports wasteland it is right now.
OCLions,3bn00d,pvdfan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:36:38 2015 UTC,Or back at WWoS.
OCLions,3bn00d,DemonSpeed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:05:36 2015 UTC,"Watch them train in Sanford and play at Daytona Beach Municipal... it's about the same distance from Sanford to Daytona as it is Sanford to Orlando. One straight, boring shot down I4."
OCLions,3bn00d,Disorted,6,Wed Jul 1 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"I always felt this was the right way to go.  No offense to Louisville, I have some awesome friends who live there, but it just makes way more sense to have our affiliate team in the same city so our guys can train together and keep everything more integrated in one system.  Cool to see Pulis get the opportunity to coach."
OCLions,3bn00d,Generalparks,3,Tue Jun 30 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best course of action for us as a franchise.  A team that has Rochez, Estrela, Heath, Turner, Donovan, Redding, and Edwards all playing regularly would be fantastic for their development.  We could potentially bring back Akeil Barrett, too.  It basically adds another ~20 slots to our roster and could give promising academy players and draft picks professional minutes"
OCLions,3bn00d,logjam13,3,Tue Jun 30 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"I think so of those guys would have gone to LCFC, if not for the injuries and call ups killing our depth."
OCLions,3bn00d,logjam13,3,Tue Jun 30 16:19:31 2015 UTC,I'd rather they be playing together and still training with the 1st team though. Asking them to fly out and live in Louisville for a year and not be around an MLS environment vs training with Kaka and driving an hour to matches
OCLions,3bn00d,amoebas4breakfast,3,Tue Jun 30 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"Paul Tenorio's article, confirming Anthony Pulis as head coach and possible locations for games: http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/orlando-city-lions/on-the-pitch/os-orlando-city-usl-franchise-2016-20150630-post.html"
OCLions,3bn00d,MacAndSpam,3,Tue Jun 30 15:26:29 2015 UTC,Very good chance they play at Eastern Florida State College. I was talking to someone very close to the situation a few weeks ago and there were ongoing meeting between OCSC and EFSC. The soccer complex at Eastern Florida is brand new and incredible. They would have to add ~3000 seats to the complex for it to work though.

OCLions,3bo0cc,Generalparks,2,Tue Jun 30 20:32:17 2015 UTC,He's very good; but it's more that the club feeds him the content when they want to.

Since USA plays at the same time, the other TVs and the main projector will display USA vs Germany with sound, because that is a bigger game and brings out more casuals.  We started only having it on one TV, and now We usually have sound and ORLANDO city on all the TVs as of the past few watch parties."

OCLions,3bnf16,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Jun 30 18:56:20 2015 UTC,I think it was on one of the Coach's shows (or another Orlando podcast) a few weeks ago that they would be ready at the earliest in like early July
OCLions,3bmfk8,nysom1227,8,Tue Jun 30 12:03:30 2015 UTC,"While the games have been physical, I think it is the budding hatred and loathing between the two fanbases that are really fanning the flames of this building rivalry...  Old vs New, Small $ vs Big $, Quiet Supporters vs Boisterous Supporters, ""Stop trying to be bigger than you deserve"" vs ""We are here to dominate early and often"", Perceived Favoritism vs Perceived Non-Favoritism  ORLvCOL is how you build a rivalry that is not geographically biased..."
OCLions,3bmfk8,daguru9,3,Tue Jun 30 13:06:34 2015 UTC,Time will tell of course and obviously the Crew already have rivalries in MLS; but we're off to a good start in brewing what it takes for a good rivalry.
OCLions,3bmfk8,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:50:17 2015 UTC,With the recent announcement of the Atlanta MLS team in the works my first thought was a natural geographic rivalry of the south
OCLions,3bmmp8,daguru9,4,Tue Jun 30 13:16:13 2015 UTC,Mbengue should have taken the deal.
OCLions,3bmmp8,mikesicle,3,Tue Jun 30 13:56:24 2015 UTC,"Would have been some help, but played almost exclusively at LM... so he would be down the depth chart anyways."
OCLions,3bmmp8,mikesicle,2,Tue Jun 30 14:12:56 2015 UTC,"I know, its just sad to see him struggling to find playing time, when he could have just stayed."
OCLions,3bmmp8,logjam13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:27:01 2015 UTC,Have to wonder if we shorted him or the league salary structure wasn't good enough for him. With Turner and Heath becoming Homegrown after signing he probably would have qualified for a higher salary... But with Rivas in ahead of him he probably wouldn't have gotten much playing time
OCLions,3bmmp8,mikesicle,2,Tue Jun 30 14:40:31 2015 UTC,"True, I just think earlier in the season if he played his chemistry with Molino would have benefited our attack. And I cant help but think he didnt like our offer. Not to say we lowballed him, but he wasnt going to be one of our starters. He and Heath Pearce can go sit on a bench on Norway if thats the case."
OCLions,3blovo,logjam13,3,Tue Jun 30 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"According to The Mane Land, Darwin is available for tonight's match.  I would expect that he plays the full match to save legs for Saturday.  Edit: Conor Donovan has a hurt left elbow/arm and is out for 4 to 6 weeks."
OCLions,3blovo,pvdfan,4,Tue Jun 30 10:08:31 2015 UTC,"And I believe that Shea is considered OUT, 3-4 weeks with his groin injury...  And I wouldn't be surprised if Kaka actually starts and is subbed later.  While it is an USOC game, it is Columbus and we know how tough those games have been so far.  And has anyone heard anything about Rochez?"
OCLions,3blovo,daguru9,3,Tue Jun 30 11:55:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect Kaka to play this one. Not with an away game at Salt Lake Sat.
OCLions,3blovo,macaco_gordinho,2,Tue Jun 30 13:04:21 2015 UTC,Heath has said he's be playing a strong side.  I'm curious to see what that means in this case.
OCLions,3blovo,j_andrew_h,5,Tue Jun 30 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"If it was Charlotte or Chicago, maybe... but since it is Columbus and the first two were very physical and tough games, I expect Kaka to start... especially with a week off."
OCLions,3blovo,daguru9,2,Tue Jun 30 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"Was going to say this. Pretty sure they confirmed he'll be out for the next few weeks at a minimum. And agreed with Kaka starting and subbing out. They've had some rest and I think he's itching to make another impact at home like he did last week.    Edit: Just found this:   The Sentinel reports he will be shut down for 10 days before reevaluating his injury at that point. There’s a chance Shea could be added to the USMNT roster following the group stage if he heals quickly, but Klinsmann has given a sense of aversion to too much roster change this Gold Cup. The final group stage match is on July 13, while the knockout stage would begin on July 18.     So I doubt we'll see him in purple this month considering his chance at returning to the US National team for the knockout stages"
OCLions,3blovo,spoonman33,3,Tue Jun 30 12:45:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed about Shea...  which is fine, we were not expecting to see him this month anyways. :)"

OCLions,3bmfeu,daguru9,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"With the team stating that they are going to be active in the Summer Transfer window, their expression of a want for another midfielder, and the relationship between OCSC and Benfica, I could see him coming to Orlando if he does come.  Could be a good secondary option at ACM, to take some pressure off Kaka and allow him more rest.  And possibly play some RM..."
OCLions,3bmfeu,j_andrew_h,3,Tue Jun 30 12:06:00 2015 UTC,"If he's a solid option to start at RM in an attacking role then great; but while we could probably use a quality backup to Kaka, we probably can't afford to use the transfer window for that this year.  I would think that Molino will be the likely CAM next year when Kaka needs a rest; but this year we'll have to just pray that Kaka stays healthy for us."
OCLions,3bmfeu,j_andrew_h,3,Tue Jun 30 13:13:38 2015 UTC,"I did some looking at Amorim and he has seen time at ACM, DCM, and RM, but prefers ACM or RM...  At 30, I think he could be a solid rest of the season pickup for the team.  Could be slotted into multiple spots and cover a variety.    I think he could be a quality picking and the perfect midfield pickup... can play variety, experienced veteran, etc...  Just my opinion..."
OCLions,3bmfeu,ritzylunatic,3,Tue Jun 30 13:18:59 2015 UTC,great info!  If he was a more DCM then I'd say thanks but no since we have younger guys doing well in those roles even if he is better; but if he can be an attacking player at RM and to a lesser degree CAM; then yes please.  We urgently need help at RM to get is through this season.  We're not gong to go far with Avila or Neal in starting attacking midfield positions.  We'll do okay with them as they are decent & versatile players; but we really need an attacker over there.

You are more than welcome to have a few bunch of beers with us.  We always welcome visitors that make the trip. Also, bring scarves to trade, I especially want a Dallas Beer Guardians one for my collection!"
OCLions,3bj1vv,ragewu,14,Mon Jun 29 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome Turbo. You have two choices really for parking, either downtown by the bars (with free shuttles to the stadium) or in the lots around the stadium.  Many of the lots are presold so getting a pass isn't always possible.     Personally, I like to park downtown near a block of bars called ""Church Street Station"" where there will be an Orlando City block party going on.  You can use the bar ""Harry Buffalo"" as your GPS location [Address](129 W Church St, Orlando, FL 32801).    You can hang out in that area and then take the shuttles over to the stadium where there are some food trucks, Heinekens and some good activities before the game.  Also the Supporters Groups tailgate in Lot 11 if you want to hang out with them... parking map    Also, the Gameday Guide on the club website is a good resource for transportation, parking and policies.    Good luck and have fun (and loose the game of course)!"
OCLions,3bj1vv,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 29 17:25:28 2015 UTC,Would definitely suggest this. GF and I generally go to Harry Buffalo 1-2 hours before game time then shuttle over. Shuttles are easy to catch both ways.

Cheaper parking and goes directly to the residents who have to deal with the noise and traffic bullshit every match.  The Harp and Celt is a pretty friendly pub, especially for visitors. And their home made potato chips are really good!"

Someone earlier mentioned that there are a group of bars downtown called 'Church Street Station'. The best thing about this location (aside from the food/drinks) is that parking is actually directly beneath I4, so all you do after the game is pull out of the lot and get on the interstate."

OCLions,3biu9b,logjam13,5,Mon Jun 29 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure how everyone missed this article...  surprising knowing that Hines and Paterson did sign mutli-year deals.  Assuming they signed the agreements and they become ""active"" July 1st, since they were technically on loan.  Which also means that both of their original home clubs knew they were not going to keep/resign them, hence the announcements that they were ""released"".  Glad Hines is locked up, not sure about Pato...  guess this means he will still get a chance to prove himself here in Orlando."
OCLions,3biu9b,daguru9,3,Mon Jun 29 16:14:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what this means really.  Does it mean that we are stuck with Paterson or does it mean that he'll get paid by MLS in some way even if we don't keep him?    If he's going to be healthy and can play; then fine I'm all for him but we can't afford a spot on the team for a guy that just won't be able to get on the field.
OCLions,3biu9b,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"It means that both Hines and Paterson have signed contracts with OCSC; multi-year contracts at that. So only way to ""get rid of them"" is loan, transfer or release..."
OCLions,3biu9b,daguru9,2,Mon Jun 29 16:34:51 2015 UTC,I'm happy to have Hines locked up and if Pato can stay healthy for a bit; than good but I'm wondering what the effect would be on the Salary Cap if they released him.
OCLions,3biu9b,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 29 16:39:40 2015 UTC,On the positive side we'll hopefully get something for Pato when we offload him. On the negative side it'll be more difficult to get rid of him
OCLions,3biu9b,j_andrew_h,3,Mon Jun 29 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"I can't see anyone giving us something for him unless he shows he's fit first.  A game like tonight could be a good statement for him to either make the case to stay here or get interest from somewhere else; but I don't know if he's even ready to play yet.    I feel for the guy, I'm sure his hopes for Orlando were even higher than ours for him.  Hopefully he can make something happen for himself."
OCLions,3biu9b,mcg1848,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:16:19 2015 UTC,Yeah it wouldn't be this summer. Waiving him would clear wages but if we're looking to bring in 2-4 players next month we'll need to move 3-5 on
OCLions,3biu9b,j_andrew_h,4,Mon Jun 29 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"So does this mean we may finally start loaning players to Louisville, aside from Rivera?  Pretty sure the only other loan has been Ford as well."
OCLions,3biu9b,niNroM,2,Mon Jun 29 17:24:32 2015 UTC,We'll have to either loan or release some players.  I can see players that haven't been able to make an impact like Pato and Cascio getting released and then some of our younger players loaned out.  I'm not sure they will all go to Louisville; but I would hope so.
OCLions,3bi6hd,NSZY53E,3,Mon Jun 29 12:42:43 2015 UTC,I am headed down there - already love to hate the Crew.  Doesn't help that they are competing with the USWNT game vs Ger.
OCLions,3bi6hd,mcg1848,2,Mon Jun 29 12:53:03 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Maybe I'll be able to call an uber from the stadium vs taking the bus back to the Amway.
OCLions,3bi6hd,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 29 12:58:41 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that cell reception and data service is especially bad at the stadium with a large crowd there.  I tried this a few games ago and ended up walking back toward down town anyway simply because I couldn't get the app to work.
OCLions,3bi6hd,daguru9,3,Mon Jun 29 14:22:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, only way is if there isn't a lot of people. I've done both the shuttle and walked to downtown. The shuttle is faster but the walk isn't bad either."

OCLions,3bi6hd,spoonman33,3,Mon Jun 29 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"I will be going, but I think selling the game out will be difficult given that it is a Tuesday night with not as much notification ahead of time for people to call off work.  If my inference is wrong, then I'm not sure why the low attendance, if what you say is true."
OCLions,3bi6hd,Disorted,3,Mon Jun 29 12:54:52 2015 UTC,"Not a lot of exposure for US Open Cup, it's a weekday, not an MLS game (will probably be resting some players), USA v Germany at the same time, etc. etc.    Also it appears they are still selling official tickets at or near full price of a regular game...which seems odd considering Open matches are typically cheaper"
OCLions,3bi6hd,spoonman33,6,Mon Jun 29 13:06:59 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm waiting to decide if I'm going or not. I was really hoping for some discounted tickets to this game, but if I'm going to spend $30 per person, I may as well go to an MLS game. I'm not seeing too many deals on the FB page either :("
OCLions,3bi6hd,misanthropicbuddha,2,Mon Jun 29 13:13:53 2015 UTC,StubHub has some in the 20-25 range. That's about as low as I'm seeing right now. The front office should have had a sale over the weekend to drum up interest in the event.
OCLions,3bi6hd,spoonman33,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:19:03 2015 UTC,"I think the common thread here is that nobody seems to give a crap about the Open Cup, including the FO, in terms of PR.  Also, I wonder if the lack of a discount is from orders from the USSF and not the FO."

OCLions,3bi6hd,logjam13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:40:35 2015 UTC,Buy tickets off Stubhub or the Facebook page for Season Tickets.  You should be able to get a lower bowl ticket for a decent price if a season ticket holder can't go.    I'll be going so you can't have mine; but you should be able to get a ticket at a decent price.

OCLions,3bfxfs,secretlyadog,8,Sun Jun 28 21:43:04 2015 UTC,I suppose it's just a coincidence the Chicharito to Orlando rumors started at exactly the same time as OCSC was looking to sell a few Mexico National Team match tickets.
OCLions,3bfxfs,PickerTJ,5,Sun Jun 28 22:03:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to dig but Paul Tenorio has confirmed that these are not rumors on his Twitter account.   Basically they expects to get offers from teams in Europe and if he likes them he is going there, if he doesn't get offers he likes he will head mls and OCSC is the arranged destination.  Tenorio and the Sentinel have a great relationship with the front office so I'm inclined to believe him. Despite how fishy the rumors look."

OCLions,3bamxt,misanthropicbuddha,11,Sat Jun 27 11:12:06 2015 UTC,Darwin ceren impresses me more every match. He's a huge key to our D with collin out.
OCLions,3bamxt,Wheaties466,4,Sat Jun 27 13:13:36 2015 UTC,I feel bad. I doubted his ability to play at this level after his first two starts because he honestly wasn't playing well then after that he has been amazing except for the stupid penalty he gave up. Probably our best player this season so far.
OCLions,3bamxt,jmoney0999,6,Sat Jun 27 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"he definitely has the biggest gaps in my mind between his best and worst.  luckily he's up top more often than not.  He hasn't had nearly as many mental gaffes lately and just an absolute tank on the field.  The combination of Ceren, Higuita, Ramos, and Collin scare me sometimes.  I bet they scare the shit out of other teams too though :)"
OCLions,3bamxt,spikebaylor,2,Sat Jun 27 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm guilty of this too. I think a lot of us forget that this particular version of the team has not been together that long, so there was still a ""feeling out"" process initially.  I'm glad that their form is finally (hopefully) coming around."
OCLions,3bamxt,Popcornshrimpeater,4,Sat Jun 27 15:26:47 2015 UTC,Ceren is nice too when we need to occasional wonderstrike.

OCLions,3bapev,SlayingGuilty,3,Sat Jun 27 19:59:08 2015 UTC,Eh.. I don't think we can blame the refs during the Impact game. We played absolutely awful.
OCLions,3bapev,mcg1848,3,Sat Jun 27 20:08:15 2015 UTC,"That's true. If I recall correctly, then that was one of the games that had a higher ref rating, despite the loss."
OCLions,3bapev,spikebaylor,2,Sat Jun 27 20:16:14 2015 UTC,Nice breakdown.  Turner jumps out at me as being lower than I would have expected.  He had the one relief appearance where he played out of position and got abused but otherwise I have been very happy with his performance.   I'd be curious to see the High / Low and opponent.
OCLions,3bapev,mcg1848,2,Sat Jun 27 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"I think turner has done decent enough in his showings.  Take out the out of position game and i'd put him at a strong 5-6.  He doesn't quite seem to be at the level of Ramos, but does a good enough job filling in when needed.  There is plenty of upside to him still.  He's very young and has a lot of time to get experience."
OCLions,3bapev,mcg1848,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""High/Low""?  Also, there isn't much in the way of aggregate opponent data since Orlando has only played most teams once.  I could split up performances based on conference too if you, or anyone, would want that."

OCLions,3b6yzi,secretlyadog,4,Fri Jun 26 17:55:48 2015 UTC,I'd rather have a guy like him in the game like who teams at least have to account for than a player like Avila or Neal who teams simply ignore.  Avila and Neal are good to have on the team because they play a number of positions pretty well; but they are not true attacking players and we really NEED that in our front 4.
OCLions,3b6yzi,j_andrew_h,2,Fri Jun 26 21:02:52 2015 UTC,They are great rotation players to have because like you sId they can fill in in 5 or 6 positions but yea. It's not good to have to rely on them starting a majority of matches.

OCLions,3b5w9o,beerinthedark,6,Fri Jun 26 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"Relevant bit:   No problem is bigger than that of Lions’ winger Brek Shea, who injured his groin, or adductor muscle, during training with the U.S. national team in Amsterdam. Shea played through the injury against Holland, but did not play against Germany and then returned to Orlando City, where he has tried to grit through the pain and discomfort.  It just consistently got worse,” Shea said. “I’ve been playing and running at 70 percent, not even.""  Orlando City will rest Shea for at least 10 days before re-evaluating the injury and determining a course of action.   I say it's nice to finally know why he's been playing sluggish recently, and I hope he gets as much time off as he needs. He really deserves a break.   Also, his injury is what kept him from being called for the Gold Cup."

OCLions,3b0v1x,coachhawley,15,Thu Jun 25 01:50:18 2015 UTC,Great game overall by Orlando.  Tally Hall is a boss.  We could have been down 1-0 on that early mishap and lose our spirit.  Rivas looked great.  Hopefully nothing serious with injury because we'll need him with Brek possibly being out and Larin being gone for Gold Cup.  Kaka had a good game with a lot of chances.  Ceren was dominating all over the field.
OCLions,3b0v1x,nautika,6,Thu Jun 25 01:56:37 2015 UTC,Rivas always looked like a winger playing forward to me. He looks much better out wide and had nice service on the goal.
OCLions,3b0v1x,PickerTJ,11,Thu Jun 25 02:49:57 2015 UTC,"If Irwin wasn't having a great match we would have had 5 Lewis Neal needs a rest.  After penalties in Charleston, starting in Montreal, and playing the full 90 today at 33 years old, I'm surprised he's standing Kaka and Rivas were fantastic on the offensive end and Higuita and Ceren physically dominated the center of the park Only one #1 pick has more goals in their rookie season than Cyle Larin: Danny Mwanga (7).  He's also halfway to the all-time rookie scoring mark.  Damani Ralph had 12 in 2003 We're only 1 point off 2nd in the East!"

We gave Col so many early chances....luckily, Tally was a beast. We couldn't convert on fantastic chances, either, until late. I love this win and feel like we totally outplayed them, but soccer is a funny sport sometimes."
OCLions,3b0v1x,werdx,2,Thu Jun 25 02:08:50 2015 UTC,"The first half was a bit hard to watch.  When Colorado got the ball they looked dangerous just couldnt put it away.  Similar to us, but they looked better at moving the ball and creating chances in the last third than we typically do.  The second half though we looked pretty solid.  Always seems like a crapshoot on which version of the team we'll see from game to game and half to half."

OCLions,3b0v1x,TheGeneral11,3,Thu Jun 25 02:28:28 2015 UTC,really impressive hustle from everyone. you could tell how much it meant to them to show up for the fans in this heated Heineken Rivalry Week™ rivalry against the longtime hated Colorado.
OCLions,3b0v1x,babacristo,3,Thu Jun 25 04:09:21 2015 UTC,Nothing like watching lightning strike in the background during the match when watching from the supporter's section.

OCLions,3b0v1x,cwinn13,3,Thu Jun 25 11:56:58 2015 UTC,"Kaka trying to prove me wrong!  Liked what i saw from him yesterday.  Sti has some touch issues to work out but so does the rest of the team.  More importantly he looked aggressive and that is what he's really been missing.  Charging after 50/50 balls and short passes instead of waiting around hand having them picked off.  Tried to get a few shots off and got a run of play goal.    Rivas looking good.  This kid really has some potential.  I know people really look down on him and he certainly has things to work on but when he comes in the entire offense gets a huge boost.  He'd have shined even more last night if the rest of the team would play the through balls to him quicker.  So many times he was making great curling runs but the ball would get held up or played to Kaka.  He does a pretty good job lobbing balls into the box too.  Higuita and Ceren are so fun to watch.  They scare me sometimes in the way Collin scares me.  But damned if they dont get shit done.  Hall minus a FEW minor errors (which i feel he is entitled to after so long off) since he's started has been a revelation compared to Ricketts.    Boden and Neal definitely showed their fatigue and rightfully so.  Not that they didnt put in the hustle, but noticeably less energy than normal.  Hopefully they get some rest.  Pretty decent game from Larin.  He's getting better and better.  I know a lot of people want to see him continue up front and im not opposed to that but id like to see us bring im a veteran striker who can work with him and in a year or two end up with a phenominal striker.  Seems a LOT of promising rookies do well their first year and fizzle out.  I dont want that to happen  to Cyle.  Everyone else pretty solid performances as well.  St Ledger could have had a better game.  Ramos looked good as always.  Hines was good.  Shea needs to be 100% healthy.  He hasnt played well for some time and now we know why.  Hopefully Rivas is ok and can start."

OCLions,3b0v1x,Jkparty,3,Thu Jun 25 01:54:14 2015 UTC,Ramos definitely impressive.  He's consistent through all games.  It also looks like he learned his lesson after that red card and kept a cool head.
OCLions,3b0v1x,nautika,-3,Thu Jun 25 02:24:06 2015 UTC,I'm so sick of Lewis Neal.
OCLions,3b0v1x,Triig,2,Thu Jun 25 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"I certainly dont think he should be starting when we're 100% healthy, but dude puts in a pretty good shift most of the time.  Remember he has started 3 games in a week including the 2hr+pks game in charleston.  He's 33.  I think overall he is better than Avila but if we have our 5 best midfielders out there i dont think Neal or Avila should be out there."

OCLions,3b0fgc,spikebaylor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:36:35 2015 UTC,no way that's some of the best officiating we've had all season
OCLions,3b0fgc,babacristo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"Now it could be that i had a bad view of a lot of calls.  But at various points in the game he'd let little things go, and then randomly he'd call one or two... and then.. its ok again.  There were what looked like quite a few obvious calls bordering on card worth at times (for both teams) and he'd act like it never happened but then a minute later whistle for the exact same thing going the other way.  And im not being a homer here.  He did this consistently for/against both teams.  There were plenty of fouls we should have been called for as well."
OCLions,3b0fgc,spikebaylor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"there were definitely mistakes, but almost every game we've played this season has had a serious penalty drawn questionably-- sometimes in our favor but often not. genuine referee consistency is a very rare thing, but pretty much every call this ref made ended without a card or simply allowing advantage or the ball to continue, and that's a great thing, especially for our style of play.   the less the play is stopped the better imho, even if some more minor fouls get swept under the rug."
OCLions,3b0fgc,babacristo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:53:05 2015 UTC,"I also like refs who are more lenient as long as they are consistent.  With guys like ceren, higuita, and ramos it is definitely in our favor. Id argue he was not consistent though.  Certainly we have rarely had a good ref, and this one did a better job of not affecting the game than others but he was definitely not consistent in my eyes.  Quite a few really rough tackles waved off like nothing, but immediately later a small bump in the back gets called.  Next play someone is climbing all over the guy in front to get to a header and no call followed by similarly harsh tackles that earlier were waved off but now get a whistle.  Im not saying anything he did changed the game or had an impact but it became a joke in my section to guess on whether or not this foul or that foul was going to get called.  Sometimes he didnt even know.  It was some seconds later that he'd call it.  And it wasnt because he was looking to play advantage.  Maybe with a second viewing on tv it will look different but the officiating seemed all over the place at the game."

OCLions,3b0fgc,orlandobob,4,Thu Jun 25 01:00:09 2015 UTC,Been rather unimpressed with St. Ledger tonight...
OCLions,3b0fgc,logjam13,5,Thu Jun 25 00:31:57 2015 UTC,Larin now has 7 goals in his last 10 appearances for club and country.  That's ridiculous.
OCLions,3b0fgc,Timmyj01,3,Thu Jun 25 01:19:31 2015 UTC,What were people saying about Kaka?!
OCLions,3b0fgc,spikebaylor,3,Thu Jun 25 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"Ive been very critical of him lately but he fixed some of the bigger issues ive had with him lately.  He went hard after 50/50 balls consistently through the game, took some shots and good runs i to the box.  He still had quite a few bad passes and ball control, but over all this is more like the Kaka i want to see."
OCLions,3b0fgc,daguru9,2,Thu Jun 25 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"I have been a little critical of him also and I think I know some of the reason's why he struggles at time.  Kaka seems to play best and enjoy it more when the game is more wide open and a much faster pace.  Once Rivas was brought in, the game opened up and the pace picked up considerably.    That is when Kaka was able to be more effective and started to get into the flow.    I do not think he particularly enjoys the slower, possession based style that Coach Heath usually employs.  With that style of play, the field compacts and teams have been stuff the middle of the field and not giving Kaka any space to move or do what he needs to.  Teams seem to be fine with allow Boden and/or Ramos space to bomb crosses all day, as long as they clog the middle and double team Kaka and whoever is playing the forward.  When Rivas was on (and in the past when Shea was fully fit), they were able to use their speed to widen our attack, which forced the defense to spread out and not jam the middle.  This opens Kaka to do what he does best...  This game was the perfect example... first half, he struggled with our normal style of player.  The second half, after Rivas was in, we were able to use his speed to be a threat, the defense opened and the middle was wide open and Kaka looked like himself."
OCLions,3b0fgc,spikebaylor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:02:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah i dont actually fault him for not producing.  We continuously compact and crowd the middle.  He is always double/triple teamed.  Not many people make runs off the ball very well.  So his relative lack of play making is not entirely his fault.  oddly its been more his work ethic that has bothered me lately.  He has been very lazy lately when things arent perfect.  Really lazy/ soft passes, not making true challenges for open balls, he never jumps, half hearted attempts at chasing downt through balls etc.  These are individual errors that can be fixed regardless of teammates or tactical choices.  Wednesday though he did a 180.  Constantly running down balls and closing down the opposition, some good passing, good looks at goal, chasing down mistakes.  Thats all i wanted from him and he showed it against the Rapids.  I just want more of that.  If he plays at 100% he'll keep showing better performances as the team improves and the tactics solidify.  in light of the information on the shea injury, its very possible he has been playing with an injury as well and we just havent heard about it."

OCLions,3aucrn,catch_th3m_all,3,Tue Jun 23 16:06:53 2015 UTC,Down the depth chart and have been gone for the U20 WC for a while...  Looks like he just got back into town today: https://twitter.com/negao_valdo/status/613403718701088768
OCLions,3aucrn,daguru9,3,Tue Jun 23 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"Just too deep down the depth chart. He had some good minutes for Portugal in the U20 World Cup. Ceren, Higuita, Okugo, and even Neal and Avila are all more than capable of playing DM and mini Heath has emerged as the better of the two. Hopefully he gets loaned out. Even with the Gold Cup, we're only losing Ceren in that position"
OCLions,3aodkw,Semco14,2,Mon Jun 22 04:23:44 2015 UTC,Any idea if we need wristbands for this or if it's a first come first serve type signing?? I called the store and they just seemed confused.

OCLions,3aodkw,wonder_chicken,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:19:37 2015 UTC,I called the dicks store today and asked about it and they said they recommend getting there at 6am and waiting in line.

OCLions,3aodkw,SurfingLion14,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"Larin and Donovon will be at Dick's, Shea and Heath will be at an Adidas Store. I'm not planning on going to Dick's, rather to Adidas.  Brek is my favorite player, I have his name on the back of my Jersey. Having said that, it is definitely not worth more than about 2-3 hours of my time to get an autograph from him. Maybe i would if I was a kid or had a kid, I understand why people do it. I'm just not going to do it myself.  People wait in huge lines at cons to get celebrity autographs, people wait in huge lines at Disney for a ninety second ride that they've been on a thousand times already. Don't even get me started on when the White Castle truck came to town, people went mental. My point is there are definitely going to be quite a few people there willing to wait in a very long line. More power to them.  Getting there at 6am for a 2pm signing seems pretty excessive to me, but when I think about it people are probably going to do it."

There are a LOT of vendors on AliExpress selling kits, and they aren't all being made from the same people.

Also, I don't know how many days rest Darwin and Cyle have had, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ribeiro starts over Larin with Cyle coming in around 60-70 minutes, and I'm conflicted if Ceren will start over Neal.

OCLions,3ah41f,Ebraam101,3,Sat Jun 20 04:23:07 2015 UTC,No Avila? I like that line up!
OCLions,3ah41f,jmoney0999,2,Sat Jun 20 14:10:30 2015 UTC,I don't understand why everybody hates Avila so much. I know that he is no Kevin Molino but its not like he is doing horrible. He had a goal line clearance against Charleston and scored a header from a Brek Shea assist a while go. I know he is not a perfect player but he hasn't done anything bad either.
OCLions,3ah41f,Ebraam101,6,Sat Jun 20 14:41:39 2015 UTC,His positioning is solid and all I just think it's the fact he doesn't really ever have any positive plays. It seems when he gets the ball it's almost always a back pass or a turnover. Very rarely does he play anything forward or any penetrating passes. I know back passes have a purpose but sometimes it just seems too much. He always put in the effort people just want more attack from an attacking player. I may be way off but that's just my thoughts
OCLions,3ah41f,spikebaylor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:48:57 2015 UTC,i understand your reasoning but we really don't need to be an attacking player if you think about it. When you watch Orlando play you really only see one guy come up the right side: Rafael Ramos. When Rafa dribbles up the ball to look for crosses guess who stays back: Eric Avila. We need him to play more defensively and to give Rafa more room to work with.
OCLions,3ah41f,misanthropicbuddha,3,Sat Jun 20 16:14:35 2015 UTC,He's a smart player and gets into good spaces but loses the ball too much going forward. I think there's a reason Chivas made him a RB. But for a backup he's more than solid
OCLions,3ah41f,EaChronic,4,Sat Jun 20 15:57:57 2015 UTC,"Thats my thing.  Both Avila and Neal are super fantastic guys to have on the bench.  They are both solid players, they can fill in all over the place and put in a good shift.  They aren't typically going to come in and be game changers, but they are going to put in a good shift, make few mistakes, and be overall reliable.  They're not however starting material. They arent guys people are going to be afraid of or change their stategy for.   In the case of Avila i belive he IS a detriment at midfield as a starter.  Because he isnt as forward minded,  our right side isnt as dangerous and other teams are realizing that.  So the focus shifts over to the left where boden/shea now have to work harder.  If we had a strong offensive guy at RM then we'd be dangerous on the left, right, and center and we'd be able to really pull apart defenses."
OCLions,3ah41f,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sat Jun 20 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"That is a lot to ask for, and I like the Pedro/Cyle dynamic of both on the pitch.  I don't know who would sub in for Cyle other than Rivas. Unless another mid goes in for Cyle and go back to a 4-2-3-1."
OCLions,3ah41f,EaChronic,2,Sat Jun 20 09:52:08 2015 UTC,"Rivas or Rochez could be a direct swap or you could bring in Avila, Bodz, or Rivas and switch back to a 4-2-3-1 with Pedro up top"
OCLions,3ah41f,EaChronic,2,Sat Jun 20 14:23:22 2015 UTC,"it wouldn't be dynamic with both of them on there, it would be slow and flat"

OCLions,3ah41f,EaChronic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:45:36 2015 UTC,"?!!?!?!! WHYY would you want this Ceren has been a straight rock all year long. We haven't lost since Higuita has started. Ribeiro would die on the wing he's a big central striker... etc.  Plus the formation will never change, it's Heath's formation w/ OCSC ever since our USL days"
OCLions,3ah41f,EaChronic,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:04:47 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said except about Ribiero. You know he's been a midfielder pretty much his whole career right?
OCLions,3ah41f,trunkstai,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:47:02 2015 UTC,not a winger though.
OCLions,3ah41f,secretlyadog,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:46:25 2015 UTC,? That's playing everyone except Ribeiro in their best position. And we've used a 3-5-2 and a 4-3-3 this year alone
OCLions,3ah41f,EaChronic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"We haven't used any of those formations until we have subbed, OC's instagram has a picture of every starting XI so far this year... all Heath's 4 2 3 1"
OCLions,3ah41f,OCityBeautiful,2,Mon Jun 22 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"They're missing graphics for the first Montreal game (3-5-2) and the first Columbus game (4-3-3) and if you watched the Portland game you'll know Higuita didn't play as a winger, Kaka was wide left.  It's tactically irresponsible to only have 1 formation at your disposal.  The 3-5-2 was out of necessity but the 4-3-3 has had its moments this season.  For the formation I mentioned, it would look like this:  ------Larin  Kaka------ Ribeiro  -Neal-----Higuita  ------Ceren  You could call it a 4-3-2-1 if you want, the numbers don't really matter.  Ribeiro and Kaka have freedom to roam behind Larin and work in tandem while the midfield trio creates an overload in the center of the pitch.  It's a little vulnerable down the flanks but every player sans Ribeiro has made a start in those positions this season.  You could swap Rivas for Ribeiro if you like, just something I'd like to see in action"
OCLions,3ah41f,nrrfed,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:05:53 2015 UTC,"I'm done arguing lol It's tactically irresponsible if you keep that formation during games alway. Heath plays HIS 4 2 3 1 almost exclusively and responsibly switches it during the game depending on the flow... But I remember first Montreal Game, everything I have posted is off the top of the head but a simple google search can confirm all.. we played our normal 4 2 3 1 , but it was more of a hybrid 5 2 2 1 with Kaka out wide and a Defender playing a CB/DM hybrid.... We played Boden and St. Ledger I believe for the first time and Turner played for Ramos b/c of a red   the Columbus game Molino was still playing and we reverted back to our normal formation after playing a hybrid 4-3-3 in portland.  I agree Portland is the one place we lined up as a 4-3-3 but watching the game they didn't play like that at all. No wing play etc. Midfielders sat back and Backs overlapped. Sick first goal by Larin to start his career off with the chest.   I'm not a big ""formation"" guy by the numbers b/c it's all philosophy and how the players play those positions..Madrid is the best example b.c they play full hybrid formation, you could call it a 4-2-2 , 4-3-3, or 4-5-1 but it's all how they play during the flow of the game.   I also see Ribiero as a central target man and nothing else, I can't see him playing wide or as a midfielder the way he's played all season. Slower, but big body and good leg; and obviously Kaka has that free roam Cam position...  Good talking with you man, I liked friendly debates especially when we both root for the same team. Our offense still needs to find it's stride one day and Rivas also needs to find his first pass of the year lol"

OCLions,3ah5lu,zrowny,5,Sat Jun 20 04:03:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought Earl was going to get it for sure.  However, everybody LOVED Ramos (well deserved, I'm just saying).

Orlando has to make it further than last year's quarterfinals though."

OCLions,3ag1ra,Coramoor_,5,Fri Jun 19 21:10:39 2015 UTC,Larin might be the greatest pick up in the MLS this year.

OCLions,3abq7q,zrowny,12,Thu Jun 18 20:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's definitely hard to tell if it really is a penalty or not, but i think it's a miracle the battery players got away without a single card for just about getting to 2nd base with the ref, so i don't feel bad for them for this one.....and more importantly they didn't give up and whine after that call, they fought hard and came back and forced the game into pks, so good on them for that."
OCLions,3abq7q,goosec524,3,Thu Jun 18 22:09:45 2015 UTC,I'm glad that the ref handled that so well. He has got a level head on them shoulders.
OCLions,3abq7q,SlayingGuilty,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:38:07 2015 UTC,I would've had 5 Red cards out for all those mofos that extended a wrist at me.
OCLions,3abq7q,EaChronic,3,Sat Jun 20 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"Incredibly hard to tell, but Cooper dives towards the ball with his feet swinging out towards Rivas. The replay has enough motion blur so its not clear if Cooper's feet trip him up before he gets to the ball or vice versa. But its definitely not as clear cut as some people are trying to say."
OCLions,3abq7q,thecitybeautifulgame,-1,Thu Jun 18 20:30:45 2015 UTC,That is a straight up stone cold penalty every day. You cannot tackle a player to get the ball ever.
OCLions,3abq7q,Keepa1,2,Thu Jun 18 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"you are absolutely off your rocker if you think that is a stone cold penalty every day. Jesus, that is the worst PK shout i've seen called on a goalkeeper in my LIFE.   This is basic fundamental goalkeeping and he got the ball first with his hands. anything that follows is just what happens when you go in on the keeper. Forward deserves anything coming to him if he decides to make a play for the ball."
OCLions,3abq7q,jmoney0999,3,Fri Jun 19 01:40:48 2015 UTC,Regardless of the call that's crazy those players didn't at least get a yellow. The one that actually pushed him is a red card offense easily.   Whoever actually made the gif do you have a gif of Ramos run to draw his penalty. It was amazing watching him weave through defenders. If not no big deal !
OCLions,3abq7q,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:37:29 2015 UTC,"You can even tell that Traxler and Radcliffe are suprised that there was a PK. I think based on the angle the ref had he felt it was a PK when from the tv angle is was not. However, the way the Charleston team went off was insane. I'm sure the ref didn't give a card because he knew it would increase the level of intensity."
OCLions,3abq7q,goosec524,2,Fri Jun 19 13:44:15 2015 UTC,i was under the assumption the ref had left the cards in his locker at half time so that's why nobody got a card
OCLions,3abq7q,macaco_gordinho,2,Fri Jun 19 15:12:22 2015 UTC,grabs a sharpie and colors his hand real quick
OCLions,3abq7q,Keepa1,-2,Fri Jun 19 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"Not a PK, team bias is making you people blind. Can't believe this is even up for discussion. great keeping and the ref fucked him over for nothing."
OCLions,3abq7q,goosec524,2,Fri Jun 19 01:41:50 2015 UTC,"it's not that cut and dry though, it looks like Rivas got to the ball just before the keeper and he went through him. I'm not saying thats the case and it might be a bad call, but it's hard for us to really jump to a real conclusion on this after watching the replay. FYI i thought it was a bad call at first but after watching the replay i'm not sure and i can see in the heat of the moment why the ref would call that."
OCLions,3abq7q,Keepa1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:30:35 2015 UTC,That's not how it works though. It absolutely does not matter that the player touched the ball just before the goalkeeper does. The goalkeeper still got ball first before any part of the players body and it's 100% clear as day.
OCLions,3abq7q,goosec524,2,Fri Jun 19 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry i got distracted and didn't clarify - it looks as if Rivas touches the ball away before the keeper can touch it (or that's what the ref thought he saw) and the keeper goes through Rivas before getting to the ball...i know if the keeper gets the ball first its no pk any day, but if he fouls the player then gets the ball it should be a pk."
OCLions,3abq7q,Keepa1,0,Fri Jun 19 03:32:04 2015 UTC,"sure i get that, but that's not what happened. and it's black and white  that that is not what happened. The ball went 180 degrees behind Rivas with force. it's just an awful decision by the ref and he had no way to justify it."
OCLions,3abq7q,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:41:20 2015 UTC,Don't come in to this group and start telling people what's what. You want to state your case that is fine and I will gladly listen but don't think showing up here annonymously and talking like this will get you listened to. And going to /r/MLS to share you disdain is low class as well. You might as well have been the player on the field in Charleston who shoved the ref.
OCLions,3abq7q,Keepa1,2,Fri Jun 19 13:48:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry this was the only place this was being talked about and I felt compelled to chime in. And please don't think that it's my choice to be anonymous that's just how reedit works. It's not Orlando that I'm sharing my disdain about, it's the refs decision making. The talk here about the PK potentially being legitimate did grind my gears a bit but I just wanted to share my thoughts. Sorry for attacking the people and the sub. It blew my mind and as a goalkeeper I felt like my figurative 1st amendment rights were violated by this call."

Of course, between this and several other isolated incidents, that's all the rest of people who watch MLS remembers.

OCLions,3a9028,zrowny,2,Thu Jun 18 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"I was at the game too, drove down from Charlotte. The battery fans around me at center field were cordial, didn't mind me cheering for OC every now and then on our plays. Didn't shove anything in my face when Battery scored.  And we all agreed that 2nd OC penalty wasn't a penalty from our angle.  And that ref was an absolute mess."
OCLions,3a9028,daguru9,17,Fri Jun 19 11:28:18 2015 UTC,9 people die in a shooting and the obvious move is connect it with a sports town you dislike.  Yet another case of someone on social media that has no business speaking in public.
OCLions,3a9028,mikesicle,9,Thu Jun 18 05:17:44 2015 UTC,That's just great. This ass clown is on a billboard representing our fan base. Unbelievable.
OCLions,3a9028,OgerBox,11,Thu Jun 18 10:43:18 2015 UTC,... and he's had a kid.
OCLions,3a9028,mikesicle,7,Thu Jun 18 13:06:07 2015 UTC,Oh I thought he was just fat
OCLions,3a9028,Timmyj01,10,Thu Jun 18 14:11:21 2015 UTC,Most of the fan based billboards are no longer up and mostly on the electronic.  I am fairly certain that OCSC will make sure he doesn't pop up again...
OCLions,3a9028,exedotdmg,4,Thu Jun 18 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"Close on the last name.   edit: that took way too long to get taken down, and the facebook link here was to his personal page."
OCLions,3a9028,awol05,2,Thu Jun 18 13:12:05 2015 UTC,Yeah what he did was terrible. But we still shouldn't condone to witch hunting guys. Let's just hope he gets the message and make sure this doesn't happen again.

It was very stupid, insensitive and uncalled for. But if I, or you, were called out for every stupid thing we said then we'd be in a world of shit. Unfortunately he chose to do this on a platform that many people could see it on. Poor choices.  Please stop posting his personal information, nobody deserves that. Put your pitchforks down and be reasonable.   EDIT: I'm already being down voted for this and I expected it. Be angry all you want. I'm not apologizing for the guy, I just think posting his personal information without taking a look in the mirror lowers you."
OCLions,3a9028,awol05,-10,Fri Jun 19 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"What happened in Charleston was a tragedy.  There is no question about it and I have a family friend who personally knows someone who passed away yesterday.  What happened last night in Charleston is domestic terrorism and I am very sad because of it.  Such a shame that in 2015 hate crimes still occur.   What gets me is the faux outrage over stuff like this to try and blame an entire fan base over the action(s) of one stupid individual on social media.  I get being upset at this podcast nerd and shaming him to the point he removes himself from social media.  This is a random individual however.  He is a jerk and obviously fancies himself a super fan who records a podcast no one listens to.  Why should Orlando City or any supporter club be held accountable for one immature/insensitive individual?  I can go line right now and join the 107ist.  Does that mean that this Portland Timbers supporter group is now accountable for my actions/behavior?  Are they supposed to do a background check and call on personal references? Orlando City is not a social media babysitting service for adults who support the club.  That is the part I don't understand.  Why are some of you trying to pin this on all 'Orlando City' supporters?  It is intellectually lazy and speaks to something much darker and nefarious than what 'theocroar' did in the first place.  That being trying to take advantage of a tragedy and the stupidity of one individual on social media to typecast an entire fan-base to bring down a club you personally don't like.    FYI, I have a good friend in the ILF and told me that they made a post on their private page informing their members that this person has been banned from all 'ILF' events for the year."
OCLions,3a9028,hngle_mccringleberry,15,Sun Jun 21 21:05:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's the fact that the ILF has let unruly behavior slide, and have even defended/deflected it in the past is why they have an image problem and everyone gets lumped together. I know there are good guys in the group, but the bad apples seem to have the biggest voice and the perceived support of the leadership."
OCLions,3a9028,thespickler,-7,Fri Jun 19 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"But do you understand how irresponsible that is? That is lazy logic and makes no sense.  We are not talking about a smoke bomb, or 'stealing' another SG gear.  We are not even talking about a fight associated with ILF members or something even related to an incident that occurred at a game.    We are talking about some inconsiderate fatso typing away at his laptop while eating cheetos at home.  He continues to be shamed publicly (and rightfully so) and appears to have been banned from the SG he is affiliated with.  Why exactly anyone would associate the actions of one lone maniac with an entire fan base or even a SG  with hundreds of members is not only irresponsible but is motivated by some really dark feelings of disdain towards of all things a sports team."
OCLions,3a9028,awol05,8,Thu Jun 18 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong, I'm with you on this. We have a great city with a passionate fan base, and as an unaffiliated STH  I hate that we all get lumped in these bad stories. But like it or not our supporter groups have the biggest voice for our fan base and they steer our perception. I really feel they need to work on their social media and PR departments. They need to focus on the good (like charities, community work, and the good time they have) and always publicly distance themselves from the bad"
OCLions,3a9028,awol05,-4,Thu Jun 18 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"But because the general public chooses to ignore the good work that they (ruckus & ilf) do and solely focus on the negative, what do you expect these supporters, who I imagine don't get paid, to do?  The Ruckus has an entire arm of charity services they do.  The ILF also volunteers at various NPO's based on what I have seen on their page.  They (ILF) raised over $1,500 for kids in Parramore just this past week.  None of this gets broadcasted because it just is not sexy to talk about and it does not get clicks.  I don't care for either supporter group because the are very high schoolish. You have to have been there for a while or you are almost an outsider.  That said lets not pretend they are these awful people that create a bad impression on all of us as OCSC fans."
OCLions,3a9028,OCityBeautiful,3,Thu Jun 18 19:49:15 2015 UTC,But the way they went about raising the money wasn't good. It started off as a pay coach heath's fine campaign. Then it switched to a kids in Parramore campaign after they started taking heat from the SKC supporters. Again more negative attention.
OCLions,3a9028,awol05,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:22:59 2015 UTC,I know first hand the money was always intended to go to the Orlando City Foundation. You really think every single person in the ILF doesn't already know Adrian Heath can pay his own fines?
OCLions,3a9028,OCityBeautiful,-2,Thu Jun 18 20:34:55 2015 UTC,So you are comparing an obvious practical joke to pay for Inchy's fine in which only morons fell for to this?  That is so lazy and lacks reason
OCLions,3a9028,ryeguytheshyguy,-8,Thu Jun 18 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"Look at the time this stooge wrote this. 'TheOCRoar' wrote his tweet at a time the facts were still coming out and details were vague.  My money is that this asshole was going back and forth with some other Charleston folks on twitter, saw news of a shooting briefly pop up on the news and wrote that inconsiderate tweet.    Unless this guy is a paid employee of Orlando City or an officer of the ILF, this is lowest common denominator outrage with dark motives."
OCLions,3a9028,thespickler,8,Fri Jun 19 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"ILF's response is lackluster to say the least.  A post on a private page and no real proactive messaging acknowledging that a MEMBER of their organization...and not just any member, but one who has been VERY public and often acted as an ambassador for ILF, is frankly not enough. I'm finding it hard to believe that ILF actually f'in cares what this guy did."

OCLions,3a8m0g,coachhawley,15,Thu Jun 18 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"I loved and hated this match all at the same time.  I appreciate the perseverance of, what I would call, Orlando's ""B"" squad, but the way they hung in as Charleston came back was fantastic.  However, some of the usual starters' performances was a bit troubling, but I'm not here to worry about the negatives.  Earl Edwards did a fantastic job, all things considered, and I thought that the younger group did pretty well."
OCLions,3a8m0g,misanthropicbuddha,3,Thu Jun 18 02:24:25 2015 UTC,"100% a ""B"" team, the only reason Boden and Avila were out there is because we don't have any backups for them. Ramos, Rivas, and Edwards really saved our asses"
OCLions,3a8m0g,logjam13,12,Thu Jun 18 04:59:21 2015 UTC,That was a batshit insane game.  Ramos looked like a star out there and Earl Edwards might have just gotten Donovan Ricketts cut next month.
OCLions,3a8m0g,pvdfan,11,Thu Jun 18 02:23:23 2015 UTC,Ramos looked like he was on another level than those guys. It was weird but awesome to watch. He dribbled past 3 or 4 guys to earn that penalty alone
OCLions,3a8m0g,jmoney0999,3,Thu Jun 18 02:33:50 2015 UTC,It was beautiful to see in person. And he was step for step matching their offense on his side of the pitch.
OCLions,3a8m0g,andrewthemexican,-6,Thu Jun 18 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"I think Ramos is very much at an MLS-reserve level of play already. He has cost us a game and struggled in some others, but even in the pre-season he was blowing past Charleston. If he can get his head on straight, he's just about ready to start for us consistently."
OCLions,3a8m0g,somanytictoc,9,Thu Jun 18 02:37:59 2015 UTC,Um... he does start for us consistently.  Hes only missed the game for the red card.. and U20s i think.
OCLions,3a8m0g,spikebaylor,-2,Thu Jun 18 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right. I think I incorrectly considered Collin, Shea, Hines, and St. Ledger as the key starters with Boden spelling Shea recently.   edit: based on downvotes, I'll remember never to humbly admit my mistake on Reddit again."
OCLions,3a8m0g,somanytictoc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:51:37 2015 UTC,He is MLS starter level I think just impressive meant it as that's how impressed I was he was that much better than everyone else on the field.

OCLions,3a8m0g,Scottydoesntknowyou,5,Thu Jun 18 02:21:09 2015 UTC,Charleston were lucky to have that many guys on the pitch to take those penalties.

OCLions,3a8m0g,randyc87,4,Thu Jun 18 02:30:27 2015 UTC,One guy straight pushed him. I thought that was crazy. If I was a red I would have carded every player that was yelling at me putting there hand in my face.
OCLions,3a8m0g,jmoney0999,6,Thu Jun 18 02:35:24 2015 UTC,Oh god that was stressful but what a match to watch! So glad we pulled away with the win
OCLions,3a8m0g,jambs,8,Thu Jun 18 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"I just want to say we had an outstanding SuperDraft.  Larin has been scoring in buckets, Donovan had some great plays tonight, and Earl Edwards was easily MOTM (as a 3rd round selection!!).  I can see it being a tough match for Luke on Saturday, that was draining.  We could put Shea back at LB to give him a breather but then either Rivas or Neal would be in the same situation... Proud of the boys on coming out on top.  Fingers crossed for Charlotte next round"
OCLions,3a8m0g,logjam13,2,Thu Jun 18 02:29:34 2015 UTC,Grantee its Rivas so a mixed bag.  But i think he could handle it of need be.  110 mins in and dude was still blowing past people on a constant basis.  If he could get the composure on run of play shots that he showed in PKs he'll be scary.  Thats a lot to ask for though.
OCLions,3a8m0g,spikebaylor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:41:12 2015 UTC,I think he just needs to get a couple from open play and then we may see him scoring semi regularly. I have a lot of faith that he can be special in this league if he starts putting everything together
OCLions,3a8m0g,logjam13,2,Thu Jun 18 03:57:31 2015 UTC,This game was like doing ayahuasca with Sepp Blatter.
OCLions,3a8m0g,mikesicle,2,Thu Jun 18 02:52:01 2015 UTC,Can we all agree that if we have the ball in the midfield and Rivas is remotely in the vicinity to immediately kick a through ball to make sure he isn't offsides? Man I know they don't play together often but Ribiero missed some big passes to Rivas where he would have been solo.
OCLions,3a8m0g,macaco_gordinho,3,Thu Jun 18 19:30:32 2015 UTC,"I'm hyped about the win and all, but I was shocked at how many B-listers we started tonight. If we're going to take U.S. Open Cup seriously, then we need to start a lineup that doesn't concede 4 and force us to go to PKs. Starting St. Ledger would have been an improvement, and playing Collin wouldn't have been crazy.  I know the counter-argument: ""we're playing 4 games in 11 days right after international duty!"" In that case, perhaps we find a way to keep our backups from gassing themselves for 120+PKs in the South Carolina summer heat.   I'm not one to say we should have had Kaka, Shea, and Larin in this match, but if we're worried about conserving energy, this was a crappy way to do it. Let's sub out heavily during the Rapids game in a week when it REALLY doesn't matter."
OCLions,3a8m0g,somanytictoc,3,Thu Jun 18 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"If we didn't have such a busy schedule right these two weeks, plus so many out because of Intl Duty he would have played more of the primary roster."

OCLions,3a822g,nautika,10,Thu Jun 18 01:42:18 2015 UTC,I'm extremely surprised he didn't miss any of them. I think the lack of goalline stands to kick the ball into is helping Rivas

OCLions,3a822g,secretlyadog,3,Thu Jun 18 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"It probably has something to do with playing 4 matches in 11 days more than the fact that it's USOC. The starters have to rest sometime. Considering the next two are against Montreal and Colorado, I would have expected a few more starters in tonight, though. Montreal shouldn't be terribly tough, and Colorado is both terrible and an out-of-conference road match. Probably a good time to pull guys early."
OCLions,3a822g,somanytictoc,2,Thu Jun 18 02:32:23 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing that gets me.... the final qualifying spot for the playoffs last year went to a team (Sporting KC) who only won 14 matches, and tied 7. Year before that Montreal with 14 wins and 7 draws. Year before that it was 14 and 11 ties.  My point is we only need about 10 more wins to qualify for the playoffs and we've got 20 games to get them.   One US Open Cup loss is the end of our tournament. Just one. Let's go all out."
OCLions,3a822g,secretlyadog,2,Thu Jun 18 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that the extra playoff spot means we probably need FEWER than 14 wins to get in, especially in the weak East. We're not Supporters Shield or MLS Cup contenders this year, but we are a pretty good team. I think we can make a deep run into the USOC this year. I'm certain that the next round will be full-strength against a likely MLS side."

OCLions,3a822g,wonder_chicken,3,Thu Jun 18 01:03:45 2015 UTC,Rivas really needed to put that one away.  Burying a PK and putting in another goal shortly after would have done wonders for his confidence.

OCLions,3a822g,5heepdawg,3,Thu Jun 18 02:17:16 2015 UTC,"Took me a while to find this but I'm glad I did. Time to vent. I know it's an open cup game and people are going to react differently to the line-up and formation but, holy shit is this hard to watch. Couple things off the top of my head before we begin overtime:  1) Every second day I watch Carlos rivas play, the more I dislike him. He had his health issues in the beginning but I look at him as a faster long tan. We all remember long tan. Dude was a waste of a spot up front. Just watch the offsides trap and he'd be a monster.  2) Connor donnovan might be my hero. An American Lion-- they don't get much better than that. I need a poster of him to replace one of my 7 brek Shea pictures. But really though, he plays well and had a good couple appearances in New Zealand.  3) What's with Harrison Heath? Played tonight and against Vancouver I think.. Just don't like his game. Sully fouls and ever worse plays on the ball.. Idk how I feel about it fully but I need to watch him more.... And the rest of this game."
OCLions,3a822g,updog4sale,3,Thu Jun 18 01:32:29 2015 UTC,Rivas can be infuriating but he is the most dynamic player we have up front.  If he can calm down in front of goal and put shots away like he takes PKs he's going to be amazing.  I dont want to take all of the blame from rivas' offside but we are always 2 secs too late with those long balls and through balls.    Heath has looked pretty bad today.  But the other times he's come in its been pretty decent.  Certainly not starting quality but potential is there.
OCLions,3a822g,spikebaylor,2,Thu Jun 18 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said, its very exciting to see Connor Donovan playing so well. With Rivas, I agree its tough to watch such unrealized potential, but at least he did well on those PK's"

Oh well, so sad...."
OCLions,3a6b69,macaco_gordinho,5,Wed Jun 17 16:33:40 2015 UTC,The whole point of privately funding the stadium is so the club has control and can do what is best for the club and fans.

OCLions,3a6klw,beerinthedark,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:48:53 2015 UTC,"Unreal, ive seen a few yellows given for other teams hamming it up out there while we were pressing hard at the end, have we only received warnings or actually gotten carded for it?"
OCLions,3a6klw,QuietFlight86,4,Wed Jun 17 20:56:29 2015 UTC,First game we had 3 yellows for it.  They were all bad yellows.  We aren't worse than any of the other MLS clubs but we have an unjust reputation for it.
OCLions,3a6klw,beerinthedark,5,Wed Jun 17 21:41:30 2015 UTC,We've had four yellows for simulation that i remember.  Maybe one more.  However the more i watch other MLS games im convinced we dont do it anymore than most teams.  Also other than Rivas i dont think anyone dives on purpose on our team.

OCLions,3a3o87,logjam13,7,Tue Jun 16 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"Really curious to see who gets game time and who gets a rest. This competition really should not be at or near the top of our priority list. We have a good current league position, but Toronto and NYRB have multiple games in hand and are 1 and 3 points behind us respectively.  I think Kaka and Shea should both sit, which is pretty obvious. I think Higuita should sit (Okugo and Estrela midfield pair) as well. I'd also like to give Ramos a rest (not sure who 2nd string RB is) along with Tally (Ricketts back in for this match).  If we win, great, another opportunity to get some guys some match fitness. If we lose, that's one less thing to distract/tire us for the rest of the MLS season."
OCLions,3a3o87,great_gator_bait,4,Wed Jun 17 02:42:30 2015 UTC,"Tyler Turner should be starting at RB.  Personally, I'd like to see Conor Donovon and Earl Edwards get some first team minutes."
OCLions,3a3o87,pvdfan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:33:33 2015 UTC,Agreed. Being in Conor for Collin. Let him have a rest as well as he's still coming back from that hamstring strain. Is rochez back ? Because I would love for him to get a start up top.
OCLions,3a3o87,jmoney0999,2,Wed Jun 17 04:42:36 2015 UTC,Heath said Rochez won't play tomorrow even though he's back

This is not just an opportunity to get some match fitness. I think this tournament is high on Heath's list of priorities for multiple reasons.   And, on a grander scale, making this tournament more competitive can only be a good thing for American soccer."
OCLions,3a3o87,jmoney0999,3,Wed Jun 17 12:01:49 2015 UTC,I think you have to find that right balance of a very competitive team but still resting the right guys. Especially since we have a Saturday and Wednesday match so soon after.
OCLions,3a3o87,Semco14,5,Wed Jun 17 12:15:46 2015 UTC,Kaka posted a photo to Instagram that makes it appear he stayed back in Orlando and is not with the team.  Could he fly up in the morning?  https://instagram.com/p/4Ate9LMY8V/?taken-by=kaka

OCLions,3a4osi,jmoney0999,2,Wed Jun 17 14:17:42 2015 UTC,Can we just be done with this nonsense please
OCLions,3a4osi,j_andrew_h,4,Wed Jun 17 05:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yes Please!  OCSC Fans, we have to let Dwyer go.  There is very little to no chance he's coming back here and he was never ours to begin with.    That being said, it would be funny as hell if the first player we sign if/when we launch a NWSL team in a couple years is Sydney Leroux.  You know, just for fun."
OCLions,3a4osi,catch_th3m_all,6,Wed Jun 17 12:47:51 2015 UTC,Haha that would get the SKC fans' blood running! I hope we can get a NWSL franchise in the next couple of years!
OCLions,3a4osi,j_andrew_h,4,Wed Jun 17 14:19:18 2015 UTC,I do think it would be great to have a NWSL team here once the MLS club is on further solid footing with the new stadium and hopefully continued great crowds.
OCLions,3a4osi,catch_th3m_all,4,Wed Jun 17 16:04:26 2015 UTC,For real. Once the stadium opens I'll make any excuse to go there. Last time the USWNT played in the citrus bowl they had a solid turnout.

Sometimes it's hard to quantity how well defenders play, but Collin was absolutely insane.  I'd love to see the stats on how many balls he won yesterday.   Anyways, great week for Florida soccer. OC grabs a win and the Armada FC comes back in a big way to end the match in a 3-3 draw."

OCLions,39v2nt,Widan,17,Mon Jun 15 01:28:08 2015 UTC,Great win tonight. The back line was outstanding and Kaka played a great game. Ribeiro played well but I definitely still prefer Larin. Bottom line is this team has found 10x better form since Brek was moved to midfield and Boden (who has been a consistently impressive performer) was inserted at back.
OCLions,39v2nt,HalaUnited,10,Mon Jun 15 01:23:49 2015 UTC,Once larin comes back if like Pedro to slot into RW for awhile.
OCLions,39v2nt,jmoney0999,5,Mon Jun 15 01:32:41 2015 UTC,I'd love Pedro at RM.
OCLions,39v2nt,j_andrew_h,9,Mon Jun 15 02:22:45 2015 UTC,"Kaká did not play a great game. I watched via the English feed, and they counted 15+ turnovers from the Brazilian. Not to mention how incredibly lucky he was to have the keeper parry the ball right back to him for that poorly taken PK. That makes like 3 PKs he's had saved this season (counting re-dos).  I'm not sounding alarms yet, but I'm just trying to be realistic and honest. He gave away nearly every ball he played. He had a very sub-par performance."
OCLions,39v2nt,spiegro,6,Mon Jun 15 09:24:34 2015 UTC,"Kitchen was really good last night at stepping into the passing lanes and cutting things off for Kaka and others.  My concern on the turnovers were that they were almost all soft passes that would have been fine if they put enough on them to get them to the target quickly.  Overall though, I liked that Kaka was trying to be a little more offensive for himself as well as create for the team.  He was very involved last night which I why I rate him pretty well; but not great for last night."
OCLions,39v2nt,j_andrew_h,3,Mon Jun 15 13:19:36 2015 UTC,"Kaka played one of his better games. He has turnovers, yes, but that is because he tries to create. He is by far our most creative player. Without Larin up top, a guy who can create for himself 1v1, Kaka had to word harder to create chances. Kaka also put several mid range shots on target which is something OC has struggled with all year. While I may have overstated his performance by deeming it great he did play a good game and I don't think we would be getting the quality results that we are without him."
OCLions,39v2nt,HalaUnited,3,Mon Jun 15 10:57:34 2015 UTC,"I think you have a point here. I saw some lazy passes and turnovers, but I also saw them from everyone else in the second half. In any case, he's still the best player on the field and creates quality chances."
OCLions,39v2nt,Myfrienddanny,7,Mon Jun 15 11:17:27 2015 UTC,His presence alone draws defenders and opens up chances for everyone else. But that's why it's so disappointing when he's off.
OCLions,39v2nt,spiegro,2,Mon Jun 15 11:27:28 2015 UTC,And he was all over the field...  He does much better when he is playing higher up the field in the Center...  But he kept swaping in an out with Shea (which is fine a few times) and kept dropping way to far back.  Saw him routinely as far back as RB and LB... especially towards the end of the game.    He always does better when he plays his ACM role and sticks too it...
OCLions,39v2nt,daguru9,17,Mon Jun 15 12:16:12 2015 UTC,"Collin for MVP!  Seriously, we have a lot of great players, but Collin is insane. His vertical leap is nuts and I swear he teleports around the field."
OCLions,39v2nt,Owtlaw1,9,Mon Jun 15 01:26:46 2015 UTC,"Collin and Ceren have been my favorite players sonfar this season.  Ceren's only draw back has been those couple lapses of judgement with fouls in the back.  Otherwise he's been really solid.  Hines and St Ledger did well when Collin was out and ill feel safe enough with them there but Collin certainly steps the entire back line up when he's in.  Just magnificent work rate and clutch tackles, saves, and air dominance.  We really missed him for those Columbus goals."
OCLions,39v2nt,spikebaylor,9,Mon Jun 15 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Fantastic game from all, especially the back line. Hall had a couple of great saves. There were a few sloppy passes in the midfield, and I missed Larin at the attacker position. Overall, a great win against the top team in the league."
OCLions,39v2nt,TheGeneral11,3,Mon Jun 15 01:40:18 2015 UTC,Ribeiro does a number of things well; but he doesn't have the speed to play up top really.  We had a couple nice through balls which we don't always even try for some reason; but Pedro just didn't have the pace to get to them 1st.      I hope that Ribeiro moves over to RM when Larin is starting and we go with him and Shea on the wings.  That could be dangerous!!!!
OCLions,39v2nt,j_andrew_h,5,Mon Jun 15 13:22:40 2015 UTC,I would just like to say... our defensive mid is ridiculous.  Ceren and Higuita have been playing fantastic.  Neal played solid today.  Behind them we have Okugo and Heath?  I wouldnt be afraid to have any of them on the field.    Defense isnt much worse.  Our normal back line is pretty solid.  Hines i think is an even change for St Ledger.  Shea could always slot it for boden if need be.  Turner isnt quite as good for Ramos but i think he will be once he's had more experience at this level.  It'd be nice to see donovan and redding get some time.. or at least get down to louisville.  Our offense could really use a shot of something this summer.  They're not terrible they're just missing something to spark some movement in the final third and someone besides just Larin to be able to convert these chances.
OCLions,39v2nt,spikebaylor,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:58:11 2015 UTC,Cerén wasn't playing today. Avila was.
OCLions,39v2nt,Widan,5,Mon Jun 15 02:18:29 2015 UTC,I know.. im saying in general.  And Avila played his normal RM.  Neal played for Ceren.
OCLions,39v2nt,spikebaylor,3,Mon Jun 15 02:20:57 2015 UTC,Oh. Cerén is great. I can't wait to have him back from duty.
OCLions,39v2nt,Widan,8,Mon Jun 15 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"Just got home.   No Ceren and no Larin is definitely noticeable. Hope they finish their international duty soon. Collin is a beast. Was a little frustrated that the stadium didn't show a replay of the foul leading to our PK, but props to Hamid for actually saving a PK from Kaka of all players... only for Kaka to score off the rebound. Kaka and Ribero are too slow on breakaways. Losing 9 points would have been inexcusable. To be honest though, I was expecting a stoppage time bullshit equalizer. Thank goodness that didn't happen."
OCLions,39v2nt,LazyKenny,3,Mon Jun 15 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"Ceren and Larin will be back, but then will be gone for most of July for the Gold Cup.  We will be losing Shea and possibly Rochez for the Gold Cup as well."
OCLions,39v2nt,daguru9,2,Mon Jun 15 12:12:51 2015 UTC,I don't think they ever show relays of fouls in the stadium. For fans it sucks because we either miss what actually happened or in the case how close it was to be in/out of the box. But it makes sense for officials because there would be a riot if it showed opposite of what the ref called
OCLions,39v2nt,nautika,3,Mon Jun 15 13:36:54 2015 UTC,This is the reason I rock a Collin shirt every game!
OCLions,39v2nt,all_ears_over_here,3,Mon Jun 15 03:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not really understanding this ""put Ribiero at RM"" argument here.  1) It's like he's playing in slow-mo with weights tied around his ankles  2) He couldn't hold the ball up at all against the United CB's.  The kid played badly. Putting him at RM is setting us up for failure. No chance will you see Ribiero tracking back to defend. None the less defend well."
OCLions,39v2nt,Vyndetta_,6,Mon Jun 15 21:57:12 2015 UTC,I went to the post game press conference. The players were celebrating hard and coach was super pumped. Good to see. Heath said Neal was his man of the match by far.
OCLions,39v2nt,KubaBVB09,8,Mon Jun 15 02:15:13 2015 UTC,that game was so worth enduring that heat and suffering through summer allergies to see city win in person and celebrate with the rest of orlando!!!
OCLions,39v2nt,Thestinger777,2,Mon Jun 15 03:39:34 2015 UTC,Absolutely!
OCLions,39v2nt,j_andrew_h,4,Mon Jun 15 13:21:29 2015 UTC,Is it me or does Kaka always go left for his PK's... I'm pretty sure he's been found out now
OCLions,39v2nt,MicroRobo,4,Mon Jun 15 04:18:56 2015 UTC,Almost always low left.  He does need to switch it up a bit.
OCLions,39v2nt,spikebaylor,2,Mon Jun 15 12:20:25 2015 UTC,I'm calling his next one will be right down the middle.
OCLions,39v2nt,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 15 13:21:09 2015 UTC,He's gone straight down the middle as well. but I agree that he favors left.
OCLions,39v2nt,macaco_gordinho,2,Mon Jun 15 13:28:18 2015 UTC,This is correct. I was actually thinking he went right but i went back and looked them up. 5 pks so far. First against Portland went down the middle. The last 4 have all gone left.
OCLions,39v2nt,Gilffanclub,6,Mon Jun 15 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"Ribiero is too slow. I don't like Larin's clumsy feet, but at least he's quick and doesn't put himself behind defenders."
OCLions,39v2nt,Widan,6,Mon Jun 15 01:27:29 2015 UTC,When larin gets back id like to see ribiero at RM.  He's notnfast but he's smart and sees the game well.  But having him and Kaka up front to chase down those few good long balls is never going to work.
OCLions,39v2nt,spikebaylor,7,Mon Jun 15 01:46:40 2015 UTC,Ribeiro moves like an adolescent giraffe at times
OCLions,39v2nt,buddadabaptist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:26:50 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing one great long ball and screaming out loud, ""we need someone with more pace up front!"""
OCLions,39wqgv,daguru9,2,Mon Jun 15 12:47:19 2015 UTC,I hope for his sake that he can come in and make a good showing on the field.  I can't see him staying with the club through the transfer window if he hasn't been able to really play.  I feel for him for sure; but we can't afford a roster spot for a guy that just can't ever seem to get/stay healthy.
OCLions,39wqgv,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 15 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"I agree.  From the little bit o remember seeing him im pre season i thought he did decent.  He could be another possible RM.  However,  that position is pretty deep at the moment but none of them are really starting calibre.  I think RM is our biggest weakness right now.  Its killing us considering how well Ramos does on that side but just doesnt get much help from Avila.  I know Heath has said ideally he'd like to bring in a defender, midfielder, and forward in the window.  Id say we dont need a defender.  Our defense is adequate IF the offense can keep posession the way we have AND create and put away chances.  RM is the big one but id love another striker.  Larin has done great, but i dont know if he should be our starter just yet.  Also we should be looking for an understudy for Kaka.  Maybe that person is Ribeiro.  If not, we desperately need someone that can play that role.  I know he hates being subbed off, but he is noticeably gassed in the last 30mins of most games.  He still pushes and does his best, but not sure its enough.  He could also probably use a week off.  Also he could get injured at anytime."
OCLions,39wqgv,spikebaylor,2,Mon Jun 15 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I think in priority order here are the positions we could see this summer: * Forward * Right Mid * Center Back     I only think Center Back because I think Heath would like to loan Donovan and Redding to Louisville if that's possible.  If he did, he would probably need another experienced CB for depth at a minimum.  Probably not a high ticket defender or anything but just another MLS veteran or ""Championship"" level player like Hines & St. Ledger."
OCLions,39wqgv,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 15 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Just throwing my two cents: *RM: A more dynamic RM is needed. Avila is good, but need someone more dynamic and more of an attacking threat... *Fwd: A forward with some experience and to provide depth *CB/LB: Need more backup that can cover CB and LB; with Shea heading to the Gold Cup, will leave only LB  A RM and Fwd are really important, would free Ribeiro up to be a proxy Kaka and fill that role, giving Kaka some rest.  UNLESS they can find another skilled ACM.  The man is going to need some rest..."
OCLions,39wqgv,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:41:18 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought about LB, but yes we might need a defender that can cover both CB & LB (not at the same time obviously).    I'd like to see Ribeiro get some time at RM as well once Larin is back and yes, he's probably the best sub for Kaka; though I can't see us playing the 4-2-3-1 without Kaka and Molino.  I would have imagined Molino in that CAM role if Kaka was out; but I don't know that we can play that formation without a true CAM."
OCLions,39wqgv,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"I was surprised they wanted to move Molino to RM... I thought they would want him to spend this year learning from Kaka and sharping his skills and experience at CAM.  Over the next three seasons give him more and more time, ask Kaka gets older.  This way Molino could have been the primary by year 3 and future when Kaka's contract is up...  But what do I know... certainly can't predict what Coach Heath does :)"
OCLions,39wqgv,logjam13,2,Mon Jun 15 17:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think that Molino could have learned from Kaka while playing on the Right.  He played there for his first few years so it should have been good for him.    I'd love to see Molino bulk up just a bit while he's rehabbing his knee and study, study & study some more.  He could come back even better next year."
OCLions,39wqgv,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 15 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, needs to add some muscle...  Funny, same thing most people said about Dennis Chin in the past."
OCLions,39wqgv,logjam13,2,Mon Jun 15 17:42:48 2015 UTC,"I doubt we pick up a 4th CB. The 3 we have now have been great and there just isn't room on the roster for a backup backup defender on high wages. As it is, if everyone sans Molino is healthy, we need to actually ship out one more than we bring in. If loans count we could make that happen.   I think definite outs: One of Paterson/Mwanga, a keeper  Loans: Estrela, Rochez, One of Donovan/Redding  Potential outs: Okugo now that he's slipped to 4th choice in central midfield and he doesn't want to play in defense. Might be able to get something solid for him. Cascio since he can't stay healthy. Rivera just as a casualty of being in a stable of promising young strikers  Who we bring in is going to be pretty simple. We need a backup to Larin and a starting quality winger. I'd like to see us bring in a young left fullback as an understudy to Boden, but that would signal the end of the Shea experiment there"
OCLions,39wqgv,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:55:21 2015 UTC,"I agree overall and I'm mainly looking for a Forward and a RM.  I think if we grab a forward it would be someone who likely should start over Larin.  Larin has been better than I thought he'd be at this point, but he's still learning and has never played anywhere near this number of games before.  He's better suited at this point to coming off the bench and getting starts in Open Cup games and such.  I still think he is the future for sure; but if we're going to have a strong 2nd half and better yet compete in the playoffs; we're going to need a confident, strong and experienced striker.  That was supposed to be Paterson; but unfortunately for him and us, he just hasn't' been able to stay healthy nor show anything on the field so far."
OCLions,39wqgv,logjam13,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:33:14 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a big name come in and start but I don't think it's necessary or even the best course of action. Competition for Larin could help but I think playing time is good for him and he's playing really really well. We run the risk of him dropping out of form but I guess it depends on where the FO wants to invest. I'd rather see a better RW and a backup striker personally
OCLions,39wqgv,Generalparks,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:13:51 2015 UTC,Fair points and I think it also depends on where they see Rochez in training.  We haven't seen much of him.  Do they think he'll be a contributor this year or not?  I'm okay with sticking with Larin if we have two other decent options to sub in and such when needed.

OCLions,39v9qj,misanthropicbuddha,3,Mon Jun 15 02:17:55 2015 UTC,It's hard for me to give the subs fair ratings. I rated them all this time but sometimes I don't. Like Harrison for example. He just deserves an N/A. He wasn't in long enough to warrant a rating.
OCLions,39v9qj,jmoney0999,2,Mon Jun 15 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"Fair play to your point.  I know my system isn't perfect, but I like to think that a rating can be attributed to any length of performance.  For example, what if Harrison came on and scored a goal or had a nice set-up to a goal, then I expect he would get rated from everyone.  I'm confident that example was poor, but I'm too tired to think of anything else at this time. lol"

OCLions,39mta8,accdodson,-2,Sat Jun 13 15:07:11 2015 UTC,I honestly didn't know if the MLS had a policy against this. I don't think they do in. Europe but as we know our league is nothing like there's. That being said since MLS does have the rule then that was textbook tampering something Heath may not have honestly been aware of.

OCLions,39ltp4,calvinandsnobs,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:23:14 2015 UTC,I think changing the starting lineup was the smartest thing Adrian Heath has done.
OCLions,39ljcg,daguru9,6,Fri Jun 12 16:04:06 2015 UTC,That sounds great! we need someone to sub in when Larin gets tired!
OCLions,39ljcg,roborooter0,3,Fri Jun 12 19:46:22 2015 UTC,I don't think he would be okay with a substitute role. If he was okay with that he would just stay at arsenal.
OCLions,39ljcg,jmoney0999,3,Fri Jun 12 20:31:27 2015 UTC,I was mostly joking because Larin is having a fantastic year. at the beginning of the season i felt like our forwards were the weakest link but Larin/Ribero made me eat my words.  p.s happy cake day!

While Poldi has a cannon for a left foot, he's lazy as hell and has been in a downward spiral the last 3 seasons. That money could be better spent on other players. Just my opinion of course."

To see what Coach Heath, Phil, Paul and Flavio have cooking!  Also, sorry if this is a dumb question I'm new to the transfer market model. Can teams set up deals in principle before July 8 to complete that day or do they have to wait to make calls etc.?"
OCLions,39ljcg,J_Bone007,3,Fri Jun 12 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"Within MLS it is ""not allowed"" between teams but not enforced such as the Tally Hall trade.  As for signing players from elsewhere, they can have deals ready to go ahead of time and even announced to the public."
OCLions,39ljcg,pvdfan,3,Fri Jun 12 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"I believe they can, they just may not publicly announce them... especially if it is with another MLS team.  Paperwork could not be submitted to the league for approval prior to the start of the season."

OCLions,39l1wh,daguru9,5,Fri Jun 12 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"Agree with the #clickbait comment.  The media coverage is a blessing and a curse.  It is tough to complain about injuries too much but Pato was the guy that was supposed to contribute this year.  I had no expectation that Larin or Rochez would be on the field at all or if they did - it would have been for Louisville.  I had marginally higher expectations for Rivas but again - injuries made that difficult.  Just tough for an expansion team with limited depth to deal with.  The club chose to forego the waning European Star Designated Player route  (looking at you NYCFC) and went the YDP route.  Aside from Pato, those guys were always going to take a year or two to get to where they were comfortable in this environment.  At the end of the day, OCSC is in the playoff hunt with those guys playing the way they're playing.  Not bad for an expansion team.   Those thoughts don't drive web traffic though."
OCLions,39l1wh,mcg1848,3,Fri Jun 12 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"It's not that. Its the constant noise from people on reddit, twitter, fans at games. I get complaining about your team losing. But most people prob have never played a team sport and understand how important chemistry and having an understanding of what each other is doing matters to a game. A good example is the way they have played in the past 4 games. While they haven't won each of those games, the chemistry between players is better."
OCLions,39l1wh,daguru9,5,Fri Jun 12 14:48:35 2015 UTC,Not to mention the various injury and fitness concerns that are not mentioned at all in the article...
OCLions,39l1wh,jmoney0999,7,Fri Jun 12 14:29:44 2015 UTC,I agree man. It's so frustrating to hear fans boo them at games and bash them on here and everywhere else online.   These guys have no family here no friends. Probably had barely watched the MLS before they came and if you watch a lot of soccer you know how different the game is in different leagues and MLS is no exception. On top of that they are 20-21. Rivas especially has shown flashes of brilliance. If he just netted one of his opportunities against Columbus his confidence would skyrocket and all the fans would be singing his praises. If they are still struggling by this time next year then we have something legitimate to talk about.
OCLions,39l1wh,wonder_chicken,0,Fri Jun 12 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"yeah american sport fans are bad. But other countries fans kinda the same. For example, Stoke fans chant ""You don't know what you're doing"" towards the ref when they think they've made a bad call. I'd love to be more like Barca as terms of fans...miss a shot on goal, clap. Make a good play, clap. miss an opportunity, start chanting about going after the other team more aggresively.  Instead we get Boos and ""Ref you suck"""
OCLions,39l1wh,mikesicle,2,Fri Jun 12 14:54:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I have to completely disagree. First of all, a lot of the refs do suck. MLS is notorious for that. You can't make this lame argument that the MLS refs don't have any friends here in the US, and booing refs is not like booing your own team at all. They're clearly not part of our team. Secondly, if a young guy getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to play a GAME can't handle fans booing, then that player simply doesn't have enough mental fortitude to be successful. Call me harsh, call me a ""bad american sports fan"" but I think your entire argument in this thread is awful. MLS is not little league backyard soccer where everyone gets a trophy for participating and mom serves up orange slices. MLS is a grown ups sport, deal with it or go play somewhere else. We all want the best for our team and when 2/3 of our DPs don't live up to the hype we get disappointed. How the hell else would a rational person react?"
OCLions,39l1wh,j_andrew_h,0,Fri Jun 12 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"What did you think would happen with people who don't speak the common language moving to a new country and trying to build chemistry in a few months would achieve? Did you expect to be in leading the way for the Supporter Shield?   As for the booing, that's something I don't care for and has nothing to do with how the players feel about it. You think booing your team who your are there to support helps motivate them to be better?   And for the refs, hearing fans say ""Ref you suck"" is tacky and classless in every sport. You get out there and make a split decision while also being questioned and yelled out for your decision.   And I have no idea what you were reading but I read your comment and felt it had no merit in what the discussion was regarding."
OCLions,39l1wh,daguru9,5,Sat Jun 13 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"Rivas looked better in Chicago, Rochez hasnt played enough at all. Id love to see Rochez given more time this weekend."
OCLions,39l1wh,j_andrew_h,2,Fri Jun 12 16:23:56 2015 UTC,I think we'll see a bit of Rochez this weekend. Pedro will likely start up top with Larin gone; but we'll need to sub in a striker in the 2nd half.  Hopefully Rochez can continue his confident U20 WC and get things going here.
OCLions,39l1wh,catch_th3m_all,2,Fri Jun 12 16:51:13 2015 UTC,I think he could get some time... unfortunately Rochez will only be here a few more games before he leaves for Gold Cup (assuming that he is called up)
OCLions,39l1wh,Lauxman,5,Fri Jun 12 17:13:10 2015 UTC,I think if things had gone to plan with Paterson taking the early season load off the young strikers things would have been so much different for these guys.  But that didn't happen and they were forced in earlier than Heath would have otherwise.    Both Rivas & Rochez are going to be good if not here then somewhere else; so let's try to make it here!
OCLions,39iahy,jmoney0999,4,Thu Jun 11 22:20:58 2015 UTC,He scored in the 4th minute with a nice 1v1 finish on the keeper

OCLions,39jcxg,sledge_hand,3,Fri Jun 12 04:20:09 2015 UTC,I don't think there was much of a chance of us getting Dom back anyway; but it's probably pretty much a done deal that we won't now.
OCLions,39jcxg,j_andrew_h,3,Fri Jun 12 11:06:03 2015 UTC,I've never seen a professional head coach openly covet another team's player like this.

OCLions,39jcxg,BLB34,2,Fri Jun 12 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"Might have made it more difficult, but SKC already knew how much OCSC wanted to bring Dom back.  Heck, Vermes said they we have asked as far back as 2 years... which means they tried to get him for the final USL Pro season, so they know how bad OCSC wants him and have turned down every offer so far.  It would have to be a deal that is ""too good to be true"" to get him away from SKC right now and probably something alot more than just money.    I think the only hope that OCSC has is waiting until Dom's current contract is up with SKC and try then..."

OCLions,39fzxr,abellwillring,5,Thu Jun 11 13:50:02 2015 UTC,"Ceren, Higuita, and Okugo are clearly ahead of him in the depth chart.  Any apparently so is Harrison Heath, since Heath played in the AAPP game, while Estrela was the only sub who did not play that game.  I think he would have been sent to LCFC on loan if not for all of the injuries and International Duties."
OCLions,39fzxr,daguru9,2,Thu Jun 11 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"Right, that much is clear.. but I was curious if anyone actually had any insight as to why they are ahead of him. Has he had issues with his attitude, homesickness, etc. or is it just Adrian thinking they're better suited (all are older so they certainly have more experience at a minimum). Is he actually training with us at all?  Ramos and Estrela's transfers were a little bit unusual (Benfica fans refer to them as loans) so I wonder if there is some sort of issue on that end that prevented him from going out to USL. It's obviously doing no one any good for him to not play at all."
OCLions,39fzxr,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:26:09 2015 UTC,I've heard them called loans as well; but I think that Benfica has the right to a free transfer at the end of the contract if they want them (1st dibbs).  With him playing at the U20's maybe we'll get an offer or two for him that would give him a chance for more playing time and free up an international spot for us.  I like him; but we are so deep at that position currently.
OCLions,39fzxr,jmoney0999,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:48:56 2015 UTC,From what I saw of him in the preseason his first touch was poor and his decision making isn't fast enough for our league yet. That being said I watch him in the u20 match he started and he looked good at that level.   As far as ceren higuita and okugo go they are all above average cdms so getting in front of them on the depth chart would be hard for anyone

I would love to have Dom back in purple but there's no reason to ship Larin off when he's been so promising and effective"
OCLions,3997x3,logjam13,8,Wed Jun 10 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"This is a no-brainer for me. You just don't trade away a guy who has been as good as Larin has been with as much upside as he has. Dom Dwyer is a great player, but trading Larin for him would be a mistake."
OCLions,3997x3,Popcornshrimpeater,3,Wed Jun 10 11:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah if we made that trade we'd have to cut a bunch of guys just to make room for Dom's contract, including other promising young players. Not worth it for what could be the same (or lower) output"
OCLions,3997x3,logjam13,7,Wed Jun 10 12:12:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. We need this young talent to grow under Inchy's leadership
OCLions,3997x3,Epcot92,4,Wed Jun 10 12:36:43 2015 UTC,Rochez for Dwyer: yes Larin for Dwyer: no  :)
OCLions,3997x3,daguru9,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. More experience, and he belongs in Orlando, plain and simple. I think Larin is an excellent player don't get me wrong, but Dwyer would provide the exact push we need as a team, and bring even more love to the team, especially from fans who had watched him play with us back in the day."
OCLions,3997x3,Squiggyrocks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:00:38 2015 UTC,"In the same show this sparked from, Heath spoke of the potential of the younger players. You can't deny Larin's potential. He's already improved so much in just the past few games."
OCLions,3997x3,TrevenxD,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I suppose you're right. That's the problem, get rid of extremely promising talent, or get who feels right."
OCLions,3997x3,Squiggyrocks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:52:42 2015 UTC,or get rid of the bounty of other strikers we have and keep Larin
OCLions,396tfu,daguru9,4,Tue Jun 9 17:52:03 2015 UTC,I can't wait. The owners of Black Cauldron have been in the Ruckus since the first season and are awesome people.  They've been providing us with beer at the tailgates for years.  I wish them all the best.
OCLions,396tfu,beerinthedark,3,Wed Jun 10 02:04:13 2015 UTC,Very cool. It'll be interesting to see if any other businesses pop up as a result of the new club.

OCLions,38wvos,Owtlaw1,5,Sun Jun 7 14:59:55 2015 UTC,Man that Larin goal was nasty. The view from behind shows the curve. Awesome
OCLions,38wvos,jwcook2,7,Sun Jun 7 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this man, I was just about to post it as well.  I do wish there was a better angle on that save by Hall at the end. Also does any one know why we've been playing Hall instead of Rickets?"
OCLions,38wvos,Harry_Kane,13,Sun Jun 7 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"Hall was signed to be our primary goalie. However he was injured so we brought in Ricketts. Since hall is now fit to play, he's taken back his spot in the starting 11. Ricketts filled in well but hall is much more commanding and better keeper overall."

OCLions,38v5z3,logjam13,17,Sun Jun 7 02:43:12 2015 UTC,Adailton is your Orlando City SC Man of the Match for the two crucial own goals needed for your lions to pick up three points.
OCLions,38v5z3,LazyKenny,9,Sun Jun 7 02:35:17 2015 UTC,I hope Adailton isn't on your fantasy team
OCLions,38v5z3,wonder_chicken,3,Sun Jun 7 02:50:33 2015 UTC,I retired from fantasy after beating Amarikwa last year.
OCLions,38v5z3,LazyKenny,18,Sun Jun 7 02:52:36 2015 UTC,Chicago scores 4 goals and loses 3-2.  I love soccer.
OCLions,38v5z3,pvdfan,17,Sun Jun 7 02:35:23 2015 UTC,17 points puts us tied with NYRB.   Larin has really been good lately hasn't he? Coming along well.
OCLions,38v5z3,logjam13,9,Sun Jun 7 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"Ahead on goals scored, too. 4th in the East!"
OCLions,38v5z3,wonder_chicken,9,Sun Jun 7 02:38:17 2015 UTC,4th in the East......that feels good to say
OCLions,38v5z3,Whitegoldteeth,9,Sun Jun 7 02:52:40 2015 UTC,Makes my cock feel like concrete...
OCLions,38v5z3,werdx,5,Sun Jun 7 03:28:42 2015 UTC,What a difference a game makes!
OCLions,38v5z3,spikebaylor,12,Sun Jun 7 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"Clearly we need larin and ribeiro on the pitch at the same time... As much shit as rivas gets... He made that last run beautifully.  neal doesnt make that run, avila doesnt make that run.  he has the talent and brain... He just needs to get over the nerves."
OCLions,38v5z3,zrowny,8,Sun Jun 7 02:45:19 2015 UTC,I really want ribeiro to start over avila. Would be a beautiful front four with Larin Shea Kaka Ribeiro

OCLions,38v5z3,jmoney0999,8,Sun Jun 7 02:47:43 2015 UTC,So happy about the win ! And don't even consider getting two own goals lucky in this case because they both would have been actual goals if they weren't own goals. Ribiero would have had the first and Larin would have tapped in the second.   And Rivas with the perfectly timed run that led to the GW was a thing of beauty
OCLions,38v5z3,jambs,4,Sun Jun 7 03:42:30 2015 UTC,What a glorious comeback! VAMOS!

OCLions,38uqzw,spikebaylor,6,Sun Jun 7 02:21:40 2015 UTC,I hope the Boden/Neal bromance is in full force because having neal and avila in mid is like the kiss of death for our offense.  shame both pato and rochez are out.  id rather see larin up top and ribeiro on the right... But then there is no one to replace larin when he is inevetibly out of gas at the 60 min mark.

OCLions,38uqzw,spikebaylor,2,Sun Jun 7 01:05:07 2015 UTC,We are playing way to centrally and trying to force balls through the center. Both Neal and Avila playing like inverted wingers isn't helping either. We need to add width to our game.

OCLions,38uqzw,spikebaylor,2,Sun Jun 7 01:12:33 2015 UTC,"Am i or crazy or are we terrible at passing despite our crazy pass completion stat?  97% of our passes are standing player directly to standing player.  rarely do we make good runs or lead the player.  because of all that we telegraph our passes like crazy.  i know where the ball is going to go long before the pass is made... Obviously so does the other team as we've been getting picked off more and more each game.  Also Kaka may be the worst passer on the team as of late.  i love kaka and if we can get that guy who played the first few games id be happy, but after watching giovinco the last few weeks i feel like we're not getting the same output and its frustrating."

OCLions,38uqzw,ASIWYFA,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:40:09 2015 UTC,I think we suffer from lack of pace up top.
OCLions,38uqzw,wonder_chicken,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"We do at times.. Particularly kaka and boden arent the best for chasing down through balls on the left, but if you watch most times we come down the field and everyone just kinda stands around to the point where the guy with the ball routinely overlaps the entirety of the front line... And then has no help and no option but to drop it back yet again."

OCLions,38uqzw,logjam13,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"That could have been much worse with how off the entire backline looked.  Not sure if it's Collin or what, but a ton of communication errors."

For the team benches, they are in front of the club level with the home in front of 132/133 and away in front of 135/136.  As to where to sit, it depends on if your traveling with the supporters or not.  If you are with them, the seats are on the Plaza level in sections P02 or P03 (can't tell which).  If your traveling without them, anywhere on either sideline (131-137 or 105-111) or the Plaza level.  Here is a map for reference on the section numbers."

OCLions,38ryau,zrowny,3,Sat Jun 6 20:29:08 2015 UTC,No go on autographs in the stadium as the walls are too high and security/police can be real dicks about being on the rail.
OCLions,38ryau,j_andrew_h,2,Sat Jun 6 20:36:49 2015 UTC,I've heard that they'll sign autographs right after the game if you catch them coming off the field in the south end
OCLions,38ryau,secretlyadog,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:13:11 2015 UTC,I can confirm this. Hang out a good while after the game around the south west end.

OCLions,38ryau,secretlyadog,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we've sat at the north end and gotten autographs. I'd say it is just a matter of timing."
OCLions,38ryau,laser-TITS,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:45:43 2015 UTC,this is patently false. people in my group have gotten autographs after the DC game and the vancouver game.
OCLions,38ryau,manelandjeff,3,Sun Jun 7 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"Either park at the stadium or somewhere downtown. I wouldn't park anywhere in between because it's not the best neighborhood.   If you park downtown, the furthest West you'd want to go is by the Amway Center (Division/Hughey Ave.). Its only 1 mile away so you can walk back with the crowd after the game.  EDIT: forgot my east and west"
OCLions,38ryau,pvdfan,5,Sat Jun 6 15:15:07 2015 UTC,"There are also free shuttles between Amway Center and the Citrus Bowl before, during and after the match. They congregate at Church and Nashville, about a block east of the north end of the stadium, during and after the match."
OCLions,38ryau,manelandjeff,2,Sat Jun 6 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"For away fans, there is away tailgating behind a building on the walk from the buses to the stadium with a police presence for security."

OCLions,38ip2a,74656638,4,Fri Jun 5 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I voted for both of them.  I also voted for Bill Hamid after he was the only guy DC needed on the pitch in their visit here."
OCLions,38ip2a,jmoney0999,3,Fri Jun 5 12:06:43 2015 UTC,That was my thought process exactly. Even if the match against us was the only match he played all season I would have voted for hamid. We should have had at least 3 goals that match.
OCLions,38kpjv,SurfingLion14,4,Thu Jun 4 21:06:42 2015 UTC,They held a large full team autograph session at the Open Practice before the season.  If you go to the area where the players exit after the game most of the players take a few minutes or so to sign autographs.  We did this last Saturday and got 4 players autographs and they were all very kind to the fans.
OCLions,38kpjv,j_andrew_h,3,Thu Jun 4 21:59:21 2015 UTC,Where is or out of the stadium is that area?
OCLions,38kpjv,pvdfan,2,Thu Jun 4 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"The players exit out of the Southwest corner of the stadium. There was a small crowd of fans and we got autographs from Ribeiro, Boden, Collin & Ceren. We just missed Shea, Avila & Larin. It takes a while for them to come out, but the players were cool."

OCLions,38kpjv,EASports_MUT,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:22:01 2015 UTC,Season Ticket holders had the opportunity before the beginning of the year to sign up for this as a benefit. Personally I selected the final season game (home vs NYCFC).
OCLions,38kpjv,puto_ergo_ego_sum,2,Fri Jun 5 15:37:13 2015 UTC,I did this as well. It was marketed as better than it actually is.   The session is only with one player and you don't know the player before hand. And you are only allowed to get one item signed.   Very disappointed.
OCLions,38kpjv,EASports_MUT,2,Fri Jun 5 18:03:43 2015 UTC,Whaaaaaat? That's not what they promised!
OCLions,38kpjv,puto_ergo_ego_sum,2,Fri Jun 5 18:09:02 2015 UTC,Not at all. I was very disappointed when I got the email. I will be emailing someone about it because it was basically false advertising. They made it sound exactly like what op is asking about.
OCLions,38kpjv,EASports_MUT,3,Fri Jun 5 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I remember correctly they mentioned doing an autograph session with the team; not with only one single player."

OCLions,38j8m3,daguru9,5,Thu Jun 4 16:11:45 2015 UTC,I don't know how I feel about college soccer. I feel that academies produce much more quality players than college will in the future. Yes good players have come from college but imagine these players if they had been in quality academies instead.
OCLions,38j8m3,macaco_gordinho,2,Thu Jun 4 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I think if they move to year-round schedules that it will be better. Players from the ages of 18-22 probably can't get much playing time in MLS or NASL, college allows them to develop and get an education in case soccer doesn't work out. The only negative is not training with the pros but with our U23s they come back from school and OC still gets to work with them. Take one of our more promising academy strikers, Gorka Aperribay, who'll play for UCF starting in the fall. He wouldn't get any play time with us or with Louisville, so why not go play every week for the Knights? We can still sign him as a homegrown at any time or he can get picked up in the draft"
OCLions,38j8m3,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:53:14 2015 UTC,Not all those people who play sports in college go for all 4 years. Larin did only 2. Everywhere else in the soccer world does acadamies for developing talent. College is not the answer for this sport. I would rather have the talent develop against the best the sport has to offer than who may or may not go to college here in the US.
OCLions,38j8m3,macaco_gordinho,3,Thu Jun 4 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"I think major league baseball has shown that either approach can work.  The problem is that NCAA soccer isn't structured correctly right now and the rules need to be changed to reflect the pro game (e.g., limiting substitutions) and increasing practice time."
OCLions,38j8m3,74656638,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:39:54 2015 UTC,People who play college ball still go and play in AAA ball leagues for clubs to improve their play. I don't mean all do but I'm sure that it happens often. Just because we have a system that exists does not mean it is the best suited for the sport.
OCLions,38j8m3,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:11:37 2015 UTC,"On a case for NCAA, many of those college baseball players end up at a higher level of the minors than high schools pick."
OCLions,38j8m3,pvdfan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:43:16 2015 UTC,But they are still in the minor leagues which begs the question whether an academy would be better than college.
OCLions,38j8m3,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"But you can't declare for the SuperDraft as an underclassman. The only way you can get out is signing a professional contract and in Larin's case MLS had to go find him. College is for the players who don't get contracts out of high school and the guys who don't have academies. There aren't enough 2s teams in USL or other options for young guys to get playing time, which is really what makes better players. I think it can be a good outlet for players who need/want more development once it starts adhering to FIFA rules"
OCLions,38j8m3,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:05:25 2015 UTC,Larin was drafted No 1 in the SuperDraft and watched while in full gear at UConn.
OCLions,38j8m3,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"Right, he was 1/4 of Gen Adidas underclassmen. Everyone else in the draft was a senior. But Larin's old club, Sigma, plays in Canada's 3rd division. If there was no college ball what would he have done? Get picked up by Toronto and maybe get loaned out? He'd probably be behind Hamilton on their depth chart. Keep playing for Sigma and not get paid?"
OCLions,38j8m3,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:38:08 2015 UTC,I get that for Larin it was a better deal and more exposure. I'm saying that improved academies would be good for MLS. I think in 10 years academies will produce really great quality talent. The rest of the world uses academies and look at the talent it provides
OCLions,38j8m3,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:15:27 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I would love it if we, and the rest of MLS, could keep great talent in-house. But I think the college game is instrumental in development in the U.S. And Canada as long as there are only ~40 academies for tens of thousands of players"
OCLions,38j8m3,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:25:35 2015 UTC,It's not something they fix overnight. But with college you only play against people in your conference mainly. If teams in that conference are weak you don't get good experience. Plus it's all about money with the NCAA. Look at football and basketball. Is it really going to be the best development for these people? Besides now major teams in Europe are developing academies here too. There is a lot of stuff involved. I just think that an academy player will develop better than a college player. Of course there are always exceptions.
OCLions,38j8m3,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I'm not denying that college soccer has a low standard. I'm just saying that playing time for guys not good enough for the pro level outside of high school is vital. The game will need to grow before the NCAA takes it seriously and the best prospects won't take route. Neither option is perfect but - as it stands - college is the only option for the majority of young players and I think easier to fix by expanding the seasons/budget than having every pro club and some amateur clubs create academies"
OCLions,38j8m3,logjam13,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:43:46 2015 UTC,"Would help if the Futile could get the coach's name correct.  It's Bryan Cunningham, not Bill."

OCLions,38jrql,pvdfan,4,Thu Jun 4 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"This was an old chant that was modified at the request of the front office.  It was the same reason that we no longer chant ""You suck Asshole!"" during goal kicks.    Both groups are working to clean up the chants, but some in the crowd still use the old lyrics with the word retarded.  I get the need to be PC, but this clearly an overreaction.  The whole song is being ditched for that reason.  Move on...Nothing to see here."

OCLions,38jrql,daguru9,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"I guess some of their other/older chant sheet sites use the word ""retarded"" instead of ""disregarded""...

OCLions,38jrql,pvdfan,3,Thu Jun 4 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"We definitely use ""that shit's retarded"" in the actual chant in the Supporter's Section. The chant sheet (at the game) says ""that's disregarded"". But I don't think this was done after a specific complaint about ""retarded,"" just that all of the lyrics are censored to a point. For example, ""no me gusta puto Rowdies"" in ""Best Friend (?)"" is written as ""no me gusta bobo Rowdies."" Don't have one of the sheets in front of me but I think there are other examples as well"
OCLions,38jrql,daguru9,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:51:19 2015 UTC,I sat near the support section and you really can't understand them unless you are prob sitting in the area.

OCLions,38jrql,Banthrau,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:45:27 2015 UTC,Not sure about the supporters section but on the north side it IS difficult to hear you.  so if one person picks it up but says OC! OC! Then everyone starts getting it wrong cuz they cant clearly hear the supporters.  there are a few of us who try to be as loud as we can and say it correctly but both there is a generous amount of people who participate in that chant incorrectly and drown us out.

OCLions,38fgbm,Mojo141,4,Wed Jun 3 22:18:25 2015 UTC,Ive ordered my cards from eBay. I got the entire Orlando City set for like $5 shipped which is like 9 cards or so.

OCLions,38cvrz,daguru9,9,Wed Jun 3 12:03:08 2015 UTC,"Drogba wanted 8 million over a 6 month span, not worth it if you ask me. It would have been nice to land him but not if it means we have to be poor. Now Dwyer, that I wouldn't mind (not that I wouldn't mind having Drogba's expensive ass) and I've heard Orlando was doing their very best to acquire him, even though KC seems reluctant to lose him."
OCLions,38cvrz,Whitegoldteeth,3,Wed Jun 3 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"I dont think that is worth it for anyone. Id love to have him up front, as I would almost any big name player, but a wage demand like that makes it easy for me to get over him."
OCLions,38cvrz,mikesicle,2,Wed Jun 3 13:12:50 2015 UTC,I can't think of any MLS team who would be willing to spend that kind of money on a player for that short amount of time.

OCLions,38cvrz,Ebraam101,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, or NYC. Their pockets are pretty fat too. But 8 mill for 6 months? I just don't see that happening right now."
OCLions,38cvrz,Whitegoldteeth,10,Thu Jun 4 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"Another log to add to this campfire... with the fan push for OCSC to start an NWSL team in a few years, who would be a good player to build that team around?  The other have of soccer's power couple: Sydney Leroux...  If OCSC could eventually being both to Orlando, the city might burn down..."
OCLions,38cvrz,wonder_chicken,9,Wed Jun 3 13:59:31 2015 UTC,"And now my ultimate soccer fantasy includes the idea of Dom and Sydney both playing in Orlando....thanks for that.   Seriously though, I hadn't heard about the possibility of a NWSL team here. Is that a legit rumor? how can I help make this happen?"
OCLions,38cvrz,Triig,4,Wed Jun 3 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing solid from the club, more of a push coming from the fans... although I think Phil said they consider it or look at the possibility, but was kinda wishy washy on his response if I remember correctly."
OCLions,38cvrz,pvdfan,2,Wed Jun 3 15:07:07 2015 UTC,They're gonna have a whole SSS to themselves soon - it'd be real nice if they had another team to play in it consistently. They'd be silly not to seriously consider a women's league.
OCLions,38cvrz,Triig,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:09:51 2015 UTC,"If they want to triple up, work with PDL and NWSL to plan U-23 and Women's matches on the same day for double headers.  Gives them over 2 hours of extra concession sales and the U-23's a real big time feel."
OCLions,38cvrz,Generalparks,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:49:49 2015 UTC,Heeyyy now that's an idea. Make it an add-on option (low cost though) for OCSC season tickets and bam theres your attendance.
OCLions,38cvrz,logjam13,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:41:48 2015 UTC,I would start the fire because that would be amazing.  Make it happen Phil!
OCLions,38cvrz,macaco_gordinho,13,Wed Jun 3 14:00:34 2015 UTC,$8m over 6 months would be over double Kaka's wages. There are only a few players in the world who I would say are worth that and Drogba sure as hell isn't one of them
OCLions,38cvrz,Generalparks,4,Wed Jun 3 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the headline was a little miss-leading, OCSC didn't offer Drogba $8 million, that is what he was asking for.  But either way, no way he is worth that to us..."
OCLions,38cvrz,UFmegood,2,Wed Jun 3 13:57:35 2015 UTC,headline is saying that OC was offered Drogba for 8 million. Not that they offered 8 mil for Drogba
OCLions,38cvrz,jmoney0999,5,Wed Jun 3 17:32:26 2015 UTC,What we would all give to see Dom back in purple.  Don't blame SKC for not wanting to give him up but sharing is caring.  I wouldn't mind overpaying a bit for him just because of what he means to the club.  I'm glad they didn't over pay for Drogba.  8 million for a 6 month contract is just insane.
OCLions,38cvrz,UFmegood,5,Wed Jun 3 13:40:22 2015 UTC,No mention of the Podolski rumors? Think he could be massive for OCSC.
OCLions,38cvrz,Tigrafr,5,Wed Jun 3 16:08:23 2015 UTC,I mean his thing is finishing. And that's honestly been our top problem. Imagine how many goals we would have if we had poldi to finish all the clear cut and half chances we have created.
OCLions,38cvrz,pvdfan,2,Wed Jun 3 16:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. And he strikes the fear of god into keepers as well. Besides putting away the obvious chances he's quite capable of scoring from odd angles, long distances, seemingly out of nothing.  Keeping a keeper back on his line when you're 30 yards out opens up a whole world of possibilities for runs into the box since he knows he'll get beaten if he comes too far out."
OCLions,38cvrz,EASports_MUT,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:49:07 2015 UTC,Podolski could be one awesome news :)
OCLions,38cvrz,74656638,5,Wed Jun 3 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"I love Dom and all, but there are better strikers that can signed from elsewhere in the world.  No reason to give Sporting KC the world for an emotional connection from two years ago."
OCLions,38cvrz,EASports_MUT,3,Wed Jun 3 14:51:03 2015 UTC,Sporting is in the perfect position: they have something we want. Either we'll have to shell out buku bucks or something drastic at SKC will have to happen before we can acquire him. Dom's been too good for SKC to just let him go for anything less than top dollar+.
OCLions,38cvrz,dannon20,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:34:07 2015 UTC,"Just for the record, that's ""beaucoup."" :)  And while I'd be ok with a slight overpay for Dom, I wouldn't give away the house for him, especially if we can make a European star like Podolski happen."

OCLions,38d64q,daguru9,6,Wed Jun 3 13:25:39 2015 UTC,"I never thought it was favoritism.  Based on his youth career and some of the talent he flashed in limited appearances, it was clear that he was being signed on potential.  I figured he'd spend the whole year at Louisville, obviously they may happen once the whole team is back together and (hopefully) not injured, but I'm not the least bit upset about Harrison getting a contract but Rob Valentino not getting one."
OCLions,38d64q,74656638,3,Wed Jun 3 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"I too thought he'd spend most the year at Louisville, but I can say I'm happy to have been proven wrong. I hope he keeps improving."
OCLions,38d64q,wonder_chicken,5,Wed Jun 3 15:00:58 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't remember many if anyone complaining about him being signed. Anytime we saw him he flashed some skill and is very composed. If he was in the super draft he would almost certainly have been a first round pick.
OCLions,38cvu6,daguru9,8,Wed Jun 3 12:03:42 2015 UTC,"The title had me at ""nachos."""
OCLions,38cvu6,misanthropicbuddha,2,Wed Jun 3 14:40:29 2015 UTC,Hard to argue with that list.  All 10 of those are really good reasons but the beer and food upgrades are a big plus.
OCLions,38blyz,Semco14,5,Wed Jun 3 04:05:17 2015 UTC,I'm happy with what he said about Rivas. Everyone saying the Rivas experiment has failed and whatnot are jumping ship way too fast. I can't imagine how he feels.  He got in good positions and all it would have taken is slightly better finishing and he would have had 2 goals and everyone and there mother would have been saying he is an amazing signing.
OCLions,38blyz,jmoney0999,2,Wed Jun 3 13:25:56 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree with you. My favorite part was when he talked about Rivas and how it's way too early to be attacking one of our own. Really hoping this weekend he can put one in the back of the net and boost his confidence.
OCLions,38blyz,Whitegoldteeth,2,Wed Jun 3 15:49:18 2015 UTC,Right? Like the rest of the team was on fire at the beginning of the season.
OCLions,38blyz,spikebaylor,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:17:06 2015 UTC,Exactly. I love molino as much as you but he has equally as good chances and couldn't finish either so they both just need time to settle down and build that confidence. If Rivas would have scored on either of his chances his confidence would skyrocket and we would see the player that we've been waiting for.
OCLions,38blyz,jmoney0999,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:28:50 2015 UTC,Word. I love Rivas.
OCLions,38blyz,catch_th3m_all,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"Good recap, thanks for sharing!"
OCLions,38blyz,_froy20,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:49:38 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to hear Heath by himself in the DJ booth, sleeves rolled up, sweating, changing records and railing against the refs. But this is good too."
OCLions,38bi5p,misanthropicbuddha,5,Wed Jun 3 03:35:29 2015 UTC,"He certainly deserves critisism both for missing opportunities and for the dives, but does no one see Rivas' potential?  I share the same view as the article from city soccer talk.  While he did miss a bunch, he created a lot of chances that otherwise would not have happened.  Once he gets into a rhythm and calms down a bit i bet he turns things around and starts burying those.  Dont forget the entire rest of the team went through that period where we couldnt put anything on target too.  I think there is a huge upside to a rivas/kaka/ribeiro midfield.  The flopping on the other hand REALLY needs to go or ill drop any support for him.  I thought our team was done with that nonsense.  Hopefully he has learned his lesson."
OCLions,388zhj,daguru9,3,Tue Jun 2 18:03:59 2015 UTC,Out for the DC United match and the US Open Cup Fourth Round vs Charleston.  Thankfully Paterson and Ribero are back to where we can easily deal with his loss.  Best of luck to him and Canada against Dominica.
OCLions,388zhj,pvdfan,2,Tue Jun 2 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Paterson can take advantage of this opportunity.  If not, I don't see his loan being made permanent if they have a chance to sign another striker. Unfortunately for Paterson, he was injured a the time that we needed him most and now Larin is at least fairly settled into the starting role; so Paterson will need to show something strong these next couple of games if he can."
OCLions,388zhj,j_andrew_h,3,Tue Jun 2 19:18:32 2015 UTC,"yeah i'm hoping (yet again) to see Ribeiro start on the right with Paterson up top.  Because I agree, Paterson needs the chance to truly prove himself if he's going to stay.  If he can get in there and really make a difference then maybe we move along with him.  If not, I can't see him staying on with Heath wanting to bring in another Forward in the summer."
OCLions,388zhj,spikebaylor,2,Wed Jun 3 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  He has the chance to own that spot but he has to grab it now.  If not the club is going to get someone else and since Pato isn't young and is on loan he'd likely go.  That being said, I seriously think he can do it he just needs to get into the rhythm and get it done."
OCLions,388zhj,j_andrew_h,3,Wed Jun 3 00:46:52 2015 UTC,"If there are any truths to the Lukas Podolski rumors and OCSC can secure a loan for him, then I don't think they will sign Paterson (he would be a free transfer, since his current club is not renewing his contract, so he would be a free agent)..."
OCLions,388zhj,macaco_gordinho,5,Wed Jun 3 12:06:32 2015 UTC,No more chest goal shots for a while
OCLions,388zhj,j_andrew_h,3,Tue Jun 2 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"The 1st one was pretty creative as it was likely his only play on the ball and he was really close to goal.  The try this weekend he wasn't in the right position to even try that.  If he didn't' have a direct shot, then he could have chested it down to his feet and he still had a chance."
OCLions,388zhj,SoulOfDragnsFire,2,Tue Jun 2 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"Aww, but who will fill in to kick field goals?"
OCLions,388zhj,spikebaylor,8,Tue Jun 2 18:26:12 2015 UTC,Rivas has been practicing pretty hard.  He's almost to the point where he can make it over from two feet away.... just hit the post though.
OCLions,388zhj,lostmimic,3,Tue Jun 2 18:32:15 2015 UTC,As long as he stays on his feet you mean!
OCLions,388zhj,pvdfan,3,Tue Jun 2 19:37:50 2015 UTC,Give him a few weeks and he will dive so fast that the ball itself jumps over the goal for a field goal.

There are some kid related activities next to the stadium before the game and if you tailgate you'll see lots of people playing Corn Hole and other tailgate games.  During the soccer game there isn't much going on other than the game itself that would hold their attention if the game doesn't.    That being said, the games are a lot of fun and there is so much energy in the stadium that it's pretty fun for everyone.  You may want to buy them the game day magazine inside the stadium ($10) as it will give them lots to look at and there are a couple pages of kids activities in there with a word find game and a game to find the differences between two pictures."

OCLions,3844ml,pvdfan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:32:45 2015 UTC,That I do not know because I was in my seat the entire time. I'm sure you could exit the Citrus Bowl during half-time and let the kids play soccer in the small area surrounded by inflated walls.
OCLions,38408z,daguru9,3,Mon Jun 1 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"We're growing, and with a young team there will be issues here and there. But this team works hard and I always see improvement, call me optimistic. I have high expectations for us as the season continues."
OCLions,38408z,Whitegoldteeth,2,Mon Jun 1 18:47:47 2015 UTC,"I agree and pretty soon we'll see if a few guys can get a little more settled in (Rivas, Paterson, Rochez coming back from the World Cup).  It also looks like we'll get one or two players in the summer. I'm not expecting a big name signing (though it would be great obviously); but a couple quality players at key positions (Right Mid, Forward & maybe Center Back)."
OCLions,38408z,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 1 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"Very true, I feel like it's only a matter of time before Rivas settles in, along with Patterson. Rochez, well he seems to be on track to becoming a real threat. I know we have that guy from Hamburg, Germany on loan but he has yet to have any playing time. Also, why is Heath benching Collin? He's healthy... I thought that guy was a wall for our defense. Not arguing with Heath's decision, just a little confused."
OCLions,38408z,Whitegoldteeth,2,Mon Jun 1 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"Listen to the soccer cast that they do at harry buffalo on tuesday, it gives some very good insight into the coaches mindset.  He didn't play collin because he didnt want to force him back when we have st ledger and hines playing so well. He also wants players to know that no starting position is guaranteed and they all need to play well to be in the starting lineup."

OCLions,38408z,Whitegoldteeth,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"The player from Hamburg was a trialist and ultimately wasn't signed is my understanding.  As for Collin, he had a hamstring injury and though he could have played this weekend; they felt it would be better to give him an additional week if possible.  The good play of St. Ledger in Collin's place gave Heath the confidence he could take a better long term approach to Collin's health and be cautious.    I expect to see Collin starting again in the next game next to Hines assuming both are healthy."

OCLions,382r0b,daguru9,4,Mon Jun 1 12:58:59 2015 UTC,This makes me wonder what is going with Ramos and Portugal.  Estrella has not seen a competitive minute since last September and gets a call-up while Ramos is left off.

Not sure who took his place, but Estrela is only one of 4 players on the roster playing outside Portugal and the only one outside Europe. Maybe that has something to do with it?

OCLions,380kfa,logjam13,5,Sun May 31 23:31:25 2015 UTC,Cyle Larin also called up for Canada's World Cup qualifiers and will miss the DC match on 14 June
OCLions,380kfa,blou10,8,Sun May 31 23:35:12 2015 UTC,Ribeiros return couldn't come at a better time. Also can't forget he was our starting striker. Good to have him back for sure.
OCLions,380kfa,secretlyadog,-14,Mon Jun 1 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"Fuck you, entire country of Canada, you fucking cunts.   Can we hire Jose Mourinho on a one time basis to complain about national team call ups for us?  Also... it is really strange as an American soccer fan not feeling aggrieved at club coaches griping about releasing their players.  I completely understand now. LEAVE ORLANDO CITY ALONE!"
OCLions,380kfa,Whitegoldteeth,3,Mon Jun 1 00:09:37 2015 UTC,"It is what it is. I'll still be expecting a win, let's go!"
OCLions,380kfa,ImSteveDave,3,Mon Jun 1 01:14:05 2015 UTC,What's up with all the hate for our players getting called up? Sure it's inconvenient that our league doesn't take international breaks but we should be applauding the fact that we have international talent on our roster.
OCLions,380kfa,secretlyadog,3,Mon Jun 1 17:29:26 2015 UTC,Dammit

OCLions,380krx,LiamLiamLiamLiam,5,Sun May 31 23:34:05 2015 UTC,Not one of those angles prove it did or didn't completely cross the line. But I guess this is as good of an angle that we have for review.
OCLions,380krx,nickwilk22,3,Mon Jun 1 00:21:44 2015 UTC,"exactly, none prove it one way or another.  We can all see what we want to see in these; but nothing definitive from this angle."
OCLions,380krx,j_andrew_h,5,Mon Jun 1 03:10:22 2015 UTC,It really does not look like the ball went all the way across the line.
OCLions,380krx,LazyKenny,4,Mon Jun 1 00:08:56 2015 UTC,"I sit almost right on the goal line (section 139) and it looked from where we were that the ball crossed over.  If it didn't get 100% over than it was only by a fraction.  Goal line technology would be a good step for MLS in the future so there aren't these questions one way or another.    Regardless, Orlando City squandered far to many other goal chances to worry about this one too much... We had the perfect opportunity to take down a good team playing a man up for nearly the entire game; we have to get all 3 points in those situations."
OCLions,380krx,j_andrew_h,4,Mon Jun 1 03:09:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's not like we wasted 14 corner kicks or anything.  We just have to finish."
OCLions,380krx,thisguy9,3,Mon Jun 1 06:04:34 2015 UTC,Exactly!
OCLions,380krx,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Jun 1 14:27:59 2015 UTC,Not having Brek Shea was the big problem. He seems to be far more effective up front.
OCLions,380krx,manelandjeff,3,Mon Jun 1 14:08:05 2015 UTC,There were a couple plays where Shea would have made the correct pass had he been there; but we also have to be able to play without him since he'll be coming and going playing for the national team.
OCLions,380krx,j_andrew_h,4,Mon Jun 1 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"Appears as if the ball did not cross the line completely, but there was not one clear angle, unfortunately."

OCLions,37ylpj,mcn11,15,Sun May 31 14:29:59 2015 UTC,"Many Crew fans look at Seattle as their rival because Seattle ""stole Sigi"" and Seattle fans couldn't care less about them. Crew fans also love to complain about how tough they have it as a small market team.  I respect The Crew as a team, and I agree with your points, I just don't want to give them the satisfaction of us caring so much about two games to call them a rival."
OCLions,37ylpj,Whudevs,4,Sun May 31 14:57:50 2015 UTC,"The amusing part is that 99.9% of Sounders fan don't care in the slightest about the crew. It almost has a ""that's nice, go away"" dismissive feel to it from the Seattle perspective."
OCLions,37ylpj,planetes,3,Sun May 31 17:11:04 2015 UTC,But the crew are from Columbus in Ohio. Are you thinking of the Fire? Which are in Chicago.
OCLions,37ylpj,Mutinet,-1,Sun May 31 15:09:39 2015 UTC,Small market team? I did a quick Google search and and it seems they've got about 3.5x as many people living in Columbus as live in Orlando....sounds like excuses to me.
OCLions,37ylpj,yus333,6,Sun May 31 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"That is completely incorrect when talking about markets. A market is the entire Metropolitan Statistical Area, or MSA. So for Orlando it would be the City of Orlando, plus all of the rest of Orange County, Seminole County, Lake County and northern Osceola County. The Orlando MSA has something like 2.2 million people. The Columbus MSA has just over 3 million people.   The City of Columbus may be 3.5 times the size of the City of Orlando, as only about a tenth of the Orlando MSA population lives in the City of Orlando, but both MSAs are pretty comparable and considered small market"
OCLions,37ylpj,DELIVERER407,0,Sun May 31 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"that makes sense, but I would be curious to know the distance that people are actually traveling to go the games. Statistics may count all of those areas, but that doesn't mean people are coming from all over to the games. They may for Orlando, but not Columbus kind of thing. I'm just saying, you shouldn't be complaining about being ""small market"" when a smaller market can fill a stadium and you can't. Especially considering the average stadium is approximately 20,000 people and the market is at minimum 100x that. Its not like they're playing out of Akron haha"
OCLions,37ylpj,ibribe,3,Sun May 31 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"I had a few fun little scrapes with some crew fans at last night's game. Nothing physical, but we were bantering each other pretty hard. I'd say fuck em especially if I hear the: name more than 3 people on your team bullshit."
OCLions,37ylpj,whtge8,4,Mon Jun 1 02:55:30 2015 UTC,They are certainly out in front of the rest of the field as far as I'm concerned.  I'm looking forward to getting another shot at them at home on 8/1.

OCLions,37x9qt,SenorTacoman,10,Sun May 31 04:08:34 2015 UTC,"5 yellows and a red for Columbus.  But according to the match thread, Columbus are...hold on, cramp...a shining beacon of...hold on, cramp...sportsmanship. The ref just...hold on, cramp...hates them."
OCLions,37x9qt,DemonSpeed,3,Sun May 31 13:23:30 2015 UTC,"Dont forget about them forgetting to play soccer by forgetting how to throw the ball in, kicking it back into play and the fundamental kick-off. All of the yellow cards were 100% fair and deserved."

OCLions,37wsym,coachhawley,29,Sun May 31 01:32:50 2015 UTC,The Rivas experiment has failed.
OCLions,37wsym,secretlyadog,8,Sun May 31 01:41:33 2015 UTC,"Hardly.  Yes, he takes too many shots and yes, he spends too much time on the ground.  But he's barely played 300 minutes (3.33 full matches) in a new league in a new country.  He's created more chances per 90 minutes than every player minus Kaka and Boden.  He needs to be better, but to say he's failed is a little dramatic"
OCLions,37wsym,logjam13,3,Sun May 31 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"He gets into very dangerous positions, where he  [1] shoots way off frame - 82%   [2] falls shamefully to the ground - 18%"
OCLions,37wsym,secretlyadog,2,Sun May 31 04:56:48 2015 UTC,i think you're missing the fact that hes the fastest player on the field and that he created a chance that probably should have netted him a goal(if he were a better finisher).
OCLions,37wsym,Wheaties466,0,Tue Jun 2 18:24:16 2015 UTC,You don't want to be the team with the really fast players who can't finish.   Those aren't the teams lifting trophies.
OCLions,37wsym,secretlyadog,0,Tue Jun 2 19:37:57 2015 UTC,you can't teach speed.
OCLions,37wsym,Wheaties466,2,Tue Jun 2 20:18:56 2015 UTC,Why are we bolding things and downvoting each other?
OCLions,37wsym,secretlyadog,2,Tue Jun 2 20:21:52 2015 UTC,He averages 30 minutes per match. He was the leading scorer for his club last season. He gets into position more than most of our guys and he plays 1/3 of the minutes. He's capable of double digit goals and he's only 20
OCLions,37wsym,logjam13,4,Sun May 31 05:59:08 2015 UTC,"Rivas may be a solid player in MLS some day but he sure isn't right now. 30 minutes  a match seems about right. For a ""goal scorer"" his finishing was horrid tonight. He's just not good enough yet, IMO."
OCLions,37wsym,PickerTJ,2,Sun May 31 06:20:28 2015 UTC,"His finishing was just as good as Larin's tonight.  Neither could beat Clark 1v1.  I'm not saying he's going to score willingly, but that he needs more of a chance than some fans seem to be giving him.  He missed most of preseason and several weeks with injury, he'll need more time to adapt and more play time before we can really compare his productivity to our other attacking players"
OCLions,37wsym,logjam13,4,Sun May 31 06:38:05 2015 UTC,I'm surprised every time I remember he's a designated player. Then I weep.
OCLions,37wsym,njunk,14,Sun May 31 02:11:27 2015 UTC,Rivas hasn't proven much. Waste of a DP spot so far. People are claiming the keeper went past the line on that goal but we also got lucky with that very questionable PK.
OCLions,37wsym,burajin,10,Sun May 31 02:06:31 2015 UTC,"Very cool to hear that ""Orlando....City"" chant on mls live, it was insanely loud. Lets give Rivas some time; he has played what, 400 minutes? Hardly enough to call him a failure. Flopping has gotta stop, but his well timed runs and above average combination play are why he had so many opportunities to miss."
OCLions,37wsym,ChemE_nolifer,2,Sun May 31 04:47:53 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more with the cheer. That was my first game in Orlando and the atmosphere was incredible for the size of the crowd and the circumstances for most of the match. That cheer in particular stood out and it was almost instinctive for everyone in the stadium to participate. I can't wait to go back again.
OCLions,37wsym,Myfrienddanny,11,Sun May 31 17:41:36 2015 UTC,So can we all agree that Pedro needs to be starting at right mid next match. That was a damn rocket.

OCLions,37wsym,logjam13,10,Sun May 31 01:39:58 2015 UTC,"I was at the game, right behind the goal, and that was a blatant walk in goal off that corner. Can't wait to get home, rewatch it, and scream at the ref once again."
OCLions,37wsym,Owtlaw1,4,Sun May 31 02:07:45 2015 UTC,It was interesting to see that side blow up while we sat confused in the supporter section then exploded once we saw the replay.  That was so blatant too.
OCLions,37wsym,thisguy9,1 point,Sun May 31 05:19:33 2015 UTC,weird it wasn't in any of the highlights or replays.
OCLions,37wsym,Wheaties466,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:27:42 2015 UTC,Probably because they don't want the MLS to look like fools by not having something standard to most sports like goal line technology.

OCLions,37wsym,xx_rudyh_xx,5,Sun May 31 01:37:39 2015 UTC,That whiff in the second half...
OCLions,37wsym,WaffleAndButter,4,Sun May 31 01:49:02 2015 UTC,I feel like that one corner towards the end was in when their keeper stepped back but Ill need to see it from a better angle. Im so glad they pulled the tie off though
OCLions,37wsym,WhiteWilliamHaynes,5,Sun May 31 01:37:57 2015 UTC,"Disappointed in the result, it seemed as if we were very complacent when they went the man down and didn't realize the situation until we were a man down. Nonetheless we still salvaged a point."

OCLions,37wsym,Generalparks,7,Sun May 31 01:59:56 2015 UTC,[1] Team lost any bite in the 2nd half. Too complacent.   [2] We had 5 foot 6 Ramos and our equally short backline guarding the scariest forward in MLS on crosses. I mean... when you see the replays you'll understand. They got posterized like an NBA highlight.  [3] 20+ shots. Fewer than 10 on goal. Still skying it into the stands.
OCLions,37wsym,secretlyadog,3,Sun May 31 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"Welp, maybe it's a good thing I was out of town and couldn't watch."
OCLions,37wsym,Generalparks,2,Sun May 31 03:46:23 2015 UTC,"I was a little drunk and forgot how Columbus got a red card. Could anybody fill me in?  Other than that I though it was a decent game. We seem to be attacking more but our shots still aren't very accurate, which I feel is a effect of us not scoring very many home goals.  Overall though middle of the eastern table isn't too bad so far for our first year in the MLS, and it is certainly better than I expected."
OCLions,37wsym,Harry_Kane,3,Sun May 31 15:02:42 2015 UTC,Defender in the goal to deflect shot. Kaka(?) kicked the ball hit defender in the (upper) arm. Ref says defender's arm came forward to deflect the ball out of the net making it deliberate. Professional foul.
OCLions,37wyl9,lapena88,5,Sun May 31 02:23:34 2015 UTC,"Poise in front of goal is seriously lacking on this team still, so many missed chances!"
OCLions,37wyl9,j_andrew_h,3,Sun May 31 05:11:32 2015 UTC,that game was easily 5-2.  So depressing.
OCLions,37wyl9,spikebaylor,5,Sun May 31 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"I'm keeping it all in perspective by telling myself this is a really young team especially upfront. Consider that Larin is a 20 yr old rookie, Rivas is a 21 yr old who is from the Colombian first division. Rochez is 20, Turner, Rivera, Redding, Ramos, Estrela, Higuita, Heath, and Donovan are all under 21 and we have a few more that are like 22 and 23.  Point is we're young, but that's a good amount of talent that will get so much better in time.   Is this a frustrating start to the season with games like this? Yeah sure is. But the club clearly have sustainability as a main part of their goal."
OCLions,37wyl9,coachhawley,1 point,Sun May 31 16:35:13 2015 UTC,We take all 3 points if Brek is on the pitch.

OCLions,37qxjn,SamuelMuniz,12,Sat May 30 09:11:07 2015 UTC,"In today's day and age of stadiums being funded on the backs of taxpayers, this is super refreshing. Not only does the franchise show its love to the city of Orlando (most other sports franchise would've started looking elsewhere for cities hungry for a team), but they are putting their money where their mouth is. If they are putting up all the security for the stadium, you know their seriousness about putting together a winning team is truly legit."
OCLions,37qxjn,pvdfan,8,Fri May 29 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"It makes one wonder just how much profit they think there is total.  For them to turn this 100% private, there has to be some massive numbers thrown around."
OCLions,37qxjn,Bvitamins1,9,Fri May 29 18:41:55 2015 UTC,I think they are in this for the long term profits. NFL and NBA teams were worth a lot less 30 years ago than now. With soccer getting more popular in the US then MLS teams could see the same return
OCLions,37qxjn,pvdfan,3,Fri May 29 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"I agree but with the stadium itself, it feels like short term there was a ton of money being left on the table for the team."

OCLions,37qxjn,Bwignite24,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"No, not yet...  Phil Rawlins is supposed to be meeting with the design firm (Populous) this week in KC to discuss the new design.  They are waiting on a final design, so they know how many it will hold (which is why they don't have an exact total).  However, based on the ground work and some foundation that has already been done, I doubt it is going to stray too far from what the current design is.  Probably inclosed corners and south end, plus some other minor reconfigurations."
OCLions,37qxjn,KubaBVB09,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:09:10 2015 UTC,Closer to Downtown? I wonder if that's intentional to push up ridership on the SunRail?
OCLions,37qxjn,jmoney0999,4,Fri May 29 18:24:20 2015 UTC,"The stadium was always set for the location it is in.  It is closer to dowtown than the citrus bowl though.  A lot of that was because of MLSs ""downtown stadium"" stipulation.  Also its just a good location.  One block west of the amway center, trivial walking distance from downtown food/bars.. and yes the sunrail if it ran at convenient times for games which it does not."
OCLions,37qxjn,taylor314gh,3,Fri May 29 18:52:11 2015 UTC,SunRail doesn't run on the weekends currently.
OCLions,37qxjn,KubaBVB09,3,Fri May 29 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"The location near downtown has been set from the beginning, nothing new here."
OCLions,37qxjn,BlauGelbGG,-7,Fri May 29 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of non-soccer fans are not going to be happy about this. It's good for the team but basically a ""fuck the community"" move. At least we don't have to deal with random community events in the stadium anymore."
OCLions,37qxjn,applepwnz,11,Fri May 29 18:33:12 2015 UTC,I think it's like fuck the state for not giving us the money that was promised to us more than fuck the community.  And I guarantee there will still be community events there but now it'll just be when it's convenient for OCSC instead of whenever the city wants.
OCLions,37qxjn,fsuguy92,8,Fri May 29 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"If people are mad about this they should direct their anger at the state of FL, not the club. If the politicians in Tallahassee had done what they should and authorized the budget in the original session the stadium would be a publicly owned one. Plus this will generate property tax which will be reinvested in the city. It's a win-win result."
OCLions,37qxjn,misanthropicbuddha,2,Fri May 29 18:38:29 2015 UTC,I agree I'm just saying that's how people will see it.
OCLions,37qxjn,fsuguy92,4,Fri May 29 18:44:01 2015 UTC,I don't follow. What is there to be unhappy about?
OCLions,37qxjn,misanthropicbuddha,-1,Fri May 29 19:45:52 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the capacity still seem a bit small? I mean, this shiny new stadium will have 10,000 less seats than our average attendance."
OCLions,37qxjn,ibribe,8,Fri May 29 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that 37,000 ""average"" includes the opener which was attended by 65,000. That won't be the case every year. A 28,000 seat stadium puts us right at a sweet spot of being more than capable of filling it up every game without it being too much. Nothing looks worse on TV than empty seats."
OCLions,37qxjn,misanthropicbuddha,6,Fri May 29 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"To take that a step further, I just calculated the average attendance of the four MLS matches (Vancouver, DC, Toronto, and NE) in which the upper bowl was not opened to be 30,511.  If the club is pushing for a 28k stadium, then the capacity will be just right IMO."
OCLions,37qxjn,macaco_gordinho,7,Fri May 29 18:44:44 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. Gonna sound pretentious saying this but as an economics major it's almost a good thing if there is slightly more demand than there are seats. Although secondary marketplaces for tickets don't help the team's bottom line, it pushes up the cost which also drives excitement and places a premium on going to a game. Keeping the gameday experience an event to behold on a consistent basis is something that will keep the fans coming back time and time again."
OCLions,37qxjn,ibribe,3,Fri May 29 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, besides if the team ever has a major losing streak skid, or something akin to what happened earlier this season, the casual fan will be less likely to go.  Therefore, still be a fairly large crowd at all times. I'm sure my logic is flawed, but that's all I feel like typing on my phone."
OCLions,37qxjn,jmoney0999,3,Fri May 29 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"LA didn't quite sell out lower bowl either, but yeah.  And it's looking to be a crowd of about 30k tomorrow."

I own an authentic, but have considered buying an Ali version to have for gym wear, lawn work, etc - that I don't care about ruining.    To the OP, I'm also a Cleveland Browns fan.

If we can get that I'd be really happy. That's where we know we might need a little help   3 players in means moving some guys on.  Since Molino and Cascio are injured we're not over roster regulations just yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if we let guys like Josh Ford and Danny Mwanga go in the summer.  I imagine we're in for a right winger   Do you give younger players minutes for the Open Cup? We'll see. What I want to impress is that we're treating the Open Cup very important because it's a great opportunity for us   I want to see Redding, Donovan, Estrela get minutes but I also want a trophy"
OCLions,37evme,logjam13,2,Wed May 27 03:43:29 2015 UTC,"I think you are more likely to see Ricketts go during the summer than Ford...  and I think you will see Estrela, Redding, and Heath sent to LCFC.  Still depends on injuries and how many are lost during Gold Cup..."
OCLions,37evme,daguru9,1 point,Wed May 27 12:46:38 2015 UTC,"Ford couldn't get on the team sheet over Edwards and is probably on a similar cap hit to Ricketts. But even if the young guys are loaned out they'd get recalled so they wouldn't be cup tied to LCFC, whether they see the field is another story"
OCLions,37evme,logjam13,1 point,Wed May 27 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"Id be happy to see a bit of new blood in if only to make up for the long time injuries and couple useless bodies we have lying around.  Mwanga has looked more invisible than avila the few times he's made it on, and with Hall back in the line up and Edwards Jr seeming to get the nod over Ford i could definitely see those two going.  I dont think there is anyone else we would drop save maybe Rivera or Pato depending on who we picked up for that forward spot.  I think its a good idea to let Collin sit one more out and let hines and st ledger keep their stride.  They have been doing exceptional and id rather have collin super healthy when we need him and not sidelined for the rest of the season because we brought him back too quickly.  Will be great to see Ribeiro back.  I hope he slots in at RM, but he'll probably come in as a sub.    This is going to be an important game.  Second game against columbus where they spanked us the first one.  We need to show eveyone that it was a fluke.  We really need a win against DC in a few weeks too.  We've lost to them twice now on bad luck.  Edit: oh open cup.. i know we want to try hard.. but will we have the manpower to give it our all AND compete for playoffs AND see everyone leave for their various tournaments? I hope so."
OCLions,37evme,spikebaylor,1 point,Wed May 27 12:01:47 2015 UTC,"I think the most likely to go are probably Ford, Mwanga, Cascio, Paterson, and Ricketts. Maybe Estrela since it seems like he doesn't exist anymore (not sure why he hasn't been loaned out). I love the transfer windows but I'd be kinda sad seeing some of these guys leave. Hell, I was disappointed when Barrett got waived."
OCLions,37evme,logjam13,1 point,Wed May 27 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"You won't see Paterson loaned...  question about him is whether they offer him a contract or not. His loan is almost up and that team has already said he will not be resigned.  So OCSC could sign him on contract, as a free agent, without waiting for transfer window.  I agree about Estrela and would add Redding...  Ford/Ricketts may depend on whether they get any good offers for Ricketts (looking at you Philly)."
OCLions,37evme,daguru9,1 point,Wed May 27 21:26:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I meant leave the club not loaned out, I doubt any of those guys leave on loan. I think with Heath's comments about needing a striker in case Larin can't go the whole season is telling about Paterson being signed though. If they thought he was the guy they would hopefully be satisfied with our 5 forwards"
OCLions,37d8q8,OCLions,8,Tue May 26 19:51:19 2015 UTC,It depends on who is healthy to play but for me they have to go with Rivas and see what he can do at LM.  Any other choice will be defensive minded which isn't where we are strongest.  I'm not saying that we don't play good defense; but rather that our strength is in the attacking mindset and possession that we have in our 4-2-3-1.  Almost anyone else would allow Columbus to just crowd Kaka and force us to just lob the ball to Larin and hope he can do something (not an ideal plan at all).    Maybe coach will come with something different with Larin and Paterson that can provide the attack that we'd be lacking otherwise.
OCLions,37d8q8,j_andrew_h,4,Tue May 26 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'm REALLY hoping for Rivas/Kaka/Ribeiro for this weekend, but probably not.. Probably Avila in on RM and maybe bring Ribeiro in late game to give him time to acclimate.  I could see maybe a 4-2-2-2 with Larin and Paterson up top, Rivas and Kaka behind them. I doubt that though too.  I do think we see Rivas starting unless there is some other issue.  It's a golden time to bring him in and see what he's made of for a start in his actual position."
OCLions,37d8q8,spikebaylor,2,Tue May 26 20:55:09 2015 UTC,I agree on every point!
OCLions,37d8q8,j_andrew_h,3,Tue May 26 21:20:11 2015 UTC,Considering how Rivas has been playing the past few games I wish we had an alternative...
OCLions,37d8q8,EASports_MUT,3,Tue May 26 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"He plays the way he does because he's brought on late in matches and often when we're down.  I'd like to see him earlier on when he doesn't have to be so aggressive. Other than him, we have Neal and potentially Ribeiro who could step in"
OCLions,37d8q8,logjam13,3,Tue May 26 21:19:06 2015 UTC,I can't say that I disagree; but at the same time I really don't want ot see a midfield of Avila & Neal on the wings... they are both the same type of player; not going to make many mistakes and not not going to scare the Columbus Crew one bit either.    Maybe Rivas needs a whole game at his given position to settle in and not feel such a crazed sense of urgency.  He had ridiculous skills he just needs to be focused; but even if he's a bit of a loose cannon on Saturday... his speed alone will keep Columbus having to pay attention to him and that should help everyone else.
OCLions,37d8q8,j_andrew_h,0,Tue May 26 21:19:37 2015 UTC,but even if he's a bit of a loose cannon on Saturday...   Just as long as he doesn't start playing like Ramos I think we'll do alright...
OCLions,37d8q8,EASports_MUT,2,Tue May 26 21:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't even thinking about that type of ""loose canon""...  I certainly don't want to see any stupid temper tantrum type fouls from Rivas or anyone for that matter.     I was thinking about the crazy 40 yard shots and stuff like that."

OCLions,37d8q8,ragewu,2,Wed May 27 12:35:29 2015 UTC,"He's not dead. Also, it is highly debatable if Brek got what he deserved."
OCLions,37c2zu,Generalparks,5,Tue May 26 15:07:37 2015 UTC,"Uh oh. If Ramos goes to the U21 Euros, we're down to Hines and Avila as RBs. But I think this will be a great experience for Tyler"
OCLions,37c2zu,logjam13,5,Tue May 26 15:10:40 2015 UTC,Neal and Ribeiro coming back from injury is almost vital at this point.  At least then we could slot Avila back to RB if needed and still have coverage in midfield.
OCLions,37c2zu,logjam13,3,Tue May 26 15:13:34 2015 UTC,Looks like this U23 tournament is only a week long and the U21 Euros aren't until the middle of June so hopefully it won't have to come to that.  Turner should only miss Columbus and Chicago
OCLions,37c2zu,spikebaylor,2,Tue May 26 15:46:05 2015 UTC,Good point.  If all of these overlapped we would be screwed.
OCLions,37c2zu,pvdfan,2,Tue May 26 16:00:48 2015 UTC,"The way hines and st ledger have been playing.. covering for collin, i dont think there would be a huge issue with hines moving right and collin and st ledger playing cb.  Its certainly not as ideal as having ramos or turner to run up the side, but no worse than outting avila back there.  While its not his main job and i dont know how his crosses are, i could see hines pushing up occasionally.  He has done fairly well pushing up the middle when it makes sense and getting a good pass off to start the attack.  I know its not the same but i see a sliver of attacking prowess in him."
OCLions,37cib2,OCSC407,3,Tue May 26 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"They meet quarterly to discuss what has been going on in the club and to provide their feedback.  Great group of fans ranging in age, family size, and seat location."

OCLions,37cib2,Robotcharles,3,Wed May 27 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"I was interviewed to be on the council last year and after not being selected I was upset but hopeful that they would be active and develop a good relationship between fans/media/FO/team. I'm pretty disappointed not to have heard a peep about them since they were announced, probably just a PR move after the arrests at the Tampa Bay game."

OCLions,37biau,j_andrew_h,2,Tue May 26 13:42:01 2015 UTC,Terrible way to make the final squad but congratulations to Donovan.  Here's hoping he has a great World Cup and uses it as a springboard to the starting 11  in Orlando or Louisville.
OCLions,378mx4,werdx,2,Mon May 25 19:45:52 2015 UTC,You'll want to come earlier than this; but I've arrived at the bus stop an hour before kickoff and were in our seats with a beverage in hand no problem.  The bars around Church Street station will be your best bet for bars with drink and food specials.  You can also hit up the food trucks that will be in a party section just outside the stadium... that's fun too.
OCLions,378mx4,j_andrew_h,2,Mon May 25 22:47:01 2015 UTC,The Wall Street Plaza is a popular pregame spot. Also the Harry Buffalo is another good spot that's a little closer to the Citrus Bowl shuttles.
OCLions,378mx4,The_Puntastic_Voyage,4,Mon May 25 23:36:05 2015 UTC,Lot 11 tailgate. ILF and Ruckus will be out in full force before the buses even start running from downtown. 5 bucks will get you food from either supporter group.
OCLions,378mx4,Deathxrays,1 point,Mon May 25 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"That's definitely an option. We may just want to bar hop for a bit, though."
OCLions,378mx4,KeyserSooooze,2,Mon May 25 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"Best bars downtown would be anywhere on Church St. or Wall St. Both have open street party  atmospheres with purple everywhere, music playing, and plenty of bars and beer stands. Check out the Harry Buffalo on Church St. for some good bar food.  If you want to venture out to an Irish pub atmosphere, I would highly recommend the Harp and Celt on Magnolia or Lizzy McCormack's on Orange. Harp and Celt has a pretty good menu as well.  The buses run from just north of the  Amway Center, which is only a block west from the Church St. block party. It'll take you to the Citrus Bowl, which isn't very far, where you can explore all the gameday festivities.  My advice would be to check out the bars and try to take the bus down to the Citrus Bowl at least a half hour early. The lines to get in can be pretty long, but more importantly, try to walk in the stadium when the supporters groups do to get yourself pumped and learn some of the songs. Enjoy!"
OCLions,378mx4,Deathxrays,1 point,Tue May 26 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you want to drink (and don't have a car) bars are going to be your best option. However if you can bring a disposable cooler with you to walk around its well worth seeing our brand of ""game preparation""  Just be aware that the bars downtown are bit of a trek to the citrus bowl so plan accordingly to get down to the stadium using the buses."
OCLions,378mx4,Deathxrays,1 point,Mon May 25 20:53:25 2015 UTC,When do the busses run?
OCLions,378mx4,nautika,1 point,Mon May 25 21:00:07 2015 UTC,They run all day basically from downtown to the stadium. I say plan accordingly because I have no idea how full the buses get close to kick off.
OCLions,378mx4,spikebaylor,1 point,Mon May 25 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"There are so many buses waiting in front of the police station to transport to the citrus bowl that it has never been an issue.  I think as long as you get on the bus about half an hour before the game starts, you'll be fine."
OCLions,378mx4,beerinthedark,1 point,Tue May 26 02:54:04 2015 UTC,Is it walkable and safe from downtown to the citrus bowl or is the bus the best option?
OCLions,378mx4,Bwignite24,3,Mon May 25 23:53:51 2015 UTC,"definitely take the bus going out to the stadium.  They are frequent and quick.  You're welcome to walk but in this instance there isn't a need.  I have heard great things about the busses going back downtown as well, but my friend's and I usually walk back.  Always figured the mass rush of people would make the buses a pain (but I have heard it's just fine).  There is usually a rather large crowd walking back and it's a fun time to chant with other fans or just discuss the game with your friends while stretching your legs a bit.  It's not that long of a walk... maybe 15 minutes or so."
OCLions,378mx4,mcg1848,2,Tue May 26 02:18:44 2015 UTC,It's not the nicest area but I feel pretty safe there on game days because of the number of people.  I've walked from downtown and taken the shuttle and it really just depends on the mood you're in.
OCLions,378mx4,titanzero,1 point,Tue May 26 01:19:00 2015 UTC,"It should be safe. The walk on church street to the game is safe enough. The back should be even safer as the street is well lit, plenty of police, and a whole bunch of other people are walking back. The busses should be faster though."
OCLions,377i5r,Ronaldmethot,4,Mon May 25 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"I have read the article and I can understand how the ref came to the red card conclusion. I don't like or totally agree with it, but that's life. My question is if Shea gets a red for his tackle, what about the tackle that was made on him in the 44th min? The tackle was late, reckless, from behind/blindside of him and could have very easily done some serious damage. Break had most of his weight on the foot.  Also, do you think that maybe the ref had thought that Shea's tackle was retaliation? Shea was tackled in the 44th and Shea got his red in the 51st."
OCLions,377i5r,Aftershock912,5,Mon May 25 21:21:23 2015 UTC,I'd struggle to think that Shea would hold a grudge through halftime. But I think Shea definitely wouldn't have made that tackle if the ref hadn't been so lenient the rest of the match.
OCLions,377i5r,zrowny,3,Mon May 25 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'll just never see a red in that.  Yellow, ok, but not red."
OCLions,377i5r,DemonSpeed,1 point,Mon May 25 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"I think anytime the studs are even sort of up and they make contact with someone's leg; there's a decent chance it's a red. I don't like the call in this instance as he was swinging his leg rather than coming with a straight leg out and it was clear he wasn't going for tackle but rather missing the ball and should have been a yellow in my book.  But again it's too close to what a mindless ref might think is ""textbook"" red."
OCLions,377i5r,j_andrew_h,3,Mon May 25 22:43:36 2015 UTC,If you watch the video he puts his foot to the ground as the player runs in to make the contact... it was sj into shea not shea into the player..
OCLions,377i5r,ftx437,6,Tue May 26 00:37:33 2015 UTC,Plus Alashe actually put his studs into Brek's ankle in the first half and it was only yellow. There's been a lot of really inconsistent reffing in this league
OCLions,377i5r,logjam13,3,Tue May 26 01:31:10 2015 UTC,Same ref as the SKCvNE fiasco the previous week...
OCLions,377i5r,daguru9,2,Tue May 26 12:21:59 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, it shouldn't have been a Red..  But it would get called a fair amount of the time because a lesser quality referee only sees studs and leg making contact and the card comes out."
OCLions,377i5r,j_andrew_h,2,Tue May 26 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"I think you missed /u/ftx437's point, his studs don't make contact with the player as shea lowers his foot to the ground after he whiffs the ball."

OCLions,3785vn,WhiteWilliamHaynes,5,Mon May 25 17:45:19 2015 UTC,Not sure which thing you are talking about.  His yellow card was more worthy of a red thab sheas.  He was really lucky not to be ejected for his sweep kick.  Later he was lucky not to get yet another pk.  I liked him in his short stint against LA but yesterday he looked like he had a chip on his shoulder and was more of a liability than a help.  I think if he had come on earlier like it seemed was the plan it might have gone better.
OCLions,3785vn,spikebaylor,3,Mon May 25 18:02:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought the same thing.  We didn't need to be another man down because he was in a bad mood.  Maybe they pulled a hockey move and sent in a goon.
OCLions,3785vn,Timmyj01,2,Mon May 25 20:57:20 2015 UTC,Yeah the sweep kick is what I was talking about. It was like he subbed in and one minute later lost his temper. I was scared we were about to get another red. His actions were a little over the top.
OCLions,3785vn,daguru9,1 point,Mon May 25 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"He seems like a very fiery player and I don't he appreciated the possible on him and then the SJ player scrapping with him...  but needs to temper that.

OCLions,377li4,qoou,3,Mon May 25 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"The width is supposed to come from the fullbacks in this formation,   we didn't do a good job of getting Ramos & Boden the ball out wide where we should have been able to take advantage of the Earthquakes diamond."
OCLions,377li4,j_andrew_h,0,Mon May 25 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"A good theory, but in practice, it takes too long to run the wing backs box to box. By the time they get there, the defense is hunkered down and waiting. As soon as they make their crosses in, they have to hustle back to defend.  I think Ramos did a fantastic job getting forward. He just couldn't get a cross off to anyone because the quakes had the center well under control. When he comes up a midfielder has to drop and play deep to cover the gap and that left the OC middle to sparse against the diamond in the middle.  This requires a patient, probing game working the ball around the box. Keeping the backs forward, doesn't really work for the long, patient play required for exploiting the weaknesses of the diamond."
OCLions,377li4,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon May 25 18:10:30 2015 UTC,I see what you're saying.. Shea and Avila probably need to start from a wider position and drift inward if/when the fullbacks come up and provide the width; but initially start further out to spread out the CBs and provide a possible counter.
OCLions,377li4,spikebaylor,1 point,Mon May 25 22:40:30 2015 UTC,agreed.   plus you can still make overlapping runs even with a player out wide a bit.  One of the biggest things keeping Kaka from really shining is that Shea and Avila both pinch in far too much and crowd him while also not giving him a useful passing option.
OCLions,377li4,daguru9,1 point,Tue May 26 02:14:40 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this... Shea was playing too far inside and the backs were having a difficult time moving further down the flanks.  It was a good defense from San Jose and we did not adjust accordingly. Towards the end of the game, after Shea was sent off, the backs (especially Ramos) was finally able to start making his way down the flanks, which is why we still dangerous until the end.  Also probably because San Jose opened open to go on the offense and became more vulnerable.  We just didn't adjust accordingly and Shea was having a very bad game..."
OCLions,377li4,logjam13,0,Tue May 26 12:20:05 2015 UTC,Except they didn't play with a diamond.  They looked more like a 4-3-3 like this.  Nyassi/Salinas played defense when Boden/Ramos ran forward and allowed their fullbacks to stay on our wingers.  Their midfield trio played tight to combat Kaka.  They were able to close off the middle and the flanks and play really well overall.

OCLions,375fge,pvdfan,8,Mon May 25 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"Oh darwin.  You are one of the best players 99% of the time... but then theres plays like that.  The team is always so sharp except those few lapses which wouldnt be so bad if they were minor, but its like they switch brains with  10 y/o randomly and do the dumbest thing imaginable."
OCLions,375fge,spikebaylor,3,Mon May 25 02:05:25 2015 UTC,At least he is playing towards his potential and now down to the competition like last season.  Baby steps for Darwin.
OCLions,375fge,pvdfan,6,Mon May 25 06:12:56 2015 UTC,"Extremely happy to take a point away from home. Although, Avila was non existent yet again, the ref was pure shit, and I'm not sure what to take out of Breks red card, was it or not? It's iffy. Overall, extremely happy for the lads to stick it out defensively and get a hard well earned point!"
OCLions,375fge,TheBrutalLad,4,Mon May 25 01:12:07 2015 UTC,"I could live with Avilla being non existent on offense but he was basically the 12th man for San Jose with at least a dozen giveaway passes.  If this was USL-PRO he should be benched for that, let alone MLS."
OCLions,375fge,pvdfan,4,Mon May 25 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"It sucks that we lose Shea for the next game, but it's good that he gets a break anyway. He seems like he really needs one."
OCLions,375fge,Widan,6,Mon May 25 01:11:52 2015 UTC,Maybe Rivas gets the start at LM with Shea suspended and can play 90 minutes at his actual position for the 1st time this season.

Live in Austin but visiting SF for a wedding so I made it down for the game. It was a very good experience although I'd have preferred it be at the Avaya.

OCLions,375fmb,misanthropicbuddha,4,Mon May 25 01:09:55 2015 UTC,Had a tough time giving Darwin a high grade even though I thought he played well. That challenge that resulted in the pen was dumb. Brek I thought should have been yellow given Alashe's yellow for actually making studs to ankle contact...
OCLions,375fmb,logjam13,3,Mon May 25 01:48:37 2015 UTC,I agree with your analysis completely.
OCLions,375fmb,zrowny,2,Mon May 25 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah the ref was ridiculously inconsistent this match. Shea's challenge is definitely a red with the strictness of some refs, but the way the ref acted this match was just fucking stupid"
OCLions,370p5q,logjam13,3,Sat May 23 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"According to the mls preview, this ref averages close to 4 yellows a game. Shea needs to be careful. He only needs 1 more for a suspension."
OCLions,370p5q,Aftershock912,3,Sat May 23 21:13:45 2015 UTC,doesn't help that WE average 4 yellows a game either :(  Plenty of deserved cards but LOTS of soft ones too.

OCLions,370p5q,beefat99,2,Sun May 24 20:48:27 2015 UTC,This should be the line up tomorrow right?
OCLions,370p5q,spikebaylor,3,Sat May 23 19:56:43 2015 UTC,Is higuita injured?  thought him and ceren have been great these past two games and have really upped our offensive game.
OCLions,370p5q,jmoney0999,2,Sat May 23 20:27:00 2015 UTC,Okugo has just looked a step slow the last couple matches he played. Higuita and ceren seem to have a great dynamic. Both defend and attack well.
OCLions,370p5q,spikebaylor,3,Sat May 23 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and nothing against Okugo he was great until the past couple weeks.  He's still a great DM, but im not sure he's the right one for our style.  good to have him for when we need to change up and play more defensive though."
OCLions,370p5q,j_andrew_h,2,Sat May 23 22:04:46 2015 UTC,I don't see Coach going away from what worked so well last week especially in the Defensive Midfield.  The combination of Higuita and Ceren has a been a bright spark that will continue with until that spark burns out.
OCLions,370p5q,burajin,2,Sun May 24 00:43:04 2015 UTC,Very likely. I'd like to see Paterson fit in there somewhere though.
OCLions,370p5q,checkonechecktwo,2,Sun May 24 06:37:03 2015 UTC,I could see him getting put on as a sub again. Would be happy to see that.

Supporter Section you'd probably have to stand the whole time and you may at times have your view obstructed by flags. As a visiting fan I think you'd enjoy it more sitting away from that area, maybe go find the other Crew fans (if there are any)."
OCLions,36y2pu,Semco14,2,Sat May 23 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I actually had not thought about the flags, that is one thing to think about. There are plenty on stub hub like $5-10 more, just wanted to make sure if we do end up there for some reason. Definitely I can believe as a visiting fan. Granted I would not think of my self as visiting though I wouldn't think about myself as that. I would mostly be there to simply enjoy the game than as a Crew fan. Also by not sitting in the supporter section we would be able to get the full impact of it by seeing it from their front instead of behind them."

OCLions,36y2pu,Yeti_Cat,5,Sun May 24 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"They're plenty of people in the supporter's section that are there more casually. The only thing I would say is don't sit close to the field towards the center if you won't be standing during the entire game. If you sit you may get chastised/yelled at.  Also, flags everywhere in the center. Last game was hard to see. There will be swearing as well, something else to consider.  Edit: I sort of suck at reading, but what I said still sort of applies. Just try to blend in with casuals, shouldn't have any issues  being a sneaky Crew fan. :p"
OCLions,36y2pu,Disorted,1 point,Sat May 23 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, the swearing is not a problem and understandable as long as it wouldn't be directed towards me.

It is a big gamble to think we will have 37k still going to games 3-5-7 years down the road.  If anyone has ever seen a New England or DC United match, it is the biggest reason why we need a SSS.  We are in the honeymoon phase now and, while we may keep up the incredible attendance this year, who is to say we will have it years down the road."
OCLions,36vfk9,pm2562,5,Fri May 22 14:17:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that Scott is missing the big picture, but I totally believe we will see consistent high attendance. Florida is a great spot for soccer. More people are interested now solely bc the general public know what MLS is compared to USL Pro or NASL. Not too mention the season playing during the best time for leisure travel. More people in this town will go out to see a soccer match then would go to a Magic game."

OCLions,36sbt7,j_andrew_h,3,Thu May 21 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"Well we would be a threat on every cross or corner. I just think Ribeiro provides an engine in the midfield that we're lacking.

OCLions,36sbt7,j_andrew_h,3,Fri May 22 01:04:08 2015 UTC,"i'm looking forward to Ribeiro coming in for Avila.  I think because he played forward a couple games in the beginning, people have been forgetting that it wasn't his initial position.  Like Rivas before him, he was there because there wasn't anyone else.  Even the announcers for games have commented about him coming back and taking over Larin's spot.  I don't see that happening.  Larin has done well and the only people I see overtaking him are the other strikers we have (pato, rochez) at full health.    Ribeiro alongside Kaka will be fantastic.  We all knew about Kaka's connection with Molino, but I think we saw in the MTL game just how good the Brazilian connection was too."
OCLions,36sbt7,spikebaylor,3,Thu May 21 22:17:18 2015 UTC,I doubt anyone could take Larin's spot from him now. 4 goals in 7 appearances is ludicrous from a rookie. But Ribeiro is another spark in midfield that Avila just...isn't
OCLions,36sbt7,logjam13,1 point,Thu May 21 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"Although I could see Ribeiro coming off the bench as a sub for Kaka... give the man some rest, especially since this is Ribeiro's usual position."

He’s scored eight goals in 32 appearances this season for Real Madrid. “People at our club spoke to his people and I think where that goes, obviously he [played last week] in the Champions League semifinal, so that puts in perspective what we’re talking about,” Heath said. “I don’t think there’s a team, an ambitious club in MLS, who wouldn’t be interested in talking to Chicharito. I’d put us in that mix.”"

OCLions,36piby,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu May 21 13:00:38 2015 UTC,"Allocation money (I think we had $1.5m), and transfer fees are applied to a player's cap hit, spread out over their contract. So Rivas and Rochez may not be seeing a lot of money, but if we spent a decent amount to bring them over it's reflected in their cap hit  Plus players like Redding, Donovan, Larin, Turner, Rivera, Edwards, and maybe even Estrela and Ramos don't count toward the cap. We have 10 players making up at least 600,000 all together off budget salary"

OCLions,36m3wl,daguru9,3,Wed May 20 11:49:29 2015 UTC,I'm beginning to wonder if it would be easier to just buy revenue control for the Citrus Bowl.
OCLions,36m3wl,manelandjeff,3,Wed May 20 12:23:59 2015 UTC,Think I'd rather we had our own $85m stadium downtown with natural grass than staying at the CB
OCLions,36m3wl,logjam13,2,Wed May 20 16:56:12 2015 UTC,its my understanding we need grass to attract more international matches...which i totally understand. When i saw the replay yesterday the announcers said that there were several politicians in attendance.. hopefully that made a huge impact on them
OCLions,36m3wl,LonestarJones,1 point,Wed May 20 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"If we have control of the stadium, we can replace the turf with grass.  And one of the problems with ""politicians in attendance"" is that they could interpret the message incorrectly. Seeing the atmosphere of the Citrus Bowl could convince them that we don't really need a new, smaller venue."
OCLions,36m3wl,manelandjeff,2,Thu May 21 10:51:00 2015 UTC,The fact that there is no plan be for a different stadium design or to get the funding in other ways blows my mind.  I don't think the team grasp how big a cluster fuck the state budget fight is.
OCLions,36m3wl,pvdfan,2,Wed May 20 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"They do have other plans for the stadium. The first phase is the 85m that they already secured. They just want to go ahead with phase 2, to add more seats and amenities. Which is what the additional 30m from the state is for.   But yeah, they probably should come up with a different way to get the additional 30m."
OCLions,36m3wl,nautika,3,Wed May 20 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is the full $115 million design is phase 1.  When this story broke a while back, the team and local politicans both went on record that the full amount was needed to build any part of the stadium as they scrapped the original $85 million dollar design.  The plans that have been submitted to and approved by the city planning commissions back this up as there is no contingency plan if the stadium fell short on funding.  Phase 2, or expansion as mentioned in the plans, have them filling in the empty corners with seats to reach max capacity of 22,900."
OCLions,36m3wl,pvdfan,2,Wed May 20 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"I am sure they are looking into other options and have other plans, but they are not going to say that publicly.  If they say it publicly, then the argument will be ""why do you need this money from the state""...  The one issue that could hamper private funds for the rest of the stadium is the fact that the team will not own the new stadium.  The stadium will either be owned by City of Orlando or joint ownership between City of Orlando and Orange County (I don't remember which one) and not the club itself.  With the expansion fee and the millions that the club is adding to the construction budget (I wanna say $20 million, but memory is hazing today), would be difficult for the club itself to lay out another $30 million for something that they do not own.  Yes, they would reap the benefits, but I think it would take even longer to recoup the initial costs AND could void the availability of the tourist tax dollars from the City/County..."

OCLions,36etja,HesitantlyYours,3,Mon May 18 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"I'll tell ya who stole that alien, that damn Sasquatch!"
OCLions,36etja,Timmyj01,3,Tue May 19 00:21:58 2015 UTC,"A $200 charity donation is being offered for the anonymous return of Frank The Alien. As has been mentioned, this was not an Orlando City/Ruckus/ILF ""trophy"", this was the personal property of a fan that was taken.  If anyone can help with the return of this prop, a $200 donation will be made to the charity of their choice. You can email FrankTheAlien1@gmail.com to help coordinate his safe return. We know it is a long shot, but any help is greatly appreciated in getting this back to it's rightful owner. Please do not pass on this chance to do some good with what is an unfortunate situation.  Thanks,"
OCLions,36etja,OCityBeautiful,2,Tue May 19 18:26:53 2015 UTC,I personally know the owner of Frank the Alien. Any information leading to his return is greatly appreciated and will be rewarded.

OCLions,36etja,OCityBeautiful,2,Mon May 18 23:44:38 2015 UTC,Not the ACB guys. Someone slaps an OLD galaxy kit on the thing and they assume it was a visiting SG...
OCLions,36etja,LeanMrfuzzles,-1,Tue May 19 18:30:51 2015 UTC,And you know this how?  Are you hypothesizing or you know who did it?  You do realize that the L.A. Galaxy are the most popular team in MLS.  Not all LAG supporters are ACB just like not all OCSC supporters are Ruckus or ILF.    If you know who did it you should let us all know who those criminals are.    Nothing about this is funny.  I'm shocked that our own supporters are making jokes about this.
OCLions,36etja,toddious01,0,Tue May 19 19:12:12 2015 UTC,Back off. Knowing that someone DIDN'T do something isn't the same as knowing who did.
OCLions,36etja,mikesicle,2,Thu May 21 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"ayy lmao, but in all seriousness though I hope you guys find it."
OCLions,36etja,SauzzBozz,1 point,Mon May 18 23:10:42 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there has been no updates on the return of the alien. It appears that someone thinks this prank is funny enough to negate the $200 charity donation that has been offered. Pretty lame if you ask me.

Instead of showing flashes of ability and then playing sloppy enough to lose it, we played a well rounded game from whistle to whistle.

OCLions,36b50r,Widan,18,Sun May 17 23:29:56 2015 UTC,That Cerén goal is great. My personal goal of the week.
OCLions,36b50r,nautika,17,Sun May 17 23:33:38 2015 UTC,It would have been so much more amazing if it went in on his first attempt.  Still a great goal though.
OCLions,36b50r,spikebaylor,17,Sun May 17 23:38:04 2015 UTC,"It would have been better for Ceren, but im so fucking glad it went in that way.  Ive been saying it all season.. Just put the damn thing on frame... weird shit happens sometimes that can go in your favor. None of that can happen when its 20 feet over the crossbar.  Placement means way more than power."
OCLions,36b50r,Widan,14,Mon May 18 00:08:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, his first shot was so glorious. I wish that had gone in so much."
OCLions,36b50r,secretlyadog,12,Sun May 17 23:40:04 2015 UTC,He deserved this one after hitting the crossbar.
OCLions,36b50r,EntityDamage,12,Sun May 17 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"That first goal was the best for me, but it's even better when you watch the ENTIRE build-up.   The 2nd goal was a close 2nd."
OCLions,36b50r,zrowny,2,Sun May 17 23:42:31 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend goes ""Is that Ceren?"" when the first goal attempt was made and it bounced back to him.  I said ""No...THAT's Ceren"" and the shit went in.  It was like a damn script.  My second game and it was better than I ever expected.  Can't wait for more."

OCLions,36b50r,pktian808,20,Sun May 17 23:45:44 2015 UTC,It would be hilarious if we were hustlin the rest of the league

I hated sports until I discovered Seattle and I've been following you guys since you came into MLS. I wore a Seattle jersey to Orlando's first game before we even had jerseys of our own. Every song I sing for Orlando I do it because you guys taught me how to be a fan. Your approval means the world to me.  PORTLAND AND LA DOWN! Emerald City!! Orlando City!!  Edit. Forgot to put Orlando in there at the end. I always get a little too excited when the cool Seattle kids are around."

I want there to be a camaraderie between Orlando and Seattle. And I know you guys have had some expansion-team-related woes (not nearly NYC level), but let's face it, you guys will definitely be winning all your games and joining us in the evil league of evil before too long. Can't have a crowd like that and management like yours and not become championship caliber.  Anyway, you guys are dope. Your club/image is dope. That game was a scrumptious feast for my eyeballs.

OCLions,36b673,Young_Neil_Postman,3,Sun May 17 23:29:11 2015 UTC,Did Kaka really get a yellow after he earned the penalty? It's on bleacher reports stream...but I sure didn't notice that watching from the stadium
OCLions,36b673,nautika,10,Sun May 17 23:48:36 2015 UTC,He got the yellow because he put on a Molino jersey during the celebration. It's a yellow for using a prop.
OCLions,36b673,Young_Neil_Postman,2,Sun May 17 23:56:21 2015 UTC,Thanks! I guess I missed the yellow amidst the celebrations
OCLions,36b673,33str,1 point,Mon May 18 00:18:58 2015 UTC,Anyone know why. Shea pulled up on the break after the 4th goal?  Did he not wanna run up the score or something?
OCLions,36b673,trumpetblast,3,Mon May 18 03:01:02 2015 UTC,It looked like the pace of the ball pulled him back right at the end. That gave the defender just enough time to get between him and the goalie so he figured his best bet was to find a following run like Kaka had been making most of the game.

OCLions,36bfmy,misanthropicbuddha,4,Mon May 18 00:43:52 2015 UTC,It seems Tally Hall should get an N/A.  Never even really tested...at least not in the run of play.
OCLions,36bfmy,mcg1848,1 point,Mon May 18 12:52:36 2015 UTC,His distribution was perfect though. There is a lot more to goalkeeping than just making saves. He had two very nice saves and then he was the leader of that backline keeping them together the whole match. So even though he didn't have to make any amazing saves he was still one of the best/most important players on the field.
OCLions,36bfmy,jmoney0999,2,Mon May 18 15:01:32 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I did enjoy his midfield stretching routine.  Points.
OCLions,36bfmy,mcg1848,2,Mon May 18 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"Kaká definitely was ""Man of the Match."" Solid performance offensively and created a lot of offensive opportunities. Man, what a play to set up Larin."
OCLions,36bfmy,Knightro2011,5,Mon May 18 01:28:46 2015 UTC,Kaka was great but honestly I would go with ceren. He dictated the pace starting many counter attacked and covered so damn well defensively.
OCLions,36bfmy,jmoney0999,5,Mon May 18 01:41:13 2015 UTC,"I was so pumped for him to get a goal.  when he hit the crossbar I was so excited because he really deserved a goal with how hard he has been working.  He has slowly been becoming one of the most important players on our team.  He started out with all of the hustle and strong play we know him for but had a lot of careless giveaways, reckless challenges, etc.  Ceren seems to have calmed down just enough to limit those mistakes but still keep the intensity up all game."

OCLions,36a54b,OrlandoLions64,3,Sun May 17 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"His scoring stats for Houston:    Year Apps Goals    2011 29 5   2012 39 16*   2013 39 8   2014 27 10   2015 11 4    *Dynamo record  Honestly, I'd rather we went elsewhere.  He's a decent striker but he plays in a partnership with Barnes in Houston and if Larin scores once in the next 4 matches they'll be even.  I like the idea of a veteran striker but they'll need to be a significant step up.  We'd probably need to give up a lot to take one of Houston's starting strikers and on top of that he'll have a higher hit on the cap.  I'm still not sold that we need a striker.  Larin has 3 in 7 appearances.  He's on pace for 13 or 14 goals this season (though I doubt he gets there).  If Paterson can contribute during the Gold Cup or if Larin falls out of form we'll be fine.  We need goals from midfield first, specifically a right winger"
OCLions,36bptr,spaliku,4,Mon May 18 02:20:12 2015 UTC,I'm thrilled about the win tonight too but gotta keep expectations in check. We're still an expansion team after all.  Realistically we might make the playoffs. How far we can go there is impossible to tell until the last month or so.  If you mean Supporters Shield there's no way. Too many good teams especially in the west.

These are the banners I made if you were interested for any reason: http://i.imgur.com/d5z7ayl.png  Some are similar to what you have, and obviously it's not usable as-is, but you decided to change them up at all this might make your job easier."
OCLions,367ohv,sgtrama,2,Sun May 17 00:59:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly I'm still going back and forth on whether to use the banner sheet for that wall signage, or to just make it part of the stadium's textures. If it's just included as a texture, it allows me more space for banners (and maybe a higher resolution? I'm not sure if you can have higher resolution banners by default, but I can make those textures any size I want). On the other hand, having them set up to use banners makes the Citrus bowl themed to whatever the home team is.  I also made adboards, but I'm having trouble getting them to work  just for OC."
OCLions,367ohv,sgtrama,2,Sun May 17 01:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, I noticed the Moddingway mod has team-specific ad banners AND they're animated, but I'll be damned if I can find a single person to answer a question about that stuff =\"
OCLions,367ohv,sgtrama,2,Sun May 17 01:25:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm really interested in how animated banners work. I assume it's just exported to like an image sequence packed in an rx3 somehow, but CM 15 doesn't have them and I have no idea what file they are to look for in File Master"
OCLions,367ohv,sgtrama,2,Sun May 17 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"So I got everything loaded up, and seems to be working correctly. Everything looks pretty darn great. The pitch actually looks perfect which made me a little upset that that's what our pitch actually looks like, lol.  A few notes:   It looks like the camera is on the wrong side of the field. As a result the adboards on the back side of the field don't wrap all the way around, and players enter from the adboard side. When the games are aired the supporter section is on the right side of the field, but (I believe) the supporter's section in FIFA is usually on the left, so it may be a design choice. I noticed the away side also had home supporters. I don't know if this is because it was a friendly, or if that was a design choice as well (because it's accurate, lol). I'm not sure if there is supposed to be a sky box or not, but right now the sky is just bright white, and I think it may be effecting the lighting of the entire field? (during the day anyway, untested at night thus far). I noticed some players have black hands.   But again, this looks great. It's super awesome playing in the Citrus Bowl.   Also, on a personal note, I'd like to see supporter banners in the correct places, if only because the mod I use, Moddingway, has all the official supporters banners for all the other teams, and I always that that was cool. HOWEVER you are right in that the Citrus Bowl is branded for Orlando to all hell, and it's pretty cool being able to swap that for another team. In the end that's just me being knit-picky =P"
OCLions,367ohv,TrevenxD,1 point,Mon May 18 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"Wow I've been stressing over whether I've got the adboards in the exact right position and I didn't even notice that the stadium's backwards. I'm not exactly sure how to change the side of the camera, but just rotating the whole stadium 180deg will fix it, and will make the players enter from the other side.  Yeah I'm just not sure where the balance should be between accuracy and actually having any away fans. The version I released doesn't have an actual sky at the moment. I kept having trouble with the sky when I actually added one, but I'm pretty sure I know why now. I have no idea with this one.   I'm definitely going to add actual banners besides those that stretch the whole wall, but that's not my first priority.  Anyways, glad you like it! I think I'll put up a new version in a bit (sometime tomorrow probably) to address a couple of those things"
OCLions,367ohv,spaliku,2,Mon May 18 04:53:59 2015 UTC,"I THINK the hands thing only effects players wearing long sleeves. I don't know if that helps. I noticed when I switched it to summer time and no one was in long sleeves I didn't have the same problem. It could be because I'm switching between a bunch of mods too, though."

OCLions,366ook,secretlyadog,4,Sat May 16 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"While it is click bait its a good quote to have.  It means the ownership is willing to spend more given the chance.  Also the team has always been very tight lipped on saying ANYTHING in regards to transfer rumors.  While this isnt a confirmation its even more sign that they're looking to do something.  With the sounders article that was posted on /r/mls about a probable change in DP rules coming for the summer transfer window, and the large amounts of rumors surrounding the team there is a decent chance we see a big move this summer.  Pato's contract is probably up in the air atm due to his home contract not being renewed and his injuries so i could see them going out for a big name striker to sit in front of Kaka."

I would jizz all over myself like an out of control lawn sprinkler if he actually signed for Orlando... but this is not ""more news"" this is just the same quote as yesterday being milked for more clicks."
OCLions,366ook,babacristo,3,Sat May 16 18:27:29 2015 UTC,I see your point.  Though the thought of anyone jizzing like a lawn sprinkler would be an amazing sight.

OCLions,366due,paintballpmd,1 point,Sat May 16 16:24:17 2015 UTC,Any news on Hines or possibly even Donovan?
OCLions,366due,TheBrutalLad,2,Sat May 16 22:56:27 2015 UTC,"Donovan's in New Zealand, Hines is probable, Redding has a knee issue I believe"
OCLions,366due,logjam13,2,Sun May 17 02:00:43 2015 UTC,Well fuck us then. This shall be interesting
OCLions,364t21,Semco14,14,Sat May 16 03:36:20 2015 UTC,Kaka has looked awful at least the last three games but it gets over shadowed by even worse play from others.  I really wonder how much of it is fatigue from the season?  He has already played 892 out of 900 total minutes this season and along with Ricketts the only one to play in all 10 MLS games for Orlando.  Unless his legs are broken there is no chance of him missing a home game if ownership can help it.  He needs a rest and not sure when he will get it.
OCLions,364t21,pvdfan,7,Sat May 16 09:28:46 2015 UTC,"Doesnt help that Molino .. who would be a good replacement for him in the CM position is now out.  I believe at least in early practice Ribeiro was also playing that position.  Injuries are absolutely murdering us.  I feel like Kaka is a perfect embodiment of the team right now.  They've shown us their brilliance, we know what they CAN do, but when it counts they have been letting us down.  This game tomorrow is going to be huge.  A win at home against the Galaxy would be a HUGE spark for both the team and the fans.  Another loss on the otherhand is going to make life rough trying to make the playoffs."
OCLions,364t21,spikebaylor,3,Sat May 16 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"This is it. Right here. At the start of the season Kaká and the team were so full of attacking promise, they just needed to keep shots down and on frame.  Now... everything looks so disjointed.   Hopefully they can recover from these injuries sooner rather than later, get us a few wins, and keep in playoff contention."
OCLions,364t21,secretlyadog,5,Sat May 16 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"I was watching him off-ball last game because he hasn't been very involved in the offense recently and I noticed he's being double-marked often making it tougher to get him the ball and for him to use it when he's got it.  It should make our attack easier, but we just don't have that creative spark outside of Kaka. No one can step in and distribute like he was and we aren't using the space he's providing. He still leads chances created this season by 30+ and he hasn't gotten very many in the last few matches..."
OCLions,364t21,logjam13,2,Sat May 16 15:44:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's getting easier for teams to double mark Kaka since nobody else has stepped up to scare them off doing so.  I really think we NEED to have an attacking minded RM and LM in the game at the same time.  Not once this whole season thus far have we been able to do so as it was typically Neal & Molino, Avila & Molino and now Avila and Shea and each case only one of those Mids is a real threat in the attack (Shea & Monlino).  With Avila in there, teams just won't even worry about him and in the 1st half of the DC game, Avila was dropping back to cover for Ramos to overlap in the attack.  I really want to see Rivas get the nod and play a full game, we need someone who yes may make some crazy plays sometimes but can also make space for Kaka to do what he can do... without that, teams are just going to stick a DM on Kaka and then then double him with a 2nd defender whether he has the ball or not."
OCLions,364t21,j_andrew_h,2,Sat May 16 16:58:07 2015 UTC,Twellman has been silenced.
OCLions,364t21,Trollsauce27,2,Mon May 18 04:19:15 2015 UTC,"The advanced stats I have seen say otherwise, He is actually in contention for league MVP right now. Not based on Goals and Assists but chances created, He is a midfielder and his teammates are mentally slower than he is in reading the game. Their touches are heavier and they don't make runs at the right moments. He is also being double and triple teamed but the others cant take advantage. Take Kaka out and replace him with MLS average at his position and you have a 8 or 9 loss team."
OCLions,365rs1,misanthropicbuddha,5,Sat May 16 12:20:03 2015 UTC,Feel bad for turner in that situation. Young kid playing completely out of position with little to no warmup even. While his score accurately displays his play I just think it might hurt his confidence a bit.
OCLions,365rs1,jmoney0999,1 point,Sat May 16 14:04:10 2015 UTC,yeah that was the worst sub i've seen heath make all season
OCLions,365rs1,babacristo,1 point,Sat May 16 21:28:50 2015 UTC,To his defense I don't think he had any other options to sub in. Would make more sense to put turner on the left and move Boden centrally seeing he has more size and experience.
OCLions,365rs1,jmoney0999,2,Sat May 16 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"the Boden move would have been good-- not sure how recovered Hines was by this game, but including him for the bench even if he wasn't 100% would have been a smart move, especially with Collin who finds himself being taken off more often than average. hindsight is 20/20 though, it just feels like if he had to play someone out of position, it probably should have been anyone else besides a rookie. it also feels like we're getting hit with so much early bad luck. so many unavailable players could have made a difference here. having Okugo would have been huge, and I'd love to see him on CB for at least one game this season."
OCLions,365rs1,babacristo,2,Sat May 16 23:36:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind seeing okugo at cb tomorrow. He hasn't performed to great the last two matches
OCLions,365rs1,jmoney0999,3,Sun May 17 00:50:26 2015 UTC,I am guessing this is like the Football manager system?  Can't Ricketts had a decent aside from the goals but the defense is as much at fault.
OCLions,365rs1,beefat99,4,Sat May 16 12:23:31 2015 UTC,"Ricketts at times shows his old self.  The one save midway through the second half was great.  But i watch these other teams and they all have defensive lapses occasionally and their goalie is there to block the shot or close down the one on one.  I dont ever expect that from Ricketts anymore.  If the other team gets a clear shot off and its on goal.. im just expecting it to go in at this point.  He is very slow to react.  If teams watch our games close enough what they're going to find is that all they need to do is get a well placed shot with medium pace to the opposite side or ricketts and he's not going to make it.  Our defense has had some major screw up that lead to goals, yes, but id counter that if you take those major fuck ups and set plays out of the equation we have only had like 5-6 legit shots on goal taken against us in the run of play.  That is a testament to how good our defense is 98% of the match.  Im afraid if there are more shots on target... MUCH more goals will be scored against us."
OCLions,365rs1,spikebaylor,3,Sat May 16 13:59:15 2015 UTC,"Quite harsh but mostly deserved ratings.  Man the move to Orlando has been amazing for Collin.  I watched SKC a lot last year and he looked good but was really losing it towards the end of the season.  Besler's fatigue and injuries didnt help but Collin was also looking bad.  This year he has been absolutely amazing.  Even in the NYC game he looked great.  Reckless tackle, worthy of a red yes, but easily a yellow by some other referee's standards.  He has matured since then and really has been a leader in what is (save for the few terrible momentary lapses of judgement) a pretty solid back line."

A bunch of us here have told you we look forward to them and we appreciate what you do. I've been subscribed to /r/soundersfc for years, and I'm pretty sure they don't have someone doing these every week. Many times your posters get cross posted to the other team's sub or even /r/MLS. Your contributions have definitely been just one more source of pride for many of us.  I also really like the idea of incorporating Ruckus and ILF(hopefully assuming)."
OCLions,35ziq4,Whudevs,3,Fri May 15 17:59:17 2015 UTC,"I intend to don't worry. I have some other local artists I have tapped so there might be more in the works not just matchday posters. I am also thinking that I will somehow ""creatively"" remove any licensing concerns from mine (or at least make two version) and offer the other up for print on Etsy or something. Ironically I know the guy who actually did the printing of all these lol. I have had a few people want to buy them, but since I am using copyrighted logo's most places wont print without permission. So the images I upload are large enough at 300 dpi someone could print on their own. Since OCSC is doing their own and never recognized any one that I have done, I doubt I would get their permission to use the logo lol. Like I said, time to pivot.

OCLions,35ywuc,daguru9,12,Thu May 14 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Ramos playing right mid, where his height wouldn't be such a disadvantage and his attacking ability would be put to greater use.  We could then use Avila, who's not a bad defender but worthless on the attack, at RB where he played for Chivas.  Seems like a much better disposition of resources."
OCLions,35ywuc,74656638,7,Thu May 14 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually said this but I've absolutely felt this for a while now. Since Heath seems to be in love with starting Avila over Rivas, at least keep him back and let Ramos not have to run the whole field so much"
OCLions,35ywuc,zrowny,2,Thu May 14 20:29:07 2015 UTC,I thought about this a few weeks ago when Molino first went down.... very interesting idea...
OCLions,35ywuc,Thricey,2,Thu May 14 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"But if we take Avila out of midfield, who will pass the ball sideways every time???"

OCLions,35ywuc,spikebaylor,14,Thu May 14 18:08:10 2015 UTC,Rightfully so.  Its exhausting as a fan watching what is an exceptional team randomly throw the game away week after week.  I cant imagine what that is like for Heath.

OCLions,35y43w,2ndgoround,5,Thu May 14 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if Adrian calls me up, here's my starting XI:  GK Edwards DF - Ramos - Okugo - St. Ledger - Boden DM - Ceren AM - Rivas - Kaka - Shea FW - Larin - Mwanga"
OCLions,35y43w,74656638,3,Thu May 14 14:44:25 2015 UTC,That's a huge loss for us. Hopefully Hines is fit for Saturday.
OCLions,35y43w,jmoney0999,3,Thu May 14 14:16:22 2015 UTC,Okugo can certainly play back there and played CB for Philly last season; but obviously it would be great to have Hines with Colin out like this.
OCLions,35y43w,j_andrew_h,2,Thu May 14 18:07:35 2015 UTC,Hearing Hines will go and Okugo is back from suspension so that helps.  Not sure if Okuogo drops back and plays CB or they try Boden there with Shea slotting back at LB.  Can't see them starting Turner there after last night.
OCLions,35y43w,j_andrew_h,2,Thu May 14 14:29:12 2015 UTC,Turner at CB was an emergency that had almost zero chance of success.  It will either be Hines with St. Ledger or St. Ledger with Okugo if Hines isn't healthy.  Ramos and Boden should stay in their positions at RB & LB respectively.
OCLions,35xtqx,daguru9,5,Thu May 14 12:31:15 2015 UTC,All part of Ian Fuller's master plan to make his grand return and win the league.

OCLions,35wfev,secretlyadog,3,Thu May 14 05:59:07 2015 UTC,Can I change my society 21 reward to back up striker?
OCLions,35wfev,pvdfan,14,Thu May 14 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"We probably could've hung on if Collin didn't get injured. I just don't feel Turner is quality enough.  On the other hand, Heath had a great game after a shaky start. Would not mind seeing more of him.  Also we desperately need Tally Hall. Ricketts seems out of position way more than he should."
OCLions,35wfev,njunk,15,Thu May 14 02:03:17 2015 UTC,"Turner wasn't good... but he's like 19 years old playing out of position against some grown ass men.  Yes we need Hall for sure, we need a lot of things right now... mainly healthy players."

OCLions,35wfev,5heepdawg,12,Thu May 14 02:19:54 2015 UTC,"Looked great in the first half after our typical 10 mins or so of waking up.    Heath looked good in his start,  nothing exceptional but fairly solid.    Ceren looked pretty solid once again.  He plays like a tank sometimes but i think that builds some intimidation and allows him to win a lot of 50/50s.  Cyle looked great first half.. not so much second but i dont blame him too much as neither did the rest of the team.  St leger looked solid enough.. certainly ok to sub in for hines when needed.  Kaka.. wtf? Such a great start to the season but he has not been himself the past few games.  He has made more silly mistakes than almost anyone on the team the past few weeks.  Shea did decent not his best game though.  Boden had another solid performance.  Not as good as last week but still not bad.  I like Turner but he's not ready for MLS and certainly has no business playing CB, but thats not his fault.  Hall cant get back fast enough.  At this point id rather see Edwards Jr in goal.  Rivas needs to start.  He gets subbed in with 10 mins left and he gets wild and overexcited trying to perform in his limited minutes.  He needs a chance to settle down and get into a rhythm."
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,6,Thu May 14 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"That last point about Rivas is so true...  He really needs to start over Avila...  We have nothing to loose..  Unless we're about to get a healthy attacking RM back from injury that I don't know about, we need to start the Rivas to starting RM project now."
OCLions,35wfev,j_andrew_h,6,Thu May 14 02:51:03 2015 UTC,"Kaka.. wtf? Such a great start to the season but he has not been himself the past few games. He has made more silly mistakes than almost anyone on the team the past few weeks.   I completely agree. I counted at least 3 times he tried to steal the ball, from his own player, and only ended up giving it away to United after colliding/entangling with his teammate. He also seems to be severely lacking in the hustle department.  Our team has a huge problem of solo players; we don't behave like a cohesive unit out there on the field. People are trying to play Kaka instead of looking for another player who might be open, or they're trying to dribble instead of passing out to the flanks to spread the field and send in a cross."
OCLions,35wfev,EASports_MUT,5,Thu May 14 13:56:45 2015 UTC,What is truly amazing is Kaka is getting pissed to the point of screaming anytime someone doesn't pass to him and there was a quater of an inch of space.  Heath has got to get a grip on Kaka or risk losing the entire team.
OCLions,35wfev,pvdfan,2,Thu May 14 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"One of the times he yelled he was justified (the 4 on 3 where we did eventually put it out wide but only after our winger was offsides) but, yeah, it's a bit over the top. I don't know how much Heath can do considering he (Kaka) is great friends with the owner."
OCLions,35wfev,EASports_MUT,3,Thu May 14 14:30:45 2015 UTC,Lol i watched for a good long couple seconds as Kaka plowed right into Ceren.  It felt like slow-mo and i was thinking why is kaka headed right into ceren? And then Bam!
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,2,Thu May 14 14:38:40 2015 UTC,Which sucked because it was on a good breakaway opportunity too!
OCLions,35wfev,EASports_MUT,11,Thu May 14 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"People keep blaming Ricketts for tonight, but I am not of the same opinion. Could he have done better? Definitely. However, the extreme lack of possession we had the second half and the amount of times we let DC setup was ridiculous.   It's like the saying, throw enough darts at a board and inevitably you'll hit a bullseye. We let them throw way to many darts."
OCLions,35wfev,Owtlaw1,5,Thu May 14 04:51:24 2015 UTC,"I dont think most people put 100% of the blame on Ricketts for any goals this year.  All except for maybe 3 or 4 goals against us this year have come off terrible mistakes and giveaways or lack luster defending on set pieces.    That being said, a better goal keeper would have stopped quite a few of those despite the lapse in defense.  Ricketts has a very small amount of saves this year which is mostly a testament to how well our defense DOES do when they're not making the one or two terrible mistakes per game.  But even then, almost every shot on target ends up making it to the back of the net.  He shows flashes of his former self.  He had a very nice save last night, but the majority of the time he is slow, indecisive, cant hold on to the ball, terrible confidance with the ball at his feet (which is ok since he's a GK but i cringe every time we pass it back to him), and again its hard to tell without them being mic'd, but when the defense keeps making bad mistakes in our third SOME of that is on the GK for not communicating better."
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,1 point,Thu May 14 11:50:40 2015 UTC,"Not to be a Ricketts defender (he's been just ok), but I think organizing this back line has to be a challenge with the languages.  I realize they all speak English, but having native Spanish, French, and English speakers has to play a part."
OCLions,35wfev,mcg1848,4,Thu May 14 13:07:56 2015 UTC,"Its a fair assessment but ramos and collin speak perfectly decent english.. certainly good enough for ""football talk"".  You'd have a better argument with guys up front like higuita, rivas and rochez who i havent seen speak english at all.  But language barriers can certainly be an issue especially in the heat of battle."
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,7,Thu May 14 14:36:33 2015 UTC,Injuries and expansion seasons. Just fuck.
OCLions,35wfev,Generalparks,6,Thu May 14 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"Kaka seemed to get frustrated early on to the point where he wasn't trying as hard later in the game. He just seemed to disappear for much of the second half. Turner obviously got put in a tough spot playing out of his normal position, however, his composure and positioning have made me nervous as well in previous games. I like to think if he weren't traveling with the U20s, Donovan would have replaced Collin. I also thought Shea was finding himself in the middle of the park too much. I think he's obviously best out wide and him getting stuck in the middle was clustering people together too much and not leaving room for Kaka to create sometimes. We need to learn to ply a full 90, but I think we definitely have good soccer ahead of us."

OCLions,35wfev,OCSC407,3,Thu May 14 02:10:03 2015 UTC,It doesnt help him playing out of position either.  Why did we bring Hines if he wasnt going to go in for the center back?  And where is Redding?  Hes young too but at least its his position.
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,1 point,Thu May 14 02:16:09 2015 UTC,The claim has been Redding is injured.
OCLions,35wfev,pvdfan,1 point,Thu May 14 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"No argument about Hines, Redding was not on the bench. We only had 6 subs available, Rivas (banged up), Hines, Edwards, Turner, Rochez, and Mwanga."
OCLions,35wfev,OCSC407,1 point,Thu May 14 02:25:41 2015 UTC,Yeah i was wondering why he wasnt on the bench.. sounds like maybe injury.  there were a lot of things i was worried about coming into preseason/season but this many injuries was not one of them.
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,2,Thu May 14 02:47:50 2015 UTC,Hines may have been a game time decision on if he was okay to go... they obviously didn't think he should play or he would have been in when Colin went down.  Turner was put in a terrible position last night; but there was literally nobody else.
OCLions,35wfev,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu May 14 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"He probably would have gone had they not had two games this week.  As it was though, Tenorio was tweeting that he never even moved off the bench.  Definitely could have used Donovan last night.    This was always going to be a tough stretch of matches though."
OCLions,35wfev,mcg1848,2,Thu May 14 13:34:35 2015 UTC,I suspect that if last night was a playoff game then Hines plays in that situation; but it sounds like he needed to not play last night.
OCLions,35wfev,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu May 14 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"And as it turns out, Hines was not available either due to quad injury."

OCLions,35wfev,zrowny,3,Thu May 14 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"Yet another game we control, only to slip in the closing minutes. Frustrating as hell."
OCLions,35wfev,hocci,12,Thu May 14 02:03:10 2015 UTC,We controlled most of the 1st half; but certainly not the 2nd.
OCLions,35wfev,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu May 14 02:11:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Some teams, much like ours tonight, can't seem to carry their great momentum through that extended break and into a new half. Without a doubt, we need to retain our energy instead of having it lost after that halftime whistle blows."
OCLions,35wfev,hocci,1 point,Thu May 14 02:13:45 2015 UTC,"I do think our offensive substitutions should have come earlier.. We needed an offensive spark to keep DC under some pressure and we didn't bring in Rochez or Rivas until very late... we didn't have any defensive players to sub in, to go on the attack!"
OCLions,35wfev,j_andrew_h,5,Thu May 14 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"After watching that game I am left questioning Heath. One, what is his obsession with Avila?? I mean he offered absolutely nothing going forward tonight and all the previous matches when he has gotten the start. Second, I know there are injuries and it was very unlucky that Collin went down but as a Manager you have to go over every possible scenario and have a plan. To put Turner at Center Half is absolutely an appalling decision I personally feel. Not only is his natural position a Full back, but he is 19! You can't just throw a kid in the deep end it will ruin his confidence. Finally, we play out from the back and maintain possession but for what purpose? We can't do jack with the ball! Our only goal was really from a broken set piece not really drawn up and planned. We only had ONE shot on target. I am not going to jump all over his back and call for his head because I am a firm believer in managerial stability but come on Heath this is not USL anymore we cannot bully teams by keeping possession non stop we actually have to do something with the ball. When does the time come when he needs to scrap the team plans and start over?"
OCLions,35wfev,rynbelz,2,Thu May 14 02:10:02 2015 UTC,"You're questioning the coach for putting in Turner; but we litterally did not have another healthy defender ready to go.  We are riddled with injuries right now.  Both Donovan and Redding weren't even on the bench and they are are next two CBs.  You points on playing out the back and possession are meaningless when it comes to finishing... our inability to finish in the final 3rd has nothing to do with possession style soccer but if you notice, when we do play longball and go for the big play.... we SUCK and just give the ball back quickly.    We just don't have the players right now to play the way we need to... some of that is we have young players that just likely weren't ready for prime time yet but were expected to develop playing behind a Vet but have had to play now due to injuries.    I think with Avila coach is playing it safe; but I also think the problem is that if we don't start Avila and start Rivas instead.. if we're down late in a game, who comes in to provide a spark?  We sadly have no bench right now; so while I'm 100% with you on Avila being ineffective going forward, I'm not sure what we can do other then hope that guys like Neal & Cascio can get healthy or we cut them (or loan out all of our ""kids"") and bring in some players from like the English Championship or something... not DPs but quality guys that can at least play and aren't so green as our young guys."
OCLions,35wfev,j_andrew_h,2,Thu May 14 13:09:13 2015 UTC,"We could have easily put Turner in at LB and slid Boden to the middle. Even Taylor Twellman was left shaking his head at Heath's decision to put Turner at CB. Why? Because Turner has no experience at the Highest level. So why throw him into the mix and ask him to do a job over his head?   And my comments are not pointless on possession and playing out from the back. When you maintain possession you have to create chances and if you go back and re watch the game we were not creating any chances. We had 7 shots all from outside the box including the goal on the edge of the box which was our only shot on target. And no crossing the ball to the front/back post are not chances if they are dealt with by the defending team. Passing out from the back all second half allowed DC United to maintain pressure all second half in our final third. Think about it, it is worse to lose the ball closer to the goal then way down field and we certainty were losing the ball close to goal all second half. Saying we don't have the players to play our style is not the way it is supposed to work. Every great manager in the world when asked that question says you have to choose your style according to your players not the other way around. And like you said we don't have the players to play that style we want to play.  Heath could be playing it safe with Avila but why? We aren't in a position to be playing it safe! I mean the Avila situation is a whole other problem and you are right saying we have no bench because we don't. Depth wins trophies and that is exactly what is happening. Not saying anyone really had hope of winning one our first season, but we shouldn't just blame all our problems on new expansion season and injury crisis because all clubs have injuries not just ours (Not saying you were blaming it on that)."
OCLions,35wfev,rynbelz,2,Thu May 14 14:35:44 2015 UTC,"We could have easily put Turner in at LB and slid Boden to the middle. Even Taylor Twellman was left shaking his head at Heath's decision to put Turner at CB. Why? Because Turner has no experience at the Highest level. So why throw him into the mix and ask him to do a job over his head?   Because Luke is a former midfielder turned fullback who has never played CB and Tyler has played a lot of CB - just not at this level. If you thought Turner was bad, Boden would have been worse due to general lack of knowledge about the position"

OCLions,35wfev,logjam13,4,Thu May 14 13:43:32 2015 UTC,Tale of two halves.  The team just gave up in the second before Collin's injury and went downhill from there.  We are completely fucked during the international call-ups.
OCLions,35wfev,pvdfan,3,Thu May 14 02:07:32 2015 UTC,The only games ive seen where we had two identical halves have been clb and tor where we sucked the entire game.  Even our early games where we played well it was still a sizeable difference between the first and second half.
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,2,Thu May 14 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"So was Hine's injured today? Because I was a little confused when Turner came on instead of Hine's after the injury to Collin. Turner is fine as a full back, but as a CB he looked god awful tonight."
OCLions,35wfev,TheBrutalLad,2,Thu May 14 03:30:47 2015 UTC,I couldnt hear to well in the bar but it sounded like he wasnt fit/healthy.  My guess is he was sick.  Doesnt make sense to bring him if he wasnt going to at least sub in for a CB.  I guess either he was sick and it got worse while in DC or a small injury he received in training up there.
OCLions,35wfev,spikebaylor,1 point,Thu May 14 11:52:33 2015 UTC,They probably brought him hoping he could go... but decided he couldn't/shouldn't play near the last minute.  As for why he was on the bench when he couldn't play.. don't know but there was room enough on the bench since we have so few players right now.

Kaka does not have the influence he should in midfield. The announcers even commented on the lack of touches he had. We do not have an identity yet. Just when we start to figure something out, we have the unfortunate luck of a key injury."

OCLions,35vz7b,logjam13,2,Thu May 14 01:42:59 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the mystery as controlling the game.  With possession, we can dictate tempo and basically wait for the opponent to make a mistake/one of our guys to make the right run into space.  The short passing game we play is more efficient at keeping possession than long balls to open space like you see in a lot of MLS/some English soccer"
OCLions,35vz7b,5heepdawg,3,Thu May 14 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"See that is where I am confused.  Ever since OCSC I have watched soccer on TV.  What I have seen is exactly what you speak of.  OCSC never has the amazing behind the pack pass, the awesomely deceptive cross.  I have seen it AGAINST OCSC, but never do they pull it off(most likely wrong on my part), but it seems like OCSC gets beat a lot, and their aggressive, no holds barre dis nice for goals, but it doesn't hold/spark a lot of leads.  DC sound of the game is crap.  The Citrus Bowl isn't even our stadium and Orlando rocks it.  How this team is in the lead with lackluster enthusiasm can only lead me to believe we got complacent?  Plus the injury.  I don't know.  I am so conflicted loving the Lions when my heart bleeds most games than not.  I feel like we really needed this road win.  So much emphasis on Home wins(then people discount the Friendly) and we draw first blood on the road, and at the time of SUBMIT, we are losing.    Well we lost.  Damn."
OCLions,35vz7b,logjam13,3,Thu May 14 01:59:30 2015 UTC,"Well, this season was always going to be a rough one.  Just a couple things going against us:  8 guys are from a different country since January  19 are from a different league (no MLS experience)  17 are in a new city and a new system  17 are 24 or younger (10 under 21), making us one of the youngest teams in MLS.  I think Montreal is the only team younger  Add on the fact that 8 have had lasting injuries and 4 were starters (not including Collin now), we're pretty much fucked on paper.  Young team, a fair amount speak English as at least a second language, and almost all of them learning a new system.  We'll get better as the season goes on but injuries have hampered our already young and inexperienced squad.  We break on the road and at home because of all of these things"

OCLions,35vz7b,5heepdawg,2,Thu May 14 11:38:08 2015 UTC,Like logjam said. Paterson was basically supposed to start for the first few months to give rochez/larin time to adjust to the league and then basically hand it off the those two. We were basically forced to skip that step and honestly now there is no point in starting Paterson over either of the other 2
OCLions,35vz7b,spikebaylor,2,Thu May 14 00:58:52 2015 UTC,I assumed the goal wasn't counting with the way they reacted  Edit: Parent comment was criticizing the lifeless announcers
OCLions,35vz7b,5heepdawg,2,Thu May 14 00:29:37 2015 UTC,Cyle Larin has that HUNGER!!!!  Holy smokes!  I'm sayin' 2 tonight!
OCLions,35vz7b,5heepdawg,2,Thu May 14 00:33:31 2015 UTC,He is looking good.. the goal aside.. he's chased down and won quite a few balls that DC took for granted.  We failed to do anything with it.. but still shows some good hustle

I am no Soccer guru, but haven't missed a game(one on Real Radio I had to listen to in South Florida), and this game looks nice to me.  The Lions are hungry, time to eat!

OCLions,35uctl,ichinii,8,Wed May 13 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"Very cool and I hope you have a great trip down!  If you don't have a car, I'd go with Uber to get downtown (if you're comfortable with the cost).  Getting to the game shouldn't be a problem and you can either go downtown and party around Church Street Station with OCSC fan at bars and then take a free bus over to the stadium or you can have the Uber driver take you right to the stadium if you would prefer to tailgate or eat/drink at the food truck area next to the stadium.      After the game, you may want to take the free bus back to downtown and pick up an Uber driver there.  The traffic around the stadium will be packed and a driver will take forever to get in there to pick you up (personal experience).  So head back downtown on the free buses and get a driver from there which there will be plenty around downtown."
OCLions,35uctl,j_andrew_h,2,Wed May 13 17:03:38 2015 UTC,I will do this. Thank you very much. See you guys on Sunday.
OCLions,35uctl,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu May 14 14:02:35 2015 UTC,Great!  Good luck and have a great Sunday & vacation overall.
OCLions,35uctl,cwinn13,2,Thu May 14 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"It can be tough to Uber in right to the Citrus Bowl if you don't already know which streets are closed and have the driver avoid those. If you've got the time, definitely hit up downtown and take the free shuttle bus over. Just ask the driver to drop you off at Church St. Similarly, it would be tough to get an Uber to pickup at the CB after, as there may be 50K people in that area trying to leave. My advice would be to take the shuttle back, have a few drinks downtown and then Uber back from there."
OCLions,35uctl,Ralston_Cove,2,Thu May 14 13:02:28 2015 UTC,This will be my plan and I can't wait to have a great time. I'll even be in purple lol
OCLions,35tybb,daguru9,1 point,Wed May 13 14:13:48 2015 UTC,If my daughter (currently U9) continues into competitive soccer; we're going to have to see if we can get her into OCSC's ECNL program (if she makes it of course).  The coaching they have been adding appears to be just awesome.    I'm really hoping they plan on created a pro women's team in the next few years as well.
OCLions,35tybb,j_andrew_h,3,Wed May 13 15:04:00 2015 UTC,I think a lot of fans and supporters would love for them to create a pro women's team here locally...
OCLions,35tybb,j_andrew_h,2,Wed May 13 15:15:10 2015 UTC,Once the stadium is done (and assuming the women's league is doing well enough) I think we'll see a women's pro team here in Orlando.

OCLions,35r5he,logjam13,9,Tue May 12 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"I suspect with the 3 games in a short span, we may see Rochez may start up top before heading off to a camp for Honduras."
OCLions,35r5he,j_andrew_h,4,Tue May 12 20:51:50 2015 UTC,Thinking the same.  Id like to see him get the start against DC.  Then we can always go back to Larin for LA so its a more familiar squad going into the 3rd game in 9 days against the reigning champs.  Then hopefully see Paterson make a late sub appearance and burying the game winner (or maybe just an extra one for good measure).
OCLions,35r5he,spikebaylor,2,Tue May 12 20:54:37 2015 UTC,Exactly!
OCLions,35r5he,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue May 12 23:07:44 2015 UTC,Everything you said would make me so happy !
OCLions,35r5he,jmoney0999,6,Tue May 12 23:16:40 2015 UTC,"Would be great if we could get Ribero healthy but that doesn't look to happen. I think Orlando could get a win because:   They need a dub. They have won on the road before. (Portland) which is a tough environment  to play in from what I'm told. Revenge. They lost 1-0 last time to a et goal. Cyle Larin has been good and Brek in the middle will help with offense. Kaka is also back in Brazil squad so he will have that helping him to keep him confident and maybe he'll get creative.   I run orlandocitylionsfc.com and thought this would be a good way to get it out there. I'm new to reddit, this is actually my first post... anyways, hope you check it out and I hope to learn more about reddit. If you have any tips for me feel free to reply:)"
OCLions,35r5he,Filipovski,5,Wed May 13 01:07:45 2015 UTC,Brek Shea is on four yellows. I hope he stays out of trouble so he'll be available this Sunday
OCLions,35r5he,-kemosabe,2,Wed May 13 01:47:23 2015 UTC,So what does Rivas have to do to start over Avila for once; he offers is width and great energy bursting down the wings.
OCLions,35r5he,TheBrutalLad,4,Tue May 12 23:39:51 2015 UTC,Learn to play on the right. He's left footed and wouldn't be able to play the same game
OCLions,35r5he,TheBrutalLad,2,Wed May 13 01:52:28 2015 UTC,"I mean if he were to play on the right and cut in, it wouldn't be any different to anyone we have played on the wings before minus Brek last week. All of our wide players seem to cut in and play inverted rather than taking on their full back and getting crosses in. But tbh at this moment in time I don't see what Heath sees in Avila besides maybe him taking a corner or two, so I mean it is worth a shot."
OCLions,35r5he,spikebaylor,1 point,Wed May 13 03:25:37 2015 UTC,"Oh no I think Avila is a sub at best and I wish we could play Carlos, and I agree that cutting in would make him more dangerous. I just think it's the opposite of how he plays on the left and he'd need to work at it before earning a starting role"

But yeah, if loud and roudy is what you are looking for, the supporters end is the place to be.    On that, ive been really impressed with the Ruckus and ILF so far this year.  Dont hear anything anymore about internal issues or bickering between groups.  They seem to have taken the spirit of The Wall to heart and it shows.  We hear you loud and clear on the far side of the stadium, and i always rewatch home games and you always come through in the broadcasts with so much energy. So thank you for doing what you do."

I don't have the knee for standing/jumping for 90 minutes and I take my 9 year old to most games so the south end isn't for me; but I love what they bring to the stadium and recommend it to anyone looking for that type of energy.
OCLions,35qmu7,j_andrew_h,4,Tue May 12 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good point - you definitely don't want to be bringing children to the Supporter's Section. Like half of our chants have cursing (although the lyrics you'll find written out are generally censored to something milder), and there's a lot of other cursing (like the ""You fucked up!"" and ""You fucked up again!"" we did last game) or general rudeness (the ""let 'em die"" chant after an opponent gets injured actually bothers me off a little)"
OCLions,35qmu7,zrowny,3,Tue May 12 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seeing as people have died on the pitch it seems a bit much. I mean yeah if a guy goes down soft and its obvious hell be ok thats slightly better, but still."

If you're looking for a particularly roudy time id suggest the Ruckus or ILF's official watch locations (i forget them off the top of my head but should be easy to find).  Ive been to Harry Buffalo a few times before or after home games and they'd be an ok place to watch it too, but i keep having bad experiences with service there (in their defense its always been particularly packed)."

OCLions,35oczt,taylor314gh,1 point,Tue May 12 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"I don't like the ""lions"" part, should just be Orlando City or Orlando City Soccer Club. You didn't use ""D.C. United Eagles"". That, and the background picture doesn't make much sense. I do like the style of the poster, though."
OCLions,35oczt,spikebaylor,3,Tue May 12 12:24:27 2015 UTC,Agree with the Lions part.  The background though... its like a dystopian.. ruined DC with crumbling washington monument.  Feels like it fits to me.
OCLions,35oczt,taylor314gh,1 point,Tue May 12 12:49:51 2015 UTC,"Why a dystopian DC? I highly doubt soccer would go on in that environment, and there is no indication that OCSC is causing it (which would make more sense). Also, the color scheme and clean look of the poster would be better fit with just a normal shot of the capitol or maybe a picture of the Lincoln Memorial with a lion sitting on the chair instead of Lincoln."
OCLions,35oczt,spikebaylor,3,Tue May 12 12:56:17 2015 UTC,Eh i think i saw where OP was going with it.  I agree overall it doesnt work.  I do like the idea of the lion on the Lincoln Monument!
OCLions,35oczt,taylor314gh,2,Tue May 12 14:13:42 2015 UTC,"I had similar ideas, but my method of construction was not fitting well and it didn't look right. I also had the monument covered in purple as well. I didn't give myself enough time is really what happened. I'm happy that some like it and I understand some don't get it."
OCLions,35oczt,taylor314gh,2,Tue May 12 16:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, had a feeling I missed on this one. DC had a lot of fan related imagery I probably could have played off of. There was not much in relation to RFK stadium however that it sits in light of sight with the Washington monument. My though was DC would be wrecked after we come through. I honestly should have said ""it is what is it"" and missed doing one for this week. Lesson learned. If you're not feeling it, odds are others won't. I had the feeling but posted anyway. Good feedback, all valid, downvote me to hell and I will deliver with a solid Orlando/Galaxy poster. (Not Star Wars related). Cheers and again thanks for feedback."

OCLions,35nt0m,misanthropicbuddha,2,Tue May 12 00:46:37 2015 UTC,Looks pretty damn good to me.  Definitely felt that Higuita and Rochez had an impact...hope they're getting into form so that they can start being regulars.
OCLions,35nt0m,74656638,2,Tue May 12 14:30:46 2015 UTC,"Having three solid DMs battling for two positions is a great problem to have.  So far this season we've seen Okugo with either Higuita or Ceren; but I really liked Higuita & Ceren together.  They both offered more going forward while it didn't look like they gave up anything in defense.    I like Okugo and I still think he's the main #8 to protect the back line; but when we need to get forward more, we can see this combination as a viable option."
OCLions,35nt0m,j_andrew_h,2,Tue May 12 14:48:37 2015 UTC,Jeez I feel a 5 for Ricketts is pretty harsh considering neither goal was really his fault. Okugo gave the ball away easy for the first goal and Ramos kind of left him out to dry on the second. Other than that New England only had two shots on target so Ricketts wasn't really tested/didn't have much to do.
OCLions,35nt0m,rynbelz,3,Tue May 12 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"I think the consensus is Ricketts isnt doing a good enough job commanding the back line.  Its speculation of course since we cant hear but there seems to be a large amount of miscommunication or lack of communication entirely between Ricketts and the guys in front.  The announcers on friday talked about it a bit.  From where Ramos was he probably didnt see the rev player at all so thought he was doing a harmless back pass.  Ricketts on the other hand did know and should have told him to clear it.  Honestly with as little time that is spent in our 18 there is an absurd amount of bad decisions, miscommunication, slow reflexes etc going on.  The person who should be looked at first for this is the GK."

OCLions,35cun7,AdolfTheBenevolent,6,Sat May 9 02:14:39 2015 UTC,I was happy with the way our boys played through their mistakes and a yellow card happy ref and kept it together and fought for those goals.  That showed they are coming together as a team even further and they were literally fighting for each other and all of us in the stands.
OCLions,35cun7,j_andrew_h,15,Sat May 9 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"Poor first half. Much better second half. Avila was pretty poor. Glad he got taken off.  Progress, I guess. Better home performance than we've been giving. Wish we could score in play on top of just set pieces."
OCLions,35cun7,burajin,10,Sat May 9 02:12:22 2015 UTC,They scored off of two stupid mistakes. We could have won this game if we didn't have such a poor first half. Need to be much more consistent.
OCLions,35cun7,whtge8,7,Sat May 9 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"I like Avila's versatility and his corners from the right are good,  but he doesn't give us anything in attack while playing an attacking position. We either need to get Rivas ready to play 90 minutes in midfield or we're going to need to bring in a right mid this summer."
OCLions,35cun7,j_andrew_h,14,Sat May 9 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"*exhales. We scored some goals!   Also, what was the ref thinking when he called Rochez for that foul? He was clear on goal."
OCLions,35cun7,catch_th3m_all,7,Sat May 9 02:47:38 2015 UTC,That was a really stupid call IMO.
OCLions,35cun7,djveneko,10,Sat May 9 02:57:58 2015 UTC,In everyone's opinion!
OCLions,35cun7,catch_th3m_all,4,Sat May 9 02:59:38 2015 UTC,He was moving away from the defender...  Clearly not a foul.
OCLions,35cun7,j_andrew_h,11,Sat May 9 03:35:33 2015 UTC,That was the best draw I've watched since USA-England. Very proud of how Orlando kept their heads up and clawed their way back.  Also the officiating was beyond atrocious.

OCLions,35cun7,rynbelz,11,Sat May 9 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"I do not know what was up with Okugo tonight he had an awful game. Gave up the ball for the first goal, looked shaky all first half. His passing was poor and his first touch was really letting him down. All credit goes to Heath for recognizing that and subbing him off and bringing on Higuita who really changed our midfield dynamic. We will continue to gel and hopefully we get rid of these first half nerves we seem to have. Cut out those errors that lead to their goals and I fully believe that game would have ended as a 2-0 victory instead of a 2-2 draw.  edit: Btw I thought Boden was rock solid at LB and my boy COLLIN has seriously not put in a foot wrong this season after that first red card against NYCFC."
OCLions,35cun7,j_andrew_h,6,Sat May 9 02:16:41 2015 UTC,I think Okugo is suspended for the next game due to yellow cards accumulated.  So we'll see the 2nd half duo of Ceren &  Higuita again in DC...  I thought they looked great.
OCLions,35cun7,spikebaylor,5,Sat May 9 03:38:45 2015 UTC,He was one game away for good behavior too... havent seen a replay but what a bogus yellow too.

OCLions,35cun7,j_andrew_h,2,Sat May 9 04:38:53 2015 UTC,I would say really good for a Friday. I know a lot of people who couldn't make the game because of the timing and distance (if I'm trekking to Orlando I'm going to make a day out of it sort of deal).
OCLions,35cun7,spikebaylor,5,Sun May 10 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"Boden was my man of the match tonight,  he was solid on D and customer crosses are so sweet."
OCLions,35cun7,j_andrew_h,2,Sat May 9 03:40:49 2015 UTC,I think he had maybe one or two poor crosses but every other cross was on point.  Really great showing (not that we thought otherwise)
OCLions,35cun7,BrillWolf,6,Sat May 9 04:15:08 2015 UTC,"He had one right in front of us where under heavy preassure he bent it from nearly the end line in the (north west) corner and bent it back into the box.  Obviously it didn't convert; but not because the cross was lacking.  It was perfect because it bent far away enough from the keeper that he couldn't come out for it.    I sit practically inline with the endline so the bend was clearly visible to me from that vantage point.  I really like Boden starting with Shea as long as Boden doesn't get exposed as being a liability on Defense.  So far, so good; but it's early days for him in MLS."
OCLions,35cun7,catch_th3m_all,2,Sat May 9 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"Boden was great last night. I was pleasantly surprised with out second half, usually I've noticed we've petered out.  What the hell is with Ramos? He played like crap."
OCLions,35cun7,BrillWolf,6,Sat May 9 13:21:01 2015 UTC,He had that fantastic assist.
OCLions,35cun7,j_andrew_h,8,Sat May 9 13:39:20 2015 UTC,... for New England.
OCLions,35cun7,BrillWolf,7,Sat May 9 13:42:22 2015 UTC,Ramos made the 1 horrible mistake; but I was pleased with his effort and keeping it cool after that.  He had some strong moments in the 2nd half including the asssist on Larin's goal.  Not his best night all around even outside of the error leading to the goal; but I thought he pulled it together well.
OCLions,35cun7,spikebaylor,2,Sat May 9 13:43:40 2015 UTC,"From my seat, it looked like he got the ball, and just kicked it back. Not much pushing or putting pressure on NE.  Granted the guy he was guarding was twice his height."
OCLions,35cun7,zrowny,2,Sat May 9 13:47:28 2015 UTC,to be fair he had Avila in front of his most of the night O.o

OCLions,35cun7,zrowny,4,Sat May 9 04:38:28 2015 UTC,"Little smaller than previous matches (27k vs 30-31k), but it's definitely not dying out"
OCLions,35cun7,catch_th3m_all,7,Sat May 9 06:57:42 2015 UTC,"Weeknight games including Fridays tend to be lower in attendance for a lot of MLS teams.  Something about working and a game in the same day is tough for some people I guess.  I was pretty worried about 15 minutes before 8 as there were tons of empty seats; but it filled in nicely and we had a good crowd.    The ""Orlando"" - ""City"" chant gives me chills every time.

As for the linup, I hope Avila doesn't start at RM; if we are going to play the 4-2-3-1 then I'd like to see Rivas & Shea as the outside Midfielders.  If coach doesn't see Rivas in that role at this point then we might as well play the 4-3-3 with Ceren, Okugo & Higuita in the defensive midfield.  Avilia pretty much played as a DM even when he was at LM falling back in the attack in favor or letting Shea overlap.  Pairing up with Ramos, could be different of course but I just think if we are going with a more defensive choice; then we might as well own it and play the 3 defensive mids."

OCLions,358rfm,EntityDamage,2,Fri May 8 17:43:07 2015 UTC,The last departure from Church Street is 10:30 PM.  That would be cutting it very close to get back there if the potentially ends at 10:30 PM.  I agree that they should run it later on game nights like this.  The Magic have even later games at times without any potential for a homebound trip on SunRail.

Hopefully Larin could get on the end of a Boden cross and a tight midfield trio can help contain Nguyen/Agudelo"
OCLions,357b3a,logjam13,1 point,Thu May 7 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm completely wrong (I probably am) but I just don't see us creating too many chances with only 3 ""attacking"" players in the 4-3-3 and if our goal is to stop New England; again I'm not sure how well we can do that if they are free to keep coming at us.  We may be able to catch them on the counter with Shea's speed; but I don't see New England being too scared of this lineup when we are in possession unless Ceren & Higuita truly join the attack in the final 3rd or we get a header from Larin off a Boden cross."
OCLions,357b3a,logjam13,1 point,Thu May 7 19:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah the hope would be that Shea offers more in attack than anyone else and that he can boost the offense. It's basically the same attackers as a 4-2-3-1 with Avila but more in defense of the middle of the field. Force them wide and see if they can beat Collin, Hines, and co. in the air"
OCLions,357b3a,daguru9,1 point,Thu May 7 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"Good points on what it gives us defensively; and I agree if Avila is going to play in the 4-2-3-1; then you might was well just play the 4-3-3 because you still only have 3 players attacking really.  But as you said with the 4-3-3 at least the formation is based on only having 3 attackers rather than a formation where one is supposed to be attacking but is rather drifting back.    Completely unrelated to formation, I see a goal in this game for Ramos.  I don't know why; but it popped into my head this morning and I'm calling it."
OCLions,357b3a,catch_th3m_all,2,Thu May 7 23:48:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if it is not something similar to what they played last week, more of a 4-3-3.  And is sounds like Avila is going to play on the right..."

Beckham has been getting jerked around for a while now and there hasn't seemed to be enough interest from fans (supporters?) to pressure Miami to get a deal done. It's great to hear Ft.

Or if you want to tailgate the parking will be around 20 bucks and you could join one of the supporter's tailgate, just be sure to bring beer, they have been very friendly to new OCSC fans.  Seats is all a matter of preference. I like to be sitting up close in the middle of the field (108 row B) and those types of seats are obviously a bit more money. Club seats are not worth it in my opinion unless you really want to see the back of the bench player's heads...

I tried finding some parking passes and couldnt seem to find any on ticketmaster or StubHub, but you should keep checking and im sure some will pop up. If i is about 25 bucks then it is a decent price, just be aware of the location to know they are in a OCSC LOT and not in a random place (There is a map of the lots online)  Edit: Yeah alcohol is def allowed.

I know he's a lefty as well; but think about guys like Messi & Robben who terrorize teams coming from the right and then cutting in to their stronger left foot.  If Rochez is finally ready to give some quality minutes  and Paterson is soon behind; we need to have Brek & Rivas on the pitch at the same time and without Molino playing them both up in attacking roles is necessary for now."
OCLions,34yoh3,daguru9,2,Tue May 5 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"The linked email chain explains some of this... Paterson and others have been ""released"" by Huddersfield, which means that they are FA at the end of their current contracts (Huddersfield will not resign them).  Paterson is still under contract until 6/30 and is still on loan with OCSC.  The loan agreement was through 6/30 with an option to buy... which now would be the only option since he will be a FA."
OCLions,34yoh3,j_andrew_h,4,Tue May 5 17:38:57 2015 UTC,Hope he gets on the field soon and uses this as motivation to play very well and land a contract.  We need it as much as he does.

OCLions,34udxd,daguru9,5,Mon May 4 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"While I'd love to see a ton of attacking; I think there is also a chance that we end up seeing a more defensive formation with the 4-3-2-1 lineup with 3 defensive Mids (Higuita, Ceren & Okugo) to help stop New England.  That would likely leave Brek back at LB and maybe Rivas and Kaka playing behind Larin up top.  My personal starting 11 for this game (given available players) is the 4-2-3-1 with: -------------- Ricketts -------------- -Ramos -- Hines -- Collin -- Boden- ---------- Okugo -- Ceren ---------- ------- Rivas -- Kaka -- Shea ------ ---------------- Larin ---------------    I doubt we'd see that lineup; but I'd love to see them try go all out on the offensive against the Revs with tons of speed and attacking players. With Shea and Rivas in the lineup in attacking positions; they will be pinned back pretty well (hopefully).  I know that Rivas is more of a left side player as well; but I think he an Shea can cross up a bit and both do damage and keep the pressure on New England rather than trying to play behind the ball and counter."
OCLions,34udxd,j_andrew_h,5,Mon May 4 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Rivas playing on the right might not be that bad either.  If he has the ball and cuts in to the center of the field.. he'll be on that strong left foot.  It could work out.  I would possibly worry about his ability to cross when the opportunity comes, but who knows.. they're professionals, they might not be AS good, but they should still be able to cross a ball on their weak foot.  The Sentinel had Ribeiro listed as a forward, but unless I am mistaken that wasn't his original role, he just fell into it.  He played well there paired beside Kaka in one game as well.  Not that he'll be ready for NER but soon it looks like.  Its a damn shame to lose Molino right now, but I think the team will survive ok.  As coach said, it's more of a loss for Kevin, especially with Gold Cup coming up."
OCLions,34udxd,spikebaylor,5,Mon May 4 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying...  Rivas on the right is better than Avila on the left (he's a righty I think).  Messi plays that cut to the center from the right all the time (but he's Messi, I know)...  I could see it working though.     I just think if we play defensive against New England they will rip us up...  But if we are making them chase Brek and Rivas all night,  that could pin them back."
OCLions,34udxd,j_andrew_h,5,Tue May 5 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"we do much better in general when we dominate the game... i think our defense has done well in general, but a lot of that has been because our midfield has kept the ball for 80% (factual numbers of course) of the game.  To me the best defense is an offense who doesn't give the ball up.  I'm definitely with you though.  I hate that our offense always seems to be lacking something and yet we still play relatively conservative (a la, not putting in a purely offensive trio in the midfield behind our striker).    I'm also not a big fan of this Kaka out wide experiment.  We are sorely missing him in the middle to start the attack.  He has looked almost non-existent for most of these past two games."
OCLions,34udxd,spikebaylor,4,Tue May 5 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. It's not just an attractive style for the fans, it's how the team is wired...  Possession &  Attack and I hope we don't shy away now."

I know he's had call ups by the U20 team as well; but I doubt he'll get call up.  Turner is a maybe; but Donovan will be called for sure.    Cerén should be with the gold cup group, no the U20 World Cup... he's like 24 or 25 years old.    Ramos is going to hurt as will Rochez for depth; but hopefully Paterson will be fully fit and starting with Larin as the #1 backup for Forward.    If Turner is called up, we'll need either another RB or a RM and put Avila back at RB."
OCLions,34uvaq,j_andrew_h,2,Mon May 4 20:48:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I think Ramos will hurt the most but really Ramos and Turner might be worst case scenario. Everyone else is just depth but if both go we'd need Hines/St Ledger to play RB and our offense on that side would be pitiful...
OCLions,34uvaq,logjam13,1 point,Tue May 5 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"I think Hines or Avila could play Right Back if needed... but obviously neither are ideal.  We will need additions at almost every position Defender, Attacking Mid (have a few extra DMs) and probably a Forward as well."
OCLions,34uvaq,j_andrew_h,2,Tue May 5 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"The only issue is we've already got 30 players, so we'd need to move people on to clear cap/roster space before bringing anyone in. Josh Ford seems expendable but who else?"
OCLions,34uvaq,logjam13,1 point,Tue May 5 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Rivara will resume his loan as soon as he's healthy and of course Ford.  After that, I'm thinking maybe Redding, Estrela and even Heath once Ceren comes back.  Also, unless Cascio can get healthy and show something they may have to move on from him.  He's taking up a spot and hasn't played in MLS in quite a while.    I think there is room to be had if we find someone who can come in and play.  The thing that is killing us is that Rivas ended up as a DP.  I love that we have a young DP; but taking up two DP spots with 20 year old guys is very limiting at this point.  It may turn out great in the long run and I'm not against either Rivas or Rochez; just that both ended up taking up DP slots."
OCLions,34uvaq,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue May 5 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew if players on loan didn't count against the roster cap. I know Tenorio said players put on an injury list don't count towards the 28 roster spots - but they do count toward cap. If loan players are like injured guys that helps. But I don't know if we've got the cap space to bring in a high quality player to fit the roles we need.  But I did hear that Rivas' DP tag may be because of his transfer fee, so that may eventually go away.  I wish we had a system similar to European leagues where we're limited to x amount of first team players but U21 and homegrowns don't count toward that x. We've already got a similar system but with fewer ""on budget"" players and a limit to ""off budget"" players"
OCLions,34uvaq,logjam13,1 point,Tue May 5 17:30:55 2015 UTC,My hope is that Rivas's DP tag comes off next year if his salary is below the level and we'll be a year away from his transfer fee; but that's just my hope... I'm not sure it works like that.
OCLions,34uvaq,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue May 5 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"I thought the same about Ceren, but I saw him tagged by multiple sites.  Maybe they are allowed 2 or 3 older players per roster, I know some competitions and U leagues allow this..."
OCLions,34uvaq,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue May 5 11:53:01 2015 UTC,I think it's just a mixup between the Gold Cup and the U20 World Cup... the only thing that matters though is that he will almost certainly be leaving for some time this summer.
OCLions,34uvaq,logjam13,3,Tue May 5 15:54:36 2015 UTC,The bad news is this and the Gold Cup plus our current issues means the playoffs are a reach... The good news is we won't have to deal with these call-ups for 2 more years

OCLions,34uvaq,74656638,1 point,Tue May 5 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"That's only for keepers, and it looks like there may only be one guy in it now.  I'm wondering if they don't pick up a short-term loan guy by Wednesday like a Bryan Burke."
OCLions,34uvaq,74656638,1 point,Tue May 5 11:44:15 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking already... bring in Burke  The problem is roster limits, just because they are not available because of intl duty, they still count towards your roster.  In fact, as of right now, I believe we are one over the roster size limit, so if Tally and Paterson come back, someone will have to go (loan)...  This is going to make things very difficult and it is something we all knew was coming... Losing Molino and the other injuries make it hurt more."
OCLions,34uvaq,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue May 5 11:55:05 2015 UTC,"Can't you have some players on a reserve roster?  Also, I'd expect one of the backup keepers to be loaned or released when Hall is back 100%."
OCLions,34uvaq,MacAndSpam,2,Tue May 5 13:54:36 2015 UTC,It looks like Ford will be loaned or released once Hall is back.  The club has certainly shown more confidence in Edwards so far and he's looked pretty good.

OCLions,34rtub,whtge8,6,Mon May 4 01:18:40 2015 UTC,Perhaps. But I think it could be argued that players push themselves more in game situations. Thus making it more likely for injuries of this nature to occur. If this happens during a league game than at least it was while trying to gain something.
OCLions,34rtub,ImSteveDave,3,Mon May 4 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"I do agree it could happen anywhere, but playing on the awful turf at the Citrus Bowl just gives additional risk."

OCLions,34rtub,theFUNtes,7,Mon May 4 01:32:31 2015 UTC,Sounds like we need a right midfielder this summer...if only on loan. Avila is the only guy who can play there and holy hell is he pointless on offense
OCLions,34rtub,logjam13,6,Mon May 4 01:48:35 2015 UTC,Hope they move Brek up there and start Luke
OCLions,34rtub,niNroM,3,Mon May 4 02:16:09 2015 UTC,Could see ribeiro there.  Sounded like he'll be nearly 100% within the month.
OCLions,34rtub,spikebaylor,2,Mon May 4 03:43:07 2015 UTC,I think we're really missing his effort. Maybe we can switch back to the 4-3-2-1 with he and Kaka behind the striker
OCLions,34rtub,logjam13,5,Mon May 4 04:23:15 2015 UTC,Well piss. That sucks. Hope he rehabs well.
OCLions,34rtub,misanthropicbuddha,4,Mon May 4 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"Well, this is very unfortunate.  Hopefully, his recover goes well, and now I hope the club can find a decent replacement."
OCLions,34rtub,trumpetblast,3,Mon May 4 01:51:15 2015 UTC,ACL's are the worst. Hope he gets back to feeling himself quickly!
OCLions,34rtub,trumpetblast,5,Mon May 4 00:47:41 2015 UTC,"Also, who would play there? Do we move Avila over, Brek up, and play Boden at LB? I really wanted to see some more of the Boden-Shea combo on the left, but not at all for this reason."
OCLions,34rtub,spikebaylor,4,Mon May 4 00:52:33 2015 UTC,Hopin Cascio is at a point where he can come in.. Avila is such a drain on our offense.  Not terrible to have if we're playing for a draw and need a defensive presence but if we're going to play at 100% he should not be on the field.  A shame we wont get to see rivas/kaka/molino with pato up front this year.
OCLions,34rtub,pvdfan,2,Mon May 4 01:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Shea up, but he needs games at LB to stay on the national team radar."
OCLions,34rtub,trumpetblast,3,Mon May 4 02:35:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of him back there and I hope he can stay, but with Molino out I think that pushing him up and inserting Boden gets the best combination of talent on the field. I don't envy Heath."
OCLions,34rtub,daguru9,2,Mon May 4 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, but at some point Club has to be trump Country...  if it is the best solution for the club, then you have to do it."
OCLions,34rtub,j_andrew_h,2,Mon May 4 12:36:59 2015 UTC,"Unless they come up with another idea to create an attack on the Right, then it looks like now is that time time.  We will have no offense at all if guys like Avila and Neal are our starting RM & LM. They are solid players sure, but not attacking minded enough to start in this league at those roles.   Honest question, besides crosses; what are the downsides (if any) of playing a left footed player at RM? For example Messi plays as a RF a lot and often uses the cutback to his left to create shots (obviously he's pretty great with his right too).    I'm just thinking of the extreme offensive solution to move Rivas over to the RM and Shea up to LM with Boden behind him of course.  This could give us tons of speed and attacking minded players that will certainly not shy away from the box or letting shots fly."
OCLions,34rtub,burajin,3,Mon May 4 13:18:35 2015 UTC,"Gutted. We do everything right going into our inaugural season until we end up with midfield problems and now this. Hope he recovers quickly.   Sucks for Trinidad as well, with the Gold Cup and all."

OCLions,34rtub,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon May 4 12:42:41 2015 UTC,"I have what many might think is a radical solution:  1) Move Shea to LM and Boden in at LB (that's not the radical solution) 2) Move Ramos up to RM 3) Sign Bryan Burke at RB  Bryan is someone who knows the team and system, could be bought or loaned very quickly, and is a really good RB.  I am in the camp that thinks had he not broken his leg a few years ago, he would be on this roster now anyways.  The broken leg basically killed two years of his development.  And he is still in the family (with Louisville City).  This would allow Ramos to be a more attacking threat, who knows, he may excel at RM more than RB..."
OCLions,34rtub,logjam13,1 point,Mon May 4 12:42:15 2015 UTC,It could work with Ramos at RM.  It just depends on the timetable for players like Cascio coming back from injury and what coach thinks of them.
OCLions,34rtub,niNroM,1 point,Mon May 4 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"Not Sure LCFC would appreciate us signing their starting RB without a transfer fee... But we could put Avila at RB, where he played for Chivas"

OCLions,34oi9j,jmoney0999,5,Sun May 3 02:04:55 2015 UTC,Anywhere downtown would be good.  I typically park under I4.  $10 usually and a decent amount of spaces left most days.. i get there about 2-3hours early most games.  Party downtown on church street and take a bus to the stadium.  They have been on point with the busses usually never having to wait more than a couple minutes.  We normally walk back after the game instead of waiting for busses.  There is typically a large crowd walking down after the game so you will be in good company and can feel safe walking at night.  Its also a much shorter walk than it looks.

OCLions,34fbx1,daguru9,5,Thu Apr 30 17:53:53 2015 UTC,Lets hope for crouch!
OCLions,34fbx1,tombombcrongadil,6,Thu Apr 30 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"Mark Hughes has recently commented about how vital Crouch is to his efforts at Stoke.  It's way more likely that they're after Jon Walters (who has the best stamina on the team and never quits) or maybe Peter Odemwingie.  Either of them would be really solid in MLS, especially Walters who is strong and can push defenders around.  The other interesting thing is that both of them can play up top or on the right, if Adrian wanted to shift Molino back center in some setup, which might be doable if Paterson gets going."
OCLions,34fbx1,74656638,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:53:25 2015 UTC,Interesting thoughts!
OCLions,34fbx1,j_andrew_h,1 point,Fri May 1 01:59:37 2015 UTC,"I think Odemwingie still has another year with us, he was very good last year then literally spent the whole season injured. Walters maybe, but I don't think he's the type of person to go to America to ply his trade if i'm honest. Maybe someone like Wilson Palacios may be heading closer to home."
OCLions,34fbx1,stratamartin,1 point,Fri May 1 09:30:40 2015 UTC,"Palacios is a good thought.  Hard to know what sort of impact he'd have in MLS given that he has barely played the last two seasons for Stoke.  He also got a red card in the World Cup.    That said, he does seem obvious since he'd almost certainly be a free transfer and bringing a Honduran player in to help Rochez would be positive.    I'd also assume that despite his lack of playing time that he'd be an upgrade on Ceren in the midfield, who has had some bad giveaways.    The other possibility would be Jamie Ness, who'd come cheaper than Palacios and also fits in the defensive midfield.  Or maybe Andy Wilkinson, who would provide the defensive flexibility they wanted with Heath Pearce.  Wilko can play RB, CB, or LB.  He's out of contract with Stoke, though I'd imagine he'd have interest from Championship sides."
OCLions,34fbx1,74656638,3,Fri May 1 12:14:48 2015 UTC,I would love to see crouch and his long gangly legs in OCSC purple !

OCLions,34fbx1,logjam13,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:17:33 2015 UTC,It should be 1. Unless they're counting Hines as international but I'd imagine that could be rectified quickly
OCLions,34ey3v,Rebzy,14,Thu Apr 30 16:14:56 2015 UTC,The way I see it in non-supporter sections is the following: Your default position is sitting. If something decent happens on the field (like a good tackle or cheeky pass) you applaud/cheer/whistle. If our side is in a potential goal scoring opportunity you can stand and brace yourself for that goal and obviously if we do score you should be standing and going mental.
OCLions,34ey3v,Thetruth1777,4,Thu Apr 30 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I love the supporters section and I've stood for 90 minutes them from time to time over the years and with the Bara Brava a couple times in DC before I moved here.  That being said, I take my 9 year old to games and bought our season tickets outside of the supporters section so that she could actually see the game as she's not tall enough to see over standing adults typically.  I would certainly never tell people not to stand when the moment pulls you out of your seat like a great chance or something and she understands that as well; but when one person decides to say up for extended periods of time their unknowingly taking the game away from others.    If you want to stand for 90 minutes, by all means please do so; but please do it in the ""standing"" section where it will be appreciated and celebrated."
OCLions,34ey3v,j_andrew_h,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:17:36 2015 UTC,How do OCSC games compare to the Barra Brava at DC. I loved going to RFK for those games in the middle of all that excitement. I haven't made one here in Orlando yet just curious how the atmosphere compares.
OCLions,34ey3v,FavresADouche,2,Thu Apr 30 20:29:47 2015 UTC,You seriously need to go to an OCSC game then. The energy and atmosphere are awesome.  Seriously go!
OCLions,34ey3v,j_andrew_h,3,Fri May 1 01:55:27 2015 UTC,I was sitting in one of the sections right above the supporter's section (vs DC United) and we only stood up to cheer whenever we were getting into the attacking third (and subsequently sitting down dissapointed). It looked that way in basically the rest of the stadium too. There was a guy sitting in the row in front of me that kept standing up to cheer (wayyyy too early) and he was definitely getting annoying
OCLions,34ey3v,zrowny,4,Thu Apr 30 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"I am of the opinion that everyone should be standing all game, but I completely understand that it isn't a widely shared view. Standing is basically the law in the supporters section, but it shouldn't be anywhere that has an assigned seat. I would say that you should follow the general consensus of your section- if most are standing then you should be too, if most are sitting it's probably a good idea for you to be seated as well. Everyone has the right to watch the game the way they want to, so no one should be forced to stand or sit, but those who tend to go against their section should probably consider moving to a different section the next time they buy tickets."
OCLions,34ey3v,taylor314gh,3,Thu Apr 30 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"Good point on the general consensus of your section, these are people who hopefully you will be sitting with for a longtime."
OCLions,34ey3v,OCSC407,3,Thu Apr 30 23:59:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, once we are in our own stadium you may be next to that person for decades"
OCLions,34ey3v,taylor314gh,1 point,Fri May 1 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"It's like being in church in my section.  Default sitting  Stand when we are attacking especially when is at far end of the field, corners, or when I'm yelling at the ref or an opposing player. I'm also vertically challenged.   If someone is standing in front of you the whole game I get it but who cares if someone cheers to early. They are just trying to enjoy the match like you and just excitable.   I think people need to use common sense and you can always ask someone politely to sit down. Everyone who sit around my seats are all great with only a few drunk asshats in the section."

If he actually has the frustration and passion that Heath says he is showing, then he should be ready to kill it on the pitch.  And I think he will have to do just that, to justify extending his loan or buying him out-right...  When you are able to score goals, especially multiple goals, in games, then defensive concerns are not as important.  Scoring early and multiple times can take an opponent out of the game, so your defense is not on constant pressure..."

Mind you, we were a grand total of 5 feet beyond the gate and not moving.  After that, the dumbass gathered a half a dozen other minimum wage security guards born before World War 2, they decided to let us pass ""just this once"" despite the fact a team employee was with us the entire time.

OCLions,346hr8,pvdfan,3,Tue Apr 28 18:43:41 2015 UTC,I can see them delaying the stadium at this point.  Since the club won't own the stadium anyway; I don't see them nearly doubling their investment in it (from $40M to $70M).

However, I would be curious to know what long-term means? I can see two schools of thought 1. We don't have our specific stadium which sucks, 2. We are currently at a stadium where we can draw more than the new stadium would hold. Translated to ticket sales. This is a weird situation. I wonder what impact a smaller/no frills stadium would consist of. My guess is someone is going to get some sunburn and possibly rained on without a cover."

OCLions,346pvz,misanthropicbuddha,5,Tue Apr 28 19:07:05 2015 UTC,I'm kind of surprised Brek got rated as MotM. He gave away the ball a few times (something with the turf causing people to slip easier?) and didn't really show any hustle at all with trying to get the ball on passes that weren't right too him. I guess it really just shows how bad everyone else was doing too...
OCLions,346pvz,zrowny,2,Tue Apr 28 21:59:08 2015 UTC,"I thought he was pretty good overall.  He seemed to be playing much further forward than normal, had a few really good crosses, and was the only one providing any sort of width offensively.  Me made one run in particular where he sprinted up the left side but for whatever reason, Kaka did not feed him.  I also thought he did a decent job with Altidore defensively.  He was certainly not the problem."
OCLions,345edd,daguru9,5,Tue Apr 28 13:08:49 2015 UTC,"From my personal ranking of these five, from likeliest to no way in the world:  Fabiano Crouch Lima Dwyer Ibrahimovic  I could see Fabiano coming, apparently his family is already telling everyone that he is and I think Crouch is an outside chance, but not sure he would really work well in our system.  His signing would require an International Slot, which could be available since I doubt the team is going to extend Paterson's loan.  Plus with his familiarity with Kaka (played together last year at Sao Paulo), this could be a good move... even at his age.  Do not know that much about Lima, but at $8 million, don't think the club is willing to spend THAT much for a basic unknown.    Zlatan, not even going to go near this one.... never gonna happen...  Of course, the fan in me would love to see Dwyer come to Orlando City, but you have to know that SKC will never let this happen.  First, he is their primary striker and I don't think OCSC has anything to offer SKC in comparison.  Second, they know how good he is with the OCSC system and some of the players (Molino)... no way SKC would give up a weapon like him, let alone to a club that could make him even better.  I think Dom would be the perfect fit for this team and style, just don't see SKC doing this..."
OCLions,345edd,Dance_Monkee_Dance,4,Tue Apr 28 13:16:29 2015 UTC,Considering our game plan has been to cross the ball in with the backs Shea and Ramos I think Crouch fits the best. He is a big guy who can head it well and will get a good quality shot off if need be. Probably not the fastest and quickest but he'd be deadly with a well placed cross.
OCLions,345edd,logjam13,3,Tue Apr 28 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"In the latest 2-0 loss against Toronto, Orlando City was lacking creativity in the final third, and seemed to be trying to take the ball up the flanks (especially in the 2nd half) instead of staying central and creating better opportunities through the run of play.   Toronto was packing 9 guys in the middle of the field and giving us the flanks; Heath even said we were forcing it middle too much. We missed Ramos a ton. But I digress.  Fabiano looks like the only reasonable acquisition on that list. We'd have to give up a ton for Dom, Benfica isn't letting Lima walk (and certainly not for Rivas in any capacity), Zlatan is a pipe dream, and Crouch would be fought try pry away from Stoke.  But we have an international spot open so hopefully we use it. Anyone who has a killer instinct"

OCLions,342qtf,fewyn,2,Mon Apr 27 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see any issues, I know one of the issues with the CSS is the other team links. Just need to figure out a good way to fix it."
OCLions,340qun,daguru9,9,Mon Apr 27 11:48:23 2015 UTC,I'm glad they laid it out. And it does seem a but ridiculous considering that money with be made back easily with the tax revenue the stadium will make. Adding that to how much money it will add to the local economy. Take away the match yesterday and do you think any of those restaurants/bars would have been packed ? Not a chance.
OCLions,340qun,jmoney0999,2,Mon Apr 27 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"Link to emails/proper channels to contact for this?  Even though I am not a season ticket holder, I am absolutely amazed by the loyalty of the fan base.  I would gladly send a letter.  OCSC has opened my eyes to an amazing ""new"" sport.    The situation seems so silly.  Sure there are better things to spend money on out there, but when sports radio is talking about how horrible the Orlando Magic are, how dismal the sports scene for Orlando is ATM, why would they not strike while the iron is hot.    Orlando city is drawing 30k fans, and they need to realize that sure it isn't August, with 95* and 100% humidity and Orlando is still 0 wins at home.  This club, this sport, this opportunity was brought on by nothing but hope, and that prevailed to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars pumped into Orlando.    This is not 95$(per person) Disney tickets.  This is $25 tickets to the Citrus Bowl to hear a fan base that was so amazingly loud last night, even when losing.  Soccer is growing in the USAOrlando at an a amazing rate.  Thank god something other than MLB or NBA.  Go Lions!"

OCLions,33z9zk,coachhawley,15,Mon Apr 27 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"We have made more mistakes these past two games than the whole season. We have so much potential to be better than what we have been. My fear is that if we don't get a true finisher, our hope is diminished substantially."
OCLions,33z9zk,lapena88,10,Mon Apr 27 01:15:56 2015 UTC,"It looks like everyone is trying to prove themselves and force it. We need someone who can hold the ball up for a second, get their head up, and make a good decision. Right now we have no vision and no patience. Kaká can only dribble around so many people before he's got to pass the ball. Everyone just stands there and watches him dribble. There's no movement, no creativity, and no opportunity to even connect a couple passes toward goal.   Edit: Sorry for the rant. It's just that right now, it's hard to see any of our attacking players creating any kind of chance beyond getting a lucky bounce. Maddening!"
OCLions,33z9zk,messy_messiah,5,Mon Apr 27 01:20:25 2015 UTC,"You're completely justified. It's infuriating to watch the other players stand by as Kaká tries to create opportunities.  Riberio was doing really well in that department before he got injured. Adrian really needs to make sure he addresses our current situation because if they keep playing the way they are, we are going to have a long season ahead of us."
OCLions,33z9zk,lapena88,12,Mon Apr 27 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm frightened by the casual soccer fans seemingly ready to call it a season already. I'd rather these problems get exposed early.  I mean look at the goals we scored in the games we've tied/won. Lucky, all of them.  We knew we needed a striker.  Keep Calm and Wear Purple. A few weeks to go in the transfer window, so hopefully we sign a striker."
OCLions,33z9zk,spiegro,10,Mon Apr 27 01:51:49 2015 UTC,The only two goals that were not pure accidents were the two in Montreal.  No one is even getting the ball near the net let alone making goalies work.
OCLions,33z9zk,pvdfan,3,Mon Apr 27 02:42:56 2015 UTC,All the portland goals were earned.
OCLions,33z9zk,LAhammer,2,Mon Apr 27 20:41:42 2015 UTC,A very lucky chest bump and utter stupidty from Portland causing the retake.
OCLions,33z9zk,pvdfan,2,Mon Apr 27 21:19:34 2015 UTC,The chest bump was good finishing off of a good build-up. Penalty was a penalty; what happens afterwards - miss or make -  doesn't really contribute to the discussion of if it was earned or not.
OCLions,33z9zk,LAhammer,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:25:03 2015 UTC,"I really don't see any incoming transfers in the next window... unless they dump alot of guys, which I doubt will happen...  With USOC and various Int Tourneys coming up, they need as many bodies as they can get..."
OCLions,33z9zk,daguru9,11,Mon Apr 27 12:03:18 2015 UTC,"Turner isn't good enough yet. Every long ball he played was off target and he contributed nothing in attack. And playing Avila in an advanced role is like trying to wear a hat on your foot. Rivas tried to do too much when he was brought on but I was glad he was at least trying. Seemed like a lot of guys weren't moving off the ball, especially when it was with Kaka.  MLS deadline day is 12 May. We need a striker or Paterson needs to get healthy. Even then I don't know if he's our guy. Injuries have really hurt in midfield too. Ribeiro and Neal can't come back soon enough"
OCLions,33z9zk,logjam13,7,Mon Apr 27 01:25:27 2015 UTC,You got it. Turner killed so many offensive chances that Ramos would have kept alive. I agree on the movement. It seemed everyone was cemented to the pitch in the final third. Only movement was between the two passing it.   I believe Larin and some of the other guys will develop into nice talents but we need a true scorer. None of our shots were really threats and the ones that were on goal were easy saves. That needs to change.
OCLions,33z9zk,Multicolored_Pens,3,Mon Apr 27 01:37:21 2015 UTC,A lot of what we're seeing is growing pains. Young players in a new league in a new country. Two years from now? We'll be terrifying
OCLions,33z9zk,logjam13,2,Mon Apr 27 03:18:31 2015 UTC,That was untrue in the first 20 minutes of play. After that... Well I don't really know why they list their drive...
OCLions,33z9zk,all_ears_over_here,3,Mon Apr 27 05:38:51 2015 UTC,"I like Turner (Oviedo Lion) but he was horrible tonight. I'm sorry but Larin sucked tonight as well, especially when he missed the shot from inside the box and just stood there even though the ball was in play. He would have made a great field goal kicker though."
OCLions,33z9zk,OCSC407,5,Mon Apr 27 01:49:09 2015 UTC,Larin's got a lot of promise. He's got a high soccer IQ; he makes the right runs and knows where to be. But he can't create for himself and his finishing needs a lot of work. I'd like to see us being in a striker and loan him out until the first Open Cup fixture. He can't be asked to lead our line yet
OCLions,33z9zk,logjam13,2,Mon Apr 27 03:16:27 2015 UTC,I agree I was just commenting on his performance last night. He definitely has potential but just giving up while the ball is still in play is unacceptable.
OCLions,33z9zk,OCSC407,11,Mon Apr 27 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"The game went decently until we were caught repeatedly with our pants down.  Our strikers have yet to produce consistently, and we couldn't overcome them.  I hope we either sign or get someone to score consistently."
OCLions,33z9zk,beefat99,9,Mon Apr 27 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"We badly need someone to finish. We  hold the ball on the opponents end, then can't finish and it leaves us open for counter attacks. Frustrating to watch."
OCLions,33z9zk,ajoker40,6,Mon Apr 27 01:19:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair we don't have a seasoned striker. I was hoping for Kenny Cooper but that was nixed. Rochez and Larin may be good but not for a while.   Our movement suuuuuuucked. It reminded me of my playing against elite on FIFA. Dribble, dribble, dribble, give up the ball."
OCLions,33z9zk,catch_th3m_all,4,Mon Apr 27 02:03:34 2015 UTC,"I don't understand not going after Cooper. I love to watch that guy play, and he's exactly what we need. Great hold up play and a big body to fight in the air for all the unanswered service that flies through the box. He's proven he can score in the MLS, where none of our attacking options, bar none, have scoring credentials in the rough and tumble MLS."
OCLions,33z9zk,spiegro,7,Mon Apr 27 09:37:26 2015 UTC,"Well that was a pile of suck.  Turner was over his head, Larin was a statue that refused to move, the team has Hertzog syndrome again, stupid (and deserved) yellows, and ""shots"" that were closer to field goals than anything.  I'm not letting Heath off the hook either as this is his team and he seems to no control at all. He has complained multiple times about everyone just trying to make every ball go to Kaka even when he is covered by 4 guys, yet nothing changes.  Oh, and the field is garbage as well."
OCLions,33z9zk,pvdfan,5,Mon Apr 27 02:41:31 2015 UTC,Ugh. Just ugh. Expansion seasons are rough friends. We will prevail though.
OCLions,33z9zk,Generalparks,4,Mon Apr 27 01:25:23 2015 UTC,"We played sloppy, there's no way around it. To many moments where we gave Toronto the ball. To many moments where we were just shooting at the goal to shoot, without even trying to aim.  Here's the problem. Orlando City got hyped super hard before the season even began. Because of that people had insane expectations that just weren't going to get met easily. However, just because their wants odds are weren't going to be fulfilled doesn't excuse our performance.   The last 10 or so minutes of the game a good quarter of the section I was sitting in had just up and left. How much longer are people going to keep coming if we keep acting this way at home? Sure, the hardcore guys will still come, but casual fans are the ones that tend to fill seats. I get that people keep saying that expansion teams do rough their first year, but Orlando is an overly fickle city, and in turn we need to step our game up."
OCLions,33z9zk,Owtlaw1,3,Mon Apr 27 03:57:09 2015 UTC,"Same where I was with people bolting after the second goal.  What is truly worrying is the new season ticket holders are already getting fed up with the play.  Add to that, none of them (myself included) have any interest in the joke of a friendly next week that we had forced on us with little notice.  The team and front office need to get their shit together if they want anything near 14,000 season ticket holders with the possibility of season two at the Citrus Bowl."
OCLions,33z9zk,pvdfan,2,Mon Apr 27 07:34:06 2015 UTC,"I was sitting in P11 and there were a lot of ""Fair Weather"" chants as people left early. That was disheartening in its own way."
OCLions,33z9zk,Disorted,3,Mon Apr 27 23:28:06 2015 UTC,Shoot the ball on frame.   Doesn't need to be a golazo... just needs to be on frame.  On  frame.
OCLions,33z9zk,secretlyadog,2,Mon Apr 27 04:39:13 2015 UTC,"i kept yelling that at the screen as well.. it can't go in when its 5 miles over, but even if you shoot it at the goalie... he could drop it, get a poor touch, miscommunication, visibility issues, random shit can go in your favor.  None of that can happen when its in the stands."
OCLions,33z9zk,spikebaylor,2,Mon Apr 27 12:13:37 2015 UTC,With that many bodies in front of goal god only knows what might happen with a shot on frame.  It might even go in.

OCLions,33z9zk,supbruhbruhLOL,2,Mon Apr 27 01:56:10 2015 UTC,"uh oh, we're gunna get relegated! :-p all joking aside, that was a miserable performance from our lads tonight. Our players looked lackadaisical and gave up possession unnecessarily with bad passes. The midfield looked like we had Pulis in, no holding just uninspired disconnected long lobs. Shea not burning down the line to keep the ball in play was disappointing, hopefully the B team gets a good run against Ponta Preta next week and it gives the squad time to reflect at how shit they've been and figure out how to pull together. Faith in the Gaffer, Faith in the Lions."

OCLions,33zain,lapena88,3,Mon Apr 27 01:13:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like, more than a different striker up front, is just more movement off the ball in the attacking third. So many times we get it just outside the box and we have 3 guys standing 10-15 yards away from ball waiting on magics to happen. It's frustrating when the player that moves the most off the ball plays left back."
OCLions,33zain,roborooter0,2,Mon Apr 27 01:51:18 2015 UTC,This is so true. Our Left back is more involved in attacking plays than most of our midfielders.
OCLions,33zain,all_ears_over_here,2,Mon Apr 27 01:57:54 2015 UTC,"In the first 10 minutes of play, Shea was coming inside and taking part in some beautiful chances. We need more of that!"
OCLions,33zain,secretlyadog,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:40:20 2015 UTC,I like it. It's good. It looks good. It ought to generate chances.   But...  It leaves us exposed at the back.  We have no one finishing those chances right now.
OCLions,33zain,MyOwnHurricane,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that is completely intentional and expected of both our RD and LD who are wingbacks, their job description is to overlap with the DMs so they can take the ball out to the wing for crosses (which is why we are playing a 4-2-3-1 most games).  If they can't find room on the wings, they distribute through the mid to Kaka, Rivas, Molino et al."
OCLions,33zain,spiegro,4,Tue Apr 28 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I actually think these losses exposes our unusually young crop of forwards for what they are, and I hope that shows ownership that they need to land a pacey striker in the transfer window for the young lads to hide behind.  And I'm ready for Tally Hall now. Rickettes could have done better on both of those goals. Totally not his fault, but really should have done a bit better."
OCLions,33zain,logjam13,2,Mon Apr 27 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think we need more than just one striker.  Here's a breakdown of the finishing stats across the board for players with at least 10 shots (stats from the league):    Player Shots On Goal SoG%    Kaka 19 7 37%   Molino 12 4 33%   Rivas 14 4 29%   Larin 11 3 27%    Rivas has just as many shots on target as Molino playing almost 50 fewer minutes/match.  So is it a lack of shooting or a lack of chances? Well here are the total numbers for chances created this season:    Player Chances    Kaka 35   Rivas 4   Ramos 2   Avila 1   Molino 1   Shea 1    A lot of that, I think, has to do with how we're playing around Kaka.  Molino needs to play like he did last season when he had 9 assists.  We need Rivas in on the left because he's been one of our more productive players and he's only averaging a half hour ever week.  Yes, it will affect our defense on the left but playing an offensive dead end in front of Shea hasn't worked."
OCLions,33zain,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Apr 27 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"If Larin, Rochez and (hopefully Paterson) can play up top; then Rivas can move over to the Left."
OCLions,33ytn3,coachhawley,9,Sun Apr 26 22:46:17 2015 UTC,Watching the game is so frustrating. We dominate possession but we make careless mistakes and our chances on goal doesn't  match our possession percentage.
OCLions,33ytn3,lapena88,5,Mon Apr 27 00:16:53 2015 UTC,What's making it worse for me was reading about how shit Toronto's defense was. I hope they are having a really good game because if they aren't...
OCLions,33ytn3,rqsmuckles,2,Mon Apr 27 00:32:25 2015 UTC,"F... possession . We do nothing with it and there is no movement. To make it worse, we played a 4-2-3-1 with a forward who isn't experienced enough to be the lone striker . I have said over and over , I hate the Shea expirement ."
OCLions,33ytn3,Zro21,2,Mon Apr 27 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"I think Brek would be fine where he is at, but only if we had someone who is more of a threat up front. I agree though that as of now we can dominate possession all game but it doesn't mean a thing if we can't punish teams for allowing us to have the ball so often."
OCLions,33ytn3,lapena88,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:22:25 2015 UTC,Pretty much Toronto changed their tactics on defense completely and started playing further back and much tighter against Orlando because of previous games and in hindsight gave up their usual possession style game they have been playing.
OCLions,33ytn3,Swervitu,8,Thu Apr 30 05:43:41 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but our strikers are really bad. Rivas had a great shot at goal and he hits it 40+ over the goal.
OCLions,33ytn3,HalaUnited,2,Mon Apr 27 00:59:01 2015 UTC,i thought Rivas was a midfielder
OCLions,33ytn3,beefat99,2,Mon Apr 27 01:00:07 2015 UTC,He is for the most part. But everybody is playing striker right now because we're pushed up so far. Bottom line is we don't have anybody who can put the ball in the back of the bet consistently.
OCLions,33ytn3,HalaUnited,3,Mon Apr 27 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Its like when we hit the final 1/4 of the field, it just all goes to shit. So few chances and we ruin each one in spectacular fashion."
OCLions,33ytn3,rqsmuckles,2,Mon Apr 27 01:06:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, we spend most of the game in the attacking 1/2 but can't get anything done in the final 1/4. Our ball control is below average and we don't ever hardly look threatening on set pieces. We haven't got many well struck balls on goal either."
OCLions,33ytn3,HalaUnited,0,Mon Apr 27 01:13:52 2015 UTC,I honestly trust Larin and Kaka the most.
OCLions,33ytn3,beefat99,9,Mon Apr 27 01:03:43 2015 UTC,"DAT OC CHANT AT '74...seriously Tallahassee, put in the fucking money.  This is a GREAT thing."

OCLions,33ytn3,rqsmuckles,5,Mon Apr 27 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"It really is sad though.  I mean I have watched every OCSC game this season on TV.  Never have I heard such crowd support.  As I write this....Cerin cant fucking aim, but ANYWAY...  They play much better on the road.  Dammit.  Disappointed, but don't worry, tomorrows Sports Radio will be all about how the Magic suck dick, and how disappointing/sad this OC loss was."
OCLions,33ytn3,5heepdawg,6,Mon Apr 27 01:02:30 2015 UTC,Look at the seats.  There are emptying quickly.  Wish Orlando still had the same desire as game one.  I know we are losing but come on...
OCLions,33ytn3,5heepdawg,0,Mon Apr 27 01:04:31 2015 UTC,At the end of the game? People were leaving because we were clearly going to lose and getting out of the parking takes quite some time if you leave all at once.

OCLions,33tw5r,Bwignite24,2,Sat Apr 25 23:00:59 2015 UTC,Correct. I think we will be ok tonight for the most part. It will be interesting when we get into the summer for real how these games will get affected by our afternoon thunderstorms. I also think the heat will be a huge advantage for us. It's tough for a Vancouver team to come down here and play in a 100 degree weather with 80% humidity. I'm glad we are training outside and getting used to it.
OCLions,33tw5r,Bwignite24,2,Sun Apr 26 12:29:13 2015 UTC,"There are no games in the afternoon. All games after the LA Galaxy game next month will be during 7 pm or after. By that time, the sun will be close to the horizon, allowing the temperature to be in the mid 80's not in 100's (we never had 100 degree weather for quite some time) and all the aftenoon thunderstorms should be ending. It should be no different than last season."
OCLions,33pafq,daguru9,3,Fri Apr 24 11:53:00 2015 UTC,He played pretty well in his first start. That being said he was also protected more since we were playing a back 3 but I still think he will do well. Looking forward to him playing on Sunday !
OCLions,33pafq,jmoney0999,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:28:35 2015 UTC,Question will be who gets the start: Turner or St. Ledger...
OCLions,33pafq,jmoney0999,2,Fri Apr 24 15:11:28 2015 UTC,Saying move Hines to rb ?
OCLions,33pafq,j_andrew_h,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:46:44 2015 UTC,I know that Hines has played RB previously in his career so I think if St. Ledger came on for Ramos; then Hines would likely be the RB.  Gives us a solid defender; but not nearly as much moving forward up the field as Turner would.
OCLions,33pafq,j_andrew_h,2,Fri Apr 24 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"Correct... sorry for not being more specific.    Yeah, if you slide Hines over and inserted St. Ledger, it would be a more defensive formation and probably very little attacking or forward play.  I would prefer Turner, since he plays a similar moving forward style that Ramos plays.  And it would keep Hines and Collin together, side by side...  would hate to break up that pairing, especially since TFC's attack is probably going to come more centrally..."
OCLions,33pafq,jmoney0999,2,Fri Apr 24 16:24:30 2015 UTC,I agree on all counts.
OCLions,33pafq,j_andrew_h,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:07:37 2015 UTC,Yea agreed. Hines is a really good cover guy but not a whole lot going forward. Too reserved at rb for our style of play I think. I would much rather turner start to get some experience.
OCLions,33nt08,TrevenxD,3,Fri Apr 24 01:05:39 2015 UTC,This was sent in an email to get supporters to help get the funding passed. It includes who to contact and what to say.
OCLions,33nt08,pvdfan,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:27:01 2015 UTC,It's clear there is no phase 1 or phase 2 at this point.  This also explains why the land is still not cleared for a stadium that is set to open in a year or less.  A true mess all around.
OCLions,33nt08,daguru9,2,Fri Apr 24 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure you could call it a mess... I think Mayor Dyer is spinning the situation to benefit giving the $30 million, which is contrary to everything the club and he has said from the beginning.  It is also dragging along because of the legislature, they have pushed it back time and again.  I agree that this is probably why they have not started vertical construction, but I think it is related more to the govt delays."

OCLions,33l2iq,macaco_gordinho,2,Thu Apr 23 11:52:35 2015 UTC,So this 30 million is coming from the state?
OCLions,33l2iq,2ndgoround,5,Thu Apr 23 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, part of a fund that the state sets aside for this purpose, to provide to state major league sports.  Different teams can submit requests for access to these funds.  Last year the MLS approved to be added to the list of ""Major League Sports"" that can apply for funds.  There is now a movement within the State Legislature I guess to change the law, allowing these funds to be used for other purposes (healthcare, public safety, education, etc...).  What needs to be decided is whether the funds can be used for something else and who's requests are approved.  The $30 million would be need to go ahead and include the Phase 2 portion of the stadium build (couple thousand more seating, more roofing, luxury boxes, more bells and whistles, etc...).    Vertical construction has been put on hold, until after a decision on the $30 million is made (vote could be as early as this week according to Phil Rawlins this morning).  Phil Rawlins also said on the radio this morning that these his not a grant or ""gift"" and that the funds would have to be repaid back to the state... more like a loan than anything else.  He did not give any specifics like interest or time frame, so not sure about that part.  Either way, looks like the team with start the first handful of games in the Citrus Bowl and open the new stadium during the season."
OCLions,33l2iq,daguru9,3,Thu Apr 23 14:29:20 2015 UTC,I think the part about this being something that the club pays back is important for the public to understand.  They aren't looking for handouts; but they are looking for some investment from the state that other sports franchises have had in the past.
OCLions,33l2iq,j_andrew_h,3,Thu Apr 23 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"I would agree, but there are still large numbers of people and news organizations that do not fully grasp the existing $85 million from the county and city.  You can keep saying things over and over, but in the long wrong may not make a big difference with the public...."

OCLions,33ixeq,macaco_gordinho,6,Wed Apr 22 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"From the various interviews and articles this morning, vertical construction was/is supposed to start next month.  However, sounds like the team is holding until they find out whether they can get the $35 million from the state.  If they can get the $35 million, they can build Phase 2 from the start and not wait.  If they can't get the funds from the state, they still have the $85 million needed for Phase 1.  The state legislature still has a few weeks before they have to decide.  So the team is probably holding off until then, so they know which Phase they can start building.  The big question is whether it will be ready for the start of the season.  The club still says ""beginning of the season"", but Paul Tenorio said this morning don't be surprised if the first month or so of games are in the Citrus Bowl or on the road.  That the stadium could open AFTER the start of the season.    Only time will tell..."

I pulled a Dax Mccarty NYRB Kit card that is one of only 15 like it (Thinking a RBs fan might want that)."
OCLions,33dyts,WhiteWilliamHaynes,3,Wed Apr 22 14:50:48 2015 UTC,There is no greater rush in the hobby than opening that first box.  I still remember buying my first box of 1988 Topps baseball at Big Lots for $5 on vacation in 1991.  One pack is fun but the joy of seeing a giant pile of stars is another.  Over 25 years of collecting baseball cards that way (along with my hobby budgets and how fast prices plummet on 99% of cards) lead me to just buying singles of the teams I collect.  I shutter to think how much the first signed Kaka card in an Orlando City kit will be.
OCLions,33cnlu,manelandjeff,2,Tue Apr 21 13:22:03 2015 UTC,The article listed GK Mason Stajduhar as being from Orlando City. I'm assuming he's one of our academy players.
OCLions,33cnlu,logjam13,2,Tue Apr 21 13:22:36 2015 UTC,Yup. He's only a junior in HS but I think he could be one of our next homegrown players
OCLions,33cnlu,Generalparks,2,Tue Apr 21 14:20:55 2015 UTC,Nice to see him still in the youth national team picture.  Also good to see the academy producing top caliber players as well.  Off topic but this is why I'd eventually like to see us bring in a USL 2 team in Orlando so these younger guys can still get minutes and train with the first team.
OCLions,33cnlu,spikebaylor,2,Tue Apr 21 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"Im sure its a few years down the road but i could see them bringing the usl team back to orlando.  All the luck to Louisville but as big as this team is poised to be, and as well established as our academy is.. it doesnt make any sense to outsource our reserve team.  For now i get that they need to concentrate on the main team and get everything up and running.. stadium built, etc... but eventually it needs to happen."
OCLions,33cnlu,Generalparks,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:29:27 2015 UTC,Yeah for the first few years I get wanting to only focus on the MLS team and the stadium situation but after it a while it just makes so much more sense to have our own USL team and have everything running together.

OCLions,3390js,daguru9,8,Mon Apr 20 16:43:03 2015 UTC,Just be level headed. The initial goal was an error but it is not the end of the world. The red card following made the game even more of a challenge. When Colombus comes to play OC here it will definitely be a different story.
OCLions,3390js,macaco_gordinho,3,Mon Apr 20 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"Off-topic question from a Canadian fan: How's Larin been doing? I was hoping he'd have been more productive than 1 goal in five games, but I don't know what his play has looked like"
OCLions,3390js,KSenCSmith,6,Mon Apr 20 17:38:00 2015 UTC,He's looked raw but the potential is there.  Due to injuries and other things he was probably forced into a starting role quicker than originally planned for.  Once he settles in and gets a little more polished he should be great.
OCLions,3390js,Generalparks,5,Mon Apr 20 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say most of us are pleased with him so far.  To be fair he's only started two games (the last two) and this most recent game he was subbed off because the Ramos red card forced us to add an additional defender.  Also to be fair, the plan for Orlando City was to have Martin Paterson to start while our young strikers including Larin to come along slowly; but Paterson has been hurt and hasn't played yet forcing Kyle onto the pitch probably before we wanted to.  To his credit Larin has responded well and shown to have the touch and strength to hold the ball up and his goal against Portland was a quick thinking striker's goal.  Not pretty; but got the ball in the net which is all that matters.  Some of his shots have seemed a bit rushed; but it's very early for him so I'm optimistic that he'll continue to mature in the box and play well.  There is a lot to be excited about in this kid; hopefully for our Club & your country, he continues to progress as he is currently."
OCLions,3390js,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Apr 20 17:53:52 2015 UTC,Larin has kicked ass thus far. I just wish we didn't have to sub him out Saturday to make up for Ramos's hot-headedness.
OCLions,339jzm,daguru9,3,Mon Apr 20 19:01:56 2015 UTC,Didnt really expect it to be televised.. though i hope they find a way to stream it.  Going to miss this game along with the Toronto game so i can hang (aka work) in sunny El Paso.
OCLions,339jzm,spikebaylor,2,Mon Apr 20 19:16:08 2015 UTC,Nothing like not airing a game anywhere to force people to see it live.
OCLions,3369tz,Nickp1991,3,Sun Apr 19 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"There has been a lot of talk and expressions of support from supporters and local fans... nothing from the team itself, but fans have expressed to Rawlins that we would love for this to happen.  I think it is something that could happen, especially with some of the great girls youth support to act as a feeder, along with the UCF women's team, but I doubt you would see anything for the next few years.    The organization needs to focus on getting the MLS team solidified, along with the new stadium and infrastructure, before adding another big team to the mix... But I could see something in the next 4-5 years..."
OCLions,3369tz,daguru9,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"If we've learned anything from the past few weeks, it's that the potential for enormous support is there.  Take out the opener, and we're averaging over 30,000 per game. We'll see how things go looking forward, but right now it's looking like a lot of fans are gonna be left out when we move into the smaller stadium.  This is definitely a possibility worth serious exploration."

OCLions,3369tz,Triig,2,Mon Apr 20 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"Correct, but OCSC sold the rights to the LCFC group, while maintaining minor ownership.  However, they could sell that portion and buy new rights and start an OCSC II here locally...  IMHO that won't happen.... but to each their own... :)"
OCLions,3369tz,daguru9,3,Mon Apr 20 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think it will eventually. Louisville are doing really well and they might not use anyone we loan down. A 2s team would allow our draft picks/academy prospects to train with the 1st team and solid playing time, which has been the biggest conundrum so far. I'd hate to see our best academy prospects go elsewhere for regular playing time at the USL level"

He said that the league got lucky with Houston falling into their laps, but they are focusing on making every team as popular as Portland. I know there's been a lot of rumors bout Salt Lake and Indy so maybe they're going in a different direction or more likely he was just giving me the normal media run around. Either way I hope that we can get a team, perhaps a lioness in the crest."
OCLions,3369tz,MrBilld0zer,2,Mon Apr 20 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"Or name the team the Orlando Pride, and have Three Lionesses on the Crest, as a nod to the old OCSC crest."

OCLions,335kua,ShaunCST,5,Sun Apr 19 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people - myself included - are overreacting to the formation. Heath picked the 4-3-3 for Portland based on tactics but it made sense to use it in Columbus. It's a more defensive formation on the road against a team with a potent offense. But, more importantly, all of those players were in form.  Who would we have dropped for Ceren or Higuita? Rivas in theory but he's not in form. It would be a risk to change the game plan to a more attacking style and drop a player playing well for one who's had 90 minutes once in 4 months for us.  We've used the 4-2-3-1 in 4/7 matches. I'm glad we have other formations we can utilize for different circumstances. The 5-4-1 and 4-3-3 have both gotten us good results"
OCLions,335kua,logjam13,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:52:51 2015 UTC,I can respect that. But I wouldn't say higuita was in form either. Especially when he is playing higher up the field than he should be. And not playing kaka centrally will never make sense to me
OCLions,335kua,Ronaldmethot,2,Mon Apr 20 01:46:06 2015 UTC,"I guess it's really more of Higuita was playing well enough, maybe not in form.  I'd say both he and Ceren are playing where they would be normally in the 4-3-3 though, they've both been the more forward of the midfield two when paired with Amobi.  I'd like to see the 4-2-3-1 with Rivas-Kaka-Molino against Toronto anyway though"
OCLions,335kua,logjam13,2,Mon Apr 20 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"Teams have learned that if they shadow Kaka and try to get the ball off of him as soon as he receives it that they can neutralize him to some degree.  The only ways to get Kaka open again are: a) move him back into the middle (4-2-3-1) b) the other attacking players need to punish the defense for focusing so much on Kaka.  It's on Molino, Larin and hopefully Rivas finally in position at LM to make the defense pay.  Once they do that, then they will have to play us straight up which again just opens thing up for Kaka to create."

OCLions,332s4i,spikebaylor,5,Sun Apr 19 01:28:55 2015 UTC,So its a high price to gamble whether or not you can watch...sweet.
OCLions,332s4i,CubanCMcM,6,Sun Apr 19 02:25:55 2015 UTC,Not really a gamble. .. any game not on sunday or friday you'll be able to see on Live no issues.  Only the unimas game on fridays and fox/espn games on sunday are blacked out because they are nationally broadcasted.  Think of it this way... any game you can watch on sun sports you'd be able to see on mls live with no real fear of blackouts. (Technically i suppose if you live near another team with shitty tv deals and we play there you could be blacked out for that one game).  If you live in central florida and only watch orlando games theres no reason for mls live as you have access to My65 and Univision over the air for free to watch any match not on sunday.  If however you live somewhere else in florida then apparently sun sports is ok with preempting the game and mls live will never do that for the same games.  Also if like me you just enjoy watching soccer... MLS Live is amazing.  Soccer all day on saturday with no issues.  Like half an hour after non blacked out games they have condensed versions you can watch too... about 20 mins that shows all of the important stuff.  Awesome.  Blacked out games appear in full and condensed 48 hours after airing.

I don't have cable so Sundays really suck for me.  I just have Live and can watch Univision on fridays to catch most games.  I'll go up to a bar or something on Sundays.

OCLions,332s4i,itsKillSwitch,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:48:50 2015 UTC,I dont claim to know what sun sports was thinking but do we know they werent planning it? Didnt the baseball game just run long?  Im sure they would have shown it like normal if the baseball game ended when itwas supposed to.  Im not really trying to defend them.. as others have pointed out the game was on two cbannels so they could and probably should have shown the soccer game.  It sucks because ocsc has one of the better local tv deals of any of the teams.  On a local channel for orlando and on a statewide channel as well all while not having local blackout for Live.  I hope the FO does some bitching to sun sports for it.

OCLions,332of1,OCinNYC,3,Sun Apr 19 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"He has been my favorite player for some time as well, but I agree with you almost completely. He was clearly very amped up from the opening whistle and it got exacerbated when a few handballs/fouls didn't go his way. After the goal, the Columbus commentator couldn't have been more accurate when he described it as a toal meltdown. While the foul was not as bad as it looked initially, the intent was clear and it was a clear red card. I really hope he grows from this, and I think it won't hurt if we play Turner for a few games(and who knows, MLS might suspend Ramos for that long anyways) to both build Turner and teach Ramos a lesson. Unfortunate events and a really painful game to watch that we all waited all week for, but in the long term I think its a good learning point for the team. And would also like to point out, we started this match very flat and the up-and-down Columbus(to this point in the season anyways) came out strong and played hard, so I don't want to take away from them because they played good soccer."

OCLions,332of1,OCinNYC,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:59:40 2015 UTC,"Just the defenders? It doesn't need to be stated that Ramos had a horrific game, Hines didn't have the performance that he has been having all season but was definitely still pretty solid, and IMHO Colin had a tremendous game, with Brek being tremendous in the attack and I don't recall any major errors on defense but could be wrong about that. I think our biggest mistakes came from Higuita and Okugo, who made some very costly turnovers and poor clearances on the night(omitting Ramos b/c I think his performance is beyond debate tonight despite being my favorite player). I think the whole team looked flat tonight htough, but I really wouldn't put it all on our defense, I think our CB's specifically put in a good effort given the circumstances"

OCLions,3332p1,coachhawley,6,Sun Apr 19 01:29:54 2015 UTC,We're going to have a youth-induced loss or two this season. This one was ugly. Ramos may have started the downslide but Higuita kinda helped put the nail in the coffin.  We're about to find out how good Tyler Turner is. I doubt we move Hines over because it'll require a change in tactics again and I don't really care much for Avila. I wouldn't be surprised if Ramos' ban is extended and this is a tough run.  And we need to go back to the 4-2-3-1 that won us 5 trophies in 4 years. The 4-3-3 worked against Portland but it takes Kaka out of the center and we'll struggle to maintain possession against some teams. Toronto will be a tough game to bounce back in
OCLions,3332p1,logjam13,2,Sun Apr 19 04:18:49 2015 UTC,We were very lucky Turner has fallen off the U-20 National team and was even at this game.
OCLions,3332p1,pvdfan,4,Sun Apr 19 10:17:36 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with most of the guys here, poor performance from all to be honest. There's going to be a big chance come the transfer window, a few players will be offloaded by the looks of it. A lot of people here complaining about Avila and i'm 50/50, i think he's a better defender than he is a midfielder, but in saying that, i'd still pick Ramos/Turner over him lol. Just remember this is our first season in MLS. It's all a learning curve for most of these players, sometimes we forget that most of the guys haven't played in MLS before and are playing against really experienced players. Once the team finds its way we will be fine! Take away this performance, we've done really well in all the others."
OCLions,3332p1,itsKillSwitch,6,Sun Apr 19 09:59:57 2015 UTC,"(It was actually 3-0) :(  Beyond frustrating. Ramos really needs to work on his attitude. Last week, when a call didn't go his way against Portland, he spit on/at a cameraman. It was pretty clear on the ESPN broadcast, as the cameraman physically reacted like ""WTF are you doing"" after he got hit. I didn't think that much of it at the time, but after today it's clear he has a long way to go in terms of maturity. He can't throw the whole game away because something small didn't go his way. He desperately needs to learn from Kaka and his approach to the game.  Also fuck FOX Sports who made me watch a shitty stream of this shitty game."

OCLions,3332p1,benshovian,7,Sun Apr 19 01:41:09 2015 UTC,"Tough loss, taking a red card so early in the match away from home can be demoralizing for any team. Time to bounce back and get back in form."
OCLions,3332p1,burajin,3,Sun Apr 19 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"Well at least there was enough shit to cover up Turner's embarrassing ""throw in"""
OCLions,3332p1,pvdfan,6,Sun Apr 19 05:20:01 2015 UTC,"What a shit show.  Either Heath needs a new gameplan for attacking or needs to start benching people for this constant ""give the ball to Kaka no matter how many people are open"" bullshit.  Same goes for this cheeky building from the back crap when a clearance is needed.    As for the players, this team has way too many players with no emotional control.  Just constant bitching to the refs and then letting that effect the next two minutes of play.  Be a professional and gather yourself before running studs up out of anger.  Just an embarrassment all around."
OCLions,3332p1,mcn11,8,Sun Apr 19 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not so quick to shit on the team. Granted, they deserved it tonight. But this result was bound to happen eventually. We are a young and growing team. This is only our fifth game as a total starting lineup together.   That being said, we played awful. Ramos, who has played great thus far, simply acted out of control. He let his emotions get the better of him and he paid the price. Other than two or three bad plays on defense, we played decently. We got our chances. We just can't make these terrible plays in dangerous positions. We would've lost 1-0 absent terrible clearNces.   That being said, let's get 3 against Toronto next Sunday."
OCLions,3332p1,mcg1848,3,Sun Apr 19 01:54:19 2015 UTC,"To your point, I hope the team uses this as a learning experience.  I also have noticed a number of different players besides Ramos react although not quite melt down like last night.  Molino in particular to me seems to throw his hands up and bitch to officials after every time he goes down (pretty easily imo).  Collin as well.  I am right there with them most of the time - (the ref belongs on OBT am I right?)  I haven't really paid attention to how much other teams get in the refs face, but I would hope that part of OCSC's game does not get in the way of what otherwise is some very attractive brand of soccer.  The emotion is a double-edged sword, especially when dealing with such a young team.  As I think someone else said on here, we'll probably get burnt a time or two this season with stupid immature meltdowns.  I am just hoping the team (and Ramos in particular) takes whatever Kaka says to heart and does in fact learn from it like he said in his apology."
OCLions,3332p1,Generalparks,4,Sun Apr 19 14:46:43 2015 UTC,Lets just move on from this one. Rough from start to finish. Somebody please get in Ramos' face and tell him to not be such a hothead and lose his cool so quickly. Would've been nice to see us full strength against Columbus from start to finish. Credit to them though for making us pay.
OCLions,3332p1,spikebaylor,4,Sun Apr 19 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"So forgetting about the rest of the team sucking and wishing this game didnt happen... what in the world does heath see in Avila?  I will take almost anyone omln the team at half power over Avila at this point.    I really want to know whats up with Rochez, cuz we need rivas in mid.. even if as a sub in this 4-3-3... saving him as a sub for Larin is killing our midfield."

OCLions,32zyfb,logjam13,7,Sat Apr 18 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how I feel about the 4-3-3 this week.  It was the perfect way to combat Nagbe and the Timbers, but Kaka won't have the same acres of space in Columbus.  I think maybe switching back to the 4-2-3-1 with Okugo, Collin, and Hines to mark Higuain and Kamara and get Rivas and Shea attacking the left together"
OCLions,32zyfb,arleavit,6,Sat Apr 18 04:07:02 2015 UTC,"The best thing about the 4-3-3 tho was how it allowed Shea and Kaka to work together and Shea to get forward. Whatever Heath puts on the pitch though, should give us the best chance to win. All faith in the coach."
OCLions,32zyfb,spikebaylor,4,Sat Apr 18 12:36:39 2015 UTC,"I'm with /u/logjam in how I feel we should come out, but at the same time Heath has never seemed to agree with me on the lineup and puts out a different team that ends up playing very well, so who knows?  Just one day I'd really like to see a starting lineup of rivas, kaka, and molino in mid with whoever our striker of the day is up top.  I really think Rivas is going to be a very strong LM for us, he just hasn't really been given the opportunity.  He came in for a few mins against DC and despite missing shots, looked very dangerous.  I don't think lone forward is where he is going to excel."
OCLions,32zyfb,mcn11,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm not sure why he hasn't been in there. I'm hoping that when we get Patterson healthy we see Larin/Rochez subbing for Patterson as the starter. Then we can use Rivas on the left. I'm guessing that until we get two healthy and effective strikers, Heath wants the option of bringing in Rivas late."
OCLions,32zyfb,spikebaylor,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:54:39 2015 UTC,Im assuming that is the case as well.  I like the idea of having rivas as a super sub with his speed but if he is ineffective in the position is doesnt do us any good.. and denies us his abilities at LM.  Its been a while since he got much time up there so he might have gotten his timing down better.  The run last week that led to the PK was pretty good so we'll see.  Again i trust Heath to make intelligent decisions and he obviously gets to see the potential more readily tha we do.
OCLions,32zyfb,itsKillSwitch,5,Sat Apr 18 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"Decent team line-up. I like the fact we're not really going for a wide 4-3-3 and just crossing the ball in hoping for the best, i think the narrow formation suits us the most.   Score predictions? I'm going for another 2-0 victory to us with the goalscorers being Larin and Higuita."
OCLions,32zyfb,jmoney0999,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:17:29 2015 UTC,I think it would probably be best we play the 4-3-3 again. On the left we can take advantage of grana who is at best a decent defender. Much more attack minded. Honestly though I think shea should be rested. No need to burn him out when we have a more than capable backup.
OCLions,32zyfb,jmoney0999,2,Sat Apr 18 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"If we play Boden I'd like to see Rivas in front of him. That's the only reason I'd like to see a 4-2-3-1, to accommodate Rivas and Kaka. If Shea can go 4-3-3 would be just as effective"

OCLions,32lf9x,Generalparks,4,Tue Apr 14 19:19:49 2015 UTC,The club has said there would not be a 3rd kit in the first season which makes sense since the #1 reason for them in the first place is to stimulate additional jersey sales which certainly isn't an issue for Orlando City right now.

OCLions,32lf9x,SuperBOOTH,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:53:22 2015 UTC,I don't get why people fret over the sun in the summer if there isn't mid-day games. The DC game you mentioned is going to be at 7. The sun will be down near the horizon so it won't be too hot (about 80's) most of the first half as it will be in the shade and then night by second.

The first of which is to use Stadium Server, which hooks into the game while its running to add the stadium, and doesn't touch the original files.

OCLions,32h21j,daguru9,5,Mon Apr 13 19:10:53 2015 UTC,And I missed it some how... but Coach Heath as coach of the week!
OCLions,32h21j,logjam13,2,Mon Apr 13 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting that Hines made it in over Collin.  They both had good games but Collin was unstoppable, had Adi in his pocket.  Maybe throwing the Timber to the ground early in the match affected the votes"
OCLions,32h21j,spikebaylor,2,Mon Apr 13 20:23:48 2015 UTC,my guess is there is a fair bit of biased towards players who haven't been up there in a while?  Honestly the ToW would be full of a core set of regulars with a couple special cases each week which would be boring.
OCLions,32gxs4,daguru9,3,Mon Apr 13 18:39:50 2015 UTC,Now if they only had an Orlando City section on their app.

OCLions,32gmwt,macaco_gordinho,2,Mon Apr 13 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"Except that Bright House is being bought out by Charter Communications, wonder if they will keep Bright House as a brand or convert to Charter..."
OCLions,32gmwt,spikebaylor,2,Mon Apr 13 17:17:30 2015 UTC,I still feel like it wasnt long ago when bright house took over for TWC in the area.  Hopefully that goes smoothly for everyone involved.  I wonder if thats why its so long after all of the initial sponser signings.  I hope whoever it is does a good job with that wifi in the new stadium.
OCLions,32gmwt,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:29:07 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem clear if they are referring to wifi for the stadium & club staff or a public wifi that we might actually have some type of service in the stadium; since the Citrus Bowl is a cellular dead-zone when there are tens of thousands of people in it.
OCLions,32gmwt,spikebaylor,2,Mon Apr 13 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"It says ""high capacity wifi""  I suppose that could still only mean for staff, but really why advertise that?    The Citrus Bowl is ridiculous with the cell service.  Is it the stadium itself? or just the large amount of people all trying to use their phones?  Even text messages either don't go out or don't arrive till 20 mins later.  Either way I'm not sure there is much that can be done there other than a good wifi signal that people could use instead, or some sort of cell repeater type thing."
OCLions,32gmwt,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:25:53 2015 UTC,Hopefully you are right with the High Capacity Wifi.  A lot of times cell companies don't want to invest in high capacity commercial areas because they are holding out for an exclusive deal. I don't see the big providers boosting the Citrus Bowl service any time soon sadly... cause its terrible.
OCLions,32gmwt,manelandjeff,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"The Citrus Bowl has always been behind the times technologically.

OCLions,32g2dh,macaco_gordinho,9,Mon Apr 13 14:41:40 2015 UTC,Stott told a pool reporter that “it was not an obvious goal scoring opportunity.”   I agree! There were all those other defenders between Molino and the goal!  /s
OCLions,32g2dh,EASports_MUT,2,Mon Apr 13 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"Kevin Stott is, has always been, and will always be a terrible ref."
OCLions,32g2dh,secretlyadog,8,Mon Apr 13 17:59:45 2015 UTC,You can take distance into account; but there was nobody else around for days and he just pulled him down.  A professional foul for sure; but in my mind it's a straight red.
OCLions,32g2dh,j_andrew_h,3,Mon Apr 13 15:38:02 2015 UTC,I think if he would touched the ball then Chara would have gotten a red.
OCLions,32g2dh,baltimorescouser,5,Mon Apr 13 16:14:42 2015 UTC,Doesn't work that way. I mean.... it shouldn't work that way. But with Kevin Stott who the fuck knows.
OCLions,32g2dh,secretlyadog,0,Mon Apr 13 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with the no red... It's not like it was 30 yards out or fewer.... a lot could happen in 60+ yards, just like he explained."
OCLions,32g2dh,daguru9,5,Mon Apr 13 16:22:39 2015 UTC,Our fastest players was through on goal with only the goalie to beat.  Nobody was going to catch him.  By your standards literally nothing is an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.
OCLions,32g2dh,secretlyadog,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:01:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure he was the fastest on the field at that time, plus any number of issues could have happened...  Again, if it had been closer to the goal, then red no doubt.    Since the rule, as stated, includes distance as a factor, then I would agree.  Just MHO..."
OCLions,32g2dh,daguru9,5,Mon Apr 13 18:41:40 2015 UTC,Nah man. That's a straight red. I agree with the Gaffer. Stott rewrote the rule book on that call.
OCLions,32g2dh,catch_th3m_all,2,Mon Apr 13 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"Your humble opinion is WRONG! WRONG!!   I understand where you're coming from.   Personally, I don't think the distance factor should really be considered (although I understand it is considered) because it encourages these sort of fouls way up the field, and allowing players to get away with it lowers the quality of the soccer on display.   If players can take a cheap way out, they will."
OCLions,32g2dh,secretlyadog,2,Tue Apr 14 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's at minimum a yellow, and from there justification exists for a red, but it wasn't nearly that blatant. If there was more separation between the two of them and then he wrapped his arms around for a tackle, it'd have been more obvious a red."
OCLions,32g1vx,macaco_gordinho,3,Mon Apr 13 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"I love that it was instinctive goal, the kind that comes from the striker's mentality of any way of getting the ball in the goal the right way.  The 1st of many hopefully!"

OCLions,32dpu7,Thricey,9,Mon Apr 13 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"Couple of notes: Ricketts was great today. Okugo had a great first half but got beat a lot in the second half maybe just ran out of legs. Definitely look vulnerable when teams take the ball wide on us because both of our fullbacks are encouraged to get forward. Took the foot off the pedal in the second half which was fine with me. I thought that Heath had a great game plan and I have full faith in him. That Larin early, Rivas late combo will be deadly against tired legs. Go City!"
OCLions,32dpu7,arleavit,3,Sun Apr 12 23:20:48 2015 UTC,The Larin/Rivas combo will be even more deadly when we are up late in games and teams are trying to equalize. Heath's tactics were on point today. With the talent and coaching we have right now we are hanging well in this league. Excited to see how we progress with more time and experience.
OCLions,32dpu7,great_gator_bait,2,Mon Apr 13 01:27:22 2015 UTC,I really like Larin going forward. We are one good finisher away from being a very dangerous team and I'm hoping Larin is it.

OCLions,32dxrg,EASports_MUT,2,Mon Apr 13 13:10:41 2015 UTC,"If you want to print, go ahead and copy it off imgur. When I make these I don't really make them with print specs in mind (although I probably should). When I mean print specs I am talking about frame sizes. The good news is 98% if the image is composed of assets from Illustrator and there is only a small portion that is done in Photoshop. Even then, when I bring the assets into Photoshop, it is done in CMYK at 300dpi so it could be printed. I added the framing (also vector) because of the odd size of the image. Plus if one did want to print, you could put it in a cheap frame from say target and it will appear as if it was a custom matte. If you are really interested, in my free time this week I will see if I can assemble this 100% in illustrator and dropbox the ai file for you. BTW, we might know each other assuming you are at Tiburon and I worked there for almost 9 years. Bit of a small related yet unrelated fun fact. =)"

OCLions,32d7c6,arleavit,3,Sun Apr 12 23:06:11 2015 UTC,Agree though that the subs should've come quicker. We like to push our fullbacks up the pitch and look very vulnerable when teams go wide on us week in and week out. Would like to see us adjust to that but no complaints getting 3 points and a shut out in Portland is rare and should be celebrated
OCLions,32d7c6,arleavit,3,Sun Apr 12 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'm very happy to take three points from Portland. Not an easy trip to do that on.   And it could have gone their way very easily. We got lucky that some of their wide play just didn't pan out. They had like three really good chances in the final 15 minutes. Rickettes had a great save on one, and they just plain missed the other two."
OCLions,32d7c6,spiegro,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, the replay and commentators were focusing on the keeper on his line."
OCLions,32d7c6,spiegro,2,Sun Apr 12 23:19:35 2015 UTC,"True. To be fair although the keeper did a great job saving that, it was a pretty poor first penalty. Not enough in the corner and a height that is easiest to save. He looked pretty gassed going up there to take it though. Either way 3 points woooh"
OCLions,32d7c6,arleavit,2,Sun Apr 12 23:22:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Poor first penalty. He was really happy to get another shot at it.  He's not the Kaká of old, but the guy is still clearly class when he turns it on."
OCLions,32d7c6,spiegro,2,Sun Apr 12 23:28:17 2015 UTC,So so glad we could grab those points. Really hoping we can keep it up next week and then come home and finally win one in Orlando

OCLions,32dq2m,KarmaKalls,10,Sun Apr 12 23:24:56 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think we have played better on the road we have just got better results. Our last home match if we would have finished half our chances we would have won by 4 or 5. We got that goal against Houston and today we finished. Only difference.

OCLions,32dq2m,andrewthemexican,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:07:20 2015 UTC,"Our last home match if we would have finished half our chances we would have won by 4 or 5.   Personally I see the ability to produce results, especially when at home, as a direct symptom of the teams form. We have a much better away form than we do at home; not only with results but with the ball control and passing. We just seem more fluid when on the road than we do when we're at home and comfortable."
OCLions,32dq2m,EASports_MUT,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:37:36 2015 UTC,Well most teams when they play away tend to be more defensive forcing your team to break the line play and play the counter attack more. We play a more aggressive style which if we score early (or first) make for a good chance for a win.

OCLions,3243ro,daguru9,6,Fri Apr 10 12:37:54 2015 UTC,Good. He's getting into good positions and whatnot just needs that first goal to boost his confidence.
OCLions,3243ro,jmoney0999,4,Fri Apr 10 13:29:08 2015 UTC,"He was wide open in front of goal a couple of plays on Saturday, hopefully we can make that pass and get some of these easy goals to get things flowing."
OCLions,3243ro,j_andrew_h,3,Fri Apr 10 15:32:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. At least two chances I remember if the pass was made he would have had a tap in.   I think we just need an early goal to boost confidence. We are getting plenty of chances just haven't been finishing.
OCLions,3243ro,jmoney0999,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:45:47 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I'd love to see an early goal so that the guys can relax and be more composed in the box.  I feel like at home the crowd and pressure is leading to some rushed shots.  They'll settle in soon though and it's going to be fun to watch once they do.
OCLions,3243ro,j_andrew_h,3,Fri Apr 10 17:05:02 2015 UTC,I really believe the first time he puts one in the back of the net for us his confidence will skyrocket and he will turn into a force up top.  All he needs is that first one to go in and given the space he's been getting into and a full week of practice with the starters I am cautiously optimistic.
OCLions,3243ro,Generalparks,3,Fri Apr 10 16:33:31 2015 UTC,how this makes me feel
OCLions,324jlf,logjam13,6,Fri Apr 10 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"The only thing that I'm getting frustrated with is not the team on the field but the fans on social media talking about Rochez and Rivas being busts and how we need to go get a big name striker.  I'm not going to argue that either of these young players will be successful (time will tell); but give them a chance first.  Rivas was supposed to be playing LM and has hardly played there and Paterson was supposed to give Rochez and Larin time to adjust.    Okay, mini rant over.  I'm excited for Larin and even if he doesn't immediately start scoring he plays the #9 the way we need right now for the attacking Mids to play off off and get into the box more.  I'm hoping we can finally see Rivas and Shea starting on the left side to see how that looks.  We haven't had a dangerous player at LM all season and it shows.  Asside from some lovely crosses last week from Shea we haven't created many opportunities down the left side which is crazy if you watched OCSC last year with Mbengue and Boden terrorizing clubs down the left.     I'm looking forward to this game and I hope we have enough healthy players to take our game to Portland while Hines and Collin watch our backs with Portland's new direct attack."
OCLions,324jlf,j_andrew_h,2,Fri Apr 10 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you on Rochez and Rivas, and honestly I'm not sure what the hate is for Rivas.  In general I think he's looked good.  No more rusty and out of sync than the rest of the team has been so far.  He didn't look good up top, but I just don't think its a natural position for him.  He looked downright scary in his LM minutes last week and if, like the rest of the team, he starts getting his shots on target.... wooo that left foot is wicked.  I do miss me some Boden/Mbengue.  I think with consistent time and work Shea/Rivas can be that scary duo as well.  On the other side I'd like to see more teamwork and understanding between Molino and Ramos.  Both are doing pretty well on their own, but if they can start working together even better (mostly Molino needs to get over his Kaka obsession), our wings will be the scariest thing in MLS... and then oh yeah.. Kaka in the middle? psh.  The biggest frustrating thing to me so far is seeing and understanding the potential this team has and just not seeing it come to fruition yet.  Despite what people say about our striker issues, it's not like a lot of teams like Vancouver, Portland, and Philly last year where there's a lot of great talent but they really need ONE more good person to fill in a gaping hole.  We don't actually have any holes we just aren't quite clicking together yet."
OCLions,324jlf,spikebaylor,3,Sat Apr 11 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"Agree on all counts. When this club starts clicking it's going to be so much fun to watch. Rivas is going to do some serious damage at LM and things will open up further. That said if we get a lead, it would force teams to attack us more than they have.  I can't wait for the each game, the wait just kills me!"
OCLions,324jlf,j_andrew_h,3,Sat Apr 11 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"tell me about it.  Every home game I go to the game, and then when I get a chance watch it again on MLS Live.  Then I spend all week stalking reddit and other blogs and podcasts for more info.  Been listening to the Coaches show on 104.1 recently too.    Sadly I might not even get to watch most of the game tomorrow as I have prior engagements on Sundays (which I would ditch for a home game), and I'll miss the Toronto game and possibly the LA game for work travel. Its going to be a rough month or so.  Luckily my supervisor is a friend and fellow OCSC STH so he's already looking out for my best interests when possible (flying me home early to make the NER game)  Here's to hoping we have a Colorado style game, if not this weekend, then soon.  Teams will not be looking forward to playing us when we dominate the way we do, AND start dropping in goals."
OCLions,324jlf,spikebaylor,6,Sat Apr 11 23:55:09 2015 UTC,Bit nervous about this one not gonna lie. Portland is a tough place to play and while we have been good on the road this is the toughest place we'll have played by far.
OCLions,324jlf,coachhawley,5,Sun Apr 12 05:11:11 2015 UTC,"Bit early. Game isn't until the day after tomorrow. But whatever, I'm always happy to see things on this sub.  Couple things that have been on my nerves recently. First and foremost, it feels like we aren't a team, just a group of dudes that are individually good that got thrown onto a team together and expected to mesh. Every game we're looking more like a team, and I know that we're still waiting to gel, but its really frustrating me. No one seems to know the other person's style. Granted, that seems to be a theme in the MLS from what I've seen.  Second, Ricketts is making me nervous. I've yet to feel the least bit confident with him in goal. He is slow to react and seems to fall towards balls rather than leap for them. Hoping he either proves me wrong or is shifted out shortly. Truthfully, 37 is just a bit too old to play the sport, even for a keeper.  Third, Collin needs to cool his shit. He's always screaming at refs and going for crazy challenges. He's a great defender but needs to play like one. Watching him is like giving a ten year old the controller to play with your maxed-out character: He's great, but seems not to know what to do.  All that aside, our attackers are looking nice. I heard a lot of hate towards Larin but I didn't think he did poorly last time. Kaka is doing better and better, of course. I think we'll miss Ribeiro a good amount. Portland is a great side and we'll be away. Hoping for three points but not expecting them.  Oh, and I'd like to say as well that people should stop hoping for Chicharito. His agent straight up said no, and to be brutally honest, Lions aren't a good enough team yet to attract someone considered one of the biggest striking prospects when there are huge teams bidding for him."
OCLions,324jlf,NinnyBoggy,3,Sat Apr 11 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"You're right we are looking more and more like a team.  But do remember that this IS just a group of guys thrown together and expected to be a team.  They've only been together a couple months.  Compared to most teams in the league where the core has been together for years with a few fresh faces.  Also I don't think we've had the same starting line up for a single game this year.  Hopefully as time goes, and injuries work themselves up we'll end up with a good solid starting XI that learns to work together.  I think most of us are in agreement that Ricketts scares us.  Sounds like Hall is starting to get in there and practice with the GKs and Heath said he expects him to get some game time (if only with the second team) in the next couple weeks.  So there is hope.  Luckily for us we have the best record for conceded shots on goal, so Ricketts hasn't had to do TOO much.  I think other than his attitude with refs which hurts him the most, that Collin has made a good 180 from the preseason/nycfc game.  He seems much more level headed, makes tough but very important challenges without being too reckless, and is really commanding that back line well.  I thought Larin looked excellent last week.  Yeah he needs to work on finishing but so does the entire team.  Once he came in our chances on goal grew exponentially compared to previous weeks.  He was creating space, making nice runs, and was wide open in front of net a few times had the player with the ball passed it off.  I'm stoked to have him up front and rivas where he belongs on LM.  Not sure anyone who knows anything about OCSC really thought Chicharito was actually going to come here.  Most people laughed it off as soon as it was mentioned.  Lets ignore that theres little to no reason he'd want to come here (now) but we have no room to pay him.  Lastly, I love that these pre match threads keep popping up earlier and earlier.  In a few weeks it'll be posted immediately after the previous game ends :D and i'll enjoy every moment of it."

Like I said in another thread a couple days ago, I have nothing against Ricketts but from what I've watched of Hall when he was with Houston, he commands the box better, makes better and more decisive decisions and communicates better with the backline.  At this point in his career I feel like Ricketts is a better mentor and backup than a number 1."
OCLions,3203lv,Generalparks,5,Thu Apr 9 16:19:35 2015 UTC,That is the general consensus. I just hope whoever earns the job full time does a good job communicating. We have a great back line but need better communication especially at the end of games.
OCLions,3203lv,zrowny,4,Thu Apr 9 16:23:24 2015 UTC,Last game I saw Ricketts basically shouting at the wall on a couple free kicks. It really didn't seem like they were communicating well

He isn't Satan, but something about him occasionally rubs me the wrong way.  That being said, he is(in my opinion) a credit to the Lions for sure."

OCLions,31v6au,daguru9,11,Wed Apr 8 12:22:18 2015 UTC,"If Paterson doesn't pan out by July, we'll need a striker... But maybe a 34 year old with anger issues isn't who we should be relying on"
OCLions,31v6au,logjam13,2,Wed Apr 8 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"But the team is going to have to make a decision on Paterson soon... Half way through his loan, will need to decide on whether extending/buyout or return him.    While I think I might lean more towards Paterson since he is younger than Fabiano, Fabiano's experience and chemistry with Kaka may tip the scales in his favor...  Initially I wasn't so sure about this, but I am starting to warm to the idea...."
OCLions,31v6au,logjam13,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:00:26 2015 UTC,Why would we need to decide soon?  He's out of contract with Huddersfield in July so we can't send him back or extend the loan.  We may be looking at other options now but if we do sign him on a free I doubt it would be until June.  We've got too many strikers as is and if he has a decent April/May he was only supposed to be the guy until Rochez or Larin can step up. If we need a veteran backup I'd rather it be the cheaper one
OCLions,31v6au,logjam13,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"That's why I was saying they need to make a decision... whether to keep him or drop him at the end of the loan/contract.  If they were to keep him and pick up Fabiano, then I could see Larin and Mwanga heading to LCFC or loaned some where else.  They would not loan Rochez as a DP.  They have choices..... IF this rumor is true... and right now that is still a big IF :)"

The athlete's destination, according to his relatives, is Kaka team, Orlando City, which makes its debut season in the MLS (Major League Soccer). According to blog calculation, the attacker got angry lately with the board of the tricolor team, that at no time showed the desire to renew the bond for a longer period than the current one. Bruised, Luis Fabiano has depleted the Sao Paulo team. Earlier this year, at the request of Vanderlei Luxemburgo, Flamengo tried his hiring. Sought, the press office of the player said unknown information. The Orlando City also denies any agreement with the athlete."

OCLions,31ttql,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:40:02 2015 UTC,"Picking him up would be a great addition but not for the price he will command. If we got him and he performs well, he would leave for Europe again. We have plenty of young players that are finding their way. Larin and Rochez will pick up the slack, Rebeiro played CB last season yet the transition has been practically seamless, and Patterson could really provide the veteran forward play that we need. I hope we let the Chicharito rumors die as rumors."
OCLions,31ttql,kfloey,3,Wed Apr 8 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"I would totally be OK for Chicharito for a season or even just half a season. Helps him gain confidence and find his groove to restart his career in Europe, and gives us someone who knows how to score to work with our really young strikers.   He may not seem old enough or the type of personality for a mentoring role but every little bit of experience helps."
OCLions,31ttql,andrewthemexican,2,Wed Apr 8 13:36:40 2015 UTC,"He has been too lazy with Man U, that's why they sent him over to RM. Watching him play with El Tri, he isnt working hard enough up top. Don't get me wrong, he is a quality striker, it's just that his mindset is off and he is way too lazy. If that changes (which it might in front of our supporter groups) then I will take him even for half a season."
OCLions,31ttql,kfloey,3,Wed Apr 8 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if he puts out the effort and really goes in with the mindset needed to jump start his career (sort of like Brek is), that's how I want him.  Not to come half-assing it"

OCLions,31pwkw,NinnyBoggy,8,Tue Apr 7 05:49:45 2015 UTC,"1) Larin will get the startover Rochez for the time being.  Coach seems to think there is a fitness issue with rochez and it sounds like it was never really his intention to start him immediately.  Larin is the same but with paterson and ribeiro out and larin in shape he gets the nod.  Sounds like we'll see Pato soon.  2) The late goals are i think overall a focus issue.  We shouldnt be giving up those fouls near the box, lazier marking on set plays, the player wall is not nearly as resolute as the suppoters wall, etc.  Theres some bad luck there too but we put ourselves in that situation.  We have 5 goals against.  1 pk, 1 run of play and 3 from set pieces.  We obviously have a problem to fix.  3) im one of those new fans, but i played soccer my entire childhood so im not ignorant.  I also watched a crap load of games in the second half of last season. I read a lot about the league and generally know what im talking about or i stay quiet.  Its good to have new fans.  If the newbies are screaming at kaka to shoot its not out of arrogance.. its passion and that is something to embrace in new fans.  4) Ricketts will make a fine 2nd string for Hall but as it stands he scares me.  Not as commanding as his 6'4 frame should be, indecisive, slow and im guessing not doing a good job communicating as there have been a few miscommunication blunders.  We havent seen much fallout yet from his tending but thats mostly due to some solid defensive work by collin and the boys.... and good luck.    Other than that just more confidence.  Better finishing will come with confidence.  Need to work on set plays on both sides of the field.  Obvious issues defending them and not much to show on offense in that department either.  Sure Kaka got a goal on a free kick but we all know there was a ton of luck to that one.  We tend to create a lot of corner kick opportunities but Kakas service for most of them has been poor and when it is good.. no one seems to be there."
OCLions,31pwkw,spikebaylor,2,Tue Apr 7 12:05:56 2015 UTC,"1) For my money, it will be Larin, but that's because I've been more impressed with his little playing time than with Rochez's little playing time. Inchy will know best.  2) I think to lose late in a game is unlucky, and perhaps it was both times, but I think they both came about as a result of us pushing for the winning goal in the late stages which, if we had converted on one of our many chances, wouldn't have been an issue.   3) I share the same ire sometimes, but I try to stay open minded and urge people to express themselves. I've dealt with a couple of idiots in the stands who seem to know better than Kaka. But with any large growth in attendance, you're going to get people who don't seem to understand. I know when I started following the sport in 06, I was just as uneducated.  4) I tend to agree. I feel that Ricketts still has some quality, as he has proved himself over a long career. But I think once Tally Hall is fit, he might get a shot between the sticks.  Good post"
OCLions,31pwkw,House_on_the_Sea,4,Tue Apr 7 10:09:29 2015 UTC,"1) It will be Larin.  From everything I've read Rochez took some time off after the U-20 CONCACAF Tournament and he is still trying to get fit and in form.  We may seem him subbed on late but Larin should get the start.  2) I think it's a mixture of being unlucky and losing focus at the end.  Both came off silly fouls just outside the box that put us in a bad spot.  We brought them both on ourselves which is something we just can't do that late in the game at that spot on the field.    3) It's been an adjustment with all the new fans but I know that all these new fans are good for the club.  I have 4 season tickets so each game I've tried to bring a new friend with me to both expose them a bit to the team and try to teach them a little about soccer.  Everybody I've taken so far leaves wanting to come back and see this team more.  I don't mind them yelling shoot everytime we have the ball because at least they are watching and getting in to the game.  They'll learn that it's not a great idea to shoot from 35 yards out with 2 defenders in front of you that will easily deflect the ball.  4) I'm uneasy about Ricketts.  Always have been, even when he was with Portland.  He has moments where he looks good and then others where I don't even think he knows what he's doing. From what I watched of Hall last year before he got hurt I liked.  He commands the box well, makes good and decisive decisions and above all else he COMMUNICATES well with the back line.  I feel like that is out biggest issue right now.  We'll see though, ACL injuries can be a bitch so I like that he isn't rushing his rehab.  I think he was brought in with the intention of once he's healthy he is the guy in net.    Good post, anytime anybody has a thought they want to discuss make a post!  We might not be a massive sub but I feel like there are a good number of people who contribute and discuss."
OCLions,31pwkw,Generalparks,3,Tue Apr 7 12:37:37 2015 UTC,"1) Larin. Paterson is definitely first choice, but after that it's really a toss-up at this point between the 3 young guys (Rivas, Larin, Rochez). I think Larin showed some glimpses of his athleticism on Friday, but he is still so raw.  2)Definitely a lack of focus. The wall should have stopped the goal from Silva, and even though I think Rivero had a beautiful finish, we had 3-4 guys who were simply not ready to defend that ball in from Vancouver. I will add that we have had plenty of calls go against us at home so far. The line judge on Friday was awful. Collin also seems to have a reputation already. Even though he has had some professional fouls, there have been some questionable decisions against him, imo.  3) I've been an OCSC fan since 2010, and I absolutely love it. It's crazy to see how far the game has come stateside. I remember in high school having one friend to talk EPL with, and he was a Manc, so it was, for the most part, terrible. My Facebook feed and all the bars around downtown are now littered with posts and shirts on Saturday mornings. The fact that people who are just getting into the sport are following MLS is wonderful. Only bigger and better things to come in the future, and I hope our hometown team can become one of the elite teams of this league!  4) Hall is first choice for me, but Ricketts hasn't been as much the problem as our lack of goal scoring. When you get a clear cut chance, you have to be able to put it away or you will leave yourself susceptible to losing in stoppage time from a set piece.   Personally, I like many others, would like to see Shea moved up to LM/LW and start Boden or even have 3 at the back with St. Ledger, Collin, Hines in a 343 or 352 and have Shea and Ramos as wingbacks. Shea has been great as a LB, but he has shown he can score in this league when he was 20-22 with FC Dallas. We need the additional goals right now from our midfield players with the form our strikers have been in."
OCLions,31pwkw,KeyserSooooze,2,Tue Apr 7 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"I was one of the Shea at LM proponents early on, but he has done a solid job as defender and has been pushing into the attack more and more.  The reason it looks bad is because Rivas was either playing up top or injured and we had Neal or Avila over there who havent contributed much on the attack.  Shea/Rivas is going to be a fantastic combination.    Heath probably could have played Boden/Shea while Rivas was out but since his ultimate goal is Shea in the back.. he needed to keep him there to get experience and it has paid off as Shea looks better and better every game.  I think we should reserve our cries for Shea in midfield until we get a full game or two with our desired lineup on the left."
OCLions,31pwkw,spikebaylor,3,Tue Apr 7 13:54:01 2015 UTC,I think you're spot on here.  The Boden/Shea combo would've been cool to see but Shea needs as much time at LB as he can to get comfortable with it.  When the entire team is healthy and we have our best possible starting 11 on the pitch I think a lot of our issues will work themselves out.  Rivas/Paterson/Hall coming in and contributing when they are all healthy will be a nice thing to see.
OCLions,31pwkw,Generalparks,2,Tue Apr 7 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"1) Larin until Rochez is fully fit.  Will be intresting to see if Larin gets set to Louisville once our injury issues clear up.  2) Way too much emotional play late at home.  Yes, we want a win but there is no need to play hack-n-slash for a miracle goal.  I'd also argue Heath has got to start being looser with his subs.  He has left 5 of 15 subs unused so far (1 of 15 for opponents) with two of the 10 used being ""oh fuck"" subs in injury time.  I know there have been special situations but this is a pattern that has carried over from the USL-PRO years.  3) I am absolutely loving how the city has taken to the team and all the new fans.  Not sure I've seen more than 5 or so Magic items (shirts, jerseys, car magnets) total in the last year and I'm seeing that many OCSC items daily.  Even converted a life long soccer hater to buying a jersey and tickets to a half dozen games just by a single home game.    4) As for what needs to change, our corner kicks have been dreadful so far with a majority not even making it past the first defender.  This is another holdover from 2014 where it seems like 3/4 of corners were directly at the first defender with OCSC players hoping for a bad clearance.  A bigger variety is needed to at least try fooling the opposition."
OCLions,31pwkw,pvdfan,2,Tue Apr 7 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the subs.  We used all three this game but one out of necessity and another for last ditch effort.  Otherwise id guess rivas woulr have been the only actual switch.  Ramos needed to come out a good 15 mins earlier.. and im sure the only reason he did was more to get another striker on for the last min.  Ramos was dying 3/4 of the way through.  Im guessing due to intl duty/travel/getting knocked around, what have you.  I know we dont want to take Kaka off but he also became quite a bit more anon in the second half.. even going so far as having molino and rivas take kicks.  It looked like a mild injury but we could have used a good kickstart and no reason to risk Kaka with more injuries.  Id say that has been my only major issue with Heath so far his year.  I think he's done well with the starting lineups considering what we've had.. he just hasnt been as good at reading the game late in play and making the necessary changes."
OCLions,31pwkw,spikebaylor,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:03:54 2015 UTC,"Turner had that problem early last year where he would collapse after a match and need help back to the looker room while defensive subs sat unused.  Redding also had issues late in matches with endurance and was kept out there.  For Kaka, I wonder how much the negative reaction Houston after being subbed will change plans going forward.    What's crazy is he has said on the coach's show he keeps his subs unused so the other team can not counteract them.  That's great in the 60th minute but not the 80th when the other team has used all three.  It also feels like the old player in him never wanted to be subbed and he treats his players that way."
OCLions,31pwkw,pvdfan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"I think Larin will probably get the start although I hope Rochez gets it. Rochez has much more experience professionally and with 29 goals in 59 appearances for his last club, he is more comfortable with finding the back of the net. Larin has looked awkward and slow on the field although some of that could be attributed to nerves. He seems like he just wants to be a stand-and-shoot striker rather than someone who moves around and creates space. I think that Rochez's style of football will be more on par with Kaka and Molino, who seemed to pull most of the weight in the attacking third during last weeks game against DC."

OCLions,31ne3b,daguru9,12,Mon Apr 6 17:36:16 2015 UTC,I felt so bad for him as soon as he grabbed the back of his leg.  Get better soon big guy!
OCLions,31ne3b,j_andrew_h,6,Mon Apr 6 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Really a shame for him and the team as it would be nice to go into just one week where no one is injured.  Hopefully he is back in form before the gold cup.  Id love to see that rivas/kaka/ribeiro lineup when molino is out.  I just cant wait till we are in a position to NOT have neal or avila starting.  Im not against them.. they'll be good backups but they are certainly not what the team needs as week to week starters.  Looking forward to getting Higuita back as well.  And my lord i cant wait for Tally Hall to get in there.  Ricketts hasnt done terrible or anything, but mostly because he hasnt had to do much.  In the times hes really needed to command the box and be a pressence outside of just blocking shots i feel like he has let us down a lot.  Stays locked on his line when he should be coming out and taking control in the air... and goes way off his line in times when there is no way he is going to win the ball, or is hesitant when making that decision and leaves the goal wide open.  We have gotten lucky on quite a few occasions."
OCLions,31ne3b,spikebaylor,3,Mon Apr 6 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"And my lord i cant wait for Tally Hall to get in there.   YES PREACH IT.  Same boat, nothing against Ricketts.  I just think Hall commands better and makes better decisions."
OCLions,31ne3b,Generalparks,2,Mon Apr 6 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"I think Ribeiro's a great player and I'm glad we have him in the squad, but this may honestly help us down the road. He's not a striker and he was playing too well to drop him so we played him out of position. Now we have to play Larin/Paterson/Róchez up there and maybe our goal production will increase with an actual striker. Then Pedro can work his way back into the midfield"
OCLions,31ne3b,logjam13,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:47:20 2015 UTC,"Just heard that on Philips file.  One or more of Rochez, Larin, and Paterson is going to have to step up."
OCLions,31ne3b,2ndgoround,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"Fuck.  That should help in the long run though. Larin/Patterson will need to step up, maybe even Rochez. They have to show who's going to take over as the converting striker. All we need is someone who can finish. Kaka can get the rest. A Poor man's Podolski would see us a thousand points clear."

OCLions,31mcaf,Bxdx003,5,Mon Apr 6 13:30:37 2015 UTC,Well at least Zlatan wants to play in MLS in 2016/17. And we might be able to snag him over LA/LA/NYC...
OCLions,31mcaf,logjam13,6,Mon Apr 6 15:20:52 2015 UTC,That would be Awesoooooom! But so unlikely.
OCLions,31mcaf,qoou,3,Mon Apr 6 15:48:27 2015 UTC,If we got Zlatan as a striker...

OCLions,31mcaf,Nickp1991,2,Mon Apr 6 21:41:38 2015 UTC,Javier Hernandez to Orlando would be an unreal signing
OCLions,31mcaf,NinnyBoggy,2,Mon Apr 6 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"I can't really think of much of a reason for him to come, if we're being honest. I would lose my shit if he did, as Chicharito would dominate here and I would love every second of it, but he's playing for one of the huge BPL teams and on loan on one of the biggest teams not just in BBVA, but in the world. I don't see him coming to a what many consider a ""retirement league"" just because he isn't doing as well as he hoped while at arguably the biggest teams in the entire world. If he came, I would probably literally cry, but I just can't imagine any reason for him to come. This league would be easy mode for him. He's an extremely talented young striker that has already proven exactly how worth it he is, and has many large european sides bidding for him. Unless he just reaaaaaaaaaally wants to play with Kaka, he has no incentive to come here."
OCLions,31mcaf,whtge8,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"Unless he just wants to play and still make good amounts of money. He will likely never see the pitch unless Benzema gets hurt. Even in Manchester they still have Rooney and RVP, and Falcao too I guess. He can still contribute but just needs to go to a team where he can play and be the first option."

OCLions,31dh9x,coachhawley,19,Sat Apr 4 01:00:30 2015 UTC,Maddening.
OCLions,31dh9x,messy_messiah,11,Sat Apr 4 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"Very, VERY sad way to end this match. That being said, I thought we again show a lot of quality in the build up and I think Rivas coming back into the squad for a full 90 should alleviate some of the troubles we've been happening. shit, maybe some amazing striker will come to OC once they see they product we're getting in our midfield and build up."
OCLions,31dh9x,DELIVERER407,11,Sat Apr 4 01:08:23 2015 UTC,Once again we maintain control for the entire game but can't win.   Sad but it will get better I believe.

OCLions,31dh9x,wonder_chicken,7,Sat Apr 4 01:08:36 2015 UTC,Molino put the ball in the net. If not find someone else who can
OCLions,31dh9x,arleavit,2,Sat Apr 4 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, he could have fed the ball to someone else in a number of those situations and just decided to go for it."
OCLions,31dh9x,twelve_parsecs,2,Sat Apr 4 01:59:35 2015 UTC,Which I would be much more fine with if he had any clue where the net is.   /s
OCLions,31dh9x,zrowny,7,Sat Apr 4 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"We need a striker. A healthy Martin Paterson may be the answer. But if we not we're going to struggle. Kaká can't be asked to carry the team. Rivas and Ribeiro aren't truly strikers. Molino isn't actually a winger. And he's not the center of a team built for a league above anymore. There's a reason he went from 5 goals in 3 seasons to 22 in one and now we're asking him to play a whole new position against better competition. You can't rely on him like we did last year.  With Higuita, Paterson, and Rivas being back next week maybe we'll see some improvement. If not, we have an unused international spot and need to find a finisher from abroad.  But we're a team built out of teenagers in a new league. We're not supposed to make the playoffs and we've been dominating seasoned MLS teams in almost every facet of the game. Something will click eventually"
OCLions,31dh9x,logjam13,2,Sat Apr 4 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"I agree I feel that people want everything to happen so quickly. I think some fans forget how new this team is, how many young players we have, and how long these kids have been IN Orlando. I mean Rochez has been here the least amount of time is still getting fit. It's tough for players this young to adjust to life in a new country, culture, and away from family. They'll put it together though and I'm excited to see the results when they do!"
OCLions,31dh9x,Multicolored_Pens,3,Sat Apr 4 11:36:56 2015 UTC,"Who's going to step up to replace Ribeiro in the starting lineup? Rivas, Larin?"
OCLions,31dh9x,Somebody_Call911,7,Sat Apr 4 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"Kenny fucking Cooper, sign him up!!!"
OCLions,31dh9x,mikesicle,2,Sat Apr 4 03:12:28 2015 UTC,"That might actually be a valid solution. I think OCSC should be fairly high up in the waiver draft order, as it's based on points (no offense)"

OCLions,31dh9x,pvdfan,2,Sat Apr 4 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Who teaches the players to avoid the ball when they're part of the wall?
OCLions,31dh9x,Lauxman,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:27:34 2015 UTC,Did the keeper call it? Its most likely a communication problem last second.
OCLions,31dp2d,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sat Apr 4 02:16:43 2015 UTC,"It was hard to rate Ribeiro fairly seeing as he only played 18 minutes and got injured. Besides that I would def give my MOTM to Collin. Fantastic bit of defending from him. Solid leader at the back, I cant recall any major fouls he gave away, some great tackles, and fantastic in the air, and not to mention NO CARD lol. Really awful that they couldn't keep a clean sheet as I thought he put in a real shift tonight."
OCLions,31dp2d,rynbelz,2,Sat Apr 4 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"I think Larin was good for a 19 year old coming in cold. His hold up was strong but he was a little rushed on his shots, but he'll settle in I believe.  We really need to see Rivas at LM and Paterson up top to see if we really are missing a finisher.  I don't think we are, I just think we've had some bad luck with injuries and players that aren't fully gelled yet in the final third.  That said we created a lot more chances and looked to be a very dangerous side, even more than usual."
OCLions,31dp2d,j_andrew_h,3,Sat Apr 4 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"other than finishing, i thought Larin up top and Rivas on the left was miles ahead of where we have been.  If those two and Molino can get their confidence up in shooting, and we'll be scary.  Getting Paterson and Rochez fully fit will be huge.  But yeah I thought Larin did really well actually.  Our biggest issue besides finishing was taking one step or one second too long to play those through balls and it kept making Larin offside.  Thought he was making his runs and turning in really well, we just held the ball too long.  I think we know that our backline is holding its own fairly well.  Well enough to stop putting Avila/Neal in on LM over getting Rivas over there now that he is fit.    I think Ceren has done a pretty good job.  As long as he keeps a cool head he'll be great.  I'd rather see Higuita there starting but I'm not scared when we need to put Ceren in for him or Okugo when need be."
OCLions,31dp2d,spikebaylor,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with absolutely everything you just said.  Rivas on the left Paterson, Rochez and Larin rotating up top... should be lethal!"

OCLions,31dp2d,logjam13,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:27:12 2015 UTC,"Last night was a story of either the midfield wasn't in touch with Larin, or Larin wasn't anticipating the midfielders passes.  Maybe a combination of the two.  Regardless, I just hope Larin can keep that momentum of his performance in Portland."

OCLions,3176fc,daguru9,3,Thu Apr 2 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"I doubt we would be able to fill the upper bowl, so no need to open it if you don't need too.  If we can sell out the lower and middle sections, that would be awesome.  However... I do believe that the LA Galaxy game could get us close to filling the whole stadium.  Especially with the Mexico vs. Costa Rica ticket package."
OCLions,3176fc,TB_Dark,3,Fri Apr 3 14:46:12 2015 UTC,I looked at that ticket package and it's basically trying to fill up the plaza. So I would bet they literally have the entire lower bowl filled for that game. They could open the upper bowl but the demand would have to be insane and sell out early (which it already looks like they have)

OCLions,3176fc,daguru9,3,Fri Apr 3 13:59:28 2015 UTC,Depends. Apparently he was back at training doing some light work but not full drills. Could be anywhere from a couple of weeks to two months

OCLions,3176fc,jmoney0999,3,Fri Apr 3 14:44:19 2015 UTC,He is so indecisive about when to come out for the ball and when to let it go. Although it isn't totally his fault. The amount of poor back passes and headers from our defense to our keeper that are in no mans land really demonstrate this to me. I'd rather us just boot the ball out of bounds then take the risks we are taking.

OCLions,318j82,MySmotheredHope,2,Fri Apr 3 00:01:24 2015 UTC,A few do look poor quality (for example the jerseys being pink lol) but there are a few authentics here and there. My advice to anyone would be to contact the seller and ask if they're authentic or replica
OCLions,318j82,MySmotheredHope,3,Fri Apr 3 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"Good advice.  Here are some things I happened to notice on eBay:   Double MLS patches on replica jersey when there should be only one. Very faded MLS patch on arms Orlando City crest with very thick white line around border (this was on the same jerseys that had faded MLS crests) ""Authentic""-labeled jersey without the raised ""Orlando City"" lettering on the back.   Hope that helps!  Edit to clarify: There's a difference between ""replica"" and ""knockoff"". Replicas are official and the knockoffs are made by an unauthorized party and usually do not have the same style/materials/quality.  I know it's obvious to most, but some new to soccer might not know this stuff."

OCLions,318ffi,Ronaldmethot,7,Thu Apr 2 20:44:47 2015 UTC,I know fans have a love affair with Boden but there is nearly zero chance he will/should start over a healthy Brek at the same position.
OCLions,318ffi,pvdfan,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:06:57 2015 UTC,this lineup was just projected for tomorrow. Obviously Shea is the first choice
OCLions,318ffi,okiedawg,2,Thu Apr 2 21:15:15 2015 UTC,The point of the 4-2-3-1 is to be an aggressive high scoring offensive. Through the first three games there were actually quite a few shots and shots on goal. We just can't find the freakin' net.
OCLions,314w8m,spikebaylor,5,Thu Apr 2 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Larin up top and a combo of Pedro-Kaká-Molino behind him. I'd rather move Pedro wide left, since he'll be inside anyway, and allow Shea to roam as the width. We know Kaká connects well with both Pedro and Molino but not how Molino and Ribeiro link up. Our left flank is exposed but I trust Ribeiro to put in at least enough effort to provide something. If it doesn't work out Rivas should be available as a sub in the second half"
OCLions,314w8m,logjam13,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:35:37 2015 UTC,Good point.  have not seen pedro work much on the left but i suppose most of my same arguments for kaka over there could work for ribeiro as well.
OCLions,314w8m,logjam13,2,Thu Apr 2 01:38:58 2015 UTC,He's anything but a winger but if we have to play one out of position I'd rather it be him. His work rate would make up for lack of experience
OCLions,314w8m,daguru9,2,Thu Apr 2 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I would rather they flip the midfield, with 2 attacking mids and 1 defensive mid...  Leave Okugo as the DM and have Ribiero and Kaka start side by side.    If one needs to play back in defensive situations that is fine, but mainly playing forwards.   In a few games, especially when Ceren was in the midfield, the three were almost stacked: Kaka with Ceren directly behind him, and Okugo playing deep.  I think Okugo is good enough to handle that area himself and I think may be more efficient alone."
OCLions,3120p7,Generalparks,11,Wed Apr 1 13:47:52 2015 UTC,I love that the club plays around with April Fools Day and has a sense of humor.  Last year was the manatee rebrand and now this one.  The quotes in the article just make it all that better.
OCLions,3120p7,KeyserSooooze,10,Wed Apr 1 13:49:53 2015 UTC,"The best line in the article.   Head Coach Adrian Heath thinks it may even give his team a tactical advantage, stating, “Our players will be virtually camouflaged against the pitch making it difficult for the opposition to spot them making runs. Imagine Kaká slipping into the box unnoticed and unmarked. Lethal.”"

OCLions,313t19,landonmp,3,Wed Apr 1 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"getting to the match should be cake.  Last game they had like 6-7 busses just waiting to take people out.  COULD be a bit of a wait going back downtown after the game since it is everybody all at once, but you could always just walk back.  There has been a pretty large crowd walking back both games so no reason to feel unsafe, and it's not nearly as long of a walk as it seems, especially being pumped up after a game.  Lots of chanting and having a good time."
OCLions,313t19,spikebaylor,2,Thu Apr 2 00:37:21 2015 UTC,I've parked downtown for both games so far and taken the bus in.  No issues at all.  Might be a little backed up after the match but it's not bad.
OCLions,313t19,Generalparks,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:31:41 2015 UTC,It was perfect. No wait either way.

OCLions,313t19,paintballpmd,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:07:42 2015 UTC,Not exactly sure but last home game I noticed buses lining up an hour before the stadium opened. It might have been earlier than that just wasn't paying attention so tomorrow the stadium opens at 5 so 4 I guess. Maybe earlier though.
OCLions,312dnp,paintballpmd,4,Wed Apr 1 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, security doesn't ask to empty pockets.  They only check handbags, purses, etc.  As long as it's not obvious, then I don't think there would be any issues."
OCLions,312dnp,misanthropicbuddha,3,Wed Apr 1 15:31:16 2015 UTC,They do have the metal detector wands and seem to scan people randomly or at least inconsistently.
OCLions,312dnp,j_andrew_h,4,Wed Apr 1 16:50:13 2015 UTC,I've seen plenty of people get flasks into the stadium without a problem. That doesn't mean you won't get caught but it seems low risk.  Also it seems to help if you're wearing purple. The only people I saw getting the wand/ocular pat down weren't wearing OC colors.
OCLions,312dnp,Yeti_Cat,3,Wed Apr 1 15:32:40 2015 UTC,The gate I went through at the last game was getting like every third person with the wand. Was glad I didn't have my flask on me then but it's really random luck if you will or wont get it.

OCLions,312dnp,whtge8,3,Wed Apr 1 16:26:21 2015 UTC,I wanted to bring mine but just wanted to take shots of the supporters and the stadium. Don't have a lens long enough to get a good shot anyways.
OCLions,312dnp,pvdfan,2,Wed Apr 1 17:54:10 2015 UTC,Really hit or miss.  I've seen fans with high end consumer DSLRs with 300mm lenses get in and seen others with small attached lenses get measured.
OCLions,312dnp,zrowny,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what I expected... Do you happen to remember who was the security company?

I've done some work for CSC before (working UCF football games), and there's definitely a lot of people who will be lax with the rules as bagcheckers for whatever reason (they're lazy, they feel bad for a parent with little kids, a hot girl has a ""nice set,"" etc)."

OCLions,30z1oy,TK85,6,Tue Mar 31 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"yep ground breaking was back in october/november.  I forget when exactly.. fun event though.  As a fun note, if you watch some of the MLS Soccer studio shows, particularly Starting Lineup for sure, you can see a purple paint can in the back on the wall.  That is a souvenir from the ground breaking.  As for opening in time for 2016.  If we stay entirely on schedule with no major changes then for sure we will be open.  It sounded like everything was on track.  However there has been a lot of talk and speculation about a possible expansion of the stadium based on attendance on our first two games.  Phil Rawlins is a smart guy and wouldn't make drastic moves based on two games.  Which means we'll need at least 5-6 more great showings, if not even more (lot of talk about attendance during 100% humidity, 90 degree summer afternoon/evening games) before that decision is made.  If they DO decide to expand the stadium to a significant amount, then I could see the stadium being delayed a bit into the season.  I know I'm not the only one who is extremely excited for the stadium.  The renovations at the citrus bowl are very nice, it is always done up in beautiful purple and gold, and it does feel like a first rate place for the team to play.  But there is a lot to be said for having our own stadium, run by the organization, grass instead of turf, better concessions (hopefully), perfect walking distance from downtown, and all of the good things that come with an SSS."

Also, soccer is one of the last bastions for hipsters to watch sports and feel like they are counter-culture and cool.  So, as it becomes mainstream, I would imagine some of them are feeling threatened and will react by diminishing any newcomer's allegiance to the team because they weren't there when they played in front of a 200 person crowd.    I'm not saying this is true for any specific person or group, but as a people watcher, I can see this happening."

But I'm surprised he didn't mention anything about the terrible use of the refs ""giving us the advantage"". So many times we get fouled on a break and the ref doesn't blow the whistle because we still have the ball then our player is 1v3 with no outlet."
OCLions,30v23a,jmoney0999,8,Tue Mar 31 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"I think the officiating in MLS is just plain awful. The league has developed a reputation for being ""physical"" but from what I've watched this season - all games, not just ours - is that refs just don't call obvious fouls. There have been egregious errors all over the country in just a month of play. Obvious reds not given, wrongful reds given, fouls ignored, offsides (of entire teams) ignored.  I think they way we play is a reason why we're seeing more calls going against us. A lot of MLS squads play hoofball. We're first in the league in short passing and last in long balls. We build from the back and rely more on technical ability than most teams and we're seeing more adverse affects because we're in a position to be fouled more often"
OCLions,30v23a,logjam13,4,Tue Mar 31 03:32:36 2015 UTC,It's bad when MLS not only can fill a youtube video each week on bad calls but profit off the damn thing.

The midfield couldn't move the ball around, and the back line seemed to play too far up as Montreal got the ball past the defense.   As always, Kaka seemed to get the team out of the jam, and everybody seems to have stepped up late in the first.  I hope that momentum carries over in the second."

OCLions,30mjfs,selbbog,2,Sat Mar 28 20:31:31 2015 UTC,Woo goal! 2-1
OCLions,30mjfs,Bakesail,2,Sat Mar 28 20:36:29 2015 UTC,Holy fuck. Down 2-0 to tying it with the Equalizer in 2 minutes!
OCLions,30mjfs,Bakesail,2,Sat Mar 28 20:38:31 2015 UTC,Well this is just nutty now.
OCLions,30mjfs,selbbog,2,Sat Mar 28 20:38:47 2015 UTC,Holy shit we're right back in this! Ribeiro and Kaka tearing it up!
OCLions,30mjfs,nautika,2,Sat Mar 28 20:39:15 2015 UTC,Woooooo! It's happening!
OCLions,30mjfs,secretlyadog,2,Sat Mar 28 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"Also, I missed it.  Why is Ribeiro missing his number?"
OCLions,30mjfs,misanthropicbuddha,3,Sat Mar 28 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"Blood on the first, didnt have another with his number or something so they informed the ref and gave him a numberless one."

OCLions,30mjfs,misanthropicbuddha,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:42:00 2015 UTC,Orlando has changed their formation to a 3-4-3.
OCLions,30mjfs,misanthropicbuddha,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:07:34 2015 UTC,Why doesn't Ribero have his name on his kit?
OCLions,30mjfs,baltimorescouser,3,Sat Mar 28 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"He got blood on his shirt earlier, and Orlando didn't have a spare at the ready.  Therefore, blank shirt."
OCLions,30mjfs,misanthropicbuddha,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:50:19 2015 UTC,Thanks! I figured that was the reason but I was sure.
OCLions,30mjfs,baltimorescouser,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"Well we had some goals from open play, so there's that. Overall a good draw."
OCLions,30mjfs,selbbog,-1,Sat Mar 28 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"Danny Mwanga should never play for us again, he is ridiculously bad."
OCLions,30mjfs,KubaBVB09,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"He was always going to be a reclamation project. I thought he should have been sent down to LCFC before Rivera but we need the MLS experience. But he's an emergency player and dead last on our depth chart. If he turns it around, we've got a decent 3rd/4th choice striker. If he doesn't he's gone"
OCLions,30mjfs,OrlandoCity-Fan,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:17:49 2015 UTC,What's up with abandoning the match thread at half
OCLions,30mt6g,Czarconcepts,13,Sat Mar 28 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but this thread is ridiculous. Nobody is passing up an open shot to pick out Kaka. We are playing players up top who are out of their natural position. Yesterday was the first time we've started a natural striker up top and Mwanga isn't exactly known as a goalscorer. Its common for young players to be hesitant to shoot, throw in the fact that they're playing out of position and you have a player who simply is trying not to screw up. This isn't a crappy sports movie where the game plan is to get your star the ball at all costs. Sometimes Kaka may be that player they lay it off to  but it's not because they feel the need to give only him the opportunities."
OCLions,30mt6g,OCSC2011,3,Sun Mar 29 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100% it has been one of my biggest problem with the team so far. But I feel like they have gotten a little better at it but they still need more confidence, once the players gain that confidence the team will look for opportunities instead of Kaka all the time."
OCLions,30mt6g,djveneko,3,Sat Mar 28 23:26:53 2015 UTC,"Our healthy strikers are really young. And one of our best (Paterson) is still injured. This is a team still gelling together, and I really liked what I saw out of Ribeiro today. He worked hard all over the pitch, including getting into dangerous areas in the box. It's how he got his goal today.   Conversely, Mwanga offered nothing today that I could see. Minimal hold-up play and poor passing. He's behind Ribeiro and Rivas as far as I'm concerned. Jury's still out on Rochez, but I hope he'll find some form later this season."
OCLions,30mt6g,great_gator_bait,3,Sun Mar 29 05:01:09 2015 UTC,It was very obvious from the onset but I'm totally okay with it at this point in the season. Half our attacking force was in the USL and rather not risk it yet.  Now later on down the line like game #28 I would hope they would not be forcing it all to kaka still.
OCLions,30mt6g,andrewthemexican,3,Sun Mar 29 11:43:58 2015 UTC,yesterday's squad was rough.  I would much rather have avila or mwanga forcing it to kaka so he can try to make something happen than have them shoot it 20 yds over the goal again.  once an actual fwd starts up top (rivas filling in was ugly and mwanga isnt good) there will be more fluidity in the final 3rd
OCLions,30mt6g,feezy12,3,Sun Mar 29 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"Our strikers will come into form but if we're being honest, I want Kaka to take the final shot."
OCLions,30mt6g,catch_th3m_all,4,Sun Mar 29 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think it will die down eventually. A lot of these players can learn a lot from the likes of Shea, Collin & Kaka. Maybe the strikers are just lacking confidence, it's the first MLS season and they have a world class finisher on the team, makes sense to give him the ball.   Also, as a side note, every team in the world has that one player. Manchester United with Rooney, Dortmund has Marco Reus, Real Madrid with Ronaldo ect. ect.."
OCLions,30mt6g,itsKillSwitch,-2,Sat Mar 28 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"Kaka isn't a finisher, he's a play maker.."
OCLions,30mt6g,clear_haze,8,Sun Mar 29 02:19:57 2015 UTC,this isn't the video game-- he can be both.
OCLions,30mt6g,babacristo,3,Sun Mar 29 05:15:03 2015 UTC,Especially noting the fact he's technically our leader for goals now.
OCLions,30mt6g,andrewthemexican,3,Sun Mar 29 11:41:34 2015 UTC,"No it's real life and he's averaged a goal every 3 games in his professional career (that's nearly over). Why would his style of play suddenly change?  Yes, he can score goals but he can't be relied on for that."
OCLions,30mt6g,clear_haze,0,Mon Mar 30 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"What position has he played his whole career? What position has he played on the Brazilian National team when he was on it? His main role in every team he has played in has been to set up strikers to finish. A ""world class finisher"" scores in nearly every game. Kaka has never been a consistent scorer. He's an amazing player, but in order for him to thrive, there needs to be a real forward to complement him up top. He will score, he may win games, but he will be extremely underused without the development of one of our forwards. Kaka simply is not the player that you get the ball to at whatever cost, Kaka is the player that gets the ball to someone at whatever cost."
OCLions,30mt6g,babacristo,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"Kaka is an extremely well rounded player, and while he is renowned for playmaking, he's also been recognized consistently for goal scoring and playing as a forward-- for christ's sake, he was the top scorer in champions league 2007.   yeah, there are much better examples of ""world class finishers"", but to say he's just not a finisher at all seems pretty ignorant of a major part of his career."
OCLions,30mt6g,sgtrama,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:27:29 2015 UTC,I agree with ocsc2011. This thread is ridiculous.
OCLions,30mt6g,niNroM,-5,Mon Mar 30 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"My hope is that Dunga calls up Kaka again. He's done it before recently against Japan, so it's not out of the question that he might do it again. Maybe even for Copa America which is coming up. That'd give our guys an opportunity to get used to life without him.  Granted: I recognize this is somewhat unlikely."
OCLions,30mt6g,sgtrama,5,Sun Mar 29 02:52:34 2015 UTC,Why would you want us to lose our best player?
OCLions,30mt6g,niNroM,-2,Sun Mar 29 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude but, did you not see what this thread is about? It's about the team realizing that they don't need Kaka in order to be good. Right now they nearly depend on him, and it hurts us overall. Every team in the league knows Kaka is going to be our go-to and as a result the coverage and fouls on him have been ridiculous. If he were to be called up for international duty the team would HAVE TO learn to play without. Just like we did today without Brek and Molino; some of our best players. They need to have confidence that everyone can make a player, not just Kaka. He's one of our best, but he can not be the entire team."
OCLions,30mt6g,sgtrama,6,Sun Mar 29 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"I totally understand that we are too Kaka focused, but I rather our players learn with him on the field than without him."
OCLions,30n2pv,coachhawley,12,Sat Mar 28 22:06:28 2015 UTC,If you take out the unlucky bounce to a hand we won that 2-1 with all open play goals. Glad to get a point out of it.  Stupid ref calling full time when we have possession in the box.
OCLions,30n2pv,andrewthemexican,6,Sat Mar 28 22:08:42 2015 UTC,Loved Collin and Kaka giving it to the ref for calling it. Really showed passion and the desire to win that makes the team special I think.
OCLions,30n2pv,great_gator_bait,6,Sun Mar 29 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"I can't believe he called time either, when we had it in the box  -_-"
OCLions,30n2pv,JCRZ114,8,Sat Mar 28 22:10:47 2015 UTC,"For a depleted roster, the team looked good once the 3-5-2 was ditched.  I would really love to know why Heath always leaves 1-2 subs every match unused.  Could have used those seconds killed off the clock late."
OCLions,30n2pv,pvdfan,2,Sat Mar 28 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"With the depleted roater we had this week, who else would you think he should have brought in (serious question?    I think in the first 3 games it was neither time to substitute defensively nor go for an all out attack. If he's still leaving 2 substitutions on the tables when we're down or a couple goals ahead in the 2nd half; then that would be weird."
OCLions,30n2pv,j_andrew_h,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"I think some of it may be situation, but some of it is his style... happened a lot in the USL days."
OCLions,30n2pv,daguru9,7,Mon Mar 30 15:24:45 2015 UTC,Ribiero was the best player on the pitch today for Orlando he is starting to form a dangerous connection with KaKa.
OCLions,30n2pv,shaqueeffa,3,Sat Mar 28 23:03:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. He intercepted the ball, drew the defenders in, and then passed it off to Kaka. Really incredible work considering how tall he is."
OCLions,30n2pv,catch_th3m_all,2,Sun Mar 29 01:15:22 2015 UTC,I agree my friend. But I think this proves he is not by any means a striker. As a striker I though he has been terrible but today he was great. I think he needs more space and not his back to the goal when he gets the ball. Will be interesting where we go from here
OCLions,30n2pv,jmoney0999,3,Sun Mar 29 19:29:38 2015 UTC,Good ending considering how bad our first 25 minutes were with the squad we had today. enjoyed the game and Ribeiro Kaka could prove devastating!:)
OCLions,30n2pv,DELIVERER407,2,Sun Mar 29 01:40:42 2015 UTC,I'm really happy with how turner and boden played. It's funny how in the pre season we were worried about our defensive acumen but now our attack is the problem. Honestly every player defensively has been great. Ledger and Hines have both been a surprise and Colin was poor in the first match but since then he has been amazing.
OCLions,30n2pv,jmoney0999,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:31:29 2015 UTC,"Considering how bad we started, that was a perfectly acceptable result."
OCLions,30mw8g,misanthropicbuddha,2,Sat Mar 28 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea. On the same note, we could also include where we're watching and invite people to join us."
OCLions,30mw8g,Disorted,2,Sun Mar 29 17:40:38 2015 UTC,I like this idea. Maybe we could even come up with an unofficial /r/OCLions bar and get a decent turnout somewhere.
OCLions,30msk7,njunk,4,Sat Mar 28 20:35:41 2015 UTC,I parked right across from amway under the highway. And got right out. Just take the free shuttle.
OCLions,30msk7,jmoney0999,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:49:40 2015 UTC,The website says they only have the shuttle for large events. So does regular season MLS count?
OCLions,30msk7,jmoney0999,3,Sat Mar 28 21:12:31 2015 UTC,They had it for the last match. And my understanding is they plan on having it all season.
OCLions,30msk7,paintballpmd,2,Sat Mar 28 21:20:13 2015 UTC,Will OCSC post a schedule on FB or their website for the shuttle? What does parking downtown cost? I'll be coming from Lakeland so the closer to I4 the better.
OCLions,30msk7,pvdfan,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"Parking downtown depends on where and other events.  For the last match, the parking directly under I-4 was $10 but was nearly sold out in advance.  The shuttle is 10-20 buses going on a loop contentiously pre and post game.  I have been told they run 2 hours after matches and for sure 45 minutes after a match."
OCLions,30msk7,nautika,3,Sat Mar 28 22:11:55 2015 UTC,There are a lot of lots that are not directly under i4 that you can park for $5-10. I parked in the garage across from the fire station for $5 last game. Got there around 6:30 and there were plenty of parking left. Just an extra 3 minute walk to shuttle.
OCLions,30msk7,pvdfan,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:51:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, tons of lots around downtown.  I just mention the ones under I-4 as they are the easiest for myself to get in and out of."
OCLions,30msk7,spikebaylor,3,Sun Mar 29 05:08:07 2015 UTC,Also if you dont want to wait for the shuttle after the game there is typically a very large croud walking down the street back to downtown and its actually not that long of a walk.
OCLions,30msk7,paintballpmd,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:40:47 2015 UTC,Is there a website to prepay for parking downtown? Parking at the stadium is almost 30$ through ticketmaster.

OCLions,30msk7,Orlandomagicfan86,2,Sun Mar 29 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"Shuttles run every home game. This is the first friday game so lots of traffic from people leaving work. Meters downtown are free after 6pm. Shuttle pick-ups are: Central between Terry and Division. Hughey @ the police station, and South and Division (south side of Amway Center)   My advice: Park downtown, there are plenty of garages and meters, then use the shuttle.  If you're so inclined, the walk back from the stadium isn't terribly long, and there are tons of other supporters walking back together.  Adds to the whole experience I think"

OCLions,30i1s4,Ronaldmethot,4,Fri Mar 27 15:52:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for setting this up by the way!!!!!
OCLions,30i1s4,j_andrew_h,5,Fri Mar 27 15:56:00 2015 UTC,SMH at MLS' insistence on scheduling matches during international breaks. How difficult is it to at least schedule bye weeks for clubs that will be hurt the most by these breaks?
OCLions,30i1s4,orlandobob,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:33:07 2015 UTC,I think the only trouble with that is there's no way to tell who's going to be affected. It's all based on form. With scheduling being so problematic without that there's no way to schedule bye weeks that far in advance.  But I can see why they play through them. The league already runs from March-December and other teams can't really play in the earlier months so taking about a month or so away would be an issue. Maybe when we get Atlanta/Miami up and going we could have the first couple of weeks be home for southern teams and start earlier but who knows
OCLions,30i1s4,orlandobob,2,Sat Mar 28 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"This is affecting us regardless of form, though. We could have won all our previous three matches 4-0 and this would still negatively affect us. But yeah, it would be difficult to measure who is hurt the most.   I still think there needs to be a solution, though."
OCLions,30i1s4,j_andrew_h,3,Sat Mar 28 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"I can see Hines playing RB, not because Turner isn't ready but because we may have a play a much more defensive game since we're missing some of our key attacking players."
OCLions,30i1s4,Ronaldmethot,3,Fri Mar 27 15:55:02 2015 UTC,agree on Hines playing RB. definitely a possibility
OCLions,30i1s4,Ronaldmethot,3,Fri Mar 27 16:17:21 2015 UTC,The good news is we couldn't have asked for a better opponent with all these injuries and call ups. Maybe Chicago
OCLions,30i1s4,misanthropicbuddha,2,Fri Mar 27 18:28:18 2015 UTC,I like that back line.  Hopefully Luke Boden can do well.
OCLions,30i1s4,longboardingerrday,2,Fri Mar 27 16:28:30 2015 UTC,If I know anything about both of our teams it's that we won't score a real goal and Montreal will lose anyways
OCLions,30i1s4,ragewu,2,Fri Mar 27 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"Montreal is having a great cup run, but hasn't scored a goal in the league yet this season. Given OCSC's scoring problems, this one may not be for the faint of heart and it's hard to see many goals in the match.   To say that OCSC is under strength would be a massive understatement, as at least half of the starting lineup and key subs are missing due to international game call-ups and injuries. In MLS teams can dress 18 players (11 starters and 7 subs, three of whom can be used). The Lions may only have 16 available players, including a number of youth players and fringe players. I suspect star player Kaka is looking around and wondering a bit about the craziness that is the MLS playing during international breaks.  If you're reading a lack of confidence about today's match in these comments, then you've been paying attention. As an OCSC fan I have hope and faith, but as an armchair analyst this one will probably be an ugly, ugly game.  I'm thinking Montreal is due for a goal or two, and I just don't see enough in the OCSC team to give me confidence they can respond.   Prediction: MTL 2 OCSC 0"
OCLions,30i1s4,Disorted,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"With them missing Porter, Mapp, and Tissot and our defense actually being more defensive with Hines/Turner and Boden, I'd be surprised if we gave up 2.

OCLions,30i1s4,spikebaylor,0,Sat Mar 28 16:10:51 2015 UTC,I'm worried about defense.
OCLions,30i3oa,Ronaldmethot,2,Fri Mar 27 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"For me it's a greater question about who is going to play LM.  If Rivas is going to be needed up top as the striker or if he's hurt; we don't have any other attacking minded players at LM.  If that is going to be the case, I'd love to see Boden come in at LB and move Shea forward to the LM position."
OCLions,30i3oa,j_andrew_h,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:11:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. Why put a limited player at lm just so she's can bomb up from lb when you can just put Shea up there so he has nothing to worry about with the defending aspect.
OCLions,30i3oa,jmoney0999,2,Fri Mar 27 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"I'm also seeing very few runs into the box overall. The two outside mids need to get in there when the Fullbacks come up since now the Backs are providing the width. Neal especially, seems to drift back to cover for Shea but unless Brek is going all the way in we're not gaining a numbers advantage in the attacking 3rd.    I really want to see Martin Paterson run up top as soon as he is fit as I think he'll be solid (not as much upside as Rochez, but solid). Then get Rivas at LM and Shea at LB and see if it starts to come together. If not, can always go with Shea & Boden the way we mentioned."
OCLions,30i3oa,j_andrew_h,2,Fri Mar 27 18:24:24 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Plus Patterson runs his ass off so his pressure alone should help cause problems for opposing defenders in playing out of the back. We just have so many possible tweaks. I think the right side is okay because Molina drifts in then Ramos usually fills in the width decently.
OCLions,30i3oa,jmoney0999,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"If we can win and Boden is instrumental in the wining, I think it could change the dynamic some...  This is his moment to shine and prove that should be the starting LB..."

Ok, sure, but with Luke Boden getting a chance to prove himself and put some crosses in again you never know what could happen.

I just don't see any real contact...  Collins faked the ref out and apparently even the disciplinary committee...  Reminds me of O'Conner a few years ago... He got into a verbal with an opponent, the opponent's head came towards O'Conner.  There was no contact, but O'Conner grabs his head and drops instantly...  No contact, but since the ref was to the defender's back, he assumed there was contact and I believe the guy got a red card.  O'Conner stood up with his back to the ref and laughed.... it was great :)"
OCLions,30eylf,jp4est,3,Fri Mar 27 12:31:26 2015 UTC,"Collins felt the contact, grabbed himself, and dropped   You could be completely right, but the contact he felt and reacted too was someone touching his junk.

And if the injuries continue I wouldn't mind him starting at lb and brek pushing up to left wing considering Neal and Avila don't really provide much of an attacking outlet. Until Rivas starts over there at least.
OCLions,30d7my,jmoney0999,3,Thu Mar 26 14:38:55 2015 UTC,I agree... If Rivas is in LM and playing well; then by all means play Shea at LB.  But with Neal and Avila we had no attack on the left so if Rivas is hurt or has to play up top due to other injuries; then I'd love to see Boden at LB and Shea up at LM in the attack.

Especially after these last two games, it would be awesome to include information on what to expect at the Citrus Bowl, where visiting fans sit (good also for OCSC fans buying tix), who to tailgate with and who to call should things get out of hand, maybe link to the /r/Orlando visitor's guide so we don't get swamped with general tourist questions. We all know Parramore is ghetto and OBT is where you pick up hookers, but visitors likely won't. That sort of thing. I'm... going alone/with my kids/with my boyfriend... where should I sit? A guide to the different sections. This could also be included in a ""Soccer for Dummies"" section, maybe?  Merch guide. A list of places to buy OCSC gear, and if it ships international.   edit- I went snoopng around the other MLS team subreddits, and /r/LAGalaxy has some pretty solid idea we can emulate with the ""Starter Kit"" and ""Match Day Guide"". The /r/rbny subreddit has the ""NEWOMERS GUIDE AND FAQ"" in big bold text and I like that.

OCLions,3057bf,misanthropicbuddha,3,Tue Mar 24 16:07:15 2015 UTC,Looks about right.. Though i think larin did better than most rankings have given him credit for.  he didnt have a ton of time to get into it.  I think collin looked really good and composed and deserved MOTM.  Kaka will look better once the rest of the team stops just dumping the ball on him at terrible times.  Sometimes he manages to pull some crazy shit and get out of it but he'll be even more amazing when the ball is at his feet with some space and other guys making short runs into space.
OCLions,3057bf,spikebaylor,2,Tue Mar 24 17:29:17 2015 UTC,The team keeps looking for kaka too much and missing opportunities.
OCLions,3057bf,niNroM,2,Tue Mar 24 19:05:46 2015 UTC,Agreed.. they need their confidence back.. Molino in particular had a few chances he should have taken but instead dumped it off on kaka who was covered and had a worse angle.
OCLions,3057bf,spikebaylor,2,Tue Mar 24 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with that.  Seemed to me that when they get the ball past midfield they either could not finish cleanly, or they would try to dump the ball off to Kaka as opposed to going for the shot at times."
OCLions,3057bf,mcg1848,3,Tue Mar 24 20:19:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Larin.  Considering it was his debut, I thought he did well.  A bit harsh for Avila.  I thought he got better as the match went on.  Not fantastic, but still.  Looking forward to cleaner crosses from Ramos and Shea coming forward!  They'll get there."
OCLions,304uzs,normalbeard,2,Tue Mar 24 14:32:59 2015 UTC,I was wondering the same thing. I liked their old app but it has not been updated and shows an error when trying to open now. MLS might have strict rules that prevent them from updating it.
OCLions,304uzs,Bxdx003,2,Tue Mar 24 15:06:52 2015 UTC,pretty sure other teams have apps.  My guess is they are starting from scratch.  Would be nice to get some information about it though.
OCLions,304uzs,spikebaylor,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"What did the app do, exactly? It MIGHT BE pretty easy to make an unofficial one depending on what resources are required."
OCLions,304uzs,sgtrama,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:47:40 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they will come out with something.  Until they have there own app I currently use onefootball and bleacher report team stream.
OCLions,304uzs,OCSC407,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:05:04 2015 UTC,the MLS app is pretty decent for quick news and stats.  The official app will probably just be a themed version of that app.
OCLions,304mak,beefat99,3,Tue Mar 24 13:12:58 2015 UTC,Shea - USMNT  Donovan - US U20  Ramos - Portugal U20  Estrela - Portugal U20  Ceren - El Salvador  Molino - Trinidad & Tobago  Larin - Canada
OCLions,304mak,Generalparks,3,Tue Mar 24 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"Shea/LB = Not worried about this, time for Luke Boden to introduce himself to the MLS  Donovan/CB = Not worried, only a depth issue, has not featured yet anyways  Ramos/RB = Worried, apparently Seb Hines has been practicing at RB and we still have Turner (who did not get called up)  Estrela/DCM = Not worried, only a depth issue, has not featured yet anyways  Ceren/DCM = Worried, especially if Higuita is not fit yet; would be looking at possibly Neal or Heath to fill in  Molino/RM = Worried, not sure who would fill in, prob Avila or Riberio  Larin/FW = Worried, but depends on whether Rochez or Rivas are fit or not.  If they are not fit, then very worried; if they are fit, not worried.  The biggest worry is with Molino out, teams could zero in and double Kaka, like they have been doing to Molino."
OCLions,304mak,daguru9,7,Tue Mar 24 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"If we're lucky, some of Shea's shots from the USMNT game might be so wide they end up in Montreal."
OCLions,304mak,Aestheticus,3,Tue Mar 24 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"My bet is on Cassio for Molino.  The tiny bit that I saw him in pre season he looked fairly decent.  I'm with you, if Rivas, Higuita, Rochez are all ""match fit"" it will actually still be a good squad.  Montreal is also down 3 players due to Intl, 2 to injury and 1 to red card I believe, so that helps a tad.  Plus... as long as we get MLS Montreal and not CCL Montreal it could still turn out well for us."
OCLions,304mak,spikebaylor,2,Tue Mar 24 15:46:36 2015 UTC,Agree with all those points.  If Higuita and Rivas are ready to go I will feel a lot better.
OCLions,304mak,Generalparks,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:41:21 2015 UTC,"Hines is an adequate fullback but he's not going to be nearly as effective in the opponent's half. I'd imagine the decision between him and Turner will be tactical. Avila in front of them will mean we can afford a more attacking player. I'd like to see:  Ricketts; Boden, St. Ledger, Collin, Hines; Neal, Okugo; Cascio, Kaká, Avila; Ribeiro  I think we'll end up bunkering down and playing for the counter (which would be far more effective with Rivas healthy)"
OCLions,304mak,logjam13,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:28:15 2015 UTC,I could see most of the attacking coming from the left side.... IMHO Boden is a strong crosser then Shea.
OCLions,304mak,daguru9,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on who's in front of him. With Rivas, Neal, and Cascio all dealing with injuries I'm really not sure who they'll put out there"

OCLions,304mak,Generalparks,2,Tue Mar 24 14:23:00 2015 UTC,Hopefully the guys see this as an opportunity to prove themselves and play out of their minds.
OCLions,304mak,logjam13,3,Tue Mar 24 14:28:12 2015 UTC,I just hope Higuita and Rivas are healthy again. Luckily Montreal's going to be pretty depleted too with injuries and call ups
OCLions,304mak,Generalparks,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:35:23 2015 UTC,If they are both fit enough to play I'll feel a little bit better.  Montreal being depleted too definitely will help us.

OCLions,304mak,daguru9,3,Thu Mar 26 12:05:05 2015 UTC,"According to Tenorio & Gramajo, this is also our injury crisis:  Cascio (Back) - Questionable  Higuita (Groin) - Out  Hines - Questionable  Neal (Neck) - Out  Paterson (Hamstring) - Out  Rivas (Hamstring) - Questionable  Assuming they're all out (which is definitely a possibility) we've only got 16 available players including 3 keepers"
OCLions,304mak,logjam13,2,Tue Mar 24 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"If none of these play, then I would say that the Harrison Heath is definitely starting... no one else to play in the middle."
OCLions,304mak,Generalparks,2,Tue Mar 24 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see how we can play a 4-2-3-1 with that personnel.  Maybe 5 at the back with Boden-St Ledger-Collin-Hines-Turner?  Then Okugo-Kaka ahead of them, Ribeiro-Avila even ahead of them, and Rochez up top.  Kind of a 5-2-2-1. Bunker down and break on the counter"
OCLions,304mak,daguru9,2,Tue Mar 24 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"Depending on injuries, I wouldnt be opposed to a bunker and counter mentality this week.  Higuita, Rivas, and Neal being able to go would be a big help."
OCLions,304mak,daguru9,2,Tue Mar 24 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"I found it interesting the Donovan got the call up and not Redding or Turner...  But after looking at the list of call ups and injuries, glad they didn't..."
OCLions,304mak,daguru9,1 point,Wed Mar 25 11:59:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought...  In the end, it is going to come down to whether Rivas, Rochez, and Higuita are healthy or not...  If Higuita is healthy, I think he stays in the 4-2-3-1."

Did a phenomenal job with the ""CITY"" half of the chant.  Obviously though if chanting, singing, yelling and having a good time is what you're after, supporters section all the way.  We sat over there for a few games last year and while I loved the energy, I just didn't like some of the obnoxiousness that will inevitably come with a group of fans who are that passionate and that plastered :P  The north end is sort of that ""just right"" feeling for me.

OCLions,30146y,ragewu,3,Mon Mar 23 18:25:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. The over/under on a 98/95 summer game day will provide some better indications.
OCLions,30146y,DiFaz07,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:38:43 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people keep saying 90 degree weather if most games will be playing 7pm not during the middle of the afternoon. It will still be a bit warm but not scorching by kick off and then in will be night by the end of the half. No reason for concern for weather except for rain of course.

To add 5,000 more seats to the new stadium will cost $30 Million (no idea how they got this number).  To get that cost funded largely by the tourism tax, OC has to show a need based on the first 6 games.

This is what happens when away fans are mixed in with home fans. Not sure if this falls on the FO or the Citrus Bowl to sort out, but away fans should have their own section."
OCLions,2zww3t,taylor314gh,6,Sun Mar 22 17:14:25 2015 UTC,The SGs have been tremendous this season. I really wish more supporters could learn how to properly support the club like the Ruckus and ILF do.

OCLions,2zww3t,taylor314gh,6,Sun Mar 22 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"You realize that out of 31,000 fans only 4-5 were involved? Fans getting drunk and fighting is part of every sport. In 2013 158 fans were ejected from a UF vs FSU football game, but no one made a big deal. Drunk people are going to act stupid, and security should be on hand to take care of it. As I said, either the FO or the Citrus Bowl needs to sort it out, but it's not a news worthy story."
OCLions,2zww3t,Commandant1,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you are saying.  However, its a newsworthy story when the FO or Citrus Bowl allows this to happen.  Thats the news worthy issue."
OCLions,2zww3t,OCSC407,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"Would we allow racism at our stadium? I agree it seems a bit blown out of proportion but these are the kinda things we should know about so they can be resolved.  Taunting and trash talk during the game is fine, physical altercations at anytime is not acceptable.  There is a reason the teams come out on the field together, to show sportsmanship. As fans we should try to mirror that in our behavior in the stands.  You can't really compare a soccer match to a college football game where there are 10,000's of students (drunk frat boys) and their stadiums hold 90,000+ for those games."
OCLions,2zww3t,taylor314gh,2,Tue Mar 24 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"Of course not, that's a silly thing to even being up. The club shouldn't tolerate any of it, I agree, but ""we"" can't do anything about it aside from policing ourselves. The club will handle discipline. What we shouldn't be doing is making a huge story out of a few people fighting like it's a problem unique to soccer.   While I agree that there are more drunk students and people in general at college football games, we did have 31,000 people at the last home game. Triple the numbers to match UF's capacity and it's still 12-15 people vs 158. Any event is going to have drunk people acting drunk, but making a huge deal out of it feeds the narrative that a lot of media already want to show- soccer is a ""hooligan"" sport that isn't American. We need to kill that narrative but still let the club know what is happening so they can handle it internally."
OCLions,2zww3t,misanthropicbuddha,10,Tue Mar 24 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"This is obviously unacceptable and a very small minority, but ownership really needs to address this asap. As a city that is known for our tourism, we need to treat away supporters like gold. Especially our friends who travel across the entire continent to visit our city."
OCLions,2zww3t,secretlyadog,8,Sun Mar 22 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Two questions to ask the FO, Citrus Bowl, or whoever makes the seating arrangements: Why do they sit away and home supporters in the same section?  Why isn't there more security in that area?"
OCLions,2zww3t,daguru9,11,Sun Mar 22 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"It's worse than you think.  They put the away fans in the last row of the lower bowl, right in front of the walkway / standing room area. It is also right next to the bar.   If they don't move them this is going to be a regular thing. Beers poured on people. Shit thrown at them.   Any idiot who wants to start a fight has easy easy access to them.  The only reason this didn't already happen with NYCFC is because there were 30 - 40 of them and the morons who do this shit were rightfully afraid of starting with them.   Add to that the Citrus Bowl security and OPD are completely fucking useless."
OCLions,2zww3t,secretlyadog,2,Sun Mar 22 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, this is the big issue... that the away supporters are sitting with their backs to the open, public promenade...

If they are going to keep putting the away supporters in this spot, they need security or staff along that back of the section.  Prob 2-4 security staff along the rail..."

We could start a volunteer group of Ambassador supporters. I don't know if it is feasible, but just an idea."
OCLions,2zww3t,Disorted,4,Sun Mar 22 17:52:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, nothing will stop this until the Citrus Bowl employees and OPD start giving a fuck.  I stated this in the /r/mls thread agout this but they were wanding only random male fans with non OCSC kits for weapons meanwhile others were able to bring in anything including a cooler of beer(Gate C for anyone that is curious). I was also threatened by security to have the cops arrest me for following a staff member for my post game season ticket reward tonight.  Security and police were non existent on the sidelines and when they were around in other parts of the 200 level concourse, they gave zero fucks about anything other than the event ending.  This really is a City of Orlando government issue as I've been to around 100 other stadiums/sports venues and never see stadium workers this bad.  Then again, the stadium had broken seats that were not fixed and concrete chucks all over the ground in my section."
OCLions,2zww3t,pvdfan,3,Sun Mar 22 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"Just did a little snooping and it seems the security contract for the Citrus Bowl is held by Andy Frain Services. I wonder how much say OCSC has in this situation :/  On an interesting note, I tried to find the contract for the Portland Timbers stadium, and the Providence Park website seems to have been hacked."
OCLions,2zww3t,deshki,3,Mon Mar 23 05:06:11 2015 UTC,Nice catch on the security contract.  It really seems like the City of Orlando is the blame for the crap going on in the stadium.

OCLions,2zww3t,fata13xception,3,Mon Mar 23 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the FO, Citrus Bowl, and OPD really need to get their shit together.   There defiantly needs to be more field wardens (not crappy untrained ushers) all over the stadium with particular attention to the away supporter and home supporter sections with OPD backing them up.  My mention of presence near the home supporter section is not directed at the Ruckus or ILF but towards those few who I have seen chucking beers onto the field.   My reason for this is there are innocent people down there who had nothing to do with what they are mad at and everyone's aim sucks when they are drunk. What if one hit a ballkid?  Looks at most MLS and all EPL matches and look at the warden and police presence around both supporter sections.  This shit gives the team, supporters, and the city a bad name."
OCLions,2zww3t,pvdfan,2,Sun Mar 22 20:21:28 2015 UTC,Shameful; this needs to be addressed from all sides. City needs to step up and the asshats need to be dealt with. It's an exciting time here in Orlando but the Citrus Bowl has been amateur to say the least; at times has felt like it's been run by the locals selling driveway parking space for $15 (though I'm sure these folks would do a better job).

That being said it's clear the FO, Citrus Bowl and OPD need to step up to make sure this doesn't become a trend. Away supporters need their own section and any rowdy or overly drunk fans that are causing trouble need to be  removed and not allowed back. While it doesn't sound like these guys belonged to any SG I have heard unflattering stories mostly regarding ILF. It's also important that those groups police their own ranks."

OCLions,2zxbzk,Ronaldmethot,2,Sun Mar 22 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"Even with Okugo not contributing to the attack, I thought his positioning and defense warranted at least a 6 if not a 6.5. Why so low for him?"
OCLions,2zxbzk,great_gator_bait,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:51:24 2015 UTC,"Both him and Ceren Defensive Midfielders...  if your offense is going to be based on whether they are pushing high enough, then there is something wrong with your offense?    They are supposed to be hanging back and supporting the CBs...    Actually, during most of that game, instead of playing side by side, they were playing stacked with Ceren moving forward when able and Okugo hanging back...  So Ceren was moving forward some, not into a full attacking role, but was moving forward.  This allowed Molino, Kaka, Avila, and Ribiero to rotate through F/LM/RM/CAM...  Was working well, just need to find that final third and start taking more shots (same thing may of us have been saying about this style of play for a few seasons now... big issue last year)."
OCLions,2zxbzk,daguru9,2,Mon Mar 23 15:00:05 2015 UTC,I do not agree with what the article is saying about Cerén. The article states that he does not provide anything going forward. This is definitely not the case. Darwin was all over the midfield and was playing very well defensively. He linked up with Kaká really well throughout the game. I honestly think the grading in the article is too harsh. It's too bad that Darwin will only be remembered by the final foul in this game because he had a very good game overall
OCLions,2zxbzk,sault9,2,Mon Mar 23 03:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah i keep hearing that ceren and okugo do nothing on the attack and that is mostly true in the final third, but they've both done very well linking up with the attacking mids and forwards in thr middle third of the field.  With backs that push up into the attack do we really want our defensive mids to also be up in the box? I think collin and hines (and st ledger) have done better than expected but i wouldnt want to  put that kind of couter attack pressure on them all the time."

We've done a great job with possession and movement in all three games only to find ourselves hitting a brick wall when in scoring range; aside from select few (i.e., Kaka), it seems our creativity goes missing anytime we need to dissect the defense. Aside from breakaways, we just simply stall out and settle for pedestrian shots (or we lose possession).  The team has been doing a pretty damn fine job moving up field... so it's maddening to watch us squander opportunities like this, time after time.  Can't wait for next week!!!!!!!"

OCLions,2zw64y,Edge2Soon,7,Sun Mar 22 11:12:40 2015 UTC,"No problem, welcome to the MLS."
OCLions,2zw64y,misanthropicbuddha,6,Sun Mar 22 11:40:35 2015 UTC,I appreciate you're taking the effort to learn about the happenings of MLS and soccer.
OCLions,2zw64y,beglogan,3,Sun Mar 22 14:10:04 2015 UTC,I've decided to be a Lions fan so I wanna learn as much about the sport as possible.
OCLions,2zw64y,vonIsar,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:50:48 2015 UTC,Does the MLS work their system differently to this normally? I thought that's how all football leagues worked ( I'm from England )
OCLions,2zw64y,OCSC407,2,Sun Mar 22 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's a bit strange. The Supporters Shield would determine the Champions in most leagues around the world but here its just a consolation prize (kind of). It gives the winner a slot in the CONCACAF Champions League, which is important to MLS teams, but doesn't declare you in winner of the league. That is determined by a knockout style playoff that is run. The Shield is unique because it was started by the fans who wanted to award the most constant team."
OCLions,2zw64y,pmcd95,2,Sun Mar 22 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"As vonIsar pointed out it's pretty unique to the US.  It was the same thing when we played in USL Pro with the Regular Season Trophy (most points at the end of the regular season) and the Championship Trophy (winner of the playoffs). Broadcasters, teams, and for the most part US fans like it this way. More matches for the fans, and more money for the broadcasters and teams."
OCLions,2zv7bl,Dance_Monkee_Dance,12,Sun Mar 22 02:12:14 2015 UTC,You mean the occasions when he played advantage when there was no actual advantage to play?
OCLions,2zv7bl,OCSC2011,7,Sun Mar 22 03:12:00 2015 UTC,THANK YOU. Ref had no fucking clue.   NO  FUCKING   CLUE
OCLions,2zv7bl,secretlyadog,18,Sun Mar 22 06:11:31 2015 UTC,"No we didn't, their was a foul at the same time he was getting strecherd out. If you actually watched the fans were giving him a standing ovation as he was heading into the tunnel.    And all the other stuff happens in every single home game in the MLS."
OCLions,2zv7bl,Edge2Soon,-10,Sun Mar 22 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"Not when he first went down, he fell we booed, he got up and limped off the field and we booed again because people thought he was making a show, we did cheer when he was taken off but while the play was stopped we were booing"
OCLions,2zv7bl,Edge2Soon,19,Sun Mar 22 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"You said ""We booed an injured player who clearly was taken off in a strecher."" Booing a player when he goes down is normal because alot of players fake injuries. When they saw it was serious they honored him and gave him an ovation."
OCLions,2zv7bl,orangekid13,3,Sun Mar 22 02:38:36 2015 UTC,Yeah if OP can predict how injured someone is that well I want him to pick lotto numbers for me
OCLions,2zv7bl,Edge2Soon,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:22:15 2015 UTC,"It must have been where I was sitting in supporters section then because a chant went up singing ""na na na na hey hey hey goodbye"" while he was being taken off in the stretcher."
OCLions,2zv7bl,beerwithanolive,2,Sun Mar 22 12:29:35 2015 UTC,"Well the people chanting that are the same people that assault our opponents supporters, just some drunk idiots."
OCLions,2zv7bl,j_andrew_h,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:33:39 2015 UTC,When it happens over and over it is not just some drunk idiots it is a problem that needs to be addressed.   I was not there.  I just know what i read and when i keep seeing the same type of reports I start to wonder if I really want to go to a game there.  I have seen UCF games and soccer in JAXS that I suspect is drawing from the same gene pool OC is.  I was not impressed.
OCLions,2zv7bl,secretlyadog,2,Sun Mar 22 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"People did boo when he stood up and then fell right back in the same spot when the endline was literally 1 foot away. In hindsight it may not have been intentionally a delay, but it certainly appeared that way at the time.  Also keep in mind they didn't show a replay of the collision in the stadium so we didn't have the benefit of seeing exactly what happened to him."
OCLions,2zv7bl,KubaBVB09,4,Sun Mar 22 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"While the play was stopped he was just another attacker trying to dive to get a call....  When he was stretchered off he was a hurt human being who deserved a modicum of respect or even sympathy.  See the difference?  And... in our defense... unless you were right behind that goal it didn't look like that rough of a collision, no foul called, just two players going for the ball."
OCLions,2zv7bl,Hollyw0od,9,Sun Mar 22 06:05:21 2015 UTC,I was at the game. It's clear most people don't even know the rules. The row behind me didn't understand advantage play and the row in front just booed everything the other team did
OCLions,2zv7bl,Wheaties466,3,Sun Mar 22 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"And? Shit man.... Soccer fans seem to complain when people make fun of how no one in the US likes the sport, but when people start to get into it they deal with these type of elitist attitudes. Who cares if they don't know the rules, they might be new fans. And soccer sorely needs new fans."
OCLions,2zv7bl,secretlyadog,2,Sun Mar 22 14:00:19 2015 UTC,I also witnessed many people that didnt know the advantage rule. But im unsure how you give the other team the advantage call then a few seconds later call it back and give our player a yellow card.  I dont think i've ever seen a delayed yellow card before.
OCLions,2zv7bl,secretlyadog,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:17:39 2015 UTC,Delayed yellows happen. They just didn't happen against Vancouver last night and it clearly should have.
OCLions,2zv7bl,mikesicle,3,Sun Mar 22 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you, at least from where I was seated, and also after the game saw a bit on TV.  I think advantage rule was mis-interpreted a lot today. Vancouver was knocking down our players off the ball all night, turning 2 v 3s into 1 v 3s.   According to the principle of advantage, play should be allowed to continue when the team against which an offence has been committed will benefit from ongoing play.  How did we benefit having Molino in possession on the sideline with no one to pass to because the other player on the break got knocked to the ground 20 feet back? We string together these nice little triangulares and then one side of the triangle gets chopped down off the ball.  They should have had 2 or 3 more persistent infringement cards IMO."
OCLions,2zv7bl,daguru9,6,Sun Mar 22 06:10:23 2015 UTC,"Once it was clear he was actually hurt, the booing stopped, and he got a standing ovation from all of the fans on his way out. Relax."
OCLions,2zuy61,TheFItyP,6,Sun Mar 22 00:40:53 2015 UTC,The play by play guy is horrible. Thank god the color commentary guy actually tells it like it is. Amateur hour
OCLions,2zuy61,arleavit,5,Sun Mar 22 00:42:56 2015 UTC,We've been laughing at the reporters and such the whole match. Especially the reporter talking about Kaka's social media presence...just embarrassingly amateur
OCLions,2zuy61,Young_Neil_Postman,3,Sun Mar 22 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"I heard them say Neal was on the pitch a couple of times. Even I, as a new fan, could do better than them."
OCLions,2zuy61,Swish28,5,Sun Mar 22 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"As a Brighthouse networks customer, who was unable to hear the game besides Espanol and used RealRadio broadcast lat week, this is great.  I really wish the camera was WAY closer...and got a better view of everything, but Jesus Christ man...no one is the CEO on their first day?"
OCLions,2zuy61,5heepdawg,2,Sun Mar 22 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"Give it some time. It's the third league game. Everything was sloppy but it will progress, just like our team will.....God willing."

OCLions,2zuy61,j_andrew_h,2,Sun Mar 22 14:39:39 2015 UTC,thought it was a pretty good broadcast. I enjoyed the commentators
OCLions,2zuy61,FleeUnit,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:19:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't have high expectations, it was only announced a few days ago. They'll get it worked out."
OCLions,2zuy61,TB_Dark,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:36:36 2015 UTC,I was told the game was on my65 as well. Was it just the same broadcast?
OCLions,2zuy61,nautika,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:07:37 2015 UTC,I think everything gets better with the new stadium. I bet even broadcasting will be better. Commentating...you get what you get with the area. We might get better people in the future.
OCLions,2zv0v5,5heepdawg,6,Sun Mar 22 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"I think that chant should be a staple, it's simple and easy that all fans can remember."
OCLions,2zv0v5,Edge2Soon,3,Sun Mar 22 02:12:02 2015 UTC,It sounded a lot better this game than the opener. Sounds like more fans are getting into it.
OCLions,2zv0v5,TB_Dark,2,Sun Mar 22 02:37:12 2015 UTC,It is.. has been for a long time.  It sounds amazing in the stadium... lookin forward to rewatching.  It was so hard to hear anything during the first game that it didnt work as well.  I sit on the north side (city) and was never sure if the supporters had started the chant or not on that first game.
OCLions,2zv0v5,spikebaylor,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly this.  We were in towards the north end as well for the first game and couldn't hear much of what the supporters were chanting except for some drums.  This game with half the people, it caught on pretty quick through the whole stadium.  If you find a replay, please link it as I would like to see how it came across on TV as well."
OCLions,2zv0v5,nautika,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"don't have a replay for you, but I just rewatched on MLS Live, and oh man it sounded awesome!  Could just be the mic placement, but the North End sounded amazing.  Just as loud if not louder than the supporters section.    The SS didn't seem to be miced up very well throughout most of the broadcast.  You could hear them of course, but it didn't do justice to how loud they really were.    Kudos to all of the fans, the atmosphere was just as fantastic as the opener despite only being half as many attendees.  I really hope we continue this trend of support.  I'd love to see our new stadium have to be expanded immediately.  a good ~27k to rival LA would make me happy."
OCLions,2zv0v5,spikebaylor,2,Sun Mar 22 19:53:45 2015 UTC,Its been a staple in previous years already.  It's obviously easy for the whole stadium to participate.
OCLions,2zv0v5,j_andrew_h,2,Sun Mar 22 15:00:43 2015 UTC,Welcome!
OCLions,2zvdb4,misanthropicbuddha,4,Sun Mar 22 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"This needs to be a weekly thing as do pre and during match threads. The communication and discussions are what make these communities fun. Hopefully these can become a thing. I would love to do them, but I don't think I'd be able to do each match thread."
OCLions,2zvdb4,coachhawley,5,Sun Mar 22 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah we should probably get a schedule set up. Pre-Match [x] amount of hours before, actual Match Threads, and Post-Match with gifs, etc. We're still a developing community but I think it'll go a long way toward stability"
OCLions,2zvdb4,logjam13,2,Sun Mar 22 06:33:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I highly doubt comments will get resubmitted from other posts, but at least if it's around, then this will hopefully make people aware.  In addition, somebody just needs to volunteer to make these.  I mean, I can make the match and post-match threads, but whoever made that pre-match thread was fantastic."
OCLions,2zvdb4,logjam13,2,Sun Mar 22 12:30:25 2015 UTC,"Haha that was me, thanks I appreciate it. I don't think many people saw it though - or if they did no one discussed"
OCLions,2zvdb4,coachhawley,2,Sun Mar 22 14:02:44 2015 UTC,"That's right.  I could have looked for your post, but I was too lazy to search for it.  Again, thanks.  The information dump was very top."
OCLions,2zvdb4,wonder_chicken,2,Sun Mar 22 14:07:55 2015 UTC,Yes I agree. I would say Pre Match starts at noon day before the game. Game day thread starts a few mins before kickoff and post match thread starts right after and all discussion goes there. I'll see what I can do for this weeks game.
OCLions,2zvdb4,mikesicle,3,Sun Mar 22 13:02:20 2015 UTC,"Hey! A post match thread is a great idea. I was actually thinking about it last night during the drive home. Those of us who go out after the game or have a long drive home may not get on reddit immediately at the conclusion of the game (trust me, I'd reddit and drive if I could but I'm not that addicted yet, haha) and having a single thread to discuss stuff afterwards is a great idea.   All that being said I am going to rant now. I was fucking furious when I left the citrus bowl last night. It was an emotional game that we should have won. Towards the end I figured we'd escape with a point and stay tied with NYCFC in the east, but no, that was as big a heart breaker as I've ever seen.   When I got home and settled down a bit I saw this thread on r/mls:  http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/2zuyyr/vancouver_southsiders_on_twitter_we_have_heard/  Now, like I said I was angry after the game, but seeing that thread sent me through the roof. I decided not to comment and just go to bed, everything would be fine in the morning. Now, I'm up and I'm still beyond pissed off. I'm no longer upset we lost, there will be hundreds more OCSC games I go to and many victories. I'm upset because our supporters continue to make us look like shit. I wasn't there, I didn't see the incident, I don't know if it was the ILF or the Ruckus or just some idiots. But this is unacceptable and yet it continues to happen. I'm fucking angry because I love the people in Orlando and I love this team, but a few shithead morons are ruining it for me. Everyone that sees this, please help me stop this behavior. If someone wearing purple assaults an away fan try to stop them, get a security guard, do SOMETHING! I'm so fed up. It happened in Tampa, it happened in the preseason tournament, it happened during the NYCFC game, it happened last night. FUCKING STOP ALREADY.   I will leave with this last thought. Here's where I go from here. Step 1) if I see an OCSC supporter trying to fight an away fan I am going to beat the ever lasting shit out of that ""supporter"" so the warning is out there. If you're one of the drunk idiots who likes to start shit with away fans, /u/wonder_chicken is going to beat your ass.  Step 2) If this shit continues to happen, I will give up me season tickets, burn all my OCSC gear, and support the Armada. I want to support my local team, but not if a thug life culture is going to follow it.  TL;DR If you want to beat up away fans, you'll have to fight me first"
OCLions,2zv5vj,Young_Neil_Postman,4,Sun Mar 22 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"For the amount of shit we've had to deal with this early in the season I'm honestly surprised we managed to dominate as much as we did. Avila is our 3rd choice on the left wing (and it's not even his natural side of the field) and Ribeiro is who-knows-how-far down the striker depth chart when everyone is healthy (he's at least 2nd and when Paterson and Róchez are 100% match fit he's probably 4th). Cerén is a great replacement but there's a reason Higuita's beaten him for the job. Hell, Ricketts isn't even projected to start all season.  It's also worth noting that Vancouver was a playoff team last season and we absolutely dominated possession (62-37) and had better passing accuracy and more chances. Once we convert we'll be rolling. We're making the playoffs this year"
OCLions,2zv5vj,logjam13,3,Sun Mar 22 04:24:47 2015 UTC,I like the analysis. Thanks for taking the time and I would love more in the future!
OCLions,2zv5vj,imapadawan,3,Sun Mar 22 03:10:30 2015 UTC,"Great write up. It's always good to see someone take the time to do something like this.   I have to agree our defense looked pretty good tonight and Shea and Ramos were great carrying the ball forward, but their crosses were awful. Not one hit their target and most were turnovers that led to a counter. If they can improve on that we will be tough to beat.   Also we need to get more chaces on target. I think their keeper had one save all night and we must have had at least 10 shots."
OCLions,2zv5vj,TheKingthlayer,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:13:14 2015 UTC,Heath was 100% on about the players trying to make cheeky plays instead of just attacking for the third straight match.  Players need to realize that just because Kaka does it doesn't mean they can.
OCLions,2zv5vj,pvdfan,2,Sun Mar 22 04:20:16 2015 UTC,Brek was guilty of this.
OCLions,2zv41c,misanthropicbuddha,10,Sun Mar 22 01:39:51 2015 UTC,I'm super pissed. Avila was shit. Latin missed a sitter. The refs were shit and had zero control of the game. Should have been a red for the 2 footed tackle.
OCLions,2zv41c,great_gator_bait,2,Sun Mar 22 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"He forgot to mention the bevy of off target shots, and the propensity to try and pass the ball right up to the goal-mouth."
OCLions,2zv41c,secretlyadog,6,Sun Mar 22 02:56:19 2015 UTC,"As far as the stoppage time goes, a Vancouver player got a yellow for delay of game and their was a further injury...so that's stoppage time that should continue to be added, which is what the refs usually do.   As far as the game, yeah that was super disappointing. But lots of of good to take from the match as well"
OCLions,2zv41c,Young_Neil_Postman,5,Sun Mar 22 06:13:39 2015 UTC,It's really upsetting because OCSC had them under barrage just before the goal. Just such a disappointing/underserved result.
OCLions,2zv41c,JKE412,6,Sun Mar 22 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the ridiculous sportsmanship on the part of Vancouver holding up the ball to waste up time (bouncing the ball on the guy's head before the throw-in to give one example) and just acting like five year olds. After just watching this game for Vancouver, Rivero seems like one of the most annoying players I have seen with the way he acts and then him scoring just threw me over the edge with frustration."
OCLions,2zv41c,imapadawan,4,Sun Mar 22 01:58:16 2015 UTC,This is the third game in which will be many to come. We may have lost tonight but when Orlando starts firing on all cylinders we will start scoring in droves. It's just a matter of time.
OCLions,2zv41c,macaco_gordinho,2,Sun Mar 22 01:45:31 2015 UTC,Post for ratings to be up later tonight.
OCLions,2zv41c,Dance_Monkee_Dance,5,Sun Mar 22 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"How? We controlled the game but didn't finish because we don't have any talent at striker. We played great and the fans don't ""deserve"" anything, the team played their hearts out and got beat at the last minute. We are an expansion team, do people expect us to come in and run the league like we did in the USL?"

OCLions,2zv41c,Wheaties466,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:57:10 2015 UTC,defender #5(Amobi Okugo) and midfielder #12(Eric Avilia) need to step their game up. By far the two worst players on the pitch last night. Not sure if it was nerves but they consistently had poor passes and were out of position on many occasions.  on a positive note. Very please with Hines and collin controlling our back line. The play from the right and left back are the best we could have asked for(ramos and shea).  I was also pleased with Darwin Cerén #17 as I thought he had an overall very solid game making a few mistakes but providing solid aggressive defense that converted into some good chances o offense.  on another negative note. Its very displeasing to see how quickly we bunch up as a team when we have the ball.   We need to find better ways to get our striker the ball in even just the slightest amount of space.

OCLions,2zur5y,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:31:02 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/zpdUio0  It is actually a purple bandana with the ruckus logo on it.  When worn correctly it can be used as a stylish smoke filter as the wind tends to blow from west to east pushing whatever smoke the ilf and ruckus use into the ruckus section.  I have one because sometimes it's necessary to have one and it's easier to tie it and leave it around your neck than hold your scarf up when pyro happens.  Oh and they are only 5$.  Even the most hardcore supporters suggest having something to put over your face when smoke is going and that's the only time I wear mine.
OCLions,2zur5y,dejavu85308,-1,Mon Mar 23 03:40:08 2015 UTC,Stupid.   Lets sell mask so people can hide their face and try to look scary and wonder why there are reports of fans having issues.

OCLions,2zub8i,paintballpmd,3,Sat Mar 21 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"The parking next to the stadium you need to pay for before the match through ticket master I believe, on their first match they had a lot of busses taking people from the downtown parking lots and were posting maps on social media.

OCLions,2zub8i,UnityBomber,2,Sat Mar 21 22:15:35 2015 UTC,Isn't the stadium in a pretty shady part of town?
OCLions,2zub8i,Thricey,2,Sat Mar 21 22:28:14 2015 UTC,"There were lots of people offering parking on tampa ave for $10 i believe at the opening game. It's not the best part of town, but I wouldn't be too worried since it's gameday and there will be a larger police presence."
OCLions,2zub8i,roborooter0,2,Sat Mar 21 22:41:04 2015 UTC,Yes. I mean A LOT of stadiums are built in shady areas. But nothing ever really happens near the stadium. There's a ton of people moving around etc. Have been to a lot of games and never seen anything happen.

OCLions,2zmg0k,crawfoc9,3,Thu Mar 19 20:23:04 2015 UTC,I wonder if the ticket sales will stay consistent because if they do...that shiny new stadium wont fit everyone haha
OCLions,2zmg0k,ale_chuj,3,Fri Mar 20 02:40:42 2015 UTC,"Average attendance last year was 19,045 people a game in the MLS. It's likely this is just initial excitement surrounding the new team. If we have an average to good year it's likely our numbers will stay like this, if we have a bad year it's likely they will dip."
OCLions,2zmg0k,ASIWYFA,3,Fri Mar 20 12:33:20 2015 UTC,"Bold prediction coming up.  They will dip no matter how good the play is.   I think 12-15k a game is going to end up as avg after removing the first two games.   Lets see what kind of turnout there is in June with 90+ degrees, high humidity, and thunderstorms rolling around the area at 5 or 6 keeping the walk up crowd low.     If the avg is 19k (sold) I would think that is considered a success."
OCLions,2zmg0k,beerwithanolive,3,Fri Mar 20 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, our brutal summers are going to play a large role in how many people show up."
OCLions,2zo016,logjam13,8,Fri Mar 20 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought the ledger and Hines both were better than Colin was on opening day and covered for each other well. I know Colin is supposed to be our anchor or star defender but against NYCFC he was way to gung ho and got sucked out of position a lot. That's without even taking the card into consideration. That being said I still think he will start, just not sure if he is the best option."
OCLions,2zo016,jmoney0999,3,Fri Mar 20 04:29:18 2015 UTC,"I'm upset that Brek won't be playing up this match after watching how hard he worked in against NYCFC but I understand the decision in him playing D.   The thing that I hate the most though is Higuita and Rivas being doubtful. Higuita can move the ball well and with the speed that Rivas has, its hard to even watch the game when he touches the ball because I'm so excited to see the player he could turn into."
OCLions,2zo016,SpringbobSquirepants,2,Fri Mar 20 06:30:30 2015 UTC,Agreed with Rivas/Higuita. For some reason a lot of people don't rate Higuita highly but I think he was great in the first match. Like you said he's dynamic on/off the ball and was pretty good positionally. My second best player against NYCFC. I still think we would benefit from a target man up top to hold up the ball and get the team up the pitch as Rivas hasn't been able to get behind them too much because he's been offsides. I can't wait til they are confident enough in Shea to play Rivas on the wing.
OCLions,2zo016,jmoney0999,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:30:50 2015 UTC,I certainly think you have something about confidence in Shea and Neal playing RM; but I think the bigger reason that Rivas hasn't played his true position of RM is that Rochez and Paterson haven't been available to play Forward.
OCLions,2zo016,j_andrew_h,3,Fri Mar 20 17:39:33 2015 UTC,I think we'll definitely see some Rochez.
OCLions,2zo016,catch_th3m_all,2,Fri Mar 20 14:32:40 2015 UTC,I'd rather see him (or Paterson) over Ribeiro too. I just used Tenorio's projected XI
OCLions,2zo016,catch_th3m_all,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:46:35 2015 UTC,I agree that Ribeiro will most likely start. I wouldn't be surprised if Rochez comes in at half or as an impact sub.
OCLions,2zo016,KrishnaDirty,3,Fri Mar 20 15:15:02 2015 UTC,"Anyone know if this game will be available on MLS Live?  I know it's being aired on FS1.  I don't have cable but have MLS Live.  Its frustrating sometimes being unsure of whether or not the game will be blacked out in my area (I live in Savannah, GA).  I'd so much rather watch it on MLS Live, which I pay for, rather than a sketchy stream that freezes every ten seconds."
OCLions,2zo016,Disorted,2,Sat Mar 21 02:19:57 2015 UTC,It will be on MLS Live according to /r/mls.
OCLions,2zo016,beefat99,2,Sat Mar 21 14:43:09 2015 UTC,Whats wrong with Rochez? Is he too fat?
OCLions,2zo016,j_andrew_h,2,Fri Mar 20 16:35:58 2015 UTC,Not likely fat; but maybe his endurance isn't where Coach needs it to be.
OCLions,2zo016,spikebaylor,2,Fri Mar 20 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"Through rumor and speculation it sounds like he is just not fully adjusted to the move, and so im guessing not in it 100% yet.  Its rough being 20 and packing up and leaving your home for another country, different language (though lots of spanish speakers in Orlando of course), finding a place to live, new teamates, new coach, new style etc.  Thats not to say plenty of the other young players are going through the same thing but not everyone is the same or goes through the same exact experiences."
OCLions,2zo016,DiFaz07,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:06:39 2015 UTC,He missed several weeks of preseason too. I'd imagine it's a combination. Hopefully we see him for at least 30 minutes
OCLions,2zo016,AquariusSabotage,2,Fri Mar 20 19:11:05 2015 UTC,Yes it is on MLS Live. Currently being out of the state this is an option I made sure was available. Been watching all the other games on it. Being at a bar with March Madness going on in the guy with the iPad watching MLS.
OCLions,2znv1n,Supock,9,Fri Mar 20 03:23:50 2015 UTC,Just my suggestion as we did it last week. Park by the amway center then hangout on church street before the match to get some food and drink. Then take the free bus that the city provides for matches to the stadium. It was cheaper and an all around great experience.
OCLions,2znv1n,jmoney0999,5,Fri Mar 20 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it will be much smoother tomorrow, but getting into the stadium was a giant cluster at #FillTheBowl. They were not at all prepared for 60k people flooding 6 entrances. I'd get to the stadium about an hour early.  If you're parking near the Amway Center (you can pre-purchase parking spots downtown here, and I highly recommend it), then give yourself about half an hour to take the shuttle to the stadium. I parked in lot 10, almost directly across the street from Amway, and it really reduced how much we had to walk.  They also ran out of a lot of beer (again, may not happen tomorrow with half the crowd), so if you want an adult beverage, get it early.  The energy at the first game was incredible, and I hope it's the same for you. Enjoy!"
OCLions,2znv1n,somanytictoc,3,Fri Mar 20 17:24:06 2015 UTC,"Have a great time, get there early enough to allow extra time for scanning everyone's tickets/security and checkout the parking & travel options page:  http://www.orlandocitrusbowl.com/plan-your-visit/soccer-match-information"

I mean, where would we be without South Africa and the joy that was the vuvuzela craze?"
OCLions,2zfa1d,misanthropicbuddha,4,Wed Mar 18 02:14:00 2015 UTC,Other ratings are pretty good.  Kaka's ratings are a bit overboard. Seems like most people have been guilty of that

OCLions,2zfa1d,jmoney0999,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:30:06 2015 UTC,Higuita in the first match is way too low. He was the second best player behind kaka easily.
OCLions,2zfa1d,jmoney0999,2,Wed Mar 18 03:12:28 2015 UTC,"We didn't think he played that well. Almost cost us a goal with a terrible pass. Hopefully Darwin starts on Saturday, he was solid against the dynamos"
OCLions,2zfa1d,niNroM,4,Wed Mar 18 04:20:12 2015 UTC,Higuita was great in the first match.  If you want proof...Heath said so on his radio show Tuesday.
OCLions,2zfa1d,Ronaldmethot,2,Wed Mar 18 05:50:40 2015 UTC,I guess i focused too much on the few mistakes. And although I am colombian I am also biased since I loved how Darwin played last season.

OCLions,2zfa1d,j_andrew_h,4,Wed Mar 18 14:55:37 2015 UTC,Ceren did the same thing against Houston. I though ceren was okay but that Higuita is more dynamic and that he controlled the tempo and looked much more comfortable the ceren.
OCLions,2zfa1d,jmoney0999,3,Wed Mar 18 12:31:04 2015 UTC,Ceren's give away against Houston was pretty bad; but he did spend the rest of the game making up for it.  I'm a little more comfortable with Higuita overall as he seems composed and links up with the attackers a bit better.

Take in a live game or two and follow their results.  But don't let other people define your fandom for you.  If after a while, you are more content sitting on the couch watching the game with some doritos, do that.  If you want to yell and scream in the supporter's section, do that.  But don't make those sorts of decisions based on what other people think it means to be a true supporter.  It is entertainment, so do what brings you the most enjoyment, otherwise it becomes an un-enjoyable job.  And sitting on the couch doesn't make you less of a fan.  It might make you less of a ""supporter""  in that pretentious sense, but fuck that categorization.    I made this mistake early on and came to not enjoy the game too much because I was trying to live up to other people's levels of expectation.  One big exception is that all Lions fans and all MLS fans whisper under their breath, ""hell yeah""  when their team scores a goal.  That is a bare minimum.  Anything above and beyond that is just icing on the cake! :p"

I'm really just excited to start supporting a local team again and I hope I find what works the best for me! Cheers🍻
OCLions,2zesen,Ralston_Cove,5,Wed Mar 18 02:45:01 2015 UTC,cheers mate.  :)
OCLions,2zesen,fata13xception,5,Wed Mar 18 02:47:03 2015 UTC,"There really is no switch/trick/tip to becoming a true fan.  I suppose the first step is to love soccer. Love soccer and the rest will follow, no? Don't (yet) love soccer but interested in our beautiful game? It's never too late and you'll surely be embraced... come on in, the water is warm!  Made in Germany and grinding in the USA, I was born into the game... you could say. So screaming my ass off, showing my colors... that's kind of what I do. This does not, however, make me any better than those who are recent additions to the wonderful world of soccer, those who sit quietly and enjoy the game.  As for our Lions, I'd like to suggest pre-game festivities w/ the rest of the community (if it's something you're into) and feeling free to show your excitement come game-time. Stand if you want to stand -- all game long -- or sit (at home even). What it comes down to is enthusiasm and love. Don't worry if you don't know any of the names... that's something easily remedied. Joining fan club(s), wearing jerseys/scarves, waving flags... is not mandatory and, quite honestly, doesn't make you a bigger/better fan (but does help with the immersion and gives you a common... goal).  The OCSC brain trust is regularly going out of its way to integrate with the community and it's a great opportunity to experience the organization, the players, the fans, and the euphoria first-hand. Though I was unfortunate in that I had no choice but to miss out on it, the team was here in my backyard at the Apopka Fair this past Sunday... hosting a soccer skills challenge and an hour-long autograph opportunity that I'm sure excited many existing fans, that I'm sure gave birth to some new fans.  Follow /r/MLS... follow /r/OCLions... and, if you're Twitter inclined, follow some of the many OCSC/MLS voices there... news, news, news, and fun stories/links... watch/read the game/week recaps... vote in the team/league/community polls... just have fun and do what interests you.  Ignore the elitists when they become a little too obnoxious... follow some of those who support other/rival teams for an interesting perspective on things...  I'm confident you'll find something that you enjoy, something that comes naturally.  The (MLS version of our) team is in its infancy, but immediate expectations are moderate. God willing, we'll soon have what will probably become a natural in-state rivalry with the folks in Miami. I realize my response is all over the place... and I'm sorry. Thing is, it's a great time to be a soccer fan in Orlando and, in general, a MLS fan. Exciting times!  There really is no switch/trick/tip to becoming a true fan. Just be yourself, be honest, and don't force it... because the vast majority will accept you and embrace you for who you are."
OCLions,2zesen,Ralston_Cove,2,Wed Mar 18 01:59:21 2015 UTC,"While I think you are a bit hasty on betting on a Miami franchise, i just wanted to say that I think you hit all the salient points in a fairly concise and level headed manner.  Could I recommend that you turn this into copypasta for similar posts both here and in /r/mls.  With certain details changed for the occasion, of course.   Nice job."
OCLions,2zesen,fata13xception,3,Wed Mar 18 02:14:39 2015 UTC,"No, not betting on the MIA franchise but it appears they're taking their second chance seriously... and the league appears to be amiable to the courtship. Though I'm not interested in supporting a Miami team (I'll be loud and proud for the purple), I do think they'd be a boon to the growing league and Floridian soccer. Am certainly no Beckham fan whatsoever but very much respect what he's done to help the league. In short, I think they're seizing a great opportunity (second chances are a rare commodity) but am not yet ready to wager money on it... too many moving pieces, politics.  As for the post, I appreciate your kind response. What exactly do you mean by copy/paste for similar posts? I'll continue to contribute wherever I see an opportunity but I don't want to become ""that guy"" or some preachy OCLions troll... LOL."

Thanks!"
OCLions,2zesen,fata13xception,3,Wed Mar 18 02:37:50 2015 UTC,"...and if you don't already know, go ahead and check out Hollerbach's Willow Tree Cafe in downtown Sanford. It's definitely the best German restaurant I've experienced here in Florida (plus their Magnolia Square Market has some wonderful deli and sweets from back home). Great food, great atmosphere...  Though they're not an official OSCS partner, I'd be surprised if they don't show live games... at the very least, they do show German soccer matches and organize bus trips to go see Die Mannschaft whenever we're fortunate enough to have them visit Florida.  I selfishly wish OCSC would partner with them (and a respectable Floridian craft brewery; i.e., Cigar City, Intuition, Funky Buddha, or newcomer Crooked Can)."
OCLions,2zesen,niNroM,2,Wed Mar 18 03:22:13 2015 UTC,"Nice! Where from? Bin Hamburger...  My German has become embarrassingly bad, though a few days among visiting friends usually (but temporarily) improves it. Then again, I was 9 when we moved here in '90 and so my German language education/connection was mostly cut off. Lack of use has made my brain lazy, you see. Am 34 now and I think/dream in English... my mastery of the language far exceeds what's left of my German.  Like you, I too was searching for a MLS team I could bond with since the league launched in the mid-90s. During the inaugural season, I decided to follow the Columbus Crew... because of their colors and because I like Eric Wynalda (I still proudly display a signed '94 World Cup card at work)... but, truth be told, there never was any connection and so I struggled to be anything more than a casual MLS supporter. Worse yet, each of the two Florida teams failed miserably, leaving us with nothing.  So you bet I dove in head-first when the Orlando MLS dream became a reality... win, lose, or draw... we finally have OUR TEAM... and, it would seem, we have you!"
OCLions,2zesen,OrlandoCity-Fan,2,Wed Mar 18 02:57:17 2015 UTC,Me and my family are from Würzburg and ya my German is embarrassingly bad and pretty much non existent lol.

OCLions,2zesen,pinguino42,5,Wed Mar 18 13:56:55 2015 UTC,It all depends where you live. In my opinion nothing compares to cheering for th team live.

OCLions,2zesen,Bwignite24,4,Wed Mar 18 00:53:11 2015 UTC,You better get the LA Galaxy tickets soon - they already show as close to being sold out on ticketmaster.
OCLions,2zesen,niNroM,5,Wed Mar 18 01:57:16 2015 UTC,Is that with extra seats opened? There's no way they won't sell extra tickets for the Galaxy match.
OCLions,2zesen,spikebaylor,2,Wed Mar 18 02:28:27 2015 UTC,Agreed - my bet is that they keep opening seating for every game they can this year to get a better idea of what the capacity should be for the new stadium.
OCLions,2zesen,niNroM,3,Sat Mar 21 05:20:12 2015 UTC,They are definitely going to expand seating for that game.
OCLions,2zesen,niNroM,2,Wed Mar 18 10:49:58 2015 UTC,Any reason why you don't want to go sooner?? The Toronto game should be crazy.  High probability that they can fill the bowl again(wishful thinking lol) come out sooner. It's great fun. Be sure to buy tickets early!!!
OCLions,2zdks2,daguru9,6,Tue Mar 17 18:23:28 2015 UTC,Heath has experience converting midfielders to fullbacks.  Boden was a midfielder during his career in England and converted to defense pretty successfully.  I think Burke was already a converted defender when we got him but he was a former forward.  Probably also helps that Shea's good friend Eric Avila learned how to play fullback after transitioning from the midfield and is with the team.  My point is Brek's got a system around him that can help him flourish in his new role
OCLions,2zdks2,logjam13,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:49:35 2015 UTC,Certainly very good points.
OCLions,2zdks2,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:51:49 2015 UTC,why type of midfielder was boden? was he a defensive mid or like a winger?
OCLions,2zdks2,therealshrimpd,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:31:56 2015 UTC,I believe he was a #10 but I can't find the article that says so
OCLions,2zdks2,logjam13,2,Tue Mar 17 23:55:07 2015 UTC,I'm a big Boden fan and though I 100% support that Brek is the starter at LB; I will also enjoy seeing Luke Boden showing MLS that he is a quality LB as well if Brek gets called into camp for the US.

Although personally I kind of like rewatching the games that I actually go to.  Want to watch any other teams?  Get to know the league better? Catch up on old games from previous seasons?  MLS Live is a ridiculous value.  All of the Saturday games that aren't shown nationally are viewable on MLS Live.  All of the nationally televised games (Friday Unimas, Sunday ESPN and Fox) can be seen 48 hours after they air.    The feature they don't talk up much is the Condensed matches.  Its basically like an extended highlight reel.  Condenses the match to about 20 minutes long showing all of the goals, scoring chances,  cards, and other interesting parts of the game.  It's a really great way to recap some of the more interesting matches of the weekend without having to invest an entire hour and a half to watch it."

OCLions,2z9itt,sgtrama,7,Mon Mar 16 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"I'm in ILF and I try my best not to be a jerk at the games or in social media. I hate some MLS teams very much since I was a Sounder before we had our team, but I keep it to myself.   My love for this little team that's grown up in a big way far outweighs any sour feelings I may have developed over the years. So I try to channel my passions into positivity.   I also am always self aware as a supporter for my club and SG. My actions and remarks are representative of two entities at once, I want to always honor both of them positively.  Other people don't feel this way. Like you said, pageantry. I say join ruckus, bang some drums and enjoy life."
OCLions,2z9itt,Whudevs,3,Mon Mar 16 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"It seems like this is the standard response judging by what I'm reading here. If it's all part of the deal and everyone does it, and no one takes it personally, then no harm no foul.  One question though: A few other people said here say there pick ILF. Any reason in particular why you chose one over the other? Just curious."

Supporter groups like the Timbers Army or Sons of Ben are always lauded but ours are put down. I'm not a member but I'm seriously considering it. Supporter groups are one of the reasons the MLS has moved away from the soccer mom status and into a young person's league (I'm 28) so not a spring chicken but i like cheering and having fun. :) The reality is that supporter groups do talk smack about other clubs and groups. As long as we don't take it to far, I think they're a great asset a club or league can have."

OCLions,2z9itt,LightBlueJesus,3,Wed Mar 18 02:08:22 2015 UTC,"Banter between clubs and groups is just part of supporter culture. Some take it too far, ours have in the past, but thats just how it is really. Thats whats so great about these groups though, no one is forced to join! You can bring your voice to the game, support the team however you want, and with whomever you want.   Personally, I cant sit anywhere else in the stadium but the supporters section. Well, I cant sit anywhere in general, I always stand, and Im a little too loud for your average viewer in attendance. I will probably officially join up, but I really havent made up my mind yet on that. Everyone there is really welcoming though, especially if you show up to a tailgate with beer.   Its just not for everyone, hell, theres a good chance its not for me. If the tifo, especially the one in Columbus, bothers you, then I really dont think its for you."
OCLions,2z9itt,BenZoobs,2,Mon Mar 16 19:55:31 2015 UTC,"Sure occasionally you see things that rub you the wrong way but these groups are also a big part of the community.  The FO reaches out to the supporters groups and we get to help with the clubs fundraisers and such.  Just because you join a supporters group doesn't mean you have to hate on other MLS clubs or supporters groups, the only real requirement is to share the same passion for your club on gameday.    I am a loyal member of the ILF and one of the latest things we have done was we collect donations from our members at a weekly futsal match downtown from those who want to donate.  All the donations of equipment or cash go towards helping supply proper equipment for the locals who don't have access to it."

OCLions,2z5xm1,jmoney0999,10,Sun Mar 15 21:41:22 2015 UTC,I am in love with how much the Citrus Bowl was decked-out for us. It looked absolutely great and inside the gates was much better than how it was.  I got jipped by a security manager not letting me bring in streamers though.
OCLions,2z5xm1,andrewthemexican,5,Mon Mar 16 01:26:51 2015 UTC,thats bull crap   they said we could

OCLions,2z5xm1,Dance_Monkee_Dance,2,Mon Mar 16 14:30:39 2015 UTC,Security was letting everyone bring it in last match.  Worth the risk of throwing away a $0.50 bottle of water to save $5.

OCLions,2z5xm1,nautika,3,Sun Mar 15 23:11:00 2015 UTC,I'm actually watching the replay right now to see how the Citrus Bowl looked and how our crowds sounded like on TV compared to what I just saw on TV for NYCFC.  NYCFC field is of course smaller but the camera angle definitely made it looked even narrower.  We definitely presented a better product.  And of course our fans were amazing.
OCLions,2z5xm1,Bwignite24,2,Sun Mar 15 23:33:21 2015 UTC,Agreed on all your points my friend.   Adding to that I think that the background of the outfield wall for NYCFC just looks bad as well
OCLions,2z5xm1,nautika,2,Sun Mar 15 23:36:24 2015 UTC,Where can you watch the replay?
OCLions,2z5xm1,Bwignite24,3,Mon Mar 16 07:25:15 2015 UTC,I watched it on WatchESPN.  If you have Brighthouse you should be able to get a log in.
OCLions,2z5xm1,titanzero,2,Mon Mar 16 11:13:28 2015 UTC,Yea that is the problem WatchESPN is not working for me and BH support is not helping. Oh well.
OCLions,2z5xm1,PersianImm0rtal,3,Mon Mar 16 19:22:58 2015 UTC,Yeah the Citrus Bowl looks great. They did an excellent job with the renovation and decking out the place in OCSC colors.  There should be some rule about gouging for water though. $5 for a bottle of water on such a hot day becomes a medical issue.
OCLions,2z5xm1,Bwignite24,2,Mon Mar 16 21:01:16 2015 UTC,"I am just sad because they are not opening up the upper bow, It will look tacky with only the lower bowl open."
OCLions,2z5xm1,TB_Dark,5,Mon Mar 16 04:40:01 2015 UTC,The demand is not there to open up the upper decks. Maybe if we reach far in the playoffs they will.
OCLions,2z5xm1,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Mar 16 07:24:45 2015 UTC,I think if we're fortunate to host a playoff game they'll open the upper deck

OCLions,2z5ioj,secretlyadog,4,Mon Mar 16 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"I think most of the people in ILF/Ruckus got there between 1 hour to 45 mins before kickoff, but they have their own section in the middle. Personally if you get there 30 mins before you should be fine. Even though it's GA, everyone doesn't push for the closest seats so you'll be fine."
OCLions,2z5ioj,TB_Dark,2,Sun Mar 15 20:24:17 2015 UTC,Honestly.... we sat in the last row of the lower level and the view was great.   The upper bowl is closed off right? I doubt there will a bad seat in the place.
OCLions,2z5ioj,secretlyadog,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"The supporters groups typically will not come in that early. The team asked for supporters to come in by warmups to set the atmosphere early and be there during the buildup.   Typically the march in will occur about 30 minutes before kick off. Also, their section is roped off so you won't be able to get into that portion of the section."
OCLions,2z5ioj,mcn11,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"I found if you were looking at the SG from the field, the section all the way to the right was pretty sparsely populated through the home opener. Had no problems finding seats for 5, and hell could have managed palces for a group of 20-30 with only 30 minutes before kickoff.  Next section over and all the way to the Ruckus' old section was packed shoulder to shoulder though."
OCLions,2z6ivs,great_gator_bait,8,Mon Mar 16 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"I genuinely like them as a team and I think while the manufactured style of the team's origin is a bit fake, they do have a great squad and they were fun to watch today. The die-hard OCity fan in me doesn't like them and I think the fact that their jerseys look exactly like Manchester City's make them look even more forced."
OCLions,2z6ivs,DELIVERER407,3,Mon Mar 16 01:18:30 2015 UTC,Respect.  Nice showing tonight thought NER looked wounded for most of the match.  Looking forward to our meeting in July.
OCLions,2z6ivs,KarmaKalls,2,Mon Mar 16 02:09:31 2015 UTC,A part of me wants to root for them as expansion bros to show the league what both teams can do.
OCLions,2z6ivs,TB_Dark,6,Mon Mar 16 04:19:11 2015 UTC,"I absolutely HATE how the OCSC front office and supporter's groups are pushing this rivalry on us. Just because NYCFC was given an MLS franchise before us with none of the same stipulations placed on us doesn't mean we have any reason to be rivals.  That being said, just because we're both coming in this year, I really really want them to do worse than us. Which, based on today, might not happen. Villa + Mix > Kaka + Shea. Still, it's a long season."
OCLions,2z6ivs,XmusJaxonFlaxonWaxon,4,Mon Mar 16 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"They gave up a TON of chances against NE. I think our DMs are better than theirs and will keep one goal advantages as wins instead of draws, which might be a problem for NYC. Again, it's a long season."
OCLions,2z6ivs,secretlyadog,6,Mon Mar 16 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"Villa + Mix is not better than Kaka Shea.   Will you be at the match this weekend?  I'd like to take some time to talk to you about the Church of Brek, perhaps see if Sheantology is right for you."
OCLions,2z6ivs,somanytictoc,2,Mon Mar 16 07:45:09 2015 UTC,Only problem with the Church of Brek is that you have to fall to your knees to pray too often.

Kaká is better than all four of the players you mentioned, but so far he doesnt have a proper strike partnership yet, since Rivas has been pretty bad at reading his play.   Once we get Ribeiro or Rochez playing up front that should change."
OCLions,2z6ivs,KarmaKalls,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:37:03 2015 UTC,The other thread is the Yankees / Red Sox rivalry since NYC is playing at their stadium and NER is therefore a more natural rival.  I say we just let it evolve naturally but folks who write for a living need something to fill the space.
OCLions,2z6ivs,estuhbawn,1 point,Mon Mar 16 09:33:31 2015 UTC,"We vastly outplayed them in week 1. They honestly have a lot more skill up front, but our midfield dominated theirs for large parts of the first match. obviously both clubs will improve over the course of the season, but I'd say we're about even at the moment."
OCLions,2z6ivs,somanytictoc,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:38:15 2015 UTC,"I really didn't want to like NYCFC. The front office problems, Lampardgate, Man City kits, etc. But I LOVE their logo and their away jerseys, and they've been incredibly exciting to watch so far. I'm torn."
OCLions,2z6ivs,misanthropicbuddha,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:16:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to watch their match with NE, but they won 2-0 so I'm inferring they are starting to click as a team.    As many have written already, the MLS scriptwriters are trying to push the plot of having the two expansion clubs be rivals only on that front.  Also, it doesn't help that during the off-season, OC has come off looking like massive faces (wrestling term, i.e., good guys) with all the praise that the media has given the club on various fronts; while NYCFC are being portrayed as massive heels (i.e., bad guys) on most fronts.  Naturally, OC v. NYC would seem to be a natural fit.  Overall, I think Man City II...err...I mean...NYCFC is a good team and should be fun to watch (when I can watch another of their matches).  Much respect.  (Except when they play OC, then they can suck hard.)"
OCLions,2z6ivs,macaco_gordinho,2,Mon Mar 16 03:29:39 2015 UTC,NE is going to play poorly until Jones comes back healthy. They had a lot of good looks though at the goal but just didn't get anything in.
OCLions,2z6ivs,catch_th3m_all,-1,Mon Mar 16 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"I don't like them. I like Villa and I love Mix but I don't like them, the idea of them, and how Garber gave NY another team just for the sake of it before us. I really, really don't like their fans. Do I consider them a rival? No. Do I hope we beat the crap out of them every time we play? Yes."

OCLions,2ywj2f,caedus8,8,Sat Mar 14 00:37:40 2015 UTC,"Man, you guys are on this match thread early. Loved watching you guys play and will hate to have to play you. As an SKC fan, have fun being mad at Colin all the time. He's pretty rough and gets a fair amount of cards, but he will bail you out a ton as well.  What do you think your starting XI will be?"
OCLions,2ywj2f,nonameshere,5,Fri Mar 13 12:59:13 2015 UTC,I think the only change is St. Ledger in for Collin. I think we'll play more defensively but I doubt we see Boden in for Shea or something like that. Moving Rivas to the left sounds tempting but I'm afraid that weakens that flank. Neal provides a lot of room for Shea to work in and a more conservative approach.
OCLions,2ywj2f,logjam13,2,Fri Mar 13 14:36:16 2015 UTC,not expecting Rochez to start this game?
OCLions,2ywj2f,babacristo,2,Fri Mar 13 20:26:40 2015 UTC,good chance of keeping Neal in to be more defensive minded than Rivas would be.  Could still put Rochez in and let Rivas sit bench.  I'm hoping for that since Rochez is on my fantasy team.

OCLions,2ywj2f,spikebaylor,5,Sat Mar 14 00:59:28 2015 UTC,So excited for tonight.  No major expectations for a result but will be happy as long as we look better that last week.  Our defense is a little weak but to flip the old saying... our best defense is a great offense.  If we continue to control the midfield and convert more maybe we can overcome those short commings.  We should have paid for tally hall to fly out there and sit behind Deric and heckle him all night.  That'd be fun.

OCLions,2ywj2f,great_gator_bait,5,Fri Mar 13 12:44:37 2015 UTC,Im general im with you on rivas left and rochez top.  Certainly once all of our kinks are worked out that will be the plan.  My guess is neal is still in on left.. to be more defensive minded this game with collin out. Maybe rochez up top this time?  I hope so... still have him on my fantasy team :).  Guessing st ledger in for collin.  Could be Conner but i think we bring in the experience.. or we wouldnt have bothered to sign him.
OCLions,2ywj2f,SamuelMuniz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:06:02 2015 UTC,2 red cards in Charleston and not our strongest 11 to start anyway. We should expect a point and hope for 3 imo.

OCLions,2ywj2f,ghornett,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:07:10 2015 UTC,It was tried last year at half time and kind of abandoned for 2015.  There was also quite a bit of hate against it for some reason as well.
OCLions,2ywj2f,spoonman33,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:17:25 2015 UTC,I feel like it'd be a good song to play before the game while everyone is still getting settled.  Its a good way to get hyped up for the game I think.  I think either I didn't notice it or they had stopped trying to play it at half time by the time I started going to games last year.
OCLions,2ywj2f,pvdfan,2,Fri Mar 13 20:51:00 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if this game will be on MLSlive locally? Does univisiondeportes.com make you sign in to watch?
OCLions,2ywj2f,djveneko,3,Fri Mar 13 13:58:18 2015 UTC,"According to the latest and greatest information over at r/MLS, there are no blackouts for the local Orlando market."
OCLions,2ywj2f,messy_messiah,3,Fri Mar 13 14:35:47 2015 UTC,"It will not be live as all the nationally televised games, including this, are blacked out everywhere in the US.  Univision Deportes unfortunately does require a cable provider log in to watch on their apps and website."
OCLions,2ywj2f,djveneko,3,Fri Mar 13 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a cable provider to use for univisiondeportes.com you can sign up for the 7 days free trial of sling.com and add the sport package, it has univision deportes."
OCLions,2ywj2f,spikebaylor,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:06:02 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm now watching through sling on my computer. Do you know how to switch it to English?
OCLions,2ywj2f,OCSC407,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:56:07 2015 UTC,No sorry they are supposed to implement English subtitles to this channel but not sure if it is available yet.
OCLions,2ywj2f,ghornett,2,Fri Mar 13 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"If you don't have cable, you can get Univision through an over the air Antenna.  It comes in in beautiful HD, and as long as your TV has the SAP function (which it probably does) you get to watch in English should you so desire.  the ""Viernes de Futbal"" on Unimas/Univision is actually the one nationally televised game on a weekly basis that works out nicely for those of us without cable."
OCLions,2ywj2f,laser-TITS,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"Looks like blackout on MLSLive This game is blacked out in your area because the game is available on national or local television. Please check your local listings for the game, or go to MLSsoccer.com for more information"

OCLions,2ywj2f,pvdfan,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:24:25 2015 UTC,if you have directv you can watch unimas live from directv.com ... just find the game in the guide and there should be a button that says watch now or something like that.

OCLions,2ywj2f,Hygienicnerd,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"right there with you.  All I really want out of this game is to see us improve.  crisper passes, better chances on goal, less unforced errors, etc.  Going cardless would also be nice.  Getting points out of the match would be bonus as far as I'm concerned.  We have a few fairly tough matches coming up if I remember, so I'll take a couple dropped points early on as long as there is noticeable improvement from week to week."
OCLions,2ywj2f,messy_messiah,2,Fri Mar 13 20:59:59 2015 UTC,Rochez and Higuita not in the 18?

Wonder if Higuita has a slight injury?  Thought he played fairly well last week.  Had some missed passes and stuff, but so did the rest of the team."
OCLions,2ywj2f,AK_91,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:58:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Higuita was a standout for me last week. I hope it isn't serious."

OCLions,2ywj2f,arleavit,2,Fri Mar 13 23:04:11 2015 UTC,watching form NY on MLS Live. The guide said the game would switch to English during kickoff but it has not.
OCLions,2ywj2f,spikebaylor,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:08:23 2015 UTC,It only just switched for me. I had to turn it off then on again :/

OCLions,2ywj2f,BonafideZulu,2,Fri Mar 13 23:14:54 2015 UTC,Molino looks like he's never played with anyone on the pitch before
OCLions,2ywj2f,benshovian,2,Fri Mar 13 23:42:34 2015 UTC,2 things so far:  1.molino looks lost 2.why do we keep forcing it inside when we have so much space outside
OCLions,2ywj2f,fuzzysmilez,2,Fri Mar 13 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"overall more conservative than last week, but I'd say better overall.  Defense still does some stupid shit sometimes, but apart from those momentary lapses, we havent' looked lost or out of place like we have been.    Offense almost the opposite, flashes of brilliance and then mostly average play.    Neal needs to come off.  I really want to see Rivas over there next week with rochez up top."
OCLions,2ywj2f,germsj,2,Fri Mar 13 23:56:21 2015 UTC,How the hell does Neal miss that bad?

OCLions,2ywsdv,qoou,8,Fri Mar 13 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"City soccer hit it on the nose for me:    Brek was consistently dangerous overlapping down the left side. However, he still needs to work on his ability to get a cross off. He almost acted as the left midfielder when Orlando was in possession and Lewis Neal seemed to just get out of the way and let him do his thing. His one-on-one defending was good and he fended one particularly dangerous situation in the 2nd half. Shea still found himself out of position at times, forcing Seb Hines to cover for him. He’s still learning, but it was very postive debut at left back.  http://citysoccertalk.com/player-grades-notes-orlando-city-vs-new-york-city/"
OCLions,2ywsdv,germsj,2,Fri Mar 13 14:18:08 2015 UTC,Shea is a creative player that should be playing more attacking then defending in my opinion I would even rather him been playing up top instead of Rivas against NYCFC. Breks speed and ball handle and proven record for scoring goals is being overlooked...
OCLions,2ywsdv,shaqueeffa,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:05:08 2015 UTC,With Ramos I think villa was drifting to his side so he had some more defensive responsibilities
OCLions,2ywsdv,jmoney0999,2,Fri Mar 13 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"Ramos did what I expected a back to do. On the contrary, I was more wondering if Shea was overly aggressive and out of position, looking for glory, returning to his preferred position."
OCLions,2ywsdv,spikebaylor,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"As others have said... the backs moving up the wing onto offense is a big part of our style so expect more of it  I DO think Shea still has to get into the mindset that he is a defender as he tends to hang out up field longer than he should once the play is dead.  But he'll always be making those overlapping runs.  As for Ramos he did move up more than you may have noticed, it just wasnt as flashy as Shea. He did play more conservatively towards the defensive side and im guessing that was on purpose.  We get beat on the counter too often so having one of the backs be a bit more defensive leaning may help.  If shea doesnt track back then they can all shift over a bit to cover."
OCLions,2ywsdv,somanytictoc,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"Ramos was coming up pretty frequently when we were attacking. My friend must have pointed at him and yelled ""give him the ball!"" like a dozen times. Brek drew a lot more attention to himself, so I think it's just perception that Ramos wasn't coming up.  I certainly hope Shea stays at home a little more tonight. We need the defensive help, assuming Houston's offense is a lot better than they were against Columbus."
OCLions,2ywsdv,macaco_gordinho,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:35:09 2015 UTC,Brek fits perfectly in as a winger and compliments his role with the USMNT. Coach Heath has pretty much given him the green light to get up the field and make some plays as well.
OCLions,2ywsdv,kingfridaythexiii,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think in most games, he'll have the green light to attack.  Not sure why Ramos wasn't upfield more though.  NYC kinda parked the bus."

OCLions,2yu0v9,spikebaylor,2,Fri Mar 13 12:40:37 2015 UTC,"I was think the opposite on the Houston attack, attacking on the wings would be the best option for them.  NYCFC was getting shut down in the middle before Shleton came on.  When he came on, they started attacking more from the wings and became more effective (Mix's goal not withstanding).    I think with Shea and Ramos playing forward and Shea weakness at defending, the wings might be a greater weakness...  At least that what it looked like from the North End... I was also dealing with a row of drunk Russians and some heavy drama from another group... :)"

OCLions,2ytkhy,daguru9,5,Thu Mar 12 18:25:50 2015 UTC,This is MLS trying to get back what they lost in the CBA through fines.

Could even get him to take down the NYCFC scarf perhaps.  edit: Just spoke with the owner, and they have already purchased an Orlando City flag to hang in the bar. Will offer promotions ($1 off beers during matches) and promote on social media as well.

OCLions,2yr6f1,dampowell,1 point,Fri Mar 13 03:30:50 2015 UTC,"I think there is one thing missing on the Orlando team to actually make inroads as far as the playoffs are concerned. They need someone with a varying passing range to get the very best out of Kaka - Sadly someone like Lampard or Gerrard would be the perfect type of player to play alongside Kaka.   but the three starting midfielders either don't have the ability or capability to play balls that switch the field. Kaka is a master of finding space to do damage, and way too often he is wide open on the far side to receive a 30 - 40 yard diagonal pass and it just never happens.  Someone like Mikel Arteta would be the biggest coo for Orlando in the short term. Considering how young the team is though I could see us doing well in 2 to 5 years."

Keep in mind, if you are a member of The Ruckus or Iron Lion Firm, DO NOT SCALP SUPPORTERS SECTION TICKETS! If you cannot use your tickets, sell them to other members of your group for no more than face value. Selling tickets for more than face value is a ban-able offense in both Ruckus and ILF."

And Brovsky against Molino, you can see Brovsky immediately ask the ref for a yellow, kind of persuading the ref into believing that was a dive.  Should've been non calls and let the play go on."
OCLions,2yk0y6,Tercio7,5,Tue Mar 10 13:50:50 2015 UTC,The call in the 78th minute was right in front of me and was most certainly a pen. The defender clipped his back leg and Higuita lost his balance.

OCLions,2yk0y6,j_andrew_h,4,Tue Mar 10 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"I have had a similar take on the three calls as well.  I'm willing to concede on the one against Shea there wasn't a lot there but probably should have been a no-call if he didn't think there was enough to it for a PK; but I certainly don't think he threw himself on the ground.  Also in none of the three does the Orlando City player flail around, throw their arms out like an idiot or fake injury to lure the referee... they simply fell down after being tripped.    Ironically, the ref was given praise by many online for being brave enough to snuff out diving; but you could argue that he didn't have the guts to call a PK especially on the trip of Higuita in the box.    I was disapointed that the MLS ""Instant Replay"" segment with Simon Borg decided to not weigh in on the controversial dive calls only saying ""what do you think of the simulation calls, do you think they were legit?  Leave your comments below...""    And that my friend is called ""Click Bait"" say something that is going to create a shit storm and watch the online ad revenue come in from all the clicks, comments, and page views."
OCLions,2yk0y6,spikebaylor,2,Tue Mar 10 15:27:35 2015 UTC,Yeah i was looking forward to instant replay and he gave us nothing.  On extra time radio it sounded like everyone was on the refs side.
OCLions,2yk0y6,j_andrew_h,2,Tue Mar 10 16:08:46 2015 UTC,I like extra time.. but they are so corporate.. they aren't going to say much that makes MLS look bad in any way.
OCLions,2yk0y6,Popcornshrimpeater,2,Tue Mar 10 16:14:52 2015 UTC,"You're very right. I've seen a lot of media (including some analysts on ESPN FC) basically applauding the ref for cracking down on diving without actually addressing if he got the calls right. I'm all for reducing diving in soccer, but when at minimum 2/3 calls are absolutely wrong its not the time for applause."

OCLions,2yk3uc,Double_J88,10,Tue Mar 10 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"Doing the same three chants over and over is the best way to lose atmosphere and momentum, IMO. That's a major reason why we have so many. Most of them are just a few lines, so they shouldn't be that hard to learn.   As the season goes on we will have more player chants as well, which are generally short and easy to learn. If you were at Disney last season you should have heard several of those. If the long songs are too much, which is completely understandable, I'd stick to the player chants until you master the longer ones."
OCLions,2yk3uc,taylor314gh,2,Tue Mar 10 14:37:08 2015 UTC,"My point was more that I had learned the songs, but since I was sitting on the other side of midfield, we we're never able to pick up on what the supporters section was doing except the clapping on the free kicks.   I agree that a variety of songs is great to sustain for 90+ minutes. I can only compare to watching Premier League games on TV, as an Arsenal fan there are constant songs, but there are a few (By far the greatest team..., come on Arsenal, and a few of the player specific songs (Giroud, Cazorla, etc.) where everyone in the stadium participates.  Better overall fan participation will happen as the season progresses I'm sure. I just think that there should be a few songs that are so transcendent that every fan should be able to easily identify and participate so that the entire fanbase participates and not just the SG's."
OCLions,2yk3uc,taylor314gh,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a gooner as well, I help run the Orlando branch of the fan club (PM me if you aren't a member of it and want details). This may sound greedy or petty, but I think the SGs view several of the chants as ""for us."" Of course we'd love the entire stadium to have the same level of passion as we do, but we aren't trying to engineer it or force people into it. But I get what you mean by not being able to tell what we are saying from a distance, perhaps you can cue in on the drum beat that goes with each song? I'm not one of the drummers but it seems to me that each has its own beat."
OCLions,2yk3uc,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have no issue with some or even most of the chants being for the SGs.  They are putting in the work they should enjoy it (within the MLS conduct policy please); but I'm sure they enjoy getting the entire stadium going in ""Orlando"" - ""City"" and such... but this will happen organically.  They are doing their thing already and more and more new fans will catch on."
OCLions,2yk3uc,spikebaylor,5,Tue Mar 10 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree except i just dont see the entire place erupting into chants often.  It works well with the ORLANDO!..... CITY! back and forth, but i dont see anything more working that well.  However there were a few times when the entire stadium joined in to clap patterns or stomps.  I think this might be a better idea.  If some of the chants have very easy and recognizeable clapping patterns i could see everyone getting into that.  The SGs did a good job with this specifically everyone clapping and then with their hands in the air.  This caused the supporters section to look very unified and personified ""the wall"".. It made it easy to see something special was going on and easy for everyone else to join in."
OCLions,2yk3uc,j_andrew_h,4,Tue Mar 10 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I think they are doing it the right already, there were just too many people on Sunday that had never been before (which si great of course).  I like that ""The Wall"" sings their old ones, some new ones and then starts up the ""Orlando"" - ""City"" and also the claps ""OC"" - ""SC"" on corner kicks.  Over time the newer fans will get the hang of it and the newer fans in the wall will get louder as well.  In time; maybe one other simple but awesome chant that the rest of the stadium could join in with would be good if there isn't one already."
OCLions,2yk3uc,3tnuoccayawaworht,2,Tue Mar 10 15:08:52 2015 UTC,I agree mostly. The new fans want to learn and be a part of the atmosphere but were mostly lost and could only handle the claps. There should be a couple signature songs/chants that are pushed hard so that all the fans can catch on. Then once the new guys have those down we can bring them along on the others.
OCLions,2yk3uc,RVCFever,2,Tue Mar 10 14:58:05 2015 UTC,"A more diverse songbook is better, trust me. Better than hearing the same songs over and over from every single team.

You can't expect a crowd of 60k plus, most of whom have never been to an OCSC game to immediately pick up on the chants led by the supporters that have been there from day 1.    By comparing a first year MLS team with mostly new fans to atmospheres in the EPL/England where professional clubs have been around 100 years plus is dopey and foolish."

Examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de4IYfrG5NI&spfreload=10 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vruehFP4W3Y   I just played as Orlando City on FIFA 15 for the first time, and even our crowd in the game can be heard singing this song."
OCLions,2yln50,sawillis,0,Tue Mar 10 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"Ill listen out for that, I finally got that update to work! I wouldnt be surprised if we did something like it, Im sure well have a Kaká song at some point, at the very least a chant."
OCLions,2yln50,mikesicle,2,Tue Mar 10 23:33:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the update hasn't worked very well for me on Xbox One.  I still haven't been able to use OCSC in a few game modes. Hopefully EA will update FIFA again soon.  But when it does work, I hear the Kaká song/chant most of the game.    SGs just need to find a catchy English version of ""Siam Venuti Fin Qua Per Vedere Segnare Kaká"".  I'm sure Kaká would appreciate hearing our crowd sing a melody he heard so many times while at Milan."

OCLions,2yln50,mikesicle,3,Tue Mar 10 23:06:53 2015 UTC,The atmosphere is already built in 121. Why dumb it down? If the rest of the stadium wants to learn the chants there isn't a single thing stopping them other than their own laziness...
OCLions,2yln50,mikesicle,2,Tue Mar 10 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"And the fact that the more complex the chant or song the less likely it is to be in sync as it goes around the stadium.  It then turns into garbled mess.  No one is saying stop what you are doing, but adding a simple chant or two would be a net positive for the atmosphere overall.  Orlando >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> City would be a terrific way to do that.  Simple, quick and easy to join in as newbies walk in the gates.  Complex cheers will grow over time, but not adding the simple in year 1 seems counter productive."
OCLions,2yln50,mikesicle,-1,Tue Mar 10 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"They already do that chant! We were down to 10 men and losing, so they probably didnt think to start it. And this is NOT year 1. This is our 5th season, just the first in MLS. These groups are FULLY ESTABLISHED. Dont like what they do, start your own! Get 50 people together and contact the club to get official recognition."

It took FOREVER to get into the game if you arrived after 4:30, merch was a giant cluster, crowd control/security was pretty lackluster...all in all, they did not manage the gameday experience very smoothly.  On the other hand, the Lynx ride was smooth sailing and very well-run, and the game was absolutely incredible.

They've had a lot of calls about the scarves. Marketing was in a meeting now and (deservedly) off yesterday so she will know more when they are out of the meeting. The scarves were handled by Adidas and some shipments were delayed because of the bad weather up north. They are hoping to get more in but she wasn't certain if/when, and will let me know when she knows, then took my name and phone number.  On that note, I gotta give a thumbs up to whoever hires OCSC staff. I've yet to have a bad experience calling for information. Everyone has been super helpful."

OCLions,2yh1v6,MattBinYYC,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"yeah we had gotten to the stadium a few hours earlier, so stopped and got some terrible stadium food (for the last time) and went to look for the inaugural shirts.  We had already been to our seats to check them out during the open practice so no reason to rush out into the heat.  As bad as the merch situation was, it really shows the interest in the team.  I'm going to guess that a lot of previous fans already had merch and might have chosen to forgo those lines, which means there were also a good chunk of newly acquired fans who were willing to wait in 45+ min lines just to buy a shirt or scarf."
OCLions,2yh1v6,Triig,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:53:21 2015 UTC,I will say that the number of jerseys in the crowd was incredible... Great for the club.
OCLions,2yh1v6,synmo,2,Tue Mar 10 02:14:30 2015 UTC,The upper bowl mech stands had only the gray first game t-shirt and I was lied to by a staff member that said they all had the same merch.  Also they had no clue there was a season ticket discount or have any way to scan the yearbook price.
OCLions,2yh1v6,jmoney0999,2,Mon Mar 9 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"The WORST part was is they didn't even have the same stuff at every location.

I asked a lady at one station and she had no clue where I could find that specific style she was like ""I dunno"" and told me that there where ten different ""stations"" around the stadium and could be at any of them.

OCLions,2ygg5r,mikesicle,2,Mon Mar 9 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"For a team who thrives on passing and possession... we make terrible passing mistakes.  Most of it i think looks like nerves... almost like they do drills where they can only touch it 3 times or for so many seconds before passing it off and so sometimes they dump it off without being fully in control.  We sometimes have a problem with putting any conviction on our passes or just plain lazy passing.  It looked better yesterday than in early preseason but still there.  Hopefully that all gets cleaned up.  Due to the number of passes we take our completion needs to be super high... i mean 20% misses of 500 passes is still 100 turn overs.  If our passes get better and first touch (which also needs a lot of work) improve, we'll be a dominate force."
OCLions,2ygg5r,spikebaylor,2,Mon Mar 9 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"I remember Adrian Heath talking about how they arent moving the ball fast enough. You could see their hesitation which led them to just hold the ball up, and when they tried to move it quick we rather lost possession or sent the ball out of play.   We need to fix that shit before Houston, that will be one hell of a test."
OCLions,2ygg5r,mikesicle,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:05:00 2015 UTC,"I hope he isnt just drilling them wth speed speed speed.  To be cheesy and quote Shawn T (Insanity/T25 fame)... ""you cant go fast if you're out of control"".  They need to get those first touches and control down first... then work on speeding it up and making quicker decisions.  If they are too slow and hold for too long.. they still have posession and maybe they miss that give and go or through ball.... but moving it back and restarting is preffered over giving it away IMHO."
OCLions,2ygg5r,spikebaylor,2,Mon Mar 9 19:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think we share the same worries. I think we would have seen more speed and giveaways if he was drilling them on speed alone, I like to think he is more slowly adapting them to a more manageable system. We could tika taka around USL teams with ease, but that wont cut it in MLS."

OCLions,2yfqly,qoou,8,Mon Mar 9 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"Its 19500 seats, with structural plans to expand (around 23000 i think, someone can correct me if im wrong).    Its hard to answer the question just yet though.  This was one game with a ton of hype and backing so you cant use it to accurately judge the rest of the season or future seasons.  However i was extremely impressed with the turn out, and there is certainly a chance that the team will be expanding quicker than planned.  We'll just have to see if the crouds continue to come... especially if we have a mediocre season which will probably be the case at least for the first half or so."
OCLions,2yfqly,spikebaylor,3,Mon Mar 9 13:53:16 2015 UTC,I'd like to see the club use the first few additional home games this season (or as long as they can wait) to access the size of the crowds they might get moving forward.  I don't want them to get swept up in the moment and go too big... but really what wrong steps has Rawlins taken so far?  They'll figure it out I'm sure.
OCLions,2yfqly,j_andrew_h,2,Mon Mar 9 14:18:52 2015 UTC,Agreed and it sounds like thats the direction they are going.  Rawlins has already hinted at opening up more seats for vancouver.  Id love to get to a point where we're at least on par with the number LA put up this weekend.
OCLions,2yfqly,spikebaylor,3,Mon Mar 9 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"Montreal had 2 games around 60k in their first season, but couldn't sellout 20k last year. It could be another Seattle situation, but it could be a Montreal situation."
OCLions,2yfqly,CACuzcatlan,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:53:55 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Id like to say our fan support is better than that (and it very well might be) but from what i heard montreal had a very long and well supported history up until then so im sure they thought the same thing.
OCLions,2yfqly,spikebaylor,2,Mon Mar 9 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"19,500 raises the number of unsold seats to 28%, up from 25%. It still seems very low to me."
OCLions,2yfqly,spikebaylor,3,Mon Mar 9 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah not going to argue with you on that.  Its a hard set of numbers to judge.  With the STH making up such a huge portion of your seats, you mostly guarantee a good showing week to week.  Yet you may alienate more casual fans who cant get tickets.  Then once again on the other hand... its like artificial demand via lack of supply.  When games constantly sell out, it creates more of a buzz and an increased perception of quality which increases the desire of casual fans to go.  On the flip side if they kept it at 14k STH and capped total seats to 28k making it 50% .. youll still get half the stadium for sure but run the risk of missing the mark by a few thousand which makes the stadium appear empty and make attendance look bad, even if there are actually more people there.  In the end it comes down to marketting.  I DO beleive we can realistically sell out more than 19.5k but you have to find that fine line and i think having this year at the citrus bowl will be really useful for finding that perfect number."
OCLions,2yfqly,spikebaylor,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:24:32 2015 UTC,And don't forget A LOT of the tickets to yesterdays game were either given away or heavily discounted through one program or another.

OCLions,2yfqly,pvdfan,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, and a lot of people just won't go to every game. season tickets will probably taper off as well.

OCLions,2yfqly,CACuzcatlan,2,Mon Mar 9 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"I wish the new stadium was closer to 30,000 but the team will be thrilled for 19,500 with room to expand around 3,500 more.  It will allow them to raise ticket prices across the board, make said tickets a valuable commodity, and even end up rasing the TV ratings.  The one iffy thing crowd wise is what the casual fans do if Orlando City ends up being a low table team and misses the playoffs?  It's been shown by the Magic and every other pro team in FL that if you don't win, a vast majority bail ASAP.  Edit:  Spelling is hard on a tablet."

Add in the away fans watching their team while on a theme park vacation along with scalpers going after those tickets that hit the public and it seems easy for the team to raise rates when the demand will easily be there."

OCLions,2ydxao,AJMcCoy612,15,Sun Mar 8 23:47:13 2015 UTC,The energy in the stadium after that goal was pretty insane for at least 2 or 3 minutes. People were losing their minds. Was a fun game to watch and getting the equalizer in stoppage time was the best.
OCLions,2ydxao,Pulseplug,10,Mon Mar 9 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Wish it was a winning goal, but a stoppage time goal to tie is second best."

OCLions,2yfyf3,sault9,5,Mon Mar 9 14:14:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Higuita and Okugo owned the midfield in the first half, NYCFC kept trying to attack through the middle and it wasn't happening.  The second half they switch to more wide play and started to get better results...  At this point, I think Higuita is the stronger player (between him and Ceren).  However, Ceren will get his opportunities..."
OCLions,2yfyf3,daguru9,3,Mon Mar 9 15:38:23 2015 UTC,I thought that Higuita and Okugo were solid. Just didn't like that they gave up the ball deep in midfield a few times. Some scary moments
OCLions,2yfyf3,CH_XJ,5,Mon Mar 9 15:41:58 2015 UTC,At this point Higuita is the starter and other than the dive call (still think he was cleanly tripped) he and Okugo owned the defensive midfield.  In the preseason matches Ceren had a number of turnovers that lead directly to attacks against us.  I'm not saying that Darwin can't win the position back; but for the moment I think Cristian Higuita has it.
OCLions,2yfyf3,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:36:54 2015 UTC,Would have liked to see him come on during the second half. Felt Higuita was making a few mistakes and some fresh legs on defense would have been great.
OCLions,2yfyf3,niNroM,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"Watch the game again.  Higuita played an awesome game.  He is an outstanding player miles ahead of Darwin at the moment.    Darwin is important because as head strong and temperamental as Higuita is, he is bound to have card issues as the season goes along."
OCLions,2yetxy,LonestarJones,8,Mon Mar 9 04:50:25 2015 UTC,"NYCFC fan coming in peace.   Loved your tifo yesterday. Looked awesome. And this video really shows the amount of work it takes.

OCLions,2ydlu5,Whudevs,2,Mon Mar 9 01:11:35 2015 UTC,woooooo
OCLions,2ye8ml,MiceCantDriveCars,6,Mon Mar 9 01:26:15 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you. I've been watching the English since the 80's. I've never watched the MLS because it's not of the same standard as the European leagues. I live in Orlando now and I've been to a few matches over the last 2-3 seasons. I have season ticketsto this season and I'm going to start getting into MLS. If I don't, I'll still be here supporting Orlando."
OCLions,2ye8ml,baltimorescouser,6,Mon Mar 9 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"Let's see. Some off the top of my head:  Kevin Molino, Tyler Turner, Tommy Redding, Rafael Ramos, Harrison Heath and maybe a couple others I forget all came up from the USL team. Molino plays for his national team (Trinidad) and was our star back in USL. Ramos is one to keep an eye on this season if you ask me. He's a young'un who came over from Benfica.  Tally Hall's expected to be a good goalkeeper if he ever stops being injured.  Amobi Okugo came to Orlando from Philadephia this season. I like him. Seems like a swell guy.  Brek Shea and Brek Shea's Hair play for the US national team. He used to play in Dallas, left for England somewhere and I guess that didn't work out because now he's back. A lot of questions of whether he could adjust to the LB position in preseason but he looked good in tonight's game.  Kaka's decent.  Carlos Rivas and Bryan Rochez are our other DPs (or something?). I don't have much to say about them other than judging from tonight Rivas has a fundamental misunderstanding of the offside rule."
OCLions,2ye8ml,pinguino42,7,Mon Mar 9 03:14:44 2015 UTC,To add on to this  Darwin Ceren also came from the USL and is the captain of the Salvadorian national team. He was very solid all last season. I really wanted him to get subbed in for Higuita to solidify the defense a bit more.  Collins is an MLS allstar and is our anchor at center back. You saw him today clearing every single header that came his way. Only downside is that he has gotten consecutive red cards.  Rivas (not DP) was bought from Deportivo Cali and it is said he is one of the fastest players in the MLS.
OCLions,2ye8ml,niNroM,2,Mon Mar 9 05:02:33 2015 UTC,Actually Tenorio said Rivas has been reclassified as a DP and Heath and Turner now count as Homegrown. I assume we needed the cap space after the league minimum raised and and the cap didn't (at least not by as much)
OCLions,2ye8ml,logjam13,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:11:51 2015 UTC,"I think those designations were held up by the CBA negotiations...  The club had hoped to be able to buy down Rivas, but the league said no, but they did approve HG for Heath and Turner."
OCLions,2ye8ml,daguru9,1 point,Mon Mar 9 12:41:46 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I just thought it was interesting that all three changes lowered the cap hit
OCLions,2ye8ml,logjam13,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:59:58 2015 UTC,"Makes me wonder if OCSC had a feeling this was going to happen, Rivas as a DP, and that is why they didn't sign a third one.  Although being a Young DP helps with the cap even more..."
OCLions,2ye8ml,daguru9,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:45:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd like to know how negotiations went when they had no clue how the CBA would end up. I imagine we've got a bunch on or close to the league minimum
OCLions,2ye8ml,logjam13,2,Mon Mar 9 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"No Love for Luke Boden?  Had been with the team since 2011.  Plays LB and is English, would be starting if we didn't have Shea.  And there is also Lewis Neal, who was in the club in 2011 and scored the very first goal for OCSC.  After that season, he went to DC United and played for them until selected by OCSC in last season's Expansion Draft.  He is also English and apparently him and Boden have very close friendship."

I'm looking forward to coming to the NYRB game in July when I'm in Orlando on holiday. Quick question can someone explain to me the designated player rule? I am well versed in NFL salary cap stuff (Steelers fan). Am I correct in thinking each team can designate two players that don't count towards the cap? If so what are off budget players?
OCLions,2ye8ml,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Mar 9 09:47:34 2015 UTC,"Section 11. Major League Soccer of article  Salary cap:       Here are some major points of the MLS rules and regulations for the 2014 season.   A team's roster can be made up of up to 30 players. They are eligible to be selected to the 18-player team for each game. The salary cap will be $3.1 million per team, not counting the extra salary of designated players. Players in the first 20 roster spots will count against the cap. The maximum salary for any one player is $387,500. A designated player counts $387,500 against a team's cap. However, if a player joins his team in the middle of the season, the charge against the budget will be $193.750. Players who are in the roster spots from 21-30 will not count against a team's cap. They will be known as off-budget players. Generation adidas players are off-budget players and not counted against the cap. Those in roster spots from 21–24 have a minimum salary of $48,500, and slots 25–30 have a minimum salary of $36,500. Additionally, those who earn the lowest possible league salary must be 24 or younger during the 2014 calendar year.   Since the 2012 season, the cap number for international designated players has depended on the players' ages. Since the 2013 season, players 20 or younger have counted $150,000 against the cap and those age 21 to 23 have counted $200,000, with older players remaining at the standard cap number ($368,750 for 2013 and $387,500 for 2014). For the purpose of determining a cap number, the player's age is determined solely by his year of birth.

There were so many people in purple.  Im sure a lot of shirts were bought that day as the merch lines were as long as the waits for disney rides.

This team's gonna be fun to watch this year.   I'm confused about all those yellows for diving. At the game I was convinced they were poor calls, but then I get back and check reddit and everyone's praising the ref? I don't know what to think anymore. Ruckus dudes were super friendly when I was wandering around hot and alone pre-game. Thanks for that! I'm still having those ""oh my god Kaka plays for Orlando"" moments. Is that normal?"

The Lynx Grapefruit Line was so packed that they were turning people away and this is when the game was half an hour from kickoff. Apparently it wasn't the first bus people hadn't been able to board. Oh, and it was not every five minutes, more like every fifteen minutes. Security at Gate A was a sham and only served as a way of slowing the lines down. :( Dude who checked my bag wanted to hold a conversation instead of doing his job. Sorry, but I've got a game to go to!!  The game itself was brilliant. Loved it. Incredible energy, amazing fans, beautiful men.  It was not a good idea to make the Season ticket fliers the perfect shape for paper airplanes. People were throwing flier-planes throughout the game, and I'm glad I wasn't in a lower level getting hit by sharp posterboard.   Getting out the bowl was a breeze, but the mass exodus to Downtown should have been expected and more prepared for as you got closer to Amway Center. Car were pissed that god forbid they couldn't go down Church Street. Look, there are thousands of people heading one direction. We've known about this game for months. Deal with it.  Overall, though, good times. I stayed downtown for dinner and missed a lot of the exiting traffic, but I'm curious to know how Sunrail riders fared because the station downtown looked PACKED. And I can't imagine how it must have been going northbound if other stations were as crowded as DeBary.   Also, the fans need some ""walking down the street"" chants. We got a good Ole going on the bus, but it would have been nice to been singing on the way back to our cars."
OCLions,2yefyf,pvdfan,5,Mon Mar 9 03:52:28 2015 UTC,"I ended up on the Sunrail from Sand Lake Road, but the first train was easily full with dozens being turned away and no one was allowed to board at the stop between Sand Lake and Church Street.  On the way home, people were smartly running to the southbound line at Church street to even have a chance to make it Northbound.  It must be noted there were a bunch of families riding it for fun with their kids as well.     People were throwing flier-planes throughout the game, and I'm glad I wasn't in a lower level getting hit by sharp posterboard.    Those fucking things hurt.

I finally found parking by the high school down the road. I'm going to call tomorrow and try to get a refund or credit for my Ticketmaster account.  Atmosphere was great. Crowd was awesome. Can't wait to go to another game."

OCLions,2yefyf,nautika,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:26:52 2015 UTC,The atmosphere was just insane. Everyone was amazing and we definitely will have a good consistent fan base going forward it seems. A lot of people showed up in their OCSC shirts or in purple.   There were some skeptics in a post in /r/Orlando claiming that we wouldn't actually get 62k in the stadium and a lot of tickets were just scalpers. They were definitely wrong.   I was up in the Plaza section towards the other end from the supporter section so I kind of missed the chants and all that. We did have some chants and claps going but more constant chants would be even better. Everyone was hyped up when they needed to be though so it wasn't like they weren't into it.   A win would have been better of course but pulling out that tie with 1 man down was insane.  Almost everyone was still in their seats until the very end unlike  other sporting events in Orlando.

OCLions,2yea2t,messy_messiah,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to be fair, I don't go to sporting events live, but I'm not letting one guy ruin my experience as I enjoyed what I saw on the pitch, and The Wall did a great job keeping the crowd up-tempo."
OCLions,2yea2t,pvdfan,5,Mon Mar 9 03:31:38 2015 UTC,Pay no mind to the dumbasses with that attitude.  I've seen people PAY to go to matches in years past and then shit on both teams not being as good as a Real Madrid or Manchester City.  Just have to take the good with the bad.
OCLions,2yea2t,PersianImm0rtal,2,Mon Mar 9 03:00:56 2015 UTC,"Of course, I love and appreciate the hardcore, passionate supporters, who make cheering for Orlando City great.  I guess I felt at that moment that he was pushing his beliefs onto me (not directly), and I didn't appreciate that.  I'm just a supporter who will cheer for Orlando, boo the other team, and yell at the ref, but not to the point where I'm contemplating life and death if the team loses or plays poor."
OCLions,2yea2t,sault9,3,Mon Mar 9 03:30:28 2015 UTC,"It was amazing, I loved taking the buses in and out of the stadium, and just the whole marching around everywhere in town with so much purple"
OCLions,2yea2t,longboardingerrday,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:29:19 2015 UTC,The march has to have been an experience.  I'm glad that you enjoyed it.
OCLions,2yea2t,niNroM,3,Mon Mar 9 11:54:35 2015 UTC,"By the way, thanks guys for the feedback.  I was actually worried a little that I was being too much of a wuss and not just ""manning up"" to watch a soccer game.  I truly appreciate it."
OCLions,2yea2t,niNroM,6,Mon Mar 9 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"Eh I wouldn't say you are wrong for complaining, but this is something you will expect in the supporter section. It's not something out of the ordinary. These are passionate, and rowdy fans. Many are like this guy. But you paid to be in the supporter section, so you shouldn't be too surprised about his actions"
OCLions,2yea2t,LonestarJones,6,Mon Mar 9 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"I actually wasn't in the supporter section; I was in section 108 (midfield).  And fair enough, just seemed annoying to me at times, but I guess I'm just not that type of supporter.  Also, I think what was upsetting me more than anything else was hearing him constantly go on about how ""nobody was a true supporter.""  I mean, I would think that long-time supporters would be happy that so many people came to today's match, and to cut some slack that not all of us support the club with the same passion as ""die-hard"" supporters do."
OCLions,2yg6jl,Winter_kills,2,Mon Mar 9 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"I liked it. I really wanted the first tifo to be about our club, our moment and not anything about the other team.  Last night wasn't about NYCFC, it was solely about Orlando City.  Well done SGs!  Well done!"
OCLions,2yg6jl,j_andrew_h,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:08:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. i was thinking of making a ""SHEA IS BETTER THAN SHAY"" sign, but it seemed off for a first ever game, so I'm waiting for our next game in October."
OCLions,2yg6jl,Disorted,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:17:23 2015 UTC,That is a good idea though... will be great in October!
OCLions,2yg6jl,j_andrew_h,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"Only if he's not there... by the time we play them again he should be on the team.  Honestly i like that they came out with a ""here we are"" kind of tifo instead of an attack on NYCFC thing."
OCLions,2yg6jl,spikebaylor,-2,Mon Mar 9 15:32:31 2015 UTC,We play them in July I think so we will find out then.   I was thinking like having a tifo of a missing person with Lampards face on it.
OCLions,2yg6jl,Bolivia_USA,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"We play in NY in July, they return to Orlando in October"
OCLions,2ye9oh,baltimorescouser,7,Mon Mar 9 01:35:16 2015 UTC,"Supporters section is general admission. Always has been, always will be."
OCLions,2ye9oh,Triig,8,Mon Mar 9 03:03:38 2015 UTC,Standing room only people had free reign to go anywhere.  We saw them getting booted left and right from nice seats they stole early.
OCLions,2ye9oh,pvdfan,3,Mon Mar 9 01:42:14 2015 UTC,My season tickets were in the supporters section. One season ticket holder called the police to have them removed from his seat. There was so many people not sitting in their assigned seats that the police didn't do a thing about it. I really do hope this isn't the case next home game.
OCLions,2ye9oh,VerdeMountain,15,Mon Mar 9 02:06:23 2015 UTC,Supporter section is general admission. While our season tickets have seats assigned to them that doesn't mean that is our seat.  It is only to make sure they don't oversell the section.
OCLions,2ye9oh,EaChronic,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:40:23 2015 UTC,"i don't understand, how people don't understand this... the only reason a seat is attached bc its a football stadium and has a # capacity by those seats."
OCLions,2ye9oh,Whudevs,3,Tue Mar 10 06:33:07 2015 UTC,Ticketmaster is selling supporter section as general admission for the Vancouver game.
OCLions,2ye9oh,niNroM,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:38:01 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that. Where did you end up?
OCLions,2ye9oh,cwinn13,3,Mon Mar 9 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"If your seat was in the Supporter's Section, Season Ticket or not, then you did not have an assigned seat. It is General Admission."
OCLions,2ydlun,MiloMinderbnder,7,Sun Mar 8 22:07:57 2015 UTC,We should organize match threads
OCLions,2ydlun,MicroRobo,5,Sun Mar 8 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"We should definitely do match threads.   My take on the match,  A little disappointing, but given how the second half went happy to walk away with a point. I think there were a lot of positives and negatives. Sloppy game on both sides with plenty of missed opportunities. I think Orlando looked the better side overall and I have to wonder how much nerves playing in front of such a huge crowd in the teams first MLS match played a factor. If they could just get that offense in sync they look like they could be pretty dangerous offensively.   Being expansion clubs there is going to be a learning curve for both teams, but I think once they settle down and build more chemistry both could be pretty good. I'd definitely like to see Orlando cut down on the turnovers and penalties."
OCLions,2ydlun,Smecker,4,Sun Mar 8 23:32:03 2015 UTC,"Rivas was over-excited today. He wanted a goal so bad that he was constantly sprinting through the defense before the pass was played. Overall solid performance today, and a draw is a reasonable result for both. Undefeated in the MLS!!"
OCLions,2ydlun,BobLoblawLaw_Blog,3,Mon Mar 9 00:56:33 2015 UTC,Considering that we conceded the goal and went down a man a draw is pretty good result.
OCLions,2ydlun,Smecker,10,Mon Mar 9 00:59:21 2015 UTC,Kaká!!!
OCLions,2ydlun,bjgerald,6,Sun Mar 8 23:06:43 2015 UTC,I'll need to watch a replay but way too many cards against both teams.  Shea looked very good and Kaka was as advertised.  Collin once again made a dumbfuck move and hurt the team for what will be three straight weeks.  Heath also needs to stop treating subs like they roll over from week to week.
OCLions,2ydlun,pvdfan,3,Mon Mar 9 01:51:13 2015 UTC,would've rather had rochez up top than rivas.  You could tell Rivas wasnt in game shape and having a true striker would've been nice for more than 10 minutes.
OCLions,2ydlun,feezy12,1 point,Mon Mar 9 01:28:59 2015 UTC,Was there evet a reason given for the switch? Think Rivas looked good and will be great when he and the team get the timing down on those runs.  still. ?. Rochez up top with rivas our wide will be nice.
OCLions,2ydlun,spikebaylor,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:52:20 2015 UTC,"Rivas out wide to replace who? I don't think he was good enough to start tonight. Could have just been first game jitters though, but I think Rochez should have started or at least been subbed in earlier."
OCLions,2ydlun,Triig,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:27:42 2015 UTC,"Out wide to replace Neal.  Left Mid has been his position since he signed, and is one of the catalysts for Shea playing RB.  I agree, I'd have rather seen Rochez start, or at least subbed in earlier.  I had Rochez on my fantasy team.. I was very dissapointed."
OCLions,2ydlun,spikebaylor,2,Mon Mar 9 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"I thought we dominated the match for the most part. Well earned draw. Collin deserved to see red for going in studs up but I thought most of the yellows were harsh. Rivas up top will be more effective as the team gels. Doesn't help the defense with Collin suspended but I think the attack could really get clicking, seemed like Shea, Molino, and Kaká had a pretty good understanding"
OCLions,2ydlun,logjam13,2,Mon Mar 9 01:12:10 2015 UTC,I wonder actually if collin being out may help us in the long run... Maybe it turns out hines and st ledger do a good job together. Thought hines looked decent.
OCLions,2ydlun,spikebaylor,2,Mon Mar 9 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"Hines looked good in the air, but like the rest of the defense a little shaky overall. I'm excited to see St Ledger and Hines pairing but maybe not on a short week away from home"
OCLions,2ydlun,logjam13,2,Mon Mar 9 04:46:15 2015 UTC,Could have used a few more yellows for diving...overall a great show by our boys. They worked hard and it was a ton of fun to attend!
OCLions,2ydlun,jmb117,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"Why did the goal not count when the goalie for NYCFC lost control after hitting his head on the pole? I was confused at the game and so was everyone in my section. The announcers on the replay didn't say anything either. While unfortunate and scary for his health, isn't that like losing the ball on the ground?"
OCLions,2ydlun,neongumbo,3,Mon Mar 9 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"Rivas or whoever it was ran into the keeper which is what put him into the pole to begin with.  not on purpose so no card, but definitly a free kick."
OCLions,2ydlun,spikebaylor,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:50:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification.
OCLions,2ydlun,neongumbo,3,Mon Mar 9 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"I had the same question. I guess on TV we sounded like we were booing the goalie, but in the stadium it was more of a ""WTF happened to the goal?"" boo :/"
OCLions,2ydlun,Disorted,5,Mon Mar 9 02:52:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we clapped for him when he finally got up and encouraged him, then booed him everyone he touched the ball."
OCLions,2ydlun,DullMan,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:31:04 2015 UTC,Also the ref's are trained to stop play on anything that looks like a head injury.
OCLions,2ydli7,GooieGui,2,Sun Mar 8 22:04:46 2015 UTC,"Just created one... I agree, match threads are great to have"
OCLions,2ydli7,MiloMinderbnder,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:08:58 2015 UTC,There is a giant on on /r/MLS with several thousand comments.
OCLions,2yee0l,pvdfan,3,Mon Mar 9 02:14:20 2015 UTC,"Was there, had my opinions, watched the replay...I think the ref got most of that right."
OCLions,2yee0l,DiFaz07,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:52:43 2015 UTC,Agreed after watching much of the game so far.  The only one I have disagreement with is Molino's yellow for diving.  Also props to ESPN for not having the awful ticker on the replays.
OCLions,2ycbyv,904knight,5,Sun Mar 8 15:26:35 2015 UTC,Today's Sentinel said the player bus is dropping off the players in the fan zone outside the stadium at 3:30.  No more info beyond that.
OCLions,2ycbyv,pvdfan,4,Sun Mar 8 16:17:20 2015 UTC,"I know this is late, however I saw the bus on the south side of the stadium. Walked up and then NYCFC arrived. Saw David Villa in person. Pretty awesome. That makes sense since it's closest to the locker rooms. Hopefully this will help in the future. Go City!"
OCLions,2ycbyv,pkilsheimer,2,Mon Mar 9 00:11:13 2015 UTC,"I ended up finding the spot and was in the front row where the players and staff walked through! Saw kaka up close too, it was incredible!"
