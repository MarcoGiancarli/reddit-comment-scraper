AskHistory,3e4yrm,Danicio,3,Wed Jul 22 00:12:47 2015 UTC,I'm reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. He starts at the beginning of humankind. Basically humans need religion or a shared myth or story to unite us beyond a small group. Religion (or any shared idea like nationality) gives us a means to mobilize towards a shared goal on a huge scale. Primates can only unite till about a dozen or so individuals. We can unite into really massive groups.  Religion and other myths is a way to talk about the past and future among ourselves and is an agreed idea within the group.
AskHistory,3e4yrm,getjill,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"""Religion and other myths"" I wouldn't collate the two together.  I think it's important to differentiate instances where authority and ruling class created or permeated myths and/or religion in order to subside the lower class (I'm thinking Ancient Egyptian deities, Aztec Empire, Medieval Europe and their divine right of kings) and cases where religion brought actual benefits to society (difference between pre and post Islamic Arabia is simply staggering, Judaism in the Levant and Egypt, instances of Buddhism).  To answer OP's original question (and I partially did above), I think religion was many a time used to have a firmer grasp on power, so in a way, the rulers needed it. But in fewer (but more meaningful) scenarios, religion appeared and actually helped societies grow and evolve."
AskHistory,3e4yrm,Okrios,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:19:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't explain it correctly. Religions or any shared myths lets a group of people act in very large numbers. Before religion, people might act as a small family group but to mobilize large numbers of people towards a common goal, we need a myth or shared set of beliefs.   Yuval Noah Harari also has a number of youtube videos where he talks about this."

It was against infrastructure, not people, they could easily have slaughtered every Southerner that they saw, as armies have done before and since, but they didn't. They targeted property, resources and transportation. Crime against infrastructure might be more accurate.  Sherman was deep behind enemy lines with no supply train. He was also foraging for his army at the time, taking resources and using it to feed his troops, which was a commonplace tactic in most wars throughout history.  Edit: He was also freeing slaves as he went (approx 10k marched with them), so that's always nice, positive points for humanity there.    Double edit:Wiki on the total effects:   The Army wrecked 300 miles (480 km) of railroad and numerous bridges and miles of telegraph lines. It seized 5,000 horses, 4,000 mules, and 13,000 head of cattle. It confiscated 9.5 million pounds of corn and 10.5 million pounds of fodder, and destroyed uncounted cotton gins and mills.  Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones cited the significant damage wrought to railroads and Southern logistics in the campaign and stated that ""Sherman's raid succeeded in 'knocking the Confederate war effort to pieces'."" David J. Eicher wrote that ""Sherman had accomplished an amazing task. He had defied military principles by operating deep within enemy territory and without lines of supply or communication. He destroyed much of the South's potential and psychology to wage war.""    Note the lack of wholesale slaughter that comes with most war crimes and crimes against humanity.    Triple edit:   I'd say (especially in context of the time), no it isn't/shouldn't be considered a crime against humanity."

AskHistory,3dtq9z,WindblownDust,2,Sun Jul 19 11:00:08 2015 UTC,"The best contemporary(ish) example I can think of is at the end of World War II.  Before the war countries such as Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary etc. had sometimes sizable German minorities that dated back to the Middle Ages, if not early.  People already know of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and the ostensible reason that Hitler wanted it was because it contained a substantial German minority.  Poland also had many Germans partially due to the fact that Prussia was one of the states that that benefited from the partitions of Poland in the 19th century.  Another reason (at least in 1945) was that Poland received territories such as Danzig and Stettin which had been controlled by  Prussia for hundreds of years.  One of the biggest Prussian cities to lose its German population was Konigsberg, home to Immanuel Kant and and major Prussian population center for centuries.  If you look on a map today you will not find it but rather the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a city which has few to no Germans.  Thus one of the victors' goals in 1945 was to eliminate the ""problem"" of these German minorities in order to prevent them from becoming a German cassus belli in the future.  Thus millions of ethnic Germans, many of whom had never actually lived in Germany, became refugees.  Obviously it would be hard to compare that situation to today since Germany was just defeated in a world war and was in no position to turn away these refugees.  However Germany then was destroyed by a world war and could not feed its own reduced population, let alone millions of ethnic refugees who often left their homes with the clothes on their backs and little else."

That requires a credible threat of force, or the withholding of something that the other party needs.   In NK, we can't really withhold anything they need, because they're already willing to starve their population to support their leaders. And we don't really have a credible threat of force, for no one in the area, not China, not South Korea, would find the use of force acceptable.

AskHistory,3ditkw,Quouar,2,Fri Jul 17 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"Heh, that's quite a lot you're asking for. What you have to realise is that with the fall of Yugoslavia came a lot of ethnic tensions and nationalism that Tito had worked to suppress, but which Milosevic helped bring back to the fore. Coupled with historical crimes that Croats and Bosnians had committed against Serbians, this nationalism brought hostility and a sense of ""Serbia for Serbians"" to the fore. Add religious differences to that, and the historical recipes for disaster were all there. They exploded under Milosevic's charismatic leadership.  With Sudan, you once again have the problem of religious and ethnic tension between the Muslim Arab north and the black Christian south. Struggles for resources led to civil war, and when oil was discovered in the Darfur region, the wealthier north wanted to claim it. The Sudanese government armed janjaweed militia to destroy homes and people in Darfur to claim the resources and drive these people out.  You're absolutely right that these issues are far from over. The Balkans and Sudan and South Sudan both still have a great deal of conflict, and the question of how to recover from genocide is a massive one (not to mention how to deal with the large number of Sudanese refugees that now make up a diaspora in Kenya and elsewhere). It's a large problem, and while there is recovery, that's not necessarily able to address the underlying issues.   I recommend World Without Genocide's summaries of genocides.

AskHistory,3deteu,guitar_vigilante,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"At many camps, however, the initial selection as people were getting off the train was fairly random. Some trains would be completely gassed, regardless of the skills of those on board, others would have their fates decided by a cursory glance from an SS doctor. Even within the camp, knowing a trade wasn't always a guarantee of survival. Absolutely it could help your odds, but with epidemics of typhus and dysentery running rampant, it was possible to be the world's best prison labourer and still die.   What helped was being mercenary about the camps and having connections with the guards or other, well-placed prisoners. Being willing to scramble over the backs of others helped. Maintaining mental distance from what was happening was crucial. But really, luck played a huge part in it as well."

AskHistory,3deteu,guitar_vigilante,2,Thu Jul 16 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that the prisoners in charge of corpse disposal and running the crematoria (the sonderkommando) were relatively well fed by comparison but very few survived the war. As the camps were closed and moved they were the last prisoners killed.   Having greater access and privileges than the rest of the camp allowed the sonderkommando to mount uprisings though. Treblinka, SobibÃ³r and Auschwitz all had uprisings that stemmed mainly from sonderkommando workers.  SobibÃ³r was entirely an extermination camp; the uprising and escape of prisoners at SobibÃ³r (most of which were later caught and executed) actually caused the camp to be closed, bulldozed, and planted over so it was hidden. SobibÃ³r killed 250,000 people with carbon monoxide fed by a gasoline engine into the 'showers'.   Having said that there were different types of camps. Auschwitz had both labor camps and extermination camps. If you had a trade, were good with paperwork, or were especially skilled you had a higher chance of surviving. Prisoners in war industries lasted longer."

In fact my Grandpa in WWII ended the war just outside of Linz and that's where he stood by for a few months until transport home could be arranged.  Second of all, Austria didn't become Western allied until much later in the 90s.  In the war's aftermath Austria was split into occupation zones much like Germany and Vienna was divided in a similar fashion to Berlin.  After years of negotiation the status of Austria was finally settled in the Austrian State Treaty.  This ensured Austria's neutrality in the years to come.  This is why it was incorrect to say Austria was allied with the west, at least until the 90s when Austria was one of the first new states to join the just created European Union.  Even today Austria maintains its military neutrality since it never has joined NATO.  As to why the Soviets would ""allow"" this, there are many reasons.  First off, Austria is just a remnant of the once great Hapsburg empire and its political, military and social importance is far less than it was even in 1900.  Thus letting Austria be neutral for the sake of reducing tensions with the West was part of the Soviet strategic realignment following Stalin's death.    Second of all Austria has a great place right in between the Soviet and NATO spheres of influence.  During the Cold War it was a hot bed of spying and intrigue due to its neutrality and position and neither side really wanted to give that up."

The technological inventions during the period of bubonic plague in Europe are numerous and important, mostly due to necessity.   With 1/3+ of the population dead, automation and efficiency were required to do the same work that multiple bodies could brute force a few years earlier. Hence the heavy plow, 3-field system, and simple clocks.  Automation also brought the crossbow that allowed fewer, less trained, soldiers to be effective.  Medicine went from a 'religion' to a (pseudo-)science when doctors stopped bleeding everything and discussing medicine academically ... and actually started treating patients.  With the drastically reduced population, wages skyrocketed, wealth was distributed among all classes, and the literacy rate permanently increased from 5% or so to over half the population of Europe.  Finally, with all that literacy, the Printing Press was the big whopper invention as the plague was on its last legs.  This of course, led to many more inventions on its own.

Therefore, the UN ordered Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait whilst an international force was created to take back Kuwait. Instead of withdrawing, Saddam's armies invaded Saudi Arabia (which had much more oil), so the US, UK, France and other countries landed troops in Saudi Arabia and gave the Iraqi's a deadline to leave Kuwait.

However, this was overshadowed by the bombing of fleeing Iraqi soldiers on the road from Kuwait and the withdrawal of the remnants of the Iraqi army.

AskHistory,3cjhf8,Tajtus,17,Wed Jul 8 11:48:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, slavery was the cause.  There are many revisionist historians that will deflect from this, but there is no escaping it. ALL other reasons lead directly back to slavery (states rights? To own slaves. Economic disparity? Between a serf based or slave based system).  There are many ways in which slavery impacted the economy and many of these side issues are cited as ""the real reason"" behind the war.  All those side reasons eventually (usually directly) tie in to the institution of slavery.  Now for my opinion... The north was only nominally ""better"" on the topic, and their industrial might was based off a factory system that was akin to slavery, but with a less racially homogenous workforce."
AskHistory,3cjhf8,nosferatv,7,Wed Jul 8 12:12:25 2015 UTC,"""Nominally better,"" I think is a good way to put it. Also factor in discrimination in the North against groups such as Irish or Italians.   I think it's also worth noting that while all of the side reasons tie into slavery, it was largely not for moral reasons. Obviously this is a vast generalization and there were many in the North who thought it was morally wrong to own slaves, but for much of the North, morals were not the issue. They wanted slaves gone for reasons like representation in Congress (slaves increased this for southern states, even if only by 3/5), taxes, and other such legislative matters. This can be seen in the emancipation proclamation, which ""freed"" only the slaves in the Confederate states (ultimately not doing anything because the Confederate states didn't recognize Lincoln's authority to do so), the proclamation excluded slave holding locations not in rebellion (slave holders in Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Maryland, West VA could keep their slaves). Lincoln wanted to free slaves owned by rebels, but he didn't want to piss off his slave-owning supporters. It also marked a turning point in the war because explicitly making a stand that the war was about abolition and not just union preservation caused foreign powers, mostly France and England, to back off from their thoughts if supporting the confederacy. Quite a brilliant move, really. But I digress..."
AskHistory,3cjhf8,Barrett217,2,Wed Jul 8 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"Saying the Union didn't ave moral reasons is misleading as well. John Brown's death for example, many churches rang bells for him and there were parades for him. Described as the greatest event to lead to the split, the South was extremely threatened by the north's support of John Brown. Debatable if it was largely not for moral reasons, republicans shifted their opinions pretty early on in the war about slavery(although lincoln wanted to keep a pro slavery stance)."

After the passing of the Nebraska-Kansas act, slavery was once again legal in the territories and northern businessman were suddenly worried about how to complete in the new territories against slave labor.  I don't doubt that individuals (like H. Tubman, F. Douglas, etc) did fight slavery for moral reasons alone, but the reason the country finally acted was economic/legislative, not moral.  The people in power were worried about losing their power.  If it WAS a moral reason against second-class status, why was noting done about Jim Crow laws for the next 100 years?

I agree the whole thing is hazy, however. It was an escalation of events.  I learned quite a bit about it from a modern history course in college.  The background being  humanitarian missions in Somalia after their government was overthrown. In the power vacuum, war ensued between militias. One group's leader became the new president. However, aid was being hoarded by various warlords instead of getting to the people. Particularly by Adid, who was a warlord that lost out in becoming the new leader of Somalia.  He was very anti U.N. and U.S. He ordered attacks and bombings on U.N. installments and soldiers. In response, the U.S. attacked a compound he was thought to be hiding at, but it turned out he wasn't. This turned the Somali opinion of U.S. even more sour. After a couple car bombings in which U.S. soldier where killed, Clinton responded with a 160 man task force whose mission was to find Adid based on intel from informants.  The rest was history.

I was in a student group called Peace Jam in high school(super hippy name I know). We had an event called Darfurfest where we tried to raise money for those suffering there. It felt like a noble cause except when I looked at the reality of the situation. People were dying, and schools raising thousands of dollars won't really protect people from that. Equally so, watching Hotel Rwanda(essentially my only reference besides Wikipedia) depicted the complications well. It feels like the UN is essentially useless in preventing these things with peacekeepers, but you can't just out military everywhere because that defeats the purpose of the assembly.

There were several colonial era wars, many of which were expansions of wars being fought in continental Europe.  Most other conflicts were with the Native American population, and even a few ""wars"" between trading companies mixed in.  In response to the Civil War, I would not classify it as a revolution.  A revolution overthrows the current government to replace it with a new government.  In the case of the American Civil War, the CSA seceded and started their own country and, as far as my knowledge goes, the CSA had no intention of conquering the Union and moving Jefferson Davis to Pennsylvania Ave.  Shay's Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion were just that, rebellions, rioting against the government's control.  their actions were to show their dissent on the government's actions in order to bring about a change, but not to replace the government itself."

As far as the Civil War, I still don't believe the Confederate secession should be considered as a ""revolution"", as they didn't use force to enact their initial seperation, only to affirm it.    By the textbook definition, as far as my knowledge goes it was the only true revolution in United States history. The argument could be made that at a state\local level revolutions may have occured or been attempted (Athens, TN for example) they never truky sought to remove government, just remove some in power.

It's the received pronunciation the Londoner English are known for that diverged from the rest of English while American accents probably stayed closer to the source. It's not surprising since English descended from a harsh-sounding Germanic language like you'd find today in modern Holland or Germany where words are pronounced closer to the back of the throat.  Shakespeare pronounced closer to how it would have been in Elizabethan-era London (sounds Irish to me): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPlpphT7n9s   So you can see that this harsher, Germanic-sounding dialect persisted at least through Middle English (Shakespeare is considered to be the first Modern English author).

The south on the other hand had much less industry (as they were an agricultural based region). Anyway this is key to understanding why the north would never settle for a two nation solution, as they rightfully believed that they could defeat the southerns.  Also Lincoln would never have stood for just letting go of the South. (See the House Divided Speech). So at the end of the day, the war was set up like this.

Albania was annexed in 1917, then lost in '20. They ceded the Dodecanese to Greece in exchange for a chunk of British East Africa in 1925.

Precedence was originally given to the English leopard, but King Philip of France (who was kind of a dick) tweaked him by saying ""Jesus Christ, England is this crappy little shithole of a kingdom, yet you're giving it a better spot on your arms than the great and powerful kingdom of France?

Thus, when the King of France venerates France, and talks up its significance, meanwhile some foreign king holds a backwater collection of rocks like England (you know what I mean) as his primary kingdom while still claiming the French crown, it's easy for the former to be the popular favorite, yes?

I've heard that during the ice age, with sea levels as much as 300 feet lower, it's possible that no leg of the journey would have been longer than 40 miles by sea. Even for coastal fishermen in primitive times, that's not a great distance to cross.

After visiting Aboriginal forests and learning about their way of life in Australia I found it interesting to note that the peoples had not diversified to fill Australia like the Canadian First Nations did. Our First Nations spread all across North America and adapted to a variety of environments in very little time (<12000 years). Why did the Australian aboriginal peoples not do the same? Their way of life seemed extremely primitive and undeveloped. I understand the Australian interior may have not been hospitable, but surely in 40000 years some tribes would have expanded to conquer the coast and the sea, utilizing the ocean as a way of life. Although many Canadian First Nations were nomadic, I can think of some that developed communities and agriculture.

But there's also a different perspective which more directly answers your question. And that is that they accomplished what they needed to accomplish in order to live as they wanted to.  I forget which book I was reading which described this. It might have been Guns, Germs, and Steel, but it was probably more likely the 1491 and 1493 series. Whichever it was, it describes how people lived was related to how they had to go about getting food. The Aboriginal Australians developed ways of feeding themselves which was harmonious to the environment that they lived in. This was common across the Americas with the aboriginal peoples there as well. The thing about that is that there is a great deal of Australia which is not very fertile, and doesn't support large number of people before the industrial era. The Aboriginals over time learned to support people in many ways which were environmentally neutral for that environment. That's no small accomplishment.   If they didn't go on from there and accomplish what you would call 'development', well it's because they didn't need to, and the environment that they lived in would have been less sustainable if they tried.   In contrast, most of North America, and all of Canada, has comparatively short growing seasons, and long, harsh winters. Survival through those winters requires storing food. And that in turn encourages settlement of a different kind.  So both groups of peoples were rationally responding to their environment, their available food sources, and their climate."

AskHistory,3bl634,FCColinho,2,Tue Jun 30 02:56:26 2015 UTC,"Medievalist here!  This writer is being disingenuous.  Benedictine monks were not needed to ""refound civilization.""  Civilization never ended.  This writer is missing the more relevant truth, which is that the Church, and monastic orders in particular (which are technically outside of the church in most cases) were actually instrumental in the preservation of philosophy and science through the middle ages.  The thing you didn't learn, that you should learn about now, is that the church was not a giant evil force for evil and destruction of science in the Middle Ages.  It was remarkably difficult to get yourself hanged for heresy as a scientist, and those instances where it happened had clear and identifiable political causes.  The truth about science and religion to be taken from a close study of their interaction in the Middle Ages is that religion was a mechanism, not a cause.  Religion did not make the church kill scientists - political conflicts between individual people and their ability to retain and exercise personal authority killed scientists, and religion was only the mechanism by which those people were able to exact their bloody assassinations.  Many, many of the most important scientific discoveries that lead to modern astronomy, geology, earth science, physics, chemistry, biology, came from catholic priests and monks.  The atrocities committed in the name of the church certainly prove that the church is not deserving of any special moral high ground or authority, as they are just as susceptible to greed, envy, and wrath as anyone else.  It does not prove that they are more corrupt or vile than any other human, since you would need to demonstrate that religion was adding something that was not already present in the mass of regular humans who make it up.   I was taught that the Middle Ages were a time of scientific stagnation because of religious extremism, is that incorrect?   That is, in fact, incorrect.  They were a time of scientific stagnation because of the feudal system.  Interesting concept for you: if you were to take a stroll into the city of Rome in the year, say, 800AD, the people there would be surprised to hear that the Roman empire had fallen, and dismayed to hear that they were the barbarians who had destroyed it.  Science did not advance very quickly because resources were being dedicated to the insane Danse Macabre of constant infighting between territorial rivals.  There were a few big discoveries with applications in things like glass making or navigation (mostly monks making those discoveries, since they weren't busy plowing fields or trying not to get klled in combat).  There was a lot of advancement in metallurgy, architecture, engineering, and other war-related technologies.  Ever wonder why there are lots or Roman aqueducts, but not a lot of roman Castles?  Romans built infrastructure, because they were not fighting wars against opponents who could resist.  Rome fought wars of conquest.  In the Middle Ages, they didn't invest so much in infrastructure, because infrastructure was easy to destroy.  They built castles, because their wars were wars of survival and rivalry.  And, to the last bit that you didn't mention, but surely were thinking:  ""Then why is it called the ""Dark Ages?""  It was called the dark ages because it was a period of time that left behind very few records.  Romans recorded every goddamned thing, and did so in media more likely to survive the test of time.  Medieval reliance on either very expensive vellum books (which were too expensive to record mundane things on) or cheaper parchment-y sort of paper (which rots away very quickly if not preserved), and the decentralized governments of the era resulted in a dearth of useful historical records.  The age was dark because it is hard to see it."

Contrary to popular belief it wasn't only humiliation a person could expect but a potentially grievous injury or even death!  To answer your question let me start by saying there is no evidence of people being raped while in the stocks. Conversely there is no evidence that they weren't. There are a few factors that would suggest it didn't occur however.   First of all prisoners in the pillory remained in judicial charge. There are accounts decrying the fact that constables have stood by and allowed prisoners to die, usually from rocks thrown from the mob. Another example is Edmund Burke, a politician, who denounced the death of a prisoner whose legs had been too short and had in effect been allowed to strangle in the pillory while the constables that guarded it ignored him. It is unlikely these guards would have ignored a rape.   Secondly, during the period that the stocks were used, sodomy was punishable by death. Attempted sodomy was punishable  with the pillory. A pillory which by design is situated in a public place is probably not the best place to commit a capital crime.   There isn't a lot of evidence of women being sentenced to the pillory although it did occur. Rape was also severely punished though, usually by execution."

It is the last recorded mention of her."
AskHistory,3bgt9q,Pleascah,3,Mon Jun 29 22:34:28 2015 UTC,Thanks!! This is exactly the kind of response I was hoping for!
AskHistory,3bgt9q,SiRyEm,3,Mon Jun 29 12:51:12 2015 UTC,"I have a question on your third paragraph (not quoting the whole thing).   You said that they ignored them dying, but would stop a rape. What other things do you think they would stop? I would think someone dying would be just above someone being raped. What if I walked up and beat them senseless with a stick? And ended up killing them. Would I get executed for murder? Why would mob stoning be ok, but not a single person exacting vengeance?"
AskHistory,3bgt9q,Pleascah,2,Mon Jun 29 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should have clarified that better.   In the particular case Burke is referring to there were other witnesses that thought it may have been a rock thrown from the mob that caught him on the head and that is what  killed him. As you can imagine policing a baying mob would be difficult even if the constables were bothered, however it would be pretty easy to see someone raping someone in the pillory and that in itself was a crime.   There's actually evidence that the level of security available to someone in the stocks directly correlated with the severity of the crime being punished. At that time sodomy was considered a heinous crime and a death sentence was considered justifiable.   The stocks were a method by which the justice system could be seen to be in action by involving the ""common people"". They were meant to be outraged. However the justice system could never be seen to be enabling rape or sodomy.   There was actually an investigation into Burke's claims which found the convict, a Theodosius Smith, had strangled himself while immobilised in the stocks. A fairly amazing feat!  I hope that clears it up."

AskHistory,3bgt9q,CaptainEarlobe,2,Mon Jun 29 12:33:28 2015 UTC,"Well at that time rape was considered differently to now.   ""Rape is the carnal abusing of a woman against her will. But if the woman conceive upon any carnal abusing of her, that is no rape, for she cannot conceive unless she consent."" Sir Henry Finch, Law or Discourse Thereof (1627)  That is if the woman ""quickened with child"" then it was found no rape had occurred. Not so different in some regards to today I guess.   If the woman was a daughter below the age of consent or a wife then it was the male patriarch that would lay charges. An unattached woman was immediately viewed with suspicion.   However if the woman were in the custody of the judicial system then they became responsible for her welfare. To a point. While she was more than welcome to be stoned to death or die of ""prison fever"" you're correct in thinking it is unlikely the authorities would facilitate her rape.   There are many accounts of women ""pleading their belly"" or becoming pregnant while in gaol and so avoiding a death penalty. Mary Read and Anne Bonney for example. While they may have been complicit in the act with a friendly gaoler, one could argue that a looming death sentence removes any notion of consent."

Long answer: Hitler believed in a very specific utopian society based around the German people and the utilization of their neighbors. This belief held that the Aryan race (basically Germans) were genetically superior to all other races (these ideas were originally British in origin, but were adopted by some Germans as well). With this idea of racial superiority, Hitler sought to establish this dominance over all the inferior races. Some races (Anglo-Saxons mainly) were not seen as inferior however, but as allies to the Aryans. Unfortunately, in order to achieve this dream utopia, Hitler ordered the execution of all the terrible acts that media and mediocre history teachers have brainwashed most of us with.   EDIT: For the others who claim it all was a mental disorder. No, it was not. Hitler got to power through tact, force, and genius. He did start to lose it when the weight of everything fell on him when the Soviets invaded Berlin, obviously.

The purpose of the natural born citizen clause is to protect the nation from foreign influence. Alexander Hamilton, a Convention delegate from New York, wrote in Federalist No. 68 about the care that must be taken in selecting the president: ""Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.""[5]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause#Rationale"

Scalia is a brilliant jurist, but when it touches on any neo-conservarice issue, he goes off the rail and people love to watch him freak out. Upholding a ban on pot under the commerce clause while in any other opinons he is constantly snarling about Federal overeach under the commerce clause.   I'm on mobile but just off the top of my head,  the first FDRoosevelt Court was really divided, Justices Frankfurter and (IIRC) Black hated each other so much they literally wouldn't speak to each other.  That's just off the top of my head in the car, there's lots more."

How serious these consequences may prove to be, only time can tell. But the basic flaws in the Court's justification seem to me readily apparent now, once all sides of the problem are considered.""

AskHistory,3b3w8a,ShutUpHeExplained,8,Thu Jun 25 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"Not to interrupt the rathiest circlejerk, but you might be interested in:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/25vh0g/did_ancient_god_kings_actually_believe_themselves/  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2j0i8d/did_those_rulers_of_the_ancient_world_who_were/  Due to humanity's lack of telepathic powers, it's often really, really difficult to decipher what people 'really believe'.  (Quite a few of my religious studies professors, from back in the day, would argue that 'what did they believe' is an unscientific question, because it's nonfalsifiable - in studying religion, we should study what people say and do, and not even talk about belief.)  This becomes even more of a problem when the people we're studying have obvious biases in favor of professing religious belief.    Also, there are some problems with your question.  Divinity is not necessarily a matter of powers and abilities - plenty of rulers, even today, would argue that they are special to some God or gods specifically because of their earthly status.  (If having power of life and death over every human being in Egypt isn't godlike, what is?)  Also, there's some argument over how far the pharaohs were seen as gods themselves; it's more likely the average Egyptian saw them as mediators between the gods and mankind (similar to some interpretations of Catholic saints), only ascending to true divinity after death, and/or as a host for the divine power (an incarnation of Horus/Osiris) allowing this mediation.  No magic tricks were required to prove this - the success and prosperity of Egypt itself would be 'proof' that the Pharaoh was doing his job properly.  Anyway, tl;dr, no, we can't read the minds of ancient god-kings, and we don't know how they thought of themselves, but they did not need mysterious supernatural powers to 'prove' their divinity."
AskHistory,3b3w8a,aescolanus,2,Fri Jun 26 02:10:32 2015 UTC,It's also important to keep in mind that the idea of divinity=omnipotence and omniscience is a fairly recent construct.
