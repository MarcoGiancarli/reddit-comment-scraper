darktower,3da2k3,YoungForrestGump,2,Tue Jul 14 21:26:42 2015 UTC,I was listening to it as an audiobook and just finished it today. I was actually pissed that it was about to end with Eddie and Susanna until I read the coda. Now tonight I wonder if I will forever regret reading past where King warns. I wonder if there is a person who stopped reading there

Every time he gets to the tower he his closer to redemption, possibly each time he his also saving the destruction of different worlds. Otherwise it seems like Roland is trapped forever and it makes me really sad"
darktower,3da2k3,Monteitoro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"I realize each loop can be different, vis a vis the horn of eld in the beginning of the next loop the audience sees.  But, the story presents a sort of Sisyphean scenario, which is also very similar to the themes around Mercer in ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".  Roland sustains the world through his tortuous loops.  When you think of it that way, its a creative re-rendering of New Testament."
darktower,3da2k3,BalconyFace,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:15 2015 UTC,so you are saying Roland is analagous to Jesus as a sacrificial savior? I like that.
darktower,3da2k3,Monteitoro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"something like that.  in Dick's book Mercer has to continuously walk up hill as he's pelted with rocks and cursed at by spectators.  Roland doesn't give himself to it knowing he's done it before, the amnesia is critical.  You hear him beg for mercy before he winds up back at the beginning.  but King offers an out since it seems like each loop can be slightly different.  this would suggest each loop is amassing towards something, but what that is who knows."

darktower,3cpyuy,Eastvaledan,3,Thu Jul 9 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"This may not be the complete answer, but I'd imagine it has something to do with Ka and the fact that through losing her legs Detta/Odetta was able to grow into a new person and move forward with her/their lives, once pulled into Mid-World Susannah came forward as stronger than the both of them. I'm not sure how Mia would fit into this explanation. By and large, I'd say it is because she doesn't need them.

Much of what we learn about her (and Mia) is done through the exploration of members of the Tet into her history and psyche.    When the tet breaks (Say Sorry) Suze loses most of what made her great.  Instead of being the strong independent woman that Eddie fell for she instead pines for her lost love and falls FAR into the backdrop.  Her actions upon Roland's return to Fedic are motivated by 2 things: Survival, and return to Eddie Dean.    She'd survived: Blaine, Wolves, Birth, Mordred and the Devar-toi without legs. She doesn't need them. What she NEEDS is Eddie."

While I think Aaron Paul's amazing in Breaking Bad, he was definitely one of the best parts of the show, I think it would be a bad idea to cast him as Eddie because everyone would see him be thinking about Jesse Pinkman instead of Eddie Dean. Since the characters have so much in common (if Eddie reached the level of the Tower with the Breaking Bad universe, he and Jesse would become best friends) that his performance, and by extension some of the show, would be thought of in comparison to Breaking Bad instead of considered for its own merits. I seriously love Aaron Paul (anyone watched Bojack Horseman? Paul produced it and is a voice for one of the main characters, it's great) but I hope he doesn't play Eddie."

As much as I would love to see these books transferred to film (and I really would), I think its best chance at not being terrible would be to put it on TV. Just imagine the potential of a Dark Tower series on HBO, Showtime, or even AMC. It could be glorious!    If they insist on doing movies, however, it really should get the Lord of The Rings treatment where they write out the entire script and film the whole thing straight through.  Keep the same actors, stylists, and directors. I truly fear this will end up like the Harry Potter films where each movie has a different feel and art style because each one had a different director.  I liked the Harry Potter books, but most of the movies were rough to watch"
darktower,325hn8,MitchyP_03,2,Fri Apr 10 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"The article says that the series will be movies, accompanied by TV shows, which I feel is the best approach. My only worry is that this won't be picked up by a TV station that can do the content justice. I'm just happy that it seems to be finally getting off the ground.   Now, if they make one or two movies then abandon the project, that will be a problem. For now though, I'm staying positive that we'll see Roland and the gang on the big screen."

The Gunslinger: Walter/The Man in Black The Drawing of Three: Eddie Dean The Wastelands: Jake Chambers  Wizard and Glass: Cuthbert Allgood The Wind Through the Keyhole: Tim Stoutheart The Wolves of the Calla: Pere Donald Callahan (love his back story) Song of Susannah: I am honestly not a fan of this book. So N/A The Dark Tower: Roland of course   I do have a clear dislike of one character. I have never been a fan of Susannah Dean.

darktower,3140nb,vikingstomp,5,Wed Apr 1 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree about song of Susannah, it is the weakest of the books, in the beginning at least.

darktower,3140nb,Venom2012,4,Thu Apr 2 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"A pretty tricky character to write about though. Split personalaties in different times & two life changing events would be pretty tough.  I've also come to realise the annoying characters you dont like in a story are their for a reason, not necessarily to make you happy, they've another role to fill.  To answer the question though, overall all series obviously The great Roland, a personal favourite was Steven Deschain his father. I would love to read a tale of his earlier adventures.

I have an obsession with Dachshunds, and when I started the series I was raising my first doxie puppy. My mental image of Oy is much different than the consensus of how they should look via their description, but that's part of the nuance of reading. But Oy's understanding of their surrounding combined with his simplistic bliss was beautiful to me. I think King captured the relationship and bond of a boy and his pet to an extent that I've never felt before. I cried when Oy went to the clearing at the end of the path."

I don't think Wizard and Glass would be half the novel it is if the reader weren't simply so excited to get a glimpse of younger Roland and his old ka-tet.

I don't think it's a story that could feel real and justly epic with a lead that is just a well known, good or entertaining actor - it's the God damn quest for the center of the universe.

Regarding Dumbledore he said he never needs to read the books because the script was good enough, besides when he plays a role he just plays himself. He said to play Dumbledore all he needed to do was slap on a beard and play himself. This is the most incredibly imaginative fantasy series ever written IMO and if it gets filmed needs to have a team willing to dedicate parts of their lives to making it real, the way King took 40 years to write it."

If Sangster still looks like a teenager at 25, chances are he'll keep those looks long enough to finish all 7 films"
darktower,2sbmhr,maibalzich,2,Wed Jan 14 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on how long they take. There are 7 books and if they filmed like Harry Potter they could do it in 9 years. If they filmed this year, he'd be nearly 35 by the time they were done. There's just no way he'd be able to pass as a young teenager for a decade.  I agree with you that his looks are perfect, but Jake needs to be cast by a young boy. He's a little kid. Eddie is also only in his early 20s, Susannah in her mid-20s. A lot of film adaptations tend to use older actors and actresses than what the source materials call for and I think this series should be different. I'm most convinced that this series would need a cast of mostly unknowns. Use famous people in secondary roles, sure, but at the very least the main 4 should be people we've probably never heard of."

darktower,2j6jw5,MDCCCLXV,8,Tue Oct 14 03:06:41 2014 UTC,I disagree. It sets the stage for who Roland is to become as an adult. The crushing loss of love and sacrifice are integral to the character and the kind of person he is throughout the story. His lost love helped to define him...For better or worse.
darktower,2j6jw5,TheOccultist,5,Tue Oct 14 14:42:06 2014 UTC,"Spoilers for the end of Wizard and Glass, don't read till you finish.   Are you telling me that if you were a teenager and saw the first person you ever loved get burnt alive, all while you could have saved her but didnt, that you wouldn't be scared for life? How is that not a meaningful loss?"
darktower,2j6jw5,TychoTiberius,1 point,Tue Oct 14 17:54:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the burned alive part is a bitch. I guess thinking about it more, I realize that that is why it is such a problem, the way of the separation. If they had been able to try an actual relationship and then like most 14 year olds, get over it, it wouldn't be so bad. Lots of people can look back at a high school relationship and think, oh yeah, I thought it was true love, but I was a stupid 14 year old. But if you were still in love in that 14 year old way and saw that person die before your eyes, it might lock in that feeling and you wouldn't ever grow out of what you thought was true love."
darktower,2j6jw5,Giggles_McKing,2,Wed Oct 15 21:29:02 2014 UTC,"I think it goes a bit deeper than that.  He was all for not being a gunslinger as soon as he beat the Good Man's troops in the Mejis.  And then he got hold of the Grapefruit.  It wasn't really a love story that he was telling, truth be told.  He said so towards the end that when he got a glimpse of the Tower and saw that there was trouble, he couldn't be with Susan any more.  I think the story was to show to what lengths he would go to obtain the Tower and how badly it burned at his conscience.  I could be wrong though."

I always pictured Mejis as being something like an 1800's country--people get married young. A 14 year old in love can get married and have a life--to see your love die at that age is really tragic because they could have literally been your life partner."

darktower,2h3fow,TychoTiberius,3,Mon Sep 22 13:49:48 2014 UTC,"Nah, don't bother with the miniseries.  Read the book because it's a great book but really you don't need to read it as the character who shows up from that book has much of his backstory explained in Wolves."

darktower,2elrb8,gervans23,7,Tue Aug 26 06:00:50 2014 UTC,"Wizard and Glass is great but I'd have to say my favorite is The Drawing of the Three. I had kind of a hard time getting through The Gunslinger but once I got to book two, it was on! When Roland came into Eddie's world I was blown away and that feeling just continued to get stronger as I kept reading"
darktower,2elrb8,planetsmasher86,2,Tue Aug 26 07:30:13 2014 UTC,"Drawing of the three was the book that really showed me that there was something more to this series. The gunslinger was confusing, and despite how amazing Blaine the Mono was later, the Wasteland had some really slow bits... Wizard and Glass was awesome but I don't know if I was ready for a prequel yet... Then the later books were.. different. So The Drawing of the Three was really what sucked me into the world."
darktower,2elrb8,foxsable,2,Tue Aug 26 12:00:50 2014 UTC,"Agreed, I'm reading it right now (working on my second read through) and I'm nearly done. I think my favorite part about it is Eddie's complete willingness (resigned? doesn't matter) after a point to help Roland (aside from his threat on the beach) and love for him, even though he was torn from everything he knew to some beach in some universe to help some stranger on his mad quest. This is why Eddie is my favorite character. From total heroin junkie to gunslinger in arms."
darktower,2elrb8,ShardikOfTheBeam,3,Tue Aug 26 13:32:09 2014 UTC,I love Wizard and Glass as well but I think Wolves of the Calla is my favorite. Father Callahan is one of my favorite characters.

darktower,2elrb8,TheOccultist,2,Tue Aug 26 13:01:25 2014 UTC,"To me, Wizard and Glass isn't just the best Dark Tower novel, it's the best Stephen King novel period. That said, what I say doesn't have much weight considering I probably haven't read a third of what he has wrote...  However, while I think Wizard and Glass is the best, I enjoy reading Drawing of the Three the most. It really set the tone for the series."
darktower,2elrb8,lendawg,1 point,Tue Aug 26 11:41:44 2014 UTC,"Wizard and glass is very different than almost any other book of his that I've read. It's an epic western, I think he put a lot more of his influence from 70's westerns into the story."
darktower,2elrb8,ShardikOfTheBeam,2,Tue Aug 26 19:14:15 2014 UTC,"I'm on my second read through (only about to finish the Drawing of the Three), but if memory serves I believe Wolves of the Calla was my favorite of the seven eight.  In order from the last time I read them (5 years? 6?)   Wolves of the Calla Drawing of the Three Wizard and Glass Songs of Susannah Wind through the Keyhole Wastelands Gunslinger Dark Tower   Ironically enough, the Dark Tower (with exception of Wind Through the Keyhole, and the first two books on my second read through which has been within this last week) was the most recent book I read of the series, and its the longest, and I literally don't remember almost anything about it except the end, the painter, the town where it was snowing with some kind of monster, and Oy sacrificing himself to allow Roland to kill Mordred."
darktower,2elrb8,JoyBus147,2,Tue Aug 26 13:37:34 2014 UTC,"The drawing of the three is a close second for me, it's such a great book. I Love the battle scene in Balazars office."

Funnily enough, I really liked Wizard and Glass, but the guy who introduced me to the series hated it (""it's an obnoxious love story between two stupid fourteen year olds!""), so it's refreshing to see other people who love it."

darktower,2946az,EarthDragon2189,9,Thu Jun 26 02:20:09 2014 UTC,"The ending hinted that Roland had gone through his quest multiple times and always restarted. The difference this time is that he made relationships he actually cared about in his ka-tet, normally he just sacrificed his ka-mates to reach the tower then restarted. The ending shows Roland in possession of the Horn of Eld which he lost on Jericho Hill where he sacrificed his original ka-tet.   He made connections with Suze, Jake, Eddie and Oy that he actually valued. With these concepts from the story, I think this means that maybe next time he reaches the tower, he won't restart. Or he will restart until he somehow abandons his quest for the Dark Tower and enjoys life. The journey is more important than the end, ves ka Gan leads to sacrifice, abandon thy quest gunslinger for the tower and know peace. Say thankya."
darktower,2946az,Gataru,3,Thu Jun 26 04:34:28 2014 UTC,"I liked your comment, I just wanna put Afew points in: I don't believe Roland chose to sacrifice his original Ka-yet at Jericho hill, I think theirs a passage saying his training told him his life could be saved if he did everything right, (again I think he hid under a body?), I also don't believe he would ever stop his quest for the dark tower, Ka is a wheel after all. And finally as for the starting out with the horn of the Eld, again Ka is a wheel, and where we started.   Loved your post though, mean no offense! Say thankyee"
darktower,2946az,akcobs52,3,Thu Jun 26 04:44:38 2014 UTC,"I think that that Dark Tower will keep ""respawning"" Roland, until he is ""pure"" in his desire/goal/etc. Roland is like a Knight in medieval tales, except he doesn't fit properly into model - ergo he will sacrifice anyone and anything to reach his goal - in that case - this is mysterious Dark Tower. We do not know what Dark Tower is in fact - all we know Roland will not be let in into final room on the top, until he ""deserves"" it. And it doesn't mean all he has to do is reach to Tower - he has to reach it in ""pure/good/Eld-worthy"" way.  And if he is supposed to repeat all of this in eternity - what's the meaning of Susannah's return into ""our world""? She abandons her gun, which belonged to Roland and this gun after going through doors is very old - this means - time has passed.  I can't figure that detail out so far :D"
darktower,2946az,MajkiF,1 point,Wed Jul 2 13:53:21 2014 UTC,"I suppose that makes sense...he never really needed to go to the Tower, after all. If he had just ended his quest after saving King and stopping the Breaking, then the Crimson King would have wasted away on the Tower's steps, the Beams would have repaired themselves over time, and he wouldn't be forced to relive the journey."
darktower,2946az,Gataru,2,Thu Jun 26 05:48:45 2014 UTC,"It seems like Rolands quest is all about his curiosity. You are right that he doesn't need to enter the tower at all. He mentions wanting to see what lies at the top of the Dark Tower and question whatever God resides there. We are painfully aware how pointless this goal is.  I'm not 100% on this but I think the mention of him having the horn is very significant because he didn't originally have it in The Gunslinger book that we all know. I think it's a glimmer of hope by SK that the father(:P) we grew to love and admire won't suffer the hell of reliving his quest. Roland could easily be happy with saving the beams and maybe focusing on reestablishing the line of eld now that the world isn't ""moved on""."
darktower,2946az,TychoTiberius,6,Thu Jun 26 08:31:01 2014 UTC,"Congratulations on finishing! How did you feel about the ending? I loved it but I know I'm in a semi-minority there. After I read it I came up with a few ideas as to why, but I've never really talked about them so I'd like to see what others think.   1. The series as a metaphor for literature/life. Under this idea Roland has to keep restarting the journey as long as there are people starting to read the book. He is literally just a book character, although one that happens to exist in multiple realities. You are pushing Roland towards the Dark Tower as a reader. At the end you push him into the Tower, just to start his journey again, because you can't stand not knowing the ending of the book just like how Roland can not stand not knowing what is at the top of the Tower. This translates into a greater metaphor for literature and life in telling us that the destination is no important, it is the experiences we have and the people we love along the way and we shouldn't sacrifice those things for anything.   2. Roland as the eternal savior. The idea here is that there will always be a great evil trying to destroy The Tower/all the universes and Roland must continually face this evil for all of eternity. There is no great happy ending because evil will always creep back up and try to destroy everything. So Roland has been tasked with having to save reality for the rest of time, either because he is being punished for past sins for because he is the only one capable of saving The Tower.   3. The standard theory. The idea that Roland must repeat his Tower trip until he gets it right. This is definitely the strongest theory and the one most supported by the books. I won't go into because so many others have written so much about it, but the basic idea is that this is some kind of punishment for Roland that he is stuck in until he learns his lesson."
darktower,2946az,pault32,1 point,Wed Jul 2 14:30:43 2014 UTC,"I liked the ending...it was surreal and strange with a dash of hope, which is to say it was a perfect fit for the series. I just wish I understood more about it, which I suppose is true for most of the journey. Of course, maybe that dash of mystery is the soul of the books, which is why pretty much any theory I've heard about the ending seems at least reasonable (even if I don't like it). Personally I like the second theory best."
darktower,2946az,JacobtheEdgin,2,Wed Jul 2 15:03:10 2014 UTC,I liked the ending as well... Made me want to start over again hoping the story would change! I'd totally do it all over again. Sadly rereading the first page out an end to that.
darktower,2946az,Beast_Of_Bourbon,2,Sun Jul 27 15:32:53 2014 UTC,"SPOILERS: I was curious too, since it starts him this time with the horn...what is the criteria for getting it right?  Not sacrificing Jake at the way station? Then what?"
darktower,2946az,theavon,2,Thu Jun 26 03:11:19 2014 UTC,"I thought it was that each run through would repair a beam. When all beams were repaired, he'd be done. But then what would be at the top when he finishes? I don't have a convincing answer."

darktower,283xj5,JerichoKriste,3,Sat Jun 14 04:10:10 2014 UTC,"I got the impression low speech was an American dialect, since the katet had no issues with understanding him. He just had an issue with sound groupings he never had to use before.   As for high speech I don't know why but I always assumed it was another form of Germanic language. Sort of like old English.   It seemed as most people were familiar with both, so they must be similar. It wasn't necessarily used for people from gilead, but more as a sign of respect.   He very often used it when speaking to elders, and people of importance."

darktower,283xj5,knowyourknot,1 point,Thu Jun 26 03:47:05 2014 UTC,"Imagine that thousands of years ago English used to have--like many other languages do--different tenses for formal and for familiar speech.  Now imagine that aspect of the language fell to the wayside for some reason sometime around Shakespeare or Chaucer, and then the language continued to evolve for hundreds of years since then.  If Chaucer can seem difficult to us now, imagine how alien formal Chaucer would be.   I think high and low speech are kind of like that. It makes sense to me in a ""the world has moved on"" kind of way.  Low speech, once upon a time, was probably much closer to high speech in the same way that slow mutants and the Children of Roderick were one upon a time much closer to human.  Inhabitants of mid-world can (if they choose to) recognize the humanity in the C. of R., and recognize language in both high and low speech. But someone from our where and when would find the mutants and the language completely bizarre.  I think that Roland simply experiences the same, vice versa. He's completely at home speaking the language of (in this analogy) Shakespeare. But the same way the Bard made up so many words, oh my gosh so have we, and his accent is understandably a little off."
darktower,283xj5,MetalMarthaStewart,1 point,Mon Aug 18 03:19:16 2014 UTC,"The Spanish language has male and female, formal and informal word and phrases. The accent doesn't change. I imagine it is similar."

darktower,208v5g,frankdamedic,2,Wed Mar 12 21:56:49 2014 UTC,"Well, before Game of Thrones was on TV the A Song of Ice and Fire series had only sold about 8.5 million books (around 2 million per book) and now it's a contender for the most popular show on TV. In comparison, the Dark Tower has sold over 30 million books (around 4 million per book), so it's about twice as popular as ASOIAF was before it got adapted. I think the real key is making a high quality adaptation, which I honestly don't have much hope for. I'd love to see a movie/TV version of DT, I just don't expect it to be good."
darktower,208v5g,tinmanjr,1 point,Wed Jul 2 14:43:44 2014 UTC,"I think reddit popularity might be a poor metric on this one because its an older series. Not a lot of new info or information coming out about DT. That said, you may very well be right."
darktower,1zdmoz,chdeks,3,Sun Mar 2 21:58:45 2014 UTC,"Well met, all paths serve the beam."
darktower,1zdmoz,Namkr0w,2,Mon Mar 3 02:43:06 2014 UTC,I have one as well. Mine looks more like a wood engraving into my shoulder though.  And I have the Crimson Kings eye on the other shoulder.
darktower,1yermg,sfled,1 point,Thu Feb 20 03:49:17 2014 UTC,Aha! I knew the idea of screens instead of windows was familiar...
darktower,1y9xjs,brentfield,2,Tue Feb 18 21:04:01 2014 UTC,Yea...I wouldn't wear that for sure.
darktower,1y9xjs,freelandford,1 point,Tue Feb 18 21:23:03 2014 UTC,Yeah... If I didn't get the reference I'd probably consider you a freak. But it is a cool shirt!
darktower,1y3spr,SergioAStorms,2,Mon Feb 17 01:14:14 2014 UTC,I think he would be pretty good. I think Timothy Olyphant from Justified would also make a good fit. I can't see Russel Crowe playing Roland though
darktower,1y3spr,planetsmasher86,1 point,Mon Feb 17 09:38:13 2014 UTC,"I don't know why, but I can't see Olyphant. The tone seems a little off, and while I love the actor and the characters he portrays, they seem too different."
darktower,1y3spr,ProfessorHydeWhite,2,Wed Mar 12 18:54:51 2014 UTC,This would be good. I've also been thinking Josh Brolin could fit nicely.
darktower,1y3spr,HurricaneMedina,1 point,Wed Mar 5 15:09:42 2014 UTC,Most definitely

darktower,1y3spr,ohwhatanerd,1 point,Mon Feb 17 05:04:53 2014 UTC,"Timothy Olyphant, Anson, or even Darryl from Walking Dead could do it. Olyphant would be perfect imo.   Russell Crowe is not Roland."
darktower,1y3spr,tinmanjr,2,Mon Feb 17 20:18:49 2014 UTC,"Norman Reedus would be a strange Roland, though it would guarantee my wife wanting to watch it."

darktower,1wf19z,demonoid01,3,Wed Jan 29 00:05:05 2014 UTC,"Well, he isn't named, so it's impossible to know which Taheen he is, but I don't remember any other reference to the Taheen until Wolves (the Taheen in Gunslinger was not in the original, I may be mistaken, but I don't think we are even introduced to them, by name, until Wolves or later.   Now, after saying that, I can't remember if we ever see the faces of the low men in Hearts in Atlantis or if they were ever referenced as Taheen."
darktower,1wf19z,arthureld,2,Wed Jan 29 19:10:25 2014 UTC,I figured it'd not be referenced also I must have a edited version because they seem to mention a lot more about shit you don't hear till wizard and glass or at least wolves they also stated that both brown and Sheb were both in mejis when Susan was killed in regards to hearts in Atlantis I've never read it so I'm not sure
darktower,1wf19z,who_is_saying_haim,2,Thu Jan 30 19:19:35 2014 UTC,He reedited the first book to make it a little smoother read. Added in some stuff to link the start and end of the series. I believe the wiki has a list of all the changes made to the first book
darktower,1wf19z,sittered,2,Fri Mar 7 19:04:21 2014 UTC,I think the low men (can-toi) are distinct from the taheen.

It was more impacting then the flood of memories I was going through.  I started to bend it to see what it looked like as cylinder and I found the writing on the back.  I know I've looked at this photograph at least 20 times since I finished the Dark Tower, yet the memory of it being my bookmark throughout my entire journey beginning in 1994, waiting for the last three to come out, and still using the same bookmark and remember that that photo was for that series only was profound moment on me. I found a relationship with a book mark; to one of the most important reads of my life.  I just want to share that experience."
